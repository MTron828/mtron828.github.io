Chapter 442: Sweep Away All Adversaries!

“Big Sister, Skyla,” William said softly as he stared at the White Crane who seemed to be preparing to unleash a strong attack due to anger.

“Krooooo!” Skyla dived towards the ground as she transformed into a blue comet.

She planned on ending Elandorr’s life once and for all without caring about the consequences of her actions. The Blademaster wasn’t able to react in time and could only watch helplessly as the enraged White Crane went past him.

“Senior Sister, please stop!” Princess Eowyn stood in front of Elandorr with her arms stretched wide.

Skyla recognized the Princess and immediately turned to the side, avoiding her completely. Even so, the gust of wind that followed behind her attack almost blew the Elven Princess away. Fortunately, the Blademaster, acting as her guardian, held her waist to keep her in place.

The hate-filled cry of the Crane descended upon all the Elves within the forest. Skyla had unleashed her overbearing Beast Aura, which forced the Elves to kneel on the ground. The fallen Dragon had once again regained its bearing and roared back at the White Crane who was hovering in the sky.

Seeing that a mere Silver Dragon dared to roar at her, the White Crane dived down like an arrow to vent out its anger at the Millennial Beast who dared to defy her.

The Silver Dragon didn’t back down and flapped its wings to fight the backstabbing Crane who had knocked it out of the sky. Skyla used its swing to slap the dragon’s head, making it roar in pain.

Although her opponent was five times bigger than her, the White Crane fearlessly bombarded it with Wind Blades at point blank range.

Still, a Silver Dragon at the Peak of the Millennial Rank was no pushover. Earlier, Skyla was able to get the upper hand because she had unleashed a surprise attack.

The White Crane was only at the Middle Stages of the Millennial Rank, and the Silver Dragon was considered one of the High-Tiered Beasts in the Silvermoon Continent. Its scales were very resistant to Magic and Physical attacks. Even so, it was still unable to properly deal with the swift and agile Crane who almost pecked its eye out during one of their collisions.

Perhaps due to luck, or perhaps it had waited for the right moment, the Silver Dragon used its tail to lash at the White Crane that was making its life difficult. The tail squarely hit the side of Skyla’s body, sending her crashing towards the ground.

“Big Sister!” William’s eyes became bloodshot as he ran towards the White Crane that had been injured because of him.

“Big Sister! Are you fine?” William asked as he held the White Crane’s Head.

“Kroooo? Kroooo! Kroooo?!” (Do I look fine? Fool! That bastard dared to harm your Big SIster. Are you just going to watch as that overgrown lizard bully me?!)

William sighed in relief because Skyla seemed to be fine despite receiving a full-powered strike from the Silver Dragon.

“Wait here, Big Sister,” William said as he stood in front of the White Crane that loved him dearly. “I’ll cook us some Dragon Meat BBQ for dinner.”

The Silver Dragon fired its Dragon Breath towards the Half-Elf and the White Crane that were on the ground. It didn’t want to give Skyla another opportunity to challenge him in an aerial battle because what had happened earlier was just a fluke.

“Sweep away all adversaries,” William declared as a golden-metallic staff appeared in his hands. “Ruyi Jingu Bang!”

The golden staff in his hand extended forward to meet the Dragon’s Breath. It grew in a matter of seconds. The Dragon Breath was completely nullified by the hundred-meter-thick golden staff.

The Silver Dragon roared in fright as it flapped its wings to distance itself from the staff of unprecedented proportions.

“Where do you think you’re going?” William asked with a sneer as he swatted the Silver Dragon in the air like a pesky bug.

The Silver Dragon was like a little puppy that wasn’t able to prevent itself from being body-slammed by an Elephant.

When the staff smashed on the ground, half of the forest was decimated. The Elves that were nearby had been blown away by the shockwave that followed the impact. All of them received serious injuries as they collided with the trees in the forest.

“I-Impossible!” Elandorr’s body shuddered as he looked at this scene in disbelief. He refused to believe what he was seeing and for a moment, he thought that he was dreaming.

Unfortunately, he was not, so he could only look at the carnage with a pale expression.

William raised the staff to see what happened to the Silver Dragon that dared to harm Skyla. Surprisingly, the Silver Dragon had only received minor injuries because it had made its scales as hard as adamantium.

The Half-Elf smirked. He didn’t expect that he would be able to beat a Millennial Beast with a single strike. However, he didn’t intend to give the Silver Dragon a quick death. Once again, he slammed the giant metallic rod on its body.

The Silver Dragon roared in pain with each successive strike William unleashed. The Half-Elf was merely toying with the Silver Dragon, making it suffer before going in for the kill.

“Stop!” The Blademaster that protected Elandorr earlier shouted. “This Duel is over! You already won! If you don’t stop your actions, I will be forced to subdue you!”

William glanced at the Blademaster and gave him a devilish grin. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“You think just because you told me to stop, I will stop?” William asked in a teasing manner. “When you Elves invaded the Zelan Dynasty and the children begged you to stop torturing them, did you stop? Did you show them mercy?”

William sneered as he plucked out a few hairs from his head. He then blew on them as they scattered in the wind.

Soon, a dozen Williams appeared holding the same golden-metallic staff in their hands. William, as well as his clones pointed at their faces as they continued their taunt.

“”Does this face look like the face of mercy to you?””

William’s current strength in his Heroic Avatar form was equivalent to a Saint. Since that was the case, he didn’t need to obey anyone’s orders because he was now among those who stood at the peak of the Mortal Realm, thanks to Sun Wukong’s overwhelming might.

“”Sweep away all adversaries!””

All of William’s clones shouted in unison as they somersaulted in the air. They nimbly landed on white clouds as the weapons in their hands extended and grew in size.

“”Ruyi Jingu Bang!””

The expression of the Blademaster became grim as he dodged hurriedly to the side. A giant staff slammed against the ground where he stood a while ago, which proved that William wouldn’t listen to their demands.

Soon, sounds of screams filled with fear rang in the forests as the Elves fled in every direction.

Elandorr decisively activated the teleport scroll in his possession, which would take him back to the capital. He knew that staying would be pointless, so he decided to escape while he could.

The Blademaster that guarded Princess Eowyn did the same as he grabbed hold of the Princess.

After making sure that the Princess was safe, the Blademaster that confronted William earlier also used his teleport scroll to leave.

William’s clones snorted as they watched the beams of lights streak towards the sky. They ignored these four people, and shifted their attention to the Elves that were lying on the ground.

The Half-Elf’s purpose for luring the Elves into the territory of the Minotaur Race was to conduct a massacre. His only regret was that he was not able to kill Elandorr because the latter didn’t hesitate to leave his subordinates behind.

Naturally, William had no intention of hurting Princess Eowyn, so he allowed her to escape back to the capital.

“Well, it’s fine,” William glanced at the ground where several injured Elves lay helplessly. “Kill them all!”

The clones swatted the fallen Elves without batting an eye. Screams asking for forgiveness and mercy reached William’s ears but he turned a deaf ear to it.

This was war.

“Wars don’t prove who’s right or wrong,” William said as he decisively slammed Ruyi Jingu Bang against the head of the Silver Dragon that was on its last legs. “It only shows who’s left.”
