Chapter 610: You Can Stop Daydreaming

Lilith and Ged exchanged several blows that rang across the stadium.

Both of them had a firm grasp on each other’s fighting ability. They had already fought against each other so many times in the past, and most of their Trump Cards were known to each other.

Empress Andraste sighed as she looked at her daughter, duking it out with the handsome boy that came from their rival Empire. The Tenser Empire and the Amazon Empire weren’t really at odds at each other.

Both Empress Andraste, and Emperor Eugene of the Tenser Empire, do their best to not antagonize each other. The Emperor even joked at the Empress that he would give his blessings if Lilith were to drag Ged back to the capital of the Amazon Race.

Because of this, there was a time when Empress Andraste urged Lilith to drag Ged back to their Empire, but the latter refused it. The Amazon Princess would always say that Ged was not fit to become a mate of any of their warriors because he was a softie.

In truth, Empress Andraste didn’t know if Lilith and Ged had the possibility of being a couple. The two of them would always bicker, and fight, but their battles were not a fight to the death.

The Amazon Empress felt like Lilith was only using Ged as a reserve candidate, just in case she didn’t find a man that matched her taste. Truth be told, she had a feeling that Ged just treated her daughter as a naughty little sister, who was at loggerheads with her older brother.

‘Well, if it is meant to be then it is meant to be,’ Empress Andraste thought as she leaned back on her chair. ‘Maybe I should just kidnap the boy and bring him back to our Empire by force. Let’s see if my daughter will react then.’

As the Amazon Empress was busy concocting a kidnapping plan in her head, the battle in the arena was starting to heat up.

“The Amazon Princess is living up to her reputation,” Evexius said softly beside Emperor Leonidas. “Prince Ged has also improved a lot. I think he is now stronger than Prince Jason. If the two of them meet in the finals, our Prince would have a hard time if he fought him in close combat.”

Emperor Leonidas nodded his head. Currently, the remaining participants-who had not been eliminated-in the tournament were the strongest members of the young generation. Anyone of them could become the champion.

While it is true that Prince Ged was stronger than Prince Jason when it came to physical prowess, the Prince of the Kraetor Empire relies more on technique and strategy to get what he wants.

After five-full minutes of non-stop attack and defense, the two fighters pulled back at the same time.

“You’ve improved quite a bit, Lilith,” Ged praised.

“And you didn’t.” Lilith chuckled. “Looks like you are destined to become my servant for a month. I’ve missed your cooking, make sure to not disappoint me later.”

“You can stop daydreaming.”

“Me? Daydreaming? What a joke. I want to eat steak tonight, medium rare is best.”

Ged didn’t answer. Instead, he lowered his double handed sword, with its tip pointing towards the ground in front of him.

When Lilith saw this, the smile on her face disappeared and was replaced with a serious expression. She knew that Ged was now about to get serious, and the play time was over.

The Amazon Princess tapped her round shield twice with her sword. Sharp blades protruded at the corners of her shield, which could easily cut flesh like a sword. The short sword in her hand glowed golden as light particles emitted from her body.

“It has been a while since I’ve seen the Dance of the Fireflies,” Ged said softly. “Let’s end this properly, Lilith.”

The Amazon Princess took a fighting stance as she prepared to strike. The two fighters faced each other as if they had agreed beforehand to end this battle with their next attack.

The audience held their breaths, as they waited for the outcome of the match.

Without any warning, both fighters disappeared from where they stood. A few seconds later, a blinding light erupted at the center of the arena, forcing most of the spectators to cover their eyes.

Empress Andraste’s gaze didn’t leave the two fighters. After seeing the result of the clash, her hand clenched into a fist.

‘You underestimated your opponent, Lilith,’ Empress Andraste sighed.

The other veterans shared her opinion. They were the ones that weren’t fazed by the brilliant light that surrounded both fighters.

Ged’s sword had pierced through Lilith’s right shoulder, which made the Amazon’s face tighten. Her sword had also fallen on the ground, and with the condition of her arm, it would be impossible for her to pick it back.

“Looks like this is the end,” Ged commented.

“Yeah,” Lilith agreed. “It’s my win.”

Lilith’s bladed round shield was pressed on Ged’s neck. A trickle of blood had already stained its blade. If the Amazon Princess was to push it a little more, the young man’s neck would have a large gush in the next second.

Ged pulled back and released the grip on his sword. Just like Lilith had said, it was indeed her win. The Amazon Princess had incredible flexibility, which enabled her to twist her body at the last second, preventing a lethal injury. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“I concede, you are the victor of this match.”

“Okay, that’s now 128 wins and 127 losses. Remember, prepare my steak tonight. I want medium rare.”

“…”

The Clerics rushed up to the arena and deftly pulled out the sword on Lilith’s shoulder. They then healed their injury and gave her a few potions to drink to increase her speed of recovery.

Emperor Leonidas applauded, and the rest followed suit. Deep inside, he was feeling depressed. Truth be told, he wanted William to participate in the tournament.

He had seen him fight alongside with his army, but it wasn’t enough to assess his overall strength. It was quite unfortunate that the Half-Elf had to leave the Kraetor Empire because of their Patron God’s quest.

The Emperor knew why Prince Jason joined the tournament and what he would wish for if he won. Frankly, Emperor Leonidas had already thought of his answer if his grandson were to wish for what he had in mind.

For now, he tossed the idea at the side of his head. In order for that to happen, Prince Jason must win first.

‘I’ll cross that bridge when I get there,’ Emperor Leonidas mused as his gaze landed on his granddaughter who was seated in the VIP seats reserved for their family.

He had received several marriage requests for Princess Sidonie, not only in the Kraetor Empire, but in the surrounding Empires as well. However, he rejected them all. His granddaughter had already made up her mind, but the Emperor didn’t know if this was the best for her.

Emperor Leonidas was planning to use the tournament to know if William was truly a capable person. Sadly, he wouldn’t be able to see the aces hidden in the Half-Elf’s sleeves.

Aces that he was quite interested to see.
