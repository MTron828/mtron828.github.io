Chapter 288: The Power Of The Jack Of All Trades [Part 1]

Lightning and thunder roared in fury as Stormcaller charged towards the Astral Worm in a straight line.

The Astral Worm was a demonic creature and had a distinct weakness against the lightning element. Even so, it didn’t decrease its speed and faced the spear head-on.

“Your resistance is futile,” the Astral Worm said via telepathy. The disdain in its voice echoed throughout William’s Sea of Consciousness as it looked down on William’s last struggle. “I’ve already devoured the souls of more than fifty powerful people in my lifetime, and I have also absorbed their powers. You will suffer the same fate, so just submit and allow me to devour your soul!”

A protective barrier covered the Astral Worm’s body as it collided with Stormcaller.

William gritted his teeth as he urged Stormcaller to pierce through the Worm’s barrier, but it was to no avail. The faceoff lasted for a full minute, before the power behind the spear’s charge dissipated, the Worm lashed out its tail and sent it flying towards the East side of William’s Sea of Consciousness.

It then charged-full speed at William in order to devour him once and for all.

“Soleil, come forth!” William pleaded.

The ring transformed into a golden spear and stood in front of William. The red headed boy held the spear and channeled his aura into it.

“Go!” William ordered.

Soleil flew towards the East where Stormcaller was sent by the Astral Worm’s attack, leaving William behind.

When the Astral Worm was only ten meters away from William, the boy activated Soleil’s special ability and instantly teleported to where the spear was.

The Worm’s jaws slammed down on the location where William kneeled a few seconds ago and chewed aggressively. Tasting nothing inside its mouth, it then turned its head to look towards the East and saw the boy grasping the golden spear for dear life as it sped off into the distance.

“Resistance is futile!” the Astral Worm roared and lunged towards the East.

In a span of a few seconds, it had already closed the gap by half as it used another ability that it had taken from one of its previous victims.

The Astral Worm had activated a skill called “Windrider” that allowed it to fly in the air with short, powerful bursts. Its eyes locked on William, making sure that he wouldn’t be able to escape its sights.

Suddenly, the weapons that were embedded in William’s consciousness flew into the air and attacked the Worm.

William was using every trick he had, but the Centennial Ranked Worm didn’t bat an eye and just used its magic barrier to repel the attacks from the weapons.

“Intent fusion!” William said softly as his body glowed. This was the second stage of his Weapon Intent which allowed him to merge with his weapons.

Soleil’s body blazed as it curved sideways to attack the Astral Worm that was hell bent on catching it.

[ Merging… Failed. ]

Two rays of light, one dark, one golden, zigzagged across William’s Sea of Consciousness. Everytime the two beams of light intersected, cracks would appear in the sky.

The sea below the two combatants churned as if it was boiling, heralding that the end of the world was at hand.

The Astral Worm was impressed by William’s willpower, but it knew that it was only a matter of time before the boy burned out the remaining power in his soul. The destruction that was happening around them was proof that William was nearing his limit.

Deep inside, the Soul Devouring Worm was happily anticipating the moment when William’s soul power would run out. When that happened, the new vessel that it had dreamed about would finally fall into its hands.

-

The four Gods that were watching William from the Temple of Ten Thousand Gods had grim expressions on their faces. They watched helplessly as William fought with his life on the line, but they also knew that it was all for naught.

Gavin clenched his fist as he watched one of his two followers about to meet his end by the jaws of the Astral Worm. After watching for half a minute, the God of All Trades unclenched his hands as he made his decision.

Power gathered in Gavin’s body as he locked onto the Divinity that he had given William many years ago. Lily, Issei, and David looked at him with serious expressions, but they didn’t do anything to stop him.

What Gavin was attempting to do was to forcefully possess William’s body using the power of the God Contract. This act allowed the believers of the Gods to use their powers for a short period of time.

However, doing this was not advised if the God’s follower was in a severely weakened state like William. If Gavin made a mistake, he would shatter William’s Soul the moment he descended into the Half-Elf’s Sea of Consciousness.

“God…,” Gavin said with determination. “Descent!”

-

“Gwark!” William’s blood spurted out of his mouth as his soul’s connection with Soleil disengaged.

He wasn’t able to endure the last clash between himself and the Astral Worm which dispelled the effect of his “Intent Fusion.”

William’s body fell helplessly from the sky and the Astral Worm didn’t waste any time and immediately rushed towards him.

“Hahahaha!” the Astral Worm roared in laughter. It then opened its jaws to devour William’s soul. “It’s over Half-Elf! Your soul is mine!”

“Not on my watch!”

A booming voice slammed down on the Astral Worm’s consciousness which made it flinch in pain, momentarily stopping its charge towards William.

Suddenly, a golden beam shot down from the heavens and covered William in a radiant light.

[ Merging… Failed. ]

[ Merging… Failed. ]

[ Merging… Failed. ]

William’s eyes widened in shock as he saw a familiar figure standing before him.

Gavin, his Patron God, stood with his hands behind his back and a sorrowful look on his face.

“Will, do you want to experience the power of the ‘Jack of All Trades’ before you once again cross into the afterlife?” Gavin asked.

Gavin and William both knew that he couldn’t be saved anymore. The damage to his soul had already started and Gavin’s descent made its demise even faster.

During William’s and Celine’s training, the Half-Elf had died many times within his Sea of Consciousness. However, he still revived because it took a very powerful attack to destroy a soul.

Unfortunately, his opponent this time specialized in “devouring” souls. There wouldn’t be a second chance once the Astral Worm had eaten its prey. All that waited for the soul that got devoured was a slow and painful absorption.

The Astral Worm would then acquire that soul’s powers and become stronger. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Gavin’s descent was not done the proper way. It was a forceful possession that disregarded the will of the follower that had chosen him as their Patron God. However, Gavin would rather personally escort William’s soul back to the afterlife, than have it devoured by the Astral Worm and be used as its nourishment.

William smiled and nodded his head. “I’m sorry, Gavin. I tried. Unfortunately, this is as far as I can go.”

“I know.” Gavin nodded.

“I’m sorry.”

“It’s fine. I pray that you will have a better life after you reincarnate.”

[ Merging… Failed. ]

[ Merging… Failed. ]

“Let me experience it once,” William said softly. “The power of the Jack of All Trades.”

“As you wish,” Gavin replied with a sad smile.

He then pressed his palm against William’s head and channeled his divinity.

“System Force Override,” Gavin ordered. “Forcefully upgrade all Job Classes!”

Great power surged over William’s soul as Gavin’s Divinity empowered his entire being.

“Go… Will,” Gavin said softly. “Crush this worm and make sure that it will never hurt anyone again from this day onward.”

Gavin turned into particles of light as he returned to the Temple of Ten Thousand Gods.

-

When the blinding light receded, the Astral Worm glared in William’s direction. A sphere of light glowed in the sky like a miniature sun.

Soon, the light faded and William appeared wearing a golden suit of armor. The Half-Elf was wearing a winged circlet, and holding a spear in each hand, namely, Stormcaller, and Soleil. On his back, several tendrils of light that were similar to a golden “Aurora Borealis”, fluttered like a cape.

William stared at the Astral Worm with a calm expression on his face. The “Giant” that seemed to be undefeatable a while ago, now looked like a little worm that he could crush if he were to simply step on it.

“Lightning God War Art, Twelfth form,” William said as he raised Stormcaller and Soleil at the same time with the intention to strike. “Strike with precision, Gungnir!”

William threw both spears towards the Astral Worm.

Fire and lightning criss-crossed across the skies with a vengeance.

The Astral Worm instinctively knew that it wouldn’t survive if he got hit by the two spears that filled it with dread. It immediately moved to the side in order to evade, but it was all for naught.

“Your resistance is futile,” William muttered as he gazed at his adversary’s last struggle. “You can’t fight the inevitable.”

Soon a scream filled with fear and pain echoed within William’s Sea of Consciousness. It was only the start of the Astral Worm’s suffering, for William intended to kill it countless times, until its soul ceased to exist.
