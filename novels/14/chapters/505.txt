Chapter 505: The Darkest Places In Hell [Part 1]

‘I will give you a little reward for this victory,’ Malacai said through the scepter in his hand. ‘Since your current state is still unstable, I will allow you to spare the Elven Women. You will need a constant supply of blood, right? The blood of the Elves is rich in Magic and Spirit Power. It will allow you to regain your strength sooner.’

William nodded his head and told his Legion through telepathy to focus on killing the men and spare the women for the time being.

Frankly, he didn’t want to drink the blood of his lovers, so this alternative was fine too. The thought of sinking his fangs on their tender bodies, and drinking their blood had already crossed his mind. But, right now, he wasn’t confident that he would be able to stop once he started.

He was afraid that he would suck them dry if he got lost in his blood thirst. For the time being, he needed to get used to drinking blood, and controlling his urges first.

Soon, the millions of Elves that had invaded the Southern Continent shrank to only tens of thousands.

All of which were women that William had spared for the time being. Skyla, who had not participated in the war against the Elves, stood indifferently on top of the Hellan Royal Palace. Secretly it was relieved that William didn’t go through with a full extermination and allowed the women to live.

Although a tens of thousands was nothing compared to several million, it was still better than mere hundreds.

The Elven women cowered in a corner as their comrades, who had been turned into undead, looked back at them with blank stares.

William raised his staff and the millions of undead Elves vanished from where they stood. They were sent directly to Avalon where they would stay for eternity. The next time they would leave that place was when Malacai emerged from his prison.

That wouldn’t be happening for a few more years, and William no longer needed to think about the consequences that the Dracolich would bring to the land. The two of them had made a bet, and William barely won that bet.

Once Malacai had been freed from his shackles, the Dracolich wouldn’t antagonize William or any of those who were important to him. And for that price, William had almost lost his humanity and his life.

The defeated Guardians looked on helplessly at the remaining survivors who seemed to be on the edge of losing their sanity. Ezkalor sighed as he closed his eyes. This was not the ending that he had envisioned, and the current circumstances left him helpless.

Half of the Dragons had been reanimated and turned into Zombie Dragons. The remaining half, now cowered behind Ezkalor in the hope that their Sovereign would protect them.

The Qilins had all been wiped out, and turned into Undead Qilins. Eneru could only grit his teeth in frustration when he saw his clan members’ current forms.

Right now, he was being pinned down by Jekyll. The Taotie had long wanted to end Eneru’s life, but he couldn’t. Killing a Qilin would bring extreme bad luck to his killer, so the Taotie couldn’t kill him even if he wanted to.

As for William, the curse of the Qilins couldn’t affect him. This was why he didn’t bat an eye when he ordered his undead army to wipe them all out, except for Eneru.

The undead warriors dragged Elandorr and the Patriarch’s to William’s location. They were currently captives and were forced to kneel in front of the Half-Elf whom they referred to as a filthy Half-breed.

Naturally, William wanted to personally deal with them. However, before he could even say anything, a loud slap resounded in the air.

Elandorr’s body flew to the side as Psoglav hatefully gave him a slap on the face.

“How dare you desecrate Erchitu’s body?” Psoglav growled in anger. “How dare you do that to my friend?”

The Demonic Dog stepped on Elandorr’s leg, crushing the bones completely. The Young Elven Commander cried out in pain, but his suffering was far from over.

“My turn!” Kasogonaga stepped forward and turned into a spiky wrecking ball. “I’m Roll-“

“Oi!” Psoglav hurriedly grabbed the spikes of the rainbow-colored Anteater, before Kasogonaga could start rolling. “Idiot! If you roll now, wouldn’t he turn into meat paste? How can we torture him if you kill him quickly? We have to avenge Erchitu’s death!”

Kasogonaga undid his transformation because he realized that the Demonic Dog was right. The Anteater hatefully stepped forward before it slapped Elandorr’s other cheek with its little paw.

“You scum! You’re lucky that I was reminded not to kill you right away!” Kasogonaga shouted as he angrily stepped on Elandorr’s forehead. “I will make sure you die slowly after killing Erchitu!”

Elandorr wanted to scream that he wasn’t the one that killed Erchitu, but Psoglav had already used a spell on his body to prevent him from speaking. It then suffered Kasogonaga’s one-sided cursing, and slapping.

William had promised Psoglav that he would give Elandorr to him. Although he had hated the Elf for what he did to Erchitu’s corpse, the Giant Ox was now very much alive-rather dead-but still alive in a way.

Since he couldn’t touch Elandorr, William then focused his attention on the Patriarch’s of the Elven Clans.

They were the ringleaders of the Elven Invasion, so William didn’t plan to go easy on them. He would make sure that none of the Elves would dare attempt to invade the Human lands a second time.

“Do you know your sin?” William asked the Patriarchs who had been forced to kneel before him.

“Yes,” the Patriarch of the Rhys clan replied in a defeated voice. “It was a mistake coming here to the Southern Lands.”

The other Patriarchs’ except Shafel bowed in apology in an effort to pacify William’s anger.

“Fools. It’s too late to ask for forgiveness,” Shafel snorted. “Do you think he will spare your lives just because you apologized? All of you are already this old, and yet you still cling desperately to life? Pathetic!”

“Shut up!” the Patriarch of the Saleh Clan shouted. “You are the mastermind of this expedition! You bribed us to join you in this endeavor. The fault lies in you!”

“That’s right!” The Patriarch of the Nasir Clan supported his friend’s claim. “This is all your fault. If you didn’t threaten us back then, we wouldn’t have joined you!”

The other Patriarchs also spoke up and blamed Shafel. They even teamed up and painted the Ex-Patriarch of the Gilwen Clan as the supreme traitor of the Elven Race.

William watched this farce with amusement. Seeing all the heads of the different clans blame Shafel, made the old man’s face turn red in anger.

“I see, so this is all your fault,” William nodded as he stared at Shafel. “If not for you then all of this wouldn’t have happened.”

“That’s right! It is his fault!” The Patriarch of the Eroan Clan immediately supported William’s claim. “Lord William, please, allow me to atone for my mistake by killing this traitorous Elf with my own hands.”

“No! Lord William, please, allow me to kill him!”

“No! I will kill him!”

The Patriarchs’ raised their voice and fought for the chance to prove to William that they were innocent, by killing Shafel.

William just nodded in understanding, as he listened to their pleas.

“Very well, I will give you all a chance to atone,” William said with a smile.

“The Saintess’ son is wise, and merciful.” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“Truly the son of a hero.”

“The Nasir Clan will forever remember this favor. Once you visit your mother on the Silvermoon Continent, we will give you the grandest of welco-argh!”

A blade pierced through the Patriarch of the Nasir’s Clan’s chest, which prevented him from finishing his words.

The old man looked at the blade that pierced his chest in disbelief before falling headfirst to the ground, dead.

Shafel spat on the dead Elf’s body before laughing out loud. He knew that William had no intention of sparing any of them, so asking for forgiveness never crossed his mind.

He was indeed the Mastermind behind this invasion, and had already accepted his fate. His only regret was that the Guardians of the Silvermoon Continent didn’t get the opportunity to kill the Filthy Half-Breed before everything was too late.
