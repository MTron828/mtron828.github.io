Chapter 465: Men’s Intuition

The Grand Archmage of the Kraetor Empire, Evexius, looked at the list that was given to him by the elves, along with the ring that contained the items that they had brought beforehand.

The ones written on the list were rare resources that could only be found on the Silvermoon Continent, and the Grand Archmage had to admit that the Elves had given them an offer that was very hard to refuse.

Naturally, since it was just written on a piece of paper, it held no value whatsoever. However, if the Elves were to really prepare and send them the things that they had written on the list then the Kraetor Empire definitely profited from this exchange.

The Young Empress didn’t even bother to look at the Elves’ offer because she was confident that the Grand Archmage would be a better judge than her when it came to valuable resources. She might be smart, but being smart didn’t mean that she was a walking encyclopedia who knew everything about the world.

Empress Sidonie was more than happy to use the resources and manpower in her disposal to get what she wanted. Since there were people more capable than her in appraising things, she would just let them handle what they were good at.

Besides, regardless of what the Elves’ presented, her decision wouldn’t change.

“This offer is good,” Evexius said as he faced the Elven Delegation. “But since it is just written on a piece of paper, I cannot estimate its true value. However, since the elves are an honorable race, I take it that you will adhere to sending the resources that you have listed here?”

Evexius dangled the scroll in front of the Elves to determine whether they are serious or not.

“By my honor, I swear that the items on the list will be delivered as soon as our reinforcements from the Silvermoon Continent arrive,” Elandorr stated.

The things that were listed down on the scroll were items that belonged to Alessio’s branch of the Organization that was stationed in the Silvermoon Continent. It was a loan that would be paid in full by Elandorr’s and the other Clan’s Patriarch’s, once their forces had stepped on the Southern Lands.

Empress Sidonie nodded in acknowledgement of Elandorr’s vow which made the Elven Commander give her a nod of appreciation.

[ This handsome Elf is trying to butter you up, Sidonie. ]

‘Well, he’s not half bad.’

[ True. ]

After the meeting with the Elven Delegation ended, they were asked to return to their lodging to wait for the Young Empress’ final decision. She had already told her guests a day ago that she would meet them separately.

This way, no haggling would take place. Empress Sidonie had made it clear that she would only give them one chance to convince her. If they failed to do that, there would be no second chances.

Five minutes after the Elves left the throne room, William walked in accompanied by two guards.

The Half-Elf had a dazzling smile on his face as if he had eaten something good for breakfast. Morgana’s smile widened inside her and Sidonie’s mindscape as she looked at the handsome teenager who made her night extra special.

“Did Sir William have a good rest?” Empress Sidonie asked with a sweet smile.

Evexius, Prince Jason, Prince Lionel, Priscilla, and the other officers of the Kraetor Empire noticed the Young Empress’ subtle show of favoritism towards the Half-Elf who had come from the Hellan Kingdom. However, even though they had varied thoughts about it, none of them were voiced out loud.

They just looked at the red-headed boy and waited for whatever he had to say.

“Yes, Your Majesty,” William replied. “The accommodations you gave me were very comfortable and the food was to my liking. Thank you for your hospitality and generosity.”

“No need to thank me. This is what I should do as host.” Empress Sidonie leaned on her throne as she crossed her leg over the other. “Making my guests suffer would be disrespectful to the hardships that they had to encounter by traveling long distances just to see me.

“Now, Sir William, I would like to hear your offer for an alliance. I would greatly appreciate it if you don’t mention about giving me your baby again. I can let it slide once due to our past friendship, however, I will not be lenient a second time.”

The hidden warning in Empress Sidonie’s words was enough to tell William that she didn’t want others to know about her embarrassing past. Naturally, William also understood that it would be tasteless to repeat the same lines that he had said a day ago.

“This is a list that I have prepared for today’s negotiation,” William said as he took a scroll from his storage ring.

Evexius raised his hand and the scroll in William’s hand flew in his direction. The Grand Archmage of the Kraetor Empire looked at the things written on it, and a look of surprise spread across his face.

“Are you for real?” Evexius asked in disbelief. “Are the things written here true?” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

William nodded his head. “Yes.”

Empress Sidonie became curious about what was written on the scroll, so she made a gesture for the Grand Archmage to hand it over to her.

Soon, the same dumbfounded expression appeared on the Young Empress’ face. Although she was not too familiar with rare resources, the ones listed on the scroll were quite familiar to her.

What William listed on the scroll were the locations of undiscovered mines that the Anaesha Dynasty hadn’t unearthed for hundreds of years. What was more incredible was that William had even added the size of the mines and even the maximum amount that they could gather that numbered in tons.

Silver mines, gold mines, magic crystal mines, spirit crystal mines, precious gems, and even tons of rare metals that were used for weapons and armors.

William had even added a mithril mine at the end of the list. Although the quantity wasn’t much, they would still be able to mine half a ton of one of the rarest metals in the world.

Although mining was hard labor, Empress Sidonie didn’t lack Worker Ants that could mine these resources faster than any Humans could.

The only problem was whether she and the Kraetor Empire could trust the things that were listed on the scroll that was currently in her hands.

Although the resources on the list were quite common compared to what the Elves had promised, the sheer quantity of the items was more than enough to make William’s offer more appealing to them.

“Sir William, this is very impressive.” Empress Sidonie smiled. “But…”

“But, you don’t believe me.” William finished Sidonie’s words for her. “Well, this can be easily solved if you use your… manpower to see whether I am lying or not.”

“And, what if I sent my Worker Ants and find nothing in these locations?”

“Then you can imprison, and torture, me for lying.”

William’s fearless stance made the Young Empress and the Grand Archmage feel that he wasn’t bluffing.

“Let’s say that I believe you.” Empress Sidonie compromised as she looked at her beloved in a new light. “How were you able to find the location of these resources? Don’t tell me you sniffed them off the ground?”

“Of course not,” William replied.

“Then how?”

“Men’s Intuition.”

Prince Jason, Prince Lionel, as well as the other young officers of the Kraetor Empire were very tempted to drown William in spit. If Men’s Intuition was enough to find Gold Mines and Mithril Mines then all of the men in the world would be swimming in gold coins.

“Your Majesty, it would be faster to send your Worker Ants to investigate,” William proposed. “Although it will take them a few days to reach the nearest gold mine, all your doubts will be cleared up by then.”

Empress Sidonie reluctantly nodded her head. Right now, no one could prove whether he was lying or not. However, if the Half-Elf was telling the truth then the winner of this negotiation would be none other than him.

“You can return to your quarters for now, Sir William,” Empress Sidonie stated. “We will have a meeting to discuss which of the offers would be more advantageous to the Kraetor Empire. When we finally made our decision, we will call for you as well as the Elven Delegation to give our verdict.”

“Understood, Your Majesty,” William gave the Empress a brief bow before turning around to return to his room.

The two guards that had accompanied him in the throne room, followed behind him to ensure that the red-headed boy wouldn’t wander anywhere in the palace.

William had a smile on his face as he walked towards his temporary residence. Thanks to his Divide and Conquer strategy that was meant to look for traces of the Teleportation Gate of the Kraetor Army, he was also able to find undiscovered mines along the way.

What the Half-Elf didn’t tell Empress Sidonie was that the resources included on the list were just a fraction of the treasures that the System had located as the members of William’s Legion scoured the territory of the Anaesha Dynasty.

B1 and B2 had even flown over a small Adamantium Mine that William had planned to keep for himself. Since these resources didn’t come out of his own pocket, he didn’t mind using them as bargaining chips in his negotiation with the beautiful Empress.

What William didn’t know was that right after he left, a heated debate immediately broke out in the throne room. Empress Sidonie had already alerted the Ant Queen about the locations of resources that were written inside William’s scroll.

‘Just how did he do it?’ Empress Sidonie asked Morgana who seemed to be preoccupied by her own thoughts. Right now, she was in her own quarters and sitting on top of her bed. She had left the throne room earlier because it had become too noisy for her to concentrate.

[ Does it matter? Even if it’s true, so what? Our decision will remain the same, right? ]

Empress Sidonie nodded. Her other half was right. Now that they had come this far, it was time to execute the plan that they had in mind.

“Sorry, Sir William,” Empress Sidonie muttered as she gazed at the scroll in her hand.

She then affectionately caressed William’s handwriting as if it was a priceless treasure that she had won in an auction. “All is fair in love and war. In the end, I will be the one who will have the last laugh.”

Morgana nodded her head, because she believed this as well.

Somewhere in the Temple of the Ten Thousand Gods, a sensual Goddess chuckled happily. She was looking forward to how the Romance between the three Kingdoms would play out. Naturally, her bet would be on her followers.

After all, blood is thicker than water.
