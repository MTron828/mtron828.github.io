Chapter 458: If Worse Comes To Worst, I’ll Just Give Her My Babies

“We can’t do that.” William shook his head firmly.

“Why not?” Kasogonaga tapped its small foot on the ground. “It’s the perfect plan.”

The beautiful Elf, who was seated beside William, nodded her head in agreement with Kasogonaga’s plan.

“I also think this is a good plan,” Celine said with a smile. “As long as Kasogonaga captures the Myriad Ant Queen, that young Empress would be willing to compromise.”

“No, Master,” William once again shook his head. “If we do that, we will lose any chance of reaching an agreement with her. Also, that will not make us any different from The Organization who tried to kidnap Big Brother Matthew and Eve, in an attempt to use them as leverage. I don’t approve of this plan.” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

The three were currently having a casual meeting in the Thousand Beast Domain while William made healing potions using the herbs that were gathered inside the Dungeon of Atlantis and the sap of the Dragon Blood Tree.

While William busied himself in dividing the mixture into several bottle containers, Kasogonaga once again proposed something.

“Then let’s just ally with them and crush the Elves together,” Kasogonaga proposed. “This is a good alternative, no?”

William nodded his head. This was why he had decided to travel to the Anaesha Dynasty to talk with Empress Sidonie. Right now, they had just landed on the ground to take a short break.

After eating their lunch, William ordered Dave and Lionheart to rest for three hours before they continued their journey. It was not easy to take long journeys, even when one was flying in the sky.

While Dave and his Beast Companion, Lionheart, rested, William returned to the Thousand Beast Domain to craft potions. Est, Ashe, Wendy, Isaac, and Conrad returned to clearing the Dungeon, while Celine decided to check on how good William was in doing Alchemy.

Kasogonaga saw the two near the Dragon Blood Trees, so it decided to have a short chat with them to pass the time.

However, due to the purpose of their journey, the small chat transformed into a strategy meeting with Kasogonaga proposing that they kidnap the Myriad Ant Queen and use it as a hostage to force Empress Sidonie to cooperate.

William knew that the Kasogonaga was only half serious in planning to kidnap the Ant Queen. What it really wanted to do was to eat the Ant Queen, so that it could increase its rank in the fastest way possible.

“How long before we arrive at the City of Veritas?” Celine inquired.

“If we continue our pace, it will take us three more days,” William replied as he once again threw the herbs inside the Yin Yang Cauldron to make another batch of healing potions.

Celine nodded her head as she watched William use the Flames of Purification to start his Alchemy.

“Will, do you have some kind of plan to convince Empress Sidonie to join our side?”

“I don’t have any concrete plans in mind. If worse comes to worst, I’ll just give her my babies.”

“”Huh?!””

Celine and Kasogonaga both looked at William with dumbfounded expressions on their faces. They didn’t understand what the red-headed boy meant when he said that he would give the Empress his babies.

“I’m just joking.” William chuckled as he controlled the power of his flames. “To be honest, I don’t know what kind of reception we will get from the Empress. I just hope she doesn’t hold a grudge against me because of what I said before the two of us parted.”

“What did you two talked about?” Kasogonaga inquired.

It had seen the Princess before she became an Empress. Kasogonaga was a deity that once stood on the side of Humans during the Era of the Gods. Because of this, it had learned a few things from the Humans and among them was forming good relationships with each other.

“She wanted to know what Love is,” William replied. “I said, I cannot give her what she wanted.”

The image of the beautiful Princess flashed inside his head. He could still remember how Princess Sidonie looked at him with a pleading gaze, and yet, he chose to turn her down because he felt that he couldn’t return her feelings.

“Eh? Isn’t love just Mating?” Kasogonaga tilted its head to the side. “You Humans procreate all the time. What’s the big deal about making her your partner? Ah, I keep forgetting that you are a Half-Elf. Still, didn’t the Human part of you feel anything about her? Based on Human standards, she’s quite beautiful, right?”

Celine who was just quietly listening to the side eyed William with a calm expression. She had already found out that, aside from Wendy, Ashe and Est were also her Disciple’s lovers.

The beautiful Elf was also shocked when she found out that William’s first friends were not real boys, but girls who had been cursed by a Goddess.

When William showed Celine the gem embedded in his chest, as well as the story behind it, her impression of Ashe grew by a good margin. She had heard that when Mermaids give someone half of their heart, it meant that they had chosen that person to be their partner for life.

Although the circumstances behind it were complicated, it didn’t change the fact that Ashe didn’t hesitate to save William during his time of need. This was more than enough for Celine to approve of her as her Disciple’s lover.

To be honest, Celine felt that William was growing too fast. Not only in strength, but his outlook toward life as well.

‘A baby bird can’t stay in its parent’s nest for the rest of its life,’ Celine thought. Somehow, she felt a little sad because she felt that William was moving farther away from her.

Perhaps, in the next few years, the boy would go on an adventure, where he would be away for several years before they saw each other again.

‘This is the natural order of things.’ Celine sighed, but there was nothing she could do about it. ‘This is how it should be.’

She had one last lesson to teach William, but that would have to wait until he had come of age. After that, Celine would leave Lont, and go to the Demon Continent to visit her Master. It had been many years since she last saw her and Celine missed her terribly.

Celine’s mother had died when she was still very young. The one who played the role of her mother was none other than the notorious Ugly Hag that lived in the most seclusive region of the Demonic Lands.

The only reason why Celine had postponed her trip was due to her having a Disciple of her own. She would not leave William until he had come of age, and imparted to him the secrets of those who wield True Dark Magic.

‘For that to happen, he needed to survive the war first,’ Celine mused.

William and Conner had made a temporary alliance in order to fight against the Elven Army. Conner would be responsible for strengthening the defenses of the kingdom in preparation for war, while William would look for other potential allies to help them resist the Elven Invasion.

The red-headed boy had already informed Conner about his mission to visit the Anaesha Dynasty and the latter only gave him a smile as if he had already expected that William would do this.

Conner had already established in his mind that William and Empress Sidonie were in cahoots with each other, and simply kept this a secret in order to fool him and the Elven Army. Calum agreed with him on this point, but decided to not expose his secret.

The Leader of Deus believed that even if the Kraetor Empire didn’t extend their hands to help them vanquish the Elves, they wouldn’t attack the Hellan Kingdom either.

This was the reason why Conner was adamant about making William his ally. As long as the red-headed boy was on his side, he could focus all of his attention in the faceoff against the Elves.

Although the two Guardian Beasts were powerful, they were not invincible. As long as there was a chance, Conner would seize it with both hands. Just like he did many years ago when he became the Leader of Deus in the Southern Continent.
