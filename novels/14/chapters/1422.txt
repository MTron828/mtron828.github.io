The three adorable girls walked happily in the aisle as they threw flowers all around them.

Eve, Medusa, and Cherry, smiled brightly as they showed off their pink, fluttery dresses that brought out their cuteness, making the Lolicon God give a thumbs up from the Heavens.

If Erinys was with them, everyone might have vomited sugar, due to the sweetness overload that they were already witnessing.

William's breath was almost blown away, as he looked further behind the three girls, seeing the women that he was going to marry today.

Dressed in white wedding dresses, his wives walked behind the three flower girls, alongside their family members.

Wendy, William's first wife, was escorted by her father, Joaquin Cy Armstrong. The current Duke of the Armstrong Duchy.

Estelle, was escorted by her father, King Noah, who was the King of the Hellan Kingdom.

Ashe was escorted by her father, whom William hadn't had the chance to meet in the past. He went by the name, Hywell, and the Half-Elf could tell how much Hywell cared for his daughter from the way He was glaring at him.

'I'll talk to him at the reception later,' William thought as he endured his father-in-law's glare with grace.

Chiffon was being escorted by King Eldon, who was already teary-eyed due to the overwhelming emotion he was feeling at the moment. He made sure to create the best dwarven wedding gown for his granddaughter, which brought out her natural charm, making all the dwarven boys present at the wedding curse William in their hearts.

Princess Sidonie was escorted by her father, Redmond Val Freesia, who ruled the Kingdom of Freesia in the Southern Continent. He had already heard of William's exploits, and looked forward to having a nice long chat with him after the wedding ceremony was over.

Lilith, who was wearing the Amazonian Bridal Gown was being escorted by none other than Empress Andraste, whose smile reached her ears. Although she didn't get the chance to kidnap William, and have him become the studhorse of her Empire, she was still happy that her daughter found happiness with him.

Princess Aila, was escorted by her brother, Alaric Sol Zelan, who was the current King of the Zelan Dynasty. Even now, he still couldn't imagine that his distant cousin, and the person who saved his sister from being wed several years ago, would one day marry her as well.

When Acedia made her appearance, everyone almost couldn't believe their eyes.

The Elf lady was being carried on a stretcher, which made the corner of William's lips twitch.

'You're even too lazy to walk down the aisle on your wedding day?' William couldn't help but shake his head helplessly due to Acedia being true to her nature.Visjt nùíêvelbin(.)cùíêm for new updates

The Elf lady was being carried by four other Elf ladies, who treated her like a queen, despite the fact that there was drool staining the side of her lips.

Perhaps, the weirdest of them all was Cathy.

Since she was composed of seven people, there were several men who were awkwardly walking beside her.

Vesta's father, Joash, the Black Dragon, who was also a Demigod, walked with grace despite the weird gazes that were being shot in his direction.

Another man, who was wearing a tattered cloak, was also walking beside Cathy, whose very presence made everyone feel as if they were staring Death in the face.

As the group of eight passed by, their gazes then landed on Belle, who was being escorted by her father, Raymond.

When they reached the Altar, all of them lined up side by side, with Wendy, and Belle, at the very center, standing directly behind William.

Even Acedia, who had been lying on the stretcher, reluctantly stood up, as she used her hair to prop herself up in a standing position.

All the people who had come to attend the wedding, looked at these young ladies, with mixed emotions.

Some felt happy for them.

Some envied them.

Some wished they were them.

While others cursed William non-stop for having a harem of beautiful women.

Each of them were beautiful in their own right, which was more than enough to tell everyone how capable the Half-Elf was for making these ladies love him.

It was at that moment, when a veiled Priestess walked to the Altar and faced William and his wives.

"Today is a glorious day, so I will make an exception just this once," the veiled Priestess said in a volume that only William, and his brides could hear, as she removed the veil covering her face, making those who saw her gasp in shock. "Also, I worked hard to achieve this result, so I'm going to preside over this wedding whether you like it or not."

William, Wendy, Chiffon, and Princess Aila, looked at the beautiful woman, whose face they couldn't forget.

It was none other than Freya.

The Goddess of Asgard that had tied their fates together, even though thousands of years had already passed.

As soon as the crowd quieted down, Freya smiled and began the opening words of the wedding ceremony.

"Welcome, everyone. We are gathered here today to join William Von Ainsworth, and his brides in Holy Matrimony. Therefore, should anyone present know of any reason that they should not be joined in holy matrimony, speak now or forever hold your peace"

Loxos, who was floating high above the Altar, spread her arms wide as she prepared to unleash hell upon those who dared to ruin her beloved's wedding day.

Everyone knew that those who dared to even speak a word to stop the wedding would immediately face a fate worse than death, so they glanced around, hoping to see something that would entertain them.

After waiting for a few seconds, no one spoke up, so Freya smiled and continued the wedding ceremony.

"Since no one has any objections we will now√¢‚Ç¨""

"Wait!"

A loud shout was heard at the very back of the courtyard, which made William, as well as the other Pseudo-Gods, and Demigods, look at the person who dared to court death.

However, before they could even do anything, a lady wearing a wedding gown, walked down the aisle.

She had purple hair, which was tied up in a princess braid, making the anger in William's heart dissipate.

The bride walked down the aisle with grace, as she was escorted by a beautiful woman, who wore a red dress, which fluttered like live flames as she walked beside the bride.

Behind them, a veeeeeeeeeeeery fat lady, carrying a baby in her arms, walked with a smile on her face, making Chiffon, who was standing beside the altar, almost cry out in surprise.

Beside the fat lady was another woman, who was wearing light-weight armor, and radiating a righteous vibe, which was similar to old fashioned knights, who were loyal to their lords.

Estelle, Ashe, as well as Isaac, who were in the venue, all looked at their Patron Goddess, Astrid, with surprise because they never thought that she would make an appearance.

"Boy, I tried my best to convince her, and here she is," Lyssa, the Goddess of Wrath said as she stopped at the base of the Altar. "You should have seen how much she resisted. Fortunately, we talked some sense into her, and dragged her here from the Elysian Fields. You better make her happy, or else..."

The Goddess of Wrath flashed a devilish smile to the Half-Elf, making the latter smile back.

"Thank you, Your Excellency," William replied. "I knew that I could count on you."

The Half-Elf then extended his hand towards the beautiful Elf, who had come to share this important day with him.

Celine reluctantly offered her hand, and allowed herself to be pulled towards the Altar, where William's other brides were standing side by side.

Before leaving the Underworld, William asked Thanatos to pass a message to Lyssa, who was currently with Celine in the Elysian Fields.

He knew that the Wrathful Goddess wouldn't allow her daughter to miss such a grand occasion, so he made sure to tell her to convince Celine to come to his wedding, as his bride, a month after he left the Underworld.

"You know that I don't need to marry you in order to be happy," Celine said softly as she stood at the altar. "But, since Lady Lyssa was so insistent, I decided to go along with it, so she wouldn't drag me by force."

William chuckled after hearing Celine's complaint. Even so, he knew deep inside that the Elf who had given birth to his child, also wanted to be officially declared as his wife, and that this was a step towards achieving that goal.

Freya smiled after seeing this scene.

Now that all of William's brides were finally present, she once again continued her ceremony, and this time, she went straight to the vows, not even giving the rest an opportunity to ruin the special day that she had waited thousands of years for.
