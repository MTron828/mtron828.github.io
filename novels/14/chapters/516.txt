Chapter 516: Rainbow-Colored Calamity

“Fifth Master…”

“Mmm…”

“Fifth Master…”

“Mmm…”

“A hot and sexy lady is currently waiting for you at Alchemy Hall. She said that she wants you to rock her world!”

“Mmm?!”

A man with disheveled platinum blonde hair rose from the couch. Although he looked like a mess right now, his mesmerizing gray eyes, and his angelic features were enough to make any lady swoon the moment he smiled at them.

This man’s name was Albert Antstein, The Full Kettle Alchemist.

“William, cancel all my appointments” Albert ordered as he rushed to his closet to pick an attire that would make even an old grandma blush like a teenage girl.

“Fifth Master, you don’t have any appointments scheduled today,” William said with a sigh.

Albert started to apply some light powder on his face to give him that extra youthful glow. His original age was in the late forties, but due to him being a Half-Elf, he had retained his good looks and overflowing charisma.

After making the finishing touches, he turned to look at William.

“Tell me, apprentice, how do I look?” Albert inquired.

William crossed his arms over his chest as he appraised his new Master from head to foot.

“You look awesome, Fifth Master,” William replied. “It’s just a shame that I am still more handsome than you.”

“Cheeky brat.” Albert chuckled as he walked towards the door. “Don’t worry, I’ll bring you to the red light district in two months. I’ll show you how to pick up girls in a dungeon.”

William rolled his eyes as he shooed his Master away.

If he really went to the red-light district to have some fun, his lovers would certainly beat him up, or worse, castrate him for his stupidity.

Morgana even went out of her way to call dibs on him on the night of his birthday. Although he didn’t promise her anything, he didn’t reject her either.

William knew that his Master wouldn’t be back until morning the next day, so he decided to clean up the room, so that it would look like it belonged to one of the most prestigious Alchemists in the Kraetor Empire.

Albert was the second Half-Elf that William had seen aside from Conner. Originally, William thought that Half-Elves were rare, because there were only two of them in the Southern Continent.

However, in the Central Continent, Half-Elves could be seen everywhere. Although they weren’t as common as the other races, they could still be found in almost every major city in the Central Continent.

Today was Sunday, so there were no classes at the Silverwind Academy. Princess Sidonie had come to take Ian away after breakfast, and simply told William that both of them would go shopping.

William didn’t mind because he had other matters to settle as well. It had only been four days since he had enrolled at the Silverwind Academy, and life had been a little bit difficult because of Morgana’s bold action on the day that they had transferred.

All the boys in the classroom had filed a petition for William to be kicked out from the class because they believed that he didn’t belong there. The Board Members of the Academy also didn’t like the fact that the granddaughter of the Emperor was being intimate with a foreigner that came from distant lands.

In the end, the issue was brought to the Emperor.

The ruler of the Kraetor Empire, Emperor Leonidas, listened to the Headmaster of Silverwind Academy and left the final decision in his hands.

Due to pressure from the noble families, the Headmaster reluctantly agreed to transfer William to Class-F, where the most notorious students in the Third Grade were gathered.

This decision made the students, and the Board Members, very happy.

To their surprise, Princess Sidonie accepted this outcome and even smiled at the Headmaster, when he told her that the reason for William’s transfer was due to the fact that he was a bad influence on the elite students in the Third Year Division.

However, it didn’t end there. The pompous heirs also made sure that Ian stayed in Class A instead of following William in Class-F. They didn’t want William to have an easy life in the academy.

William’s Ex-Classmates thought that without his retainer to cater to his needs, William would become helpless and show his true colors.

Ian didn’t care about their pettiness, and was determined to follow William to Class-F when the Half-Elf stopped him.

“Stay in Class A and watch over Sidonie for me.”

This was what William had told Ian while they had dinner with the Princess. The Half-Elf didn’t mind being transferred to another classroom. For him, this was even a blessing in disguise because he didn’t want the noble families to always be at odds with him.

It would also allow him to move freely, without extra pairs of eyes to watch his every move.

Although Ian was reluctant to part with him, she still agreed to his request on the condition that William didn’t cheat on them while he was in Class-F.

“Finally, this looks like a dwelling fit for a Human,” William said after looking at his handiwork.

Albert was someone that didn’t like to clean. He would just do his everyday work, until the trash piled up in his room.

When there came a time, when even he couldn’t stand the mess that he created, he would then seduce the Auntie, who was responsible for assigning maids to clean the dormitory rooms. He would whisper sweet words in her ears and take her in a night of passion, in order for her to send someone to clean his room once a month.

William’s Fifth Master, Albert, had a wide strike range. However, even though he had the ability to seduce any lady under the heavens, he still had his principles. He never targeted people who had lovers or were married.

That was his bottom line, and even William felt that his Master was a Saint compared to those playboys that he had read about in web novels.

After finishing his job, William went to his Master’s laboratory to practice his Alchemy.

Even though Albert was a skirt chaser, his skills were the real deal, and was still the most prestigious Alchemist of the Kraetor Empire.

It was William that had first approached him and asked if he was willing to teach him Alchemy. To his surprise, the Full Kettle Alchemist accepted him as his Disciple.

When William asked Albert why he agreed to his request, the latter only said that since William was a Half-Elf, and as good looking as him, it was only natural to extend a hand.

Also, he was planning to look for a Disciple as well, so the timing had been perfect. One could even say that the two shameless Half-Elves, who always called themselves handsome, were a match made in heaven.

After locking the room of the laboratory, William focused his attention on his Alchemy. He checked the notes that Albert had left him and followed the instructions that were written on him to the letter.

——

At the Bestiary of the Silverwind Academy…

A loud roar resounded in the shared Bestiary of all the Beasts that belonged to the Third Years.

A Golden Dragon towered above the other Beasts to show his dominance. This was what the Beast Handlers called the battle for the seat of Kings. Every year, only one beast would stand above the rest and reign over the other beasts that belonged to the other students.

The Golden Dragon was the Third Year’s King and had been the leader of the other monsters ever since the classes started.

Of course, the Kings were not allowed to harm any monster in the Bestiary. In return, he would be given the best accommodations, the best food, and the best services that the Academy could provide.

Garganta, the Golden Dragon, had enjoyed all of these comforts and his reign was unchallenged… until today.

In front of him stood a rainbow-colored Anteater who was eyeing him with genuine curiosity.

Garganta roared as it stood on its hindlegs to show his dominance to the newcomer.

The Beast Handlers watched this scene with amusement. Deep inside they pitied the Anteater because of its ignorance. For them, the Anteater was like a newly born calf who was unafraid of the tiger that intended to eat it whole.

Garganta slightly opened its mouth and golden flames flickered inside his mouth. It was clearly telling the Anteater to scram before it was eaten for lunch.

The Anteater didn’t budge and the Golden Dragon had finally reached the limits of its patience. It uttered a deafening roar, it was its way of issuing a challenge to the beast that dared to covet his throne.

Finally, the Anteater opened its mouth to reply to the Dragon’s challenge.

“Motherf*cker, let’s take this outside.”

Kasogonaga raised its head arrogantly before it walked outside the Bestiary. It had accepted the challenge of the Golden Dragon, and the latter followed behind the small Anteater that it could easily crush like a pancake.

Battles between beasts were allowed because only the strong could become the Sovereign of the Bestiary. As long as there were Beast Handlers present, these battles would be declared as official.

Since every Beast was an important asset, special considerations were placed in the battling arena. Similar to the Grand Coliseum in the Hellan Kingdom, the fighters would turn into particles of light if they died in battle.

As soon as the two beasts faced each other, various roars, shrieks, and cheers erupted in the surroundings. The Beasts and the Handlers had been bored as of late, so seeing a stupid rainbow-colored Anteater die under the claws of a Golden Dragon was still entertainment for them.

“Roar! Roar!” (I haven’t eaten your kind before, but you look delicious! You better surrender now, while I’m still being merciful! )

“… Motherf*cker, stop talking and start fighting!” Kasogonaga shouted with an adorable voice.

Kasogonaga spent most of its time with the Angray Birds, so it was very easy for it to pick up their habits. Its two companions, B1, and B2, taught the innocent Anteater how to curse at its enemy, and the latter quickly ingrained this knowledge in its vocabulary arsenal.

When William first heard Kasogonaga curse, the corner of the Half-Elf’s lips twitched before hurling Stormcaller at the two dumb birds who had influenced the Deity of the Sky to hurl vulgarities when it fought.

“Roooooooar!” (Ignorant Plebeian. It seems that you still don’t understand your place. Very well, I will end your pitiful life. Die!)

Garganta swung at the Anteater with its claws, but the Anteater nimbly stepped to the side, evading the Dragon’s attack.

The Dragon sneered because it thought that it was just a fluke and used its other claw to rip the Anteater into shreds.

However, Kasogonaga moved effortlessly to the side to evade Garganta’s attack.

The Handlers and the Beasts continued to cheer because they thought that the Golden Dragon was merely playing with its prey.

After evading his two attacks, Garganta finally realized that he was not fighting an ordinary Anteater.

It flapped its wings to fly as it opened its mouth to unleash a breath attack. The Golden Dragon decided to end the Anteater with its most powerful move because its opponent was making it uneasy.

“Garganta is going for an overkill.” One of the Beast Handlers shook his head because he could already foresee the ending of the duel.

“Well, this is to be expected for the King of the Third Division,” the other Beast Handler commented. “Very few Beasts can survive a Dragon’s Breath head on.”

Garganta was a Millennial Dragon at its middle stages. To make a comparison, it was weaker than Elandorr’s Silver Dragon that he had fought during their duel at the Gate of Beginnings.

Even so, a Millennial Dragon was still a force to reckon with, and only powerful beasts and warriors could face it in a battle of life and death.

Kasogonaga raised its head arrogantly as he looked at the Dragon that was high up in the sky. It then rolled up its body and grew into a two-meter wrecking ball with spikes covering its entire body.

“I’M ROLLING!”

Kasogonaga shot up towards the Dragon Breath to meet it head-on. If the Golden Dragon only knew what this small, rainbow-colored, Anteater had fought during the Era of the Gods, as well as the war in the Southern Continent, it would immediately throw in the towel to surrender.

Unfortunately, it didn’t know.

The Dragon’s Breath dispersed, and the rainbow-colored, spiked, wrecking ball continued its trajectory, until it smashed into the Golden Dragon’s open mouth.

Garganta uttered a roar of pain as the spikes pierced the soft tissue inside its mouth. However, Kasogonaga was not done yet.

“Super, Last, Final, Finishing, Ending Finale! I’m Rolling!”

The Deity of the Sky’s spinning force increased as it descended into the Golden Dragon’s throat, shredding everything in its path.

Garganta wasn’t able to cry out in pain because the Anteater had turned its insides into ground-dragon-meat. The King of the Bestiary turned into particles of light as its life ended.

That was the day when a new King reigned over the Beasts of the Third Year division, and he was given the nickname.

Rainbow-Colored, Rolling Calamity.
