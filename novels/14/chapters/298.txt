Chapter 298: First Familia Member [Part 2]

Ian didn’t answer William’s question right away. Instead, she recalled the first time she met the red-headed shepherd who just happened to be going to the same temple as them. Back then, she didn’t know why she felt irritated whenever she saw him. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

After pondering about it for a while, Ian might have become irritated when she saw the collar on William’s neck. Just like Elves, other humanoids like Beastkins, and the more exotic creatures were sold as slaves.

Ian was half Human and half Nymph. Her mother was a Mermaid, while her father was a Human mage that specialized in Earth Magic. Although such unions weren’t rare, they were frowned upon by many.

Just like the Half-Elves.

Fortunately, Ian’s and Isaac’s Nymph bloodline was stronger. They were more Nymph than Human and had the ability to take on Human form. Due to the secret relationship between the Ruling Family and the Nymphs of the Kingdom, a certain agreement was made in order to strengthen their ties with each other.

“I regret… not being able to take this collar off your neck using my own power,” Ian sighed. “You know, I hate slavery. Perhaps, I hate it more than you do. I wish that a day will come where all slave traders will be taken to the guillotine to be beheaded.

“That way, the next generation won’t have to worry about getting abducted while walking on the streets and being sold to the nobility to become their playthings. No. William. I do not regret giving you half of my heart. So, don’t make me regret my decision, understand?”

“I won’t,” William replied. “I promise.”

Ian closed her eyes and gently brushed the hair on William’s head. Five-minutes passed in silence before Ian took the initiative to break the silence.

“Is there something you want to tell me?” Ian inquired. “I can feel your hesitation through the fluctuations coming from my Spirit Core inside your body. What’s wrong?”

William sighed internally and decided to come clean. He told her about the newly awakened ability that had appeared after she had given him half of her Spirit Core.

“You want to know my True Name?” Ian was surprised, but it didn’t last long. She had thought long and hard about this topic, even before William had asked her about it. One could even say that she had already made her decision the moment she gave him half of her heart.

“Yes. May I know your True Name?”

“William, do you know? Asking for my True Name is the same as asking my hand in marriage. Are you sure you want to know?”

“I want to know,” William answered firmly. “I promise I will take responsibility. I will not let you go, no matter what happens.”

Ian felt her heart skip a beat upon hearing William’s sincere promise to keep her by his side. The beautiful mermaid lowered her head and whispered her name in William’s ears. Although it was only the two of them inside his Sea of Consciousness, her cautious nature didn’t allow her to say her True Name out loud.

“Ashera,” Ian whispered. “Ashera Dy Cordelia. With this, I now belong to you. Please, keep my name in your heart.”

“I will,” William replied. “I promise.”

The King Chess Piece appeared above the two of them. Golden particles that were similar to snowflakes fell down on the two lovers as both of the Spirit Cores within their chests turned golden.

Among Nymphs, especially the mermaid race, giving one’s heart to another person was a sign of love. Once that person made a vow of love to the mermaid, the color of the Spirit Cores would change, which signified that the two were now partners for life.

It was also a sign that the Gods had recognized their union.

William and Ian felt a stronger connection between the two of them as the King Chess Piece and the System synchronized together to register William’s First Familia Member.

“From now on, I’ll call you Ashe when it’s just the two of us, or when you are in your mermaid form,” William said. “Also, call me Will from now on, okay?”

“Ashe… it’s been so long since I heard my nickname,” Ashe replied with a smile. Deep inside, she was very happy. Although Wendy was William’s first lover and had called dibs as his First Wife, the bond that she and William shared now was that of a real husband and wife.

William also understood this, but he wouldn’t take back his word to the blonde beauty whom he promised could be his First Wife. Ashe also had no intention of making things difficult for Wendy and decided to just keep this secret in her heart.

She was already feeling a bit guilty for taking a shortcut in order to make William her partner for life.

‘Ashe, I don’t have much time left,’ William said softly.

‘I understand,’ Ashe replied as she planted a kiss on William’s forehead. “I’ll wait for your return. Please, don’t make me wait too long.”

“I will do my best. Until then, please watch over my body for me.”

“Don’t worry. I won’t let you cheat on me. See you soon, Will.”

The glow of the crystal in William’s chest dimmed then faded away completely. It was now time for him to return to the Temple of the Gods to continue Issei’s Divinity Training.

Somewhere within the Temple of Ten Thousand Gods…

A celestial beauty, wearing a black dress, sat on a black throne and looked into the distance. She was currently looking at a Pink Teddy Bear holding a Water Whip in its hands.

A mischievous smile could be seen on her face. Her eyes, which were darker than black, locked onto the precious soul that resided inside the stuffed toy’s body.

The beautiful woman watched as the Teddy Bear accidentally wrapped its body with the water whip in its hand. Clearly, the Teddy Bear was not used to its current body and was having trouble using the whip as a weapon.

A giggle escaped the lady’s lips as she watched the Teddy Bear’s futile attempts to free itself from the whip that had turned it into a spring roll.

William was not aware that one of the Primordial Gods within the Temple had taken a keen interest in him. A Goddess that would one day make her presence known, not only to William, but the entire world of Hestia.
