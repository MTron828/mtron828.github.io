Chapter 625: The Moment A Heart Breaks [Part 1]

“Tomorrow is the day…,” Chiffon muttered as she looked up at the moon in the sky. “Tomorrow, I will tell Big Brother that I… love him.”

Chiffon closed her eyes and the memories of her mother resurfaced. It had been a while since she had thought of her.

Since the day that she had met William, everyday that passed was filled with happiness. The pink-haired girl allowed herself to face the bitter memories that she had kept inside her heart.

She wanted to hear her mother’s words.

She wanted to remember her voice.

“You’re going to be twelve soon, Chiffon,” April said. “A few more years and you will be old enough to marry. I wish I could see that day.”

“Mama, what do you mean old enough to marry?” Chiffon asked. “What is marry?”

She had been too young then to understand her mother’s words. Even so, April was patient enough to answer her inquiry with a smile.

“Marriage is a ceremony where you say your vows to someone you love. Once this is done, both of you will be partners for life.”

Chiffon could still remember her mother’s expression when she looked in the distance, as if reminiscing a distance past.

“I hope that you will find someone who will truly love you,” April said as she patted Chiffon’s head. “Someone who will never leave your side in times of happiness as well as hardship.”

-

Chiffon opened her eyes as a tear slid down the side of her face. It had been so long since she had seen her mother’s face, and her heart ached because she missed her too much.

“Don’t worry, Mama,” Chiffon said softly. “I found the one I love. If it’s him, I’m sure that he will definitely love me back.”

The pink-haired girl looked at the moon for a few more minutes before going to her bed to sleep. When morning came, she would gather up all her courage and ask her Big Brother to make her one of his wives.

She had already known that he had intended to have nine wives. Ashe and Princess Sidonie were two of his future wives. According to them, there were two others who were waiting for William in the Southern Continent.

Although she still didn’t understand what marriage meant, Chiffon had decided to become one of William’s wives. She wanted to be with him, and be his partner for life.

-

Right after afternoon classes, Chiffon looked for William. The Half-Elf hadn’t joined the class today because he said that he had some important things to do.

It didn’t take long for the pink-haired girl to find her Big Brother. There were very few places that William visited in the academy, so it wasn’t that hard to find him.

When Chiffon entered Princess Sidonie’s room, she heard weird sounds coming from her bedroom. Out of curiosity, she lightly opened the door and took a peek.

There, he found William holding the beautiful princess in his arms. The two were sharing a passionate kiss. What caught Chiffon’s attention was Ashe, who had her head lowered and seemed to be licking something on her Big Brother’s lower body.

All three of them were naked, and were so busy with what they were doing that they didn’t notice someone peeking at them from the door.

This was the first time Chiffon saw the art of love making, and she didn’t know what to do. Her instinct was telling her that she should go away, but her curiosity made her stay.

She watched silently as the three people shared kisses, and pressed their bodies against each other.

Chiffon could feel her cheeks heating up, but she was unsure what was causing the feeling. All she knew was that her Big Brother’s current performance was making her feel things that she had never felt before.

She watched everything from start to end. The pink-haired girl didn’t know how much time had passed. All she knew was that she had seen something that she shouldn’t have.

Chiffon was about to leave the room when she heard Princess Sidonie ask William a question. It was a question that made her stop in her tracks and prevented her from leaving.

“Darling, I think Chiffon has feelings for you,” Princess Sidonie said. “What are you planning to do about it?”

Chiffon perked her ears up as she inched closer to the small gap on the door. This way, she would be able to better hear her Big Brother’s reply. Since this question concerned her, she wanted to know the answer to Princess Sidonie’s question.

“Chiffon has feelings for me?” William asked back. “Are you sure about this?”

“Yes. I am a woman, so I can understand women best. That little girl might be in love with you.”

“I see…”

Ashe, who was resting her head on William’s chest, joined the conversation with a light-hearted mood.

“Will, I know that it is not my place to say this, but I think that you should turn her down,” Ashe commented. “We don’t know anything about her background. It is better to be careful.”

Chiffon silently cursed Ashe inside her heart. She wanted to complain, and tell the girl that had started to nibble William’s ears to mind her own business!

“I agree with Ashe,” Princess Sidonie stated. “Chiffon is a very adorable girl. However, what if she is hiding a dark secret? Who knows, that secret might come back to bite us later on.”

Chiffon gritted her teeth. She had been getting along well with Ashe and Princess Sidonie. The pink-haired girl thought that they were her friends. Their sudden betrayal left a bitter aftertaste in her mouth.

William chuckled as she kissed both girls.

“Don’t worry, I have no intention of making her my lover,” William replied. “You’re right. How can I possibly accept a complete stranger as my lover?

“Also, I can’t bear the thought of kissing her lips. She had been eating trash for who knows how long. If I kiss her, wouldn’t that mean that I’ll be kissing trash? That’s so disgusting!”

Chiffon pressed a hand over her chest. She felt a sudden ache that made her breathing ragged. Dragging her feet, she left the room as fast as he could.

After stepping in the hallway of the dormitory, Chiffon leaned on the floor as she struggled to breathe.

She felt suffocated.

She needed to leave as fast and as far as she could before she was discovered.

In the outside world, the cracks on the crystal that hovered above Chiffon’s chest, widened. Red light was starting to spill from those cracks, threatening to burst out at any moment.

Chiffon used the walls as support as she tried to leave the girl’s dormitory, but it was of no use.

Her legs felt too weak, so the girl had no choice but to slowly lower herself to the floor as she tried to calm her senses.

It was at that moment when the door of Princess Sidonie’s room opened. William, Ashe, and Princess Sidonie came out of the room and looked down on Chiffon, who was sitting on the floor, gasping for breath.

William’s upper part was naked, and he was just wearing pants. Ashe and Princess Sidonie, on the other hand, were wearing nightgowns of blue and red.

Chiffon looked up at William with a pale expression. She appraised her Big Brother’s face, looking for any signs of tenderness or affection but she found none.

“Did you hear us?” William asked.

Chiffon hurriedly shook her head in denial. She was afraid that if she said yes, her Big Brother would abandon her completely.

“Liar,” Princess Sidonie said with contempt. “You’ve been peeking on us the whole time. Did you think that we were not aware that you were behind the door?”

Ashe stepped forward and lowered her head. “You thieving little cat. Do you really think that you can steal William away from us? You sure got guts, little girl.”

“N-No,” Chiffon stuttered. “I don’t plan on stealing Big Brother. I just want to be like the two of you. I want to be by his side as well.”

Ashe raised an eyebrow when she heard Chiffon’s reply. She then glanced at the Half-Elf who was just listening on the side.

“Will, you heard her,” Ashe said. “She wants to be like us. Chiffon wanted to become your lover. What is your answer?”

William took a step forward. Ashe gave way and straightened her stance to allow her lover to approach Chiffon.

The Half-Elf knelt in front of Chiffon until they were eye to eye with each other.

“Do you love me?” William inquired.

“Yes,” Chiffon replied. “I love you, Big Brother. I love you very much.” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Then, do you want to marry me?”

“I do. Please, marry me, Big Brother.”

Chiffon pleaded. Even if William didn’t love her as much as Ashe and Princess Sidonie, as long as she was by his side, she would be happy. The pink-haired girl looked at William with a face filled with longing.

William cupped the side of Chiffon’s face.

The little girl shivered because William’s hands felt cold. Also, his eyes… his eyes stared at her with disdain.

“Me? Marry you?” William sneered. “The only thing that you are good at is eating trash. Do you really think that I’ll marry trash? What a delusional girl you are.”

Tears formed at the corner of Chiffon’s eyes, and her eyes became dull and lifeless. The last thing she heard was a loud cracking sound, before her world shattered, and her consciousness descended into darkness.
