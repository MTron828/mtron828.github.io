Chapter 554: I Promise That I’ll Be A Good Girl, So Please, Don’t Leave Me Behind [Part 2]

William teleported inside the 10th Floor of Atlantis and brought Chiffon in his Sea-Side Villa. A few seconds later, the little girl’s Divinity went berserk.

Before her reasoning had been taken over completely, Chiffon punched William’s stomach with all her might, sending the Half-Elf flying hundred of meters away from her location.

“Big Brother, I’m sorry,” Chiffon muttered before she lost consciousness. “Please. Run away.”

That was when William saw first hand what the power of the Seven Deadly Sins could do, once they lost control.

Chiffon opened her mouth wide, and a crackling sound was heard. It was as if space itself was being distorted and the air around her trembled.

A series of notifications sounded inside William’s status page warning him of the danger that was about to come.

[ Host! Please hurry! Leave this place! Everything on this floor will be devoured by Chiffon! ]

William gritted his teeth as he looked at the unconscious girl, whose tears were still streaming down the side of her face. Suddenly, the ground rose from under her feet and flew towards her mouth, to be eaten.

The sea churned and charged towards the shore as if they were being compelled by some unknown law that they couldn’t fight against. Everything within a thousand meters of Chiffon was being devoured, and that range was slowly increasing by the second.

William kept backing away, but the power of Gluttony that was akin to a blackhole had instantaneously increased its might. The Half-Elf suddenly found himself within the range of Chiffon’s devouring ability, and was helplessly pulled in her direction.

“Quickshot War Art, Fusion Form!” William roared as he summoned his wooden staff and pointed it at Chiffon’s opposite direction. “Blitzer Railgun!”

William merged with his staff and flew away. At least, that was what was supposed to happen, but reality was different. The wooden staff only managed to travel for five meters, before it stalled and stayed in place.

Slowly, but surely, it was being pulled towards Chiffon’s small mouth that was capable of devouring entire cities in the Central Continent.

It broke William’s heart to see Chiffon in such a condition, but there was nothing he could do.

‘System, put a tracker on Chiffon. I want to monitor her condition!’

[ Understood! ]

A beam of light shot from the wooden staff and hit Chiffon’s forehead. After successfully planting the tracker, William left the 10th Floor of Atlantis and returned to the First Floor in haste. He knew that if he stayed, he would just be devoured by the power of Gluttony that had gone berserk.

After reaching safety, William immediately asked the System to allow him to see what was happening in real time.

The System complied, and shared the view around Chiffon.

What he saw was complete, and utter Darkness.

If not for the fact that he could still hear the faint devouring sound in the background, he might have thought that the Tracker was not working.

Even the artificial lighting on the 10th floor had been sucked away completely. The growling sounds of Chiffon’s stomach could be heard amidst the darkness. William doubted that his lollipops would be able to fight against this Divinity that had run out of control.

All he could do was wait.

An hour passed.

Two hours passed.

More hours passed.

William sat cross legged as he continued to monitor Chiffon’s condition. After a day inside the dungeon, the growling sound stopped.

The System scanned the surroundings, and Chiffon’s body several times, before giving William the go signal that everything was fine.

William returned to that dark, and empty world. Even his eyes that could see past the darkness couldn’t see anything inside the 10th Floor of Atlantis.

“Light,” William said softly and several balls of light illuminated the surroundings.

It was then when he saw her. Standing at the center of the destruction that she had caused, with tears still streaming down the sides of her face.

William wrapped his arms around the girl who followed him around, and hugged her tight. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Big Brother, please, don’t leave me,” Chiffon said weakly as she buried her head on William’s chest. She wanted to hug him back, but she was feeling very weak right now. If not for the fact that William was hugging, and supporting her body, she might have already collapsed on the ground.

“I promise that I’ll be a good girl, so please, don’t leave me behind.”

“Okay. I won’t leave you behind. I promise.”

As if waiting for that answer, Chiffon closed her eyes and slept. She had already reached her limit physically, and emotionally.

William carried the pink-haired-girl in a princess carry, before teleporting to his Villa in the Thousand Beast Domain.

Ian and Princess Sidonie were there and had been waiting for any news about Chiffon. William had ordered everyone to leave the Dungeon of Atlantis, just in case Chiffon’s devouring ability broke through the spatial floors of the dungeon.

Fortunately, it didn’t, and only one floor was sacrificed to the little girl’s devouring ability.

Princess Sidonie and Ashe looked at the disheveled pink-haired girl and felt an ache in their chests. Chiffon had become very dear to them and seeing her like that broke their hearts.

“Please, clean her up,” William said as he handed Chiffon to Ian. “Let her rest here in the villa for now. Although the possibility is low, a relapse could occur. We’ll keep her here just in case.”

Ian nodded in understanding and transformed into her true form before going to the bathroom.

Princess Sidonie walked towards William and gave him a hug. “If someday, I will also lose control of my powers, make sure to trap me in one of the floors of your dungeon. That way, I will not be able to hurt anyone.”

William’s body stiffened. He wanted to assure her that such a day would not come, but he couldn’t say it. In a few days, he would be leaving the Kraetor Empire to go to the Tower of Babylon.

Although they could meet in the Thousand Beast Domain, this was only a temporary fix to the problem. William shuddered at the thought of Princess Sidonie losing control of her powers.

“I will find a way,” William said as he hugged the beautiful princess in his arms. “I promise. I will find a way.”

“We believe you,” Princess Sidonie replied. “I and Morgana believe in you.”

William sighed as he closed his eyes. He could still hear Chiffon’s pleading words inside his mind. After seeing her in that state, and the reason why it happened, William already knew what he needed to do.

He only hoped that at the end of their journey, he would find a way to help Chiffon have better control of her Divinity. That way, she would no longer need to suffer from the heartbreak of devouring the things that were important to her.
