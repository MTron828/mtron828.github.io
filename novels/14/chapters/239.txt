Chapter 239: The Deity Of The Sky

With a thrust of his spear the wall of ice in front of him was obliterated, creating a tunnel. The Seventh Form, Longinus, was an ability that could pierce through almost anything. It could even destroy magic barriers if William could empower it with enough magic or aura.

Without a doubt, it was one of the aces up William’s sleeve.

The Half-Elf returned Stormcaller inside his storage ring and proceeded to check the mine that the system had discovered while scanning the mountains.

The Half-Elf’s eyes widened when he found himself surrounded by thousands of glittering Magic Crystals. It was not a Magic Crystal Mine, but a Magic Crystal Cavern!

The very air was radiating with magic power, and William immediately noticed an unbelievable phenomenon in his status page.

“Oh, my, Goddess!” William exclaimed.

Just being bathed by the concentrated magic in the air was enough for him to gain experience points!

The system had already switched his Job Class to his Ice Wizard Job Class and the experience points quickly filled up his Experience Bar.

[ Host, we need to move the Magic Crystals inside the Thousand Beast Domain ASAP. The magic is starting to leak and it might cause a Phenomenon in the sky above our location. It would be bad if the natives were to notice. ]

‘How do we transfer it?’ William asked.

[ We will need to use the power of the three Divinities in order to “distort” the surroundings and allow us to safely transfer the entirety of the mine inside the Thousand Beast Domain. I will also need to use 1,000 God Points to buy the auxiliary consumables that will make the transfer less problematic. ]

[ God Points: 5,980 ]

[ Deducting God Points to buy consumables. ]

[ God Points: 4,980 ]

William sat on the ground and called out to the Three Divinities inside his Sea of Consciousness. The King Chess Piece, the CPU Core, and the Lollipop glowed at the same time and pooled their power to distort the world around William creating a minor “God Domain”.

The System carefully engulfed the entire Magic Crystal Cavern inside the God Domain. It made sure that not even a single piece of Magic Crystal was left out. When everything was ready, it immediately transferred the mine into the Thousand Beast Domain.

It had already prepared a place for it and the mine was successfully relocated behind Willliam’s personal Villa within the Thousand Beast Domain.

When William opened his eyes, he almost didn’t recognize his surroundings. The entire cavern had been gouged out of the mountain leaving behind a wide crater.

It was also at this moment when William saw a two-meter-tall block of ice that was emitting mists in the distance.

‘Is this also a magic crystal?’ William asked the system.

[ Please, don’t approach it, host. Let me scan it first ]

[ Initiating Comprehensive Scan. ]

[ Scan successful completed! ]

William waited patiently. He was really curious what this big block of ice was and what it was doing inside the Magic Crystal Cavern that he had transported inside his domain.

[ Host, the block of ice that you see is a magical block of ice that is being maintained through the use of the power of the Magic Crystals inside this cavern. If my calculation is correct, this block of ice is thousands of years old. ]

‘A block of ice that is thousands of years old? I’m sure that those who do ice sculptures would love to have it in their collection.’

[ Surprisingly, I found a beast trapped inside it and after matching my scan against the database, I found out its name and origins. ]

‘A beast trapped in the ice?’ William’s eyes widened in surprise. After the initial shock ended, it was replaced by pity. For a beast to be trapped inside a block of ice for thousands of years was a very tragic thing.

William cautiously approached the frozen beast and observed it carefully. The ice prison was not that thick, but all he could see was a blurred image of a beast that seemed to be only a foot tall and half a meter long.

The rainbow colored scales on its back illuminated the block of ice which made it very attractive to look at. The creature’s claws were curled up into its feet, and its head was raised in an arrogant manner. William assumed that it was taking a fighting pose before it got frozen in ice.

‘System, my appraisal skill can’t pass through the block of ice. Can you tell me the details of this beast?’

[ Certainly. I will post the details on the host’s Status Page. ]

William opened his status page and checked the information that was passed to him by the system.

-

[ Kasogonaga ]

— Deity of the Sky

— Demigod

— Threat Level: C (Low)

— Cannot be added to the herd

— When the world was still young, and monsters rampaged the land. The Kasogonaga was one of the few Demigods who favored humans.

— It has the power to call out rain, which helped them grow their crops and ensured that their lands remained fertile.

— It was said that the rainbow-colored scales that cover its body had given birth to the rainbows that could be seen after a rain.

— This is a gentle beast by nature and dislikes conflict. However, whenever it is threatened, it will curl up its body and start to roll.

— Alongside rain, thunder, and lightning, the small Demi-God would charge at its enemies and was given the nickname “Rolling Calamity” by the God’s of that Era.

— This creature is the bane of all Ant Type Beasts.

— It has no known weakness.

-

‘Hyeok!’ William almost choked on his spit.

‘Are you sure this is a Demigod?!’

[ I’m 100% certain, host. ]

William didn’t know what to feel after reading the information about the Deity of the Sky. Initially, he thought that all Demigods were Calamity Class Beasts. However, the Kasogonaga that they had discovered was only Class C and currently trapped inside the block of ice, frozen in time.
