Chapter 561: Eternity With You - R18

(Disclaimer: You’ve already watched enough H to know where this is going. This chapter will be all about ahem, so if you’re not interested in it, feel free to skip!)

The sound of kissing could be heard inside the artifact, Eternity.

Celine felt a tingle run down her spine as William’s hands caressed, and fondled her smooth and jade-like body.

She wanted to take the lead, because she felt that it was her duty as a Master to show William how it was done. The beautiful Elf was not aware that when it came to love making, the Half-Elf had more experience between the two of them.

“I’ve dreamt of this in the past,” William said as he kneaded Celine’s two peaks with his hands. “Master, you’re very beautiful.”

William lowered his head and slightly bit the pink tips that had already become firm due to his fondling. He kissed, licked, and sucked them like a baby. While his lips were busy with Celine’s breasts, his right hand moved downward, past her abdomen and into the entrance of her maidenhood.

Celine’s body uncontrollably shuddered under the machinations of William’s hands.

The Half-Elf had already known that although his Master acted like she had a lot of experience in these kinds of activities, Celine was still a pure maiden that had not been touched by any man.

Unlike her, William had already done the deed in his dreams, but none in real life. He had never crossed that line with Wendy, Ashe, and Princess Sidonie, because the time wasn’t right.

Now that he had officially turned eighteen, there was no need for him to hold back.

“W-Why are you so good?” Celine stuttered as William playfully pinched her… “Have you done this before?”

“In my dreams,” William answered.

“Are you… Mmhh!… Hah… stupid?”

“It’s the truth, Master. I have done this many times in my dreams.”

“With me?”

“… Yes.”

William’s slight hesitation didn’t escape Celine’s gaze, but her thoughts turned to mush as the Half-Elf’s hand continued their relentless attacks.

After sensing that Celine’s body was ready to accept him, William kissed his Master’s lips before spreading her legs wide. His gaze landed on that place where he would soon claim as his own.

“Master, are you sure that you want it to be me?”

“We’ve already come this far. Let’s finish it till the end.”

Celine relaxed her body and waited. She didn’t have to wait long, because William was also at his limit. The moment he lowered his hips, Celine’s final resistance was torn away and swept aside like a boat facing a storm in the open seas.

The beautiful Elf felt pain, but it was not as painful as she expected it to be. Lady Eros had instructed William to make sure that his partner would be able to accept him fully, and the teenager used everything he learned to practice.

William made love with Celine, and the latter’s pleasurable sighs permeated their surroundings. He didn’t do it roughly, but he did it in a way that would torture his master. This was his payback for the years that he had suffered in her hands.

The Half-Elf gave her a sweet, and slow, but pleasurable experience. There were times where he would stop, and only continue after Celine had begged him.

Celine might be his Master when it came to Dark Magic, but when it came to lovemaking, William won hands down.

They made love many times, each time a different position. This time, it was William’s turn to teach Celine what he was capable of. To his credit, the beautiful Elf had no complaints, only asking him for more. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Several hours later…

Celine slept soundly on the bed, while William wiped the sweat off her body with a hand towel. The red stains on the white sheet were proof that he was Celine’s first man, and William was very tempted to take it inside his storage ring to serve as a memento of their passionate night together.

‘I guess I should,’ William thought as he used his Wind Magic to lift Celine’s body from the bed. He then took the white sheet inside his storage ring and hurriedly placed a new one, in order to remove any evidence.

“Pervert,” Celine said as she opened her eyes. She was really asleep earlier, but the moment she sensed magic being used on her, she woke up, just in time to catch William in the act of putting the bed sheets in his storage ring.

William pretended that he didn’t hear her and carried the Elf towards the bathroom to clean her up.

Eternity was an artifact where one could spend several days in closed training. Naturally, it had facilities like a house complete with all the necessities for someone to live there for an extended period of time.

William used his Fire and Water Magic and filled up the bathtub with warm water before placing the lady in his arms inside it.

Naturally, he also stepped into the tub and positioned himself behind her, letting her body lean over his chest.

The two soaked in the water without saying a word. William’s arms were wrapped around Celine’s waist, holding her in place. William was hesitant to ask Celine a question, because he already knew what the answer would be.

Although she was with him now, Celine wouldn’t change her decision to go to the Demonic Continent.

A day passed and then two…

William and Celine didn’t leave Eternity and spent their days together. Celine told William about her childhood and her relationship with Celeste.

Contrary to his expectations, Celine had a good relationship with her twin sister. She added that both of them only treated each other coldly on the surface, so that the Elders of the Elven Council would think that they didn’t get along.

“When I meet her, I will make sure to tell her about you,” Celine said as she caressed William’s head that was resting on her lap.

The two of them spent their days like this. Neither wanted to break the atmosphere between the two of them, so they resorted to talking about random things, instead of asking each other where they both stood in their relationship.

William could tell that his Master didn’t want to give him false hope, so he decided to respect her wishes.

“Master, when I was young, Oliver told me to take the Seed of Life from Celeste after I traveled to the Central Continent,” William stated. “He said that I should give it to you afterwards.”

“Oh? He did?” Celine chuckled. It was then when a devilish smile appeared on your beautiful face. “Well, why not? I’m curious how she will react after you state your claim.”

“Master, I can tell from your words that something bad will happen to me if I do that.”

“You’re just overthinking things.”

Celine’s body shuddered as she held back a giggle from escaping her lips. She was very curious about what would happen if William were to really do as he said. Naturally, she had an idea why Oliver asked this of William.

The beautiful Elf didn’t know whether she should praise or nag the Parrot Monkey for doing things behind her back. Even so, one thing was certain. The Parrot Monkey had schemed against William and thrown him into the Lion’s Den.

Of course, Celine wouldn’t say anything because she wanted Celeste to know how shameless her Disciple was. She only hoped that during their first meeting, William wouldn’t suffer too much from her twin sister’s reaction to his demand.
