Chapter 452: The Dice Has Been Cast [Part 2]

“The reason why I wanted to meet with you is due to the two Foreign Invaders that are now right outside the borders of the Hellan Kingdom,” Conner stated. “Depending on the result of our discussion, Our Organization may choose to leave the Hellan Kingdom and attach ourselves to one of these powers.”

William’s face remained calm even after hearing Conner’s veiled threat. Celine had already predicted this outcome, so she had warned William beforehand that the Leader of Deus might jump ship if things didn’t look good for them.

Celine and William both agreed that there was only one power that would accept the Organization in their ranks and that is none other than…

“So, you plan to go to the Kraetor Empire,” William commented. “Not a bad choice.”

Conner stared at William’s face and he could tell that the boy wasn’t surprised by his statement. He thought that he would get the upper hand, by saying that he would give up the Hellan Kingdom and become part of the Kraetor Empire’s forces.

‘I see, so he really is Princess Sidonie’s ally,’ Conner thought.

He didn’t know that Sidonie was no longer a Princess, but an Empress that had dominion over two kingdoms. Although her little brother was the one currently ruling the Kingdom of Freesia, it didn’t change the fact that she was the one that called the shots.

Conner thought that William’s composure was due to the fact that he had found a strong backing. A backing that Conner wanted to have as well. Right now, only the Kraetor Empire had enough manpower to deal with the Elves and fight them on even grounds.

He had been informed by Calum that William’s and Princess Sidonie’s relationship seemed close. This was the conclusion that he had arrived at after observing the two from afar.

“So, you’re saying that both of us should work together and fight against these two powers, correct?” William inquired.

“Yes,” Conner replied. ‘So you will not admit that you are Princess Sidonie’s ally? Too bad that I am already aware of your relationship with her.’

If possible, Conner didn’t want to become anyone else’s subordinate. Becoming Princess Sidonie’s lackey was his last resort. What he wanted to gain from this negotiation with William was to have the Half-Elf agree to work with him to deal with the Elves and have a Non-Aggression Pact with the Kraetor Empire.

He believed that as long as he was only fighting against the Elves, he would be able to wipe them out if it was a one-on-one battle. Conner was banking on the fact that the army of Super Soldiers would soon finish their final transformation.

“Since you are being open with your goal then allow me to tell you something about the recent event that transpired in the Zelan Dynasty,” William said. “A few days ago, we went there to destroy their teleportation gates.”

Conner wasn’t able to stop the surprise from appearing on his face when he heard William’s words.

“Did you succeed?” Conner asked. He waited in bated breath for William’s answer.

If William had succeeded in destroying the Elves’ ability to get more reinforcements from their homeland, then that would bring them one step closer in finishing them off. This was what Conner was thinking as he eyed the red-headed boy in front of him.

“No,” William answered. “We failed in our mission. Also, I have more bad news to tell you. Two Guardians from the Silvermoon Continent managed to pass through the gates in the middle of the battle. One was the Qilin, Eneru. The other is the Ancient Golem, Drauum. Have you heard of them?”

Conner’s face immediately went pale when he heard the name of the two Guardians from the Silvermoon Continent. He knew who Eneru was because he had access to the information network of Deus.

As someone who hated the Elves, he had collected a significant amount of information about the forces that were present in the Silvermoon Continent. This included the Seven Guardian Beast of the Silvermoon Continent.

The Qilin, Eneru.

The Ancient Golem, Drauum

The Winged Serpent, Drakon Nalzrig

The Ent King, Myrendor

The Guardian Deer, Zyphon

The Golden Dragon, Ezkalor

The Demigod, Sepheron

These are the Seven Guardians of the Silvermoon Continent. Sepheron was a Demigod that was bound to the Silvermoon Continent. It rarely left the land of the Elves to go into hibernation for hundreds of years at a time.

The Ancient Golem, Drauum, was the second most powerful being among the Seven Guardians. Although it was only two-meters tall, no one dared to underestimate its strength because it was a golem that could even fight against Demigods.

“Boy, are you joking or what?” Conner asked in disbelief. “Are you telling me that Drauum is already in the Zelan Dynasty. Celine, your Disciple sure knows how to crack a joke.”

Conner shifted his attention to the beautiful Elf that was seated beside William.

“I’m afraid that he’s telling the truth,” Celine replied. “I was there when Drauum appeared. We barely escaped with our lives in that single confrontation with it.”

Conner rubbed his face in order to calm his nerves. Now that Celine had confirmed that the Ancient Golem was indeed present in the Southern Continent, he felt like running away was his best course of action.

It didn’t matter how many Super Soldiers the Organization had. Against Drauum, these near immortal warriors were like eggs being thrown at a boulder.

“So, what are you going to do now?” William asked. “Are you going to seek protection from the Kraetor Empire, or will you stay in the Hellan Kingdom and fight against the Elves?”

The reason why William mentioned the appearance of the Qilin and the Ancient Golem was to test Conner’s resolve. He wanted to know whether the Leader of Deus would choose to flee or remain to fight.

Right now, what William needed was allies, and not people who would run away during the crucial moment. He was even willing to set aside their differences, so they could sit down to talk to one another.

If Conner decided to hide under Empress Sidonie’s skirt then there was nothing he could do about it. Frankly, he was also tempted to do the same thing. However, there were a few individuals on their side that might be able to extend their help when all hope was lost.

One was Takam, the Demigod of the Kyrintor Mountains.

The other was Vlad, the Strongest Demigod in the Southern Continent.

If these two Demigods decided to stand on William’s side then even Drauum would have to think twice before making a move on the Hellan Kingdom.

Jekyll had already told him straight up that William shouldn’t put his hope on Vlad because his father didn’t care about the fate of the Hellan Kingdom. The only thing he cared about was James.

When William asked Jekyll if Vlad would come to his aid if he went to the battlefield carrying James’ statue as a shield, the Dentist of Lont laughed out loud before telling William that it was a brilliant idea.

However, Jekyll flatly told him that Vlad would definitely kick William’s bum, sending the boy to the Stratosphere if he were to do that. Just like William’s reverse scale was his family, Vlad’s reverse scale was James. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Messing with a Demigod was a very stupid thing to do.

After hearing Jekyll’s claim, William scrapped the idea of using his Gramps to instigate the Demigod to help him fight against the Elves. If James could have heard William’s plan, he might have spanked the boy silly for using his old bones as a shield to fight against his enemies.

William stared at Conner and waited for his answer.

The dice has been cast.

He only waited to see whether Conner would choose to fight, or choose to flee when the odds were stacked against him.

Celine observed this battle of wits from the side and a smile appeared on her face. She was quite satisfied with how William dealt with Conner and felt proud because he was her Disciple.

‘If only he was given a few more years to grow up, I’m sure that he would have been able to surpass my expectations,’ Celine thought.

She sighed in her heart knowing that in a month or two, war would be upon them. A war where many lives would be lost, never to be seen again.
