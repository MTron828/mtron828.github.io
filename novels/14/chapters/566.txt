Chapter 566: Trial Of Dominion [Part 1]

Dark-red clouds loomed above the heavens and the ground under their feet was rough and uneven.

William and Chiffon felt their strength decreasing at a rapid rate. The Half-Elf had already reached the initial stages of the Mithril Rank, while Chiffon was in the initial stages of the Platinum Rank.

(A/N: Mithril Rank is equivalent to Class A Beasts. Platinum is equivalent to Class B Beasts.)

However, right now, both of their Ranks continued to regress. After two minutes, both of their Ranks stopped at the Bronze Rank (Class E).

William flexed his right arm and tested his body’s reaction time.

‘The laws of this floor is the real deal,’ William thought as he did some stretching exercises. ‘Although my rank decreased, my fighting ability remains intact.’

According to the last survivor, the Fourth Trial was impossible to clear. There were two reasons for this.

The first one was that whoever chose this trial would have their strength sapped away from their body, until they reached the Bronze Rank.

If it was only a regression in rank then it wouldn’t be such a big deal. However, what they would face after being stripped of their strength was simply asking them to die.

William looked at the farthest point of his vision and saw a red fog, moving in their direction. When the fog was only a mile away from them, several figures emerged from it, each armed with a weapon of their own.

Hundreds…

Thousands…

Tens of thousands…

Hundreds of thousands…

A million…

Chiffon’s eyes widened when she saw the familiar looking creatures that were marching towards their direction with the intention to kill.

‘Looks like that survivor’s testimony is correct,’ William mused as he eyed the million strong army that had made this trial impossible to clear for normal people.

Yes. The reason why the survivor said that the fourth trial was impossible to clear was due to the fact that after he was stripped of his power, he had to face an army of Goblins that numbered in the millions.

Even if that person was a former Saint, there was no way they could defeat this kind of army even if they had eight members in their team.

“Kcatta!” The Hobgoblin Leader raised its sword and shouted.

“”Kcatta!””

“”Kcatta!””

“”Kcatta!””

After making his declaration known, the Hobgoblin leader points its weapon to William and ran forward, leading the charge.

“”Kcatta!””

The ground trembled as the entire goblin army charged forward, brandishing their weapons. Chiffon frowned as she held William’s hand tighter. The Half-Elf squeezed her hand back to assure her that everything was under control.

A portal appeared in front of William and four figures emerged from it.

Xerxes, the Hobgoblin Arcane Doctor, who was seated on top of its Salamander Beast Companion.

Rex, the Hobgoblin Chieftain who was mounted on top of a Trollhound.

Sharx, the Goblin Marauder who was mounted on top of his mount, Sparky.

And a two-meter-tall Goblin wearing a white, full body armor. It was holding a blue sword in its right hand, and a silver-round-shield in the other. It was seated on top of a Flying Tiger that William had bought in the Auction House for thirty thousand God Points.

His name was Jareth, the Goblin Paladin, the new addition to the officers of William’s Goblin Army, and boasted the highest attack power among all the Goblins under his command.

Due to the laws of the trial, all of their ranks had also regressed to Class E Beasts. However, William’s purpose for summoning them was not to fight the Goblin Army but to recruit them!

Jareth urged his mount forward and fearlessly faced the charging Goblins head-on. Xerxes, Rex, and Sharx, followed behind him. Just like humans, Goblins had a hierarchy as well.

The strongest Goblin would become the King, and everyone else had to submit to his will.

Just as William expected, the frontrunners of the Goblin Army slowed down their advance. The goblins at the back also felt the presence of a strong Goblin and their instincts kicked in.

“Ohw si ruoy redael?” Jareth asked. “Emoc tou dna thgif!”

(Who is your leader? Come out and fight!)

(A/N: If you can understand Goblin Language then you must be a goblin as well. Kekeke!)

The Goblin Army glanced at each other before looking behind them.

At the very rear of the army, a black goblin that was three meters tall stepped forward. It brandished its war axe left and right, and glared at Jareth who was looking back at it with a calm expression.

William arched an eyebrow and used his appraisal skill to see this type of Goblin that he had never seen before.

‘Oh, this is one tough cookie to beat,’ William thought as he eyed the Dark Goblin Warmonger in front of him. ‘However, it doesn’t matter. Jareth will be able to handle it.’

A devilish smile appeared on William’s face as he looked at the Goblin Paladin that he had bought for Ten Million Dungeon Points.

‘That ten million dungeon points is worth it.’ William smirked. ‘Show them what you can do Jareth, and nab me a million more goblins for my Goblin Army!’

Unknown to William, the Guardian of the Floor of Genesis was looking at this scene with a dumbfounded expression.

‘Someone found a loophole in the trial I made,’ The Guardian thought while scratching its head. Although the duel between the two Goblin Commanders hadn’t started yet, it had a nagging feeling that the worst was yet to come.
