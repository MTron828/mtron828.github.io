Chapter 435: Stabbing A Tender Heart

William clenched his fists as his killing intent swirled around his body. Oliver had informed him that Deus had tried to infiltrate Lont in order to kidnap Matthew and Eve. The Parrot Monkey added that their goal was to use the two of them as hostages in order to make William submit to Floyd’s demands.

Although they didn’t know what these demands were, they understood that they had to hold significant weight for Floyd to personally attack Lont with his men.

“Don’t worry, our freeloader Demigod has already dealt with them,” Oliver said. “Unfortunately, Floyd got away. No. More likely, Vlad allowed him to get away. Demigods don’t usually antagonize mortals because it is beneath them to do that.”

William took deep breaths in order to take hold of his emotions. The mere thought of having Eve kidnapped was enough to make him go on a killing spree. Fortunately, Floyd didn’t succeed, or else William would have immediately left the Kyrintor Mountains and hunted Floyd down like a rabid dog out for blood.

“Please tell Master to thank Lord Vlad for me,” William replied after he regained his calm.

Oliver nodded as he assured William that he would pass on his message to Celine.

“Ah, Mistress also wanted to tell you something else,” Oliver said. “She said that you should continue your training and do your best to recruit more allies.”

“Second Master, did you not tell the Master about the Dungeon of Atlantis?”

“Why should I? This is your secret. If you want her to know, tell her yourself.”

Although Oliver had kept his correspondence with Celine about William’s current affairs, he never told her about William’s new Goblin Army or about the Dungeon of Atlantis.

Although he could be devilish at times, Oliver was someone who respected the privacy of others. Unless it was truly important, he wouldn’t share any secrets with Celine without the permission of the person involved.

The Parrot Monkey would even leave William’s side whenever he spent his time with his lovers. This was his stance when it came to the Half-Elf’s welfare, whom he also considered to be his own Disciple.

“Thank you, Second Master,” William said. He was touched because he didn’t expect that Oliver would keep the secrets he held from his Master, Celine.

“You’re welcome,” Oliver replied. “Ah! Before I forget there was one more message from the Mistress. She said that Ezio went to the Zelan Dynasty to spy on the Elves. According to him, the Teleportation Gates will be completed in a month and a half.”

Oliver paused for a while before continuing his message.

“He added that if you have any plans to sabotage it, you should meet with him a month from now at the border of the Zelan Dynasty. That is all.”

William frowned. A month may seem like a long time, but it was also too short to do anything. Right now, he still hadn’t met Takam’s requirements, so he wouldn’t be able to count on the Titanic Green-Scaled Trollhound for help.

The Half-Elf sighed as he rubbed his forehead. Oliver just watched him from the side, his eyes filled with pity.

Time was of the essence, and William was doing his best to make ends meet. After making up his mind, William decided to pour the next few days into advancing his Job Classes as much as he could. That is the only way for him to stand a chance against the Elven Army who was about to call for reinforcements from their homeland.

Royal Palace of the Zelan Dynasty…

Arslan stared at the capital city of the Zelan Dynasty-Briar Glen-with a sad expression on his face. The once lively city was now a dark and gloomy place. The occasional laughter that usually permeated the air could no longer be heard. It was replaced with a solemn atmosphere that made his heart ache.

A few moments later, he heard the sound of footsteps approaching him from behind. He turned around and knelt on the cold tiled-floor and waited for his Master’s orders.

Yes. Arslan was now a slave that served directly under the Elven Princess. If one were to ask if he liked his current circumstances, the answer would definitely be No. However, Arslan had to admit that Princess Eowyn had treated him well and didn’t order him anything unreasonable-like harming his own people.

Most of the time, Arslan just stayed inside the man servant’s quarters as he waited for the Princess to summon him. He would accompany her wherever she went and served as her bodyguard. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

The survivors who recognized him during these excursions outside the palace would look at him in pity. Their greatest prodigy was now a slave and serving their conquerors. This left a bitter aftertaste in their hearts.

This was what Elandorr had wanted to happen. He wanted the Humans to despair and forget any notions of resistance. This was why he urged Princess Eowyn to go on Humanitarian Missions to the different cities of the Zelan Dynasty to give food to the survivors who were struggling to survive.

Princess Eowyn also understood the meaning behind it, but she still thought that this was for the best. The sooner the Humans submitted to their race, the sooner their suffering would end. At least, that was what she thought.

However, behind closed doors, the Elves would trample on the Humans’ dignity. They would humiliate and degrade them, until they pleaded for mercy. The Elves made sure that the Humans knew their place and treated them like slaves.

A month after the invasion, the survivors were starting to lose hope. Arslan’s capture was the last nail of the coffin and it made what little hope that they had in their hearts vanish completely.

Arslan sighed in his heart. He knew that today would be just like any other day where they would visit another city and parade him around like a monkey.

‘I hope that Paul managed to find the Crown Prince,’ Arslan thought as he raised his head to look at the beautiful Princess who looked at him with a smile.

Although Eowyn was beautiful, Arslan couldn’t find it in his heart to be attracted to her. How could he possibly hold tender feelings to the Elven Princess whose race had made their lives a living hell?

No.

Love and affection were not the things he needed. What he wanted was a blade. A sharp, and cold, blade that would end the life of this beautiful princess who was now standing in front of him.

Although he knew that the Princess was innocent, this was the only way he could vent out his anger for the deaths of the children in the capital. Children that had died due to the neglect of the Elves.

Innocents that had been treated like trash until their dying breath. But that was not the end of it. The Elves would gather these bodies and throw them outside the city gates where a giant pit was dug.

There they would be set ablaze until only ashes were left.

Sounds like a proper burial?

It would seem that way.

Unfortunately, the Elves had other things in mind.

In that very same pit where the ashes of his people were being kept, Ash Golems would emerge. These three-meter-tall Golems were Class B (High) Beasts that the Elves were planning to use as Cannon Fodder for the upcoming war with the Hellan Kingdom and the Kraetor Empire.

Arslan had watched this phenomenon happen countless times already. Everytime it happened, his hatred for the Elves would increase.

He prayed, with every fiber of his being, that an opportunity would come. An opportunity that would allow him to personally kill Elandorr or the Elven Princess by his side.

Princess Eowyn felt someone staring intently behind her. She then turned her head to look at Arslan with a smile.

‘Just one chance,’ Arslan thought as he smiled back at the innocent Princess whose beauty was coveted by all of the young Elves in the Silvermoon Continent.

‘All I need is one chance to send you to the afterlife. I wonder… will you still smile at me as I slit your throat in front of your people?’

Arslan’s smile deepened. He looked forward to the day where he would personally stab his blade right into the Elven Princess’… tender heart.
