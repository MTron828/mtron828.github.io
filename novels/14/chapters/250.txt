Chapter 250: Calm Your Tiddies, You Bunch Of Pus*ies!

A hot gust of air washed over the spectators that were watching the battle. The enchantment that was placed on the Arena of Chivalry had activated and prevented the roaring flames from going outside the confines of the Arena.

Jerkins clenched his fist as he exclaimed in both shock and happiness at William’s firm stance when it came to killing the Second Prince.

‘Good job, boy! Good job!’ Jerkins gritted his teeth as the blood boiled inside his body. He wished he could do the same and massacre the other representatives of the Aenasha Dynasty, but he was more of a scholar than a warrior.

The flames of Soleil rampaged as it tried to break free, but the powerful enchantments of the arena kept it in place. Soon, the flames subsided and only a golden spear, firmly embedded in the ground, could be seen where the Second Prince of the Anaesha Dynasty once stood.

Great Chief Evander, and the rest of the warriors, had solemn expressions on their faces as they looked at this scene. Their gazes shifted from the spear stuck in the ground to the boy that was slowly descending from the sky.

[ Ding! ]

[ Hidden Quest Cleared! ]

[ Beat the Second Prince of the Aenasha Dynasty! ]

[ Reward: 1000 God Points ]

The red-headed boy was surprised when the series of notifications appeared on his status page. Although he wished that he would gain points in defeating Prince Aziel, he didn’t expect that a hidden quest would be triggered after he successfully killed him.

William had no qualms in killing Prince Aziel because it was a scenario where either the Prince died, or he died. He wouldn’t show mercy to his enemy, especially when that enemy was hell bent on killing him.

William’s hand was firmly gripping the feet of the Blood Eagle, whom he named Scadrez. The Half-Elf gave the Great Chief of the Northern Tribe a side-long glance before his feet touched the ground. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“Thank you, Scadrez,” William said and the Blood Eagle screeched in reply.

It circled around its master once before disappearing into the air.

William extended his hand and Soleil flew back to him. He held the spear firmly in his grip as he walked towards the spot where the Prince had fallen. There, on the ground, was the Onyx Medallion that he had used to summon the Ant Warriors to fight by his side.

Surprisingly, the medallion hadn’t melted and was still intact. William picked it up and was about to appraise it when a scream broke the solemn air of the Third Peak of Chivalry.

“Prince Aziel!” A panicked scream broke out from the representatives of the Aenasha Dynasty.

The two Mithril Ranked Warriors jumped down into the arena and charged towards William. Both of their eyes were bloodshot because they didn’t expect that their Second Prince would die in his fight against the Knight Commander of the Hellan Kingdom.

They knew that they would be punished by the King when they returned to their domain, but they hoped that their punishment would be lessened if they presented the culprit to their Monarch.

William didn’t move and simply stared at the two approaching warriors in disdain. A mocking smile appeared on his lips as if taunting them for their stupidity.

The two warriors became more enraged and unsheathed their weapons when they were only twenty meters away from their target.

They planned to cut off the boy’s legs in order to prevent him from running away, so they could drag him back to their homeland and torture him for life.

The two warriors brandished their weapons at the same time, however, something unexpected happened.

When their weapons were merely a foot away from William’s body, both warriors stopped in their tracks. Their expressions and gazes didn’t change, but they had stopped completely. It was as if both of them were frozen in time, unable to deliver that disabling blow that would cripple the Half-Elf whose mocking smile widened even more.

“The Wind may blow, but the Ice will never melt,” William said softly. “Mortals who disobey this law… will only have one ending.”

As if waiting for those very words to finish, both warriors turned into ice sculptures, to the surprise of all the foreign guests who thought that William would die under the two warrior’s hands.

Only the Northern Tribe didn’t bat an eye and remained indifferent to the fate of the two warriors that had dared to break one of their sacred laws.

William casually brandished Soleil and shattered the two ice sculptures. The Arena of Chivalry only allowed duels that both parties had agreed upon. Those who broke this rule would turn into ice sculptures and their fate would be at the mercy of the person whom they wished to harm.

Since William already knew the rules of the arena by heart, he acted firmly and destroyed the ice sculptures. He had no intention of negotiating with the representatives of the Aenasha Dynasty because both had already shown open hostility to each other.

The Second Princess, Valeria Sy Anaesha, looked on in horror as William made a cutting the neck gesture in her direction. The remaining guards hurriedly stood in front of the Princess and unsheathed their weapons. It was their way of protecting the last “VIP” of their Dynasty within the Kyrintor Mountains.

William ignored the soldiers as his eyes shifted towards the Great Chieftain’s location. Half of his mission had been completed and it was time to finish the rest while he still had the strength to stand.

He ignored the pain that was coming from the acid burns on his body as his eyes locked on his target. William raised the spear in his hand and pointed it at the Second Warrior of the Tribe, Connal Zeke.

“When I saw Princess Aila, I fell in love with her at first sight,” William said in a righteous tone. “Although I am younger than her by two years, I’m sure that she’ll be more beautiful when I come of age. I’ve always wanted to marry a Princess, so this is an opportunity that I can’t afford to miss.”

Princess Aila, and the other people that were present on the Third Peak couldn’t stop their lips from twitching. Just an hour ago, William declared that he “fell in love at first sight” when he saw Brianna. Now, he was saying the same thing.

All of them wanted to spit on him and ask. “Just how many times do you plan to ‘fall in love at first sight?'”

Wendy, Amelia, and the rest of the members of William’s Knight Order covered their faces as they looked away in embarrassment. For a brief moment, they wanted to pretend that they didn’t know the shameless Half-Elf who had a smug expression on his face at this time.

Even Jerkins’ usually calm facade broke apart and was forced to cover his mouth to prevent himself from laughing out loud.

“Commander William, why don’t you stop here?” Great Chief Evander was forced to acknowledge William as one of the Knight Commanders of the Hellan Kingdom after he had shown his mettle against Prince Aziel and the Centennial Ants.

Although he didn’t know the origin of that rainbow colored Anteater that appeared earlier, a beast that could single-handedly defeat, and devour, three Centennial Ants was no laughing matter.

“Today is the day that my son will choose his brides,” Evander continued. “Since he has already chosen the princess as his main wife, it would be disrespectful for the guest to snatch her away, no?”

William smiled when he heard Evander’s condescending words. Frankly, he felt like scum right now. But, he’d rather be a scum than a dead scum. As long as they were on the Third Peak of Chivalry, William could use the rules to his advantage. However, once they left this place… the advantage he had would disappear like the fleeting wind.

“So, you are saying that the Second Warrior of the Tribe refuses to accept my challenge?” William nodded his head. “Alright, I will accept your suggestion, but he has to change his title to the ‘Second Coward of the Tribe’. I am very excited to share with my kingdom that the warriors of the Kyrintor Mountains are just a bunch of pus*ies.”

William laughed out loud. It was a laughter filled with ridicule and contempt that irritated the ears of everyone that heard it, excluding the representatives of the Hellan Kingdom.

The Great Chief and the rest of the warriors glared at William hatefully, but the target of William’s ridicule sat calmly on his seat as if he didn’t hear the Half-Elf’s mocking words.

The Second Warrior calmly sipped his tea and let the mocking laughter wash over him like a passing breeze. He was not afraid to fight William, because as long as he was in his domain, he would be able to use the power of his bloodline to its limit.

The reason he was not saying and doing anything was because he was waiting for his father’s decision. The Great Chief was his father and his words were law. Great Chief Evander had already told him subtly to remain seated and not say or do anything reckless.

As the Second Warrior, he wouldn’t allow himself to be enraged by mere taunts. However, Connal didn’t expect that William would also mock the warriors of the Northern Tribe.

What he did went past the Northern Tribe’s bottomline!

All the warriors roared in anger and brandished their weapons. If not for the laws of the Third Peak, they would have already swarmed the hateful Half-Elf and torn him to shreds.

“What’s wrong? Are you guys angry?” William laughed. “Calm your tiddies, you bunch of Pus*sies! Come, this Sir is here! All of you can fight me at the same time. I’m not afraid of Pus*sies!”

The Crown Prince of the Zelan Dynasty, Alaric Sol Zelan, had a faint smile on his face as he looked at the Knight Commander of the Hellan Kingdom who was busy taunting the warriors of the Northern Tribe.

Deep inside he was laughing heartily. He thought that coming to the Kyrintor Mountains would be a dull undertaking. He didn’t expect that he would find “First-Class Entertainment” in this dull and frigid place.
