Chapter 228: Thousand Beast Domain [Part 1]

Spencer rolled on the ground and was about to get back up when Drake fell on his body, pinning him down.

“Get off me!” Spencer roared as he pushed aside his comrade at arms.

Drake lay on the ground panting and didn’t get up right away. Spencer, on the other hand, picked up his spear that had fallen several meters away from him and charged at Ella.

He activated his Aura and Spear intent to increase his speed and get close to his opponent. Unfortunately, Ella didn’t wait for him. Instead, she used her Rush Attack and met Spencer head-on.

Spencer was a step too late and was unable to use his weapon to strike. Ella’s horns impaled the boy’s chest and pierced through his heart. Spencer screamed in pain before turning into particles of light. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Ella then fired three consecutive “Benevolent Shots” at Drake who was still lying on the ground. Soon, he, too, turned into particles of light and disappeared from the Coliseum.

“It’s really hard to fight the Commander’s Goat,” one of the First Years winced after seeing Spencer’s gruesome death.

“Even two of our strongest fighters can’t beat her in a two on one battle,” an eighteen-year-old member of the Angorian War Sovereign commented. “Class C Beasts are really on another level.”

“Can we not fight her?”

“We have no choice. It’s the Commander’s orders.”

“Stop whining and let’s go. There are six of us, I’m sure we can do something.”

“That’s right! We can overwhelm her with numbers. So what if she’s a Class C Beast? We can still beat her if we work together!”

“I agree!”

“Let’s go and beat the Commander’s Goat!”

“”Let’s go!””

William was currently seated in one of the spectator seats in the Coliseum with his arms crossed over his chest. Today was Monday, and it was time for their Martial Training Class. Grent personally asked William if he could borrow Ella so she could have a battle against the students.

After asking for Ella’s opinion, William accepted Grent’s request and his Mama went to the Coliseum to fight against the First Years. The Head-Instructor of the First Years of the Martial Class Division hoped that the young teens would be able to test their abilities against a Class C Beast.

The outcome was a one-sided massacre.

Although Ella loved children, she didn’t show the First Year’s any mercy. She intended to make them realize how dangerous it was to face off against a Beast that was as strong as her. She killed all of them in order to prevent them from dying in the future due to ignorance and negligence.

Everyone fought Ella, with the exception of William. The fight was not a one-on-one battle, but a fight using a party of six people each round. At most, all of the students’ battle prowess were in the Silver Ranks, which was roughly equivalent to Class D Beasts.

The officers, namely, Priscilla, Kenneth, Conrad, Spencer, Drake, and Dave were just a step away from the Gold Rank, which was roughly equivalent to a Class C Beast (Low).

Even so, they still didn’t win against Ella who had gained a lot of fighting experience through life and death battles.

For her, the children were just as strong as a Hobgoblin Leader.

When the entirety of the First Years had died under Ella’s horns and hooves, Grent declared that their lesson for the day was over.

All of the students stared at the Angorian War Ibex with newfound admiration and respect. They even bowed to her at the end of the class as a “thank you” for giving them a painful experience.

Ella gave them a brief nod before changing back to her “Fluffy Goat” form and returning to William’s side.

“Good job, Mama,” William said as he brushed Ella’s back.

“Meeeh,” Ella replied happily because she felt that she had done a good job in teaching the children about the dangers of fighting against strong beasts. She hoped that this would be a painful lesson that would save their lives in the future.

William and Ella headed straight to their dormitory room to check up on Dia, Thor, and Ragnar. The three little Guardians were currently undergoing their second growth phase and had gone into hibernation.

According to the system, this growth process could take a few weeks to a few months before the three guardians woke up from their sleep. Right now, the safest place William could leave them was the Head Prefect’s room. This room was protected by a special enchantment that forbade others to enter unless they were people whom William had given exclusive permission.

Ella laid down beside the kids and looked at them with gentle eyes. She hoped that when the three of them woke up, they would be stronger and would be of greater help to William.

William looked at the sleeping guardians and frowned.

‘System, is there a place where we can hide the three of them while they are undergoing their transformation? I don’t feel safe leaving them inside my room while I’m away.’

[ Before I answer that question, host, can you first answer a question of mine? ]

‘Go ahead,’ William said as he laid down on the bed. ‘As long as it’s not Math, I can answer it easily.’

The system became silent for a moment before asking William the question it had been meaning to ask.

[ Host, what do you intend to do with the God Points we received from the God of Alchemists? Is there something that you plan to buy in the God Shop? ]

‘Actually, I also wanted to discuss this topic with you,’ William replied. ‘I browsed the God Shop yesterday and found some interesting weapons to buy. However, I can’t decide what to get. Last time, you gave me a good recommendation with Rhongomyniad. If possible, I’d like to ask for another recommendation from you.’

[ Understood. Actually, I was hoping that the host still hadn’t made up his mind on what to do with the God Points. After calculating the host’s possible future arrangements, I concluded that it would be best to not invest in any kind of weapon right now.

[ The reasoning is simple. The host already has a few mythical grade artifacts that can be used to increase your offensive, defensive, and creative prowess. ]

William nodded his head in agreement. Soleil and the Yin Yang Cauldron had indeed given him two Job Classes that he could tinker with for the time being. The Sun Knight required William to bathe in the sunlight to gain experience points. The Alchemist required William to craft items to gain mastery and gain skill points.

With these Two Job Classes in hand, adding a few more would only eat up more of William’s precious time that he could use for other things.

‘What do you suggest I do with the God Points?’

[ Invest in Domain Creation. ]

‘Domain Creation?’

Instead of answering William’s inquiry, the system opened up the God Shop and showed William the Domains that were being sold on the miscellaneous tab.

-

500 Square Meter Domain = 10,000 God Points

.5 Square Mile Domain = 20,000 God Points

3 Square Mile Domain = 30,000 God Points

5 Square Mile Domain = 40,000 God Points

7 Square Mile Domain = 50,000 God Points

——

[ Host, Domains are miniature worlds that can support life. The Alchemist God has several Domains where he plants the rare herbs that he uses for his alchemy. This allows him to craft rare pills without worrying about a shortage of ingredients.

[ Several other Gods also have domains of their own to grow various products which they use to sell in the God Shop. Host, did you know? You can also buy rare beasts in the God Shop once you upgrade your Main Job Class, which is the Shepherd Class. ]

‘What?!’ William gasped. ‘You mean there are other features in the God Shop that are not available to me?’

[ Yes. Right now, the host can only access the Weapon, Armor, Accessories, and the Miscellaneous Shop. After you upgrade your main Job Class, you will be able to access the other shops like the Beast Shop, Humanoid Shop, Construct Shop, and gain access to the Auction House. ]

‘They also sell live Beasts? And Humanoids?’ William frowned. ‘I can understand why they sell Beasts, but Humanoids as well? Isn’t that the same as selling slaves?’

[ Host, you have to understand that not all the Gods are as good as the ones that support you. If there is light, there will also be darkness. The Auction House is also a place where the followers of the Gods can auction the items that they found in their own worlds.

[ It is a way to gain God Points which then can be used to purchase other items in the God Shop. ]

[ In time, the host will also be able to auction off your own items in the God Shop, but for now, our priority is to have our own Domain. I propose that the host use 30,000 God Points to buy the 3 Square Mile Domain from the God Shop. By doing so, you can house a number of Beasts, such as the Trollhounds that are currently staying inside your Goblin Crypt. ]
