Chapter 493: Emotions That Could No Longer Be Held Back [Part 1]

With just a glance, one could tell the number of Elves that died were greater. The Unstoppable Million Beast Charge had broken through the Elves’ formation and instantly killed most of the vanguards that blocked their path.

William scanned the bodies of those that had fallen and his heart ached because he recognized some of them.

Kasogonaga was bawling its eyes out as it gazed at the body of the Giant White Ox that had died protecting it, Psoglav, Sharx, and the Goblin Cavalry from their enemies.

It blamed itself for not being able to control its bloodlust that had caused the needless sacrifice of its friends’ lives.

The Demonic Dog that always had a composed smile on its face was no longer smiling. Instead, its bloodshot eye gazed at the Blademaster that was standing beside its friend’s dead body in the distance.

If iis single eye could kill then Psoglav had already killed the Blademaster, who had taken its friend’s life, a thousand times over.

“Well, I guess this is what you call checkmate, boy,” Ezkalor appeared beside Nalzrig with his arms crossed over his chest. “Surrender while you still can. Enough blood has already been spilled, no?”

Stormcaller returned to William’s side because the effect of his combined fusion art had lost its effect.

The Half-Elf stared at the three Myriad Beasts in front of him with a serious expression. The initial advantage they now had was gone, and the battle once again leaned in favor of the elves.

-

[ That was an unexpected development. ]

Morgana chuckled as she gazed at the Giant Deer and Winged Serpent that had been summoned out of desperation.

[ Poor Darling. I guess he is in serious trouble now. ]

Empress Sidonie looked at this scene calmly. Drakon Nalzrig’s, and Zyphon’s appearance was indeed unexpected, and was not part of her plan. Even so, she still believed that the outcome that she had envisioned would still become a reality.

‘What are you going to do now, Sir William?’ Empress Sidonie thought as her eyes focused on the Half-Elf who stood at the very front of the Allied Army.

——

King Minos and Drauum had also stopped their battle and returned to their normal sizes. Drauum was surprised to find a being that it wasn’t able to beat using brute force. King Minos didn’t even bother to look at the Ancient Golem as he returned to the side of his people.

A unicorn landed in front of the Elven Army. seated on its back was Princess Eowyn who looked at William with a complicated gaze.

“Sir William, we don’t need to continue this war,” Princess Eowyn said. “Like I said before, we can reach a compromise. You can be the King of this country, while it goes under the Elves’ rule. No one needs to get hurt anymore, so, please consider it, Sir William.”

William gave the Princess a side-long glance before shifting his gaze to Zyphon.

The Guardian Deer of the Elves felt a shudder run down its spine when William looked straight at it.

“Princess Eowyn, your offer is good, but I already said that I do not wish for dominion,” William replied. “Also, you’re not the one that has the final say in this negotiation. What you wish for, is not what those who have instigated this war wish for. I would appreciate it if you would just stand to the side and not involve yourself in useless politics.”

Princess Eowyn felt her cheeks burn from embarrassment after hearing William’s reply. She was still the Princess of the Elves, and for the red-headed boy to tell her that she didn’t have the final say in negotiations made her heart ache.

Elandorr who saw this found it the perfect opportunity to get into the Princess’ good graces. He immediately stepped forward and berated William for his crashness.

“How dare you insult Her Royal Highness?” Elandorr asked. “She is our princess, naturally she represents us all.”

William frowned as he shifted his attention to Elandorr.

“You. Can you stop talking?” William pointed his finger at the young Elven Commander. “I don’t know what kind of idiot placed you in your position, but you are as useless as that princess in this negotiation. What you say doesn’t matter.”

“Y-You!” Elandorr couldn’t believe that William had the guts to tell him that he was as useless as the Princess. “I am the Commander of this expedition!”

“So?” William snorted. He then raised his chin arrogantly and pointed it at Shafel who was standing not far away from Elandorr. “Then tell me, can you order that old elf beside you to go to the back of your army while you handle the negotiations?”

Elandorr was about to say more, but he almost choked when he heard William’s words. The old Elf that the red-headed boy referred to was the Patriarch of his clan. Even if you gave him a bottle filled with courage, he didn’t dare order his Patriarch to go to the back of the army while the negotiations were being held.

“See?” William sneered. “You’re just a prop to make your clan look good. Since you don’t have a say in this matter, then shut the f*ck up.”

Conner, who had his arms crossed over his chest, laughed out loud at William’s statement. Although he and William were only temporary allies, he liked how the boy made the Princess and the stuck-up Commander of the Elves know their place.

Elandorr used all of his willpower to prevent his expression from distorting. The Half-Elf had announced that he was merely a Prop Commander. Although he wanted to refute his words, he felt that William would say something else that would make him lose face even more.

Instead of saying anything, Elandorr raised his hand and the Elves parted to make way. Erchitu’s body, that was stained with blood, was carried by magic and placed beside Elandorr.

The Young Commander sneered at William as he stabbed his sword into the head of the Beast that sacrificed its life to protect his comrades.

William’s eyes widened because of Elandorr’s action. Kasogonaga shouted, and Psoglav growled. The residents of the Thousand Beast Domain glared at Elandorr hatefully, but the Elf didn’t bat an eye and continued what he was doing.

After a while, a core that was as big as a bowling bowl had been dug out from Erchitu’s head. It was purple colored and contained vast amounts of energy that people use to increase their ranks in the world of Hestia.

Shafel smirked from the side because he approved of his grandson’s counter-attack. William’s face that had contorted with anger was the perfect proof that Elandorr had succeeded in making him angry.

“This Beast Core is good,” Elandorr said with a smile. “I’m sure that my rank will increase after I have absorbed all of its energy.”

Icarus and Daedalus gripped their weapons and were about to take a step forward, but King Minos grabbed both of their arms and shook his head.

“Do not do anything,” King Minos said. “Someone else will do it for you.”

Elandorr patted the Beast Core in his hand and gave William a smug smile. Killing intent overflowed from William’s body, but the Elven Commander wasn’t scared. There were Five Guardians of the Silvermoon Continent around him, so there was no reason for him to be scared.

Eneru smirked because he hated William with every fiber of his being. Anything that would make the Half-Elf mad was welcomed in his book.

“You just had to do that didn’t you?” William said through gritted teeth.

“Yes? What’s wrong?” Elandorr chuckled. “Isn’t it the victor’s duty to enjoy the spoils of war? Everyone, tonight we will be having beef jerky. There are so many freshly slaughtered cows here. I’m sure that we will all have our fill.”

The Elves cheered in unison to back up their Commander’s words. They then eyed the tens of thousands of flaming bulls and Lamassus’ that had died. The Beast Cores inside them were still in place, and the Elves would process them later after their important parts had been dismantled and stored properly.

William’s face returned to its normal expression as he looked at Elandorr as if he was looking at a person that was about to die. There were things that he could brush off, and things that he couldn’t.

He had almost lost control when he saw how Elandorr desecrated Erchitu’s body and was now even thinking of eating the members of the Minotaur Race that had fought hard, and died fighting for him. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“Unforgivable,” William muttered as he plucked out a few strands of his hair and blew on it. Immediately those strands became seven clones who somersaulted in the air and landed on white clouds.

William pulled a few more strands of hair then more, and more.

He blew on them all and now, thirty clones floated in the air above William. With a loud shout, these clones released their Aura which made Drauum frown.

All of the Clones had the rank of a Saint. This rank wasn’t a match to any of the Guardians beside it, but somehow, he felt that something was wrong.

“Drauum and Eneru, do you remember the first time we met?” William asked as he gripped the staff in his hand firmly. “Do you remember the parting gift I gave both of you last time?”

Drauum’s and Eneru’s expressions immediately turned serious. How could they possibly forget that scene when William had left a two-mile-wide scorched Earth when he made his escape with Jekyll.

“”Quick Shot War Art… Fourth Form!””

All the clones aimed their staff at the Elven Army in front of them.

Drauum roared and stomped its feet on the ground. Several walls of Earth stood in front of the Elven Army.

“Quick cast your barriers now!” Eneru ordered.

William pointed his own staff at the Earth Dome that had risen up to protect the Elves from his overflowing emotions.

Emotions that could no longer be held back, for his heart screamed in anger.

The tip of the golden-metalic staff in William’s and his clones’ hands glowed brightly. They were about to unleash William’s answer to the Elandorr’s provocation.

“”Grand Bazooka!””
