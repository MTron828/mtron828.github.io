Chapter 616: A Mother’s Final Request [Part 1]

A group of beautiful women chatted in the garden located at the side of the villa. They were the other wives of Chiffon’s father, and they were talking about random things in the Demonic Continent. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

After a while, they saw Chiffon walking back to the villa from the small house where her mother was housed.

One of the ladies clicked her tongue in disgust, “I still don’t understand why our husband still keeps that woman around. He should just toss her to the desert and let her fend for herself.”

The other ladies around her chuckled and nodded their heads in agreement. All of them were rivals, but Chiffon’s mother was a thorn that they had long wanted to get rid of these past few years.

April was their husband’s first lover. If he married her, she would have become the main wife and first among all of them. Fortunately, the Demonic Council opposed his idea, so Chiffon’s mother didn’t gain a noble title.

All of them were very happy with this set-up, but deep inside, they still felt worried that their husband would once again rekindle the love that he had for April and make her one of his legal wives.

The ladies exchanged a knowing glance as a plan formed inside their heads.

Luciel, their husband, and Chiffon’s father, was currently out on a hunting trip along with his subordinates. The only ones in the villa were their guards. If they were to make a move on April, now was the perfect opportunity to do so.

However, they needed a valid excuse to do it. Although they didn’t say it out loud, they were afraid that Luciel would get angry if they made a move on April, while he was away.

Luciel’s first legally married wife, Natasha, narrowed her eyes. She was the daughter of one of the Dukes in the Demon Continent who supported Luciel’s reign. Because of this, her authority was the highest among his wives, and everyone followed her orders without fail.

“Our husband won’t be back for three more days,” Natasha commented. “If any of you can come up with a good plan about how to deal with April, I am willing to lend an ear. Naturally, all of you are required to participate once the plan is set in motion.”

“Of course, Big Sister. We will give you our full support.”

“As long as we can make that April suffer, I am willing to cooperate.”

The other ladies voiced their agreement. Although all of them didn’t get along well, they were united in their hatred for April. They still thought that having a dwarf as one of their husband’s lovers was a stain in their reputation.

“I thought of a good plan,” one of the ladies said with a smile. “We will be able to punish both mother and daughter at the same time.”

“Oh? Let us hear it then!”

“Go on. Don’t leave us hanging.”

Natasha lightly brushed her long, light-green hair with her hands, before making a gesture for her compatriot to tell them her plan. If it was really as good as she claimed it to be then they would definitely act on it without fail.

While the ladies were talking, there was someone who heard their conversation from above their heads.

William’s consciousness had somehow merged with Chiffon’s consciousness.

He had seen how Chiffon was treated by her half brother and sisters.

He had seen April and how much she loved her daughter.

He had heard how Chiffon’s step mothers came up with a plan to make the mother and daughter pair suffer.

William gnashed his teeth in anger and his hands balled into fists. However, he was powerless to do anything.

It was as if he was watching a movie as a spectator. No matter what he did, nothing happened. He couldn’t contact Optimus, he couldn’t use his skills, and he couldn’t talk to Chiffon. After several tries, William gave up and observed Chiffon’s childhood.

William made sure to remember the names of Chiffon’s father and stepmothers. He vowed that when he visited the Demonic Continent, he would give all of them a piece of his mind.

The next day, Chiffon was dragged by her half-siblings to the garden to play dodgeball. Of course, this wasn’t an ordinary game because they were using a special artifact that Natasha had secretly lent to her son, Felix.

The children were split into two teams, and the game began as Felix threw the ball at Chiffon’s team, and eliminated them one by one.

Of course, they didn’t aim for Chiffon at the beginning. They saved her for last because the children had already been told secretly by their mothers about the plan that they had come up with a day ago.

Finally, only Chiffon was left on her team because everyone had been eliminated.

Felix grinned and threw the ball towards Chiffon in a casual manner. The ball flew very slowly, so Chiffon decided to catch it.

When Chiffon caught the ball, a cry of pain escaped her lips because the ball suddenly became very hot. It was as if she had caught a big lump of coal that had just recently begun burning in a fireplace.

Chiffon immediately let go of the ball. She then tearfully inspected her hands in order to see the damage she had taken, but to her surprise, her hand was perfectly fine. Aside from the pain she was feeling, there were no visible injuries that could be seen anywhere.

“What’s wrong?” Felix asked. “It’s your team’s turn to hit us. What are you standing there around for? Hurry up and go to your position!”

Chiffon almost jumped up in fright because of Felix’s yell. She hurriedly went to the spot that was reserved for her and waited for the game to begin.

The siblings exchanged a glance at each other and sniggered. It was now time for the second phase of their plan.

The game began and Felix’s team deftly dodged the balls that were thrown at them. Every time it was Chiffon’s turn to throw the ball, she would feel a searing pain in her hands. This caused her to throw the ball haphazardly which made her siblings burst out in laughter.

The ladies who were watching them from afar chuckled among themselves because they fully knew what was happening to Chiffon.

In the end, Felix’s team was eliminated and it was now their turn to throw the ball at Chiffon’s team. Just like always, they saved Chiffon for last.

Felix sneered as he threw the ball at Chiffon. This time, he didn’t hold anything back and threw the ball with all of his might.

Chiffon was about to dodge to the side when suddenly, the speed of the ball increased. It then hit her squarely on the chest, which sent her flying a few meters in the air. Felix had activated the special ability of the artifact that increased its speed and made the ball twenty times heavier.

Everything happened so fast that Chiffon had no idea what happened. The pain in her chest made it hard for her to breathe. Several of her ribs had been broken, so every time she drew breath, she would feel a stinging pain that made breathing difficult for her.

Blood seeped at the corner of her lips, and tears came out of her eyes. It was at this moment when a scream was heard in the distance.

April had witnessed Chiffon getting hit by the ball and was shocked at what happened next. As a fighter, she realized that the ball was not an ordinary ball, but an artifact that could also be used as a weapon. This realization filled her with anger as she ran towards her daughter to check her condition.

“M-Mama,” Chiffon cried out weakly. She was in great pain, and wished for her mother to make the pain go away.

April ran towards her darling daughter with tears in her eyes. She was feeling murderous right now, and had the strong urge to kill Felix with her bare hands. However, she knew that the guards who were watching by her side would prevent her from doing that.

Since that was the case, she rushed towards her daughter who was currently in pain. April would do everything in her power to save Chiffon, even if the price she had to pay was her own life.
