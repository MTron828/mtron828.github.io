Chapter 275: Will He Be Able To Resist My Charm?

William was like an overprotective boyfriend as he accompanied Wendy wherever she went. This caused the rumors about the two of them to spread to the other divisions and it made Wendy secretly happy.

How could she not be happy?

She could still remember the passionate words that William told her a day ago which made her feel like she was on cloud nine.

——

“Wendy, will you be my girlfriend?” William asked.

“Yes!” Wendy replied in a heartbeat.

She was afraid that if she was a second late in her reply, William would change his mind and tell her that he was just joking. This was why, when she confirmed that the handsome Half-Elf was serious about asking her out, she let go of all of her worries and kissed him passionately for two minutes!

When their lips parted from each other, she buried her face into William’s chest and hugged him tight.

“Is this a dream?” Wendy asked anxiously. “Am I dreaming?”

William gently patted the back of her head and assured her that she was not dreaming. All he asked of her was to keep their relationship a secret for the time being because he didn’t want to make things difficult for his Grandpa, James, and the Old Fox, Lawrence.

“I’m sorry,” William apologized. “Although you are now my girlfriend, and I will do my best to always be by your side, I’m afraid that I can’t declare it publicly. You already know that I still have an agreement with Rebecca and I still need to give my Grandpa and Sir Lawrence some face.

“I will only be able to give you hugs and kisses when the two of us are behind closed doors. I’m sorry if you find my affection for you lacking when both of us are in the outside world.”

Wendy kissed William’s cheeks as she looked him in the eye to give her reply. “I understand. However, you’d better make up for it when it’s just the two of us, alright?”

“Okay,” William replied.

Wendy fidgeted before asking the question that was nagging at her mind. She knew that nobles usually had many wives and she was afraid to confront William about this matter in fear that he would think that she was a nosy lover.

However, in order to prepare herself for the future, she still decided to ask to put her mind at ease.

“Will, how many wives do you plan to have?”

“… Promise me that you won’t get angry at me if I give you my answer.”

“… How many?”

Wendy thought that William was going to say a dozen, because some nobles really did have a dozen wives and even secret mistresses that they hid in the shadows. She hoped that William wouldn’t go that route because she knew that she was the very jealous type of girl.

“Nine Wives…,” William said.

“Nine Wives?!” Wendy gasped.

Although the number of women her boyfriend planned to marry was many, it was still better than William having a dozen wives.

Wendy grudgingly nodded her head before looking at William with a pout.

“Womanizer.”

“Sorry.”

“Will I be the first wife?” Wendy asked.

This was an important matter that she had to know. In every household, the position of first wife was important. It had the highest rank among the other wives and the woman that held this rank was considered to be the groom’s “Main Wife”.

“Yes,” William said softly. “You will be my first wife.”

“Good.” Wendy nodded her head and hugged William. “Will, I love you.”

“I love you too, Wendy,” William kissed her forehead and held her tight. Now that he had already made his feelings known, his heart was finally at peace.

——

“If you don’t look where you are going, you are going to trip,” William reminded the daydreaming girl who seemed to have her head in the clouds as they walked towards the training area for their Knight Order.

Wendy looked left and right to ensure that no one was around them. After seeing that the coast was clear, she then moved close to William and whispered words of love in William’s ears. The red-headed boy smiled and gave her a quick kiss on the cheek before arriving at their destination.

Today was an important day because William planned to ensure that none of his members were going to be affected by the Mind Weaver spell that was slowly spreading throughout the academy.

Although he felt guilty, he didn’t remove the spell inside Est’s and Isaac’s bodies. The system had already informed him that Carter had distinctly felt the loss of his connection to Wendy when William fed her his lollipop.

He didn’t want the latter to become more suspicious, so he refrained from openly targeting those that were still affected by the spell. William still didn’t know the professor’s motives and those of his acquaintances, if he had any, within the Royal Academy.

“Everyone line up!” William ordered as soon as he arrived at the training grounds. “Today, I will give all of you a special treat for all of your hard work.”

He then took out a few pouches from his storage ring and handed them to his officers.

“Each of you takes one lollipop,” William said in a commanding tone. “This is your reward for all of your hard work. Now, all of you eat it before we start today’s training.”

Although everyone felt confused why their Commander was suddenly distributing a snack for everyone, none of them complained. Each of them stuck the lollipops inside their mouths and began to eat it.

The system had informed him ahead of time that there had been a few members of his Knight Order that had been affected by the Mind Weaver Spell.

‘So, it’s concentrated in the Magic Division,’ William thought.

[ Affirmative. Fortunately, the Fourth Years seemed to be untouched by the effect of the Mind Weaver Spell. It seems that Professor Carter has only targeted the First Year[delete s] up to the Third Year Students of the Magic Division. ]

William nodded in understanding.

‘He thinks that those without magic power are useless, so he’s left the Martial Division alone,’ William mused. ‘Also, the Spirit Division has very strong awareness in their Sea of Consciousness. They would immediately detect a spell that tried to invade their minds, causing them to conduct an investigation.’

Although he was an enemy, William had to admire Carter’s meticulous planning. Now, all that was left for him to do was uncover the professor’s agenda. As long as he was able to know it, he would be able to stop it!

William’s gaze scanned the members of his Knight Order with a serious expression. He wouldn’t allow anyone to take control of the organization that he had built from scratch, for they were the sword and shield that would protect the Hellan Kingdom from those who wished to harm it.

Meanwhile at the borders of the Hellan Kingdom…

A legion of Hippogriffs flew in a battle formation as they entered the borders of their allied Kingdom.

They had already been informed beforehand of the upcoming war between the Hellan Kingdom and the Two Dynasties that were just outside their borders.

Because of this, they had been very vigilant during their travels and had been on high alert ever since.

In the middle of the battle formation was a flying carriage pulled by a Blade Wyvern. This Wyvern was a Centennial Beast and boasted incredibly high fighting abilities. Just like its name suggested, this Wyvern specialized in physical combat and its whole body was as hard as adamantium.

Its beak, and wings were razor sharp and could easily split steel armor into two. It was one of the protectors that ensured Princess Sidonie’s safety from anyone who wished her harm.

Inside the carriage, the Third Princess of Freesia glanced at the scenery outside the carriage window. She had visited the Hellan Kingdom a few years ago, and she found it to be a strong kingdom that equaled their own.

Although she was not interested in politics, she still studied the history and current situation of the three kingdoms that were outside the borders of Freesia. Her reason for doing this was simple.

She was looking for a candidate that might help her understand the true meaning of love. A love that was strong enough to overcome the power of seduction that had been with her from the day she was born.

Currently, her “followers” had reported a few interesting individuals that appeared in the Hellan Kingdom. When she browsed the contents of the list, one particular name stood out from the rest.

‘A slave and a Knight Commander at the same time?’ Princess Sidonie mused. ‘Now, this is something that I have to see for myself. I wonder, will he be able to resist my charm, or will he be like the rest that would happily kneel and kiss my feet with infatuated smiles on their faces?’
