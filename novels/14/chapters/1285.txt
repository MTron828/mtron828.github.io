1285 Just A Little More,And We Can Meet

William was doing his best to keep the smile on his face as he was surrounded by several ladies in the Underworld.

He was pouring wine, and other alcoholic drinks to the glasses of the ladies that had picked him as their host for the night.

The Second Layer of the Underworld was the “Entertainment District” of the underworld. Even those from the upper Layers would often come down to the second district to watch concerts, as well as enjoy the services that were offered there.

Erinys figured out that since William had wives, he had a lot of experience with women. In the Second Layer of the Underworld, cabarets and host clubs were quite popular, so the doll-like beauty told William that if he wanted to earn Hell Credits at a very fast rate, he should just become a host.

However, what the little girl had in mind was not just an ordinary host, but the Top Host of the most famous Host Club of the Second Layer, which was called Ouran Hostclub.

“Will, do you have anyone you like among us?” one of the ladies that had her arms wrapped around William’s waist asked as she looked up at him.

“I like all of you,” William replied with a smile. “Would you like to order another bottle of Champagne?”

“Will you let me drink it using your lips?”

“No. But if you like, I can make you chug the entire bottle in one go.”

The four ladies surrounding the black-haired teenager chuckled as they pressed their bodies against him. One beauty was hugging his head from behind, and letting it rest on her chest. Another was sitting on his lap, while tracing his lips with her fingers

Two other girls sat on his left and right, and held onto his arms, letting him feel the softness of their breasts.

If other guys had been in his position, they would certainly say that they were in Heaven, despite being in the Underworld.

Even so, despite the fact that Wiliam’s arms, and head were occupied, he was still able to serve the ladies by giving them alcoholic drinks just like his job entailed. The more they spent on food and drinks, the higher his share was, and the higher his share was, the faster he would earn the Hell Credits required to buy the ticket for the Third Layer of the Underworld.

William had been trained by Lady Eros herself, so he was quite proficient in the art of seduction. However, he didn’t do anything to his customers, and certainly didn’t treat them like girls to be taken out for a one-night stand.

This was why, although he had a standoffish attitude when it came to the ladies who chose him as their host for the night, they could still feel that he wasn’t just doing his job, but was also taking care of their needs.

“Will, do you have a girlfriend or a lover?” the beauty that was tracing William’s lips asked as she lightly poked his nose. “Would you like me to become your sugar mommy?”

“Actually, I am already married,” William answered. “I also have several concubines and secret mistresses.”

“Hahaha. You are very funny, Will.”

“Thank you for your praise. I can only stay with you girls for ten more minutes. Do you want an extension?” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Why not? You won’t be getting any sleep tonight.”

“Please, let me sleep. I’ve been here since noon.”

“Hahahaha!”

Using the power of Wind, William poured drinks into glasses and served them to the four ladies who had become his regular customers.

He had only been a host for five days, and yet he had already gained over a Hundred Thousand Hell Credits.

Although William didn’t hit and touch any of his customers below the belt, his popularity at the Host Club made the other hosts treat him as their rival.

Also, because his body was normally cold if he didn’t drink any blood, people thought that he was also a dead person, and not a living person who had somehow snuck into the Underworld to look for his wives.

“You’re so uptight, Will,” the lady seated on his lap said as she picked up the cherry from her cocktail and pressed it over William’s lips. “The other hosts would have pounced on us by now, and yet, you’re not doing anything to us. Are we that unattractive?”

“That’s right. We want to be pampered and spoiled by you,” the beauty who was hugging William’s head from behind said before nibbling on his ear. “Let loose a bit, will you?”

“What are you talking about?” William arched an eyebrow. “Both of you are very attractive. Um, our chef has this new dish that was just released on our menu. Are you girls interested in tasting it? It also comes with four Cosmopolitan magazines. I’ll make sure to pamper all of you if you order this set.”

“Really?”

“Yes. None of you are going to get any sleep tonight.”

The four ladies giggled and allowed William to order things for them. True to his word, the ladies enjoyed their night with him, and the Half-Elf had to personally take them back to their lodgings before going back to Erinys’ house to sleep.

“Welcome home, Will,” Erinys said as soon as she noticed William’s arrival.

“Thank you,” William replied.

The Halfling was wearing pajamas and holding a bag of potato chips in her hand while watching the Second Season of Squirt Games in Methflix.

It was around three in the morning, and the doll-like beauty should have been sleeping, but she had become hooked on watching the show. She would watch every episode as soon as it was aired, which coincided with the time that William’s shift at the Host Club ended.

“I’ll take a bath first then we can sleep afterwards. My customers spilled a few of their drinks on me.”

“Un. I’ll wait until you’re done.”

The two had been living together since William had entered the Underworld and, for some reason, he had gotten used to this usual daily routine of theirs.

Half an hour later, the door of William’s room opened, and Erinys came in with a yawn. The Half-Elf who had just finished drying his hair with a towel glanced at the sleepy girl who had already climbed onto his bed.

“Will it take longer?” Erinys asked as she curled up on William’s bed, covering herself with a blanket.

“Just about finished,” William replied.

Two minutes later, William entered the bed in his Pajamas, and also covered himself with a blanket.

Erinys then moved closer to him and buried her face in his chest, while the Half-Elf wrapped his arms around her, holding her in an embrace.

Soon, the Halfling’s sleeper breath reached William’s ears. A minute later, he too, closed his eyes to sleep. It may not look like it, but he was also exhausted after dealing with his customers in the Host Club, making him fall asleep in less than a minute, while holding the soft and delicate body of the Halfling in his arms.

Erinys had told William that she was lonely living alone, so when he started living with her, the doll-like beauty with blonde hair and blue eyes, would sleep with him every night.

William didn’t mind doing this because Medusa would do the same from time to time. She would come to the black-haired teenager’s room and simply snuggle up to him, as if seeking someone to fend off the loneliness that she had been feeling ever since Chiffon had died in the war.

As one of the ladies in the black-haired teenager’s dreams, he didn’t treat Erinys coldly and, to a certain extent, would often spoil her as well. Although his relationship with her was like a caretaker, taking care of a spoiled child, the Half-Elf didn’t mind making the lonely girl in his arms feel less lonely, especially during a cold night in the Underworld.

Kasogonaga and the rest, with the exception of Erchitu, had already received their bodies, and were busy modifying them using the Hell Credits that they had gained from their concerts.

But, all four understood that leaving the Underworld was not going to be an easy task for them. Unlike William who had entered the Underworld while he was still alive, Erchitu and the rest had already died.

Because of this, a special method had to be used in order for them to return to Hestia, and that would cost an exuberant amount of Hell Credits that numbered in the billions.

Unless they were able to reach this number, they would not be able to leave the Underworld because the Laws of the Dead prevented them from doing so.

They had already mentioned this matter to William, and the black-haired teenager understood that it would still take his friends some time to return to his side. However, knowing how popular Kasogonaga was in the Underworld, he believed that it wouldn’t take the four of them that long to return to the Surface World.

As William feel deeper into sleep, he found himself in a familiar place that he had been in the past.

‘The Deadlands?’ William thought as he glanced at his surroundings.

He was currently standing on top of the Glory Shelter, and staring at the same scenery that he had seen when he first came to that strange world that floated within the void.

“Congratulations, Will.”

A pair of soft and delicate hands wrapped around the Half-Elf, as the familiar voice spoke behind him.

“Just a little more, and we can meet. Make sure to take care of Erinys because she is one of the ladies that will lead you to me.”

“When is the right time?” William asked without turning his head. The only thing he did was hold onto the young lady’s arms that were wrapped on his waist, holding her in place.

“When the time is right.”

“Stop talking in circles.”

The young lady giggled, but didn’t say anything else. She just rested her head against his back, feeling the coldness of his body that had been deprived of blood for many days.

“Now is not the time to meet. You still have things to do, and an angry wife to pacify. Once that is over, come and find me. I will be waiting for you.”

As soon as those words were spoken, the Half-Elf turned around to look at the person whom he hadn’t seen for a long time.

However, before he could even look at her, the lady behind him had already turned into countless white feathers, and flew towards the sky.

“Not yet, Will.”

The mischievous voice said in a teasing manner.

It was also at that moment when the world around William disappeared.

All that was left to him was a promise of reunion, as well as a wish that needed to be fulfilled.

The image of the lady in his head also disappeared, as if it was just a fleeting dream, but her voice, as well as her touch lingered within his consciousness, making him wake up.

As soon as William opened his eyes, the first thing he saw was a sleeping Erinys’ who was drooling on his pajama shirt. He could no longer remember the dream he just had, but for some reason, a part of him was looking forward to meeting HER again.

The Half-Elf sighed as he set aside his dream for the time being. Using the blanket, he wiped the drool-stained face of the Halfling in his arms.

‘I don’t need to wait for the future,’ William thought as he planted a kiss on Erinys’ forehead before closing his eyes so he could return to sleep. ‘It comes soon enough.’

As if responding to William’s kiss, the sleeping Halfling held onto him tighter, while dreaming sweet dreams that she had never been able to dream before within the deathly prison that was called the Underworld.
