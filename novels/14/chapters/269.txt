Chapter 269: A Vessel That Held Limitless Possibilities

Charlotte watched from the side as Carter reached out his hand towards her “little sister”.

However, just as the Professor was about to claim his prize, a sudden knock on the door of his room stopped him in his tracks.

“This is the Knight Commander of the Angorian War Sovereign,” a commanding voice sounded from outside the door. “There is an emergency situation and I am gathering the members of my Knight Order for a mission. I was told that my subordinate, Wendy Armstrong, was seen entering this house. I would like the residents to please cooperate with our Knight Order’s mission.”

Carter frowned because he was once again foiled from having his way with the young noble lady in front of him. However, he was someone who knew when to step back in order to obtain the bigger picture. Wendy was already under his full control. The girl wouldn’t be able to escape even if she wanted to.

‘I guess putting it off for later would[will] make the main dish more delicious,’ Carter thought as he calmed the heat that was surging in his body. He took a step back and glanced at the door before looking back at the dazed girl in front of him.

“Let’s continue this later,” Carter said softly. “Visit me tonight, here in my room. Do you understand?”

“Yes,” Wendy muttered absentmindedly.

Her clouded eyes slowly returned to normal. Wendy blinked as she looked at the professor in front of her and tilted her head in confusion. She couldn’t remember what happened after the professor had asked her to taste the candy. The blonde beauty couldn’t even remember if she had tasted the candy or not.

“Um, about the candy?” Wendy fidgeted. “You were asking me earlier to taste test it right, Professor?”

“Don’t worry. You can come back later and taste as many as you want.” Carter grinned as he crossed his arms over his chest. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“Okay.” Wendy smiled and nodded her head.

Another knock was heard on the door as William’s voice passed through Wendy’s ears.

“Wendy? Are you here?” William asked. “We have an emergency mission. I came to find you.”

Carter walked towards the door and opened it. He then came face to face with the boy who had prevented him from conquering his target.

“I’ve long heard about the Knight Commander’s fame, but I didn’t have the opportunity to make your acquaintance,” Carter extended his hand for a handshake. “I am Professor Carter Aracelli, Third Year Magic Instructor.”

“William,” William replied as he shook the Professor’s hand. “William Von Ainsworth.”

Carter was about to say more when a faint fragrance, that came from the young boy’s body, entered his nose. His pupils shrank in their sockets as he stared directly at the boy’s chest.

“Professor?” William asked. “Is there something wrong?”

“N-No,” Carter stuttered. “It’s a pleasure to meet you, Sir William.”

“Same here, Professor,” William said as he waited for the professor to release his hand. For some reason Carter was holding his hand in a vice-like grip, unwilling to let it go. “Professor. You can let go of me now.”

As if awakening from his daze, Carter awkwardly released Wiliam’s hand and scratched his cheeks. “I’m sorry. It was my first time shaking the hand of a Knight Commander and I lost my composure for a while.”

“I see.” William nodded. “Professor, we really have an urgent mission. If you don’t mind, can you tell me if my subordinate, Wendy, is here?”

Hearing her name, Wendy opened the door wider and showed herself to William.

“I’m here, Will.”

“Let’s go. We need to go on an emergency mission.”

“Understood,” Wendy replied. “Sorry, I have to go now, Big Sister, Professor Carter.”

“Don’t worry about me and do your job properly.” Charlotte waved at her.

“Be safe and may the Gods watch over the two of you.” Carter pressed his fist over his chest.

“Thank you.” William and Wendy said at the same time.

Carter and Charlotte even walked the two of them to the front door and gave them one final wave of farewell before returning inside the house.

“Professor, why don’t we return to your room and continue where we left off?” Charlotte proposed in a seductive manner.

“There’s no need to rush, My Love,” Carter caressed the side of her face before giving her a kiss. “Handle your duties first and return here tonight. I suddenly remembered that I needed to do something important.”

A look of disappointment flashed over Charlotte’s face, but she still accepted Carter’s excuse. “I will return tonight then.”

“Good. I love you.”

“I love you too, Professor.”

The two shared a passionate kiss before parting ways.

Carter returned to his room in a hurry and closed the door behind him. His hand was trembling in excitement and there was a look of joy in his eyes.

“God’s essence! That was definitely God’s Essence!” Carter’s eyes went bloodshot when he remembered the subtle power that pulsed within William’s chest. “To think that I would find someone with God’s Essence in this kingdom, and he seems to be completely oblivious of it! What a waste!”

Carter’s handsome face contorted as he paced around his room. “I can’t be wrong. That is definitely the scent of God Essence and it is stronger than the one that the Princess possesses.”

In the past, he had encountered the same feeling when he was introduced to the Princess of the Demon Race. The Demon Princess was hailed as one of the Seven Deadly Sins and the God Essence inside her had the power to devour anything in existence.

‘What should I do?’ Carter thought as he paced around the room. ‘Should I report this?’

Carter immediately rejected this idea. Only a fool would report such a find to his superior and he was not stupid. Since he was the one who found it, he would claim it for himself and not share it with anyone!

“I need to rethink my strategy,” Carter muttered. “The current one is no good… wait! That girl Wendy is close to him. I can use her! This is perfect!”

Carter began to laugh as a plan started to form inside his head. “Being a Knight Commander is far superior than being a talented instructor at the Royal Academy. I guess it’s time to switch bodies again.”

The professor grinned evilly. He never thought that he would find the perfect vessel-that held limitless possibilities-in a Kingdom that was assigned to him. Although he felt sorry for betraying his superior’s orders, he was certain that once he got hold of William’s body, no one in the world would be able to stop him.
