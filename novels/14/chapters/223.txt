Chapter 223: Until The Bitter End

William sensed killing intent headed in his direction and immediately woke up. He lifted Ragnar by the scruff on his neck and gently placed him on the ground while he held Dia firmly with his other hand.

Ella raised her head and looked in the three-o’clock direction.

There, three very infuriated young men, who looked exactly like each other, stormed towards him.

William frowned because he didn’t recognize the three of them. What confused him more was that the three were seriously releasing killing intent and it made him wonder if he had somehow offended them.

“Are you the brat that is lusting over my beautiful little sister?!”

“Are you the brat that is planning to train my little sister to become your plaything?!”

“Are you the brat that is thinking of doing THIS and THAT with my little sister?!

“No. No, and no,” William answered. “Are you talking about Amelia?”

The three boys ignored his reply and glared at William hatefully.

“What?! You’re not lusting over my beautiful little sister?!”

“What?! You’re not planning to train my little sister to become your plaything?!'”

“What?! You’re not thinking of doing THIS and THAT with my little sister?!”

“”Unforgivable!”” the three boys replied in unison. “”Are you saying my little sister is not good enough for you? DIE!””

The three boys summoned their weapons and simultaneously attacked William. The latter activated his movement technique to dodge their attacks by a hair’s breadth. He also summoned his staff to parry their blows from time to time.

Although the three were good fighters, their attack patterns were too straightforward and easy to read. Even so, William had to admit that their teamwork was quite formidable. If not for his mastery over his movement technique, he might have experienced difficulties in dealing with three opponents at the same time.

‘Are they attacking me because I said “No” to their earlier accusations?’ William pondered as he parried a heavy blow that sent him skidding a few meters away.

“I lied earlier,” the Half-Elf said to the three boys. “In fact, I think Amelia is very beautiful. I would love to try doing THIS and THAT with her!”

The three boys paused in their attacks which made William breathe a sigh of relief.

“Now you reveal your true colors.”

“Now you reveal that you are indeed a lecherous bastard.”

“Now you reveal that you want to do THIS and THAT with our little sister.”

“”Unforgivable!””

The triplets attacked William once again, but this time, their attacks were more frenzied than before.

William’s lips twitched as he parried and dodged their relentless assault. There was only one thing on his mind and that was to “Fcking beat the sh*t” out of these siscon bastards.

‘System…’

[ I know… Monk job class, right? ]

‘Yes, please.’

Soon, yells filled with pain and b*tthurt resounded throughout the residence. The male servants who heard these screams subconsciously placed their hands behind their back to protect their bums from being stabbed.

Amelia, Philip, and Sofia rushed outside of the house when they heard the screams, only to find an enraged William beating the crap out of the triplets who dared to disturb his sleep.

“You siscons! Do you want me to do THIS and THAT with your sister or not?!” William roared. “Make up your goddamn minds!”

He then stabbed his staff forward to hit the three boys’ “chrysanthemums” with deadly accuracy. The boys howled in pain like pigs being slaughtered and begged William for forgiveness.

Amelia, who heard William’s words, almost did a double take because she didn’t fully understand what he meant with his words.

William was about to keep hitting the older boys when he noticed Amelia, and her parents, approaching his location.

He promptly hid the staff behind his back, while giving a swift kick to the older boy’s bum, that was closest to his feet.

“Lord Philip, I found these three suspicious individuals in your residence and decided to apprehend them for questioning,” William said in a righteous voice.

He then urged the system to change his job class back to the Sun Knight before the three people reached his location.

William’s body seemed to glisten under the sunlight, as a peaceful smile-that belonged to a priest without sin-appeared on his face. He looked so holy, so amiable, that even Philip felt like he was looking at a different person.

“Um, Commander, these three are my older brothers,” Amelia commented as she walked in front of the three groaning men under William’s feet.

“I see.” William nodded sagely. “I apologize for hurting them. I was not aware that they were your brothers, I’m sorry.”

William’s aura was so divine that Amelia, Philip, and Sofia felt that they were sinners in front of him.

William’s passive skill “Aura of the Sun”, and “Smile of the Sun”, was a combo passive skill that made Sun Knights get along with anyone. When these two skills were active, the Sun Knight’s charisma would reach a very high level that even a crying baby would stop crying when they saw William’s smiling face.

“N-No. It was their fault for assaulting the Commander,” Amelia replied. “I promise that I will talk to them later, so, can you please forgive them?”

“What is there to not forgive? This was all a misunderstanding. I don’t particularly mind.” William chuckled before stepping on the hand that was about to grab his foot from below. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Aaron was about to shout, but Amelia’s glare made him stop in his tracks. The pitiful older brother could only bite his lip in frustration as he endured the pain he was currently experiencing.

“Commander, why don’t we go inside the house?” Sofia proposed. “We have many special delicacies prepared for you.”

William was reluctant to go because of the experience points that he could gain from sunbathing. Even so, he still decided to nod his head and smile like a good boy before he followed Sofia towards the residence.

The Titanic Green-Scaled Trollhound looked back at the Barony of Bradford one last time before giving a low growl. The hundreds of Trollhounds that followed behind it followed its orders obediently.

They were now headed towards the North, where the tribes lived. Since it was “technically” not part of the Hellan Kingdom, the Titanic Trollhound decided to go there to seek new prey. It intended to recover its strength first and raise its ranks before finding William to find trouble with him.

Just like the red-headed boy, the Titanic Trollhound was a beast that held grudges. It hated Humans to the core and would find no greater pleasure than to feast on their flesh. The giant beast still regretted the fact that it was not able to kill all of those who had experimented on him and held him in captivity.

At the last minute, half of them were able to escape while he broke free from the seals that they had placed on his body.

‘I will find all of you bastards and make you pay for what you did to me,’ the Titanic Trollhound vowed in his heart. ‘After that, I will deal with you next, William Von Ainsworth…’

The hundreds of Trollhounds left the borders of Bradford and the Humans that saw them along the way almost panicked when they met them along their journey towards the other towns and cities.

Merchant caravans and commoners, who were traveling the roads that they passed, collapsed in fear when the horde of monsters appeared before them.

Although the Trollhounds were salivating at the sight of helpless prey, they couldn’t attack any of them because of the powerful restriction that had been placed on their bodies.

Using the power of the God of Contracts, William made sure that they would not be able to break their word. If they did, they would combust into flames, leaving only ashes behind. The ordinary Trollhounds may not be able to survive this oath, but the Titanic Trollhound was different.

With its rank, and near-immortality, William’s contract didn’t scare it one bit. The only reason why it was honoring its oath was due to a nagging fear that was coming from its very being. For some reason, it felt afraid.

Afraid that if it broke its word, it would suffer a fate worse than death.

The Titanic Trollhound didn’t want to take its chances and break the oath. He still wanted to take revenge on those that had experimented on, and tortured, it everyday to “test” its regeneration ability. It refused to die until its revenge was fulfilled.

This was the sole meaning of its existence and it was determined to carry it out until the bitter end.
