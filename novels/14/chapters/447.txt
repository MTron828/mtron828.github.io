“I never thought that your true form would be this awesome,” William said as he sat on top of the Taotie that was flying towards the borders of the Hellan Kingdom.

Jekyll increased his speed because he wasn’t sure if the Qilin and Ancient Earth Golem would still pursue them after William’s destructive attack.

“And I never thought that you’d have this kind of trump card hidden in your sleeve,” Jekyll replied. “I’m guessing that you can’t use this ability as you please, right? There has to be some kind of restriction.”

Jekyll was quite thankful that William appeared when he did. He wasn’t sure that he would have been able to escape from the Qilin and the Ancient Golem’s combination attack if Wiliam hadn’t come to his rescue.

“By the way, how were you able to arrive at my location that quickly?” Shouldn’t you be in the far South?”

“If I told you that I could travel at the speed of lightning, would you believe me?”

“I have no choice but to believe you at this point. But, how were you able to pinpoint my exact location?” Jekyll inquired.

William scratched his cheeks because he actually didn’t know that Jekyll was in danger. He just felt that there was a powerful lightning storm somewhere in the Zelan Dynasty and he immediately went there to bathe in lightning bolts to increase his rank.

There are many ways to level up the different Job Classes. For example, his Sun Knight required him to bathe in the sunlight to increase its level. Even if William killed a million monsters, the Sun Knight Job Class wouldn’t gain any experience points from it.

The Prince of Thunder gained experience points from killing monsters. However, the most efficient way to raise its rank was to absorb the power of a lightning storm.

Although William could travel at the speed of lightning, he could only do this twice a day. It was one of the cheat-like abilities that was available in his Prince of Thunder Job Class.

“I felt a very powerful lightning storm coming from the North, so I decided to investigate,” William replied after careful consideration. “Since the weather of the Southern Continent is fixed to this gloomy, and cloudy state, such sudden changes meant that something abnormal was happening.”

Jekyll nodded his head. Although WIlliam’s explanation had holes in it, he decided not to pry because everyone was entitled to their own secrets.

“Did you manage to destroy the Teleportation Gate?” William asked.

Jekyll sighed. “No. If it was only that stuck-up Eneru then I could have dealt with him, but that Ancient Golem, Drauum, was a heavyweight that I couldn’t handle in such a closed off space.”

William also sighed internally because their main objective wasn’t met. They purposely allowed themselves to be seen when they entered the borders of the Zelan Dynasty. They headed South to trick the Elves into thinking that they were heading to the Sanctuary of the Minotaur Race.

Halfway in their journey, William and Erchitu continued South while Jekyll, and the others headed North, using the hidden teleportation gates that only the members of the Royal Family of the Zelan Dynasty were aware of.

Crown Prince Alaric had led the Alliance towards the Northern Regions with stealth, so they wouldn’t alert any of the Elves that were scattered to the several outposts in the Zelan Dynasty. Their plan had been flawless, but unfortunately, some unforeseen events transpired.

William was about to say something else when he received a message from Ezio through their special means of communication.

The Half-Elf had a complicated look on his face as he shared this piece of news with Jekyll.

“The Teleportation Gate has been destroyed,” William said. “The Ant Warriors and several Saints from the Kraetor Empire dug a tunnel underground and attacked when the two Guardian Beasts were busy pursuing you.”

“Oh?” Jekyll couldn’t hide the surprise in its tone after hearing William’s report. A few moments later, he chuckled wryly because he realized that they had unknowingly played the role of bait and cannon fodder that led to the Kraetor Army’s Coup de Grace.

“This leaves a bad aftertaste.”

“Look at the bright side. At least, we no longer have to worry about the Teleportation Gate.”

Jekyll grunted when he heard William’s optimistic reply. The Taotie had no choice but to agree that although their mission was a failure, their main objective had been achieved at the same time.

“So, what happened to your mission?” Jekyll inquired. “Did you manage to eliminate any of their high-ranking officers?”

William shook his head. “Just some small fries. The big fish got away, but I managed to kill more than a thousand Elves.”

In truth, William would have liked to kill all the Elves that had accompanied Elandorr to the domain of the Minotaurs, but Skyla stopped him from wiping them out completely.

Skyla was still his mother’s Beast Companion, so she couldn’t stand by and watch William massacre all the Elves in front of her. Because of this, William compromised and spared those that had surrendered to him.

He knocked all of them unconscious and tossed them at the newly bought Prison from the Godshop that he had placed on the Thirty Sixth Floor of the Goblin Crypt.

William had closed off the entire floor, so even if the Elves escaped, they wouldn’t be able to leave without his permission.

Surprisingly, he found one Human boy amongst them and placed him in a separate cell. He had no time to interrogate the boy earlier because he had felt the disturbance in the weather that was happening in the North of the Zelan Dynasty.

William had already used his Appraisal Skill on the boy and learned his name. He knew who he was because Prince Alaric and Paul had told him the name of the Top Prodigy of their Dynasty.

The Half-Elf had also discovered the slave collar on the teenager’s neck. Because of this, he decided not to take any chances and imprisoned him for the time being.

‘I’ll just wait until we have crossed the borders of the Hellan Kingdom,’ William thought.

The red-headed boy suddenly remembered the beautiful Princess of the Kingdom of Freesia. They had not communicated with each other ever since she left the Kyrintor Mountains. William didn’t know if their alliance still stood because they seemed to have parted on bad terms with each other.

Even so, he was quite thankful that the Princess, who had asked him for his babies, had made her move during the critical moment. If not for her, the threat of the Elves would still remain like a sharp blade hanging over all of their necks that could fall off at any given moment.

‘I will thank her personally later,’ William thought. ‘For now, I still need to deal with the aftermath of this operation.’

Jekyll had already told William that their side had suffered several casualties during the clash with the Elves. William was also thankful that Jekyll had acted the way he did in order to save everyone’s lives.

If not for Jekyll’s decisive action, William might have lost more than some of the members of his Legion. He could have lost people that held great importance in his life.
