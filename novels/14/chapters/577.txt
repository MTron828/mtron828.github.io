Chapter 577: Kawabangga Motherf*ckers! [Part 2]

The Demi-Turtles walked towards William’s location with calm expressions on their faces. As Oogwei’s disciples, they used their strong will power to prevent themselves from stuffing their faces with the unknown dish that William had made for them.

“This is Kawabangga Pizza?” Leonardude asked. “Well, I’ll give you a passing grade for the presentation. However, the most important part is the taste.”

William nodded his head as he cut the pizza into several slices. After he was done, he took a slice and gave it to Oogwei, the next slice he gave to Chiffon.

The Half-Elf took the third and ate it in front of everyone.

Leonardude gulped and hurriedly took a pizza slice to eat. The other Demi-turtles didn’t want to be left out and secured their own.

The moment the pizza entered their mouths, they tasted an explosion of flavors that put them into a daze. William smirked because he got the intended effect that he wanted.

Before Leonardude could even recover his senses, William took advantage of the situation and asked him a question.

“Is it good?” William asked.

“It is the best!” Leonardude replied.

“Did we pass?”

“You did!”

The moment Leonardude gave his approval, the Demi-Turtle realized that he had fallen into William’s trap.

The Half-Elf grinned and offered the regretful turtle another pizza slice, which the latter gobbled up in fury.

“This is good,” Oogwei stated. “Can you give me a recipe?”

“Of course,” William replied. “But on one condition.”

Oogwei smiled. It knew that William was planning something, but it didn’t know what it was. As a Guardian, there were certain things that it could and couldn’t do while it was inside the Tower. However, he was also curious about what kind of condition the red-headed teenager wanted to ask of him.

“Earlier, you said that the Agnis Family will probably hunt us down, and make our climb in the tower difficult, right?” William looked at the Guardian of the Third Floor with a serious expression.

Oogwei nodded its head. “Right.”

“Can you prevent them from following us?”

“I can’t. Guardians are not allowed to harm any player within the Tower.

William sighed before he picked up the pizza that Chiffon had made, and placed it inside the oven to bake. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

The Demi-turtles glanced at each other. After tasting William’s pizza, they had a feeling that they wouldn’t be able to live without it. In order to satisfy this craving, they had to get William’s recipe and the weird looking Oven in his possession.

“Master may not be able to do it, but we can,” Michaelangelhoe stated. “However, we cannot leave the Third Floor. The only thing we could do is deal with them on this floor.”

“That’s right.” Donutella nodded. “The players in the tower could return to any floor that they wanted, as long as they were able to clear it. Even if you deal with your pursuers on this floor, they could still jump to the Fourth Floor in order to hunt the two of you down.”

William listened to the Demi-turtles’ explanation with a frown. They had made an enemy of the Agnis Family that ruled the Second Floor of the Tower. Since they were one of the major forces in Babylon, they could send their lackeys to prevent William and Chiffon from climbing higher.

Although William wasn’t afraid of conflict, he was not fond of being chased by mercenaries from behind.

Seeing the frown on William’s face, Narnyah decided to offer a solution.

“I have an idea,” Narnyah commented from the side. “We can capture those pursuers for you and hold them here for a short period of time. Unfortunately, we are not allowed to kill the players, so this is the most we can do for you.”

Oogwei listened as it ate its pizza in peace. It had already felt the members of the Agnis Family enter his domain, but they were spawned at the bottom of the valley where the trial town was located. It would take them some time to track William’s and Chiffon’s whereabouts.

“The fighters of the Agnis Family have arrived,” Oogwei announced. “Looks like you made the Patriarch angry with your rejection. He didn’t bat an eye and sent forty experts to hunt you down. According to the standards in this world, they have sent fifteen Mithril Rankers, ten Black Rankers, and one Saint.”

William scratched his head in irritation, “What a pain.”

“Like my Disciples said earlier, we can keep them here for a time. Since they have already cleared this place once, they can come and go as they pleased,” Oogwei explained. “My domain is big, so it will take considerable time for them to find you.

“My Disciples’ offer still stands. Although they cannot kill players, they can beat them up and detain them for a time. What do you want to do?”

William crossed his arms over his chest and pondered. A few minutes later, he opened his eyes and asked Oogwei a question.

“Xod said that he has the authority to send us to a higher floor in the tower,” William said. “Can you do that, too?”

Oogwei nodded its head. “I can send you up to the 9th Floor. However, the ruling family there is similar to the Agnis Family. Since you have passed my test, I can send you there anytime you want. Do you want me to send you there, right now?”

William shook his head. “Not now. However, I will ask this favor later.”

The Half-Elf looked down at the Trial Town below the cliff. He decided to get rid of their pursuers now rather than deal with them at a later time.

Inside the Trial Town…

“Have you seen them?”

“No, Sir.”

“Keep looking! You need to find them as soon as possible!” Byron, the High-Ranker of the Agnis Family, ordered.

Inside the tower, those that had the rank of Saints were referred to as High-Rankers. They were the epitome of strength, and not many could face them in battle. Every ruling family in the tower had at least one of these powerful fighters under their wing.

They were the so-called deterrence to keep everyone in line and not make trouble for the families that ruled the floors that they owned.

Byron didn’t feel embarrassed about hunting down two teenagers because this was his job. The Agnis Family had paid him a hefty amount of Tokens that allowed him to reach his rank after forming a binding contract with them.

“That fool missed a golden opportunity,” Byron snorted. “If he only agreed to the Agnis Family, he would definitely become a High-Ranker after three to four years.”

Right after Byron said these words, he heard a chuckle behind his back.

“Three to four years to reach Sainthood?” a red-headed teenager said in disdain. “Too slow. Now I understand why you’re already this old before you became a High-Ranker. You don’t have the qualifications to be one, so you used a shortcut to become a Saint.”

The teenager curled up his lips as if mocking Byron’s talents.

“It’s you!” Byron stood up and lunged at the boy. Although William had ridiculed him, he didn’t let it go to his head and prioritized the boy’s capture. The warriors of the Agnis Family also recognized the Half-Elf and joined their leader in subjugating him.

William stood still and only smirked at the Saint, and his men, who were only a few meters away from him.

Byron was just about to punch the boy’s chest when something golden appeared in his vision. The next thing he knew, he was hurtling towards the ground with blood seeping out of its mouth.

The same thing happened to his subordinates, but they got it worse than Byron because their ranks were lower than him.

The High-Ranker wiped the blood from the side of his lips as he raised his head to look at William, who was holding a golden-metallic rod in his hand.

“Kawabangga, Motherf*ckers!”

The Half-Elf sneered as he prepared to annihilate the hunters who now became the hunted. William had long known when to show mercy and when to eradicate the problem at its root. The only reason why he couldn’t confront the Agnis Family directly was because they had formed a contract with the Guardian of the Second Floor.

The moment someone attacked the members of their family, the Guardian would appear and deal with the threat to honor the contract. Because of this, the ruling family of each floor enjoyed unchallengeable safety in their own domains.

Each Guardian was equivalent to a Demigod, so William didn’t want to fight them in a head-on battle.

William might not be able to fight against a Demigod, but fighting against a Saint, and his lackeys, was not a big deal for him when he used his Heroic Avatar.

The Patriarch of the Agnis Family thought that the forces he sent to hunt down William and Chiffon were more than enough to capture two brats. He even thought that it was overkill.

If he only knew William’s true identity then he might have turned a blindeye on the incident that happened in his domain, and let bygones be bygones.

Unfortunately, he didn’t know. And this was why the subordinates, whom he had sent to seize the two teenagers, were never heard from again.
