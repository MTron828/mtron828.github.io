Chapter 522: I Will Never Do Anything Shameless

“You’re a girl, so you should take better care of yourself,” Princess Sidonie said as she scrubbed Chiffon’s body with her soapy hand.

They were currently inside the Princess’ own dormitory room, and were taking a bath together.

After hearing William’s explanation, Ian and Princess Sidonie felt pity for Chiffon and decided to look after her for the time being. They had just finished their dinner, and the Princess took Chiffon to her room because the little girl couldn’t possibly spend the night inside William’s room.

Chiffon allowed herself to be cleaned thoroughly like an obedient child. It had been a long time since she had taken a proper bath. Usually, she just swam in the river near the academy to clean her body.

Half an hour later, the two girls left the bath wearing bath towels. Princess Sidonie helped Chiffon dry her hair, after drying hers.

The Princess had also given Chiffon a change of clothes, while her maidservants negotiated with the Academy for new and clean Academy Uniforms that Chiffon would wear the next day.

After the little girl had donned her nightdress, she looked at Princess Sidonie with a curious expression.

“What is your relationship with Big Brother?” Chiffon asked.

Even though she had only met Princess Sidonie for the first time today, Chiffon had already sensed the divinity inside the princess’ body that represented the Sin of Lust.

“I am Will’s fiance,” Princess Sidonie replied with a smile. “That means that he will be my husband in the future.”

Princess Sidonie wanted to make it clear that William and her were lovers. This was her way of telling Chiffon that she shouldn’t have any ideas about approaching her lover.

“Does he know?” Chiffon inquired. “Have you told him about your Sin?”

Princess Sidonie nodded. “Yes.”

The Princess hesitated whether she should tell Chiffon that William also knew the Sin that the little girl carried. However, after careful consideration, she decided to hold back this information as she first assessed Chiffon’s character.

[ It is better to be safe than sorry. Darling is weak against children. ]

Morgana commented from inside their shared mindscape.

‘Yes. this is also the thing that worries me,’ Princess Sidonie replied. ‘I just hope that she won’t take advantage of Will’s kindness.’

[ Hmp! Let’s see her try. I’ll spank her bum to oblivion! ]

Princess Sidonie covered her lips and giggled. ‘We’ll just observe for now. I don’t want you to do anything reckless. Do you understand?”

[ Fine~ ]

Chiffon observed the beautiful girl in front of her. The little girl’s eyes then wandered down on Princess Sidonie’s chest. After taking a good look at the princess’ assets, the adorable loli glanced at her own chest and sighed internally.

After a while, Chiffon once again raised her head and asked Princess Sidonie a direct question.

“Did you use your charm on him?” Chiffon inquired.

Although she could see that Princess Sidonie was very beautiful, she still asked just in case the Princess had used her charm to make William her fiance. Chiffon considered William to be her first friend.

Because of this, she would do everything in her power to free him if he was under the Princess’ Charm. Also, William was able to make those delicious lollipops that were able to keep her hunger at bay.

If possible, Chiffon wanted William to give her an unlimited supply of candy everyday.

“I did use my power on him,” Princess Sidonie answered. “However, Will is resistant to my charms.”

The corner of Chiffon’s lips raised by a millimeter after hearing that William wasn’t affected by the power of Princess Sidonie’s Charm. This made her impression of the boy, whom she referred to as Big Brother, have a bigger presence inside her mind.

“Listen, I don’t mind if you become his friend, but don’t abuse his kindness,” Princess Sidonie stated. “Don’t get any ideas. Do you understand?”

Chiffon’s expression remained calm as she kept her silence. Whatever she was thinking at that moment, the beautiful princess, and her other half, had no idea whatsoever.

“Where did you come from?” Princess Sidonie asked. “You’re not from the Kraetor Empire, right?”

Chiffon shook her head. “I was born in the Demon Continent. However, my father cast me aside and asked his subordinate to bring me here.”

Princess Sidonie frowned. She didn’t know that the Emperor of the Kraetor Empire and the reigning Demon King had a complicated relationship.

‘Maybe I should do a little investigation about this matter,’ Princess Sidonie thought as she stared at the little girl, who was currently licking one of William’s lollipops.

She didn’t know why, but her intuition was telling her that Chiffon would bring a lot of problems if she were to continue interacting with William. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“My granddaughter has taken Chiffon to her room?” Emperor Leonidas looked at one of his trusted subordinates that was currently serving as Princess Sidonie’s maidservant. Her duty was to give regular reports to the Emperor if something unusual happened to, or around, the Princess.

“Yes, Your Majesty,” the pretty lady bowed her head. “They have just finished taking a bath, and seemed to be having a chat with each other. It is quite unfortunate that I can’t spy on their conversation because the Princess will get mad if she senses my presence.”

Emperor Leonidas rubbed his chin as he listened to the rest of his subordinate’s report.

“Continue to monitor them, but don’t get too close. It doesn’t matter if you don’t hear their conversation.”

“Yes, Your Majesty.”

“Are you feeling better?” Ashe asked.

“Much better,” William said as he held her in an embrace.

The two had gone to the Beach Villa on the Tenth Floor of the Dungeon of Atlantis, right after they finished having dinner with Princess Sidonie and Chiffon.

For some reason, William refrained from eating food right after he drank someone’s blood. The reason for this was due to the fact that everything he ate tasted like burnt food that resembled charcoal.

This abnormality in William’s taste would usually fade away a day after he had quenched his blood thirst.

Contrary to what William expected, Chiffon ate with restraint just like a proper noble lady. The sheer contrast between the starved girl, who was about to eat a banana peel in the Garbage Dump, and the prim and proper lady, who was using a knife and fork to eat her steak, made William breath a sigh of relief in his heart.

“That girl, Chiffon… what do you intend to do with her?” Ashe asked while softly caressing the jewel that was embedded in William’s chest.

“I’ll ask Sidonie to take care of her for the time being,” William replied. “If it’s her, I’m sure that everything will be fine.”

“Will it truly be fine?”

“Of course. Sidonie is the Emperor’s Granddaughter. I doubt that anyone would make trouble for her.”

Ashe closed her eyes as she continued to caress the jewel in William’s chest. She had seen the stares of the students when they saw Chiffon walking alongside Princess Sidonie, on their way to the dining hall.

Surprise, envy, and disgust, painted their faces. Ashe was well aware that those three emotions could lead to problems for the Princess, who was currently visiting her Grandfather’s empire. Although there might be no problems in the short term, no one could predict what would happen in the long term.

William had been with Ashe for a long time, so he could understand her thought process.

“Understood.” William planted a kiss on his lover’s forehead. “During the day, I’ll take care of Chiffon. Since both of us are outcasts, it will be best if the two of us stick together. Keep your ears perked up for any rumors that will spread in regards to Sidonie. I’ll handle the rest. By the way, have you heard of any good dungeons nearby?”

Ashe’s body stiffened when her lover mentioned the word dungeon. She didn’t need to be a genius to understand what the shameless Shepherd was thinking right now.

“Are we going with Plan B?” Ashe asked as she raised her head to look into William’s eyes.

William lightly poked her nose as a mischievous smile appeared on his face. “What Plan B? Your lover is an upright and outstanding individual. I will never do anything shameless.”

Ashe rolled her eyes because she was very tempted to smack the smug expression on William’s face. Aside from the Half-Elf’s grandfather, James, she had not seen anyone more shameless than him.

Back in the Southern Continent, William had stolen resources in the Anaesha Dynasty, right under the Kraetor Army’s nose.

She was sure that if William felt like it, he would also do the same thing to the Kraetor Empire if they made him angry.
