Chapter 545: Your Daughter’s Lover Is A Good Person

The Seventh-Circle Spell was designed to capture the souls of anyone in its path.

A seven-meter tall apparition of an Astral Worm appeared in front of Augustus. It then opened its mouth as it sucked greedily to absorb the souls of the three teenagers in front of it.

Ian felt her spiritual world tremble as the Soul Devourer skill passed through her. She had given half of her heart to William, so her Spiritual World’s defenses were also cut in half. Although she had a very high-resistance to Soul Attacks, a Seventh-Circle Spell was nothing to sneeze at.

William was about to decimate the Astral Worm using his Life Mage Job Class when a determined shout reverberated in the air.

“N-No!” Chiffon cried out. “I won’t let you hurt my friends!”

Chiffon stood in front of Ian who was already kneeling on the ground and doing her best to keep her soul from leaving her body.

The pink-haired girl opened her mouth as wide as she could. It was at that moment when the air around her trembled, and a powerful suction force collided with the Astral Worm’s own devouring power.

It was then when something unbelievable happened. The Astral Worm’s apparition shrieked in fright as a powerful force pulled its body towards the little girl.

William, who saw this scene, wasn’t too surprised because he already knew what Chiffon was capable of. He even laughed internally as he lunged towards Augustus to give him a world of pain.

He wasn’t too worried about Chiffon when it came to a battle of Devourers. Challenge the Sin of Gluttony to an eating contest? They must be out of their mind!

Just as William expected, the Astral Worm was sucked up by the pink-haired girl’s little mouth, until nothing was left.

Augustus didn’t expect this outcome, so he was a second late in raising his guard to block William’s punch that was headed right into his chest.

A loud clap resounded as William’s fist dug into August’s chest that sent him smashing towards the ground. The punch that William did was not an ordinary punch, but a punch that he had not used for a very long time.

It was the Monk Skill, Overwhelming Strike, that he used to beat the Sword Saint’s Disciple and the pompous noble that had a crush on Rebecca.

[ Overwhelming Strike ]

(Needs 5 Skill Points to unlock)

— Once a day you can deliver one full-powered unarmed strike that contains all of your strength.

— Damage dealt is equivalent to your Strength Stat multiplied by 20.

William’s attack was so strong that a seven-meter-wide crater appeared in the ground where Augustus’ body laid. The purple-haired man’s eyes had rolled on its sockets, and blood spilled at the corner of his lips.

The Half-Elf held back a bit to ensure that the Demon wouldn’t die because he planned to torture him slowly.

William turned his head to see how the others were faring, and saw Kasogonaga and Psoglav slapping the face of the last conscious mercenary in the six-man group.

Ian and Chiffon were both unharmed, and were currently looking at Augustus, who was sprawled on the ground.

William smiled and walked towards the little girl with a smile.

“You did well,” William said as he patted Chiffon’s head. He then shifted his attention to Ian who seemed eager to kick the half-dead man on the ground because of what he had done to her.

“You, too, Ian. Thank you for protecting Chiffon,” William pulled Ian close to him and whispered something in her ears. “Don’t worry, I will let you torture him later. Make sure to pay him back a hundredfold for hurting you.”

Ian gave William a very rare evil smile that didn’t match her personality. It just showed how much his mermaid lover resented the man who had barged in on their peaceful stroll in the garden.

When William was thinking of how to smuggle the six unconscious men to his Thousand Beast Domain, the Headmaster of Silverwind Academy, along with some of the Professors, arrived at the garden.

Gilbert sighed when he saw the damage that William’s battle had caused. The Garden was one of the most famous attractions of their Academy. However, more than half of it had been destroyed, and had been turned into scorched Earth.

“What do you have to say for yourself, Young Man?” Gilbert asked as he looked at William’s direction. He had the strong urge to pull the Half-Elf’s long ears until the teenage boy cried out in pain.

“Took you long enough,” William replied in a casual manner.

Gilbert found himself unable to reply to William’s reply. He had been informed days ago about the six mercenaries that had come to perform their regular check on Chiffon’s lifestyle in the Academy.

This life-style check had been going on for more than a year already, and the Headmaster had turned a blind eye on it due to the agreement that the Kraetor Empire had with the Demon Continent.

William snorted and summoned a water whip to tie up Augustus’ body, along with his men. He was about to drag them away when Gilbert stepped in to stop him.

“We will take over from here,” Gilbert said in a firm manner. “This falls under our jurisdiction.”

“What if I refuse?” William asked back. He used his question to stall for time while the System put some trackers on the six men, so that the Half-Elf could hunt them down later.

[ Host, trackers have been successfully planted on their bodies. ]

‘Thank you,’ William replied. He had spent six hundred God Points to ensure that no matter where the six men went, William would know exactly where they were.

“What do you want?” Gilbert asked in irritation. Not only did he have to deal with the damages that had been made to the Academy’s garden, he also needed to bribe the Half-Elf who was defying his authority.

“I want them dead.”

“Sorry, that’s not possible.”

“Alright, then give me Six Centennial Beast Cores instead. If you do that, I will let them live.” William proposed.

Gilbert frowned and held up two fingers. “Two Centennial Cores.”

WIlliam shook his head. “Not only did these men hurt three students of your Academy, they also scared my two dumb pets.”

William pointed at B1, and B2, who was perched on top of two of the six mens’ heads.

“These Motherf*ckers scared the sh*t out of me!” B1 shouted in an aggrieved tone. “I will sue your Academy for Emotional Trauma!”

B2, raised its head in an arrogant manner as it lifted its claw. “Just look at my pinky claw, I can’t raise it up due to how scared I am. You old f*cker better take responsibility, or else you’ll talk to my lawyer!”

Gilbert had the very strong urge to hurl a fireball at the two dumb birds to roast them completely.

What Emotional Trauma?

Can’t raise a Pinky Claw?

If anyone needed to sue someone due to Emotional Trauma it would be no one else but him!

“Three Centennial Cores. That is my final offer,” Gilbert said as flames danced on the tip of his fingertips.

B1, and B2, hadn’t stopped hurling profanities in the Headmaster’s direction calling him “Old Motherf*cker” and other vulgar words that pushed Gilbert to the limits of his tolerance.

“Fine,” William agreed before the old man snapped and roast the two dumb birds to the afterlife. “Pay upfront or no deal.”

Gilbert took three Centennial Cores from his storage ring and shoved them into William’s hands. The Half-Elf took them and stored the Beast Cores inside his storage ring before holding Ian, and Chiffon’s hand, leading them back to the Boy’s Dormitory.

The three students left without a word. Psoglav, and the Rainbow Birds returned to the Thousand Beast Domain, while Kasogonaga once again rode on top of the Dragon’s Head.

Kasogonaga was currently the King of the Bestiary in the Third Grade Division. The rainbow-colored Anteater intended to brainwash all the Magical Beasts that belonged to the students of the Academy to become its followers.

Gilbert watched William’s entourage leave with a sigh. He then kicked one of the tied up men who had just regained consciousness to vent out his anger. The pitiful man once again lost his consciousness as his eyes rolled up into their sockets.

“Take them and lock them up properly!” Gilbert ordered. “I am going to see his Majesty!”

The Headmaster of Silverwind Academy didn’t even bother to give the six mercenaries a second glance as he left to return to his office. He knew that Evexius was planning to deal with the mercenaries after they had left their territory. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

However, William had already done the deed which complicated things. If this matter wasn’t resolved properly then several problems might arise regarding the relationship of the Kraetor Empire and the Demon Continent.

Somewhere in the Temple of the Ten Thousand Gods…

“Eros, it seems that your daughter’s lover is a good person,” a fat Goddess said while eating a slice of cake. “You know, although he’s a bit skinny for my taste, I like his personality.”

Lady Eros smiled as she sipped her tea. The Goddess of Gluttony, Adephagia, suddenly appeared in front of her castle, and asked if she could come in for some afternoon tea.

Naturally, Eros invited her in because she was none other than her best friend in the Temple of the Ten Thousand Gods.

What the Erotic Goddess didn’t expect was that Adephagia would come to see her, in order to talk about William. The Fat Goddess kept on asking personal questions like what William liked to eat, or how many lovers the boy had.

It was quite obvious that her good friend wanted to either fatten William up to suit her taste, or help her daughter, Chiffon, make her move on the boy.

Lady Eros was quite supportive of her friend, so she decided to help her out a bit. Whether Chiffon would end up becoming one of William’s nine lovers, was none of her business.

The only thing that mattered to her was the happiness of her daughter, whose power was currently being kept at bay by the Half-Elf who seemed to have caught the attention of another troublesome Goddess.
