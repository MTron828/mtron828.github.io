Chapter 601: From Now On, Your Name Will Be Optimus

William’s and Chiffon’s trial had ended, but the Half-Elf refused to leave the trial grounds.

He and the System were busy thinking of ways that they could smuggle the Gandamn off of the Floor of Creation.

After having a taste of piloting the Giant Robot, William was very reluctant to let it go. He was adamant about finding a way to smuggle, or recreate, the Giant Robot, so that he could use it in the outside world.

The System was currently busy analyzing the Law of Creation that managed the 25th Floor. Although the Gandamn was a fictional thing, William believed that there was a possibility that it could be replicated if one knew how the Laws of Creation worked.

Xanhast had already left the trial grounds along with his unconscious sister, Marissa. He had given up trying to convince William to leave and allow the other players to use the trial grounds.

As a compromise, William took the Giant Robot at the very corner of the vast plains, in order to not get in the way of the trial of others.

Frankly, all the players didn’t mind this setup because they were still busy analyzing William’s robot from afar. They had seen how amazing it was, and even the Patriarch, and Elders of the Colton Family were very interested in it.

[ Host, it is impossible to recreate the Laws of Creation. I checked the database to see if it could be done, but the ability to materialize things out of thin air is only exclusive to this Floor. ]

‘Can we manufacture it then?’

[ No. ]

William was unwilling to give up. He asked the system to check the God Shop if there was any item that they could use to smuggle the robot off of the 25th floor.

After half an hour of searching, the two still couldn’t find a way to make William’s wish come true.

Just as the two were about to give up, the three divinities in William’s consciousness began to glow. A minute later, a small, yet perfect replica of the Gandamn appeared on top of the CPU Core.

The System’s monotonous voice became sharper, and had more life in it. After the changes had been made the Giant Robot faded away, leaving William, and Chiffon, standing right next to each other.

‘System, what happened?’ William asked. For some reason, a sense of anticipation was bubbling inside his chest.

[ The CPU Core has been upgraded to a higher grade. ]

[ Importing all preferences from home interface. ]

The system replied in a tone that reminded William of Aeon Man’s artificial intelligence, Jarveez.

[ Would you like to bestow a name to the System? ]

[ Yes / No ]

William’s eyes widened in shock when he saw the message on his status page.

‘System, do you want me to give you a name?’

[ Affirmative, Host. Please, give me a name. ]

The Half-Elf rubbed his chin as he pondered. The system had been with him since he was young, and it had helped him tremendously in his journey. He had to give it a good name no matter what!

“How about I give you the name The Strongest System?”

[ … Host, please take this seriously. Your naming skills suck btw. ]

William chuckled because not only did the System’s voice changed, its interactions had become more lifelike as well. He liked how snarky it had become.

‘How about Eren?’

[ No. ]

‘Lelouch?’

[ No. ]

‘Saitama?’

[ No. ]

‘Gon.’

[ Rejected. ]

‘Gok-‘

[ No. ]

‘Pikac-‘

[ Host, do you want me to electrocute you? ] Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

William scratched his head. Giving names had not always been easy for him, so he was at a loss on what to do. Suddenly, he remembered Truck-Kun that had hit him during the time when he was about to cross to the silver portal that he had chosen.

Because of this incident, William was born in a world that was not his choosing. Even so, the world he was currently living in had given him a wonderful family, friends, and lovers who truly cared about him.

A smile appeared on William’s face as he looked at the head of the Gandamn Replica that was talking back to him.

‘Optimus,’ William said. ‘From now on, your name will be Optimus.’

[ Optimus…, very well. From now on, you may call me Optimus. ]

[ System has been bestowed a name. ]

[ New features added. ]

[ System’s Completion Rate: 3% ]

— All stats increase by 50 points

— Every time the completion rate reaches a 20% completion marker, all stats will increase by 50 points.

— Once the Completion Rate reaches 100% the system will be able to unlock its true abilities.

— Once the Completion Rate reaches 100% all stats will increase by 1000 points.

— Once the Completion Rate reaches 100% the title “Strongest System” will be unlocked.

——

The additional features caught William completely by surprise. He didn’t expect that his insistence to smuggle the Gandamn would bring out unexpected results.

‘Optimus, how do I increase your completion rate?’ William inquired. He was very keen to raise Optimus’ competition rate as soon as he could. The rewards were quite enticing, and he definitely wouldn’t pass up the opportunity to complete it as soon as possible.

[ I will grow as the host grows stronger. Whenever the host makes a breakthrough, or passes a certain milestone, the completion rate will also increase. ]

‘I see.’ William crossed his arms over his chest.

Chiffon, who was standing beside William was looking at him in confusion. Her Big Brother had been muttering something every now and then as if he was talking to someone. Also, he would nod his head from time to time as if agreeing to something.

Fortunately, before Chiffon could ask if William was fine, the Half-Elf turned his head to look at her.

“Are you ready to go to the next floor?” William asked with a smile.

“Un!” Chiffon nodded.

As soon as the two held hands, both of them transformed into beams of light that shot towards the sky. A new adventure was about to begin, but they were still several floors away from their goal.

William didn’t know how long it would take until they reached the 51st Floor, but he was sure of one thing. Whatever trial was waiting for them there, its difficulty couldn’t compare to the previous floors that they had visited.

After all, no one had cleared it for the past thousand years. Although it didn’t show on his face, William was feeling anxious. The trials they had undertaken seemed simple, but in reality they were not.

Take the Floor of Partings for example.

If William didn’t have the Undying Lands, or the Dungeon of Atlantis, there wouldn’t be a way for him to use the loophole that the Laws of the floor held. Chiffon would have been stuck on the 10th Floor and would have to wait for William to pick her up on her way back from the tower.

The same could be said for the Floor of Creation. Fighting hundreds of Myriad Beasts? This was a near impossible feat. William just so happened to know about a Giant Robot which had the capabilities to turn anything beyond the rank of Demigod into ashes.

If not for that, they would be stuck on the 25th Floor due to Marissa’s grudge.

Even so, William and Chiffon had no choice but to continue. Their goal was to clear the 51st Floor, and there was nothing he could do about it. Whatever dangers lurked on that floor that had blocked Humanity’s advance, he would have to face it head-on, or risk staying on that floor…

Forever.
