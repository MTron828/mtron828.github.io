Chapter 611: Afterall, We Are Family, Right?

Ashe cradled Princess Sidonie’s head on her chest, as the latter panted for breath.

Both of them were currently inside the Thousand Beast Domain because the princess’ sin was acting up again. Unfortunately, there was no news of William and where he had gone.

No matter how much the two called out to him, no reply came back to them. It didn’t take long for the two young ladies to realize that something might have happened to William during his climb inside the tower.

Left with no choice, Ashe took the role of absorbing Princess Sidonie’s surging Divinity into her body. Ever since William had gone to the tower, the Half-Elf had designated his Incubus Job Class to Ashe as a countermeasure, just in case he wasn’t around when Princess Sidonie’s Divinity went out of control.

Naturally, this Job Class changed into the Succubus Job Class when Ashe took on her Mermaid Form. However, since this was an incomplete Job Class, William and Ashe didn’t grow any horns, tails, or wings on their bodies.

Even so, the power they wielded was enough to use the basic function of the Incubus and Succubus Job Classes without fail.

As the power of Lust was absorbed by the gem on Ashe’s chest, Sidonie’s breathing became smoother, but her face was still pale.

After an hour, the princess finally regained full control of her body.

“Thank you, Ashe,” Princess Sidonie said weakly. “I’m glad you were here to take care of me.”

“There’s no need to thank me,” Ashe replied. “I can’t possibly turn a blind eye when you are clearly suffering.”

Ashe sighed internally as she calmed the power that she had absorbed. The power of a Divinity wasn’t easy to control. Only William, who had the aid of the System, could easily store this power inside his body as a sort of battery for future use.

Ashe was different. She was a mermaid, and was a complete novice when it came to dealing with these kinds of things. Her forte lay in spirit control, and the power of Lust was not an easy power she could tame from the get go.

Both of them were covered in sweat, so they decided to take a bath together. After they were done, they returned to the bedroom.

Princess Sidonie knew that Ashe was having trouble in dealing with the power that she had absorbed, so she decided to lend her a hand.

Ashe didn’t resist, because she had been with the princess everytime they made love with William. Because of this, the barrier between the two of them had already crumbled. This was something that the Half-Elf had encouraged, because he preferred to make love with the two beautiful girls at the same time.

Soon, the two ladies rolled on the bed, as Princess Sidonie helped Ashe find relief. This was the only thing she could do to ensure that her friend would not be overwhelmed by the power of Lust.

Meanwhile, back in the Tower of Babylon…

Chiffon opened her eyes and found herself in a very familiar room. This was a place that she had been to several years ago.

A place that filled her with dread. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Suddenly the door in the room opened up, and a handsome boy with green hair entered. There was a devilish grin on his face, which made Chiffon unconsciously shudder. Truth be told, the pink-haired girl was very afraid of this person.

She wished more than anything else that she wouldn’t get the opportunity to see him again.

“What’s wrong, little sister?” the green-haired boy asked. His blood-red eyes stared at Chiffon with ridicule. “Are you hungry? Don’t worry, I will take you to a place where you can eat your fill.”

Chiffon unconsciously stepped back as she shook her head. “N-No. I’m not hungry.”

The green-haired boy paused for a minute before laughing.

“Little sister, how can you not be hungry?” the green-haired boy asked in a teasing tone. “You haven’t eaten anything in two days. You don’t have to lie to me. As your big brother, it is my duty to ensure that you eat until you are full.

“N-No. I’m not really hungry. Big Brother Felix, you don’t have to take me anywhere.”

“Oh? Are you sure you’re not hungry?”

“I’m not hungry.”

As if mocking her attempt at lying, a gurgling sound resounded inside the room. Felix laughed once again as Chiffon’s stomach growled in hunger.

“Let’s go.” Felix grabbed her hand, not carrying whether she wanted to go with him or not. “Time for you to eat.”

Felix was Chiffon’s half-brother. They were born from different mothers, and had the same father.

The pink-haired girl also had several other brothers and sisters. Some were older than her, some were younger than her. However, all of them shared the same attitude when it came to Chiffon.

All of them treated her like trash.

Felix dragged Chiffon to the forest that was just outside their manor. It was a villa that their family used for lodging during hunting season. Naturally, the forest was nearby, so that they didn’t need to travel far in order to hunt their prey.

After half an hour, the two arrived at a small clearing inside the forest.

There, over a dozen boys and girls chatted happily.

“I brought her with me,” Felix announced as he pushed Chiffon forward. “She’s very hungry. I hope that all of you will help our sister eat as much as she can. After all, we are all family, right?”

The boys and girls laughed and voiced their agreement.

Chiffon clenched her fist as she lowered her head.

‘Why? Why is this happening?!’ Chiffon panicked internally. ‘Just a minute ago, I was with Big Brother Wi…’

Chiffon paused. The name she was about to say was stuck at the tip of her tongue. She tried to recall her Big Brother’s name, but whenever she did, only a blurry image appeared inside her head.

All she could remember was the color of his hair and eyes. However, even those two things were starting to become blurry as well.

“What’s wrong?” Felix inquired as he once again pushed Chiffon’s body.

Because of the sudden push, Chiffon fell down on the ground.

Everyone around her laughed when they saw the scene in front of their eyes. Their laughter drowned out the memory that Chiffon was trying so hard to hold unto. A memory that she didn’t want to let go, no matter what.

“Everyone, our sister is very hungry,” Felix raised his hand with a wicked grin. “Come on. Let’s shower Chiffon with our love.”

“Alright!”

“I’ve prepared for this day.”

“Heh! I even went to the small village nearby to help our sister get something to eat.”

“Oh? How kind of you. I only found some rotting food in the kitchen.”

As if the floodgates had been opened, Chiffon’s brothers and sisters opened their storage rings and showered her with an assortment of trash that they had gathered over the past two days.

Rotten eggs, fishbones, dead mice, insects, bones, pieces of flesh, animal droppings that they found in the forest, and many other things both disgusting and mundane.

The pink-haired girl was covered in filth from head to foot, but this didn’t cause her despair. The one thing she was worried about was the fleeting memory that was slowly, and surely, slipping out of her grasp.
