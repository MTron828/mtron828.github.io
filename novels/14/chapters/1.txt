Chapter 1: I’m Going Ahead First… Don’t Miss Me Too Much

To the Destined Person who is lucky enough to find my letter,

Seven-hundred fifty-two million, six-hundred forty-eight thousand heartbeats.

That is the number of times my heart pulsed inside my body, before I gave it away. I, who had lived a painful, yet happy, life had many regrets and among those regrets was to die… a virgin!

Ahem! Don’t look at me with those eyes filled with ridicule and contempt, for I am sure that you, yes you! The one reading this right now is the same. Both of us are virgins!

What? You’re not a virgin? In that case then F*ck you! How dare you read this?! Don’t you know the feelings of us pitiful, good looking, and drop dead gorgeous boys, LIKE ME, who have never even had the chance to date a girl?

Do you not know our pain? Our suffering? Our endless days stuck inside the bathroom doing one hand calisthenics?

Tsk, you uncultured swine. What happened to the saying, Bros before Hoes? Shame on you bro, shame on you.

You scum, who don’t understand the importance of brotherhood. I hope your PP won’t ever raise its head ever again! Let’s see if you stay popular then!

Where was I? Oh yeah, I died as a virgin. However, before I died, I got my first and last kiss from a beautiful lady who was known as the number one beauty in the whole academy.

Man~ her lips were so soft that I felt like I was in cloud nine.

If only the boys in the school could see that moment, I bet that they would have bitten their handkerchiefs in envy. I’m sure that all of her admirers would have joined hands in order to kill me.

Jokes on them, because by the time someone has found this letter, I will have long been dead! Hahaha!

I leave this world with many regrets, but there was one thing I don’t regret, and that was giving my heart to her. Even though she had only been my girlfriend for a few hours, those hours were the happiest hours of my life.

I pray that she will live her life to the fullest. Not only for herself, but, also, for my sake. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

To you, who is currently reading this letter, I wish you a blessed day. I don’t know who you are, where you’re from, or what you’re going through. However, let me just tell you one thing.

Live your life to the fullest, and live without regrets. For there are many like me, who won’t be able to see tomorrow’s sunrise once we close our eyes tonight. I never cared about the world before, but when I saw the last sunset of my life, I realized that I had missed many beautiful opportunities.

Don’t be like me.

Don’t waste your life.

Treasure every moment, as if it was your last.

And before I end this letter, allow me to give you my final advice.

Always bring tissues with you wherever you go.

William

The boy who died so that others may live.

P.S

In the small chance that you are the one who found this letter. Please, ignore the first and second half of what you have read. I was just joking! Don’t take my words seriously.

If Fate wills it then our paths will definitely cross again. I wish that, the next time we meet, we will be able to finish our unfinished business. I promise that when that time comes, I will never let you go.

Well then, I’m going ahead first… Don’t miss me too much, okay? Also, you’re not allowed to follow me right away! Because if you do, I will be really sad. Take care of my little brothers and sisters in the orphanage for me.

See you later, Belle.

A single tear fell, followed by another. Soon, the handwritten letter was drenched in tears. Belle’s vision blurred as the tears in her eyes fell like rain.

“William, I’m sorry,” Belle held the letter close to her chest. “I’m sorry.”

As the sun disappeared from the horizon, and the first stars appeared in the sky. Only the strong beating of William’s heart within her chest, accompanied her until she no longer had tears to shed.
