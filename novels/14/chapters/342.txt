Chapter 342: Let’s Return To Lont First

“So, are you ready to spill the beans now?” William asked with an evil smile plastered on his face.

*Kzzzzt*

Tendrils of lightning snaked across William’s hands as if they had a life of their own. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

The leader of the black-robed men, Lewis, shuddered as he looked at the devilish smile of the young man in front of him. He could feel that he was only just a hair’s breadth away from being turned into a charred corpse.

“I-I’ll talk,” Lewis answered hurriedly. “I’ll tell you everything.”

William nodded and made a gesture for Lewis to start talking.

The right hand of Calum told William that they were sent by the Crown Prince to capture Leah and bring her to his chambers tonight. They were also ordered to beat up Matthew if he resisted and drag him back as well.

When Matthew and Leah heard Lewis’ confession, their expressions immediately became grim. Matthew already had a hunch that it was the Prince that sent the black-robed men after them and it made him want to rip the bastard Prince into pieces.

Leah, on the other hand, was in disbelief, but Matthew’s reactions told her that what she heard was indeed the truth. After this realization, she felt disgusted with the Crown Prince and buried her head into her lover’s chest.

“I swear, everything I told you is the truth. Please, let me go.” Lewis begged. “I promise that I won’t tell the Prince anything. I’ll just mention that our targets successfully escaped.”

Lewis swallowed his pride and begged. He made an oath that if he managed to escape with his life, he would definitely tell this incident to their leader, Conner, and beg him to take vengeance for him.

He was confident that, with the members of The Organization that were scattered across the Southern Continent, the Half-Elf would have nowhere to hide.

“Okay, you may go.” William waved his hand in a casual manner. “Don’t let me see your face again.”

Lewis bowed repeatedly, while sneering inside his heart. He then walked away and headed towards the teleportation gate, which would bring him back to the capital of the Hellan Kingdom where the Crown Prince was waiting for him.

However, he had only managed to walk twenty steps before his feet stopped moving. Blood flowed out from the corner of his lips as he collapsed on the ground, on the verge of dying.

He forced himself to turn his head to look behind him, only to see the red-headed boy looking at him as if he was looking at a dead person. Soon, Lewis’ eyes clouded over because his heart had ruptured inside his chest.

William had planted a strand of lightning deep within Lewis’ heart and detonated it like a miniature bomb. The Half-Elf had no intention of letting him go in the first place, because he had already dealt with a few people similar to Lewis.

He knew that these people were better off dead because if they were left alive, they would make others suffer simply by existing.

“Well then, how about you two fine gentlemen tell me everything about your Organization,” William glanced at the two surviving men from The Organization who were playing dead on the ground. “Of course, if you love playing dead, I will be more than happy to send both of you to the afterlife.”

“W-We will tell you everything!”

“Spare us! We’re just following orders!”

William snorted as he summoned a whip made out of water, and used it to tie up the two men to prevent them from escaping. After making sure that they were properly tied up, William smiled and looked at his Big Brother and Big Sister, who were looking back at him with grateful expressions.

Suddenly, a boy materialized out of thin air and stood beside William. He glared at the Half-Elf before pinching his waist.

“You just regained consciousness two days ago and you’re already pushing yourself.” Ian reprimanded. “What was that part about taking it easy for the time being? Didn’t you say that you wouldn’t over-exert yourself? What if your Spiritual World collapses again? What are you going to do then, huh?!”

William’s intimidating presence immediately disappeared as he tried to pacify Ian who was about to smack him to oblivion.

“I-It was an emergency! Besides, you merged with me so my Spiritual World is safe,” William replied as he grabbed Ian’s wrist.

He then used his other hand to touch his forehead and spoke in a monotone voice, “O-Oh no! I’m feeling dizzy!”

William’s body wobbled dangerously and was about to fall down when Ian caught him. The brown-haired boy looked at William anxiously as he supported the Half-Elf’s body.

Of course, William was just acting to stop Ian from nagging at him. Matthew and Leah looked at this scene with complicated expressions. Matthew looked confused, while Leah was looking at the two in amusement.

When Ian noticed that Matthew and Leah were looking at them in a weird manner, he hurriedly let go of William, making the Half-Elf fall on the ground with a thud.

“Head Prefect Matthew, Vice Prefect Leah, it’s good to see that both of you are safe,” Ian said as he ignored the fallen boy near his feet. He even hurriedly kicked William’s bum, which made the latter yelp in pain, in order to vent out his frustration for being seen in a weird manner by others.

Matthew cleared his throat as he pretended not to see his cousin being mistreated by the handsome brown haired boy in front of him.

“If I remember correctly, you are one of the officers in the First Year Magic Division,” Matthew replied as he cleared his throat. “Are you Ian, or Isaac?”

“I am Ian. Sir Matthew, can you please, tell me, what happened to my Young Master and my twin brother?” Ian inquired.

He was very worried about Est’s and Isaac’s safety because the last time he saw them was before they left for the war.

“Your Young Master and your twin brother are safe,” Matthew replied. “We parted a few hours ago and if I remembered correctly, they were planning to return to the capital. Est seemed to be worried about his mother’s safety, so he decided to see her condition as soon as possible. Your twin went along with him. They should be in the capital by now.”

Ian breathed a sigh of relief after hearing that Est and Ian were safe and had survived the war against the army of the Aenashaian Dynasty.

A loud shriek resounded in the sky as Dave and his partner, Lionheart, descended from the sky while pulling a flying carriage.

“Since Est and Isaac are safe, let’s return to Lont first,” William proposed as he dusted himself. “I’m worried about Eve and the townspeople that were left behind.”

Matthew, and Leah nodded their heads because it was their sole purpose for leaving the fortress. Ian didn’t have any objections and decided to come along with them back to their hometown.

Although William looked healthy on the outside, his Spiritual World was still far from a full recovery. In order to ensure that the red-headed boy wouldn’t push himself like he usually did, Ian resolved to stay by the Half-Elf’s side for the time being.

After all, if something unexpected occurred, he was the only one that could enter William’s Sea of Consciousness and initiate treatment when necessary.
