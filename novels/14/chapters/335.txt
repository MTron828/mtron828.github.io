Chapter 335: What I Want, Is You

“You and your men are Incompetent Fools!” Prince Lionel slammed his fist on the table as he glared at Calum. “You promised me that I would have her! But what did you do? You let her escape!”

Calum narrowed his eyes, but he didn’t say anything to the Crown Prince who was looking at him with bloodshot eyes. It was indeed his mistake for underestimating the Third Princess of Freesia who was not only beautiful, but also well versed in reading the books on the Arts of War.

What he didn’t know was that Princess Sidonie was also a clever strategist behind closed doors. She would order her pets to do missions for her, and some of these missions included the assassinations of corrupt officials in her kingdom.

Well, the one giving the orders was Morgana, but since they shared the same body, everyone who was in the know about her dual personalities still credited these achievements to Princess Sidonie, who only dreamed of finding her one true love.

“Our agents are already looking for her trail,” Calum reported. “The journey to Freesia will take at least a week and we have already laid ambushes to intercept her along the way.”

Prince Lionel was so mad that he wanted to laugh out loud when he heard Calum’s reply.

“Do you honestly believe that Princess Sidonie is not aware of the ambushes that you have laid out for her?” Prince Lionel questioned. “Do you think of her as a fool? The lady I love is not a small fry that you can capture using tricks for little kids!”

Prince Lionel pounded the table once again to vent out his frustrations. Since he dreamed of making Princess Sidonie his wife, he did his best to investigate everything about her. The things she liked to eat, her hobbies, and anything that would make her happy.

He studied it for many years in order to increase his chances of closing the distance between the two of them. However, when the Princess had arrived in the capital, all the preparations he had made didn’t work.

It was as if he was talking to a completely different person.

Truth be told, Princess Sidonie didn’t like to deal with Prince Lionel. This was why, most of the time, when the Crown Prince and the Princess were alone, it would always be Morgana talking to the Crown Prince.

Princess Sidonie would only talk to him when they were in the presence of others, which made all of Lionel’s attempts futile.

The Crown Prince also realized that ever since the party where the Princess had danced with William, Princess Sidonie would always ask him things about the Half-Elf. This made the Crown Prince very jealous to the point that he ordered his men to assassinate the unconscious Half-Elf.

But, none of the men he ordered to do this task had returned to his side. That was when Prince Lionel realized that there was someone strong protecting the boy.

Since that was the case, he stopped giving out orders in order to keep his men from dying.

Fortunately, William had fallen into a coma after the Demon Invasion, in the academy. Because of this, the Princess didn’t have the opportunity to meet with him before the war started. This was the only consolation Prince Lionel had after his failed attempts to get rid of the red-headed boy.

If he only knew that there was an overprotective Goat and Parrot Monkey by William’s side, he would certainly not think to send assassins to kill him.

“Find her no matter what!” Lionel ordered. “We had a deal and it’s your turn to keep your end of the bargain!”

Calum covered his head with a hood because he was afraid that he would slap the Prince if he looked directly at his face. “Fine. I will personally go and look for your Princess. But, remember this. We are not your minions whom you can order around however you like. Don’t push your luck, Crown Prince.”

Calum left the room leaving a frustrated Prince Lionel behind. Soon, the sound of things breaking could be heard inside the room. The Crown Prince vented his anger until he could no longer break anything.

He vowed that the next time he saw Princess Sidonie, he would pin her down, and show no mercy. Prince Lionel always got what he wanted. However, he also understood that he had to rely on The Organization to make him the Emperor of the Southern Continent.

“No matter where you run, no matter where you hide, I will find you,” Prince Lionel vowed. “When that day comes, I will make sure that you will no longer be able to run away. Princess Sidonie, I will make you regret running away from this Prince!”

“Princess, are you sure about this?” Priscilla asked as she followed behind Princess Sidonie. “What if the Queen wasn’t affected by that continental spell that they invoked?”

Princess Sidonie walked as she removed the rings in her fingers one by one. “It doesn’t matter if the Queen is active or not. What is important is that she’s defenseless right now.”

The two young ladies walked into a wide tunnel, hundreds of meters below the ground.

Princess Sidonie and Morgana knew that they would have a hard time escaping their pursuers. The two of them didn’t excel in combat, so fighting wasn’t an option. This was why Princess Sidonie took Priscilla with her when she escaped from Ravenlord Citadel.

The Princess knew that The Organization was also present in Freesia, so she decided to make a detour. Morgana suggested that they go to Antheilm where the Queen Ant, that supplied the Anasesha Dynasty with unlimited Warrior Ants, was located.

Soon, the two arrived in a very spacious cavern littered with countless eggs. At the center was a Giant Beast, that was also the Guardian Beast of the Aenasha Dynasty.

It was none other than the Myriad Beast known as the Crowned Nightmare Queen Ant.

The Queen Ant had the lower body of an ant, and the upper body of a beautiful woman. She had already sensed Princess Sidonie’s approach and raised her head in defiance. Currently, she was in a weakened state because the Continental spell had also affected her, even though she was deep underground.

“Don’t come any closer!” the Ant Queen shrieked because her instincts were telling her that Princess Sidonie was a very dangerous being. “What do you want?!”

Princess Sidonie ignored the Ant Queen’s pitiful struggles as she removed the last accessory from her hand.

“What I want, is you,” Princess Sidonie said as she removed the veil that covered her face.

The Queen Ant’s expression immediately softened as her gaze locked on Sidonie’s beautiful face.

Seeing that her plan had worked, Sidonie moved closer to the Queen Ant. She just needed to do one last thing in order to seal the Queen’s fate.

Using her hairpin, Princess Sidonie pricked her finger tip until a drop of blood was formed. She then wrote a magic circle in the air using her blood as a medium.

Soon, a magic contract of Master and Beast hovered in front of her. The Queen Ant lowered her massive body in order to allow Princess Sidonie to embed the magic circle into her forehead.

The Queen Ant offered no resistance and allowed the contract to merge with her body. Half a minute later, Princess Sidonie felt a strong connection with the Myriad Beast which proved that she had succeeded in making the Myriad Ant Queen her Beast Companion.

Since she was young, Princess Sidonie had always wanted to make a Myriad Beast her Beast Companion. Although the Queen Ant had only average fighting skills, it was capable of producing an army that numbered in the millions.

With this, Princess Sidonie wouldn’t have to worry about not having enough warriors to fight for her. The only thing she needed to do now was to wait a few days for the Ant Eggs to hatch.

These eggs had been unaffected by the spell because they didn’t quite meet the requirements that had crippled the entire Southern Continent. Sidonie was sure that the moment they hatched, only a handful of individuals in the current Southern Continent would be her match.
