Chapter 352: Are You Going To Submit Or Not?

‘I see. So, you are that girl that Lady Eros told me about,’ William thought as he ordered the system to switch his Job Class to Incubus.

While the Goddess of Lust was training William to resist seduction and charm, she would often mention that her sweet and beautiful daughter was looking for her one true love. Eros even shamelessly told William that if he was looking for more lovers, he should just hook up with her darling daughters and roll around on the bed as they pleased!

The power of Lust was now overflowing from Morgana’s body and the spectator from the side, Priscilla, found her breathing getting ragged. She had been Charmed by Princess Sidonie many years ago and had become her devoted subject.

Because of this, the Princess had reduced her control over her and allowed Priscilla to act with her own free will. Even so, the loyalty that was born though those years had remained in her heart.

Now, she was being Charmed anew. Morgana’s powers were simply too strong for anyone to resist. Half a minute later, Priscilla looked at Morgana with an infatuated gaze, deprived of her ability to think and act.

“Why?” Morgana asked. “Why is my power not working on you?!”

“Because I’m too handsome and you know it,” William replied with a smirk. ‘Fortunately, her Charm is still lacking in Divinity right now.’

Earlier when Morgana tried to charm William, she was only using a fraction of her powers. Now, she was going all in, but to her surprise, the boy in front of her was still unaffected by her powers. Also, for some strange reason, she was finding him more attractive compared to when she had first switched with Princess Sidonie to take control of their body.

What Morgana didn’t know was that her powers and William’s Incubus Job Class were resonating with each other. William’s own Charm and Charisma were strengthened whenever he used his Incubus Job Class.

This made Morgana, and Princess Sidonie, who had resumed her observation of the Half-Elf, confused and bothered. There hadn’t been a time where they needed to use the full extent of their powers to Charm someone. And even at their best, they were still unable to put the red-headed boy under their control.

Morgana reigned in her surprise as she looked at William in a new light. “As expected of the man we chose. Good! Breaking you will be worth my while.”

A red mist enveloped the beautiful princess. Half a minute later, she reappeared wearing a dominatrix latex suit that highlighted her curves. Right now, she was only sixteen years old, so her growth was still in its final phase. Even so, her irresistible figure, coupled with the power of Lust, were more than enough to bring almost any man or woman to their knees.

Morgana raised her hand and a blood-red whip materialized in the air. She grabbed its handle firmly in her hands. The beautiful seductress then lashed it on the ground, leaving a meter deep gash that made William’s liver itch.

‘I’ll give her attire 12/10,’ William thought as he summoned his wooden staff and took a fighting stance. ‘The only things missing now are the rope and the candles. Should I tie her up and make her understand that this Sir is not someone she can bully?’

The corner of Morgana’s lips curled up as he eyed William from where she stood. “I’ll give you one last choice. Kneel and submit to me, or I’ll whip you until you submit to me!”

William snorted, “How about I whip you instead? You’re not the only one who’s trained with a whip.”

William summoned a water whip that floated in the air. Due to his connection with Ashe (Ian), he was able to use her abilities as well, strengthening his control over his water magic.

Morgana frowned because according to the reports she had read, William had no Magic Power whatsoever. She had also confirmed this when they danced together, at the Banquet back at the Palace of the Hellan Kingdom, because she learned through experience that some of the information that her subordinates may have gathered could be wrong.

The frown on her face disappeared just as fast as it had appeared. Whether William had Magic Powers or not was not important. The important part was that she was planning to crush him and make him submit by force.

“You want to whip me? Let’s see if you can back it up.” Morgana giggled. “Tell me, Sir William. Do you know where we are? You don’t need to ask. I’ll tell you the answer. We are currently inside Antheilm. The nest of the Myriad Ant Queen who is also the Guardian Beast of the Aenasha Dynasty. It’s time for you to realize that going against me is the biggest mistake of your life!”

Two portals appeared behind Morgana. A few seconds later, two Giant Golden Ants that were five-meters tall crawled out of the portal and stood beside her. After Princess Sidonie had made the Ant Queen her Beast Companion, she gained the ability to summon the ant army anytime and anywhere she pleased.

William narrowed his eyes as the information of the two newcomers appeared in his status screen.

-

[ Golden Nightmare Ant ]

— Ant Overlord

— Threat Level: SS (Mid)

— Millennial Beast

— Cannot be added to the herd.

— They are the personal guards of the Queen and Overlords of the Ant Colony. They are among the few Millennial Beasts who specialize in both attacks and defense.

— Their scales are very tough and only spells of the Seventh Circle, and weapons made by Grandmaster Blacksmiths, are able to damage it.

— These Overlords can also use Earth Magic up to the Sixth Circle, which makes them a very formidable enemy to fight. Only full-fledged Archmages and warriors can survive a battle against one of these behemoths.

“I’m going to be lenient and give you one, last, chance,” Morgana said crispily. “A man of your status should know when to back down. Now, tell me, are you going to submit or not?”

To Morgana’s surprise, instead of feeling afraid, the Half-Elf seemed to be completely at ease. He was even assessing the two Millennial Ants as if they were some kind of delicacy.

“Thank you for being lenient,” William replied with a smile. “However, my answer is…”

A rainbow colored ant-eater sprang up from behind William and raised its head in an arrogant manner. It gazed at the two Golden Ants as if they were mere two bugs that it could step on at any given time.

The bodies of the two Millennial Ants suddenly shuddered. The moment the Rainbow colored Anteater appeared, they felt that it was a terrifying foe that they couldn’t beat no matter what.

After basking in the limelight for half a minute, the Kasogonaga curled up into a ball and charged towards the nearest Millennial Ant. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

It’s cute, yet imposing, voice echoed within the spacious cavern, making all the Soldier Ants that heard it, scramble away in fear.

“I’M ROLLING!”
