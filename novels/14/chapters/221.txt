“I wonder what Will is doing?” Wendy muttered as she dried her hair.

She had just stepped out of the bath after finishing the afternoon training with the members of the Angorian War Sovereign. William had told her that he would accompany Amelia to her hometown in order to solve their barony’s problem.

‘I wish he’d brought me with him.’ Wendy pouted as she put on a set of clean clothes.

Thor was currently sleeping on the top of her bed. He was more like Wendy’s Guardian than William’s, but the latter didn’t mind it one bit. In fact, he even gave Thor permission to stay by Wendy’s side if he liked it.

After fixing her hair in front of the mirror, she heard three knocks on her door.

“Wendy, are you there? It’s me, Charlotte.”

Wendy hurriedly opened the door and allowed her good friend, Charlotte, to enter her room.

“Sorry, were you in the middle of changing clothes?” Charlotte asked after seeing that Wendy’s hair was still slightly wet. She also smelled the fragrant scent of soap on her body.

“No,” Wendy replied. “I had just finished fixing my hair when you knocked, Big Sister.”

Charlotte smiled and nodded her head in understanding. She had known Wendy for a long time and knew that the girl was a very honest and straightforward person.

“I came here because I want to share something with you,” Charlotte said as she took out a small pouch from her pocket. “Here. This is yours.”

Wendy curiously opened the pocket and a smile immediately appeared on her face. She estimated that there were over twenty candies inside the pouch, and it made her very happy.

“Thank you, Big Sister!” Wendy gave Charlotte a big hug and the latter hugged her back.

After a brief moment of intimacy, Wendy pulled away and giggled. Charlotte patted her head and smiled as well.

“Well then, I have to go.” Charlotte lightly pinched Wendy’s nose. “The candies are in short supply right now, so don’t share them with others. I’ll come back again next week when I have more.”

“Thank you, Big Sister.” Wendy walked Charlotte out of her room. “Whoever is supplying you these candies, please, tell them that I love the candies very much!”

Charlotte grinned and nodded her head. Both girls waved their hands to say goodbye, as they parted ways.

Wendy excitedly placed a candy in her mouth as she walked towards the bed. The sweetness that soon followed made her close her eyes in appreciation.

“This candy is really good,” Wendy muttered. “Simply the best.”

She then ate another one before she sat on the bed.

“I hope you return soon, Will,’ Wendy muttered softly as the thought of the red-headed boy’s smiling face that would occasionally make her heart skip a beat. She really hoped that the boy she liked would return soon, so that she could spend more time with him.

The sound of Goblins shrieking echoed inside the walls of the Goblin Crypt as William’s Trollhound Army ate their fill.

William hadn’t lied when he told them that they wouldn’t go hungry anymore if they followed him. When the Bestiary was made on the First Floor of the Dungeon, the Trollhounds started to explore the dungeon to get familiar with it.

Whenever they encountered Goblins, the Trollhounds would immediately go for the kill. Fenrir watched as his subordinates feasted on the bodies of the goblins. Deep inside, he was very happy with his decision because it allowed him and his brethren to not suffer from starvation.

After receiving William’s blessings, the Trollhound’s body became more powerful and agile. He was now more like a wolf, than a wild dog after his transformation.

Although his subordinates were only Class E beasts, and he, Class D, none of the goblin parties were their match. Even though the Hobgoblins were stronger than them, they couldn’t be killed using normal means.

Also, they numbered in the Seventies. It was literally impossible for a party of Hobgoblins to resist their rampage.

Of course, William also gave them limitations. He didn’t allow them to climb up to the Fourteenth Floor where the Goblin Shaman spawned. Numerous as they were, the Goblin Shaman was not an easy cookie to crack.

After the Ring of Conquest was modified, the spawn rate of all the monsters on each of the floors increased dramatically. Each Party that had a Goblin Shaman now consisted of two Shamans, which was far more dangerous than the dungeon that Wendy, and her twin brother, Spencer, had challenged in the real world.

In order to prevent any mishaps, William ordered Fenrir and the Trollhounds to never step onto the Fourteenth Floor until all of them reached Rank D, and Fenrir Rank C.

Anything else was fair game, so the Trollhounds fought their way from the First Floor up to the Thirteenth Floor of the Dungeon Crypt. Their non-existent battle style was slowly being formed and their team cooperation had started to establish.

William tasked Fenrir to divide each team into groups of ten. After that, a captain was assigned to each group to make the commands easier. Fenrir was the commander, while the captains under him ensured that their formation wouldn’t falter.

In order to give them a more challenging training, Fenrir ordered each team to challenge different floors by themselves on a rotational basis. Because of this, The Boss room up to the Thirteenth Floor became the main battleground of the Trollhounds to perfect their teamwork.

Although the new set-up was good. It wouldn’t change the fact that they were still Rank E Beasts. The Boss Room alone was quite difficult for ten Trollhounds to beat because of the difference in ranks.

Still, they endured and challenged it over and over again. Although it was a painful experience, they were near immortal inside the Goblin Crype because of their powerful regeneration ability. None of the Goblins had the power to use Fire and Acid spells, so dying was not an issue.

Fenrir joined his subordinates in battles against the Hobgoblin Leader. He was tired of being weak and helpless. That was why he fought with everything he had in order to not disappoint his new Master, who had given him quite the blessing.

William heard the System’s report and was very satisfied with the results. The red-headed boy was confident that, given time, the Trollhound Army would be one of the Vanguards that would lead him to victory.

All he needed to do now was nurture them all until they became an unstoppable force that would help him conquer his foes in the battles that would happen in the future.
