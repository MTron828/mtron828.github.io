Chapter 248: Lightning God War Art, Eighth Form

The feast ended abruptly as everyone headed towards the Arena of Chivalry. This was a giant pit located in the Third Peak of Chivalry where duels were held.

The arena was half a kilometer long, and felt very ancient. There was a carved statue of a humanoid goat with wings that towered over the far end of the arena. William assumed that this was the image of the Sovereign of the Kyrintor Mountains that the tribes worship.

The Half-Elf had changed attire and wore a white and red robe with a hood. Currently, William was not using the hood so it lay harmlessly on the back of his neck. He was holding the wooden staff in his hand and stood in the center of the arena.

Aziel was wearing a full set of black and gold light-weight armor. The Aenasha dynasty was a dynasty of warriors. They had very few magicians, but they had two Sword Saints among their ranks. They also had an Ant Queen Myriad Beast Guardian that ensured that their territory wouldn’t be conquered by anyone.

The spectators stood along the sides of the huge pit and looked at the two warriors with interest. All of them disliked William and hoped that Prince Aziel would wipe the floor using the arrogant Half-Elf’s face.

Sir Jerkins, and the other representatives of the Hellan Kingdom, had grim expressions on their faces as they watched the battle from above.

Briana, who was the “prize”, sat beside her grandfather with her hands clasped together. It was as if she was praying to the Sovereign of the Kyrintor Mountains for William’s victory.

The Crown Prince, Prince Alaric, and Princess Aila, sat beside each other as they, too, waited for the start of the battle. In the depths of Princess Aila’s beautiful purple eyes, a rare feeling of admiration and envy welled up. She wasn’t able to stop herself from giving Brianna a brief glance before shifting her attention back at the arena.

How the Princess wished that she was in Brianna’s position. She also wished that a knight would appear out of nowhere and save her from her fated marriage.

“Are both of you ready?” Great Chief Evander, who was seated on a High-Seat at the top of the cliff overlooking the arena, asked.

“Ready,” William answered. He took a fighting stance holding the staff in his hand and pointed its end in Prince Aziel’s direction.

Prince Aziel nodded his head and brought down his visor. He took a fighting stance and held his sword firmly in his hand.

Seeing that both fighters were raring to go. Great Chief Evander raised his hand and announced the start of the battle.

“Fight for honor! Fight for Glory! May the best man win!” Great Chief Evander shouted. “Start!”

The warriors around the arena raised their weapons and shouted.

“”Ahoo! Ahoo! Ahoo!””

William locked his sights on Prince Aziel’s body as the power of his passive skills boosted his stats. He had shifted to the Monk Job Class because it was currently the best Class to use during a battle. Not only that, the extra stat points it gave was a welcome addition to William whose powers were still sealed.

Both fighters took a step forward and charged at each other. Prince Aziel suddenly increased his speed and instantly appeared five meters in front of William. The Second Prince was known for his uncanny ability to easily unleash a flurry of sword strikes that rendered his opponent in a helpless state.

He was using a long, silver, saber sword that was slightly longer, and bigger than the normal saber sword. Although it looked heavy from an outsider’s perspective, for the Prince, it was as light as a feather because it was a soul bound weapon that was especially made for him by the Grandmaster Blacksmith of their Dynasty.

It was a sword that could easily slice through steel armor, as if it was made from tofu.

Prince Aizel sneered in his heart. His plan was to cut the Half-Elf’s arms off before torturing him. He would mutilate William’s face until even his family wouldn’t be able to recognize him anymore. After that, he would chain him up and bring him back to the Palace and have him live as a chained dog for the rest of his life.

The sword blade blurred as the strike reached its designated target.

William raised his staff in an attempt to block it which made the smile on Prince Aizel’s face widen. He disdained the Half-Elf for even attempting to use a useless staff to block his sword. He looked forward to seeing his “future” slave’s expression when the weapon in his hands was cut into pieces.

Unfortunately, what happened next made the smile on Prince Aziel’s face stiffen.

The staff that he had thought would be cut in half successfully blocked his attack and was even about to fall on top of his head!

The Prince hurriedly jumped to the side to dodge the unexpected counter attack from his opponent. However, William was hot on his heels.

“Relentless Dragon Rush!” William roared as he sent a flurry of thrusts aimed at Prince Aziel’s head, neck, chest, eyes, and shoulders.

The Prince hurriedly parried the attacks he could, and dodged the others. Prince Aziel took several steps back in order to gain distance from the opponent that he had only considered to be a fool for challenging him in a duel. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Forced into a corner, Prince Aziel shouted and released his Sword Aura. The sword in his hand extended and turned into a Giant Silver Snake that forced William to stop his assault.

After finally taking a breather, Prince Aziel’s face within his helmet reddened in anger and shame. For him to be forced to use his Sword Aura and Intent first made his killing intent explode from his body.

“I’ll kill you!” Prince Aziel roared and thrust forward.

The Giant Silver Snake hissed and charged towards William with rage.

This time, the situation was reversed. It was now William’s time to retreat as the snake mercilessly hounded his heels.

“Come, Soleil!” The ring on William’s hand transformed into a golden spear. He had already stored his wooden staff and now held the spear firmly in his hands.

Right now, it was noon-time in the Kyrintor Mountains. Although the temperature was freezing, the sun shone in the sky like a King watching gladiators battle to entertain him. The spear in William’s hand started to get warm, which caused steam to rise from its handle and blade tip.

William channeled his Aura into his weapon before throwing it towards the sky. Everyone was dumbfounded by the Half-Elf’s move because they couldn’t understand the logic behind his actions. Even William’s comrades were caught by surprise by their Commander’s antics.

Wendy’s hands were clasped together over her chest as she observed the person she liked. She had faith in William and trusted him completely. The beautiful girl knew that her Commander was not someone who did things arbitrarily. She knew that there was a hidden meaning behind his action that would allow him to win the duel.

After throwing Soleil towards the sky, William summoned his bow and quiver. He immediately nocked an arrow on his bow and aimed it in Prince Aizel’s direction.

“Lightning God War Art, Eighth Form,” William said. “Exterminate, Khryselakatos!”

The tip of the adamantium arrow glistened in an eerie green glow before it was released from the bow. It flew towards the Prince leaving a trail of green mist behind it. Halfway through its journey, the arrow multiplied into over a hundred replicas.

Prince Aziel immediately made a blocking gesture which made the Giant Silver Snake stand in front of him. A few seconds later, a pained shriek resounded in the arena as the Adamantium arrows embedded themselves into the Silver Snake’s body.

Green smoke rose up from the arrow heads which formed a green poisonous cloud that enveloped the Giant Snake’s body.

Prince Aziel hurriedly dropped the sword in his hand and ran away from the poisonous cloud. As a member of the Royal family, he was well versed in using poison, because it was the most effective way to eliminate his opposition.

His instinct told him that the poison was very potent, so he didn’t hesitate to drop his weapon to retreat.

Unfortunately, William’s Lightning God War Art lasted for a full minute and the Half-Elf had sent another barrage of poisonous arrows in his direction.

Out of desperation, Prince Aziel raised the Onyx Medallion, that he had given Great Chief Evander before, in order to save his life.

“Heed my call and come to my aid!” Prince Aziel shouted. “Come forth! Blood-Eyed Torment Ant Soldiers!”

The Onyx Medallion shone and three two-meter-tall Ant Type Beasts emerged in front of Prince Aziel.

The rain of arrows fell upon them, and the ants gave out pained cries as they were hit by the holy arrows that were coated in powerful poison. The ants fell on the ground twitching, but Prince Aziel paid them no mind.

He summoned six more Blood-Eyed Torment Ants and ordered them to attack William. Once again, these ants died in William’s hands, but Prince Aziel kept on summoning more. It was as if the medallion’s ability to summon was unending.

Great Chief Evander looked at the Onyx Medallion in regret. If only William hadn’t interfered with his plans, the medallion would have been his!

The Blood-Eyed Torment Ants Soldiers were only Grade D beasts, but they were numerous. After summoning over a hundred beasts, the effect of William’s Lightning God War Art expired and he no longer shot any more arrows at his enemy.

Seeing that the Half-Elf had run out of steam, Prince Aziel laughed and raised the medallion once again. “Show him no mercy! I summon you, Grim Nightmare Ant Commander!”

A four-meter-tall silver ant with green eyes materialized in front of Prince Aziel. The Grim Nightmare Ant Commander’s bloody red mandibles opened wide to let out an ear piercing shriek. It was its warcry and acknowledgement to its Master’s command to kill the enemy in front of it.

William narrowed his eyes as his appraisal skill identified the latest goon that the Prince had summoned to end his life.
