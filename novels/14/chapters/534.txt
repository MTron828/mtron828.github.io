Chapter 534: Let’s Go Darling. It’s Now Time For Our Date

William and Ian walked side by side as they headed to the girl’s dormitory to pick up Princess Sidonie and Chiffon.

The Half-Elf noticed that all the students that he passed were looking at him with various expressions. Some look at him with admiration, envy, and jealousy, but none of them looked down on him like they did a week ago.

The Half-Elf had a calm expression on his face, but deep inside he was feeling smug because of the attention he was getting. Since he had declared that he would be Chiffon’s caretaker, he needed to show his classmates that he was capable of backing up his words.

Ian, who seemed to have guessed why the students were acting like this, chuckled internally.

‘I guess the impact of your performance shut them up completely,’ Ian said through telepathy.

Although she didn’t say it out loud, she was very proud of William’s accomplishments. Any girl would be happy if their man was an outstanding person. Ian wouldn’t admit it, but she had admired William since he had saved them from the Mountain Trolls on their way to the Temple to take the Test of Courage.

‘As long as they don’t bother us, I won’t come looking to bother them,’ William replied. ‘I came here to the Kraetor Empire to lift the curses on your bodies. It’s just the Emperor is playing hard to get and stalling for time. Without his approval, I am not allowed to visit Aamon’s Temple.’

Ian nodded. Even with Princess Sidonie’s help, the Emperor hadn’t yet agreed to William’s request to go to Aamon’s temple to have an audience with the God that was responsible for placing a curse on their bodies.

The Emperor, however, told William that he should enroll at Silverwind Academy for the time being and show him what he was capable of. Once he deemed that he was worthy to meet with their Deity, he would give his approval, so that William could visit Aamon’s temple.

The two of them continued their journey towards the Girls’ Dormitory, however, the moment they entered its premises a dozen girls appeared out of nowhere and clung to William.

“Sir William, you are amazing. I know that you are Princess Sidonie’s fiance, but I can’t stop myself from loving you,” a cute girl said with starry eyes. “Can you please, make me your mistress? Even a concubine will do!”

“Sir William, pick me instead,” the girl clinging to William’s left arm pleaded. “I am a good cook, and I have been trained with proper etiquette. Do you have a maid? I can be your personal maid. Of course, if you also want me to warm your bed at night, this humble servant will happily serve you all night.”

“Pick me, Sir William! I am the only daughter of Baron…”

“I am the third daughter of Duke…” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

William was bombarded by proposals left and right, and was unable to get rid of the girls clinging to him. Even Ian who was just standing beside him a minute ago was pushed aside by the crowd of girls that was growing by the minute.

“Girls, please, listen to me,” William said in a suave voice that would put all the best Hollywood Actors to shame. “I know that I am handsome, and awesome, but you shouldn’t fight for me like this.”

The Half-Elf raised his head to look at the sky. It was at this moment when a gentle breeze ruffled his hair, making the hearts of the ladies around him skip a beat.

“Beautiful ladies, I apologize because my heart is not big enough to fit all of you,” William said in a tone filled with regret.

“However, I believe that all of you will be able to find a man that is less handsome and less awesome than me. Life is filled with unexpected surprises, so don’t give up. I am but one of the many fishes in the ocean. I pray that you girls will find your beautiful ending someday.

The girls blushed because of William’s shameless words. Although the bastard Half-Elf had explicitly told them that they would never find a man as handsome and awesome as him, they still thought that he was just teasing them.

They became more rowdy and started to say things like “Kyaaah! Sir William is so romantic!”, or “Sir William is what all men should aspire to be!”

Ian, who had been pushed away, stared at the crowd as if she was staring at lunatics that hadn’t taken their medicine for the day. The mermaid was half tempted to summon her whip and whip the crazy girls until they returned to their senses.

She then glanced at the smug-faced-bastard-Half-Elf and cursed him internally. Although she understood that William couldn’t possibly push the girls away because he might hurt them, seeing dozens of pretty girls clinging to her lover was making her feel irritated.

“Will, what’s this? Are you planning to cheat on me?”

A cold yet seductive voice reached William’s and the crowd’s ears. All of them turned to look at the entrance of the Girl’s Dormitory where a very sensuous beauty stood with a sweet smile.

“Your Highness, how can I possibly cheat on you?” William replied as if he was wronged. “These beautiful ladies and I were merely discussing how beautiful the weather was. Am I right, everyone?”

“”Yes!””

The girls giggled because of the way William replied to Princess Sidonie. His teasing voice tickled their heartstrings, and they felt regret that they hadn’t met a young man just like him.

Chiffon, who was standing beside Princess Sidonie, looked at the crowd before shifting her attention to the Half-Elf who was surrounded by women.

The little girl was currently licking a lollipop, as she stared unblinkingly at the red-headed teenager who had declared to become her caretaker.

For a brief moment, something flashed within the depth of her clear and beautiful eyes. It didn’t last long and immediately disappeared in the next second. However, her foot subconsciously stepped forward.

Before she knew it, she was already walking in William’s direction. The girls’ who saw Chiffon walking towards them immediately backed away.

Chiffon was notoriously known as the Trash Eater, and none of the noble ladies wanted to be near her. They were afraid that if they were to breathe the same air around her, they would breathe in the stink of the garbage that she regularly ate.

Thanks to Chiffon’s deterrence, the girls who were clinging on William hastily retreated, leaving the Half-Elf all alone.

The little glutton reached out her hand and held William’s left hand. She didn’t say anything and simply licked the lollipop inside her mouth. Chiffon didn’t understand why, but the moment she held William’s hand, the lollipop inside her mouth suddenly tasted sweeter compared to before.

Princess Sidonie shook her head as she, too, walked towards William.

The Half Elf then bent his arm to allow the beautiful Princess to hold on into it.

“Shall we go?” William asked.

Princess Sidonie didn’t say anything. Instead, she reached out to hold the back of William’s head and pulled him close to her.

Right in front of all the girls at the entrance of the Girl’s Dormitory, Princess Sidonie kissed William’s lips.

The Half-Elf was surprised by the Princess’ action, but played along with his lover’s wishes. The two kissed, and kissed, and kissed more, making the girls looking at them blush in excitement and anticipation.

After a while, their kiss finally ended. Princess Sidonie leaned on William’s chest, while the latter wrapped his right arm on her back.

“Let’s go, Darling,” Princess Sidonie said. “It’s time for our date.”

William nodded as he guided Chiffon, and Princess Sidonie outside the gates of the Girl’s Dormitory.

Ian followed behind them without a word like a retainer. She had already had her fun with William earlier, so she didn’t mind letting Princess Sidonie have her turn.

With two beauties in each hand, and a handsome retainer behind his back. The Half-Elf entered the teleportation gate that would bring them to Silverwind City.

Their destination, the Whispering Wind Tavern. A place where the noble students gathered for fun, and to gossip about the recent events that had happened within the Academy.

Located on the top floor of the tavern, Prince Jason, along with the other members of the Kraetor Royal Family gathered. They were seated at a table exclusively for them, while their peers were seated on tables around them.

The atmosphere was very lively because the students were currently in a festive mood. Their Assessment Test had just ended, and all of them wanted to enjoy themselves, while the school was still on break.

Everyone had smiles on their faces, but among them, a certain Prince was seething inside his heart.

‘Damned Half-Elf,’ Prince Jason cursed internally. ‘Why must you always get in my way? You should have stayed in the countryside, you plebeian!’

Prince Jason had hated William ever since he had placed the Collar of Wisteria on Princess Sidonie’s neck. He had also seen the way that the beautiful Princess looked at the Half-Elf and it filled his heart with jealousy and envy.

Unknown to Prince Jason, the First Prince of the Kraetor Empire was observing his every action in a subtle manner.

Prince Maximilian was not a schemer, but he was a witty individual. He knew when to attack, and when to defend. He was just waiting for the perfect moment to strike and make sure that his target would be unable to recover from the devastating blow that he had prepared.
