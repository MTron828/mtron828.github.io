Chapter 358: We Will Be Waiting For You At The Peak Of Divinity

“Will!”

As soon as William stepped out of the flying carriage, Ian immediately gave him a hug.

Ian had been waiting for William’s arrival ever since the red-headed boy told her that he would go to the Northern Regions to meet with the Demigod of the Kyrintor Mountains.

The journey took six days because the distance from the Ant Colony to the Northern edge of the Hellan Kingdom was quite far.

William had spent almost a week in the Ant Colony before traveling towards the Northern Regions. In the twelve days that they were apart, the two had kept in touch with each other. Ian was quite worried because during those twelve days, she hadn’t been able to continue the recovery of William’s Spiritual World.

Although the Half-Elf’s Sea of Consciousness was recovering at a decent pace, Ian still wanted to speed up the healing by being there to act as medium. Also, it is the only place where she could face William in her true form.

Ian didn’t want to admit it, but those moments when the two of them were alone in William’s damaged world, were the moments she looked forward to the most.

“Did you miss me?” William asked with a smile as he returned Ian’s hug.

“Yes,” Ian replied as she looked at William with a gentle gaze.

Princess Sidonie, who had also stepped out of the flying carriage, saw everything. Her jaw almost dropped when she saw how intimately the two boys were hugging. Morgana, who was inside Princess Sidonie’s Mindscape, also had the same expression.

[ T-This?! Could it be?! ]

‘N-No! Don’t say it!’

[ W-Wait! This is the only explanation I can think of as to why Darling didn’t bat an eye when I placed his hand[delete s] on my chest! So, this is the reason! It’s because of HIM! ]

Princess Sidonie wanted to shout that it was her chest that William [had] touched and not Morgana’s. Even so, the situation in front of her made her completely unable to retort to her panicking other half.

‘There has to be another reason,’ Princess Sidonie said as she tried to calm her emotions. ‘Don’t forget Wendy. Based on our investigation, she is Sir William’s not-so-secret lover. We can’t deny the fact that the two of them really look that way. She even kissed him during the party back at the palace.’

[ Y-You’re right! ] Morgana grabbed Princess Sidonie’s argument like it was her last lifeline.

While still hugging William, Ian glanced at the veiled Princess, who was looking back at William and him.

Ian didn’t like the fact that William had spent twelve days with the Princess who was said to be an angelic beauty. Although she knew that William was not someone who picked up beautiful girls left and right, she still wasn’t able to stop herself from feeling jealous.

Ian rested her chin on William’s shoulder and gave the Princess a sweet smile. It was a smile that screamed “He’s mine. Fck off, B*tch!”

Morgana almost spat blood from within their Mindscape because her understanding of the handsome Half-Elf had done a complete reversal. With just a glance, she and Princess Sidonie could tell that William wasn’t acting.

The Half-Elf seemed to enjoy Ian’s show of affection and it made the two of them question their taste in men.

[ …Sidonie. Did we make a mistake? ]

‘…’

William was unaware that Princess Sidonie and her other half were questioning their standards in men. Fortunately, William was the first to pull back from the hug and introduce Ian to the Princess, who suffered from culture shock.

“Ian, you already know Princess Sidonie,” William said with a smile. “Princess, this is Ian. He is part of my personal Knight Order.”

Ian extended his hand towards the Princess and the latter subconsciously raised her hand to firmly grip the hand that was extended to her.

“It’s a pleasure to meet you, Princess Sidonie,” Ian said.

“Likewise,” Princess Sidonie replied.

The handshake only lasted for a brief moment, but the two stared daggers at each other. Ian could tell that the Princess was somehow interested in William, so she decided to do everything in her power to prevent the two of them from getting close.

She would not allow William to increase the number of his lovers while Est and Wendy were away. The three of them had agreed that they would work together to prevent other girls from clinging to William’s thigh.

The Half-Elf’s thigh had already been claimed by them.

“Big Brother!”

A cheerful and loud voice broke the tension in the air as an adorable loli ran towards William. When she was within range, Brianna jumped towards William’s chest with outstretched arms.

William hurriedly caught the little loli in order to prevent her from getting injured. He then spun her round and round, making Brianna giggle about his ability to go with the flow.

“I missed you, Big Brother,” Brianna said as she looked up at William with upturned eyes. ‘Is Ernest looking at us?’

“I missed you too, Brianna,” William replied with gentle eyes. ‘Yes. He is now on his way here and his face reeks of jealousy. Good job!’

The two conspirators gave each other a wink as they continued to hug, making the youngest Prince of the Hellan Kingdom extremely jealous.

“Sir William, I think it’s about time that you let go of my fiance,” Prince Ernest stated. “I thought that I made it clear last time that I know that what both of you are doing is just an act to make me jealous. Please, stop it. Big Sister, stop bullying me.”

William sighed and patted Brianna’s head. He just couldn’t help but feel playful whenever he was around Brianna. For William, Brianna was the closest to the little sister that he never had.

Whenever they were together, he just wanted to pamper her and spoil her rotten. This was different from how he treated his adorable cousin, Eve. For William, the two of them were precious. One was his family member, the other a non-blood related little sister.

If possible, he wanted both of them to live carefree and happy lives, away from the struggles of war.

“Sorry, Ernest,” Brianna knew that the little Prince was really jealous and it helped her know that the latter really did care for her.

Due to King Noah”s indecision about whether or not he should recognize Briana as Prince Ernest’s official fiance, the little loli always felt like she would be thrown away once her grandfather lost the position of the Great Chief.

Brianna knew that once that happened, she would lose her political value as Prince Ernest’s fiance.

Although she was bubbly and confident on the surface, deep down, Brianna was feeling insecure. This was why she liked being around William. The handsome Half-Elf didn’t care if she was a Princess or just an ordinary girl.

She could feel his sincere familial feelings for her and they made her feel safe and secure by his side.

Sometimes she wondered, if she had met William before she had met Prince Ernest, perhaps…

Briana sighed internally and locked those feelings in the depths of her heart. She was still young and would know the answer when she had grown up a bit more. For now, she was happy to be by Ernest’s side, knowing that the Young Prince truly cared for her as well.

“Sir William, how is the capital?” Prince Ernest inquired. “I-Is his Majesty safe?”

Prince Ernest was aware that all the adults had turned into Crystal Statues because Simon, the Dean of the Academy, had also become a statue a few days after they arrived in the Kyrintor Mountains.

The Great Chief had received them warmly, but he, too, turned into a Crystal Statue when the Aurora Borealis descended from the sky.

No adults in the Northern Regions were spared from the Continental Spell. Right now, the one taking charge of all of the Tribes was none other than Briana.

In the absence of the Great Chief, her father, mother, and uncle, Briana was the highest authority among the Northern Tribes.

She was now currently the Great Chieftain and was doing her best to ensure that the tribes would be able to function. Fortunately, the Northerners were both warriors and hunters. Just like every strong faction in the continent, the tribes didn’t lack prodigies who stood out from among the rest. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

These prodigies were currently working hand in hand with the survivors of their own tribes to provide food and security to their people.

“I welcome your return to the Kyrintor Mountains,” a female voice said as a blue portal appeared in front of William. The Oracle that served the Demigod of the Northern Regions appeared.

William was surprised because The Oracle hadn’t been affected by the Continental Spell. This made him affirm that the King of Goats had already known that this was going to happen and had sheltered his Oracle in order to prevent her from being turned into a crystal statue.

“Lady Briana, you are doing a fine job in leading the survivors,” The Oracle said with a smile. “Our Lord is very satisfied with your management. He told me to tell you that you have His blessings and may you continue to strive to ensure that the Tribes will continue to thrive, despite the hardships that we are currently facing.”

Briana bowed respectfully to The Oracle with her hands pressed over her chest. “My Sovereign’s will is my will. I will serve according to His Excellency’s wishes.”

The Oracle gave Brianna a nod of approval before returning her attention to the red-headed boy who had come all this way to meet with her Master.

“Please, come and visit the First Peak in two days,” The Oracle stated. “My Lord is currently busy and he will see you at the promised date.”

The Oracle turned towards the portal, but she stopped before taking a step inside it.

“The Wind May Blow, But The Ice Will Never Melt,” the Oracle said softly. “We will be waiting for you, Sir William, at the Peak of Divinity.”

After saying those parting words, The Oracle left without turning back. The blue portal disappeared and William signed in his heart. He had wanted to meet with Takam that very day, but the Oracle said that the Demigod was busy.

‘I guess I will have to wait two days before I see him,’ William thought as he allowed himself to be dragged towards the lodging that was prepared for him by Ian.

The two of them had been separated from each other for too long and the mermaid was dying to have a tryst with William, in a world that was meant solely for the two of them.
