Chapter 284: Day Of The Inter-Division Battle [Part 2]

Carter carefully checked his professor’s uniform as he looked at his reflection in the mirror.

He didn’t know how it happened, but he felt something foreign inside his body and went on high alert. Carter was sure that the foreign entity had appeared the day that he had met William face to face.

Because of this, he decided to play it safe and just stayed inside his residence. Fortunately, the entirety of the students in the First, Second, and Third Year students of the Magic Division were already under his command.

He ordered these students to complete the tasks he had left for them to do.

Deep down, Carter was feeling incredibly excited. He tried to remove the foreign invader inside his body, but none of his methods worked. He assumed that this was done by William’s God Essence and his interest in his future vessel grew exponentially.

‘I wonder what other secrets are waiting for me to uncover,’ Carter thought as turned his head to leave his room. ‘Time to start the first phase of my plan.’

The professor activated the suggestion spell and gave out a command. He was looking forward to seeing the expression on William’s face when he saw…

“Wendy, come with me for a while,” Est said with a smile. “There’s something that I forgot in the Magic Division and I will need your assistance.”

Est then turned to look at Ian who stood beside him. “Ian, stay here and take command of the students while I am away. I will return as soon as possible.”

“Understood, Young Master” Ian nodded his head.

Est left the Grand Coliseum with Isaac and Wendy following behind his back. The system didn’t detect anything suspicious with their conversation since Wendy was the Magic Division’s Secretary, and one of Est’s officers

Upon arriving at the premises of the Magic Division, Est took Wendy to the garden. It was the same garden where Wendy had brought William, when he accidentally wandered inside their Division.

Wendy was quite familiar with the path because it was the same path that led them to her “Secret Place”. Just as she expected, Est stopped in front of the statue.

“Head Prefect, what are we doing here?” Wendy asked.

Est looked at the statue as if he was admiring its beauty. A few seconds later, a sigh escaped his lips as he said the words that had been locked up inside his heart for a very long time.

“It’s not fair,” Est said with his back still facing Wendy. “I was the one who saw him first. Why must you get in the way?”

“Head Prefect?”

“Wendy, why must you get in the way? Can’t you just find other boys to become your boyfriend? Why must you choose William of all people?”

Est then turned to look at Wendy with a hateful expression. “Why?! Why must you get in the way of my love?! Answer me! Why?!”

Wendy was shocked by the sudden change in Est’s expression. She didn’t expect to see the hate-filled look on the handsome boy’s face, and she could tell that he really hated her to the bone.

“I-I don’t understand,” Wendy stuttered. “What does the Head Prefect mean by getting in the way of your love? What does this have to do with Will?”

“You don’t understand?” Est laughed in contempt. “What is there to not understand? I was the one who saw him first. I was the one who loved him first. For four years, I always thought of him. Then, someone like you came along and snatched him from me! Tell me? How should I deal with this hate I am feeling right now? Answer me!”

Aside from the Mind Weaver spell, Carter had also added another spell called “Dark Desire” in the latest batch of candies that he had distributed among the students of the Magic Division.

Like the name suggested, it is a spell that would bring out the deepest and darkest desire within a person’s heart. Est’s love for William was distorted due to the corruption of his Sea of Consciousness and the spell Dark Desire multiplied this corruption tenfold.

Right now, Est hated Wendy with a vengeance. The only reason why he hadn’t attacked the young lady in front him was due to Carter’s absolute order to keep her alive.

“H-Head Prefect, you love Will?” Wendy asked. “B-But, both of you are…”

Before Wendy could even finish her words, she felt a sudden pang of pain behind her neck before her world descended into darkness.

Isaac was there to support Wendy’s body and prevented her from falling on the ground. After the deed was done, the statue moved aside revealing Carter with his hands behind his back.

“Bring her inside,” Carter ordered.

Est and Isaac nodded and brought Wendy inside the secret passage. The two spells had firmly taken hold of their Sea of Consciousness and they thought that what they were doing was the right thing to do.

After the three children were inside the secret passage, Carter then looked in the direction of the Grand Coliseum and sneered.

“I don’t know if you can hear me or not, but if you don’t hurry, I might get impatient and have fun with your girlfriend. I’ll only give you half an hour to get here.” Carter smiled in a lecherous manner. “Don’t keep me waiting, or else…”

Carter chuckled as he entered the secret passage. Not long after, the statue moved to block the entrance as if the earlier incident had never happened.

——

‘I’ll kill you!’ William screamed internally as he rushed towards the Magic Division. The moment Isaac attacked Wendy, the system immediately informed William of what was happening. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

William’s eyes were already bloodshot as he used his movement technique to its limit. The Grand Coliseum was not that far from the Magic Division. At most, it would only take him five minutes to reach his destination.

However, every second that passed felt like years to him. For some reason, the system’s trackers weren’t working inside the secret cavern that was hidden in the garden of the Magic Division.

What William and Wendy didn’t know was that the Underground Lake had another secret exit near the teacher’s residences. The moment Carter stepped into that place, the system’s tracking on him had been cut off.

Naturally, the system had reported this anomaly to William, but as the Head Prefect of the First Years, he just couldn’t leave them when the tournament was about to start. He planned to investigate Carter’s whereabouts after the opening ceremony had finished.

However, William and the system didn’t expect that the Professor had this trump card hidden up his sleeve.

The Half-Elf had never run this fast in his lifetime. He was pushing himself to the limit just to arrive a second sooner, so he could save Wendy from the clutches of the lecherous professor who had been targeting her from the start.

When William arrived at the garden, he immediately moved the hand of the statue to allow him entry into the secret passage.

A few seconds later, he arrived at the underground lake and saw Wendy tied up on one of the walls of the cavern with steel chains. William breathed a sigh of relief because aside from being unconscious, she was completely unharmed.

“Well, that was faster than I expected,” Carter said with amusement. He was leaning on the cave wall not far from where Wendy was chained.

Est, and Isaac, on the other hand, stood beside Wendy with their weapons drawn and pointed at her body.

“What do you want?!” William roared. “Release Wendy right now!”

“Okay. I’ll release her,” Carter replied with a smile. “That is what you wanted to hear, right?”

Carter sneered. He then waved his hand and erected a Magic Barrier around Wendy, Est, and Isaac. He didn’t want to take any chances, and he knew that he had the upper hand in this situation.

He had waited for this moment for days, and he would not allow William to escape his grasp. As long as he had a hostage, the Half-Elf would be forced to listen to his demands.

“What do you want?” William said through gritted teeth.

The Half-Elf had been secretly calculating the best way to save Wendy, but the Professor’s magic barrier prevented him from doing anything reckless. It was at this moment when he realized that he wasn’t dealing with a small fry, but a cautious person that had planned this scenario in order to lure him into a trap.

Carter appraised William from where he stood. The longer he looked, the more satisfied he was with the new vessel that he would soon be inhabiting.

“Drink this first,” Carter said as he threw a vial that contained a purple liquid towards the boy. “Only by drinking this will we start our conversation.”

William caught the vial and appraised its contents. He hesitated after reading the information of the vial, but he still drank it in the end.

Soon, William felt his world spin around him as he fell down on his knees. Carter’s smile widened as he walked towards the fallen boy who was suffering from the effect of the special serum that he had made.

“Such strong willpower,” Carter said as he lifted William’s chin with his finger. “Very admirable.”

“Fck you!” William said through gritted teeth.

Carter didn’t seem to be offended by William’s words, instead he took out another vial from his pocket. He then used his hand to pry open William’s mouth and poured its contents inside it.

“I know that you’re not an ordinary person, so I’m not taking any chances,” Carter stated. “Here, have another.”

After emptying the second vial, Carter took another one and forced William to drink it.

William’s eyes rolled into the back of his head as he lost consciousness completely. After checking the boy’s vital signs, the professor lifted the boy’s body with one hand. The Half-Elf hung limp in Carter’s hold like a puppet waiting to be manipulated by a puppeteer.

“The two of you guard the entrance,” Carter ordered. “Do not leave your spot until I tell you. Understood?”

“”Yes.”” Est and Isaac walked towards the passageway and left the underground lake. Est gave the unconscious William a brief glance before turning his head away. As he walked towards the exit of the cave, a single tear streamed down the side of his face.

He wiped it away in a casual manner as if it was a nuisance. Carter didn’t see this because he wasn’t paying attention to anyone aside from the boy in his hand. The reason why he ordered Est and Isaac to leave was because he would start the process of taking over William’s body.

Although the two teenagers were under his spell, there was a small chance for the both of them to regain control over their senses after seeing Carter’s true form.

When Carter felt that the two kids were now outside the cavern and guarding the entrance, he then activated the spells embedded in the students inside the Grand Coliseum to proceed with the next phase of his plan…

‘Go on my little pets,’ Carter said as he empowered the spell that lay dormant within the consciousness of the students under his command. ‘Start a massacre. Kill as many as you can! Cover the Coliseum grounds with the blood of your friends and acquaintances! Kill for me! Offer your lives as a sacrifice for my rebirth!’

Carter’s laughter echoed off the walls surrounding the underground lake. The moment he had been waiting for was finally at hand!
