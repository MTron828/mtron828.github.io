Chapter 609: Such A Waste Of Good Genes

Ruyi Jingu Bang extended and increased its size.

The Yara-ma-yha-whos who had already entered the pathway shrieked as the tip of the golden staff, smashed unto their bodies until it slammed on the wall of the intersection.

William could feel a powerful resistance that was resisting Ruyi Jingu Bang’s blow. He knew that it was the laws of the world that prevented the destruction of the walls of the maze.

However, what was Ruyi Jingu Bang?

It was a weapon that could increase its length, size, and weight.

William roared as he continued to increase Ruyi Jingu Bang’s size. It was at that moment when several cracks appeared on the wall that had already turned the little vampires into meat paste.

With a loud crack, the wall finally collapsed. The Half-Elf didn’t relent and charged forward. The weapon in his hand answered his call and glowed brightly. All the walls in front of them were smashed to pieces.

“Chiffon!”

“Un!”

William and Chiffon ran as fast as they could as the Half-Elf used Ruyi Jingu Bang as a battering ram.

Immediately, the blinking red dots in the map were alerted and immediately swarmed towards them.

William decreased Ruyi Jingu Bang’s length, but not its width. If you look at this scene from afar, it would appear that the red-headed teenager was holding a giant bazooka.

“Quick Shot War Arts, First Form!” William shouted. “Destroy everything in your path!”

“Railgun!”

A powerful explosion took place that sent William skidding tens of meters from where he stood. The recoil of the attack made his body creak as the bones on his arms cracked.

The Half-Elf endured the pain and began running. Sun Wukong was one of the most indestructible beings in creation. Although his bones had cracked, they were healing at a very rapid rate.

Meanwhile, all the monsters that had flooded the destroyed walls were obliterated to bits. This included the larger beasts that looked like a Cockatrice, that were rumored to have the ability to turn living creatures into stone.

Although William had destroyed the first wave of monsters, more came. He plucked out a few strands of his hair and blew on them, creating clones.

The clones’ roles were to only protect them from the monster attacks, while William’s role was to keep smashing the walls until they reached the center of the maze.

William was forcefully breaking the laws of the domain using Ruyi Jingu Bang, but this also came at a price. The duration of his Heroic Avatar was being sapped quite quickly.

With a loud shout, the Half-Elf smashed the final wall that blocked their way.

Chiffon’s eyes widened when she saw what seemed to be a giant red oak tree. At its center, a rectangular red portal shone eerily.

“Chiffon,” William said as he held her hand. “Let’s go.”

“Yes,” Chiffon replied as she firmly held William’s hand.

Thousands of monsters were rushing behind them, so the two didn’t think twice and ran towards the red portal.

As soon as their bodies passed through it, a devilish chuckle echoed within the maze of the 51st Floor.

The chuckle sounded amused, and was even filled with anticipation. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

After hearing this chuckle, the monsters stopped their advance and dispersed as if nothing had happened. The broken walls that William had smashed slowly returned to its original state. A few minutes later, all the traces of the battle disappeared.

The only thing that remained was the devilish laughter that belonged to the Lord of the Devil’s Floor.

Meanwhile, in the Kraetor Empire…

Kenneth had just defeated his opponent, which made him one of the final contestants in his division. Right now, his final opponent was Eleazar Blackthorn who was lucky enough to get the free pass on the ballot draw, due to having an uneven number of participants.

As he walked down the arena, he glanced at the lightly-tanned young lady, who was wearing light-weight leather armor.

The lady returned his gaze with a smirk that seemed to be asking, “What are you looking at?”

Kenneth averted his gaze as he walked towards the seats that were reserved for the contestants of the tournament. He didn’t want to create any trouble during his stay because it would only complicate his mission.

Lilith snorted as he turned her gaze back at the arena. For her, Kenneth was too delicate looking to match her preferences. As an Amazon who was looking for a potential partner, looks, bearing, and strength was important.

‘He is strong, but too girly looking,’ Lilith thought. ‘Such a waste of good genes.’

The young Amazon shook her head lightly as she walked towards the arena. Her opponent was not a stranger to her. They had met several times when she was exploring dungeons and domains, and every time they met, they would always battle each other.

“My Dear Lilith, tell me, are we perhaps fated to be together?” Ged asked with a smile. “I don’t know why the two of us always ended up fighting each other, but, there must be a deeper meaning to this, yes?”

Ged was well-known as the bastard prince of the Tenser Empire. He refused to get the surname of the Royal Family and settled for her mother’s family name, which was Walker. This earned him the scorn of the Royal Family, but none of them dared to do anything underhanded to the bold teenager.

The Emperor favored him because of his fighting prowess, and allowed him to attain some degree of freedom. Although everyone called him a bastard, he was still recognized as a Prince by one of the powerful Empires that stood in the Central Continent.

Lilith chuckled as she nodded her head in agreement. “You’re not bad, Ged. Your looks, and physique are passable, but you are a softie inside. You know that I don’t like softies.”

“How bold of you to assume that I have an interest in you.” Ged crossed his arms over his chest and grinned. “Having you as a wife or concubine will be the death of me.”

“Don’t be like that. If I don’t really find a suitable partner, I will consider you as my last resort.”

“Should I be honored then?”

“You should.”

Ged shook his head because they had already had this conversation countless times before. Lilith was a beauty, even among the Amazons, but Ged only thought of her as a good friend. Aside from her good looks, Ged abhorred her vices like gambling and theft.

What he wanted was a loyal and virtuous lady, and not a powder keg that could blow up at any moment.

“Well then, how about we have a bet for old times sake?” Lilith asked as she summoned a short sword and a shield.

Ged summoned a two handed sword and made a few casual swings. “Go on. I’m listening.”

“If I win, you become my servant for a month,” Lilith stated. “If you win, I’ll be your servant for a month. Do we have a deal?”

“Only on the condition that neither of us will have the authority to auction or sell each other in order to gain profit,” Ged replied.

“Tsk!”

“You never change, Lilith.”

After that light banter, the two clashed at the center of the arena, leaving the referee dumbfounded.

“I still haven’t said the start of the battle,” the referee muttered helplessly.

To his credit, no one paid attention to him and only focused their gazes at the two combatants who were exchanging blows with sneers on their faces.
