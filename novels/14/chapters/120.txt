Chapter 120: Reunion After Four Years

“This is the place that you are looking for,” the patrol guard said as he looked at the address that William had given him. “Come with me.”

The patrol guard walked towards the gates, while William and Ella followed behind him.

Before the guard and William could even introduce themselves, the gates opened and a familiar old man walked out with a smile.

“It has been a while, William,” Herman greeted the boy in an easy going tone.

“Uncle Herman, it’s good to see you again,” William replied with a smile.

“Well, it seems that the two of you are already acquainted,” the patrol guard commented. “I will now return to my duties. See you around, William.”

“Thank you, Sir, Braun.” William waved goodbye to the kind man who helped him along the way.

When the patrol guard was no longer in sight, Herman led William inside the manor. The smile on William’s face stiffened when a pretty boy stood in front of the main entrance with his arms crossed over his chest.

“You still look as dumb as you where when you were ten years old.” Ian snorted.

“It has already been four years since then and you are still on your period?” William asked. “You should really see a physician. Having a period for so long might mean that you are suffering from a serious illness. Perhaps it has something to do with your brain?”

“You’re still as eloquent as ever.”

“And you’re still as annoying as ever.”

Both boys snorted at the same time. Clearly, although both of them had grown closer, they were still unable to stop their urge to mock each other whenever they met. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“Hah~ why can’t the two of you get along?” Est sighed as he appeared behind Ian. “William, welcome to Gladiolus. I will be your host until you have successfully enrolled at the Royal Academy.”

“I am looking forward to your hospitality,” William walked forward and stretched out his hand for a handshake.

Est held his hand in a firm grip and shook it twice before letting go.

“Let’s go in, I know that you are tired from your journey,” Est said as he made a welcoming gesture. “We’ve also prepared the best hay for Ella.”

“Meeeeeh.”

“You’re welcome, Ella.”

Est would always do his best to communicate with Ella even though he couldn’t understand her language like William. This was one of the reasons why William thought that Est was an interesting person.

Besides, Ella was a good judge of character. She had already told William long ago that Est was a good person. Naturally, William trusted his Mama’s judgement so he was quite happy to have Est as his friend.

Est led them to the living room where a beautiful lady, with long-blonde hair and green eyes, was waiting for them. She was seated on a chair and was looking at William with kind eyes.

“William, I would like to introduce you to my mother, Elizabeth Wells Newmont. Mother, this is my good friend William, William Von Ainsworth.”

“It’s a pleasure to meet you, My Lady.” William bowed his head respectfully.

“The pleasure is all mine, William,” Elizabeth said with a smile. “I’ve heard a lot of things about you from Est. Ah, feel free to call me Mother from now on.”

“Mother!” Est pouted as he clung to Elizabeth’s dress.

William found Est’s reaction really cute, but he kept a neutral expression on his face. He didn’t want to leave a bad first impression on Est’s mother.

“What a fine young man you are,” Elizabeth praised. “You would be the perfect husband for my daughter… If I ever have a daughter.”

Elizabeth gave Est a sidelong glance before focusing her attention to William. The expression on Est’s face was priceless and Elizabeth was finding it hard to hold back the laughter that was bubbling up inside her chest.

“I would definitely marry your daughter, if you have one, My Lady,” William replied with a shameless grin.

“Well, you’d better remember your words, Little Will,” Elizabeth chuckled. “Who knows what the future will bring?”

“Of course.” William nodded. “Good looking men must know how to keep their promises.”

“I’m liking you more and more.” Elizabeth was quite satisfied with William’s attitude. He wasn’t like those noble heirs who were arrogant and stuck up. Est’s mother admired William’s boldness and his sense of humor.

‘Well, I can’t force this issue,’ Elizabeth thought. ‘It would be best to let nature take its course.’

William and Ella were treated as VIP’s in the Newmont residence. Even Ian did his best not to taunt William in front of Elizabeth. The hours passed by as Elizabeth listened to William’s tales about Lont and life in the countryside.

Elizabeth had been born a noble and lived by the side of her young lady after she came of age. After they were sent to the Hellan Kingdom, a few things happened and she was forced to leave her best friend’s side.

Even so, the two of them still held deep feelings for each other and their sisterhood had remained strong over the years.

William’s tale was like a refreshing breeze that reminded her of her younger years.

“One of these days, I’ll go and visit Lont,” Elizabeth said after hearing William’s tale. “Perhaps the fresh air of the countryside will revitalize my monotonous lifestyle.”

“The life in Lont is crude, but it has a rustic charm that you wouldn’t find in the city,” William was like a salesman that was about to close a deal. “It’s the perfect place to retire and live your days in peace.”

“Sounds like heaven.”

“It is a piece of heaven that is nestled at the Western Edge of the Kingdom. I’m sure that you will love it, Lady Elizabeth.”

“I wish for that as well, Little Will.”

“My Grandpa might be stingy to pests, but he treats guests like old friends. Perhaps, the two of you will get along, My Lady.”

“Oh my~ I’m really looking forward to meeting your Grandpa.” Elizabeth chuckled. ‘It would be best if I lay the foundations for a good relationship between our families.’

William didn’t know what Elizabeth was thinking because he was very happy at the moment. He could tell that the beautiful woman before him was really interested in visiting his hometown.

After an early dinner, William and Ella retired to the room that was specially prepared for them. It was very spacious and had a large bed. The moment William laid his head on the pillow, he immediately fell asleep. He had been camping for the past few days and sleeping outside was not as comfortable as sleeping on a bed that seemed to be made from a marshmallow.

Ella laid by his side because the bed was more than big enough to accommodate the two of them. She, too, was tired from their travels. The sound of light snores echoed along the walls of the room as the two guests slept with a dreamless sleep.

“Est, William is exactly how you described him to be,” Elizabeth said as she patted her son’s head. “A very interesting, yet mysterious, boy. It’s a pity that his magic power has been sealed.”

“I’m worried about the treatment that he will receive from the academy.” Est sighed. “Most likely, he will be sent to the Martial Classes since he’s unable to use magic.”

“You don’t need to worry about him,” Elizabeth replied. “Someone who has stepped forward to hold the falling sky for you will not be affected by the petty system in the Royal Academy. In fact, I am looking forward to the mischief that he will cause.”

Elizabeth chuckled despite herself. “I already feel sorry for the Dean of the Royal Academy. He is going to get one troublesome freshman this year.”

Est imagined William doing something mischievous and couldn’t help but laugh as well. He also felt that William was not someone who would take things lying down. He had already seen how he handled the situation with the disciples of the Misty Sect back in Lont.

‘Besides… I trust him,’ Est thought as a blush appeared on his face. ‘He will definitely create waves the moment he enters the Royal Academy. I am also looking forward to seeing how much he has improved over the four years that we haven’t seen each other.’
