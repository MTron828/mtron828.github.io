Chapter 311: Sancus and William’s Fated Meeting [Part 1]

William looked at the beautiful Goddess in front of him with a smile on his face. His eyes glowed with power as his Incubus Class reached its Max Level.

Because his powers had been unsealed before his battle with Carter. This allowed Eros, the Goddess of Lust, to teach William how to utilize his newfound powers to their full potential.

Just like the Special Domains that Issei and Lily used to train William, Eros had also taken him to her own Domain to be trained. Three months inside the Domain was equivalent to three days in Hestia. Aside from training William to resist her charms, Eros also taught him how to wield his demonic powers.

The Incubus Job Class allowed William to make and control illusions, enter a person’s dream, drain the life force of others, and also a very rare ability that had a chance to copy a person’s special skill through love making. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

This copying skill was the skill he gained after absorbing the blood of the Goddess. Even among the Incubi that existed in the multiverse, only a handful had this ability. These were the people that had been personally blessed by Eros to become her champions.

Being an Incubus wouldn’t be complete without the power of seduction. Naturally, William also gained an ability that was similar to Charm. This skill was called “Kiss of Seduction”. However, since he was still a Pseudo-Incubus, he was unable to use this skill.

Unlike the other Job Classes that he acquired, the Incubus Job Class didn’t have any advanced classes.

William didn’t mind because he didn’t have any intention to take the Incubus Class to a higher stage. For him, being an Incubus was no different from being a full-fledged womanizer. Belle had told him that she would only allow him to have nine wives. Since that was the case, the incubus Job Class wasn’t a good option for him to explore.

Still, this class also came with many benefits. It allowed William to gain access to the Dual Cultivation Skill, which allowed him, and his lovers, to gradually become stronger after they cultivated together.

It also gave him a +100 Enhancement Bonus to all stats while the Incubus Job Class was equipped.

Being an Incubus didn’t give him immunity to Eros’ Charm Skill. However, William was still able to resist it to a certain extent. For Eros, this was already good enough because even Gods would have a hard time resisting her Divinity if she unleashed her full powers.

“Well then, this will be the end of your training, Little Will,” Eros smiled as she patted the boy’s head. “Make sure to keep your promise, okay?”

“Thank you, Your Excellency,” William replied respectfully. “I will keep my promise.”

“Good. It’s quite unfortunate that you can’t be my follower because you already have Gavin. Even so, make sure to visit my Temple after you’ve come of age. If you don’t do that, you’ll be sorry~”

“I will keep my promise, Your Excellency.”

Eros was quite satisfied with William’s character. Because of this, she wished that her daughters would pick him to become their lover in the future. Truth be told, Eros didn’t train William just because her daughters took a liking to him.

The Goddess of Lust wasn’t that generous. All the Incubi and Succubi in existence were handpicked by her personally. She wouldn’t bestow her powers on just any random passerby. Even if William was favored by four Gods, that wasn’t enough for Eros to make her move.

If not for the direct order she had received from the most “Ancient” Primordial Goddess, she wouldn’t have a reason to get in touch with the boy.

The order of the Primordial Goddess was simple.

Turn William to a Pseudo-Incubus and train him to resist Charm and Mind Affecting Spells.

Because of this order, Eros’ interest in the boy was piqued. Since her daughters already had him in their sights, the Goddess of Lust thought that it would also be a good opportunity to get to know the Half-Elf.

However, after training William for three months, she finally understood what kind of boy he was. Eros had a nagging feeling that William would bully her daughters in the not so distant future. Because of this, she made William promise her something, and the boy agreed to it.

After exiting the Domain, Eros suddenly remembered the promise that she had made with the God of Contracts, Sancus.

“William. Are you familiar with the God of Contracts?” Eros asked.

“No,” William replied. “However, I always ask him to preside over the contracts that I make in my world.”

Eros nodded her head as she looked in the distance. She immediately felt Sancus’ presence right after she had left her Domain. It seemed that the God of Contracts was very anxious to meet with William before he reunited with Issei, Lily, and David.

“Wait here for a while,” Eros said. “It seems that the God of Contracts wants to meet with you.”

Eros didn’t wait for William’s reply before she disappeared from where she stood. She reappeared a few seconds later in front of her palace and faced Sancus who was standing outside the gates.

The Goddess of Lust waved her hand and the gates opened wide to allow Sancus to enter.

“Remember, you are not allowed to harm him in any way,” Eros warned. “If you do something funny, you will definitely regret it.”

Sancus smiled and nodded his head. “I won’t harm him. I just want to talk.”

“Fifteen minutes. I’ll only give you fifteen minutes.”

“Thank you.”

Eros moved aside and allowed Sancus to enter her palace. Although she was curious about what Sancus wanted to tell William, the God of Contracts wanted a private meeting.

Since Incubi and Succubi also used contracts to bind the oaths of mortals, Sancus was a business partner that she had to get along with. This was why she respected his request and allowed him to meet William.

Also, it was a good opportunity to have Sancus owe her a favor. Since the God of Contracts had already promised not to hurt William, Eros had no reasons to prevent him from seeing the boy.

The Goddess that was seated on the black throne frowned, but she didn’t make any moves to intervene. Even though she was an Ancient Primordial Goddess, there were certain rules that she had to adhere to in order to keep the peace within the Temple of the Ten Thousand Gods.

‘This is just a minor issue,’ The Goddess thought as she continued to observe Wlliam from afar. ‘This will not affect the bigger picture.’

The Primordial Goddess only cared about the result and not the process. As long as William’s current course didn’t change, having a few bumps along the way could still be tolerated.
