[ Would you like to acquire the Blacksmith Job Class? ]

[ Yes / No ]

“Thank you, Sir Vulcan,” William nodded his head. “I acquired the Blacksmith Job Class.”

“Mmm.” Vulcan, the God of Blacksmiths, who belonged to the Evil Faction, nodded his head.

Lily clapped her hands and looked up at the three-meter-tall god with sparkling eyes. “Thank you, Vulcan! You’re the best.”

“Mmm.”

“I’ll give you chocolates later, okay?”

“Mmm.”

“Oh, you want the wine flavored ones? No problem! I’ll give it to you in a while.”

“Mmm.”

William watched in bewilderment. He didn’t know how Lily was able to understand Vulcan’s words, because no matter what kind of question the Loli Goddess asked, the God of Blacksmiths would only answer with a “Mmm”.

“We’ll be visiting the others, thank you again, Vulcan!”

“Mmm.”

Lily picked up William and exited the hot smithy. Issei and David stayed outside because they were not close with Vulcan. The Loli Goddess had told them that the God of Blacksmiths was a very shy person. This was why he didn’t know many people. Lily only got to know him after they had shared a table at Ambrosia.

Because of that, the Loli Goddess was able to become the friend of one of the most reclusive Gods in the Temple of Ten Thousand Gods.

The three Gods, along with William, continued to stroll around the temple. Whenever they saw an acquaintance, they would politely ask if they would allow William to touch some of their weapons or artifacts.

There were those who accepted their request, while there were some who politely declined. Even though there had been many rejections, there were still others who allowed William to touch their possessions. This allowed the Half-Elf to acquire a variety of different Job Classes for free.

William couldn’t move his eyes off of his status page as he read the information of the Job Classes that he had acquired, especially the Prestige Classes. If he was not in the presence of the Gods, he might have been jumping all over the place out of happiness.

Of course, he didn’t do that. Afterall, he had an image to maintain. Issei, Lily, and David, watched with amusement at the dazed Teddy Bear who was staring into space.

‘Time Mage sounds powerful, but I’m very curious about the Ninja Job Class,’ William thought with a serious expression. ‘The Morpher looks fun, too…’

William scratched his head over and over again because he couldn’t decide which among the Prestige Classes he should prioritize next. Soon, he was scratching his head with both paws which made Lily giggle.

“Big Brother, you’re so silly,” Lily picked up the frustrated Teddy Bear from the ground. “Are you having problems choosing the Job Classes you will prioritize?”

“Yes,” William replied and sighed in his heart. “All of them are so good. I can’t decide which I should choose first!”

While Lily and William were having a conversation, a seductive chuckle suddenly reached their ears from behind.

“Oh, my! Such a cute Teddy Bear you have there, Lily!”

A beautiful lady, who seemed to be in her mid-twenties, walked towards them with a sweet smile on her face. Her long reddish-brown hair, that was arranged in a princess-style braid that rested behind her back, glistened from time to time, highlighting her beautiful appearance.

She walked just like a supermodel and William’s gaze locked onto her sensuous body by itself. William gulped as the beautiful Goddess stopped two meters away from Lily. Soon, William’s eyes glazed over as he continued to look at the sensuous lady in front of him.

“Hah~ he’s down for the count,” Issei chuckled.

“He has been completely charmed,” David commented as he played with his beard.

“No mortal living or dead can resist your charm, Eros.” Lily pouted. “Look at what you did to our poor William!”

Eros, the Goddess of Lust and Primal Sexual Desire, covered her luscious lips and giggled. Her charming blue eyes looked at her acquaintances in a mischievous manner. “Don’t be like that, Lily. I haven’t even used my Divinity on the boy. This is just who I am, it can’t be helped.”

“I know that.” Lily sighed as he shook the infatuated Teddy Bear, who was looking at Eros as if she was the love of his life. “Big Brother, snap out of it.”

Lilly kept on shaking the Teddy Bear, but it was of no use. The charm of the Goddess of Lust was the most powerful charm in the Multiverse. Even the Goddesses of Love and Beauty paled in comparison to her ability to charm people.

“Eros, make Big Brother snap out of his daze!” Lily said while placing her right hand on her hip. “Don’t bully him!”

“I know that you guys have been training him inside the Temple.” Eros smiled as she patted Lily’s adorable head. “How about you leave him with me for a few days as well? I’ll help train him as well.”

Lily tilted her head, but she didn’t reject Eros’ offer. She knew that if William trained with her, the possibility of the Half-Elf getting charmed in the mortal world would be near impossible.

“I think it is a good idea,” Issei commented from the side. He then looked at David who was standing beside him. “You are supposed to be William’s next instructor, so you have the final say on this matter.”

David played with his beard and looked at the unresponsive Teddy Bear in Lily’s hands. After careful thought, he firmly nodded his head and gave his approval.

“William is still young and bound to be led astray if someone were to use a very powerful charm skill on him,” David said with a smile. “Eros, can you promise me that he will be immune to Charm and other Mind Affecting Spells after you finish your training with him?”

“Well, I don’t know about other Mind Affecting Spells, but I can guarantee that after my training, he will have a very high resistance against Charm Spells,” Eros replied. “I swear this upon my Divinity.”

The three Gods nodded their heads in recognition of Eros’ oath. When the Gods made an oath using their Divinity, it meant that they would keep their promise till the end of time.

“Alright.” David looked at the sensuous beauty in front of him without batting an eye. “We will leave William to you for a few days. Please, return him to us in one piece.”

“I will.” Eros nodded.

Issei, Lily, and David had an idea why Eros had approached them. Since they had been watching over William, naturally they also knew the identity of the people he had recently interacted with.

After bidding the three Gods goodbye, Eros embraced the still dazed Teddy Bear close to her chest, as she walked towards her palace.

What she didn’t know was that a certain God was sneakily following her from behind. In his hands was a box. A box that would even make the Goddess of Lust flee in fear at the mere sight of it.

And what he planned to do with the box was…
