Chapter 501: I Thank Whatever Gods May Be For My Unconquerable Soul

“Big Brother!” Princess Aila screamed as she rushed towards Prince Alaric that had been blown away by a spell that had been cast by an Elven Prodigy.

“You’re the Crown Prince of the Zelan Dynasty?” the Elven Prodigy sneered. “Pathetic.”

“Don’t be like that,” another Elven Prodigy commented from the side. “He is still the Crown Prince. If we capture him, we will get merits from the Commander. Also, that girl beside him is not half bad. I call dibs on her, you get the Crown Prince.”

“Haven’t you had your fill of Human girls yet? You have almost bedded over a hundred of them.”

“How can those women compare to a princess? Don’t worry, after I’m done with her, you can play with her next.”

“Sounds good. I’ll take you up on that offer.”

Princess Aila ignored the two Elves and focused her attention on her Big Brother. She used her Life Magic to cure his injuries, and ensured that his life would no longer be in danger.

The Elven Prodigy who called dibs on Princess Aila whistled when he saw her use Life Magic. It was a rare magic, even among the Elves. Someone who was born with this magic would be sent to the forest where their Spiritualists resided, to be trained as a healer.

The other Elven Prodigy sighed when he saw this. If he had a choice between Crown Prince Alaric and Princess Aila, he would definitely choose the latter. For him, a Crown Prince’s life was nothing compared to a talented Life Mage.

While this was going on, King Minos’ and Drauum’s battle had reached its climax. The Ancient Golem played a dirty trick and attacked one of the Minotaurs that had accidentally wandered in the path of their battle.

King Minos naturally did his best to protect his people, and that is where the Ancient Golem dealt him a crushing blow that gravely injured him.

The King of the Minotaurs gritted his teeth as he smashed the Earth Spear that had embedded itself on his chest. Fortunately, it didn’t hit his heart, but his movement slowed because of it. Drauum used this to his advantage and immediately gave King Minos a beating.

Ezkalor clicked his tongue when he saw this, while Zyphon only shook its head. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Enero, and the Purple-Haired Woman snorted, while the teenage boy just gave a devilish smile.

Regardless of how it transpired, the result was already obvious. Drauum threw King Minos to the center of the city. The King of MInotaurs crashed to the ground and created a crater, sending dust and rubble flying everywhere.

“This war is already over!” Drauum shouted. “Surrender or d-“

The Ancient Golem wasn’t able to finish his words because a loud sound spread across the battlefield. At first they thought that it was just some random noise that the Defenders were using to scare them.

However, they then realized that there was a certain pattern to the noise that resembled music.

Yes, it was some kind of music.

A music that made anyone who heard it feel a sense of tension.

Drauum and the other Guardians narrowed their eyes as they looked in the direction of the castle.

Suddenly, a powerful and unyielding voice reverberated across the city of Gladiolus

-

“Out of the night that covers me,

Black as the pit from pole to pole,

I thank whatever Gods may be,

For my unconquerable soul.”

William walked down the stairs that was leading to the palace with even steps as he gazed fearlessly at the smoke-filled city that was in ruins.

“In the fell clutch of circumstance, I have not winced nor cried aloud,” William said as he continued to walk down the stairs. “Under the bludgeonings of chance, my head is bloody, but unbowed.”

Princess Sidonie’s and Morgana’s expressions changed as they observed their beloved. With a glance, they could tell that something was very different about William. However, they couldn’t determine what it was.

All they knew was that the person that they had loved had returned, and had come to save the people that were important to him.

William continued to walk, unimpeded as he quoted the rest of the poem that had left an impression on him back on Earth. A poem that had given him hope when everything was lost.

“Beyond this place of wrath and tears

Looms but the Horror of the shade,

“And yet the menace of the years

Finds and shall find me unafraid.”

Countless portals appeared behind him, and in the sky. They illuminated the surroundings in a bright light, and yet, those that came out of it, made everyone shiver in disbelief.

Even the Guardians of the Silvermoon Continent flinched because the pressure that descended on them was on par with their current strength.

“It matters not how strait the gate,

How charged with punishments the scroll…”

William raised the scepter in his left hand and pointed it at Drauum who took the role as the leader of the Elven Invaders.

“For I am the master of my fate,” William declared. “I am the captain of my soul.”

(A/N: This poem is called Invictus by: William Ernest Henley.)

A Giant Ox with Dark-Blue Skin stood right behind William. Blue flames poured out of its eyes, shoulders, hands, and feet. It gave a mighty roar that spread far and wide.

Elandorr, who was standing in the center of the Elven Army, trembled when he recognized the Giant Ox standing behind William. How could he possibly forget the creature? The Elven Commander had its Millennial Core inside his storage ring.

Erchitu raised his hand.

Suddenly, the Storage Ring of the Blademaster that had killed him glowed briefly.

A few moments later, A Giant War Axe made of Adamantium flew out of it. It traveled at a straight path until it was caught by a large and powerful hand.

The Bone Dragons carrying the Diabolical Death Knight, Grim Nightmare Revenant, and Arcane Spectral Lich hovered above William.

The Arcane Spectral Lich glanced at its surroundings and the blue flames that glowed on its hollow eye sockets turned red.

“Unforgivable,” The Arcane Spectral Lich said with undisguised anger.

He was the first King of the Hellan Kingdom, so it was impossible for him to not recognize the Kingdom that he had built. The Lich glared at the Elves, but it didn’t attack them right away. He was not the commander of this army.

The one who would give the orders, was the one holding the Scepter that commanded the entire Undead Legion.

Nuckelavee chuckled evilly as it raised its spear and pointed it at the Elves. One of the races that it had fought during the Era of the Gods were the Elves. They were among the races that had ganged up against the Humans, thousands of years ago.

Seeing his old enemies, the Devil of the Sea that had been trapped in the Undying Lands was now feeling giddy. Just like the Arcane Spectral Lich, it was holding itself back for the massacre that was about to occur.

William raised his right hand, and four colorful lights flew towards his body. He had recalled Wendy, Ashe, Thor, and Ragnar back to the Thousand Beast Domain where they would be safe from the second round of battle that was about to ensue.

Although they were injured, the system had assured him that their lives weren’t in danger. For this, William was thankful.

The Half-Elf then glanced at Dia who had weakly called out to him from afar. Est leaned against her body as he looked at William with a relieved expression.

“Do you want to stay?” William asked.

Est nodded his head. “I want to see its end.”

William gave her a brief nod before shifting his gaze back towards his adversaries. He didn’t try to dissuade Est’s decision. Since his lover wanted to see how this war would end, he would let her witness it all, while sitting in the front row seats.

William scanned the faces of the Elves before stopping on the Ancient Golem. William had to admit that Drauum had given him a lot of headaches in the past. That was how strong the Guardian of the Elves was.

Then, two more Guardians appeared which had completely flipped the scales of the battle in the Elves’ favor.

The red-headed boy chuckled. The once scary existence that had forced him into a corner, was now like a bug in his eyes. A bug that he had long wanted to crush beneath his foot.

“You said a while ago for everyone to surrender, or die, right?” William sneered at Drauum. “Don’t worry, I won’t ask you to surrender.”

William channeled his will into Malacai’s Scepter before a devilish smile appeared on his face.

“Tell me, you bastard Elves,” William said in a teasing tone. “Would you like to try dying once?
