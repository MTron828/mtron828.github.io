——

Half an hour earlier…

“Big Sister, isn’t this the area where the instructors have their own residences?”

“That’s right.”

“Wait. You mean to say that the one who makes the candies is an instructor?” Wendy asked in disbelief.

“That’s right,” Charlotte replied with a smile. “And we have arrived at our destination.”

Wendy gazed at the small gate that led to a three-storey house. This house was located on the outskirts of the Teacher’s residences and no other houses were around it.

“Let’s go inside,” Charlotte said as she firmly held Wendy’s hand and led her inside the gate.

“Big Sister, can we really enter without permission?” Wendy inquired.

Charlotte chuckled and patted Wendy’s head, “You’re such a worrywart. Of course, I have already gotten permission from the instructor. Just relax your little head and follow me.”

Wendy’s Big Sister opened the front door and invited her in as if she was the owner of the place. Charlotte then guided her to the second floor where Carter’s room was located.

For some reason, Wendy suddenly felt a sense of anticipation in her heart. She thought that it was just her curiosity about finding out who the candy-maker really was making her heart beat a little faster than normal.

Charlotte then knocked on the door to announce their presence, “Professor, it’s me.”

“Come in,” a gentle voice replied from the other side of the door.

Charlotte opened the door to the room and signaled for Wendy to enter before her. The latter obeyed her Big Sister’s gesture and entered the room obediently. After Wendy had entered the room, Charlotte also stepped inside and closed the door behind her.

She made sure to lock the door properly to ensure that no one would be leaving the room without Carter’s permission.

Wendy’s gaze landed on a handsome man who seemed to be in his early twenties, seated on a chair with a book in hand. He seemed to be reading the book before they arrived and Wendy thought that the image of an esteemed scholar fit him perfectly.

“Allow me to do the introductions,” Charlotte said with a smile. “Wendy, this is Professor Carter. He is the Magic Teacher of the Third Years that specializes in Magic Combat. He is also the maker of the candies that you love so much.

“Professor, this is Wendy Armstrong. Although we are not blood related, I treat her as my own little sister. I hope that the two of you get along well.”

“It’s a pleasure to meet you, Ms. Armstrong,” Carter greeted as he stood up from his chair and gave Wendy a respectful bow.

Wendy curtsied like a proper noble and returned Carter’s greeting, “The honor is mine, Professor Carter. It’s a pleasure meeting the maker of those delicious candies. Are all of them really handmade?”

“They are,” Carter answered with pride. “Charlotte has been telling me over and over again how beautiful and talented you are. Seeing you face to face, I have no choice but to agree with her words.”

Charlotte giggled as she walked towards Carter, “You mean to say that you didn’t believe the words I said, Professor?”

Charlotte playfully pounded Carter’s shoulder and the latter only laughed. Seeing the two of them side by side made Wendy’s heart beat faster. The scene reminded her of how she and William would normally interact when it was only the two of them inside his dormitory room.

“Ah! I almost forgot.” Carter lightly tapped his head as if he had really forgotten something important. “I just made a new product and I am looking for someone to do a taste test. Ms. Armstrong, are you willing to give it a try?”

Carter took something out from his pocket and unwrapped it. Inside was a red candy that was as dark as blood.

Wendy swallowed unconsciously the moment her eyes landed on the candy. It was as if she had been unable to direct her gaze anywhere save on the crimson candy that lay harmlessly in the professor’s palm.

Carter smiled and lightly swung his hand to the left. Wendy’s gaze followed the candy as if her eyes were stuck on it completely. The professor then walked towards the beautiful young lady and extended his hand.

“Do you want it?” Carter inquired.

“I-I…,” Wendy stuttered.

Carter was using the spell that was inside her body to control her emotions in a subtle manner.

“Do you want it?” Carter repeated.

“I… want,” Wendy replied.

Carter chuckled and glanced at Charlotte who was standing beside him.

“Feed this to your little sister,” Carter ordered. He wanted Charlotte to personally do the act because it was more interesting that way.

Charlotte obeyed and picked up the candy from the professor’s palm and slowly approached the young lady who seemed to have lost her ability to think.

“Open your mouth,” Charlotte ordered.

Wendy obediently opened her mouth, which made Carter grin internally.

Charlotte then softly pressed the candy against Wendy’s lips and moved it ever so slowly, like she was applying lipstick on her luscious pink lips.

After completing a full cycle, Wendy’s Big Sister finally slid the candy inside Wendy’s mouth and watched as the girl in front of her fell into a trance-like state.

The candy dissolved the moment it entered Wendy’s mouth. The sweet taste washed away all thoughts that she was currently thinking. Devoid of all thoughts, Wendy felt as if she was floating. She was like a painting that was slowly being stripped of her colors.

Carter watched with a satisfied smile as he looked at the girl that was slowly succumbing to the power of his spell.

Charlotte returned to his side and wrapped her arms around the professor, before kissing his lips. It was as if she wasn’t a least bit worried about what was happening to Wendy, all she cared for was the love of the man whose hands were firmly grabbing her waist.

It didn’t take long before a sigh escaped Wendy’s lips. She blinked once then twice as she looked at her Big Sister kissing the handsome professor in front of her.

Her heart started to beat wildly inside her chest and a sudden heat washed over her body, making her face flush in embarrassment.

“What’s wrong, is this your first time seeing a kiss?” Carter asked.

“N-No,” Wendy stuttered.

“Oh?” Carter raised an eyebrow. “Then, have you kissed someone before?”

“Yes.”

“Who was it?”

“Will,” Wendy replied. “The Knight Commander of the Angorian War Sovereign.”

“Ah… him,” Carter smiled. He didn’t mind Wendy having her first kiss stolen from her. What was important to him was the girl’s chastity that was still intact. He even sneered at the Knight Commander for being too young and too naive to take advantage of the girl that was clearly infatuated with him.

Carter’s gaze, that was fixed on Wendy’s face, slowly shifted downwards. It stopped on her ample chest for a brief moment, before continuing to move down her body. The professor gazed at that “part” as if his eyes could see past through Wendy’s clothes and smiled.

“How is the Knight Commander’s kiss?” Carter asked. “Does it feel good?”

Wendy could feel the warmth spreading into her entire body like an aphrodisiac as Carter empowered the spell that had almost taken over her Sea of Consciousness.

“It feels good,” Wendy replied as she once again fell into a trance. She couldn’t take her eyes off the handsome professor in front of her.

Wendy felt confused, but her thoughts were muddled right now. She couldn’t think straight as the professor raised her chin with his fingertip.

“Would you like to kiss me?” Carter inquired while strengthening his hold over Wendy’s consciousness.

“I-I…” Wendy’s thoughts had turned completely blank. She couldn’t muster any resistance to the spell that was urging her to say yes.

‘Such sublime pleasure,’ Carter thought as he watched the internal struggle in Wendy’s eyes. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

He then slowly lowered his head to taste the girl’s luscious lips that were begging to be kissed.

When the professor’s lips were mere inches away from her own, the image of a red-headed boy appeared in Wendy’s head.

“N-No!” Wendy hastily pushed Carter away and took a few steps back.

Carter was surprised, but soon an evil smile appeared on his lips. It was as if Wendy’s last second struggle was turning him on.

“No?” Carter asked. “No, what?”

“I-I!” Wendy stuttered, but the image of the boy inside her head suddenly disappeared when Carter fully activated the spell inside her Sea of Consciousness.

Wendy’s expression slackened as her beautiful blue eyes clouded over. Carter’s smile widened as he neared the girl.

His prey had already been cornered. All he needed to do was to reach out and make Wendy fall into the abyss of darkness.
