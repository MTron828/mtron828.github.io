Chapter 571: We Need To Get Rid Of That Boy

“Die!” one of the agents of the Agnis Family shouted as he targeted one of the players inside the arena. However, before he could even hit his target, his head exploded and turned into particles of light.

The black-robed man frowned, at his comrade that died out of the blue. His gaze then landed on William who was holding a wooden staff in his hand.

The Half-Elf had a smile on his face, and even winked at the black-robed man before running towards one of the agents.

William brandished his wooden staff, and smashed his target’s head like a watermelon before continuing his rampage.

“Stop him!” the black-robed man ordered. “Kill him first!”

The other agents complied with their leader’s order and circled William to give him no room for escape. It was quite unfortunate that the Half-Elf had no intention of escaping. His goal was to eliminate the subordinates of the black-robed man, before dealing with him for last.

William sneered as he pointed his wooden staff at the approaching agents who had no idea what was in store for them. He waited until they were only thirty meters away from him before activating his war art.

“Quick Shot War Art, Second Form,” William said as he took aim.

“Shotgun!”

Immediately, a loud clap reached the agent’s ears. Two of the black-robed man’s subordinates that had attacked William’s right side, turned into particles of light.

The other agents paused momentarily due to the sound of William’s skill. However, that only lasted for a moment before they continued their advance.

William waved his hand and six purple blades materialized around him. He was currently using the Runemaster Job Class and activating the skills that he had mastered over the years that he had spent in the Southern Continent.

Wendy was the one that had increased the levels of this Job Class, and even developed a few tricks of her own, which she had shared with William. The Half-Elf was quite impressed with Wendy’s ability to create things from scratch, even without the knowledge of skills that came from Skill Trees.

When William asked the System about this, it only said that any kind of skill could be created as long as the theory behind it stood. Since that was the case, WIlliam decided to further enhance his lover’s created skill in order to make it more deadly.

The blades that surrounded William were called Runic Blades. They were blades that dealt Ethereal Damage to their enemies. What made this blade scary was that they ignored armor, and other kinds of defenses.

Although they were not lethal, they had one annoying ability, and that was to drastically weaken those that they had slashed, as well as slow their movements by half.

“Go!” William ordered and the six purple blades flew towards their individual targets.

The agents’ initial reaction was to defend themselves, using artifacts that blocked physical attacks. However, the Runic Blades were more of a spiritual attack, than a physical one. The blades easily passed through their armors, making them feel that their world had slowed down.

After making sure that his targets had a taste of the nasty blades, William charged forward and smashed their heads like watermelons. He knew that if he could dispose of them now, the black-robed man wouldn’t have any allies left when he dealt with him later.

Nine died, six remained.

After seeing William’s performance, the other players rallied behind his back and attacked the six remaining agents that the Half-Elf had pointed out earlier.

Faced with over a hundred people. The black-robed man decided to become serious and activated his Battle Aura.

He was an Adamantium Ranked Warrior.

He was the strongest warrior in the Grand Arena, so he wasn’t too worried about the number of enemies that were charging towards him.

“You think all of you can beat me?!” the black-robed man shouted as he wielded his dual swords. “Die!”

With a powerful slash, a raging inferno snaked towards the approaching players, turning them into particles of light.

Those who managed to dodge the first strike, didn’t survive the second, and were burned completely.

Twenty-four players remained, including William and Chiffon.

Out of those twenty-four, six of them were the agents from the Agnis family, leaving only eighteen players on William’s side.

“I’ll deal with him,” William said as he stood in front of the Black-robed man. “Please, deal with the others.”

The other players exchanged a glance with each other before charging towards the remaining agents.

The agents were stronger, but now that their opponents were working together against them, they were slowly being pushed back.

William’s Runic Blades flew towards the leader of the agents, but the latter easily incinerated them with his fire magic.

The black-robed man had seen how his subordinates had died under William’s attack, so he didn’t underestimate the Blades that flew in his direction.

After destroying the Ethereal Blades, the black-robed man jumped to his right side. A second later, he felt something brush past his body, creating a small scratch on his left shoulder.

‘An invisible energy-based attack?’ the blackrobed man thought as he eyed William with caution. ‘I need to close the distance.’

William clicked his tongue in disappointment because the man was able to dodge his attack. However, this only lasted for a brief moment.

‘I’ll make sure that you won’t be able to run away later,’ William vowed as he closed the gap between them.

Meanwhile, while William was busy fighting the Black-robed man, Chiffon had killed one agent from the Agnis family.

Chiffon was a Brawler.

She had been taught to fight, while she was still young by one of her mother’s attendants. Her fast reflexes, and mobility allowed her to hit her enemies, before they could hit her.

If she were to gain William’s Zen Master Job Class (Monk’s next Job Class), she would be twice as fast, and three times more deadly.

Her Devourer’s Gauntlets also helped her increase her repertoire of skills that she could use at any time. If one were to look closely, they would notice that Chiffon’s feet were actually floating above the ground.

William had told her earlier to use the flight skill, and hover just an inch above ground. Although she didn’t understand why she had to do that, Chiffon was very obedient to William. This was why she didn’t question his order and did as she was told.

The audience that were watching the battle clenched their fist in excitement and frustration.

When they heard William’s words, they thought that the Half-Elf was just spouting nonsense. However, after giving it some thought, they realized that the black-robed man had always been in the arena every time there was a Battle Royale.

They didn’t notice this fact before because the Black-robed man always lost in the end. The audience thought that he was just unlucky, but now that William had exposed their modus operandi, the players that had been stuck in the Second Floor for months, felt cheated.

All of their gazes shifted to the VIP Area, where the Agnis Family was seated. Their blood boiled in anger. If not for the fact that they were the current rulers of the Second Floor, and had formed a contract with the Guardian, they would have already attacked them by now.

“We need to get rid of that boy,” the Patriarch of the Agnis family said as he placed his teacup on the table. “He must not be allowed to remain on the Second Floor of the Tower.” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

The Elders of the family nodded their heads. Although they could tell that their agents were slowly getting the upper hand, they didn’t wish for the hearts of the inhabitants of their domain to be stirred up by the Half-Elf’s words.

Although they had a contract with Tony, the Guardian of the Second Floor, they didn’t wish for any form of rebellion under their nose. Before a small spark could turn into a mighty blaze, they would snuff it out, preventing all sources of future troubles.

While they were thinking this, the majority of the players had been killed by the Agents of the Agnis family.

Only six players remained in the arena.

If one of them died, the battle would be over and the rest would be able to advance to the next round.

William, Chiffon, and the four agents, including the Black-robed man glared at each other.

‘Boss, what should we do?’ an agent asked through a special artifact they used for communication. ‘If we kill one of them, the other will be able to pass. The Patriarch said that no matter what happens, the Half-Elf must stay. Should we target him and leave that pink-haired girl alone?’

The Black-robed man shook his head. ‘None of them must escape. Neutralize them first and we’ll kill them at the same time.’

All the agents nodded their heads in understanding.

“Now!” the Black-robed man ordered and all of them ran in William’s, and Chiffon’s direction.

The two didn’t move and stood their ground.

When the black-robed man was only twenty meters away from the two, the same feeling he had felt earlier nagged at his head.

‘I’m just overthinking things,’ the Black-robed man thought as he ignored his sixth sense. ‘I’ll end this as quickly as possible.’

Fifteen meters…

Ten meters…

Five meters…

When the agents were only five meters away from the two teenagers, a devilish smile appeared on William’s face.

This smile made the hairs on the back of their necks stand on end. A second later, the ground under their feet swelled.

A powerful explosion reverberated inside the Stadium which made the audience, and the members of the Agnis Family cry out in shock due to the unexpected development that none of them was able to foresee.
