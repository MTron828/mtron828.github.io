Chapter 309: Preparation For Departure

“Go to the Northern Regions with Big Sister Brianna?” Prince Ernest frowned after he heard Ian’s proposal. “Why?”

At first, the Young Prince thought that Ian was bearing a message from Est. However, the latter came to see him in order to ask him to accompany him to the Northern Regions, along with Brianna.

“Because, it is what the Knight Commander told me before losing consciousness,” Ian lied. He had anticipated that Prince Ernest would ask him this question, so he had prepared this story beforehand. “He said that it was of the utmost importance that will decide the survival of the Kingdom.”

Brianna, who was listening beside Prince Ernest, had a calm expression on her face. Her Grandfather had taught her how to detect truth from falsehood depending on the tone, and body language of the speaker. Prince Ernest was the same. He also received this kind of training from Simon, the Dean of the Royal Academy, to ensure that no one would be able to trick him with words.

Naturally, both of them realized that Ian was lying. But, the eyes of the boy staring in front of them were resolute. The words he said might be lies, but his conviction was real.

“Is the Knight Commander awake?” Prince Ernest asked after pondering for a while. “Will he be coming with us to the Northern Regions?” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

The Young Prince decided to gather more information from Est’s retainer and William’s subordinate. Leaving the capital during this crucial time was not an easy decision to make. At most, he would need the approval of his father, King Noah, before he could leave the palace and go to the Northern Regions.

Ian shook his head, “The Commander is still unconscious, but he will go with us to the North. Dave, his Knight, is already preparing the provisions that we will need for the journey. It is only your decision that we are waiting for, Your Highness.”

Before Prince Ernest could even give his reply, the three of them heard a knock on the door of the Prince’s Quarters.

Suddenly, the door opened and King Noah, along with the Grand Archmage, Emrys, and Dean of the Academy, Simon, walked inside the room.

King Noah immediately recognized Ian, but pretended that he didn’t know him. He walked towards his youngest son because he had some things to tell him before he departed to the Ravenlord Citadel to raise the morale of the defenders of the Kingdom.

“Prince Ernest, I know that this might be sudden, but the Dean will accompany you to our summer Villa in Wildevein,” King Noah said.

“Your Majesty, may I know why I must leave the capital?” Ernest asked. He could tell that his father seemed anxious and it made him feel as if something bad was going to happen.

King Noah sighed before patting his youngest son’s shoulder. “It’s not safe in the capital. You will be leaving via a secret tunnel and head to Wildevein with the Dean. Wait for me to call you back to the capital. Until then, hide there and stay as lowkey as you can.”

Prince Ernest glanced at Ian who was kneeling in front of the King as per the duties of a Knight of the Kingdom.

“How about I go to the Kyrintor Mountains?” Prince Ernest proposed. “Big Sister Brianna is feeling homesick and it might be good to stay there for a while. What do you think, Your Majesty?”

“The Northern Regions?” King Noah frowned, but it only lasted for a brief moment. He then glanced at Brianna who was standing beside Prince Ernest and nodded his head. “I think this is a better idea. Simon, I’ll leave the arrangements to you. Keep the Prince safe.”

“As you command, Your Majesty,” Simon bowed.

King Noah gave Prince Ernest a light hug before leaving the room. Although it was still noon, he needed to prepare for his departure to the front lines as soon as possible.

“Your Highness, I will take my leave to prepare the things we will be needing for our journey,” Simon said. He was about to leave the room when Prince Ernest stopped him from leaving.

“Master, please, listen to what I have to say first,” Prince Ernest stated. “Knight Ian from the Angorian War Sovereign is already making the necessary arrangements for our trip to the Northern Regions. The Knight Commander will also be accompanying us on this journey. It will be best if we coordinate with them, so that we can leave as soon as possible.”

Simon glanced at Ian and the latter nodded his head in acknowledgement. The Dean of the Academy was very familiar with Est’s retainer and knew that he could be trusted.

“Very well.” Simon nodded. “I have a feeling that the three of you were already planning to leave the capital before the King and I arrive here. Since that is the case then let us just go together. When can we leave, Sir Knight?”

“Two hours from now, Your Excellency,” Ian replied. “We will come to pick up the Prince as soon as we have finished our preparations.”

Simon nodded and told Ian to return after two hours. He still needed to tie up some loose ends before their departure to the Northern Regions.

Prince Ernest and Brianna, on the other hand, started packing their clothes. Although Prince Ernest felt sad to leave the capital, he knew that his Father wouldn’t tell him to go unless there was a good reason behind it.

Meanwhile at the Stronghold facing off against the Zelan Dynasty…

The battle had just ended, but it wasn’t a full blown battle. The Zelan Dynasty wasn’t too keen on having a direct collision with the Hellan Defenders because they had received a report that the forces of the Aenasha Dynasty had already broken through another Fortress and were on their way towards the capital of the Hellan Kingdom.

Unlike the Ant Army, which numbered in the millions and could be treated as cannon fodders, the Great General of the Zelan Dynasty, Raghnall Hakim Aoife, cared for the warriors and the Minotaur Race who served as their Guardian Beasts.

He was just waiting for the Defenders of the Fort to divide their forces to reinforce their capital before going in for the kill. That way, he could minimize the losses of his army and move towards the capital of Gladiolus unhindered.

James and Lawrence stood on the ramparts with serious expressions on their faces. They had also received news from the capital that their forces were now congregating at Ravenlord Citadel.

“Lawrence, take the other Archmages and reinforce His Majesty in defending the citadel,” James said after careful consideration. “Leave the fort to me. I’ll stall for time.”

Lawrence glanced at his old friend and nodded his head. The Old Fox of Griffith understood that, even if they stayed here and defended the fort, it would be all for naught if the capital fell. His only concern was whether James would be able to resist the assault of the Zelanian Army once they left their posts.

“Don’t worry. I can manage.” James patted his friend’s shoulder. “Make haste. We don’t have much time.”

“Don’t die on me, you Old Coot,” Lawrence replied as he patted James’ shoulder. “We still need to talk about our grandchildren’s affair.”

James smiled and nodded his head. Although William had already told him that he had no intention of marrying Rebecca, he still kept mum about it in order to give Lawrence some face.

An hour later, Half of the Defenders-including all of the Archmages-left the fort in order to arrive at Ravenlord Citadel as soon as possible.

The defenders that were left to defend the fort all had determined expressions on their faces. They had already resolved themselves to die in order to protect their kingdom from the invaders who planned to conquer their lands.

James grinned as he faced the opposing army in the distance. Now that the “troublemakers” were gone, it was time for him to negotiate with the Great General from the Zelan Dynasty. The Overlord of Lont may not like the current Royal Family, but he still cared for the citizens of the Kingdom.

“I hope that the Old Executioner accompanied his son to battle,” James narrowed his eyes as he looked at the mighty army across their fortress walls. “Reaching a compromise will be easier if he’s there to mediate the negotiation. I just need to dangle a bait good enough that he won’t be able to resist.”

James had already prepared the bait for his Old Acquaintance. The only question was whether the person he was looking for was with the Zelanian Army or not.
