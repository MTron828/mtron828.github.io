“D-Don’t come any closer! If you come closer I’ll scream!” Wendy said as she backed into the corner of the room.

She was currently wearing a semi-transparent, black, one-piece night dress that covered her curvaceous body. The night dress made her want to bury herself inside a hole due to embarrassment.

When she had seen her adult self wearing this night-dress for the first time, she had secretly felt jealous because the Silver-haired William looked so happy when he saw her in that attire. She had also witnessed how the two shared a passionate night that lasted until four in the morning before they decided to stop their lovemaking.

Now that she was wearing the same night dress, and was in the body of her adult form, Wendy felt like she was about to get eaten whole. She had seen how capable the silver-haired William was in her dreams.

Although she had looked forward to being embraced the same way, her heart only wanted her beloved Half-Elf and not the handsome silver-haired William in front of her.

“Please, there is someone else that I love,” Wendy pleaded. “I want him to be my first. I can’t make love with you.” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

The Silver-haired man stopped walking and the teasing expression on his face disappeared. Wendy thought that the handsome man would not listen to her and continue to approach her if she let her guard down.

However, the man didn’t move from where he stood. Instead he looked at Wendy with eyes filled with affection.

“I’m sorry for teasing you, Wendy,” William said. “I didn’t know that you loved me this much.”

William waved his hand over his face and the adult version of himself appeared in front of Wendy.

Wendy looked at the man’s red-hair and the light-green eyes that looked back at her with love. The blonde beauty’s eyes then stared at the semi-pointy ears that proved her lover’s race, which was indeed Half-Elf.

“W-Will?” Wendy asked half hoping that what she was seeing was true.

“It’s me,” William replied.

Wendy was about to go to him to give him a hug, but hesitated in the end. She didn’t want to make a mistake, so she decided to ask questions first to confirm whether this was the Half-Elf she loved or was just a figment of her imagination.

“How old are you?” Wendy inquired.

“I just turned fifteen a few days ago,” William answered.

“You did?”

“Yes.”

“Why didn’t you tell me?” Wendy frowned. “Does Ashe know?”

William nodded. “She celebrated my birthday with me. She even got drunk and started to kis-“

The Half-Elf abruptly stopped his words, which made Wendy quite curious.

“Go on. Continue.”

“Let’s talk about something else.”

William walked towards Wendy and pulled her into his embrace. Although he didn’t mind talking about how proactive Ashe was in her drunken state, he didn’t want to talk about other women in front of Wendy.

Owen, and the Goddess Eros, told him that talking about another woman in front of another lady would definitely lead to a bad ending. In order to prevent that from happening, William decided to take the lead and stir the conversation away from the topic.

Wendy tried to resist at first, but William’s whispers of love in her ears made her resistance not last long. In the end the two sat on top of the bed, while hugging each other.

“Do you always have this kind of dream?” William asked.

Wendy nodded her head as her face reddened in embarrassment.

“How often do you have this dream?” William inquired. He wanted to know if the frequency of Wendy’s dreams of Asgard matched his own.

“At least twice a week,” Wendy admitted. “However, after returning to our Duchy, the frequency of my dreams increased to four or five times a week.”

Wend raised her head to look at William. “How about you?”

“Two to three times a week as well,” William replied. “They started on the night I gave you my Lollipop.”

“… The night where they did thirty rounds?” Wendy asked.

“Yes. I did it with her thirty roun… what? How did you know that we did thirty rounds?”

“… You did it with her thirty times?”

William suddenly felt a chill run down his spine as beads of sweat formed on his forehead.

“A-At that time I thought that it was only a dream,” William replied. “S-She pleaded that I make love to her while being tied to the bed.”

Wendy snorted. Of course she remembered that scene. How could she possibly forget? It was a very memorable night for her. It taught her a lot of things about how lovers showed their affection to each other.

The blonde beauty then held Wiliam’s shoulder and pinned him down on the bed. “Even if that was only a dream, and the Adult me begged you to do it, you still made love to a different version of me. That is considered cheating. Do you plead guilty to your crime?”

“Y-Yes. I plead guilty.” William didn’t know why, but Wendy’s current strength was similar to the strength of the Valkyrie Captain in his dreams.

It was as if a mountain was pressing on his shoulders and he couldn’t budge from her hold.

Wendy knew that William wasn’t at fault, but she wasn’t able to stop herself from feeling a bit irritated because the adult version of her managed to make love to the boy she liked first. Also, the one thing that made her unable to forget that particular dream was the fact that William had done it thirty times!

She was about to nag at the boy when she felt something warm and hard poking her backside. Wendy turned around to see that the towel that had been covering William’s lower body had been cast aside when she suddenly pinned him down.

Wendy looked at Little William who was standing tall and proud. It was as if it was challenging her to go thirty rounds with him.

The blonde beauty’s face immediately blushed when she remembered that night of intense passion that had been locked away inside her heart.

“I’m sorry,” William said as he placed his hand on the back of Wendy’s neck and gently pulled her close to him. “I was wrong. I didn’t think properly back then.”

His lips pressed over Wendy’s and the latter reluctantly returned his kiss. William coaxed his lover with soft kisses and words of love that made Wendy temporarily forget the crime he had committed.

The next thing she knew, she was lying on the bed with the Half Elf on top of her.

William’s hands and lips wandered all over her body and it sent a shiver down her spine. The grudge and reasoning that she tried to hold on to melted away due to William’s soft and relentless attacks that made her writhe in pleasure.

This was not the first time that William had made love to the body of the Adult Wendy in his dreams. However, this time, it was different. Although the body was not hers, the person inside it was the first girl who had confessed her love to him in this world.

The person that William had recognized as his First Wife.

William kissed, licked, sucked, and bit Wendy all over. He left his mark on his lover’s body to affirm that she belonged only to him.

Wendy had long lost her strength as William used the skills he had learned from Owen and Lady Eros to bring the lady he loved to the peak of pleasure.

The blonde beauty’s body trembled the moment the two of them became one. William was currently in his Incubus Class. The techniques he learned from the Goddess of Lust herself made Wendy’s sweet and sensual voice reverberate inside the room.

“Will… I’m scared,” Wendy said as she wrapped her arms around William’s neck. “I-I feel weird.”

William momentarily paused as he kissed Wendy’s lips. “Don’t be scared. I love you, Wendy.”

Wendy looked at her beloved’s eyes and smiled, “I love you too, Will. Please, make me yours.”

With his lover’s permission, William once again lowered his hips, building up the pleasure with each thrust.

Suddenly, Wendy’s body shivered at the same time that William released his essence deep inside her. The blonde beauty could feel her beloved’s seed filling up her womb and it almost made her lose consciousness due to its intensity.

A minute passed as William and Wendy panted for breath. Both of them didn’t expect that their first union, inside a dream world, would be so intense that they thought that their spirits were leaving their bodies.

After regaining his composure, William looked down at his lover with a fiery gaze. Wendy saw the hungry look in her lover’s eyes and her body trembled in fear and anticipation of what was about to come.

“You’re not getting any sleep tonight,” William declared.

Wendy sighed as she surrendered herself to the man she loved.

Both of them knew that this was only a dream, but they didn’t care.

They didn’t care that it would take them a few years before they gained the adult bodies that they had right now. What was important was that, tonight, they reaffirmed the love they had for each other, while they waited to come of age.

When that day came, William vowed that he would no longer hold back and make love not only with Wendy, but to all the women who loved him as well.

But, for now, all of his attention was focused on the girl that had made him open his heart. A girl whom he would treasure for the rest of his life. Now and Forever.
