Chapter 1053: Aila√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s Dream [Part 1]

Princess Aila sighed as she cupped a handful of water in her bathtub. Floating over it were dozens of fragrant flowers that she had requested from the maidservant that was assigned to look after her for the duration of her stay in the territory of the Sand Clan.

She had just returned from eating dinner, and yet, she didn't even remember what the food tasted like. Her mind was in chaos as William's words echoed over and over again inside her mind.

"I want to sleep with you tonight."

A red tinge started to creep up her neck, up her angelic face, all the way to the tip of her ears.

William's words were quite vague, and she didn't understand it much. Even so, she decided to prepare herself just in case the Half-Elf wanted to embrace her.

She could still remember how she was supposed to become the sacrificial bride many years ago in order to strengthen the alliance between the Northern Tribes and her Kingdom. However, all of that came to an abrupt end when the handsome red-headed teenager stepped in to foil her father's plan.

Truth be told, Princess Aila had always thought of William as her benefactor. Although it wasn't to the point of falling madly in love with him, she held him in high regard. When her brother, the current Crown Prince of the Zelan Dynasty, told her to do everything in her power to become William's wife, she didn't reject the idea.

Princess Aila knew that, if it was him, she wouldn't mind becoming his wife.

Unfortunately, Aila wasn't a very courageous person. Although she had become a bit more confident in interacting with the people in her class, she wasn't like Shannon who could speak her mind without holding back.

Also, she wasn't very good at seduction. The mere thought of trying to seduce William was enough to make her head spin and her cheeks burn in embarrassment.

What the angelic beauty didn't know was that she didn't need to seduce anyone to have them attack her like wolves. Her beauty, and her innocence, was more than enough to make the boys in her class howl like wolves.

Unfortunately, William wasn't someone who lacked beauties in his life. All of his wives and fiances were beautiful in their own right. Each having their own charm and strong points that made him immune to any kinds of seduction.

Princess Aila understood this, but still, her heart still skipped a beat at the thought of joining their ranks and standing by his side.

"I hope he is gentle with me," Princess Aila said as she looked at the flower petal that had remained in her hands. "This is after all‚Ä¶ my first time."

The angelic beauty soaked her body for two more minutes, before leaving the bathtub to prepare for William's arrival.

Whatever was going to happen on this peaceful night, she would face it with everything she had.

‚Äî---

William gazed at the two moons in the distance, while his two familiars, Conan and Elliot sat on his left and right shoulders.

The three of them talked about many things, and William explained to them his plans going forward.

"Hmm, so you plan to go to the North where the Holy Land is located," Conan rubbed his chin. "This will certainly be dangerous, but no worries. I am here, so all is well. Kekeke!"

"Right," William nodded. "As long as the three of us are together, we can overcome anything!"

"Oh!" Conan raised his right fist in agreement to Wiliam's words.

Elliot on the other hand remained silent. He had his arms crossed over his chest with his eyes closed.

"What's wrong, Elliot?" William asked. "Something on your mind?"

Elliot nodded. "I just want you to know that Chloee loves you as well."

"... Really?"

"Mmm."

William sighed as he shifted his attention to the stars in the sky. Back then, he only had enough love for one woman. But now, things were different.

"What do you want me to do, Elliot?" William inquired. "You already know about my promise to Belle."

"I know." Elliot nodded. "I just told you this so that you don't treat her love to you as a joke."

William closed his eyes. "Did you confess to her?"

"Yes," Elliot replied. "I got the part of your soul that fell in love with her, so what can I do about it?"

Conan chuckled after hearing their exchange. "Kekeke! You got dumped!"

"Right." Elliot sighed. "Still, being able to confess takes a load off my chest. I have no regrets."

William nodded his head. He could understand what Elliot meant about having no regrets. He had regretted many things in his past lives, and had broken several promises. If possible, he didn't want to repeat the same mistake he made back then.

"Well then, It's time for me to go," William said. "I'll leave the rest to the two of you."

"You can count on us!"

"Mmm."

‚Äî---

Ten minutes later‚Ä¶

Aila had just finished wearing her night dress when she heard a knock on her door. Knowing that the time had come, she walked towards the door with her heart beating wildly inside her chest.

"Who is it?" Princess Aila asked.

"It's me, William."

The angelic Princess took a deep breath in order to compose herself before opening the door. Her knees almost turned to jelly when she saw the handsome Half-Elf in front of her. Although she had seen William many times in the past, this night was different and her nervousness was at an all time high.

"P-Please, come in, Sir William," Princess Aila stuttered as she made a gesture to invite the Half-Elf inside her room.

William said his thanks and walked inside. After closing the door, an awkward silence fell between the two of them because the angelic Princess didn't know how to proceed from there.

Whenever the thought of inviting William to her bedroom crossed her mind, her words became stuck up in her throat. Also, she lacked the courage to take the initiative to invite a boy into her bed.

Seeing her pitiful expression, the red-headed teenager lightly coughed as he looked at the blushing girl in front of him.

"Can you take me to your bedroom?" William asked.

"O-Okay," Princess Aila replied as she hastily moved toward her room without looking back.

William could only smile at this cute behavior of hers as he followed behind her. Although he was still half in doubt, he needed to see the Princess' dreams before he could make a decision.

After entering the angelic beauty's room, William knew that he needed to take the initiative, or the two of them would once again return to that awkward state. T/his chapter is updatùìÆd by nùíêv(√™(l)biin.co/m

The Half-Elf told the Princess that he would be casting a sleeping spell on her, so that he could directly enter her dream without too much resistance. Princess Aila agreed and lay on the bed to allow the Half-Elf to put her to sleep.

A minute later, the angelic beauty was already fast asleep, allowing William to relax a little.

He had already changed his Job Class to the Incubus Class and used his powers to enter Princess Aila's dream.

"Time to see if she's telling the truth," William said softly as he pressed his forehead over Princess Aila's.

"Synchronize."
