Chapter 513: The Beginning After The End

More than two years had passed since the battle against the Elves in the Southern Continent.

William thought that they had to wait two full years before the spell wore off, but it only took fifteen months before the continental spell lost its power.

On that day, many tears were shed. Not only in the Hellan Kingdom, but in the three other kingdoms as well.

For those that had turned into a statue, only a second had passed. To those that had survived, it was more than a year of suffering.

Many children had died during that time. Their parents became heartbroken after finding out what happened, and wailed towards the heavens.

If not for the Guardians of the Silvermoon Continent, the tens of thousands of Elves that had survived the war might have lost their lives due to the anger of the citizens of the Zelan Dynasty.

Fortunately, the Minotaur Race had intervened and allowed the Elves to return to their ships and sail back to the Silvermoon Continent. They didn’t intervene because they wanted to protect the Elves, they intervened because Drauum was on the verge of starting a massacre.

The Ancient Golem was still a Pseudo-Demigod, and was more than capable to conduct a genocide.

A month after the spell was lifted, monuments to honor the dead were installed in the Anaesha and Zelan Dynasties. The Kingdom of Freesia had also done the same.

Empress Sidonie had effectively dealt with the Royal Family and nobles of the Anaesha Dynasty by using her Charm. After that, she stepped down from her position as Empress, and delegated the throne to her little brother, Prince Carl, and made him the new Emperor of the Anaesha Dynasty.

Naturally, the transition wasn’t smooth, because there were still people who opposed the new Emperor.

But, who was Empress Sidonie? She was the Companion of the Guardian Beast of the Anaesha Dynasty. Not only that, the Protectors of the Kraetor Empire ensured that there would be no further problems. They secretly disposed of those who dared to instigate a rebellion behind the scenes to reinforce Emperor Carl’s rule.

After losing the ring leaders, the opposition finally submitted and peace once again reigned in the kingdom.

Meanwhile, somewhere in Midgard…

Sounds of kissing could be heard on a small island in the middle of the lake. A beautiful lady with light-blue hair, and a handsome teenager with Silver Hair were currently in the middle of their love making.

Their clothes had long been abandoned at their sides, and a voice tinged with pleasure would escape the lips of the Lady of the Lake every now and then.

“I love you, Ashe,” William said as he held his lover in a tight embrace. “I love you.”

Ashe’s body shuddered because at the same time the silver-haired young man had declared his love for her, the two of them became one.

William’s strong and lithe body pinned her down, but instead of rejecting him, she accepted him fully.

The Half-Elf didn’t rush things, and made sure to satisfy his lover by attacking her weak spots. This wasn’t the first time that they had made love inside a dream, but everytime they did, both of them enjoyed it to the fullest.

William brought her to the peak countless times until Ashe begged him to stop.

“What kind of body do you have? You’re so peerless,” Ashe said as she panted for breath.

William chuckled as he planted a kiss on her cheek. “Don’t worry. I am also peerless in the real world. Would you like to try me?”

The mermaid snorted and rested her head on William’s chest. They were still two months away from William’s birthday, when he would finally come of age. Ashe didn’t want to admit it, but she was looking forward to having a union with William in the real world as well.

“I feel a little guilty.” Ashe gently rubbed the gem embedded on William’s chest. “I feel like I’m cheating.”

“Don’t be,” William replied as he held her tighter. “I’m sure that Wendy and Est will understand.”

William understood why Ashe was feeling guilty. Wendy and Est had stayed behind in the Southern Continent because there were important things that they had to do. Also, their parents felt that going to the Central Continent was still too soon for them.

Because of this, only Ashe accompanied William to the Kraetor Empire. They traveled alongside the Kraetor Warships thanks to the invitation of Princess Sidonie.

The sensuous beauty knew that William needed to go to the Kraetor Empire, so she decided to use this to her advantage and invited him to travel with her to see her Grandfather.

On paper, he was Princess Sidonie’s fiance. The plan that the scheming beauty had made was foolproof, and William couldn’t take the collar off her neck even if he wanted to.

Why? It is because the Princess threatened that if the Half-Elf took her collar off, the Royal Family of the Kraetor Empire would think badly of him. She also added that the possibility of William being banned from entering their territory was guaranteed if that were to happen.

Princess Sidonie’s other half, Morgana, also did her best to close the gap in William’s heart. The Half-Elf had not resisted their advances, because he knew how serious Princess Sidonie and Morgana were.

In the end, even Wendy, Ashe, and Est relented. They accepted Princess Sidonie as one of William’s lovers, which made the latter and her other half, Morgana, very happy.

William also came clean and told Princess Sidonie that he would have nine wives in the future. To his surprise, the Princess only smiled and kissed him passionately.

The scene where the Princess and him had a heart to heart talk flashed inside his mind.

-

“I don’t care how many wives you have,” Princess Sidonie had said as she looked at William’s eyes. “The only thing that matters to me is your love. Do you promise to learn to love me?”

-

He had answered yes back then, and promised that he would learn to love her back.

William had no plan to go back on his promise and spent a lot of time with Princess Sidonie in the Kraetor Empire. The only problem was Morgana.

Sidonie’s lustful half had made a vow that on the day that William had come of age, she would eat him up, even if his other lovers were present. If not for the fact that he was always on guard against her night raids inside his room, Little William might have already been eaten whole.

“Will, these dreams… are they real?” Ashe asked. “Did they really happen?”

William pondered the answer to this question seriously before giving his reply. “I’m not sure. They are too much of a coincidence. I believe that this isn’t just an ordinary dream. Ashe, do you believe in past lives?”

As someone that had kept his memories after entering the Cycle of Reincarnation, William understood that past lives existed. If his recurring dreams with Wendy and Ashe were true then it meant that he had shared a past lifetime with the two of them.

William was not the only one who thought this way. Wendy and Ashe shared the same thought, and both girls were secretly happy about this possibility.

Wendy even joked that they were still destined to become lovers even in their next lifetimes, and WIlliam shouldn’t cheat on them, or else he would face divine retribution.

“We should probably go back soon,” Ashe said softly. “Classes are about to start in a few hours.”

“Okay,” William replied as he naughtily groped Ashe’s chests, who was currently possessing the body of the Lady of the Lake.

Ashe looked at him with a reddened face, but didn’t pry off the naughty hands that were having their way with her body. “You still haven’t had enough?”

“Let’s go for one more round.”

“… Fine.”

-

William and Ashe opened their eyes at the same time.

They were currently inside the Villa that William had built on the Beach Area, that was supposed to be the Boss Room on the Tenth Floor.

They always slept inside the dungeon because in this place, Ashe would be able to return to her true form without any time limit. This allowed the two of them to spend intimate moments together, within the appropriate boundaries.

The two of them showered and dressed together before leaving the Dungeon.

William’s Herd and Legion were still busy clearing the floors of the dungeon. Right now, they were currently at the 50th Floor, and their advance had been slow as of late.

The 50th Floor only allowed six individuals to challenge it at a time, which greatly limited their exploration.

Even so, William wasn’t in a hurry. He knew that challenging Atlantis was no easy feat. He was not delusional enough to think that he could capture the dungeon anytime soon.

What he was waiting for was the person that his father had chosen to contact him as soon as he arrived at the Central Continent. This would allow William to capture any other Dungeon, aside from Atlantis.

Just as the name suggested, the Dungeon Conqueror Prestige Job Class could conquer ANY Dungeon.

William was already looking forward to adding another Legion in his ranks. The Minotaur Race had already returned to their duty as the Guardians of the Zelan Dynasty. The Centaurs had also returned to their tribe.

Only the Revenants, led by Erchitu, and Bastian, remained. Of course, William still had the other monsters that he had tamed like the Malevolent Nightmare Kelpie and Elusive Mist Wildebeest.

The other residents like the Black-Winged Panthers had also given birth to a few individuals, and had already settled inside William’s Thousand Beast Domain.

Due to the vast supply of food and resources from both the Undying Lands, and Atlantis, the creatures that had submitted to William wouldn’t leave even if the Half-Elf asked them to leave. Although they needed to fight for the red-headed teenager during his time of need, they were completely fine with it.

William held Ashe’s hand as he guided her out of the Villa. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“Let’s go,” William said with a smile. “I just hope that the Fifth Master hasn’t destroyed anything in the Alchemist Pavillion. Last time, the Treasurer almost cried a river of blood because the damages reached half a million gold coins.”

Ashe giggled and nodded her head.

Both of them were enrolled in the Silverlight Academy of the Kraetor Empire. This was one of Emperor Leonidas’ conditions for allowing William to stay inside the Kraetor Empire.

The Emperor didn’t say anything about Wililam’s engagement to his granddaughter, which made the Half-Elf wonder if Leonidas favored him or not.

However, the red-headed teenager wasn’t too worried.

‘What will come will come,’ William thought as he opened the portal that would take him and Ashe back to the real world. Although there would be obstacles that might block his way, he was confident that he would be able to break all the walls that stood before him.

After all, he was never alone.
