Chapter 552: Are You Planning To Commit Suicide?

Chiffon hugged the gauntlets that William had given her while she slept.

The little girl really liked her new gauntlets, and was even touched when she learned that the one that forged them was her Big Brother.

If not for the fact that the Academy had forbidden its students from carrying their weapons on their bodies, Chiffon would have worn her gauntlets during class as well.

Ian and Princess Sidonie exchanged a glance as they looked at the pink-haired girl that was sleeping on William’s bed.

“Ever since William left, she stopped going to class and spent her free time sleeping on his bed.” Ian sighed. “She’s like a little puppy that is waiting for her Master’s return.”

Princess Sidonie pressed her palm on her forehead as she looked at the little girl who had been entrusted to her by William.

“Aamon’s Temple is located at the North of the Empire,” Princess Sidonie said. “The Temple itself is located in a valley that had been closed off from the public. According to my estimate, it will take two days to get there even if he used teleportation gates.”

“Then, he should have arrived there at this time.”

“Yes. We will probably see him after two days.”

Ian shook her head as she looked at the corner of the room, where a spear was leaning on the wall.

“No. he will be arriving shortly,” Ian said with confidence.

Princess Sidonie was about to ask what Ian meant when suddenly, a brief flash of light illuminated the room.

“I’m back, did the two of you miss me?” William asked as he pulled Princess Sidonie into his embrace and gave her a kiss on the cheek.

Ian transformed into her true form, and allowed William to give her a kiss as well. After kissing his two lovers, William noticed the pink-haired girl who was sleeping on his bed and smiled.

“It seems that she really liked the weapon I made for her,” William commented. “She’s even using it as a hug pillow.”

William was about to poke the little girl’s cheeks when Princess Sidonie grabbed hold of his hand and pulled him away.

“How were you able to return that fast from the Temple?” Princess Sidonie asked. “Also, what did his Excellency, Aamon say?”

William grinned and told Princess Sidonie the trick on how he could travel from one point to the other instantly. The beautiful girl listened attentively to William’s explanation. She then realized that it was the same trick that her lover used, to escape from Eneru and the Elves, when he escaped from the Capital City of the Anaesha Dynasty.

“That’s amazing,” Princess Sidonie commented after William finished his explanation.

Ashe, who was listening from the side, held William’s hand and asked the question that had been on her mind ever since the Half-Elf returned.

“Did you manage to talk with his Excellency, Aamon?” Ashe inquired.

William nodded as he summoned the scroll that the God had given him.

Ashe and Princess Sidonie (Morgana) looked at the scroll and read its contents.

“Conquer the 51st Floor of the Tower of Babylon?” Princess Sidonie frowned. She was not a native of the Central Continent and was not aware of its landmarks.

Ashe was on the same boat, and the two looked at William for answers.

“Sorry, I also don’t know.” William shrugged. “I returned as soon as I could, so I could talk to the Headmaster about it. Look after Chiffon for me. I’ll be right back.”

William bid his goodbye to his two lovers before leaving his room in haste. Although it didn’t show on his face, William was actually quite anxious about the mission that had been assigned to him.

Gilbert sighed for the umpteenth time as he read the Ancient Scroll in his hands.

“Vault Of The Vanished Warlord,” Gilbert muttered. “Why must you be there of all places?”

The Headmaster of the Academy was not afraid to go to dangerous places in order to search for the thing that he was looking for. However, the 51st Floor of the Tower of Babylon was an exception.

The most powerful families in the continent had formed joint exploration groups in order to conquer the mysterious floor of the Tower. However, all of them had failed.

For as long as he could remember, no one had been able to bring back any news of what kind of secrets the 51st Floor held. There had been rumors flying around, but none of them were credible. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

While Gilbert was feeling depressed, he heard a knock on the door of his office.

“Who is it?” Gilbert asked.

“Headmaster, it is me, Dio- I mean, William,” William replied through the door. “There is something important that I need to discuss with the Headmaster. Can I come in?”

Gilbert rubbed his forehead because a troublesome character had come. He was still dealing with the aftermath of William’s confrontation with the mercenary group from the Demon Continent and it was giving him a headache.

“Come in,” Gilbert said as he fixed his posture. He was still the Headmaster of Silverwind Academy and he needed to look presentable in front of his students.

William walked in the door and sat after the Headmaster had given him permission to do so.

“I thought you were supposed to go to Aamon’s Temple?” Gilbert asked. “Didn’t his Majesty give you permission to go?”

William nodded. “I just returned from the temple because there is something important that I need to discuss with the Headmaster.”

“Something important?” Gilbert eyed the red-headed teenager with a curious gaze. “Go on. What is it that you want to ask me?”

William then narrated a made-up story about receiving a vision in Aamon’s Temple about going to the 51st Floor of the Tower of Babel.

Gilbert, who had just drank a mouthful of tea, spat it on William’s face after hearing his story.

“Y-You can’t be serious!” Gilbert pointed at the Half-Elf that had been drenched by his tea. “Are you planning to commit suicide? Boy, if this is a joke, it is not a funny one.”

William wiped his face with a handkerchief as he looked at the stuttering Headmaster that seemed to have lost his composure. He was very tempted to get back at the old man, but since he needed some information, he decided to just pay him back another day!

“Headmaster, like I said, it is the vision that I saw on Aamon’s Temple,” William explained after cleaning, and drying himself with magic. “The Headmaster is the most knowledgeable person that I know of in the Academy. This is why I came to you for answers.”

Gilbert organized his thoughts as he looked at William with a serious expression.

“Are you planning to go there?” Gilbert asked. “What did the vision tell you?”

William had already anticipated that the Headmaster would ask him these kinds of questions, so he had prepared a backstory beforehand.

“The vision told me that I needed to go there,” William replied. “I don’t know what I will find on the 51st floor, but it is important that I go there. It is a revelation given to me by his Excellency, Aamon.”

William thought that if he just used Aamon’s name, everything would become more believable. Although Gilbert still had his doubts, he told the red-headed teenager everything he knew about the temple.

The Headmaster of the Academy even gave William the translated scroll of the Vault Of The Vanished Warlord, which was said to be hidden somewhere on the 51st floor.

After hearing Gilbert’s explanation, the Half-Elf’s anxiousness eased up a bit. Instead of feeling afraid, the Half-Elf became very curious about what was hidden on the mysterious floor of the Tower.

When the Headmaster mentioned about the Vault of the Vanished Warlord, William’s hand became very itchy. He was already looking forward to the treasures that he would soon loot from the 51st Floor of the Tower of Babylon.
