Chapter 37: The Dungeon Raid [Part 1]

“Mama Ella, are you ready?”

“Meeeeeh!”

William nodded his head and went to Ella’s status page. After defeating the Millennial Beast, Ella had also reached the max level of an Angorian Goat. In order to advance, she needed to evolve.

However, the System made an interesting discovery. After Ella evolved, she could still return to her previous form which was the Angorian Goat. William was very happy with this outcome because he had grown fond of his Mama Ella’s current form.

He had seen Ella’s evolutionary form and it was quite intimidating.

-

[ Would you like to evolve Ella to become the Angorian War Ibex? ]

[ Yes / No ]

-

William chose Yes and immediately, Ella transformed into a two-meter tall Angorian War Ibex. The two huge back-curving horns on her head were five-feet long (1.524 meters), and gave her an intimidating bearing.

Although her white coat still looked comfortable and fluffy, it was in fact, as sturdy as the lightweight-metal armor armor that adventurers and mercenaries usually wore.

Overall, Ella’s evolution gave her outstanding strength and physical defense. Just like the name of her race suggested, she was a beast that was born for war.

The goats, who were inside the goat shed, looked at her with sparkling eyes. With a glance, William could tell that they were all looking forward to evolving just like Ella.

“Meeeeeeh!” Ella raised her head proudly. It was her way to encourage the goats to do their best to become stronger. She had the “If I can do it, you can do it too!” expression on her face which made the goats stomp their feet in excitement.

“Meeeeeh!” ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“Meeeeeh!”

“Meeeeeh!”

The goats replied happily as if to tell her that they would evolve as well. William approached Ella with a big smile on his face. This was what Ella wanted. She wanted to become stronger in order to protect William, and her goal had been met.

However, both William and Ella knew that this wasn’t the end. It was just the beginning and the journey to the peak was still a long way to go.

William checked Ella’s stats and the smile on his face widened. Ella’s evolution had given her a massive boost in her status points. Her previous form and her current form were like Heaven and Earth.

“Mama Ella, congratulations!” William hugged her neck.

“Meeeh.” Ella replied. She then rested her chin on William’s shoulder and closed her eyes.

They stayed like that for a few minutes before William reluctantly took a step back. Although the night was still young, there were still things that they needed to do.

“If there is any among you that wish to leave a peaceful life then you can go to that side,” William said and pointed to his right. “I will not force any of you to endanger yourselves. I’ll be completely honest. I cannot guarantee your safety.

I don’t know what kind of foes we are going to face in the future. All I know is that they will be stronger than the Dire Wolves that you had faced yesterday. The chances of you guys dying is high. Do you still want to follow me to the unknown?”

“”Meeeeh!””

The goats replied in unison. Perhaps due to what they experienced, the goats’ desire to grow stronger had superseded their desire to live a peaceful life.

“Very well.” William nodded. “Let’s all go and conquer the Goblin Crypt together!”

“Meeeeeeh!”

William activated the Ring of Conquest and a blinding light enveloped everyone inside the goat shed. A few seconds later, they found themselves on the Tenth Floor of the Goblin Crypt.

-

“Is this what you wanted to show me, Father?” Mordred asked.

“Yes,” James replied. “William is still young and there are things that he cannot do. What you and I can do for him is to give him our full support from the shadows.”

Mordred glanced at the goat shed with a calm expression. “Understood, Father.”

“Good.” James nodded his head and walked back towards the house. ‘William is following the footsteps of his father. I just hope that he will be able to overcome the challenges that are waiting for him.’

The father and son pair disappeared under the cover of darkness. The Beast Tides were still active in the Western Part of the Hellan Kingdom. Both of them still had things to do and, among them was to ensure that William’s secret would be kept for as long as possible.

-

Eleventh Floor Goblin Crypt…

“Meeeeeh!”

“Meeeeh!”

The Angorian Goats charged at the two Hobgoblins as a team. Although the Hobgoblins were stronger than the Dire Wolves, they were no match against thirteen crazed goats who were out for blood.

Ella was the Leader of the Herd, but she just stood at the back and watched as her subordinates trampled the Hobgoblins with ease.

The goats were divided into two teams. One of the teams was led by Aslan, while the other was led by Chronos.

—

[ Team: Alpha ]

Leader: Aslan

Members: Baldur, Dawn, Echo, Flynn, Griffin, Hades,

[ Team: Omega ]

Leader: Chronos

Members: Io, Jed, Keith, Levi, Myr

-

One team against one Hobgoblin. This was the strategy that William had devised after entering the Eleventh Floor. He reasoned that the goats needed to work as a team if they wanted to advance to the lower floors of the Goblin Crypt.

The Hobgoblins on the Eleventh floor came in pairs. It was the perfect training ground for the goats to test their teamwork.

[ Exp Gained 220 ]

[ Exp Gained 220 ]

William checked the notification and nodded his head. He had already anticipated that the experience points would be greatly reduced due to the number of participants in the battle. However, he didn’t care.

He was not in a hurry to gain massive experience points. The important thing right now was to train his “army” and polish their battle formations.

-

Name: Ella

Race: Angorian War Ibex

[ Level 2 ]

Hit Points: 2000 / 2000

Mana: 800 / 800

[ Current Exp: 40 / 922 ]

-

William smiled as he saw his Mama Ella gain a level. He then added the three stat points to Agility. His mentality still hasn’t changed. The boy still prioritized Ella’s speed because he believed that being fast was just as important as being strong.

‘Now, let’s check the new skills!’ William opened Ella’s skill tree with excitement.

When Ella gained a level, she received three stat points and two skill points. William was very picky when it came to Ella’s skills. He preferred to choose practicality over being too flashy.

The first skill he chose was Mithril Armament. This was the stronger version of the Steel Armament that Ella had when she was still an ordinary Angorian Goat.

[ Mithril Armament ]

(10 Mana Points)

— Make the creature’s horn and hooves as hard as Mithril.

— This skill cannot be upgraded

— Skill Duration: 30 minutes

“Mama, please, test this skill,” William pleaded.

“Meeeeh.”

The color of Ella’s horn and hooves changed into a silver-blue color. They were like crystals shining in the darkness. It also gave Ella a regal and elegant appeal. William playfully touched his Mama Ella’s mithril horns. It gave him the feeling of confidence and security.

He knew that it would only take a matter of time to clear the Goblin Crypt with his Mama Ella’s newfound strength.
