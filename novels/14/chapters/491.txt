Chapter 491: Accompany Me To The Afterlife [Part 1]

“Die!” Eneru roared as it made a beeline towards William.

Even though he was injured, his goal of killing the boy still burned inside his heart. However, things were different now… and the arrogant Qilin only realized his mistake after his body met William’s gigantic staff head-on.

“Sweep away all adversaries!” William shouted as he raised his staff to swat the Qilin who was charging towards him. “Ruyi Jingu Bang!”

The Legendary Staff that first fought-off the Celestial Army thousands of years ago resonated with William’s determination and enlarged itself. This was a weapon that could injure Gods.

Fighting a Qilin that was only at the Peak of the Millennial Rank was nothing!

Eneru’s pained scream reached everyone’s ears as the giant staff struck his body like a baseball bat, sending him hurtling several hundred meters away.

William was about to sweep the Elven Army like a pile of dried up leaves when Ezkalor appeared before him and blocked his attack.

The Elder Dragon had taken his humanoid form and appeared in front of William, kicking him off Ella’s back.

Ezkalor may not be as fast as Eneru, or as strong as Drauum, but he had an uncanny ability. He was blessed with Space Magic, which is also called Spatial Manipulation Magic.

Among his skills was the Blink Ability.

The Blink Ability allowed him to appear anywhere within a five-thousand meter radius around him.

He was also an Ancient Dragon. A race that stood at the peak of the world of Hestia, and was born with one of the strongest bodies in existence. His offensive and defensive capabilities were superb, and this made him the most versatile Guardian of the Silvermoon Continent.

William spun in the air as his feet landed on a white cloud.

Ezkalor appeared once again in front of him and delivered a powerful punch that sent him flying towards the sky.

‘As expected, fighting against a Myriad Beast at its peak is a pain,’ William thought as he once again summoned the cloud to regain his balance.

Due to the Monkey King’s powerful body, he received very minimal injuries from Ezkalor’s attack. In fact, those injuries had already healed due to Sun Wukong’s powerful regeneration abilities.

“Come, Child.” Ezkalor made a taunting gesture as he stood in front of him. Clearly, he was preventing William from going back to the battlefield. “Why don’t you play with me for a while?”

“Are you sure you want to keep me company?” William inquired. “Jekyll is down there you know. He will just swallow your entire Army if you don’t go down there to stop him.”

“Your threat is bigger than that of a Taotie right now,” Ezkalor answered. “If I were to choose between the two of you, I’d always pick you.”

“Should I be honored then?”

“You should be.”

William glanced at the chaotic battlefield on the ground. Right now, the Beast Charge had stopped and it was now a complete mess in the battlefield.

He was supposed to be the Commander of the Beast Army, but now that he was out of the picture, he would find it hard to command his King’s Legion while fighting against Ezkalor at the same time.

Fortunately, he had already taken this matter into account and appointed someone else to take his place.

A Golden Winged Serpent, that was seven-meters long, rose up in the air. Mounted on her back was Est, who took charge of commanding William’s army.

Thor streaked past across the Elven Army as Wendy used her Runemaster Job Class to fight alongside Isaac, who was currently mounted on Ragnar that had taken the form of a Grand Cerberus.

Blade Xolotl, Grand Cerberus, and Golden Winged Quetzalcoatl.

These were the three Centennial Forms of Thor, Ragnar, and Dia under the power of Kinship Evolution.

For some reason, even though Est was still not part of William’s Familia, Dia’s bond with her had unlocked the Kinship Evolution ability. Because of this, the Golden Serpent had transformed into the Golden-Winged Serpent that now slithered across the battlefield as Est gave orders left and right.

“Are they your lovers?”

William’s attention snapped back to the Ancient Dragon in front of him after hearing the latter’s question. He then narrowed his eyes as he gripped his weapon in his hand with the intention to go all out if the Myriad Beast dared to touch any of his lovers.

“Don’t worry, as long as you stay here, I promise that I won’t attack any of them. However, if you leave…”

“Is that a threat?” William asked.

“I, Ezkalor, don’t make threats.” Ezkalor smiled as he raised his chin, “I’m merely stating a fact.”

The golden staff in William’s hands gave a metallic sound and William took a fighting stance. “Very well, since you want to play, I will play with you. Don’t regret it later.”

Ezkalor smirked as he summoned a red blade that glowed faintly. “Come, Child. I will show you that there is always a Heaven beyond the Heavens.”

A series of powerful explosions raged in the heavens as William and Ezkalor clashed. The Ancient Dragon was holding a weapon that was on par with Ruyi Jingu Bang, and that was none other than the Dragon God Sword.

“Exceed Break, activate!” William’s extra sensory perceptions became heightened as he fought against Ezkalor.

He had no choice but to go all out because his enemy was a whole rank stronger than him. Aside from his Blink Ability, Ezkalor was able to solidify the space around him. He had tried to trap William in a spatial cube, but the latter had used brute strength to break through his invisible prison.

“Hah!” William managed to arrive at the blindspot of the annoying blinking Dragon and executed a killer strike.

However, to his disappointment, the latter just blinked away, effectively evading his attack.

——

The two criss-crossed across the sky as they fought against each other. William was at a disadvantage because of Ezkalor’s rank, but thanks to Sun Wukong’s strong abilities and weapon, he was able to fend off most of the Ancient Dragon’s attacks.

Meanwhile on the ground…

“Stupid Anteater! Don’t go too deep into the enemy lines!” Psoglav shouted as he parried and pierced the eye of a Forest Wolf that had tried to sneak attack it from the back. “Oi! Come back here you dumb Kasogonaga!”

The battlefield was in chaos, and although Psoglav shouted with all of its might, its voice was drowned out by the shouts, roars, yells, and pained screams that spread across the battlefield.

Kasogonaga wasn’t able to hear the Demonic Dog’s warning. However, even if it did, it wouldn’t stop. It was too blinded by rage and the only thing in its mind was to kill as many Elves as it could.

“This is the payback you owe me for thousands of years!” Kasogonaga screamed as it shredded everything that blocked its path. After regaining a bit of its powers, it was able to add sharp spikes to its Wrecking Ball form.

Still, the Elves weren’t pushovers either. After the rainbow-colored Anteater had gone deep within their ranks, they bombarded it from all sides with magical attacks, and those that had strong physical abilities confronted it head-on.

If the Sky Deity had been at its peak, only the Demigods could stop his rampage. Unfortunately, it had regressed and the Elves were able to finally stop the Anteater from its advance.

Kasogonaga then experienced a magical bombardment from all sides which made it grit its teeth in frustration. Thanks to its rainbow-colored platings, the damage it received was mitigated to a certain extent.

However, after being bombarded by hundreds of magical spells at the same time, the Anteater was starting to suffer from internal injuries, despite its solid outer shell.

When the Anteater was about to reach its limit, a powerful warcry stopped the elves from their magical bombardment.

Sharx, the Goblin Marauder along with its Mount, Sparky, broke through the enemy lines along with its Goblin Cavaliers.

Erchitu was at the front of this charge, with Psoglav riding on its shoulders.

Psoglav saw how the Anteater was being suppressed with its Demonic Eye and hurriedly went to find Erchitu to ask for help.

Upon hearing that their friend was in danger, Erchitu called out Sharx and asked for its powerful Goblin Cavaliers to help it break through the Elven Formation. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“Don’t fall back!” one of the Elven Captains ordered. “Engage them!”

The Wolf Riders and the Goblin Cavaliers clashed, sending blood flying in every direction like rain.

Erchitu bashed, and kicked the Wolf Riders that blocked its path, while Psoglav and its Doppelganger worked hand in hand to cover the Giant Ox’s blind spots.

“Kasogonaga!” Erchitu yelled as he arrived beside the curled up Anteater. “Are you alright?”

“E-Erchi…tu,” Kasogonaga replied weakly. It had suffered serious injuries and was barely able to maintain its curled up form. The moment its friends arrived, the Anteater finally undid its transformation and collapsed on the ground.

Psoglav jumped down from Erchitu’s shoulder as he picked up his unconscious friend.

“Let’s go back!” Erchitu unceremoniously grabbed Psoglav and placed it on its shoulder as it unleashed a deafening roar that sent a shockwave around them.

“Sharx!” Psoglav shouted. “Let’s get out of here!”

The Goblin Marauder gave out a guttural cry and rallied its riders for a hasty retreat.

“Don’t let them escape!” the Elven Captain ordered as the Wolf Riders closed in on the retreating Beasts.

Erchitu knew that they would be annihilated if he didn’t delay the Elves’ advance. Sharx had lost a quarter of its riders during this rescue mission, and more riders were dying in order to clear up their path to retreat.

“Psoglav, I’ll leave everything to you,” Erchitu said.

Before the Demonic Dog could even say anything, the Giant White Ox had grabbed it and threw it with all of its might, back to the side of the Alliance.
