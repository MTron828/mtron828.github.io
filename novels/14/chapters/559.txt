Chapter 559: Are You Ready For Your Last Lesson? [Part 1]

“You are just like me. You also carry a Sin.”

Celine didn’t deny or confirm Chiffon’s statement. She just stared at the little girl with pity, as if she was looking at her past self.

William tilted his head as he looked at Chiffon and his Master. He clearly heard the pink-haired girl say that his Master, Celine, was someone like her.

Someone who also carried a sin.

“What is your relationship with my Disciple?” Celine asked in order to change the topic.

Chiffon glanced at William before looking back at Celine, “Big Brother is my caretaker. He also provides me with food to eat.”

“Caretaker? Well, I guess he is good at taking care of kids.”

“Big Brother has been very nice to me. He always lets me eat his long and hard…”

“M-Master, what are you doing here?” William interjected before Chiffon could finish her statement. Last time, Princess Sidonie suddenly bit him while the two of them were having an intimate moment together.

When William asked why she did that, the beautiful Princess said that it was punishment for letting Chiffon do things that she shouldn’t have done. Naturally, the Half-Elf was confused about what his lover was talking about.

After coaxing and asking the Princess the reason for her bad mood, he found out that all of this came from a misunderstanding.

A misunderstanding due to Chiffon’s poor choice of words.

William didn’t want his Master to misunderstand, so he decided to intervene before the pink-haired girl said things that might cause others to think badly of him.

Celine gave William the “let’s talk about this later” look before answering his question.

“Like I said earlier, I came here because I got wind that you were headed here for the Tower,” Celine answered. “Don’t ask who told me that you’d be here. It will just complicate things if you know who it is.”

William scratched his head. Clearly, his Master had no intention of divulging her secret, so it was best to leave the matter alone.

“But, that is not the only reason why I am here,” Celine stated. “I came here to keep my promise and impart to you the last lesson you need to learn about Dart Magic. After that, I will go and see my sister, before going to the Demon Continent.” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Chiffon’s expression changed after she heard the words Demon Continent. Her body unconsciously shuddered because that was the place of her origin. A place that she didn’t want to go back to ever again.

William digested Celine’s words. The tone his Master used was firm and carried no hint of hesitation. It was then when he also realized that there was a possibility that he wouldn’t be able to see Celine again for a very long time.

Part of him wanted to tell her not to go to a very dangerous place, but he also knew that his Master wouldn’t back down just because he asked her not to go. Celine was already an adult. She could make her own decisions and knew full well the consequences of her actions.

“Master, we will see each other again, right?” William asked softly.

Although there had been many twists and turns to their relationship as Master and Disciple, Celine was one of the important people in his life. He had learned a lot of things from her, and for that, he was forever grateful.

“Silly boy, of course we will see each other again,” Celine answered. “I’m an Elf. I have a very long life ahead of me. It might take a few years before we see each other again, but we will definitely meet.”

“Can you promise me that, Master?”

“Mmm. I promise. Now, tell me all the things that you have done ever since you left the Southern Continent. Don’t omit anything, especially in regards to how you met Chiffon.”

William nodded his head and told his Master the things that he had experienced in Silverwind Academy. How Emperor Leonidas snubbed him at first, and forced to enroll at the Academy. His meeting with Chiffon, and also about the Quarterly Assessment Test, and how he beat the old record.

Celine shook her head helplessly and lit a candle for the future students of Silverwind Academy. The beautiful Elf believed that none of them would be able to beat William’s record for many years to come.

After finishing his tale, Celine then informed him about what happened in the Southern Continent while he was away.

Due to the increasing pressure from the citizens, and the neighboring Dynasties and Kingdom, King Noah had been forced to send the First Prince, Lionel, to the guillotine and had him executed.

Although he was angered by his son’s betrayal, he only decided to imprison him for life. But, that didn’t sit well with the citizens who had lost their children during the war. In order to prevent a Civil War, King Noah compromised and steeled himself, sacrificing his firstborn to quell the masses.

His second son, Prince Rufus, was exiled from the Hellan Kingdom. According to Celine, the exiled prince decided to come to the Central Continent and enter the Misty Sect.

After losing his two sons, the King proclaimed Prince Ernest as the new Crown Prince of the Hellan Kingdom. Not only that, he also announced the name of his future Queen, which was none other than Princess Brianna of the Northern Tribe.

A smile appeared on William’s face when he heard that the two children had become officially engaged. He treated Brianna as a little sister, and he only had her happiness in mind. William knew that Prince Ernest really cared about her, so he wasn’t worried that his little sister would get bullied.

Even if she got bullied, so what? William would just return to the Hellan Kingdom and give the new Crown Prince a good spanking, in order to avenge his little sister!

Celine left out the troublesome part about the rebuilding of the Hellan Kingdom, and other matters regarding the peace treaty that had been signed by the four ruling factions in the Southern Continent.

She knew that none of these were important to William, so she didn’t want to waste her time explaining about these things as well.

“Well then, are you ready for your last lesson, Will?” Celine asked. “This time, I will not hold back. I want to see if you’ve been slacking off in your training after you left the Hellan Kingdom.”

William patted his chest with confidence and gave Celine a confident smile.

“I am ready, Master. This time, the one who will lose is you.”

“Quite confident are we? Very well. Let’s see if you can back it up.”

William held Chiffon’s hand and reached out towards Celine. The beautiful Elf held his hand firmly. Oliver entered Celine’s shadow so that he wouldn’t be left behind.

A few seconds later, the scenery around them changed.

William had taken everyone inside his Thousand Beast Domain where he and Celine would have their final match against each other.

In the past, William always lost against the beautiful Elf whenever they spared inside his Sea of Consciousness. But now, things were different.

William was no longer the powerless child that Celine had tormented during their training.

The red-headed teenager was even looking forward to having a match with her. What he didn’t know was that Celine’s final lesson wasn’t an ordinary lesson.

It was a lesson that he would remember for the rest of his life.
