Chapter 206: Slowly Staining Their Hearts In Darkness

“I’ll be going to the capital first,” Mordred patted William’s shoulder. “Are you sure you don’t want to come with me?”

William shook his head, “I still have to train them, Uncle. They’re still not up to my standards.”

Mordred looked at the thirty-six Hipogriffs in the sky. They were currently practicing an aerial formation along with the Wyvern and Gryphon.

They still had ten more days before the Knighting Ceremony, but Mordred had to go to the capital early because James asked him to run some errands. He would also be there to witness the King officially award William his commander post because all the nobles were required to attend the ceremony.

This was the King’s way of letting everyone know about the birth of the new Knight Order and give them the chance to see William. This way, they would recognize him when he visited their domains during official missions. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“Don’t worry, Uncle,” William replied. “We will be there for the ceremony. Tell Big Brother Matthew and Big Sister Leah that I’m fine and they shouldn’t worry about me.”

“Alright.” Mordred nodded. “I’ll see you at the capital.”

“Have a safe journey, Uncle.”

“You, too.”

Inside the Hellan Royal Academy…

“A new Knight Order?” Carter raised an eyebrow. “And the leader is a First Year from the Martial Division Class?”

“Yes, Professor,” a pretty young lady with brown hair replied with a smile. “Ten days from now, a knighting ceremony will be held here in the academy. The King will be present as well.”

“According to the rumors, the leader of the Knight Order is the current Head Prefect of the First Year Martial Class,” the pretty young lady’s best friend commented. “His name is William Von Ainsworth and he’s a Half-Elf.”

“Interesting.” Carter smiled at the two young ladies who were currently inside his bedroom.

After the Dungeon Outbreaks had been cleared, he finally had time to refine some “candies” for the Third Year students of the Magic Division.

The two girls inside his room had been eating his candies for more than a month now. As magicians, they had a natural resistance to certain spells, so Carter was sure that their current “dosage” was not enough for him to fully control their thoughts.

However, these two girls had a huge crush on him the moment they saw him in the academy. They had been making advances towards the very popular and capable instructor who had a big future ahead of him.

The brown-haired girl was the only daughter of a Marquess and her best friend was the daughter of the head of the merchant group in their domain. The two of them had been close since childhood and enrolled at the Academy at the same time.

The brown-haired girl’s name was Charlotte, and her best friend’s name was Annie. Together, they decided to “seduce” Carter and make him their husband.

With the help of the suggestion spell that had taken hold of their hearts, their feelings for Carter only grew with each passing day.

“Professor, have you thought about our proposal?” Charlotte asked. “I’m sure that with my family’s backing, you will be able to obtain a noble title from the king.”

Carter had thought about the girl’s proposal for quite some time and there were no demerits in it whatsoever.

‘Being married to the only daughter of a Marquess is not bad,’ Carter thought. ‘I will be able to use her family’s influence to collect more followers for my Lord’s cause. Also… this girl and her friend have great bodies. I can’t wait to have a taste.’

“I don’t mind marrying you, but I intend to have many wives,” Carter replied. “Are you fine with that?”

“How many wives do you plan to have, Professor?” Charlotte inquired.

It was very common for noblemen to have many wives. Charlotte and her friend understood this and had already prepared themselves for it. The only condition was that they would be Carter’s First and Second wives.

Carter thought and opened his hand. “Not more than five.”

Charlotte and Annie exchanged a glance before nodding their heads.

“I agree with your condition, Professor,” Charlotte said with a longing expression. “If you like, we can even help you convince the girls you chose to be your other wives. All I ask is that you give us special treatment.”

Carter caressed the side of Charlotte’s pretty face and marveled at its smoothness. “What kind of special treatment do you want from me?”

Emboldened by Carter’s question, Charlotte decided to take a chance and moved closer. She then gave a light peck on Carter’s lips before her whole face became beet red from embarrassment.

‘Such an innocent girl,’ Carter laughed internally. ‘I will take my time to corrupt her innocence and make her my loyal slave.’

Carter placed his hand at the back of her neck and pulled her close to him. The two exchanged light kisses that slowly transformed into passionate ones.

The handsome professor also pulled Annie close to him and kissed her as well. He didn’t intend to ravage both girls right away, because he wasn’t in a hurry.

What he drew the most pleasure from was to take his time to corrupt innocent girls until they became whores who would wantonly shake their hips to satisfy his carnal desires.

The sound of kissing echoed within the room as Carter started to train his two future wives.

The two girls looked at him lovingly and kissed both sides of his face simultaneously.

Little did they know that the demon lurking inside their beloved’s body was slowly staining their hearts with darkness.

‘This candy is quite good,’ Wendy thought as she ate the candy that was given to her by her senior, Charlotte. ‘Big Sister Charlotte was quite generous to give me a dozen. I wonder where she got these?’

Since Wendy was an officer of the Magic Division for the First Years, it was only natural for her to interact with the other officers of the Magic Division, who were in different grades.

She had known Charlotte for five years and had met many times at parties held for the nobility. They even shared two hunting expeditions together that were sponsored by her father in their own Duchy.

As she was eating the candy, she felt a fleeting sensation pass through her body. Wendy didn’t give it much thought because she only felt it for a brief moment. Her body had quickly returned to normal, so she figured that she might have just imagined the feeling.

“Thor, do you like candies?” Wendy asked the puppy in her lap.

Thor shook his head before lying down with the intention of going to sleep.

“Suit yourself.” Wendy grinned as she ate another candy. “I wonder when William will return to the academy. I hope he’s doing well.”

Thor yawned and smacked its lips. He was confident that his “Master” was perfectly fine and healthy. Afterall, the two of them shared a powerful bond. If something bad happened to William, he would be able to sense it right away.

Wendy ate the candies until none were left. For some reason, she had the strong urge to ask Charlotte where she got the candies so she could buy more.

‘I’ll ask her tomorrow,’ Wendy thought as she picked up the puppy and carried him to the bed.

The beautiful young lady was not aware that a certain suggestion spell had already started to take root inside her heart. Wendy was one of the candidates that Charlotte had picked to become another of Carter’s brides.

Carter had told her that he wanted to marry girls that were born to noble families. The higher their rank, the better.

Blinded by her infatuation and the power of the suggestion spell, Charlotte started to distribute Carter’s “candies” to the noble ladies that she got along with. The only thought in her mind was that if she was to share her future husband with other girls, she would rather share him with people that she got along with.

“Good job,” William said as he watched the performance of his Aerial Knights. “All of you take a fifteen-minute break. We will resume the training afterward.”

Eight days remained before the Knighting Ceremony in the Hellan Royal Academy. All the members of the Angorian War Sovereign had become more proficient in controlling their mounts.

Of course, the main reason why they performed well was because the Hippogriffs were not resisting their orders. There were even times when the magical beasts “improvised” by themselves in order to keep the formation steady.

“Commander, I have never seen these formations before,” Conrad said as he stood beside William. “Even the Gryphon Brigade of our Kingdom has never done anything remotely similar to what we’ve been doing.”

William had a smug smile on his face as he listened to Conrad’s words. He wanted to brag, but he didn’t know how to properly word it. After all, how could he possibly tell his Dragon Knight that the knowledge he was sharing with them came from another world.

In the end, he decided to play it safe and just patted Conrad’s shoulder. “Actually, I saw these formations in my dream. I thought that they looked cool and wanted to implement them in reality.”

William was about to say more when his good friend, Theo, came to find him.

“William, Mr. Barbatos is looking for you,” Theo said as he panted for breath. “He said that the thing you asked for has been completed. He told me to come and find you so that you can check to see if it still needs some adjustments.”

“Thank you,” William patted his friend’s shoulder. “I’ll give you two slices of apple pie later.”

“Do you think I’m still a kid that you can bribe with apple pies?”

“You don’t want it?”

“I want three slices.”

William chuckled as he shook his head helplessly. He always liked to talk to Theo. Talking to the chubby boy, who was a year older than him, reminded William of his younger years. Years when he was still innocent and unaware of the darkness that had long been hiding inside people’s hearts.
