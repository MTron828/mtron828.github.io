1268 l Will Be The One To Kill This Bastard

Deep in the prisons of the Demon Capital of Astryae...

The sound of footsteps emanated down the hallway, echoing off the damp and mossy walls.

When Felix became the Heir of Darkness, all the captive prisoners were forcefully corrupted and used as cannon fodder for the Demon Army.

Right now, there was only one person inside the spacious place that once held the most notorious criminals in the Demon Realm. He had been shackled in the deepest part of the prison, preventing him from seeing the light of the sun again.

The prison door creaked as it opened slowly, revealing the silhouette of the Half-Elf who had personally made his journey to the Demon Capital to see the man, who had made his wife, Chiffon, suffer so many hardships when she was young.

The Demon Lord who once reigned over the Demon Realm raised his head, and looked at the person in front of him. Suddenly, a laugh escaped his lips after seeing the black-haired teenager whose eyes glowed golden in the darkness.

“So, Felix lost, huh?” Luciel inquired.

“Yes,” William replied as he looked at Luciel with a gaze that made the latter chuckle.

“And Ahriman?”

“Escaped to the void.”

“Hoh~ Not bad.”

Luciel’s voice held ridicule and contempt toward the Primordial God of Darkness and Chaos, who had lost to the young man in front of him.

“So, what are you planning to do with me?”

“I came here to torture you, but seeing that you’re already this broken, I might as well...”

William didn’t finish his words. Instead, he slowly pressed his hand over Luciel’s chest, while the latter sneered at him.

The former Demon Lord thought that William would torture him to vent out his frustration, but he was wrong.

William didn’t just plan on torturing him. What he wanted was to make Luciel feel the pain that Chiffon had felt when she was still in the Demon Realm, and had to fend for herself against her own family.

The black-haired teenager’s hand slowly sank on Luciel’s chest and made a grabbing motion.

Luciel frowned because he thought that William would squeeze his heart, and rip it out of his chest.

Suddenly, Luciel felt a searing pain that he had not felt before. It was as if his entire body was being ripped in half like a piece of paper.

Slowly, but surely, William started to pull back his hand, making Luciel’s entire body convulse as if he was suffering from an epileptic attack.

The moment the Half-Elf’s hand broke free from the Demon Lord’s body, Luciel’s movement stopped completely. In his hand a glowing orb of red light could be seen, and it was frantically trying to break free from William’s hold.

“You think physical torture is enough for me?” the corner of William’s lips curled up as he stared at the struggling soul in his hand. “You had made Chiffon’s life a living hell, and you think you can get away with just physical torture?”

“Just kill me!” Luciel’s soul screamed in pain as the small, flickering, dark flames licked the soul’s body, making the Demon Lord experience a pain he had never felt before.

William knew more than anyone else how painful it was to have half of a soul torn from its source. This was a pain that transcended all pain, surpassing any kind of physical torture one could experience in their lifetime.

At that moment, the sound of hurried footsteps were heard in the hallway. Not long after, Joash, the Black Dragon, who also had a grudge against Luciel appeared.

“Give him to me,” Joash demanded. “I will be the one to kill this bastard.”

“Get in line,” William replied without even turning his head to look at Vesta’s father, who had decisively decided to betray the Demon Race for the sake of vengeance. “I was here first.”

The Black Dragon clenched his fist in anger because he was the one who wanted to torture Luciel and make him scream for the death of his wife.

However, William also had a valid reason for making the Demon Lord suffer, so he couldn’t find an excuse to get first dibs on Luciel’s soul.

Seeing Joash’s face, that was contorted with rage, a devilish smile appeared on Wiliam’s lips. Using the power of darkness, he encased Luciel’s soul in a protective coating.

“Fine, I’ll give you one day to have your way with him,” William said before tossing the orb of light towards the Black Dragon who hurriedly caught it with both hands, as if afraid that the Half-Elf would snatch it back from him. “Remember one day. You are not allowed to destroy, or disperse his soul. I will be the one to do that.”

William then walked out of the prison room, leaving the Black Dragon, and Luciel’s soul behind him.

Vesta had helped him in the past, so he considered allowing Joash to have time to torture Luciel doing him a favor. Also, even though he still wasn’t sure about his hunch, he felt that Vesta would also play an important role for him in the future.

Haleth, Amelia, Pearl, and Priscilla. These were the girls that he had met in the past.

A pretty lady with a single horn on her forehead. William had finally been able to put a name to the face in his dream, which was none other than Anh, the granddaughter of the Patriarch of the One-Horned Clan.

A green-haired beauty with a tail that resembled that of a lizard.

William chuckled because he had made a mistake. It was not a lizard’s tail, but a dragon’s tail. Vesta was the other lady in his dreams.

Last, but not the least, a Half-ling who looked like a doll that was only a little more than three feet tall.

The black-haired teenager still hadn’t met this person, and she was the last missing piece to complete the puzzle that was said to lead to his Hope. He had seen their faces in his dreams, and yet, he hadn’t expected to meet these ladies in the real world.

“Only one more left,” William muttered as he finally left the Demonic Prison behind him. “I wonder... where could she possibly be?”

William had no answer to this question. However, he had a feeling that sooner or later, the last lady that he had dreamed of long ago, would find her way to him, regardless of whether he looked for her or not in the future.Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels
