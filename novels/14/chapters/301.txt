Chapter 301: Joined At The Hips

Five days had passed since William and Ashe opened up their hearts to each other.

They spent these five days learning more about their partner’s life story. William told her everything about his childhood, just like he had told everything to Wendy at the Underground Lake when he accidentally wandered through the Magic Division.

In return, Ashe told William about her life in a secluded mountain that was protected by the Knights of the Hellan Kingdom. In that mountain, there was a village where Nymphs, Half-Nymphs, and Humans lived together.

William was very interested to know more about Ashe and he listened attentively to her story while holding her in his embrace. The one that suggested that they get to know each other was William because he wanted to know more about Ashe’s life before he’d met them on the road to the temple.

He was relieved that she hadn’t suffered any hardships while growing up. Ashe narrated everything, including when she and her twin sister were selected to become Est’s retainers.

“You know, I thought that I was going to die when that troll brandished his wooden club to smash us,” Ashe said as she closed her eyes.

She was resting her head on William’s shoulder, while the latter held her in a firm embrace. “I have to admit that you looked very cool when you and Ella jumped over our heads and blocked that attack for us. Sometimes, when my thoughts wander, that scene always appears in my mind.”

William smiled and planted a kiss on her forehead. During these past few days, he realized that Ashe was a true tsundere and she looked extremely cute when she went full “dere” on him. He still couldn’t believe that the “boy” with whom he had a hate-hate relationship would one day become one of his lovers.

“Aren’t you lucky?” William inquired. “You don’t need to dream about me anymore because both of us are now joined at our hips. You can kiss, hug, and look at me every single day. You really got the better half of the deal when you saved my life.”

Ashe wanted to roll her eyes at William’s reply, but she was secretly happy that she could now be intimate with him when the two of them were together.

“Will, let’s try it,” Ashe proposed. “I don’t really understand that Synchronization thing that your Big Brother was talking about, but I feel that the current me is able to accept everything about you.”

“Are you sure?” William inquired.

“Yes. I want to feel bonded with you, spiritually.”

“Understood.”

Ashe was a Half-Nymph. However, the blood of the Nymph Race was thicker in her veins, so her Spiritual Power was quite high. When her powers were sealed, the Human side of her converted that Spiritual Power to Magic Power. Hence why she and Isaac were placed in the Magic Division along with Est.

William lowered his head and kissed Ashe’s lips. Both of them had kissed many times now, and Ashe was no longer embarrassed about having a deep and passionate kiss with William. After their kiss ended, William pressed his forehead over hers and muttered the incantation inside his head.

‘Familia Oversoul.’

Ashe’s body turned into Spirit Energy and entered William’s body through the gem embedded inside his chest.

William felt a warm sensation spreading from his chest to all the parts of his body. He could feel a surge of power from within him and this power felt familiar and unfamiliar at the same time.

It was a strange experience. It was as if someone was hugging him from behind and it made him feel that he wasn’t fighting alone.

William’s eye color changed from light-green to purple as Ashe’s power seeped through every pore of his being.

‘Incredible. Will, this is incredible,’ Ashe whispered softly in William’s ears. ‘I feel so connected with you. It is as if the two of us are sharing the same body.’

‘I feel the same way as well,’ William replied.

In truth, Ashe didn’t need to whisper in his ears. The two of them could communicate using thoughts, but since this was the first time the two of them had fused together, the young lady was still using the gestures that she was familiar with.

“Are you ready?” William asked.

‘Yes,’ Ashe replied. ‘I was born ready. Also, don’t say what you are currently thinking. The two of us are connected, so I can read your thoughts.’

William chuckled as he summoned a water whip in his hand. He was planning to tease Ashe and say that she was “born for him”, but the latter had already read the thought inside his head.

‘Concentrate.’

“Mmm.”

William took a deep breath as his expression became serious. It was the first time that the two of them had tried fusing together. A blue transparent mermaid hovered William’s back. She was holding a sword whip in her hand and guided William in the proper way to wield his powers.

“They did it faster than my initial estimate,” Issei said as he observed William and Ashe from inside his special domain.

Lily and David sat beside him and observed William’s training with calm expressions on their faces.

“It would be best if you prevent William from talking to his lover after this training ends,” Lily proposed. “I don’t want him to be distracted when he starts my training course. Especially now that the Hellan Kingdom is facing a crisis.”

“Okay,” Issei replied. “I’ll talk to both of them and say that their next reunion would have to wait until he has finished his training with you and David. My only concern is, can we make it in time? Even with the time extensions inside our own domains, the possibility of the war nearing its end while he is training is very high.”

“It doesn’t matter,” David commented from the side. “He is not capable of helping anyone in his current state. I will only permit him to leave after he has ascended to and mastered the next phase of the Shepherd Job Class. The Hellan Kingdom can burn in hell for all I care.”

Issei and Lily nodded their heads in agreement. As Gods, they didn’t really care about the results of the War between the Two Dynasties and the Hellan Kingdom. They didn’t have any followers in the Southern Continent and they had no obligation to help.

The only one they cared about was William and the people close to him. The Shepherd was ill equipped to participate in the war because his Spiritual World had almost been destroyed. He would only hasten the continuance of the destruction of his Sea of Consciousness if he were to return to his world and take part in the defense of his Kingdom.

Only when the Half-Elf had mastered the power of his Divinities would they allow him to leave the temple. They would not allow an incident similar to what happened with the Astral Worm to happen again.𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com
