1264 Don't Test My Patience

A month after the battle in the Elun Empire...

“To think that we were allies just a month ago,” Joash, the mighty Black Dragon that ruled over the Amberfang Fortress said in disdain. “Now, they are trying to break past the fortress that served as the first line of defense against the Demon Invasion in the Central Continent. Humans truly are fickle creatures.”

After a month of constant bombardment by the five Pseudo-Gods that belonged to the alliance and the Holy Order of Light, the leyline that was sustaining the barrier of the fortress had almost dried up.

According to Joash’s estimate, the barrier that protected the fortress would only last for one more day before it disappeared completely.

He already knew that both sides had only been using each other for their own interests. Joash needed the power of the Alliance and the Holy Order to have his revenge against Luciel and his family for what they did to his wife.

The Alliance and the Holy Order of Light wanted him to block the first wave of the Demon Army’s attack, and prevent them from reaching the Central Continent using the sturdy walls of the Amberfang Fortress.

Unfortunately, Ahriman already had a way of entering the Central Continent without needing to bypass the Amberfang Fortress, which served as the first line of defense of the Demon Continent against any invasion coming from the Central Continent.

Because of the recent happenings in the Central Continent, no one had time to deal with Joash and his Demon Army who were still stationed inside the Amberfang Fortress.

The other armies, including those of the Elves and the Humans, had returned to the Central Continent on the first day, because Felix had conquered the Zabia Kingdom.

The only army left on the Fortress was the army that belonged solely to Joash, and they were completely outnumbered, and outmatched by the combined force of the Alliance and the Holy Order of Light.

The Pope promised that the lands of the Demon Continent would be divided equally among the members of the alliance, as compensation for letting them annex the Zabia Kingdom, Slovell Kingdom, as well as the Zoterra Empire.

These were the former territories that Felix had captured, but were now under the jurisdiction and full control of the Holy Order of Light, making the Alliance dissatisfied with them.

In order to appease the various rulers, the Pope decided to attack the Demon Continent and use the lands that belonged to it to tempt the other sovereigns into participating in the battle.

Naturally, the Holy Order would keep their word. However, they also planned to get a big slice of the pie, which included the Demon Capital, Astryae.

The next day...

“Just a little more!” one of the Commanders leading the Human armies shouted. “Everyone, are you ready to pay these Demons back for the war they started?!”

“””Yes!”””

“Are you ready to avenge our fallen comrades, as well as punish them for the monstrosity they unleashed on the people of the Central Continent?!”

“””Yes!”””

The Commander glanced at the barrier that had several cracks on its surface before raising his weapon high.

“Everyone get ready!” the Commander shouted. “We charge as soon as the Barrier breaks!”

“””Yes!”””

As if waiting for that moment, the sound of tens of thousands of crystal cups reverberated in the battlefield, as the barrier that protected Amberfang Fortress finally fell.

“Charge!” the Commander ordered as he rode his Wyvern towards the Fortress who had lost its protection. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Countless Hippogriffs, Gryphons, Wyverns, and even Dragons flew towards the Amberfang Fortress. They had only been given one order and that was to kill as many Demons as they could and find a way to open the gates, allowing their main army to push through.

They were not worried about the appearance of the Demigod, Joash, because others would deal with him.

If in the past, these Human armies wouldn’t dare to attack the Demon Continent because they were going to face a Demigod. However, after the Pseudo-Gods had made their appearance, the balance in power had shifted to those who had more of these beings, whose strength had surpassed the Demigod Rank.

Joash knew that the time had come, so he emerged from the Amberfang Fortress and unleashed his Dragon Breath towards the incoming Human armies who planned to breach the defenses of his fortress.

However, before his Dark Flames could even reach their target, swathes of Golden Flames descended from the Heavens and devoured the power of his Dragon Breath.

Joash wasn’t surprised by this outcome because he had already accepted that there was simply no way for him to overcome the difference in ranks.

Five Pseudo-Gods against one Demigod.

This matchup was simply too funny to even consider Joash’s chances of winning. The Pseudo-Gods didn’t attack the Black Dragon who hovered in the air with the arrogance of someone who used to sit at the apex of the world.

It was at this moment when the projection of the Pope appeared in the sky, looking down on Joash and the defenders of Amberfang Fortress.

“Since you had allied yourselves with us against the Heir of Darkness, I will be magnanimous and allow you and your men to surrender,” The Pope stated. “We will not treat you unfairly, but you will have to be locked up until the duration of our conquest in the Demon Continent. This is my last act of mercy. Surrender, or perish!”

Joash flapped his wings calmly as he faced the Pope’s projection in the sky.

“How about, No?” Joash replied. “If you want my head so badly, come and get it!”

“Fool,” the Pope snorted as she pointed her finger at the Black Dragon who dared to defy her act of mercy. “The time of Demigods is over. You are but an old relic of the past that no longer serves a purpose. Go and end his suffering. Kill him!”

One of the Pseudo-Gods stepped forward and summoned a sword. The other Pseudo-Gods didn’t make a move because they felt that it was far beneath them to deal with a Demigod with all five of them.

‘Good thing I allowed Vesta to accompany that brat,’ Joash thought. ‘Now, I don’t need to worry about her safety.’

The Black Dragon of the Demon Realm roared in arrogance as he flew towards the Pseudo-God with bloodshot eyes.

Just as the Pope had said, he was once one of the Apex Beings of the world. Even when facing beings whose rank far surpassed his realm, Joash was fearless.

Although he regretted that he was unable to personally kill Luciel, who had been hidden in the dungeons of the Demon Capital, there was nothing he could do about it.

His last family member, Vesta, was somewhere safe, so he no longer needed to hold back as he performed his duty as the Protector of the Demon Realm.

When the Black Dragon and the Pseudo-God were only hundreds of meters away from each other, a call—that made Joash’s heart skip a beat—reached his ears.

“Father!”

Joash turned his head to look at a young lady with long green hair, and a green tail that resembled that of a dragon.

“W-What are you doing here?!” Joash cried out of anger and disbelief. He was prepared to fight to the death because he believed that her daughter was in safe hands. However, after seeing Vesta, he immediately changed his flight path and made a turn to go to where his daughter was.

The Pseudo-God, of course, didn’t plan on letting Joash go.

“You are stupid for showing your back at your enemy!” the Pseudo-God shouted as he slashed on the Black Dragon’s back, with the intention of severing it in half.

But, before his blade could even touch the Black Dragon’s scales, a spear infused with lightning bolts repelled the attack aimed at Joash’s back.

The Black Dragon shifted his gaze towards the black-haired teenager whose robes were fluttering in the wind.

The lightning spear he threw earlier returned to his hand, and it crackled with lightning bolts as if finding this battle laughable.

“William,” Joash muttered.

The Black Dragon didn’t want to admit it, but he found himself sighing in relief after seeing who the newcomer was. He didn’t ask the black-haired teenager to come to his aid or anything because of his pride.

However, against all odds, William had appeared, which only meant one thing.

“From now on, the Demon Realm is under my protection,” William declared and hundreds of portals appeared in the sky and on the land. “If you don’t wish to die, all of you should go back to where you came from. Don’t test my patience.”

Seven Pseudo-Gods stepped out of the portals alongside hundreds of thousands of Beasts, whose bloodshot eyes were looking at the combined might of the Alliance, as well as the Holy Order of Light.

The battlefield came to a complete standstill as countless beasts of different sizes and types poured out of the portals. The Pope had already been informed that there was a high possibility that William might be this generation’s Dungeon Conqueror.

She thought that this was only a bunch of nonsense, but after seeing that scene in front of her, she had no choice but to think of the worst case scenario.

If the Alliance and the Holy Order had been feeling confident before, that they could bring down Amberfang Fortress on their own, now, they were feeling anxious.

In the face of millions of Beasts whose numbers were still increasing, they were having second thoughts about whether they should continue to fight or retreat as fast as they could.
