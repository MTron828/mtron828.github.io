Chapter 423: Est’s Innocence [Part 1]

Inside William’s Spiritual World the subtle sounds of kissing could be heard. A girl with long, silver hair, was being held by a red-headed boy in a firm embrace.

William kissed Est’s soft lips with light pecks while she had her eyes closed and her arms wrapped around his back.

Two minutes later, William pulled back and looked at the beautiful lady whom he considered to be one of his best friends. This was the first time that the two of them had spent some time alone with each other inside his Sea of Consciousness. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

After William had explained why he couldn’t bestow additional powers onto Est, the latter asked him how far he had gone with Ashe and Wendy.

Although this was a tricky question, William answered honestly that he still hadn’t crossed that line with Ashe and Wendy. Naturally, he also told Est about what happened with Wendy and explained that it was something that was out of his control.

Est understood this, but she still asked William to share a bit of intimacy with her. This was why both of them had Synchronized and gone into William’s Spiritual World where Est’s true form could appear before his eyes.

Unlike Wendy and Ashe, who sometimes took the initiative, Est was very passive when it came to the things that lovers did.

She also wanted to experience kissing, but since she didn’t have any experience, she left everything in William’s hands.

When the Half-Elf held Est’s slender body, and pressed his lips over hers to kiss her, he came to the realization that his third lover was unexpectedly very timid when it came to kissing. She was like a vase that could break if he held her too hard, so William took things slowly, and gently.

He didn’t ravage her lips like he had done with Wendy in their one night of passion, nor did he initiate to intertwine their tongues together like what he did with Ashe during Issei’s training. He just gave simple, soft, pecks on her soft lips and that was enough to make Est’s legs turn into jelly.

William looked at his third lover with gentle eyes and waited for her to regain her composure.

“How was your first kiss?” William asked. “Was it to your liking?”

Est unconsciously touched her lips with her hand as she stared back at Wiliam. “It was very different from how I imagined it to be. But…”

The silver-haired beauty placed her free hand over her chest as a blush crept up her face. “My heart is beating wildly inside my chest. This was my first kiss and yet…”

“And yet?” William inquired. He looked at her with loving eyes as he waited for her to continue what she was planning to say.

“And yet… I want more,” Est replied. “However, I feel as if you were holding back. Is there something wrong?”

William smiled and caressed the side of her face. “I was doing my best to hold back. I’m afraid that, if I lose control, I might break you and I don’t want to do that.”

“Break me?”

“Yes.”

William then pulled her close and allowed her head to rest on his shoulder.

“You were just so cute that I almost lost myself,” William whispered. “I know that this might sound rude coming from me, but I’m glad that a curse was placed on you. If not then I’m afraid that all the guys in the Martial, Magic, and Spirit Divisions would fight against each other in order to become your lover.”

“You’re exaggerating,” Est whispered back.

“No, I’m not. It is the truth.”

“…”

Est became speechless because she could feel the sincerity in William’s voice and demeanor. Because of this, she felt something warm spread throughout her chest which made her very happy.

The two hugged for a while before William once again kissed his lover’s lips. After a few soft pecks, William asked Est if she was willing to try something different. Est hesitated for a brief moment, but she still nodded her head. She was curious about what William meant by trying something different.

“Part your lips,” William said softly. “And don’t bite my tongue.”

Est timidly obeyed. As soon as her lips parted, William kissed her again, but this time, his tongue entered her mouth. The silver-haired beauty’s body shuddered when William’s tongue intertwined with hers.

It was a very foreign feeling to her, but she didn’t resist and allowed William to have his way. Just like the last time, William did it gently. He played with Est’s tongue as the latter gradually got used to his soft and gentle attacks.

William pulled back and both of them panted for breaths. They didn’t know how long the kiss lasted. All they knew was that they had been lost in their own world as they shared their feelings for each other.

“That kiss is very different from the one we first had,” Est said as she looked at William with moist eyes. “It is more… intense. What is it called?”

“Was it too intense?” William asked, a little concerned.

Est shook her head.

William smiled then as he looked at his lover’s disheveled expression. Est had always been a prim and proper person. Seeing her in this state almost made William want to pin her down and teach her how intense a kiss could be.

“It’s called a French Kiss,” William replied. “How was it? Was it better compared to before?”

Est closed her eyes to ponder William’s question. She had always been the serious type. She even took William’s teasing seriously.

“The first one was soft and, yet, my heart felt like it was dancing,” Est said with her eyes still closed. “I didn’t dislike that feeling. In fact, I loved it because I felt how much you cared about me through your actions.

“The second one was different. I could feel your intense feelings of wanting to… make me yours.” The shade of red in Est’s face became deeper when she felt William’s desire to own her through the kiss.

William was surprised because although he had held back, his heart and body wanted to leave his mark on the beautiful girl in front of him and make her understand that her lips belonged to him.

‘This is bad,’ William thought. ‘Estelle is pushing all of my buttons. I might not be able to control myself if we continue.’

Although William had been trained by Owen and the Goddess Eros about how to deal with ladies, Est was making him feel like a criminal that was planning to stain something pure with his colors.
