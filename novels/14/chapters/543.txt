Chapter 543: When Was The Last Time You Ate Trash?

Titania’s Gauntlet was a pair of dark-steel gauntlets with gold plated lines engraved over it. Its design was similar to the Infinitea Gauntlets that he had seen in a movie, which was used by a Super Villain to wipe out half the population of the universe.

William noticed that only one of the gauntlets had a green gem embedded on it that glowed with a greenish light. There were five slots in each gauntlet, which meant that it was possible to embed other gems in it to increase its power.

Although William didn’t know how he could procure these other gems, the most important matter at the moment was securing the gauntlet. He could worry about the elemental gems later.

“500,000.”

William raised his bid as soon as the auctioneer opened the bidding.

“600,000!”

“700,000!”

The Half-Elf narrowed his eyes because he expected that there would be interested parties that would bid for it as well. However, he had no intention of backing down.

“1.3 Million!” William declared.

William wanted to intimidate everyone so he decided to raise the bid instantly. He only hoped that the other bidders would be intimidated and back off, because he had limited funds.

Unfortunately, there were others that had also noticed the potential of the gauntlets, and wanted to acquire it for themselves.

“2 Million!” one of the bidders declared.

“2.5 Million!” William countered.

“3 Million!” the person who had outbid William earlier shouted.

Clearly, he was not going to back down.

William only had over Four Million God Points, and he had already gone past his budget. He leaned back on the comfortable couch and sighed in regret.

[ Host, if you like, I can analyze the gauntlet and create a recipe that you could use to craft a near-replica of it using the Blacksmith Job Class. However, you will need to pay 100,000 God Points for it. Would you like to proceed with the analysis? ]

The System’s words were like music in William’s ears. He had completely forgotten about his Blacksmith Job Class. Although its level wasn’t high enough to create Titania’s Gauntlets, creating a near-replica was not impossible.

‘Yes! Analyze it for me!’

[ Understood. ]

[ Starting Analysis. ]

After William stopped bidding for the gauntlet, the auctioneer tried to hype it up a little more, but the bidders had already decided to give up.

They were only candidates, and their funds were limited. They couldn’t compete with Big Shots that were greatly favored by their Patron Gods that showered them with God Points.

“Going once!

“Going twice!”

“Sold for 3 Million God Points!”

The auctioneer’s gavel slammed on her desk, marking the end of the Auction.

William waited in bated breath as the System rapidly analyzed the gauntlets before it was taken away by the staff of the auction house.

Only after William heard the familiar notification sounds did he breathe a sigh of relief.

[ Analysis Completed! ]

[ Titania’s Gauntlet (Replica) Crafting Recipe has been acquired. ]

-

God Points: 4,350,642

William hurriedly checked the materials needed to craft the gauntlet. Not only that, the exact process on how he could craft it was also written in the recipe that the system had analyzed for him.

‘A little tricky but not impossible,’ William pondered. ‘If I succeed, It will take me three days to craft it. The materials that I need are a bit pricey, but they are still within the acceptable range.’

After confirming the things he needed, he asked the System to purchase the items that he currently didn’t have in his possession. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

‘I need to tell Ashe and Sidonie that I will be gone for a day or two,’ William mused as he returned to the Thousand Beast Domain. ‘For the time being, I’ll have both of them to look after Chiffon while I’m gone.’

Just as soon as William returned to his room inside the Boy’s Dormitory, Ashe’s voice sounded inside his head and it sounded very urgent.

“Will, come and help us,” Ashe’s said in a voice laced with anxiousness. “There are six people that have us surrounded. It seems that they know Chiffon, and wanted to take her away. Please hurr-kyah!”

Ashe’s words were cut off and it sounded that she had been attacked by someone. William immediately dashed out of his room and asked the System to pinpoint her location. After finding her coordinates, William clad himself in lightning and disappeared from where he stood.

Fifteen minutes earlier…

Ian and Chiffon went to see the Garden of Silverwind Academy. The two were admiring the beautiful scenery around them when suddenly, six people encircled them, while they were taking a stroll in the garden.

Ian immediately knew that something was wrong because the moment Chiffon saw one of the men, her body stiffened, and started to shake uncontrollably. She then pulled the little girl close to her as she eyed the adults with a guarded stance.

“Who are you and what do you want?” Ian asked.

One of the men stepped forward and gave Chiffon a sidelong glance before shifting his attention to Ian. The man seemed to be in his mid-twenties and had short purple hair. He also had above average looks, but his light-red eyes, that were looking at Ian, weren’t friendly.

“Who I am is not important,” the purple-haired man replied. “We have no business with you. Our purpose for coming here is to talk to that little girl by your side. Chiffon, come with us. I’m sure that you don’t want your friend to be involved in our business, right?”

Chiffon’s body shuddered even more when the man called out her name. The little girl felt her legs weaken, and would have collapsed on the ground if Ian didn’t support her body right away.

“I-I don’t want to talk,” Chiffon stuttered. “P-Please, I’ve been a good girl. I haven’t done anything wrong.”

The purple-haired man eyed the shivering girl from head to foot. His eyes were filled with ridicule and contempt as he took a step forward to grab Chiffon’s wrist. .

The little girl cried out in fear. And clung to Ian like her life depended on it.

“Let her go now, or I’ll call the guards!” Ian threatened as he wrapped his arms around Chiffon to prevent anyone from taking her away.

The purple-haired man chuckled as he firmly held Chiffon’s wrist like a vice grip. The little girl was in a state of complete fear, that it had over-ridden the pain she was currently experiencing from the man’s strong grip.

“Guards?” the purple-haired man snorted. “Are you talking about those guards over there?”

The purple haired man pointed at a dozen guards in the entrance. They were blocking the entrance of the garden and prevented any students from coming in.

It was quite obvious that they were in cahoots with the six-men that were surrounding two of their academy’s students.

“Chiffon, you look so pretty and neat right now,” the purple haired man said with a smile. “Tell me, when was the last time you visited the Garbage Dump? When was the last time you ate Trash? Isn’t your nickname Trash Eater? Why have you stopped eating it?”

A tear slid down the side of Chiffon’s face, followed by another, soon, the pink-haired girl’s face was stained by tears as she started to wail and struggle from her captor’s grip.

“Bastard! Let her go!” Ian summoned her water whip and immediately attacked the man out of anger.

However, the man was already on his guard and summoned his own weapon to deflect Ian’s attack.

“Since you attacked first, I will fight back as self defense.” The purple-haired man sneered. “Don’t worry, I will not beat you up too much because we have a deal with the Academy.”

The purple-haired man kicked Ian’s chest sending him flying a few meters away from Chiffon. Two men immediately pinned him down to the ground to prevent him from interfering with their mission.

“Ian!” Chiffon cried out as she struggled to break free from the man’s grip. “Let me go! Let me go!”

The purple haired man chuckled as he grabbed the little girl’s neck and lifted her in the air.

“Don’t worry, I will let you go, but we have to take a trip to the Garbage Dump first,” the purple haired man said in a teasing tone. “I’m sure that you’re very hungry right now, so I’ll help you eat a lot.”

Chiffon’s face was starting to redden due to her struggle and lack of air to breathe. The guards who were watching in the distance sighed as they averted their gaze in guilt. If possible, they wanted to help the little girl, but this was what they had agreed upon when the six men came to meet Chiffon during Princess Sidonie’s birthday party.

“Chiffon, you’re so light right now that I can lift you with a single hand,” the man said. “This is no good. You must eat more trash. You need to eat a lot until you are full.”

Chiffon’s gaze was starting to blur due to the lack of oxygen. She had already stopped struggling because it was pointless. The little girl had already accepted her fate, and no longer resisted her captor’s taunting.

Seeing that Chiffon had already given up hope, the purple haired man sneered internally. He was about to let the little girl go when a flash of light appeared, followed by a loud cracking sound.

“Ahhhhhh!” the purple-haired man screamed in pain as he held his arm, which was now bent in an unnatural angle.

Chiffon raised her head to see who had come to save her. Even though her vision was already blurry, she immediately recognized the red-headed teenager who was holding her in a princess carry.

“Sorry I’m late,” William said in a voice laced with killing intent.

After seeing Ian being pinned down on the ground by two men, and Chiffon being strangled by someone, the Half-Elf’s killing intent oozed out from his body.

The Half-Elf looked down at the purple-haired man who seemed to be the leader of the group that was responsible for hurting his girls.

“Hey, punk, do you want to try dying once?” William asked.

William was not someone who condoned senseless killing, but he didn’t shy away from killing bastards that deserved to die.

Right now, even if the Emperor of the Kraetor Empire intervened, he would stop at nothing until he gave the man in front of him a very slow, and painful, death.
