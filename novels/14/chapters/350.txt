Chapter 350: Kiss My Hand To Show Your Undying Loyalty

Somewhere between the God Realm and reality, there floated a valley. A concentrated ball of dark energy pulsed within the cave where the monument was located. Because of The System’s sudden intervention, the integration of the Monument and William’s own domain was forcefully put into a halt.

The System didn’t dare to continue the merging, while William was still unconscious and submerged in dark energy.

Within that concentrated ball of darkness, a small blue light pulsed in a steady rhythm. It was steadily absorbing the dark magic at a rapid place as if it was an impoverished person that hadn’t eaten in days.

Just before William got hit by the Dark Energy, The System had switched his Subclass to Dark Wizard.

When this Job Class was equipped, William’s resistance to Dark Magic’s corruption was boosted to an unprecedented degree. Also, the Collar of Wisteria and the Spirit Core worked together to transform the Dark Energy into Spirit Energy, which helped strengthen William’s body and Spiritual World.

With each passing hour, the concentrated ball of Dark Energy shrank.

An hour after the Ball of Dark Energy disappeared, William finally opened his eyes. His body was aching all over as if he had been trampled by a herd of Angorian War Ibexes.

It took him a few more minutes before he could ask The System about what had transpired while he was unconscious.

[ Congratulations Host! Your Dark Wizard Job Class has reached Level 22! ]

“Huh?”

William blinked before he hurriedly opened his Status Page to see if The System was just teasing him. After checking his stats for the third time, a smile broke out of William’s face as he silently thanked whoever was responsible for giving him a free boost in experience points.

[ Host, please listen to me. We are currently in a dangerous situation. Right now, we are hovering between the real world and the God Domain. If the host doesn’t act soon, we would be unable to return to Hestia. Based on my calculations, we only have fifteen minutes to complete the merging of the domain before we get stuck here forever. ]

“Fck! Hurry, restart the merging!” William hastily ordered The System.

[ Restarting merging of Domains… ]

[ Second Phase Commencing… ]

William focused all of attention on the monument as he helped The System forcefully attach the Hidden Valley to his Thousand Beast Domain. Fortunately, no other attacks came from the Undying Lands, which allowed William to complete the merging.

[ Host, I’ll open a portal through time and space to return you to your world, make sure to enter it as soon as possible. ]

“Understood.”

[ Forceful tearing of Time and Space initiated! ]

A small portal that was only a meter wide appeared in front of William. He didn’t hesitate and entered it head first, because he knew that The System couldn’t maintain it for a long period of time.

After entering the portal, William found himself falling headfirst towards the ground. Luckily, he only fell five meters above ground, and was able to turn himself around-somewhat, so he didn’t suffer any injuries at all.

However, before he could even assess his surroundings, he felt a sharp blade against his neck.

“Don’t move.”

A familiar voice ordered him from behind. He didn’t need to turn his head to know who the owner of the voice was.

“Priscilla, are you trying to kill your drop-dead-gorgeous, and super awesome Knight Commander?” William asked in a teasing tone.

“C-Commander William?!” Priscilla hurriedly removed the blade that was pressed against William’s neck and backed away.

William turned his head and looked at the black-haired beauty in surprise.

“Fancy meeting you here, Priscilla.” William looked at his Vice-Commander whom he hadn’t seen for a long time. It was at this moment when he realized that his current surroundings were somewhat dark and dry. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“Where are the other members of the Knight Order?” William inquired. “Where are we?”

Priscilla looked at William with a complicated gaze. She didn’t know how to answer the Half-Elf’s inquiry because she didn’t know whose side he was on. Fortunately, there was someone in the spacious underground cavern that came to her rescue.

“Allow me to answer that question for you, Sir William,” a voice that was as smooth as silk entered William’s ear from the back.

William turned his head and came face to face with an angelic beauty with long reddish-brown hair. The Half-Elf could have sworn that he had never seen hazel eyes as beautiful as hers, that seemed to stare right through his soul.

A familiar feeling took hold of his body as Princess Sidonie walked towards him. Her fragrance assaulted his senses as she tenderly caressed the side of William’s face, while looking straight into his eyes.

“Kneel,” Princess Sidonie ordered. “From now on, you will be my Knight. My personal protector that will stay with me for life. Kneel, Sir William, and kiss my hand to show your undying loyalty. In turn, I promise that I will treat you well and keep you with me until the day you draw your last breath…”

Princess Sidonie looked at the handsome Half-Elf in front of her and gave him her sweetest smile. She had turned many people into her personal slaves, but he had to admit that the red-headed boy held a special place in her heart.

Even Morgana had no complaints about making William their Knight in Shining Armor. Although they wouldn’t admit it, both girls felt their heart beating fast as they stared at William’s light-green eyes that were as clear as a polished emerald.

Princess Sidonie and Morgana watched as the boy, whom they liked, raised his hand and lovingly…
