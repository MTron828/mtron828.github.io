Chapter 271: A Night In Valhalla [Rated-18]

[Disclaimer: This chapter is R-18. You already know the drill *wink wink* ]

The sound of birds singing and water flowing from a small fountain reached William’s ears as he found himself in an unfamiliar place.

He didn’t know how or when it happened, but he was now half-submerged in what seemed to be a pool filled to the brim with spring water. The water was so clear that he could see the bottom without any problems. William scanned his surroundings to get an idea of where he was, but what he saw made his eyes widen in shock.

A vast and beautiful valley, that was dyed in the red and yellow colors of autumn, appeared in front of his eyes. Several women with a pair of white wings behind their backs flew in the distance. They were wearing a type of armor that reminded William of the Valkyries in the games that he had played back on Earth.

It was late in the afternoon and the sun was slowly descending in the West. He estimated that it was only an hour or two away from sunset.

It didn’t take long for him to realize that he was bathing in a pool that was on top of what seemed to be a mountain that overlooked everything around him. It felt so surreal, and luxurious, that the red-headed boy didn’t know what to think.

“Aren’t you finished bathing yet, husband?”

A bold voice filled with eager expectation sounded behind him.

When William turned his head to look, he found himself staring at a beautiful lady who seemed to be in her early twenties looking at him with a satisfied smile.

Her long blonde hair rested on her waist, while a pair of light-blue eyes looked at him as if she was looking at the love of her life. The four pairs of wings behind her back flapped softly as she landed on the ground.

William looked at the lady in front of him and recognized her instantly. Although she was a bit older, taller, and more curvy, there was no doubt in his mind that the girl he was staring at was his “girlfriend”, Wendy.

Like the “Valkyries” he had seen earlier, Wendy was also wearing a set of revealing lightweight armor that made William wonder if it really offered some[any] kind of protection.

“What’s wrong? Haven’t you finished bathing?” Wendy inquired as she moved closer. “Ah! Maybe you are waiting for me to finish my duties, so that I can join you? As expected of my beloved. You really do love me.”

William didn’t know how to react because things were happening way too fast for him to process. Before he could even reply to the lady in front of him, the latter had already removed her armor and waded into the pool towards him.

“W-Wendy?” William inquired. “You’re Wendy, right?”

“Of course, I’m Wendy,” Wendy frowned. “What’s wrong? Do you not even recognize your own wife?”

Wendy had already arrived beside William and playfully caressed his chest. The moment her soft, delicate hands touched his skin, a surge of electric current passed through William’s body.

That was when he realized that there were a few things about his body that were different. He was a head taller than the lady in front of him, and his body was more muscular compared to his fourteen-year-old self.

William grabbed his hair and found it long enough to rest on his shoulder. The surprising part about this was that the color of his hair was silver!

He tried to reel in the surprise and confusion he was feeling and decided to ask the beautiful lady some questions.

“Wendy, where are we?” William asked as he stopped Wendy’s flirtatious hand from moving downwards. “Where are Priscilla, Est, and the others?”

The air suddenly became tense as Wendy narrowed gaze. “Who is this Priscilla, Est and the others you are talking about? Are you having an affair with the other Valkyries behind my back?”

Wendy released a powerful pressure that descended on William like a mountain. The expression of the beautiful young lady suddenly changed into a Warrior Princess who had just caught her husband cheating on her.

“Hey, why aren’t you answering my questions?” Wendy asked as her hand gripped William’s wrist. The sound of something breaking and the pain that followed after made the silver-haired young man wince in pain.

Seeing his pained expression, Wendy immediately released her hold on his wrist and the tense atmosphere disappeared completely.

“S-Sorry,” Wendy apologized as she cradled William’s injured hand. “You know that I’m a very jealous person. You should know better than to mention the names of other girls in my presence.”

She then took out a small slice of apple from out of nowhere and made William eat it.

“This apple came from the golden apples of the Goddess Idun,” Wendy explained. “It will heal most injuries, and we usually only use it when we are injured in battle. I only have three more slices, so you’d better not hurt yourself, okay?”

William wanted to say that the one who hurt him was her, but he knew better than to argue with the lady who looked like the grown-up version of Wendy, but with a more brutal personality. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

A few seconds after eating the sliced apple, William’s injury was healed completely. He moved his hand, and arm and deemed that everything was working properly.

Wendy simply watched from the side as if she was amused by William’s actions.

“Um, you said I am your husband, when did we get married?” William inquired. He needed to get more information about his “wife” and this world that felt familiar to him.

“Has your head injury still not fully recovered?” Wendy asked back. “The healers said that some of your memories might have been affected because of your injury, but I didn’t know that it was this serious.”

Wendy suddenly became anxious as she cupped William’s face. “I’m sorry. I wasn’t able to control my strength and pushed you away during our wedding night. I didn’t expect that it would hurt so much after you put your…”

Wendy gulped as she lowered her head to look at the “Little William” that was currently poking her belly.

William was secretly admonishing his little guy for getting excited without his permission. Even so, he kept a calm expression as he listened to Wendy’s explanation.

“I knew you were a true warrior when I brought your soul back from the battlefield. But, I never expected that you would be very manly down there as well,” Wendy blushed as she averted her gaze. “We only got married three days ago, but because of your injury, I had no choice but to wait until you were fully healed to continue the consummation of our marriage.

“My senior said that since we have done it once already, it shouldn’t hurt as much when we do it the second time. Don’t worry, they gave me ropes that can withstand the strength of a Valkyrie. You can tie me up later, so I won’t be able to hurt you again.”

William did his best to prevent his lips from twitching after hearing Wendy’s explanation. He was still finding it hard to match the “crude and bold” lady in front of him from the “delicate and straightforward girl” who would instantly blush the moment he smiled at her.

‘So, we got married three days ago, but when I “Jammed it In” during our honeymoon, she got hurt and gave me a serious head injury,’ William thought as beads of sweat formed on his forehead. ‘She also managed to acquire ropes so that I could tie her up to prevent me from getting hurt again. I didn’t know that I’d be able to experience bondage play for the first time in my life in a dream.’

William looked at his wife and pulled her close to him. He then brushed her long, silky, blonde hair as he organized his thoughts. Wendy, on the other hand, closed her eyes and wrapped her arms around William’s back.

Their bodies pressed against each other, as the light of the sunset slowly disappeared on the horizon.

Half an hour later, Wendy flew in the air holding William in a princess carry. She headed towards a residence that was located on the cliff of the mountain.

The two of them had a light-dinner and then the ever-excited-wife half-dragged William towards the bedroom.

Although William had no experience on how the deed was done, he had watched enough H to understand the basics, not to mention, a certain old man that specialized in stamina training taught him the tricks on how to make ladies feel good.

‘I didn’t think that Owen’s 444 love making techniques would be used in a dream,’ William mused as he tied the beautiful lady up, according to her wishes. Although he still didn’t understand why he had suddenly appeared in Valhalla, he decided to go with the flow for now.

After tying Wendy’s arms and legs to the four corners of the bed, he kissed her forehead before looking straight into her eyes.

“Are you sure you want to do this?” William asked. “You can still say no, and I will untie you right away.”

“You are my husband and I am your wife,” Wendy answered. “I had to fight the other valkyries to call dibs on you first, you know? It’s your fault for standing out too much. Will, I have been waiting for this day for months. Don’t make me wait any longer, please.”

Seeing Wendy’s pleading gaze, William finally let go of all inhibitions and kissed her lips passionately. He then moved downwards to kiss her neck, her collarbone, and the two majestic peaks that stood proudly on her chest.

William did his best to control his emotions and did his best to be gentle. At first, he thought that everything he was seeing was just a dream. But the pain he had felt when Wendy crushed his wrist was so real that he was finding it hard to treat everything like an illusion.

Wendy’s sighs of pleasure reverberated in the room and it made William breath ragged. He was only caressing her body, and yet, Wendy was already driving him crazy with her seductive voice filled with pleasure.

In the end, he was unable to resist the urge and gave in to his instinct. He gently spread Wendy’s legs as he prepared to finish what he had started. William gave her one last kiss on the lips before he lowered his hips and…
