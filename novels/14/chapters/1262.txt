1262 Both Of You Are Right. Good Things Must Be Kept lIn The Family

“Only during times like this will you get the opportunity to see a peaceful expression on his face,” Invidia said as she cradled William’s head in her arms.

“Yes,” Princess Aila replied in a sad voice as she watched Invidia breastfeed William while taking on Ella’s form. “The wounds on the surface have already closed up, but the damage within is healing very slowly.”

“You don’t have to worry about that. The reason why we’re both here is so we can patch this guy up, so let’s just do our best.”

“Yes.”

Princess Aila had already taken off her clothes in order to help the Half-Elf recover. She then lowered her hips, as she slid William’s... inside of her, helping him to directly tap into the source of her Life Essence, which she had gathered in her womb.

When the unconscious William was brought to the Royal Palace of the Elun Empire, Chloee immediately called for Invidia and Princess Aila to come and check his condition. After performing an initial diagnosis on the Half-Elf’s body, Princess Aila came to the conclusion that the black-haired teenager’s soul had shifted a bit, and was in need of immediate treatment.

Since only Invidia and the angelic Princess had the ability to heal William in his current state, Chloee opened the portal to the Thousand Beast Domain, and brought the Half-Elf to the Villa there.

Chloee had been given partial authority to come and go inside the Thousand Beast Domain, and open portals if needed be. She didn’t feel safe letting William stay in the Royal Palace where the woman named Nisha was staying.

Even though Deus and William had formed an alliance, for some reason, the Succubus felt that the veiled woman was a dangerous individual, and refused to allow her to get close to William while the latter was unconscious.

While the two beautiful ladies used their bodies, and essences to let the black-haired teenager recover as soon as possible, William’s other subordinates were busy discussing their next course of action.

The Armies of the Kraetor Empire and the Amazon Empire had already entered the boundaries of the Elun Empire. Astrape and Bronte met with Emperor Leonidas and Empress Andraste.

They were already familiar with Lilith, so the discussion about allowing the two armies to enter the Elun Empire went smoothly. Both of them were William’s allies, so having them around would increase the security around the Half-Elf.

After a unanimous vote by William’s subordinates, they decided to stay in the Elun Empire for the time being.

The Bull Demon King and Princess Iron Fan were tossed inside the Dungeon of Atlantis and were being closely monitored by Triton and Leviathan. Both Pseudo-Gods were riddled with injuries, so it was near impossible for them to resist being imprisoned by a Peak Pseudo-God that had dominion over the sea.

“To think that our mighty neighbor, who used to make things difficult for us would suffer such a fate, I can’t help but feel sorry for them right now,” Emperor Leonidas said as he stared at the Capital City that had barely survived the clash between the Heir and Prince of Darkness.

“True,” Empress Andraste. “Under the whims of the Gods, we mortals cannot even raise our heads to resist. The only thing we could do is lament our luck for the calamity that would soon fall upon our heads, which is something that we have no control over.”

Emperor Leonidas sighed. “I guess, my grandson-in-law just acquired an entire Empire for himself. I just don’t know if he will be able to hold on to it for long.”

“Well, since he will be my daughter’s husband in the future, it is best to keep the good things within the family,” Empress Andraste smirked.

The two rulers exchanged a knowing glance at each other. Neither of them had any intention of handing the Elun Empire to the Holy Order of Light, which had plans to claim the territories that were once conquered by the Demon Army.

Right now, the Kingdom of Zabia and Slovell Kingdom were being argued over by the Alliance. Some of the Kings near the two kingdoms insisted that this would be their compensation for helping the war.

However, Emperor Leonidas and Empress Andraste knew that no matter how much the Kings and Emperors argued with each other, the one who would have the last laugh would be none other than the Holy Order of Light and not them.

This was also why the Emperor and Empress of the two Empires that sandwiched the Elun Empire decided to help the Half-Elf become the new Emperor of the territory that had lost its ruler.

“Both of you are right. Good things must be kept in the family.”

An old man holding the hand of a red-headed girl walked up to the two sovereigns with a smile on his face.

Emperor Leonidas and Empress Andraste could tell at a glance that the old man was a scammer and immediately raised their guards up, just in case the old man tried to scam the two of them.

Seeing their guarded expressions, James laughed before introducing himself to the two.

“The name is James,” James stated. “James Von Ainsworth. I am William’s Grandfather and current Head of the Ainsworth Family. Simply put, William’s best interest is my best interest. Since we are all part of the same family, we should discuss our family’s interests together.”

Immediately, Emperor Leonidas and Empress Andraste looked at the old man as if he was their best friend that they hadn’t met for a very long time.

All three smiled at each other because just like James had eloquently had stated, William’s best interest, was also their best interest.

Eve looked at the three adults with a curious gaze. Although she didn’t understand what the three of them were talking about, she had a feeling that all three of them were up to no good!

While the three powerful people chatted with each other, the Pseudo-Gods under William’s command were on high alert.

The Four Pseudo-Gods that belonged to the Holy Order of Light, and the one Pseudo-God that belonged to Hestia Academy had stopped several miles away from the Capital City of the Elun Empire.

These Five Pseudo-Gods hovered in the air as they observed the Pseudo-Gods that belonged to William’s group.

“Should we hit them?” Loxos asked. She was feeling annoyed because one of the Gods had a long distance ability that allowed him to spy in their location.

“No,” Titania replied. “However, if they advanced even a meter away from their spot, feel free to fire at them.”

With William’s absence, she became the commander of the Pseudo-Gods under William’s command. As a Fairy Queen, she was well versed in deciding important matters that involved her own interest.

“Okay!” Loxos pumped her fist excitedly as she gazed at the Pseudo-Gods in the distance. The young lady who seemed to be in her early teens was raring to open fire at the Pseudo-Gods who was starting to get into her nerves. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

The reason why Loxos was feeling fearless was due to their advantage in numbers. She would never dare to provoke the other group of Pseudo-Gods if their own numbers were smaller than them.

Fortunately, the Pseudo-Gods belonging to the Holy Order of Light kept their distance, and didn’t provoke the other Pseudo-Gods whose strength was not to be taken lightly.

This tense standoff continued for four hours before the Pseudo-Gods belonging to the Holy Order of Light left the scene, leaving a disappointed Loxos behind.

“Have you confirmed that there are no traces of Felix and Ahriman in the Elun Empire?” the Pope asked.

“Yes,” The Pseudo-God replied. I made an intensive observation and only the Prince of Darkness’ forces remain in the capital city of the Elun Empire. Also, the armies of both the Kraetor Empire and the Amazon Empire are stationed just outside the city walls. It is safe to assume that the Prince of Darkness has won the battle.

“However, we cannot confirm if Felix and Ahriman’s Avatar are still alive. It is highly possible that they managed to escape.”

The Pope tapped her finger over her desk as she stared at the floating round mirror in front of her.

“How about the Prince of Darkness?” the Pope asked. “Have you seen him?”

The Pseudo-God shook his head. “No.”

“Do you think he is injured?”

“I don’t have enough evidence to reach that conclusion. Also, even if the Prince of Darkness is indeed injured, it is impossible for us to launch an attack in the capital.”

The Pope frowned after hearing the Pseudo-God’s words because this particular individual was known for being a strategist in the Heavenly Domain.

“Are they that formidable?” The Pope asked.

“Formidable is an understatement,” the Pseudo-God replied. “I’m afraid that even if you use the Celestial Raiment to call upon a God from the Temple of the Gods, it would still not be enough to beat the Prince of Darkness.”

“Can you tell me why you say that?” the Pope inquired. She was curious what kind of existence was present in William’s camp that could match the power of the Goddess of Faith, who would descend with most of her powers intact.

“Let’s just say that I saw an old familiar face in the Capital City,” the Pseudo-God replied. “As long as he is there, we cannot act rashly because that person is known for his unscrupulous methods.”

Although the person the Pseudo-God saw had a different face, the presence residing in his body was something that he couldn’t possibly forget.

In truth, the Pseudo-God was just making an excuse.

Although the old coot was now weaker than him because he had lost his Divinity when he died, he still didn’t want to fight James, whom he once served as the mighty All Father of Asgard, and protector of the Nine Realms.
