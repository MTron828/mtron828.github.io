Chapter 17: Guests From Afar [Part 1]

As William and Ella neared their estate, they noticed a luxurious carriage in the distance. He had never seen a carriage like this in Lont, so he assumed that they were having guests from outside their border.

Right beside the carriage was a six-meter tall creature. This beast had the head and wings of an eagle, and the body of a lion. It was very easy for William to identify this creature that came from myths and legends.

“A Gryphon,” William muttered as Ella stopped in front of the beast to give it a better look.

The Angorian Goat raised her head and stared at the Gryphon. The Gryphon stared back. William could see the disdain in its proud and sharp eyes. It was as if the two of them were just mere insects passing through and not worthy of its attention.

“Let’s go, Mama,” William said as he caressed Ella’s neck. “It’s just an overgrown Birb.”

“Meeeeeh.”

“It’s not a Bird, Mama. it’s a Birb.”

“Meeeeh?”

“A Birb is what you call a bird that is having an identity crisis.”

The goat looked at the Gryphon one more time before nodding her head. She agreed with William that this creature was not a bird, but a birb. Since it was a birb, she didn’t have to bother with trying to figure out why it had legs instead of talons.

Clearly, this bird was having an identity crisis.

The goat looked at the Gryphon with pity before walking towards their house.

“Meeeeh.”

“I agree, Mama. This birb is truly pitiful.”

The Gryphon was a very intelligent creature. Naturally, it understood William and Ella’s conversation and it made it very angry. If not for the fact that it was tied to the carriage, it would have already trampled the two insects who dared to look at it with pitiful eyes.

With a belly filled with anger, the Gryphon gave a deafening shriek, but William and Ella didn’t even bother to give it a second glance. They were more curious about who their guest was. Since they rode such an amazing carriage pulled by a Gryphon, their identity would surely be not ordinary.

“Grandpa, I’m back!” William shouted as he opened the door.

“Meeeeeeh!” Ella also announced her arrival which made those who were currently sitting at the living room look at them in surprise.

There were three people who were seated at the couch, and four were standing behind them. The three were wearing elegant clothes, while the four men behind them were wearing light-armors.

James, Mordred, and Anna, sat across from these guests. William noticed that his grandfather’s expression was indeed not very good. He could feel the barely restrained anger that was threatening to explode at any moment.

“William, please, take a seat,” Anna said with a smile. “These guests came from the Dutchy of Griffith.”

Anna’s tone was polite, but William couldn’t feel any semblance of respect in her voice. It was as if his aunt didn’t treat these people as guests, but pests who came into their territory.

Mordred cleared his throat and introduced the guests one by one.

“This lady is the Duchess of Griffith, Lady Agatha,” Mordred said with a smile. “And this lovely young girl here is her daughter, Lady Rebecca.”

He then shifted his gaze at the beautiful woman who was wearing an elegant light-blue robe. Her cold features and chilling gaze would make anyone lower their heads in submission.

“This lady is one of the elders of the Misty Sect, Lady Eleanor.” Mordred grinned. “They came from far away just to see you, William.”

“Oh?” William raised an eyebrow and appraised the guests one by one.

The Duchess of Griffith had long light-brown hair, and green eyes. She could be considered a beauty, but the obvious displeasure on her face made William think of an old witch who was out to give little kids poisoned apples. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Her daughter, Rebecca, on the other hand, made William’s eye soften. Although he wasn’t completely sure, he guessed that her age was almost the same as his. Her short light-brown hair that barely reached her shoulders looked as smooth as silk.

She had the same light-green eyes as her mothers, but compared to the old hag, her eyes were bright and clear. Her cute and adorable lips were poised in a smile that made her already beautiful face, very charming.

William sighed at the doll-like girl in front of him. He had no doubt in his mind that if he were a lolicon, he would have already locked her up in his room and treated her like a pet.

As for the cold beauty who was staring daggers at him, William didn’t even spare her a second glance. Although she was beautiful, the boy could tell that she was the embodiment of bad news.

“Good day to all of you,” William greeted with a smile. “My name is William Von Ainsworth, Will for short, and the most handsome ten-year-old boy in the Central Continent. I dare say that you won’t find anyone more handsome than me. As for the other boys in the continent…”

William curled his lip in disdain. “All of them can just fight for second place.”

After William’s shameless declaration, the room suddenly became silent. Even the scowling old hag and the cold beauty looked at William with dumbfounded faces. This made the smirk on William’s face widen. Clearly, he was very satisfied with this result.

The silence was suddenly broken by a boisterous laughter that came from James.

“Hahaha! As expected of my Grandson!” James clapped his hands. The anger that he had been bottling up completely evaporated into thin air as his eyes turned into crescents. “Worthy of being an Ainsworth!”

William flipped his hair and flashed a dazzling smile. He also gave the little doll a “I know you like me” expression.

Because he had just come from the pasture, William’s clothes were dirty. His face was dusty and his red hair was a mess. Even so, his green eyes-that were as clear as emeralds-made the little doll, Rebecca, raise an eyebrow in acknowledgement.

‘This should be enough for a first impression,’ William mused. ‘If I’m not mistaken, this little loli should be my fiance. As expected of Gramps, he really did a good job.’

William found Rebecca to his liking and gave the young girl two thumbs up in his heart. The boy knew that, in a few more years, this little doll would grow up to be an outstanding beauty. Marrying someone like her wouldn’t be a bad idea, as far as William was concerned.

However, before he could even imagine his rose-colored future, the old hag opened her mouth and broke William’s daydream.

“Since you are already here, let us get right down to business,” Agatha said in a mocking tone. “We came here to break the marriage agreement between my daughter and this unworthy boy who is covered in filth!”
