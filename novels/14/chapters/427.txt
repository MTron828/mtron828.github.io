Chapter 427: Killing Two Dumb Birds

“Achoo!” William sneezed and immediately the Yin Yang Cauldron started to shake. “Oh! Fck!”

William hurriedly teleported inside the Dungeon of Atlantis before throwing the contents of the Yin Yang Cauldron at a squad of Syokois that could be found on the Seventh Floor of the Dungeon of Atlantis.

The colorful fishmen, that were a meter tall and carrying small spears, turned into a pool of goo as their bodies melted in green acid.

William looked at this scene with a grim expression as the cloud of green smoke disappeared from the point of impact.

[ Gained Exp Points: 1,500 ]

‘That was close,’ William thought as he patted his chest.

The system had automatically switched his Job Class to Wind Mage so that the Experience Points wouldn’t be wasted. The Alchemist and Blacksmith Job Classes didn’t gain experience from killing monsters. They only grow stronger by crafting and concocting.

William was currently experimenting with how to create a powerful acid that could melt rare metals. Although he was not aiming to create an acid strong enough to melt Adamantium, he was planning to create something close to it.

Right now, the Rainbow Birds’ main arsenal were the Magic Missile Lollipops. After William had upgraded his Main Job Class, and added two members to his Familia, the King Chess Piece had unlocked a new ability that benefited his King’s Legion.

It was none other than the Equip ability.

What kind of ability was this? Just like the name suggested, it allowed William’s Herd, and King’s Legion, to equip themselves with items. They could also store these items in a special space that belonged to them.

Currently, all of the members of William’s Legion are able to equip three items. Each item should not surpass five-meters in length and width. This was a great boon to William’s private force because this allowed them to carry weapons, ammunition, and other miscellaneous items in their own personal storage.

This personal storage could be summoned at will, anytime, anywhere, which made it a very useful ability.

After learning about this new feature, William thought about giving the Angray Birds some Acid Bombs that could potentially wipe out a group of people using powerful acid, even if they were wearing armor.

William’s Alchemist Job Class was currently Level 10 and he could only upgrade it by doing alchemy. He also didn’t have any ingredients for the Acid Bombs he had in mind, so he was just tossing things inside the cauldron and seeing what stuck.

The main ingredient for the acid bombs were William’s Green Lollipops. Since he had no idea what to use to strengthen the effect of the Acid Lollipop, the Half-Elf decided to purchase several gallons of Acid from the God Shop.

The Acids that William bought were…

-

Hydroiodic Acid

Hydrobromic Acid

Perchloric Acid

Hydrochloric Acid

Sulfuric Acid

p-Toluenesulfonic Acid

Nitric Acid

Chloric Acid

-

God Points: 692

-

These were some of the acids that came from William’s world. Ten Gallons of each acid only cost One God Point. Because he could buy it cheaply, the red-headed boy bought ten gallons of each type of acid to aid his experiments.

Since William had no idea of what he was doing, he decided to just mix them all together and see what was going to happen!

“200 mL of Hydroiodic Acid, Hydrobromic Acid, Perchloric Acid, Hydrochloric Acid, Sulfuric Acid, p-Toluenesulfonic Acid, Nitric Acid, Chloric Acid plus the Lollipop is enough to wipe out a party of Syokois, but it is too unstable…”

(A/N: mL are Milliliters. 1000 mL is equivalent to 1 Liter.)

William rubbed his chin as he looked at the pool of goo in front of him.

Syokois were fish-type humanoids that inhabit the Sixth and Seventh Floor of the Dungeon. This was the latest Floor that William’s Army had conquered. According to the System, there was a Boss every five floors of the Dungeon, so William’s Legion was working hard to find the passage that would lead them to the lower floors.

Est, Ashe, Wendy, Ian, Dave, and Conrad had also joined the expedition team to train themselves for the upcoming battle that they would face. Since Dave and Conrad were part of William’s King’s Legion, they were now also able to gain Experience Points to strengthen themselves at a faster rate.

The two teenagers didn’t understand what was happening to them, but they could somehow feel that their bodies and techniques were getting stronger with each monster that they killed.

Unfortunately, Est and Isaac weren’t able to gain this ability to be able to benefit from the Experience Points. William solved this matter by giving them several High-Grade Beast Cores to help them increase their ranks after battling inside the dungeon to their heart’s content.

Although they were being left behind by the others, Est, and Isaac didn’t feel troubled by it. Of course they were a bit jealous. However, knowing that their comrades at arms were getting stronger was a good thing for them as well.

“Should I lessen the quantity of each acid, or should I just use two to three types of acid at a time?” William muttered as he poked the pool of acid on the ground with a stick.

“Syokois are Class D (Low) Beasts and don’t wear armor, so I can’t tell if this is a success or not.” William narrowed his eyes. “Lily’s acid can’t melt steel, but if I condense twenty lollipops into one, they would be able to do that. However, I can only create a few of them if I go with this route. It is not enough to equip the Angray Birds…”

William was so lost in thought that he didn’t notice that someone had already approached him from the back.

A pair of soft and delicate hands covered his eyes and a teasing tone whispered in his ears.

“Guess who?”

William smirked internally as he decided to play along with his lover.

“I wonder who this is? Based on how soft the hands are, I’m sure they don’t belong to Wendy,” William said as if he properly assessed the pair of hands that blocked his vision. “Her hands are very rough and could even be used as a brush to wash clothes. This pair of hands definitely doesn’t belong to her.”

A snort reached William’s ears before the pair of hands that blocked his eyes disappeared. However, they went straight to the Half-Elf’s ears pulling them hard to the side.

“M-Mercy! I was just joking!” William hurriedly held the hands that were pulling his ears. “Such delicate and beautiful hands, how could they possibly be used as a brush for washing laundry? I’m sure they belong to the most beautiful lady in the Southern Continent. None other than my First Wife, Wendy Cy Armstrong, who will soon be called Wendy Von Ainsworth!”

“Hmp!” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Wendy finally let go of William’s ears and crossed her arms over her chest. She eyed her boyfriend who was rubbing his ears and looking at her with a face filled with injustice.

“Will, I want to ask you a question,” Wendy said with a serious expression.

William noticed the seriousness in Wendy’s gaze so he decided to stop joking around and looked at her with a calm expression.

“Ask.”

“I want to hear an honest answer from you.”

William nodded. “Be at ease. I swear upon my handsome face that I will give you an honest answer.”

Hearing her lover’s promise, Wendy walked up to him and wrapped her arms around William’s body as she stared straight into his eyes.

“Who do you love the most between the three of us?” Wendy asked. “Est, Ashe, or Me?”

“Of course I love you most,” William answered in a heartbeat. “Afterall, you are my First Wife.”

Wendy felt relieved because he could see the seriousness in William’s eyes. She then rested her head on his shoulders and smiled sweetly.

It was at that moment when two Rainbow Birds circled above their heads.

Suddenly, two familiar voices reached their ears.

“Will. Whom do you *hic* love the most? Is it Wendy, Est, or Me?” the Red-Colored Bird asked, perfectly replicating Ashe’s drunken voice.

“Of course I love you the most,” the Blue-Colored Bird replied, perfectly replicating William’s voice.”

William’s body stiffened when he heard this exchange. Beads of sweat started to form on his forehead as he cursed the two annoying birds who just dropped a bomb over their heads.

“Really? Are you telling me the truth?” the red bird asked.

“Yes.” the blue bird replied.

Wendy giggled as she looked at the two birds in the sky.

“Those birds are quite lovely,” Wendy said. “They can even imitate voices. Did you teach them to say those things?”

“Y-Yes,” William replied. “I was trying to teach them how to talk, so I made them speak these lines.”

“How interesting.”

“R-Right?”

Suddenly, Ashe, Est, and Isaac appeared beside William and Wendy.

“So, this is where the two of you are,” Est said. “We just found the path that leads to the Eighth Floor and we are planning to explore it. I came to find Wendy, but I didn’t think that you’d also be here, Will.”

William gave Est a thumbs up in his heart for her impeccable timing. With this, he would be able to wiggle himself out of this mess…

But then, the two Rainbow Birds raised the volume of their voices as they circled around Ashe, Est, and Isaac.

“Will, I want to ask you a question,” the Blue-Colored Bird said using Wendy’s voice.

“Ask.” the Red-Colored Bird said using William’s suave voice.

“I want to hear an honest answer from you.”

“Be at ease. I swear upon my handsome face that I will give you an honest answer.”

If earlier, only beads of sweat formed on William’s forehead, now, a river was flowing freely. Wendy also tilted her head to the side as she heard the familiar conversation of the two birds circling around them.

“Who do you love the most between the three of us?” the Blue Bird asked. “Est, Ashe, or Me?”

“Of course I love you most,” the Red Bird answered in a heartbeat. “Afterall, you are my First Wife.”

After saying those last words, the two birds flew away like their lives depended on it. William had summoned Stormcaller and was about to unleash a Lightning War Art in order to erase the two troublemakers from the face of the Dungeon.

‘Motherfckers! After all I did for the two of you,’ William gnashed his teeth in anger as lightning swirled around Stormcaller’s body. “Lightning God War Art…”

“Will, what are you doing?” Wendy’s icy gaze made William completely stop from continuing his attack.

“Wendy, I’m just training my skills by killing two dumb birds. I mean, practicing my technique using those two birds as my targets,” William replied. “It is better to hit moving targets, don’t you think?”

“Mmm, this is true.” Wendy nodded her head. “However, I’d like for you to answer a question from me first.”

“I have a question, too,” Ashe said as she lovingly held William’s right arm in a tight grip. “You will answer this question of mine, yes?”

“Will, me, too,” Est said as she walked towards William with the “You’d better fess up or you will regret it” glare.

Wendy had already grabbed William’s left arm in a vice-grip that wouldn’t lose to her Valkyrie Form’s arm lock.

Isaac, who was standing at the side, turned her back towards the four of them and looked at the sky.

‘Rest in peace,’ Isaac said internally. She knew that blood was about to spill and she had no intention of preventing it from happening.

“G-Girls, listen to me,” William said with a face filled with righteousness. “This is just a misunderstanding. Allow me to give the three of you a proper explana—Ahhhhh!”

That day, a loud scream rang out on the Seventh Floor of the Dungeon of Atlantis. It was the sound that was similar to a pig being slaughtered and it traveled throughout the entire dungeon, allowing everyone to hear it.

William’s Herd, Legion, as well as Dave and Conrad, heard William’s dying screams. Just like Isaac, they lit a candle in their heart and prayed for the Half-Elf who was currently being murdered by three beautiful ladies by his side.
