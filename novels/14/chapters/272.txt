Chapter 272: I Can’t Believe We Did Thirty Rounds

When William opened his eyes, something golden appeared in his line of sight. Soon, the sound of a soft and steady breath of a sleeper reached his ears.

He was still not fully awake, but he did recognize the girl that was within his embrace. It was at that moment when images of passionate love-making filled his head. William’s body stiffened and all the drowsiness that was still lingering in his body, disappeared completely.

Slowly, but surely, William disentangled himself from the blonde beauty in his embrace. He then looked at Wendy with a serious expression and noticed a few things that made him sigh in relief.

‘It was just a dream,’ William thought as he patted his chest in relief.

Wendy was still wearing her school uniform, and her youthful face showed that she was still in her early teens. The red-headed boy wasn’t able to stop himself from comparing the young and beautiful Wendy, to the curvaceous adult Wendy in his dreams.

‘In a few years, she will definitely make the heads of every man turn towards her,’ William mused as he brushed away the lock of hair that had fallen over her sleeping face.

He had turned the protection of his dormitory room to its highest setting which made it impossible for anyone to leave the room without his permission. William still remembered Carter’s order to Wendy to meet him last night, so the Half-Elf locked her inside his room to prevent her from sneaking off towards the Professor’s residence.

Although the system had said that the spell had been completely wiped away from her Sea of Consciousness, William didn’t want to take any chances and took the matter into his own hands.

He then asked the system to do one final check on Wendy’s body to see if there were any anomalies.

[ Host, all the parameters on Wendy’s body and Sea of Consciousness are all normal. There are no side-effects from the Mind Weaver Spell and there is no chance for it to work on her in the future. ]

‘Good. Thank you.’

[ You’re Welcome. ]

After the system had made its report, William once again looked at the girl who was sleeping peacefully on his bed. Once again, he was reminded of the “love making” that he had done with the adult Wendy in his dreams.

‘I can’t believe we did thirty rounds,’ William covered his face that had turned red from embarrassment. ‘This won’t do. I need to cool myself down.’

The Half-Elf left the bed and headed straight into the bathroom. For some reason, he could still feel the lingering warmth of Wendy’s body and it was making his own body heat up.

William was a healthy fourteen-year-old boy. Having that kind of dream, and waking to see himself embracing a beauty in his arms, it was impossible not to have any kind of reaction. Little Wiliam was already rearing his head as if he was prepared to fight for another thirty rounds.

William didn’t know if he should laugh or cry that his dependable “Junior” had awoken its eagerness for a night battle.

Soon, the sound of running water could be heard from the bathroom as William soaked his body with cold water. He hoped that it would be enough to drive away the sudden heat that had awakened inside of him after ascending the steps of adulthood… inside his dream.

Wendy slowly opened her eyes the moment William entered the bathroom. It didn’t take long before her entire face turned a shade of red as she recalled the dream she had. In her dream, she watched as her adult self and the silver-haired William made love to each other.

‘I can’t believe they did it thirty times,’ Wendy thought as she rolled on top of the bed. It was her first time seeing the actual deed and it made her face blush in shame and embarrassment.

After rolling for a few more times on top of the bed, the blonde beauty hugged William’s pillow and wondered if the boy she liked would be able to accomplish the same feat that the silver-haired William had done in her dreams.

She knew that William had no intention of doing those things to her at this point in time because they were still too young, but her heart wouldn’t stop beating wildly inside her chest. Wendy didn’t want to admit it, but she felt envious of the adult Wendy in her dreams.

‘She looked so satisfied afterwards,’ Wendy thought with a reddened face. ‘I wonder if I’ll have the same face after Will finally decides to embrace me.’

Inside Carter’s Room…

Carter was finalizing the plan he had concocted after realizing the limitless potential that was hidden in William’s body. His desire to obtain this new vessel made it become his top priority.

After taking control of the Knight Commander’s body, he would marry Wendy, Charlotte, Annie, and two more noble ladies in the Hellan Kingdom and build his influence. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

He would stage an act on the day of the Inter-Division Battle where “he would die” under the Knight Commander’s hand. Carter needed to do this in order to fool the Demon General that was his superior.

He would then take his time to train his new abilities, as well as his brides, and slowly chip away at the power of the King of the Hellan Kingdom through schemes and deceit.

Afterwards, he would stage a civil war, and crown himself the new King. “Carter” believed that it would only take him ten years at most to put this new plan into motion. By then, he would have mastered the powers in William’s body and taken over the entire Southern Continent.

By then, he would no longer need to take orders from anyone. He would be the supreme ruler of the entire continent and everyone would bow under his feet.

A few hours ago, he felt that the control he had over Wendy disappeared completely. It surprised him at first, but he soon accepted this outcome. For someone that had God Essence inside his body, it was very possible for him to erase the spell that had been planted within Wendy’s Sea of Consciousness.

This discovery didn’t make Carter feel anxious. There was no way for anyone to know that the spell originated from him. He had ensured that the spell couldn’t be traced back to him.

This was why he was confident that William wouldn’t become suspicious of him.

After his connection to Wendy was cut, Carter immediately formulated a new set of plans in his head. Although he would have to do it in a roundabout manner, he was confident that he would succeed in luring William to his location.

He had many pawns in his hands, so he was not worried that he would run out of subordinates to carry out his orders. First, he would conduct a massacre in order to create a diversion. Then he would lure the boy to a safe location and deal with him there.

He had done this countless times in the past, and he was confident that he would succeed this time as well. He had taken over the bodies of individuals far stronger than William, but he had never taken over a body with a God Essence inside it.

The thrill of conquest made him feel anxious and excited at the same time. Anxious because he didn’t know what to expect, and excited because he was confident that even though there were unknown factors, he was still confident that he would be able to take over William’s body using the methods he had developed over the years.

‘William Von Ainsworth,’ Carter thought. His eyes glinted in delight for the future that was laid out for him. ‘Enjoy the last few days you have in this world. For they will soon come to an end.’

He was confident that with the preparations he had planned, William’s body was already as good as his.
