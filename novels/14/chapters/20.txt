Chapter 20: William’s Compromise [Part 2]

William froze when he read the notification. It took him a few seconds to regain his composure and immediately chose Yes as his answer.

“Times up,” Rebecca announced as she snatched the Magic Staff from William’s hands. “Your half a minute has passed.”

William was still in a daze. He hadn’t heard Rebecca’s words because he was busy inspecting the new job class that he had acquired.

-

[ Congratulations! Host has acquired the Ice Mage Job Class. ]

[ Ice Mage Job Class has been automatically added to the Subclass Category. ]

[ Ice Mage ]

— A magician that specializes in Ice Magic

— Increase resistance against cold.

[ Host has learned skill: Ice Bullet ]

‘Fck! I got a new job class just by holding a staff?!’ William’s heart was thumping wildly inside his chest. He had often wondered how he could acquire a subclass. Never in his wildest dreams did he think that acquiring a new job class was this easy!

William’s shocked expression made Agatha and Eleanor look at him in contempt. The two older women thought that the boy had been shocked due to how expensive the magic staff was.

‘How ignorant,’ Agatha thought.

‘Country bumpkin,’ Eleanor mused.

Mordred who was seated by William’s side frowned. He could see William’s hands trembling and wondered if he should step in to save his nephew.

“D-do you guys have other expensive items?” William stuttered. “It’s the first time I held something so amazing in my life. If you are able to show me at least five items of the same quality, I will agree to annul this arranged marriage.”

“Only show you?” Agatha asked. “You’re not going to take it?”

“I won’t take it,” William answered while keeping his excitement at bay. “I just want to hold it just like I did with that staff.”

“If we do this, will you really agree to cancel the marriage agreement?” Eleanor inquired. This was the reason for their visit. If she could make the boy write a letter to renounce the agreement then the old Duke wouldn’t be able to find anything amiss.

“Yes. however, it should be of the same quality or higher,” William answered. “I will not accept cheap items!”

Agatha and Eleanor exchanged a glance and nodded at the same time. They retrieved the most expensive items from their storage rings and piled them in front of William.

The boy looked at all the treasures in front of him and his eyes sparkled in excitement.

The items that Eleanor presented were all magic staffs of the different elements. Since she was a Sorceress, all her treasures belong to the magic type category.

William’s breathing became heavier with each item he held in his hands. His eyes also became bloodshot which made Eleanor very happy. She thought that the boy had finally realized that he was a frog at the bottom of the well.

‘A frog that is trying to eat a swan?’ Eleanor laughed inside her head. ‘See the difference between our social standing! It’s time to wake up from your daydream you country bumpkin.’

After William finished inspecting the magical weapons that came from Eleanor, he shifted his attention to the weapons that came from Agatha’s collection.

William’s body shuddered in ecstacy. His breathing had now become ragged, as if he was about to faint anytime due to exhaustion.

“William, are you alright?” Mordred asked. He was very worried about his nephew’s current condition.

“I-I never felt better in my life,” William replied hoarsely. He took a step back and almost collapsed on the couch. Fortunately Mordred was paying close attention to him and was able to support his body on time.

“Are you satisfied?” Agatha asked. “Will you honor our agreement?”

“Y-Yes,” William replied. He still hadn’t recovered from the euphoria that he had felt earlier. “I will agree to the cancellation of this marriage agreement.”

“We need you to write a letter, and it must have your signature as well,” Eleanor interjected. “It’s not that we don’t trust you, but this thing must be properly recorded.”

“Understood.” William nodded and asked for paper and ink.

He then wrote a letter saying that he didn’t agree to the arranged marriage that was made between his gramps and Rebecca’s grandfather. The reason he gave for the cancellation of the marriage agreement was due to Rebecca being not good enough for him.

He stated that since he was the most handsome boy in the continent, it was only natural that he be paired up with a girl that had the beauty to topple nations. Also, he was not optimistic about Rebecca’s growth in her chest area.

William felt that the girl would only have a B-Cup when she reached adulthood. He even politely added that he could consider making Rebecca his concubine if his main wife agreed to accept her into his harem.

When Agatha and Eleanor read William’s letter, both of them almost spat out a mouthful of blood in anger. William had listed a series of complaints as to why Rebecca was not worthy to become his fiance and not the other way around!

Agatha even had the impulse to rip the little bastard to shreds in order to eat his flesh and drink his blood. She had never felt so angered in her life and it almost drove her crazy.

“Since I have written the letter then all of you should leave,” William shooed the pests away. “Don’t tell me you plan to stay to have dinner with us? Well, I guess we can spare you some porridge since the Ainsworth family has a big heart. I don’t want any rumors flying around that we didn’t treat our guests properly.”

Agatha dragged her daughter towards the front door because she was afraid that, if she stayed a second longer, she would hack the little bastard into pieces.

Eleanor also left without saying anything, because she had never experienced humiliation like this in her life. She was the elder of the Misty Sect and was treated with respect wherever she went.

She cursed William in her heart and even decided to take revenge in the future. Rebecca hadn’t seen the contents of the letter and obediently followed her mother back to the carriage. She thought that William was an interesting boy, but not worthy enough to become her fiance.

If Rebecca only knew what the “interesting boy” wrote in his letter, she might have summoned her staff and used it to beat the crap out of him until he shed tears of blood.
