Chapter 499: A Man That Didn’t Deserve To Be Loved

Finally, after half an hour of bombardment, Ezkalor, Eneru, Nalzrig, and Zyphon joined the fray and cast High-Level spells that made things difficult for Ezio. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

They could have swarmed in using their overwhelming numbers to overpower the defenders, but after the Kraetor Empire’s interference, the High-Level officers of the Elven Army decided that they should conserve their manpower just in case the Young Empress changed her mind and attacked them from behind.

Soon, one of Drauum’s Giant Boulders landed squarely against one end of the City Walls, destroying it completely. The Elves didn’t rush in immediately, but continued their bombardment. King Minos was greatly disappointed by the Elves’ cautiousness because it prevented him and the Minotaurs from fighting them in close combat.

He thought that the Elves would swarm the destroyed wall and use it as an entrance, but they seemed to really want to create as many gaps in their defenses as possible, which made the King of Minotaurs helpless.

“Hah, what a bunch of cheapshots,” the teenager with light-blue hair commented as he crossed his arms over his chest.

“Winning without losing a single soldier is also a strategy,” Nero stated. “However, although it looks so one-sided right now, the Elves are also exhausting a lot of magic power to continue this bombardment. Even their Guardians are aiding them in this war.

“You can even say that the Defenders have made them realize that they were not an easy bone to chew. I guess this could be counted as a victory for the Defenders, albeit a useless victory.”

The teenage boy still wasn’t convinced and voiced his opinion. “Isn’t this what they call bullying?”

The purple-haired lady by his side chuckled. “It is the advantage of the strong. Even the Kraetor Empire would be bullied if it was weak. Why wouldn’t you use superior power to suppress a weaker opponent? That will just be wasting your advantage.”

Empress Sidonie had a calm expression on her face as she listened to the Protector’s argument from the side. She planned to make her move at the last minute and be a heroine in William’s eyes.

This way, not only will the boy feel indebted to her, the Hellan Kingdom would also owe her a favor. A simple strategy to profit in a war that she could easily end with a few words from her luscious lips.

Seeing that many portions of the wall had been laid to waste, Elandorr finally gave an order to advance.

A powerful roar came from the Wolf Riders as they stormed towards the gaps in the walls to enter the city.

Drauum, Eneru, Ezkalor, Nalzrig, and Zyphon had taken humanoid forms and advanced as well. The moment they entered the city, they immediately heard intense fighting between the two sides.

The Super Soldiers and Ash Golems rampaged and fought the invaders head-on. The Minotaurs were also at the midst of the battle, and their weapons were all stained with Elven blood.

Drauum smashed a super soldier’s body and turned it into meat paste when it blocked its way. It had only traveled halfway into the city when a fist appeared out of nowhere and sent him flying towards the city gates.

King Minos materialized out of thin air and glared at the Ancient Golem.

“Let’s finish what we started yesterday,” King Minos declared. “Of course, if you are scared, feel free to run away.”

Drauum stood up from the rubble and sneered at the King of the Minotaurs. “I’m not afraid of livestock.”

“Good.” King Minos summoned a golden plated War Axe that was inscribed with magical runes. “Breaking you will not be fun otherwise.”

The two powerhouses charged at each other and collided in one powerful clash. King Minos fought Drauum in the middle of the City in order to involve the invaders in the destruction that they were causing.

Because of this, the Elves were forced to steer clear and make detours off to the sides to prevent themselves from getting caught in the crossfire.

Past the Center of the City was where the other members of the Minotaur Race were hiding to ambush the Elves. Est and the others were with them, as well as the remnants of the Freedom Fighters.

The moment the Elves got past King Minos’ slaughter zone, they immediately stepped into action and fought in close combat.

Thor, Ragnar, and Dia transformed into their Centennial Forms. Wendy, Ashe, and Est mounted them and fought bravely, alongside their allies.

Empress Sidonie, who was watching the battle inside the city using a crystal ball, gazed at Wendy who she had recognized as William’s lover. However, she frowned when she saw the beautiful girl with light-blue hair that was seated on top of a three-headed Beast.

She didn’t recognize who she was, but she had a feeling that she had met her before. Also, her womanly instincts were telling her that the girl and William may have a close relationship.

[ Another rival has appeared? ]

Morgana chuckled inside Empress Sidonie’s mindscape. She eyed Ashe with genuine interest and wondered if William had already made her his woman.

[ Well, you should add her to the list of people that you will save. Maybe Darling will become so indebted to us that he would give me- I mean, give us his babies. ]

‘I’m still more beautiful than her,’ Empress Sidonie stated with confidence.

[ Of course you are. We are the most beautiful girls under the heavens. It doesn’t matter if there are a few more love rivals along the way. In the end, the one who Darling will love the most will be us. ]

Empress Sidonie nodded her head. ‘How about that handsome boy riding on that golden winged serpent? If I’m not mistaken, he is also Sir William’s best friend.’

[ Right. We should add him to the list as well. The more the merrier. ]

The Young Empress and her devilish Big Sister didn’t care if Wendy and the others were hurt during the battle. The only thing she cared about was that they stayed alive. As long as they still had a breath of life in their bodies, she would be able to save them.

Saving a person that was about to die was vastly different from saving someone that was not in danger. The more dangerous the situation, the higher the rewards that could be redeemed would be.

[ Still, just where is Darling? Did he really go away just like Conner mentioned when he jumped to our side? ]

‘I’m sure that he will appear sooner or later,’ Empress Sidonie replied. ‘He would not leave his lovers alone to fend for themselves. He is not that kind of person.’

[ True. ]

Empress Sidonie and Morgana had an unwavering faith that William wouldn’t leave his loved ones behind. Although both girls didn’t want to consider the possibility of William escaping all alone by himself, they didn’t dismiss it completely.

Both of them vowed that if the man they loved were truly that kind of person they would do everything in their power to capture him at all cost. Then, they would torture him and cut his limbs off one by one.

A man who could toss away the people who truly loved him was scum. Empress Sidonie and Morgana despised these kinds of people.

A man like that didn’t deserve their love.

A man like that didn’t deserve to be loved.
