Chapter 135: Bruiser of Ancient Power

Est, Ian, and Isaac made their way towards the Martial Class Division. It was not only them, but several others from the Magic and Spirit Class Divisions were walking in the direction of the House of Heroes.

Every year, the nobles belonging to these Divisions would look for capable subordinates that they could recruit under their wing. This had been a tradition in the Royal Academy, and the instructors allowed it.

Most of those who belonged to the Martial Class were commoners. Some of them wanted to be employed by nobles in order to live a better life. Since that was the case, the Royal Academy didn’t prevent this recruitment from happening.

The only thing they could do was to ensure that the ones recruited from the Martial Class would be treated well by their employers.

“Isn’t that Ella?” Isaac asked as he pointed at an Angorian Goat standing beside a delicate looking boy with silver-gray hair.

“That is indeed Ella,” Est agreed. “Let’s go.”

The three boys walked towards William’s second mother with curious faces. Ella had noticed their arrival and bleated softly in greeting.

“Hello, are you looking after Ella?” Est asked the gray-haired boy beside the goat. “We are William’s friends and we came here to see if he participated in the competition for the Head Prefect. My name is Est, Est Wells Newmont.”

Est extended his hand for a handshake. The silver-gray haired boy looked at the offered hand and reluctantly raised his own.

“Kenneth,” Kenneth introduced himself. “Kenneth Xin Ashleigh. I am William’s roommate.”

“Nice to meet you.” Est nodded his head and ended the handshake. He then appraised the young boy in front of him.

“Please, don’t stare at me too much,” Kenneth said as he took a step back. “I feel uncomfortable when people stare and crowd around me.”

“Sorry if I offended you.” Est apologized. “I was just curious because you are William’s roommate.”

“I-I’m not offended.” Kenneth averted his gaze. “It’s just that, this was the second time that someone took the initiative to shake my hand. My first time was with William.”

The atmosphere immediately became awkward because Est didn’t know how to continue the conversation. In the end, he decided to look at the viewing crystal in front of him and see what the red-headed boy was up to.

“What is he doing?” Ian asked as he tilted his head in confusion. “Why is he sitting on a log and whistling using a leaf instead of collecting points? Doesn’t he know that you need to collect points in order to become the Head Prefect?”

“Perhaps he is waiting until the last day before he makes his move?” Isaac proposed. “A day inside the Enchanted Forest is equivalent to eight hours out here in the real world. The competition has just begun, so there is plenty of time for William to make a comeback.”

“Even so, why is he looking so carefree?” Ian frowned. “It makes me want to punch his face.”

Est, Kenneth, Isaac: …

“Meeeeeeeh!” Ella lowered her head and pointed her horns in Ian’s direction.

“I-It was just a joke! I was just joking, Ella,” Ian immediately pacified William’s second mother. He had forgotten how overprotective Ella could be when it came to the annoying red-headed boy.

“Meeeeeh!”

“Okay, I won’t mention it again.”

“Meeeh.” Ella raised her head and returned her attention to her baby.

Ian patted his chest in relief because he knew how deadly Ella’s horns could be in a real battle.

The Angorian Goat had spent a lot of time with William and knew what he was thinking. Although the four children around her didn’t know what his plans were, Ella realized it the moment William sat on the log and started to use the leaf to whistle.

Ten minutes later, the “four boys” noticed a single deer move towards William’s location. It sniffed the air as if trying to smell if there was any danger that lurked around it. After confirming that there wasn’t anything that could threaten it around, it walked unhurriedly towards the boy that was sitting on the log.

This deer was one of the White-Tailed Deer that inhabited the Enchanted Forest. When it was only four meters away from William, it started to make mewing sounds as if talking to him in their language.

To the children’s surprise, William made the same mewing sounds as the deer. They watched in amazement as the two conversed with each other.

William conversed with the deer for two minutes before he stood from the log he was sitting on. The White-Tailed Deer then started to walk towards the Eastern side of the Enchanted Forest and William followed behind it.

After half an hour of walking, William arrived in a clearing surrounded by lush grasses beside a river. There were hundreds of White-Tailed Deer grazing upon the grass and all of them raised their heads when they sensed the new arrival.

William’s eyes fell upon the giant white deer at the center of the herd who was looking back at him with a calm countenance. The giant deer was over four meters tall, and its majestic antlers shone like a sharpened blade as the light of the sun fell upon its regal splendor.

The red-headed boy then used his appraisal skill to understand more about this proud creature who was an Apex Beast within the Enchanted Forest.

‘As expected. It is strong,’ William thought as he read the description of the Spire.

The sea of white-tailed deer parted as the Spire walked towards William. The Alphas of the herd walked alongside it. Although these Alpha Deer’s threat levels were only at the D Grade, William didn’t dare underestimate them because they had the advantage of numbers.

Even so, William wasn’t afraid. He didn’t come here for a confrontation. He came to ask a favor.

‘Speak, what is your reason for coming, Shepherd?’ the Spire said in a commanding tone. It was talking to William using telepathy and this act caught the red-headed boy by surprise.

‘You can talk? You also know that I’m a shepherd?’ William asked. ‘How?’

‘I don’t always try to ‘talk’ with humankind. However, I made an exception just for you. As for your other question, do you really not know, or are you just pretending that you don’t know?’ the Spire asked back. Its tone was laced with disbelief. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

‘You, who have been touched by the Eternal Guardian God of the Herds, should know why we are having this conversation. If not for this, I would have already killed you.’ the Spire added in a firm manner.

William scratched his head. He was unaware that his Shepherd Job Class wasn’t as simple as he thought it was. He already had his suspicions when he saw that certain creatures that belonged to the herd category could be added to his own.

After he heard the Spire’s comments, he now believed that his hunch was spot on.

‘I will ask you again, Shepherd,’ the Spire lowered its head and stared William straight in the eyes. ‘What is your purpose for coming here?’

William decided to come clean and state his purpose for coming. ‘I came to ask for a favor.’

‘A favor?’

‘Yes. there is something that I need to ask from you, Mighty Guardian.’

The Spire eyed William before reluctantly nodding its head. ‘Speak. I want to know what kind of favor you would ask of me, Shepherd.’

William took a deep breath before saying what was on his mind.

‘I humbly ask that you allow me to…’
