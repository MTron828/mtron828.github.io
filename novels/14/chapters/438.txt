Chapter 438: Confrontation At The Gate Of Beginnings [Part 1]

“Is that the gateway that leads to the Labyrinth of the Minotaur Race?” William asked as he looked at the gigantic gate that was forty-meters tall and twenty meters in width.

“Yes,” Erchitu replied with pride. “That gate is called the Gate of Beginnings. It is the gate that leads to the labyrinth where the Minotaur Race has built their sanctuary.”

(A/N: William and Erchitu are talking to each other through telepathy.)

Erchitu was ten meters tall. It was as big as the Diabolical Hell Ape, and the Ourobro, Lufie, that protected the Town of Lont…

The gate was four times its size. It was large enough for King Kong and Godzilla to pass through without any problems.

“Um, is King Minos forty meters tall?” William inquired.

Erchitu shook his head. “King Minos is only half my size, but even ten of me would not be able to be his match.”

“He’s that strong?”

“Naturally. He is afterall, our Sovereign.”

William nodded his head in understanding. If he was able to gain the help of the Minotaur Race then fighting against the Elves would be easier. However, this could not be done at this point in time.

A powerful seal had been placed on the Giant Gates and no one could open it from the outside. Even if one were to use powerful spells and strong physical attacks, the gates wouldn’t budge nor would it be destroyed. That was how powerful the enchantments on it were.

After several attempts, the Elves decided that there was no use in trying to destroy the gate and massacre the Minotaur Race while they were weakened.

They left the Gate of Beginnings alone as they focused on stabilizing their control over the Zelan Dynasty.

Suddenly, William’s System informed him that several presences were headed in his direction. The Half-Elf casually opened his map and saw thousands of red dots encircling his position.

“Erchitu, they are here,” William said as he gazed at the forest in the distance.

The Giant White Ox turned his head to look in the direction where William was looking at and nodded.

Five minutes later, a handsome Elf with long blonde hair and gray eyes walked out of the forest alone and looked at William in disdain.

“Who are you and what are you doing in the territory of the Elves?”

“I am your father. Don’t you even know your father’s name?”

Elandorr narrowed his eyes at the filthy Half-Elf who dared to taunt him. Just like his father, the young commander of the Elves hated Half Elves. For him, they were a stain in the bloodline of their race and must be purged from the face of the world.

“So, you’re not going to name yourself?” Elandorr asked. He eyed William as well as the Giant White Ox beside him.

William smirked as he used his appraisal skill on the arrogant Elf who was scanning his surroundings to see if there were any traps or ambushes that waited for him and his Elven Elites.

“Since you want to know my name so badly then allow me to introduce myself,” William replied as he flipped his hair in an arrogant manner. “I am the son of Lady Arwen, the Saintess of the World Tree, and the Savior of the Elven Race, Maxwell Von Ainsworth.”

William paused as he raised his chin arrogantly, “My name is William Von Ainsworth.”

Elandorr frowned as he appraised the Half-Elf in front of him. Princess Eowyn had approached him a few days ago and informed him that the son of the Saintess was a citizen of the Hellan Kingdom. She had also told him William’s name and described his facial features so Elandorr half-believed the Half-Elf’s declaration.

Murmurs started to spread among the Elves hidden in the trees. There had been rumors that their Saintess, Lady Arwen, had given birth many years ago, but there had been no proof of this claim whatsoever.

This matter was only known to the Elders and Patriarchs of the Elven Clans. This was also why Arwen made the hard decision to call for her husband’s twin, Morgan, and have him take William with him back to the Southern Continent.

Not all the Elves looked at her son favorably. Some of them even want to take his life. In order to guarantee his safety, Arwen gave birth within the Aenarion Family’s Hidden Domain, where none of the other Elves were allowed to set foot.

The Elven King also helped shield Arwen and her child from pursuers and even secretly assigned Royal Guards to escort Morgan back to the Southern Continent. Because of the Elven King’s protection, those who wished William dead had no choice but to abandon their plans.

They didn’t dare provoke both the Elven Royal Family and the Aenarion Family, who was the current head of the Elven Council. Because of this, William had safely departed the Silvermoon Continent and left alone to live in Lont ever since.

“Oh? So, you’re telling us that you’re the son of our Saintess? Do you think I’m a fool?” Elandorr snorted. “The Saintess never had a child. You dare to slander her good name? You’ve got guts, you filthy half blood!”

William chuckled. “So, this is how you repay the son of your savior? I thought the Elves were a righteous and proud race. I didn’t know that they were a bunch of hypocrites.”

“Taunt us all you want, but we will not believe your lies,” Elandorr replied.

Even if William was the real son of their Saintess he wouldn’t acknowledge it. In fact, one of the missions given by his Patriarch was to kill William the moment he saw him.

“Wait.”

A soft voice called out from within the forest. Soon, a beautiful Elf with long, honey-blonde, hair and blue eyes stepped out of the forest and looked at William with a curious glance.

“Are you the Knight Commander of the Angorian War Sovereign?” Princess Eowyn asked.

She had also been part of the emergency meeting and decided to come along with Elandorr on this operation. The Sword Saints that guarded her stood behind her back as they, too, eyed William with curiosity.

“Yes.” William nodded. “Have you heard of me?”

Elandorr stepped in front of Princess Eowyn and blocked William’s line of sight.

“How dare you be rude to our Princess?!” Elandorr shouted. “Kneel and show your respect to the Princess of the Elves. Only then will I show you mercy and let you keep your dog’s life.”

William shook his head as he looked at Elandorr with a fed-up expression.

“Didn’t your Mama ever tell you to not butt in when two people are talking?” William asked. “Or are you telling me that you have no Mama? Sucks to be you then.”

Elandorr wasn’t someone that was easy to provoke. The reason he was preventing William from talking to the Princess was because he wanted to eliminate the Half-Elf as soon as possible. If Princess Eowyn acknowledged him as the son of their Saintess, it would be very difficult for him to kill William in front of the Elven Army.

“I’ve had enough of your nonsense!” Elandorr raised his hand and gave the signal to attack. “Kill him! Protect the princess!”

Several whistling sounds erupted from the forest, as all the Elves unleashed their arrows. Elandorr was their Commander, and their patriarchs had told them that his word was law. Also, the Princess was only a Supervisor on this mission, she didn’t have the authority to order any of the Elves, aside from her entourage, from following her.

“And so it begins,” William said softly as a fearless smile appeared on his lips. “Erchitu, are you ready to rumble?” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Erchitu snorted and stood in front of William. The two of them didn’t come here to talk. They came here to beat the crap out of the Elves and make them understand that there were some people that they shouldn’t provoke, no matter what.
