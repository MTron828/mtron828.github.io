Dense smoke obscured everyone's view as the Loxos unleashed Hell on Earth using the crystal statues, combined with the Dark Flames of Sepheron and the Fiery Red Flames of Ifrit.

Everyone watched with bated breath, as they waited for the smoke to disperse, allowing them to see the destruction that the Nymph had done to the Army of Destruction.

Suddenly, from within the dense smoke, a loud laughter emerged.

Strong gusts of wind blew the smoke apart, making everyone's faces turn grim after they saw the outcome they didn't want to see.

Standing at the center of the Army of Destruction was a giant who had the body of a Lion, the wings of an Eagle, and the head of a Demon with horns.

In the Giant's left hand, he held a mace with a Lion's head on it, in his right, he held a green sword that seemed to reek with deadly poison.

Although Loxos' all out attack did indeed kill some giants, she was only able to kill a few thousand of them, which was a very miniscule number from the million-strong army that Nergal had brought with him to Hestia.

"Nice try, little Nymph," Nergal chuckled as his demonic eyes fixed on Loxos who was looking at him in disbelief. "Did you really think that a little Pseudo-God like you can contend against a God? You must be out of your mind."

The Kings, as well as their armies, who thought that they had finally gained the upper hand in battle felt their skin crawl as they gazed at Nergal's true form, which was truly horrifying to look at.

"Everyone, don't be intimidated!" Loxos shouted. "Let's do it one more√¢‚Ç¨""

Loxos wasn't able to finish her words because she suddenly found herself unable to move her body properly. A moment later, she coughed, and blood spilled from her red lips, making her feel as if her strength was being drained from her body.

It was not only her that felt that way, the other Pseudo-Gods as well as the mortal armies all coughed blood. A moment later, they were having difficulty moving their bodies, as if they were slowly becoming paralyzed.

"Oh? So it finally kicked in?" Nergal asked in a teasing tone. "Do you really think that I, the God of Pestilence and Diseases, was only creating ordinary bugs to play with you lot? The insects that come from within my body create powerful toxins, and spread it through the air with their wings.

"However, no need to worry. It is not fatal. What it does is weaken the body and cause paralysis. That way, I can better enjoy the desperation on your faces as I tear you all apart."

The God of Pestilence and Diseases made a gesture and the Army of Destruction charged towards the weakened mortal armies, creating a one-sided slaughter.

"Hah... what a wonderful sound," Nergal laughed as the sound of screams spread throughout the surroundings as the armies tried to defend themselves from the Giants' advance. "As for you, my little pet, come!"

Nergal made a pulling action, creating a powerful gust of wind, pulling Loxos towards him.

Since the young Nymph's body was paralyzed, she was unable to do anything but stare helplessly at the God of Destruction who wanted to cause harm to her.

However, before Loxos was grasped by the sadistic God, William appeared and caught his wife, taking her to safety.

Nergal frowned because he could tell that William wasn't affected by the poison that was spread throughout the surroundings.

"I see, so you must be that William boy that Ahriman is talking about," Nergal commented as the corner of his lips rose. "I guess I'll give you to him as a souvenir, so he can have his revenge."

Nergal wasn't really worried about the Half-Elf not being affected by the poisonous spores that had been released by his insects. This was not the first time it happened, and there were many defenders in the worlds that he had destroyed who had the same ability.

As the God of Pestilence and Diseases, he had more horrifying ways to make his targets die a very slow and painful death.

However, before Nergal could even unleash his contagion in the battlefield, the sound of a horn reverberated in the surroundings.

High above the tower of the Ainsworth Palace, the white-robed woman blew Gjallarhorn, making every member of the alliance hear it.

Soon, they found themselves not only regaining their strength, but the paralyzing effect on their bodies also disappeared completely, allowing them to counterattack the Giants who had decimated tens of thousands of warriors in their weakened state.

"That horn...," Nergal narrowed his eyes as he looked at the woman on top of the tower. "I know that horn."

The woman stopped blowing the horn in her hands and sneered at the God of Pestilence and Diseases.

"As you should," the white-robed woman said in a teasing tone. "How can you possibly forget the horn that made your prized plagues and poisons lose their effects on the battlefield?"

Nergal scoffed because he found the woman's words laughable. So what if he couldn't use his poisons? He was still a God and no one in the World of Hestia was his match.

The God of Destruction raised his lion-headed mace high in the air and summoned dark-green clouds that reeked of deadly poison. Although the effects of Gallarjorn was preventing the poison from affecting anyone, all he needed to do was kill its owner, and the horn's protective effect would disappear as well.

"Playtime's over," Nergal stated as he aimed his poisonous blade at the white-robed woman in the distance. "Time to send you to hell. Die!"

A green beam of light erupted from the tip of the sword that flew straight towards the white-robed woman in the distance.

William immediately flew between the green beam of light and the white-robed woman as he summoned one of the very first weapons he used in the world of Hestia.

"Illuminate the World!" William roared as he pointed his weapon towards the beam that was about to hit him.

"Rhongomyniad!"

A dazzling white light shot out from the tip of the spear and collided against the attack that came from the God of Pestilence and Diseases.

The seven tablets rotating around William glowed brightly, empowering the radiance that was being emitted by the spear that was also capable of purifying anything in its path.

"Not bad, Half-Elf," Nergal commented as his attack was dispersed by William's counterattack. "But, do you have what it takes to fight me?"

William gazed at the God of Destruction fearlessly before giving his reply.

"I don't have what it takes to fight you," William replied, "but he does."

"He?"

"Yes. He."

Suddenly, thunder roared in the heavens, and white lightning snakes across the sky. The dark-green cloud that hung above the sky was changed into dark storm clouds, whose rage was starting to surge.

One of the Giants that was about to smash the Humans in front of him into meat paste, was suddenly blown away by a wooden mallet that smashed his face, sending him flying backwards.

The mallet continued its trajectory and smashed the giants along his way, allowing the members of the alliance to gang up on them and deliver deadly blows to their bodies.

As the Wooden Mallet smashed anything and everything in its path, a voice filled with determination echoed within the battlefield.

"Bring in the hammer to sanctify the bride,

On the maiden's knees let Mjolnir lie."

A teenager, with long blonde hair, and buffed body walked towards Nergal with steady steps.

In the depths of his blue eyes, a spark of lightning emerged, making his eyes glow with power as the weapon that had accompanied him over the past two years answered his call.

Thunder roared in the sky, and heavenly lightning fell across the land, hitting the Giants and making them scream in pain.

In the past, he was just a chubby teenager with no redeeming qualities, but then he had met William's familiar, Elliot, and the latter became his Master, teaching him how to wield his powers.

"From the Heavens I can hear Mjolnir's Roar..."

The young man stated as he raised his right hand in the air, as if waiting for something.

From somewhere far away, a metallic hum was heard, answering his call. A moment later, the Wooden Mallet dove down from the sky and fell into his hands.

"And in the Thunder I can feel...," the young man stated.

"The Heart of... Thor!"

Lightning raged across the sky, and fell upon the young man's body, bathing him in Divine Lightning.

The radiance was so bright, that it momentarily blinded the Giants that surrounded him, and a powerful shockwave blasted them all away, clearing the space hundreds of meters around him.

When the light receded, the young man's long hair and red cape fluttered in the breeze.

Thunder roared in the Heavens answering their Lord's summons, making the Army of Destruction know that HE had appeared to join the battle.n√äw stùíêries at nùíê/vel/b/i/n(.)coùíé

His name was Thorfinn.

Elliot's disciple and the new rightful owner of Mjolnir and, right now, he was very angry.

William smirked as he looked at the young man who had trained tirelessly day and night over the past two years, until his chubby body disappeared, and was replaced by a strong and sturdy body that was able to contain the power of the God of Thunder.

A strength that made the Half-Elf feel nostalgic, as he thought about the great battle of the distant past.

"You're mine!" Thorfinn growled before he stomped his right foot on the ground, flying towards the God of Destruction, and making the entire battlefield tremble in his wake.
