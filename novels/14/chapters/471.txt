Chapter 471: I Need No Introductions [Part 1]

A faint breeze blew into the night, as William stood on top of a mountain. His clothes fluttered in the darkness, unseen by the two moons and the stars that were currently out of sight.

Two hours before midnight. A time when the common people were already asleep, and only those who did night activities were awake.

William’s green eyes glowed in the darkness as he surveyed the land. As a Half-Elf, seeing in the dark was as natural to him as breathing.

“Heroic Avatar,” William said softly as a great power surged inside his body. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

This was the second time that he had used this ability after returning from the Temple of the Ten Thousand Gods. When he was in this form, he felt that the world was within his grasp. It was quite unfortunate that limitations had been placed on this ability, otherwise, William would have already stirred up a storm within the Zelan Dynasty.

He plucked up a few hairs from his head and lightly blew on them, sending them flying in the breeze.

A moment later, seven clones who looked exactly like him landed by his side. Each of them pulled out a small golden-metallic-rod from their ears, which increased its size until they became as long, and thick as William’s wooden staff.

Each of them pointed their staff in different directions. Their targets were the four Teleportation Gates that were nearest the border of the Hellan Kingdom.

“”Blitzer Railgun!””

Inside the Zelan Royal Palace…

“Tomorrow, the vanguard will start their advance,” Elandorr said as pushed a golden Elven Knight Chess Piece forward, using a customized wooden rake, on the map in the center of the conference room.

According to our estimate, it will take us three days to reach the Azure Fortress. From there, we can use the Human’s Teleportation Gate inside the fortress, to speed up our conquest of the Hellan Kingdom.

(A/N: Azure Fortress is the name of the Fortress that James defended.)

“According to our scouts, who have infiltrated the Hellan Kingdom, the majority of their forces are holed up in the City of Gladiolus,” Elandorr reported. “They seemed to have accepted their inferiority and decided to make their last stand at the Hellan Kingdom’s Capital.”

The Patriarchs and other High Ranking Officers of the Elven Army nodded their heads. Although their reinforcements had arrived from the Silvermoon Continent, Elandorr retained his position as the Commander of the expedition. Meaning, he had complete command of the three-million Strong Elven Army.

With such a powerful army at his disposal, only the Kraetor Empire remained a threat to them within the Southern Continent.

Also, aside from the Elven Reinforcements, one more Guardian from the Silvermoon Continent appeared to aid them. It was none other than the Golden Elder Dragon, Ezkalor.

Two Peak Myriad Beasts, and one Pseudo-Demigod. They were the trump cards of the Elven Army.

Because of these Three Guardians, that would serve as the overseers of the Elven Conquest, the Patriarch’s and the Elven Officers felt at ease. This was also why they allowed Elandorr to keep his rank as Commander, and allow him to command the Elven Reinforcements.

With such powerful beings by their side, the conquest of the Hellan Kingdom was mere childsplay.

“I heard that you have faced the Saintess Son.”

An intimidating presence within the room asked.

“What is he like?”

Ezkalor, the ruler of the Dragons in the Silvermoon Continent, stared at Elandorr with a pressure that was enough to make the Elven Commander uncomfortable.

The Elder Dragon was currently in a humanoid form, but his draconic feature stood out among the Elves that were gathered inside the conference room.

“Did you not hear me?” Ezkalor asked because Elandorr seemed to have frozen in place after he had asked his question.

“Your Excellency, the pressure you are radiating is too much for him to handle,” Shafel stood up and bowed respectfully to the Elder Dragon.

Ezkalor frowned before suppressing the pressure that overflowed from his body.

Elandorr immediately took in a deep breath as if the invisible hand choking his neck had suddenly let go. After regaining his breath, he respectfully bowed to answer Ezkalor’s inquiry.

“I have met the Saintess’ Son in a battle near the Sanctuary of the Minotaur Race,” Elandorr replied. “I believe that he is the strongest among the prodigies here in the Southern Continent.”

“Mmm. So, you’re saying that you lost to him, right?”

“… Yes.”

Elandorr didn’t dare to lie in front of one of the Guardians that had protected the Silvermoon Continent. Also, he was afraid that the Elder Dragon would punish him due to the death of his Beast Companion, the Silver Dragon, Deoldreoss.

“How strong is he?” Ezkalor asked. “Is he really so strong that he managed to defeat not only you, but Deoldreoss as well?”

Elandorr could feel his cheeks burn due to the shame and embarrassment he was experiencing. Right now, all the High-Ranking members of the Elven Expedition were gathered, including Princess Eowyn.

“When I fought against him, he had the power that is equivalent to a Saint,” Elandorr replied. “Perhaps he used a forbidden ability to temporarily raise his strength to its limit during our fight. Because of this, my partner, Deoldreoss, met his end.”

A smirk appeared on Ezkalor’s face as he corrected Elandorr’s explanation.

“Deoldreoss is not dead.” Ezkalor stated.

Elandorr looked at the Elder Dragon in shock as he tried to feel the connection between him and his Beast Companion. However, the connection was no longer there which made him frown.

“Your Excellency…”

“He’s not dead.” Ezkalor repeated. “However, I also can’t feel his presence. It is as if he has disappeared from this world. The only thing I can think of is that he has been taken to some place…, like a Domain, that blocks my detection abilities.”

Elandorr suddenly felt hope because, if his Beast Companion was alive, re-establishing their connection was only a matter of time.

The Elven Commander thanked Ezkalor profusely for the news that he had shared with him. Ezkalor briefly nodded as he crossed his arms over his chest.

He could still remember the Human Hero, Maxwell, during that great battle against the Demon Race. It pained him that Maxwell’s son had been cast away into the Human lands, instead of being raised in the Elven Continent.

However, as an Elder Dragon, he didn’t like to interfere with the affairs of the Elves. This was why he had turned a blind eye to their schemes to invade the Human lands. The reason he had accompanied them on this venture was to personally see what kind of young man Maxwell’s child grew up to be.

‘If he is really a promising youth then I’ll choose one from my brood and make them partners,’ Ezkalor thought. ‘Doing so will also ensure his safety from the Elves. I’d like to see if any of these stuck-up Elves dare to challenge my decision.’

While Ezkalor was busy trying to find the perfect Dragon Partner for William, the door of the conference room suddenly burst open.

“Sir! It’s an emergency!” an Elven Guard looked at Elandorr with anxiousness.

“Calm down,” Elandorr ordered. “Don’t you know that this is an important meeting? How dare you barge in here and treat it as a common tavern?”

The Elven Guard finally regained his composure when he noticed the stares of everyone in the room. However, this composure lasted only for a brief moment when he remembered his purpose for coming to the conference room unannounced.

“Sir! The Teleportation Gates!” the Elven Guard said with great urgency. “Rebels are destroying the Teleportation Gates along the North-Western Border of the Zelan Dynasty! Four of the Teleportation Gates have already been destroyed, but the rebels are also attacking other places. I’m afraid…”

Elandorr’s face paled when he heard the Elven Guard’s full report. According to the Guard, a giant, golden rod, descended from the sky and obliterated the Teleportation Gates in the four cities near the Hellan Border.

“It’s him!” Elandorr exclaimed. “It’s the Saintess’ son! William Von Ainsworth!”

A peal of thunder reverberated through the skies above the Capital City of Briar Glen.

The Qilin, Eneru, immediately flew towards the North-Western Regions where William had been suspected to appear. Aside from him, no one among the Elven Reinforcements could travel great distances at the speed of lightning.

“Finally, you’ve re-appeared!” Eneru gnashed his teeth as he saw the giant golden rod Glowing in the distance. “I will not let you escape, you bastard of that Hateful God! I will tear you to shreds!”
