Chapter 537: Is This What It Feels Like To Have A Pet?

A week passed after the Assessment Test and things finally settled back inside the academy. However, after the result of the test came out, it brought an unbelievable change to a certain class of the Third Year Division.

“Look, it’s the Triple S!”

“Damn, this guys again!”

“Just because they became the top class, they started to become arrogant. The nerve of these bastards!”

Stanley, the leader of the group walked arrogantly with his head raised high. Steffan and Scott walked beside him and both of the boys were smiling.

“Do you hear that?” Stanley asked in a voice that was loud enough for the students to hear.

“I do.” Scott chuckled. “It’s the sound of sore losers.”

The students who heard their words feel indignant because the losers of the past were now strutting on their high horse.

“Shut up, Scott!” one of the students of Class C shouted. “You only got lucky because of the Princess’ Fiance! You and your class are only riding on his coattails!”

“Pffft!” Stanley sniggered as he eyed the student that was looking at them with disdain. “You don’t understand. From the very beginning this was part of our strategy.”

“What strategy?! Stop spouting nonsense!”

“That’s right! You only just got lucky!”

“If not for Sir William, all of you would still be the worst class in this grade!”

Jeers and taunts flew in every direction. The spacious hallway that led to the classes of the Third Year was now crowded with students who couldn’t accept the new status quo.

“Stanley, let’s not waste our time on these sore losers.” Scott chuckled. “This is why they will never raise their ranks. All of them are stupid.”

“What did you say?”

“You want to fight?”

“Come! Show us what you can do, you bootlicker!”

The crowd circled the three boys, but before they could do anything, a friendly voice called out from behind the crowd.

“Good morning, Everyone. What is all the commotion?” William asked as he looked at the crowd that was blocking his way.

Chiffon was standing beside him, while licking a lollipop.

Everyone immediately recognized him and made a path for him to walk through. After the Assessment Test, William had become the idol of the Third Year Division. The girls adored him, and the guys wanted to be like him.

Although he was not part of the Royal Family, or a member of the nobility, right now, William’s Status in the Academy wouldn’t lose to the Princes’ of the Kraetor Empire.

“Sir William. These Mofos are saying that Class F’s rise in the ranks is due to their strategy. They’re lying, right?”

“Sir William, I really admire you, I really do, but these bastards are taking credit for all of your hard work. It irritates me!”

“Yes. They even act as if they were the ones responsible for bringing Class F to the top!”

Several more complaints were hurled in William’s direction. A few minutes later, the Half-Elf raised his right hand to tell everyone to stop.

“They are telling the truth,” William stated. “If not for Stanley, Class F would not be in the spot we are now. It was all thanks to him that everything turned out the way it did.”

Everyone shifted their attention to the good looking boy, who seemed to be waiting for this exact moment.

Stanley flicked his light-brown hair with his hand and sighed. “This is what I’ve been trying to tell them, but they wouldn’t listen.”

Scott, the chubby boy shook his head helplessly as he scanned the faces of the crowd that had surrounded them from all sides.

“Sometimes, the truth is hard to believe, but it is still the truth,” Scott said sagely. “Even if Sir William managed to gain nearly Seven Million Points, that would not be enough for an entire class to reach the number one spot.”

Stanley nodded his head. “This is what you call Team Effort. We just played our role to ensure that all the classes wouldn’t know the plan we had decided on beforehand.”

Steffan, who was just listening at the side, was looking down at his shoes. He didn’t dare raise his head because he was afraid that he wouldn’t be able to keep a straight face from all the b*llsh*t that his two close friends were saying.

“That’s right. It was a Team Effort,” William agreed as he walked towards his three classmates.

He walked while holding Chiffon’s hand because he wanted everyone to change their opinion of the little girl whom they had labeled Trash Eater.

Because everyone was focusing on William, they didn’t notice the little girl that was by his side. Only after they had regained their senses did they recognize the pink-haired girl whom they had mocked and ridiculed behind her back.

“Sir William, why are you with the Trash Eater?” One of the boys from Class D asked. “Who knows what she ate for breakfast? Maybe she just went to the Garbage Dump to eat some rotten food that the kitchen had thrown out.”

“Someone like her is not worthy to be by your side, Sir William,” a pretty girl stated. “Having her around will only dirty your good name.”

“Trash Eater! Get away from Sir William!”

The students shifted their attention on the pink-haired girl whose body trembled from their piercing glares.

William pulled her close to him in a protective embrace as he glared back at those who were ridiculing his ward.

“From this day onward, let it be known that this girl will be under my care,” William declared. “She will no longer go to the Garbage Dump to eat, nor will she sleep in the stables. So, please, Everyone. Stop calling her Trash Eater.” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

The students glanced at each other and looked back at Chiffon with a complicated gaze. Her head was currently buried in William’s chest, and the Half-Elf could feel something wet and warm staining his clothes.

William’s arms held the fragile girl in his embrace as she cried silently. His heart ached because Chiffon was such an adorable and loveable girl. For her to suffer this injustice, due to the sin she carried, left a bitter taste in William’s mouth.

“Everyone, what’s going on here?”

Professor Ewan, the Homeroom Professor of Class F, parted the sea of students that were littering in the hallway.

“Classes are about to start,” Professor Ewan announced. “Please, return to your rooms and wait for your professors.”

The students gave William, and the little girl in his embrace, one last glance before returning to their rooms. Soon, only William, Chiffon, and the Triple S remained in the hallway.

“Let’s go to our room,” Professor Ewan stated. “Mr. Ainsworth, I don’t mind if you come a bit late, but make sure to come to class. Do you understand?”

“Yes. Professor.”

“Good.”

Professor Ewan herded the other three boys into the classroom, while William patted the head of the crying girl who was hugging him tightly.

“It’s fine,” William said softly. “They will change their minds soon. Chiffon is so cute and adorable, I’m sure that after a month or two, people will start to approach you to become your friends.”

“I don’t need friends,” Chiffon replied. “I just need Will, Ian, Sidonie, B1 and B2. I don’t need anyone else.”

William’s hand that was rubbing Chiffon’s head stopped when he heard the little girl’s reply. Him, Ian, and Princess Sidonie were understandable. However, what surprised him was that Chiffon thought of B1 and B2 as friends.

Sensing the hand that was patting her head had stopped, Chiffon raised her hand and grabbed it. She then made the motion of patting her head, using William’s hand.

The Half-Elf’s heart almost melted due to Chiffon’s cute gesture, so he immediately returned brushing the little girl’s head until she finally calmed down.

‘This is bad,’ William thought. ‘Is this what it feels like to have a pet?’

He had never had a pet before, but being around Chiffon was like taking care of a small adorable pet that followed him around.

Ten minutes later, William and Chiffon entered their classroom. The stains on his uniform had already been dried using Magic Power. He had also used his handkerchief to wipe the tear stains off from Chiffon’s face and used a bit of water magic to wash them away.

Ian had returned to Class A to watch over Princess Sidonie. Her birthday was only ten days away, and the celebration would be held in Silverwind Academy’s Grand Ballroom.

Originally, it was supposed to be in the Royal Palace. However, after thinking things through, Emperor Leonidas declared that his granddaughter would be celebrating her birthday in the Academy.

Professor Ewan stood in front of everyone and made an announcement.

“Everyone, ten days from now, we will celebrate Princess Sidonie’s birthday party here in the Academy,” Professor Ewan explained. “I want all of you to be on your best behaviors. I know that your heads are in Cloud Nine right now due to our current Rank. However, remember that we will not always be at the top.

“Arrogance without the strength to back it up will only cause your downfall. Remember that what goes around, comes around. Don’t wait for the time when your arrogant words will be sent right back into your faces.

“This is true, especially for both of you, Stanley and Scott. I’ve been getting several complaints in the Staff Room. The two of you better behave, or else…”

Professor Ewan smiled, but his eyes screamed of murder. Stanley and Scott immediately nodded their heads in understanding.

William shook his head helplessly because what Professor Ewan said was true. The entirety of Class F had suddenly become arrogant after becoming the Top Class in the Third Grade Division.

The students of Class F had been bullied many times in the past. After having a taste of success, they suddenly felt like they were superior to others. It made them feel that they now had the qualifications to return the favor to those that had wronged them.

However, this would not be good in the long run.

‘Fear leads to anger. Anger would lead to hate, and hate would lead to suffering,’ William thought as he remembered the quote he once had seen in a movie back on Earth.

While the Half-Elf was in the middle of his thoughts, Professor Ewan continued his explanation.

“A month and a half after Princess Sidonie’s Birthday, the Silverwing Tournament will begin,” Professor Ewan announced.

“As you may already know, the winner of this tournament will have one of their wishes granted by the Emperor. This is not compulsory. Those who want to register for the tournament, make sure to tell me a week before the tournament starts.”

Professor Ewan scanned the crowd. His gaze lingered at William for a few seconds before looking at the other students of his class. Right now, all the Professors in the Academy had their eyes on William.

He was currently the Dark Horse in the tournament, and everyone wanted to see the power of the teenager, who was now hailed as one of the strongest students in Silverwind Academy.
