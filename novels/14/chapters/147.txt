Chapter 147: Might Over Magic [Part 1]

Edward appraised the beautiful girl in front of him from head to toe. He really liked Priscilla’s beauty and the cold and fearless gaze that she was giving him.

It made him want to defeat her, so that he could make her his subordinate. For some reason, there was something about her eyes that made him want to break her until she willingly knelt in front of him and declared her undying loyalty for his cause.

He then gripped his staff and started to channel his magic power in preparation for their battle.

“Are both of you ready?” Layla asked.

Priscilla and Edward nodded their heads in unison.

“Very well.” Layla nodded. “Battle Start!”

Edward immediately unleashed a storm of wind blades that headed towards Priscilla without mercy.

The girl archer simply lowered her body and dashed to her left to evade the overwhelming attack. Edward sneered because he had already anticipated this move coming from her. He then activated the spell that he had prepared beforehand.

Earth Spikes protruded out of the ground and they appeared in the direction where Priscilla planned to make her escape.

“Dual Element Affinity. Not bad,” Grent muttered as he watched the battle. “At least he has the ability to back up his arrogance.”

Even Layla who hated Edward’s arrogant attitude had to admit that he was a very talented mage.

“Earth and Air? What a weird combination.” Andy commented as he looked at the black-haired-girl who seemed to be at a disadvantage. “Even so, it is far from enough to defeat her.”

As Andy said these words, Priscilla stomped on the ground and jumped high into the air. She then fired three consecutive arrows that flew in an elegant arc towards the handsome boy who still had a confident smile on his face.

Edward waved his hand and a barrier made of wind surrounded him. He thought that it was enough to block Priscilla’s futile attempt at a counter-attack.

The moment the arrows touched the barrier, they exploded into dazzling flashes of light that blinded Edward, which made him lose his concentration.

“This move.” Spencer winced. How could he possibly forget the move that Priscilla used on him during the battle at the Coliseum.

The string on Priscilla’s bow glowed as she fired another arrow the moment she landed.

Edward knew that he was at a disadvantage so he immediately tapped the ground under him with his staff. A dome made of Earth surrounded him. It was a powerful defensive spell that could fend off most attacks as long as they didn’t exceed the caster’s magic power.

Priscilla’s arrow connected with the Earth Dome and exploded. The arrow that the black-haired-girl used was an exploding arrow that detonated upon impact. A small hole, the sizeof a basketball appeared on the dome protecting Edward.

Before the boy could cast another defensive spell, the sound of the wind whistling reached his ears. That was the last sound he heard before an arrow pierced his forehead and passed through to the other side of his head.

Edward fell to the ground, dead, and turned into particles of light. The Earth Dome disappeared and the students of the Martial Class shouted and cheered for their Vice-Prefect with all their might.

“Long live Priscilla!”

“Long live our Vice-Prefect!

Edward re-appeared on the side of the Magic Division with a dejected face. Everything happened so fast that he was unable to accept how easily he lost against a mere girl from the Martial Class Division.

“Good job,” William said as he gave Priscilla a thumbs up.

Priscilla only nodded her head before she returned to her position behind the red-headed boy.

The Martial Class students were looking at their “Warrior Princess” with admiration and respect. They knew that Priscilla was strong, but they didn’t know that she was that strong!

Est looked at Edward with a complicated expression on his face. The Head Prefect of the Magic Division Class had wanted Edward to be taken down a peg due to his arrogance. However, when it actually happened, the only thing Est felt was bitterness.

He had to admit that Edward represented the Magic Division Class. His loss was the loss of the Magic Division as a whole.

“Young Master, let me fight next,” Ian stepped forward. “I will definitely win this round.”

“Who are you going to challenge?” Est asked without looking back at his loyal retainer. The moment Ian spoke up, he already knew who Ian wanted to fight in the Martial Class.

“I’ll fight William,” Ian answered with a serious expression. “Believe in me, Young Master. I can defeat him.”

“Are you sure about that?” This time, Est turned his head to look at Ian’s eyes. “How confident are you in defeating him?”

The seriousness in Est’s eyes made Ian unconsciously take a step back. William’s “bickering buddy” wanted to say that he had a 100% assurance that he could win the battle against William. But, he knew that this was not the case.

William’s strength lay in his unpredictability. Even Ian had to acknowledge that even if he used his full powers, he wouldn’t be able to accomplish the things that William had done in the past. Ian couldn’t possibly defeat a Ruler of the Forest which was said to be, at the very least, in the middle-tier of the Grade B Threat Rankings.

“I-I will do my best.” Ian gritted his teeth and answered.

Est shook his head and faced the students of the Magic Division. “It is now our turn to issue a challenge. Who among you wants to fight?”

“I will fight,” A girl with long blonde hair that reached down to her waist walked forward.

She was one of the most beautiful girls among the First years in the Magic Division. Priscilla might be called as the “Warrior Princess” in the Martial Division Class, but this beautiful blonde girl also held a title in the Magic Division.

She was the “Steel Princess” that was said to be Impregnable.

(A/N: Men of culture, please, behave yourselves.)

“I will secure victory for our Division,” the beautiful girl stated.

Est nodded his head. “Do your best, Wendy.”

“Don’t worry, Head Prefect. Leave everything to me,” Wendy declared, but everyone could see that her cheeks had flushed a beet red while she talked to Est.

In order to prevent anyone from seeing her expression, she hurriedly walked towards the center of the Coliseum as she steadied her breathing.

When she arrived at her destination, she had already regained her calm. Her eyes landed on the handsome boy in the Martial Class who was also staring back at her.

“Big Brother, come,” Wendy said as she summoned a spear in her hand. “Show me how much you have improved after you ran away from home.”

“Looks like it’s my turn to fight,” William raised his chin in an arrogant manner as he took a step forward to fight the beauty that was waiting at the center of the Coliseum.

However, he was only able to take five steps when a hand grabbed the back of his robe and pulled him back.

“That is my little sister,” Spencer commented. “I am her twin and she is calling out to me, not you, Head Prefect.”

“What? You are that beautiful girl’s Big Brother?” William eyed Spencer from head to toe. “You don’t look alike.”

Several students of the Martial Class also nodded their heads in agreement to William’s words. Although Spencer was cool-looking, the girl’s beauty was at least two levels above him.

“I’ve been hearing that all my life.” Spencer sighed as he stepped forward. “Head Prefect, I apologize in advance.”

“Mmm,” William nodded his head in understanding. “Don’t worry. Do what you have to do.”

“Thank you.”

“Introduce me to your little sister later.”

“… No.”

Spencer stared at the face of his twin, whom he hadn’t seen for half a year. It had been that long since he ran away from home because he wasn’t able to tolerate the ridicule from his relatives. Since he couldn’t fight them due to his father’s position, he chose to run away in order to prevent both sides from having a confrontation.

“Have you been well, Wendy?” Spencer asked.

“No,” Wendy answered. “You shouldn’t have run away, Big Brother. It only made Uncle and Aunty more arrogant.”

“Let them be arrogant,” Spencer closed his eyes as if to push the negative thoughts to the back of his mind. “That is the only thing they can do. They wouldn’t dare to escalate things, or else they would not be able to handle the consequences.”

“Even so, they still irritate me!” Wendy gnashed her teeth in anger. The hands that were holding her spear were trembling due to the rage she was feeling in her heart.

“Since you already called me out, let’s just fight,” Spencer opened his eyes and summoned his own spear. “Come. show me if you have gotten stronger since the last time I saw you.”

Wendy’s blue eyes turned light-red as she circulated the magic power inside her body. The blade of her spear enlarged. Instead of a spear, Wendy seemed to be holding a giant curved dagger in her hands.

“Big Brother, I will fight seriously. You’d better not hold back.”

“Enough talk. Let’s fight!”

Spencer spun the spear in his hand as he took a fighting stance. Both combatants stared at each other as they waited for Layla to declare the start of their battle. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“Are both of you ready?” Layla asked.

“Yes.”

“Ready.”

Layla nodded and raised her hand. “Battle Start!”
