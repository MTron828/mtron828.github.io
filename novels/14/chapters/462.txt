Chapter 462: Women Held Grudges As Well

‘Drauum was right,’ Eneru thought as he readied himself to take the Elves and flee at a moment’s notice. ‘There were more than two Myriad Beasts here in the Anaesha Dynasty.’

Nero smiled as he looked at the Qilin who was trying his best to keep a calm expression on his face. They had concealed their presence in the throne room in order to protect the Young Empress just in case the Myriad Beast decided to attack the Young Empress, as well as the Officers of the Kraetor Empire.

The woman with the purple hair giggled as she winked at Nero. “He said that you’re just a little cat. Come here, kitty kitty~”

The corner of Nero’s lips twitched as he pretended that he hadn’t heard the woman’s teasing. He stared at Eneru with a serious expression, as if he was deciding what to do with him. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

When the three Myriad Beasts appeared in the throne room, Empress Sidonie regained her calm and forcefully suppressed her power, so it no longer leaked. She was still very angry, but since the Three Protectors of the Kraetor Empire had already arrived at the scene then there was no need for her to do anything anymore.

“Wait, your Excellencies,” Alessio said in order to ease the tension in the air. “This is just a simple misunderstanding. His Excellency Eneru just wanted to scare the boy because he was very arrogant in front of the Empress Sidonie. Since the boy is unharmed, can we return to our discussion on how we can form an alliance between our two kingdoms?”

The teenage boy with light-blue hair nodded his head as if agreeing to Alessio’s words. He was one of the Protectors of the Kraetor Empire and he was the Pacifist among the group. However, Both Nero and the purple-haired woman knew that once he got angry, even the two of them combined would find it hard to suppress him.

“Before we resume our discussion, the Qilin should pay an adequate compensation for his transgressions,” the teenage boy said with a kind smile. “How about you give me one of your whiskers? I am very interested in crafting a whip made from the whisker of a Qilin.”

Eneru glared at the teenage boy who wanted one of his whiskers. Qilins only had two whiskers. These whiskers grew when Qilins reached adulthood and symbolized their power and authority.

Although these whiskers would regenerate after a month once they were pulled out, it would be a very painful experience for them.

“Such audacity,” Eneru growled. “You dare mock me?”

Eneru unleashed his full power as his eyes glowed with power. However, instead of being alarmed, the three Myriad Beasts looked at Eneru as if they were looking at something amusing.

“Um? Have you regressed or something?” the teenage boy asked. “Your current strength is only at the Peak of the Millennial Rank. I thought you were a Myriad Beast?”

The teenage boy glanced at Nero who just shrugged his shoulders.

Nero’s true form was that of a White Tiger. His strength was on the same level as Eneru, so he was also surprised when he felt that the latter’s strength seemed to be lacking.

Eneru’s face paled because he had completely forgotten that he was under William’s suppression. A Millennial Beast baring its fangs against Three Myriad Beasts was just like a little puppy barking at a Tiger.

The teenage boy raised his hand and a powerful pressure descended upon Eneru, forcing him to kneel on the floor. Elandorr’s, Alessio’s, as well as the other Elves’ faces paled when they saw this scene.

Clearly, they didn’t expect their Guardian Beast to be easily suppressed by the teenage boy with light-blue hair.

“Are you giving me one whisker or should I take two instead?” the teenage boy asked in a polite manner. “Of course you can refuse. It is not in my nature to force others to obey my demands.”

Although the teenage boy said this in a polite tone, the pressure that was pressing down on Eneru intensified, making the latter’s head press down on the floor, while in a kneeling position.

Nero and the purple-haired woman didn’t say anything. If the Elves were Hypocrites then the teenage boy was the King of all Hypocrites. What he said, and what he did, contradicted each other.

The teenage boy was the black sheep in their Trinity. Nero and the purple-haired woman had long given up on trying to straighten him out.

“I am the Guardian of the Silvermoon Continent!” Eneru roared as he slowly raised his head. “You bastards dare to make me kneel and bow my head, I’ll fight all of you to the death!”

The teenage boy smiled and clapped his hands together. Eneru’s eyes rolled up into their sockets as he collapsed on the floor, unconscious.

“Violence doesn’t solve anything,” the teenage boy said in a sagely tone as he walked towards the unconscious Qilin who was still in his human form. “Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.”

The teenage boy then grabbed Eneru’s hair and dragged him out of the throne room. Clearly, he still hadn’t given up on his plans to take the Qilin’s whiskers.

The corner of William’s lips twitched when he saw the teenage boy, who was more shameless than him, yank on the hair of the unconscious Qilin as he dragged him to the exit of the throne room.

The Elves didn’t dare to voice out any kind of opposition towards the teenage boy’s actions because they knew that it was futile. Their Guardian Beast was defeated without any resistance. How could they possibly win against such a being?

“Your Majesty, His Excellency Eneru truly didn’t wish to do you any harm,” Alessio pleaded. “He just wanted to teach this Half-Elf a lesson for his vulgar words. Please, show your mercy, Your Majesty.”

Alessio bowed his head because he knew that this was the only thing he could do for now. Acting subservient was below his dignity, but he would rather lose his dignity than lose his chance of survival.

The other Elves followed suit. However, Elandorr stood straight and refused to yield. He would rather die than grovel and beg for mercy.

Empress Sidonie nodded her head in appreciation of the Elven Commander’s stubbornness. The anger she had earlier had already disappeared now that the hateful Qilin had been taken care of.

“Rest assured, although your Guardian Beast has acted out of place, I am willing to forgive him this once for his transgressions,” Empress Sidonie said. “His life, and all of your lives, will be spared. However, remember that this will only be a one time thing. If this happens again in the future, I will no longer show any mercy. Do I make myself clear?”

“Yes, Your Majesty,” Alessio answered on behalf of the Elven Delegation. “It will not happen again.”

Empress Sidonie nodded and raised her delicate hand. “Let’s resume our discussion. What can any of you offer to make me agree to an alliance? You should know that if I want to conquer the entire continent, it would be as easy as snapping my fingers.”

The beautiful Empress lifted her slender leg and crossed it over the other, as she rested her face on her right palm.

“Give me your best offers,” Empress Sidonie said with finality. “This will be your last chance to get on my good side.”

Elandorr and William briefly glanced at each other before looking back at the beautiful Empress sitting on the throne.

The two Protectors of the Kraetor Empire stood by the side as spectators. They also agreed that taking over the continent was a risky move that could backfire on them. Nero was quite impressed that Empress Sidonie was someone who could see the bigger picture.

Now that she had given Elandorr and William an ultimatum, it was up to them to decide whether The Kraetor Empire would become their enemy, or their ally.

However, the two Protectors, as well as Prince Jason, Evexius, and the rest of the High-Ranking Officers of the Kraetor Empire was not aware that, even before the Elves and William had arrived at the capital city of Veritas, the beautiful Empress had already made her decision.

Morgana had also approved of it, and promised to work with Empress Sidonie to see her plan come into fruition. The two beautiful girls giggled within their shared mindscape, as they watched the handsome Elf and Half-Elf take their time to think of an offer that would please her.

The two sinful girls were also vain creatures. They liked it when handsome men did their best to please them, especially when one of these handsome men was someone who had firmly rejected her twice.

William was not the only one who held grudges.

These two women held grudges as well.
