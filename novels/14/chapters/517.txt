Chapter 517: You Are Now In My Home Turf

“Okay, introduce yourself,” an old man with glasses made a gesture for William to step into the podium.

“Good morning everyone,” William said with a smile. “My name is William Vo-“

“We already know who you are.” a boy with freckles on his face cut William off before he could even finish his introduction. “You are Princess Sidonie’s lover, right? Man, I’m so jealous of you.”

“How far have you gone with the Princess? Have you already done this and that?”

“Can you teach us the way on how to be popular with the girls?”

“Hey, is it true that the Princess has a weird hobby?”

“What food does she like to eat?”

William was immediately bombarded from all sides. The teacher who had asked him to introduce himself to his classmates was already dozing off in his chair. Clearly, the professor had no intention of teaching and planned on sleeping from the start.

The corner of William’s lips twitched as the questions rained on him non-stop. He had already expected that he would be thrown to the worst class, but from the looks of the facilities inside the room, it was not as bad as he thought it would be.

To his surprise, Class A, and Class F, didn’t have any differences when it came to the quality of the room. It seemed that the SIlverwind Academy was an academy that didn’t look down on its students. They just divide them based on their performance, which made William’s impression of the academy rise by a good margin.

A mischievous idea came to the Half-Elf’s mind as he raised his hand to silence his classmates who seemed hell-bent to know some juicy gossip.

“I have heard all of your questions, and I’ll answer them to the best of my abilities,” William said with a smile that wouldn’t lose to his Grandpa, James, when the old coot was about to scam people.

“First you asked what my relationship is with Princess Sidonie? The answer to this is that she is my lover.”

A low murmur erupted in the classroom as the Third Year Students talked to each other. William smiled as he continued with his plan to stir some trouble for the nobles that had sent him to the worst class among the Third Year Division.

“You ask me what the Princess’ favorite food is? The answer to this is simple,” William flipped his hair and raised his chin arrogantly. “What she likes to eat the most is me. Just make sure not to tell anyone, okay?”

William winked at his classmates as if they were trustworthy people that could keep a secret. The boys turned green with envy, while the girls blushed in embarrassment because they somewhat understood what William was hinting at.

“As for the secret on how to be popular with the ladies, the answer to this is very simple as well.”

The boys perked up their ears as they focused their attention on William. If he could tell them how to have a beautiful girlfriend they would worship him to the high heavens.

The girls, on the other hand, were also very curious on what William was going to say next. They wanted to know if the Half-Elf really knew what attracted the ladies to men.

“The secret on how to be popular is not really a secret,” William said as he placed both of his hands to his hips. His chin was raised in arrogance like a Young Master looking down on his servants.

“What you need is confidence. Girls like confident men. Even if you are not born as handsome as me, if you know how to carry yourself, the girls will be attracted to you.”

The teenage boys glanced at the ladies in their class and saw them nodding to William’s words. This made them realize that what the Half-Elf was saying is true.

The atmosphere inside the room became more lively as William interacted with his new classmates. He learned their names one by one, and even joked with the ladies in the class that they shouldn’t fall in love with him because he already had four lovers.

Although polygamy was allowed in their world, the women of course preferred men who didn’t have many lovers.

This move made those who were interested in William back off regretfully.

“Why are all the good looking men taken?” a pretty girl sighed. “They should leave some of the good men for me.”

“I know, right?”

“Half-Elves are so dreamy. I want to have one as a lover, too!”

The girls started to whisper at each other. Soon, giggles resounded inside the room and the boys looked at the pretty ladies with disguised infatuation.

A few hours later, William and the boys of his class went to the dining room together. The Half-Elf had already sent a message to Ashe that he would be dining with his new classmates. The latter replied right away, and said that she would just have lunch with Princess Sidonie.

While William and his new classmates were talking, a group of teenage boys approached their table.

The moment William’s crew saw who was leading the group, they all stood up and bowed their heads in greeting.

“”Good afternoon, Your Highness.””

“Be at ease,” Prince Jason replied. “We are all students here, so there’s no need for formality.”

The Fifth Prince of the Kraetor Empire smiled as he made a gesture for the boys to return to their chairs. He then shifted his attention to William. A tinge of killing intent flashed in his eyes for a brief moment before it disappeared without a trace.

“I’m sorry to hear that you’ve been ostracized by the students in Class A,” Prince Jason said. “As the President of the Student Council, I regret not being able to do anything to help you.”

William nodded his head in understanding. ‘Do you really think of me as a fool? I bet you were the one who pulled the strings from behind.’

The Half-Elf didn’t say this out loud because doing so would just complicate things. For him, as long as he was able to meet Aamon and lift the curse from his lovers, he didn’t mind getting ostracized or insulted by anyone in the Kraetor Empire.

From the start, he didn’t intend to stay for a long time. He only promised that he would finish a school year to make the Emperor look at him favorably.

“Is there something you need from me, Your Highness?” William asked.

William knew that Prince Jason was infatuated with Princess Sidonie. If he hadn’t accepted the beautiful lady as his lover then he wouldn’t mind if the two of them became a couple. However, times had changed. He had no intention of giving away the Princess whom he had already considered as one of his future wives.

“Yes, there is something I need to tell you,” Prince Jason replied. “I will be joining the Tournament of Heroes in three months’ time. Not only that, I intend to be the champion.”

“Oh, so you wanted the Emperor to grant you one of your daydreams.”

“Daydreams?”

William nodded his head. “Yes. Because whatever you planned to wish for, you will not have it.”

“Oh? Just where is that confidence of yours coming from?” Prince Jason smiled evilly. “We are no longer in the Southern Continent. You are now in my home turf.”

William chuckled as he eyed the Prince who was planning to ask the Emperor to engage him with Princess Sidonie.

“It doesn’t matter where I am,” William declared with confidence. “What mine is mine, and it will never be yours.”

“We’ll see about that.”

“Look but don’t touch, or else you might become a blind person.”

Prince Jason smirked before taking his subordinates to the VIP rooms that were reserved for the Royal Family.

William watched him go with a neutral expression on his face. The moment he made Princess Sidonie his lover, he knew that there would be plenty of opposition. Unlike Wendy, Ashe, and Est, Princess Sidonie was the princess of the Kingdom of Freesia and the granddaughter of the Emperor of the Kraetor Empire.

Her status was quite high, so it was only natural for people to covet her beauty and the status that was attached to it.

“Wow,” one of William’s classmates muttered after the Prince had left. “You know Prince Jason? That’s amazing.”

“Yes,” William replied. “The two of us had met in the Southern Continent.”

To his surprise, it seemed that none of his classmates were aware about the war that had transpired in the Southern Continent. The major powers in the Central Continent had put a tight lid on the news about the Kraetor Empire’s, and the Elves’, conquest of the Southern Lands.

However, that didn’t change the fact that William’s name had been known to a lot of people from high places. Some of them even sent spies to watch his movements and see if they could bring him to their fold.

Someone who was capable of standing up against the Elves and their Guardians was someone that any Faction wanted to obtain. They would gladly give William riches, resources, and women, just to ensure that the Half-Elf would swear his loyalty to them.

Emperor Leonidas knew this, and ignored several requests from the neighboring Kingdoms and Empires that wanted to see and meet with William.

While he hadn’t made his stance known to Princess Sidonie and her chosen lover, he didn’t intend to allow others to have the Half-Elf either.

The High Priestess of Aamon’s Temple had already given him an instruction on how to deal with the teenage troublemaker. He was also told of William’s main reason for coming to the Kraetor Empire.

Evexius had given him the recordings of the battle that had happened between William and the Elves, and he had watched all of them in one sitting. This gave him a better understanding of William’s character and already thought of a way on how to use it to his advantage.

Although the skies above the Kraetor Empire were clear and very blue. A storm was brewing on the horizon.

It was a storm that would test not only how strong William’s resolve was, but also how strong his emotions were when it came to the people that mattered in his life.
