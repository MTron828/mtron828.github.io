Chapter 520: You Are Too Defenseless

As soon as William and Chiffon entered the academy gates, several stares landed on the two of them.

Chiffon seemed to be used to this treatment already, so she ignored them and continued dragging William behind her.

William, also didn’t mind being talked about by the students in the academy. He didn’t intend to stay there for long, so he wasn’t bothered by any of the gossip that was to spread while he was enrolled there.

However, even though he didn’t care about what others said, that didn’t mean that his sensitive hearing wasn’t able to pick up what the students were saying as they walked past them.

“Did you see that? It’s that disgusting trash eater.”

“Ewww! I bet a thousand gold coins that she went to the Garbage Dump again.”

“Isn’t that Princess Sidonie’s lover? What is he doing with that freak?”

“You know what they say, birds of the same feather, flock together.”

“Hahaha! Does he also eat trash?”

“Who knows? Maybe they shared some fish bones or eggshells between them.”

“Gross!”

William still had a calm expression on his face, but he was feeling irritated by the insults that were being said behind Chiffon’s back. Now that he knew the sin that she carried, he could somewhat understand why she would visit the Garbage Dump to look for something to eat.

‘Did she perhaps get banned from the canteen because she ate a lot?’

This was the thought that passed through William’s mind as he allowed himself to be dragged by the little girl who seemed to have increased her pace after entering the Academy.

“Chiffon, where are we going?’ William asked.

The little girl abruptly stopped and turned her head to look at William.

“Big Brother, where are you currently staying?” Chiffon asked back.

“The Third Year Male Dormitory?”

“Okay.”

Chiffon once again dragged William. This time, she headed towards the Aberdeen Dormitory where the Third Year boys stayed.

After entering the Boy’s Dormitory, Chiffon paced the halls unhurriedly. She was looking around like a country bumpkin and taking in the sights that she was seeing for the first time.

Chiffon was a well-known celebrity inside the academy, but not of a good kind.

She was given the nickname, Trash Eater, because she was often seen at the Garbage Dump picking up trash to eat during lunch and dinner. At first, the boys tried to approach Chiffon because she was very cute. However, after finding out her daily routine, all of them backed away in disgust.

None of the girls wanted to have any connection with Chiffon either, because, for them, she was the embodiment of filth.

They didn’t even want to be in the same room with her, so Chiffon stopped coming to classes and only wandered around the Academy grounds, while the classes were ongoing because it was empty.

She was surprised when William talked to her because she thought that no one in the Academy would dare to get near her.

Right now, Chiffon treated William as her first friend in the Academy, so she wanted to know more about him.

“Aren’t you a little too bold?” William asked after closing the door of his room. “You came here to the boy’s dormitory and even came inside my room. Aren’t you afraid that I might do something to you?”

“Do something? Like what, Big Brother?” Chiffon asked back as she sat on the only couch in the room.

William rubbed his temple as he sat on top of his bed. He didn’t know if Chiffon was really ignorant or she was only messing around with him.

If one were to look at the Chiffon, they would come to the conclusion that she was only an eleven or twelve-year-old Human child. However, since William had the System, the pink-haired girl wouldn’t be able to hide her age even if she kept mum for the rest of her life.

The other thing that bothered Williams was Chiffon’s race.

Nerezza

Half Dwarf, Half Demon.

Nerezza was a general term used for hybrid races that had a demonic origin. Although there were other specific names for such unions, this term was the most commonly used in the World of Hestia.

William was a Half-Elf, and his parents were a Human and a High Elf.

Although he was very tempted to ask Chiffon about her parents, William was hesitant to do that. He hadn’t had the chance to see a dwarf, but he had already seen demons, in the form of Sha and Zhu.

According to the System, Dwarves were only four to five feet tall with broad and stout bodies. Chiffon’s body was slender and delicate just like a human girl. This made William believe that her body’s constitution was taken from her Demon Parent, while her height was taken from her Dwarf Parent.

‘So this is what you call a legal loli,’ William mused as he looked at the girl who was busy licking his lollipop.

(A/N: Boys, behave yourselves.)

Chiffon felt William’s stare and thought that the latter wanted her to come close. The pink-haired girl stood up from the couch and walked towards William’s bed. Out of curiosity, she pressed the mattress of the bed to see how soft it was.

“Big Brother, your bed is very comfortable, can I lay down on it?” Chiffon asked.

“Mmm? Aren’t all beds in every dormitory the same?” William replied with a question of his own.

Chiffon became silent for a while. It seemed that she was hesitating whether to answer William’s question or not.

“Big Brother, I don’t sleep in the girl’s dormitory,” Chiffon answered after a few minutes passed.

William raised an eyebrow as he pressed the little girl for answers. After a short interrogation, the Half-Elf finally got the answers to his question, and he didn’t like them one bit.

According to Chiffon, the academy didn’t assign her any room and only delegated the stables as her resting area. William was appalled when he found out that the little girl was left to fend off for herself, without anyone to take care of her.

He didn’t say anything earlier, but he had noticed that Chiffon’s uniform was quite dirty, even before she went to the Garbage Dump. Now that he knew that the girl was being mistreated by the academy, William found himself clenching his fist in irritation.

One of William’s weaknesses were little children. They reminded him of the little brothers and sisters that he had cared for in the orphanage. This was why he was overprotective of Eve and Brianna and ensured that the two of them were safe from harm.

Although Chiffon was eighteen years old, her appearance was that of a child. Even if he didn’t want to admit it, he felt sorry for her and wanted to do something for her sake.

It was at that moment when William heard the soft breathing of a sleeper. Chiffon had fallen asleep on his bed, with a peaceful expression on her face.

‘You are too defenseless,’ William thought as he shook his head. He then took off her shoes and helped her have a more comfortable sleeping position.

Suddenly, the door of the room opened and two people entered without knocking on the door.

“Will, what are you doing?” Ashe asked in a tone filled with disbelief.

“Will, how could you,” Princess Sidonie covered her lips with a hand. Just like Ashe, she couldn’t believe the scene that she was seeing with her own eyes.

William turned his head to look at his lovers. “Oh. Welcome back. Just a minute, I’m about to finish.”

The Half-Elf was currently holding onto Chiffon’s sleeping body, in an angle that could cause plenty of misunderstandings.

Ashe closed the door and locked it in place. Princess Sidonie narrowed her eyes, and approached the bed with the intention of educating William about laying his hands on minors.

When she was only a few meters away from the bed, Chiffon sleepily reached out to William and held on to his arm.

“Big Brother, it was good,” Chiffon said sleepily. “I want more.”

After saying those misleading words, the pink-haired loli once again returned to her slumber. Ashe and Princess Sidonie looked at the girl’s dirty, and crumpled uniform, before looking back at William, who was right on top of the sleeping girl.

“Will, we need to talk,” Ashe said with a smile that didn’t reach her eyes.

Princess Sidonie was also smiling, but her eyes had already turned golden. Clearly, the two had misinterpreted the girl’s words, and William’s current position.

The Half-Elf looked at the sleeping girl under him, before shifting his attention to his two lovers, who were looking at him with murder in their eyes.

He knew that if he didn’t explain things properly, someone was going to sleep on the floor tonight.Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates
