Chapter 31: Either It Dies, Or We Die

The Dire Wolves were helpless against William’s and Ella’s mad rush. Helen’s golden threads would decapitate any wolf that tried to attack William from his blindspot. With an expert like her protecting him, William didn’t have to worry about getting hurt.

Of course, he and Ella steered clear of the Centennial and Millennial Beasts. They only fought the wolves along the outside perimeter. Although they were feeling confident, they were not cocky.

Helen and Owen nodded their heads in appreciation. Not every ten-year-old boy would get the opportunity to fight in a beast-tide and remain unscathed.

William was about to nudge Ella, to head a bit deeper in the Wolf Tide when a few golden strings wrapped around the two of them. Helen didn’t want William and Ella to get carried away, so she decided to drag them back to where Owen was standing.

Also, she noticed that the tide of battle was starting to get serious from now on. Majority of the small fries had been dealt with. The real battle was about to begin.

“Young Master, things are going to get a bit dangerous,” Helen said. “Stay here for the time being.”

William obediently nodded his head. He had already gained decent experience points, so he decided to listen to his Auntie Helen.

At that right moment, the Wolf Tide suddenly had a drastic change. The wolves’ eyes glowed red. The Black Sea had now a smattering of red dots and looked more sinister compared to before.

“Berserk Call,” Owen muttered. “As expected, this is gonna be ugly.” ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

The Wolves charged at the three teams who were attacking their leaders. At first, Marcus and the rest were taking it easy. Although the wolves had the advantage in numbers, they were more than capable of dealing with them.

The Centennial Beasts, although strong, was not something that they couldn’t handle. They were about to completely incapacitate them when a powerful howl descended on the battlefield.

Immediately, the two Centennial Beasts countenance changed. They entered a berserk state which multiplied their powers threefold. The same could be said for the rest of the wolves that were currently attacking them without fear for their lives.

“This is why I hate fighting against Millennial Beasts with Lightning Elements,” James cursed. “These critters are full of dirty tricks.”

It was at that time when a flash of purple lightning bolt streaked towards James’ direction. The old man used his giant axe to block the blow like a shield. However, it still sent him hurtling a few meters in the air.

“Flare Explosion!” Mordred roared as he pressed both of his palms on the ground.

All the wolves within fifteen square meters around him were turned to ashes.

“Hey! Are you forgetting that I’m here?!” Jekyll yelped in anger. He was in the middle of the battle formation and keeping close watch on James and Mordred’s situation. Mordred’s sudden attack caught him by surprise because he was distracted by the Millennial Beast’s purple lightning.

“Relax, this little blaze couldn’t possibly kill you,” Mordred replied with a shrug.

“I’m not worried about your puny fire killing me! I’m worried about my clothes!” Jekyll snapped. “I just bought this from the capital a week ago and now it’s ruined!”

“… Just put it on my tab.”

“Fck! What tab are you talking about?! You still haven’t paid the debt you owed me and it’s been four years already!”

“You two bastards, stop arguing and help me!” James roared. He wanted to use his axe to slap the two arguing numbskulls who had completely forgotten that they were dealing with a walking calamity.

If not for the fact that he was surrounded by hundreds of berserked Dire Wolves, he would have already beaten the two idiots to kingdom come.

The battle continued for an hour and most of the Dire Wolves had been dealt with. Now, only less than two hundred wolves remained of the once formidable wolf tide.

The two Centennial Beasts were also lying on the ground. They were not dead, but they no longer held any threat whatsoever.

Although the outcome seemed to be leaning on the side of Lont, everyone had dire expressions on their faces. William noticed this as well and wondered why everyone felt that way.

“Aren’t we already winning?” William asked. “How come I sense that everyone’s mood has turned for the worst?”

“You have good eyes, little Will.” Owen chuckled. “Indeed. If we were just to look at the numbers then this battle can already be considered a victory. However, until the Millennial Beast retreats, the victors and losers are still undecided.”

“Retreat?” William frowned. “Why would we want that oversized wolf to retreat? Wouldn’t it be better if it is killed?”

“Of course.” Owen nodded. “However, Millennial Beasts with the lightning element have a very disgusting ability. They have this skill called Storm Annihilation. This is a suicide skill that is capable of destroying everything. The last time this skill was used, an entire capital disappeared from the face of the continent.”

“Hyeok!” Williams almost choked on his saliva when he heard Owen’s explanation.

Destroying an entire capital? Is that a joke? However, one glance was enough to tell William that Owen was not lying to him. He also noticed that his grandfather, and the rest were only trying to threaten the Beast and not fighting it head on.

“I’m very worried,” Helen muttered. “This is an old monster and it might not really care whether it lived or died. Owen, we have to prepare for the worst.”

Owen nodded his head and began chanting. If the Beast was really going to use its suicide move, he would erect a barrier and try to protect everyone. However, he was not confident that he would succeed.

The best case scenario was for the Millennial Beast to leave on its own.

James decapitated the last dire wolf with ease. His giant axe was now soaked in the blood of its victims.

The Millennial Beast watched all of these with indifference. It didn’t really care whether its pack died or not. They had already been banished from the Forbidden Land, and there was no going back for them.

It raised its head and howled a mournful cry. James and the faces of everyone in the valley immediately paled. They understood what the Beast wanted to do. It wanted to have a life and death battle with them!

“Um, can I go home now?” Jekyll asked. “I remember that I still have things to do…”

Everyone glared at Jekyll, but they didn’t say anything. In fact, they were thinking the same. They were cursing the Millennial Beast in their hearts for being stubborn. All of them wanted to scream and raise their middle fingers at the same time.

If you want to die! Then just die by yourself! Bastard!

“Sir, what are we going to do?” Marcus asked. Although he tried to hide it, the worry on his face was evident.

“We need to end this quickly,” James replied. “Either it dies, or we die.”

Owen and Helen also made their move. They left Wiliam alone and headed to assist their comrades to battle. It was not because they didn’t care for William’s safety. On the contrary, they made their decision because they cared for everyone’s safety.

If the Beast isn’t killed as soon as possible, then the entirety of Lont would be wiped out from the face of the continent. Simply put, there was no safe place to run or hide.
