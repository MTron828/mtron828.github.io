Chapter 12: Choosing A Path [Part 2]

‘Steel Armament, Quick Attack, and Horn Assault,’ William mused while looking at the three options.

William picked the Steel Armament without a second thought. The horn and hooves were his Mama Ella’s main weapons. If it were strengthened then it would definitely improve her fighting prowess.

‘Let’s put the other point on quick attack for now. I’ll get Horn Assault later-after Mama Ella increases her level. With this, I am confident that we will be able to handle a one on one battle with a goblin.’

William had seen how Ella handled the three injured goblins after he cast the Bestow Skill on her. Although he wasn’t a hundred percent sure, he was confident that Ella wouldn’t lose to a goblin if she fought it one on one.

Even after he made all the necessary preparations, William was still uncertain if he should go back inside the dungeon. At the end of the day, he was still a one-year-old baby with the mental age of an eighteen-year-old boy.

For William, he could visit the dungeon when he was a bit older and ensure that both he and Ella wouldn’t be in any danger. However, the temptation of becoming stronger at such a young age was too hard to resist.

‘I guess I’ll discuss this with Mama Ella first.’ William sighed. ‘If she thinks that it is too dangerous then I’ll wait till I grow a few years older before we challenge the dungeon again.’

As if waiting for that exact moment, the sleeping goat finally woke up and licked William’s face.

“Eyah.” (Good morning Mama.)

“Meeeh.”

“Eyah Eyah.” (Mama, there’s something important that I would like to talk about.)

“Meeeh?”

“Eyah Eyah…” (It’s about this…)

While the baby and the goat were having a heart to heart talk. Mordred had already left the house to handle the things within their estate. Anna, on the other hand, was cooking their lunch, while the maids did the other chores inside the house.

“Home sweet home!” a booming voice sounded from outside the house.

“Master, you are finally back,” a maid bowed as he greeted the man who swaggered into the house with a big smile on his face.

The man had gray hair and above average looks that would make any teenage girl on Earth call him “Sugar Daddy”. His flawless smile made the maid blush as he nodded to her with a smile.

“I heard that my grandson is here,” the old man said. “Where is he?”

“Master, if you are talking about Young Lord Matthew, he is currently in the study with his teacher. Should I call for him?”

“I’m not talking about Matthew. I’m talking about my other grandson.”

The maid nodded in understanding, “Little William is currently inside Lady Anna’s and Sir Mordred’s bedroom.”

“Alright. Return to your duties,” the man waved his hand and headed straight to the second floor where the resting quarters were located.

“Eyah, Eyah?” (What do you think, Mama?)

“… Meeeh.”

While William was waiting for his Mama Ella’s reply, an unknown man burst into the bedroom.

“Aha! There you are, you little critter!” the man laughed as he grabbed William off the carpet and raised him high up in the air. “You are definitely my grandson, that red-hair and those green eyes of yours remind me of your father and mother.”

William smacked the unknown man on the face with his little chubby fist, but the latter only laughed.

“Hahaha! You are indeed a true Ainsworth. So small and yet so brave!” The man nodded in appreciation. “Listen to me, little brat. I am your grandpa. Grandpa, say Grandpaaaa.”

“Eyah… Eyah!” (Yeah… No. Take this!)

A sprinkle of water splashed on the man’s face. William’s giggle resounded inside the bedroom as his “Grandpa” looked at him with a complicated expression. After a few seconds, the man roared and joined the baby in his laughter.

This was the scene that Anna saw when she returned to the bedroom. Their maid had informed her that her father-in-law had returned from his trip. She was mildly surprised when the old man went to look for William first, instead of looking for her husband, Mordred.

Anna covered her lips and chuckled at the funny scene in front of her. Her piss-stained father-in-law was laughing with the giggling baby in his hands.

“Father, you’ve finally returned,” Anna greeted after recovering her composure.

“Ah, Anna, I’m back,” James, Mordred’s and Morgan’s father, replied with a smile. “This brat sure is feisty.”

“William is normally a well behaved child.” Anna grinned. “This is the first time I’m seeing his mischievous side.”

“Well, boys tend to be mischievous,” James agreed. “Also, Ella, stop poking me with your horns. Hey, I said stop!”

Ella was stomping her foot on the floor while poking James with her horns. She was very upset about how James was treating her baby. If not for the fact that the one who raised her was this man, she would have already impaled him with her horns-using her full strength.

“Ella has been taking care of William ever since he arrived,” Anna explained. “I think she treats him as her own child. Father, please return William to Ella or else she might really have a go with you.”

“Meeeeeeeeeeh!”

“Oh, you. I just left for a year and you’ve already forgotten how I raised you. What an ungrateful goat you are.” James snorted, but a smile hung on his lips. “Fine, I’ll take a bath first. You look after this brat for me.”

James handed William to Anna and left the room while humming a tune. Clearly, he was in a good mood.

“Bad baby!” Anna lightly pinched William’s chubby cheeks. “That is your grandpa. Don’t pee on him, okay?”

“Eyah.” (I’ll think about it.)

Although this was the first time that William had met his grandpa, James, he found the old man to his liking. Of course, James didn’t look old. In fact, he only looked like a middle-aged man that was still in his prime.

William was looking forward to knowing more about his family in this life and prayed that he would be able to get along with all of them.
