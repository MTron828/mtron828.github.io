Chapter 227: Oathkeeper’s Key

In the town of Lont…

A black raven landed on the ledge of Celine’s window, carrying a parcel on its leg.

Oliver, who was sitting on top of his perch, narrowed his eyes before waving his talon. The raven didn’t move as the parcel on its legs flew towards the Parrot Monkey.

When it was only half a meter away from his perch, the parcel glowed and a message appeared in the air in front of Oliver.

-

“The Saleh, Nasir, Rhys, and Eroan Clans are gathering their young prodigies to their ancestral domains.

Also, certain influential factions in the Central Continent are making their move. Like the Old Elven Families, they are also preparing for a big event. The only problem is that no one, aside from their Patriarch’s and a few elders, know what is about to happen.

I consulted with the Patriarch of the Rayleigh Family and he made a divination. According to him, he couldn’t see what was going to happen in the future. However, he knew where it would happen, and that was none other than the Southern Continent.

Tell my granddaughter to be careful. The current balance of power in the Silvermoon Continent is quite volatile and not even the Aenarion Family is safe. For now, I’ve decided to keep a low profile and not mess with these muddled waters.

Oliver, keep my granddaughter safe and remember the vow that you made to me. I will hold you accountable if anything happens to Ceilne.

May the Goddesses of the Twin Moons bestow their blessings upon the two of you.”

-

Oliver glanced at the raven and nodded his head. The raven nodded back and flew away. It had completed its mission, so it was now time to return to its master.

The Parrot Monkey sighed as he sat on his perch. Soon, the sound of footsteps coming down the stairs reached his ears.

“Was that a letter from Grandfather?” Celine asked.

“Yes, Mistress,” Oliver replied. “It has begun.”

Celine nodded her head and went out of the house to visit James. The two of them, and the veterans of Lont, needed to make preparations for the calamity that was about to befall the Southern Continent.

“Father,” Lionel said with a serious expression. “I was reading the ancient scrolls during my history lessons and came upon something interesting.It said that the First King of the Hellan Kingdom always wore a necklace with a Key attached to it.

“I’m very curious, what do you think that key is used for? Aside from the records saying that the First King treated it like a treasure, no other information about it can be found anywhere.”

Noah lowered the book in his hand as he glanced at his oldest son. “Oh? I never thought you were someone that liked history. Two years ago, you said that you didn’t want to read about anything related to the history of our kingdom because it was already in the past. Why are you suddenly getting curious now?”

Lionel smiled as he faced his father’s stare head on, “As the Crown Prince of the Hellan Kingdom, it would be embarrassing if someone were to ask me about how our Kingdom was founded. If I am not able to answer this question then wouldn’t I become a disgrace?”

“True.” Noah nodded his head in agreement. “Very well, I will tell you what I know. The key that you are referring to is called the ‘Oathkeeper Key’. I also don’t know much about the key, but from what my father told me, the First King had a secret domain where he hid all of his precious treasures.

“Naturally, no one knows where this domain is. He didn’t share this knowledge with anyone, not even to his own son. The only legacy he left him was the Hellan Kingdom and the Oathkeeper Key. You could even say that the Kings that followed him, did everything in their power to search for this elusive domain. However, all of their efforts were in vain.”

Lionel listened seriously and nodded from time to time. The secret organization said that they would support and enthrone him as the Emperor of the Southern Continent if he could give them the Oathkeeper Key.

After hearing about the Key’s importance, Lionel was having second thoughts. If he could find the key as well as the domain, perhaps he would be able to get his hands on extremely rare resources that would boost the Military Might of the Hellan Kingdom.

If that were to happen, he could command the Kingdom’s Armies to conquer the entirety of the continent and declare himself as the new Emperor.

However, the agent of the organization that was keeping in touch with him left him some words that made him anxious.

“You are not the only candidate that our organization is supporting. If the key is not in our hands within two months, our deal is over.”

Lionel had always thought that he was the only candidate that the organization was grooming to become the Emperor of the Southern Continent. Although he wasn’t a narcissist like William, he was someone who thought highly of himself. For him, he was the best, and the only one who had the right to stand above others.

He couldn’t tolerate being used as a stepping stone by others, and the organization’s veiled threat made him anxious. Because of this, he decided to put more effort in finding the key.

‘I still have two months,’ Lionel thought. ‘After I get the key from my father, I will conduct a search to find the First King’s Hidden Domain. If what I find inside is greater than the benefits of being an Emperor then I will cut ties with the organization.’

Lionel was an ambitious person. He didn’t want to be treated like a “subordinate”. The only reason he was trying to keep a good relationship with this secret group was because he felt that his current position was being threatened by his Younger Brother, Rufus.

The Crown Prince only had Grade C Talent in Magic, but he compensated this shortcoming by training hard as a swordsman. Right now, he was in the middle stages of the Gold Rank and the King had recognized his efforts and gave him the title of “Crown Prince”.

Even so, that didn’t stop Lionel’s anxiousness. He knew that his father was a cunning man. Although the title of Crown Prince was currently on his head, the King of the Hellan Kingdom could easily take it away.

Noah was not only cunning, but ruthless as well. It just didn’t show on the surface because the Kingdom had been experiencing an era of peace and prosperity before the Beast Tide and Dungeon Outbreaks happened.

While Lionel was thinking of these things, Noah closed the book in his hand and summoned a small ornate box from his storage ring. He then passed it along to Lionel and asked him to open it.

The Crown Prince obeyed his father and opened the small box. What lay inside was a key made from an unknown material. This was the first time he had seen such a material.

“That is the Oathkeeper Key,” Noah said. “It is a key that is passed down to the reigning King of the Kingdom. Naturally, that key will be passed to your hands after I step down from my position. Until then, I will keep it safe until your coronation.”

Lionel had a complicated look on his face as he looked at the key in his hands. He never thought that the key he was looking for could be obtained so easily. Now, there were only two questions going through his head.

Should he give the key to the organization?

or

Should he keep it a secret from them while he looked for the Hidden Domain that was somewhere within the Kingdom?

‘Two months. I still have two months.’ Lionel calmly returned the key to the ornate box and passed it back to his father. ‘Since I already know where the key is. I will start looking for the domain.’

Lionel knew that the organization needed the key desperately if they were willing to trade the entire Southern Continent for it.

Suddenly a realization passed through his body like a lightning bolt. The Crown Prince didn’t know if his hunch was true, but if it was then that meant that the organization already knew the location of the Hidden Domain.

Lionel didn’t want to think of such a possibility because that would put him into a corner. If that was really the reality then he would have no choice but to relinquish the key to the organization.

He just hoped that when he did give them the key, the organization would honor their promise and make him the Emperor of the Southern Continent.

‘Sidonie, you will be mine’ Lionel thought as he pushed back the bitterness in his heart with the face of his beloved princess.

He was fine even if the treasure within the Hidden Domain was plundered. As long as the most beautiful young lady in the continent, the Third Princess of the Kingdom of Freesia, Sidonie, became his woman then he could accept the outcome.

Since he had already confirmed the location of the key, it was now time to put his plan into motion. He would force the organization to bring the Third Princess to the Hellan Kingdom as a guarantee that they would honor their promise.
