Chapter 359: Who Dares To Get In My Way?!

William looked towards the East as he waited for the sun to rise. It was still dark, and the air was quite chilly, but the Half-Elf didn’t mind it one bit.

Ashe had taken the initiative to show William how much she had missed him, which caught him completely by surprise. They said that “absence makes the heart grow fonder”, and the red-headed boy experienced first hand how a mermaid showed her affection to her significant other.

Although Ashe could only transform into her true form for three hours a day, it was a different story in William’s Spiritual World. She could stay in her true form for as long as she wanted in that world where there were no barriers between the two of them.

Whenever William thought back to when he and Ashe first met, a smile would always appear on his face.

‘She will probably wake up around noon,’ William grinned after thinking about his exhausted lover, who was still sleeping in their warm and comfortable bed.

The union between souls was very different from a physical union. It was more intimate, which helped William increase his Synchronization Rate with Ashe.

‘Owen’s and Lady Eros’ techniques are really effective,’ William thought as a mischievous smile appeared on his face. After coming to know the basics from Owen and training under the Goddess of Lust, William became confident in how to satisfy his lovers.

Unfortunately, he was still underaged, so he couldn’t do it physically. However, inside his Spiritual World, the union between souls was possible.

“Good Morning, Sir William.”

An angelic voice laced with surprise called out to him from behind Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“Good Morning, Princess,” William replied. “You’re up early. Were you not able to sleep properly?”

Princess Sidonie shook her head as she walked towards William. “I’m just not used to sleeping in a place that I’ve never been before. I envy Priscilla. She’s still asleep in our room right now.”

William nodded in understanding. He had also experienced something similar when he accompanied Ezio as part of his training.

After the short exchange, William once again turned to face the East, waiting for the sun to rise from the edge of the world.

Princess Sidonie stood a meter away from him. Her Big Sister, Morgana, was still resting within her Mindscape. It was now a good time to ask the boy she liked the most some personal questions, while her other half was still asleep.

(A/N: Mindscape is another term for Spiritual World, and Sea of Consciousness. However, I will be using Mindscape more when referring to Sidonie’s and Morgana’s world.)

“Sir William, you seem close with Sir Ian,” Princess Sidonie said. “What is your relationship with each other?”

William’s attention was so focused on waiting for the exact moment when the sun appeared in the East that he casually gave an answer to the Princess’ inquiry.

“Ian is my gir-boy… friend.” William almost bit his tongue as he forcefully stopped himself mid-sentence. “The two of us are friends.”

Princess Sidonie noticed William’s sudden brake in his words and decided to pry further.

“The two of you seemed closer than friends,” Princess Sidonie commented. “For a moment, I thought the two of you were lovers.”

“Hahaha! How can that be possible?” William might have looked like he was amused with Princess Sidonie’s words, but deep inside he was already sweating buckets.

Due to the fact that he was separated from Ashe for almost two weeks, he had completely forgotten that he shouldn’t show any kind of intimacy when the two of them were in public.

“You’re thinking too much, Princess,” William said.

Princess Sidonie nodded. She was still half in doubt, so she decided to ask a follow up question.

“What is your relationship with Lady Wendy?”

“She’s my lover.”

“So, you admit that she’s your lover?” Sidonie inquired.

“Of course,” William replied in a carefree manner. The image of the beautiful blonde beauty whom he teased when he was awake, and who beat him up in his dreams, flashed across his mind. “I wish she was here.”

Princess Sidonie felt relief and a slight pain in her chest after hearing William’s words, that were filled with love and longing.

Relief because she had confirmed that the boy she liked was only interested in girls, and pain because, even though Wendy was not by his side, he still thought of her. This show of affection made her feel as if something was pricking her heart, making it feel pain.

“She’s a very lucky girl,” Princess Sidonie said softly.

William shook his head as he faced the Princess by his side. “I am the lucky one, to be able to have her in my life.”

It was at this moment when the sun rose in the East and cast its light on the Half-Elf’s back.

Princess Sidonie looked at the handsome boy whose hair was as red as flames and whose eyes were clear and bright. The light of the sun provided a golden backdrop, which made him look like he was part of a beautiful painting.

Princess Sidonie wasn’t able to stop her wildly beating heart from skipping a beat, as her attraction to William grew in that brief moment in time.

Calum, along with over two hundred members of The Organization, arrived at the Southern Regions of the Hellan Kingdom, where the Hidden Valley was located.

He had only rested for a day after his arrival before he set out to carry out Conner’s direct command. When Calum learned that the Hidden Domain had finally been opened, he knew that their Organization had acquired a priceless treasure.

Although he was worried about Princess Sidonie’s next course of action, the Hidden Domain was the main reason why they had prepared the Continental Spell. They wanted to prevent anyone in the Southern Continent from getting in their way.

As long as they uncovered the secrets behind the Undying Lands, all of their efforts would be worth it!

“Are you sure this is where the Hidden Valley was located?” Calum asked. He had a frown on his face as he looked at the mile long deep pit in the ground.

“Y-Yes. Believe me Vice-Commander,” one of the men that had accompanied Conner back to the capital stuttered. “I swear that it is where the Hidden Valley was located. Isn’t that right?”

The man looked at his comrade who had also been sent to guide Calum to the location of the entrance of the Undying Lands.

“Sir, this is indeed the place where the Hidden Domain is located,” the man replied. “However, it was not like this when we left it. It looks as if… the entire valley has been gouged out of the ground.”

Calum sighed and took a red gem, that was as big as an adult’s hand, out from his storage ring. Moments later, the image of Conner appeared in the space in front of him.

“Have you arrived?” Conner asked.

Calum nodded. “We have arrived at the location, but the Hidden Valley is not here.”

“What do you mean that it’s not there?”

“It is just as I mentioned, My Lord. Please, take a good look for yourself.”

Calum rotated the gem and allowed Conner to see the actual site where the Hidden Domain was located. It had been three hours since the sunrise so there was plenty of light to see the surroundings.

Conner wasn’t able to stop himself from slamming his fist on his desk in anger. The desk broke apart due to the impact, but he paid it no heed.

He had toiled for many years researching the whereabouts of the Hidden Domain and its key. Now that he had finally accomplished his goal, the Hidden Domain had disappeared as if it had sprouted wings and flew away!

“Find it!” Conner ordered. “Find the monument that opens the path to the Undying Lands! Search for clues! Don’t rest until you find it!”

Calum could hear, and feel, Conner’s rage through the communication crystal and promised to conduct an extensive search to find the whereabouts of the monument.

Back in the Capital of Gladiolus…

“Damn it!” Conner kicked the broken pieces of the desk away in anger. He couldn’t stop the rage that was boiling inside his heart due to the disappearance of the Undying Lands.

Suddenly, the door to his quarters opened and the Crown Prince of the Hellan Kingdom, Lionel, walked towards him with an equally furious expression.

“Where is the Princess?!” Lionel inquired in anger. “I have waited for over two weeks and she’s still not here! Are you and your men all incompetent?!”

“Shut up!” Conner slapped the Crown Prince which sent the latter slamming towards the wall of his room. “You dare look down on me and my men?!”

Conner kicked the fallen Prince repeatedly to vent out his anger and frustration. If not for the fact that the subordinates of the Prince had been there to accompany their Master, Prince Lionel might have been kicked to death by Conner whose wrath was at its peak.

“Take him away and lock him up! I don’t want to see him again!” Conner ordered his subordinates, who had arrived at the room to check on the commotion. They looked at the badly injured Crown Prince who was lying on the floor.

They hastily obeyed their leader’s order because Conner was still emitting his killing intent. This was the first time they had seen their leader in this state and it made them feel fearful.

After everyone had left the room, Conner punched the wall, sending pieces of debris flying.

“Who?!” Conner roared in anger. “Who dares to get in my way?! Who?!”

Conner’s mad raving continued for an hour before everything turned silent. During that hour, the room where he was staying had been completely turned into ruins.
