Chapter 315: What Is A Shepherd?

“I’ve thought long and hard about choosing the best Advanced Class for you.” David patted his chest with pride. “In the end, these three Job Classes stood out. No need to thank me. Just pick anything you like.”

“Sorry, but I’ll pass,” William replied firmly. ‘Who would choose any of these Job Classes? I’d rather unlock my Prestige Classes rather than pick one of these choices!’

William would not accept it.

He would never accept it!

He would die of shame just looking at this Job Class, leaving him no choice but to ask the system to lock it forever!

“Eh? But I worked hard to choose these Job Classes for you!” David replied with a pout, which made William look at him in disdain.

Issei and Lily also backed away as their expressions turned to disgust.

‘Yuck! An old man trying to act cute is disgusting!’ Lily covered her lips with her hands. She was afraid that she would say her thoughts out loud if she didn’t do so.

Issei, on the other hand, was also covering his lips, but it was for a different reason. He was doing his best not to laugh out loud. The Harem God was the one that gave these recommendations to David in order to prank William.

“Sir David, are these three the only choices I have?” William inquired. He was hoping that the God of Shepherd was just pranking him. “There are still more, right?”

“Well, if you don’t want to choose from these options then we can generate a Job Class randomly.” David admitted. “However, the Job Class you will get is random. You will not be able to change it because it is a permanent Job Class. Are you fine with that?”

William nodded his head. He believed that the random Job Class would be loads better than the three options that were presented to him.

“Understood. However, before we do that, let me ask you something, William,” David looked at the boy while playing with his beard. “Tell me, what is a Shepherd?”

“A Shepherd is someone who tends goats and sheeps?” William answered. “Someone who watches over the herd?”

“You’re not wrong, but you’re only half right.” David chuckled. “Listen, William. A Shepherd’s primary responsibility is the safety and welfare of the flock. This is true. However, you don’t need a flock or a herd to be a Shepherd.”

David patted William’s shoulder and looked at him with a serious expression. “A Shepherd’s role is to watch over, look after, or guide somebody. They don’t necessarily need to be a member of the Herd or a Flock. Those who will follow you, and stand by your side, are the members of your herd. Remember this, and remember it well.”

William nodded his head. He half understood and half doubted David’s words. Still, he knew that the Old God wouldn’t say these words if they didn’t have a purpose.

“Where are my manners?” David patted his forehead as if he had forgotten something important. “Sit first. There are still a few things I need to tell you before your trial starts.”

David waved his hand and several wooden chairs appeared in front of William, Issei, and Lily. When everyone was seated, he gave William a lecture about the secrets of the Shepherd Class.

“Tell me, William. What do you think the most loyal beast within our Herd is?” David asked.

“A sheep?” William replied with uncertainty. “Or maybe a dog?”

David chuckled as he played with his beard. “William, you can never trust a sheep. Because some of them are wolves in sheep’s clothing. As for dogs, although they are man’s best friend and loyal to a fault, they are not the most loyal creature of the Herd.”

“Are they perhaps goats?”

“No. Goats are moody creatures. One moment they are licking you, the next second they are eating your clothes. Also, they like to butt heads with everyone.”

“I see.” William nodded. “Then which animal is the most loyal member of the Herd?”

David rested his wooden staff over his lap as he closed his eyes. “The most loyal member of the herd is not actually an animal, but a monstrous beast. They are the beasts that swore eternal loyalty to me thousands of years ago. They also lived in your previous world, Earth, at one point in time, but now, they can only be seen in fantasy books.”

William gulped as he waited for the continuation of David’s explanation. He wondered what kind of monster David was referring to and why the God was telling him this information.

David opened his eyes and smiled. It was as if he was remembering the image of a dear old friend that he hadn’t seen for thousands of years.

“The most loyal member of the herd… is actually the Minotaur Race,” David stated. “They are our eternal protectors and because of this, they will never, ever, hurt us. Even if you kill them, they won’t fight back. That’s why, William. No matter what happens, no matter the situation. You are not allowed to harm them and their race. Even if they are the enemy. Can you promise me that, William?”

William thought about it and reluctantly nodded, “I promise.”

“Good. Now I will tell you why you need to ascend to your next Job Class,” David pointed at the golden portal at the center of the room.

“Your trial lies in that portal. You can only leave this place once you enter the Gate of Heaven. Naturally, it won’t be easy because it is guarded by the Celestial Army. William, only the souls of the dead can come to the Temple of the Gods. The only exit in this place is the Cycle of Reincarnation.”

Issei and Lily, who was seated beside William, nodded their heads in agreement. David didn’t lie. Only the souls of the dead can come to the Temple of the Gods, and they had already broken a few rules by bringing William’s consciousness over.

Actually, the one who proposed to bring William’s consciousness to the Temple was David. Issei and Lily didn’t support his idea because they knew that once William was brought to the Temple, he would not be able to leave, unless he entered the Cycle of Reincarnation.

However, David assured the two Gods that he had a way to let William go back to his world safely. This was why Lily used her powers to pull William’s consciousness from Hestia and sealed it inside her Pink Teddy Bear.

That way, William would be able to materialize on their plane of existence even with an incomplete soul. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“I’ll be honest, unless you advance your Shepherd Job Class, you will not be able to leave this place,” David explained. “Well, I don’t mind if you stay here, but can you really leave your family and friends behind?”

“Of course not,” William replied firmly. “But, Sir David, can we compromise on the Job Classes? Can’t you give me a cool sounding Job Class?”

“Actually, those three Job Classes were just my way of joking with you. Hahahaha!”

“Hahaha… but you’re half serious, right, Sir David?”

David grinned. “William the second stage of the Shepherd Job Class relates to your soul. It will automatically adjust itself to the most compatible setting for you. No matter what you get, know that this is the most appropriate Job Class that will ensure your growth. That’s why, you can rest easy.”

“Right! I knew that Sir David only thinks of my well being.”

“Of course. I am the God of Shepherds. I can’t possibly bring harm to you, right?”

Issei and Lily watched this nonsense exchange from the side. They didn’t believe David’s words because he was one of the most notorious pranksters in the Multiverse. The only thing that the two Gods could do was light an incense candle for William in their hearts because he was about to get pranked really hard.

“Now William, enter the portal,” David gestured. “It is time for you to unlock the next stage of the Shepherd Job Class.”

“Yes!” William bowed his head to David, Issei, and Lily. After paying his respects he walked towards the portal with a determined expression.

His family, lovers, friends, and acquaintances were still waiting for him in Hestia. He needed to get back to them as soon as possible. He was also worried about the current situation of the war because all news was cut off from the mortal realm.

The moment he entered the portal, he found himself standing in what seemed to be a mountainous region. After scanning his surroundings, his eyes automatically locked on a Giant Gate that was shining in the distance.

‘That must be the Heaven’s Gate that Sir David was talking about,’ William thought. ‘That is where I need to go in order to go back.’

William clenched his fist and was about to use his magic powers in order to hasten his travel when he felt that something was wrong.

The Half-Elf frowned and pointed at the ground beside him.

“Ice Bullet!”

He waited for a time but nothing happened.

“Void Arrow!”

“Firebolt!”

“Waterball!”

“Stone Bullet!”

William sighed because his conclusion was right. He was unable to use his Magic Powers in this trial and had to rely on his physical strength and Divinities to reach his destination.

‘The journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step,’ William thought as he took a step forward. ‘Wait for me, everyone. I’ll be home shortly.’
