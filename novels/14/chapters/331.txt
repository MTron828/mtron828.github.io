Chapter 331: Our Battle Will Be Legendary [Part 1]

-

‘Sun Wukong,’ William thought as he firmly gripped the Monkey King’s hand. The latter then helped him to stand on his own two feet before looking at the Celestial Army that had reformed their ranks.

Clearly, they wouldn’t allow William to pass through the gate without a fight.

“Kid, I’ll take care of the small fries, but you will have to take care of that one over there, okay?” Sun Wukong twirled the golden staff in his hand and pointed at Lugh who stood in front of the Heavenly Gate like a gatekeeper.

“Okay,” William readily agreed.

Sun Wukong patted his shoulder in a casual manner. “Relax, I’ll lend you my power when you fight against him. As long as this King is around, you don’t have to worry about anything.”

Sun Wukong pulled a few hairs from his head and gave William a wink before blowing them off his hand. These strands of hair flew in the air for a brief moment before transforming into exact replicas of the Monkey King.

Zhu and Sha had propped themselves up from the ground while the two had been talking. Although they had received heavy injuries, they glared fearlessly at the Celestial Army in front of them.

The Pig Demon and the Sand Demon raised their weapons high with arrogance. Clearly, they wanted to give the Knights some payback for ganging up on them.

“Let’s go.” Sun Wukong grinned. “Observe carefully, William. You need to understand how my abilities work.”

William nodded his head as he ran behind the Monkey King and his clones.

Within his status page, the name of Sun Wukong shone brightly in golden bold letters.

This meant that the Monkey King had been registered under his Heroic Avatar Skill. What did this mean? It meant that he could use the Monkey King’s abilities for a short period of time when he activates the Heroic Avatar Skill.

William noticed some distinct changes in the description of the skill. Before, the description of the Heroic Avatar only lasted for fifteen minutes and could be used once a day. Now, it could be used for an hour and had a cooldown time of one week.

The Half-Elf guessed that the changes in the skill’s description had something to do with the Heroic Spirit that had been registered as his Heroic Avatar.

Even so, he was quite thankful that the Immortal Hero that had appeared before him was quite powerful. William focused his attention on the Monkey King’s fighting style so that he would be able to utilize his Hero’s strength when he activated his Heroic Avatar.

The Monkey King’s Clones rampaged across the battlefield. The golden staves in their hands extended several meters long as they swept across the battlefield, while doing their monkey antics.

Shouts of pain and helplessness erupted throughout the Celestial Army as the overpowered Monkey King swaggered towards the Heavenly Gate, sending anyone who stood in his way flying in every direction.

“Devastate all that stands in my way!” Sun Wukong ordered. “Ryu! Jingu! Bang!”

The golden staff in Sun Wukong’s hand grew in size until it was three hundred meters long and over two metres thick. The Monkey King slammed it against the ground, creating a powerful shockwave that blew all the Celestial Knights away.

It was as if he had parted the Sea with that strike, allowing himself, William, Zhu, Sha and his clones to pass through the defenders with ease.

Lily giggled as she cheered for the Monkey King’s one-sided massacre that offered no mercy to his enemies. The Loli Goddess had been raring to rampage a few minutes ago, but David had prevented her from descending to the Heavenly Domain.

After the appearance of Sun Wukong, her anger disappeared completely and she was now cheering for the monkey wholeheartedly. As for Issei, he had a smile on his face as he nodded his head in satisfaction.

Just like Lily, the Harem God had been itching for a battle, but he put it aside for now since the most Troublesome Monkey in the Celestial World had appeared on the battlefield.

The Jade Emperor sighed as he watched Sun Wukong laugh out loud as he brute forced his way through the sea of defenders. It reminded him of the time when the Monkey King had defied his decree and fought off the Heavenly Army of his Jade Palace.

‘I almost pity the Celestial Knights, but this battle is far from over,’ the Jade Emperor thought as he looked at Lugh who seemed mildly amused by Sun Wukong’s dominant performance.

Just like everyone else, Lugh had restrictions that were applied to him when he entered the Heavenly Domain. If Sun Wukong’s rank was at the peak of a Saint, Lugh’s rank was that of a Myriad Beast at its Peak

Saints would always be weaker than Myriad Beasts, but the Monkey King didn’t shy away from fighting against strong opponents. This was why the Heavenly Army had lost repeatedly against him in the past.

Sun Wukong was practically one of the most Invincible Beings in all of creation because his body couldn’t be damaged by anything.

Although he wasn’t a God, he was still a force to reckon with. Not to mention, his weapon, Ryu Jingu Bang, was capable of injuring, and dealing lethal damage to, Gods.

After an hour of intense fighting, the majority of the Celestial Knights were lying on the ground, unconscious. The surviving knights knew that it was a hopeless battle, so they decided to stand aside and let the King, who had been given the title Heaven’s Equal, to pass unimpeded.

Sun Wukong didn’t make things hard for the Knights who refused to fight and let them be. Soon, they arrived in front of the Heavenly Gate where the God of the Sun, Lugh, was waiting for them.

“Alright, you’re up, Kid,” Sun Wukong said as he handed his golden staff to William. “Knock his teeth out!”

William nodded and accepted Ryu Jingu Bang from Sun Wukong. The moment he held the weapon in his hand, he could feel an overwhelming strength wash over his body. The Monkey King turned into particles of light and flew towards William’s chest, merging with him.

All of William’s injuries recovered at an astonishing rate as if he had drunk one of Jekyll’s regeneration potions.

Lugh held his shield in his left hand, and a red spear in his right. A sneer was plastered on his face as he pointed his weapon in William’s direction.

William snorted as he twirled the golden staff in his hand. A metallic ding echoed across the battlefield as he slammed the staff on the ground.

“Finally a worthy opponent,” Lugh declared. “Our Battle will be Legendary!”

William ignored his words, as he pointed the tip of the golden staff at Lugh’s face.

“No, B*tch. It’s Clobbering Time!”
