191 New Job

Three days later, Eli returned to the iris campsite with the girl.

After another five days, he returned to the White Tower in a low-key manner.

It was also a week later that Kratos was surprised to find that Eli had returned and asked to meet him.

As soon as they met, Kratos’s eyes kept glancing at Eli and asked, “Herman, were you the Warlock who appeared in the capital?” he asked.

Eli shook his head.

Of course, he knew what Kratos was going to say. In fact, since the incident in the capital, the news about a Mystical Warlock had spread throughout the entire southern area of the White Tower. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

A third-circle undead was easily suppressed by a single person. This made many southern forces feel terrified. Was there actually a third-circle mage here?

Who was he?

What was his purpose?

Which force did he come from?

Everything was like a riddle. Everyone only knew the man’s face.

“Alright, it can’t be you.” Kratos’ expectant eyes dimmed. If Eli were a third-circle warlock, it would mean a lot.

Whether it was for the White Tower or the entire South of the West Coast, it was a heavy bomb, but the possibility was indeed not strong. After all, the information about breaking through to the third circle on the south coast was confidential. Even if Kratos wanted to break through to the third circle, he did not know the way.

“That person really wasn’t me. I was gathering resources in another place at the time, and I didn’t know who it was. I can’t believe such a powerful person has appeared within our sphere of influence. I suggest that we immediately investigate this matter thoroughly.” Eli pursed his lips and gave a suggestion.

“Yes.” Kratos nodded. He would definitely investigate.

“That’s it then. Compared to this, it’s better to keep stabilizing the White Tower’s position. After the blood alliance disappeared, many new small forces appeared in this area. These forces have to be dealt with. It’s better not to have any unstable factors in our territory.” Eli changed the topic.

“Indeed. We’ve been issuing ultimatums to them. People are filling up the prison every day.” Kratos rubbed his temples and looked at Eli. “the prison has to be rebuilt, but we lack a person to guard it. Do you have any recommendations? ”

Eli, “???”

Why did they suddenly talk about prison?

However…

Eli fell into deep thought. This seemed to suit him a little. Although he had Nikola collecting spirits outside, he couldn’t meet up with him often.

Wouldn’t it be better if there was a long-term stable stream of souls?

It just so happened that the White Tower, as a growing force, was constantly fighting and expanding. Naturally, there would be an endless stream of warlocks being sent to prison. Wasn’t this place just right for Eli?

At the thought of this, his eyes gradually became serious, and he said to Kratos, “There is indeed a person.”

“Who is it?” Kratos asked curiously.

“Me!”

“You?”

“Yes, me.”

Kratos’ eyes widened as he looked at Eli and asked, ” why are you interested in this? This position is very troublesome. Besides, you already have a position. Will this affect your own progress? ”

“It’s alright. The main thing is that the White Tower is currently lacking in manpower. As an honorary member of the White Tower, I naturally have to bear more responsibility. This matter is settled then.” Eli said righteously.

Kratos, on the other hand, gasped. He looked at Eli and was a little touched.

“Mm, I knew you still loved the White Tower.” Kratos nodded.

“Let’s talk about it in the next meeting.”

“Alright,” he said.

..

Another month passed.

The White Tower’s new prison was built. It was a tall tower with 12 floors and a large number of underground prisons equipped with a large number of defenses. It was called the Black Tower prison and was built in the forest not far from the White Tower.

The person in charge of this place was the honorary Deputy representative of the White Tower, Herman.

For a moment, many people were shocked. After all, this place didn’t have any benefits. Instead, the person in charge had to spend a lot of time and effort. This made many people admire Herman even more.

As for Eli …

“Cool!”

In a large prison, Eli had devoured a Warlock who was about to be executed.

Looking at the fallen Warlock, although his mental strength was not as good as a mage’s, the thought of having a steady stream of resources in the future made Eli’s mood much better.

And it was not just souls. The corpses of warlocks could be used to cultivate blood bamboo flowers, while their bones could be refined into skeletons.

At this time, he realized that he had made a good decision. This was the most suitable place for him to live at the current stage.

After dealing with it, Eli walked out of prison and looked ahead.

Warlocks were locked up in rows of prisons. Most of them were apprentices, but there would occasionally be a first circle Warlock among them. They looked at Eli with fear.

Everyone had heard the screams in prison.

This Warden even tortured prisoners on death row. Did he have any humanity?

On the other hand, Eli had a smile on his face as he returned to the top floor. He had already moved everything he had here, and he planned to hand over the magical plants management to Ross, then develop here in peace.

He needed to become stronger.

..

In the blink of an eye, a year had passed.

In the past year, Eli had assigned the task of resource allocation to a few of his men, the most important part of which was assigned to Ross. He was also in charge of the contact with the iris camp.

...

As for Eli, he stayed in the prison at ease, enjoying the resources from the White Tower every day, as well as the prisoners who were about to die and be killed in prison. All these allowed his mental power to grow at a steady pace.

And Nikola.

This guy had also reached the area north of the White Tower and started a new business.

In fact, Nikola was very powerful. With a large number of undead, he could even help Eli reach the third circle soon. This allowed him to act as he pleased in this area. He quickly established a new undead force, the house of the undead.

The establishment of the house of the undead attracted the attention of several major forces.

A new round of probing had begun, and several forces had fought with him, but they had all been defeated by Nikola.

Even the White Tower had noticed this force, which made Kratos a little nervous because the house of the undead was not far from the White Tower. But to his surprise, although the house of the undead often invaded other places, they never set foot here. This made him a little confused, but he also realized something.

The undead was definitely afraid of the three-ring warlock that had appeared earlier. Of course, there was also one thing that puzzled him, and that was why the third-circle warlock had let the undead go.

He didn’t understand.

..

Nikola was only a part of it.

...

The iris campsite.

The little girl, Katarina, had also received a wizard’s education. He was surprised to find out that this little girl’s talent was really good. By now, she had already become a level 1 wizard apprentice under the guidance of Tijie, and she was now being trained as the future leader.

Everything was changing, and the master of the storm, Eli, was lying on the bench leisurely.

To him, whether it was Nikola or the others, they were all external resources. The most important thing was himself.

He had a deeper understanding of the devouring rune recently. He was prepared to study it further. It was not just to prepare for the third seal. He wanted to see if the seal could unleash other powers.

“I’ll take it slow.”

Eli got up from the recliner, walked to the window, and looked at the White Tower in the distance.

In a short hundred years, the White Tower had grown from nothing to a powerful force. What about a hundred years later?

What would this place look like a hundred years later?
