281 The Crumbling Line of Defense

“Heavens, what kind of magical beast is this?!”

“This aura is too terrifying. It doesn’t feel like it’s a three-circle creature anymore.”

“So many shadows! This is ridiculous!”

In the campsite, all the warlocks stared with wide eyes, their hearts filled with fear. The magic beast in front of them did not belong to them, but its aura was ridiculously high.

The magical beasts weren’t any better!

The weak magical beasts were even trembling, and even those third-circle beasts were staring at Hydra as if they did not understand when such a powerful magical beast had arrived!

“What the hell is that?!”

Sancher stood on the ground and looked at the giant snake on the mountain opposite him.

He could even clearly see the cold eyes of the giant snake, as well as the huge snake-like body that was wrapped around the tree.

Although it was dozens of meters long, the sense of oppression it brought was something that Sancher had only felt when he met master Klay. Although he was definitely not as strong as master Klay, the creature was stronger than the limit third circle warlock he had seen!

this feeling … Shadow!

Sancher’s heart beat faster, but as he looked at the shadows spreading around him, he inexplicably thought of someone.

Herman!

It was the same shadow, and it had appeared on the battlefield between the two forces. Furthermore, it had captured the cores of the magical beast and killed them. It was as if its purpose was to release them from their control over the soul slaves.

It was hard for him not to think of that man!

However, now was not the time to think about this. They had to get through this difficulty first!

“That’s not right!” Suddenly, Sancher’s consciousness shifted and he looked at the magical beasts that covered the mountains and Plains.

Other than the eight core beasts, there were still twenty of them in the third circles, as well as other beasts. Including him, there were still two third ring warlocks and thousands of demonic beasts!

What was he afraid of?

It should be the giant snake that was afraid!

Sancher’s mood gradually recovered.

He took out the token and sent his will to the seven or eight cores through it. Then, his will spread to the rest of the beasts.

His will also brought the recovery of the magical beasts. One by one, the magical beasts also recovered their will and revealed their bloodthirsty instincts. This was another function of the token.

One of the characteristics of soul slaves was absolute obedience!

Seven to eight third-circle magic beasts flew into the sky and headed toward Hydra. The powerful force drove the elements in the surroundings, and more than ten magic beasts attacked together.

Hydra looked at this scene, and a playful expression flashed through his dark eyes.

He stretched his body, and his huge body turned into a shadow before he charged toward the magic beast.

Bang! Bang!

Seven to eight third-circle beasts collided with the shadow, and it was as if the space was split into two.

Sancher stood on the mountain and watched the scene nervously.

In the next second, the shadow doubled in size, and like a black hole, it swallowed three demonic beasts. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

When the remaining four magical beasts saw this scene, their eyes revealed their instinctive fear, and they turned around to escape. However, in the next second, the Hydra’s huge body had already arrived, and it directly swallowed the magical beasts!

Gada!

After devouring such a large number of magical beasts, the Hydra let out a ‘ga da’ sound and seemed to be somewhat satisfied.

However, he did not forget his goal. His master wanted him to kill all the cores, and the cores were on the mountain at the moment. So, in just a second, he rushed toward the mountain where Sancher was.

As he watched the magical beast being devoured, Sancher’s back was drenched in a cold sweat!

He had already clearly realized a problem.

The giant snake in front of him was ridiculously strong!

They might not be able to defeat him.

Now, it all depended on whether the numbers could stop the snake!

“Stop it!” The next second, Sancher ordered.

The huge Army of soul slaves charged toward Hydra fearlessly.

Facing the magic beast, the Hydra stopped and raised its three heads high up at the same time. At the same time, a Shadow Black light, a ray of ice, and a scorching hot stream of fire spurted out.

The three of them each attacked in a different direction.

The demonic beasts on the main side melted into the shadows, the beasts caught in the flames were burned to ashes, leaving a black trail on the ground, and the ice directly left an ice path, sealing the demonic beasts in ice.

The attack lasted for more than ten seconds, and by the time it ended, thousands of demonic beasts had been killed or injured!

The corners of Sancher’s mouth twitched.

What kind of magical beast was this?!

However, now was not the time to think about this. Sancher looked at the token in his hand, then at the magical beasts below, and then made a decision.

“All magical beasts, split into three waves and run!” Sancher deeply understood that they might not be able to kill the magical beast in front of them today. It was better for them to run.

As long as one of them escaped, they would still be able to control these soul slaves.

Even though thousands of them had died, there were still tens of thousands of them in the mountain range!

He suddenly regretted not saving them and gathering them together. That might have given them a chance, but that was impossible.

The magical beasts that received the order quickly split into three pairs and flew off in different directions.

...

Sancher and the other warlocks did the same. They immediately followed.

Looking at the three waves of fleeing magic beasts, Hydra let out a roar.

Sancher turned his head to look as he flew.

The other two heads beside the shadow head of Hydra started to separate from the shadow. From the shadow, a fire element snake and an ice element snake appeared.

The Hydra chased after Sancher while the other two giant snakes flew in two different directions.

At this moment, Hydra was already numb!

What kind of magical beast was this? Was it that ridiculous?

However, seeing that the Hydra was about to catch up to them, Sancher also knew that they had no chance. Hence, he turned around and stopped. The other warlocks and magical beasts also stopped.

Since he couldn’t escape, he could only fight!

Sancher’s gaze was firm. Then, everyone rushed toward Hydra.

At this moment, the sun was setting in the West. The brilliant rays of the setting sun shone on the faces of many magical beasts and people, reflecting their tragic expressions. Sancher took the lead, and lightning shot out from his body!

...

The next second, a shadow swept past.

Sancher was swallowed in one bite.

Hydra shook its head as if it didn’t understand why this human had such an emotional expression!

As a Chimera, his emotions were not as abundant as normal magical beasts. All he had were basic emotions and his loyalty and love for Eli!

It seemed to be too complicated. The Hydra was also thinking, but it looked at the other magical beasts!

His eyes were cold.

..

Ten minutes later.

The Hydra was coiled on the mountain, and the fire snake and ice snake returned at the same time from afar. They then merged into his body, and two heads slowly appeared on both sides.

He looked at his surroundings and saw that the magical beasts had already dispersed.

With the death of the last few core magical beasts, the connection that bound them was also broken, and they regained their freedom. They would be enslaved again if someone reconnected their bound connection, but that was very difficult, at least no Warlock could do it!

The Hydra could hear the roars of countless beasts erupting within the mountain range.

The revelry that belonged to them had begun. At this moment, the Holy tower’s defense line was shattered!

On the other hand, Hydra was in a good mood.

The mission was completed. He could go back to his master!

His body slowly shrank, turning into a shadow and flying into the sky.

He returned the way he came, and his speed was extremely fast!

He was like a child who was anxious to go home!
