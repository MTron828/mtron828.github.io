303 70 Years

Time was merciless, and in the blink of an eye, thirty years had passed.

At this moment, Eli’s mental power was already at 420 points. On average, he could barely increase it by one point per year. This was the result of Eli’s talent being considered not too bad.

In the past 30 years, the West Coast had been peaceful.

Eli participated in the silver Moon feast again, but unfortunately, he still didn’t gain anything this time.

In any case, he had already resigned himself to his fate. He understood that it seemed like there was no hope of fishing for the elemental heart by relying on him alone. However, it was precisely because of this reason that a new idea came to Eli’s mind.

He could sense that the effect of the element’s heart on him might really be useless after a few more times. Since he couldn’t fish them, he might as well catch them.

At worst, he would damage the silver Moon Lake.

It was worth it to improve his talent.

As such, Eli was already preparing for the next Silver Moon feast and was going to unleash a brutal wave of attacks.

Other than that, Eli seemed to have heard that the people from the time hourglass had been capturing magical beasts on a large scale recently. He did not know what their goal was, but he was not interested and did not want to know.

..

Thirty years later.

At this time, the bloodline tower had completely ruled the West Coast for almost a hundred years.

Some bad things were also happening.

Because the central continent had almost given up on the West Coast, many people who were wanted by some forces or people who wanted to move from the central continent also set their sights on this land.

One after another, people from the central continent arrived.

Generally speaking, those who were wanted or could cross the mountains to come here were not weak, so they caused a lot of trouble for the West Coast.

Aisha was also very anxious about these people.

Eli also knew about the bloodline tower’s situation, but he didn’t care.

If she couldn’t even control such a situation, he didn’t mind changing the person in charge.

..

Another ten years passed.

The new silver Moon banquet began.

However, the situation was different from before. This time, hundreds of miles around the silver Moon Lake had been cleared.

“This is the last time!”

By the silver Moon Lake, Eli looked at the calm surface of the lake.

At present, the surface of the lake had already begun to tremble slightly. Strands of elements were beginning to erupt. This was the first sign of the silver Moon lake’s first feast, and for this, Eli had already waited fifty years.

At this moment, the silver Moon Lake, which took up a large area, was already filled with dozens of spell formation cores. Even the surroundings of the lake had been enveloped by spell formations.

And all of this was done by Eli.

“Let’s wait,” Eli’s gaze was calm. He knew that today was probably his last time here.

Time passed by quickly.

The familiar scene played out again.

With the countless boiling elements, the elements within a hundred miles of the silver Moon Lake began to gather again. The entire Lake was boiling. Countless fish jumped out of the water and madly swallowed and spat out the elements. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

This time, Eli didn’t take out his fishing rod but instead slowly flew into the sky.

With a wave of his hand, the spell formation core that he had set up in the silver Moon Lake exploded at the same time. Dozens of light pillars shot into the sky. For a moment, the surface of the lake began to undulate, and the elements that had gathered in the surroundings were stirred.

The weak balance of the silver Moon Lake was instantly broken.

A huge Whirlpool appeared in the sky above the silver Moon Lake.

More and more elements were gathering toward the lake. At first, the elements in the area were only a few dozen miles around the silver Moon Lake, but in just an instant, all the elements in a 150-mile radius were gathering toward the silver Moon Lake.

With so many elements gathered, the concentration of elements in the silver Moon Lake was frighteningly high, and even the air had begun to liquidify. This was due to the huge amount of elements and the great pressure of the spell formation. It was impossible to achieve this by relying on nature.

These elements were slowly being poured into the lake.

In an instant, countless fish broke through their bottlenecks.

In just a few minutes, the silver Moon Lake, which originally only had a few third-circle fish, now had dozens of third-circle fish, and the fish that had been hiding in the depths of the silver Moon Lake all came out.

Eli continued to watch calmly.

This step was to lure out most of the fish.

And looking at the human in the sky, some third-circle fish even leaped out of the water, wanting to attack Eli. With a light wave of his hand, countless wind blades tore these fish apart.

“It’s not enough!”

Eli observed the lake and realized that there was still much fish that had yet to come out.

With a thought, the light pillar of the spell formation bloomed again.

More and more elements were gathered and poured into the silver Moon Lake. More fish hidden in the depths of the silver Moon Lake came out one after another and gathered on the surface of the lake.

“It’s almost time!”

After a brief observation, Eli knew it was time.

His spiritual force was connected to the spell formation on the shore.

On the riverbank, hundreds of stone pillars that were more than three meters tall slowly emerged. Elemental threads slowly appeared and began to link together to form a huge elemental net, fishing up the surface of the lake.

This was what Eli was planning to do.

...

Looking at the huge fishing net, countless fish leaped up high as if they wanted to escape. However, Eli would not let them have their way. Another layer of fishing net appeared once again, blocking their path from above.

The outcome had been decided.

Eli had been preparing for this for decades and had long considered all sorts of possibilities.

He was determined to get it done today.

The fishing process lasted for a whole day.

In the end, Eli found his target among the hundreds of thousands of catties of fish.

There were a total of thirty-six element hearts.

As for the remaining fish, Eli took away some useful ones and had them return to Silver Moon Lake. After all, they were indeed useless.

“But after what I’ve done this time, I’m afraid this place will be useless!”

By the silver Moon Lake, Eli held the thirty-six elemental hearts and looked at the silver Moon lake.

At this time, the special structure of the silver Moon Lake had been destroyed. In the future, there would probably be no more Silver Moon feasts. This place would gradually become an ordinary Lake rich in extraordinary creatures.

...

Eli knew that this wasn’t a good idea, but he didn’t regret it!

As long as his talent improved, it would be worth it.

“Let me see how much my talent can improve this time.” Eli looked at the elemental heart in his hand.

A total of thirty-six fish, far more than the number he had used before.

..

One day later, Eli returned to the black Tower prison.

In the secret realm, Eli began to use the element’s heart.

He had only used five.

Eli’s talent had finally broken through the third grade and reached the second grade.

After consuming it, Eli’s talent was raised to the limit of second grade.

It wasn’t that he didn’t want to level up anymore, but the elemental heart was no longer useful.

Unfortunately, he was just a little bit away from first grade.

“I won’t think about this anymore. I’ll just focus on increasing my mental power.”

As his mental energy increased, there was only one thought in his mind.

That was to quickly increase his mental power and then find the information to advance to the celestial realm!
