383 The Arrival of Marsin Quinn

A week later!

In the secret realm, Hill hung down thousands of branches, and countless green branches swayed in the air, emitting a slightly moist life aura. Even the vegetation within a few hundred meters swayed towards her.

At the edge of this area, Eli was holding his breath and looking at the small stone that was dozens of meters tall in front of him.

He was experimenting with the secret technique he had just learned.

Taking a deep breath, Eli circulated the blood in his body. In the next second, the sound of his blood surged as the waves of the sea rang in Eli’s ears. The blood in his body seemed to be boiling. Eli felt his temperature rising rapidly, and even his skin was turning red!

In this state, Eli felt that his attacks could at least double!

Level 1 Explosive Blood!

“Not enough!” Eli muttered to himself and continued to operate.

His blood flowed even faster, and even the air around him was filled with blood, and the temperature was visibly rising.

Level two Explosive Blood!

It was twice as powerful, but at this moment, Eli could already feel that his bloodline was a little out of control.

“Continue!” Eli didn’t pay attention to this. This wasn’t his limit.

As the blood flow accelerated again, Eli’s eyes instantly turned red. The blood mist that rose around his body almost completely enveloped him. His bloodline was like a violent dragon swimming around in his body. He was about to lose control. This time, Eli was definitely at his limit.

Taking a deep breath, Eli stretched out his right hand, and a faint trace of wind element appeared.

“No, I have to dilute it!”

Eli shook his head. In the next second, the wind element on his fingertips became much thinner, almost invisible.

This was the smallest unit he could control.

In the next second, the buffs from the third level of Explosive Blood instantly gathered toward the Wind Element. In just an instant, Eli felt his blood gathering towards this wisp of the element. Then, under Eli’s dumbfounded gaze, the Wind Element turned into a few meters in the blink of an eye, emitting a sharp aura.

In the next second, the wind element floated forward and directly collided with the boulder!

In an instant, Eli only saw endless wind elements wrapping around the huge rock in front of him, tearing it apart like countless wind blades. In the blink of an eye, the nearly 30-meter-tall huge rock disappeared from Eli’s eyes, and there were no stone fragments flying in the air.

This was because the stone fragments were too fine, so fine that they could not be seen by the naked eye. Even Eli had to look carefully to see some traces.

” A threefold enhancement is indeed very powerful! ”

Eli pursed his lips. Without the support of a secret technique, that wisp of wind element could only cut through rocks at most, but it would definitely not reach such a level.

If he could reach a higher level, the power would naturally be stronger.

However, three times was already his current limit. It was too difficult to control his blood which was boiling to the extreme. However, the loss of life was very small. It might not even be a year, and he would not feel anything.

“However, this is also very important for the improvement of combat strength!”

Eli stretched his body. Three times the power might not seem like much, but it might be able to save his life at a critical moment.

“But…”

Eli looked at the huge rock in front of him. The secret realm was too small, and he did not dare to use his full strength.

“Looks like I need to go to a place with no one to test it out!”

Eli pursed his lips.

Such a small dose test could be used as a reference for a large-scale battle.

He needed a more precise test.

“Let’s go to the Savon Mountain Range!”

Eli remembered the place from the last time. It was remote and deserted, and it was the best place for testing.

Just do it!

Eli packed up and left the secret realm. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

….

Savon Mountain Range.

A blackish-purple blood aura streaked across the mountain range and headed in a direction.

But suddenly, the blackish-purple blood essence slowly stopped and dissipated, revealing a man inside.

He had a tall body and wore a dark purple striped Warlock robe. His skin was very white, and his face was very handsome, but his eyes were a little dark. He was a very handsome Warlock, but at this moment, his face was filled with doubt.

“This mountain range is too wide!” Marsin Quinn frowned.

This was the first time he had come to this area. Although he had looked at the map, he still could not find the way!

“Maybe I should ask a Warlock for directions!”

He thought about it, but he soon realized another problem. This place was deserted. Where could he find someone?

“Eh?”

Suddenly, as if sensing something, Marsin turned his head to the right and saw a blood-colored shadow streaking across the sky.

“Third circle warlock!”

Marsin’s eyes lit up. Wasn’t this what he was looking for?

He immediately chased after him. At the same time, the aura of a Radiant Moon instantly enveloped the new Warlock. The new Warlock instantly froze on the spot, and the surrounding blood-red light gradually dissipated.

In a few seconds, he arrived in front of the Warlock.

“More handsome than me?” Marsin was a little unhappy and asked directly, “Which faction are you from? Name?”

Marsin’s eyes were filled with indifference. To a True Spirit, a third-circle warlock was like an ant.

...

“I’m from the Bloodline Tower. My name is Herman.” Eli looked at the Warlock and replied.

Originally, he didn’t want to bother with peak Radiant Moon Warlocks, but he was actually stopped!

” Bloodline Tower? That’s great! ” Marsin’s eyes lit up and he continued to ask, “Tell me everything you know about the Bloodline Tower, especially about Eli. ”

Marsin smiled. He didn’t expect his luck to be so good. He had directly met a third-circle Warlock from the Bloodline Tower. It seemed that he could save a lot of trouble. Moreover, a third-circle Warlock was not bad in the Bloodline Tower. He probably knew a lot about the faction, which saved him a lot of effort!

Of course, he would kill the Warlock after asking. After all, this was a secret operation!

Ignoring the smiling Warlock, Eli’s sharp celestial instinct allowed him to sense the killing intent that was inadvertently revealed.

Eli’s heart skipped a beat. Who would provoke them at this time? And he was a peak Radiant Moon Warlock.

In the blink of an eye, Eli had already made a big guess about the Warlock’s identity. The Warlock’s bloodline seemed a little cold, which indirectly confirmed Eli’s guess.

Thinking of this, the smile on Eli’s face grew wider. He said to Marsin, “Do you admire Sir Eli too? ”

“Yes, yes, yes. “Marsin nodded.

” You want to go to the Bloodline Tower to see Sir Eli, right? But Sir Eli isn’t someone who anyone can meet.” Eli frowned.

...

Marsin frowned.

How is this guy so slow?

” How about this? If you can withstand one of my attacks, I’ll tell you all about Sir Eli. I’ll also tell you some information about Sir Ely. I’m his personal guard, so I know a lot! ” Eiy looked at the stranger in front of him with ” scrutiny “!

“Of course!” Marsin nodded. He had decided to kill this Warlock once he learned about Eli.

What an annoying Warlock.

Eli flew a little further away. Marsin nodded, but he didn’t care.

He was a peak Radiant Moon, so what if he took one attack from this puny third-circle warlock?

However, he still did a little ostentatious work. A dark purple and blood-red barrier formed in front of him.

He raised his head and stretched out his hand towards the distant Eli.

“Attack me!”
