359 Each Showing Their Abilities

Along with Purple Sand’s death.

The illusion around him was completely dispelled, and Eli had also dispelled his bloodline body.

This was also the first time he used his full strength. It could be considered a test of his strength.

“I wonder how Hydra and Nikola are doing.” Eli looked at the two battlefields not far away.

!!

This time, it was indeed enough for him to do it alone, but he still wanted to see the strength of the Undead and Chimera. After all, some things could not be obtained from laboratory data alone. In fact, over the years, he had tried to use some things to increase their strength.

Nikola was an undead mage, while Hydra was a product of mage technology.

…..

On the battlefield of Nikola.

The huge Mountain Giant waved his staff and chased away the countless undead in the surroundings. However, he saw even more undead, and they drowned him like an ocean. From time to time, there would be undead spells attacking him, but they were all blocked by him.

“Damned rat, get out here! You’re dead once I catch you, ” the Mountain Giant said loudly. ” I’ll see how much longer you can last.”

If it weren’t for these spirits, he would have killed Nikola already.

Although Nikola’s methods were indeed different from ordinary undead, so what?

Just relying on these undead would not be able to cause any harm to him. Moreover, he was a star warlock. How could he lose? DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

After killing a large number of undead again, he suddenly saw the undead in front of him suddenly disperse, and an even larger undead appeared.

“Why aren’t you running anymore? You can’t take it anymore, right?” The mountain giant looked at Nikola and revealed a cruel smile.

“No, it’s time to end this.” Nikola shook his head and slowly picked up a staff. This was the staff that Eli had eliminated.

Waving his club, the Mountain Giant suddenly felt a little uncomfortable. He lowered his head and saw that every crack in his body had shattered Undead fragments. At this moment, these fragments suddenly fused together.

“What is this?” The Mountain Giant Warlock was shocked and furious.

” Fragments of the undead you killed. ” Nikola calmly looked at the Mountain Giant Warlock and said, “Mages have a very important rule, which is to use the least amount of power to generate the most power.

“Now, please experience my new spell, Soul Bomb!”

Nikola waved his staff, and in the next second, the countless soul fragments on the Mountain Giant’s body began to glow. At first, they were gray, but after a few seconds, they were as bright as the sun.

“No!” The Mountain Giant Warlock instinctively felt that something was wrong.

Bang!

In the next second, countless Soul Bombs instantly detonated, and the Soul Power from the explosions gathered together, causing the surrounding Soul Fragments to explode and resonate. The Undead shockwave even spread to a few kilometers nearby, and the weak creatures in the surroundings even directly shattered their souls and died.

The Mountain Giant also fell to the ground with a bang, returning to its original appearance and losing its life force.

Nikola won!

…

The gigantic Blazing Lion was entangled by the Hydra, but countless flames erupted and continuously destroyed the Hydra’s body.

“How many more seconds can you last?” The Blazing Lion Warlock had a ferocious expression on his face.

As long as he could break free, the Hydra would be dead for sure. Such a binding attack would not have much effect on him.

However, in the next second, he felt that the binding became much weaker. He lowered his head and saw that Hydra’s body had suddenly transformed into four large snakes that were coiling around his body.

“Foolish!” The Blazing Lion Warlock cursed in his heart.

However, in the next second, the four giant snakes that were entangled began to spin at the same time. They spread out in all directions and then opened their mouths.

In each mouth was a huge energy core, which was composed of fire, ice, shadow, and wind.

This was nothing, but the Blazing Lion Warlock saw that every core was engraved with complicated patterns.

“This is a Mage’s spell formation rune! “He has a bad feeling.

In the next second, the four cores merged into one, and a huge spell formation covered Blazing Lion and Hydra. Then, they were enveloped by a four-colored light.

A few seconds later, the light dissipated.

Hydra’s huge body appeared, and the Blazing Lion Warlock’s corpse lay beside it.

Hydra won!

…..

The battle ended.

Hydra and Nikola each dragged the corpses of two Warlocks as they flew toward Eli.

“Not bad.” Eli nodded.

Nikola and Hydra had only advanced for less than ten years, yet they had already defeated two Star Warlocks. This was not bad.

“It’s all thanks to you, sir. When I was constructing this spell, you helped me a lot. Without you, there wouldn’t even be this new spell system.” Nikola smiled.

He was telling the truth. Indeed, Eli had helped him a lot.

“Your own hard work is also indispensable.” Eli smiled.

Hydra, who was beside him, also came over. His spell formation was imprinted by Eli.

“Perhaps you can try to use your own spell formation in the future!” Eli said.

Then, he turned to Nicholas. ” Go and search their belongings. These Warlocks have just died. You can devour their souls to replenish yourself. As for their flesh, give it to Hydra. He’s seriously injured. ”

Under Eli’s orders, Nikola quickly devoured the souls of the four of them. His Soul Power was quickly replenished, and there was still a lot of excesses. He believed that after completely absorbing them, he would improve to a certain extent. Hydra’s injuries had also recovered, but its strength did not increase much.

Unlike Nikola, who could become stronger by devouring souls, Hydra’s advancement required a large number of elemental items. This was also what Eli needed to prepare for the future.

During this period of time, Eli also obtained the dead warlocks’ interspatial rings.

...

After a round of inspection, there were quite a few things, but there was almost nothing that could be used.

There was only a piece of skin from an unknown fourth-circle magic beast. Because it was of the wind element, it could be used to refine a mage tool with the feathers from before.

After settling everything, Nikola and Hydra entered the secret plane while Eli headed for the airship.

The moment he went up.

Oscar and Alida came over.

The two of them were also shocked when the airship stopped flying. Then, they sensed a terrifying fluctuation not far away.

And since Eli wasn’t in the room, it was hard not to make the connection.

“Sir, what happened?” The two of them asked.

” Nothing much. I went out to test my strength. Let’s continue. ” With that, Eli returned to his room.

Oscar and Alida looked at each other.

A few seconds later.

...

“Since Milord says it was a test, then it should be fine. Let’s continue.”

He left immediately, leaving only Alida behind.

The terrifying commotion just now appeared in Alida’s mind. She could feel the terrifying fluctuations from dozens of kilometers away.

Was that just a test of sorcery?

She didn’t dare to ask.

Soon, Alida returned to her room.

The airship started to move normally and left this area at high speed.

…..

Half a day after Eli left.

As the sun rose slightly.

From afar, a giant eagle flew over. A woman was sitting on it. She wore a black scarf and a black warlock robe. She looked dignified and elegant, like an elegant queen.

She was Liliana’s teacher, Lobelia, a Radiant Moon Warlock. After communicating with Liliana, she also felt that Eli was a good candidate for the Charm Mansion, so she came to look for him.

Eh?

Suddenly, she looked into the distance and knocked on the giant eagle beneath her. “Go there!”

The giant eagle flew very quickly and arrived at the spot she had designated.

When she reached her destination, she looked down and was instantly stunned.

The ground under the giant eagle had been completely destroyed. Several mountains had been pierced through, and some had been flattened. The ground was filled with fallen trees, and many of them had even turned black. Their vitality had completely disappeared.

The most ridiculous thing was that in the central area, there was a deep pit that was 100 meters deep. Although the area was not large, the cracks that spread from it were a few kilometers long.

“What happened here?” Lobelia was a little confused.

She carefully sensed the aura here.”There seem to be seven celestial auras. No, there seems to be more. The auras are different, and there are also non-humans.”

She was a little confused, and the smell was very fresh, which meant that this had happened less than three days ago.

“Looks like there’s a huge battle going on here. That’s not right. According to the time, Eli’s airship might have passed by here at that time. Could it be … ” Lobelia gasped. “It can’t be.”

Her heart was beating fast, and her full chest was heaving up and down.

If she wanted to verify this matter, she needed to find Eli to verify it.

“What is going on?”

Lobelia regained her composure.

A few seconds later, the giant eagle sped up and left the place, chasing after Eli’s airships.
