355 The Reaction of All Sides

Just as the airship was leaving.

On a mountain five kilometers away from Four Seasons Garden.

The five Warlocks stared at the departing airship. There were three men and two women, and they were all dressed luxuriously. However, they did not look young, and each of them was celestial. They belonged to the factions closest to the Four Seasons Garden and were the strongest experts of each faction.

However, at this moment, a few of them heaved a sigh of relief as they watched the airship leave. It was as if the devil had left.

“Hey, hey, he finally left.” One of the old Warlocks clutched his chest.

” Indeed. Old Bena died so easily. I wonder who that Warlock is. He looks kind, but his methods are so powerful. ” Another old woman in a purple robe nodded in agreement.

The others also expressed their opinions, but they were much more relaxed.

A few days ago, they had already noticed Four Seasons Garden’s fanfare.

Although they were very curious about what they were up to, the Four Seasons Garden was usually very well-behaved, so they didn’t pay any attention to them. However, when they felt the fluctuations from the battle between the celestials, everyone was shocked.

When they arrived at the Four Seasons Garden and learned of what had happened, they were even more dumbfounded.

Old Bena had been slapped to death.

The surrounding forces were actually about the same, and they felt that they were not much stronger than Old Bernard.

If this man wanted to attack them, no one could stop him.

They were naturally afraid.

As a result, the five factions automatically joined forces, but fortunately, the powerful Warlock did not seem to have any other thoughts. After collecting the Four Seasons Garden’s resources, he left.

“I’ve already found out the reason. The Manticore Clan seems to want the airship, so they ordered the Four Seasons Garden to stop them.” A Warlock shook his head.

” I see. Then they must have underestimated the strength of this team. ” The Warlock beside him shook his head.

“I have another interesting piece of news. Do you want to hear it?” Suddenly, the old man who spoke first raised his head and asked, his expression a little unnatural. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“Tell us.” They were naturally very interested.

” This group of people is a branch tower of the Bloodline Tower. They seem to be here to help the main tower. ” The old man enunciated each word with a pause. Even his eyes were filled with confusion.

As soon as he finished speaking.

The others did not speak either. Clearly, this was a possibility that they had never thought of.

As for the Bloodline Tower, wasn’t it a force on the same level as them?

” No wonder the Manticore Family noticed them. Didn’t they have a conflict with the Bloodline Family because of the lack of resources? ” A Warlock suddenly understood, but then he changed the topic.” I wonder if they know that the Bloodline Tower’s branch has such strength. ”

“Obviously not.” A Warlock said.

The others looked at each other and nodded in tacit understanding.

How could a normal sub-tower have such strength?

” The manticore must be very angry right now. It lost a subordinate force just like that and a resource-based force at that. ” The old man mocked.

This time, the manticore’s act of snatching resources had made them, who were also the leaders of small forces, feel a sense of sorrow.

They even hoped that the manticore would fail, but it was clearly impossible.

Even if the Warlock had killed Bena, Bena was already very old, and his strength had declined. Eli was probably at the Nebula level, which was stronger than Bena. However, the manticore had a radiant moon warlock.

There was no chance of winning.

As soon as this topic was brought up, a few of them felt a little depressed. After chatting for a while, they left one after another and went back to their homes.

…

“What?”

In a Mage Tower of the Manticore Family, Wellington jumped down from his chair after a cry of surprise.

At this moment, there was a third circle Warlock standing not far from him, but this Warlock’s face was covered in a cold sweat.

“Repeat what you just said.” Wellington walked up to the Warlock and pulled him up.

“My lord!” Under the aura of the celestial, the Warlock felt as if his entire body was being pricked by countless needles. He trembled and said, “Sir, Four Seasons Garden’s Bena died and most of their resources were taken away. It was that tower’s doing.”

Bang!

The Warlock was thrown out and smashed into the wall.

“Damn it!” Wellington cursed and slammed his palm on the table, causing it to shatter.

He had never expected such a thing to happen.

In his opinion, it should be very easy for a celestial to deal with a sub-tower, but they were actually killed, and most of their resources were plundered.

The most ridiculous thing was, why would a branch have a celestial Warlock and a Bloodline Tower at that?

Was this reasonable?

This didn’t make sense.

However, since it had already happened, it was time for him to think about how to remedy it.

He couldn’t tell Jerre or Lady Jalin about this matter. After all, the Four Seasons Garden was the most important supplier of magical plants to the Manticore Clan. A large number of magical plants were still very important to the Manticore Clan. According to the rules, he shouldn’t have let the Four Seasons Garden take action, but it just so happened that the Four Seasons Garden was nearby. Who would have thought that such a thing would happen?

“The unknown warlock might be a Star or Nebula Warlock. ” Wellington guessed.

He was a Nebula Warlock, but it was still not enough to deal with this unknown enemy.

Thinking of this, he looked at the Warlock who had just gotten up and said, “Immediately go to the Lilias Warlock Clan, Harma Warlock Academy, and the Mercury Clan. Inform their celestials to come to me. I have something to discuss with them.”

Wellington named three subsidiary forces of the Manticore in one breath. Each of them had a celestial warlock and was on the same level as the Bloodline Tower.

Since he couldn’t win the battle alone, what about the three of them?

...

He wanted to take back everything that Eli had taken away.

“Yes, my lord.” The Warlock clutched his chest and lowered his head.

“Keep it a secret. Don’t let others know.”

Wellington did not want those people to know about his failure for the time being. He would wait until he made up for his mistakes.

“Yes!”

The Warlock nodded and left.

Seeing the Warlock leave, Wellington looked at the messy house and felt unhappy.

It’s all this bullshit tower’s fault!

Branch towers, my ass, even the main tower isn’t this powerful.

…..

Hermes City.

...

In a room.

The room was luxurious. The floor was covered with soft earth demon bear skin, and there was a big bed in the middle. The surrounding walls were hung with purple or pink silk, and the air was filled with a pleasant perfume smell.

Liliana was standing on the floor with bare feet. She was only wearing simple undergarments, and her fair skin was exposed. She was holding an open letter. Her purple eyes blinked and her pink lips were wide open.

” Eli easily killed Four Seasons Garden’s celestial Bena, then plundered a large number of resources and left. Estimated strength: Nebula level. ”

“Is he that powerful?”

Liliana put away the envelope.

Ever since meeting Eli, she had been using the huge information network of the Charm Mansion to observe the whereabouts of the airship. After all, he was the celestial she wanted to rope in.

” Looks like he’s a little stronger than I thought. Looks like I need to raise my rating. ” Liliana pondered. ” Not enough. Even so, he still isn’t a match for the manticore. It seems that we need to ask my teacher for help. If we protect him at this critical moment, we should be able to get him to join us. ”

Liliana seemed to have thought of something and smiled.

She was already at the limit of the third circle, and she was now lacking credit. Perhaps the opportunity to break through was with Eli.

Thinking of this, she immediately picked up the letter and lay on the bed. She crossed her fair legs and began to write.

A few minutes later, she finished writing the letter.

She put on her clothes and left the room.

Outside the room, a maid stood at the side.

“Help me send this letter to my teacher!” Liliana handed the letter to the maid.

“Yes!” The maid nodded and left quickly.

Not long after, a flying eagle left Holmes City.

In the castle’s main tower, Amanta watched as Eagle left the Charm Mansion and returned to his room.

“Eli, Eli!”

He wiped the cold sweat off his forehead. At the same time, he found out about Eli.

This guy was indeed hiding his strength.

He was probably the one who killed Clint.

How sinister!

Amanta sighed deeply.

He was lucky.
