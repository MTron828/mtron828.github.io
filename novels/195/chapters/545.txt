546 Two Years

Spring passed and winter came, summer passed and autumn came!

Time passed. In the blink of an eye, two years had passed.

In the time world fragment, Eli sank into the space of consciousness.

On the huge tree of laws, countless leaves of laws swayed, and nearly 5,000 flowers of laws adorned it. Most of them were black and translucent, with a small number of them gray. Finally, there were other flowers of laws of various colors.

Needless to say, the gray leaf came from the black fog. It was the result of his comprehension over the years. He had successfully comprehended this strange law and inherited some of its attributes.

At this moment, he had already stepped into the latter half of the Thousand Flowers stage!

“However, this is the result of devouring several dozen Thousand Leaves and a large amount of the Laws of Time. It took me almost three hundred years to digest it.” Eli calculated silently as if he did not find any loopholes at all.

He was in a time flow that was 200 times faster than normal. How could it be 300 years?

In response, Eli raised his head and looked around. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

In the time world fragment that was like night, the earth was dark, and in the sky, countless time flowed like nebulas. Bolts of timeline lightning were emitted from them, but if one observed carefully, one would realize that the lightning was much sparser than before.

This was all because of Eli!

The massive devouring of time laws severely damaged the unstable origin of the time world fragment, which reduced its effect. Therefore, the original 400 years had been severely reduced.

If Eli continued, the situation would be even more serious.

“But how can I stop?” Eli shook his head.

Putting aside the fact that he was unwilling to give up on this rapid method of leveling up if he did not do so, the effects of the realm would also slowly weaken. This was related to him.

He was already a Thousand Flower Mage, but this place was only a slightly larger time world fragment. When he had just advanced, it did not affect him much, but now that he was getting stronger, he even felt that he would deplete this “world” sooner or later.

This was also the lack of common sense in Eli!

In the past, every fifth circle mage had experienced at least several world wars. They had a clear understanding of the world’s endurance.

However, Eli, who was trapped in the Warlock World for a long time, did not know about this.

“It’s fine. I’m not planning to leave anyway.”

Eli slowly stood up.

“Let’s go out for a walk!” He stretched his body and walked into the teleportation array not far away!

After a burst of light, Eli returned to the mage tower. He did not even feel anything along the way. This was because his bloodline was getting stronger and stronger. At this moment, his evolution progress was close to 8%.

In the distance, Hill’s huge body grew, and countless branches extended down. Hydra stretched lazily under the tree and fell asleep out of boredom. Further away, Nikola sat on the ground, his face strangely wrinkled. Dylan was also there.

Eli’s appearance also attracted the attention of several people. Even Hydra opened its sleepy eyes and slowly crawled toward Eli.

He patted the Hydra’s head and walked down the tree.

First, he looked at Dylan and asked, “How is the Mage Tower?”

“Sir, the Magus Tower has already entered the stage of self-repair. The resources that Sir transported and the dwarves have helped a lot.” Dylan said excitedly.

“Yes.” Eli nodded in satisfaction.

Half a year ago, Eli went out to meet the Dwarf King and was ready to subdue him. At first, he would rather die than submit, but after Eli took him to the Wizard Tower, he directly knelt down and announced his submission.

At present, the dwarves had already entered the mage tower and were currently engaged in restoration work.

“Then what system should we repair first?” Dylan suddenly asked.

“Energy system, weapon system,” Eli said.

Since he couldn’t get out now, these two systems were the most useful.

“Yes, sir!” Dylan nodded again.

After dealing with the mage tower, Eli looked at Nicholas.

Nikola’s wrinkled face still made him feel a little strange.

“Looking at you, did something big happen?” asked Ely.

“Milord, I was originally prepared to call for you, but I didn’t expect Milord to come out first.” Nikola sighed.

“Oh? Tell me in detail.”

Eli took out a recliner and sat down.

“Sir, it’s like this! Three months after my lord left,” Nikola began to report, “the Eternal Life Society made a new move.

“First, they had started large-scale destruction, especially in places that the Bloodline Alliance had not noticed. Of course, this was still within the Alliance’s ability to deal with, so we had not awakened the lord.”

Eli nodded.

If he were woken up by some small issues, then the leadership team would have to be changed.

He wasn’t a nanny.

” The chaos lasted for about two months,” Nikola continued.” A month ago, something big happened. A large number of Liches invaded our territory. They came from the Lich Tower!”

Eli’s eyes changed, and his expression became slightly serious.

” But that’s not a big deal. We still dealt with it quickly, but we discovered something terrifying. The purpose of these Liches was not to invade but to spread the secrets of the Lich transformation!

“They had spread the Lich Transformation Technique to all the people below the fourth circle!” Nikola said through gritted teeth.

The Lich Tower had actually spread the Lich Transformation Technique.

This time, Eli was no longer calm. Then, he saw a crystal ball being handed over by Nikola.

“Sir, this is the technique.”

After receiving the crystal ball, Eli began to read through it.

A few minutes later, Eli quietly put down the crystal ball and looked at Nikola. He sighed and said, “You should have called me earlier.”

This time, Nikola remained silent as if he had made a mistake!

” The transformation of a Lich is like this. There are indeed some delicate processes involved. However, the transformation of a low-level Warlock actually requires a large number of life sacrifices. As time passed, almost everyone had a set of this information.

“A large number of elderly Warlocks wanted to live forever. So…” Eli didn’t expect to encounter such a thing on his first trip, and his rare good mood was gone.

It could be said that the Alliance was in a mess. Countless rituals had begun, and a large number of Liches had secretly switched alliances. There were even celestials occupying cities for worship and rituals, all for the secret of ‘eternality’!

” Sir, we tried to stop them half a month ago. However, once these Liches transform, their souls will be transferred into the phylactery. If we can’t destroy the phylactery, they can’t be killed at all. If we can’t find the phylactery, it’s useless even if we have a fifth circle. This has led to the current situation outside.” Nikola’s face was filled with worry.

“Understood!”

Eli nodded.

He extended his consciousness outside and quickly entered Bloodline City. He discovered that many Warlocks were in a hurry. Many Warlocks were entering the city from both inside and outside as if they were fleeing.

And this was only at Bloodline City. Within hundreds of thousands of kilometers, almost one-third of the cities were covered in blood and flames, and the rest were still in chaos.

If this continued for a few more months, the Bloodline Alliance would probably collapse.

He had only been asleep for half a year, and he was already like this. It was indeed troublesome!

“Sir, we have let you down!” Nikola lowered his head.

Da!

Eli put his hand on his shoulder and said softly, “This is indeed not easy to resolve. You have already done a good job. This is undoubtedly a conspiracy of the Lich Tower.

“Leave the rest to me.”

Nikola hesitated and said, “But Sir, if their phylacteries aren’t destroyed, they will be reborn very soon. Moreover, they are all within the Alliance’s territory. Killing them won’t solve them!”

The system gave him a bonus.

Eli smiled. In the past 200 years, it just so happened that there were new methods to deal with this situation.

Looking at the confident expression on Eli’s face, Nikola was confused.

Could this be resolved?

And this time, the affected area was so large.

At this moment, the lotus of faith on Eli’s right hand flashed. Nikola saw many ” Eli ” slowly appear in front of him and fly in all directions!

That number should be at least a few dozen…

Nikola was stunned.

However, at this moment, Eli seemed as if he didn’t care about anything. He smiled at him and said, “It’s such a good time to bask in the sun. Do you want to join us?”

Nikola hesitated for a few seconds, but when he saw the confident face of Eli, he nodded with difficulty. “Okay!”

The summer wind blew, and the two of them reminisced about the past under the sun.

In the distance, streaks of golden light flew in all directions.
