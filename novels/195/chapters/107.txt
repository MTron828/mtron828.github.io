108 War

“Kill!”

The Knights suddenly moved. The horses under their feet, which had a slight trace of the blood of magical beasts, exhaled heavily. The battle armor on their bodies made them look a little ferocious and terrifying. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The 30 elite Knights who had merged with their bloodline held their weapons. They were like small black dots, blending into the battlefield. They were so unremarkable, so small.

But what shocked everyone was …

!!

The enemies in front of them died in an instant. Each of them was only an Elite Knight, but their explosive power was not something a Knight could withstand.

A few of Vis’ elite Knights saw this and immediately rushed over to help.

“Bryne’s trash, go to hell.” One of the Knights held a sharp sword and slashed at a person.

Bang!

The sound of swords clashing rang out.

In the man’s disbelieving eyes, he was sent flying off his horse by another Elite Knight. The huge force sent him off his horse.

“How is that possible?” The man couldn’t believe it, but his opponent wouldn’t give him a chance. Another strike.

In the air, he could not stop it at all. He could only watch as the sharp blade cut into his neck, and blood drew an arc.

After the Knights killed him, they didn’t even look at him. The group of Knights continued to advance forward.

Their target was none other than the war chariot where the general of the Vis Kingdom was.

On the other side.

The general’s eyes were wide open when he saw this.

“Who can tell me what the hell is that group of Knights?” The general’s mouth was wide open, and he was stunned.

Was that an advanced Knight?

Which advanced Knight could suppress another advanced Knight so easily?

It had to be a Grand Knight, right?

The general suddenly wanted to take back his words. The thirty people in front of him were like Grand Knights. Who could stop them?

30 Grand Knights.

Don’t be ridiculous. How many Grand Knights did an Empire have? this was completely unreasonable!

Even though he was unwilling to admit it, he was panicking when he saw this group of Knights charging toward him.

“Kill them! Grand Knights, attack!” He shouted.

As for Vis’ side, they only had three grand knights, not counting the general. The general hesitated for a bit before getting on his warhorse and attacking.

Four Grand Knights should be able to take down a group of advanced Knights easily.

…

However, half an hour later.

The general looked at the three Grand Knights who had fallen not far away. He touched the blood on his head and felt like the world was crazy.

He looked up and saw that there were still ten Knights in front of him. Around him, there were tens of hundreds of low-level, intermediate, and advanced Knights who were all dead.

The remaining 10 Knights were also covered in blood. Their black armor had long been stained red with blood. They seemed to have lost their minds at this time as they rushed towards him.

His throat moved slightly. He couldn’t believe the kind of ridiculous thing he had just encountered.

Almost all of these people were on par with Grand Knights. What was more terrifying was that as the battle went on, these people seemed to have taken drugs. They were almost exchanging injuries for injuries, and they were not afraid of death at all.

They were like wild beasts.

He also saw the corpse of a Knight not far away. He saw horns sticking out of the corpse’s head. The general thought he was dreaming.

However, when he saw the ten red-eyed, bleeding Knights with broken arms charging at him, everything seemed real.

He considered his own situation.

The general took a deep breath and closed his eyes.

“Mother, please protect me.”

When he opened his eyes again, he picked up his sword and rushed over.

Ten minutes later.

The general looked at the five swords in his chest and one of the Knights in close proximity. His helmet had been knocked off, and there were two gray-white horns on his head.

“There’s really a horn!”

The general let out a sound as if he had suddenly realized something. The next second, he lost all signs of life.

At the same time.

All the soldiers had been watching the Knights from a distance for a long time. As Vis’ general died, Vis’ army side immediately lost their momentum, while Bryne’s army cheered.

The counterattack began.

At the same time.

A few miles away.

Bryne’s Earl was riding a horse when he heard the voice behind him. He was puzzled for a moment, but the next second, he ran even faster.

Bryne had won the war, but he had lost the battle, so he had to run quickly and not get caught.

…

The next day.

The news of Vis’ defeat was instantly sent back to Junlin. All of the nobles were in disbelief because they knew how weak their army was.

The richer they were, the weaker their Army would be.

Even so, they were still able to defeat the well-trained forces of the Vis Kingdom. This was too outrageous.

Soon after, more news of Bryne’s victory came back. It was the secret Order of Knights sent by Her Majesty the Queen who killed the general of the enemy with one blow.

Everyone was shocked and immediately felt even more reverence for the Queen.

And everyone referred to that terrifying Regiment of Knights as the demon Knights.

As for the noble who escaped, he was captured and directly ordered to be executed.

…

The aftermath of the war not only spread within the Empire but also quickly spread to the surrounding countries. The other countries also had an inexplicable fear of Bryne.

Everyone had also stopped their hostility toward Bryne.

Vis also pulled back his forces, but it was unknown whether he was trying to gather more information or preparing to send troops again.

…

Eli ignored the outside world.

In the laboratory.

Looking at the Four Knights who had returned, Eli tilted his head.

As expected, he seemed to have integrated too much of the bloodline into the knights this time. It was fine if they had long horns, but from their description, after five minutes of fighting, they had basically lost all consciousness and were fighting with their animal instincts.

They would instinctively kill the strongest Knights, which was why they targeted the general in the end.

If the general was a little weaker, they might not have noticed him.

“It’s just a small mistake. Actually, I should’ve noticed it earlier.” Eli reflected on it for a moment, and he had more in-depth thoughts about the bloodline integration experiment.

As expected, the results of such violent experiments in the war were indeed good. Therefore, when Eli heard that the war had stopped, he raised his eyebrows.

How could the war stop just like that?

Furthermore, Eli felt the need to take down the surrounding countries. After all, the mage ruins were in these countries, and it was too troublesome and too slow to send people to other countries. It would be better to turn all the places into his territory.

“Am I going to casually start a war?” Eli pursed his lips.

“Everything is for the truth!

“Plus, when everyone is united under one banner, there will be no more wars. I’m doing this for their own good. I’m really a kind person.”
