231 Summary

“Honorary Deputy tower master?”

After more than ten seconds, someone finally asked with a confused look.

The others also spoke up.

“Did I hear it wrong?”

“It’s fake, right?”

“How is this possible? This random person?”

Everyone’s eyes swept over the stranger, Eli, with confusion and shock in their eyes. They did not understand why the tower master would make such a decision.

Was this person even qualified? F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

An honorary Deputy tower master was not something an ordinary person could be.

It represented a member of the bloodline tower one rank lower than the tower master. However, the honorary title was only given to those who had made outstanding contributions to the bloodline tower.

Their status was even comparable to the tower master, and they had the right to make suggestions on the construction and development of the bloodline tower. They could also draw more resources from their forces every year, and they could even act as the tower master in the most critical moments.

But today, tower master Vivika suddenly brought someone in and told them that this person would be the future Deputy tower master. How could they not be confused?

“Milord, isn’t this a little inappropriate?” The others were also waiting for an explanation from Vivika. Although the authority of the bloodline tower’s master was extremely high, it was not without restrictions.

“What, do you have any objections? According to the rules, the tower master has the right to do so!” Vivika’s eyes were sharp, and her tone was tough. The aura belonging to the third circle instantly swept through the audience.

Gulu!

The throat of the person who asked the question moved slightly, and the atmosphere became tense all of a sudden.

The others didn’t dare to speak.

“Time really changes people!” Eli sat on the chair and watched this scene.

In fact, he didn’t expect Vivika to come here to talk about this. He had lived here silently for a year, so he naturally understood what this term meant. However, he didn’t expect that he would become an honorary Deputy tower master.

Fortunately, it was only an honorary title. He could get paid and not do anything, so it didn’t matter. He had quite a few titles on him.

The person behind the scenes of the Byrne Kingdom, the master of the White Tower, the boss of the irises, and the Deputy Master of the bloodline tower would not matter.

“of course, we won’t object, but you should at least introduce this man to everyone. Otherwise, it wouldn’t be appropriate.” An old warlock tried to smooth things over.

“Of course,” Vivika nodded. This was a Warlock during Natasha’s time, and she had taught him not to overdo it for a while.

Hearing Vivika’s compromise, the others all breathed a sigh of relief.

However, they were even more curious. They were very curious about the identity of this person.

Looking at everyone’s eyes, Vivika didn’t interrupt and said directly, “This is my teacher, Warlock Eli. He’s currently at the third circle, and we killed Kloss together!”

The simple introduction left everyone dumbfounded.

“Yes, yes. yes, he …”

Someone stammered. Anyone who had seen the video that day would know that the last blow was not from the person who had attacked but from another three-ringed Warlock. Did Vivika mean that the person in front of them was that person?

Hiss!

For a moment, everyone sucked in a breath of cold air. All their dissatisfaction instantly disappeared as they looked at Eli. How was this an outsider? This was the person who had saved bloodline tower!

Suddenly, everyone looked at him in a different light. He was a three-circle warlock, and once he joined, the bloodline tower’s strength would even surpass its past. This was a good thing!

“Does anyone still have any objections?”

Vivika asked again.

“No.”

“It’s our honor to have you join us, Sir!”

The group of people expressed their agreement one after another. Seeing this scene, Vivika also smiled.

The matter was settled.

..

Time passed quickly.

It had been three months since Eli became the honorary Deputy tower master.

In the past three months, with the help of his status as the Deputy tower master, Eli was able to read most of the information about the bloodline tower. He had also gained a lot, and some fresh resources from the bloodline tower had also benefited him greatly.

And after this matter was over, Eli could also settle down and focus on his own matters.

‘I have a lot of things on hand. I need to make a list.’ In the Tower, Eli was deep in thought.

He had more resources on hand, more knowledge, and more complicated problems. After so long, he had no choice but to face a question.

Was it really a good idea for him to want everything?

Even though his lifespan was unlimited, time was limited. He couldn’t do everything at once. There was only one of them.

Therefore, he needed to sort out what he needed at the moment and come up with a sequence.

The first was himself.

He currently in the third circle and had a mental power of 236 points. He was still far from breaking through, so he didn’t need to worry about it for a while.

The second was the spells.

[ solidified spells: first circle spirit shield, second circle eye of truth, third circle Butterfly Dream, second circle bloodline solidified spell, shadow control, third circle bloodline solidified spell, Shadow Dragon Breath ]

[ special spells: endless devouring seal (first and second seal), devouring sorcery system (currently being developed, few products), blood burning secret technique, Soul Blade (current 65 years of cultivation), curses, Fate Dice, Necromancer system. ]

[ normal mage spell: fireball (Level 1), big fireball (Level 2), wind blade (Level 1), thorn control (Level 1), water Dragon’s death (Level 3) ]

...

[ items: Shadow Dragon Sorcerer’s robe (2nd circle), Shadow Dragon Boots (2nd circle), Sorcerer’s staff (2nd circle), close to 500000 low-grade magic stones, water elemental fruit tree, one unknown tree, one secret realm, ether crystal (strengthened staff), other sorcerer tools, magic plants … ]

The things were very messy, and Eli also roughly looked at them.

That was about all of his current situations. He had omitted some of the useless ones.

It could be seen that he had a lot of material resources thanks to several organizations. However, he had just leveled up, and all his items were in the second circle. He would probably need to spend a lot of money to improve further. At this point, the potential of Shadow Dragon materials had been fully explored. He might not have enough for the future.

Of course, there were also more spells.

It could be seen that he still had a lot of means, but it was obvious that he needed to update them. For example, he didn’t have many 3rd-circle spells, so he needed to further consolidate them.

Currently, the devouring spell was only a simple application, but it was completely unsystematic. It lacked the foundation and development.

As for the endless engulfing seal, he had only reached the second level. It was basically useless once he reached the third circle. Eli didn’t have any good ideas either, but he was going to take a look at the chimeras and see if he could cultivate one.

As for necromancy, it was more up to fate. Eli had never treated it as an important part, but Eli could go deeper into it.

As for the Dice of Fate and curses, they were easy to use as they only needed to consume lifespan.

“It seems like I have a lot of work to do next!”

...

Eli fell into deep thought.

Whether it was the improvement of his techniques, the upgrade of mage weapons, or the deepening of his intrinsic knowledge, he needed to do all of them.

“Are we going to lay low again?”

Eli pursed his lips. Suddenly, another piece of news came.

After sensing it, Eli patted his head.”Oh, right, I almost missed it.”

Just a moment ago, all of the knowledge from the black Isotta had been sorted out and sent to the bloodline tower, including the mechanical knowledge that Eli had his eyes on.

“How long will that take to process?”

Eli fell into deep thought.

However, the situation had temporarily stabilized again. It seemed that everything was fine.

Was he going to enter the research stage again?

Other people’s transmigration was full of passion, and there were things happening every day. The enemy would come wave after wave, and there would be no rest for even a day. However, when it came to him, it was a break for decades or even hundreds of years after a battle.

Was this the power of an immortal?

It was really good!
