133 The Return

“We’re back. We’re splitting things in my house. You can come over and bring enough magic stones. The address is house 386.”

Looking at Gino’s letter, Eli was a little happy.

“It seems like they have finished exploring the ruins, but I wonder what they have found. I don’t know much about the spells that dark Magi are good at.” Eli thought with interest.

From the knowledge that he had obtained from Saleen and Nick, it should be mainly elemental sorcery, which was the inheritance of the light Magi from the Mage world. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

According to what he knew about this place, he should be in an area near the Clynes mountains. But in the past, this place was called the West Coast, where dark wizards gathered. That would explain the existence of the black mage ruins.

“He told me to bring more magic stones. Sounds like they’ve found a lot of things.”

Eli checked and found that he still had more than 300 magic stones. This was the profit from the sales share. It was still a large sum.

It could only be said that Eli had underestimated the demand for the silent crescent spring for a camp.

Bringing the magic stones with him, Eli set off.

Gino was in a relatively remote residential area, far from the camp. About twenty minutes later, Eli arrived at his destination.

Behind a big tree, Eli stopped.

After all, this was Gino’s territory, so it was better to be careful.

A shadow gradually appeared on the palm of Eli’s hand. In the shadow, a translucent eye gradually appeared and then fled into the distance. Its target was Gino’s courtyard.

The first circle spell-shadow eye.

It was a spell that used shadows as the main body and mental power as the dominant force. It could create eyes that were always hidden in the darkness, and pass on what the eyes saw to Eli.

It was also one of the uses of the shadow Dragon bloodline.

Very quickly, the shadow eye leaped along the shadows and arrived outside Gino’s house. It glanced at the tall wall, then shifted its gaze to another large tree not far away.

It looked down from above.

Everything in the house and courtyard came into Eli’s sight.

Gino stood in the middle, his face covered in scars. Not too far away stood two other injured apprentices. At the side of the courtyard, there were piles of items, which seemed to be their harvest.

“Where’s Victor?”

There was nothing wrong with the yard, but Eli didn’t see Victor.

Could something have happened?

Eli blinked, and then the shadow suddenly dispersed.

Since there were no ambushes or traps, he might as well go in. Besides, what could a newly-advanced first-circle Warlock do to him?

Walking up to Gino’s door, Eli knocked on it.

“The door isn’t locked!”

Eli pushed the door open and walked in.

“You guys are injured? What happened?” Eli asked in surprise when he saw this.

“You’re here, Herman!” Seeing Eli’s expression, Gino’s face immediately fell, and he revealed a sorrowful expression. “Victor is dead.”

Eli was stunned for a second. He was already surprised when he saw that Victor wasn’t around. It seemed that he was really gone.

“Then are the other three apprentices dead too?” Eli asked again.

“Yes, yes!” Gino nodded and said regretfully, “there were a lot of accidents in the ruins. You don’t know how dangerous it was. There was a powerful one-circle undead in the ruins. If it wasn’t for Victor luring him away, we wouldn’t even be able to get out. We never saw him again after that. It seems like he’s dead.”

“I see.” Eli shook his head. He wasn’t sad, but he felt a little regretful.

After experiencing everything with Bryne, life, and death no longer held much weight for Eli. Besides, he knew that there might be trouble in the ruins.

“I called you here today for two reasons. First, according to our previous contract, you have the priority to purchase the items from the dark Magi ruins. Second, Victor agreed to lure the evil spirit away for a fleshy flower.” Gino opened his mouth again, stepping aside to show what was behind him. “these are all the items. Let me sort them out.”

“There are a total of seven valuable items. Four of them were once wizard tools, one with One circle, and three with zero circle. The one-circle tool is a pendant that can release a mental attack, while the zero-circle tools are not worth mentioning because they will be sold.

“Then, we have another three items. One of them is ten grams of elemental crystal, which is also a wizard’s item, but it’s not very useful. One is a sophisticated observation instrument, and the last one is more than a hundred low-grade magic stones.”

Gino took out the pile of valuable items and displayed them one by one. He left the rest where they were, and there seemed to be books or something beneath them, but he didn’t seem to care.

To be honest, Eli was quite interested in them all. However, he was most interested in the first circle sorcery equipment, the elemental crystal, as well as books and instruments.

There was no need to talk about magic tools, they were definitely not bad, but elemental crystals were really good things. These things could greatly increase a Mage’s elemental essence conversion speed and were one of the things that the Magi needed, but the process of making them was very complicated.

There were also books. Although he didn’t know what they were, as long as they were Magi, he was interested. There were also instruments which might be helpful for his experiments.

“What do you want? Just tell me, but I’m planning to keep this first-circle magic tool. The rest are of no use to us, so I’m planning to sell them.” Gino asked.

Well, warlocks could use the mage tools too.

“I’ll take this crystal and the equipment. Oh, I’ve been studying magic potion knowledge for the past few days and have encountered a lot of difficulties. I’ll imprint a copy of those books as well. Maybe they can give me some inspiration,” said Eli after some thought.

Gino nodded when he heard that Eli only wanted some useless stuff.

“Yes, although we have no use for the elemental crystals, their value is not low. The market price is 10 magic stones per gram. There are also instruments. You may be able to use them, and the precision is quite good. 50 magic stones. Lastly, the books and other rubbish. You can copy them as you wish, as long as you don’t spread them.” Gino pondered for a moment and gave a price.

The corners of Eli’s mouth twitched at Gino’s words. He felt like beating someone up.

What rubbish? That was knowledge. If you were still a mage, you’d be lucky if you didn’t get beaten up for this blasphemy.

“Okay, a total of 150 magic crystals.” But Eli was fine. He was just a little upset.

“Well, that’s it then. You can take these.” Nick’s eyes lit up at the sight of the magic stone, and he put it away.

Eli took away the bottle that contained the elemental crystal and the medium-sized observation equipment. Then, he took out all the books and prepared to start the branding.

Meanwhile, Gino began to distribute the items to the two apprentices. Each of them took about 40 magic stones, but if Eli’s estimation was correct, the rest of the items were worth about 300 to 400 magic stones, especially the first circle magic tools.

Eli didn’t say anything. Capitalists existed everywhere.

As he flipped through the books and branded them, Eli quickly learned that these books were about necromancy.

That’s right. It was black magic that was mainly created from bones and spirits. It represented one of the famous wonders of the Sorcerer world, the undead calamity. It was a very special black magic system.

Eli was happy too. This was sorcery knowledge he had never come into contact with before.

In his heart, the value of this data had already surpassed everything here. Fortunately, the warlocks didn’t know the good stuff even when it slapped them in the face.

Very quickly, half an hour later, Eli was done.

After packing up all the items, he looked at Gino and asked, “I’ve already taken care of all my things.”

“Okay, then I won’t send you off,” Gino said generously.

“Oh, and where’s Victor’s flesh flower?” Eli didn’t forget that this was what he promised Victor.

“Flesh flower? I can give it to you tomorrow. It’s not convenient today.” Gino started to shirk.

“No. Let’s do it today. I have something to do tomorrow.” Eli refused.

In fact, the fleshy flower was not a simple thing. With some methods, it could allow human cells to grow new limbs. It was a very precious material.

Even if it was a zero-circle magic plant, it would easily cost 70 to 80 magic stones. He could not let Gino slip away.

“Alright, then.” Gino laughed awkwardly and returned to his room. He took out a small box. It wasn’t inconvenient at all.

When the box was opened, there was a blood-colored plant that looked like a Lingzhi. Its aura was not the zero circle plant that Eli had expected, but the first ring.

It was no wonder Gino was reluctant to part with it. Even a first-circle Warlock could use a first-circle flesh flower. This was enough to explain its value. It was worth at least 500 low-grade magic stones.

Eli was also stunned when he saw that it was the first circle. No wonder…

However, Eli didn’t have any thoughts about it. When he sold it, he would send the earnings to Victor’s grandson. Since he had agreed, he didn’t intend to go back on his word.

“Here you go,” Gino closed his eyes and hesitated.

Although Victor risked his life to get it, Gino still treated it as his own. It was a few hundred magic stones. He had just advanced and needed the money.

If only…

A few seconds later, Gino seemed to recall something and handed it over to Eli.

Eli took the box, packed her things, and prepared to leave. The other two apprentices also left. At the door, the three of them moved in different directions.

In the courtyard.

Gino looked at the back of the three of them, then locked onto Eli’s figure.

After hesitating for a moment, he secretly followed Eli.

He didn’t want to do this, but the fleshy flower was too valuable. He didn’t want to give up just like that. He had spent all his savings to level up, and he was in dire need of money.

“I’m already being very tactful. Can’t you be more astute?

“How dares an apprentice doesn’t respect a first circle Warlock like me? It’s only right to teach him a lesson. That’s right, that’s it.”

Gino’s will gradually become firm, and his eyes gradually become fierce.

Apprentices and warlocks were two different beasts.
