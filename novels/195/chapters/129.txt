130 Potion

Rooney walked out with a confused look.

He couldn’t imagine that it was actually Eli who had improved the potion. He was too powerful.

“Sigh, but that’s good. At least the Department can be saved.” Rooney shook his head, looking forward to what would happen next.

In the blink of an eye, a week had passed.

On this day.

The potion Department had requested for a new magic potion, silent moon spring, to be put up on the shelves without any warning. At first, everyone was very unwilling. After all, the sun Corolla potion had already occupied a large part of the market, which made it very difficult for them. However, they could not refuse the request of the Department, so they could only ask for a small number of potions.

Everyone thought that this was the potion department’s last struggle. After all, it was not an easy task to make a demon potion that surpassed the sun Corolla in a short time.

…

Sures pharmacy.

On this day, employee John was looking at the items in the store in boredom. He glanced at the bottle of silent crescent spring potion that hadn’t sold at all.

“The price is the same as the silent Crescent, but it’s still a little more expensive than the sun Corolla. It doesn’t even specify the effects.” John shook his head.

At this moment, a person walked in from outside the door.

“What do you want to buy, Lord Chuck?” John recognized the person. He was an old customer of his store, a member of the Foreign Affairs Department.

The Foreign Affairs Department was a Department of the camp, but it did not belong entirely to the camp. It would only issue some tasks, and then the warlocks would accept and complete the tasks and get paid. They were generally free warlocks.

“One sun Corolla potion,” Chuck said.

“Alright,” he said. John smiled and went to get it for Chuck but returned a few minutes later with an apologetic face. “my Lord, I’m sorry. They’re all sold out. You can go to the pharmacy selling the sun Corolla to buy them.”

“No more?” Chuck frowned.

“I’m really sorry. My Lord, you know how popular these potions have been recently. However, the magic potion Department has also recently released a new magic potion. The price is the same as before. Do you want to try it? ” John said apologetically.

“Forget it. I’ll go somewhere else.” Chuck shook his head and prepared to leave.

“Chuck, the mission suddenly changed. We have to rush over in half an hour. The captain has called for us to gather.” Suddenly, a woman ran in from outside and said to Chuck.

“What?” Chuck let out a cry of surprise and frowned. He turned to John and said, ” then give me a bottle of that new potion. Damn, can’t the camp give me an exact time for the mission? ”

“Yes, yes!” John immediately handed a bottle of silent crescent spring to Chuck.

John took it and put it away without even looking at it. Then, he ran out with the woman.

After leaving, John and the woman ran all the way and soon arrived at the camp gate.

There were already three to four acolytes waiting for them outside the campsite.

“Captain!” Chuck said as he walked to the leader.

“Chuck, Carly, the mission this time is a group of human-faced spiders appearing in the distant forest. We need to get rid of them and collect their poison glands.” The captain said directly.

“Let’s go now.”

Soon, the exclusive carriage of the camp was pulled over, and the group quickly got on.

On the way, everyone was silent.

Suddenly, the captain spoke to Chuck, who was not far away, “Have you prepared your potions?”

“Yes!” Chuck said casually.

Knowing that there was no hope of advancing, many apprentices would integrate a low-level bloodline at the apprentice stage. Chuck was the same. However, the bloodline he integrated with was that of the exploding lizard, which was considered strong among the zero-circle bloodlines. The only bad thing was that if the battle were too intense, he would fall into a state of excitement and madness, and he would need a sedative potion.

“That’s good!” The captain nodded when he heard the answer.

Soon, they arrived at their destination, a Grotto at the edge of a mountain range.

“Is it inside?” The captain asked.

“Yes.”

“Then let’s start.” The captain nodded, then took out a bottle of potion from his back with his right hand, gestured for them to move away, and then threw it into the cave with a bang.

Buzzzzzz!

Immediately, a foul smell spread out, and something seemed to be coming out of the cave.

The few people who had already hidden were looking at the cave and waiting.

Very quickly, the demonic beast that they were looking for was revealed.

A human-faced Spider at the limit of zero-circle.

Its huge body was more than a meter tall, but its legs were more than two meters long. Each of them was inserted into the ground and shone with a dark light like a long knife.

“Go!” The captain made a signal with his right hand, and everyone moved at the same time.

In an instant, a group of six people attacked at the same time.

One of them took out a Wizard tool, and a large number of vines instantly crawled out from under the spider’s body and wrapped around it. The other person also used a zero-circle spell, and the ground instantly caved in.

The human-faced Spider was also dumbfounded, but it instinctively tried to break free. Its sharp limbs cut off the vines and jumped to the side.

However, Chuck, who was lying in an ambush, threw a fireball at him.

Bang!

The explosion of flames caused the spider to let out a long hiss. At this time, the other three attacks had already arrived. A wind blade, an acid spray, and a sound wave attack.

Bang!

The spider was seriously injured.

“Everyone, keep up the good momentum and finish the battle in five minutes.” The captain looked at the injured human-faced Spider and said loudly.

The battle began.

The human-faced Spider was forced to retreat under the attacks of the six people and soon retreated to the bottom of the cliff.

Just when everyone thought that the battle would go smoothly, the spider suddenly let out a long hiss. From the distant forest, huge spiders appeared one after another. At the same time, there were two demonic spiders at the middle stage of the zero circle.

“Damn it, didn’t they say there was only one spider?” The captain gritted his teeth and immediately said to Chuck, “looks like it’s going to be a long battle. Take the potion.”

The battle was already very difficult. He could not let Chuck go out of control.

Chuck nodded and activated his bloodline power.

An explosive flame appeared in his hand. Chuck’s eyes were slightly red, but he remained calm.

“There seems to be something wrong with this potion!” Normally, he would feel a special desire to fight at this time, but at this time, it didn’t seem so obvious. Why was the effect of the potion better than the sun Corolla?

It was very strange.

However, now was not the time to think about this. He had to fight.

A large number of human-faced spiders had already rushed over, hissing. The injured human-faced Spider at the limit of the zero-circle did the same. It directly sprayed venom at them, and everyone dodged.

A single Spider was not scary, but a group of them would be troublesome.

Within the spider horde, everyone was fighting with all their might. Chuck was shooting out flames in all directions, burning the spiders to death one by one.

There were many spiders, and the battle continued until night.

“Damn it, Chuck!” During the battle, the captain suddenly thought of something and turned to look at Chuck. Normally, Chuck would be in a state of bloodlust at this time.

However, at this moment, Chuck still looked extremely calm.

The team leader was speechless.

The captain was surprised. What kind of medicine did Chuck take today? he had found a solution to his problem.

However, this wasn’t the time to think about this. He continued to fight.

Two hours later, the battle was over.

Looking at the corpses all over the ground, Chuck smiled. It was too dangerous today.

However, when he raised his head, he realized that his team members were all looking at him with blood all over their bodies.

Chuck blinked and asked, “What?”

“Your condition.” The captain spoke at this moment.

“My condition?” Chuck’s brows were tightly knitted, but they immediately relaxed, and his mouth was wide open.

“F * ck!”

“there’s something wrong with this medicine. There’s definitely something wrong.”

Chuck finally understood. It was ridiculous that he could remain calm in such a long battle. Even the sun Corolla could not do that.

“What’s the name of the potion you bought?” The captain asked.

Chuck did not know either, so he took out the potion bottle from before and showed it.

“Silent crescent spring, produced by the potions department.”

Looking at the words on the bottle, everyone fell silent.

“What’s the price?” The captain asked again. The effect was so good, so it should be very expensive.

“Just like the silent Crescent.”

Silence. Everyone was silent again.

“hurry up!” the captain suddenly said a few seconds later, ” we’ll return to the camp immediately after we collect the poison glands.”

“What about the rest?” One of the team members looked at the other corpses.

“Why would we want that? There’s a gold mine in front of us now. Let’s go back immediately and buy the silent crescent spring. The price of this potion will definitely increase.” The captain said excitedly.

Everyone finally understood.

Hence, after collecting the poison glands, they quickly returned to the camp.

…

The silent crescent spring potion exploded in popularity!

In just two days, everyone knew that the potion department had improved the magic potion, and the effect was very good.

Not only was its effect 1.4 times better than the previous one, but its duration was also three times longer. More importantly, the price was the same as the previous silent Crescent. It was simply a show of conscience.

As for the sun Corolla potion, although it was also good, it was still far inferior to it. Everyone was not stupid. Although it was slightly cheaper, the effect was too poor, and they became customers of the potions department again.

As for the sun Corolla potion, the sales volume suddenly dropped.

When he asked the people who had improved it, the potion department said that it was jointly improved by the potion department and that a man named Herman had played a role in it.

Herman had gained some fame from this, but his fame was greatly diminished by the operations of the potion department. The main claim to fame was taken over by the department head, Evena.

And when Eli found out about this, he also smiled.

Compared to the price paid, the benefits were still greater.

He was also a first-circle mage. Although he was currently hiding as an apprentice of the zero circle, there were not many people in the camp who could defeat him. This was why he dared to do it.

One-twentieth of the profits, and the right to look at the hidden formulas of the potion Department.

Eli felt that this was enough for him to digest for a long time. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

There were still many places worth digging in this camp.

“Take it slow. There’s no rush.”
