561 Invitation from the Imperial Dynasty

“What is it? The Megalodon Shark clan was completely wiped out?!”

In the deep sea, a cry of surprise came from a trench.

Suddenly, the waves sucked in, and a huge cuttlefish-like creature slowly swam out. He looked at a smaller cuttlefish not far away.

They were the Star Squid, a race that was adjacent to the Mermaid Race.

They knew about the Megalodon invasion this time, and even the Mermaid Race’s request for help had been sent to them. However, after considering the pros and cons, they still refused.

“Yes, ancestor. Moreover, the person who resolved the crisis this time around is a mermaid called Poseidon. It is said that he is the uncle of the current Mermaid Queen. His strength is above a thousand leaves!” the smaller Star Squid said.

Hiss!

The large squid sucked in a mouthful of seawater, and a whirlpool formed at the bottom of the sea.

“The Mermaid Clan actually has such combat strength. How is this possible? As expected of one of the Tyrants of the mage Era.” He muttered, his tone filled with regret.

There was no doubt that the Mermaid Race was about to rise again.

A marine creature above Thousand Leaves could change too much!

“Hey, take some gifts to congratulate the Mermaid Clan. Give them the northern sea area.” He said after a short chat.

“Yes.” The little squid nodded helplessly.

This time, they were wrong.

They were not the only ones. When the news of the Mermaid Tribe’s victory spread to the surrounding seas, the members of the Sea Tribes who had been asked for help at that time also regretted their actions. They all asked their clansmen to take the resources and run to the Mermaid Tribe to see if they could repair their relationship.

At the same time, the mermaid Poseidon’s fame gradually spread into the deep sea.

..

Deep in the sea.

On a huge underwater continent, there were huge pillars standing there. A huge open-air underwater hall stood there.

This was where the Imperial Dynasty of the Sea Race was located, the center of the Sea Race.

There were many members of the Sea Race wandering around the outer area. There were also members of the Sea Race inside. Most of them had strong auras. Suddenly, a sailfish-like member of the Sea Race quickly crossed the water and flew into the Imperial Court of the Sea Race.

He was very fast and arrived at the palace in the blink of an eye.

After passing through the stone pillars that looked like the residence of gods and devils, he arrived at the main hall.

Inside the main hall, a huge long table stood in the middle of the sea. At the end of the long table, a human sat at the end. But if you looked carefully, you would find that his hair was tentacles, and his body was covered with circles of black and purple patterns.

“Sir Clint.” The Sailfish didn’t dare to overstep their boundaries and bowed respectfully. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

The Seafolk in front of him was a member of the Eight Great Royal Families, Giant Octopus. He was an expert at the Ten Thousand Flower level and was also the person in charge of the Eight Great Royal Families’ rotation here during this period of time.

The Imperial Dynasty was formed by the Sea Race. It was just an alliance, and this place was the center of communication between the races. Every once in a while, one of the eight royal families would take turns to take charge.

During this period of time, the Giant Octopus Clan was in charge.

“What happened?” The arrival of the sailfish also attracted his attention. He raised his head and asked.

Gulp!

The sailfish’s throat moved slightly as it sent a shell over.

Clint took it and then probed inside with his consciousness.

“Mermaid tribe, a merman with a thousand leaves and above, Poseidon!”

Clint browsed through the information, and his eyes gradually widened.

After a full minute, he put it down.

Then, he took out a scroll from the side of the table and glanced at it. He threw it to the side. The content was about the request of the various races for the Mermaid Race to withdraw from the Imperial Dynasty.

“Although this matter was advocated by the Demon Whale Clan, this has nothing to do with me. However, the Mermaid Clan actually has such a strong expert and managed to survive until now.” Clint sighed.

Most of the current eight great imperial clans had once been beneath the mermaids.

On the other hand, the Giant Octopus and the Mermaid Clan were once the ” nobles ” of the deep sea. Therefore, seeing the Mermaid Clan rise again made him feel a little happy.

Of course, if it was just him, there might be other races who would be unhappy.

Peace wouldn’t last for long.

Of course, if they could survive, he didn’t mind resuming contact with the merfolks.

..

Bang!

After easily killing a hidden sea snake at the divine tree level, Eli put away its corpse.

Behind him, there were dozens of merfolk, all of whom were looking at him with respect, including Eval.

“Sir Poseidon, this is already the fifth Sea Clan creature with a fifth circle and above that you have killed in the past three months. It is also the first Divine Tree. In the future, I’m afraid that there will not be any Sea Clan creatures with the fifth circle that would dare to do whatever they want.” Eval walked out, his eyes full of excitement.

The past three months had been extremely turbulent.

Due to the sudden arrival of Sir Eli, the situation of the Mermaid Race changed. Not only did it stabilize their position in the Imperial Dynasty, but it also increased their reputation.

Many wandering creatures of the Sea Tribe and some powerful races appeared around the Mermaid Tribe from time to time. Fortunately, most of them were obedient, but there were also a few Sea Tribes that were not easy to deal with. The sea snake in front of them was one of them. This was already the fifth Sea Tribe creature that Eli had killed. It was likely that things would be much more peaceful in the future.

During this period of time, this clone of his had been staying here.

He had plundered many unique resources, as well as the corpses of the sea race. He had also asked the merfolk to help him search for some knowledge about the sixth circle Mages.

“Sir, it seems that the clues to the knowledge of the sixth circle Magus that you wanted have been collected. It is with Her Majesty.” At this moment, Eval suddenly said.

“Oh?”

Eli turned around, his eyes shining.

..

Soon, Eli returned to the Mermaid Palace.

“Brother Eli!” Laura hurriedly stood up to welcome him.

“It’s fine. Tell me, what’s the situation,” Eli waved at her to sit down, and then he sat down on the other side.

“Regarding the knowledge of the sixth circle, I asked around some of the Seafolk who was on our side. For your sake, most of the Seafolk generously gave us the information of the Mages.” Laura said emotionally.

If it weren’t for Brother Ely, these races wouldn’t have bothered with them.

It was during this period of time that she finally understood the importance of combat power, so she was even more grateful for Eli’s arrival, especially when she thought of the agreement between the two of them. She smiled.

Eli’s was confusing. Why was this child smiling?

“Eh!” Laura also realized this and quickly adjusted her tone, continuing the topic, “We received a lot of Mage Resources but none from the sixth-circle. However, some races in the Imperial Dynasty might have them!”

“Oh?” Eli’s eyes lit up.

As expected, the sea race had what he wanted.

However, how to obtain it seemed to be a problem.

“Oh, by the way, my lord, the Giant Octopus clan has extended an olive branch to us, hoping that we can join their camp. They were also a big family in the mage era, just like the merfolk.” Laura suddenly asked.

“Giant Octopus? Do they have clues about the sixth circle?” Eli asked.

“I’m not sure, but there’s a high chance that they do. Moreover, they probably won’t mind giving us such resources. After all, it’s not like they have any uses for them.” said Laura.

“Alright. Then agree to it.”

Eli nodded.

These days, he had also learned about the composition of the Imperial Dynasty. There were two main groups. One was the Deep Sea Demon Whale Clan, which was a violent faction that advocated the annexation of the world. There was also a moderate faction who opposed war! The Giant Octopus was from the latter.

If he wanted to join a branch, it would naturally be the latter.

“Laura understands.” Laura nodded and looked at Ely. “Oh, right, Clint of the Giant Octopus Clan wants to meet you, sir. I wonder what you think.”

“Refuse it.” Eli refused.

What a joke. It was better to let Laura handle this matter.

“Mm, that’s fine. Here is all the knowledge we’ve collected about Mages!” Laura passed a crystal ball over. This useful thing was also used by the Sea Tribe.

Eli took it and quickly browsed through it.

Most of them were knowledge that he had already understood, but there were also some that he did not understand. Although they could not directly increase his combat strength, they could increase his knowledge.

It could only be said that this trip to the Sea Tribe was not in vain.

As for the next step, it was natural to continuously raise the status of the Mermaid Race among the Sea Race. However, this had to be planned slowly. There was no hurry. Anyway, the Deep Sea was temporarily stable, so there was no need to worry too much.

Of course, he did not have the time to care about the Sea Tribe at this time. After half a year, the main body’s experiment on the Law of Light finally succeeded after many years.
