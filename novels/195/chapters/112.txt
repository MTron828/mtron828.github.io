113 The Ruins

His life force was indeed draining away quickly.

Eli closed his eyes to feel it and realized that his vitality drainage was at least 1.5 times faster than before.

“Something is indeed wrong.” Eli frowned.

It didn’t matter if his life force was consumed, it wasn’t a big deal. However, this phenomenon was indeed very strange.

!!

How could it be possible that the higher the level, the faster the life force would be consumed? This was simply outrageous. Not only did it not conform to Eli’s common sense, but it also did not conform to the common sense of this world.

This world was indeed abnormal.

“There might be some clues in ruins.” Eli shook his head and decided to put this matter aside and check the changes in his body.

His elemental essence conversion was at 15.6% and his mental force had reached 35.6.

The higher the degree of elemental essence conversion, the greater the amplification of spells. As for mental force, it directly affected the speed and power of a mage’s spells.

Eli felt that the power of his spells was probably five to six times stronger than before, and his physical fitness had also improved greatly. However, as for how much it had improved, it was still a problem.

It needed to be tested properly.

“Forget it. I’d better figure out my body first today.” Eli shook his head and walked outside.

Leighton Manor was very large. In addition to the area for planting magic herbs, there was also an area for breeding magic beasts. Behind the castle, there used to be a forest, but it had been flattened and turned into a training ground.

In the center of the training ground, there were a few stone pillars with a radius of three meters and a height of five meters. They were shining brightly under the sun. These were stone pillars, and they contained some minerals, which made them extremely hard.

In the past, the most he could do was leave a small hole in it.

But now …

Eli stood thirty meters away from the rock pillar and took a deep breath. Sparks instantly appeared and gathered in front of him. In an instant, a fireball the size of a carriage tire appeared.

As soon as the fireball appeared, the air around it began to burn, and its temperature was even more terrifying.

Although it was a zero-circle spell, it didn’t look like one at all.

The fireball flew out instantly and arrived in front of the rock pillar in the blink of an eye, colliding with it.

Bang!

First, it was a huge ball of fire that expanded, followed by a loud explosion. The rock pillar was instantly wrapped in flames, and at the same time, a large number of gravel shot in all directions like rain.

Dozens of seconds later, the fire mist dispersed.

The state of the pillar was displayed then.

First, there was a large hole at the point of direct contact between the rock pillar and the fireball, which was almost two to three meters deep. This made the entire rock pillar appear to be somewhat broken. What was even more outrageous was that there was still liquid from the melted ore dripping slowly from the rock pillar.

Terrifying!

Eli also drew in a cold breath.

He knew that the spell would be much stronger, but he didn’t expect it to be this much stronger.

Was this what a first-circle sorcerer was like?

It was on a completely different level from an apprentice, let alone a Knight.

After that, Eli began to experiment with other spells. By the time he was done, the rock pillars in the field had already shattered, falling to the ground and turning into broken stones.

“It’s really good.” Eli looked at the mess on the ground and smiled.

He had finally become a mage.

It had been 100 years since he came to this world. He had become a mage. He didn’t know if he should be happy or sad.

Normally, in a hundred years, the protagonist would become the most powerful person in the world, or at least a famous Big Shot. However, he had never seen any other mages except himself.

It was too strange.

“tsk, tsk, tsk. Forget it. Let’s continue to test my physical fitness.” Throwing away these boring thoughts, Eli called out to the servant in the distance, asking him to call a Grand Knight over.

Very quickly, a Grand Knight who was bound was sent over.

If Eli remembered correctly, this should be a prisoner from another country who had recently been sent to Eli for him to experiment with materials. He did not expect the servant to actually send him here.

However, it didn’t matter. He was a Grand Knight anyway, and he seemed to be one of the stronger Grand Knights.

The Grand Knight who was brought back lowered his head and did not say a word.

Five years ago, he had witnessed his country being destroyed by Bryne. Since then, he had been reduced to Bryne’s slave. At first, he wanted to escape, but after being caught a few times, this idea gradually disappeared.

He had lost his country, his faith, and everything. If it weren’t for the last bit of hope he had in life, he would have committed suicide.

“Raise your head,” Eli looked at the man in front of him, who had his head lowered. ‘Why was he so listless?’

The man did as he was told and saw Eli and the rock pillar ruins behind him.

He was stunned. What happened here? Even if it was a group of demonic elephants trampling, it couldn’t have turned into such a scene. What an exaggerated scene.

However, it only attracted him for a second before he lowered his head again.

“Uh, what did he experience?” Eli raised an eyebrow, but the experiment had to continue, so he needed to give the man some hope.

“Hey, I need you to fight me. If you can defeat me, I’ll set you free,” said Eli directly.

Freedom?

The man was taken aback when he heard that word. He looked up at Eli, and a light appeared in his eyes. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“You’re serious?”

“It’s true.” Eli nodded. He was just a Grand Knight, so it did not matter.

“Alright!” The man nodded, understanding that this was his chance.

He raised his head and moved a little. The shackles on his hands and feet made a clicking sound, and he got into a posture, ready to attack at any time.

“You’re going to fight like this?” Eli smiled and said to the guard beside him, ” Open his shackles.”

The guard was shocked. “my Lord, this Grand Knight is very strong. He even killed one of our Grand Knights when he was escaping. Wouldn’t it be too dangerous to let him go? ”

“Let him go,” Eli said without any nonsense.

Although the attendant was worried, he didn’t dare to say anything. He immediately ran over to open the man’s leg cuffs and handcuffs. The man was also very surprised. He didn’t expect the man in front of him to be so arrogant and dare to let him go.

“Since you’ve promised to let me go, I won’t kill you later,” The Grand Knight said seriously.

“Kill me?” Eli smiled and gestured for the Grand Knight to take action.

The Grand Knight did not waste any time. He rushed over like an arrow. He did not have any weapons, so he just used his fist. He threw a punch at Eli. He was even afraid that he would kill him, so he held back.

The next second.

Bang!

Flesh and blood collided, and the Grand Knight was dumbfounded when he saw that his fist had been blocked by Eli!

What the f * ck was this!

‘He blocked it just like that? Aren’t you an ordinary person?’

He thought that it was only Eli who wanted to play, but at this moment, he seemed to realize that if he didn’t take it seriously, he might really lose.

Immediately, he took a step back, took a deep breath, and pounced on Eli again.

The battle began.

Every Grand Knight had to go through countless trials and tribulations before they could become one. Naturally, they were not bad at close combat either. However, it would be too ridiculous if one thought that Eli was bad. For a full hundred years, even if Eli only trained occasionally, he was still not something that ordinary Knights could compare to.

The Grand Knight felt it too.

Be it speed, strength, or even reaction, Eli completely crushed him. Even the combat techniques that he was so proud of seemed to be seen through in a second, completely useless.

Half an hour later.

The Grand Knight lay on the ground, his eyes dull.

What did he experience?

To be completely demolished by a person without the slightest vitality force, he felt a little doubtful of life.

Wasn’t he a Grand Knight?

Aren’t Grand Knights the top of the Knights?

He must be dreaming.

He silently closed his eyes, and tears flowed down. This world was too cruel.

“Pull him down.” Looking at the man, Wli waved his hand. Then, he thought for a moment and said, “forget it, I’ll just bring him to the laboratory. The bloodline experiment just so happens to be lacking people.”

He waited until the man was pulled away.

On the other hand, Eli was relaxing his muscles and bones, and he had a deeper understanding of his own body. He could completely beat up a Grand Knight, and his strength and speed should be more than seven to eight times that of a Grand Knight.

This was probably the reason why Saleen metatrin looked down on Knights.

There was no road ahead, and even if he reached the end of the road, it would only be the beginning of a Mage. It was really boring. As for opening up a new path, it was too difficult.

Today’s test was almost over, and Eli was ready to return.

He had a lot of work to do next. He should start learning the 1st circle spell models and the advanced knowledge of the 1st circle.

…

Three years later.

Just as he finished learning a new spell, he received a message from Anna.

They had found the ruins.

Taken aback, Eli immediately went straight into the palace and found Anna in one of the rooms.

As Anna was helping Eli manage the country, Eli had given Anna a beauty potion a long time ago. As a result, she still looked like she was in her twenties, and she was still beautiful.

The only thing that had changed was her aura. As the ruler of a massive Empire, Anna also exuded a noble aura, much stronger than Queen Cynthia back then.

Even ordinary people would feel their hearts beating faster and their breathing becoming more rapid if they stood in front of her.

Of course, that was outside.

“Teacher, we’ve found the ruins,” In front of Eli, Queen Anna smiled as if she was really happy.

She would only remove her disguise in front of Eli.

“Where is it?” Eli asked after taking a deep breath.

He had to search for the ruins for decades, but he did not expect to find them in just twenty years. This was a pleasant surprise for him. After all, it was the remains of a Celestial.

“Teacher, do you still remember Duoling? ” Anna asked.

“Duo Ling?” Eli raised an eyebrow. “It couldn’t be in Duoling, right?”

“That’s right. The ruins aren’t in Duo Ling, but it’s in a Valley a dozen kilometers away from the city.” Anna took out the map and showed the location to Eli.

“It’s actually here?” Eli looked at the map and his eyes went blank.

He had passed by this place when he was patrolling Duoling, and it was only a few kilometers away.

What was this?
