261 Taking the Core

“F * ck! This Herman is too ridiculous!”

Rodin stood beside the silver Moon Lake with a shocked expression.

The heart of the darkness’s large-scale operation this time actually had two backup plans. The first was the combined bloodline spell of dozens of heart of the darkness warlocks, and the second was him.

On the surface, tatuck was the leader, but in fact, he was the one who sneaked in and took the elemental heart. After all, they were not fools. Their only purpose was to control the elemental giant.

!!

But who would have thought that a Warlock would come alone?

One man against an Army!

And he even f ** king won!

No matter if it was Tatuck or the warlocks’ combined skill, they were like sand castles in his hands. As soon as the waves came, they disappeared without a trace!

“But it’s good that it’s over!”

He took a deep breath and took out the element’s heart.

The elemental heart was dark gray like a stone, but it contained a complex structure. As long as it was thrown into the silver Moon Lake where the elements were exploding, an elemental giant would appear again.

This was the special thing about elemental Giants!

Looking at the frenzied water elemental and the fish in it, he took a deep breath and looked at Eli in the distance. Then, he threw the elemental heart into it.

At this distance, it was already too late for Eli to stop him!

The moment the element’s heart entered the lake, the surface began to transform bit by bit. The dark gray surface faded away, and it was like a colorful gem, emitting a dazzling light.

The elements of the silver Moon Lake also began to surge toward the elemental heart.

Streams of elemental power appeared and wrapped around the element’s heart. The element’s heart also flew into the sky and absorbed the surrounding elements. Endless elements poured into the element’s heart, and changes were produced.

Bang bang bang.

The element’s heart was like a heart, and it started beating.

“It’s done!”

On the ground, Rodin’s eyes lit up.

At this point, it was basically a success. This was also his hope of escaping this place.

However, the next second, he saw a figure appear beside the element’s heart.

“That is … Herman?”

Rodin blinked his eyes. It had come so quickly, but it was meaningless to come at this time. Once the process began, no one could stop it.

But the next second, he was stunned!

He saw that Eli had actually reached out and grabbed the elemental heart.

With a cracking sound, a shadow instantly enveloped the elemental heart. What shocked him was that the elements that the elemental heart had already absorbed were directly absorbed by Herman!

The throbbing breath of the elemental heart also stopped and turned back into a gray-black stone.

Then, he saw Eli holding the element’s heart and slowly walking toward him.

Eli looked at Rodin. He recognized this Warlock as the one who had escaped from the ruins.

“Uh, Your Excellency, it’s all a misunderstanding!”

Rodin trembled and silently raised his hand.

He couldn’t figure it out no matter how hard he tried. Wouldn’t it affect Herman’s body if so many different elements entered his body? They weren’t mages who could fuse multiple elements.

Warlocks could only fuse elements of the same attribute as their bloodline.

“Cool!”

Eli felt the influx of elements and felt a sense of comfort.

It had been a long time since he had felt this way.

The elements transformed by the element’s heart were very pure, and he absorbed them directly into his body. Although it could not improve his mental power, it had improved his physical fitness to a certain extent.

He was lucky this time. The elemental heart was only in the lake for a short time. He was about to stop it or else the silver Moon Lake would have been gone.

Therefore, he still felt a little angry at the person in front of him!

“You’re very brave!”

Eli gritted his teeth and looked at Rodin!

Rodin was trembling.

..

“Good. He stopped it!”

In the distance, Udo heaved a sigh of relief when he saw the elemental fluctuations disappear.

Fortunately, Herman’s reaction was fast enough. Otherwise, if the elemental giant appeared, it would be troublesome.

“But … Will Herman be defeated by the giant?”

A question suddenly flashed through his mind. He had already thought that Eli was a Warlock on the same level as Sergei.

“And …”

He turned his gaze to the battlefield. At this time, the shadow Pythons were still wreaking havoc. At this time, there were almost not many people left from heart of darkness. There were more than 1000 people when they came, but now, there were at most 100 people left.

Although they also suffered heavy losses, it was not worth mentioning compared to Heart of Darkness’s losses.

They had lost nearly fifty third circle warlocks.

...

This was a huge loss.

After this battle, Sergei probably couldn’t do anything to the Holy tower in a short time. This was a rare opportunity for the Holy tower, which could change many things.

This was all the result of Eli’s efforts.

Hiss!

Udo took a deep breath. He never thought that Eli would be so powerful. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

When he saw Eli flying over from afar, he immediately ran over.

“My benefactor!”

He flew over, and only then did he realize that there was a person behind her, hanging by a shadow!

“Long time no see, Udo!”

Eli nodded at him.

“thank you for your help, my Lord. I thank you on behalf of the Holy tower!” Udo clenched his fist, his face full of gratitude.

...

“A small matter!” Eli waved his hand.

“Sir, I have a question that I don’t quite understand. Why did you take action?” He couldn’t understand why Eli would help them/

“The silver Moon Lake is such a good fishing spot. It can not be destroyed.” Eli replied.

“Fishing spot?”

Udo blinked his eyes, his face filled with confusion.

It was to save the lake?!

Was this really the reason? This was too ridiculous!

However, looking at Eli’s serious expression, he had a faint feeling that it might be true.

“the bloodlines tower will occupy this area and make it their territory!” Eli said again.

“Of course!” Udo nodded.

The silver Moon Lake had always been an ordinary resource, and it had only become important during the silver Moon conference. Now that the West Coast treaty had expired, they could surrender the silver moon lake. The lake was precious but not that precious.

Besides, this was Eli’s request.

This Warlock was too powerful.

“Alright!” Eli nodded. He had achieved his goal this time.

This was just a notification, not a request.

Whether the Holy tower agreed or not, he wanted this area!

At this time, a whistling sound came from the distance.

Eli looked over and saw an airship flying in their direction. On it was the symbol of the bloodline tower, and beside the airship was a smaller golden airship with the symbol of the Golden cicada Chamber of Commerce engraved on it.

“Bloodline tower?”

Seeing the airship, Udo’s eyes turned. Could the bloodlines tower have predicted Eli’s victory?

But why would the Golden cicada Chamber of Commerce come?

What did they have to do with the bloodline family?

Udo was confused again.
