340 Farewell and Promise

“Radiant sun!”

Feeling the power in his body that was like a huge sun, even Eli felt that this was a little unreal.

Who would have thought that in just four hundred years, he would be able to cross three stages of the radiant moon and reach the final stage of the fourth circle Mage?

“It took at least half the time I expected. It has a lot to do with the power of faith.” Eli looked down. On his arm, only half of the diamond-shaped mark of faith was left.

This was the reason why Eli had improved so quickly over the years.

He chose to use the power of faith to increase his speed. Although it seemed like a waste, Eli still felt that he should get stronger first.

Although the power of faith was precious, there was always a way to accumulate it.

Of course, Eli couldn’t use it so freely now because as he advanced to the radiant sun, he realized that the bonus of faith was much weaker.

In short, the power of faith had reached its limit for him, or it could be said that the faith of the humans on the West Coast was only enough to support Eli’s breakthrough into the radiant sun.

If he still needed to continue, he needed more faith.

“It’s almost time to leave!” No. Eli shook his head.

At this point, it wasn’t that he was out of options but that the environment was slowly restricting Eli.

If he wanted to progress further, it seemed like he had to go to the central continent. At this point, he should start thinking about advancing to the fifth circle However, Eli still only had a rough idea and did not know anything in detail.

“of course, I still need a lot of preparation!” Eli shook his head. It was just a thought for now, and he would think about it later.

At this moment, a figure slowly walked over from a distance.

“Herman, I think we need to have a talk!” Viena said to Eli solemnly. Viena was the mermaid Queen’s real name.

“Alright,” Eli looked at the person in front of him and nodded.

He naturally understood what Viena was trying to say. Perhaps this fate should end.

“Call Luara along. I’ll be waiting for you at the wizard Tower.” Looking at the two of them, Eli turned around and returned to the Tower.

“Alright!” Viena bit her lip and nodded.

…

Very quickly, she found Laura.

“Mother, what happened?” Laura asked curiously.

“Laura, it’s time to part.” Viena sighed and said softly.

Laura’s body trembled.

She was no longer a child, so she naturally understood some things. That was, she was part of the mermaid royal family, and she had a mission on her shoulders.

Therefore, she didn’t say that she didn’t accept it. She just gritted her teeth and said, “What time?”

“I don’t know, but it won’t be long. Herman is asking us to talk to him!”

Viena did not say much and walked towards the Tower.

After pausing for a few seconds, Laura also quickly followed.

Soon, they arrived at the tower and saw eli again.

Viena was still fine when they met, but Luara’s tears could not help but flow down, and her eyes began to turn red.

“Why are you crying?” Smiling, Eli walked over and wiped away Laura’s tears.

However, the tears in Laara’s eyes still seemed to be overflowing.

Viena also felt sad when she saw this scene.

She also came to Laura’s side and hugged her gently.

This lasted for half an hour.

The discussion that followed was uneventful, and Viena decided to leave after three years.

….

Three years was fast but also slow.

It was so fast that it would pass in the blink of an eye but so slow that Laura would come to find Eli every day.

However, when it was time to part, everyone was still caught off guard.

A few kilometers away from Mercury Island.

A large team was gathering.

Eva, Viena, Laura, and a huge team of merfolk.

After 500 years of development, the remaining merfolk now had more than 3000 members. There was another celestial merfolk besides eval.

At the very front, a few of them were bidding their final farewells.

Eli was at the front.

“Thank you for your protection all these years, my Lord,” Eval said gratefully.

“Herman, you’re a good person.” Viena’s eyes were red as she hugged Eli.

After the hug, another one hugged him.

“Laura, don’t hug me so tightly!” Eli patted Laura’s back gently.

“No!” Laura rejected it, and Eli let her be.

After hugging him for more than ten minutes, Laura finally let go of him.

...

“I’ll miss you, Herman.” Laura bit her lips and said, her eyes red.

“I’ll miss you too. Besides, it’s not like we won’t have the chance to meet again in the future.” Eli replied.

“Then let’s make an appointment to meet again,” Laura revealed a smile.

“Alright!”

“Then we’ll have to set a time.” Laura actually began to ponder seriously.

Eli, “…”

Eli shook his head, then took out a piece of wood. The elements surged, and in the blink of an eye, the wood transformed into Eli. A small amount of faith was injected into it, and he handed it over to Lola.

“This is a statue of faith. We will meet when you become the Queen of the mermaids, ” Eli said.

“Alright!” Laura smiled and put away the statue.

“This is a deal!”

“Yes.”

...

“Hmm? Herman, why doesn’t this statue look like you?” Laura picked up the statue and asked.

“That is my original appearance,” Eli replied with a smile.

Herman’s age was almost at its limit, and it was time for him to return to his old self.

Upon hearing this, Laura and Viena were both shocked.

In the end, he had no choice but to show the two of them what he used to look like before she ended the conversation.

Very quickly, the team set off.

At the front of the group, Laura waved her hand and shouted, “Eli, remember our deal!”

“Yes, ” Eli replied with a smile.

It was a coincidental encounter, and now it was time to part.

It was time for this 500 years of fate to end.

As for the next time they would meet, who knew?

Perhaps it was just as he had said, it would be when Laura became the Queen of the mermaids.

….

On the other side.

The huge merfolk team moved forward quickly, getting further and further away from the West Coast.

In the middle of the merfolk’s group, a giant tortoise was carrying Laura and the others. This giant tortoise was attracted to Laura when she was born. It came back later and was now willing to accept Laura’s command. This was also Laura’s unique ability.

“Mother, where are we going next?” Laura asked.

“I don’t know, but we have to go to the deep sea mermaid tribe first. There are still many of our tribesmen left there.” Viena said thoughtfully.

“Alright, let’s go to the deep sea original mermaid tribe area.” Laura decided.

The others didn’t object. Although Laura wasn’t the strongest, she was destined to be the Queen of the mermaids.

Everyone set off towards the deep sea.

Soon, they reached the border of the deep sea.

But suddenly, everyone felt something. They looked forward and saw that the sea in front of them had fallen into darkness.

No, that wasn’t darkness. It was a huge body.

Along with the rolling sound of the waves and the terrifying roar, a huge creature slowly emerged from the water.

It was a huge octopus-like creature. The exposed part was already a hundred meters high, like a small mountain. The main body of the creature under the sea was even larger, and each of its dozens of tentacles was a few hundred meters long, and the thickness was like a giant tree that was a few hundred years old!

“You’re finally here. I’ve been waiting for you for a long time!”

The huge octopus’s eyes looked at Laura below, letting out a bloody sound.

He had been attracted there by Laura’s aura, but he had a faint feeling that there was danger on Mercury Island, so he had been waiting outside.

He didn’t expect that he would still get what he had been waiting for.

The merfolk’s expression changed when they saw the creature that was as big as a small mountain.

“Damn it! It’s a peak of fourth circle sea creature!” Eval was shocked.

“The peak of four rings!”

Laura and Viena’s expressions instantly changed.

They had just come out, was it going to end?

“Milord, you guys go first, I’ll hold him back!” At the crucial moment, eval stood up.

With a solemn expression, he rushed toward the octopus.

Bang! Bang!

The huge tentacle lashed out, and eval’s body was immediately sent flying with little resistance.

Upon seeing this scene, many merfolk felt their bodies turn cold, and even Laura was no exception.

However, just as everyone was in despair, a figure suddenly appeared in the sky.

“Eli!” Laura’s eyes lit up.

“Change direction, leave this to me!” said Eli as he looked at the huge sea creature before him and turned to Laura.

“But …” Laura hesitated.

It was true that they were delighted to see Eli, but the sea octopus before them was too strong.

At this moment, Viena walked over and pulled Laura. “Let’s go,” she said. “Don’t underestimate him. He is much stronger than you think, especially against the sea race!”

As someone who had been in close contact with him, she knew how powerful Eli was.

“Alright,” she said. Hearing her mother’s words, Laura gritted her teeth and said loudly, “Leave from the right.”

The group of merfolk left, leaving the giant octopus and Eli behind.

“Who are you?” The giant octopus asked. For some reason, it felt uneasy.

Eli didn’t answer and just looked at it.

After a thousand years of accumulation, its damage bonus on the sea tribe was now 150%. In addition to his own strength, he was not afraid of any sea tribe with a fourth circle.

“It just so happens that Hydra and Nikola should be advancing soon. You’re very suitable as a resource, and I also need a new robe.” Eli sized up the giant octopus.

Hearing these nonchalant words, the giant octopus was furious.

Dozens of tentacles attacked.

The battle started at once.

….. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

On the other side.

Laura and the others had only walked a few miles when they heard the sound of a battle.

The merfolk sped up, and when they were more than ten kilometers away, Laura looked at the area they had been in.

With a violent wail and a loud plea for mercy, the octopus’s huge body slowly disappeared from her sight after another attack.

Upon seeing this, Laura revealed a smile.

“Let’s continue!”

The huge merfolk team continued to set off.

They set off towards the deep sea.
