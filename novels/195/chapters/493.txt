494 Ten Million Corpses, Life Altar

Bloody!

The stench entered the nose of Eli’s main body, making him feel uncomfortable!

He raised his head and looked at the City of Dawn.

On the flat ground, the City of Dawn stood tall. However, the buildings of the city were dyed red, and a bloody mist rose into the sky.

What made Eli shudder was that he didn’t feel much of a living person’s aura.

This could only mean one thing. There were probably not many living people in the City of Dawn. However, the City of Dawn used to be a huge city that could accommodate tens of millions of people!

At the thought of this, Eli’s expression gradually turned cold.

“No, there seems to be some aura!” Eli’s silver eyes flashed as he looked into the depths of the city. On the blood-red ground, he could vaguely see an altar. At this moment, Nero was drawing something on the altar with a hurried expression. Beside him were 20 cold figures, each of them emitting a strong demonic aura.

He didn’t know if it was a coincidence or not, but the moment he saw it…

Nero also turned around and looked outside the city.

Then, he looked at the Warlocks around him and said in a firm and cold voice, “They’re here. I’ll stop Eli and buy me half an hour. After half an hour, I’ll be able to remove the seal!”

“Yes, sir!” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

The Warlocks raised their heads, their eyes red.

In the next second, they flew out of Dawm City at the same time.

Seeing this scene, Eli lowered his head silently.

..

At this moment, in the sky.

Eli’s clone stood outside the airship, followed by Vivika and Nikola.

“Sir, something seems to have happened in the City of Dawn.” Vivika looked at the city in the distance and frowned. The blood mist that was soaring into the sky made people feel uneasy.

“Indeed, I only saw the painful wails of countless souls.” Nikola also frowned.

Eli didn’t answer but said softly, “They are here!”

“Who?” The two of them asked curiously at the same time.

However, the next second, twenty blood-red lights appeared in their field of vision. They were flying from the City of Dawn. Each of them had an intimidating aura.

“Twenty half-step fifth circle warlocks? How is that possible?” Vivika’s eyes were filled with shock.

“Hiss!” Nikola was so shocked that he couldn’t speak.

This was 20 half-step fifth-circle warlocks.

How could the Heart of Abyss have so many half-step fifth-circle warlocks? This was illogical!

“They aren’t normal half-step fifth-circle warlocks. I’m afraid they only have a lifespan of less than a year and a month.”

At this moment, a voice sounded in their ears. Eli walked up to them.

“Brother Eli.” Vivika looked at Eli, a little worried.

It wasn’t that they were worried about Eli’s safety, but that the abnormal behavior of the Heart of the Abyss was really unsettling, especially since it was leaning against the abyss, which made people shudder.

“Don’t worry,”

Eli waved his hand.

In the next second, he flew out.

Blood-red blood essence and celestial Power erupted at the same time. A thousand-meter-long shadow dragon suddenly appeared in the sky and roared at the 20 figures.

Those figures only looked at each other and chose to transform into bloodlines at the same time!

In the blink of an eye, nearly 20 huge demon bodies stood outside the City of Dawn in the distance. They looked like giants guarding their palace. Their eyes were red, and they were as emotionless as zombies.

With the appearance of these large figures, the Warlocks of the army finally noticed these twenty people. They immediately slowed down, and their eyes turned from apprehensive to fearful.

“Twenty? Are you kidding me?”

How exaggerated was this?

The Warlocks opened their mouths wide, unable to conceal the shock in their eyes.

It was only now that they realized that they had thought too simply of conquering the Abyss. Was this the combat power of the number one faction in the Western Regions?

However, at the same time, there were also questions. Why didn’t they send these people out before?

Of course, this was no longer important. After a few seconds, the shadow dragon that Eli had transformed into flew toward the City of Dawn and collided with the demons.

Twenty vs one battle!

The shockwaves from the first collision caused the ground to tremble, and even their bodies trembled instinctively. Vivika immediately ordered the army to wait and not step into the Dawn Plains.

In the meantime, a figure silently left the army and headed toward the City of Dawn.

His speed was very fast. In the blink of an eye, he was less than ten kilometers away from the City. However, he stopped at this time and quietly hid himself.

Eli looked at the sky. His clone was fighting with nearly twenty ” temporary ” half-step fifth-circle warlocks. Both sides were coming and going, and neither could do anything to the other.

Even though Eli had a certain advantage, he could not quickly eliminate the enemy. After all, there were too many of them.

It seemed that he needed to use some tricks. At the very least, he had to stop Nero’s sacrifice. That should be a sacrifice that broke the seal. If he succeeded, it would be troublesome. Eli also understood that he could not stay behind this time, so he began to command his clone in the sky.

In the next second, the dragon in the sky let out an angry roar.

A shadow instantly condensed.

At the same time, an unknown amount of power of faith burned like a raging fire, and a faint golden flame attached itself to the shadow. A shadow that looked like a black sun appeared and then instantly erupted, surging toward the demons.

In the blink of an eye, the sky within tens of thousands of kilometers instantly turned dark. The demons could only hear the wails of the other demons. This lasted for a few minutes.

And when the shadow dissipated.

Everyone looked up into the sky, and their expressions changed drastically.

In the sky, there were only 15 demons left from the original 20, and the rest were covered in wounds. This should have been a good thing, but the aura of ” Eli ” was only half of what it was before.

Half!

At this time, the remaining demons began to work again. At this time, “Eli” could not resist at all. Under the attacks of the demons, he was injured left and right, as if he could be defeated at any time.

The sudden change stunned everyone, and their expressions changed.

In their opinion, once Eli failed, they would definitely die.

However, more people were puzzled. How did it become like this all of a sudden? Also, was Eli crazy just now? Why did he suddenly explode and cause the situation to become like this?

Was it over just like that?

..

“Is it over just like that?”

Nero had been anxiously preparing for the sacrifice, but when he saw this scene, he was stunned!

The failure of the Warlock Union did not bring him as much time as he thought, so he had no choice but to speed up the process. Unfortunately, he still had some unfinished business when he learned that the Bloodline Tower was coming.

Initially, he had wanted to rely on the 20 temporary half-step fifth circle warlocks to block Eli for a while, but who would have thought that in the current situation, Eli would be defeated?

Was it that magical?

Nero looked at the altar in a daze, and he suddenly wanted to stop.

“There’s no return now!”

At this moment, a voice sounded in his mind, and Nero finally calmed down.

Yes, he might have had a way out before, but he had killed tens of millions of people in the City of Dawn. He had no place in the human world.

“I can’t go back anymore.” Nero waved his hand and looked behind him.

Behind him were the streets of the City of Dawn, crisscrossing with one another. In between them were countless corpses. They were piled up like sandbags in every inch of the ground. Even the lowest pile of people was seven to eight meters tall. One could see human skeletons that had been crushed into minced meat.

Nearly ten million bones were buried here.

They had turned into a part of the altar that was nearly twenty meters tall under his feet, surrounded by millions of beautiful soul crystals that looked like jade.

The blood red and the white bones collided like a silent opera!

Nero was expressionless. In his opinion, these sacrifices were all worth it.

“Beautiful.”

He praised it and turned around.

“But I think it would be even more beautiful if I crushed your head!”

Suddenly, a cold voice entered his ears.

Nero was stunned and turned around.

On the street in the distance, amidst the mountains of corpses and the sea of blood, a person was staring at him. The killing intent and anger in his eyes were brewing like a storm, and he did not hide it at all.

“Eli?”

Nero shouted a name in shock.
