353 Dumb Dumb

The old man’s name was Bena.

The fourth circle Giant Thorny Warlock had advanced to the celestial realm three hundred years ago. He was a micro-star Warlock and the first Warlock to advance to the fourth ring in the Four Seasons Garden.

He had played a huge part in the Four Seasons Garden’s success.

Thus, when he saw so many Warlocks die, Bena exploded in anger. With so many Warlocks, it would take at least two to three generations to nurture them, but they were all killed by a single round of attacks from the airships. No matter what, Four Seasons Garden suffered a great loss.

However, he could also tell that these three airships were not ordinary. They could be considered top-notch mage tools below the fourth circle, and their value might not be lower than some fourth-circle items. If he could get them, he might be able to make up for some of his losses.

As he flew up, vines gradually appeared around his body. They were 100 meters long and kept rolling around him. Then, they formed a huge plant-like creature that was 100 meters tall.

At the same time, boundless dark green gas spread out from his surroundings.

A huge thorny monster appeared behind him. Bena stood on the branch of the thorny monster and looked down at the three airships.

“Land immediately and get out!”

His voice was not loud, but it resounded in everyone’s mind.

…..

At the airship’s spectator stand, Eli withdrew all the elemental cannons.

Speaking of which, this was usually installed on offensive aircraft. It was also the most basic weapon for large-scale mobile aircraft in dimensional wars. It was generally not used in the warlock world, and no one would install it on an airship.

Eli had long predicted that he would leave the west coast. In the next 500 years, he built these four airships, took three with him, and left one on the west coast.

Because he wanted to improve his alchemy skills, he used everything he could think of.

Otherwise, it would be impossible for an ordinary airship to reach such a level.

However, it was obvious that the airship couldn’t do anything to the celestial.

Eli shook his head and slowly flew out.

At this moment, all the Warlocks in the airship were leaning against the window, watching Eli.

The injured third-circle Warlocks from Four Seasons Garden looked at Eli from the sky, their eyes filled with hatred. The Warlocks on the ground who had not fallen to their deaths were also wailing as they looked at the sky as if they could already see the Warlocks from the bloodline tower surrendering.

In the stands, Alida was also staring at the sky, but she was filled with confidence.

….

“You must be the leader of the Bloodline Tower.” In the sky, Bena stood on the body of the Giant Thorn Demon, looking down at Ely and asking.

“Yes.” Eli looked at him calmly.

” You’re quite brave. Descend your airship immediately. Everyone, get down and grab all the captives,” Bena sneered and said to Ely, “As for you, I will make you wish you were dead to pay for our losses.”

Looking at this arrogant look, Eli almost laughed. Bena’s people were there to ambush them, but it sounded like Eli was the criminal.

“I think you guys are the ones who are robbing us, right?” Eli’s expression was strange.

As if his sore spot had been poked, Bernard’s face darkened. ” Kid, you’re very brave, but let me tell you, this world doesn’t work like this. Natural selection, the strong prey on the weak, do you understand?

“Because I’m stronger, so you have to listen to me.” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“That’s true.” Eli nodded seriously.

Bena sneered, but in the next second, Ely suddenly realized something and said, “Looks like the manticore clan is indeed stronger. Otherwise, you wouldn’t be a dog for them. ”

Bena seemed to have been bitten in pain. His face instantly turned black, and the anger in his heart burned like a flame.

“You, you, you.” He pointed at Eli angrily.

“Looks like I was right, manticore’s dog.” The smile on Eli’s face widened.

Bena’s face turned even darker.

At this moment, the Four Seasons Garden’s members were stunned by this scene.

No one had expected the situation to turn out like this with just a few words.

“I’m going to kill you!” Bena couldn’t hold it in anymore. The giant thorny demon beneath him moved. Dozens of 100-meter-long thorny vines lashed out at Eli. The air seemed to be torn apart, and afterimages appeared at its speed.

“It seems like we can’t win.” Eli laughed, extremely carefree.

At this moment, the vines of the Giant Thorn Demon were very close to him. In the next second, an invisible time domain was activated.

Countless light shards appeared in Bena’s dull eyes.

He saw that his vines seemed to have slowed down a lot, and the figure of Eli disappeared in the blink of an eye. The figure was actually rapidly approaching him. That speed was completely illogical.

“Stop!” Bernard felt that something was wrong.

More and more vines crashed towards Eli like a wave. They were densely packed, like a rolling snake cave. However, what he did not understand was that every time the vines got within a hundred meters of Eli, the speed of the vines would slow down at a visible speed, allowing Eli to easily dodge.

“No!”

Bena observed carefully and found that the vines around Eli were not the only thing moving. It was as if the air had slowed down a lot.

It was not that the vines were slow, but that time was slow.

” The power of time? How is this possible?! ” Bena couldn’t understand, but he realized that Eli might be a celestial!

“Celestial!” Bena was stunned.

Wasn’t it a sub-tower? The sub-tower still had a Celestial!

But at this moment, he knew that he absolutely could not let Eli get close. More vines instantly covered the sky.

However, Eli’s speed was completely illogical. By the time he could react, Eli had already arrived in front of him.

Their eyes met.

Countless scales appeared on Ely’s right arm as if it was filled with boundless blood. He swung it in a circle and swung it at Bena’s face.

Bena seemed to hear a dragon’s roar and see a shadow that covered the sky.

...

“He’s a celestial!” At this moment, Bena finally confirmed Eli’s strength.

The next moment, a slap landed on his face.

Bang!

Bena’s head instantly turned into minced meat, and the shadow directly pierced through him. A huge pillar of light that was 100 meters long streaked across the distance and half of the mountain peak not far from the off-road disappeared in an instant.

Bena died.

The dead body fell to the ground. The Giant Thorn Demon under his feet quickly turned black and turned into a rotten plant. Then, they fell to the ground together.

“You said that the strong prey on the weak.”

Eli looked at the fallen celestial without any mercy.

…..

“What is this? Master was slapped to death?”

“How is that possible? This is definitely a celestial.”

...

” You’re telling me this is a branch tower of the Bloodline Tower? ”

On the ground, the Warlocks of Four Seasons Garden was filled with fear, unable to accept this.

They couldn’t understand how a mission to intercept the bloodline branch could end up like this. Even their celestial had died.

Not far away, the third circle Warlocks felt their entire bodies turn cold. Even Bena had been killed. If Eli wanted to kill them, they would have no chance to resist at all.

Fortunately, Eli didn’t seem to have any intention of killing them. He had just returned to the airship.

As soon as Eli returned, Alida immediately came over. “Congratulations, sir.”

“Just a celestial!” Eli shook his head, but this old man really pissed him off.

“Sir, shall we continue our journey now?” Alida asked.

“Of course. Go inform all the warlocks, ” Eli looked at her. ” We’ll ask for compensation later. ”

“Ask for compensation?”

Alida was a little confused.
