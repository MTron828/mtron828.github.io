349 Liliana’s Invitation

“Bloodline tower?”

Liliana fell into deep thought.

A few seconds later, she raised her head and asked Eli, “My Lord, is it the force in the central region of the Western Region?”

“Yes, I belong to this force.” Eli nodded.

“Then, my Lord, I was too rude.” Liliana apologized, but her eyes were filled with confusion.

She really couldn’t associate terms like celestial and mechanical airships with this force.

This was a branch on the west coast and it had such strength?

Ridiculous!

However, she might still have a chance if he was from the bloodline tower.

Liliana looked pensive. The charm mansion was one of the most well-informed forces in the Western Region. Although the bloodline tower was a small force, it had been very ‘lively’ recently.

Perhaps she still had a chance to win him over.

Liliana smiled again. She was a professional in this field.

“It’s fine. Actually, I’ve just advanced too,” On the other side, Eli said humbly.

Liliana’s smile widened.

It turned out that this was a celestial who had advanced on the West Coast alone!

It was reasonable. After all, even if the West Coast was poor, there was still a chance for one or two geniuses to appear.

Perhaps the bloodline tower itself didn’t even know that there was a wandering celestial in its force.

“Then you’re really talented. I’ve been here for a long time, but I haven’t seen the celestial from the West Coast!” The nearby Amanta also praised.

“You’re too kind,” Eli shook his head.

“The fact that my lord was able to break through to the celestial realm shows that he is extremely talented.” Besides him, Ian also became more enthusiastic.

“The banquet has begun. Are you all interested in going and having some fun? ” Amanta suddenly said.

Not far away, as time passed, the banquet had already begun, and many people were already dancing on the dance floor.

“May I invite my Lord to a dance?” Liliana smiled at the invitation.

“Of course, you can.” Eli nodded.

It had been a long time since Eli had attended a banquet. He actually quite enjoyed being in such an environment occasionally.

The immortal also needed entertainment.

He reached out his hand, and Liliana placed her fair little hand on his, and the two of them walked toward the dance floor.

The music on the dance floor was melodious, and Eli began to dance with Liliana.

In the beginning, the two of them held each other’s hands. Suddenly, Liliana placed one of Eli’s hands on her waist and looked up at him.

“Sir, this is more suitable for this song.”

At this moment, Liliana was very close to him. Eli could clearly see her eyes. The purple color was full of charm, and her slender waist was very soft.

Even Eli had to admit that Liliana was one of the top three women he had ever seen.

Just like that, the two of them danced on the dance floor, and throughout the process, Eli could clearly feel the heat from her skin.

With a spin, Liliana returned to Eli’s arms, but this time she spoke, “My Lord, are you going to support the bloodline tower?”

“Oh? It seems like you know something.” As they hugged and danced, Eli looked at Liliana.

“My lord, you should be coming for the main tower, right? I heard that they are summoning warlocks from all over the world.” Liliana was still smiling.

“Yes,” Eli didn’t deny it.

“Then, I would like to invite you to join the charm mansion again.” She looked at Eli, her eyelashes trembling.

“Oh?” Eli looked at him. Wasn’t his meaning clear enough?

“It won’t be easy for my Lord to go and help them. The bloodline tower is in a bad situation. Their opponent is the Manticore family, whose power far exceeds the bloodline tower. Now, the bloodline tower only has one celestial. Even my Lord won’t be able to defeat them!” Liliana’s eyes were pitiful, as if she was being considerate of Eli.

“Oh, is that so? Then, that’s even more reason for me to go to help them,” Eli smiled.

“Then it seems that you are still very confident.”

Liliana smiled.

“But if you want to join us, you can contact me at any time. We welcome you.” Liliana let go of one hand, pulled out a purple crystal from her full chest, and handed it to Eli.

“Sir, this is the symbol of my residence. You can go to any residence and contact me through this.”

“Alright!” Eli didn’t refuse. He took the crystal. It was hot and fragrant.

The music was coming to an end, and Eli slowly let go of Liliana’s hand.

“My Lord, there is one more piece of free information that I will give to you.” Liliana walked out of the dance floor and suddenly turned around, her purple dress spinning.

“Oh?”

“The Manticore family seems to have some people here. They might have already heard of your arrival.”

Eli nodded, then watched as the person in charge of the charm mansion left.

Eli looked at the purple crystal in his hand and put it away silently.

There was a reason for her kindness!

Liliana seemed to be interested in him.

...

At this moment, Eli also slowly walked out of the dance floor, but he didn’t expect someone to come over suddenly.

“Hello, Lord Eli.” Ian was all smiles.

Looking at the person in charge of the Golden Cicada Chamber of Commerce who had suddenly appeared before him, Eli was baffled.

Why are you here?

“My Lord, you said you are from the bloodline tower of the West Coast. May I ask you about someone? Of course, there’s a reward.” Ian asked, looking at Eli.

“Go ahead.”

“My Lord, have you heard of Herman?” He asked.

“Herman?” Eli blinked as if he didn’t expect him to ask this. A second later, he asked in confusion, “How do you know about Herman? Herman was the anchor of our bloodline tower’s West Coast. However, he has been dead for a while.”

“This …” Ian blinked his eyes as if he didn’t expect such an answer.

However, he still nodded and thanked Eli. “If you need to replenish any resources, the Golden Cicada Chamber of Commerce will be responsible for it.”

Ian was stunned for a moment, but he wasn’t stunned. He was ecstatic.

...

He finally found information about Herman. As for Herman’s death, he didn’t care.

He only knew that once he passed this news to the higher-ups, he would at least be rewarded handsomely. They might even be able to transfer him to another prosperous area.

“Thank you, then.” It was as if Eli was not interested in his question, but his eyes lit up when he heard about the resources.

“Then I’ll take my leave, Sir.”

Ian couldn’t wait to leave.

Eli looked around as well and realized that Amanta and Liliana seemed to have left, so he turned to leave as well.

He had already gotten enough information from this banquet.

As long as the resources were replenished, he would rest and reorganize before leaving this place.

As for the charm mansion and the Golden cicada Chamber of Commerce, he would deal with them later.

He also knew that there would be trouble on the way. The Manticore had a base here.

However, when Eli thought about the Manticore’s forces Alida had told him about before he came, it seemed like the strongest were two radiant moon warlocks.

It would be troublesome, but not that troublesome.

Eli left the place silently, preparing to stroll around the place.

Just as he walked out of the building.

On the third floor.

The two of them stood there and watched as Eli left.

“Amanta, should we make a move?” The voice came from a man with a long face and dark eyes. Beside him was Amanta.

Half of Amanta’s body was hidden in the darkness, and he revealed a smile.

Very few people knew that there were actually two true celestials in Holmes city. One was him, and the other was the man beside him, one in the light and one in the dark.

“Clint, I’ve checked. His aura is indeed that of a celestial that has just broken through. I reckon that there are still a lot of valuable resources on the three airships, including many warlocks. We can sell them when the time comes.” Amanta sneered, the scar on his face looking somewhat sinister.

Holmes was far away from other powers, and in the chaotic lands, he needed a lot of resources to build it to its current state.

He had invited Eli to the banquet to probe the situation.

It had been a long time since they had encountered such a big fish.

“Clint, it should be your turn to make a move this time. With your Nebula-level strength, it should be easy.” Amanta said to him.

“Sure.” Clint nodded.

Holmes looked normal on the surface, but it was a place where many wanted criminals lived. It was dark inside.

And he, Clint, was the darkest of them all, at least blacker than Amanta.

“But it seems like the people from the charm mansion and the Golden cicada Chamber of Commerce are very interested in that man!” Clint suddenly said. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“He’s a celestial, after all. These two forces have great influence, but they don’t have that much actual power!” Amanta shook his head. At that moment, Eli had already disappeared from his sight.

“That’s true.” Clint smiled.

“And I saw the Manticore’s men observing from the outside. It seems like they are going to destroy this reinforcement team first. If we don’t do anything, he won’t live to see that.”

“Indeed,” Amanta smiled and looked at Clint. “I’ll leave the rest to you. I don’t care anymore.”

“Of course, my Lord.” Clint bowed and left.

Amanta looked out the window, his gaze distant.

…

On the other side, Clint swayed his body as he walked towards the back door. He was in a good mood too.

After this, they could rest for a long time.

He went to the back door, opened it, and walked out. The next second, he felt a roar in his head as if he had encountered something, and then the whole world fell into darkness.

The silver Eye slowly retracted. After confirming that he was dead, Eli put him away in a sack and kept him in the secret realm.

“Let’s solve a problem first.”

Eli left the alley with a relaxed expression, humming a little tune.

He had long felt that Amanta was not a good person, so he took a closer look and found the problem.

This time, he discovered their terrifying plot and resolved a great crisis.

It was really terrifying!

As for Clint, he was supposed to be the executor!

As expected, his decision to become stronger before coming here was the right decision. Otherwise, he would be in danger. Moreover, the silver Eye at the limit of the fourth circle was really terrifying. Even a Nebula-level Warlock could not detect it.

This evil ability, under the nourishment of Eli’s life, had already become his killing weapon.

As for Amanta, he couldn’t be bothered with him. It didn’t seem like he would bother him for now, so Eli left him be.
