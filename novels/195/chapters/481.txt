482 Manifestation of Divinity

On the battlefield.

Silence mixed with the noise!

Countless people looked up at the sky and stared at the blood-red figure.

“How weak!”

Soran looked disdainfully at the seriously injured Hydra in the distance, revealing his white teeth.

His voice entered the ears of the celestial and the Third circle warlocks, but no one dared to say a word or react.

“Soran.”

Not far away, Luo Ye’s eyes seemed to be burning with flames as he stared at Soran.

Although he wasn’t the one who killed Holy Sword during the battle, according to intelligence, he was one of the most important members and the commander of that battle!

As if sensing his gaze, Soran suddenly turned his head and looked at him coldly. He pursed his lips and said, “I see hatred and killing intent in your eyes. It seems that I have some dispute with you!”

His cold expression was filled with indifference, but it was also filled with ridicule!

It was as if he had seen something fun.

In the next second.

The cold killing intent came crashing down on Luo Ye!

Ahhhh!

Luo Ye spat out a mouthful of blood. All the blood vessels on his body burst open, and blood instantly dyed his entire body red. He could not help but let out a painful wail.

“I’m going to kill you!” Luo Ye roared as blood light filled the air!

Seeing Luo Ye like this, Soran seemed to be even more excited.

“Hahahahaha, this is so fun. This feeling of helplessness must be very painful, but do you still want to tell me what I did? Did I abuse your wife, torture your friends, or kill your family?

“It’s a pity that I don’t have time today. Otherwise, I would have played with you!”

Soran smiled arrogantly and raised his right hand. The power of his bloodline surged, and an even greater pressure was exerted on Luo Ye as if he wanted to crush him to death! 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Was someone there?

Soran narrowed his eyes and slowly turned around.

At some point, a figure appeared behind him.

He was wearing a black sorcerer’s robe, and countless shadows and lights circled behind him like a galaxy. There was also a halo of faith behind him, like a high and mighty god.

In comparison, the black-haired man’s face was somewhat normal, but his eyes were extremely bright, as bright as the stars, filled with wisdom!

When did he appear?

Soran was surprised to find that this person was not in his perception just now.

“Who are you?”

His brows gradually furrowed, and his eyes were filled with displeasure.

Eli ignored him. Just by looking at Soran, as well as his appearance and aura, he knew that this was another Warlock that Nero had transformed.

“Damn it!”

Seeing that he was completely ignored, Soran’s mouth twitched.

His blood and aura surged as he prepared to attack. However, before he could do so, he heard a voice coming from the battlefield.

Looking down, many Warlocks of the Bloodline Tower looked up at him with admiration and cheered, “It’s Sir Eli.”

“Hahahaha, I knew that Milord wouldn’t give up on us. So Milord is here!”

Listening to the sound coming from the ground, Soran looked up at the Warlock again, and his eyes gradually became cautious. He asked, “Are you Eli?”

“It’s me!”

Eli nodded his head without care. He looked at the situation on the ground and nodded his head in satisfaction. The addition of the war mage tool completely changed the situation of the war!

“Damn it, you’re too much!”

Seeing that he was ignored again, Soran could not help it anymore.

A boundless blood aura surged out of his body, instantly dyeing the sky blood-red. His figure also rapidly expanded, turning into a black-purple Shadow Demon that was nearly 500 meters tall in the blink of an eye!

Its scarlet eyes shone with light. It had dark purple skin and fangs that were dozens of meters long. Its body was humanoid, and behind it was a pair of huge dark purple wings. There were even protruding bones at the top of the wings.

With its back against the Abyss, the Warlocks of the Heart of the Abyss mostly had the bloodline of demons, and the Shadow Demon was also one of the high-level bloodlines. Its characteristics were darkness, abyss, and death!

“Eli, look over here!”

His sharp claws pierced into the space. Soran looked at Eli with anger in his eyes. His killing intent was as sharp as the cold wind in winter.

“Why are you angry like that?”

Eli turned his head and looked at Soran.

This group of Warlocks who had been modified seemed to have some mental problems.

“Go to hell.”

The breath of death pervaded Soran’s body, and the wisps gathered in front of him and then turned into a huge gray sickle, and the surface emitted an aura that made people instinctively uncomfortable.

Death Scythe!

Soran, who had mastered the law of death, decisively used his most powerful ability.

Even though he didn’t know much about Eli, he still respected Eli and used his ultimate skill right away.

Looking at the Death Scythe in front of him, the light of faith behind Eli instantly bloomed. The light shone for thousands of miles, and a thousand-meter-long sword slowly formed in front of him, slowly pointing at Soran!

Death Scythe and Holy Radiance!

At this moment, everyone on the ground stared at this scene with wide eyes.

It was magnified at the beginning!

Was he that ruthless?

“Milord, you must defeat him!” In the distance, Vivika was praying!

“Soran!”

Luo Ye, who was covered in blood, stared at the figure, his body trembling.

“Deciding in one strike?”

“Sir Eli will definitely win. Sir will not lose!”

“Lord Soran, you can do it!”

Under the expectant gazes of countless people, the Scythe of Death and the Holy Sword of Light collided. Immediately, the light of death and the glorious power of faith scattered in all directions like a storm. It was like doomsday.

Under immense pressure, everyone had no choice but to avoid the edge.

However, what everyone did not expect was that in less than a second, the light suddenly dissipated.

“It’s over?”

“So fast? Less than five seconds.”

The Warlocks shook their heads and looked up at the sky.

In the next moment, everyone’s jaws dropped.

In the sky, the dazzling Holy Sword pierced straight into the demon’s head. Large pieces of flesh fell from his body, and countless blood flowed out like a waterfall.

In the holy sword of light, the light in the demon’s eyes slowly dissipated.

His consciousness was disappearing bit by bit!

“Eli, you hid your power so well!” Soran let out a mournful wail with his last voice. He looked at Eli from the corner of his eyes, and for the first time, fear of death flashed in his dark eyes.

At the same time, he was very sure that this was the closest he had gotten to Death!

A few seconds later, with the realization of death, Soran let out a wail and closed his eyes unwillingly, ending his life of killing countless people and sinning.

After confirming that he was dead, Eli put away his corpse and turned to look at the other celestials of the Heart of the Abyss. He raised his hand, and a dot of light condensed.

In the next second, light exploded, and dozens of light spots flew toward the celestials.

As the blood-red flower bloomed, dozens of high-grade Warlocks were easily dealt with by Eli.

Then, Eli turned to look at the stunned Warlocks on the ground and said calmly, “Continue attacking!”
