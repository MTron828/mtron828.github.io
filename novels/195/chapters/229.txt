230 Honorary Title

Aisha lowered her head to hide her displeasure when she heard Eli calling teacher Vivika by her full name.

What an unreasonable Warlock.

As Vivika’s student, she had never called her teacher by his name. If it weren’t for her teacher’s request to be respectful, she would have really wanted to argue with the man in front of her.

Her teacher had just saved the bloodline tower!

“Teacher is already waiting in the bloodline tower. Is there anything else you need to prepare, my Lord?” Although she was unhappy, she would not slack off on the task given by teacher Vivika.

“There’s no need to prepare anything. Let’s just go there,” Eli replied, but he looked at Aisha with interest.

This was a strange feeling. The little girl who had followed him back then actually had her own student. Time was really wonderful!

Feeling Eli’s sweeping gaze, Aisha gritted her teeth, but she still smiled. “Then please follow me, my Lord. It’s in the central tower.”

“Alright!”

Just like that, Eli walked out of the Tower, and Aisha led the way.

“Oh, right. What’s the Supreme Council?” Eli suddenly remembered that Aisha seemed to have mentioned some meeting.

“It’s a meeting that all the higher-ups of the house of bloodlines have to attend. It’s usually only held when something big happens. This time, it should be about the end of black Isotta. Sometimes, there will be people watching.”

Aisha turned her head and replied. In her heart, she had already classified Eli as a guest. After all, if he was a member of the family of bloodlines, it was impossible for him not to know about the Supreme Council.

“Alright!” Eli nodded. It was about time.

Looking at how Aisha didn’t seem to want to talk to him, Eli didn’t say anything after that.

A few minutes later, the two of them arrived in front of a mage Tower with two guards standing on both sides.

“Lady Aisha.” The guard clearly recognized Aisha and immediately said respectfully.

“This is teacher Vivika’s guest. I’m taking him to see the teacher!” Aisha explained, then turned to look at Eli, her tone slightly arrogant. “My Lord, please follow me!”

As a matter of fact, as Vivika’s student, she had a very high status in the bloodline tower, especially after Vivika’s defeat of the black Isotta.

Eli nodded and smiled.

Of course, he understood Aisha’s meaning, but he wasn’t angry. Instead, he found it interesting. It felt like an adult watching a child throw a tantrum.

Looking at the lack of reaction from Eli, Aisha was a little disappointed and led him forward.

Soon, she brought Eli to the third floor of the tower.

Bang bang bang!

Aisha walked up and knocked on the door gently, then retreated to Eli’s side.

The door opened slowly, and a figure came out and hugged Eli.

“Teacher, it’s been more than a year since we last met!” Vivika hugged Eli like a little girl who had been away from home for a long time.

“Hahaha, it’s not like the teacher isn’t around all this time!” Eli patted Vivika’s head. Vivika had basically been out since their last meeting, and the two of them had not seen each other for a long time.

However, this child was still lacking in love! Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

At this moment, Aisha was dumbfounded.

She looked at this scene with a dazed expression. What did she just see? Her teacher hugged the man in front of her and even called him teacher.

Actually, this person was her teacher’s teacher. Didn’t that mean that he was her grandteacher? This was too infuriating. Did her teacher actually have a teacher? Why didn’t she hear about it?

However, after the shock, she recalled what had happened just now and felt a little embarrassed. Her face turned red. What the hell was going on?

After hugging for a few seconds, Vivika also let go of Eli.

When she saw that Aisha was also there, her pupils dilated, and she closed her eyes.

Damn it. She didn’t notice her student was there.

Vivika recovered after a dozen seconds. She pulled Elsa over awkwardly and said, “Teacher, this is my student, Aisha. She’s quite talented. She’s currently a first-circle Warlock and also has a third-circle bloodline, the siren bloodline.”

“Yes, it’s good.” Eli smiled.

“Grandmaster!” The nearby Aisha lowered her head and said in a low voice.

“Since you’re Vivika’s student, I have to give you a gift. Since you have the water element bloodline, I’ll give you this water element crystal.”

Eli took out an egg-sized sky-blue crystal from the secret realm and handed it to Aisha.

A collection of hundreds of years was not a joke. He had a lot of things in various aspects. A water element crystal was a highly condensed water element. It could improve the elemental essence conversion of a first-circle warlock and also improve the level of their bloodline. It was much more precious than the elemental crystal he had used before.

“Ah, Grandmaster, this is too valuable. I can’t take it.” Aisha’s eyes widened. Such a large water elemental crystal would cost at least a thousand magic stones. She quickly refused.

“It’s fine. Just take it as a greeting gift!” Eli smiled and handed it to Aisha.

“Keep it. Your Grandmaster is in a good mood today!” Vivika said to Aisha.

“Thank you, Grandmaster!”

“Alright, then you can leave first. I have something to discuss with your Grandmaster.” After getting to know each other, Vivika told Aisha to go and then led Eli into the room.

The door closed.

“What’s wrong? Did you finish collecting all the machinery knowledge? ” Eli asked Vivika.

“Teacher, currently the black Isotta is completely destroyed. We have also received their books and knowledge bank, but it may take a few days to sort it out, so today’s meeting is not about that matter!” Vivika replied.

“Then what is today’s meeting about?” Eli asked curiously.

“teacher, you saved the bloodline tower. I don’t think that’s enough, so I prepared a surprise for you! ”

“A surprise?”

“Right!” Vivika nodded and said, ” but it’s a secret for now. I’ll hold a meeting and announce this!”

...

“Alright,” he said. Eli did not know whether to laugh or cry. He wanted to see what kind of surprise there was.

Soon, Eli got the answer.

..

A few hours later, Eli was taken away by Vivika to the second floor of the Tower. They paused outside a conference room.

Standing outside the door, Eli could sense that there were about a dozen people sitting inside. Every one of them had the aura of a peak two-circle warlock, and they should be the higher-ups of the bloodline tower.

Vivika turned to smile at Eli, then said, “Teacher, just follow me.”

“Yes!” Eli nodded.

Vivika nodded and turned back. Her body slowly straightened, and her eyes gradually became sharp. She controlled her facial expression, and then the door in front of her slowly opened under the effect of the elements.

Buzzzzzz!

The door creaked open, revealing the inside.

At the end of the red carpet was a painted red table with black velvet high-back chairs on both sides. More than a dozen second-circle warlocks were sitting on them.

...

At the very front, there was two tall back chairs side by side, but no one was sitting on them at the moment.

Upon hearing that someone had arrived, the dozen or so people in the hall instantly looked over with curious expressions.

Vivika simply walked forward and walked straight into it, with Eli following behind.

Vivika was wearing a sky-blue Warlock robe, while Eli was wearing a black and gold Warlock robe today. They didn’t look like teacher and student, but more like a couple.

Following Vivika, Eli looked at the two seats at the end and seemed to have a vague guess.

“Who is this?”

“Is there something important today?”

“You’re so good at setting up two chairs!”

At this moment, the warlocks in the hall looked at the two of them, or more accurately, Eli, who was behind Vivika and was a little confused.

They didn’t know who he was. However, the sudden meeting and the extra chair meant that today was unusual. There was a high probability that it had something to do with the man in front of them.

Vivika walked in front while Eli followed behind. Under the gaze of the others, Vivika and Eli slowly walked to the end of the table, where the main seat was.

Vivika directly sat down on one of the chairs, then waved her hand and pointed to the other chair. “Teacher, please sit here.”

“Alright!”

Eli didn’t refuse and sat down.

At this moment, everyone was already in shock. They looked at Eli, who was sitting side by side with Vivika. However, no one spoke up, and they were only waiting for Vivika to give an explanation.

Seeing that Eli had sat down, Vivika looked around at everyone and confirmed that they had all arrived.

The entire meeting room was silent.

“Ahem!” Vivika said, and everyone’s eyes focused on her.

“Let me make an introduction.” Vivika looked at Eli, who was standing beside her and said, “This is Warlock Eli. He will be bloodline tower’s honorary vice tower master from now on!”

The entire meeting room became even quieter after the introduction.

There was complete silence.
