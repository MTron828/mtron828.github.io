504 50 Years in the Secret Realm, 1,000 Years in the Outside World, Breaking Through to the Fifth Circle

“Even dogs don’t go. I’m not a dog, so it’s very reasonable for me to go!”

In the starry sky, Eli looked at the world fragment in front of him and pursed his lips.

After a day, he returned.

Naturally, he would not miss such a good place. After all, this was the best hope he could see for rapid improvement. Of course, his clone could not enter either. After all, his faith clone did not have eternal life. If it was struck a few times, it might directly collapse. His main body would have to come.

Needless to say, he was determined to break through the fifth circle this time.

He had even brought along the laws of shadow, as well as decades of resources, leaving only a clone in the Grassi Land.

“In that case, let’s go in.” Eli took a deep breath and flew towards the entrance.

There was no need to wait for the timeline to dissipate. He just rushed in.

Pa, pa, pa!

Many time lines flashed on Eli’s body. The loss of tens or hundreds of years of lifespan was too common for Eli. He didn’t even need to get used to it.

Entering the time fragment again, Eli’s emotions were complicated. However, he felt the depletion of time around him, which made him happy. He saw hope for a breakthrough.

“But this place isn’t enough!” Eli pursed his lips and strode into the starry sky.

To him, twice the amount was meaningless. It would only be interesting if it were at least dozens of times.

Eli’s pace was neither fast nor slow, and the surrounding timeline bloomed.

Ordinary Warlocks would not be able to avoid the timeline lightning, but to him, it was ordinary. It even made him feel like he was going home. Who would dare to come in if he hid in this place?

As he went deeper, the surrounding time flow became faster and faster.

Twice!

Three times!

..

Ten times!

Twenty times!

When the time flow reached twenty times, Eli felt his limit.

It took time for his vitality to recover. Although the speed was ridiculously fast, the continuous consumption here made him feel a little uncomfortable.

What he needed was to cultivate, but if he went any further, he might not be able to ignore the thunderstorm and cultivate in peace. Twenty times there was a relatively comfortable distance for him.

Ordinary!

Eli sat down cross-legged and began to meditate.

His spirit gradually sank into it.

His goal this time was very simple.

Breakthrough! Breakthrough!

..

New Calendar Year 4795.

In the same year that Eli entered the Time Fragment, four-fifths of the Green Field had already become Eli’s subordinates. Only the dwarves refused to join. Eli thought about it and allowed it to develop. The dragons still did not know that Roland and Eli were one, and they were trembling all day long.

Due to the information on the ruins, the Hamis family discovered that Flores, one of the six families, had planted a large number of spies in the family with ill intentions!

Thus, by a freak combination of factors, a war broke out!

The war between the two families ignited the world, and the world’s attention was focused on the Central Region. At this time, the news of the Bloodline Tower unifying the Western Region was suppressed.

..

New Calendar Year 4895.

The war between the two top families was still raging.

The impact of this five-year war on the world shocked everyone. This year, two great clans of the fifth circle fought, shocking the world!

It was said that even the land with the strength of ten thousand miles would turn into nothingness.

On that day, Eli also left the time fragment. Although he did not see the scene of the war, even the ruins of the battlefield made Eli feel threatened.

This year.

Eli had already spent sixty years in the arcane realm.

The laws was restless. At this moment, his law comprehension was getting deeper and deeper.

However, he was still far from breaking through the fifth circle.

..

Two hundred years in the secret realm was only ten years in the outside world.

New Calendar Year 4910.

Under the mediation of the Warlock Union, the two families finally stopped fighting and began to lick their wounds to recover.

However, there were two major events that happened this year!

The first was the northernmost part of the Northern Region. The Lich Tower had taken action, and hundreds of thousands of square kilometers of land had been completely transformed. Hundreds of thousands of Warlocks had been transformed into Liches. The world was shocked!

Secondly, the Sea Tribe of the Southern Region controlled the tsunami and turned thousands of miles of the Southern Region into a vast ocean. Millions of humans were killed or injured, and the ones who did this were the deep-sea races.

The Warlock Union was furious, but they were also shocked and terrified!

This was because the Seafolk in the deep sea had the power to invade the land, which meant that the war between the Sea races in the deep sea had most likely come to an end. The chaos that had been maintained for more than a thousand years might have ended.

The stability of the marine race was not a good thing for the Warlock Union!

And there was another thing that troubled them.

That is, in the green field, more and more foreign races have invested in Roland’s subordinates. ‘Eli’ had been relatively subdued.

There were always results, but there was always a balance.

They wanted to intervene, but this time, they were distracted by the Lich Tower and the Sea Tribe, so they had no spare energy to attack the ” unimportant ” Green Field. After all,” Roland ” didn’t give them much trouble.

In short, this decade was really an eventful one.

The outside world was in turmoil, but it didn’t affect Eli at all.

In the time fragment!

The timeline around Eli exploded, but he acted as if he did not see it. On the contrary, his consciousness was still immersed in his celestial world.

The power of celestial that hung high in the space of consciousness burned like a sun, emitting endless light and heat. However, in the middle of the sun, the black seed of the Law of Shadow was absorbing the power of celestial.

Compared to 300 years ago, the current Seed of Law was several times larger, and its color had become darker. The devouring power surrounding it had also become stronger, just like a small black hole!

“Time is almost up.”

Eli watched everything calmly.

300 years of comprehension, plus the past close to 3,000 years, made his comprehension of laws faster than expected. At this moment, he was already at his limit.

He was much stronger than he was 300 years ago. Those of the same level were no different from ants in his eyes, but what was the meaning of that?

“No matter how strong I am, I’m still at the fourth circle.” Eli’s eyes were filled with determination as if there were two sharp swords in his eyes!

” Prepare to break through!

Eli took a deep breath and took out three interspatial rings. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

One contained tens of millions of magic crystals, one contained rainbow light marrow, and the last contained nearly ten million units of high-level soul crystals.

The former came from the Bloodline Tower, while the latter two came from Nero.

This was all the resources he needed to break through. It was enough.

“The natural barrier of the Time Realm and the secrecy of this place is also the best place for me to break through.” Eli slowly got up and went deeper.

The more dangerous it was, the safer it was for him.

In the end, he stopped at the location where the time flow was 30 times faster.

A year later.

Eli, who had been adjusting for thirty years, opened his eyes. His eyes shone brightly, and the boundless Celestial Sun in his consciousness burned, emitting a scorching light that he had never seen before.

“Breakthrough!”

Eli took a deep breath, and his aura suddenly exploded.

Like a mountain or an ocean!
