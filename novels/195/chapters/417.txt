418 Three-sided Attack!

The 8-Armed Naga Army was divided into three directions: Nightfall City, Saka Plateau, and Crimson Moon Lake!

In every direction, there was a Radiant Sun Warlock from the Eight-Armed Naga family, as well as a large number of Warlocks and affiliated forces. There were at least 20 celestials.

This was a top-notch second-class force and all its subordinate forces.

It was no wonder that many factions didn’t think highly of the Bloodline Tower.

!!

At this moment.

Eli’s three doppelgangers had also arrived at the three battlefields and had hidden.

Outside Nightfall City, on top of a tall mountain, Eli stood on a tall tree and looked into the distance calmly!

“So many!” Eli’s gaze traveled dozens of miles and saw the Warlocks in this direction.

They had yet to launch an attack and were still on their way. Even with a rough estimate, there were tens of thousands of them. Even the third circle was an ordinary existence here. At the front of all the Warlocks, there were twenty-eight celestial Warlocks.

Twenty of them were Morning Star Warlocks, seven were Radiant Moons, and one was Radiant Sun. That Radiant Sun was Jesse.

He had dark purple long hair and wore dark purple leather armor. Behind him was a huge cloak that fluttered in the wind!

He stood on a huge war chariot and looked into the distance with a deep and calm gaze. It was obvious that he was full of confidence in this war.

The patriarch of the Eight-Armed Naga family!

“His strength is indeed not bad!” Eli commented. Then, he swayed his body and turned his gaze to the other side.

In that direction was Nightfall City.

Warlocks from the Bloodline Tower stood outside the city, nervously looking into the distance, waiting for their enemies. Some of them had come willingly, some were soldiers of the Bloodline Tower, and some were slaves of the Bloodline Tower!

But no matter what their identities were, everyone’s faces were filled with unease and nervousness.

They were very nervous, but no one retreated!

After a brief observation, Eli turned his gaze to the other two battlefields.

Saka Plateau.

This was the only plateau between the Eight-Armed Naga and the Bloodline Tower, northwest of the Bloodline Tower.

On the plateau, the two sides of the warlocks had already begun to confront each other.

On the Eight-Armed Naga’s side, a purple-haired woman calmly looked down at the battlefield on the ground. Behind her were twenty Celestial warlocks. Opposite them were seven or eight Celestial Sorcerers from the Bloodline Tower, led by Glen!

At this moment, he was looking at the woman nervously. The faint aura she emitted made him feel even more uneasy.

“They are waiting!” Glen calmly replied.

He knew very well that the woman’s mind was not on them at all, but on Eli, who had yet to appear.

As for Eli’s current position, even Glen didn’t know because he knew that the lord would make his own decision.

“Lord, don’t come here!” Glen pursed his lips and muttered silently!

The enemy this time was too strong, so strong that they could not see any hope at all.

If Eli left, it would be a good thing. At the very least, the Bloodline Tower would retain a portion of their bloodline, and they might be able to rise again. However, if he came and was killed by Jesse and the others, then there would be no hope.

“As for meIf it weren’t for you, I would have died already!” Glen’s gaze gradually became firm as he stared at this warlock with ill intentions.

He looked over with a determined gaze, but the woman only glanced at him and ignored him!

She was still waiting for news from Eli.

As for the others, they were not qualified to attract her attention!

Red Moon Lake!

This was a huge lake that looked like a crescent moon. It was about ten acres in size. The surface of the lake was clear, and there were many magical beasts living in it. Moreover, the bottom of the lake was rich in red crystals. As long as it was night, under the moonlight, it would emit a lake that looked like a crimson moon!

The situation here was similar to the Saka Plateau!

Tens of thousands of Warlocks were confronting each other, but no one attacked. The Radiant Sun Warlock here was a middle-aged Warlock with black hair and wrinkled skin. Not far away from him, the Warlocks led by Nikola, were staring at him.

Nikola looked at the Warlock and frowned.

Even facing this Radiant Sun Warlock made him feel a sense of despair. However, what made him feel despair was that even if he removed this Radiant Sun Warlock, he was not confident he could deal with the remaining Warlocks.

“Will the lord come?” Nikola pondered.

In fact, he did not know that Eli had a clone, so he was very nervous at the moment.

And with his understanding of EliNikola was silent!

Sir Eli seemed to always attack the forces by crushing them, but that was because he had absolute confidence. But this time? A full three Radiant Suns, could Eli really beat them? Moreover, it wasn’t just the Radiant Suns. Once Eli appeared, the other celestials on the battlefield might also join in the siege.

At that time, Eli was facing three Radiant Sun Warlocks and at least twenty celestials!

This level of siege was really too dangerous!

“Sir Eli!”

Nikola took a deep breath. He felt that his master might not show up this time!

The Radiant Sun Warlock looked at his expression and sneered.

A mere Bloodline Tower, did it really think that it was that powerful?

It was time for these guys to recognize reality!

Eli?

He would let him understand the power of the family. The era of Bloodline Tower had passed!

…..

...

While they were waiting, Eli, who was in the Grassi Land, was deep in thought!

He was thinking about where to go.

There wasn’t much difference between the three battlefields, but the number of celestials in the three battlefields was different.

The Warlock who followed Jesse was the strongest, so his clones would definitely face the most pressure. Eli’s plan was to let one clone hold on for as long as possible, and then wait for the other two clones to defeat the other Warlocks before providing support.

” So it’s the Crimson Moon Lake! ” Eli pursed his lips and made up his mind!

There were only 20 Celestial warlocks there, excluding Radiant Sun.

After making up his mind, the clones of Ely in the other two battlefields did not move. Eli’s clone, who had been hiding in the Crimson Moon Lake, suddenly flew into the sky and released his aura. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

At this moment, the battlefield not far away was in chaos. Nikola saw Eli and was dumbfounded.

“My lord!” he shouted.

He had never expected that Eli would already be here. The Warlocks on the ground also looked up.

“Our lord actually came.”

...

“I knew you wouldn’t give up on us!”

“Sir Eli!”

The Warlocks were in the army, and some of them were so excited that they even shed tears. In the eyes of some Warlocks, Eli, who had saved the Bloodline Tower several times, was no different from a god!

At this moment, the god had come to save them again!

However, compared to those Warlocks, the Eight-Armed Naga, the Radiant Sun Warlock Randolf, looked at Eli and laughed loudly.

“Eli, you’re here to die!”

He reached his hand into his pocket, and the spatial imprint emitted a special response!

At the same time, the eyes of the eight-armed snake demon Jesse and the other Radiant Sun Warlock named Heda lit up.

The two of them instantly took out their tokens and crushed them. In the next second, the space in front of them turned into layers of ripples and turned into a huge vortex. The two of them directly entered and disappeared from everyone’s sight.

In the distant Crimson Moon Lake, Jesse and Hedda shook their heads as they walked out of the void, flying on both sides of Randolf.

“Eli, I didn’t expect you to really come!” Jesse looked at Ely with a ferocious expression.

On the other side, Heda was also looking at Eli, seemingly surprised by Eli’s courage!

Meanwhile, Eli looked at the three of them calmly. He looked at Jesse and asked, “I wonder if anyone mentioned something?”

“What?” Jesse frowned!

“You look ugly when you smile!” Eli smiled.

Jesse’s face instantly darkened!

” Let me see if your strength is as sharp as your mouth! ”

“Come on!”

Jesse’s eyes were cold as he flew toward the sky.

Eli smiled and followed them into the sky. The two Radiant Sun Warlocks followed suit.

As for the other Celestial warlocks, ten of them followed him, while the rest stopped Nikola and the other Celestial warlocks who wanted to help!

The sky was split into two parts. One of them was led by Jos, followed by two Radiant Suns, followed by the other ten celestials. The other side was empty, with only Eli. He looked like a lone warrior facing a natural disaster!

In the next second!

Jesse shouted loudly, and his huge body suddenly began to enlarge, turning into an eight-armed snake demon that was nearly six hundred meters tall. Each of his hands was even holding a special large-scale magic weapon. The two Radiant Suns behind him looked at each other and instantly transformed into two giant creatures that were nearly five hundred meters tall.

Many celestials also transformed into various bloodline true bodies and surrounded the Radiant Suns!

After transforming, everyone looked at Eli.

A few seconds later, a huge shadow dragon stepped out of the darkness. Its huge dragon claws were silver and emitted a dangerous aura. After the last breakthrough, its body was now close to 700 meters tall.

So when Eli lowered his head and looked at these people with his dark golden dragon eyes filled with coldness, everyone’s hearts skipped a beat!

“Could it be that he has broken through? However, his aura seems to be alright!”

Jos pursed his lips, and a trace of doubt flashed through his mind. However, after a few seconds, he said calmly, ” Eli, if that’s all, you’ll die here today. ”

“Then try me,” Eli said calmly.

In the next second.

Countless black-purple blood aura surged towards Eli, and the endless shadows came forward to defend.

In the blood and shadows, the Eight-Armed Naga had already collided with the huge shadow dragon!

The battle was about to start!
