222 Eli Appears

“Kloss is indeed not simple.”

At this moment, in a hidden corner of the valley, Eli saw this scene and cursed.

He had transferred a part of the authority of the spell formation to Nikola to see if he could reveal more of his trump cards, and it seemed like it was not a bad idea.

Kloss didn’t have the bloodline of a fire elemental elf. From his current performance, he should have the superior bloodline of the fire elemental bloodline, the bloodline of the fire elemental commander, and a third-circle ultimate bloodline.

He had hidden it well enough!

If it were not for the thirty water element spell formations, they might not have been able to force it out. As expected, letting Nikola go up and get beaten first, no, a probe was a good choice.

“But I still have to wait. It’s not time yet. I still need an opportunity.” Eli took a deep breath, his eyes no longer fixed on Kloss. Staring for a long time might make him notice.

“But Vivika has changed a lot!” He stopped looking at Kloss and looked at the woman opposite her.

Vivika!

There were not many changes to her face, but the bloodline had changed her hair color and the color of her eyes. She was inexplicably beautiful, and she had matured a lot. She was no longer the same girl from back then.

“Time really flies!”

Eli sighed. If he hadn’t been suddenly swept into the arcane realm back then, perhaps her fate would have been completely different from this, and this wouldn’t have happened.

With the activation of Kloss’ bloodline, the situation changed once again.

“Damn it, the fire type element spirit commander bloodline? ” Vivika gritted her teeth and stared at Kloss.

“Not bad, you have some knowledge!” Kloss smiled and stretched his body. It had been a long time since he had fully activated his bloodline. He looked at Nikola and said, “What about you? Do you still have any trump cards? Not bad, you’ve managed to get your hands on so many high-level spell formations. You’re so outstanding that I can’t help but want to tear you apart!”

Nikola smiled awkwardly and felt his heart palpitate.

They couldn’t even defeat the weakened Kloss, so what should they do now? Moreover, his master had only given him the authority to set up 30 spell formations, so he could not do anything else!

“He’s still not making a move?” At this time, Vivika looked over and said telepathically.

“When the time is right, master will make a move,” Nikola replied.

Even though he answered like this on the surface, he was already screaming in his heart. ‘When does master plan to make a move?’

“Come on!”

At the same time, Kloss launched another attack at the two of them. Terrifying flames appeared one after another, making it difficult for the two of them to block them.

After all, Vivika had already fought a battle and was exhausted. Nikola was also a spirit and could not resist locks, who had the fire elemental bloodline, which made the situation worse.

Time passed by quickly.

After dodging the attack again, Vivika held her injured left arm and felt that she only had one-third of her bloodline power left in her body. She couldn’t help but feel despair.

In fact, she had already given up on Nikola’s master.

If he was really strong, how could he hold back and not make a move now? How cautious or passive was he? Even in her past years, she had almost never seen such a person.

Of course, this was with the exception of a certain guy who had trained his students for more than ten years to explore mystic realms for him.

“Achoo!”

Eli rubbed his nose. He had actually sneezed. Fortunately, this place was soundproof. However, when he looked up and saw the two of them, who were on the verge of death, he finally decided to do something.

Bang! Bang!

He activated the five third-circle spell formations and tried another probe.

..

“A new spell formation?”

With a ball of fire in his hand, Kloss suddenly felt that it was a little harder to gather the fire, and his aura was a little weaker. He looked at Nikola with a strange expression.

There was actually another trump card.

Obviously, he was not the only one who had sensed the existence of the spell formation. Nikola and Vivika had also sensed it. Vivika looked at Nikola and scolded, “And why didn’t you use this spell formation earlier!”

He looked into Vivika’s eyes.

Nikola was cursing in his heart.

‘I didn’t f * cking do it. It must have been master.’ However, he couldn’t say it out loud at this moment. He could only smile awkwardly at Kloss.

“Are you provoking me?”

Kloss, on the other hand, thought that this was a provocation.

“Don’t think that this little spell formation can do anything.” Kloss snorted and quickly approached Nikola. He was a little angry.

In just a dozen seconds, Nikola was hit by several sets of attacks from locks. All kinds of innate bloodline spells directly beat Nikola!

Nikola also had his own difficulties, but he could only bear them and curse in his heart.

Kloss, who sensed Nikola’s emotions, became even angrier because it was directed at him, and he continued to beat him up.

Fortunately, Vivika made a move in time and saved the seriously injured Nikola. Otherwise, he would have been killed immediately.

Just like that, Eli activated five spell formations every minute. The activated spell formations were not just simple suppression spell formations. There were also attack spell formations, control spell formations, and charm spell formations …

This made Kloss more and more furious.

After breaking free from the vines again, Kloss was furious. He stared at Nikola and shouted, “Nikola, I want you dead!”

‘It really wasn’t me!’

Nicholas was wailing in his heart. In just ten minutes, he had become the main target. He had almost been killed by locks several times, but he was always saved by a spell formation that suddenly appeared nearby.

“Good job!” Vivika also nodded. This guy really had a lot of spell formations.

Nikola, “…”

It really wasn’t him!

“Nikola, go to hell!”

The violent attacks came again. Although it had been weakened by nearly 30%, Kloss’ combat power was still above the two of them. The difficult battle began again.

However, to his surprise, there were no more spell formations.

Kloss also heaved a sigh of relief. He had no idea where Nikola had gathered nearly 50 five-formation spells. It was a pity that they were too weak, and the gap was too big.

Without the obstruction of the spell formation, Kloss’ attacks became even more ferocious.

Nikola was attacked by a huge ball of fire. His soul was burning in the fire, and then he was thrown aside by Kloss like garbage, struggling.

On the other hand, Vivika was panting heavily after blocking an attack. She felt the bloodline power in her body was almost exhausted, and her face was bitter.

Another minute passed.

Vivika fell from the sky and crashed into the ground with a loud bang. A large pit appeared, and the smoke dissipated. She held her chest and spat out a mouthful of red blood.

She turned her head and looked not far away. Nikola’s soul was also severely injured.

“Is it going to end?”

Vivika’s face was filled with despair as she watched Kloss slowly descend from the sky.

“it’s time to end the bloodline tower. Vivika, if you hand over the key Natasha gave you and become my slave, I can spare your life!”

Kloss smiled slowly. Although he had used up a lot of his energy and was still under the suppression of a large number of spell formations, it was no longer important. The battle should end.

“Key?”

Vivika frowned, not quite understanding, but the second half of the sentence made her angry. “Just kill me.”

“You don’t know? It’s looks like I’ll have to search for it myself,” Kloss’ soul power directly probed Vivika’s brain. He wanted to use a secret soul-searching technique he had learned in the past!

Vivika also gritted her teeth and felt humiliated, but at this time, she had no ability to resist at all. Nikola was not far away on the ground, unable to stop him.

“huh? What’s this? Slave brand? ” Kloss exclaimed. In the corner of Vivika’s soul, a Soul brand was floating quietly. Was Vivika enslaved to someone? This was too shocking.F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“Who put the brand there?” Kloss had a bad feeling and frowned at Vivika.

Vivika looked at him but didn’t answer.

“Forget it. I’ll just look at it myself.”

Kloss smiled, but his body froze in the next second.

In an instant, he felt a powerful force gathering behind him. He turned his head abruptly.

A dozen meters away, a person wrapped in shadows had appeared out of nowhere. Only his eyes could be seen, and in his hand was a jet-black energy that contained a terrifying amount of energy.

Just as he looked over, his energy had already erupted, and a black pillar of light flew over.

“What?”

Kloss’ eyes widened.

In the next second, he was devoured by the black light. The powerful attack sent him flying dozens of meters away, and he crashed into the mountain wall. He sank deep into the mountain, causing a loud boom.

“The brand is mine!”

By now, the shadow had already dispersed, and Eli slowly walked out and answered Kloss’ question.

“Master!”

Nikola was on the verge of tears, looking at this scene!

He had almost been beaten to death, but his master had finally come out. But to his surprise, Vivika seemed to be even more emotional than him.

Blood stained her lips as Vivika half-knelt on the ground. Although she was seriously injured, her bright eyes were staring at the stranger in front of her. She wanted to say something, but she couldn’t.

It wasn’t because he had saved her life, nor was it because he was indeed very strong.

It was because of the soul brand that had been silent for hundreds of years in her body.

It moved!
