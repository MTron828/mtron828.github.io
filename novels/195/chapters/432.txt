433 A Beautiful Coincidence

“The Bloodline Tower of the Western Regions?”

While Eli was observing Gade, he was also observing Eli. Generally speaking, people would not come outside of the warlock world for no reason. Generally speaking, their strength would not be too weak because occasionally, some powerful creatures would pass by in the void, and even those world fragments might hide powerful creatures.

Those who could come here were basically Radiant Moons and above.

However, what made him feel strange was that he seemed to not understand this Warlock in front of him. He kept feeling that his blood and aura were very strange, but it still gave him a sense of unease!

!!

There was also the Bloodline Tower. As a Celestial warlock of the Thousand-Eyed Tree Demon clan, a major force in the central region, he had never heard of this force!

In the Western Region, most Warlocks in the Central Region only knew about the Heart of Abyss.

However, Gade quickly calmed down. He reached out his hand and smiled.” Bloodline Tower? I seem to have heard of it. Nice to meet you, Eli! ”

Eli smiled back. Of course, he didn’t take it seriously, but he was still curious about the question just now. He asked, “I wonder what you mean when you said that this area is not recommended to enter?”

“Is this your first time here?” Gade didn’t answer but asked.

“Yes.” Eli nodded and admitted his ignorance.

“No wonder!”

Gade suddenly realized and said, “I see. Then let me explain it to you. Do you know about the war that involved the Mage World and many affiliated worlds against that civilization thousands of years ago? ”

“I know!” Eli nodded.

“That explains it!” Gade nodded. ” Since you’ve seen those world fragments, you should be able to guess where they came from. They were all worlds that were shattered during the war.

“However, since you know their opponents, you must also be very clear about the strangeness of that world. Moreover, most of these world fragments still retain the remnants from that strange civilization!”

“Ah!” Eli’s mouth was wide open, and he even subconsciously took a step back.

In the story that Nicholas had told him, those strange infections had also left a deep impression on him!

“Hehe, there’s no need to be nervous.” Gade smiled as if recalling his first time here. He had a similar reaction.

“Don’t worry. Although the power in these world fragments still remains, those strange creatures were basically killed in that war. The remnants now don’t have the effect of infection. But every world fragment still has some remnants, ” Gade said. ” And the world fragments in this area are more dangerous with concentrated pollution! ”

“I see!”

Eli was also enlightened. He knew that if there were really remnants, why would the Mages leave them behind?

“Then what you mean is that other areas with less pollution can still be entered, right?” asked Eli.

“Yes!” Gade nodded, then he seemed to have thought of something and said to Eli, “Actually, most of the world fragments in these regions have yet to be explored. It’s like this. I found a rather large world fragment in another region earlier, and I’m going to invite some people to explore it. I’ve already invited three celestials. I wonder if you’re interested? ”

Exploring the world fragment?

Eli frowned. Actually, he wasn’t against these things. As long as he didn’t go in with his main body, it was fine.

Moreover, he was quite curious about which civilization it was. Perhaps he could find something interesting by exploring the world fragment. After all, it was a world that almost collapsed the mage World. Its strength was ridiculously high!

However, there was a very serious problem now. Once the distance was too far, his clone might lose control. Even if he wanted to go, he might not be able to. As for his main body? Don’t joke around. How could he risk his life? It didn’t match his personality!

However, he did not want to miss this opportunity!

‘Maybe I can build something like a signal tower. That way, I can connect my faith avatars further!’ Eli pondered!

When faced with a problem, it was Eli’s instinct to think of a solution. He also had some ideas!

From a certain perspective, the statue of Faith in the distant Green Field was a base station. However, if he enlarged the statue, then used spiritual materials and continuously infiltrated it with the power of faith, he should be able to expand his influence and reach further places. Therefore, the feasibility of this idea was very high!

Thus, he felt that he could still agree temporarily.

Thinking of this, Eli looked at Gade and smiled. “Of course. I’m also very interested in these world fragments. ”

“That’s great!” Gade smiled. ” It’s like this. We plan to go to that world fragment in 30 years. If you want to go, come back here in 30 years. Then we’ll go to that world fragment together! ”

“Alright!” Eli nodded.

In any case, he would either not go or go as a clone, so there was nothing to worry about.

Gade nodded in agreement, but the next second, he raised his eyebrows and apologized to him, “I’m sorry. Something seems to have happened in my faction. I might need to leave for a while. See you in 30 years! ”

“Alright.” Eli nodded.

A few seconds later, Gade left, and Eli turned to look at the world fragments behind him before turning to leave.

Forget about it this time. We’ll talk about it in 30 years.

In any case, for fourth-circle Warlocks, although their lifespan was affected by the world, thirty years was still within an acceptable range.

…

On the other side.

Gade flew through the atmosphere of the warlock world and entered the sky above the central continent. He then flew towards a familiar location and finally landed in a bustling city.

There were countless Warlocks below the ground. There were many First and Second circle Warlocks and many Third circle Warlocks. Gade only took a glance and flew directly to a Wizard Tower in the center of the city, an area that was isolated from other cities. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

As soon as he entered the Magus Tower, a Warlock in a white shirt and black suit approached him like a butler.

“What happened?” Gade asked.

“Sir, something has happened in the Western Regions. A top-tier Eight-Armed Naga died, and a portion of the remaining Warlocks sneaked out and appeared in our territory. I think this might be a hidden danger, and we need Sir to make a decision.” the butler said quickly.

“The Western Regions?” Gade frowned. This was the second time he had heard about the Western Regions today.

Moreover, a second-class force was a major force even in the central region. No one dared to ignore it. As a Radiant Sun Sorcerer, he naturally understood most of the second-class forces on the continent. He had heard of this force and understood that it was not weaker than his family.

He was suddenly curious as to which force had destroyed the Eight-Armed Naga.

“Which faction did this? The Heart of the Abyss? No, they seem to be quite peace-loving. They haven’t attacked anyone for more than a thousand years!” Gade frowned.

” Sir, it’s a new rising force called the Bloodline Tower. It’s said that this battle was fought by a powerful Warlock named Eli. He fought against three Radiant Suns and killed them all before destroying this family! ” the butler said calmly.

The butler was still waiting for the lord’s response, but when he saw the lord this time, he froze on the spot.

...

“I’m fine!” Gade recovered, waved his hand, and let out a long sigh of relief.

“Damn it. I didn’t expect him to be such a strong person. Fortunately, he didn’t have any ill intentions!”

He wiped away the cold sweat on his head, feeling a lingering fear!

However, it seemed that Eli was easy to get along with, and he had even agreed to explore the world fragment with him.

So …

“Pass down the order to get rid of the remaining forces. The Thousand-Eyed Tree Demon family mustn’t get involved in these troubles!” he said to the butler.

“Yes, sir!”

The butler nodded and left quickly.
