454 Meeting Jin Ji Again, A Gift

The huge Sky Cloud Whale stood not far from the Bloodline City. Compared to other Cloud Whales, this fourth circle Sky Cloud Whale was 3,000 meters long and blocked the entire city. The castle on top of it was several acres in size, covering the city.

Thank you readers!

Those with connections knew who it was, and those without connections knew that it was probably the higher-ups of the Golden Cicada Chamber of Commerce.

Indeed.

Eli only took a glance at the four-ringed Sky Cloud Whale before turning back.

What entered his eyes was an ancient and warm room. The brown sofa was neither too hard nor too soft, and the orange alchemy lamp emitted a warm light.

Jin Ji was sitting on the sofa. He was wearing his signature golden clothes, all kinds of precious magic tools, and ten rings on his finger. He was a little fat, and his face looked like a wealthy middle-aged man. He looked like a shrewd businessman!

But at this moment, his eyes were slightly misty, and tears flashed in his eyes. He looked at Eli and choked,” Without Herman, there would be no me. Unfortunately, I didn’t even know he died! ”

“Time is merciless!”

Eli shook his head and sat back on the sofa.

This time, he still chose to keep his identity and not expose himself.

Eternal life was a secret, a secret that could not be revealed. Perhaps in the future, when Jin Ji was about to die, Eli would go and meet him as Herman, but for now, it was better to forget about it.

At present, he did not have the ability to expose the power of eternal life!

“Thank you for telling me the story of my lord.” Jin Ji wiped away his tears and thanked him.

Half an hour ago, the two of them met in this room. After a simple conversation, they started talking about Herman.

” It’s okay. You’re the person that teacher once helped. I’m teacher’s student. ” Eli smiled.

“Yes.” Jin Ji nodded, then looked up at Eli again and sighed, “Actually, you speak very much like my lord. It even makes me feel like I’m seeing my lord again.”

“I’ve been by Teacher’s side for hundreds of years, and I’ve been greatly influenced,” Eli said casually.

“That’s true.” “My lord has helped me a lot, so I always miss him,” said Jin Ji with a smile.

“I can tell!” Eli smiled.

Even though they had not been able to recognize each other, it was still a rare opportunity for Eli to see someone he knew.

At the very least, this proved that he had left behind many traces in the past!

“Yes.” Jin Ji nodded again. He was almost a thousand years old. At this age, he missed the past more than young people.

Meeting Eli was like meeting a very good friend. Although this friend’s strength was not inferior to his, it was very reasonable. After all, he was his master’s student. Awesome!

Of course, his goal wasn’t just to meet. After all, his success was inseparable from the Bloodline Tower. However, the two of them hadn’t even met yet. Therefore, apart from meeting Eli today to reminisce about the past, he also wanted to deepen the relationship between the two of them.

“Good!”

Eli nodded, not suspecting him. If Jin Ji were only here to meet him, that would be disrespectful.

In his memory, Jin Ji was a shrewd and knowledgeable young man. A thousand years had passed, and this would only deepen with time!

Very soon, a new round of cooperation discussions began. The two of them were also talking about cooperation in the general direction, such as cooperation in magic potions, cooperation in wizard tools, as well as various aspects of the layout and contact, etc. During this process, Eli also confirmed that Jin Ji really cared about the old friendship. At least, many of the conditions were not very businesslike, and the benefits he gave were too much!

Of course, it was only the general direction. Some details would naturally be discussed by the subordinates. It was a rather complicated and huge project!

Three hours later, the discussion ended!

“Since the matter is over, logically speaking, I should be leaving. I don’t know what else you want to ask. As long as I know, I’ll try my best to answer it!” Jin Ji said in a relaxed manner.

” There’s a problem. There’s no more cooperation, but I really want to ask some questions. I wonder what’s beyond the fourth circle level? ” Eli asked directly.

Hearing the question, Jin Ji was also stunned. After thinking for a moment, he replied, “Above the fourth circle? Actually, this should be related to the fifth ring. It’s top-secret knowledge. However, for someone at your level, it’s only a matter of time before you know.

“The fifth circle was actually very difficult for Warlocks to cross. Firstly, the bloodline was the first obstacle. If the bloodline did not reach the standard, it would be very difficult. However, there was another requirement. The fifth circle required one to completely understand the bloodline, either the essence of the bloodline or the laws contained in the bloodline.

“You should know about the laws, right?”

“I know.” Eli nodded. In fact, he still had a complete shadow law in his hands.

Jin Ji nodded and continued, “Comprehending nomological laws is naturally a very difficult task. It’s impossible for most warlocks, but there are some who can comprehend nomological laws and finally break through fifth circle. This is a process, so they call the realm before breaking through the seed stage, also known as half-step fifth circle! ”

“Seeds? Half-fifth circle?”

Eli’s eyes lit up when he heard this. He didn’t know about this.

” That’s right. The seed stage. In fact, it’s the formation of a nomological seed in one’s bloodline. Then, one will constantly comprehend the nomological laws until they break through. This is characteristic of this stage. For example, Nero from the Heart of the Abyss is at this stage! ” Jin Ji nodded.

Nero was a half-step fifth circle…This might be the reason why he could not predict it…However, it seemed that Tuman was also a half-step fifth-circle warlock.

Eli thought of some knowledge he had recently learned and nodded.

” Anyway, that’s all. After that, it involves the fifth circle. I signed a contract, so I can’t tell you much, but I can tell you that Warlocks at this stage are far more powerful than the fourth circle. With the support of the law, the power of a spell is at least ten times that of a peak four-circle. It’s possible for a person to fight dozens of peak four-circle warlocks. Only a force with a fifth-circle warlock can be called a first-class force. You’d better not provoke a Warlock at this stage! ” Jin Ji said with a smile.

“Of course, I won’t cause trouble for myself.” Eli smiled and nodded, but he was even more vigilant.

After reaching the fourth circle, the difference between each circle was even greater than before. The change from the fourth ring to the fifth ring was also another level of change. Even if it was only a transition state, it was also the beginning of a qualitative change.

“Yes, that’s all. Do you have any other questions?” Jin Ji asked again.

“No more!” Eli shook his head.

“Alright, it’s about time. I should leave now!” Jin Ji nodded and prepared to leave.

Just as Eli was about to get up, he suddenly saw Jin Ji turn his head again as if he had remembered something. “I almost forgot. I brought back something from my trip this time. If your master were still here, he would definitely be very interested. But since he is no longer here, I’ll give it to you as a gift!”

Gift? Something Herman would be interested in?

If he remembered correctly, it seemed that he had only asked Jin Ji to help him find the knowledge to break through to the fifth circle.

No way, no way! Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Eli pursed his lips, and his eyes lit up as he looked at Jin Ji!

Jin Ji slowly took out a crystal ball and said to Eli, “It’s a piece of knowledge for a mage to break through to the fifth circle. ”

Plop!

As if a stone had fallen into the bottom of a river, Eli closed his eyes to hide the joy in his heart, but he was more emotional!

The seed that he had planted back then had borne fruit once again!

Two fruits!
