232 Three Directions

In the end, Eli decided on a few main paths.

There were three main paths and three main research areas.

The first was the shadow sorcery that relied on the power of shadow and darkness. This had always been Eli’s main fighting force. Although it originated from the bloodline of the shadow Dragon, it had already surpassed its original state under Eli’s constant research.

Moreover, he planned to merge the devouring spell with the shadow force slowly. The two were quite compatible. He could also simplify his methods.

The second was elemental sorcery. In this area, Eli mainly focused on Wind and Fire sorcery. These were the best aspects of Eli’s talent. Of course, he would also be involved in other elements, so he tried to avoid his shortcomings.

The third was to dig deeper into the shadow dragon’s bloodline. As a powerful creature with Five circle, the shadow dragon’s bloodline power wasn’t just about shadow control. It also had powerful strengths and other aspects that could be learned and utilized.

There were three main research areas.

The first was potions and mechanical alchemy.

Needless to say, potionology had always been what Eli was good at, and it had helped him a lot. It was just that he was a little lacking at the moment. Of course, he could not be blamed for this. As his strength increased, there were fewer potions that could not help him.

Moreover, high-level magic plants were even more precious, so it would be a little troublesome to get them.

There was also mechanical alchemy. Previously, he had mainly studied alchemy.

The West Coast was the main gathering place for dark Magi, but they did not have much knowledge of this thing. They were obviously more interested in life, death, and other things. Light Magi were the main researchers in this area.

The history of the mages had also proven that mechanical alchemy had a greater impact on the mage world. Whether it was internal development or the conquest of the endless world, they all played a greater role.

Of course, the most important point was the planet-sized Mage Tower.

Even though it was just a legend, it was still something that Eli yearned for. Since so many people were looking for it, it might really be real. If he really encountered it and it was damaged, it would be awkward if he couldn’t repair it.

Besides, this was very powerful knowledge, so it would be a waste not to learn it.

Moreover, he had another motive in his heart. If such a powerful thing really existed, it would be best if it was in his hands.

It was a potential risk for him to develop in the mage world if it was in someone else’s hands. He knew that he might be thinking too much, but he had a long life, so he naturally had to think further.

As long as he didn’t die, he would definitely become stronger and stronger.

Everything was just in preparation for a rainy day, even though it might be thousands or tens of thousands of years early.

This was the first direction. The second direction was the research of soul imprints and the statue of faith.

Whether it was the soul brand or the power of faith, they were all very promising. Although he was not clear about these, Eli had a vague feeling that they might be of some use to him.

At worst, he would just have to waste a few hundred years, so Eli chose to believe in his intuition.

The third direction was much simpler, and that was to collect all kinds of strange knowledge.

As Eli came to understand strange witchcraft such as curse witchcraft, the die of fate, and the blood-burning secret technique, he gradually realized that he didn’t have to walk the right path. He could also try the crooked path.

Life was a very precious thing, but to him, it was just a very ordinary thing. It was an endless source of resources, just like magic stones. If he could convert it into combat power, it would be great.

These were all of Eli’s thoughts. It was also the first time in hundreds of years that Eli had a systematic understanding of himself and a judgment of his future development.

Of course, this was just a preliminary idea. As time passed, it would definitely change slowly. However, the overall route would be like this.

As for other things such as chimeras, it was a different matter.

“Take it slow, time is on my side!”

Eli’s gaze was calm. As a third-circle warlock, he had a lot more choices than before.

“What? teacher, you’re going to leave the bloodline tower for the time being?!”

The next day, Vivika was surprised when she heard the news.

“Well, I’m planning to study some things. The central continent is still too complicated. The South of the West Coast might be more suitable for me!”

After thinking about the strategy, he had to implement it.

However, whether it was for experiments or resource allocation, although the southern region had few resources and wasn’t large, it was completely in his hands. He could do whatever he wanted, but in the bloodline tower, he was constantly under the observation of several other major forces. Each of them had third circles, and some of them were stronger than Eli. Thus, he decided to return to the southern region.

Seeing how resolute Eli was, Vivika nodded helplessly.

“teacher, if you need any resources, you can tell me directly. The bloodline tower can help,” Vivika said.

“That’s for sure,” Naturally, Eli would not stand on ceremony.

“Alright!” Vivika smiled. “Then, teacher, when do you plan to leave?”

“Tomorrow, I guess.”

..

A day later.

At noon.

A venom Wyvern flew out of the bloodline tower and headed south.

“Milord, are we leaving just like that?” Nikola asked in confusion.

Ever since they dealt with Kloss, he had been staying at the bloodline tower. To be more precise, he had been by Eli’s side.

“yes, the problem has been solved. It’s time to leave.” Eli turned to look.

At this moment, the sun hung high in the sky, its gentle light shining on the ground. The entire bloodline tower seemed to be covered in a golden veil, making it extremely peaceful and beautiful.

This was what he wanted.

A stable environment.

To Eli, a stable environment was the foundation of development. It was something he could not do without, and this was precisely why he had come to the central region this time.

Now that everything was settled, it was naturally time to return home.

“I just don’t know how long this can last!”

Eli sighed. There would be all sorts of disputes in the mortal world every few years. There would also be the same things happening in the mage world every few decades. However, some things were already very small and could not affect him.

He just wanted to become stronger slowly and steadily, but trouble kept coming to him.

But this time, things should be stable for a long time. After all, within the West Coast, Eli couldn’t think of any major events that would happen. Due to the existence of the West Coast treaty, although there were small conflicts between the forces, there were almost no major conflicts. The forces in the South had basically been absorbed by the White Tower. The White Tower had already occupied the entire South and had no more space to expand.

What could go wrong?

…Of course, everything would change if the ruins of the sky city were found.

“However, we haven’t found any clues for hundreds of years. It’ll be fine!”

Eli sighed, then turned to look ahead and tapped the venom Wyvern.

“Return to the White Tower!”

The venom Wyvern instantly accelerated and left with the two of them.

In the blink of an eye, they disappeared from sight.
