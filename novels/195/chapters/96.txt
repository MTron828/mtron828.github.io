97 Anna

“Teacher!” It had been a long time since Anna had heard her teacher’s name.

In the outside world, everyone said that although the first princess was beautiful, she seemed to be uninterested in men. However, only Anna knew that she already had someone in her heart.

Her teacher!

Eli.

It was very strange. When she first saw her teacher, she felt an inexplicable attraction to him. Later on, after she was planted with a Soul brand, the attraction became deeper. In fact, it had gone beyond that.

It could be called faith.

In fact, this was also why Mages were so terrifying in the mortal world. With their mental force, they had a high chance of truly controlling a person and making them obey them from the heart.

“Bring him in. No, I’ll personally welcome him.” After hesitating for a moment, Anna immediately stood up, ignoring the fact that her dress was dragging on the ground, and immediately walked out.

In another waiting room, she saw Eli.

Although Eli looked very old, with his hair and beard all white, Anna still rushed over and hugged him just like that morning twelve years ago.

“Teacher, I missed you so much!”

The corners of Eli’s mouth twitched. His bones were almost cracking.

“I also miss little Anna!” After being released, Eli touched Anna’s head.

“Okay, you guys go out first.” A smile appeared on Anna’s face as she turned to the other guards who were still there.

The guards looked at each other and immediately left.

After everyone had left, Anna pulled on Eli’s hand and sat down on the sofa at the side. She then told him about the things that had happened during the twelve years he had been gone, and he listened patiently.

From Anna’s mouth, Eli also learned more about Bryne.

For example, the reason for the outbreak of the war and the current predicament.

“Teacher, how have you been all these years?” Anna asked, blinking her big eyes.

Eli stroked his beard and then said, “That is a long story…”

As Eli explained, Anna listened.

The relationship between the two of them was not like the master-slave relationship between him and Aria. They were closer. After all, he was Anna’s teacher.

However, he still had absolute control over Anna.

“Forget it. Let’s not talk about this. Tell me about your situation.” The current situation of the inheritance of the throne. After chatting for a while, Eli changed the topic. He had not forgotten his purpose. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Along the way, he felt that the situation was different from what he had expected.

“Teacher, there might have been an accident.” Anna pursed her lips, then told him about the current situation.

And that was that she might not be able to inherit the throne.

Eli raised his eyebrows. He did not expect Bryne the seventh to be so unruly.

He was really a disdainful Emperor!

However, Eli did not panic. In fact, when he advanced to a level 3 apprentice, he could turn many things around. He could have infiltrated the palace and dug out the things inside or done other things.

However, back then, Eli’s thoughts were very simple. If the things under the main palace couldn’t be moved via normal means, he would use the power of the royal family, so he had been waiting.

The main reason was to be absolutely safe.

After all, there was only one copy of Saleen metatrin’s legacy, and there could not be any accidents.

“Do you have any ideas?” Eli asked.

“Teacher, I know you need me to inherit the throne, but at the moment, there are only three ways. The first is to change my father’s will. The second is to kill him. This way, it may be carried out according to the law, and I will be the new queen. The third is to kill my two younger brothers!”

Eli blinked.

Her train of thought was very clear, but it was a little strange.

“However, my father’s will can not be changed. He is a stubborn old man. If I really want to kill him, it will be very difficult for me to do it. After all, he is my father.” Anna was silent.

“What about your two younger brothers?” Eli asked.

It sounded like she wanted to go for the third option!

“At present, I want to kill them. They are not my mother’s children but other women’s children. Each of them has a lot of power behind them. Even if my father really died, I may not be able to inherit the throne. So, as long as they die, no one will stand in my way,” Anna said.

At this moment, she really did look like a person in power.

Or rather, she would only reveal her true form when there were no outsiders around or in front of Eli.

A truly weak person would never be able to lead a country. Back then, Eli had thought that she was a very interesting little girl.

“How’s your preparation going?” Eli asked.

“At present, there are many people who support me, but compared to my two younger brothers, I’m still slightly lacking. This battle may last for a long time. I’m worried that my father may end it early. He has always wanted my two younger brothers to inherit the throne.” Anna was a little worried.

If her father had really died, it would have been better. That way, she would have been able to fight with all her might. But now, not only was she facing the powerful support of the two brothers, but she could also be stabbed in the back by the king. She really couldn’t do anything.

“I see!”

Eli thought for a moment. It was indeed troublesome.

The main purpose of his return this time around was to retrieve Saleen metatrin’s legacy. It was best not to have any accidents happen, and he did not want to cause any more trouble.

Unlike before, he now had enough power to do what he wanted.

Back then, Saleen metatrin had been able to build such a huge country by himself in just a few years, even though he had brought along a student who was a burden.

Now, it was time for him to make a move.

It was a good opportunity to test his strength.

“Leave this matter to me, your teacher. I’ll help you.” Eli patted Anna’s shoulder and said.

“Yes, Thank you, teacher.” Anna nodded.

Although she didn’t know her teacher’s actual identity, she knew that her teacher was definitely not an ordinary person. She absolutely believed in Eli and believed that he could do it.

“Yes, it’s getting late. Send me their information and their schedules tomorrow.” Eli nodded.

“Teacher, it’s already very late. Why don’t you stay in the palace? I can stay here too. I want to talk to you more.” Anna said shyly.

“No, it’s better for you to sleep early.” Eli patted Anna’s head and left.

The next day.

Eli received Anna’s message.

Three days later.

The second Prince was dead.

The Empire was in turmoil and the entire country was shocked.
