156 Ready to Return

At the same time.

A meeting was being held in a huge tent. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

The chairman of the White Tower, Marcus, stood in the main position, with a few second-circle warlocks on both sides, as well as a large number of first-circle warlocks. These were the main fighting force of the White Tower at the moment.

“Who can tell us what the current situation is? Kratos, you do it.” Marcus asked as he looked at Kratos.

“At the moment, we should be evenly matched. If we want to take the lead in the next battle, this is definitely not enough. We need more forces.” Kratos said.

“Well, whoever has an idea can suggest it today,” Marcus asked as he looked at the crowd.

“I suggest that we negotiate with the Blood Alliance and surrender some benefits. After all, we are just a new force. It may be disadvantageous for us if we drag this on. Another two-circle sorcerer opposite Kratos said.

“Surrender? That won’t do, Jesse. If we show weakness when we’re new, it’ll be troublesome later on. After all, we don’t want our newly established force to be destroyed.” Marcus shook his head.

“Alright,” Jesse nodded.

“Then why don’t we contact some external forces? ” Another two-circle sorcerer said. He was one of the few two-circle sorcerers and one of the Deputy Chairmen. His name was Theron.

“That won’t do either. The other forces nearby are all watching and won’t get involved.” Marcus shook his head again.

After the three Deputy chairmen spoke, the other warlocks began to speak. They kept raising their opinions, but they were all rejected.

“Since we can’t do it externally, then let’s do it internally. The blood Alliance is different from us. They are a force formed by many bloodline families, so it will be easier to break them up from the inside.” A first circle sorcerer said.

“Hmm, not a bad idea.” Marcus nodded and said, ” so we can send people to contact some people from the Blood Alliance and lure them into turning against the alliance with benefits.”

“Sir is wise and powerful.” Someone immediately agreed.

“Yes, yes, yes!”

“Indeed, indeed.”

Everyone nodded in agreement. Someone looked at Kratos and asked, ” Sir, I wonder how much more virus Mr. Herman can release. After all, this is quite useful.”

“Uh, sure, I’ll ask.” Kratos didn’t expect the topic to suddenly change to Eli, so he nodded.

He took out his token and asked a question.

…

“How much more of the virus can I release at once?”

At this moment, in the room, Eli looked at Kratos’s information and blinked. He thought about how many viruses he had released over the years. He had detonated about half of his virus carriers. He had about 3000 carriers left.

“About 3600,” After some thought, Eli sent the message over.

…

“Kratos, how many more do you have?” Marcus also asked curiously.

Kratos nodded numbly as if everyone else cared more about Herman than he did. However, when he sensed the message, his eyes widened.

3600?

Wait a minute?

Kratos rubbed his temples and sensed again. It was really 3600.

Did he send it to the wrong person? How many did you set up?

“Kratos, how many are there?” Marcus asked with a frown.

“Uh, 3600?”

“Oh, only 3600. What, 3600?” Marcus nodded, but in the next second, he seemed to have realized something and let out a cry of surprise, his mouth wide open.

3600?

In addition to the virus from before, Herman had set up close to 10,000 virus carriers. Marcus suddenly felt that he had underestimated Herman. What a talent!

Even Marcus was so shocked, not to mention the others, their mouths were also wide open. They were all glad that this fatal poison master was on their side.

“Uh, okay. One month from now. Let Herman release all of them at once. We’ll organize an attack then. We’ll think about the details later.” Said Marcus as he nodded.

“Alright,” he said. Kratos nodded and sent the message to Eli.

…

In the blink of an eye, a month had passed.

Dark forest.

This was one of the largest bases of the blood Alliance, so the defense here was very tight. There would be Wizards patrolling every day, and so would Colin.

On this day, he wore leather armor and patrolled the forest.

“Sigh, I wonder when the war will end.” Colin shook his head and walked onto the main road.

Suddenly, when he passed by an area, he felt that something was wrong. At this time, a green mist was spreading out from the broken tree hole, accompanied by a pungent smell.

“It’s a virus,” Colin’s eyes widened. Having fought against the shadow lizard Warlock Academy and the White Tower for many years, he recognized this virus at a glance.

“I have to go back and report immediately.” Colin quickly left the place. They were already very familiar with the handling of the virus. Since they could not solve it, they would isolate the carriers.

“I wonder which guy developed this disgusting thing.” Colin’s speed was very fast.

However, as soon as he walked out of this area, he saw that the virus had appeared in another place. This surprised him because the virus was usually released singularly.

“It should be a coincidence.” He shook his head and recorded this as well.

After recording it, he continued on his way. However, when he saw the third virus, he gradually realized the severity of the problem.

This shouldn’t be a coincidence.

“Damn it, there’s a big problem.”

His expression also became nervous as he looked up at the sky. At this moment, a bird passed by, but to his surprise, the bird was also covered in dark green fungus.

“Damn it!” Collin took a deep breath. He had no doubt that there was a problem.

The virus this time seemed to be far larger in scale and scope than before.

…

Three months later.

Kratos came to the outside of the dark forest. At this time, all the combat members of the White Tower had arrived. There were hundreds of them, and the Warlocks stood in the front.

Kratos was one of the leaders, but when he looked at the forest in front of him, he couldn’t help but tremble.

“Is this the dark forest?” The corners of Kratos’ mouth twitched.

The forest in front of him was completely different from before. If Kratos remembered correctly, it should be a huge forest, but it was now completely covered by a large area of dark green fungi.

Although a large number of trees were still standing, their insides had long been corroded and riddled with holes, while the outside was in a strange state. Moreover, the forest did not make any sound, as if it was a dead forest.

There was no chirping of birds or the sound of small animals.

“How terrifying!” As a Warlock, Kratos had never seen this before, and he gasped.

Other than Kratos, the other Warlock apprentices gasped in shock.

“Is this the virus?”

“That’s too scary. Fortunately, we have the antidote.”

“Damn it, I can already imagine the fear of the blood Alliance. Fortunately, Sir Herman is on our side.”

“I’m a die-hard fan of Lord Herman from now on.”

All the warlocks of the White Tower were shocked by this scene.

“Kratos, let’s attack. This is one of their biggest bases. If we occupy this place, the strength of the blood Alliance will be weakened by at least 20%.” The two-circle sorcerer, Theron, said.

Kratos nodded.

“Launch the attack!” Kratos turned his head and ordered the people behind him.

In an instant, all the warlocks began to attack the dark forest.

The war began.

However, after the White Tower warlocks entered the forest and started a war with the Blood Alliance, everyone found that the resistance of the Alliance was weakened by more than 30%, which made everyone very confused.

However, after the battle was won, everyone opened the gate of the base and saw a large number of infected apprentices and first-circle warlocks. They seemed to understand what had happened.

“It’s a good thing we have Sir Herman.”

All the apprentices expressed their gratitude.

Without this virus, the war would have been much more difficult, and many of them would have died. This was all the work of Herman, a Warlock who had not shown his face since the beginning.

Another month passed.

When the White Tower forces attacked another camp, they saw a similar scene to the one in the dark forest.

All the apprentices said the same thing again.

“Thank you, sir Herman.”

As time passed, the virus’s impact on the Blood Alliance was much greater than expected. Coupled with various means, the internal structure of the Blood Alliance began to collapse.

Some Warlock families requested to give up the battle, some requested to continue the battle, and some had already begun to pack their things and prepare to escape.

In this atmosphere, a year later, with another collapse of the alliance’s camp, they finally chose to give up and acknowledged the existence of the White Tower.

The war was finally over.

As Kratos had said, White Tower had really grown up on the corpse of the shadow lizard sorcerer Academy and had become more powerful.

…

Bloodline compatibility 81%.

On the other side, Eli sighed as he sensed the improvement in his bloodline.

It had only been a few years, yet he had managed to raise his bloodline to its current level. It had to be said that this was a very outrageous thing. Of course, it was not just his bloodline. Perhaps it was because of the strengthened bloodline that he had also improved in another aspect. His elemental essence conversion had also reached 59%, and his mental power was at 63 points.

It could only be said that the endless devour spell was indeed not bad.

“But the war is over. I should go back.”

The day before, Eli had received the news that the White Tower had won and wanted him to go back to receive the credit.

It was indeed time to go back. He couldn’t break through as a mage in a short time, and he didn’t know how a Warlock could break through to the second circle. The White Tower should be able to help him.

And this time, when he returned, there would be earth-shaking changes.

“Tijie, gather all the higher-ups in the camp.” Eli walked out of the house and found Tijie.

“Yes!”

Before he left, he had to deal with the camp.
