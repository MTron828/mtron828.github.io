492 Igniting the Green Field

Eastern Green Field.

At this moment, the team was moving forward. The team was like a long dragon, winding forward for dozens of kilometers. Everyone was wearing the same black Warlock robe.

At the front of the line.

A handsome man smiled as he looked at the green field in front of him.

His name was Sai Press, one of the six great families of the Warlock Union. He was also a direct subordinate of the white-haired old man that day. He had been sent to the rear this time.

“After passing through this place, we will reach the back of the Bloodline Tower. I heard that this force is extremely rich and has many good techniques from the Mage Era.” Sai pursed his lips, and a greedy look flashed in his eyes.

At this moment, a Warlock flew to his side and asked, “Milord, there’s a foreign tribe in front of us. Do you need us to change direction?”

Hearing this, Sai smiled and said, “No, we don’t want to. We’re at the edge of the green fields. How dare these foreign races stop us? There’s no need to worry.”

He waved his hand and shouted,

“Let’s continue forward.”

..

And tens of kilometers away from them.

On a plain.

At this moment, hundreds of thousands of foreign races were gathered here, and the leaders led by Eli were at the front.

“Milord, all the foreign tribes have arrived.” Erwin, who was wearing green leather armor, greeted Eli respectfully.

“Very good!” Eli nodded.

Then, he took a deep breath and shouted, “Let’s go!”

At the same time, in another part of the green field, Giovanni’s dragon roar resounded through the world. Thousands of dragons flapped their wings and rose into the sky, emitting a powerful aura.

The two teams moved like thunder, advancing toward the Warlock Army from the east and west.

Their actions did not attract the attention of the arrogant Warlock Alliance Army. In fact, they did not think that the other races in the Green Field would dare to attack them!

Compared to them, it was the various races in the Green Field who received the news first.

Dwarves!

“What?!” The Dwarf King’s wine cup that never fell fell fell fell to the ground.

“Your Majesty, the current situation is like this. Roland, the representative of the Mage Alliance, has also contacted the foreign races and set off toward the allied army of about 50,000 people who have recently entered the Green Field. At the same time, the dragons have also launched an attack.” A dwarf knelt on one knee and quickly reported.

Hiss!

Upon hearing this, the Dwarf King could not help but gasp again.

After years of development, the alliance led by Roland occupied almost two-fifths of the power of the Green Field. Together with the dragons, it occupied almost three-fifths of the power of the Green Field.

“They must be crazy.” The Dwarf King’s mouth twitched as he cursed.

It had been thousands of years. Although the foreign races at the Green Field would attack humans who entered, this was the first time they had done so on such a large scale.

The dwarven king didn’t want the Warlock Alliance to assume the dwarves were with the other foreign races. He didn’t want the humans to bear a grudge against him.

“Damn it!” Thinking of this, he cursed again.

“Your Majesty, what should we do?” At this moment, a dwarf stood out and asked.

“What should we do? What should we do? They’ve gone crazy. What else can we do?” The Dwarf King picked up another wine cup and drank it in big gulps. Then, he said with a trace of madness, “Since they will hate us anyway, let’s join in and have some fun with them.”

What?

Hearing this, all the dwarves widened their eyes.

“Listen to my orders. Gather the Black Lava Dukedom Army and set off quickly. Don’t fall too far behind.” When the Dwarf King stood up, his five-meter height made the Dwarves tremble.

One had to know that dwarves were never a kind race.

A long time ago, they were one of the most bloodthirsty races.

“We will obey Your Majesty’s orders!”

All the dwarves laughed.

The dwarven army quickly gathered and left the territory. This change was also noticed by the other races, and they were greatly stimulated.

“F * ck, they’re all crazy, they’re all crazy. We can’t fall behind. Gather the army!” This was the reaction of a core area leader after seeing the message.

“F * ck, let’s party together.” The other races in the core area also revealed sinister smiles.

Since the big shots in the core region had decided to participate in the war, how would the other races in Green Field react? They naturally took action as well.

Since their boss had already moved, how could they not express their loyalty?

Thus, in less than half an hour,

Millions of non-humankind beings began to move, and the entire green field became restless.

It was likely that even Eli did not expect this. He was more like a fuse that ignited the green fields.

A single spark could start a prairie fire!

..

At this moment, the Warlock Union was still advancing.

Sai looked at a huge stone palace not far away. A group of porcupine-like foreign races were hiding in it. Seeing this, he smiled.

“Non-human races are weak. They don’t dare to resist us at all.” Sai sneered, then looked ahead and said loudly, “Pack up the resources here and continue to set off.”

“Yes, sir!”

The Warlocks echoed loudly with smiles on their faces.

But at this moment, a Warlock suddenly ran over from afar. He looked flustered and shouted, “Sir, this is bad. Hundreds of thousands of non-humankind soldiers have appeared in the south.”

The Warlock’s voice attracted Sai’s attention. Hearing the content, his eyes widened.

“What?!”

He was about to ask, but sentries came from other directions.

“Something bad has happened. Thousands of dragons are flying over from the north.”

“And to the east, I saw a five-meter-tall dwarf. They were all riding giant wolves and heading this way. I estimate that there are at least ten thousand dwarves and a large number of other races!”

“The west is the same. I saw dozens of different races!”

The anxious shouts caused Sai’s face to turn pale.

“Impossible!” He widened his eyes and the joy he had just felt disappeared.

There was no doubt that these foreign races were coming for them.

But weren’t they just passing by? Was it necessary?

From the words of the few sentries, there were at least a few million foreign races. Had they gone mad? 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“There’s still a chance. Everyone, don’t panic.” Sai’s body trembled slightly, but he still comforted his people.

But in the next second.

The ground began to tremble, and dust flew into the air. He looked toward the source of the sound.

A black torrent appeared on the distant horizon. The dust on the ground rose like a sandstorm. At the front, it seemed to be led by a human.

At the same time, on the other side of the sky, a shadow suddenly descended.

Thousands of giant dragons flew toward them, roaring.

Countless foreign races roared ferociously. What shocked Sai was that he saw at least four to five half-step fifth-circle foreign creatures and that human made his heart palpitate!

Looking at the millions of non-humankind beings, Sai’s face turned completely pale.

At this moment, the expressions of the various foreign races were also very interesting.

Dragon King Giovanni looked at the human who represented the elves in front of him, his friend from thousands of years ago, the Dwarf King, and the kings of other races. He was slightly stunned.

“Hiss, what happened?” Giovanni was stunned.

Could it be that these foreign races were also related to Sir Eli?

Was that the representative of the so-called warlock alliance? Could it be that he was also in contact with Sir Eli? At the thought of this, Giovanni’s eyes became more and more shocked.

His respect for Eli grew deeper and deeper!

At this moment, the foreign tribes on Eli’s side were about the same.

They looked at the alien races in the other directions with their mouths wide open.

“Is this Lord Roland’s strength?” The Featherman King looked at Eli in shock.

“No wonder the lord hasn’t been expanding recently. It turns out that he has connections with most of the foreign tribes!” Erwin’s beautiful eyes looked at Eli, feeling excited.

As expected of someone who came back from the Mage Alliance. His methods were truly terrifying!

At this moment, Eli was also in a daze. This had nothing to do with him!

However, he soon understood the reason and smiled.

In the next second, he rose into the sky and shouted at the alien race he was in, “Attack and annihilate the army of human warlocks.”

Roar!

Countless non-humankind beings raised their arms and roared.

Further away, the Dragon King’s dragon roar also resounded through the world as if he could not fall behind.

“Dwarf Race, charge!” Farther away, the Dwarf King held two sledgehammers in his hands and roared into the sky.

Not many people knew what it was like to have a million foreign races roar at the same time, but Sai did. It was a sound that made people feel no resistance, a sound that made people despair.

“We’re done for!”

Sai could not help but put his hand on his shoulders, almost fainting.

Looking at the foreign army in the distance, he couldn’t even see a trace of hope.

There was no hope of victory.
