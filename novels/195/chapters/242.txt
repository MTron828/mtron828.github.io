243 Vivika’s Vigilance

“It seems that the investment this time should be almost done!”

On the roof, looking at Jin Ji’s back as he left, a smile appeared on Eli’s face.

Towards those who were favored by fate, Eli did not intend to engrave a soul imprint directly. That would be too low-end. Furthermore, as someone who was favored by fate, who knew what kind of opportunity he would encounter to unseal it? he might even stab Eli in the back.

That was why Eli only chose to do him a favor.

!!

In any case, it was just a high-grade magic stone and a die of fate.

With that in mind, Eli took out a die of fate and threw it.

“Dice success rate!”

The die drew a trajectory and then fell back into his hand. It was a five.

“Not bad.” Eli smiled, turned around, and left.

He had plenty of fate dice. Other than the one he used at the beginning, he still had quite a few. Anyway, it was just a matter of consuming a little more life, so he had a lot of them.

Speaking of which, even if Eli didn’t save jin ji, there was a high chance that he wouldn’t die. This was because a patrol team happened to pass by, but Eli considerately used an illusion to change fate.

“Let me see what it means to be a person blessed by fate!”

Jin Ji was the first person he had met who was blessed by fate.

He also wanted to know how far he could go.

..

Three days passed in the blink of an eye.

In the past three days, the silver Moon meeting went on as usual. It was said that they had already begun discussing how to send people to explore the ruins. Vivika, as the tower master of the bloodline tower, attended every day.

Eli had also passed by the Golden cicada Chamber of Commerce and knew that Jin Ji had bought a new potion. Without the effects of any supplementary potions, he had directly advanced by one level.

It was said that the commotion at the time was so great that it shocked the store manager. It was only then that he realized that Jin Ji was a genius, a genius that only appeared once in a few hundred years.

He directly reported Jin Ji’s news, and his status was also greatly improved.

Even though he only had one circle, his status wasn’t any lower than that of a two-circle warlock.

“How terrifying!”

Eli pursed his lips and sighed.

As expected of a man of destiny! As expected, he was not ordinary!

However, Jin Ji wasn’t there when he went there. He was called by the chairman of the Golden cicada Chamber of Commerce’s West Coast branch to meet with him, so he didn’t see him.

However, it did not matter. After all, jin ji was only a first-circle Warlock now, and he could not bring anything to Eli. What Eli cared about was not present, but the future.

In the future, hundreds or even thousands of years later, it would be time to reap the harvest.

But even if he failed, it was nothing!

He didn’t believe that there was only one Jin ji. There were definitely many more in the Magus world, and he didn’t need to take it seriously. After all, even a person of destiny had to die!

So what if fate favored him? in the face of time, he was just a speck of dust!

For the next hundred to a thousand years, they would shine brilliantly. But ten thousand years, a hundred thousand years later, where would they be? yet, he would still be there. This was no better than being blessed by fate.

On the contrary, he only hoped that fate would take less care of him. After all, the protagonists in the stories were all plagued with disasters, but he just wanted to live a stable life until the world fell.

..

Three days later.

Night fell. After strolling around for a day, Eli returned to his room, and a series of knocks sounded on the door!

“Who is it?”

Eli took a look, then walked over and opened the door.

“Vivika?”

“Teacher!”

“Come in!” Although he was puzzled as to why she would come at this time, it should be something very important.

Vivika came in, and Eli closed the door.

“what’s the matter? is there something wrong? ”

Vivika was sitting opposite him on the sofa.

“teacher, although the silver Moon clan isn’t over yet, the meeting has ended today. Next, I might have to follow the various forces to the ruins and dig for possible mechanical clues!” Vivika said with a frown.

“That’s a good thing. What’s wrong?” Eli said, puzzled.

“Teacher, let’s put it this way. I feel that there’s something strange about the ruins this time!” Vivika looked around and said solemnly.

“Is there something strange?” Eli narrowed his eyes.

“Yes, I suspect there’s a problem!” Vivika bit her lips, her face solemn. “This time, whether it’s the discovery of the ruins or the meeting, it’s far more successful than before. This gives me a bad feeling.

“I think I saw the heart of the dark night and helwall sneaking around together today, but these two forces should not have any contact with each other. Moreover, the ruins were discovered by these two forces before they contacted the rest of us. Now that I think about it, it’s very strange!”

“If you think there’s a problem, then you don’t have to go!” Eli had a strange expression.

This was what he usually did when he encountered a suspicious problem.

“teacher, the ruins have been sent to the bloodline tower headquarters. I’ve been asked to go. I have no choice.” Vivika sighed, then looked at Eli.

She was really envious of her teacher!

He followed his heart, free and easy, and was never restricted by others. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

...

Eli understood as well.

He was an immortal. At most, he could just wait for everything to end before starting again. But in fact, most people didn’t have that much time and opportunity. For them, most of the time, they couldn’t help it.

“Then what are you here for today?” Eli looked at Vivika.

“Uh, teacher, if something happens to me, can you help me manage the bloodline tower?” Vivika said as she took out a blood-red token from her waist. “this is the bloodline tower’s West Coast branch’s tower master token. With this and teacher being the honorary vice tower master, once I die, no one will disobey teacher.”

Vivika gritted her teeth and handed the token to Eli.

She really didn’t want her teacher to be involved in this matter, but she had no other choice. If something really happened to her, the bloodline tower would be in chaos, and it might even disappear. Only her teacher could control everything.

She had never thought about letting her teacher participate in the exploration of the secret ruin. After all, her teacher was only an early stage third circle warlock. Although he had killed Kloss, she could see that his combat power was only at the middle stage.

However, the heart of the darkness had higher strength. Even the third-circle warlocks they sent out to explore this time were at the late-stage of the third-circle, and even their teacher wasn’t a match for them.

Of course, the most important thing was that his teacher wouldn’t explore such an unknown secret realm.

“A token!”

Eli looked at the token in front of him and squinted his eyes, but he pushed it back and did not accept it.

...

“There’s no need for that. This token belongs to you!” Eli shook her head and looked into Vivika’s eyes.”And if you really die, then it’s meaningless to have this!”

“Teacher!” Vivika bit her lips, and there seemed to be tears in her eyes.

If she didn’t really feel that something was wrong, she wouldn’t have come here.

“This is for you!” Vivika was about to say something, but then she saw Eli take out a cane.

The cane was made of brown pear wood. It was very dark in color and was only a dozen centimeters long. The tip of the cane was a black crystal that emitted a black light.

“This staff has a one-time use shield. It can withstand attacks below the third circle for about three hours!” Eli placed it on the table and pushed it toward Vivika.

“Uh …” Vivika picked up her cane and was about to say something when she saw Eli stand up and say, “It’s very late today. Go back and rest.”

“Alright,” she said.

Vivika looked into Eli’s eyes. Knowing that she couldn’t persuade her teacher, she picked up his cane and left, but she left the token on the table.

“Vivika!”

Vivika had only taken a few steps when she turned around and saw the token flying toward her. At the same time, she was sent out of the door by force, and the door closed with a bang.

“try your best to live. If you die, I will watch the bloodline tower be destroyed!

“Of course, I’d still rather you don’t go. If you do, be careful!”

Vivika was stunned for a moment when she sensed the message. However, she smiled when she felt the concern in the last tone. She then turned around and left.
