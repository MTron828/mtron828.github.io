Chapter 13: Moving House

Translator: Lonelytree

The next day, Eli pushed the door open and walked out of the room.

At this time, there were already many pedestrians on the street, most of them wearing linen clothes and pants. The air was fresh, but there was still a fishy smell. Occasionally, they could even see feces on the road.

He had to admit that the environment in this world was not as good as it seemed.

Fortunately, the situation in the Urban area would be much better, and this was the problem that Eli was going to solve today.

Scholar Clement gave him a three-day holiday to take care of his own matters, while Eli had already made an appointment with someone and was ready to find a new place to stay.

...

“Sir, what do you think of this place?”

In front of a remote house, a man asked Eli respectfully.

“Not bad!” Eli looked at the house in front of him and nodded in satisfaction.

This was a house in the northern part of Jun Lin city. It was relatively remote and was about three thousand meters away from the library.

The exterior adopted the more common architectural style of the Empire, and the yard was made of ordinary blue stone bricks, full of the taste of history, and a large number of green plants climbed on top.

“You’re a student of scholar Clement. Don’t worry. I’ll definitely give you a good home.” The man replied with a smile.

If it weren’t for scholar Clement, he wouldn’t have such an attitude towards a young man.

Yesterday, when Eli and scholar Clement had talked about where they would live, scholar Clement had said that he could help. Then, he asked Eli to look for the man in front of him. He had arranged everything.

Although he had only just become his student, Eli could already feel the changes. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“You can go in and take a look with me.” The man said with a smile.

Eli nodded and followed the man.

As he followed the man into the house, Eli realized that even though it looked a little shabby from the outside, it was very clean inside. There was no strange smell, and the area was not small either.

The house was independent, with only one floor and a small courtyard.

There were four rooms inside, a large living room, a bathroom, and even a spacious basement. The interior decoration was good, and some basic furniture was available. He could even bring his things to live in directly.

After looking around, Eli was quite satisfied with the environment, but he didn’t know if the price was acceptable or not.

As if he could see through Eli’s concerns, the man smiled and said, “Don’t worry, scholar Clement has made arrangements. The owner of this house belongs to the Vitaly family, and scholar Clement is the Vitaly family’s advisor. Therefore, you can rent him for two silver coins a month.”

It was worth mentioning that after becoming a formal employee, his salary had also been raised to five silver tarls, which could be considered an epic upgrade. This allowed him to have enough money to choose a house.

In fact, he had wanted to look at a bigger villa, but after knowing the price, he was immediately advised to leave. That was not a villa that he could afford to live in at the moment.

Moreover, if he were to live in a villa, he would have to hire a maid, a coachman, and the like. That would be another expense, and his salary of five silver tarls would not be able to support it at all.

“Two silver tarls?” Eli had some doubts. It was cheaper than he had imagined.

“That’s right, the rent here was originally five silver tars a month, but you only have to pay two. This is also because this place is very remote. If it were near the city center, the price would probably be several times higher for such a large area.” The man replied with a smile, trying his best to sell it.

“Then I’ll take it!” Eli nodded.

The environment here was quiet, and there were no busy streets around. It was far from the city center, and there was a basement where some witchcraft research could be done.

As for testing the spells, the basement was enough for the weaker ones. As for the more powerful spells, why did he have to test them at home? Wouldn’t it be better to test them outside the city, in the sewers, or somewhere else?

Besides, the powerful sorcery might attract some people’s attention. After all, although the Empire did not seem to know about the existence of Wizards, Eli believed that if he were to be exposed, there would be a huge trouble, and that was not something he wanted to face.

“Did you bring the contract?” Eli asked.

“I did.” The man said enthusiastically, then took out the contract.

After making sure that there was no problem with the contract, Eli took the quill that the man carried with him and wrote down his name, then handed him twelve silver tars for a total of half a year’s rent. The rent here was paid in intervals of half a year.

“Alright, are you sure you want to live alone?” The man recalled the previous conversation and asked.

In their previous conversation, Eli mentioned that he lived alone.

“Yes.” Eli nodded.

“If you need to clean the house or need other services, you can come to me. Don’t worry, we are professionals.” The man said with a smile and began to promote their additional business.

“No need,” Eli said, his mind thinking of a few spells that could clean up.

“Alright, then.” The man was a little disappointed, but he immediately regained his enthusiasm.

The two of them chatted for a while, then the man handed the key to Eli and left.

That night, Eli brought his only assets, a few pieces of linen clothes and a few notes, over. After tidying up the place, he lit a candle in the empty study and began reading.

During this time, Eli had also read part of the book and accumulated many questions. He wanted to find someone to talk to, but unfortunately, he had not seen any Wizards in this damn place.

He could only rely on himself to think about the accumulated problems, repeatedly considering them. Thankfully, the notes were detailed enough, predicting all kinds of problems he might face during his apprenticeship. It was as if the author had already considered this situation.

After thinking for a while, Eli skimmed through the notebook and directly flipped to the last part, where the spells were recorded.

A large number of zero circle spells, wizard’s hand, poison spray, power of the will, light, switch, stun, touch of fatigue, quick immunity, animal comfort, thorn shield, Shadow stealth...

There were a lot of them, and they were all zero-circle spells suitable for apprentices.

Of course, the notebook seemed to be just as Saleen Metatrin had said. It was an apprentice’s notebook, and what Eli wanted to do at the moment was to choose the most suitable spells to learn from these.

There were six major types of spells, namely The Conjuring system, the divination system, the beguiling system, the evocation system, the necromancy system, and the transformation system.

Normally, apprentices would choose one or two types to study. Since they had limited time and energy, it was better to focus on specific types.

Learning too much would only take up too much energy. Not only would it take time to meditate, but it might also not give him enough time to study. Mages did not agree with the idea of learning too much because it would spread their time too thin.

On the contrary, Eli felt that he could master it all. After all, he had all the time in the world.
