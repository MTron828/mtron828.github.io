377 Investment and Prayer

The auras of the twelve celestials were extremely obvious, especially when they were not concealed at all.

Therefore, when the twelve aura pillars streaked across the sky, the commotion they caused was not small at all.

Blue City was a city located in the middle of the Western Regions.

In a tall wizard tower.

Liliana stood in front of Lobelia.

” Anna, you’ve had contact with Eli before, and it’s not bad. So I’ve decided that you’ll be in charge of the branch of Bloodline Tower. You’ll be in charge of the contact between the Charm Mansion and Eli. ” said Lobelia.

“Yes.” Liliana nodded. After the last incident, she was temporarily transferred out of Holmes City.

” Anna, your judgment was right. Eli might be stronger than we thought. Even I, your teacher, can feel my heartbeat race when I’m near him. So if you can really rope him into our camp, there won’t be a problem with the resources you need to advance to the fourth circle. ” Lobelia squinted her eyes and said to Liliana.

“Ah?” Liliana covered her red lips. She didn’t expect her teacher to give such a high evaluation of Eli.

After all, her teacher was already a Radiant Moon Warlock.

This was too shocking.

” Alright, Teacher. I understand. ” After a brief moment of surprise, she nodded.

” Yes, this is a good thing for you. For the Charm Mansion, it’s not shameful to rely on the strong. On the contrary, this is our advantage. Anna, I personally trained you, so there are some things you should understand. ” Lobelia said earnestly.

“Teacher, I understand.” Liliana nodded.

She naturally understood what her teacher meant.

“Alright …” Lobelia smiled and was about to say something, but she turned her head to the window, and her face instantly became serious.

She could feel the aura of many celestials.

The direction was… Bloodline Tower?

“Looks like something big is about to happen.” Lobelia suddenly stood up.

At this moment, a warlock knocked on the door and came in. He came to her side and said something.

“Teacher, what happened?” Liliana asked after the Warlock left.

Lobelia looked at Liliana and sighed. “You probably don’t need to go. I didn’t expect Jerre to be so desperate.”

Soon, Lobelia told Liliana what had happened.

Liliana’s eyes widened.

” Teacher, I think we should go and provide support immediately. ” Liliana suggested.

“It’s too late!” Lobelia shook her head.

“Better late than never,” Liliana said firmly.

Lobelia turned around and looked at her student in surprise. She paused for a few seconds before she smiled and said, “It seems like you’ve already chosen your investment target. I’ll help you this time. ”

Soon, the two arcs of light left Blue City!

…..

At the Amina Family.

In the temple.

“Patriarch, should we help Jerre?” Kenan asked Selona, who was in the temple.

“Nonsense!” Selona glanced at Kenan and said. After a few days of rest, his external injuries had basically healed.

” Sir, why? Isn’t this a good opportunity to get rid of the Bloodline Tower? ” Kenan asked in confusion.

” Hehe, I don’t think they can kill Eli. ” Selona stood up.

That day, the three of them were pressed down and beaten up. They did not have the ability to fight back at all, which left a deep impression on him.

” Pass on my order. Other than the two celestials guarding the Green Field, gather the rest of the celestials. We’ll go and provide support to the Bloodline Tower! ” Selona waved his hand and decided.

“Yes!” Kenan nodded, but he looked at Selona with a strange expression.

What did his Leader experience that day?

What a huge change!

…

Golden Cicada Merchant Association!

Conilla put down the letter in his hand and walked out of the door.

“Sir, where are you going?” At this moment, the door opened, revealing a Warlock holding a large number of documents.

“Go support them!”

After saying that, Conilla left, leaving the Warlock with a baffled expression.

Who should they support?

….

On the other side.

Eleven streams of celestial transformed into Bloodline aura pillars that streaked across the sky. Even the elements within a radius of several kilometers changed because of it.

In the sky, the sea of clouds churned, and the aura emitted by the celestials caused the air to tremble. No birds could approach within a hundred miles. The magical beasts on the ground in the wild felt this aura, and some of them ran away frantically while others quickly entered their homes and trembled.

Because the Manticore Family was close to the Bloodline Tower, almost all the forces passing by were from the two families.

Therefore, many of the celestials flying above were the bosses of the forces on the ground.

...

“Isn’t that the head of the family? What exactly happened!”

” Every aura is stronger than the patriarch’s and even similar. What exactly is going on?! ”

The Warlocks in these factions widened their eyes at this terrifying scene!

In their memories, this was the first time they had seen so many celestials.

The few Warlocks who knew the inside story felt sorry for the Bloodline Tower.

” Why did you provoke the Manticore Clan? You overestimate yourself. ”

“Let’s get ready to welcome the return of the lords.”

The Warlocks smiled. They could not think of any other ending to this story.

As for the common people, they lowered their heads and continued with their own matters.

To them, the high and mighty celestials were beyond them. It was better to think about how to fill their stomachs.

…..

...

Bloodline Tower.

In the Wizard Tower.

“Sir, Jerre and the others have arrived at the border of the Bloodline Tower. “Glen reported to Eli with a worried expression.

“Yes, they are quite fast.” Eli nodded and said to him, “Go and summon Nikola and Hydra. ”

“Yes, my lord.” Glen nodded and asked, “Sir, do you really don’t need my help? Although my blood essence is declining, I can still delay a celestial.”

“No need.” Eli stood up and patted Glen on the shoulder. “You only have a few years left to live. I don’t want to have to hold your funeral when we win.

“You should help me choose a suitable place for the battlefield.”

“Yes, sir.” Glen sighed and nodded.

He took out a map and pointed to an area of the Bloodline Tower.

“This is the Savon Mountain Range. There are no human residences within a thousand miles. It’s the most suitable place for a battle.” Glen said to Eli, but he still asked worriedly, “Sir, I think I can still fight.”

” No need. If you die on the battlefield, Alida will be sad. ” Eli smiled and refused again.

“Alright then.”

Glen sighed deeply again. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Half an hour later!

As the three arcs of light left Bloodline City, many Warlocks raised their heads.

By now, Jerre’s incident had spread throughout the entire city, so many Warlocks were praying for Eli.

Everyone knew very well what they would face if Eli died.

Perhaps the hope that he had just brought would be gone again.

“Sir, you must win!”

In the highest Warlock Tower, Alida stood beside Glen and prayed with her hands clasped together.

“Don’t worry. Milord will be fine!”

Glen gently stroked Alida’s head.

“Definitely!” Alida nodded affirmatively.

Glen looked at the light in his granddaughter’s eyes and couldn’t help but shake his head.

Alida had grown up too!

….

On the other side.

Eli brought Hydra and Nikola to an uninhabited mountain range. It was the Savon Mountain Range.

As soon as he arrived, Eli instantly erupted with a massive aura that spread out in all directions.

“Sir, what are you doing?” Nikola asked curiously.

“There will be a battle between more than ten celestials here. Let’s disperse the creatures here first.” Eli smiled.

Nikola looked at Eli and smiled. His Excellency was actually very kind!

Following the explosion, the surrounding creatures quickly left. Living creatures had an instinctive sense of danger.

Soon, almost all the creatures within a radius of dozens of miles were cleared, and those on the periphery were still running further away.

Seeing that it was about time, Eli retracted his aura and opened his spatial ring.

In the next second, countless items were thrown out from within. Within a few hundred meters, there were spell formations. They were a small part of Eli’s collection. In the past thousand years, Eli had created many of these things, but he had never had the chance to use them before.

“Nikola, help me set up!” Eli said to Nikola.

“Yes!” Nikola nodded and quickly set up the spell formations. Sensing the attributes of these spell formations, he could not help but mourn for these Warlocks.

Allowing a Mage to set up a battlefield in advance was definitely the most foolish choice.

Soon, the battlefield was set up.

After setting up, Eli took a deep breath, closed his eyes, and went for the final rest!

Nikola and Hydra stood beside Eli and waited quietly.

Four hours later.

Eli suddenly opened his eyes.

At the edge of his field of vision, eleven streams of celestial aura flew toward him without any concealment.

“They are here.”
