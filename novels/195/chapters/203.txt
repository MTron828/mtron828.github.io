204 Edge of the Endless Sea

“You have a clue?”

In the tower, Eli looked at Catarina and asked.

“Yes, my lord.” Catarina looked at Eli. Although they were both second-circle, she could feel the huge difference between her and Eli.

The iris had encountered some vile forces over the years, but they were easily suppressed by Eli. This was also the reason why they had developed so quickly over the years.

“Since you’ve found out, then send someone to look for it.” Eli was very excited.

After a full sixty years, he finally found a clue.

“I’m sorry, but we might not be able to do anything this time.” Catarina bit her lip and apologized, ” this time, it was found on the coast of the endless sea, but it seems to be occupied by a murloc tribe, and the water elemental fruit seems to be in their magical herb garden. We have sent many people there, but none manage to get in.

“And they have two circle combat force. We’re no match for them in the water!”

After listening to this, Eli fell into deep thought. All the resources previously had been collected, but it seemed that he had hit a roadblock this time.

“Since that’s the case …” Eli pursed his lips and took out the Dice of Fate.

How safe would it be?!

Five.

Eli fell into deep thought. The water elemental fruit was different from others. It was a very precious magical plant that usually grew in the sea. It was already very lucky to find one along the coast. If he gave up now, it might take hundreds or even thousands of years for the next one to appear.

Although he could wait, it was not necessary. Besides, 5 was good enough, so he could go out and try.

“Give me all the information you have. I’ll think about it,” said Eli as he looked up at Catarina.

“Yes!”

Very quickly, a document was brought over.

Eli began to flip through the documents, and ten minutes later, he placed them on the table.

The water elemental fruit was located on the coast of the endless sea. It was not far from here, but it was a little remote. There were about a few thousand murlocs in the tribe.

The only problem was that murlocs could unleash their full combat power in the water, but mages were not able to do that. Even warlocks rarely integrated with the blood of sea creatures. At least Eli had never seen any warlocks with sea creatures above the second circle. There were also undead, but unfortunately, undead were affected by the sea, and their speed would be greatly affected.

This time, it was possible that Eli really had to go out.

Fortunately, there were no third-circle creatures in the murloc tribe. At this moment, there was still a sixty-year-old soul Blade in Eli’s consciousness. He had also been learning the burning blood secret technique for a long time.

Eli had already learned it decades ago. This was a technique that relied on burning blood to obtain explosive speed.

About thirty years ago, Eli, who had made great progress in all aspects, had modified this secret technique again, abandoning the need to burn blood. Instead, he would directly exhaust his life force.

That allowed him to reach the peak of his speed, which was comparable to that of a mage with third-circle or perhaps even faster. That was one of the main reasons why he wanted to go out.

Of course, this was only one of the reasons. There was another important reason. To a certain extent, the shadow Dragon was actually very compatible with water. It could be considered a creature that could live in water, land, and air. His strength would not be affected much. With his concealment ability, it should be enough to allow Eli to enter stealthily.

Even if Eli faced a third-circle creature, Eli still had a high chance of escaping.

Eli thought for a moment. It would be impolite not to go at this point.

He was not a coward.

Also, after black Isotta dealt with the bloodline tower, he would definitely make a move on them. At that time, it would be even more difficult to escape, so Eli might as well take a gamble. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Also, he was only going to sneak in and not invade from the front, so there was really no need to be so worried.

Thus, three days later, the group left the irises camp, including Eli.

..

The reef Coast.

This was the southernmost area of the endless sea near the West Coast. Because there were storms and waves all year round, the environment was harsh, and there were few resources, so there were no warlocks here.

However, the ocean here was rich with many creatures, including those from the first and second circles. There were even several tribes of creatures, one of which was the murloc tribe.

Three days later, Eli and the others arrived.

“Are you sure this is the place, Morenson?”

Eli looked ahead. Behind the shore, formed by piles of rocks, was a boundless ocean. The waves were rolling and boundless, looking very spectacular.

“Sir, it’s here. The specific location is about a thousand meters below the sea.” Morenson was a first-circle mage, and he was the one sent to guide Eli. There were two other first-circle mages who were in charge of keeping watch and other tasks.

“Alright then!” Eli nodded and took a deep breath. The fishy smell of the ocean hit him in the face.

Compared to the land, the wind elements contained in the sea breeze were even more astonishing. This was normal. Otherwise, this wouldn’t be the endless sea.

Speaking of the endless sea, it was one of the largest seas in the Mage world. Its surface area was comparable to a few continents, and there were many intelligent creatures in it. Because of the high concentration of elements in the sea, there were more powerful creatures in the sea than on land. There were even creatures from the fourth and fifth circles in the depths.

Therefore, no one explored this ocean yet.

Eli didn’t dare to go too deep either, but fortunately, his target this time was only near the coast.

“Since this is the place, get ready. I’m going to enter.” Eli said calmly as he looked at them. He then took out the alchemy hub and many daily necessities from the arcane realm.

The three of them, “…”

The three of them were dumbfounded, not understanding what Eli was trying to do.

“My Lord, this is …” Morenson looked at the items and felt a sense of foreboding.

“I’m making preparations. You guys don’t think I’m going to go down like this, do you? at least I have to take into account the situation inside and the nearby situation, the current flow of the ocean, and other possible factors.” Eli cast a strange glance at the three of them.

Morenson sucked in a breath of cold air. According to his plan, they should be able to return in half a month at most, but from the looks of it, it might take longer.

“Don’t worry. It won’t take long.” Eli consoled the three of them.

The three of them nodded. Eli was just conducting a test. How long could it take?

..

...

Two years later.

In front of the shore, the three of them looked helplessly at Eli, who had once again retracted his shadow eye.

Wasn’t this too f * cking cautious?!

Eli had taken two years to investigate a murloc tribe. It was ridiculous!

On the other side.

Retracting his shadow eye, Eli straightened his body again and turned to look at the three of them. “I’ve already figured out the environment in the vicinity, including all the forces nearby and the situation of the murloc tribe.

“I’ve already confirmed that this is a mission that can be carried out.”

“Then when does Milord plan to set off?” Morenson asked excitedly.

It had been two whole years. They had actually wasted two years on this beach. If it weren’t for the benefits that Eli had given them, they would have left already. And this day was finally about to end.

“After some calculations, there won’t be any ocean activities tomorrow. The timing is the most suitable. Yes, ” said Eli directly.

“Yes, we will definitely keep watch for you, Sir.” The three of them said.

...

“Yes!”

..

The next day.

It was a sunny day, cloudless for thousands of miles, and the sea was calm.

Eli was also under the gaze of the three of them, and then he walked straight into the ocean.

His speed was very fast, and soon, his entire body was submerged in the endless sea.

The three of them looked at each other and then went back to their work. They were responsible for the backup.
