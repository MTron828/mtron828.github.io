100 Saleen Metatrin’s Journey

New calendar.

First Era, year 3010

“I’ve come to the shadow lizard bloodline Warlock’s territory. The environment here is not bad, and there are many interesting materials.

“I’ve fused with the bloodline of a shadow magic beast, so those warlocks can’t see any difference at all. They only think that I’m the same kind as them. On the surface, I get along well with them, but in my heart, I look down on these warlocks who have completely lost their will to explore the truth.

“They’re no longer worthy of being called Mages.”

The first page of the journal seemed to be about Saleen metatrin coming to a new place.

But what did he mean?

Warlocks should only be a type of Mages, so why would Saleen say that they had lost their will to explore the truth?

It was a little strange, and Eli didn’t quite understand.

Eli continued to read.

“Oh, I heard that there were a small mage’s ruins nearby. It might be the ruins of the Academy here. Maybe I can find something good there.

“Alright, that place is completely abandoned and has been searched. There’s nothing of value. I’m disappointed.

“I heard that there’s a small mage organization here today. I’m so surprised that there’s a mage organization here. I want to find them. I need more knowledge.

“I secretly participated in their exchange meeting. It’s really great. This feeling of knowledge clashing!”

Between the lines, Eli could also feel the changes in Saleen’s mind.

First, he explored the ruins, and then he found a Mage organization and participated in an exchange meeting.

Everything seemed normal, but it didn’t make any sense.

Why was he so happy to find out that there was a small mage organization? But didn’t he just join a shadow warlock’s group? Were mages and warlocks different?

“It’s so strange!” Eli frowned.

The diary had stunned him from the start. This was also the reason why he had no understanding of the Mage’s World at all. How should he put it? The world seemed to be a little different from what Eli had imagined.

Curious, Eli continued to read.

What happened next was mostly about what happened in the warlock’s territory, including some temporary camps, explorations, research, and so on.

Everything seemed normal, but why did Eli feel a faint sense of caution?

It seemed that Saleen was afraid of being exposed, so he had always appeared as a Warlock by infusing his life force with a shadow bloodline. However, something happened later.

“Year 3015 of the first era. Damn it, with the increase in my mental power, and my lifespan is flowing away faster. Damn it. I have to think of something.

“Alright, I had no other choice. Perhaps I should have chosen the path of a Warlock from the start. Although I chose to advance to a Mage and then fuse with a Warlock’s bloodline, which was indeed stronger, I also lost many things that warlocks could have. It’s a pity that I didn’t understand the drawbacks of a Mage at that time. No. It’s not the drawbacks of being a mage but the drawbacks of this world.

“If I don’t want to die, I don’t have much of a choice. I can either walk the dark path and continue advancing until I break through to the second ring. At that time, my life force will increase once more, or I can choose some other method.”

Will the increase in mental power increase the loss of life force?

Up to this point, Eli deeply understood that something was definitely wrong.

Why would the increase in mental power consume vitality at a faster rate? It was simply ridiculous.

This didn’t follow any rules at all!

“Something’s not right. There must be some common knowledge that I don’t know.” Eli knew that there was a problem, but he didn’t know where the problem was.

Saleen Metatrin did not write down the reason for this in his log.

Eli took a deep breath and tried to keep calm.

Since there wasn’t anything, he would have to analyze it himself.

Saleen’s log mentioned the advancement to a Warlock and the integration of bloodlines after the advancement.

Through his previous studies, Eli also knew the difference between the two.

The former was to integrate the bloodline directly when advancing to the first circle. After that, the main focus would be to explore the bloodline talent spell. Most of the time, this talent would force the mage to give up other aspects, especially the elemental ones. After all, the bloodline would directly affect the mage’s connection to the elements.

However, there were also benefits. This would allow him to completely inherit the power of his bloodline, and his lifespan would also be greatly increased, far exceeding that of ordinary mages.

The second method was to use the bloodline as a tool. It would not be too different from the first method. However, the mages wouldn’t have any bloodline warlock talent, and their lifespan wouldn’t increase.

The former was like a heretic among mages, relying on the power of blood and not having a strong desire for knowledge, while the latter was digging for knowledge.

There was a saying that described it this way.

The power of a Warlock came from their bloodline, while the power of a wizard came from knowledge.

However, the Warlocks in the log seemed to be even more extreme. Saleen criticized them as having completely lost the will to explore the truth, which was very strange.

Saleen also mentioned a fault with the world.

Eli had a faint feeling that something might have gone wrong with this world.

“Is there a problem with this world?” Eli was also taken aback by his own idea. After all, it was too whimsical and even outrageous.

“I don’t think so. No, it’s fine.” Eli’s thoughts were a mess. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

In fact, he just realized that he knew nothing about this world.

His exploration of this world was still limited to the Bryne Empire and other mortal worlds. However, what about the mage’s world? Or did it even exist?

This was an unknown.

“Forget it. Let’s continue reading.” He knew there was a problem, but he wouldn’t solve anything, so he decided to continue reading.

“I participated in the blood sacrifice of the warlocks. They seemed to want to exchange life force with an unknown existence through this method. I’m against this idea because true mages should be the ones who pursue the truth.

“But I still agreed in the end.

“The blood sacrifice has begun. Damn it. We’ve been discovered.

“The warlocks discovered our ‘evil’ conduct, and we were hunted down. Fortunately, I managed to escape.

“This group of warlocks seemed to be troubled by the loss of life force, so they used blood sacrifice.”

At this moment, Eli didn’t want to think too much. He decided to wait until he finished watching.

“I’ve escaped,

“I reached zero circle too late back then, and my life force was indeed not enough.

“but I found a secret plane of the four circles celestial sorcerer Antonio from 5000 years ago. The location is in the West, a place called the southern desert. There are no sorcerers willing to go to that place for a long time. It’s a barren land.

“These are the mages who remained after the great catastrophe. I heard that the secret celestial plane could also slow down the speed of the loss of life, and there may be some celestial mage’s remains inside. It is said that there is a life-prolonging spirit grass there as well. I have decided to go.”
