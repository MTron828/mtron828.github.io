56 Arrival

After a night’s rest, the journey to the Lorraine kingdom began again.

For safety reasons, they traveled along the main road most of the time, but occasionally they would pass through the territory of some nobles. The local nobles would actively cooperate and send people to escort them, as well as appropriately supplement some resources for the convoy.

Every time this happened, it also meant that they could rest for a day. After all, this was a long journey, so they naturally needed to rest. Not everyone’s physique was the same as that of knights.

To Eli, it was also an interesting trip.

Along the way, Eli saw a lot of interesting things, and he would occasionally collect some items that Jun Lin did not have. Some of his knowledge also increased rapidly.

Ten days later, the convoy arrived at the border.

After some negotiations, the convoy successfully crossed the border and entered the boundary of the Lorraine Kingdom.

The kingdom of Lorraine had also sent a group of people to receive them, and the carriage was led forward.

Perhaps it was just like what Eli thought the other day, seeing the seven-petaled flower was a symbol of good luck.

The journey was very smooth, and they did not encounter any obstacles. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

However, after thinking about it, it made sense. After all, they were representing the Bryne empire. If anything happened to them, it would inevitably cause a huge dispute. This was something that the Lorraine kingdom did not want to see. Therefore, the Lorraine kingdom would definitely ensure their safety within the kingdom.

As for Eli, he was also observing along the way.

In fact, the Bryne empire and the Lorraine kingdom were located in similar locations. They were basically flat lands. However, as the carriage moved forward, eli also noticed the differences between the two countries.

The first was the land.

Perhaps it was due to the difference in location, but the soil quality of the Lorraine Kingdom was better than that of the Bryne Empire. This resulted in the Lorraine Kingdom being able to produce a large amount of food every year. Other than for their own use, they would even export a large amount of food to the Bryne Empire.

Eli guessed that this was an important reason why the king had chosen to establish diplomatic relations with the kingdom of Lorraine.

The second was the people.

Eli could clearly sense that the population here was not as large as that of the Bryne Empire, and there should be some differences between the people here and the Bryne Empire. For example, the people here were generally taller, and their eyes were big. Their pupils were mainly blue, which made them look very exotic.

Of course, this was only what Eli had observed simply. If he really wanted to understand the differences between the two countries in detail, he would need to observe more closely, but he had no interest in that.

He was here for a public tour, not to check out the local customs.

Just like that, eli enjoyed the scenery along the way and arrived at their destination.

The capital of the Lorraine kingdom, Douling city.

This was a city that was no less magnificent than Jun Lin city. In fact, it was even more prosperous than Jun Lin city. Thanks to the food business, the Lorraine Kingdom’s military might not be as strong as the Bryne Empire, but their wealth was not inferior, or even more.

This could be seen from the magnificence of the city walls. Whether it was the sniper cannons every few meters on the city walls or the armor of the soldiers that reflected the sunlight, it fully demonstrated the wealth of the country.

At the city gate, they were inspected as usual.

After the inspection, the carriage entered Duoling.

“Is this Duoling?” sitting in the carriage, eli looked outside.

At this time, the carriage was traveling on a very wide road. The road was paved with stone bricks, and the width was enough to accommodate ten carriages running at the same time.

On both sides were shops, all of which were three stories or above. This was something that couldn’t be seen in jun Lin because the houses in jun lin were usually two stories high. Of course, this was just a difference in habits.

Perhaps it was because it was afternoon, but there were many people on the road. Most of the men were wearing gray clothes, while most of the women were wearing purple and red clothes, revealing their arms and legs. They even had jewelry on their heads, which made them look very sexy.

This made many of the casual soldiers’ eyes pop out of their sockets. In Junlin, there were very few women who would dress so sexily outside. If you revealed too much, you would even be arrested by the guards.

But Duoling was different. Women had a higher status.

Of course, this wasn’t without reason. This was because the current Supreme Leader of the Lorraine Kingdom, Queen Cynthia, was a woman.

As Eli observed the people, there were naturally people observing the convoy.

“Is this the symbol of the Bryne empire?” On the way, a man asked an old man beside him.

“I think so. the symbol of the Bryne empire is the black dragon. Look at the carriage in the front row. It has the black dragon symbol! ” The old man pointed at the convoy at the front.

” I wonder what they’re doing in our country? ”

“Who knows? That’s a matter between the nobles and the Queen. What does it have to do with us? ” The old man said without a care.

“Well, that’s true. It has nothing to do with us!” The man was stunned. However, it seemed to be the case after some thought.

Even if something did happen, it would have nothing to do with him.

The man observed the convoy for a while longer before he turned around and left.

...

On the other side, the convoy had also arrived at their destination under the guidance of the people from the Lorraine Kingdom.

It was a hotel that was dedicated to receiving outsiders.

When Eli walked into the inn, he looked at the compact tiles on the floor, the chandeliers that were worth at least dozens of gold tarls hanging in the hall, and the portraits hanging on the walls.

It was only then that eli truly realized that the Lorraine kingdom was truly rich!

“Eli, let’s go to our room first!” beside him, scholar clement patted Eli’s shoulder and motioned for him to follow him.

The two of them followed a waiter who was waiting for them and soon arrived at their room.

The room was also very luxurious. The bed was covered in goose down, the bedding was smooth, and the furniture was made of mahogany. This made Clement a little stunned.

“Teacher,” Eli patted Clement on the shoulder.

“Um.” Scholar Clement recovered and said slowly, “It seems that the alliance this time is not as simple as it seems?”

??

Eli frowned. What did this hotel have to do with the alliance?

“Teacher, is there a problem?” It was always Eli’s habit to ask if he didn’t understand.

Scholar Clement looked over and said slowly, ” I’ve been to Duoling before, and we stayed in this very hotel, but that was 30 years ago. I came here with my teacher.

“However, the king back then was not the current queen of Cynthia, but king Harriman. Back then, this place was very simple, with only a bed and simple furniture, but it was also very crude. But now, just look at this hotel, and it’s so luxurious. What do you think this means?”

When he said the last sentence, scholar Clement looked at Eli and said worriedly, “To be able to develop the country to such a great extent in such a short period of time, it seems like this Queen Cynthia isn’t a simple character. Will she really agree to an alliance so easily? ”

‘Just that?’ Eli thought it was something worse.

“But teacher, what does this have to do with us? The negotiation should have nothing to do with us, right?” Eli said with a strange expression.

Scholar Clement, “...”
