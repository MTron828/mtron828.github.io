486 Shattered Space

Trash!

In the city, the six of them were hiding in the Mage Tower. Their faces were all ugly.

“He’s too arrogant. I’m going to kill him.”

“He’s too f * cking crazy.”

“But it doesn’t matter anymore. Since he dares to come, we’ll take his head!”

They gritted their teeth, the anger in their eyes burning.

As a half-demon transformed by Nero, they usually looked fine, but once they were angered or saw blood, their brutality and terror would be completely different.

Now that they had been humiliated by Eli, they all wanted to kill Eli.

No one even thought about when Eli had discovered them.

However, this was no longer important.

The few of them looked at each other. In the next second, a huge aura instantly erupted. Everything in the Mage Tower in front of them turned into countless flying ashes, revealing the blue sky.

“Eli!”

A few of them roared in anger, and six black-purple light pillars tore through the sky and flew directly into the sky above Rolle City. Then, they stood at the same level as Eli and looked at each other.

At this moment, other than a few people who knew what was going on, the others looked at the aura in the sky with their mouths wide open.

“The six auras are not inferior to the previous Soran… Could it be that all six of them were half-step fifth-circle warlocks? How was this possible?” Vivika’s eyes widened as fear spread in her heart.

She never thought that the heart of the abyss would set up such an ambush!

That was six!

The Heart of the Abyss actually had so many half-step fifth-circle warlocks. Could it be that they had held back last time…Was this the strength of the number one force in the Western Regions?

Vivika was dumbfounded, and Nikola’s expression changed drastically!

“This…” His throat moved slightly, but he couldn’t say anything.

The scene in front of him had already exceeded his imagination.

“Sir, you have to work hard!” He could only pray silently.

“Six half-step fifth circle warlocks. So this is what Lord Nero prepared?”

“Hahahaha, looks like Eli is going to die here!”

After being stunned for a second, the Heart of the Abyss’ side also revealed smiles.

Even they did not expect Sir Nero to send so many people. They were probably their trump cards, but it was worth it. Even if Eli were the reincarnation of a god, he would not be able to leave this place alive.

There was no suspense on the battlefield.

He even took the initiative to declare war. He must be stupid!

Dozens of kilometers away from the battlefield, a large number of scouts from various factions were watching this scene with shocked expressions.

“The Heart of the Abyss is actually so strong. It’s no wonder it’s the number one faction in the Western Regions!”

“It’s over!”

Everyone quickly spread the information back. Some people even began to organize the information and then sent back the predicted victory of the Heart of Abyss.

No one thought that Eli had a chance of winning.

Of course, no one left. It was not because they wanted to see which side won. They purely wanted to observe the strength of the six people and the information they had. These might be useful in the future.

..

Hundreds of thousands of eyes were focused on him.

The six people in front of him were scattered in a fan shape. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“Were you modified by Nero again? Is there no normal person in the Heart of the Abyss now?

“Although you’ve become stronger after the transformation, you can’t control yourselves anymore. Your mind is also affected. You get angry so easily. Tsk tsk tsk.” Eli said calmly as he looked at the patterns on their bodies.

“You seem to know something?” Eli’s words contained a lot of information, and they were stunned. The anger in their eyes dissipated bit by bit, and then they looked at Eli cautiously.

“I know all about it. Let’s see if the six of you can stop me!”

Eli did not intend to waste his breath on these people. He hooked his finger!

He knew everything?!

Eli’s words scared them, and they looked at each other.

Finally, the old man broke the silence and said, “No matter how much you know, as long as you stay here today, everything will be fine.

“Let’s do it, everyone. We must make him stay here today.” He looked at the other five and said directly.

“Good!”

The five of them said in unison, and even the old man retreated dozens of meters.

The next meter.

Accompanied by six soaring blood auras, six giant objects appeared in the sky.

Each of them was at least 500 to 600 meters tall, like a mountain. Three of them had the Balor bloodline, and there was also a bone demon, a lust demon, and a chain demon.

There was nothing much to say about the Balor. The Bone Demon had bone wings, and its body was as ugly as a skeleton. There were also bone spurs on its back. The Chain Demon was like a black-red giant, but its head was like an octopus with tentacles. The tentacles were connected to metal-like full moon scimitars and giant sickles, shining with a cold light.

Six figures appeared and flew in all directions, surrounding Eli from all directions to prevent him from escaping.

On the other hand, Eli’s gaze was still calm, but his body was also gradually erupting with blood.

Roar!

Endless darkness enveloped Eli, followed by a terrifying dragon roar. Then, a shadow dragon that was nearly a thousand meters long stepped out of the shadows, its golden eyes narrowed at the few of them!

“The target is stronger than we thought, but he is not our match!”

One of the Balors shouted loudly, still confident.

The others were also smiling, looking at Eli with hostility. They either showed their white teeth or rubbed their bone spurs or giant scythes, ready to attack at any time.

Looking at the few of them, Eli smiled and immediately activated the celestial Power in his body.

A torrent of Celestial Power instantly dissipated, and the tulle-like Power slowly attached itself to Eli’s skin. Then, it slowly turned silver-gray and covered the Shadow Dragon’s body like armor.

Not just once, its originally huge body expanded again.

A thousand meters!

1,100 meters.

..

1,500 meters.

It only stopped when it reached a length of 1,500 meters. The demons in front of them were like children, and they were completely stunned.

“What exactly happened?” The Bone Demon’s sharp voice sounded, and he was a little uneasy.

The others also looked at each other in bewilderment.

Why was there a second transformation?

It was a little challenging for their understanding, and it felt a little different.

“Hmph, he’s only a half-step fifth circle. No matter how much he transforms, how strong can he be?”

At this time, one of the Balors opened its mouth and said in a muffled voice.

At the same time, a flaming axe slowly appeared in his hand. It was burning with dark purple flames. That was the law he had mastered. The flames were scorching hot.

A better temperature, a temperature that could break through laws!

The moment the flames appeared, holes appeared in the space around him. The space was burned and damaged, and the surrounding temperature rapidly increased. One could see that the space was still there.

“Go to hell, Eli.”

The Balor brandished its great axe, and a five-hundred-meter-long axe shadow appeared in the sky. The sky shook, and a thousand-meter-long crack appeared in space.

Meanwhile, Eli only watched as a Shadow Dragon Breath slowly formed in front of him.

It was ready to go.

“Wait a minute… This energy level. This is not right!” Sensing the shadow, the attacking Balor’s eyes trembled, and fear rose in its heart.

He seemed a little impulsive!

His biological instincts were telling him that he might die!

However, it was too late. He had no other choice but to continue his attack.

He roared angrily and chose to burn his bloodline. The axe instantly grew to a thousand meters in size, and the flames burning on it were like a huge sun, burning the sky and boiling the sea!

“Go to hell!”

The Balor said madly.

Eli did not panic because he was already prepared.

Looking at the Balor, his eyes were calm, and his tone was cold.

“Shadow Dragon Breath!”
