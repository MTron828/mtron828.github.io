577 End

The Deep Sea Demon Whale King was dead!

Even though it had used all sorts of defensive methods and even burned its bloodline, when the world descended, it was instantly torn into countless fragments. There was not even a single wail.

And seeing the Deep Sea Demon Whale King die, there was no longer any debate about the issue of the sixth circle.

After its death, the outcome of the war was already decided.

The Sea Giant Emperor, as well as all the Sea Tribes with the fourth circle and above, were all slaughtered by Eli. The low-level Sea Tribes were also massacred by the Warlocks, and tens of millions of Sea Tribes died.

The pungent blood dyed the sea for tens of thousands of miles red, and the white bones turned the battlefield into a white continent. A large number of undead were even born here, but it all benefited Nikola.

The battle ended.

On the city wall, Ely looked at the sea calmly. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Sir, most of the Sea Tribes have been dealt with, but there are still many who have escaped!” Alida walked out and looked at Eli with reverence.

“Yes.” Eli nodded.

“And Lord, this is the ocean crown that fell after the Deep Sea Demon Whale King died. I’ve already found it!” Nikola took out another golden crown and offered it to Eli.

Eli took the golden crown and smiled.

He sent his consciousness into it and found that it was similar to what the Demon Whale Emperor had said. It was a top-grade sixth-circle magic tool, and it was also his greatest harvest from this battle.

The only pity was that it did not match him. Of course, this did not diminish its value.

Eli put it away and turned to look behind him.

The Warlocks, led by Kyle, collectively lowered their heads, their faces nervous.

“Kyle, just now, Alida told me everything you’ve been doing these past few days. What do you think?” Eli looked at Kyle, waiting for an answer.

Gulp!

Kyle’s throat trembled slightly as cold sweat trickled down his forehead.

Ever since Eli had displayed his sixth-circle combat ability, he knew that all his plans would fall apart. Moreover, he had to pay the price for his previous actions. Otherwise, he had no doubt that he would not be able to leave this place alive today.

“Good!”

The people behind Kyle also expressed their willingness to serve Eli and the Bloodline Alliance to make up for what they had done.

Looking at this scene, Alida was filled with emotions.

A day ago, these people had been indifferent to the Bloodline Tower, but now they had changed their attitude. All of this was because of Eli. If it weren’t for Eli, these people wouldn’t have behaved like this. Of course, she didn’t say anything more because if her master hadn’t come, they might not have been able to leave this place alive.

“Alright, leave some Warlocks here to deal with this. The rest can return.”

Seeing that his goal had been achieved, Eli did not stop and said directly.

“Yes.” Everyone nodded.

Half an hour later.

Eli led the Warlocks of the Bloodline Alliance back to Bloodline City!

Of course, this caused another commotion, and cheers resounded throughout the city.

As for Eli, he naturally returned to the Grassi Lands.

However, the moment he returned, he did not rest. Instead, he closed his eyes as if he was connecting something!

On the other side.

Jin Ji smiled when he heard the news that Eli had advanced to the sixth ring.

As expected, he was right.

..

After Eli returned, the victory of the Sea Tribe war was announced. The news of Eli reaching the sixth ring spread throughout the continent at a rapid speed, shocking the continent.

At the same time, the news of the death of the Sea Tribe also spread to the deep sea.

Mermaids!

Laura listened to Eval’s report with a dull expression. She only reacted slowly when she finished speaking.

“Are you saying that the lord has awakened and advanced to six rings?” Laura asked in shock.

“Yes.” Eval nodded.

“Then the Deep Sea Demon Whale Emperor, Ink Turtle Emperor, and Sea Giant Emperor all died?”

“And then, more than seventy percent of the Sea Tribe army that went there died?”

“Yes!”

Hiss!

Laura inhaled a breath of cold air, and her body couldn’t help but lean back against the shell!

It wasn’t that she wasn’t calm, but that this matter was too shocking.

The Lord had actually advanced to the sixth circle and killed three emperors of the sea race.

The former was enough to make the Sea Tribe afraid because there was no one with a sixth circle or above in the Sea Tribe at the moment. The latter meant that the Sea Tribe’s strength had been greatly reduced, and they could no longer be a match for the human who had Eli!

This meant…The sea race was about to change.

Laura and Eval looked at each other and realized the problem.

At the same time, a merman swam in from outside the palace and said anxiously, “Your Majesty, the new Imperial Dynasty meeting will be held in three days.”

Three days later.

Laura left worriedly.

Two days later, she came back with an ugly complexion.

“Sir, how was the meeting?” Eval looked at Laura and asked with a frown.

“We’re done for!” Laura shook her head. “The meeting has already turned the tables on this matter. Both factions are panicking. They are already afraid of Eli.

“Moreover, because most of the members who participated in the war were from aggressive factions, they suffered heavy losses. This time, the strength of the moderate party had surpassed the aggressive party. At the meeting, with the Giant Octopus as the leader, they proposed to revoke the leadership of the Deep Sea Demon Whale Clan and elect a new king of the Sea Tribe!”

“What?” Eval’s eyes widened as if he did not expect such a thing to happen.

” Also, the aggressive Faction, who understood that they couldn’t keep their throne, decided to take crazy revenge on the human race. With the vastness of the ocean, they attacked the continent from many corners. They didn’t invest in the highest-end combat forces but used low-end combat forces to wear down the human race with numbers.” Laura continued, her tone somewhat hesitant.

“This…” Eval’s expression also turned ugly.

It had to be said that this was indeed a solution.

There were too many low-level sea races in the ocean. If a few deep-sea races scattered and hid in the deep sea, even Eli would find it difficult to find them.

In fact, this guerilla tactic was the only solution.

If they were in the mage’s world, the mages would beat them up.

But now, Eli alone could not find them.

“I have to report this to Milord immediately.”

Laura sighed, feeling a little troubled!

..

“Revenge!”

Eli lowered his head and put down the statue. He was not surprised by the behavior of the Sea Tribe.

However, they had given up on a direct confrontation. Did this mean that the Sea Tribe did not have the combat strength of a sixth-circle creature?

Eli pondered.

If they really had sixth-circle creatures, they wouldn’t have used such a method. After all, it could even be said to be despicable.

“Doesn’t that mean that as long as I head to the deep sea, find a few Sea Race Kings, and kill them, the problem will be solved?” Eli blinked.

The problem of the sea race had to be solved. This seemed to be a good solution.

“No, no, this is just my guess. How do I know that they don’t have sixth-circle creatures? No, no, no!” Eli shook his head. He couldn’t do something he wasn’t sure of.

Most importantly, how could he find them in the deep sea?

Wasn’t this like looking for a needle in a haystack?

“Sigh, forget it.” Shaking his head, Eli decided to give up on this idea.

But at this moment, a voice suddenly entered Elo’s consciousness.

“Sir, the surveillance system of the Gray Wizard Tower has been repaired.”

The familiar voice belonged to Dylan.

The Wizard Tower was his possession, so he could contact Eli directly.

Hearing this, Eli’s eyes lit up.
