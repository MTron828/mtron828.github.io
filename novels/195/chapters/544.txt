545 Eternal Life Society

The next day!

“The harvest this time is not small.”

Eli looked at the three items in front of him with a sigh.

There was an ordinary-looking spiritual wood that emitted a unique aura, a burning flame that was gathered in an oil lamp, and finally, a handful of soil that weighed about ten grams.

The spirit wood was found in the Dylo family, in the center of its bloodline land. It was enveloped by a large number of divine trees, and its level had reached grade 6.

!!

“It should be the core of a sixth circle tree-type creature or a part of an existence above the seventh circle.” Eli made his own judgment.

“Not bad. When the time comes, I’ll use it and go to the Time World Fragment to collect some time elements. After fusing them together, I should be able to upgrade the staff to the sixth circle and increase its power.” After making his decision, Eli looked at the flames at the side, and his eyes lit up.

“The Eternal Flame, from the Press family’s top collection.” Eli pursed his lips, feeling a little hot.

It was not the temperature of the flame but the effect of the flame.

“It can burn the impurities in the bloodline to increase the level of the bloodline. After fusing with the body, it will continuously bind the bloodline and eventually increase the level of the bloodline by one level.”

Even just by looking at it, Eli could feel the desire of his bloodline for it.

To be honest, the Shadow Dragon Bloodline was a fifth-circle bloodline. In the past, it was naturally extremely powerful. However, compared to the families of the Warlock Alliance, it was indeed not qualified. This was because every family in the Warlock Alliance had a sixth-circle bloodline. This was also the most important reason why they were powerful.

“The Shadow Dragon bloodline only has a fifth circle, but the king of the bloodline should have a sixth circle. As long as I fuse it with my body, I’ll be able to turn my bloodline into a sixth circle sooner or later.” Eli felt a burning sensation in his heart.

Bloodline was extremely important to a Warlock, and it was the same for Eli.

His once powerful bloodline was about to become an obstacle that restricted his path. However, as long as he raised his bloodline to the sixth circle, he would not have to worry about this problem for a long time. Moreover, he could also increase his strength.

“As expected of the Warlock Alliance, they actually have such good stuff!” Eli smiled happily.

The last soil was also very interesting. It was the soil of the Wisdom Tree.

The Wisdom Tree was once a friend of the Mage World. It was a powerful ruler of the Multiverse, and its rank had reached the eighth circle. Its soil also had a magical effect that could temporarily increase one’s comprehension, even if it was to comprehend laws.

Even in the Mage World, it would be fought over by countless people. Even the sixth circle Mages would participate in the fight. It was only in the current world that it could fall into his hands.

“It just so happens that there are many things that I can’t figure out in the experiment.

“But this is going to help a lot!”

Eli grinned. What a happy coincidence.

These were all the items he had obtained in this round. There were a total of three items, but each of them was extremely precious!

Without hesitation, he picked up the oil lamp and took out a flame. Then, he swallowed it!

Gulp!

The golden flames entered his body like gold and then spread to every part of his body. At the same time, he felt his body gradually heat up. The impurities in his bloodline began to burn slowly, and the quality of his bloodline slowly increased.

“Awesome!”

Eli could not help but close his eyes.

This feeling came directly from the soul and bloodline. It was a joy that went straight to the soul. It was on a completely different level compared to the joy of material things. It was very refreshing.

And this pleasure lasted for three days.

Three days later, Eli finally woke up from his slumber.

“It’s really terrifying to be in such a state!” Eli shook his head.

He had always refused to slack off too much, but this time, it was really too satisfying.

He slowly got up and picked up the other two items.

The Eternal Flames burned fiercely in his body, but the upgrade was not over yet. This was because the upgrade of his bloodline required a very long time. It was not something that could be completed in a few years or decades.

Next, he would go to the time world fragment to speed up the process. During this time, he planned to upgrade the wizard staff and move the laboratory into the time world fragment.

“Of course, I still have to devour those Warlocks.”

Eli shook his head.

At this moment, he had already devoured several Warlocks. The total number of law flowers in his body had already reached 100, even surpassing his own body.

“This kind of rapid improvement is equally satisfying!” Eli pursed his lips and walked towards the laboratory.

..

A day later.

Eli entered the time world fragment again.

Three months later!

The new magic staff was a success.

“The new Eli Scepter, sixth circle. It’s based on time law and the sixth circle spirit wood. Its effect is to speed up the use of laws, increase attack speed, and at the same time strengthen the time law by about 30%.”

Eli looked at the new staff in his hand.

The silver-white spiral threads returned to simplicity and turned into brown wooden patterns. The hourglass at the head of the staff turned into a crystal, and the grains of time flowed like sand. This was what Eli had condensed through the law of time during this period.

“It took almost fifty years!”

Eli sighed. However, these 50 years were worth it.

With this staff, his strength increased once again.

“At this moment, my bloodline is also approaching the fifth circle. It has increased by about 3%.” Putting away his staff, Eli once again sensed the bloodline in his body.

As the Eternal Flame burned, his bloodline continued to improve, slowly but steadily.

“As long as I continue, I’ll break through sooner or later. After dealing with these, I can focus on improving my strength and experimenting. I can also start devouring the remaining shadow laws and timeline lightning again!” Eli pondered.

The environment outside was not stable. He needed to increase his strength as soon as possible.

Speaking of which, many things have happened in the past six months.

Although there was no conflict between the Lich Tower and the Bloodline Alliance, there was an organization in the shadows called the Eternal Life Society, an organization that converted warlocks into Liches and pursued immortality.

According to the investigation, they had been secretly gathering people in their territory, and their mastermind was most likely the Lich Tower. There was no doubt that they had no good intentions.

Therefore, as long as the Bloodline Alliance caught anyone from the Eternal Life Society, they had to be killed.

They didn’t know what was required to break through for high-level Liches, but for low-level Liches, they only needed a large number of sacrifices and an item given by the Lich Tower.

Therefore, there had been a few tragedies in the Bloodline Tower, which had caused quite a bit of impact.

” What’s worse is that this kind of immortality has already been noticed by more people. It’s troublesome!” Eli shook his head. He felt a wave of trouble. Fortunately, the method had not spread far and wide yet. Otherwise, it would be really annoying. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

But he knew that conflict would erupt sooner or later.

“I need to be stronger.”

Eli felt a sense of urgency and took out the remaining half of the Law of Shadow.

He had once thought of using it to make a mage Tool, but the current situation did not allow it.

Crack!

Eli swallowed a large piece of shadow law and digested it.

No matter what happened, as long as he was strong enough, it would not be a problem.
