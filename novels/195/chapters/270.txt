271 Jin Ji Leaves

A month later, the silver Moon banquet began with the explosion of strong elements.

Jin Ji, who had already reached the limit of the second circle, came over.

Two days later, Eli met with jin ji again.

Taking the four elemental hearts, Eli silently thought of the situation where he had failed to obtain anything for the past fifty years despite hundreds of people. He sighed, feeling that he had underestimated the person blessed by fate.

“It’s been a long time,” Eli looked at Jin ji and sighed.

In just a few decades, he had already reached such a level.

In addition to Jin Ji’s talent, he also had the Golden Cicada Chamber of Commerce’s huge resources. With the support of these two, it would be strange if Jin Ji’s progress wasn’t fast.

“It’s nothing compared to my lord. My lord’s deeds were widely spread some time ago!” Compared to fifty years ago, jin ji was even more astute now, but he still maintained his respect in front of Eli!

“Sigh, it’s just a rumor!”

Eli waved his hand. He didn’t want to, but it had already happened.

“I still have to thank you for your elemental heart. I really need it. Thank you!” Eli thanked him with a smile.

Without Jin Ji, he might not have been able to obtain so many element hearts in 1500 years, let alone 150.

“This is what I should do.” As time went by, Jin Ji realized that he seemed to be particularly sensitive to resources! “Oh right, my Lord, I’m about to break through to the third circle. In five years at most, I’ll be leaving!” Jin Ji seemed to have thought of something as he raised his head and said to Eli.

“Yes.” Eli nodded.

“Oh, right. I need some information. If possible, I hope you can help me collect it.” Eli looked at Jin ji and said.

“Oh?”

“Information on celestial!” Eli looked at Jin ji and said, one word at a time.

He’s about to break through to the late stage of the third circle, and it’s time for him to consider the serious issue of breaking through to the celestial realm. However, the information on breaking through to the celestial realm is extremely precious, even in the past.

At least, he did not find any in the bloodline tower.

He could only wait and see if Jin Ji had any connections.

“Information on celestial?” Jin Ji frowned and seemed to be thinking about something!

Ten seconds later, he said slowly, ” my Lord, this might not be easy to get. There’s definitely no such thing on the West Coast. I might need to go to the central continent to see if I can get it!

“That’s fine,” Eli said.

He didn’t place all his hopes on Jin Ji. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Apart from him, there were actually two other directions. One was the ruins on the West Coast, and the other was the hourglass of time. From that Warlock, Eli learned that there seemed to be a lot of relevant information in the hourglass!

He would take it slow. Anyway, there was still a long time before he would break through.

“The information on warlock’s breakthroughs has been strictly kept. Even if I go there, it will be difficult to obtain it. I can’t do anything about it.” Jin Ji nodded in agreement.

Although it was difficult, since it was a request from His Excellency, he would give it a try.

Eli, “…”

“Wait!” Eli raised his hand, and only then did he realize that something seemed to have gone wrong. He pursed his lips and said slowly, “Actually, what I want is information on Mage breaking through!”

“Ah!”

If it were information about mages, the difficulty would be much lower.

“My Lord, if it’s information on mages, I should be able to find a way to find it once I’ve settled down in the central continent!” Jin Ji said.

He wasn’t joking. If he wanted to obtain information on warlocks, the difficulty would be five. The difficulty for Magi would be three at most. Although it wasn’t easy, it shouldn’t be impossible for him.

“Then, my Lord, I’ll come and visit you when I’m there.”

Jin Ji stood up and prepared to leave.

“Alright!”

..

Three days passed in the blink of an eye.

After jin ji left, Eli used the four elemental hearts, and his talent improved once again. In the end, he successfully broke through level four and reached level three.

His meditation speed had increased by a lot.

“Cool!” Eli felt the changes in his body, and it was very comfortable.

The effects brought by the increase in his talent were continuous. It seemed that the time he needed to break through to the late stage of the third circle would be shortened by quite a bit.

He hoped that everything would go smoothly.

With his talent upgraded, Eli quickly returned to the bloodline tower.

He began to feel the changes carefully.

In the blink of an eye, three years had passed.

In the past three years, the bloodline tower’s power had expanded rapidly, and the number of third-circle warlocks had actually increased to more than a dozen. Although it was not as strong as the Holy tower, it was not too far off.

This was also thanks to the good things that Eli had done in the past.

At that time, in order to capture Sergei, the Holy tower had sent most of their high-level third-circle warlocks, but they were all destroyed by Eli in one fell swoop. Even the Holy tower was helpless about this.

Hence, the heart of darkness region that they had painstakingly conquered …

In the past few years, they had no choice but to split the profits equally with the bloodline tower. As a result, the bloodline tower had inexplicably risen from a force with little sense of existence to the most influential force on the West Coast!

It had to be said that this was the influence of high-end combat power on an organization in the mage world.

During this time, the Holy tower didn’t do anything. It was quietly absorbing the heart of darkness and the resources from the time hourglass to recover.

...

Although it seemed like they had shrunk their forces, everyone knew that when the Holy tower was ready again, the war would break out again.

At that time, they would definitely try their best to get rid of the bloodline tower, and the bloodline tower would resist. After all, if the Holy tower failed, they might still have time to escape, but once the bloodline tower was destroyed, they would never have a chance to turn the tables.

It was the same for Eli. Once the hourglass unified this place …

It would also have a huge impact on Eli’s breakthrough into the celestial realm in the future.

After all, breaking through to the celestial realm required far more resources than a third-circle warlock. It was a sea of resources that would probably take the entire West Coast to gather.

So this time, Eli wasn’t going to let go!

Of course, this was under the condition of ensuring his safety. If his life were in danger, he would still leave without hesitation. After all, his life was the most important thing in this vast world.

Everything seemed to be calm, but everyone knew that a storm was brewing.

Let’s see when this storm will start.

..

As time passed.

...

A year later, the Holy tower’s vitality had basically recovered.

There were nearly 20 third-circle warlocks in the bloodline tower. At first, Vivika was worried that he wouldn’t be able to control them, but after a year of Eli’s presence, everyone was instantly at ease.

The two forces were ready.

Although there had yet to be a major war, small-scale skirmishes were gradually increasing, and the atmosphere on the entire West Coast suddenly became tense.

At this moment, an unexpected guest came to visit!

On the square outside the bloodline tower, Jin Ji’s airship slowly landed. Jin Ji and Jin Yin from the Golden Cicada Chamber of Commerce’s meeting, who were at the limit of the third circle, arrived at the bloodline tower.

In the living room, Eli saw the two of them.

“My Lord, I’m leaving today!” As soon as they met, Jin Ji stated his purpose. “I’m here to say goodbye to you, Sir.”

Looking at the two of them, Eli nodded.

Jin Ji’s departure was only a matter of time, but he didn’t expect him to come to say goodbye.

“This is my token. If you come to the central continent in the future, you can find me through this!” Jin Ji took out a token and handed it to Eli.

Eli didn’t refuse and took the token. It was a special golden token that was very different from normal tokens.

He might really go to the central continent in the future, but it was not certain when. It might be a few thousand years later. He hoped that Jin Ji would still be alive by then!

“My Lord, that’s all I came here for today. We’ll take our leave first.”

“Alright!”

Very quickly, Eli sent the two of them off.

Looking at the airship gradually rising into the sky, Eli turned around and returned to the Wizard Tower.

Jin Ji was an investment for the future, and the next time they met, it would be time for him to reap all his benefits. He also hoped that Jin Ji could find information on the breakthrough.

That way, he wouldn’t have to go through all the ruins to find it!

Just as he returned to the Tower, Vivika came to him with another piece of news.

“Teacher, the war has begun!”

Eli’s eyes narrowed slightly, naturally understanding what she meant.

The war between the bloodline tower and the Holy tower had finally begun after four years of preparation!
