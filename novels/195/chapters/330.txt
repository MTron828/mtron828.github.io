331 Mercury Island

Mercury Island!

An Island in the middle of the West Coast. It was about five square kilometers in area and was covered with rocks. It was also quite scarce in resources and had been abandoned for a long time.

However, following Eli’s orders, hundreds of people began to transform the island overnight.

In the end, a Mage tower, a laboratory, and other supporting facilities were built in the center of the island.

And a month later.

Eli arrived here accompanied by Aisha.

“Grandmaster, what do you think of this place?” Aisha brought Eli on a tour of the island.

“It’s alright.” Eli nodded.

The buildings on the island were very normal, so Eli didn’t have any objections.

“Alright, but Grandmaster, are you really going to move here?” Aisha asked hesitantly. Although this Island was considered close to the mainland, it was still more than ten kilometers away.

“Yes.” Eli nodded.

Since he had already decided, there was nothing more to say.

“Alright, I respect your decision, Grandmaster. If you need anything, you can inform us!” Aisha placed her right hand on her chest, bent over, and turned to leave.

Eli nodded.

Half an hour later, Aisha left with the others on the boat.

There was only one person on the entire island.

After some thought, Eli released Doggo and Hydra.

Doggo was assembling machines when he came out, and he was dumbfounded when he came out.

After taking a look at the environment that was surrounded by the sea and the island, he turned to look at Eli and asked strangely, “Are you planning to spend the rest of your life here alone?”

“No, it’s just a short rest!” Eli shot him a glance and said, “The next time we leave this place will be the time we head to the central continent!”

“Really?” Doggo’s eyes lit up, and his mechanical tail wagged in joy.

This was the first time he had received a concrete reply.

In his opinion, this should not take long.

As for the Hydra, it didn’t really care. It crawled towards a flat area in the center of the island and then fell into a deep sleep. This was the daily routine of the fusion beast.

..

In the blink of an eye, a month had passed.

A pool of blood appeared in the center of Mercury Island. Blood was boiling in the pool, and there were countless runes and spells besides the pool, emitting all kinds of vicious auras.

A person was completely submerged in it, and his head was exposed.

It was Eli.

His eyes were closed, and his face was covered in blood. A curse was wrapped around his body, and a mysterious connection was gradually formed between him and the blood, or rather, the race represented by the blood.

This process lasted for a full three hours.

Three hours later, the bloodstains on Eli’s body gradually disappeared.

There was a burst of heat, and the blood in the pool of blood around him quickly evaporated. In the blink of an eye, it disappeared completely, revealing the naked Eli.

He opened his eyes, put on his clothes, and slowly walked out.

“The curse is complete.” Eli looked at his left arm.

There was already a blue blood mark on his forearm.

This was the bloodline curse.

It was the curse of the marine tribe’s blood.

“right now, the damage bonus to the Marine race creatures is almost 0.001%.” Eli pondered his perception.

Since he had made preparations to stay here for a long time, it was inevitable that he would have to fight against the marine tribe in the future. This curse would make his combat power against the sea tribe even stronger, which would also increase his safety.

“I need to experiment!”

Eli shook her head and looked into the distance. He seemed to have sensed the arrival of a group of sea creatures.

He smiled and flew into the sky.

Half an hour later, he saw the sea tribe that had arrived. It was a tribe of murlocs that numbered in the dozens. Eli waved his staff gently, and the waves began to roll.

After a while, the murloc died.

Eli also felt that his curse had a slight improvement.

The damage to the sea tribe had increased by about 0.001%.

..

In the blink of an eye, ten years had passed.

In ten years, Eli’s mental power had increased by about ten points.

Speaking of this, the celestial stage was actually different from the rest. The celestial stage was more about accumulating celestial stars and then allowing the celestial stars to continue to accumulate and then break through.

When the celestial accumulated more than dozens of stars, he would reach the second stage of the celestial stage, the star cluster.

However, the celestial stars were obtained from an increase in mental power, so it naturally required an increase in mental power. Usually, one celestial star would require at least twenty points of mental power to condense.

Of course, Eli also noticed another problem.

...

Due to the difference in his rank, he needed to improve his bloodline at the same time as he improved his mental power. Only when his bloodline reached a certain level could his mental power continue to improve.

This had both advantages and disadvantages.

The advantage was that he would be much stronger than those of the same level, but the disadvantage was that he would need to spend more time.

If it was any other mage, this might not be good news because they did not have enough time. But it was just right for Eli, who did not lack time.

And over the years, Eli had gradually gotten used to life here.

Every year, Aisha would send over a large number of resources and knowledge found in ruins, so even though Eli was here, he was still connected to the outside world.

Meanwhile, Eli was also creating new spells. Of course, the field he was involved in at the moment was still elemental spells. Compared to other fields that he had no personal experience or information on, this field was more suitable for him at the moment.

Eli didn’t have any regrets. He would be going to the central continent sooner or later anyway, so he would talk about those things when the time came.

In the past ten years, there were also deep-sea creatures that came to these waters and caused great destruction. Thanks to this, Eli’s bonus attack damage against the sea tribe had increased by a full 0.05%.

Just when Eli thought that he would be able to upgrade without any interference …

One person’s news surprised him.

...

“Udo is back. He wants to see you, my Lord!”

Eli looked at the information on his crystal ball and narrowed his eyes.

About 200 years ago, in order to become more powerful, Udo headed to the central continent. After that, there had been no news of him. He didn’t expect that Udo would suddenly return and want to see him.

“Bring him to me!”

After hesitating for a moment, Eli decided to meet him.

He was also curious about what he had been through all these years and why he had come back.

..

A day later.

Eli stood on the shore and saw a ship slowly approaching from afar.

The boat was not big. It was a small boat that could only seat a dozen people. Only two people got off the boat. One was Aisha, and the other was an old man.

There was no need to talk about Aisha. As for the old man beside him, he had messy white hair and wore a white Warlock robe. His skin was wrinkled, and his eyes were a little dull. His aura was very weak, only at the level of the first ring.

He looked very unfamiliar, but from the shape of his face and body, he looked like Udo. It seemed like he had been through a lot.

“Lord Herman.”

Udo smiled as he looked at the person waiting on the shore.

“Let’s go and have a chat!” Eli nodded, then said to Aisha, “You wait here!”

Eli turned around and left. Udo followed him while Aisha returned to the ship!

Soon, the two arrived at the Tower on the island.

In a room.

After pouring a cup of tea for Udo, Eli sat on the sofa opposite him.

Udo held his tea and sighed, “I didn’t expect to be able to return to the West Coast in this life.”

“Isn’t that good? You’re home.” Eli smiled.

“Yes, I’m home.” Udo sighed.

“stop sighing. Tell me what you’ve done. How did you end up like this? ” Eli asked.

“Me? that’s a long story.” Udo shook his head.

“Then tell me slowly. We have a lot of time!” Eli said calmly.

“Yes.” Udo nodded. “I don’t know where my Lord wants to start!”

“Let’s start from the day you left the West Coast. Let me hear about the situation in the central continent.” He answered.

“Alright,” he said.

Udo took a sip of tea, put down the teacup, and began his story.

“It was 230 years ago. I left the West Coast with endless longing and headed for the bustling central continent.

“And the tragedy began.”CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m
