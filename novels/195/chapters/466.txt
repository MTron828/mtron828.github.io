467 The Sword Breaks the Cloud Sea, Slash

Thank you readers!

In the forest!

Tuman and Lous strolled towards the grassi land.

The two of them were very calm and didn’t look worried at all. It was as if they didn’t know that they were close to the Grassi Land.

Unlike Tuman, Lous looked like a strong man. He was 2.5 meters tall, and his muscles tightened his warlock robe. He had an arrogant expression.

“Tuman, there’s no need for this. It’s just one Eli. Do the two of us have to come?” Lous casually waved his hand and broke the hundred-meter-tall tree in front of him.

“This Warlock might be more powerful than you think!” Tuman glanced at him.

Although he looked down on Eli, he was still very cautious. After all, he had led the Bloodline Tower to this level in a hundred years. Although he had not personally experienced it, he knew that it was not something that ordinary Warlocks could do. It did not just require combat power!

Therefore, it was not too much to be careful!

“Humph!” Lous shrugged his shoulders indifferently.

Compared to Tuman, his status in Nero’s eyes was slightly lower, but his strength was not inferior at all. He was also at the half-step fifth circle level, so he did not have any respect for Tuman!

“Look at your cowardice. I’ll handle it myself. It just so happens that I haven’t seen blood in a long time. Ever since I was mutated by the lord, I feel very uncomfortable without seeing blood for a day.” Lous smiled!

Tuman was helpless!

Suddenly, the forest in front of them shook, and a figure suddenly came out!

It was Eli!

He was still fully armed, not missing a single piece of magic equipment. He had a mage book in his left hand and a magic staff in his right!

Tuman had seen Eli before, so when he saw the fully armed Ely, he was stunned at first, then his eyes widened.

Were they discovered just like that?

At this moment, Lous, who was standing at the side, did not recognize Eli. He looked at the person who had arrived and revealed a sinister smile. “Just nice, someone actually happened to bump into us. We can drink some fresh blood later!”

Blood?

Hearing the Warlock’s words, Eli raised his eyebrows slightly.

Had the people from the Heart of the Abyss become so abnormal?

It couldn’t be!

Lous walked forward and smiled kindly. “Kid, before you die, I have a question for you. Do you know where Eli is? If you know, maybe I can let you go this time!”

Don’t you recognize me?

Eli was a little surprised. It was obvious that the two of them had traveled there for Eli, but this person actually did not know his face.

Tuman, who was not far away, also covered his face and poked Lous with his hand.

Lous turned around in confusion.

“He’s Eli, our target!” Tuman pointed at Eli, who was not far away.

“You are Eli!”

Lous was also stunned!

He turned his head and looked at the Warlock not far away. He nodded in agreement!

The corner of Lous’ mouth twitched, and his face darkened. He looked at Eli and said, “It’s okay. I just have to kill you!”

“Alright. Give it a try!”

Eli smiled. The man in front of him had the same aura as Giovanni, maybe even a little weaker.

He stretched out his hand, and a shadow suddenly appeared. Endless shadows suddenly gathered within!

At the same time, the statue outside the city in the distance suddenly emitted a light that spanned seven to eight kilometers and descended on Eli!

Blessing of faith!

Shadow Dragon’s Breath!

Lous’ pupils dilated.

“This power.”

How was this possible? And what was that light?

Lous’ eyes widened, and black-red lava armor suddenly appeared around his body. His eyes also turned red!

Tuman, who was standing at the side, also widened his eyes and quickly dodged to the side!

This strength?

‘F * ck, the Charm Mansion is selling fake news. There’s too much fake news!’

But at this moment, the shadow in Eli’s hand had already gathered, so Eli made a small change.

The shadow instantly transformed into a shadow longsword!

“Slash!”

Eli waved it gently! Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

A black shadow flashed across the ground and turned into an arc of sword waves that flew toward Lous.

Lous’ eyes were about to pop out, but in the blink of an eye, he melted into the shadows!

The shadow didn’t stop when it passed by Lous. Instead, it soared into the sky. The sea of clouds in the sky was also split into two. It was a magnificent sight!

As the ground cracked hundreds of meters wide, a huge crack appeared on the ground as if there was a huge earthquake.

When the shadow dissipated, Lous’ figure was still in the same place, but his expression was fixed. Although there were no wounds on his body, his eyes were dull and lifeless. His spirit had already died.

“Looks like my swordsmanship isn’t bad.” Eli smiled, revealing a relaxed smile.

At this moment, with the power of faith, it was very easy for him to beat a half-step fifth circle!

Of course, there was one more thing he did not forget. He looked to the side.

“How is that possible?”

Tuman’s body trembled as he looked at the scene in front of him and Lous, who had died in less than five seconds!

Eli was a liar!

He was definitely stronger than expected!

How could this be the peak of the Radiant Sun? Damn the Charm Mansion!

He was too strong. He was definitely not a match for him… What should he do? Fight, no, if it was a battle, Tuman definitely wouldn’t kill Eli… Then he could only run!

Tuman gritted his teeth and prepared to turn around and escape. However, when he turned around, he saw a red dragon not far away staring at him. Its aura was even stronger than Lous’!

“The Dragon King of the Green Field!” Tuman’s mouth twitched again. This appearance was undoubtedly that dragon king!

But didn’t he go back to Green Field?

Tuman felt like he was about to faint. Everything he had experienced today was a blow to his confidence, making his worldview collapse at any moment!

He also understood how much they had underestimated Eli… No, it was that b * stard. How good was he at hiding his cards!

Of course, the most important thing now was to protect his own life.

He turned to look at Eli again, took a deep breath, and said with a trembling voice, “Ely, we’re actually here to visit you on behalf of the Heart of the Abyss. What are you trying to do by doing this?”

He had the support of Heart of the Abyss. He felt that as long as he mentioned it, it would not be too much!

Elyionly sneered.

“You sneaked into the back mountain of my house, and you’re two half-step fifth circle warlocks at that, and you’re telling me that you’re here to visit?”

There was no doubt that Nero was preparing to get rid of him!

Shaking his head, Eli stretched out his hand again and said to Tuman, “I don’t believe it!”

Tuman was shocked when he saw Eli reaching out his hand. He shouted, “Eli, aren’t you curious about what happened? I can tell you everything!”

“No thanks.” Eli shook his head again.

Compared to the words of a living person, a dead person could let him know more!

In the next second.

Golden light descended, and shadows tore through the sky.

A few seconds later, Eli brought the two corpses back to the grassy ground and called Giovanni.

Giovanni felt that his flame had been extinguished, and he was now in awe of Eli.

This guy was too strong!

This was too f * cking ridiculous!
