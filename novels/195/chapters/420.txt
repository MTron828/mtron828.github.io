421 Second Round

Red Moon Lake!

At this moment, the battle continued!

On the ground, Nikola was fighting a peak Radiant Moon Warlock. Although he had greatly improved by devouring a large number of celestials, he was still far from a peak Radiant Moon Warlock, so he was having a hard time fighting his opponent.

Nikola took a deep breath after dodging the attack again. He stared at the Warlock in front of him, who had a cold expression on his face.

!!

At this moment, the Warlock was looking at him and said sarcastically,” Undead, your strength isn’t bad, but unfortunately, there’s no doubt about this war. Eli will die in the hands of the masters! ”

Hearing this, Nikola just gritted his teeth and didn’t refute.

He looked at the sky and was shocked.

In the sky, Eli, who had transformed into a huge shadow dragon, was still fighting with many Warlocks. His main opponents were three huge eight-armed Naga Demons. The most ferocious of them was Jesse, who had transformed into his bloodline’s true form. He waved his eight arms and attacked at the same time. He could attack Eli once every ten seconds.

The other two Radiant Sun Warlocks also attacked from other directions, dealing damage to Eli.

The rest of the Celestial warlocks were carefully supporting them, and they were even trembling with fear. If they were not careful, they might be killed by Eli. On the contrary, the warlocks who were fighting with them were safer, so most of them did not use their full strength and maintained the battle. Otherwise, with the combat power of the warlocks facing Nikola, he would definitely not have been able to last until now!

The Warlock looked at Nikola with a mocking expression. He liked the feeling of his enemy slowly struggling in despair.

…..

Bang!

The shadow collided with the dark purple light, and the air exploded. Eli was once again separated from the three of them!

” Eli, you’re very strong, but unfortunately, your forces are too weak. I can’t provide you with combat power. ” Jesse looked at Ely and grinned. His eight arms were swinging their weapons!

” Indeed, the Eight-Armed Naga Clan is really strong. They have to rely on all their high-end combat power and dirty tactics to fight against me! ” The huge shadow dragon let out a roar and grinned.

Jesse’s expression darkened. This was also the last thing he wanted to hear!

It looked like they were in a good situation, but no matter what, they couldn’t deny that they had taken a less positive decision. However, Jesse still didn’t regret it. It was only now that the real battle with Eli had begun that he realized how strong this warlock was.

He was ridiculously strong, completely unlike an ordinary Radiant Sun Warlock. If he came alone, he would probably be beaten to death.

“Hmph, history is written by the victors. When we destroy the Bloodline Tower, no one will remember how you died. How long can you last?” Jesse looked at Eli and snorted coldly.

The other two Radiant Suns also looked coldly at the ” evil dragon ” in front of them!

“Then let’s give it a try!” Eli opened his mouth and his eyes shone with dazzling light!

Sure enough, 25% of the strength of one clone was still not enough. If he had two clones, he would not be in such a sorry state. He was at a slight disadvantage now, but fortunately, the other two clones were already on their way!

Of course, he had to hold on until then, but the most important thing now was to deal with those Warlocks below the Radiant Sun level. These Warlocks were too annoying.

Kill the support first in battle!

His thoughts raced, and in the blink of an eye, he had already thought of a solution.

At this moment, Jesse and the other two were enraged by Eli’s words. The three huge eight-armed nagas brandished their weapons and attacked Eli again.

Eli also responded.

He let out a furious roar, and the shadow covered his body like black armor. The dragon wings on his back flapped, and he instantly pounced on Jesse. He grabbed Jesse’s shoulder and then fiercely threw him to the ground in the distance.

Bang!

A huge pit suddenly appeared on the ground. The Shadow Dragon pressed down on the Eight-Armed Naga and tore at its body. Jesse was also shocked. His eight arms grabbed onto Eli’s body, wanting to tear him away.

Facing the resistance, countless shadow tentacles suddenly appeared on the ground and firmly grabbed him, fixing him to the ground, and making him unable to move. However, Jesse still struggled crazily because the shadow dragon in front of him was looking at him coldly, and black energy was already brewing in its mouth!

Looking at this energy, he felt a fatal threat!

Jesse’s eyes enlarged. With a roar, the blood in his body began to burn, and countless black and purple smoke rose. He wanted to burn his bloodline to struggle against the shadow, but the shadow was already corporeal and ready to attack.

“No!”

Jesse roared!

Bang!

In the next second, a black pillar of light cut through the sky like a sword of light, tearing the sea of clouds in the sky into two halves. However, the huge shadow dragon was blasted away, while Jesse slowly stood up, and two other Radiant Sun celestials appeared beside him.

At the critical moment, these two Radiant Sun Warlocks had arrived in time and blasted Eli away!

“That was close!” Jesse cursed.

It was clearly a siege, but they almost encountered unknown danger. Eli was too strong.

“Fortunately, we made it!” The other two Radiant Suns also took a deep breath. Eli’s attack was too sudden. Before they could react, Eli and Jesse had already appeared on the ground!

Fortunately, the two of them could quickly provide support. Even if they encountered a powerful attack, as long as they were not instantly killed, they could last for a few seconds. The other two could quickly provide support.

Such an attack was useless!

Eli should be very clear about this!

So what was Eli’s purpose?

“Not good!” Jesse seemed to have realized something and suddenly raised his head.

Not far away, Eli, who had been blasted away, was sent flying a few miles away. At this moment, he quickly stood up, waving his dragon wings, and a storm swept up, sending his body flying like a cannonball towards the celestials in the sky.

He was not Eli’s target.

Instead, it was those Celestial warlocks who were supporting them!

The three Radiant Sun Warlocks looked at each other and saw the shock in each other’s eyes.

They had been fooled!

In the next second, three large craters suddenly appeared on the ground. They flew towards Eli in the sky, roaring angrily to stop him.

However, it was too late. As they rose from the ground, Eli had already arrived beside the ten celestials. However, they were still seven or eight kilometers away from Eli. They needed a few seconds, but a few seconds was enough for Eli!

...

Meanwhile, the ten celestials were all petrified. Looking at Eli, who was so close to them, they only had one thought in their minds-run.

This was not an opponent they should face!

Eli sneered at these people. In the next second, an invisible time domain was instantly activated!

It had been a long time since he had used this ability that he had obtained after advancing to the celestial realm. With the last advancement, his Time Domain had undergone a huge change. Not only had the Time Multiplication been adjusted five times, but the range had also increased from 100 meters to 1,000 meters.

Although a kilometer was still a short distance for celestials, these Warlocks were coincidentally within this range!

As a result, when all the celestials were ready to flee, they were shocked to find that their movement speed had suddenly slowed down by many times. What was even more shocking was that Eli’s speed had increased.

“What the hell is this?!” A celestial shouted in shock. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“The time here has been changed! ” Another Warlock shouted, but his voice seemed to have slowed down, extremely slow!

The other Warlocks also widened their eyes in shock.

What kind of bloodline was this? His physical strength was so strong that he could control shadows. Now, he could even control time!

The celestials were all in despair. They had some hope, but as the domain expanded, everything was gone!

...

In the next few seconds, Jesse and the other two saw that Eli’s speed had increased by leaps and bounds. In the blink of an eye, Eli reached the celestial and crushed his skull. The celestials that were supposed to run away were now crawling like turtles compared to Eli.

In less than five seconds, all the weaker celestials turned into a bloody mist and lost their lives!

When everything was over, Jesse finally arrived in front of Eli again.

Looking at Jesse, Eli smiled and said, “Time for the second round.”
