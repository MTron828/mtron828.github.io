324 The Reactions of All Parties

“Hiss, the time grain is still quite harmful to people!”

Only after killing Gaido did Eli have the time to feel the time grains.

In just a few seconds, he had lost a few hundred years of his life.

This wasn’t something that even a celestial couldn’t ignore. Of course, to him, it was just a drop in the bucket. He didn’t care at all.

He grabbed Gaido’s hourglass and put the translucent time sand into it. Then, he put it into his ring. This time, he had gained a lot.

After all, the die of fate was just a divination spell. Even Eli couldn’t predict Gaido’s means, but without a doubt, Gaido’s trump card was really strong.

If it was another Warlock, even a radiant moon, they might not dare to say that they would dare to do this. But unfortunately, Gaido had met him, the only immortal of the warlock world.

Wasn’t this a coincidence?

It was simply too coincidental, but this could only be said to be Gaido’s bad luck!

Fate did not favor him at all this time.

Looking at the dead Gaido, Eli’s gaze was complicated.

This was the first time he had truly faced a celestial warlock, but it seemed that they were not as strong as he had imagined. Perhaps this had something to do with his deep accumulation, or perhaps it had something to do with the serious injuries that Faido had once suffered.

But it was no longer that important now.

Because he was still alive while Gaido was already dead.

“His end also means the end of an old era!

“It’s time for a new chapter to be opened on the West Coast!” Eli opened his hands.

It was evening now, and the afterglow of the setting sun shone down on Eli’s face, as well as Gaido, who was lying on the ground. There was a different kind of beauty to it.

In the distance, there was no movement for a long time.

The bold warlocks crossed the area and came to a place not far away, where they also saw this shocking scene.

“Milord won! That celestial is dead!” He opened his mouth wide and sent the message back.

“Milord won!”

“Milord won!”

Soon, the entire bloodline tower knew that the lightning Eagle Warlock from the hourglass had been killed by Sir Herman.

In an instant, the entire bloodline tower fell into a revelry. Everyone was reveling in the joy of surviving a disaster.

“I knew master Herman could do it.”

“Lord Herman is too strong. I knew it. His avatar is so big. Although being big doesn’t mean he’s strong, he’s probably not weak!”

“The celestial of the hourglass is here? He even created such a commotion for three days just to make his death more famous. I’m dying of laughter!”

The warlocks ‘admiration for Eli reached a peak as if they were looking at a God.

In the wizard Tower in the distance.

Aisha’s hands that were holding the curtains also loosened, revealing a relaxed smile.

“Grandmaster, I knew you could do it.”

The celestial had been killed, so it was time for her to do what she had to do.

It was time to add the last area to the bloodline tower’s flag.

..

On the other side, Eli took Gaido’s spatial ring over, the one he was wearing around his neck.

He opened it.

Suddenly, a large pile of things was found.

There were quite a lot of things, but the content disappointed Eli.

“What’s this?” The corners of Eli’s mouth twitched as he looked at the item in the ring.

It wasn’t that there were too many things, it was just that there wasn’t anything that caught his eye. But it seemed normal. Gaido had slept for nearly a thousand years, and he had probably cleaned it up before he slept, so there was nothing.

However, it wasn’t a loss for Eli either. At least he still had the time grain.

This kind of extremely precious material was truly a favorite of his.

He planned to use it as a material to upgrade the scepter to the level of a fourth circle. However, he would have to settle down first.

After finishing the inventory, Eli put away gaido’s body and headed back in the direction of the bloodline tower. The warlocks on the way opened up a path for him, standing on both sides and looking at him silently with admiration!

Eli ignored them and walked on calmly.

Soon, he arrived at the periphery of the bloodline tower. At this moment, the higher-ups of the bloodline tower, led by Aisha, were already waiting. Seeing that Eli had returned, they all bowed to express their gratitude.

“Grandmaster, thank you for everything you’ve done for the bloodline tower!” Aisha said gratefully.

“No, I just want to have a stable environment!” Eli shook his head and said, “I’ll leave the time hourglass to you!”

“Yes!” Aisha said firmly.

“they should have some information about the mage era. That’s very important. Help me get it!” Eli continued.

So what if Gaido was dead? but the time hourglass he left behind was a treasure, at least for Eli. Eli really wanted to see what precious information was inside.

“Alright!” Aisha nodded to show that she understood.

“then you guys go ahead. I’m going back to rest.”

After giving some instructions, Eli walked straight to the wizard Tower. His expression made it look like he was just taking a stroll.

...

Eli’s figure quickly disappeared from the sight of many higher-ups.

Everyone heaved a sigh of relief.

Although Eli was very kind, he had just killed a celestial, after all. This put a lot of pressure on everyone, and they didn’t even dare to look at him directly, even Aisha!

“Grandmaster’s prestige is getting heavier and heavier!” Aisha took a deep breath, then looked at the higher-ups and said, “Everyone, what are you waiting for? let’s go to the meeting.”

Everyone’s eyes lit up.

..

Thanks to the construction of the bloodline tower over the years, they had their own channels of information.

Therefore, after Eli killed Gaido, the news spread like wildfire.

In less than half a day, the entire West Coast had already heard the news that Eli had defeated Gaido, and all the warlocks were in a frenzy.

At this moment, in a city.

The city was located on a plain. The city wall had been broken in half, and countless houses had collapsed in the city. Some places were burning, and there were dead people everywhere. Blood was everywhere.

...

In the ruins, there was time hourglass warlocks.

They were the ones who did it.

The warlocks did not feel much when they saw this. They only felt a sense of carefreeness. This was their territory, to begin with, and everything was returned to them.

Suddenly, a Warlock ran in from outside the city gate.

His expression was panicked and his steps were hurried. He even fell when he entered, and his clothes were stained with blood. However, he didn’t care and just got up.

“Sir Gaido was killed by Herman!” He shouted as he ran.

“Sir Gaido was killed by Herman!”

His voice was very loud, and everyone’s eyes turned to him.

Their eyes were filled with shock. They were not shocked by the Warlock but by what he had said.

Lord Gaido is dead?!

How could that be possible?

A three-circle warlock even grabbed the Sorcerer’s neck and angrily rebuked, “What are you talking about? Do you want to die?” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“Sir, I’m not lying. This is the information from the spies of the time hourglass!” The Warlock struggled, his face was red from the suffocation.

“You’re lying.” The third-circle warlock still didn’t believe it.

Lord Gaido was so powerful, how could Herman have killed him?

The little Warlock in front of him wanted to disrupt the morale of the Army.

He gradually exerted more force in his hand. No one would dare to say anything, even if he killed this kind of Warlock!

The Warlock’s face gradually turned purple as he struggled with his four limbs. Suddenly, a Bell rang throughout the city, and everyone heard it clearly.

The three-circle warlock suddenly turned his head, his face full of shock.

This special sound was only used when a person of importance died!

Could it be?

The strength in his hands gradually decreased, and he let go of the Warlock. The Warlock lay on the ground and breathed in large mouthfuls of air.

The three-circle warlock ignored him and looked into the distance.

Suddenly, a Warlock ran towards him from a distance.

“my Lord, Lord Andrew wants you to go to a meeting!” The Warlock said.

“What happened?” The three-circle warlock asked after taking a deep breath.

“Sir, Sir Gaido is dead!” The Warlock said in a low voice, his eyes filled with pain.

Hearing this, the three-circle warlock felt dizzy.

His body went limp and he fell to the ground.

It was actually true!

The Warlock did not lie to him.

It was all true.
