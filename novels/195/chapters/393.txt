394 Reinforcements, Price

” Damn Brother Eli! ”

Outside the door, Vivika cursed Eli in her heart. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

In fact, she had arrived an hour ago. She had waited for an hour because she had heard a faint sound coming from inside the door.

After Liliana left, she came over from the room beside them, but she was very unhappy.

!!

“She’s just a little sexier and has a better figure than me.” Vivika pursed her lips and mumbled.

Bang!

“What are you mumbling about? Let’s go!” Suddenly, Vivika felt a light knock on her head. She looked up and saw that it was Eli who had appeared out of nowhere.

“Ah, nothing!” Vivika’s eyes widened as she exclaimed!

Eli smiled and ignored her. Instead, he walked out, and Vivika quickly followed.

Soon, the two of them walked out of the valley and arrived at Bloodline City. They walked towards the Warlock Tower in the center.

Along the way, Vivika rambled on, and Eli responded from time to time.

” Brother Ely, there are two Warlocks pursuing me recently. It’s so annoying! ” Vivika suddenly changed the topic.

“Isn’t this good? You can choose,” Eli replied with a smile.

“Humph!” Hearing his indifferent tone, Vivika snorted and said, “But I only like Brother Eli. Why don’t you marry me? ”

“No!”

“Why?”

Bang!

Vivika held her head again and looked up. Eli was already in front of her, so she quickly followed.

She did not mention anything for the rest of the journey because she had asked the same question many times.

Eli walked in front with a calm expression.

It seemed that only the essence of Vivika’s soul had obtained immortality, but there were still some things that would affect the next person who inherited the spirit. Moreover, she had lived by Eli’s side for a long time, so she naturally fell in love with him.

Eli was also very helpless. He would hear similar confessions about a dozen times a year.

Just like that, the two of them arrived in front of the tower.

” Lord Eli, Lord Vivika! ” The Warlock standing in front of the door respectfully opened the door for them.

“I’ll go to the conference room. You can go to the other rooms.” Eli turned to Vivika.

“Okay!”

The two of them walked in. Vivika entered a room while Eli went straight to the third floor.

He pushed open the door and entered the meeting room.

There were more than a dozen people in the meeting room. Glen was sitting in the main seat, and the other higher-ups of the Bloodline Tower were sitting on both sides. Even Dylan and Nikola were sitting in the front. Besides Glen, there were also two celestials, a man and a woman. The man was called Gerry, and the woman was called Lesina. They were wild celestial who had joined the Bloodline Tower over the years!

As for Hydra, it was still lying on the grassy ground.

“My lord!”

Everyone stood up immediately when they saw Eli enter.

Eli nodded and sat down on a chair beside Glen. Everyone then sat down.

“What’s the situation now?” Eli asked directly.

” My lord, the Warlocks of the Akasha Family have already gathered in the northernmost part of the Bloodline Tower, Nightfall City. Our Warlocks are also gathering there. It’s estimated that a war will break out in two weeks at most. ” Glen said from the side.

“How are the preparations going?” Eli asked again.

” The Akasha Family isn’t our neighbor after all, so we still have enough time to prepare. Furthermore, with the support of Sir Dylan and Sir Nikola, I think we’ll surprise the Akasha Family with our basic strength! ” Glen said.

“Oh?” Eli looked at Nikola and Dylan.

“Sir, we provide each Warlock with two special healing potions and a bottle of Critical Health Potion. The former can heal injuries and replenish stamina, while the latter can allow Warlocks to unleash even greater power.” Nikola chuckled.

” Every Warlock’s weapon that goes to the battlefield can be branded with a hard rune for free. Moreover, we’ve prepared many gifts for the Akasha family in Nightfall City. They’ll definitely be surprised. ” Dylan said as he leaned his front legs against his seat.

Ever since he could no longer sense his body, his mentality had gradually changed.

He had a new idea.

As long as the Bloodline Tower became stronger and wider, he would be able to find his own body sooner or later. Therefore, he worked day and night in the Machinery Alchemy Department. He didn’t need to sleep anyway.

“That sounds good.” Eli nodded.

” Sir, we don’t have any problems with the basics. The only thing we’re worried about is the combat strength of the higher-ups. We’re far inferior to them in this regard! ” Glen sighed.

Hearing his words, the others also lowered their heads. The combat strength of the higher-ups was their Achilles’ heel.

Glen seemed to have thought of something and said to Eli, “Oh, right, my lord. The Amina family said that they would send a few celestials, and Conilla of the Golden Cicada Merchant Association also told me that they would send a Radiant Moon Warlock!”

“Oh?” Eli raised his eyebrows in surprise. The others also raised their heads.

“Yes!” Glen nodded. To be honest, he hadn’t expected this either.

After understanding the general situation, Eli stood up and looked at everyone. “Since that’s the case, then everyone should prepare for battle. If necessary, I’ll take action.

“Meeting dismissed!”

Eli immediately announced the end of the meeting.

At this point, there was nothing more to say.

Fight!

...

…..

At this moment.

At the Amina Family.

“Milord, are we really going to reinforce them? Our opponents this time are the Akasha family and a Radiant Sun Warlock!” Simon asked Selona in confusion.

“Of course!” Selona nodded.

Although so many years had passed, the scene of Eli beating the three of them up that day was still vivid in their minds.

He didn’t want to be beaten to death by Eli because of this. Moreover, the ones who had offended the Naga were the Amina family. The Eight-Armed Naga wouldn’t even let the Bloodline Tower off. How could it let them off?

And the most important reason was that he still had to rely on Eli.

He chose to believe in Eli.

” So be it. However, if we do this, the defense of the Green Field will definitely be weakened. Perhaps there will be a problem. ” Simon reminded.

“So be it. It’s not a big problem.”

...

Selona shook his head.

“Alright!”

…..

Golden Cicada Merchant Association!

In the office.

A man with a slender face said mockingly.

“Conilla, do you know what you’re doing? Let me tell you, Lord Hook is very dissatisfied with your actions this time. He wants to report it to the president!”

” I don’t think there’s anything wrong with my actions. The Bloodline Tower has great potential and has brought us great benefits. ” Conilla raised his head and said calmly.

“Hmph, you will bring trouble to your Lord Jin Ji!” The man sneered, then slammed the door and left.

“Haha!” Seeing the man leave, Conilla smiled.

The Golden Cicada Chamber of Commerce’s western region had always been under the charge of two vice ministers. The man just now was the subordinate of the vice minister opposing them.

And the reason why such a despicable person like him had succeeded was that he had finally caught hold of something that could be used against people who hated him.

However, there was a reason for this. Thanks to the Bloodline Tower and the support of Eli’s herbs, Jin Ji’s party expanded rapidly and surpassed the other side by quite a bit. They were very anxious!

“I believe that if Milord is here, he will support my choice!”

In the blink of an eye, 25 years had passed, and Lord Jin Ji was about to return.

He hoped that his lord would not be too surprised.

Of course, the premise was that the Bloodline Tower could withstand the pressure of the Eight-Armed Naga.

“I hope so.”

At the thought of this, Conilla could not help but sigh.

The Eight-Armed Naga was too powerful.
