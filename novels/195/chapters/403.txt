404 The Arrival of Elven Erwin

Two months ago.

Just as Selona and the other Warlocks were heading to Nightfall City to provide support, Erwin, who came from the Elf Clan, finally realized that the defense line in the Green Field seemed to have relaxed.

So she immediately gathered a team and joined forces with several forces to launch a fierce attack on the defensive line in the territory of the Amina Family.

Although they didn’t completely destroy the defense line in this battle, a portion of them had broken through their defense line and entered the territory of the Amina Family to plunder and destroy. This made Selona furious but helpless.

Because when he returned, these races had already escaped from the green fields. Some of them had even fled to the South.

Selona didn’t care that much because further south was the Bloodline Tower. A small part of the Outsiders wouldn’t be able to cause any damage!

The truth was just as Selona had guessed. 99% of the alien races had been eliminated, but there were still some who had successfully broken through.

Erwin was one of them.

—————–

Erwin hid in a forest outside the Grassi Land, carefully using a large number of plants to cover her figure.

She took a deep breath and lowered her head to look at the green leaf in her hand. It was currently emitting a scorching heat, which meant that she was getting closer to the Mother Life Tree.

“Twenty-six years!” Erwin’s gaze was a little deep!

It had been twenty-six years since she left the elven territory. It was not until last year that she found an opportunity.

In the past year, in order to come here, she had almost been caught several times. She had relied on her affinity with plants to escape several times.

“Less than ten kilometers!” Erwin raised his head and looked at the mountain in the distance, and her heart filled with anticipation.

The current elves were just an ordinary race, but she believed that as long as she found the Mother Tree, the elves would sooner or later recover their former glory!

She carefully observed her surroundings for a while before continuing to head toward her destination.

After passing through a few mountains and hiding in the nests of some magical beasts, she soon arrived beside a river in the mountains!

Erwin’s eyes lit up when she saw the river. She hadn’t drunk water for a few days.

After carefully observing for a while, she no longer cared about her elven elegance. She ran towards the river and started drinking.

Through the reflection of the water, she saw her current appearance.

The black leather armor that bound her body had a few more holes. The longbow on her back had disappeared, and there was a short knife at her waist. These were the changes brought about by breaking through the blockade in the past year.

However, although she looked a little disheveled, her long black hair was still smooth. Her fair skin was not dirty at all, and even her leather armor was extremely clean.

The biggest change was that her silver eyes had a hint of determination. She was determined to find the Mother Tree!

“I will definitely find it!” Erwin refilled her body with water, took a deep breath, and left quickly.

Her vigorous body flew through the forest like a white cat!

Soon, she climbed up another mountain and stood on the top. The green leaf in her hand suddenly erupted with unprecedented light and turned in a direction.

Erwin’s eyes lit up.

“Found it!” She looked in the direction that the green leaf was pointing and saw a valley!

The valley was located in the middle of a mountain range, surrounded by thick fog. There seemed to be a human city nearby.

She sensed a lot of powerful auras from inside, so Erwin decided to stay away from them.

” But the fog in this valley doesn’t seem right. Could it be that the Mother Tree created it to protect itself? ” Erwin frowned.

She had thought that she would find the Mother Tree in a hidden place, but the situation now seemed to be different from what she had imagined.

There was actually a city so close to the Mother Tree.

Could it be that the Mother Tree had been controlled by the detestable Warlocks?

Erwin took a deep breath. She was a little confused, but her confusion soon turned into determination.

Since she was already there, there was nothing to hesitate about! Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

After observing the situation, she headed straight for the valley. However, her speed was extremely slow, mainly to avoid being discovered.

Soon, she arrived in front of the fog.

“Lord Mother Tree, bless me!”

Erwin put the green leaf into his pocket, prayed respectfully, and then directly entered the fog.

…..

Three hours later!

When Erwin passed through the fog, she had to admit that she seemed to have lost her way when she saw that the environment had changed.

“Damn it!” Erwin gritted her teeth and took out the leaf, but the green leaf that was originally glowing had already dimmed.

Even the token given by the priest could not penetrate this fog!

Seeing this result, Erwin took a deep breath and put away the green leaf!

” Come on, Erwin. You can definitely get out of here! ” She clenched her right fist and continued moving in another direction.

Three hours later!

Erwin looked at the familiar ground under her feet and fell silent.

She still hadn’t found the right path!

One hour later.

Three hours passed.

…

...

24 hours!

When Erwin returned to the same place after a day of running, she felt her body tremble slightly.

She had to admit that she could not pass through the fog at all.

Not only was she unable to find the Mother Tree, but as time passed, she also discovered that her power seemed to be losing bit by bit. This was also the power of the fog. Perhaps it would not be long before she fell into a deep sleep on this land and lost her life.

“Is this the end?” Erwin took a deep breath, her eyes filled with fatigue.

At this moment, even though she was a third-circle elf, she could not help but feel despair.

She was clearly just a step away from the Mother Tree, but she was unable to pass through the fog, much less find the Mother Tree.

She had disappointed the High Priest.

She bit her pink lips and took out the green leaf given by the priest. In the fog, the green leaf seemed to be just an ordinary leaf without any divine power.

But at this moment, she held the leaf in her hand, then slowly lowered her head and began to pray.

“The all-rounded Mother Tree of Life.

...

“You are the ancestor of all elves and the origin of all life.

“I, the lowly moon elf Erwin, beg you to let me pass through this fog.”

Erwin’s tone was sincere as she prayed.

When she opened her eyes again, she found that the fog in front of her seemed to be dissipating. The thick fog was rapidly disappearing.

Her prayer succeeded?!

“Thank you, Mother Tree! ” Erwin looked at the fog ahead and thanked the Mother Tree sincerely.

But the next moment, the joy on her face suddenly disappeared.

In the fog, a figure slowly approached her, getting closer and closer.

The broad figure seemed to be draped in a robe, and he held a staff, just like the mages in the stories said to them by the priests.

“Is it a warlock?” Erwin felt her breathing quicken. Although she couldn’t see clearly, she could sense that the person in front of her might be even stronger than Lord Priest.

She was in trouble.

Erwin’s body tensed up, and her eyes were serious. She slowly took the short knife in his hand and seemed to be ready to attack!

Finally, a few seconds later, the figure suddenly left the fog. Erwin’s body instantly straightened, and the short knife in his hand was already attacking.

In the next second, she saw a pair of silver eyes, and her consciousness instantly fell into darkness.

“An elf? This is the first time I’ve seen this alien race!”

Eli walked out of the fog and looked down at the unconscious elf in surprise.

At this moment, he also saw that there seemed to be something glowing under the elf’s clothes!

Eli reached his hand in and fumbled around. A few seconds later, he took out a green leaf that was blooming with light!

“A magical green leaf!”

Eli picked it up and felt a little strange. But when he looked behind him, he saw Hill’s huge body coming out of the valley. The light from the green leaves seemed to be directed at Hill. As the fog dissipated, the light became brighter and brighter!

Eli blinked and looked down at the unconscious elf!

It seemed that this wasn’t an elf who had entered this place by accident!

This elf seemed to be related to Hill!

Could Hill be related to the elves?

Eli pondered for a moment but to no avail. Then, he moved his finger, and the elf began to float.

He walked into the valley, and the elf behind him followed him!

He would know when the elf woke up.
