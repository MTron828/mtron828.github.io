326 Civilization

In the blink of an eye, a year had passed.

Thanks to Aisha’s efforts, the remaining people in the hourglass, except for some diehards, had accepted the rule of the bloodline tower and their arrangements.

And everyone who participated in this war was rewarded.

Aisha gave Hydra a large amount of food while giving Nikola the soul crystals she found in the time hourglass. As for the others, they also gained a lot.

Nikola had gained the most because his soul had rotted because he had not been fed for a long time, but after this round of replenishment, the situation was restored.

The other spoils of war were given to other warlocks as rewards.

For a time, the bloodline tower gave birth to many new third-ring warlocks, and its forces grew stronger.

And this year was also the year that Herman’s name was mentioned the most.

Countless statues were erected all over the West Coast, and of course, they were using Herman’s face. Speaking of which, even Eli didn’t know if this counted as fulfilling his friend’s dream.

Herman did want to become famous once.

..

In the secret realm.

In the laboratory.

On the other hand, Eli was conducting a nerve-wracking experiment.

A huge spell formation was imprinted on the ground, radiating light. In the center of the spell formation floated a beautiful staff, and beside it floated the magical time grains.

“Fuse!”

In the quiet laboratory, Eli suddenly said.

In the next second, the spell formation bloomed with light, and the Amethyst on the staff began to fall off and melt. The flowing liquid inside also slowly disappeared, while the time grains slowly floated over, replacing the liquid.

In the blink of an eye, this step was already more than half completed.

A few seconds later, the light of the spell formation gradually extinguished.

The Amethyst at the tip of the staff was flowing with the sand. The semi-transparent time grain was emitting dreamy colors.

The switch was a success!

The next step was to assemble it.

The runes and the branding of the spell formation took another month for Eli.

A month later.

Eli looked at the scepter in his hand and smiled. The scepter had already reached the level of a fourth circle, which was a huge improvement from before.

One of the most important functions was naturally the staff’s most important function, which was to increase the speed of mana condensation and the speed of spell release. In this aspect, with the help of the time grains, the speed of spell release could be increased by half.

One shouldn’t underestimate this speed. For a celestial mage, even a little increase was a huge increase, let alone half. Only a precious time-type item could do that.

Next would be his perception of the elements, which had also been improved to a certain extent.

It was better than nothing!

..

Another two months passed.

He had also finished sorting out all the books from the time hourglass.

Aisha sent all the books to Eli’s tower. There were as many as ten boxes taking up one of Eli’s rooms.

Eli had read through all of them, but he was still a little disappointed. There was very little information about the mage’s age in all of these materials, and only then did he know that the hourglass was previously a warlock force, and there was nothing that Eli needed at all.

This greatly disappointed Eli.

But it wasn’t like he didn’t gain anything.

In this pile of information, he found one of the core and most vicious knowledge of the dark mages that had once dominated the mage world, the knowledge of bloodline Curses!

Bloodline curse!

It originated from the beginning of the mage era and was researched and explored by the first black Mage King. The curse could be cast on specific living creatures and races.

As for effect, as long as the curse was successful, as the mage killed these creatures, he would obtain elemental enhancement. In short, this curse was used for massacres. The more the mage killed the cursed creatures, the stronger he would be.

This was also one of the important methods used by the mages to conquer a foreign land.

Destroyers of civilization, world owners, distributors of fear, and other titles were all important to this knowledge.

“But I can’t use it now. I can’t use it on humans.”

Eli shook his head.

Using a bloodline curse on a human had always been taboo in the Mage world. It was something that was absolutely not allowed to happen. As long as one was discovered, one would be executed regardless of their rank or status. They were all treated the same. Eli did not forget that he was still a mage. If he really used it, he would not be able to survive as a mage. If the mages came back, the first thing they would do was kill him.

Even mages had to follow the rules.

“But I’ll think about it after I learn it.” Eli smiled and started to look at it silently.

A week later, after making sure that the knowledge had been imprinted in his brain, Eli burned all the information. After all, he had such a consciousness, but those warlocks might not.

Don’t underestimate these things.

A warlock could learn the curse and imprint it on the human race. It could be a very dangerous thing and cause a rise of a human tyrant.

Therefore, destroying the book was the best choice.

In a way, Eli could be considered to have saved the world!

“Oh, right, there’s one more thing!”

...

After taking care of these matters, Eli realized that he had forgotten something very important after his advancement.

It was about a great catastrophe.

A long time ago, Nikola told him that it was best not to know about this before he was celestial. Now that he was a true spirit, he should know about it. After all, it was a very important thing.

With that in mind, Eli had no other thoughts and immediately called Nikola.

A day later.

In a room in the secret realm.

Nikola arrived.

“My Lord, is there something you need me for?” Nikola looked at Eli and asked.

“yes, there is indeed something. It’s about the great catastrophe.” Eli nodded. “I remember talking to you once before, but you said that it was best not to know anything before I am a celestial mage. Now that I’m at that level, there shouldn’t be any problems, right? ”

Hiss!

Nikola raised his head and sucked in a cold breath, his face turning serious.

...

He didn’t think that Eli was looking for him to discuss this matter.

“My Lord, what do you want to know about this?” He looked at Eli and asked tentatively.

“all the information you know,” Eli said.

“Alright,” Nikola was obviously in a difficult position, but he still started to narrate, “My Lord, I told you before that the disaster was related to a certain civilization, right?”

“Right!” Eli nodded.

“Actually, I don’t know much either. “After all, I was only third circle at the time. However, my teacher was a celestial, so I know a bit. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“As far as I know, what happened at that time was also very simple. The mage world was going through normal plunder and war with the other worlds. Then, the mages entered an unfamiliar area.

“It was said that it was a deathly silent area, and the entire area was filled with an uneasy feeling, and the entire place was extremely quiet.

“This naturally aroused the mage’s desire to explore, and they explored the inner parts of the civilization. In the end, a terrifying thing happened there, and then led to a series of events.” Nikola said.

“What civilization? ”

“I’m not too sure!”Nikola shook his head. “I only know that it’s a very strange world. It’s said that the world is full of strange curses.

“Of course, these are actually nothing. The most terrifying thing is that the creatures in that world have mastered some kind of power that can pollute the mage’s mental forces.”

“Mind pollution!”

Eli was slightly surprised. He seemed to have understood something!

All of a mage’s power was reliant on his mental power. If it was a race that was good at mind power pollution, then the threat it posed to the mage world was self-evident.

It was like a snail meeting salt.

“What about the great catastrophe?” Eli asked, sitting up straight.

His gaze was serious.

This was what he was most concerned about.
