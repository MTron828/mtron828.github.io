518 Suppressing a Million Warlocks

Anwar’s eyes widened. He could no longer remain calm.

That leaf seemed ordinary, but it gave him an incomparable sense of danger, as if he was about to die. What was worse was that he had seen that leaf before and knew what it meant!

Gulp!

Anwar’s throat trembled, and even his body began to tremble.

“How could it be a Thousand Leaves?” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

He couldn’t believe it. How could Eli be a Thousand Leaves? This didn’t make sense at all!

However, he knew that now was not the time to think about this. He needed to avoid this calamity before he could consider other problems.

In an instant, a large amount of bloodlines and laws were activated. In his bloodline, a blood-colored tree instantly unfolded, and countless branches extended into his limbs and bones. This was the foundation of the Warlock’s fifth circle, the Bloodline Tree!

Weng!

His bloodline shook, and Anwar’s body gradually changed. Fine scales appeared on his body, and his eyes turned into vertical pupils. His body gradually grew larger, and his bloodline gradually turned.

In the blink of an eye, a ten-thousand-meter-long lightning python appeared in the sky and roared at Eli.

On the ground, countless warlocks of the Hamis family were extremely excited.

“My lord has transformed into a bloodline. Are you going to kill Eli here?”

” It should be. Eli is dead!”

“It’s over!”

The Warlocks looked up at the sky and saw that the Lightning Python’s body was gradually turning blood-red. Blood-red lightning condensed on its pure white horn.

Seeing this, the eyes of the Celestial Warlocks and above flickered.

“Is that possible? Daren has started to burn his bloodline!”

“Is it fake?”

What else could that bloody aura be other than burning his bloodline?

But was it necessary?

Not far away, the three Germinal Warlocks were also stunned, as if they did not understand what had happened. They had never seen Anwar like this before.

In the sky.

“Eli, you lied to everyone!” Anwar loudly reprimanded.

Not far away, Eli was still calm as he waved his hand gently.

At this moment, the leaf of the Law of Shadow that was flying in the air suddenly changed. It gradually grew larger and turned into a huge leaf that was ten thousand meters wide. It appeared above the python.

“What is this?”

Countless people raised their heads to look at this sudden change, and their gazes changed.

The eyes of the three Germinal Warlocks flickered. It was only now that they felt the power contained within. This power far surpassed theirs, even Sir Anwar.

Azak’s eyes trembled, and he silently took a few steps back!

“Don’t even think about it, Eli!”

In the sky, the lightning python that Anwar had transformed into was entwined with a blood aura. A bolt of lightning was completely activated and flew directly towards the huge leaf of law in the sky.

“Suppress!”

Eli was still calm. The leaf slowly fell!

Bang!

The lightning collided with the leaf of law. In an instant, the lightning was devoured by the shadow. Only the shadow rippled. Other than that, there were no other changes.

“How is that possible?” Anwar roared with widened vertical pupils.

As he looked at the Law Leaf that was getting closer and closer, he was shocked and afraid.

“Don’t even think about it!”

He immediately turned around and was about to fly into the distance. The Warlocks on the ground gasped when they saw this scene. The Thousand Leaves Warlock Anwar was actually trying to escape?

In the blink of an eye, Anwar had flown 10,000 meters away, but the leaf of law didn’t let him go. It was still in the air above him, and then it pressed down on him.

Bang!

The shadow was like a giant hand that directly covered the python and then fell to the ground. Everyone only heard an extremely tragic wail, followed by the earth trembling.

The hearts of countless Warlocks were pounding as they looked at the ten-thousand-meter crater in the distance. A Shadow Leaf was pressing down on it, and the giant lightning python’s head was shaking like a dead snake, but it had already lost its life.

“Dead!”

“The leader of the Hamis family died just like that?”

“Is the war over just like that?”

Even the Warlocks of the Bloodline Tower, who firmly believed in Eli, were stunned. The main thing was that the scene in front of them was beyond their knowledge!

The Hamis family’s Warlocks further away were dead silent.

“Thousand Leaves!”

A few Germinal Warlocks said in a trembling voice. Now, they finally knew what their master was afraid of. Their enemy, Eli, was not the Germinal Warlock but a powerful Thousand Leaves Warlock.

The celestials looked at each other as if they were saying that things shouldn’t have developed like this!

But no matter what, they understood that this war might end there.

After all, it was obvious from the reaction of the three Germinal Warlocks in front of them. The three patriarchs were probably not in the mood to fight with Eli. They were already scared out of their wits.

In the distance.

Alida’s eyes widened as she looked at Eli. Her eyes were flickering. It was obvious that this was not what she had expected.

“He died just like that?” She was a little stunned. She couldn’t believe that the leader of a top bloodline family would die so quickly.

On the other hand, Vivika was much calmer. She even asked Eli, “Brother Eli, what should we do with the remaining five rings and so many Warlocks?”

“Don’t be anxious!”

Eli smiled, and the Tree of Law shook again. A Time Law Leaf appeared, and the surrounding space flickered. Time seemed to have changed a lot. This time, it was the Time Attribute.

He threw it!

The Leaf of Law flew in the opposite direction. Its target was the Germinal Warlocks in the distance. When they saw the Leaf of Law flying toward them, they were shocked and immediately fled into the distance.

The leaf chased after them, they fled, they had nowhere to run!

The invisible power of time enveloped the few of them, and the few of them who were flying aged at a rapid speed. Their skin began to loosen, and their eyes gradually lost their light. In the end, they turned into white bones and fell to the ground.

Seeing the change in their expressions, the celestials who were preparing to take the opportunity to escape also stopped.

On the ground, the leaves of the Law of Shadow turned into a shadow wave that was hundreds of meters tall and flew toward the Warlock army. After a wave, all the Warlocks were entangled by the shadow snakes and fell to the ground.

Just like that, in the blink of an eye, the army of the Hamis family was completely annihilated!

Meanwhile, Eli commanded Hydra to fly forward and arrive in front of the celestial.

However, he did not pay attention to the other Warlocks and only looked at the back.

Many Warlocks tactfully made way for him, revealing the person at the back.

Eli looked at the man with a smile in his eyes and nodded. “Lord Azak, the head of the Hamis family, it’s been a long time since we met!”

Azak looked at Eli, and his body collapsed to the ground.

Looking at Eli, his face was pale, and he said miserably, “Eli, I admit defeat this time!

“You win!”
