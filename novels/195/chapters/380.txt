381 The Initial Expansion of the Bloodline Tower

A day later.

Morning!

Before daybreak, the residents in the Bloodline Tower had heard a loud noise. They struggled to get up from their beds and looked outside.

At this moment, on the main road leading out of the city, Warlocks were crowding around each other. It was unknown how many of them there were. They wore Warlock leather armor and held weapons in their hands. They walked out of the city like a sea of people.

“A war is about to break out!”

On the highest Warlock Tower, Alida watched everything calmly.

The Bloodline Tower had been peaceful for hundreds of years, and this was the first time it initiated a war against an enemy.

The world was really unpredictable!

“I hope it goes well!”

Alina narrowed her eyes and returned to the Warlock Tower. She was going to be busy.

…..

New Calendar Year 4587.

The Bloodline Tower’s west coast branch tower supported the main tower and defeated the manticore led by Jalin.

Three months later.

The Manticore had 11 Warlocks led by Jerre, and they had attacked the Bloodline Tower.

After a long and difficult battle, Eli won the battle with the support of the Amina Family.

Later in the same month, the Bloodline Tower led a large number of Warlocks to attack the Manticore Family. With the help of the Undead Nikola and the pet Hydra, they quickly broke through the territory of the Manticore Family and occupied the various forces under them.

In just half a month, they had conquered the Manticore Family and killed and captured more than ten thousand Warlocks. The rest of the Warlocks were temporarily placed into the Bloodline Tower to be integrated and ideologically developed.

Another three months.

The forces under the Manticore Family had also chosen to join the Bloodline Tower. From then on, the Manticore Family officially disappeared from the Western Region. At the same time, the Bloodline Tower had entered the ranks of a Level 3 force.

…..

“Ah, the Manticore Clan has been occupied by the Bloodline Tower, and I’ve become a Warlock who has to take the blame.”

In the temple of the Amina Family, Selona looked depressed.

That day, it was clearly Eli who killed Jerre’s party alone, but somehow the news said that the Amina family had helped Eli greatly.

“Then, my lord, what should we do? What should we do if the Eight-Armed Naga clan blames us?” At this moment, there were other celestials of the Amina family in the hall.

Selona fell silent for a few seconds before he said gloomily, “There’s no way. It shouldn’t be that bad, right?”

” But to the public, we’re the superiors of the Bloodline Tower! ” A Warlock reminded him.

Salona fell silent.

It seemed like he really had to take the blame.

As for discussing this matter with Eli, he didn’t think he had the courage.

After more than ten seconds, he spoke again, “Regarding this matter, although we might be seen as responsible, the main culprit is still the Bloodline Tower. They are the main bearers of the pressure. I believe that Eli will solve this problem! ”

The others nodded. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Perhaps Eli could really solve this problem.

…

Bloodline Tower.

“Sir, the news has been spread, but it will take some time,” Glen said to Eli.

Eli nodded.

” Sir Eli, we’ve gained quite a lot from this war. I don’t know what you’re interested in, so I’ve compiled a list. ” Glen took out a list and handed it to Eli.

Eli took it over. He was also interested in what he had gained this time.

He opened the list. He skipped through all kinds of Warlock resources.

The Manticore family was a warlock family, so most of the resources were warlock resources. Most of the resources were useless, but there were some things that made Eli’s eyes light up.

“Glen, tell me about this Poison Fruit Tree, the mage relic, and the technique of the Nine Levels of Violent Blood,” Eli asked Glen.

Glen nodded. This list was organized by him, so he was naturally familiar with each one.

“Sir, this Poison Fruit is a fruit tree found in the center of the Manticore Bloodline base. It is said that it is watered with Manticore Poison every day. Then, every 30 years, a batch of fruits will grow. It can increase the resistance to poison. Even a celestial Warlock can use it. It is one of the highest resources of the Manticore Family.” Glen explained.

“There’s also this Magus Spell. It seems to be a magic tool left behind from the Mage Era. It’s of a very high grade and should be a fifth-circle magic tool. It’s a decoration of the Manticore Clan. It’s placed on Jerre’s bookshelf as decoration. One can imprint spells into it in advance and use them later. There didn’t seem to be many records about this.

“Is my lord interested in this?”

“Yes.” Eli nodded. He was more than interested!

This was a fifth-circle magic tool!

Even during the Mage Era, it would still be quite precious.

However, it was actually used as a decoration by Jerre. It had to be said that it was a bit of a waste.

Fortunately, he had rescued it.

“Then I’ll get it for you later.” Glen nodded.

” Also, this secret technique. Tell me about it, I’m very interested. ” Eli continued.

“Okay, but I think it’s better for you to give up on this secret technique. It’s not good.” Glen frowned.

...

??

Ely looked at Glen and raised his eyebrows.

“Sir, this secret technique has flaws. I’ve also marked it on the list. You’ve seen it too.” Glen sighed and then explained, “This is an incomplete bloodline secret technique. I don’t know which Warlock created it, but there might be some problems in the process, which is why it became like this!

“There are a total of nine levels to the secret technique, which can double the power of a warlock’s attack. In other words, if one stacks the technique nine times, one can make one’s attack nine times more powerful. However, as a price, it consumes a huge amount of life force. Each level requires at least ten years, and the stronger the attack, the more it consumes. If a warlock really uses all the levels, he’ll lose at least a hundred years of life force!

“That’s why no one uses this secret technique, even in the Manticore Clan. The price is too high. ” Glen sighed.

“Indeed.” Eli nodded in agreement and added, “Then hurry up and bring it to me.”

“Alright … What?” Glen nodded, and in the next second, he looked at Eli with his mouth wide open.

He already made it sound so serious, and Eli still wanted more?!

Glen’s expression was strange because he seemed to vaguely see Eli’s eyes shining.

It was like a lost traveler who had finally found his way home.

“Alright, but I suggest that you just take a look. This secret technique is still too dangerous.” Glen reminded. He didn’t want Eli to die young.

...

“Don’t worry. Am I that rash to you?”

Eli assured him.

“I cherish my life very much!”
