520 Two Letters

Just like in the past, there were mountains of resources. However, this time, most of the resources were beyond the third circle, except for the knowledge type.

“Sir, these are the resources we have gathered this time!” Alida said respectfully.

“Yes. Is there anything else?”

Eli nodded. He couldn’t wait to take stock of these resources. However, he also understood that there was something else that Alida had to do since she had come personally.

“Yes, there are two more things!” Alida nodded.

“Then let’s talk in the room first!” Eli waved his hand, and all the resources were swept away by the shadow. Then, he walked towards the mage tower. Alida took a look and quickly followed.

Soon, the two of them arrived at the room and sat down!

“Tell me,” Eli said.

Alida began to say, “Sir, the current situation is like this. Our army has already occupied two-thirds of the Hamis clan’s territory, while the other one-third is divided among the Warlock Alliance’s clans. They haven’t made any further moves yet. Of course, I’m not here to talk about this, but about the letters from the various factions in the Central Mainland!”

A letter from another faction? What were they doing?

Eli didn’t interrupt Alda and continued to listen.

“This includes the Sea Dragon and Sea Shark families of the Southern Region, the Wind God family of the Northern Region, and various small families of the Northern Region. These families sent letters at almost the same time, and the contents of the letters were surprisingly consistent!”

“Oh?” Eli narrowed his eyes.

” Sir, they hope that you can lead the way and form an alliance. They are also willing to join you and advance and retreat together, as well as help you fight against the Warlock Alliance,” Alida said after taking a deep breath.

“Forming an alliance?”

Eli’s brows furrowed as he quickly thought about it.

After a few minutes, he looked up at Alida and said slowly, “This suggestion is not good!”

“Does Milord want to reject it?”

“Yes!”

Eli nodded.

Fighting against the Warlock Alliance together was naturally a good thing, but it would be troublesome if he had to take the lead. After all, in most stories, the leaders did not have a good ending, and Eli did not want to be involved in such a troublesome matter.

“No!” But this time, Eli shook his head.

Alida: “??”

Eli looked up and said,” The alliance naturally has to be established!”

“Ah?” Alida’s mouth was wide open. Why did he change his mind again?

“But I’m not the one who’s going to establish it. It’s you!” Eli pointed at Alida.

“Me?” Alida was even more confused as she pointed at herself.

“Yes.” Eli nodded.” I’m just the Honorary Master of the Bloodline Tower. I don’t have the authority to do so. This is something that you, the true Master of the Bloodline Tower, should do. Don’t you agree, Alida?”

Alida was speechless.

‘Sir, do you want to hear what you’re saying?

‘If you don’t have the right, then what am I doing here? Sir, isn’t it too obvious that you want to shift the responsibility? You’re not hiding it at all!’

“It’s settled then. I’ll leave this matter to you. You’re good at managing forces!” Eli smiled at her as if he had high hopes for her.

The corner of Alida’s mouth twitched. In the end, she nodded and said with difficulty, “Okay!”

What else could she do?

“Is there anything else?” Eli asked again.

At this moment, Alida was still immersed in the confusion of becoming the leader of the alliance. She was pulled back to reality by Eli’s words. She coughed and said, “There’s one more thing. It’s still a letter, but it’s from the Warlock Union.”

“What do you mean?” asked Eli.

“Sir, I haven’t seen it yet.” Alida shook her head, then took out a letter and handed it to Eli.

Taking the letter, Eli tore it open and read it.

A few seconds later, he clicked his tongue in wonder.

“Sir, what did the Warlock Alliance say?” Alida asked curiously.

“They invited me to Heaven City. They said that they wanted us to join the Warlock Alliance. They were even willing to give us all of the Hamis family’s shares and compensate us!!” Eli concluded.

“Ah, my lord, you must not go to Heaven City. This is clearly their conspiracy!” Alida stood up and tried to dissuade him.

“Sit down. Do you think I’m that kind of reckless person?” Eli smiled.

Hearing this, Alida sat down and relaxed a lot.

Indeed, in her impression, Eli was still very cautious.

However, at this moment, Eli lowered his head and looked at the letter again. His eyes narrowed slightly!

He would not naively believe the contents of the letter.

After all, according to the current situation, they were a threat to the Warlock Alliance. In the eyes of the Warlock Alliance, they were even more of a threat than the Lich Tower. They were targets that had to be eliminated. There was an irreconcilable conflict.

They were enemies!

Of course, he would go to Heaven City, but not now!

..

Soon, Alida left and started to deal with the Alliance!

A spark had already started to ignite, and a flame that affected the entire continent was burning fiercely.

After a few hours of organizing, Eli had also finished organizing his gains.

In the Wizard Tower.

Eli looked down at the five items in his hands.

A wizard book, two crystals, one white, one green, and a bottle with green liquid flowing inside.

The wizard book was a notebook of a fifth-circle mage. Although it was ordinary, it was a timely help to Eli. After all, ever since he had advanced, he had relied on information from the past. Some details were not clear, but the arrival of this mage book made up for it.

Mastering the contents inside would allow Eli to have a stronger grasp of his own strength.

As for the two crystals, the white one was called the Sea Soul Tide. It could only be formed by condensing countless dead souls in the turbulence of time and space and then condensing them for ten thousand years under the tempering of the power of time and space. It could greatly improve the degree of spiritual power. Of course, it had another meaning to him, which was to provide it for the silver eye to absorb.

Eli estimated that one should be enough for the Silver Eye to reach the peak of the fifth circle.

The green one was a sixth-circle creature’s Core. It was not very useful to Eli, but if Hydra used it, it should be enough to advance to the fifth circle.

The green liquid was similar. It was condensed from a high concentration of life force and was at the peak of the fifth circle. The bottle was a piece of spatial equipment, so the liquid inside should be as big as a small lake. It should be enough for Hill to advance to the fourth ring.

“Although the gains seem ordinary, they are what I need the most.”

Eli pursed his lips.

Needless to say, the Warlock Book and the Sea Soul Tide could help the Bloodline Tower gain an additional fifth-circle combat power. In the future, they wouldn’t have to do everything for it. As well as allowing Hill to advance, the Blood Bamboo Flower could naturally advance as well. This was a change that involved the law of devouring.

Thinking of this, Eli walked out of the wizard tower.

First, he threw the Wind Elemental Core to Hydra, and then he threw the bottle to Hill. He ignored the ecstatic emotions of both of them and returned to the Tower.

He wanted to continue studying the rules of the Shadow.

..

Advancement required time.

A day later.

Hydra swallowed the Core, and then a large number of elements wrapped around it, turning it into a huge egg and beginning its path of advancement.

Three days later. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Hill absorbed the bottle power’s life force liquid and began to level up. During this process, her life force was rapidly depleting. In almost half an hour, she turned into a withered tree as if she had reached the end of her life.

But Eli knew from the elves that this was normal.

As long as Hill survived the withering, she would successfully advance to the fourth circle, which would usually last for more than a year.

Eli was waiting patiently.

A month later.

In the past 17 years, the Sea Soul Tide had completely integrated into the Silver Eye. The Silver Eye had also reached the peak of the fifth ring and even had a new ability.

Mercury Blade!

He could store his mental strength in advance and condense the Mercury Blade. He could store two of them in advance, and the power of the Mercury Blade was one level higher than his current level. Its power was shocking.

This was already a very good skill, not to mention that it was stored in advance.

And, of course, the training of the Laws of Shadow had also reached the final stage.

At this moment, there were a total of six leaves on Eli’s Rule Tree. There were three leaves for each of the two rules, which was a little more than before. However, he was still far from advancing to Thousand Leaves.

Because Thousand Leaves’ advancement really required at least 1,000 law leaves!

The road to advancement was still a long way to go.

Of course, this was only one of the reasons why Eli had woken up!

Instead, after a month of hard work, Alida had already organized the initial stages of the alliance.

They also invited all the forces to Bloodline City in three days.

An alliance meeting was to be held.
