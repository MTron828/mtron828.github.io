477 Starting a War

” What?! ”

A cry of surprise suddenly came from the tower. Alida could not help but take a few steps back and look at Eli in front of her.

Just like before, Eli’s expression did not change at all. However, this time, his tone was firm as he expressed his thoughts.

But declaring war?

Alida was a little shocked, but there was also a hint of excitement in her eyes.

Ever since decades ago, the power of the Heart of the Abyss had grown stronger and stronger. There had been hundreds of conflicts with them if not thousands, but every time they came, they chose to endure and not resist.

Even the outside world gradually thought of Eli as a weak and cowardly Warlock.

However, only she knew why Eli was doing this.

Although he was cautious, he was always resolute, determined, and confident. No matter what threat he faced, he would never be afraid. At least, in the past, it was Eli who crushed the arrival of powerful enemies every time.

Without Eli, there would be nothing for her and nothing for the Bloodline Tower.

Naturally, she was a strong supporter of Eli. Facing the slander of the outside world, she felt very uncomfortable. After all, no one liked their idol to be scolded every day.

Therefore, when Eli said that they would destroy the Heart of the Abyss, Alida’s heart was filled with complicated emotions. She was both melancholic and excited. She was melancholic because the Heart of the Abyss was too strong, but she was excited because her lord had pulled himself together.

“Sir, although I also want to destroy the Heart of the Abyss, from the looks of it, the high-end combat strength of the Heart of the Abyss is too terrifying. Will this …” Alida hesitated.

“Trust me.”

Eli looked at Alida and said calmly.

Sensing Eli’s gaze, Alida’s body trembled.

“Good!”

“Go and make the arrangements. Take out the war reserves that you have accumulated for hundreds of years. There are also war airships. Ever since they were refined, they have not been used. There are also other war magic tools and magic potions.

“It was time for the Heart of the Abyss to experience what a true ” ancient war ” was!

“Within a week, I want to see a Bloodline Tower that is ready for war.” Eli smiled.

“Yes, sir!”

She had seen those war magic tools before and knew how powerful they were.

It was probably going to be a landslide victory.

..

After Alida left.

Eli left the Grassi Land and entered the vast mountain range behind him.

He wasn’t just wandering around in boredom. He just wanted to test the Blood Celestial Body.

Soon, he arrived at the deepest part of the mountain range. There were no humans here.

“This is it.”

Eli looked around and activated his bloodline avatar and celestial Body.

The illusory celestial Body and bloodline avatar appeared behind Eli at the same time.

The two figures quickly merged. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

The huge dragon wings spread out, casting darkness on the ground.

The bloodline body gradually disappeared, and the celestial body gradually became focused. Black scales gradually appeared, and the transparent celestial body was gradually filled with shadows. The eyes turned into pure gold like a shadow dragon.

Boom!

The air was torn apart, and the elements wreaked havoc around the Blood Celestial Body like a storm!

Although the celestial body that had fused with the bloodline avatar was less than 200 meters long, it was still several times stronger than before.

“So strong!”

Eli felt his power at this moment. It was an unprecedented feeling.

“Let’s test it.”

Eli reached out slightly, and the Blood Celestial Body behind him also raised his hand.

A faint firefly-like light lit up in his hand.

He didn’t dare to do too much for the test.

In the next second, the light flew towards a mountain that was 100 meters tall in the distance.

There was no explosion, no earth-shaking movement.

However, when a speck of light landed on the mountain peak, the entire mountain seemed to be wiped away by force. The shadow instantly swallowed it and disappeared from the ground. A huge pit that was hundreds of meters wide even appeared on the ground!

Hiss!

Seeing this scene, Eli sucked in a breath of cold air.

This is f * cking ridiculous!

He felt that he had barely used any strength!

“If we were to talk about bloodline avatar alone, their combat power should be at least three and a half Tumans. Then, with the support of the world’s will, I should be as powerful as at least fifty Tumans!” Eli assessed himself and was even more shocked.

The main reason was that the leap was too big, so big that he was a little dumbfounded.

Of course, the World Will’s blessing played an important role. Even if it didn’t, 25 times was still a very terrifying number. This wasn’t something that a fourth-circle mage should have.

“No, this is the result of my hard work!”

Eli smiled and returned to the grassy ground.

It was guaranteed!

After Eli left, a few kilometers away, a half-step fifth circle Mountain Demon Bear crawled out of the ground and looked at the terrifying marks in the distance.

Just now, it sensed a human entering. It was supposed to kill the human, but just the aura the human emitted made it feel extremely afraid. Then, what happened next?

“Is this a f * cking human? Or is it because I haven’t been out for a few years and the Warlock has already become like this?

“Is it five rings?” The Mountain Demon Bear felt its bloodline freeze.

Fortunately, it was fast.

“No, I can’t stay here anymore. I have to stay away from here.”

The half-step fifth circle Demonic Bear staggered and ran deeper into the mountain range.

The earth shook.

..

Time passed.

Eli was in the tower, trying to comprehend his power, but the others were all moving quickly.

The Bloodline Tower, Alida, began to gather the Warlocks and secretly prepared all the resources in the airship. Nikola went to the territory of the Green Field Dragons and began to deliver the orders of Eli to the Dragon King, Giovanni. Even the clone of Eli of the elves awakened again, and Erwin began to summon the high-end combat forces of various elf races.

He had his own theory about fighting.

That was to use the strong to bully the weak, to use the many to fight the few.

So this time, Eli mobilized everyone.

It didn’t matter if he could use it or not, but he had to be prepared first.

Even Liliana, Jin Ji, and the leaders of the other small forces, including Eli, began to gather for a secret meeting.

Since they were going to fight, Eli decided to go all out.

It was really unpleasant to have a demon by his side.

This time, Eli chose to take the initiative to attack.

Normally, he wouldn’t take the initiative because he wanted stability. But this time, it was different. It was the same for stability, but this time, he would first solve the problem that might be unstable and solve the problem from the source.

Eli was ready.

And there was another important goal, which was to rip off Nero’s skull.

He had endured for so many years.

He was really unhappy!
