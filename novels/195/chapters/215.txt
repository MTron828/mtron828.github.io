“My Lord, you have to save me!”

In the Tower, Nikola held onto Eli’s calf, his face full of grief.

“You’re saying that after Mason died, a wisp of Kloss’ soul appeared and left a mark on you before disappearing?”

Eli looked at Nikola, who was crying, with a strange expression.

‘What the hell is this!’

“That’s right, my Lord. You don’t know how vicious Kloss’s tone was just now. He couldn’t wait to come and kill me. I’m only at the limit of my second-circle, my Lord, you have to save me!” Nikola said with an aggrieved expression.

He was the one who got beaten up, and he was also the one who took the blame. Was there still any f * cking justice in this world? Is there any morality in this?

“Hey, relax!”

Eli sensed Nikola’s body, and sure enough, in the depths of Nikola’s mind, there were two mind power imprints, as if they had been carved into his mind.

One of them was Eli’s, and the other was dark black, which should be Kloss’.

And what surprised him was that the two imprints seemed to be connected. Upon contact with the imprints, he could vaguely sense Kloss’ aura.

“This …”

This was something that Eli did not expect. The brand of contact seemed to be one, intertwining within Nikola’s soul, and could not be separated.

This gave Eli a bad feeling because the brand was actually equivalent to soul perception, which could allow Kloss to sense Nikola’s position, but because they were stuck together, once Kloss came into direct contact with the brand, it would also expose Eli’s position.

At first, he thought that it had nothing to do with him. In fact, he had no intention of fighting Kloss head-on. After all, they were on the same level. However, with the imprint, everything became very troublesome.

Moreover, it was impossible to kill Nikola because the imprint involved mind power. Once Nikola died, the imprint would return to Kloss’ side, and at that time, it would tell him about Eli. This would not only expose his and Nikola’s identity, but if Kloss had a special method, he might be able to find his location from this aura.

“My Lord, what if Kloss comes?” Nikola was still prattling on and on and did not notice that Eli’s face was slowly turning dark.

Ten minutes later, he suddenly heard Eli’s call.

“Nikola.”

Nikola raised his head and saw Eli’s serious face.

“You’re my subordinate, so I’ll definitely be responsible for you. As long as we get rid of Kloss, all our problems will be solved.”

Nikola’s eyes widened as he listened to what Eli said. His brain was instantly filled with emotions, causing the way he looked at Eli to change again.

He knew all too well how cautious his master was usually. Once the risk was too high, he would definitely give up. He even felt that he would be abandoned this time, but his master had actually chosen the risky path of killing Kloss.

“My Lord …”

In an instant, Nikola was moved to tears, and he looked at Eli with admiration.

Eli was speechless.

He didn’t want to. It was too risky if he didn’t kill Kloss.

If not for this, he would definitely hide and wait until he could easily crush locks or torture him to death before revealing himself. However, this sudden soul imprint caught him off guard.

However, how to kill Kloss was another problem.

Kloss was in the middle stage of the third-circle, and his combat power might not be any lower than that of Eli’s, so he had to think of a foolproof plan. Be it the battlefield layout or other things, he had to be cautious.

Of course, he had his advantages too. First of all, he was in the dark, while Kloss was in the light. He still didn’t know about Eli’s strength.

Secondly, he still had a wisp of Kloss’ soul aura. He could cast a curse before or during the battle to weaken his strength, which would make the battle easier.

Eli also had more people.

Since he was going to fight, he would naturally make use of all the power he could rely on, whether it was himself, Nikola, or even Vivika.

At this time, Vivika’s bloodline tower was in the final stage of the battle with black Isotta and could not hold on much longer. It was definitely a good choice to join forces with Vivika, who was a third-circle warlock.

This time, Eli might really have to meet his beloved disciple.

It was a meeting that had been delayed for more than four hundred years, and for some reason, Eli was looking forward to it.

Of course, in addition to Vivika, they might also have another potential third-circle mage, and that was Nikola.

With that in mind, Eli looked down at Nikola and said, “Kloss is very strong. We have to use all of our power. Nikola, you can break through to the third circle now. I know you’ve already collected the souls for the breakthrough.”

Nikola, “…”

He raised his head and looked at Eli with his eyes wide open as if he was asking how he knew. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“As long as it’s not too much, I usually have too many restrictions on my subordinates. I’ve long known that you’ve been secretly collecting souls.” Eli said calmly.

Nikola was different from him. He used to be a third-circle mage, so he only needed enough souls to break through to the third circle. Moreover, his soul core was still in Eli’s hands, so Eli had always let him be.

He understood that it was impossible to control a subordinate in all aspects.

“I’m sorry, my Lord. I was wrong.” After knowing that his actions had already been known, Nikola revealed a regretful expression.

“It’s okay. You break through to the third circle first. I’ll first block your Soul brand. Then we’ll set off. You’ll find Vivika and work together. I’ll set up the venue and lure locks out. Then, we’ll work together to kill him. Let’s go, ” Eli said.

“Yes, yes. I’ll do it right away, my Lord,” Nikola nodded his head, understanding that he had caused trouble this time.

“mm, you go on ahead. I’ll go to the White Tower to get the materials.”

Some scenes needed materials to be set up, so he had to go back to the White Tower to get them. After discussing with Nikola, he quickly left the Forest of Death.

Time was tight.

Nikola also flew toward the altar in the distance. He had dug out a large number of soul crystals from the bottom of the altar. There were hundreds of thousands of them, and he had hidden them all.

Unlike Eli, he was a third-circle mage in the past, so it only took three days for Nikola to return to his third circle, accompanied by the shattering of countless soul crystals.

“I’m finally back at the third circle!”

“Haha!” Nikola said as he flew into the sky from the altar and released his huge soul power, tearing countless dead spirits into pieces.

...

After a few hundred years, he had finally returned to third circle.

At the same time, a figure flew over. It was Eli who had already finished collecting the materials.

When he saw that Eli had arrived, his arrogant aura instantly dissipated. He flew to Eli’s side and fawned, “My Lord, I’ve already broken through.”

“Then let’s go to the central region!” Said Eli as he cast a glance at him.

Even though his fighting strength was still average in Eli’s eyes, Nikola was still a third-circle mage.

“Yes!” Nikola replied. He knew very well that his combat strength was still too weak in front of his Lord. After all, his Lord was too abnormal. He had just broken through and was already at the middle to late stage of the third circle. How could he compare to him?

“then I’ll shield your Soul brand for a while,” Eli said.

Although he couldn’t directly remove the brand, Eli could easily silence the brand. The process only took a few minutes.

After all of this was settled, Eli glanced at Nikola and said, “Let’s go to the bloodline tower first.”

“Yes, my lord.”

In the Forest of Death, Eli and Nikola left silently, while the remaining undead all fell into a state of silence.
