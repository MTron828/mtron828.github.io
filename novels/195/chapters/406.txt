407 Elven Priest Tears

Under the moonlight.

A silver aircraft flew across the sky and headed north.

In the aircraft, Eli’s doppelganger was sitting in the front with Erwin behind her. However, at this moment, she was looking at the figure in front of her and the aircraft as she took a deep breath.

This flying device was very fast, and it was engraved with complicated spell formations. No warlock could make it!

The person in front of him was actually a Mage, a Mage from the outside world.

Even though they were already on the path back to the green fields, she still felt that everything was so surreal.

An hour ago.

After talking to Eli, she knew Eli’s identity. He was a Radiant Sun mage from the Mage Alliance. He had returned this time to prepare for the return of the mages, to carry out preliminary modifications, and to manage some slave races.

In fact, she didn’t believe it at first, but when he showed her the transformation of the Bloodline Tower and other methods, she soon believed it completely.

Therefore, she decided to bring Eli to the territory of the Green Field Elves!

“My lord, the green fields are just north of here. But before that, we have to pass through a warlock force. My lord, you have to be careful.” Erwin reminded.

“There’s no need to worry about that.” Eli replied, turning to Erwin and asking, “Tell me about Green Field. I’m not too sure about the situation there. ”

“Yes, sir.” Erwin nodded and said, “The Green Field used to be a no man’s land during the Mage Era. However, after the Magi left, dozens of foreign races entered this area. This area is also very large, almost as big as two Western Regions.

“This area is roughly divided into three levels. One is the core area, where the strongest races live. Further out is the inner area. The races there are slightly weaker than the races in the core area, but they are still very powerful. The area near the western region is the outer area. The other races live here, and the elf race is there!”

The Western Regions were two big countries! 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Eli was also a little surprised. He really didn’t know!

However, his expression immediately became strange. He looked at Erwin and asked, “Is the elf race that weak? They actually live in the outermost layer!”

Erwin explained awkwardly, “My lord, the elves were mainly responsible for logistics during the mage era. Of course, we used to be in the inner area, but after the elves split into different groups due to a lack of faith and unity, we had to move to the outer area. ”

“Alright then.” Eli nodded and asked, ” How strong are the Green Field races? ”

“Most of the alien races in the outer region only have a few Radiant Moons. The inner region might be a little stronger, and some might have fighting power on the level of the Radiant Sun. I don’t know about the core region, but there shouldn’t be any fighting power above the fifth circle. Otherwise, this place would have been unified long ago!” Erwin replied.

“Yes.” Eli nodded.

If that were the case, then the green fields would not be too dangerous to him. Instead, this place would be a huge treasure trove for him!

This place could make him stronger. Perhaps this place could even become the strength that supported him to continue moving forward.

Many of the foreign races there were once part of the logistics of the Mages World. If he could subdue these intelligent races and then have them serve him, this might be a huge opportunity for Eli.

These foreign races had helped the mages conquer countless worlds. It was terrifying just to think that they would all be working for Eli alone.

Furthermore, Eli had the Bloodline Tower as a cover. This would allow the resources in Eli’s hands to rapidly expand, and he might even become a monopoly power in the Warlock World!

Hiss!

Even Ely couldn’t help but feel excited when he thought of this result.

Perhaps the structure of the system that Eli had envisioned to serve him might not take so much time to build.

“Sir, there seems to be someone blocking the way ahead!” Erwin’s nervous voice pulled him back to reality.

Eli looked ahead. Through the aircraft’s screen, a celestial seemed to be blocking the way. It was a familiar person, Simon.

” Stop. This is the territory of the Amina Family. No one is allowed to fly here. ” Simon shouted loudly. He looked at the flying device in front of him, and the aura of a celestial spread out.

He wanted to see which Warlock dared to behave atrociously in their territory.

At this time, the aircraft slowly came to a stop. The huge shield on the top opened, revealing the impatient Eli and Erwin hiding behind him.

“I need to go to Green Field. When the time comes, tell your people not to stop me!” Eli said quickly.

In the next second, the shield closed again, and the aircraft flew past him without stopping.

Simon took a deep breath and wiped the cold sweat off his forehead.

How the f * ck was it Lord Eli?!

He immediately took out a communicator. This was sponsored by the Bloodline Tower.

“There will be an aircraft passing by in a while. Everyone, do not stop it!”

“But the family head said that flying magical beasts or even aircraft is not allowed in the territory of the Amina Family! ” A voice came from the communication device. It was another celestial of the Amina family!

” That’s Sir Eli! ” Simon replied calmly.

In the next second, the communicator fell into a long silence, followed by a series of panicked voices.

“Got it!”

Simon put away his communicator silently. He was glad that he didn’t say anything overboard just now.

It was a blessing in disguise.

…..

On the other side.

After getting Simon’s warning, the road ahead was naturally smooth.

No one dared to stop him.

Erwin witnessed all of this and was even more in awe of Eli.

” Sir, we’ve reached the outermost area of the green field! ” Erwin said.

“Yes!” Eli nodded and looked outside.

At this moment, behind the aircraft was a huge wall that stretched for more than ten kilometers. In front of it was an endless forest. Eli could sense the figures of many foreign races in the forest below. These were the foreign races that the Amina Family had fought over the years!

...

However, at this moment, the aircraft was several thousand meters high, so these creatures did not notice it.

“Erwin, lead the way!” Eli turned to Erwin and said.

“Yes, sir.” Erwin judged an area and then pointed forward, “That way.”

In the next second, the aircraft flew in the opposite direction and quickly disappeared from the sight of the Amina family.

At the same time, Selona received Simon’s message from the guardian of the Amina Family.

“The lord went to the green fields? Why?” There was some doubt in Selona’s eyes.

However, after thinking for a few seconds, he ignored it.

Where Eli went had nothing to do with him!

As a lackey, one had to have an awareness of a lackey.

…

On the other side.

...

After flying for dozens of kilometers in the green fields, Eli and Erwin finally arrived at their destination.

” Sir, this is the territory of the moon elves! ” Erwin said respectfully.

Their journey wasn’t that smooth. They even encountered a fourth-circle alien creature, but Eli only released his aura, and the alien creature immediately fled.

Eli looked down as well. The ground was still a large forest, but in the middle of the forest, there was an area where the trees were even taller. There was an even larger tree in the middle, and Eli could sense the auras of many creatures, including a four-circle Radiant Moon creature.

The aircraft slowly shut down, and Eli brought Erwin directly to the center!

Bang!

The two landed in front of a huge tree, making a soft sound.

At this moment, the nearby elves also noticed the two of them and quickly gathered. In the blink of an eye, hundreds of elves had gathered. On the trees and on the ground, some of them were holding weapons, while some were looking at Eli solemnly.

Eli also took a look and realized that most of the elves here had silver hair and silver eyes. These were the characteristics of the moon elves. There were almost no ugly elves in this race. The men were handsome, and the women were beautiful.

Being surrounded, Eli did not say anything. He just waited calmly. Erwin, who was behind him, adjusted her breathing.

Sure enough, a few seconds later, there was a sudden commotion in one direction, and the elves scattered to the two sides.

An elderly elven priest slowly walked out, looked at Eli, and asked seriously, “I wonder why this lord has come to the territory of our elf race!”

At this moment, Erwin ran to the priest’s side and whispered into her ears.

A few seconds later, Erwin stood up, but the elven priest looked at Ely with tears streaming down her face. She said excitedly, “Sir, I knew you would come back.”

Looking at this scene, Eli felt awkward, but his expression remained the same. He looked at the Elven Priest and said sincerely,

“We’re back!

“Sorry for the wait!”
