236 Silver Moon Lake

The blue sky was dotted with clouds.

A few birds were frolicking in the air, making a series of crisp sounds.

All of a sudden, a whooshing sound was heard, and all the birds immediately scattered. Behind the clouds, an airship slowly moved out, like a small mountain.

The flying bird looked at the strange thing curiously. A flame came out from the back of the airship, and a huge wave of air spread out, pushing it forward. All the birds scattered in fear.

“The airship is accelerating!”

At this moment, at the front of the airship, Eli looked at the scattering birds in front of him and turned back.

This was the core area of the airship, equivalent to the first-class cabin of an aircraft. There were not many people here at the moment, only Eli, Vivika, and Aisha.

“Teacher, we should be able to arrive in a few days!”

Vivika said as she looked at the returning Eli.

Eli sat on a chair and picked up the fine wine beside him.

“Teacher, are you going to the ruins this time?” Vivika asked curiously. In her opinion, the ruins should be attractive enough for her teacher.

“I’m not going!” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

But Eli shook his head. What a joke.

If the ruins were real, they would have to mobilize the entire third circle forces of the West Coast. Although he was strong, he wasn’t confident that he could get it under everyone’s eyes. Moreover, if a Big Shot from the central continent came, he would be even more helpless.

Not to mention this, even if they encountered some unexpected factors in the ruins, wouldn’t it be a bad thing?

Thus, his goal this time was very simple, and that was to buy a formula that could allow him to break through. He would break through to the middle third-circle stage first, and then think about the rest when the time came.

Vivika was a little regretful.

His teacher was so powerful. If he joined them, he would definitely be of great help to them, but his teacher didn’t seem to be interested in these things.

“Alright then!”

“Oh, that’s right. Grandmaster, that Warlock called Kami was stripped of not only his qualifications but also his tickets and all his earnings. However, isn’t it too much to lock him up for five years? ” Aisha seemed to have thought of something, and she suddenly looked at Eli.

“It’s fine! Scalpers deserve that,” Replied Eli with a smile.

Today, he suddenly remembered an experience of wanting to buy a ticket in his previous life. The existence of scalpers caused him not to be able to buy a ticket. At that time, he swore that he would definitely mess with them.

“Scalper? What’s that?” Aisha’s big eyes were filled with confusion.

“Hahaha, an annoying person.” Eli laughed loudly, looked at the two of them, and said, “There’s still a lot of time. Do you want to play a small game?”

“What game?” Vivika and Aisha were curious.

Eli chuckled!

“Fight the landlord!”

..

In fact, “fight the landlord” was also attractive to people from the other world.

A day later, in the same room, there were three people.

Eli was all smiles, Vivika took a deep breath, and Aisha was on the verge of tears.

Aisha took a deep breath and watched as Eli kept the chips again. She felt her heart tremble. Oh my God, what did she do in just one day?

She had lost almost 5000 magic stones in one day. It was too painful.

But …

Aisha looked at her teacher beside her. Although Vivika looked calm, she looked down at her teacher’s hand, which was holding her clothes tightly, and felt a little better.

His teacher had lost even more, more than 10000 magic crystals.

Could it only be said that the Grandmaster was too strong?

Aisha looked at Grandmaster and saw that Eli seemed to be ready to continue dealing, and her heart trembled.

Suddenly, there was a knock on the door.

Aisha’s eyes brightened, and she immediately ran over to open the door. A second circle Warlock walked in.

“Lady Vivika, Master Herman, we’ve arrived!”

Hearing this, Aisha’s body relaxed as if she had found a Savior. Not far away, Vivika bit her lips, still thinking why she couldn’t win!

I’m so unwilling!

“We’ve finally arrived!” Eli stood up, revealing a relaxed smile.

A day passed by so quickly. It had been a long time since he had been so carefree.

He walked to the front, where there was a small terrace.

Aisha was also ready to follow, but Vivika suddenly stopped her.

“Aisha, next time, remember that the commoners are one group and the nobles are another!” Vivika looked at her with a serious expression.

“Ah!”

Aisha blinked her eyes. It seemed that her teacher was still hung up on the game.

Indeed, it didn’t matter if it was money or not. Losing all the time really made one doubt one’s own intelligence.

..

Outside the balcony, Eli stood there.

“Is this the silver Moon Lake?”

...

Eli looked down. Before him was a huge flat area with a wide Lake in the center. It was like a huge dewdrop, extremely beautiful.

It was said that a lot of fish lived in the silver Moon Lake, and there was no lack of high-level fish, even precious fish in the second circle. It was a territory occupied by several forces, and it was also the origin of the name of the silver Moon meeting.

At this time, many people had already arrived around silver Moon Lake. The buildings that had once been left behind had formed a small town, and all the forces had basically arrived.

Whoosh!

Suddenly, a gust of wind blew, and Eli looked over.

In the distant sky, a huge sky cloud whale slowly glided through the sea of clouds and slowly floated down to the ground. Its huge body was like the falling sun.

“The heart of the darkness’s sky cloud whale!”

Having learned about a few organizations, Eli quickly determined that this organization should be the core organization of this meeting, the heart of the darkness. However, using the sky cloud whale as a means of movement was indeed heroics.

One had to know that this was a third-circle creature.

As the cloud whale landed, the airship that Eli was on also slowly landed.

The wind elements in the surroundings decreased bit by bit, and Eli was getting closer and closer to the ground. The buildings on the ground were also becoming clearer and clearer. Eli also slowly removed his protection and walked inside.

...

“Teacher, let’s go!”

After entering, Vivika said to Eli with a smile on her face.

The two of them walked towards the entrance of the cabin. Behind them, Aisha stuck out her tongue. Her teacher’s recovery ability was really fast!

Ten seconds later!

Bang! Bang!

The airship finally landed, and the hatch slowly opened.

Eli and Vivika looked at each other, then strode out.

“This is a small town!”

At this moment, Eli was in a public square. It was the small town that he had seen earlier. Looking at the warlocks in the first and second circles, Eli smiled.

“This must be the bloodline tower!” A passerby looked at them.

“Yes.”

After confirming it for a moment, everyone did not care too much.

Although the bloodline tower was also a part of the West Coast treaty, it was a relatively weak party.

Soon, as Eli and Vivika came out, the people in the airship also came out one by one, waiting for Vivika’s orders.

“Lord Vivika, we’ve been waiting for you for a long time!” At this moment, a fat man suddenly ran out of the crowd. He was wearing a loose coat and had a flattering look on his face.

“Sir, I’m Khalsa, the person in charge here.” The fatty introduced himself to Vivika, then looked at Eli and asked, “Who is this Lord?”

“Herman!”

“So it’s the Vice tower master!” Fatty’s eyes lit up. As a receptionist, it was basic knowledge to know all the higher-ups.

“The place to rest has been prepared. I’ll bring you there now.” Said Khalsa.

“Sure!” Vivika nodded, and so did Eli.

Soon, the group was brought to a huge five-story building, and the people of the bloodline tower entered one after another. Vivika and Eli also had their own rooms, and they were the best.

After everything was settled, Eli bid Vivika goodbye and left. He didn’t forget his purpose.

He left the building.

Eli began to stroll around the entire town.

As a Warlock town that had been developed due to the conference and Silvermoon Lake, there were basically no mortals here. Therefore, the things here were all necessary for warlocks.

He strolled along and soon reached the commercial district.

“Let’s hope there’s something to be gained here.” Eli looked forward.

At this time, there were the most people here. Warlocks set up stalls on both sides, and further away, there were Chambers of Commerce and even more powerful forces.

However, the largest one was the building at the end of the hall.

Compared to the other three-story buildings, this five-story building stood out in the commercial district. Its area was almost five or six times larger than the other buildings. The outer walls were basically golden, which made it look a bit luxurious and a bit tacky.

However, the most eye-catching thing was the Golden Toad sculpture outside the central building.

“Golden Cicada Chamber of Commerce!”

Eli’s eyes lit up. This was the place he was looking for.
