531 Am I The Villain?

“Come!”

The sound waves set off layers of airwaves along with the shadows. The aura of the shadows seemed to cover the sky with a thin veil. The expressions of the Warlocks from the Warlock Alliance changed.

“This aura, how is it possible?”

“Eli is much stronger than expected. It seems that this battle is not that simple!”

“How could this be?”

Everyone was a little hesitant. Clearly, this was not what they had thought before.

“Everyone, it’s not our turn to hesitate now!” At this moment, the Warlock of the Dylo family, who was the leader, looked at the crowd and said calmly,” If we don’t get rid of him today, it will be our doomsday!”

“Yes!”

“Indeed!”

Everyone nodded.

To be able to grow to their current level, they had to have experienced at least one to two thousand years. Their willpower was naturally very firm. Therefore, after judging the situation, their gazes became firm.

For the sake of their family, they had no other choice, even if it meant their lives!

“Eli, you are very strong individually, but we have more than ten Warlocks here today. You will die here today!” Warlock from Dylo looked at Eli.

“Then let’s try!”

A rumbling sound came from Eli’s mouth as he looked at the crowd.

In the next instant!

The ten of them transformed and activated their bloodline true avatar!

Weng!

In the sky, ten figures that blotted out the sun slowly appeared.

Other than the Prais Family’s Blazing Angel Bloodline, the Yunge Family’s World Destroying Wind Crystal Butterfly Family, the Dylor Family’s Divine Tree Bloodline, the Sella Family’s Titan Bloodline, and the York Family’s Golden Dragon-Lion Bloodline.

They all had sixth-circle bloodlines, and each figure was thousands of meters tall.

The divine tree covered the sky and covered the sun, with thousands of tentacles hanging down. The huge Titan was almost 10,000 meters tall, even longer than Eli’s body. There was also the Golden Dragon-Lion, whose golden mane swayed in the wind, and its muscles emitted a golden luster!

Even Eli couldn’t help but feel shocked when he saw this scene!

It could be said that with the appearance of these figures, the ground was already gloomy. All the Warlocks were not thinking about who would win but whether they could survive the aftermath.

However, it was obvious that the old coots from the Warlock Alliance did not consider this.

The moment they completed their bloodline transformation, they rushed toward Eli.

“Eli, I’ll help you stop those two Thousand Leaves Warlocks. The rest is up to you!” Phoenix appeared out of nowhere and flew toward the two Thousand Leaves Warlocks in a flash, launching an attack.

This shocked them because they knew that they had introduced the Phoenix King into the Warlock World. They did not expect that Eli did not kill him but subdued him!

Seeing the two Thousand Leaves being dragged into the sky, the Dylo family Warlock shouted, “Continue attacking!”

Then, the eight figures flew toward Eli without any further obstruction.

Roar!

Eli flew out and headed straight for the Golden Dragon Lion. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Thrust!

A shadow flashed past, and its sharp claws grabbed the Golden Dragon-lion, tearing it apart!

Roar

The Dragon Lion Warlock let out a mournful wail, but he did not care about his injuries. He turned around and grabbed Eli, and countless manes wrapped around Eli!

“I caught him. Everyone, go!” He shouted loudly!

Even Eli didn’t expect the Warlock to be so decisive.

The rest of the Warlocks were even more delighted. They turned around and attacked Eli.

Dozens of attacks instantly came at Eli. Vines, flames that could burn everything, Titan’s giant hammer that seemed to be able to destroy the world, storms, and Golden Breath that flowed like gold!

Boom!

The sky was torn apart.

The Warlocks on the ground could only see countless rays of light entering their eyes like rainbows. The space in the sky turned into pieces, and dark purple spatial turbulence instantly erupted.

With just a joint attack, the space was torn apart by an unknown amount.

‘So, is Eli still here?’

Many Warlocks looked toward the center of the attack, but they did not see him.

Could it be that he had been beaten into ashes?

Countless Warlocks were stunned. At this moment, a tearing sound entered everyone’s ears.

Looking up, Eli’s voice suddenly sounded from an unknown distance. In his hand was the corpse of a Golden Dragon-Lion that had been torn into two halves. It was slowly turning into a human corpse.

Whoosh!

Eli took a deep breath and looked down at the Golden Dragon-Lion in his hand.

Hmmp!

Was this person crazy? A divine tree stage warlock actually died just like that?!

However, when he lowered his head and looked into the eyes of the dead Warlock in his hand, it was a determined and crazy gaze. This made him seem to understand something!

He raised his head and looked at the Warlocks in the distance. Their eyes were similar.

“Do you already have the resolve to sacrifice yourselves for your families?”

Eli grinned and looked at these old Warlocks. Almost all of them were nearing their deadline!

“Attack!” The Warlock from the Dylo family shouted again, his eyes flashing with anger.

The battle was about to start again.

Shadow Dragon Breath, Fire, Storm…Countless powers began to wreak havoc in the sky, and Eli’s figure flickered as he fought with the many behemoths!

The sounds of battle made all the Warlocks’ ears tingle. The dissipation of the laws made the Warlocks on the ground dodge frantically. Countless Warlocks were killed just by being touched!

It could be said that every time there was a battle in the sky, a large number of Warlocks would die because of it. The celestial Warlocks took up the responsibility of protecting the Warlocks, but even so, there were many times when they would accidentally die in the aftermath of the battle, which was why more and more Warlocks fled.
