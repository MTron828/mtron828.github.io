313 Fishing

Soon, Eli returned to the bloodline tower silently.

No one even noticed his return.

It was not until Aisha learned about what happened in the South of the West Coast, as well as the undead and the huge three-headed snake that those people described, that she came to find him.

“Grandmaster, is that person you?” Aisha asked in confusion.

“Yes. It was me!” Eli nodded.

Judging from Nikola’s and Hydra’s figures, it should not be particularly difficult for her to figure out it was related to Eli. However, Eli still hoped to hide it as much as possible. After all, no one knew, and a celestial might pop out from nowhere!

He had to be careful!

“Alright, Grandmaster!” Aisha nodded respectfully, but her mouth moved as if she wanted to ask something!

“I’ve already broken through that level. Keep it a secret!” Naturally, Eli knew what Aisha wanted to ask, so he didn’t hide it.

Aisha’s eyes widened when she heard Eli’s reply.

She was stunned for a few seconds before she said in a panic, ” alright, Grandmaster. I won’t leak it out.”

Grandmaster had really broken through to the celestial realm!

This news was too shocking!

Even after Aisha left, she still felt dizzy.

On the other hand, Eli shook his head. To him, the most important thing at the moment was to sense the changes in his body and master them.

..

In the blink of an eye, a month had passed.

This month, Eli finally understood everything about his latest improvement.

He could easily take on a hundred third circle warlocks, and it would be even easier if he used his celestial body or bloodline avatar.

Speaking of which, this was something that Eli had only discovered this month.

He seemed to have both mage and warlock abilities.

This could only be tested in a battle.

Secondly, his Silver Eye had also advanced to the level of a celestial warlock. Now, his control over illusions and mental power was even better. He could even permanently change or implant some people’s memories.

It was scary, and even Eli didn’t want to use it too much.

In the end, he discovered that, following the changes in the mysterious light pillar that day, he seemed to have faintly sensed that something was brewing in the light pillar. It seemed to be some kind of power.

Eli didn’t quite understand, but he felt that it was a good thing.

Actually, there was nothing else. Advancing to celestial was more of a fundamental change, and it didn’t affect other aspects of Eli. After all, how could his knowledge level increase with his advancement?

Therefore, he still had a lot of problems.

Although he had gotten the method to advance from Jin Ji, he didn’t have any other information. He lacked celestial-level spells and methods!

However, there was no other way.

There was no comparison between celestial-level spells and those below. There were a few celestial spells but each spell was not simple. Some celestial mages might only rely on their celestial bodies.

However, if Eli wanted to find out, there was a way.

That was to go to the central continent, where there would definitely be a lot of resources.

But how could Eli leave? he had just leveled up, and he was prepared to level himself up to the point where he couldn’t level up anymore before he could leave this place. That would take a very, very long time.

He was only a new celestial mage at the moment, and he was still too weak!

After the celestial realm, there were three more layers.

The radiant stars, the radiant moon, and the radiant sun.

Each stage was divided into three small stages. The first stage was divided into micro star, cluster star, and Nebula. He was currently in the micro star stage.

His stage was like a small star, emitting a faint light. When it could spread to dozens of units and become as bright as the stars, that would be the next stage.

However, Eli estimated that it would probably take a long time.

He didn’t know how long it would take.

However, he didn’t care. He could just endure it slowly. Anyway, even if he had to endure until the end of time, he didn’t panic at all. As long as no one came to kill him, safety first.

“Let’s develop in the West for now.”

Eli felt that there must be many powerful beings on the central continent, so what was he going there for? to rise up again? he might as well stay here and grow up.

Time was on his side.

Of course, he also had to stick to his principles and not fight with people of the same level!

“but I still need a real battle. Otherwise, it’s still hard for me to estimate my own strength.” Eli frowned.

After all, his perception alone was not so reliable. It would be much better if he had a standard, but there were not many forces on the west coast that could test his strength.

The hourglass of time was one of them. They had a true celestial figure, and this Eli knew about it a long time ago. However, how could he rashly barge into the territory of a celestial, even if he was already asleep?

As long as there was a 1% chance of not being able to defeat the opponent, the consequences could be serious.

A single misstep would result in death.

This single misstep could cost him a billion years of suffering, and it was not worth it.

He had even used dice during this period of time. Although there was a 15 – 16 chance of winning, he still felt that it was too dangerous. It was just a test, so there was no need to.

The only one left was the Wanderer Alliance.

Not only did this force damage the bloodline tower’s development and maintenance, but it was also made up of mostly evil people and not many good people.

Most importantly, they were very powerful and had many half-step celestial warlocks. The only bad thing was that they had been quite well-behaved recently.

Eli was also a little embarrassed to exterminate them directly. That was a little unreasonable!

“I’m still too kind.” Eli let out a long sigh.

However, based on their development model, it was only a matter of time before they invaded the bloodline tower. It wouldn’t be too late to take action then.

This was called entrapment.

And he was sure that this fish would take the bait.

..

As expected.

A year later.

Aisha came to report the recent situation to Eli.

In the room, Eli was sitting behind the table while Alice stood and reported, “Grandmaster, half a month ago, there were some suspicious warlocks in the bloodline tower. We suspected that they were from the Wanderer’s Alliance. In the end, we caught several spies, and they were really from the Wanderer’s Alliance.ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“They’re preparing to attack us. Ten days ago, they sent out several teams to invade the bloodline tower from various angles. It seems to be a test led by three half-step celestial warlocks!

“But that’s not all. The bloodline tower lost several resource points within a week, and a few third-circle warlocks died. This has caused us some trouble.”

After the report, Aisha was ready to leave.

This was because she had also come back to report to him every other year, and he didn’t react at all. He only asked her to make her own arrangements. There shouldn’t be any changes this time either.

But this time.

As she finished her report, she saw a bright light in the Grandmaster’s eyes. He slammed his hand on the table with a bang and said angrily, “a small wandering force actually dares to be so bold. I’ve given them face. I must teach them a lesson!”

Aisha was dumbfounded.

Aisha was dumbfounded by Eli’s huge reaction.

‘Grandmaster, you weren’t like this in the past.’

“My Lord, you don’t need to do this,” Aisha said.

“Yes, I have to. They’re too arrogant.” Eli shook his head as if he was really angry.

Aisha was still in a daze at first, but when she heard that Eli was going to take action personally, she felt a surge of joy in her heart. Others might not know, but she knew that her Grandmaster had already advanced to celestial. It shouldn’t be a big problem to destroy the wanderer’s alliance!

She also understood that her Grandmaster had probably wanted to make a move long ago.

She didn’t know how they had offended the Grandmaster!

But that wasn’t important.

As a celestial, how long would it take for Eli to destroy a force with at least six half-step celestial warlocks?

She was also very curious about how strong a celestial was.

It seemed that she could feel it this time!
