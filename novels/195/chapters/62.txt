63 Aria in Action

Perhaps it was still early, but when Eli returned to his room, scholar Clement was not there.

Eli went straight into the room and began to observe the seed.

The seed was dark green in color, and there were green patterns all over it. Life force was slowly being emitted from within, and even Eli could feel the wood elements around him being slightly mobilized.

Everything was telling him that this was no ordinary item.

In fact, Eli wasn’t even sure if it was a seed.

After all, he did not know what level the seed was at that it could still unconsciously attract elements and even emit a life force that surprised even him.

” Oh? ” Eli’s interest was piqued.

He had just become a wizard, but he had never seen such a strange item.

He immediately used spiritual power detection, vitality detection, the eye of information, and elemental composition.

The result surprised him. It was really a seed, and the test told him that with a certain amount of incubator liquid and enough time, it should be able to germinate.

As for what kind of seed it was, he really couldn’t tell.

“Looks like I’ll have to leave some space in my courtyard.” Eli shook his head and kept the seed.

Whether it was a tree, a grass, or a flower, he would know after he planted it.

…

At the same time.

In Marquis Alina’s room, ten people sat in a circle in silence.

They were all high-ranking officials who were on this tour. There were nobles, Grand scholars, diplomats, and even Grand Knights.

“Cough cough!” in the end, it was still marquis Alina who spoke. He calmly glanced at the room and said, “Are you guys giving up just like that?”

“Lord Marquis, but Queen Cynthia doesn’t have any intention of negotiating. We haven’t made any substantial progress at all.” A noble with a white unicorn coat of arms hesitated for a moment before speaking.

“Indeed,” beside him, scholar colt nodded.

“Lord Marquis, I think the king must have thought of this. He has been dealing with the Lorraine Kingdom for so many years. Don’t you know her well?”

“Indeed, there’s no breakthrough at all. Queen Cynthia, on the other hand, is a perfume fanatic. Unfortunately, the Empire doesn’t have any top-notch perfumes in this area, so we can’t attract the Queen’s attention.” Another person shook his head.

“So we’re giving up, are we?” Marquis Alina was also a little angry. He slapped the table and said, ” the king naturally knows about this, but he still sent us here. What does this mean? He needs us to succeed!

“Think about the consequences of failure.”

Marquis Alina squinted at the crowd, causing them to feel an invisible pressure.

Even the Grand Knights found it hard to breathe. It wasn’t the knight’s suppression but the aura that made everyone nervous.

“But the Queen doesn’t seem to want to see us. I’m afraid we won’t even be able to enter the door next time.” Grand scholar Colt sighed with a worried expression.

Everyone was silent for a moment.

“We’ll visit again in five days.” A few seconds later, Marquis Alina made his decision. The others could only agree and leave one by one.

Half a minute later, Marquis Alina was the only one left in the room.

Looking at the silent room, Marquis Alina sighed.

“I hope the next time, it won’t be too miserable!”

…

Compared to the worried side of the Bryne Empire …

On the other side, Aria was much more active.

After getting Eli’s money, he first went to the mercenary association and hired a few elite knights to protect his personal safety. then, he began to secretly contact a few people in the association who supported him and asked them to make early preparations.

He also began to actively contact the connections his father had left him and began to create a protective net for himself.

In fact, as the son of the original owner of the trade association, Aria was not a good-for-nothing either. It was just that this time, it was too sudden, so he was caught off guard.

He had already laid out a plan but considering he had no solution. He decided to lay low. It was why he was so excited when he received Eli’s deal in the carriage that day.

He had found the way to victory, but he lost himself too.

However, he had already let it go. Even though he didn’t know what kind of technique Eli had used, he had resigned himself to his fate after experiencing those five seconds of pain.

So be it if he was bound to Eli.

At the very least, he still retained a certain degree of freedom. In fact, if he were to obtain the Chamber of Commerce in the future, he would also be able to enjoy the benefits of the Chamber of Commerce. He just needed to dedicate himself to Eli without any reservations.

Just like what Eli said, after he died, wouldn’t it be like nothing had happened?

However, that would take a long time.

By the time his son or grandson was born, it would be impossible for him to still be alive. When that time came, the Chamber of Commerce would still belong to the Kazan family and not to Eli.

After everything was prepared, Aria finally decided to deal his uncle a fatal blow. This was the final and most crucial step of his plan to obtain Queen Cynthia’s support.

Five days later, Aria specially chose an exquisite perfume bottle and brought the perfume that eli gave him into the palace.

As it was the palace, Aria was the only one who entered.

He was wearing a black shirt and black pants today. His face and hair had also been carefully groomed. After all, he was meeting the Queen and could not be sloppy.

It was only because she heard that Aria had top-grade perfume and respect for Kazan Senior that Queen Cynthia decided to meet him. Otherwise, he wouldn’t even be able to see the Queen.

Aria followed the guard and walked through the palace.

It was also here that Aria finally understood how rich the kingdom was.

The steps were made of white marble, and the corridors were engraved with embosses made of gold and silver powder. Gemstones worth dozens of gold tars could be seen everywhere. It was truly extravagant.

‘No wonder the Queen doesn’t care about the Chamber of Commerce at all.’ Aria’s throat moved slightly, and his respect for the Queen increased.

Soon, they passed through another long corridor, and Aria was led to a room.

“Please wait here. Her Majesty the Queen will be here soon.”

The guard said calmly and then stood by the door.

Aria looked into the room. It was just an ordinary room. It was not as luxurious as the hall outside, but Aria’s mouth was wide open when he saw the scene.

It was not because of the room but because there was another person sitting on the sofa in the room.

“Uncle!”

“Aria!” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Two voices sounded at the same time.

Aria’s uncle was the one who had taken the merchant guild away. There was a box beside him. If Aria was right, it was a box used to store perfume.

Aria’s uncle also saw Aria and the perfume in his hand. He had a strange expression.

The two of them looked at each other.

The room fell into silence.
