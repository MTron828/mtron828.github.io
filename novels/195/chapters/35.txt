Chapter 36: Basic Antidote

Translator: Lonelytree

“You can help?”

In the study, count Gimori looked at Eli and asked.

“Yes, I think I can provide some help with the poisoning,” Eli, who was sitting on the sofa, nodded.

Just now, the Butler had left after giving his report, so only Eli and the count were in the room.

“How are you going to help?” Count Gimori looked at Eli.

His understanding of Eli was that he was good at taming horses. However, he had never heard of scholar Clement being good at potions. Wasn’t he mainly studying history?

“My Lord, last year, I happened to pass by a market and met an old man in a black robe. He was selling all kinds of strange things, including antidotes. I was studying botany at the time, so I bought two.” Eli explained.

“I didn’t pay much attention to the antidote at first, but one time when I went out with my senior, Herman, he was bitten by a venomous snake, and I panicked.

“However, I don’t know what I was thinking at the time, but I actually took that bottle of medicine and gave it to my senior. He quickly woke up and recovered without any side effects.”

Eli began to make up a story.

As for whether Herman was bitten by a snake or not, no one would care.

“Oh, so you’re saying that you think your potion can cure the Marquis’ poison? ” The Earl was not a fool, so he naturally understood what Eli meant.

“Yes, I am!” Eli nodded.

“Eli, you’re still too young. This poison isn’t that simple. If it really were a simple poison, the Marquis would have recovered already.” The count shook his head and stood up.

He believed that Eli had good intentions, but good intentions couldn’t cure the poison!

How could there be such an all-purpose potion?

However, he still couldn’t bear to hurt Eli’s good intentions, so he waved his hand and said, ” how about this? I’ll get someone to get the medicine from you in the afternoon. I’ll take a look.”

“Alright!” Eli nodded.

“By the way, why are you doing this?” Count Gimori suddenly asked.

He was a little curious. He did not believe that Elie would do such a thing for no reason. Eli always knew his limits.

“My Lord, I’ve been studying Pharmacology recently, and I need a lot of purple irises. However, because the Marquis was poisoned, I heard that Rock Manor stopped operating. ” Eli said directly without hiding anything.

“I understand.” The count nodded. This made more sense.

“Then you can go back first. I’ll send someone to get the medicine in the afternoon.”

“Alright, I won’t disturb you any longer.” With his right hand on his chest, Eli turned around and left.

“Oh, by the way, my Lord, if it’s really effective, please don’t tell anyone that I’m the one who provided the potion.” As if remembering something, he turned around and said, after taking two steps.

“No problem, I agree to your request.” Count Gimori smiled.

Although he knew that the potion was definitely useless, he could see that Eli wanted to help him. If there was a chance, he even wanted to make Eli his consultant scholar in the future. Of course, that would have to be after Eli became a scholar.

After getting the Count’s reply, Eli didn’t hesitate this time and left immediately.

...

On the way back, Eli sat in the carriage, thinking about the matter.

He definitely could not be directly involved. After all, no one knew if the Marquis’s poisoning had anything to do with anyone else. Perhaps it was the doing of some other major force.

If he was involved, he might get into trouble.

If he could use the Earl to save the Marquis, it would be equivalent to directly shifting the conflict.

Furthermore, as long as the Marquis did not say anything, no one would think that it was Eli’s doing. After all, he was just an ordinary scholar. Who would think that he was the one who had helped?

And if he really succeeded, based on his understanding of the Count, he believed that the Count would definitely help him.

He only needed to provide the antidote.

As for why Eli was so confident, there was naturally a reason for it.

From Roland, Eli had already learned that the Marquis was not a Knight but an ordinary person who had been poisoned and unconscious for three days. This meant that the poison was definitely not very strong and was definitely below the supernatural level.

Coincidentally, there was a type of magic medicine in Saleen’s notes called the basic antidote.

By extracting some transcendent elements and mixing them with some ingredients, one could obtain a potion that could completely remove non-transcendent toxins and alleviate ordinary toxins.

This was also the confidence that Eli had in his potions.

The principle of this magic medicine was to get rid of the foreign substances in the body. Therefore, no matter what kind of poison it was, as long as it entered the body and was below the transcendent level, it could definitely be removed.

It didn’t matter what kind of poison it was as long as it wasn’t a transcendent poison, it couldn’t resist the power of the potion.

As for him, he only needed to sit at the back and watch how things developed. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

...

In the afternoon, the count sent someone to retrieve the potions as promised.

Meanwhile, Eli continued his experiment.

Recently, he had been interested in alchemy and had started to learn this school of thought that he didn’t know much about. The main reason was that once he had enough money, he could do the experiments he wanted to.

As for the news from the count, Eli didn’t know what was going on either. After all, his job of taming horses had already ended, and the count was a busy man.

...

At night, In a Castle within the Gimori territory, in a luxurious room, Count Gimori was holding a potion bottle in his hand.

The potion bottle was shaped like a test tube, and it contained a bluish-purple liquid. If one looked closely, one could even feel a little golden light in the potion.

“Is this the potion?” The Count looked at the potion and fell silent.

Could this fancy potion really save the Marquis’ life?

“I’d better not risk it!” Count Gimori shook his head and placed the potion on the table.

...

In the blink of an eye, it was the next day.

Early in the morning, when count Gimori had just woken up, the Butler suddenly came. My Lord, Marquis Alina’s condition has suddenly become very dangerous. The people of the Empire’s mystic academy are already trying to treat her, but there has been no progress. Should we also go? ”

“Let’s go.” Count Gimori shook his head.

“Oh, right. Can you also bring along the doctors I found before?”

Naturally, he had been doing something for the past few days. He also found a few famous doctors.

“Clean up the carriage, and we’ll be there in a while.” This matter was related to his backer, so count Gimori did not dare to delay too much.

“Yes, my lord.” The Butler quickly went out.

Twenty minutes later, a carriage was already waiting outside the castle. Two doctors were also waiting. They had been here for a while and were ready to set off at any time.

The count, who was dressed in gorgeous clothes, appeared at the entrance of the castle and walked towards the carriage. The Butler stood by the side, ready to see the count off.

Count Gimori walked forward quickly. As a Grand Knight, he was very fast. In the blink of an eye, he was in front of the carriage. He stepped on the bench and was ready to get on the carriage.

However, just as he was about to enter the carriage, he suddenly thought of the confident words that Eli had said yesterday. He hesitated for a moment, then turned to the Butler and said, “Helen, go and get the potion bottle on the table in my study.

“Yes, master!”

Soon, the Butler returned with the potion. The Count glanced at it and pocketed it.

Although there was a high chance that it would be useless... What if it really worked?
