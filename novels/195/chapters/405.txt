The Mother Tree was the protector of the elves.

But the next second, she was stunned.

The Mother Tree extended its branch and pushed her a little further before approaching the evil human.

Erwin blinked his eyes and was a little confused!

!!

“Elf, I think we need to talk.” At this moment, Eli also approached and smiled.

Erwin was at a loss as she looked at the human who was being intimate with the Mother Tree.

It took her more than ten seconds to calm down. She looked into Eli’s eyes and said,

“Alright.”

—————–

Sitting on the soft sofa made the elf who grew up in the green fields feel slightly uncomfortable.

Taking a deep breath, she looked at the human opposite her and the dog lying beside her.

” You can call me Eli. What’s your name? ” Eli asked with a smile.

“Erwin of the Moon Elves. ” Erwin looked at the human in front of him.

The loose black robe was placed to the side, and he was only wearing comfortable, loose black clothes. He had black hair and black eyes, giving off a unique feeling. It was slightly different from the Warlocks she had seen before.

“What is your purpose?” Eli asked directly.

Erwin hesitated for a moment before replying, “I was sent out to find the Mother Tree.”

” Mother Tree, are you talking about Hill? ” Eli nodded and looked out the window at Hill. It was exactly as he had guessed.

” Lord, the Mother Tree is the protector of the elves. I hope you can hand the Mother Tree over to us! ” Erwin sat on the sofa and gritted her teeth.

Although she was very clear about her situation, she still hoped that she could make some effort.

She could die, but the Mother Tree had to return to the elves.

“Oh? Do you think Hill is willing to go with you?” Eli smiled.

Erwin thought of the Mother Tree’s reaction and fell silent again.

That’s right, this was no longer the Mother Tree of the past. The Mother Tree had died in the war long ago. What she saw was only the descendant of the Mother Tree!

“Of course, everything can be discussed. Even if I’m willing, what can you offer in exchange?” Eli asked with a smile.

Hearing the exchange, Erwin’s eyes lit up and she immediately said anxiously, “Sir, the elves are willing to give you anything,”

“What do you have?”

Ely was also a little curious. As the subordinates of the wizards in the past, these foreign races might really have a lot of good things.

” My lord, we moon elves grow a large number of magical plants, and we are good at concocting magic potions. We even have a large number of magic potions left behind by mages or some resources in the green fields. ” Erwin said anxiously.

“What?!”

Eli’s eyes widened.

Potion formulas and Potionology knowledge!

These foreign races actually had this?

“Sir, the elves were the biggest supplier of magic potions to the mages during the mage era. Every year, 70% of the magic potions were refined by the Elves. They were an important component of the mage’s society.” Dylan, who had been silent all this while, suddenly spoke.

He ignored Dylan’s interruption, but the content made Eli’s eyes light up.

That’s right, the mage alliance was a large entity. Mages played the role of brains and fists, but in fact, most of their day-to-day running was reliant on these foreign races. These foreign races controlled many things that belonged to Wizards. T

And unlike the Warlocks, perhaps the knowledge of these foreign races was even more complete.

Although Eli currently had quite a few potion formulas, there really weren’t many of them. At least, ever since he advanced to the Corona realm, there were basically no suitable materials that could be used to increase his strength. Perhaps he could find new ones from the elves.

” Oh, right, what’s your purpose in searching for the Mother Tree? ” Eli suddenly asked.

This time, Erwin looked hesitant and didn’t say anything.

“I think we should be more honest.” Eli smiled and consoled her.

“Alright, my lord. I can tell you.” Erwin took a deep breath and said, ” My lord, I come from the Green Field, which is a large area north of here. There were many foreign races living there during the mage era, and many of them were powerful races. Also, for some reason, the elves were scattered. These years, the elves have been living a very hard life.

” But as long as the Mother Tree returns, the elves will definitely be able to unite again and get out of our current predicament. ”

“Wait, you said that there are many foreign races in the green fields!” Eli looked at Erwin and asked.

” Yes, almost all the intelligent races in the Green Field are once subordinate races of the Mage Alliance! ” Erwin nodded.

Then, she looked up at Eli and found that Eli’s eyes seemed to have lit up.

Eli took a deep breath and suppressed the joy in his heart.

Inadvertently, he seemed to have found a treasure trove again. The green field might have many things he needed.

He might even be able to find information on breaking through five rings there.

Ten seconds later, he looked up at Erwin and said, “You elves need protection, but it’s obvious that Hill isn’t strong enough to do that now. Even if you bring her back, it might not be of much use. ”

Erwin frowned. She had also discovered that the Mother Tree had not even broken through to the celestial level!

“But … I think there’s another way.”

Eli spoke, and Erwin looked over.

“I can protect the elves and even help you unify the green fields, but you have to accept some of my requests. I need you to help me collect some knowledge from the Mage Era and other things I need!”

Erwin frowned even more.

...

Wasn’t this a request for the elves to submit to the humans in front of her?

“That’s impossible. This is not something I can decide.” Erwin shook her head and said firmly, “The bloodline of the elves hides the mark of the mages. The elves only submit to the Mother Tree and the wizards!”

Her eyes were filled with determination as she stared at Eli. ” The Elven Priests who survived from that era would never submit to the Warlocks. The Priests said that they were still waiting for the return of the mage. As for you, the priests would never admit you! ” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Is that so?” Eli blinked.

“Yes!”

“That’s great!” Eli smiled.

“Huh?”

Erwin’s eyes flashed with surprise when he heard what Ely said!

She felt a little confused.

“Because I am a Mage!” Eli answered with a smile.

“What?!” Erwin jumped up and shouted at Eli with his mouth agape.

...

But then, she only felt a boundless mental power and saw a huge celestial body floating behind Eli. She fell silent.

Although she had never seen a mage before, the priest would always tell them stories about mages. She also knew what a mage’s celestial body looked like.

The person before her was actually a Mage, but from his aura, he was even stronger than Lord Priest. However, Lord Priest was a Radiant Moon expert. So this person had to be at least a Radiant Sun.

However, it was impossible for a Mage to advance from an acolyte to such a stage.

Unless…The person in front of her was not a native of the warlock world but an outsider.

“Are the mages coming back?” Hence, she asked the next question directly, her face full of anticipation.

On the other hand, Eli raised his eyebrows. He did not seem to have thought that the topic of conversation would change to this.

However, his powerful mind worked quickly, and in the blink of an eye, he understood Erwin’s thoughts. Erwin thought he was the scout of the returning mages!

Eli’s thoughts flashed, and the smile on his face gradually became serious. He looked at Erwin and said, “You are very smart!”

Erwin felt her breathing quicken!

“Then what is the purpose of your visit?”

“To prepare for the return of the main force!” Eli nodded, then looked at Erwin and said solemnly, “Erwin, I need your help!”
