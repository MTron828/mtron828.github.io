375 I’ll Let Him Go

A breeze accompanied the bright moon as night fell.

A crow passed by and perched on a branch, its round eyes looking at the temple in the distance.

Suddenly, with a crack, the huge stone door of the temple slowly opened, and the crow flew away.

“The door is open!” Simon and Kenan turned back to look. The door was slowly opening, revealing a gap.

!!

There was endless darkness in the crack, like an endless abyss. Suddenly, a figure slowly appeared in it, becoming clearer and clearer.

“Sir Eli!”

Simon saw the figure clearly. It was Eli. Eli was still the same as three hours ago, and the smile on his face was even brighter than before.

The huge stone door was ten meters tall, and the tiny gap was enough for ordinary people to pass through, including Eli.

Simon quickly came to Eli’s side and asked, “Milord, how did the discussion go?”

“Your family head is quite easy to talk to. It’s settled.” Eli smiled and patted Simon’s shoulder. “Thank you for bringing me here, but now that I’m done, I’ll be leaving. If you have the chance, come to visit the Bloodline Tower.”

In the next second, Ely turned into a blood-red light and flew into the sky. Then, he quickly disappeared from their sight.

“Is he leaving just like that?” Simon was stunned.

“Simon, do you want to go in and take a look?” Suddenly, Kenan came to Simon and asked.

“I think we should wait a while. What do you think?” Simon suggested tactfully.

“I think what you said makes sense.”

Kenan nodded. From the sound of his voice, the situation inside was probably worse than he thought.

Just like that, an hour passed before a voice came from inside, “Kenan, Simon, come in.”

Simon and Kenan took a deep breath and walked inside.

In the hall, the silver light of the moonlight shone down from the top of the temple, allowing the two of them to barely see what was inside.

After looking around, the two of them fell silent.

Inside the temple, Selona was leaning against the throne. His face was swollen and one of his eyes was bleeding. His clothes were tattered and stained with blood.

And he was not the most miserable. The other two were lying beside the throne, out of breath, and their conditions were not any better than Selona’s.

“Sir, you…” Simon’s throat moved slightly.

“I’m fine, I’m fine, pfft!” Selona said.

Simon, ‘You say that, but you’re spitting blood. It’s really not convincing!’

” Sir, Ely has already left. ” Kenan said.

“Let him go. I don’t want to bully him, so I’ll let him off this time!” Selona waved his hand indifferently.

Simon and Kenan looked at each other.

What exactly had he experienced in the past three hours? Who was bullying whom?

“Oh, right, no one is allowed to tell anyone about what happened today.” Selona continued.

“Yes, sir. What should we do with the Bloodline Tower?” Kenan asked.

As if they had thought of something sad, the two people on the ground shed tears at the same time.

After a full five minutes, Selona finally said, “From now on, the Bloodline Tower will still belong to us on the surface, and nothing will change. However, from now on, whether it’s the annual offerings or other resources of the Bloodline Tower, they will have nothing to do with us. Moreover, we will continue to maintain the protection of this force.

“Also, Simon, take a million magic stones from the family tomorrow and send them to the Bloodline Tower. After that, we’ll pay them 200,000 magic stones a year for ten years.”

“What? That’s too much!” Kenan’s eyes widened. He could not imagine why his lord would agree to such harsh conditions.

Money was only one aspect. Not only did they lose the Bloodline Tower’s resources, but they also had to provide protection?!

What kind of unfair treaty was this?

“Of course, we can refuse. Then, we’ll die, and the Amina Family will be wiped out tomorrow.” As Selona spoke, he looked at the two of them and said, “Can anyone explain why you didn’t come in?”

In an instant, Kenan and Simon felt as if their necks were being squeezed. They did not speak.

” Of course, I’m actually more concerned about another problem. ”

Selona struggled to prop himself up with the only leg bone that wasn’t broken. He looked at Simon and shouted with all his might, ” Why the f * ck did you bring back that villain, Eli? ”

…..

On the other side.

When the sky was just beginning to brighten.

Eli returned to the Bloodline Tower, and the journey only took him half a day. After all, he used a secret technique that increased his speed.

As soon as Eli’s aura descended, Glen came over to welcome him.

“Sir, you’re back. Did everything go smoothly?” Glen asked with concern.

” It’s alright. In the future, the Grassi Land will belong to the Bloodline Tower, and Selona won’t come looking for trouble. Also, we don’t need to give the Bloodline Tower’s resources to the Amina Family. If they want them, they can just buy them. ” As they walked back to the wizard tower, Eli said.

“Ah!” Glen’s mouth was wide open.

Was Selona that easy to talk to?

“Sir, was the second half of your speech true?” Glen was still uncertain.

“Of course, it’s true. ” Eli cast him a strange glance and said, “I’ve already discussed this with Selona. A celestial will be here soon. You can ask him. ”

“Someone else will come?” Glen’s head was now swollen.

What exactly happened on this trip?

...

At this time, the two of them had already reached the temporary residence of Eli. Eli pushed open the door and turned to Glen.” Yes, in the next two to three days, there should be a batch of magic crystals worth a million. In the next ten years, there will be a batch of 200,000 magic crystals every year for ten years. ”

“Did you also discuss this with Selona?” Glen asked again.

“What else?” Eli gave him a strange look before entering the wizard tower. ” Right, hurry up and finish building the buildings in Grassi Land. I’m still waiting to move in! ”

“Alright, I’ll remind the people below.”

In the next second, the door of the wizard tower closed.

Glen expressed his understanding. After all, Eli must have done his best to deal with the Amina family.

It was indeed hard work.

But he still couldn’t understand how the Amina Family could accept such a treaty.

Glen’s only hope now was to wait for the arrival of the Amina family so that he could confirm everything.

“If it’s true, then how strong is my lord?”

Glen realized that he knew nothing about Eli, but Eli had already grasped the Bloodline Tower.

...

“But it’s good.”

Glen smiled and turned to leave.

It was so good to have a powerful person to rely on!

….

On the other side.

Jerre had also received the news from the spy.

“The patriarch of the Amina family and the other Radiant Moon and celestials have been talking in the temple for several hours. I wanted to get close, but I was chased away.

“When Eli came out, he was completely intact, and his clothes weren’t damaged. That night, the Amina Family started to gather resources to compensate for the Bloodline Tower’s losses. They also acknowledged the Bloodline Tower’s ownership of the Grassi Land.”

Looking at the information in his hand, Jerre felt as if his chest was blocked.

Selona wasn’t so friendly when he talked to him.

Jerre felt that he had to get to know Salona again!

This person had two faces. How perverted.

“Why exactly?” Jerre was puzzled.

He quickly recalled the information about Eli. After a few minutes, he asked in confusion, “It can’t be that this kid is good-looking!”

Other than that, he really couldn’t think of any way that Eli was better than him. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

The more he thought about it, the angrier he got!

“Motherf * cker!” Jerre slammed the letter on the table and shouted, “Dayerf.”

The door opened, and a Warlock walked in. He said respectfully, “Lord Patriarch, is there anything you need?”

Jerre’s eyes turned sharp as he gritted his teeth and said, “Gather the ten Warlock forces and have their celestials gather here!

“It’s time to kill!”
