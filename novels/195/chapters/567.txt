568 Unification of the Continent

Three months later!

Eli slowly opened his eyes, and the light around him gradually dissipated.

Stretching his body, he looked around.

At this moment, as he woke up, the Warlocks guarding him also opened their eyes. Vivika, who was further away, also flew over, dragging the unconscious David with her.

“Brother Eli!” Vivika was delighted.

“Yes!”

Eli nodded.

Soon, with everyone’s explanation, he also realized that it had been three months since he entered the world’s will.

“Has it been three months?”

Eli was also a little surprised.

Because he was in the world’s will, he didn’t know the passage of time. He thought that only a few days had passed, but he didn’t expect that it had already been a few months.

However, when he thought about his gains, it seemed that it was indeed not something that could be completed in a few days.

Thinking of this, Eli was sincerely happy.

In these three months, his gains were too great.

First of all, his four nomological laws had already reached the fourth level, which was the peak state of his advancement. Moreover, the shadow nomological laws had also fused with many nomological laws of the same origin. They were completely different from before and were almost on the same level as the light and time nomological laws.

Secondly, his bloodline had been upgraded to a sixth-circle bloodline, the Shadow Dragon King Bloodline.

In terms of bloodline, he did not lose to any family!

The last and most ridiculous part.

Inside the world will, Eli vaguely sensed the formation and development of the world. This made him understand how to build a world and eradicate the greatest difficulty of his advancement.

At this moment, he already had all the conditions to break through to the sixth circle.

“Looks like the Black Fog is quite a threat in the eyes of the world’s will. It’s a good opportunity for me.” Eli shook his head. Other than the Black Fog, he could not think of why the World Will had given him so many rewards this time.

It seemed that the Black Fog had left a deep impression on the world.

However, this was actually beneficial to him.

“As long as the time is right, I should be able to advance to the sixth circle.” Eli was delighted. When he advanced, he could stay in the world in peace and not worry about being disturbed.

From the conversation of the people around him, Eli also knew that the Lich Tower had been completely taken under the control of the Bloodline Tower, and all the forces on the human continent were under his command!

In other words, the Bloodline Tower was the only superpower on the continent.

“So…Is this the unification of the central continent?”

Eli was stunned.

Even he did not expect this day to come so quickly.

“Forget it. Let’s go back to the wizard tower first and wake David up.” At the thought of this, Eli looked at David, who was being dragged behind Vivika.

Feeling Eli’s gaze, Vivika felt a little embarrassed and said, “Milord, it’s been three months, and this guy hasn’t woken up. His soul must be injured.”

“It’s okay. We’ll talk when we get back.”

Eli waved his hand.

It would have been strange if his soul hadn’t been injured that day.

It would be better if he went back. Besides, Eli needed to carefully understand what had happened during this period of time.

Everyone nodded. After guarding for three months, they could finally return.

..

Nothing happened on the way back.

However, it was not until Eli arrived at Bloodline City that he felt a change.

Compared to three months ago, the Bloodline City had been expanded, and the number of Warlocks had increased by several times. In front of the statue of Eli, there were several mountains of flowers.

“How passionate!” Eli sighed.

However, this was also within his expectations.

On the way, he realized that his power of faith increased sharply. It increased from 48 petals to 56 petals. It was also a big increase. After all, there were so many humans.

His return was quickly noticed by the others.

Alida quickly came to welcome them, followed by a few others.

“Sir, you’re finally back.” Alida was excited.

“Yes, sort out everything that has happened recently and send it to me.” Eli said directly, then turned to Vivika and said, “Take David and return to the Tower with me.”

After saying that, he ignored everyone and flew towards the Grassi ground, leaving behind everyone who looked at each other.

“This is my lord!”

Alida shook her head helplessly. This was very mature.

Vivika didn’t feel anything and followed him.

..

On the other side.

Walking into the familiar territory again, Eli felt relaxed.

In the distance, Hydra, Nkola, and Phoenix had already gathered around when they saw Eli. Ely waved his hand to disperse them, and Vivika had already arrived.

“Send David over. I’ll treat him.” Eli said to her.

“Yes, sir!”

Vivika nodded and dragged David, who was still unconscious, over.

Looking at the slightly worn skull, the corner of Eli’s mouth twitched.

This child…

He hoped that David would wake up and that his brain would be normal!

However, looking at David, who had changed a lot, Eli was also filled with emotions.

David was unconscious at the moment because the Black Fog had pulled away all his power when it left David’s body. If he wanted to recover, he would have to make up for it with a power of law from the same origin.

Coincidentally, he did have this.

He opened his spatial ring and took out the sealed Lich of Calamity, then crushed it.

A gray aura appeared in the air, and the figure of the Lich of Calamity seemed to be about to come out again. The cold aura made everyone present instantly solemn.

However, in the next second, Eli moved his hand. With a cry, the gray fog was once again held in Eli’s hand. As for the Calamity Lich, it was already dead. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“The Lord is even stronger!” Nikola looked at this scene and could not help but be shocked.

Compared to three months ago, Eli dealt with Calamity Lich so easily.

As for Eli, he grabbed the gray fog and pulled. A black thread was pulled and flew directly toward David before burrowing into his body.

“Alright, bring him to a room to rest. He should wake up in a few days.”

Eli gestured.

Nikola helped him up and walked towards the wizard tower.

An hour later, Alida sent over all the information.

Eli began to flip through the pages and soon had a more detailed understanding of the recent events. He was only a little emotional when he saw the news of Selona’s death two months ago, but everything else was normal.

After that, Eli took out the black gemstone he had obtained on the battlefield.

“What exactly is this?”

Eli looked down at the gemstone in his hand and narrowed his eyes.

He was ready to explore.

However, something interrupted his exploration again.
