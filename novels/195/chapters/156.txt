157 The White Tower

At the call of Eli, the camp’s higher-ups quickly arrived at the wizard Tower.

In the conference room, Eli sat at the head of the table and looked at the mages under him.

Other than Hae and Tijie, there was also a newly promoted first circle, and most of the others were Level 3 apprentices or even at the peak of the zero circle. These were the changes that Eli had brought to the camp.

“My Lord, why have you summoned us?” Hae asked curiously. After so many years, he had long acknowledged Eli.

“That’s right. There must be something important for the Lord to suddenly summon us.”

The others nodded in agreement.

“There is indeed something very important.” Eli nodded, then threw out a bombshell. “I’ll be leaving the camp for a while.”

“What? The camp can’t do without you.” Even Tijie was so shocked that she couldn’t say a word.

Eli looked at the crowd and nodded, ” I came here for some knowledge and experiments. Now that I’m done, I should leave.

“However, I’m just leaving, not never coming back. I’ll still provide potions to the camp, but many things will change, so I need to explain to you.”

So it was just a temporary departure. Everyone heaved a sigh of relief. The changes that Eli had made to the camp over the years were obvious to all. It could be said that everyone in the camp could be replaced, but not Eli.

“Three things!” Eli stretched out his hand.

“First, after I leave, she will be the temporary battalion commander.”

Eli glanced at Tijie beside him. At this campsite, she was the most trustworthy person. Besides him, she was also the strongest.

The others looked at each other, but no one objected. No one dared to disobey Eli’s words.

“The second thing is that I still need you to collect blood for me. I’ll still come here every once in a while.”

The blood was collected for devouring, and Eli had a vague feeling that breaking through to the second-circle warlock would require a lot of blood.

“The third thing is that you have to help me collect all kinds of mage knowledge.”

There were a total of three things, and all of them were very important to Eli. After all, he had been nurturing this camp for so long, and it would be a pity to give it up. It would be better to let him continue operating. Who knows, the camp might be of great use in the future.

“Does anyone have any objections? ” With that, Eli looked at the crowd.

“I don’t have any objections,” Hae was the first to express his opinion.

“Me too.”

“Me too.”

The others agreed.

“Alright, since there are no objections, the rest of you can leave first. Tijie will stay.”

Soon, everyone left, leaving only Tijie.

“My Lord,” After everyone left, Tijie said respectfully.

“Hmm, things will be hard after I leave. This is a mage tool that I used to own. It’s of little use to me now, but it’s a good thing for you. Take it.” Eli took off the lightning Python ring. The ring was no longer of any use to him.

“Thank you, my Lord.” Tijie nodded and took the ring.

“Alright, there’s nothing else. You know the camp very well. The rest is up to you.” After that, Eli drove Tijie away.

The next day.

Eli put everything into the arcane realm and prepared to leave.

But as soon as he walked out of the Tower, he saw that both sides of the road were filled with mage apprentices, who were looking at Eli silently.

Eli looked at the crowd and walked straight out of the camp.

It was only when they were about to leave the camp that someone shouted, “Have a safe journey, my Lord.”

“Have a safe journey.”

Hearing the sounds, Eli turned back to look at the camp, then left without looking back.

…

Ten days later.

According to the address Kratos left for him, Eli arrived at the headquarters of the White Tower, which was once the territory of the shadow lizard sorcerer Academy.

“Forest of Death, this is the place.”

Eli stood outside a large forest. In the forest, there were large trees that were like dead trees. They tenaciously extended their branches like the hands of demons.

The Forest of Death was once the territory of the shadow lizard sorcerer Academy.

Eli took a look and strode in, but before he could take a few steps, someone appeared and stopped him.

Two Warlock apprentices in gray leather armor with white bracelets on their hands stopped Eli with a serious look and asked, “This is the territory of the White Tower. Outsiders are not allowed to enter. Please show your identification. If you don’t have it, please leave quickly.”

Eli blinked as Kratos really didn’t give him any identification.

“Well, I’m from the White Tower, but I don’t have any identification. Why don’t you go inside and check? ” Even Eli can’t force his way in!

“I’m sorry, we’re currently on a patrol mission. You can call for the people inside to bring it to you.” The two guards shook their heads. Recently, there were too many outsiders like Eli. Most of them were warlocks who came to see the situation in the White Tower, and nine out of ten were spies.

“Alright,” he said. Eli nodded and sent a message to Kratos. Then, he stood aside and waited.

The two guards also stared at him, speechless.

The two guards thought Eli was pretending. Eventually, he’d leave dejectedly like the other spies.

In the blink of an eye, more than ten minutes had passed.

There were still only three people at the quiet entrance of the forest.

“If you don’t have the identification, please leave and don’t waste time.” One of them looked at Eli and said impatiently.

“It’s been more than ten minutes.” The other person only said, subtly expressing his dissatisfaction. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

On the other hand, there was no change in Eli. Suddenly, as if he had sensed something, he looked into the forest and said, “They’re here!”

The two guards were stunned for a moment and turned back to look.

As soon as they turned around, they saw dozens of people. One of the men was walking in front with big steps. The scar on his face indicated his identity-Kratos, as Deputy Minister of the White Tower. Another man with a slightly feminine look was Deputy Minister, Theron.

The two guards were stunned, and they turned to look at Eli, who was not far away.

Who the hell are you?

At this moment, Kratos also saw the people outside the forest. His eyes lit up, and he strode toward them.

Eli walked over as well.

Kratos walked up to Eli and gave him a hug. After releasing him, he looked at Eli and said, “Herman, you’ve really made a great contribution this time.”

Herman?

When the two guards saw this scene, their mouths were wide open.

“Herman?” A guard stammered as he looked at the man in disbelief. He couldn’t believe that this man was the lethal poison master Herman.

Herman was the one who had made a huge contribution to the war with his virus and magic potion.

Heavens, what did he do?

The guards suddenly felt their vision go dark. If master Herman really blamed them, they would be finished.

The other guard had a similar expression, his face filled with despair.

It wasn’t just the two guards. At that moment, the other Deputy Minister, Theron, and the other people who had followed him were also looking at Eli curiously. Everyone still remembered the fungal virus that covered the forest. It was simply terrifying.

This was also the first time that everyone had seen Herman in the long war.

…

“It’s just a small contribution,”

In the face of Kratos ‘praise, Eli was a little humble.

“Don’t be humble. Your contribution this time is even greater than mine. If we didn’t have your virus and antidote, who knows how many more people would have died? Let’s go and take a look at our forces.” Kratos said with a smile, emphasizing the words “our.”

“Alright,” Eli nodded.

“What, did these two guards stop you? Do you need to deal with it?” Kratos suddenly looked at the two guards and questioned them with a serious expression.

The two guards’ legs instantly went weak, and they looked at Eli almost pleadingly.

“It’s nothing, just two very conscientious guards. There’s no need to deal with them.” Said Eli, shaking his head.

He had never taken these two guards to heart.

“That’s good.” Kratos nodded. He knew that Eli was not a brutal person.

“Hello, I’m Theron, a Deputy Minister like Kratos. It’s a pleasure to meet you.” At this moment, the feminine-looking man also walked over and smiled as he extended his hand.

“Good day, my Lord.” Eli shook his hand.

“Don’t need the formality. You can just call me Theron.” Theron looked like a cautious person, but his tone was very gentle.

“Yes, sir Deputy Minister.” Eli nodded. One could not take polite words seriously.

“You know the rules.” Theron laughed.

“Since Herman is back, we can start the first round of the meeting,” Kratos said with a smile.

“Yes!”

“What?” Eli looked at Kratos.

“Oh, I forgot to tell you. You’re now one of the 12 councilmen. This is what you deserve.” Kratos said with a smile.

Eli nodded. This time, he was truly a senior figure in this new faction.

Soon, everyone returned. Kratos and Theron walked in the front, with Eli behind them and the others behind them.

Along the way, the others looked at him curiously. Some even kept their distance from him as if they were afraid that they would be infected with all sorts of terrifying viruses.

However, there were also some people who looked at Eli in admiration. It could be said that at this moment, Eli’s fame could almost be compared to any Deputy Minister. In fact, his name was even greater in the Blood Alliance.

Soon, the group passed through the dark forest, and Eli could hear the sounds around him gradually increasing. After walking a few hundred meters, a small town appeared before his eyes.

“This is the White Tower?”

Eli’s eyes lit up.
