77 Turmoil and Rias

The chaos lasted for three days.

Eli didn’t go out either. Other than watering the seeds with incubation fluids on time every day, he was studying potions and alchemy.

Although the two books weren’t thick, there was a lot of knowledge in them. Eli studied while carrying out experiments to aid his learning. The effect was great, but it was very time-consuming.

Normally, no mage would be stupid enough to do experiments one by one. After all, textbooks were meant to be read-only. One would know how troublesome it was to try to attempt every example given.

And that was exactly what Eli did, and he never got tired of it. He had plenty of time anyway, so he could just take it slow.

“How interesting. These two materials can actually produce such a change when they are combined!” After completing another experiment, a satisfied smile appeared on Eli’s face.

With the support of a top Chamber of Commerce, he didn’t have to worry about materials for his experiments. He only needed to tell the Kazan Chamber of Commerce, and they would help him find them.

The only thing he had to worry about was whether these materials were available.

“There’s also the flame blast potion, the stun potion, and the Azix shield potion...” There were many new potions recorded in the advanced potionology book, and Eli was prepared to refine some in case he needed them.

However, the only regret was that there was no mental power potion in it, so he had to find a way himself.

“Take it slow. There’s no rush!”

...

On the tenth day after the death of Bryne the sixth, His Royal Highness the first Prince inherited the throne.

The era that belonged to the 45-year-old bryne the seventh had finally arrived.

However, the situation he was facing was not very good. With the death of Bryne the sixth, the surrounding countries began to stir.

They started to frequently harass the Bryne Empire at the border, trying to test the Empire’s bottom line and whether the new king was as tough as Bryne the Sixth.

The people also hoped that the king would give the necessary counterattack.

But it was a pity that Bryne the seventh did not inherit the toughness of his father. He began to give in and decided to renegotiate with the other countries. This made many people’s jaws drop.

After seeing the new king’s weakness, several countries also took off their masks and started a war.

The war began in the year 315 of the Bryne Calendar.

A total of three countries attacked Bryne from three different directions.

That year, Alex had advanced to become a Grand Knight and led an Army to join the war. In one battle, he defeated the main forces of a region. His bravery had even surprised the Empire.

This descendant of the Marquis ‘family also displayed the loyalty of a noble and successfully defended the territory of the Empire. The reputation of the Alina family in the Empire greatly increased.

But the other two defenses were not so smooth.

One side was directly defeated, and a large area of land was occupied.

A fierce battle was also taking place on the other side. Many nobles had also joined the Imperial Army in the attack, including the descendants of the Gimori family, Rias’s two older brothers.

The war had been a success, but the Gimori family had fallen into sorrow.

Rias’ two older brothers were ambushed and killed in the war. It was said that when Count Gimori heard the news, he immediately collapsed in his seat, and his hair turned white overnight.

In the same month, Rias returned from her fief and was ready to inherit the title. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

However, the war wasn’t over yet. The three countries who had tasted the benefits naturally would not give up because they had already seen the weakness of Bryne the seventh.

More troops were gathered at home, ready to attack.

However, to their surprise, the Lorraine Kingdom had publicly expressed their support for Bryne. They had also mobilized their Army and arrived at the border, ready to fight at any time.

This made the other countries reconsider. In the end, the opposing army returned to the camp, and the war ended before it even happened.

The bryne Empire was like a Wolf Cub that had been humiliated and was licking its wounds.

Everything came to a standstill.

All wars were fought for benefits, but only one knew the pain behind the benefits.

...

The war lasted for half a year.

Two months after the war ended, Eli was invited to the banquet of the new countess of Gimori.

At the magnificent banquet, Eli met Count Gimori. However, compared to more than half a year ago, his condition was much worse. Not only was his hair all white, but his eyes had also become a little dull.

At this moment, he was only a grieving father.

The banquet lasted for a long time, and at the banquet, Eli also saw Rias.

This was the girl who had studied with him in the library.

Compared to the past, the 24-year-old Rias was even more alluring. She was still wearing purple clothes and was as beautiful as a violet, but her slightly red eyes spoke of her sorrow.

She took the family coat of arms from Count Gimori’s hands and wore it on her body.

From now on, she would be the countess of Gimori.

And Eli was standing in the crowd, witnessing everything.

After the banquet ended, Eli was about to leave when a guard walked over. “Mr. Eli, Her Excellency the countess would like to see you.”

“Alright, lead the way!” Eli stopped and decided to meet her.

On the balcony of one of the rooms, Eli met with Rias.

She had already changed into a simple set of clothes and was standing on the balcony, looking outside with her head lowered. Eli could clearly feel her sorrow.

Eli walked to the balcony silently and looked outside as well.

“Eli, this used to be my favorite place. I used to love standing here and enjoying the night breeze.” Rias spoke with a sad tone.

“The scenery is indeed not bad.” Eli nodded.

They were on the third floor, and they could see the bustling city from there.

“Long time no see, Eli!” Rias turned around and looked at Eli.

“It’s been a long time indeed, but you’re still as beautiful as ever!” Eli said politely.

“I thought I would never return to Junlin in this life. I didn’t expect such an accident to happen.” Tears fell from the corner of her eyes.

“Indeed, there are many things that no one can explain clearly. People are too fragile,” Eli sighed.

This was why he had never wanted to leave this place.

He knew there might be a mage camp in the East, but he didn’t go there. He stayed in this place where there were no mages.

He would not leave this place unless he had the ability to survive.

“You haven’t changed at all. You’re still so calm and rational!” said Rias as she looked at Eli.

“You too. It’s almost time. I should go back. If you need anything, you can call me.” Eli shook his head, then turned around and left.

‘You really haven’t changed at all. You’re still as cold as ever!’ Looking at Eli’s departing figure, Rias suddenly laughed.

Didn’t he know how to comfort her?

‘He really hasn’t changed at all. It had clearly been a few years, but he was still the same as before.

‘It is as if time had not left any traces on him.’
