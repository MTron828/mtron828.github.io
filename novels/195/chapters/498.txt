499 Dylan’s True Body

Something big!

Even Eli had to admit that this was a big deal.

“Are you sure you found your true body?” Looking at Dylan, who had returned overnight, Eli had a look of disbelief.

“It’s true, Eli, I found it, I found it!”

Dylan jumped up and down, almost shouting.

Not far away, both Hydra and Nikola were stunned. This was the first time they had seen Dylan so excited, and they were equally shocked by his words.

“True body?” Nikola murmured.

If he remembered correctly, Dylan seemed to have a certain relationship with the legendary Mage Tower. If that was the case, then this was really a big deal.

“Where is it?” Eli looked at Dylan seriously.

He believed that Dylan wouldn’t lie to him.

However, this matter was indeed of great importance.

” Further south of the City of Dawn, at the edge of the Western Region, at the end of the Saul Mountains, near the ocean. I found my true body there.” Dylan said quickly and happily, “I know it’s true.”

“Then why didn’t you get it back?” Eli asked curiously.

Every time Dylan went out, his clone would accompany him. If he really found it, he should have brought it back.

Dylan’s face turned awkward. “I realized that my main body seemed to be in ruin. Moreover, for some reason, there are many high-level mechanical products guarding it. I even saw a robot that is comparable to a half-step fifth circle!

“We entered for a while and came out. Fortunately, we didn’t wake those robots up. However, my true body should be at the center of the ruins. I’m very sure of this. I came back this time to ask you to help me retrieve my true body. Don’t worry, what’s mine is yours…”

Dylan kept talking, and Eli understood the reason.

“Alright.”

Eli nodded. He had been curious about Dylan’s true form for a long time.

Since he had found it, he naturally couldn’t give up.

“That’s great!”

Dylan said happily, his eyes flashing with mechanical blue light!

..

Eli, Nikola, and Dylan stood on the body of the Hydra and arrived at their destination, a hilly area. Standing here, they could even see the Endless Sea in the distance.

The southern part of the Western Region was connected to the Endless Sea. From here to the West Coast, it was even closer than the mountain range, but it was also more dangerous!

” Eli, Eli, it’s there!” Dylan excitedly pointed at a mountain on the ground.

Eli looked down and saw a small mountain peak standing on the hill!

He did feel a faint spatial power there.

“There’s something!”

The silver-white eyes in Eli’s eyes turned, and his vision shifted to the side again.

On top of the mountain peak, a medium-sized ruin was stuck in between the spaces. Inside was a huge space of thousands of square kilometers, but the interesting thing was that there was only a mage tower in the center, surrounded by a large number of mechanical products to protect the mage tower.

This arrangement was a little similar to the area where Eli found Dylan!

In front of the tower, there were three huge mechanical creations that were nearly a thousand meters long. They were like robots, calmly lowering their heads to guard the three directions of the mage tower.

Judging from its size, it was indeed similar to what Dylan had said. It was comparable to a half-step fifth-circle warlock.

“Nikola!” Eli turned to look at Nikola.

“Yes, sir!”

As his subordinate for many years, he directly flew down.

Weng!

Space rippled as he entered the ruins.

Eli observed carefully. After all, there might be some ” surprises ” in ruins, so he was more cautious.

After entering, Nikola quickly approached the center of the field.

Soon, many mechanical creations woke up, and countless cannon fires instantly covered the sky. Nikola also easily avoided the attacks and arrived not far from the wizard tower.

At this moment, one of the giant robots woke up.

The blood wires all over his body emitted a faint blue light, and the energy was transported to the core area. He stood up directly and attacked Nikola. Because he was not afraid of soul attacks, Nikola quickly fell into a disadvantage.

A few seconds later, Nikola fled in a sorry state and left the mystic realm.

“Sir, those three should have the strength of half-step fifth circle,” Nikola said as he came to Eli’s side.

“Okay. There doesn’t seem to be any danger inside. Leave the rest to me.” Eli nodded and extended his hand. A shadow appeared in his hand, emitting a devouring power.

“Shadow rules?” Nikola watched from the side.

Just as he thought that the other party was going to enter.

The shadow turned into a thousand-meter-long hand and grabbed at the ground, covering the space of the ruins. With a cracking sound, cracks appeared in the surrounding space. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Kakaka!

The crack expanded rapidly in front of the huge power. In the blink of an eye, cracks that were thousands of meters long appeared in the sky. The spatial ruins were also faintly visible in everyone’s vision.

Bang!

In the end, there was a terrifying sound of destruction.

Space was suddenly broken, and the space outside the ruins was opened. Countless items in the ruins fell to the ground like rain, and dust rose like a sandstorm in a radius of tens of thousands of miles.

Eli ignored it completely, and the giant shadow hand reached into it.

Weng!

Then, under the shocked gazes of the few people, a Mage Tower was slowly dragged out and then flew towards Eli. Then, it slowly shrank and finally ended with a spatial seal spell!

“This!” The corner of Nikola’s mouth twitched as he looked at the wizard tower.

So what was the point of him going in?

“Sir, those mechanical creations have awakened!” At this moment, Dylan shouted from the side.

Not far away, among the dust on the ground, the mechanical creatures who were shaken out slowly stood up and looked at Eli. The three thousand-meter-tall mechanical machines also slowly climbed up, their eyes lit up with blue light, and then they shouted at Eli.

“Mission interrupted…Mission reorganization…Take back the lord’s body!”

Weng!

The thousand-meter-tall giant was like a tall mountain. It moved its legs and quickly walked toward Eli.

However, to Nikola and Dylan’s surprise, they only saw Ely wave his hand, and a shadow ocean ten thousand meters above the ground suddenly appeared, covering the machines.

Weng!

A terrifying wave of scorching elements was emitted around the robot, trying to stop this attack. However, the shadow’s power easily broke through this defense and attached itself to the mechanical bodies.

“Devour!”

Eli also used the new rules he had mastered.

Weng!

In an instant, the shadow seemed to have turned into a black hole. Strands of blue energy seeped out from the surface of the robots and disappeared without a trace. The robots’ movements slowed down until they stopped, including the three huge robots.

After it ended, all the mechanical creations slowly sank and disappeared into the shadows.

“Sir, what is this?” Nikola asked in a daze.

He really didn’t quite understand the scene in front of him.

“Mechanical creations generally rely on high-concentration energy crystals to operate. After absorbing the energy, they naturally can’t move. Isn’t this common sense?” Eli glanced at him.

Nikola was speechless.

Mechanical creations required energy, which was very reasonable. However, it was unreasonable for him to directly absorb it like this. At this moment, he also understood that this was most likely a law that his master had mastered.

“Alright, compared to these, Dylan, are you sure your body is inside?”

With a sudden change of topic, Eli asked Dylan while holding the Tower in one hand.

Dylan’s throat moved slightly, but his eyes were fixed on the Mage Tower.

The light in his eyes was unprecedentedly hot and dazzling.
