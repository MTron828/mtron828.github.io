82 Multi-party Action

Two days passed in the blink of an eye.

That afternoon, Eli had just finished a day’s work and was preparing to return.

Othello pushed the door open roughly and threw down a document. He said arrogantly, ” “Finish this document for me tonight. I want it by tonight.”

“Deputy Director Othello, I’m off work,” Eli said calmly.

“Hmph, I don’t care. Otherwise, when I become the chief, you should be prepared to leave, and that old man of yours!” Othello didn’t care and coldly snorted.

“Well, I’m off work now, so you should leave this job to someone else!” Eli shook his head, and without even looking at the documents, he left.

No wonder he was the bad guy. This guy was completely brainless!

Othello’s eyes widened when he saw that Eli actually dared to leave in front of him. “Come back here!”

His angry voice echoed throughout the room, but Eli had already left.

What a joke. He had not taken the initiative to work overtime for the past 20 years. How could it be broken today? in his previous life, he had died from working overtime. This would not happen again in this life.

“When I become the chief...” Othello gritted his teeth and angrily threw the document on the ground.

The chief election was in five days.

...

At night.

Othello returned home.

At the banquet, Othello sat on one side with a smug look on his face. His father, Amir, was sitting opposite him.

“How’s the situation at the library?” Amir asked as he ate the foie gras.

“Everything is fine, but there are some small bugs that are very troublesome. I will deal with them properly when the time comes.” Othello gritted his teeth and coldly snorted.

“that’s good. Take this opportunity. If you become the director, our family will instantly be comparable to an Earl’s family.” Amir smiled as well.

He knew that he had been used, but he would not let go of this opportunity. He had no choice, and the benefits were too great.

“I hope there won’t be any major accidents,” Amir said to Othello.

“What kind of accident can happen?” said Othello with disdain.

...

The next day, Othello and his father had breakfast as usual, and the atmosphere was peaceful.

Suddenly, a voice was heard. A man rushed in, rolling and crawling.

“master, it’s not good. There’s a problem with our business. A few large Chambers of Commerce suddenly joined forces to block our channels. No Chamber of Commerce is willing to work with us!” The man panted heavily, his face full of fear.

“What??? ”

Amir stood up immediately, and Othello was also shocked.

What was going on?

“What’s going on? What about the foreign Chambers of Commerce? ” Amir didn’t have time to eat. This was a matter of the family’s lifeline.

They had a capital-free business. They were most afraid of it. If they had no stock shipping in, the chain reaction caused was enough to make them collapse.

“Old master, I don’t know.” the man looked like he was about to cry. ” now, it’s not just the chambers of commerce in the country. The foreign chambers of commerce have also cut off their business with us under the lead of the Kazan chamber of commerce. We only have two or three channels left. ”

Amir’s throat moved slightly, and cold sweat dripped down his back.

He definitely didn’t know what had happened.

What was going on?

He turned to look at Othello and said, “did you offend anyone recently?”

“Who can I offend? It’s just a bunch of stinky scholars in the library. I didn’t touch those with status. It’s just that yesterday, a student of the Vice Director ignored me and left.” Othello was a little flustered, but he still said it.

Amir shook his head. Othello was a little stupid, but he wasn’t that stupid. He knew that some people couldn’t be provoked.

“No, if that’s the case, we’ll go to Count Zara now! ” Amir’s legs were a little weak, but he immediately ordered a carriage.

He looked at the panicking Othello behind him and cursed, “don’t panic. We still have a backer. There won’t be a problem.”

Othello calmed down a little.

...

“I’m sorry, Amir. I can’t help you this time. I’m really sorry.”

When Amir heard the news from Earl Saleen, he panicked.

“What happened?” Amir said worriedly. If Earl Saleen could not help them, they would really be done for.

“I don’t know either. Since yesterday, the Gimori family has been coming after us. It’s simply baffling. The Countess is acting crazy. We have to protect our own first.” Count Zara was confused.

“Then, sir, if that’s the case, we’re done for!” amir’s face was already turning green.

On the way, he had already threatened those Chambers of Commerce, but they didn’t pay him any attention. This made him know that he needed someone of a higher status to interfere, or else this matter would not be over.

Count Saleen was the person who had the closest interests in them. If he did not help, it seemed like something big had really happened.

“Don’t worry. This matter will harm my interests as well. I will return to the Herman family today and ask for their help to hold back Countess Gimori first, then, I will deal with your matter!” Count Saleen consoled.

“That’s good. I’m relieved to hear that from you, my Lord.” Amir heaved a sigh of relief as if he had found a life-saving straw.

“Look at you. What are you panicking about? it’s a small problem. I’ll probably be able to help you tomorrow.” Earl Saleen whispered.

“Yes, yes.” Amir nodded.

One day was fine, but if it really dragged on for two or three days, three or four days, then it would really be over. The family would probably go bankrupt directly, sell their property, and their noble status would plummet.

“Damn it. I should’ve set up some real assets as a fallback.” Amir was a little regretful.

However, he had seen the huge benefits of capital-free trading, which was why he had chosen this path. What could be more profitable than capital-free trading? Moreover, they were reselling large quantities of goods to earn the difference in price.

“Alright, you can go back and wait for the news.” Earl Saleen also had a headache at the moment, so he sent Amir away first.

“Alright, my Lord. I’ll take my leave then.” Amir wiped the cold sweat from his forehead and turned to leave.

...

At night.

The territory of the Corsi family.

Amir, Othello, and one of his older brothers were sitting in the living room, waiting for news without a word.

“Father, don’t be nervous. With the Herman family, there will definitely be no problem.” Othello wasn’t as arrogant as before, but he was still confident. He hadn’t been to the library for a day, so he didn’t have time to worry about the library.

Amir nodded.

Suddenly, a man walked in. Amir recognized him as the Butler of the Zara family.

“How is it?” Amir quickly stood up. Othello and his brother also stood up nervously.

The Butler didn’t say a word. He bit his lips and said, ” I’m sorry, my Lord. This time, I’m afraid we can’t help you. The Herman family is also in trouble.”

This sentence was like a bolt of lightning on a clear day, striking the three of them unconscious.

Amir’s vision went black, and he fell unconscious to the ground.

Othello and his brother’s legs also went soft, and they fell to the ground. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“I’m finished, I’m finished,” Othello grumbled.
