224 Back to the Battlefields

“Teacher!”

Vivika looked at the familiar face in front of her. Even if it had been hundreds of years, she would never forget this face. It was the light of her childhood!

She had long forgotten how many nights she had missed this figure. She had once sent people to Bryne in search of him but to no avail.

Gradually, she had no choice but to admit that his teacher, Eli, was dead!

However, he had appeared before her eyes once again. Whether it was the trembling Soul brand in her soul or this familiar appearance, it made her certain that the person in front of her was indeed his teacher!

“Teacher!”

Her thoughts turned into a tide, and Vivika’s mind went blank, but she still instinctively rushed over and hugged Eli, tears streaming down her face.

“I miss you so much, teacher!”

Even if this moment were real or fake, she would accept it.

“I also miss you!” Eli hugged Vivika and whispered.

Vivika was the youngest at that time. She was only five or six years old when she came to him. He had almost raised her. It would be a bit fake if he said he didn’t miss her!

Not far away, Nikola was still thinking about the price his lordship had to pay for the curse to be so strong, but when he heard the two of them call each other and saw them hugging, he was stunned.

Teacher?

Nikola was stunned!

He had never thought that the famous tower master of the bloodline tower was actually his master’s student. This was too shocking.

“I can’t figure it out!”

Nikola couldn’t understand how the two of them could have crossed paths. Eli spent most of his time in the White Tower, and he had never seen him in the central continent. Besides, Vivika seemed to have been in the bloodline tower for hundreds of years.

That was strange!

However, looking at this scene of deep affection between teacher and student, he didn’t dare to disturb them. He could only silently go to a place not far away to collect Kloss’ remains for Eli. However, he didn’t manage to collect much, and many of them were damaged in battle.

Looking at the two of them from time to time, Nikola suddenly realized a problem.

It was highly likely that his lordship had killed Kloss to save Vivika, not him.

After understanding this, Nikola burst into tears and fell into depression.

..

On the other side.

Cough cough cough!

Having been hugging her for a full five minutes, Eli couldn’t help but cough. Looking at Vivika, who was still holding onto him, he was afraid that she would hold on to him until dark if she didn’t let go.

Vivika obviously heard it as well. She immediately blushed and let go.

“Vivika has grown up!”

Stroking Vivika’s head, Eli smiled.

“Teacher!” Vivika looked at the man in front of her, still in a dream-like state, as if she wanted to ask him why he was still alive.

Understanding what Vivika wanted to ask, Eli simply made up an excuse and said, ” back then, I was directly sucked into the secret realm. After spending some time in it, I was thrown out. After that, I lived in the South of the West Coast. I heard about you some time ago, so I came to save you!”

So it was like this!

Realization dawned on Vivika. She bit her lips and said like a little girl, “Thank you, teacher!”

“Haha, I’m your teacher! Of course, I’ll save you!” Eli touched Vivika’s head. Her hair was very soft and comfortable. Vivika enjoyed it as well because Eli had always been like this in the past. However, it had been 500 years since then.

“Then, teacher, what should we do next?” Vivika asked.

The big surprise made her a little overjoyed, and she was a little lost for a moment.

“Of course, I’m checking my harvest!” Eli smiled and then walked towards Nikola. Nikola immediately leaned over and took out a few things.”My Lord, this is what Kloss left behind!”

There were three items in total. An ether crystal, a ring, and a fire element wizard weapon!

Nikola handed the item to Eli and looked at Vivika, who was following behind him like a little girl. He pursed his lips.

Eli took the three items and began to inspect them.

The magic tool was a fiery red bracelet covered in complicated patterns. It was a three-ring magic tool that could summon a flame giant. Its strength was between the limit of the third and second circles. It could also enhance fire element magic to a certain extent. It was a high-quality magic tool.

However, it was of little value to Eli. Still, It was better than nothing.

Then, he looked at the ether crystal. It was a rare elemental crystal. Even Eli had never seen it before, but it was very suitable for making the head of a wizard’s staff. It could at least increase his staff’s power by 30%. It was a good item.

What is the ring?

“What?” Eli was dumbfounded. The ring didn’t respond at all with his mental force. The runes carved on it also made him a little dumbfounded.

“Nikola, do you know this?” Eli looked at Nikola.

“I don’t.” He shook his head. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“This is a bloodline space ring,” At this time, Vivika suddenly spoke.

“Bloodline space ring?”

Eli looked at Vivika curiously.

“Yes, only those with the bloodline can open it. However, Kloss is already dead. It’s branded to the owner. Since Kloss is dead, we should be able to open it, but it will take some time.” Said Vivika.

Eli nodded.

He was wondering why there were so few remains on Kloss. So they were in the space ring. This bloodline ring, on the other hand, should be something that was made after the great catastrophe. He had never heard of this thing in the records of the mages. In the past, mages used mental force.

“Then what should we do next, my Lord?” Nikola asked.

...

At this time, his injuries had recovered a little after taking a large number of spirit crystals, but the damage was still serious, and he urgently needed a large amount of soul power to make up for it.

“You’re injured, and you need to recover immediately. I know where to find a large amount of soul force!” Eli looked at Nikola and said sternly.

“My Lord!” Nicola was touched again. He knew that his master had not given up on him.

“Go to the battlefield. The battle between the bloodline tower and the black Isotta should still be ongoing. There are many souls on the battlefield, just what you need. You can also help Vivika clean up the battlefield!” Eli said.

Nicola’s mouth twitched. ‘So, I’m being thrown into danger again?!’

“Right, the war isn’t over yet!” Vivika also suddenly realized that they were still in the middle of a war!

“This is a healing potion. Take it and go do what you need to do. Let Nikola help you!” Eli took out a bottle of medicine and handed it to Vivika.

“Yes.”

Vivika didn’t refuse and directly took the potion. The damage to her body was quickly repaired. Although it wasn’t enough to fully recover, it was enough.

“Okay, teacher, let’s go together.” Although she wanted to stay here, Vivika had to leave and return as well, so she extended an invitation to Eli.

Eli shook his head.

...

“Teacher, are you leaving again?” Vivika was stunned for a moment.

“Of course not. Two third-circle warlocks are enough for the battlefield. I won’t be showing myself. We’ll meet again.” Eli shook his head. It was better to leave the limelight to the others.

“Alright!”

Vivika heaved a sigh of relief. It was fine as long as her teacher didn’t leave.

Soon, the potion’s effect was fully activated. Vivika and Nikola quickly left.

On the other hand, Eli began to clean up the valley. He still had to clean up the traces here, and he still had to hide his identity as a mage. He could not be discovered because of this.

..

Outside the battlefield.

Romeo stretched his body, feeling that he had enough rest, and was ready to leave.

Looking back at the battlefield, the bloodline tower was at a complete disadvantage. He was being beaten back and his fighting spirit had completely disappeared. Some people had even started to run away.

“When Kloss returns, it will be the end of this battle.”

He shook his head and left.

Suddenly, he seemed to have sensed something and raised his head.

In the distant sky, two figures were quickly approaching. One was wrapped in a large amount of wind element, while the other was surrounded by a gray undead aura.

Like two arcs of light, they rapidly approached the battlefield.

“Vivika and another third-circle warlock?”

Taking out his binoculars and seeing the two, Romeo’s mouth opened wide.

Vivika came back alive with another warlock, but Kloss had disappeared.

Could it be …

Romeo covered his mouth, unable to believe it.

After a few seconds, he heaved a long sigh.

“The war is about to change.”
