559 Laura’s Trouble

“Looks like Laura has encountered some trouble. However, I didn’t expect her to really become the Queen of the Mermaid Race. I wonder if her mother is still alive?”

Eli opened his eyes and thought about what he had just heard.

Just now, he had contacted the statue in Laura’s hand and saw Laura and Eval. He had also heard their conversation. It seemed that they had encountered some trouble.

There were two reasons why he didn’t descend directly to meet them.

Firstly, he wasn’t clear about the situation in the deep sea. He was worried that his sudden descent would cause some changes and implicate Laura. Secondly, he could only descend as a clone below the fifth circle after all. Even if he went, the effect wouldn’t be as great as he had imagined.

“However, from the conversation between the two of them, it seems that the order in the deep sea has been restored. This is really troublesome!” Eli looked at the distant sky and pursed his lips.

Since ancient times, the Seafolk had been one of the most important units in the Mage World. They had been fighting with the Mages openly and secretly for tens of thousands of years. It was only because the Mages were powerful that they submitted to the Mages.

However, the situation was different now.

If the Mages left, would the Sea Tribe still be as stable as before?

After all, the Sea Tribe was not affected by the curse. Moreover, the sea area was very large. Whether it was the legacy of the former power or the later development, there were definitely many powerful creatures, and they might even surpass humans.

Now that he had almost all the resources of the human race, he had no choice but to think about this problem for the human race.

Of course, from a historical point of view, the conflict between the two was almost inevitable. It was just a matter of intensity, scope of influence, and time.

“So I have to find a way to understand some things about the deep sea. Moreover, the sea race is not affected by the curse. Perhaps I can find the information about my breakthrough to the sixth ring there!”

Eli rubbed his chin.

Compared to the continent, the knowledge of mages was sparse because of the Warlocks. However, according to what he knew, there were many subordinates of the Great mages in the Sea Tribe. These Sea Tribe members did not leave with the mages back then. Perhaps they could find the information he needed to break through to the sixth circle.

As for the mainland, if he could find it, he would have found it long ago.

In any case, he had not found it yet.

From the looks of it, it seemed that he had to go to the deep sea!

“Uh, but how should I intervene?” Eli thought of the merfolk.

Without a doubt, the Mermaid Race was the best medium for him to intervene in the deep sea. After all, they were a member of the Deep Sea Race, not to mention they had a long history.

Moreover, they were currently facing a crisis. Wasn’t this the best opportunity?

” Therefore, the descent of faith is far from enough. I need at least to be at the fifth circle. It seems that I have to develop the power of faith as soon as possible. It’s almost enough now.” Eli muttered to himself.

This time, the power of faith erupted and increased by more than a third.

This amount was enough to withstand an even stronger force.

” I can send a portion of the power of the law along with the power of faith. This way, the strength of the avatar should be able to surpass the fifth circle. In any case, I can recall the clone at any time. It shouldn’t be a problem.”

Eli quickly came up with a solution.

That was to increase the intensity of the descent and create a clone comparable to a fifth circle mage.

“Furthermore, this can also increase my comprehension of the power of faith and help me comprehend the Laws of Light.” After briefly calculating the pros and cons of this matter, Eli felt that it was completely doable.

Therefore, he turned around and walked toward the teleportation array, entering the time world fragment.

He needed time.

..

Half a year later!

As the time world fragment declined, only 70 years had passed.

At this moment, Eli had completely digested the changes brought about by the advancement.

At the same time, both the Law of Light and the Law of Faith were still being studied, and they had made considerable progress. The former was more than 50% complete, and Eli could already create the Law of Light steadily. The latter was almost 70% complete, and Eli was stuck on how to teleport the clone imbued with the Law of Light.

However, Eli also had his own way of thinking, which was the space law.

Although this was a high-level law, it was not rare.

He had absorbed a portion of it before, but he was not very good at it.

But now, he had no choice but to delve deeper into the study of spatial power. However, this was not difficult for him. As the ruler of half of the continent, he had a lot of resources, even spatial resources.

Therefore, the experiment’s progress kept improving.

However, he still felt that there was not enough time.

In the past six months, the laboratory was naturally very peaceful with joy, but the merfolk did not have it easy.

Since half a year ago.

The deep-sea race called the Megalodon Shark Race was constantly harassing the Mermaid Race. Small conflicts would occur from time to time, and the Mermaid Race would constantly lose manpower.

Laura had also proposed a suggestion to the Imperial Dynasty of the Sea Tribe regarding this situation, but it was to no avail. In fact, many races had cut off contact with the Mermaid Tribe due to the threat of the Megalodon Sharks.

In the past half a year, they had been living in an abyss of suffering.

Of course, it wasn’t as if Eli had done nothing. During this period of time, he gradually gained a preliminary understanding of the deep sea.

At this moment, the deep sea had already ended its chaotic period. It was now ruled by an alliance of the Sea Race, which was the Imperial Dynasty of the Sea Race. Almost half of the Sea Race, including the Mermaid Race, had gathered in this Imperial Dynasty.

Of course, the merfolk were not prominent among them. The main reason was that they were too weak. This was also the reason why the Megalodon Sharks had their eyes on the merfolk. They had their eyes on the merfolk’s territory.

On the whole, the strength of the Sea Tribe had already surpassed the Warlocks of today. It was just that they had been fighting internally, so they did not pay attention to the continent.

Moreover, the continent was not that attractive to the Sea Tribe.

However, he understood that this was only because they still had sufficient resources. As the Sea Race developed, they would sooner or later shift their attention to the continent. At that time, the two races would erupt into war again.

He planned to help the Mermaid Race to become his spy and provide help when necessary!

However, it was clear that the merfolk’s strength was not enough at the moment, so they needed him.

Therefore, he had to resolve the advancement of faith descent before the Megalodon Shark clan invaded.

..

Time flew by.

A year passed.

This year, the Lich Tower was as peaceful as ever. It was so peaceful that it was unbelievable. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

At the same time, Eli’s progress in the Law of Light had exceeded 90%, and his clone experiment had also succeeded.

In the laboratory.

The faith lotus on Eli’s arm bloomed, and a clone gradually condensed in front of him. During this process, a large amount of law Force was also transmitted over.

The clone’s energy level also continued to increase and finally reached the thousand leaves level.

Looking at the clone in front of him, Eli finally smiled.

His hard work of over a hundred years had finally paid off.

Not only was the clone’s strength at Thousand Leaves’ level, but more importantly, it contained a portion of spatial laws and could teleport between the statues of faith.

” Now, I can relax, and I can also go to the deep sea to take a look.”

Eli stretched his body.

However, in the next second, the statue of Laura in his body began to flash wildly.

Eli sensed it with his consciousness and raised his eyebrows slightly.

“Is it such a coincidence?” Eli was a little surprised.

Because just now, the Megalodon Shark clan had invaded.

The battle erupted.

“Then it’s time for me to make my appearance!” Eli looked at the clone, and the lower body of the clone slowly turned into a fishtail, completely imitating the posture of the merfolk.

Since he was going to the deep sea, he would naturally be a mermaid.

In the next second, his figure suddenly disappeared.

Deep Sea.

He was here.
