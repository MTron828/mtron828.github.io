83 Leaving in a Sorry State

The consecutive attacks from various forces had stunned the Corsi family.

The goods were put on hold, causing them to be unable to pay up. A large number of orders flooded them like a tide, and their families suffered a major blow.

Amir only woke up the next day.

The first thing he said when he woke up was, “How’s the business?”

!!

“It’s all over,” His eldest son said with a sobbing tone.

Hearing this, Amir almost fainted again, but he forced a smile and said, “What about the specific losses?”

“We’ve almost sold all my assets. We’re still short of more than a thousand gold tarls.” Othello said bitterly. he didn’t know what had happened. It had only been two days, and such a thing had happened.

Who was it that had brought such a disaster to the family?

“More than a thousand?!” amir closed his eyes in despair.

This was also a disadvantage of their business. Once something went wrong, the loss would be sky-high, and the only way out was that the chamber of commerce would give them goods.

“What about the Chamber of Commerce? Did he approach them for help? ” Amir looked at his eldest son, who was usually decisive and brave. At this moment, his eldest son seemed to be at a loss.

“Father, I went to the Rose Chamber of Commerce, but Roland refused to see me at all. He kept pushing me away to the Kazan Chamber of Commerce. That fatty talked to me, but he just talked around me.” The eldest son sighed.

“Damn it, if I know who did it, I’ll definitely kill him!” Said Othello angrily.

He was about to become the head of the library, so it was simply inexplicable for him to encounter such a thing.

“Forget it. How many more days can we still hold on for?” Amir sighed as he looked at his son, who had disappointed him.

“Two days!” The eldest son said with difficulty.

“Even our Castle has been pawned. Mother and the others have been driven out. We don’t even have a place to live now.” The eldest son continued.

Amir rubbed his head, which was a little dizzy.

“then, father, do you want to borrow some money from the other Viscounts and Earls?” Othello was worried to death. If his family really fell, what would happen to his future?

“Hmph, all our businesses are gone, and our channels are gone. Who would lend us money in such a situation? ” amir said bitterly.

They were united because of their own interests, so when there was no profit to be gained, it was time for them to go their separate ways.

“Then what do we do?” Othello frowned, his tone like he was berating someone.

“How can you speak to your father like that?” The eldest son couldn’t stand it anymore and glared at Othello.

“Hmph!” Othello glared at him and stopped talking.

“forget it. there’s only one path left.” Amir sighed after thinking about it.

“What path?” Othello’s eyes brightened.

“Leave Jun Lin and run!” There were only three of them, but Amir still spoke in a low voice.

The three of them widened their eyes.

…

Three days later.

Eli received news that the Corsi family had run away.

It seemed that they had left Jun Lin overnight with their things. It was said that they were going to other countries, leaving behind a large number of angry people who had not received their goods and money.

As for their channels and businesses, they were divided up by the Alina family, the Gimori family, the Rose Chamber of Commerce, and the Kazan Chamber of Commerce. The first two took most of it, while the latter two took a little.

All parties were very satisfied. They all received benefits.

The only thing that surprised Eli was that Othello didn’t leave. He stayed Jun Lin alone, still dreaming of becoming the director.

…

“Eli, why haven’t you finished my things yet?”

The door to Eli’s room was pushed open by Othello again, his face filled with anger.

His family had left, and he was alone and helpless. But he didn’t leave, because he felt that as long as he became the head of the library, these things would be solved slowly. He would become the hero of his family.

Moreover, he was also reluctant to give up the coming fame and fortune.

Therefore, in the past few days, he had vented his family’s losses on the people in the library. In just two days, everyone deeply hated this guy and wanted him to leave as soon as possible.

“Alright, I’ll help you deal with it.” He had originally thought that Eli would reject him, but Eli accepted it.

“You’re sensible!” Othello was stunned.

For the past two days, everyone seemed to be full of malice toward him. He didn’t expect Eli to be so polite.

It seemed that he had misunderstood this young man.

He was still very respectful to him!

“Not bad, not bad, this is how it should be!” Othello smiled and turned to leave.

Looking at his back, Eli smiled.

‘what a pitiful person!’

…

A day later.

Othello was dead.

It was said that he died in an alley.

No one knew who had killed him. They only knew that when he was discovered, his body had already started to stink from the high temperature, and his face could not even be seen.

There was no doubt that someone had targeted him on purpose.

The most likely suspect was the group of angry merchants. Since Othello was alone, no one helped him investigate, so the matter was left unsettled.

After that, the director election began.

Because of Othello’s sudden death, the election became the library’s responsibility again.

On the other hand, the team of scholars who had gone out to study suddenly returned, which broke the nobles ‘plans, and the right to vote returned to the library.

The election began as usual.

One was the experienced and diligent scholar clement, while the other was the vice director who had been promoted a few years ago. The results were obvious.

Clement was dumbfounded.

He had somehow become the head of the library.

He didn’t do anything. How could this happen?

…

On this day.

In a large conference hall.

At this time, the hall was full of people. They were all members of the library, including some people from other forces. Today was the inauguration ceremony of the new library director. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Eli stood beside Clement and followed him to the high platform in the center.

Under the blessings of a group of Grand scholars and scholars, Clement took an ancient cane and a badge that represented his new identity and smiled.

The people below all smiled and applauded.

Many people heaved a sigh of relief.

Fortunately, the Corsi family suddenly collapsed. Otherwise, there would have been chaos. No one wanted to suddenly become controlled by the king. Scholars were supposed to study and not serve the king’s private ambition.

Just as everyone was clapping, in the corner.

A charming woman opened her mouth. She patted the woman beside her and asked, ” That old man is scholar Clement?!”

“yeah, Hila. Don’t you know? ” The woman was also a scholar.

“Then who’s that kid beside him?” Hila asked again.

“Him? I think he’s clement’s student. His name is eli, right?”

After hearing this, Hila was stunned.

How many years had it been?

Ten years?

She had always thought that Eli was Clement, and she had even directly given up the election for the Vice Director because of Eli.

Hila was confused.

The reality was too magical.
