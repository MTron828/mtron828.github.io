249 Talent Upgrade

A day later, Eli and the others returned to the bloodline tower.

Back in the familiar tower, the first thing Vivika did was summon all the high-level warlocks for a meeting to discuss what to do next.

The ordinary warlocks didn’t know what was going on, but in just a few hours, orders were issued and implemented, and the entire bloodline tower was in high spirits.

On the other hand, Eli chose to stay in the bloodline tower for the time being.

He began to count his gains.

Even though the silver Moon meeting this time had nothing to do with him, Eli had gained a lot.

The first was a large number of formulas from the Golden Cicida Chamber of Commerce.

Not only did the 20 to 30 recipes contain the recipes that Eli needed, but they also contained a large number of other recipes that he needed at the third circle stage.

The most important of them all was the kotez potion. As long as the magic potion was concocted, he would be able to break through to the middle stage of the third circle, achieving another leap in his strength.

And most importantly, the potion materials were all available this time.

He had gone to the Golden cicada Chamber of Commerce before he left. He had planned to ask them to send the potions to the bloodline tower later, but he did not expect them to arrive just in time.

And so, Eli successfully obtained the potion.

Other than that, there was also the good stuff that jin ji had given Eli.

“The element’s heart!”

In the wizard Tower, Eli took out an element’s heart, and a colorful light was reflected in his eyes.

Looking at this fish that was purely made up of elements but possessed simple intelligence, Eli felt a surge of excitement.

If there was a problem that had always been a pain for Eli, it was never knowledge or the pain of life and death. It was the talent that had always been shackling him.

That’s right.

As a wizard with fifth-grade talent, Eli had suffered a lot.

It had taken him more than a hundred years to break through to the first circle. After the first circle, leveling up was very slow. If not for the accidental discovery of the devouring seal, he might have just broken through to the second circle, let alone the third ring.

“I wonder how the effect is?” The element’s heart in his hand moved about. Just by touching it, Eli could feel that the elements around him had become a little denser.

At this moment, Eli suddenly felt lucky that this was Warlock’s world.

Otherwise, the chances of him having the chance to use such a precious item were almost zero.

Of course, Jin Ji also played a part in this. It could only be said that he was indeed a person blessed by fate.

“I think this item can be directly consumed!” Eli took out a book and quickly found a way to use it, to consume it directly.

He did not hesitate.

The spiritual power in Eli’s hand was instantly mobilized. In just an instant, the elemental heart shattered into pieces and then surged into Eli’s mouth like a siphon.

As soon as they entered, Eli felt as if his body was immersed in some indescribable beauty. The shards entered his body and quickly turned into some kind of substance, fusing into his body.

Eli felt that his talent had improved.

This process lasted for more than half an hour. When it was over, Eli opened his eyes.

“it has increased by about one-tenth!”

Eli meditated for a moment and realized that his efficiency had increased by about a tenth.

Eli sucked in a breath of cold air.

It was a huge improvement. Of course, this might have something to do with his poor talent. However, just this one thing brought about a tenth of an improvement, and Eli was still pleasantly surprised.

To be honest, he didn’t expect such a thing to happen during this trip. It was a complete surprise.

“We’ve already earned back our capital from this investment!” Eli sighed.

One had to know that Jin Ji had fished five of them for him!

He only paid a small price of 10000 magic stones. Was there anything more worth it than this?

With that in mind, Eli couldn’t hold it in any longer and burst out laughing!

A few minutes later, feeling that he had completely digested the first fish, he directly took out the other few and used them one by one.

A familiar feeling entered his body, and Eli silently felt his talent improving. After using the third fish, he seemed to feel a vague boundary. Eli knew that it was the boundary between fourth and fifth grade.

However, this feeling only lasted for a few seconds after the fifth fish was consumed.

The feeling of breaking through some kind of limit was shaking in Eli’s soul.

Eli knew that it was because his talent had been raised to grade four, and his soul was in joy!

He closed his eyes and meditated. A few seconds later, he opened his eyes.

“Cool!”

Eli felt that his meditation speed was now almost 1.5 times faster than before, and he felt a burst of carefreeness. To his surprise, as his talent improved, Eli’s attraction to the elements from the outside world increased once again.

It was almost 30 times. In the past, he relied on shadow and devouring to fight, but now, he could yield great natural elements.

“But it’s still not enough!”

The expansion of his power brought about an expansion of his will, but he knew that it was far from enough.

With the West Coast’s treaty being torn up, the entire West Coast would soon be in turmoil again. At that time, it wouldn’t be as peaceful as it was now. Plus, there was the threat in the form of those late-stage third-circle warlocks.

“it’s still far from enough. I’d better continue to develop. I’ll at least wait until I break through to the middle stage of third-circle,” he decided.

Thinking of this, Eli’s mind settled down again.

He began to count his final gains.

...

These were the items he had obtained from the four warlocks.

The shadow was connected to the secret realm. After the four of them died, their bodies also successfully entered the secret realm. After plundering, the spoils of war were enjoyed by Eli, flesh and blood were fed to the blood bamboo flowers, and their bones would later become undead reserves.

“Let me see what you have.”

Elie rubbed his hands and took out the four rings.

The four of them all had bloodline rings, and by right, there should be imprints on them, but for the current Eli, he didn’t need to wait that long anymore. The shadow on his hand moved and instantly wrapped around the four rings, and the four imprints slowly disappeared.

He opened the first one. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

The space in the first ring wasn’t big, and there weren’t many things inside. There were only a few tens of thousands of magic crystals, some potions that bloodline warlocks needed all year round, and a variety of wardrobes. There were a few thousand clothes.

Needless to say, it belonged to the female warlock.

It was less than he had expected, but he could still accept it.

He opened the second one.

The second one clearly had more items. Not only were there more magic stones, about 70000 to 80000, but there were also many other items. Other than some miscellaneous items, Eli found two items that he could use.

...

One was an ear pendant type magic tool, while the other was an armguard type magic tool.

The earring was a third-circle low-rank tool. It had the shape of a feather and was made of Mithril. However, it was blood-red in color and looked a little nice. It also fitted the name, blood-red Feather.

As for its function, it was to store a certain amount of magic power in advance and then replenish the warlock. After consumption, it could be replenished with magic stones or the power of the will.

As for the bracers, they were called black stone bracers. They were black diamond-shaped bracers at the level of an early-stage third circle. They were used to create a rock shield that could block a late-stage third-circle warlock’s full-power attack.

“They’re all good!”

To Eli, the first piece of equipment was indeed not bad. In fact, he found it in the corner of his ring, it was considered a ” hidden treasure “, but he could understand it. After all, it was a mage’s item.

This item was not that useful to warlocks.

This was to be expected. As a Warlock’s level increased, they would rely on fewer mage tools. Firstly, it required a higher level of mental strength from the user, and there were also other conditions that matched the various elements.

It was nothing to a Mage, but it was difficult to deal with a Warlock.

For example, if the warlock had a wind element bloodline, they could only focus on mage tools with wind element. However, not that many warlocks knew how to refine mage tools as the process of refining tools was a very complicated structure.

That was why there were still a few low-level potioneers and alchemy mechanics, but the higher the level, the rarer they were. As for a third-circle potioneering master like Eli, he was even rarer.

The second ring’s harvest made Eli very satisfied.

Then, he opened the third and fourth ones.

However, he was a little disappointed after checking.

Of course, it wasn’t as if he didn’t gain anything. There was one thing that he really liked.

“two-circle mechanical knowledge!”

Eli looked at the information in his ring and revealed a satisfied smile.

The second lock on the mechanical box could also be opened now.
