199 Everyone’s Reaction Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Year 3510.

At the South of the West Coast, the White Tower had defeated the warlocks of the black isotta Alliance.

As soon as the news spread, the entire southern part of black Isotta and some of the central forces were shocked.

..

“It’s alright, a great victory.”

The next day, when he received the news in the Black Tower, Eli nodded.

He had already done so much. If the White Tower couldn’t defeat them, then the White Tower might as well disband. Of course, defeating the Alliance was nothing. For Eli, there was more to think about.

For example, how the White Tower would develop in the future, the changes brought about by the reaction of the black Isotta, and so on!

“The most important thing is the reaction of the black Isotta. They have three circle warlocks, and I can’t deal with them.” He fell into deep thought.

He could be said to be invincible among the second-circle mages. However, there were third-circle warlocks and mages!

The information he had gathered about third-circle mages surfaced in Eli’s mind. Their strength was on a completely different level from that of a second-circle mage. There was no way to compare.

There were two reasons for this. The first was that when one reached the 3rd Circle, one could fuse their mental force and mana. This made it easier to control, which greatly improved the quality and refinement of spells.

Another reason was that advancing to a third-circle mage would also allow one to achieve a preliminary understanding or communication with nature.

In the past, mages used the mana in their bodies to fight. Now, they could communicate with the outside world and mobilize the huge elemental power. The difference in quantity could be tens of times. This was the most terrifying difference between the second and third circles.

It was the same for warlocks. They could also mobilize more forces of nature, and the innate power of their bloodlines would become much stronger.

So what Eli was most worried about now was that the black Isotta’s third circle warlocks would come straight for the White Tower. If that happened, he would definitely run away. Now that he had three forces, losing one was painful, but it was still acceptable.

“but black Isotta is restricted by the bloodline tower, so it shouldn’t be a big problem. It’s unlikely that they would come here.” Eli thought about it, then threw the die of fate. “Black Isotta’s third circle warlocks will come within ten years.”

Two points.

“It seems that the possibility of them coming is not high.” Eli’s heart relaxed a little, but he couldn’t let his guard down too much. After all, the stronger the person he had to predict, the less accurate the prediction would actually be.

“So ...” Eli pursed his lips. It would be better for him to hide at the mage camp for a few days.

It was better to be safe than sorry.

He was getting closer and closer to advancing to his third circle, so he had to be more careful.

Actually, he had been preparing for this for a long time.

Although there was no information on the advancement of a Warlock, Eli did not intend to advance through the Warlock’s method. Instead, he insisted on the path of a mage.

In order to advance to the 3rd Circle, not only did he need materials, but he also needed the support of various spell formations, a large number of soul crystals, and a precious 3rd Circle magic potion.

Soul Fusion potion.

Its effect was that it could provide protection when mana and mental power fused. It could also prevent damage to the soul if the fusion failed. After all, leveling up was a very dangerous task.

With three forces behind him, he had already prepared most of the resources. Only the soul Fusion magic potion had a slight problem, and there were still three magic plants that he had not found.

They were fear beech wood, human face flower, and water elemental fruit!

The first two were second-circle magic plants, and the last one was a third-circle magic plant.

He had been looking for fear wood and human-face flower all this time, and according to what he knew, fear wood was available at Lilith Warlock Academy, which was one of the alliances he had defeated, so he should be able to obtain it easily.

The iris camp had some clues regarding the human-faced flower and was currently looking for it.

He had no clue about the water elemental fruit. This was because it was a type of water magic plant that grew in the sea. Eli could only send people to the endless sea to search for it.

No one knew how long they would have to search.

“Let’s take it slowly.” Thinking of these difficulties, Eli shook his head.

As long as they didn’t go extinct on the West Coast, it was fine. As for the search after that, he would take it slow.

If he couldn’t find it in one or two years, or even ten or twenty years, he didn’t believe that he wouldn’t be able to find it in a hundred or two hundred years.

He had a lot of time.

After a few more days, he would leave this place for the time being. As for how to deal with his own forces in the future, he had his own ideas that needed to be further implemented. Of course, it would still depend on the specific changes.

He was watching and waiting.

..

Just as Eli was thinking, the news of the White Tower’s victory had arrived in the span of a day.

Many of the small forces that hadn’t been destroyed were shocked. No one had thought that the White Tower would actually win. It should be known that the Alliance was made up of five major forces of the southern region, but they had actually been defeated by the White Tower.

For a time, their feelings toward the White Tower were unusually complicated.

No one had thought that this quietly developing force in the South would be so terrifying.

As for how they were defeated, everyone only knew that someone in White Tower defeated the Joint Forces of several two-ring warlocks by himself, and then the others took down the larger army.

As for who this person was?

The name was not widely known. It was only known that he was a Warlock in charge of the famous Black Tower and saved the White Tower a hundred years ago. He was not far from the third circle.

After this incident, many of the remaining small factions chose to join the White Tower. After all, everyone could tell that the White Tower would definitely become the Overlord of the South in the future. Of course, there was another faction, but no faction would want to join the home of the undead.

..

In the central region, even further away.

Black Isotta.

“It’s like this again!” A man was sitting on a chair, frowning as he read the news from above.

“It shouldn’t be!” Kloss stood up, and his body swept past the mirror at the side, reflecting his appearance-a determined face, high cheekbones, and a pair of dark eyes.

He was the master of the black Isotta, a Warlock at the early stage of the third circle, Kloss.

Today, he had just received the news that the Warlock Alliance of the South of the West Coast had actually been defeated by the White Tower. This made him very confused and completely unable to understand.

“The Warlock from a hundred years ago was called Kratos, right? He is so powerful.” He frowned as he pondered. He must be a genius to be able to defeat so many warlocks of the same level.

He had underestimated this person.

But what should he do with the White Tower? Why don’t we just destroy it?

Bang Bang Bang!

Suddenly, there was a knock on the door.

“Come in!” Kloss said.

The black and gold door wrapped in animal skin opened slowly, and a two-circle Warlock walked in.

“Sir, something big has happened.” The Warlock said as he entered.

“What’s wrong?” asked Klass, puzzled.

The two-circle sorcerer immediately reported, ” my Lord, ever since the original owner of the bloodline tower, Natasha, was attacked by us, although they hid the news, we know very well how seriously injured she was. She was no longer a match for you. That’s why we have been able to suppress them for the past few decades. But just now, we received news that the Deputy tower master of the bloodline tower, Vivika, has advanced to the third circle!

“What!”

A surprised cry was heard. Kloss’ mouth was wide open, and then he frowned and asked, “Are you sure it’s true?”

“Yes, I am!”

Kloss gasped. They had already completely suppressed the bloodline tower, and even that old Natasha was on the verge of death. Now, Vivika suddenly appeared out of nowhere. This was really f * cking frustrating.

“Then what should we do, Milord?” The second circle warlock also sighed.

Kloss closed his eyes and only opened them after ten seconds. He said in a deep voice, “It’s not a big problem.

“Natasha is just holding on. She doesn’t have much time left, and I should be able to advance in a few decades. Deputy tower Master Mason has also reached his limit and is ready to advance.

“If we all succeed, the bloodline tower will also be destroyed. For now, we’ll focus on helping Mason advance, and we’ll first shrink our forces.” Kloss thought about it. Vivika’s advancement meant too many things.

“Alright,” he said. The second circle warlock nodded and asked, “What about the South?”

“Don’t worry about them. The White Tower won’t be able to do anything. They don’t even have a way to advance, so it’s not worth mentioning. Also, don’t we still have the house of the undead and the iris mages who have been secretly expanding? White Tower will have to deal with them too!” Kloss shook his head. He didn’t have time to care about them now.

“I understand.” The Warlock nodded and turned to leave.

“Oh, there’s one more thing!” Kloss suddenly spoke again.

The Warlock turned around, his face full of doubt.

With a serious expression, locks said, ” the White Tower has seriously damaged our interests. We must express our gratitude.”

“So?”

“Send out a wanted reward for Kratos!”
