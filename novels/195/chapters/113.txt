114 Kraken

According to Anna, the discovery of the ruins was a coincidence.

At first, the search team went to investigate a cave in the deep mountains, but they fell into an underground river by accident. The search team was a Knight, so they didn’t die in the undercurrent. About ten minutes later, they were washed by the underground river to the valley.

At that time, the search team was also injured and was ready to leave. However, when he reached the valley, they found that it was foggy, but he was not afraid and was ready to go through directly.

And then he got lost.

He was in a daze and didn’t understand what was happening. When he reacted again, he was outside the valley. In the fog, there seemed to be snake-like creatures rushing toward him.

Although he was in a daze, he still subconsciously ran away. He ran out of the valley and finally hid in a rock to avoid a giant snake.

“Giant snake?”

Sitting on the huge war chariot that was heading towards the valley, Eli asked Anna, who was beside him in confusion.

On the second day after receiving the news, Eli decided to come and take a look, while Anna offered to follow him.

“yes, teacher. At that time, it was a huge demon snake that was chasing after the knight. It was about ten meters long, with diamond-shaped scales, blood-red eyes, and a purple sarcoma on its head. There were circles of purple-black patterns around its body.” Anna brought over a document and reported it to Eli.

Blood-red with sarcoma-pattern…

Eli pondered and soon had an answer.

The giant Kraken serpent!

It is a giant snake-like creature that likes the cold and humidity. Its limit is One circle, and it can grow to more than 20 meters in adulthood. It is as thick as a bucket, and its combat power should be above average among magical beasts of the same level.

And if Eli remembered correctly, giant snakes like this usually lived in groups. It could only be said that the Knight was indeed very lucky to have escaped, to have only encountered one giant snake in the fog. He was simply the chosen one.

“That’s a little troublesome.” Eli shook her head. Any creature, as long as there were a lot of them, would always be in trouble.

“Is there any other information?” Eli asked again.

“No, teacher, that’s all I have,” Anna answered obediently.

“well, forget it then. We’ll talk about it when we get there.” Eli nodded and did not say anything else.

“Teacher, let me give you a massage.” Seeing that Eli was silent, Anna stood up and walked over to him in small steps, then gave him a massage.

Eli cast her a glance but did not say anything.

Any outsiders would be so shocked that their jaws would drop if they saw this. After all, who didn’t know about Queen Anna’s coldness? However, at this moment, she was actually giving Eli a massage so obediently. It was simply unbelievable.

…

Half a month later, Eli and the others arrived at their destination.

Outside the valley.

Eli got out of the carriage right away, while Anna, who was a Grand Knight, walked side by side with him.

Behind them, other than Eli’s twenty-odd slaves, there were also a few dozen Knight-level death Warriors that Anna had brought with her. They were all trained since they were young and were trustworthy.

In front of the valley.

Eli looked at the smoke-filled Valley in front of him. He was stunned at first. Then he narrowed his eyes slightly as if he was thinking about something.

No wonder the Knight was lost.

There was a spell formation set up outside. According to Eli’s judgment, this should be a more common fog-locking spell, but it had a huge range, encompassing the entire Valley.

But … Eli took a few steps forward, quickly constructing a spell model in his mind, and his eyes were a little different from what they looked like, a little brighter.

The eye of truth, a first circle spell, could observe the flow of elements, as well as spell formations or natural illusions. It was the most common observation spell.

As soon as the spell was cast, Eli’s perspective immediately changed.

Countless elements swirled in the sky, like a colorful picture book, presenting all kinds of strange patterns. If one looked closely, one would realize that these elements were not dense.

In fact, in the past three years of meditation, Eli had completely understood why there were no other mages here other than Saleen metatrin. The main reason was that the concentration of elements was really not enough!

The advancement of a first-circle sorcerer would naturally require a large number of elements to increase the degree of elemental essence conversion. However, the elements in this land were too thin. It was difficult for Eli to break through, and this place could only increase his mental strength to 30% at most. After that, he would have to leave this place.

Of course, this wasn’t what Eli should be concerned about right now. He immediately looked into the valley.

The White mist seemed to have the effect of blocking the vision of mental power, but Eli could still see about 70% of the area. This was because as time passed, the spell formation here had either run out of energy or had been weathered and damaged.

What they encountered was the latter. Even by visual inspection, Eli estimated that this place had a history of more than three thousand years.

Otherwise, even if it was just the simplest spell formation, considering that the original owner was a four rings celestial sorcerer, it was not something that Eli could see through.

Soon, Eli discovered the 70% damaged node of the spell formation and walked straight into the mist.

At this moment, the group of Knights was dumbfounded. They did not understand what this person who had followed the Queen here was doing.

But a minute later, everyone seemed to hear the sound of glass breaking. Then, they saw the fog in front of them slowly dissipate, and the entire Valley was revealed to everyone.

Everyone was dumbfounded.

As for Eli, he was standing not far away from them, and beside him was a broken stone pillar.

“The fog is gone?!”

All the Knights looked as if they had seen a ghost. Even Anna raised her eyebrows.

Where was the mist?

What happened to the thick fog just now?

Everyone’s eyes were dull as if they didn’t understand what had happened.

On the other side, Eli had just destroyed one of the core points of the spell formation. The entrance to the entire Valley was revealed before his eyes.

A dozen meters away.

It was a huge entrance, with towering rocks on both sides. Inside, Eli seemed to see some squirming black shadows, and upon closer inspection, they seemed to be huge snakes.

It was the giant Kraken snake that Eli had guessed.

At this time, because the array had been destroyed, the fog inside had slowly dispersed. The entangled bodies of the giant snakes had also stopped, and they all raised their heads to look at their surroundings.

Where was the mist?

However, it was clear that their poor brains were not developed enough to understand this. However, as if they had sensed the arrival of Eli and the others, they all crawled towards the entrance of the valley.

It was a terrifying scene.

One could imagine the scene of dozens or even hundreds of snakes that were almost as thick as the mouth of a bowl or even as thick as a bucket, squeezing together and crawling toward you. It would directly make the scalps of people with trypophobia and snake phobia go numb.

Meanwhile, Eli just stood there calmly.

After all, he was already a first-circle mage.

He had sensed the presence of the snakes in the mist as soon as he got down. It didn’t have the first-circle aura, which was why Eli didn’t have any concerns.

He was already a first-circle mage. If he were still afraid of a zero-circle demon Kraken, it would be too embarrassing. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

1st circle spell-firestorm.

In his mind, a model that was far more complicated than a zero-circle spell was activated. A ball of fiery red mist slowly appeared in front of him. At the same time, a gust of wind element was activated, and the two began to merge.

In just a few seconds, a cloud of red smoke appeared and flew toward the snakes.

As the red mist swept away, it slowly turned into a tornado, shooting out high-temperature torrents of fire in all directions, smashing into the snakes. Once one of the snakes came into contact with the fire, it immediately let out a painful howl, and its body quickly melted.

The other giant snakes sensed this and immediately dodged in all directions.

However, it was too late. The cloud of fire had already reached the center of the snakes.

It was accompanied by flames that spread rapidly in all directions and a violent explosion.

Most of the giant snakes were instantly surrounded by flames, making crackling sounds. Most of the corpses were either burned to ashes or blown into pieces by the explosion and thrown in all directions.

Ten seconds later, the smoke dispersed, and the ground was charred.

The original group of snakes had already disappeared, and now there was only a pile of snake sticks that had turned into black charcoal.

“It’s too much of a waste to use too much power!” Acting cool felt good for a moment, but after that, Eli began to regret it.

The Kraken was a good material. It was a pity to waste them, but it didn’t matter. It was a test of his combat effectiveness.

At this time, the group of Knights and Grand Knights in the distance were all scared silly.

Eli’s servants were better off, as they knew that their master was not ordinary, but the trusted aides that Anna brought were different. They looked at Eli as if he was a God.

Could such a huge flame really be controlled by humans?

A Knight was puzzled. What was this? How could it be so powerful? could it be that this snake was too fragile? It’s only big but fragile?

The Knight frowned and suddenly saw a dried-up snake not far away, seemingly struggling to escape. It seemed to be a giant snake that was on the verge of an explosion.

The Knight took a look, took out a sharp sword, and directly slashed at him.

So many giant snakes had died all at once. How much combat power could a giant snake, that was about to die, have?

Stab!

It was as if he had cut at steel. The Knight looked at the giant snake, which was completely intact. He blinked and wondered what had happened.

The giant snake that was running away was also very confused. It turned its head and looked at the Knight as if it was saying, ” are you crazy? ”

The next second!

The giant snake bit at the Knight. The man wanted to stop it, but he was pushed to the ground. He was about to be bitten to death in the next second. The man was terrified.

Suddenly, a small fireball quickly flew over, and the giant snake was directly penetrated. Then, with a bang, it exploded, and blood splattered.

At this moment, all the Knights realized how terrifying the snake was. Even a singular snake of the Kraken could kill a Grand Knight.

Their gazes toward Eli also turned to respect and fear.

As for Eli, after checking that all parts of the Kraken were dead, he also stepped into the valley.

Was the secret realm really here?
