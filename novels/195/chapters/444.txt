Weng!

The moonlight wailed!

The Sky Cloud Whale streaked across the sky, leaving trails behind. Nikola, who was sitting on it, opened his eyes.

” Sir, we have entered the Holy Tower region! ” A Warlock came to his side and said!

” Mm, let’s continue moving forward. This time, the alliance’s team seems to be gathering at the Holy Tower. There will definitely be people coming later! ” Nikola nodded.

“Yes, sir!” The Warlock retreated.

The Bloodline Tower’s team flew normally, and a streak of fire streaked across the sky in the distance. A three-circle Warlock appeared and respectfully said to Nikola, “Thank you for coming, my lords from the Bloodline Tower. But the allied army isn’t here. Please follow me! ”

“Okay!” Nikola opened his mouth!

After a while.

The Warlocks of the Bloodline Tower followed the Warlocks and set off in another direction.

A few hours later, the sky was slightly bright. Nikola and the others also arrived at the gathering place of the Alliance, a plain in the Holy Tower area!

Nikola looked down in the dim light.

Hundreds of acres of plains were now filled with warlocks. There were at least 100,000 of them. With just a glance, Nikola saw no less than a dozen celestials. This meant that the situation of this war was very important to several forces, and it might even be more than they had expected.

The arrival of the Bloodline Tower also caused a commotion. The Warlocks all looked towards the sky.

Although the various factions in the Western Region didn’t rank the factions, the Bloodline Tower was definitely in the top three in terms of influence, top five in terms of territory, and top ten in terms of combat power.

Of course, this didn’t take into account the existence of Eli. Even the Warlocks of the Western Regions had to admit that Eli of the Bloodline Tower had the strength to single-handedly destroy a Level 2 force. The previous war with the Eight-Armed Naga family was the best proof!

Everyone was curious about how many people the Bloodline Tower had sent, but whether that person had come or not!

They weren’t the only ones who were curious. As the Bloodline Tower entered the Sky Domain, several rainbows flew out from a huge tent in the distance. Each of them was at least a radiant moon or even a radiant sun.

Soon, a few rainbows scattered and revealed the Warlocks inside. Standing at the front was a white-haired old man, and beside him stood another man with a cold face and a woman with a smile on her face. The three of them were Radiant Sun Warlocks.

Behind them were the Radiant Sun and Radiant Moon, but their positions weren’t as high as the first three. Nikola even saw Luo Ye, who was standing behind the white-haired old man, wearing a red warlock robe and looking at him.

” Hello, I’m the Holy Tower’s Pagoda Master, Holy Sword Weitz. ” The old man was the first to introduce, but he kept looking behind Nikola.

The other two also introduced themselves!

” The patriarch of the Twilight Giant Lizard Family, Qigu Mark. ”

” The head of the Siren Family, Vicky Hayley. ”

Nikola nodded. He had naturally heard of these people before him. They were the four current leaders of the second-class forces in the eastern part of the Western Regions. As for why there were only three of them, it was because the last force had been destroyed by the demons.

” Greetings, my lords. I am Nikola from the Bloodline Tower. ” Nikola introduced himself to them in neither servile nor overbearing manner!

He understood that he was not just representing himself.

At this moment, the few clan leaders were listening to the introduction while observing the people behind Nikola. They were all disappointed to see that there was no Eli!

Of course, they would not show it on their faces. After chatting with Nikola for a while, they took him to the main tent.

At this moment, almost everyone who could come was there. Therefore, the Holy Tower Family Head quickly gathered the higher-ups and representatives of various factions for a meeting to decide how to fight next.

After a while!

In the tent, the three warlocks and Nikola sat at the front. Below them were the other warlock forces!

Nikola was also filled with melancholy.

He was originally prepared to sit nearer to the back, but he was still forcefully pulled up by the three family heads.

“No one will find fault with me, right?” Nikola was a little worried, but he soon realized that he was thinking too much. The Warlocks did not seem to resist him at all. They even smiled at him from time to time.

At this moment, he finally understood how high Sir Eli’s status in the Western Regions was!

Even though he had never seen any of the celestials there, these people still respected him because he represented Eli!

This was the status that strength brought!

Nikola also listened to the following discussion but did not raise too many opinions. After all, the Holy Tower was the leader this time.

Very soon, the discussion ended. When it came to the final summary stage, the Holy Tower Family Head coughed and said directly,” The arrangements for this war are very simple. We will directly retreat from the outermost layer of the Saka clan and give the demons the heaviest blow. We definitely won’t let this place become a second abyss. As for the specific location.”

He said a lot, but Nikola only heard five words: Surround and attack!

After the meeting, all the Warlocks, including Nikola, left quickly and began to lead the Warlocks to the battlefield. The plains were quickly cleared!

This was a lightning war, and the various second-class forces did not intend to dawdle!

They wanted to destroy the spatial passageway!

…

Half a day later!

Nikola looked forward. There was another plain in front of them, but the ground was charred black. There were white bones everywhere. Nikola and the others were assigned to go in this direction!

Of course, it wasn’t just them.

He turned his head to the right. On his right were the warlocks of the Holy Tower. Then, he looked to the left and saw the Twilight Lizard family.

Good heavens!

“Begin!” A loud voice came from afar. It was the Holy Tower’s Patriarch.

The order came quickly. Nikola also looked at the Warlock of the Bloodline Tower on the ground and shouted, “Advance!”

Boom!

Hundreds of thousands of Warlocks began to move forward. They surrounded the Saka family territory and advanced towards the interior. The huge team even caused the ground to tremble slightly!

...

Nikola was also on high alert, but he soon realized that something was wrong. As they advanced, they did not encounter any demons. There were only dead human corpses and bones along the way, as well as the charred land!

“Something’s wrong!” Nikola felt a little strange, but the team was still moving forward. At least in the past few years, there had been a large number of Warlocks checking this place every day. They definitely knew the situation there, and at this moment, a Warlock was flying towards him!

“Luo Ye?” Nikola looked at him strangely.

“Yes.” Luo Ye nodded and said, “The demons on the periphery seem to have sensed our actions long ago. Almost all of them have gathered towards the center, so we can’t see any demons on the periphery. These charred black marks are also because the main army of the demons this time is the Flame Demon Balor. The charred black marks on the ground are caused by them walking!”

“I see!” Nikola suddenly understood.

After that, Luo Ye and Nikola chatted for a while before leaving. In the end, Luo Ye told him the reason why he was there.

It turned out that they had discussed all this before and were worried that Nikola would not know, so he specially came over!

Nikola didn’t have any opinion about this, but he was more moved by Eli’s influence!

As time passed, Nikola realized that as they went deeper and deeper, the surrounding temperature became higher and higher. There was also an unpleasant smell everywhere, and even the surrounding air could be seen with sparks. It was as if they were really walking to hell.

A day passed in the blink of an eye.

As Nikola crossed another mountain, he suddenly heard a commotion in the distance, and it didn’t seem like a human!

“We’re here!”

After passing through this section of the mountain, he looked at the ground, and his mouth instantly opened wide. There was a huge valley below, and the area was extremely large. The ground in this area had become red cracks, and in the area, there were demons.

They all had ferocious faces, strong bodies, and a pair of ferocious horns on their heads. Their bodies were also emitting scorching heat, and their heights were not fixed. Some were less than two meters tall, and there were also Balors that were 100 meters tall!

At the center was a human city, or rather, a destroyed city. There was a 300-meter-tall Balor in it. Above its head, which was a few thousand meters above the sky, there was a huge face that emitted a unique burning feeling.

At this moment, the huge Balor seemed to have sensed everyone’s arrival and opened its eyes.

Following that, all the demons raised their heads and looked around. At this moment, the human army had already arrived at the bottom of the valley. Darkness and warlike intent flowed out of the eyes of the tens of thousands of demons. At the same time, the surrounding temperature was indeed rising rapidly. It was the Balors using their abilities!

In the next second!

The demons roared and charged at the human Warlocks. There was no fear in their eyes.

“Fight!”

In the distance, the Holy Tower Clan Head Holy Sword also shouted loudly. At the same time, his body turned into a flame and rushed toward the huge Balor at the center!

“Little human, I am the Fire Demon King, Boggs!” The balor in the city let out a roar, and the surrounding flames flew towards the Holy Sword like a natural disaster. At the same time, a long whip formed from lava in his hand attacked the Holy Sword.

The rest of the celestials also flew towards the battlefield, and the demons responded!

In general, the number of human Warlocks exceeded that of the demons by almost half, and even the celestials far exceeded the demons.

It was as if a crushing victory was determined!

On the hill.

Nikola looked at the shocking scene, but he did not make a move. Instead, he looked at the huge nest in the sky.

He had seen this thing about 5,000 years ago. At that time, he was still a third-circle mage. If he remembered correctly, this thing seemed to be used by the demon race to transport soldiers. Why would it appear there? This made him feel a little uneasy.

“Retreat!”

Suddenly, a voice entered his ears. He looked down and saw that the statue in his pocket was emitting a lustrous light.

Nikola was stunned because it was the voice of the lord.

But why should he retreat? What did his lord discover?

Bang!

At the same time, a buzzing sound entered Nikola’s ears. He felt a headache and saw the nest from the corner of his eye.

However, at this moment, the nest seemed to be collapsing. As it collapsed, an unknown number of figures slowly appeared!

Nikola didn’t have time to open his mouth, but his eyes were getting bigger and bigger. He saw many bodies as big as Boggs, ready to come out!

The only problem was!

The combat power of Boggs was already enough to match the Holy Tower’s family head, who was at the peak of Radiant Sun!
