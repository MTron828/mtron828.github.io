352 Airships

Krysoya Plains.

Four Seasons Garden’s Warlock Academy.

Because the soil here was fertile and the elements were abundant, there were also many magical plants planted here. In addition, the bloodline of the Four Seasons Garden Warlock Academy was mostly plant-type, so they could also process magical plants and accumulate a lot of wealth.

At this moment, in the sky at the very front of the plains.

It was a black mass.

Hundreds of griffin-like creatures flew in the sky. Each of them had the head of an eagle and the body of a lion. They were nearly five meters long and had a pair of huge white wings on both sides. They were scattered in the sky like a huge net.

There were two warlocks on each griffin. Apart from the fifty third-circle warlocks, the rest were all official warlocks with one or two circles.

The griffin at the front was a huge griffin that was twice as long as an ordinary one.

A dark-skinned Warlock stood on top of it, wearing black leather armor and carrying a greatsword on his back. He gave off the aura of a half-step celestial.

There was also a smaller griffin on each side of him. On each were a man and a woman. The woman wore dark green leather armor and held a whip. The man had complicated patterns on his face and looked very unfriendly. Both of them were powerful peak third-circle warlocks.

At this moment, the female Warlock on the right turned her head and curiously looked at the Warlock in the center. “Lord Anli, do we need so many of us to deal with a branch of the Bloodline Tower?”

The dark-skinned Anli turned around and said, “It’s necessary to be cautious. I heard that this team drives an airship. It might be a little troublesome. ”

“Airship? “I’ve never seen an airship before, so I don’t know what it’s like compared to our griffins. It’s just a branch, and it’s a bit of a waste to transfer so many of our people.” A sharp voice came from the left. The Warlock, with a face full of patterns, touched the feathers of his griffin and laughed disdainfully.

” Kubiley, don’t underestimate these creations from the mage era. ” Anli frowned.

“Yes, Master Anli,” Kubiley said, but the smile on his face did not fade.

Seeing this, Anli shook his head helplessly.

This was not his fault.

After all, this was just a branch of the Bloodline Tower’s branch. Even he couldn’t muster up the motivation to do so.

Members from that remote area would probably have at most ten or twenty third-circle warlocks. They probably found the airships in some ruins.

“If you want to blame someone, blame yourself for being so ostentatious without strength!” He shook his head and sighed.

Moreover, this place was too close to the headquarters. A few kilometers behind them was the headquarters. His Excellency could make a move at any time. It was impossible for anything to happen.

“Milord, they are here.” Suddenly, the female Warlock on the right pointed ahead.

Anli looked over.

In the blue sky, three huge airships that were more than 100 meters long appeared in their sight, emitting the beautiful light of the setting sun.

Looking at the huge airship, Anli blinked.

It was so big, and it was indeed very oppressive.

“Prepare for battle!” He shouted loudly, and the griffin beneath him also let out an eagle cry.

The few hundred griffins made a sound, and the few hundred Warlocks instantly became nervous.

Kubiley also licked his teeth, his face ferocious.

He wondered if this airship could withstand the attack of the third circle griffin. Wasn’t it just a metal shell?

The huge griffins were ready for battle.

A few kilometers away, in a wooden house within the green fog, the only Celestial warlock in Four Seasons Garden also opened his eyes.

He was paying attention to this battle.

…..

The fierce wind blew past his ears. On the spectator stand, in front of the airship, Eli’s eyes were calm.

He could clearly see the griffins and Warlocks in front of him, and he could feel the malice they were emitting. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Alida looked at the calm Eli.

“Sir, do you need us to warn them?” Alida asked.

“Do you still think it’s necessary?” Eli only glanced at her.

Alida fell silent.

Indeed, Four Seasons Garden’s intentions were too obvious.

“I heard that the Four Seasons Garden seems to grow magical plants.” Eli suddenly asked.

“Yes, my lord.” Alida nodded.

“That’s great.” Eli nodded and did not say anything else.

…..

As time passed, they were getting closer and closer to the air defense line formed by the griffins.

In the end, it was only 500 meters away, and the airship slowed down.

Three huge airships and hundreds of Warlocks riding on griffins.

“Leave the airship and the resources, and we can let you leave.” Anli didn’t hide his purpose at all and said loudly.

Obviously, the Warlocks in the airship had also sensed such a huge commotion. They all leaned against the window. If it weren’t for Eli’s refusal to let them out of the airship, they would have already gone out to kill these Warlocks.

After these few days, they also faintly discovered that they did not seem to be weak.

However, what surprised Anli and the others was that the airship didn’t seem to have any intention of stopping and continued to move forward.

” Sir, it seems like they won’t compromise. Should we make a move? ” Kubiley looked at Anli and smiled.

” Alright, let’s show them the power of our Griffin Legion. ” Anli nodded.

...

He raised his right hand, and everyone looked at him.

His face was cold, and he said loudly,” Griffin Legion, prepare to attack. Be careful not to damage the airships. ”

“Attack!”

The griffin flapped its wings, and the air around them surged. Everyone flew toward the airship.

The airships were surrounded from all directions.

Kubiley was leading the way. The griffin beneath him was even faster, letting out an eagle cry.

He wasn’t a fool, but he understood that basically all airships were mobile tools and didn’t have many offensive measures.

Anli stayed where he was and watched the griffins charge forward.

In his opinion, this battle was already decided.

….

In the airship, Alida was a little nervous.

...

It was only because of her trust in Eli that she had the courage to stand here. However, what made her feel strange was that Eli did not seem to have any intention of making a move.

” Alida, do you know what the difference between a warlock and a former mage is? ” Suddenly, Eli turned around and asked.

“The difference?” Alida was very confused and said uncertainly, “Warlocks don’t need to rely on mental energy more?”

“No. The only difference is that warlocks like to use their eyes to judge things,” said Eli, shaking his head. “Mages like to observe carefully first, then explore and draw conclusions. ”

“Sir, what does this have to do with us? They are already very close.” Alida looked nervous. The nearest griffin was only 30 meters away from her, and she could almost smell its scent.

“Take this airship, for example!”

Airships?

Alida looked up.

” It looks no different from an ordinary airship on the surface. It’s just a means of transportation, but it’s actually a large-scale mage tool. ” Eli said.

Alida was a little confused. She did not understand what Eli meant. She only knew that she was afraid. The griffin was getting closer, only twenty meters away.

Crack!

She suddenly heard a click. She turned her head and saw that Eli seemed to have activated a button.

A button?

Alida suddenly felt the airship shake. She turned to look at the sides and saw holes appearing on the silver airship. Cannon barrels that were emitting cold light came out from them, and each of them was glowing with complicated magic patterns.

Alida could only see the two sides, but she estimated that there should be hundreds of them.

“What is this?” Alida was stunned.

Not only she but all the Griffin Warlocks were dumbfounded by this scene.

The cannons looked like they were not to be trifled with, and the runes that lit up on them made everyone feel uneasy.

Kubiley widened his eyes and prepared to turn around and run.

However, in the next second, countless lights exploded from within. Countless elemental cannonballs shot out, streaking through the air and illuminating the air within a few kilometers.

Boom!

A huge explosion sounded.

All the griffins were enveloped by the white light. It was not just this one. The other two airships also fired their cannons. Their attacks instantly enveloped all the griffin warlocks who were attacking them.

In the distance, Anli’s eyes widened. Countless hardwoods grew out of his body and formed a shield in front of him.

Further away, the old man instantly jumped up from his chair and flew over.

The Warlocks in the airships were also dumbfounded. They didn’t expect the airship they were on to have such an offensive method.

The white light lasted for a few seconds before slowly dissipating.

Everyone looked at the battlefield.

In the sky, almost all the griffins had been pierced through. Bowl-sized wounds pierced through them, and every one of them had their eyes wide open as if they were about to cry out. As for the Warlocks, they suffered heavy casualties. Those below the second circle were basically wiped out, and only a few of them survived. Almost half of the third circle were dead, and only twenty or so third circle Warlocks were still in the air.

However, even if they did not die, they all looked rather miserable.

The corpses of the griffins fell to the ground like rain. The lucky survivors of the second circle also fell rapidly. Most of them could not fly.

Even the Warlock Kubiley, who was at the front, had been reduced to ashes after taking the most damage.

The remaining Warlocks were filled with fear as they covered their wounds and flew back.

They didn’t expect the airships to attack, and it was so terrifying.

In the distance, Anli put down the shield that had been attacked a few times. At this moment, the shield was also about to be pierced through.

“What?” His voice trembled slightly in disbelief.

Wasn’t it a flying tool? How could it have such powerful firepower?

If the airships fired again, they would perish immediately.

“Do I have to fight?” Anley gritted his teeth and prepared to move forward.

He didn’t think that the airships would have such firepower. In fact, if the warlocks didn’t get so close, not that many of them would have died.

However, before he could do anything, he felt a hand on his shoulder. He turned around and widened his eyes.

The person pressing down on his shoulder was none other than the Four Seasons Garden’s celestial, and his face was ashen.

“My lord. “Anli’s eyes widened.

“This time, my judgment was wrong, causing so many people to die.” The old Warlock had an ugly expression.

No one expected that the airships would be so powerful.

“Leave the rest to me.”

The reassuring words calmed Anli’s emotions. At this moment, the remaining Warlocks also noticed the arrival of this celestial. They looked at him excitedly.

The survivors of the griffin warlocks looked at the person as he flew into the sky.

Everyone’s eyes were focused.

Their eyes were filled with anticipation.
