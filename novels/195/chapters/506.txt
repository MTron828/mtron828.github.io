507 The Astonished Death

In the darkness, Dani Mauri stood silently outside the grassy ground. He looked calmly at ” Eli ” who came out from afar, and his brows raised slightly.

“Is this Eli? Why are you even weaker than I thought!”

He pondered.

In recent years, the Death Mandala Flower has developed very quickly. It had even threatened them. In order to maintain their status, their forces had been trying their best to encircle the Death Mandala Flower. The results were also very good. Nearly one-third of the higher-ups had been killed by them, including several of Miya’s trusted aides.

The only problem was Miya was missing. He was also looking for her.

Therefore, Azak came to him, so he readily agreed.

After all, although Eli had caused quite a bit of trouble in the past few years, it was really nothing in the eyes of these people. It was just that they did not have the need to get rid of him.

However, the conditions that Azak had offered were sufficient, and he also had a reason to return the favor.

“Looking at the time, they should be surrounding Miya. We can leave after we finish off Eli.” He curled his lips and walked out of the darkness.

He swaggered into the grassi ground without any concealment.

That’s right. In his opinion, assassinating a half-step fifth-circle warlock was a little too embarrassing.

He could just do it head-on!

At this moment, as he appeared, several dozen spell formations were activated on the Grassi ground. Light screens stopped him from advancing, but he only waved his hand lightly. A deathly aura surged out, and the spell formations in front of him gradually turned gray before shattering like mirrors.

Just like that, a few seconds later, he walked into the grassi field and walked towards Eli.

This change attracted all the creatures in the Grassi Land.

Eli turned his head and narrowed his eyes.

The person was wearing a black warlock robe with a blood-red palm drawn on it. He looked like a middle-aged man, but the only thing special about him was his eyes.

It was like a pair of dead fish eyes as if everything was dead.

How many people had he killed?

Most importantly, this person’s aura had already reached the fifth circle.

“Who are you?” Eli didn’t know this person.

“My name is Dani Mauri. Those who are familiar with me call me the Grim Reaper. However, I prefer everyone to call me the Death. That way, it will be more imposing. My job is to kill people for money.” Dani smiled at Eli and replied.

At this moment, Hydra, Nikola, and Dylan had already arrived in front of Eli and were staring at him. Even Hill’s countless tentacles had extended over.

Everyone was not as relaxed as before.

This was because the person in front of them gave them a huge sense of pressure.

Even though he was dozens of meters away, the death aura that followed him like a shadow almost made Nikola’s soul body turn cold. Hydra felt a sense of danger, and Dylan narrowed his eyes.

“He doesn’t look like a half-step fifth circle!” Nikola spoke.

“Hiss hiss!”

“Who is it?” Dylan’s eyes flickered, and his body began to change mechanically as if he was ready to fight at any moment.

“A half-step fifth circle undead, an elemental-like creature, a high-level mechanical creature, and a tree that hasn’t even reached the fourth circle but has a life force that surprises me. It seems like I’ve gained something extra this time!” Dani turned a blind eye to their words, but he observed them with ease.

Especially when he turned around and looked at the tall Hill in the distance, his eyes lit up. The life aura was so dense that it was considered precious even to him.

Feeling completely ignored, their expressions turned ugly.

The Hydra let out a neigh, and its body continued to grow larger. It slowly moved forward, preparing to attack.

But at this moment, a hand stretched out and pulled him back.

” He is at the fifth circle. Retreat!” Eli calmly stood up and asked them to back off.

“Fifth circle?”

After confirming their guesses, their expressions turned ugly.

” Fifth circle? Why is he here?” Nikola looked at Eli, who had already blocked them behind, and his expression was extremely ugly!

Dylan also looked at Eli worriedly.

The fifth circle warlock was not someone that Eli could fight. Could it be that it ended as soon as he regained his memory? Then who will he go to? There wasn’t a single mage in the world right now!

“Yo, you have some knowledge!” Dani smiled when he saw Eli come out!

“Of course, but I’m still very curious about who wants to kill me.” Curiosity flashed in Eli’s eyes. At the same time, his main body, which was far away in the time fragment, left the fragment and returned quickly.

He was stalling for time now.

“Sorry, professional ethics!” Facing a fourth-circle warlock, Dani was really relaxed.

“Then you are not very competent. I think the teacher who brought you in didn’t teach you to fight the enemy head-on, right?” Eli continued to delay.

“Indeed, but it doesn’t matter how you kill the fourth circle minion as long as you complete your goal.” This time, Dani nodded in agreement, but the killing intent in his eyes gradually spread.

A gray aura spread out, and the surrounding lawn began to wither and die.

“It looks like your law is related to death. Not bad!” Eli commented.

“You talk a little too much!” Dani was a little angry.

“I’m willing to talk to you, but that doesn’t mean you can always be so unscrupulous.

“Forget it. I can’t chat anymore. I have other things to do after killing you!”

With a wave of his hand, a gray mist appeared from Dani and flew directly towards Eli.” Eli ” still wanted to resist, but ‘Eli’ collapsed to the ground as if he had lost his strength.

“The true laws are not something that can be understood by a half-step warlock.” Dani waved his hand, and Eli flew towards him before being surrounded by even more gray mist.

His mission this time was not to kill but to take away Eli.

However, as for the others…They were all interesting, so he decided to pack them up and take them away.

The gray fog appeared in his hand again and surged toward a few of them.

At this moment, everyone felt incomparably terrified, especially when they saw the unconscious Eli. No one had expected Eli to be subdued just like that.

“Is it over?” Nikola was in despair.

Who was this fifth circle man?

Hiss!

Hydra was even crazier. When it saw the bound Eli, it twisted its body and charged straight at Dani.

To Hydra, Eli was his master.

Pa!

However, Dani merely waved his hand, and the Hydra’s immense strength was sent flying. In fact, half of the Hydra’s body collapsed, leaving behind only its core and upper half, which smashed heavily into the distant mountain wall!

Bang!

Dust flew everywhere, but Hydra still did not give up. It squirmed its body and looked at Eli in Dani’s hands. It was even preparing to activate the power in the core.

“Loyalty that doesn’t matter!” Dani curled his lips.

For someone who stood at the top of the world’s assassins, he had seen too many similar scenes. He was once a little touched, but after seeing it, he just wanted to crush it!

The gray fog wrapped around them, and he directly bound them, just like Eli. Then, he walked toward Hill. He was very interested in the strange tree at this moment and was ready to dig it out.

“That’s a little too much!”

A voice came from afar!

Who was it?

Dani was stunned. He turned around and saw a man in a red wizard robe looking at him not far away. He looked exactly like Eli.

At this moment, the bound Eli had already dissipated, turning into countless specks of light that flew toward the new Eli.

“A clone?” Dani narrowed his eyes.

Azak had told him about it, but he didn’t seem to care at the time. In addition, the Eli he fought earlier was also a half-step fifth circle warlock, so he naturally felt that that was the real Eli.

Now, it seemed that he had almost made a mistake!

“Wow, you actually dare to come out. You’re a little brave!” He casually threw the bound players far away, then waved his sleeves and looked at Eli.

Nikola, who was not far away, also stared with wide eyes.

“Is it a clone? When did that happen? But Milord, you shouldn’t have come back!” Nikola was confused at first, and then his face was filled with pain. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“Don’t worry!”

Eli waved his hand and looked at the budding warlock in front of him.

When Dani saw the patronizing gaze again, he was a little angry.

In the next second, a gray mist rose up and turned into a hand of death. All the plants in their way died rapidly, and even the soil was corroded bit by bit!

With the power of laws, even a simple application could unleash powerful power.

“Not bad!”

Eli commented.

In the next second, a shadow surged out from behind him and rushed towards the giant hand, instantly tearing it into countless pieces. Then, the shadow flew towards Dani and turned into a palm.

Pa!

Before Dani could react, a huge force surged over.

He flew directly towards the mountain wall at the side, stirring up a lot of smoke and dust, but he did not suffer any injuries. It was as if it was just a slap to him.

This was an insult…However, how could his Hand of Death be broken? It was impossible for it to be broken. Only a law could break his attack. This meant that… Eli was at the fifth circle?

Dani slowly got up and looked at Eli in the distance. His contempt turned into caution.

“Are you a Germinal Warlock?”

He squinted his eyes and asked.

“No!” Ely shook his head.

“You’re lying. You’ve definitely advanced to the fifth circle. Everyone has been deceived by you.” Dani gritted his teeth, his face still stinging from the slap.

“Are you ready?” Eli asked.

He looked at the Hydra that had almost died in the distance, the injured people, and the destroyed environment. This was the first time he had made such a big mistake, and he was very angry.

“Ready?” A hint of doubt flashed in Dani’s eyes.

Eli’s eyes gradually narrowed, and then he said angrily, “Ready to die!”

Dani’s pupils dilated.
