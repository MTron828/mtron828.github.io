151 The Start of the War

On the other side.

After leaving the campsite, Eli transformed into a new face and headed toward his destination.

A few days later, Eli arrived at his first destination, another camp of the shadow lizard Warlock Academy.

Outside the campsite, Eli took a look at the bustling and lively campsite, turned around, and entered a mountain not far from there. He stopped in a small, hidden cave.

Entering the cave, Eli first threw out a dead deer’s corpse, and after making sure that there was no one outside, he took out a bottle, which contained the fungal virus No. 1.

He took out a little of it and threw it on the flesh. In an instant, the fungus covered a small part of the carcass and was growing rapidly.

On the other hand, Eli was expressionless as he took out something that looked like a glass cover. This was a one-time use sorcery tool that he had made. It could give the fungus an environment to suppress its growth and at the same time, trap the fungus so that it would not spread. When the time came, the spiritual power connection could break the glass cover directly, and the fungus would be released directly. This meant that Eli could control the outbreak remotely.

That was what Eli thought. It was simple and comfortable.

After placing the cover properly and setting up some spell formations, Eli left the cave.

He took a look at the cave. With a fireball spell, the entire front of the cave was instantly buried. Then, with a vine spell, a large number of vines grew in this area, covering all traces.

After taking care of this, Eli didn’t stay any longer and headed to the next location.

If the war were really going to last for a long time, then the virus that Eli had to prepare in advance wouldn’t be in just one spot. It would be in the hundreds or even thousands, so Eli was scattering it as he walked.

Occasionally, he would even encounter some animals that would not migrate. He would wrap the fungus in a cover and stuff it into the bodies of these animals. It would not corrode, so he could just detonate it when needed.

A month and ten days passed just like that.

Eli had almost forgotten how many viruses he had set up, and just as he thought that everything was over, an accident still happened.

On this day.

In a mountain forest, Elie had just finished dealing with a new setup when a voice suddenly came from afar.

“What are you doing?”

Turning around, he saw a long-faced man with an aquiline nose standing under a tree. His black eyes were fixed on Eli, and the aura on his body was ready to be unleashed, exuding the aura of a late-stage first-circle warlock.

He had been discovered.

“Oh? ” Eli was stunned. He instantly took out a token and crushed it. The corpse culture medium that was covered by the protective cover in front of him shattered instantly. The corpse and the virus inside dissolved rapidly.

Seeing the evidence disappear, Eli stood up, spread out his hands, and smiled.

“Would you believe me if I said I was just digging?”

“Digging?” Crowe’s mouth twitched.

This area was the shadow lizard Academy’s part that was close to the magic herb field. In order to prevent anyone from causing destruction, he often patrolled the area. Today, he had accidentally bumped into Eli.

“I believe you, but you have to come with me.” Crowe looked at Eli, his eyes sharp.

“Alright,” Eli nodded and took a step towards Crowe. In the next second, his body instantly retreated in the opposite direction, his body quickly leaving in the shadows.

“Stop!” Crowe watched as Eli fled, quickly throwing down a sign on the tree and chasing after him. As he ran, he fired a signal flare.

Whoosh!

The signal flare flew into the sky, and a spark bloomed in the sky. Seven or eight warlocks quickly ran over from the magic herb field in the distance. They looked at the symbol on the tree.

“Someone has sneaked in. Chase!”

The group of warlocks looked at the message and quickly flew in the direction pointed out.

A few warlocks stayed behind to observe the traces, and they noticed the virus carrier Eli had destroyed earlier.

Everyone quickly went over to check. A shadow lizard Warlock covered his hand with scales and touched the ground. He immediately felt a burning sensation, as if his bloodline was burning.

“What’s going on?” The Warlock gasped and quickly retreated.

“What’s wrong?”

“There’s definitely something wrong with this thing, but I don’t know what it is. It might be a virus.” The Warlock frowned as he felt the heat.

Virus?

Everyone knew that this wasn’t simple.

“Quick, let’s go too. We have to catch that Warlock. He must have a sample on him.” The warlocks immediately made a decision.

The chase began.

…

Eli ran away quickly, looking at the group of people behind him, and his mouth twitched.

It would be fine if this mission were not discovered, but once it was, it would be very troublesome.

It seemed that he would have to exhaust his resource again.

“Stop!” Behind him, Crowe had also heard about the virus from the others and shouted angrily. Then, he saw Eli running in front of him, taking out a dozen small balls.

More than a dozen small balls were thrown out in an instant, and they shattered one after another. A thundercloud instantly blocked the way, and the lightning inside scattered in all directions, accompanied by a corrosive liquid.

Acid thundercloud!

A single-use Mage weapon that would probably cost a few hundred magic stones.

In order to escape, Eli didn’t feel any heartache at all.

“Damn it!” Crowe gritted his teeth at the sight.

The power of his bloodline was activated, and a large shadow instantly erupted, ready to rush over.

But a few seconds later, accompanied by a deep, painful cry, Crowe retreated from the thundercloud. His body was covered in wounds and potholes, and there were even traces of electricity.

“Damn. This is a first-circle item. Doesn’t he feel that it’s a waste?”

The level of this one-time-use magic tool was higher than he had expected. He did not expect a sneaky wizard to be so rich that he could take out so many one-time-use magic tools.

“Damn it. Let’s go around the area.” Crowe cursed and said to the dozen people behind him.

The thunderclouds in front of them had spread across the entire area. They had to continue to circle around for a few thousand meters.

Not everyone was as fast as Eli. When Crowe caught up to Eli, there were only three or four warlocks around him.

“Brat, stop!” Crowe was still saying meaningless words.

Without even looking back, Eli cast another acidic thundercloud.

Looking at the thunderclouds in front of them, a few of them became numb again.

What else could they do?

After this round, there were only three people left.

Then, they saw the most ridiculous thing in their lives.

With all sorts of secret escape techniques, Eli was able to move freely in all sorts of places, and dozens of defensive measures were able to block their attacks completely. Eli also used four single-use wizard weapons, acid thunderclouds that were worth nearly 1000 magic stones each. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

An hour later.

Crowe looked around. Other than him, there was no one else in pursuit. But thankfully, Eli was finally blocked by him at a dead end.

“I’ve caught you,” Crowe grinned hideously.

“You run so fast!” Eli looked at the late-stage first-circle Warlock in front of him helplessly. Wouldn’t it be better if he couldn’t catch up? He didn’t want to kill anyone!

“You’re afraid.” Seeing that Eli was sighing, Crowe revealed a sinister smile.

“No, I just don’t want any trouble.” Shaking his head, Eli looked at Crowe, his eyes instantly turning sharp.

Crowe felt that something was wrong.

In the next second, he saw shadows appear around him. White skeletons appeared one after another. Some were human-shaped, and some were magical beasts. Cold undead flames burned, and all the skeletons stared at Crowe.

Cold sweat trickled down Crowe’s forehead. It was fine at first, but as the number of skeletons gradually exceeded a thousand, Crowe knew that this matter might be serious.

Especially when Eli activated his bloodline and emitted an aura that even shocked him, Crowe’s clothes were instantly drenched in a cold sweat. He looked at Eli and forced a smile.

“Would you believe me if I said that this was a misunderstanding? ”

Eli’s golden vertical pupils looked at Crowe, just like how Crowe had looked at him before.

“I do!”

In the next second, all the skeletons swarmed forward, and even Eli rushed over.

Crowe’s mouth twitched, his face full of despair.

Two minutes later.

As Eli’s Dragon Claw struck out, Crowe was trapped by the skeletons around him. In an instant, blood spurted out, and Crowe’s head flew up, his body falling heavily.

The battle was over.

“Sigh, I really just want to leave this place in peace!”

Looking at Crowe’s fallen body, Eli sighed and quickly left the place.

Next, he was ready to end the mission.

Although one-fifth of the points had not been set up, being discovered once was already a very dangerous warning. Eli would not take any more risks. As for what happened to Kratos, it was none of his business. His life was much more precious than anything else.

Next, Eli prepared to head to Tijie’s wizard camp.

When he reached there, he could find someone to help him complete the progress of studying the devouring power.

The location of the campsite was known to him as well. It was something that Tijie had told him a long time ago. However, it might take some time for him to reach the place since they were deep in the mountains.

After taking one last look at the place, Eli turned around and left.

…

Just ten minutes after Crowe’s death.

The warlocks who belonged to the camp finally arrived. However, when they stood in that area and saw that the ground was covered in blood, but there was no trace of Eli or Crowe, everyone was stunned.

“Damn it, why did the lead stop here?” One of the warlocks frowned.

“That doesn’t make sense. They were chasing and fighting at the same time. How could there be no traces? ” The other Warlock frowned.

“Damn it, search!” One of the warlocks ordered.

Under the Warlock’s orders, a group of people began to search the vicinity and soon found some clues.

“There’s something here!” Someone shouted.

Under a big tree, a man saw a golden ring.

“Isn’t this the ring on Lord Crowe’s finger?” Someone identified the ring’s origin.

Everyone was stunned.

Rings were generally not something that could be dropped. This could only mean one thing: master Crowe, who was chasing the enemy, might have died.

“Impossible. How could master Crowe have died? that person just now was at most a middle-stage first-circle Warlock.” One of the warlocks frowned.

“Continue the chase!” Someone said.

“My Lords!”

At this moment, there was a sudden commotion in the distant forest. An apprentice wearing a Warlock’s leather armor ran out, panting. He said anxiously, “The Academy orders everyone to return immediately and cease all activities.”

“What’s wrong?” A hot-tempered Warlock grabbed the apprentice and asked.

“The war… the war has begun.”

The apprentice was grabbed, but he still said in fear.

War?

Everyone was stunned.
