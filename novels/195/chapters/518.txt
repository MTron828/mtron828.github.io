519 The Right Time, the Right Place, and the Right Person

“So that’s how it is!”

Looking at the fallen body of Azak in front of him, it dawned on Eli.

He had already left the front line and returned to the Grassi Land. He had also performed a Soul Search on Azak and finally understood why this guy was obsessed with him.

So it was because of Gray Wizard Tower!

Azak was right!

The only unfortunate thing was that he had underestimated Eli’s strength. In the end, he made a mistake step by step. In the beginning, he had involved a few Germinal Warlocks, but in the end, he involved the ancestor and the entire family. He had destroyed his own family with his own strength.

He really had great wisdom!

“But since the ruins of the eastern region can actually be linked to Dylan, it seems that I have to start planning for the wizard tower. Since the Hamis family can find clues, it’s inevitable that the other families will also find them.” Based on what happened to Azak, Eli thought of more.

“Forget it, I’ll wait for a while.” But after thinking for a while, Eli decided to give up for now.

The destruction of the Hamis family’s high-end combat power had a huge impact on the Bloodline Tower, the Warlock Union, and even the world. The following period of time would definitely not be peaceful.

“Troubled times!”

He just wanted to develop properly. Why, why did all kinds of things always come to him?

Eli was extremely melancholic.

However… There were many sad things, but there were also surprises.

” The collection of a top-notch family!” Eli rubbed his palms.

He was looking forward to it.

At this time, the Bloodline Tower’s army had already crossed the border and entered the Hamis family. Many Celestial Sorcerers had even marched straight into Hamis City, preparing to take down this ancient city!

“I hope everything goes smoothly!”

Eli quietly cleaned up Azak’s body and walked toward the spell formation.

Enter and activate.

Once again, he entered the Time Fragment World. This time, Eli walked further in and finally stopped at 200 times the time flow. This was all because of his previous advancement!

..

While Eli meditated, the Bloodline Tower’s army also quickly entered the territory of the Hamis family. Countless celestials acted as vanguards to plunder, while countless Warlocks steadily occupied the territory of the central region.

This was because the Hamis family’s territory was too big, almost as big as the Western Region. Although the surrounding areas were not directly connected to the Warlock Union’s families, one could imagine that when the Hamis family was destroyed, all the forces received the news and began to devour the land.

Eli naturally had no hope of occupying all of them. He just needed to take down most of them. As for the other places, they would have to plunder resources. This was also the reason why the celestials had acted first.

Alida was in charge of all this, which gave him a headache.

Fortunately, the various factions were still immersed in shock and did not dare to act rashly. This made their operation much smoother.

At this moment.

Eastern Region!

Sea Dragon and Patriarch Sea Shark looked at each other.

“Cough cough, it seems that we have underestimated Sir Eli!” Sea Dragon’s leader said awkwardly. He had inadvertently changed the way he addressed Eli from ‘little friend’ to ‘Sir’.

“That’s right. Who would have thought that Sir Eli was a Thousand Leaf Warlock? It seems that the one from ten years ago wasn’t him. On the contrary, he might have already advanced to the fifth circle, but he had been pretending to be a fourth circle. No wonder he had always been aloof from the world.” Patriarch Sea Shark nodded in agreement.

“Yeah!” The Sea Dragon Clan’s head was also in a daze.

Who would have thought that Eli was actually a Thousand Leaves warlock!?

Even the top three families of the Warlock Union were only at this level. This meant that even the Warlock Union would not dare to underestimate him, not to mention that the Hamis family had disappeared!

“However, for an ancient family to disappear just like that, and one of the six great families of the Warlock Union at that, it really feels like a lifetime has passed. It’s like a huge mountain has suddenly disappeared!”

Phew.

The two of them let out a long sigh at the same time as if they had relaxed a lot.

A few seconds later, the head of the Sea Dragon Clan looked at Sea Shark and said, “Patriarch Sea Shark, do you remember the message we rejected last time?”

“You mean…” Patriarch Sea Shark narrowed his eyes.

The head of the Sea Dragon Clan nodded in agreement.

“Good!”

Patriarch Sea Shark seemed to understand something. They smiled in tacit understanding.

“Alliance!”

In the Eastern Region, the head of the Wind God Yaolong clan slowly read these words.

After the Hamis family was destroyed, Eli became the leader. He had both strength and prestige. If he could form an alliance, it would be a once-in-a-millennium opportunity. This was the first thought that came to his mind after his shock.

“Moreover, Eli is going to face the entire Warlock Union. With our help, the Bloodline Tower will have a much easier time, and we will be able to get rid of the huge mountain of the Warlock Union!”

They had no choice. They had been waiting for this day for too long.

“We will be free from the sea of suffering, and Eli will become our new… King!”

He pursed his lips, and his eyes were burning with flames.

At the same time, countless factions had the same thought. They were all trembling with excitement. As for the reason, it was related to Jin Ji’s failed operation.

It was a pity that the time was not ripe, but now, the time was just right.

It was the right time, the right place, and the right people.

Unlike these family heads, the world of ordinary Warlocks was completely different. At this moment, they were still immersed in the shock of this fact and could not understand it for a long time.

An ancient bloodline family had disappeared just like that in the hands of Eli.

The people who were oppressed by the Warlock Union were excited, while the families under the Warlock Union were terrified. Because in their eyes, the six families were the heavens, high and mighty, but today, the heavens were broken!

So… The six families would also be destroyed. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

In just a day, this news spread across the entire continent.

As for Eli’s name, it also spread. Originally, only a portion of the people in the western and central regions knew of Eli’s name, but after a day, 95% of the Warlocks already knew of this name.

Countless power of faith gathered toward Eli.

Time Fragment World!

Eli’s mouth was wide open as he watched the nine-leaf lotus flower on his wrist, which was originally empty, fill up at speed visible to the naked eye. In just half an hour, one lotus leaf was filled up.

“Isn’t this too fast?”

Eli gasped, feeling that this was just the beginning.

Three days later!

Eli lowered his head and looked at his wrist. At this moment, the lotus flower on his wrist had already split into eighteen petals, and each petal had been filled up, emitting a faint golden light.

Not only was it filled with the power of faith that had been stripped of the laws of the black fog, but there were also 11 new petals. Considering that each petal was more difficult than the last, one could imagine how difficult it was to obtain the power of faith this time.

“However, just having more people wouldn’t be enough. It seems like the Warlocks in the Central Continent are being persecuted by the Warlock Union!” Eli sighed. This reminded him of a saying in his previous life, and the world had suffered for a long time.

The Warlock families had also suffered from the Warlock Alliance for a long time.

“But it’s none of my business.”

However, Eli didn’t think much of it. This was because Alida had just sent him a message that the Hamia family’s gains had been sorted out.

Time to harvest!
