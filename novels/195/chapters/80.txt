81 Investigation and Action

Having been in Jun Lin for so many years, Eli wasn’t someone to be trifled with. He had his own information channels, and he quickly found out about the Othello family.

“Sir, Othello’s family is the Corsi family. The family was given a title of nobility thirty years ago because Othello’s grandfather made a contribution. They are still firm supporters of the royal family.”

In a room, Eli’s appearance had already changed to another look. He was listening to the person in front of him. The man was an information broker.

“Well, did you find out about their family’s main business? ” Eli asked.

“Well, their family doesn’t seem to have any business at the moment!” The man replied.

“Huh?” Eli was puzzled.

“Yes, indeed, they don’t have any assets. Once, the Corsi family accumulated their first round of wealth through loans, but as time developed, they gradually gave up on this grey business. After that, they mainly made profits by reselling goods through contact with the major Chambers of Commerce.” The man said seriously. In fact, they rarely dug up info on the nobles, but the gentleman in front of him was really offering too much.

“Hmm, a Chamber of Commerce?” Eli raised his eyebrows. It seemed like there was a chance!

“Well, what about the connection behind them? ” Eli asked again.

“My lord, their family’s connection seems to be mainly with the Zara family, an earl family with a long history. Every year, the Corsi family has to fork out a lot of money to them. ”

“Tell me what else you know.” Eli nodded, indicating for the man to continue.

There wasn’t much information about the Corsi family, mainly about their assets, background, connections, and other aspects. Soon, Eli had recorded all the information.

If he wanted to have a fight, he would have to first ask around and make sure that the other party was someone he could deal with. Otherwise, he wouldn’t casually make a move.

And from the man’s information, Eli also found out about an interesting point.

The background of the Corsi family, the Zara family, was a vassal of one of the Alina family’s old rivals, Marquis Herm’s family. This was interesting.

“I think I have an idea!”

after paying, he turned around and left.

...

That afternoon, at Alina’s family, Eli and Alex were sitting opposite each other.

“What’s the matter? I heard that something had happened at the library. Do you want me to help your teacher? ” Compared to before, Alex was now almost 40 years old, but his body was still strong and powerful, and his eyes were full of energy.

He looked at Eli and asked with a smile.

In fact, over the years, whenever he had a problem, he would often ask Eli for advice, and Eli would always give him some good advice. It was just that Eli didn’t ask for anything in return, which annoyed him.

This time, he had finally come.

“I do need your help this time!” said Eli directly. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

His thoughts were simple. Rather than attacking Othello, it would be better to attack his family.

As long as the Corsi family was greatly affected, Othello would crumble.

“It’s like this...” Eli began to narrate.

“So what do you want me to do? Help you hold back the Herm family?” Alex didn’t quite understand.

“Right!” Eli nodded.

“How will you solve the problem of the Zara family and the trade association? ” Alex was a little confused.

” you don’t have to worry about that. don’t worry, you’ll get a share of the profits from the Corsi family’s business. ” Eli laughed.

“Alright, it doesn’t really matter. the herm family has always been our old rival, so these are just small matters. ” Alex said indifferently.

Compared to all this, he was more focused on Eli.

This man, who seemed to be content with the library, was actually a very smart person. He was completely uninterested in fame and fortune, and he had never even seen a lack of money. He was a strange person.

“Well, that’s all for now. I’ll take my leave.” Eli chatted with him for a while before leaving.

...

Rose Chamber of Commerce.

“No problem!” Roland immediately agreed. Unlike Alex, he was much more mellow than he had been ten years ago.

“it’s a small matter. Don’t worry. The Rose Chamber of Commerce is no longer the small Chamber of Commerce it was in the past. These are small problems.” Roland agreed immediately after hearing what Eli said.

Although outsiders thought that he had only managed to get through the crisis ten years ago because he had established a connection with the Kazan Chamber of Commerce, Roland knew the truth.

“Hmm, will this affect you?” Eli asked.

“No, it’s just a channel. if it’s broken, there will naturally be new channels coming up.” Roland said indifferently.

“Okay. Actually, after this is over, I plan to split this profit with an old friend of ours and a noble friend of mine. You’ll get a share too. It’s not much, so I hope you won’t mind.” Eli said with a smile.

“Of course, I won’t!” Roland laughed.

Then, Roland started a familiar topic.

“Eli, when are you getting married?”

“See you next time!” Ere hurriedly walked out of the Rose Chamber of Commerce.

...

In the afternoon.

“No problem, Mr. Eli. I’ll definitely get it done for you.” Zhong Li said fawningly. “Don’t worry. Our Chamber of Commerce has deep connections with other foreign Chambers of Commerce. You can rest assured. I’ll keep this matter strictly confidential and won’t tell anyone.” Zhong Li said solemnly.

He had been sent by Aria and was the person he trusted the most. In order to ensure Eli’s safety, he had even placed Zhong Li’s family somewhere he could see so that it wouldn’t affect him.

Zhong Li and Eli knew this very well.

Aria was still very sensible now.

“Okay, then I’ll be leaving. Oh right, I still need some magic beast blood. Help me find it.” After dealing with this matter, Eli continued.

“Alright!” Zhong Li nodded. It would be difficult, but they would do their best.

“Alright, I’ll take my leave.” Eli nodded and left again.

...

At night.

The castle of the Gimori family.

“You’re giving me a present?!” Rias was wearing a purple dress, lazily sitting on the sofa, smiling at Eli.

She was more mature and less lively than before, but she was more sensible.

“Yes, but do I need your help.” Eli laughed.

“Okay, no problem. I agree,” said Leah.

“Aren’t you going to ask what it is?” Eli said with a strange expression.

“no need. I believe you. Would you harm me? ”

“I won’t!”

“Then that’s it.” Rias looked at Eli and answered with a smile.

“Thank you.” Eli then told Leah what had happened.

“Alright!” After listening, Rias agreed without hesitation.

“I’m done here. Do you want to go for a drink?” rias stood up and invited him.

“I don’t think so. It’s very late!” Eli refused!

“Late? It’s only 11 O ‘clock. You’ve stayed here much later than that. Come on, let’s catch up.” Rias covered her mouth and laughed.

“Alright then!” Eli agreed helplessly.

“I’ll just drink a little.”
