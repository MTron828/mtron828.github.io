305 Jin Ji’s Gift

In the main tower of the bloodline tower.

In the living room.

The two of them sat opposite each other on the sofa, and the guards at the side respectfully poured tea for them.

“Mr. Collina, this is the unique blue sound tea of our West Coast. It’s very sweet. You should give it a try. I’ve already informed Sir Herman. He’ll probably be here soon!” Aisha sat on the sofa and looked across.

Opposite her was a middle-aged Warlock with a small beard. He was wearing a golden Warlock robe, and his hands were full of rings. He even held a short staff in his right hand!

“It doesn’t matter. I have a lot of time!” Collina picked up the teacup and took a small sip.

“Sir, what do you need from master Herman? is there anything I can help with? ” Aisha asked curiously.

She had never expected the Golden Cicada Chamber of Commerce to pay her a visit.

This was because the Golden Cicada Chamber of Commerce had also given up on this place decades ago. Everything about them had disappeared. However, this time, they had actually put in so much effort to come here. It was hard for her not to think too much.

“I do have something to give to master Herman.” Collina smiled but did not continue.

Aisha did not ask any more questions when Collina stopped talking.

The two of them fell into silence.

Time passed by slowly. Suddenly, footsteps could be heard in the distance. A man pushed open the door and walked in.

“Grandmaster!”

Aisha immediately stood up when she saw the man.

Eli nodded at Alice, then looked at the man opposite her.

The day before, when he heard that the Golden Cicada Chamber of Commerce had arrived, he sped up and set off for the bloodline tower. There was only one reason, and that was that at the same time, he had received a message from Jin Ji, whom he had not contacted for hundreds of years.

The message was simple. He just told Eli that the item had arrived!

At that time, Eli’s heart started beating fast because he had only asked Jin ji for one thing, and that was to help him find enough information to advance to celestial.

Eli looked at the man who was dressed like a member of the Golden Cicada Chamber of Commerce. Before he could speak, Collina had already stood up and quickly extended his hand to Eli’s side. He said respectfully, “You must be Sir Herman.”

“Yes, and you are?” Eli nodded.

“My name is Collina. You can call me Cori!” Collina was all smiles.

Aisha’s mouth twitched as she looked at him.

‘You didn’t look at me like this just now. You were judging me!’

“What’s your purpose?”

“I’m sure Lord Jin Ji has already told you that I’ve come to deliver something to you.” After confirming his identity, Collina did not waste any time. He took out a space ring and handed it to Eli. “My Lord, this is what my Lord asked me to give you!”

Eli took the ring.

During this process, the two of them waited quietly on the side.

Aisha, on the other hand, saw a smile slowly appearing on Eli’s face as if he was very satisfied with the item. This made her very curious as to what could make her Grandmaster so happy.

A few seconds later, Eli recovered and said to Collina, “Thank you very much!”

“It’s my great honor to serve Lord and Lord Jin Ji!” Collina placed his right hand on his chest and said humbly.

“it seems like Jin Ji is doing well in the central continent. I’m quite curious about his situation. Can you tell me? ” Eli looked at him and asked.

The moment he entered, he had already observed Collina once.

This was a Warlock at the peak of his third circle.

For a third circle peak sorcerer to come all the way here to deliver something, it was obvious that Jin Ji didn’t rely on his strength but his influence!

“Of course, you can!” Collina nodded and smiled.

As Eli was observing him, he was also observing Eli.

He was also very curious as to what kind of person could make Lord Jin Ji respect him so much. He had been told by Jin Ji many times before he came, but he had never seen Lord Jin Ji like that.

In his impression, Lord Jin Ji was always full of fighting spirit, a genius who would never yield to anyone, even when facing a celestial.

But when he really stood in front of Eli, he realized that something was wrong.

Although this person had a third circle, his aura made him feel like he was facing a celestial.

Was this reasonable … This was not logical!

Although he had never fought him before, he felt that even ten of him might not be able to defeat Eli. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

He knew that this was ridiculous, but it was indeed based on his intuition.

Soon, they sat down on the couches, and Collina began to tell them about ginji’s situation.

“Lord Jin Ji just reached his third circle not long ago. At the same time, he became the Golden Cicada of the Golden Cicada Chamber of Commerce. You must know that he’s only two hundred years old.

“Other than that, Lord Jin Ji is the most compatible Warlock with the Golden Cicada bloodline I’ve ever seen. With his talent, he’ll definitely advance to fourth circle in the future as long as there are no accidents.

“Ever since Lord Jin Ji came to the central continent, he had also taken over a portion of the Chamber of Commerce’s business. At first, everyone had thought that Lord Jin Ji was just a bumpkin from the West Coast, so how could he have strong business skills?

“However, Lord Jin Ji showed them. In just a few decades, the performance of his branch rose to the top among the middle-to-low class. I also joined the chamber at that time!”

Collina told Jin ji’s story.

Eli didn’t expect so many things to happen after the little ones went to the bloodline tower. As expected of someone blessed by fate, he was really fierce.

Aisha’s eyes also lit up.

She also had some expectations for the central continent.

“However, my lord has not been having a good time recently!” Then, Collina shook his head and sighed.

...

“What’s wrong?” Eli asked.

“It’s like this. Although Lord can always make very accurate decisions, due to the Holy tower incident and the struggle between various forces, we have made a huge profit in the process, but we have also made others jealous. Someone has placed a curse on Lord, causing Lord’s bloodline to be constantly eroded!” Collina said angrily.

“A curse?” Eli had a strange expression.

Was it related to the war? Didn’t that mean it had something to do with him?

This fate was truly wonderful!

But if it weren’t for Collina, Eli wouldn’t have found this out about Jin Ji.

However, since he knew about it, he couldn’t just ignore it. After all, Jin Ji had brought him a big gift.

“Wait a moment!” Eli stood up and suddenly left the room.

Collina and Aisha were also confused, but they still waited.

Three minutes later, Eli returned.

However, this time, he had a crystal in his hand. It was a Dark Crystal with a transparent shell, but there was a visible shadow inside.

...

He threw this to Collina.

Collina caught it in a hurry.

“My Lord, what are you doing?” Collina looked at the crystal, not quite understanding.

“This can help Jin Ji!” Eli sat back in his seat and said while looking at him.

“What?” Collina’s eyes widened in disbelief.

“You’ll know when you get back. Let’s have some tea first!” He said. Eli understood what he was thinking and waved his hand to signal him to calm down.

However, Collina couldn’t calm down at this time. Jin ji had been cursed for several years, and even his bloodline had begun to decline. This was a very terrible thing.

It would be great if the problem could be solved.

Could this be the reason why Lord Jin Ji had him come here?

Collina seemed to have suddenly realized something.

So it was like this.

“Thank you, my Lord!” Collina calmed down and thanked Eli.

“Have some tea!” Eli only smiled and didn’t say anything.

Previously, it was an investment. This was the first round of financing!

Time passed by slowly, and in the blink of an eye, half a day had passed.

“Lord Collina, how many days are you going to stay here?” Aisha asked.

“I’m ready to leave immediately!”

Collina had thought of staying for a few days, but he didn’t have any thoughts at the moment. He just wanted to fly back to the central continent as soon as possible. Master Jin ji needed something from master Herman.

“Alright, then.” Alice nodded.

That afternoon.

Alice and Eli sent off the anxious Collina.

Alice and Eli returned as they watched the airship slowly take off into the sky.

On the way, Alice could no longer hold back his curiosity and asked Eli, “Grandmaster, what exactly did the Golden Cicada Chamber of Commerce give to teacher?”

“Hope!” Eli replied calmly.

The information on advancing to the celestial realm was hope for him.

“Hope!”

Aisha was completely dumbfounded!
