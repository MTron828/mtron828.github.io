72 Returning to the Empire

“Aria, I am about to leave. Let’s talk about the Business Alliance.”

In a luxurious room, Eli sat on the main seat while Eli sat on the ground.

This was the Kazan Chamber of Commerce, and today, Eli was here to see Aria for the last time.

“Yes, my lord.” Aria nodded respectfully.

After such a long period of turmoil, the Kazan Chamber of Commerce was now completely in his hands. As for Victor, he had long been eliminated and expelled from Duoling.

It was already very kind of him not to kill his uncle directly.

Outside, he was the boss of the largest Kazan Chamber of Commerce in the Lorraine Kingdom, but only he knew that he was now equivalent to a tool. Everything belonged to the young scholar named Eli in front of him.

These days, Eli was very famous in Duoling. Aria had easily collected a lot of information about him, but the more he knew, the more afraid he became. The main thing was that he did not know anything about Eli at all.

“Sir, the Alliance between the two countries has been formed. When the time comes, the two countries will have more contact. Our Kazan Chamber of Commerce will also open a branch in Jun Lin. When the time comes, you can contact them directly. No matter what you need, I will find it for you.” Aria said respectfully.

Eli nodded in satisfaction.

Didn’t he help Aria with this purpose in mind?

“Oh, there’s something else I need you to deal with.” As if remembering something, Eli suddenly spoke.

“Please speak.”

“There’s a rose Chamber of Commerce in Junlin. I heard that they’d encountered some trouble with raw materials recently. You should know what to do, right? ” Eli cast a glance at Aria.

“I understand, my Lord.” Aria was not a fool, and he understood what he meant.

“Oh, then we’ll stop here for today. I’ll take my leave first.” Eli picked up his hat from the table beside him, put it on, and headed straight for the door.

“I’ll send you off!”

Aria stood up immediately.

“No need. Also, don’t do those little tricks. If there’s a second time, I’ll just kill you.” Eli shook his head and spoke in a very normal tone.

Aria was stunned.

“Yes, my lord.” Aria’s breathing quickened, and he lowered his head.

“Yes, I’ll punish you slightly this time. It won’t be so simple next time.” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Eli pushed the door open and walked out.

The next second.

A low groan of pain came from the room behind!

...

The Black Dragon flag fluttered again.

The convoy from the Bryne Empire slowly set off from Duoling city and exited the city gate.

Sitting in the carriage, Eli watched as the bustling city of Duoling gradually disappeared from his sight. He slowly pulled down the curtain and sat in the carriage, his heart filled with emotions.

His first trip was over.

It had been almost three months, but he felt as if it had been a long time. It was mainly because this was his first time going out, so he had such a feeling.

However, he had also gained a lot. First, he had obtained control of a large Chamber of Commerce, which would make it easier for him to earn money in the future. He also had a larger and newer supply channel for materials.

The second thing was to obtain Weiss’ legacy, which filled him with anticipation. He wanted to know what Saleen Metatrin’s student had left behind. He had actually obtained the box a few days ago but found that it was locked. In order to avoid damaging the items inside, he had not opened the box. However, he had already carved out the key.

Oh, and he also got two other things from the Queen. They were two very valuable items worth at least five hundred gold tarls.

After all, there was nothing else with magic in the cave. Even if there was, it would have been eaten by the spiders, so he could only choose the more valuable items.

It was the same for his teacher. Thus, it could be predicted that his teacher would achieve freedom in wealth for a long time in the future.

As for what was in the box, eli decided to wait until they got back. After all, they were in a convoy, and there were too many people. If anything happened, it would be even more troublesome.

At night, the convoy stopped at a place to rest.

“Let’s go out and eat something.”

After alighting from the carriage, Eli looked back. Compared to the usual carriage he had, his current carriage was much more luxurious. Both the materials and decorations were far better than before, and this one was not far from Marquis Alina’s carriage.

It was said that this was a special order from Marquis Alina. Of course, scholar Clement’s treatment was almost the same. This was a change in status.

He followed the soldier into a tent. At this time, there were only some high-ranking people in the tent, such as some great nobles and a Grand scholar. Eli ignored them and found a place to sit down and eat.

The others, on the other hand, glanced at him from time to time, looking at him with admiration.

“Eli, come here and eat with us!” suddenly, marquis Alina, who was in the middle of the hall, waved his hand, signaling for Eli to come over. Eli nodded and walked over.

” Eli, you’ve done a great job this time. Don’t worry. I’ll definitely tell his majesty the king. He might even personally summon you! ” Marquis Alina looked at Eli with a satisfied expression.

“This time, the credit goes mainly to my teacher. I’m just an assistant!” Eli replied with a smile.

It was still fine in the Lorraine Kingdom, even if he was summoned by the Queen. However, if this matter were to be brought back to Jun Lin city, the possibility of it spreading in the city was high. Eli had no intention of meeting the king.

“You’re still so humble!” As he ate, Marquis Alina asked, “I heard you’re not married yet, right? Do you want me to introduce you to someone? The Alina family has many beautiful girls!”

“No need, thank you, Lord Marquis. Oh, right, Lord Marquis, what do you think of the Lorraine Kingdom?” Eli quickly changed the topic.

“The Lorraine Kingdom has a good Queen!” Marquis Alina thought for a moment before replying.

“I don’t know if His Majesty’s idea of an alliance is a good thing, but I know that if we don’t stop their development, it will be a problem for Bryne in the future, ” he said.

Marquis Alina seemed to be interested and began to analyze the situation for Eli in detail.

“Oh, is that so?” On the other side, Eli was eating quickly.

“Hey, why are we talking about this? Let’s talk about why you’re not married yet!” A few minutes later, Marquis Alina suddenly realized that something was wrong.

“Lord Marquis, I’ve finished eating!” But by then, Eli had already finished eating, so he bade farewell and left the tent.

Marquis Alina looked at Eli’s back and smiled.

What a good kid.
