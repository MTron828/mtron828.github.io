511 Attacks from the Hamis Family

A month later!

Grassi Land, Mage Tower’s bottom floor.

A rather huge magic formation was situated here, emitting faint spatial fluctuations.

“Finally!” Eli stood at the side and sighed.

The creation of the teleportation spell formation in the time world fragment was far more difficult than Eli had imagined. Not only did he have to resist the huge consumption of time, but he also had to consider the spatial instability of the world fragment itself. This made the difficulty of creating a spatial spell formation greatly increased!

Fortunately, he had enough resources and good skills. After spending about a month, he finally succeeded in creating one. It would greatly facilitate his future travel between the spatial fragments!

“This is also beneficial for me to hide my main body’s location!” Eli smiled and walked out of the wizard tower.

When the door opened, it was a grassi field, but not far away. There was a large bare area. It was like a bald spot, seriously hindering Eli’s mood.

“Sigh. Although the power of laws has been cleared by the devouring power, the aura left behind will probably take a few months to recover. The influence of laws on these things is still too great.” Eli sighed.

This was also one of the reasons why the mages of the previous era had banned mages above the fifth circle from fighting within the world. This was because the aftermath of a battle between mages at this stage would have a far greater impact on the world than that of a fourth circle.

This was also because Eli had used his devouring power to devour the Laws of Death. Otherwise, the aftershock would have taken the world decades to recover.

“Unfortunately, although the devouring power can devour these laws, it is not complete.” Eli shook his head with emotion. After all, the rules he comprehended were separated from the shadow rules and had already deviated a little from the shadow. Therefore, the power was not as great as he had imagined. There was still a lot of room for improvement.

Of course, this upgrade was very difficult, and perhaps Eli would never be able to achieve it in his entire life.

“But that might not be the case!”

As he was thinking, he had already reached the other side of the valley, where Hill was.

At this moment, Hill was even bigger than before. She was 150 meters tall, and the life force she emitted was even stronger as if she would explode at any time.

Eli knew that Hill was getting closer and closer to the fourth circle!

“Father!” At this moment, a crisp voice sounded. It was Hill’s voice.

“Mm, remember to remind me when you break through. I’ll protect you!” Eli smiled. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Hill understands!” Hill replied.

“Yes!” Eli nodded and turned to look at the other side. Not far away, a huge creature was entrenched. It was Hydra. In front of him was a small mountain of high-grade ores that had been swallowed by it.

The current Hydra was clearly much better than its damaged body a month ago. Most of its body had recovered, and only a small portion had not!

” Being invaded by the laws of death once might not be a bad thing. This makes the Hydra’s elements even more condensed. Perhaps, as long as there’s a material of sufficient quality, it won’t be a dream for it to advance to five-circle!” Eli secretly observed.

After observing for a while, Eli confirmed that Hydra had indeed benefited from a disaster. He turned around and entered the Wizard Tower, then headed to the time world fragment.

Meditation!

..

Three months in the outside world was 54 years in the time world fragment.

“I failed again!”

In the Time world Fragment, Eli sighed as he felt that the law condensation had failed again.

Breaking through to the Thousand Leaves Realm was different from the Divine Tree. The first two stages were to keep improving, and there would not be any bottlenecks. However, the third stage was to condense the leaves of the laws, which was to add a little more decoration to the tree of laws.

Condensing the power of laws into leaves was also the difference between the two ranks. Moreover, his combat strength would once again achieve a certain degree of a leap, producing a qualitative change!

“But it should be soon. Maybe I’ve been too tense recently. Let’s go out for a walk!” Eli thought about it and decided to go out for a walk.

Crossing the spatial spell formation and returning to the warlock world!

Eli walked out of the tower and found Nikola waiting at the door.

“Did something happen?” Eli asked curiously.

“Sir, I was just about to knock on the door.” Nikola smiled and handed over a letter. “Lord, Miya sent someone here yesterday to deliver a letter to you.”

“A letter?”

Eli took the envelope curiously.

Recently, the Death Mandala Flower and the Grim Reaper caused a commotion in the Central Region. Miya still had the time to write a letter. It seemed that the situation had basically stabilized.

He opened the letter and started reading.

But a few seconds later, he frowned.

“Sir, what happened?” Nikola saw that Eli was frowning and understood what might have happened.

“Ask Alida to arrange for the Bloodline Tower to enter Level One Alert.” Eli put down the letter and said calmly.

“Level one alert!”

Nikola widened his eyes in disbelief.

Level 1 alert was the highest level. It meant that they were ready for war at any time or even the possibility of death.

“Sir, what happened?” Nikola asked anxiously.

” Just yesterday, there was another regular meeting of the Warlock Alliance. However, at this meeting, the Hamis Family presented a lot of evidence of me colluding with Roland and proposing a destructive attack on the Bloodline Tower. The one who carried it out was the Hamis Family, and the Alliance also passed the proposal!” Eli explained calmly.

“What is this? How could they frame us like this?” Nikola was furious.

Although they had an unclear relationship with the dragons, they definitely had nothing to do with that mage. At least, he had never seen that ” Roland ” here.

Nikola kept scolding the Hamis family, and even Ely was a little embarrassed.

“It’s not a false accusation!”

“It’s not a false accusation…What was that? It’s not a false accusation!” Nikola first repeated, then jumped up and stared at Eli with his mouth agape.

“I forgot to tell you that Roland is my clone,” Eli pursed his lips and told Nikola the news that he had been hiding for a long time.

Silence!

Nikola was silent!

He lowered his head, and the corners of his mouth twitched. It took him a few minutes to recover. “Sir, your hidden identity is really… something else!”

Eli smiled faintly, but his eyes gradually darkened, but he did not panic.

The Hamis family was strong, but not unreasonably strong!

In addition to the report, the letter also included the battle plan of the Hamis family.

” There are countless people below the fourth circle, hundreds of them are Radiant Suns, and there is nearly thirty active half-step fifth circle. Currently, the Hamis family should have three to five Germinal Warlocks and one to two Divine Tree Warlocks!”

Eli blinked his eyes. This was the first time he knew about the Hamis family’s combat power.

It was really…Unexpectedly weak!

The highest was only a divine tree. However, Eli quickly understood that a fifth circle warlock only had a lifespan of about 5,000 years. According to the laws of the current world, the consumption of life was almost terrifying.

Being able to reach the fifth circle was already a genius. Even if one reached the fifth circle, they would immediately enter the outer space of the Mage World. That would reduce the consumption, but there was also a limit.

Therefore, there were even cases where people who had broken through to the fifth ring did not live as long as those with the fourth circle. This short lifespan made it even more difficult to break through. It was already a rare genius who had broken through to the Divine Tree in a thousand years!

However, this was a great thing for him!

“As a top family, I’m sure they have a lot of resources that I need.”

A smile appeared on Eli’s face as if he was looking forward to it.

His equipment had not been updated for a long time!

Nikola, who was not far away, was shocked. He looked into Eli’s eyes and felt something different.

“It’s like seeing prey!”

Nikola’s throat moved slightly. He was a little shocked.
