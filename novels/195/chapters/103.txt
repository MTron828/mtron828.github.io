104 A Change in Mentality

However, nothing seemed to have happened this time.

After a few more human experiments, and after he confirmed that the medicine was effective …

The next day.

In the laboratory.

Eli first recorded his mental power at 23.0. It was only a one-point increase since his return to Jun Lin. The main thing was that Eli was increasingly aware of the problem with his own qualifications. His talent was really very ordinary, and he had an inexplicable feeling that the concentration of the elements around him seemed to be ordinary too.

Of course, this might have something to do with the fact that Eli didn’t spend all his time on meditation. After all, no apprentice would spend most of their time on experiments and learning. Most of them would only do a small number of experiments and focus their energy on meditation.

On the other hand, Eli was the exact opposite. He could only be said to be a freak among the mages.

However, it was still alright. The main thing was that he had a lot of time, so he was not in a hurry.

After some simple preparations, Eli took out the khorium 2 that he had concocted, which could also be called the blood bamboo flower potion.

Looking at the bright red potion vibrating in the potion bottle, the traces of blood turned into tentacles, swaying wantonly as if trying to grab something, Eli opened the potion and directly consumed this strange potion.

As the potion entered his body, Eli’s entire body trembled.

The blood-colored potion was like a tentacle, grabbing the outside of Eli’s cells. Eli could feel his life force flowing away directly, but at the same time, traces of mental power slowly appeared and gathered in his brain.

Eli could feel that his spiritual power was indeed improving.

Although the effect of this potion was a little strange, the effect was still good.

However, he was the only one who could use it. If others used it, they would probably lose more than half of their vitality instead of improving their mental power. It was not worth it, especially in this world where there seemed to be not enough vitality.

In the end, the blood-red Tentacle slowly disappeared, and the potion was used up.

After it ended, Eli’s spiritual power was 23.5.

With a 0.5 increase at once, it seemed that the potion was quite powerful. Of course, this was not taking into account the cost of losing 20 years of life for an ordinary wizard.

The price and reward were not proportional at all. Fortunately, what Eli was doing was a business without capital.

“It’s really evil!” Even now, Eli still found the blood bamboo flower strange. This plant was so f*cking ridiculous.

Shaking his head, Eli digested his newly improved mental power and felt a little happy.

It seemed that nothing bad had happened this time!

Half a month later, just as Eli had digested the effects of the potion and was about to brew the next bottle, a servant arrived and brought bad news to him.

Countess Gimori’s condition had suddenly taken a turn for the worse. She was going to die soon.

Ka!

The reagent bottle in his hand fell to the ground, and Eli closed his eyes. After a long silence, he said, “Take me to her.”

Damn it. It was exactly as he had predicted.

At a certain period of time, he might encounter a large wave of people dying, and it seemed to be around this time.

At this moment, Eli was already 75 years old, and his friend was already at the point of death.

Sitting in the carriage that was heading towards the territory of the Gimori family, Eli closed his eyes and let out a long sigh. His feelings were complicated and melancholic.

Unlike Alex’s friendship, Herman’s brotherly relationship, and Hila’s mutual admiration, Rias was undoubtedly very special.

Although the two of them had once been alone under the moon, they had not been together.

But even Eli had to admit that Rias had feelings for him.

“Forget it,” he said. With a sigh, Eli decided not to think about this and decided to talk about it when they met.

The carriage quickly brought him to his destination.

Eli walked in quickly, and the guards at the door did not stop him. The guards all knew that Eli was the only outsider the countess allowed to enter and leave the family’s residence as he pleased.

In one of the rooms, Eli saw Rias Dimori, but it didn’t seem to be the same as what the servant had said.

Eli looked at the smiling Rias and did a quick check, and realized that it wasn’t wrong. There wasn’t much life left in Rias’ body, and she could only live for another three months at most, but it was she was not dying immediately.

“You’re sick?” Eli asked.

“of course not. Otherwise, how would I have pulled you out of the laboratory? but I’m really not in good health, so I wanted to see you.” Rias was only a few years younger than Eli, but due to the potions, her appearance did not change much, looking like she was in her twenties or thirties.

“I don’t have much time left. Can you accompany me for the rest of my life?” Rias asked, looking at Eli.

“Alright!” This time, Eli didn’t refuse.

The next three months would be interesting for Eli.

He had never rested for such a long time before. There were no experiments or bloodline cultivation every day. He only read sorcery books and accompanied Rias.

Their interactions were also very normal, talking about past memories and happy things. Rias would always laugh out loud.

The two of them toured many places in Jun Lin and went to other places as well. Rias was as happy as a young girl while Eli watched from the side.

This was all very common, but Rias was already very satisfied. It was also in this environment that Eli gained new insights.

That was why, until the end, when he saw Rias close her eyes on the bed, Eli was rather calm.

“It’s over!” Looking at her life force disappearing as well, Eli turned and left.

Unlike his teacher’s death, this time, the successive deaths had changed his mentality even more violently.

In the past, he still had more fantasies about the things of the secular world, but now, he decided to shift more energy to the pursuit of truth.

The lives of ordinary people were limited. Even high-level creatures had their own time limits, but truth and knowledge were endless.

From today on, he would become a pursuer of the truth.

Of course, this didn’t mean that he would shed emotions and desires. That was impossible. This was just a change in attitude.

That was all.

…

Rias’s death triggered a new round of dukedom competition because Rias had no descendants. Only her brother had left behind two descendants. However, many branch families also wanted to inherit the dukedom of the nobles because they had equal rights. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The fight lasted for a long time.

However, just as one of the branch family members was happily preparing to inherit the title, the Queen suddenly gave the order to make the son of Rias’ brother the new count.

Everyone was shocked.

And when Eli received the news, he only smiled indifferently.

This was something that Rias had talked to him about in the past three months. At that time, she had only mentioned it casually, saying that she felt guilty about her brother, but her brother’s son seemed to be unable to inherit the title for some reason.

Eli still remembered it, so he pulled some strings.

It was as simple as that.
