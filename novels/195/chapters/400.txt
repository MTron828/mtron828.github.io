401 The Clone of Faith

Many celestials stood in the sky and watched this terrifying scene!

“This is too exaggerated! “Glen’s mouth twitched, and his body trembled with excitement.

He knew that Eli was strong, but he didn’t expect him to be this strong.

” It’s more than ten kilometers long, but it can still affect us! ” Lobelia looked down.

At this moment, the pink shield was already covered in black shadows, constantly corroding the shield and causing holes to appear. If they got any closer, the shield might not be able to protect these Warlocks.

!!

Eli was stronger than she thought.

“If this weren’t Anna’s partner, I would have been tempted!” Lobelia raised her head and looked at Eli in the distance. She felt her heart beating very fast.

The celestials of the Golden Cicada Chamber of Commerce sighed. He could even defeat a Radiant Sun Warlock. This meant that the Bloodline Tower had almost reached rank 2. Judging from that, this force had great potential.

” I suddenly understand Lord Conilla! ” He suddenly felt a little emotional.

The Warlocks of the Amina Family looked at Selona with admiration as if they were praising the wisdom of their patriarch!

As expected of the family head, he saw through the essence of Eli’s strength at a glance and then invested in advance!

“I’m definitely going to stick to this man. No one can stop me!” Selona held his head high.

“So many celestial souls!” Nikola’s eyes were shining.

Hydra helplessly lowered its head, feeling bored. It had barely participated in this battle.

If the celestials were like this, the Warlocks under their protection were naturally even more shocked!

The last glimmer of hope in the eyes of the Akasha family’s Warlocks faded.

” The Akasha Family is finished. Everything is gone! ”

” Eight-Armed Naga, what bullsh * t second-class force is this? Is this all the Radiant Sun Warlocks have? ”

” How do we fight this? Is this an opponent we should face? ”

The weapons in the hands of the Akasha Family’s Warlocks dropped one after another. They all chose to surrender. There were even some radical old Warlocks who chose to commit suicide, and this number was not small.

For a time, Warlocks fell one after another, and the smell of blood filled the air.

The surrounding Warlocks of the Bloodline Tower watched this action silently.

If it wasn’t for Sir Eli, then these Warlocks could be them!

” Sigh, thank you, Sir Eli! ” Rafiq muttered in his heart. The terrifying scene that looked like a natural disaster in the distance was deeply imprinted in his mind, and he would never forget it!

The other Warlocks also looked at Eli in the distance, remembering this scene.

One could imagine that this scene would be remembered for a long time in the future!

…..

Except for these people.

There were also some people who were closer to Eli and had more direct experience of the battle. They were the Warlocks and humans in Nightfall City!

Thud!

A Warlock knelt on the city wall. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“We’re saved!” His clothes were already wet, but his eyes were still filled with fear.

When he turned around, he saw that the others on the city wall were doing the same.

Nightfall City was at the core of the battle. They had personally witnessed the terrifying battle and the scene of the battle. The huge aftershock had even killed a three-circle Warlock like him.

But no one had expected that at this moment, Sir Eli would still remember them.

While fighting, he protected Nightfall City, preventing them from turning into ashes in the battle.

“Thank you, sir!” He silently chanted in his heart.

As a third-circle warlock, his actions were relatively calm, but the other Warlocks were different.

Whether it was the first circle, the second circle, or even the mortals, they all hugged each other and cried tears of joy.

They walked out of the room and onto the street, cheering for Eli’s name and thanking him for everything he had done.

….

On the other side.

Eli silently transformed into his human form and moved the entire city to the south for more than 20 kilometers. Then, he put down the city!

The battlefield just now still had the remnants of the previous battle aura. It was impossible to live in it for a short period of time, so he might as well move the city here!

Sensing that Nightfall City had flown tens of kilometers away and landed in the blink of an eye, the Warlocks in Nightfall City looked at the unfamiliar environment around them.

This was a city. Eli could move it at will. Interestingly, they observed that once the city landed, it seemed to be glued to the ground without any hidden dangers!

“This really isn’t a simple warlock!”

The Warlocks sighed.

On the other side, the many celestials in the distance were also flying toward Eli.

“Congratulations, my lord!”

Everyone looked at Eli and congratulated him.

“It’s a small problem.” Eli shook his head and looked at everyone. “Other than the Warlocks of the Bloodline Tower, I would also like to thank everyone for their support. ”

Cough, cough, cough!

Many Warlocks coughed.

Reinforcements?

...

They had not even started the battle, and the battle had already been ended by Eli.

” Oh, right, my lord. The Warlocks of the Akasha Family on the other side of the battlefield have already surrendered, but a considerable number of them have committed suicide. ” Glen said.

“Yes!” Eli took the lead and looked over. He found that the Akasha Family’s Warlocks had already formed a long line and were under control. There were indeed many corpses around them.

Eli understood this. Generally speaking, families had a strong sense of honor and were more united. Most warlocks were loyal to their own forces. Now that they knew that the Akasha family was about to be destroyed, they naturally felt despair.

“Then, let’s activate our people to occupy the Akasha family’s Warlocks!” Eli said to Glen.

“Yes, sir.” Glen nodded.

“Since the matter has been resolved, I will take my leave first. Lord Conilla is still waiting for news.” The Golden Cicada Merchant Association’s celestial bid farewell.

“Yes.” Eli nodded.

“Then I’ll be leaving too!” It was the same for Lobelia.

Soon, the Warlocks bid farewell to each other. In the end, only the Warlocks of the Bloodline Tower remained.

“Everyone, I’ll leave the rest to you. I’ll take my leave first!”

...

Eli said to the few of them and then returned to his tower at a very fast speed.

The remaining people looked at each other and then left.

In the distance, after Eli had left for dozens of kilometers, he looked around and saw that there was no one around. Then, his body gradually turned into specks of golden light and disappeared.

….

In the grassy land.

Beneath Hill, Eli suddenly opened his eyes.

Dylan, who was not far away, blinked and said, “Eli, this power of faith is really something amazing. You even created a clone! ”

“The experiment was very successful. ” Eli replied with a smile. Then, he looked at his arm. There were still two faith imprints. One was full, and the other was empty.

However, as the faith clone in the distance shattered, the other empty imprint was slowly filled.

In the past 25 years, many changes had been brought to the Bloodline Tower. Thanks to the initial establishment of the basic infrastructure that could help the Bloodline Tower, Eli’s second faith imprint was filled up.

The abundant power of faith over the years gave birth to the first faith spell!

Faith clone.

Although the clone formed by the power of faith could only carry 30% of Eli’s power, it could help Eli avoid many troubles!

And the ” Eli ” on the battlefield was a clone!

As for the real Eli, he was still resting in the Grassi Land!

” The war is over. Now, it’s time to reap the rewards! ”

Eli slowly stood up and stretched his body. The branches of Hill stretched out from behind him to show him closeness.

In the distance, Dylan looked at Eli and said quietly, “How disgusting!”

Even though he had lost his memories, he knew that a Radiant Sun Mage should not be like this!

This fellow, Eli.

He was ridiculously strong!
