80 The Vote

“Clement, this won’t do. The library is so undisciplined these days, and I think you have to take up at least half of the responsibility. How can the library export talents to the Empire like this? ”

Before he even entered his teacher’s room, a sharp and mocking voice sounded.

??

Eli frowned but still walked in.

There were two people in the room. One of them was scholar clement, who was already 68 years old. He was sitting in a chair with his eyes closed and a pen in his hand.

Opposite him, in front of the table, stood a man who looked to be about 28 years old with an arrogant face. He kept criticizing scholar Clement.

“This can’t go on. It’s too undisciplined. At least I’ve seen those guards dare to talk during working hours. This kind of discipline is really bad. if they were in our family, they would be whipped hard.” The man’s face was full of anger, and he expressed his dissatisfaction without any restraint.

“Ah, yes, yes, yes.” scholar clement nodded in despair.

“Hmph, Clement, I’m also the Vice Director. Please show me a better attitude!” The man’s mouth twitched when he heard this.

“Forget it. I’m going to check out the other things in the library first!” The man shook his head and walked out of the door.

He happened to run into eli, who just came in. The man didn’t say anything but raised his head high and strode out with an arrogant expression.

Eli looked at the man’s back with a baffled expression. ‘Who the f*ck are you!’

“Teacher, what is this?” He walked to scholar Clement and asked.

“He’s the new Vice Director!” Scholar Clement said helplessly when he saw that it was Eli.

“Is that him? This guy doesn’t look easy to get along with!” Eli said in a strange tone.

“Ha, he’s not just difficult to get along with. He’s already treating the library as his home and is preparing to implement many new measures.” Scholar Clement said with a sigh.

“For example, you have too many holidays and have to be cut in half. Or you’re too lazy and have to arrive at 7 am every morning.”

Eli was speechless.

“Then, the others don’t object? ” he hadn’t been here for a day, and something so big had actually happened in the library.

“There’s an objection, but it’s no use!” scholar clement put the stone on the table, got up, and stretched his muscles. “he was sent here by the king, so he must be here for the position of the main director. It seems that as soon as the current director left, they would take over the library.”

“I see!” Eli’s brows furrowed even more.

If the library became the king’s private land, it would not be a good thing for him. he would not be as free as he was now.

“So, get ready to come to work on time!” Scholar Clement said with a smile as he looked at Eli.

He was already 68 years old and was about to retire. They wouldn’t do anything to him.

“Alright, I’ll go to work first.” Eli nodded. It was better to wait for things to develop and then act according to the situation.

After saying goodbye to the teacher, Eli went to his office and began to handle the documents.

After becoming a learner, he had his own office. He was in charge of a very idle position with very little work. As long as he finished his work, he could go home.

An hour later, after finishing his work, Eli was ready to leave work early. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Suddenly, the sound of the door being violently pushed open was heard.

A man strode in with his head held high and walked up to Eli arrogantly. It was the man he had seen in the teacher’s room earlier.

Eli was a little angry. ‘don’t you know how to knock?’

“And you are?” however, eli still asked with a smile.

“Hmph, I’m the Deputy director of the library, Othello. I’m currently in charge of the library. I saw that you didn’t come to work yesterday, so you can tell me what’s going on. Forget it. It’s better if you don’t. Your salary for this month will be cut in half. I hope you won’t skip work for no reason next time!”

Othello didn’t give Eli any time to react. After he finished speaking, he left with his head held high, leaving Eli in his chair.

“How troublesome!” Of course, he didn’t care about his salary, but that didn’t mean that the man could deduct his money as he pleased.

The library had a rule that he could rest three days a month, so it was legal for him not to come yesterday. However, Othello didn’t seem to know that and fined him half of the money.

It was a typical aristocratic style.

“Sigh, now that the director is gone, trouble has come.” It was only now that Eli remembered how good seviro was.

This guy spent most of his time in other countries and didn’t care about the library at all. He would only arrange some work when he returned, but even so, the library was always in good order.

But now that he had left, everything had changed.

“I hope nothing much will change.”

...

Half a month passed in the blink of an eye.

This half a month was also the most difficult half a month for all the old library staff.

In the past half a month, the guards were not allowed to speak and were not allowed to leave their posts for a day. They were not even allowed to enter the library to use the toilet. Their working hours had also been greatly increased from seven hours to ten hours a day.

Of course, this wasn’t the most unbearable thing. The most unbearable thing was that Othello cut everyone’s salary by 20% in the name of cost-saving. Everyone had a lot of opinions.

But that wasn’t what made Eli most upset. It was the increase in working hours that made him stay in the library for a long time, which was equivalent to working overtime.

And Eli finally learned about Othello’s background.

It turned out that he was a direct descendant of a Viscount family. His family’s territory was very close to here, and his family was mainly in the financial aspect. It seemed that they also had some other dealings.

The reason why Othello was able to become the Deputy Director was that he was a scholar himself, and his sister seemed to be a popular person around the king.

This could also be the king’s test.

...

Finally, another five days passed.

According to the time, it was time for the library to elect a new director.

This was supposed to be a good thing, but it seemed that someone was interfering. The new way of selecting a director was to vote, and the voters were scholars that Eli had never heard of.

‘Good Lord, they are all scholars from the noble families.’

needless to say, once they participated in the election, it was almost impossible for clement and the other vice director to become the director.

In fact, it was a violation of the rules for Othello to be the vice director because generally speaking, the position of vice director and above could not be held by nobles. But this time, it seemed that the king didn’t seem to care.

The main reason was that the operation this time was very fast, and coincidentally, this time, many grand scholars and scholars had just left Jun Lin to attend a seminar in another city. The traditional scholars and grand scholars were not there to stop this.

“No!” Thinking of this, Eli shook his head.

If Othello were to become the director, it would be f*cking troublesome. Not only would there be a noble who would arrogantly break into your room at any time, tell you that your salary had been deducted, or even directly fire you while pointing at your nose and scolding you for your poor work, but you might also be forced to work overtime for no reason.

Just thinking about it, Eli could already feel his blood pressure rising, and he had to do something.

He would never allow anyone to destroy the peaceful environment of the library.
