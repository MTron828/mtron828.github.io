441 Strange Environment

Weng!

Eli shook his head in a practiced manner to counteract the dizziness from traveling through space. When he turned around, he saw that the others were also recovering.

Eli waited as he looked down.

As far as his eyes could see, there was a dark void, and in the void, there was a small continent. This continent seemed to be different from the continent of the Warlock World. It was surrounded by black fog, and the fog seemed to contain all the evil of the world.

” Black fog? Is it a product of that world? ” Eli thought about it but wasn’t afraid.

Even though this thing did not look good, Eli could vaguely sense that the fog was already dead.

It wasn’t dead in the physical sense, but it was killed at the level of laws. It didn’t have any abilities!

Through the black fog, Eli saw the purpose of their trip. The Mountain Giant World Fragment was that continent.

Eli estimated that this piece of land should be about the same size as the West Coast, so this world fragment should be considered a medium-sized world fragment. However, Eli was not concerned about this. Although it was far away, the color of this piece of land was also very interesting. It seemed to be black, and the only difference was the center of the continent, which was a gray area. Eli guessed that this was their destination!

This was the first time he had come to such a different world. Eli wanted to observe it carefully, but at this moment, the others had also returned to normal!

” I suggest we land in the outer area, ” Gade said. ” Then we can explore deeper. ”

“Sure!” Everyone agreed, and Eli nodded.

Gade took the lead and flew towards the ground, entering the black fog. Eli hesitated for a moment before entering as well.

Whoosh!

The air was sticky like glue. When Eli waved his hand, he felt a weak layer of resistance.

Upon entering, Eli could feel the uniqueness of the black fog. It was as if it was some kind of spiritual mutation. The black fog was not important. What was important was the emotions it carried. It was an extremely complicated and dark emotion, like thick pain, despair, desire, darkness, and death … He waited for the negative emotions to mix together and then stirred the mixed feeling.

Just by being in it, one could feel the emotions within. If it was a Warlock with weak willpower, they might instantly collapse!

” But this is only the remnants of the black fog that has lost the most important ability to pollute and spread!” Eli was extremely cautious, as if he was watching the war during the Mage Era through the book!

Shaking his head, Eli sped up. The others were about to pass through the black fog.

Soon, everyone passed through the black fog. Before they left, Eli collected a few hundred liters of black fog and prepared to take it back to study. The others did not say anything when they saw this because everyone had done the same thing before. Only Gade smiled and said, ” Eli, this black mist has lost its effect. It’s useless! ”

“It’s nothing. I’m just curious.” Eli explained with a smile but ignored his reminder.

He could always find something through it!

“Alright then.” Gade smiled and didn’t mind. He continued down.

As they slowly descended, they were getting closer and closer to the ground. Eli also looked at the ground, and the more he looked, the more shocked he was.

The entire continent was deathly silent. Everything that could be seen was almost black. The winding mountain ranges were black and flickered with black light. The rivers were also flowing with black liquid, just like the rivers in hell. Even the ground was black and the plants were black.

“I thought this place would be desolate, but I didn’t expect it to be so lively. It’s black vitality!” Stacy said with a smile.

“The rules of this world have been completely changed.” Clessie nodded.

“I think so too! “Karel agreed!

The corners of Eli’s mouth curled up slightly, but he was even more curious about the journey ahead.

Soon, they landed on the edge of the continent!

Bang!

Eli stepped on the soft soil, and the feeling of his feet was not much different from usual.

However … Eli looked down and saw some black weeds wriggling under his feet, trying to push him away. The forest in the distance was also trembling as if it did not welcome their arrival. It seemed to be conscious, and there were cracks on it.

Whoosh!

“How interesting!” Eli shook his head, and Gade turned his head as well. He smiled and teased, “I felt the same way when I first came here. Although all the creatures here have lost the ability to infect, they have transmitted this pollution so that you can see all kinds of strange creatures!

“Of course, these plants still have the original effects of magic plants, so you don’t have to worry. If you see something that you’re interested in, just pick it. You’ll know when you pull it out.”

“Yes.” Eli nodded and squatted down, wanting to pluck the flowers next to him.

Unexpectedly, a mouth opened at the top of the flower and cursed, “Are you bullying the flowers? Don’t pull me out … Ah … It hurtsAhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!”

Eli pulled the flower out. The moment he pulled it out, a layer of black fog was emitted from the flower. When the black fog dissipated, there was an ordinary wildflower in his hand. It was delicate and glistening, and it emitted a faint fragrance. As for the black fog, it burrowed into the void here!

Hiss!

Eli also gasped in surprise. He could recover the plant’s original appearance by pulling out the plant?!

“Let’s go. This is the outer area. There’s nothing good here!” Gade patted Eli and walked forward.

The other three followed. Eli also turned around and looked at the strange forest not far away before following.

…..

On the other side, the group that had left the edge of the forest also entered a plain.

The black river seemed to be flowing across the plains, and weeds that were several meters tall stretched out wildly, gently dancing in the breeze!

Gade walked in front and waved his fingers. Countless wind elements gathered and formed a huge sickle. With a light slash, the plains in front of him turned into flat land, and the weeds that blocked his vision disappeared.

Although the environment was strange, one should not forget their strength. They were Radiant Sun Sorcerers.

Even in a normal Middle World, they would still be top-notch experts. Moreover, this was just a plain fragment of a Middle World, even if it was a little strange.

The plain in front of him suddenly became empty. At this time, Eli also realized that there were still many creatures on the plain.

The one closest to them was a huge elk-like figure. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

It had black striped skin, huge antlers that were like sharp blades that flickered with a cold black light, and even its eyes were black. However, its body was indeed very strange. At the same time, there were strange tumors on its body, and there seemed to be something squirming inside. Where the teeth were, there were black tentacles with spikes!

This strange giant deer’s aura had also reached three rings.

“Is this a native creature of this world?” Clessie asked curiously. Like Eiy, he had never entered any world fragments.

...

“No, it’s just contaminated by this world!” Gade replied.

At this moment, the giant deer also noticed everyone and let out a roar. Eli felt a wave of mental impact, but it was so weak that it could be ignored.

The giant deer looked at the fellow in front of it and was stunned. Its black eyes blinked!

It couldn’t understand how these strange creatures in front of it could be so relaxedThe giant deer felt that this was a little out of its mind. In the next second, it rushed toward them. It opened its mouth, and its tentacle-like mouthpart bit at a few of them!

Bang!

The black blood mist suddenly exploded, and the mist rose up like smoke. Countless pieces of flesh returned to normal and scattered on the ground. The ground was red as if the tentacles and pustules were just an illusion. Gade gently put down his hand. This was his doing.

“What a waste!”

Behind him, Eli sighed silently. Such a rare living material.

Fortunately, there were still many on the plains.

After destroying the giant deer, everyone continued to move forward. Eli also noticed the changes here. He felt that this was a normal world, and then it became a strange version due to the pollution. These creatures seemed to be even more strange and powerful.

Eli also collected a few samples and prepared to go back and slowly study them.

...

With the help of a few Radiant Sun Warlocks, the group quickly crossed the plains and entered a large stretch of mountains.

At this point, everyone became a little more serious because the Mountain Giants usually only moved in the mountains!

Eli also stretched his body, keeping an eye on his surroundings.

He was very curious about what the original owner of this world had become and whether there were any Mountain Giants above the celestial realm who had been contaminated and were still here. Moreover, if he went to the mountain range, he might be able to find the item he was looking for, the Flower of Eternal Night!

However, after a few steps, everyone suddenly stopped and looked up.

In the black fog in the mountain range, a huge figure that was nearly 500 meters long slowly moved, emitting a roar!

” A Mountain Giant above the celestial Realm is so tall. It’s at least a Radiant Sun Mountain Giant! ”

Eli pursed his lips. There was actually a contaminated fourth circle existence!

Such good materials.

He was a little excited!

When the other four saw the joy in Ely’s eyes, their mouths twitched at the same time. This was a giant above the Radiant Sun realm, and it had even mutated!

Shouldn’t he be nervous?
