539 Access, Surveillance

Soon, under Dylan’s guidance, they were getting closer and closer to the ground.

They landed in an ordinary area.

What greeted his eyes was a dilapidated scene. A huge metal factory was broken, a huge fusion element cannon was broken in half, and mechanical tissues were everywhere!

Even when Eli landed on the ground and felt the metallic ground, he knew that this mage tower was a dilapidated mechanical planet.

As soon as he landed, Eli saw some mechanical creations spinning on the ground not far away. There were even a few dozen of meters long mechanical robots on the ground in the distance. His eyes suddenly lit up.

However, it only lasted for a few seconds. After a few seconds, the light swept across the area and fell silent again.

“Hehe, Sir, I already said that we have the authority. The native creatures here won’t attack us!” Dylan laughed smugly. Then, his body changed. A mechanical tentacle stretched out and stabbed into the ground.

The surface of the ground rippled like water. Then, the earth split, and a tunnel that led straight to the underground slowly appeared in front of Eli and Dylan.

Eli was puzzled. Dylan opened his eyes and said, “Sir, this is the passage to the supervision room. It is also the area that I was once in charge of, but I still have to rely on you to unlock it later!”

‘Is that so?’

Eli nodded.

Soon, the two of them walked down. After walking for a few kilometers, the space suddenly opened up.

This was a huge underground space, a few hundred acres in size. Countless screens surrounded the area, but it was all dark at the moment. Not far away from them, there was a huge control panel.

Dylan seemed to be very familiar with this place. He walked directly to the control panel and pressed a button. The screen in front of him lit up, and on the control panel, a female elf-like phantom slowly appeared.

“Sir, this is an interesting low-dimensional creature. It does not have the concept of lifespan. When the mages built the wizard tower, they used it as an auxiliary creature to integrate it into the planet. It is a creature that lives and dies with the tower. Her name is Samuel.” As Dylan spoke, Samuel opened her eyes.

As soon as she opened her eyes, she saw a layer of data flowing slowly behind her. She then looked at Dylan as if she was puzzled, but in the next second, her eyes widened.

“Little Dylan, you’re back. Wow, I didn’t think that you’d actually come back after thousands of years. I thought you were dead. Oh, that’s surprising. After all, you were so weak.” Samuel’s illusory figure jumped in front of Dylan and chattered non-stop!

Little Dylan?

Seeing this interesting title, Eli raised his eyebrows. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

At this moment, Samuel also noticed Ely. However, unlike when she saw Dylan, the moment she saw Ely, her expression changed, and she screamed, “Intruder! Intruder!”

In an instant, the surrounding walls lit up, and countless black holes appeared. Energy seemed to be accumulating in them, and a large amount of metallic liquid flowed out of the walls. In an instant, the metallic liquid turned into humanoid robots, emitting the aura of fourth-circle monsters.

Eli’s expression changed, and the aura of a high-level fifth-circle mage instantly erupted.

Over the years, the power of the Maged Tower had gradually weakened. If it were in the past, she would have a way to deal with Eli. However, at this moment, she could not stop such a powerful enemy, not to mention that the Tower was in a state of no master.

“Sir, sir, please take out the key. This is a matter of authority. You haven’t obtained the authority here yet!” Dylan shouted. He had forgotten to remind Eli.

Hearing the reminder, Eli took out the key again.

When she saw the key, Samuel’s gaze changed again.

In the next second, countless machines retracted, and the two masses of liquid slowly melted into the floor. Samuel looked at the two of them with a complaint and said, “Aiya, it’s really true. If you had taken the key out earlier, we wouldn’t have any problem!”

Dylan’s mouth twitched as well. He quickly ran to Eli and said,” Sir, the creatures in the Magus Tower are all above the level of authority. With the key, you will automatically have the second level of authority here.”

Dylan apologized.

Eli understood that he was too excited. In fact, Dylan had been in a state of excitement ever since he entered this place.

Samuel, who was standing by the side, also looked curiously after understanding Eli’s identity. She knew Dylan, but she had never seen this Mage before.

“I’m a fifth circle Thousand Flower Mage, Eli.”

“Hello, Sir Eli!” Samuel nodded curiously.

“Samuel, Sir is here to obtain the authority of the Mage Tower,” Dylan said.

“I understand!” Samuel nodded, but then she looked at the two of them in confusion and asked curiously, “If you want to control the Mage Tower, you can go to the core tower. Why are you here?”

“Samuel, don’t you have all the surveillance in the Magus Tower? We don’t know what the current situation is like in the Magus Tower. Also, there’s a group of illegal Warlocks who broke into the Magus Tower at this time, trying to obtain authority.” Dylan said.

“What, illegal intrusion?” Samuel’s eyes widened.
