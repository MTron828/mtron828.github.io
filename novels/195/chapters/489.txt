490 Warlock Alliance’s Decision

The wheels of war rolled over.

A week later, after completely occupying Rolle City and building a military base, the Bloodline Tower once again set out for the Heart of the Abyss.

At this moment, the Heart of the Abyss had also gathered everyone, trying to stop the Bloodline Tower’s advance. At this time, even with the help of airships, advancing forward was much more difficult than before. This was because the Heart of the Abyss put everything in their defense.

Sorrow and joy, the joy of victory, the pain of death, the joy of survival…

It was said that war was the cruelest, and the truth was indeed so.

However, there was a group of people who were only thinking about the threat the Bloodline Tower posed to them and the impact it would have on the world.

The Warlock Union.

The Central Region.

On a vast piece of land stood a magnificent tower that was nearly three thousand meters tall. Below the tower was a huge city built on it. Nearly a hundred million people surrounded the city.

The people here were all smiling as if they were not too worried about the current power struggle and other external influences. This was because this was Heaven City, built by the Warlock Union, which was formed by the six oldest forces!

The six ancient masters controlled almost everything in the central region, and the size of the central region was comparable to the other four regions combined. This also showed how powerful the Warlock Union was.

They were also the leading force of warlocks in the current world.

At this moment, the highest floor of the tower.

In a room.

The huge round table was placed in the middle, and six illusory figures surrounded it!

“Everyone, the Heart of the Abyss has already asked for help from our Warlock Union. Nero told me that they are no match for the Bloodline Tower and that we need to send Warlocks to delay Bloodline Tower or directly support the Heart of the Abyss.” The figure at the front spoke. It was an old man with a head full of white hair.

“I think we should support them. Otherwise, if the Western Regions are unified, it will more or less affect our rule. This must be stopped!” An old woman said.

“I think we should forget about it. After all, the Western Region is not our territory. With the last relic incident, we annexed half of the Eastern Region.” Another middle-aged man said slowly, somewhat apprehensive.

“However, this matter is directly related to the Hamis clan in the Central Region. If the Hamis clan hadn’t invaded the Central Region back then, the situation might not have been like this!” The white-haired old man spoke again and looked at the person on his right.

Hearing this, the man looked up. It was Azak of the Hamis family.

“But the Western Regions is within your sphere of influence, and this matter is inextricably linked with you!” The old woman turned her head and looked at Azak.

Hearing this, Azak frowned but did not say anything else.

This matter was indeed related to him. If he had attacked earlier, things would not have turned out like this. However, she could not blame him. Who the f * ck would have thought that Eli was so strong?

He defeated six half-step fifth-circle warlocks.

“Alright, there’s no point in saying this now!” In the end, it was the white-haired Warlock who spoke. He looked around and said with a serious expression, “Everyone, the Heart of the Abyss cannot be destroyed, and the Western Regions cannot become a unified entity.

“Now we have to do something. Although our family has ordered a lot of warlocks to fight against the Lich Tower these days, we will still take out 10,000 warlocks to join the battle. Each family should also send out this number. As for Azak, haven’t you already stationed many warlocks at the border?

“I’ve got a plan.”

Hearing the white-haired old man’s words, the others also looked over.

“First of all, let’s leave the main battlefield to the Heart of the Abyss. If we directly intervene in the war without any reason, the impact will be too bad. Therefore, our operation this time must be secret.

“I plan to divide them into three parts. One is the Eastern Region, which will be handled by the Hamis family. They don’t need to do much there. They just need to distract everyone’s attention and attract their backup forces.

“Two is to infiltrate from the Green Field.

“Three is to send a small group of high-end combat forces to Bloodline City and capture all the higher-ups of the Bloodline Tower. We can just push the blame to the Lich Tower. Anyway, it is not strange for an evil organization to do something like this.

” Eli is at the battlefield frontline, and so is their main force. Our losses won’t be too great. Even if he realizes it, we’ll have enough time to return. If the rear is destroyed, the Bloodline Tower’s attack will naturally be disintegrated. After that, we’ll be the good guys who enter and divide the resources!

“What do you think?”

The white-haired Warlock chuckled as he looked at the crowd.

“But will Greenfield let us pass?” Azak asked.

“No problem. We’re just passing by. They won’t provoke us for no reason. I believe they don’t have the guts.” The white-haired old man shook his head.

“I don’t have any opinions, so let’s do this.” Azak sighed and agreed.

“Good!”

“I agree too!”

Everyone nodded.

“Mm, very good. Then let’s start discussing the distribution of the Western Regions.” The white-haired Warlock smiled and changed the topic.

The others also smiled. Clearly, they all believed that victory was in their grasp.

As the most powerful force in the world, they were confident.

..

Three days later.

Eli was resting when there was a knock on the door.

“Come in!”

The door opened, and Alida walked in. She was one of the few people who knew that Eli was still in the Grassi Land.

“Did something happen?” Eli looked at her and noticed that she seemed to be frowning.

“Sir, the Hamis family’s warlock army has been discovered in the eastern region. They have entered the eastern region to save their forces. Their combat forces are currently gathering there.

“Also, Liliana sent a message saying that a large number of Warlocks from the Warlock Union had secretly left. Their whereabouts are unknown, but they might be heading towards the Western Regions.” Alida asked.

The Hamis family of the Warlock Union!

Hearing these two terms, Eli’s eyebrows curled.

Finally, they couldn’t hold it in anymore!

He looked at Alida and said, “The Warlocks can gather in the east. If the Hamis family attacks, we will attack them back. Don’t be afraid.

“As for the Warlock Union…”

Eli took out a map and looked at it. There were only two roads from the west to the central region. One was the east, and the other was the northern Green Field. It was only possible for the Warlock Union people moved through Green Fields to reach the western region.

Coincidentally, most of that place was his territory.

“But Milord, what if there’s an accident?” Alida continued.

“Just take care of the east. Leave the rest to me.” Eli smiled.

His body was at the Bloodline City, and he ruled the Green Field.

Could it be that the Warlock Union was so stupid as to offend him?

If that were the case, it would be fun.

“This is interesting.”

Elo smiled.
