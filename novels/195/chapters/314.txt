315 Insta-Kill

Three figures rose up from behind and flew towards Eli, who was in the sky.

Two men and one woman. One of the men was wearing a black magician robe, while the other was wearing a gray magician robe. The woman was dressed in sexy clothes, and her body was covered with patterns. All three of them had reached the half-step celestial realm!

“Who are you?” The woman was the first to speak, her face serious.

The other two also instantly activated their bloodlines because they couldn’t see through the man in front of them.

!!

However, it seemed that Eli had no intention of answering them. He only looked at the ground. On the ground, shadows flowed like waves, forming layer after layer of black waves, devouring warlocks one after another.

Some of the warlocks who had fallen into the shadows extended their hands, some shouted for help, and some held on tightly to the things around them as if they were life-saving straws.

However, without exception, everyone’s face was filled with despair.

These shadows were too strong, and ordinary warlocks could not resist them.

Even those powerful third-circle warlocks could only run around, trying their best not to let the shadows touch them. As for flying, there was no doubt that Eli was a terrifying person, and no one wanted to face him.

They were waiting for the half-step celestial warlocks to finish off this Warlock who had suddenly appeared.

Seeing that Eli was completely ignoring her, a hint of anger flashed across the warlock’s face. The blood in her hands was gradually activated, and a woman with a human body and a snake tail appeared in the sky.

“Go to hell!”

She made a sound and approached Eli. A storm gathered around her and expanded to a range of dozens of meters in the blink of an eye. It tore everything around it apart brutally, like a natural disaster.

Eli’s gaze was calm as he raised his hand gently. A wind blade slowly condensed between his fingers.

Looking at the weak wind element, the enemy warlocks laughed. Compared to the female warlock’s powerful attack, it was undoubtedly too weak.

“Her Excellency has made her move, he’s dead!”

“it’s finally over. F * ck that damned shadow!”

On the ground, the warlocks looked up at the sky with joy.

However, the next second, everyone’s eyes turned dull.

The wind blade in Eli’s hand flew toward the female warlock. It grew bigger and bigger. In the blink of an eye, it had grown to a size of nearly a thousand feet, as if it was going to cut the world apart.

When it got close to the female warlock, the warlock looked at the huge wind blade and was stunned.

“No!”

The female warlock’s eyes widened, and she immediately turned to leave.

She had already understood that she was no match for him.

However, the wind blade had already arrived. Under the wind blade that was hundreds of meters long, her storm was as fragile as a baby. With a light slash, it disappeared without a trace, and she was turned into dust by the wind blade.

The wind blade did not stop after it passed her but flew straight to the ground.

The warlocks who were still alive were dumbfounded. Feeling the biting cold storm, they frantically dodged in all directions.

In the end, the wind blade still fell, directly carving a crack that was hundreds of meters long and tens of meters long on the ground. The flying soil also covered the entire area, and in the process, hundreds of people had only come into contact with the aftermath and died!

When the smoke dispersed, everyone looked at the cracks in the ground.

“This is too terrifying.”

One by one, the warlocks dodged the shadows while looking at Eli in the sky, their eyes full of fear.

They didn’t expect that a half-step celestial would be so easily killed by him.

Seeing the female Warlock die, the other two warlocks were also shocked.

One of the warlocks even opened his mouth wide and pointed at Eli, his entire body trembling as he said, “He… He’s a celestial!”

Celestial!

This word seemed to have some kind of magic.

The other Warlock was also stunned.

“It can’t be!”

“You’re lying, right? How could there be a celestial here?”

The corner of his mouth twitched. The bloodline tower actually had a celestial. No wonder it had such a strong hold on the West Coast!

This didn’t make sense!

The Warlock was so shocked that he could not close his mouth, but then he realized another problem.

Would he be able to leave this place alive?

The other Warlock also turned around. The two of them looked at each other and at the same time, they knelt in the air.

“Milord, please spare us! We really didn’t do it on purpose!”

“If we had known that you were from the bloodline tower, we would never have made a move!”

They understood that this was their only hope of survival.

“Maybe next time.” However, Eli shook his head. Although this was a test of strength, he did not intend to hold back.

He waved his hand, and two more wind blades condensed.

Seeing the wind blades, the two warlocks lost all hope. They activated their bloodlines, and their blood surrounded them like Giants, trying to block the two attacks.

However, as the wind blade swept past, it was as if a cool breeze had flattened everything. The blood shield was shattered in the blink of an eye, and the two of them were instantly torn into countless pieces of flesh and blood by the storm, disappearing with the wind.

The warlocks on the ground gulped when they saw this.

They were in complete despair.

The three half-step celestial warlocks couldn’t even last a minute.

...

Some of them chose to give up on resisting, allowing the shadow to devour them. Some of them resisted, but it was meaningless. Eli stretched out his hand.

The shadow walls around him instantly caved in.

A shadow wave that was over a hundred meters tall swept towards the inner part, and countless warlocks struggled.

A few seconds later, the shadow gradually disappeared, but all the warlocks had disappeared as well. Even the houses and tents were corroded in the shadow, leaving only the ground that was riddled with holes and a huge crack.

And as he watched everything disappear, Eli remained calm.

Eli calculated. It wasn’t difficult for him to use this spell as a standard to test out the other powers, so he only used one move. Then, based on the power of this move and the mental force used, he deduced his strength.

He was indeed very strong.

He finally understood the difference between the celestial warlock and the warlocks beneath it.

It was like heaven and earth.

The next step would be to test the celestial body or the bloodline avatar.

There was also the headquarters of the Wanderer’s Alliance. He would use it as the testing place.

...

With that in mind, Eli looked even further away, as if he could really see through space.

“Let’s go!”

Eli chuckled, and blood energy wrapped around his body as he advanced in the designated direction.

And a few seconds after Eli left.

The bloodline tower’s warlocks had finally arrived.

They pushed through the dense bushes and walked out of the forest.

“Ah!”

But when they saw the scene in front of them, they were all shocked.

On the battlefield in front of him, there were no people at all. The ground was charred black as if it had suffered some kind of destruction.

As for the thousands of warlocks and half-step celestial warlocks of the Wanderer Alliance, they had long disappeared without a trace.

“what happened?!”

A Warlock walked into the land.

He lowered his head and saw that his boots were beginning to melt as if they were being corroded. He immediately retreated when he saw this. However, in just a few seconds, he could already see his feet.

The others were also shocked.

The warlock was not wearing ordinary boots but first-grade mage equipment. However, just the things left on the ground were enough to damage a mage weapon.

“Oh my God! What the hell happened here?!”

One of the warlocks was trembling.

At this moment, he already understood that it was not those people who had left, but rather, they were dead.

They were just a little late, and all of them were already dead.

“Who’s that in the blood light?” A Warlock’s throat moved as he spoke.

“I might have read about the movement of bloody light in the records of the previous Wars in bloodline tower!” A Warlock suddenly exclaimed.

Everyone’s gazes instantly focused.

The Warlock pursed his lips and said, “if I’m not mistaken.

“In the bloodline tower, the one who has this technique should be the teacher of the previous tower master, Harman. The last time he appeared was two hundred years ago!”

Herman!

The warlocks were silent. Some of the new generations of warlocks had never heard of this name.

However, it was foreseeable that this name would once again be known to the world.
