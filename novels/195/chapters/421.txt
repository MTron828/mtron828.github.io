422 The Death of Eli

“Second round!”

Looking at the blood mist in the sky, Jesse’s face was filled with anger. In just a few seconds of carelessness, they had lost ten celestials!

These were ten celestials!

Even if he were the pillar of the Eight-Armed Naga family, he would need to spend an unknown amount of time and resources to nurture an existence of this level!

!!

“Eli!” Jesse shouted angrily. His blood surged like waves, and his muscles bulged. Black and purple blood vessels appeared like black snakes.

The other two Radiant Suns were also staring at Eli with anger written all over their faces!

” Sir has obtained a certain degree of lead! ” Nikola glanced at the sky while fighting the Warlock.

” Hmph, even so, Eli’s failure is only a matter of time! ” The Warlock sneered, but the cold sweat on his forehead showed that he did not think so.

“Haha, Milord will definitely win.” Nikola didn’t expose the Warlock and chuckled.

Then, the two of them fought again, but the Warlock’s performance lowered. The two of them actually began to be evenly matched, and the Warlock even inadvertently led the battlefield further away!

“In the blink of an eye, ten masters were killed!”

“Lord Patriarch!”

” Damn it, it was just a moment of carelessness. So the battle between celestials is so cruel? ”

The Warlocks of the Eight-Armed Naga family were all gaping. It was obvious that this was not what they had expected.

BattleIt didn’t seem to be as smooth as he had imagined!

At this moment, the Warlocks actually felt that they were slightly shaken. Could their masters really kill Ely?

…

In the sky!

Having lost their support, Jesse and the other two once again battled with Eli.

The eight arms seemed to have turned into afterimages as they collided with the dragon claws. The black scales flashed with sparks from time to time, leaving deep and shallow wounds. A large number of shadows filled the wounds in time.

Under such an attack, Eli was quickly suppressed. The fast-paced battle was also extremely stressful for the bloodline!

Bang!

Escaping another attack from the three of them, Eli quickly dodged to the side and activated his Time Domain again.

Jesse and the other two were the first to notice this change. Their muscles tensed up, and they understood what had happened to the celestials!

“Use spatial teleportation!” Jesse immediately shouted. At the same time, his hand reached into an unknown place, and a token that emitted a spatial aura was taken out again!

With a crack, the imprint was crushed!

Following a spatial fluctuation, the three of them suddenly disappeared and instantly appeared more than ten kilometers away!

The moment he appeared, Jesse looked at Eli and laughed, “Eli, the range of your domain is indeed too limited. It’s useful against those celestials, but it’s useless against us! ”

Jess then glanced at the other two Radiant Suns. The two of them understood and flew to the other two sides, forming a triangle to surround Eli again!

He looked at Eli coldly and sneered.

The space token was too precious, and it was something they had accidentally obtained from a Mage ruin. Actually, he could have saved it, but for safety reasons, he still used it. He really did not want to see any accidents happen!

“So cautious!” In the distance, the corners of Eli’s mouth twitched. Was there a need to do that?

As the encirclement was formed, the three Warlocks nodded in tacit understanding. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

In the next second, the three Eight-Armed Naga warlocks roared at the same time. The black-purple blood essence on their bodies burned like flames, and their eight arms waved at the same time. The power in their entire bodies began to gather, and a light wave gathered in front of their chests, emitting a terrifying aura.

Looking at this scene, Eli’s eyes widened.

At this moment, he felt a fatal threat. This familiar starting move also reminded him of the World Destruction spell used by the Radiant Sun Warlock last time!

What was worse was that as the three of them began to gather their power, even though they were a few kilometers apart, they actually felt a faint connection in their bloodlines. This caused the surrounding space to faintly freeze, and this directly led to the problem that he felt that it was almost impossible for him to dodge this attack.

” Bloodline Combination Skill! ”

Eli pursed his lips. He understood what he was going to face next!

The Bloodline Combination Skill was a special skill that could only be used between people of the same bloodline. It could connect the bloodline and allow the bloodline to explode with power that exceeded its limits. The last time Eli saw it was on the west coast, but that was a combination skill of low-level Warlocks.

However, this was the combined skill of three Radiant Sun Warlocks. This was a completely different concept!

“Come on!”

Eli, who was wrapped up, was ready. He did everything he could.
