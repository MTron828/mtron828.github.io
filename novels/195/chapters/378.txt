Jerre and the others looked at Eli with cruel smiles as if victory was already in their grasp.

” Eli, surrender now, and I can give you an intact corpse. ” Jerre’s voice entered Eli’s ears.

The other celestials also laughed loudly, and their voices could be heard for a hundred miles.

!!

“So noisy!”

Eli rubbed his ears. In the next second, his bloodline power suddenly erupted.

With him as the center, countless shadows spiraled up like a vortex, turning into an ocean of shadows. The entire space trembled slightly.

The eyes of the celestials turned sharp.

“Looks like you’ve decided to fight!” Jerre looked at this scene coldly and did not make a move.

In the next second.

Everyone only saw a huge dragon claw step out of the shadows. The dark black scales emitted a mysterious aura, and the huge dragon claw flickered with a cold light. As it swayed, everyone could already feel the dangerous aura.

“Jerre, something’s wrong.”

The huge silver moon wolf growled at Jerre, its eyes gradually becoming cautious.

Even without his reminder, the other Warlocks had already realized that something was wrong. That dragon claw seemed to be a little big, dozens of meters in size.

When the shadow dragon’s huge body completely emerged, everyone’s gaze became serious.

“Five hundred meters?”

Everyone looked at the huge dragon-like creature with dull gazes.

” This size is too exaggerated. How is this possible? ” The giant deer stomped on the ground uneasily and muttered.

“Jerre, are you sure that Eli is a Radiant Moon Warlock?” Another three-tailed giant turtle asked Jerry.

Now, everyone realized that they might have been wrong about Eli.

They had always thought that Eli was just a Radiant Moon Warlock, but they had never thought that he could be even more powerful.

The main reason was that no one could be at the level of the Radiant Sun. It was too exaggerated.

“Everyone, don’t worry. So what if he is Radiant Sun? We have eleven people here.” The smile on Jerre’s face had long disappeared. Obviously, he didn’t expect this to happen.

They had never seen a five-hundred-meter-tall bloodline avatar before.

“Indeed, there are eleven of us.”

“We have no other choice.”

The Warlocks shouted one after another, their expressions turning unsightly.

No one had expected that an easy fight would suddenly turn into a life-and-death situation.

However, they still had a chance of winning. They had a total of eleven celestials there!

” Don’t panic, everyone. Maybe Eli has a special dragon bloodline, or maybe he’s a Full Moon. ” At this moment, Jerre was comforting everyone.

“We can do it!”

The Warlocks gradually regained their confidence and looked at Eli again.

“You’re very brave!”

Eli spread his dragon wings and stretched his body. His eyes revealed a sneer.

In the next second, Eli’s mental power spread out again, instantly spreading to every corner of the area.

Many Warlocks looked down and saw countless runes swaying in the air like tadpoles, and these runes were gathering toward Eli.

“What is this?”

Jerre’s eyes were dull. Countless runes gathered around Eli, turning into rings of light that wrapped around him. Every ring of light would make Eli’s aura rise again.

” Magnify, Speed Enhancement Spell Formation, Skin Hardening Spell Formation, Armor Penetration Spell Formation, Sharpness Spell Formation, Fire Element Resistance Spell Formation, Water Element Resistance Spell Formation, Shadow Enhancement Spell Formation … ”

Eli felt the buffs from the spell formations, and the bloodline in his body had reached its peak.

This was the peak state of his bloodline as a Warlock.

Not far away, Nikola was surrounded by several spell formations, and his aura had reached the level of stars.

In the distance, there were even more spell formations surrounding Hydra. They coiled around its huge snake body, flickering with a unique color.

As for Eli, he was even more terrifying.

The Gigantic Spell Formation made his body even larger, reaching a height of six hundred meters. The Acceleration Spell Formation made him feel lighter. The Elemental Resistance Spell Formation was like a layer of colorful gauze covering his body, providing protection for him. The Shadow Enhancement Spell Formation allowed him to control the shadows more smoothly …

“No, I’m still missing one!”

In the next second, an illusory Time Domain spread out.

Eli’s mastery of time magic was still weak, so he could only use it to boost himself to make his speed three times faster. However, it was already very powerful.

This was Eli’s first time combining a mage’s and a warlock’s powers, and it was very successful.

In this state, Eli turned to look at Jerre and the other Warlocks and found that they seemed to be trembling.

“Patriarch Jerre, are you ready?”

Eli lowered his head and looked at Jerre. His bloodline erupted.

Gulp!

The Celestial warlocks’ throats moved at the same time. Fear gradually appeared in their eyes, and their bodies began to tremble slightly.

...

All the Warlocks instinctively felt a fatal sense of danger coming from Eli.

Even Jerre was no longer as arrogant as before.

He was already fully aware of the problem. Previously, when Eli defeated Jalin, he did not use his full strength at all. Moreover, they did not attack the Manticore family. It was not because Eli felt that his strength was not enough. It was entirely possible that Eli was too lazy to pay attention to him.

This stemmed from absolute confidence in his strength.

If they had a chance before, now they had no chance of victory at all when Eli was fully wrapped in spell formations.

He couldn’t sense any possibility of defeating Eli.

Furthermore, he could not understand where Eli had obtained so many high-level spell formations that could enhance himself!

Just by searching through the ruins?

How was this possible?

However, he knew that he had no time to think because, at this moment, Eli was already flapping his wings and flying toward them.

” Nikola, Hydra, pick an opponent each. Leave the rest to me! ”

...

Eli shouted loudly and then directly rushed towards a celestial opposite him, that giant deer celestial.

When the giant deer saw Eli coming over, it was so angry that its eyes were about to pop out. It let out a huge roar and then stabbed its two huge antlers at Eli.

Bang!

The sharp antlers crashed into Eli’s chest. Then, they crashed into various spell formations, exploding with a dazzling light. However, when the light dissipated, Eli’s pitch-black scales did not change at all.

“How is this possible?” Giant Deer Warlock was dumbfounded. This was one of his strongest attacks.

What made him even more afraid was that his antler was in Eli’s hand.

With a cracking sound, the antler instantly turned into countless blood essence and dissipated into the air.

“Ah!”

The Giant Deer Warlock let out a painful wail, but Eli did not intend to let him go. In the next second, Eli’s huge body arrived in front of the Giant Deer. Countless shadows on his dragon claws extended for a hundred meters, and then he clawed at him like a giant claw that tore through the sky!

Rip!

Under the stunned gazes of the Warlocks, the giant deer was torn into five parts and instantly dispersed. One of the Warlocks fell to the ground in pieces.

“This!”

All the Warlocks took a deep breath. Giant Deer was a Radiant Moon Warlock!

It was gone in just a few seconds.

After killing the Warlock, Eli raised his head. Shadows gathered, and a Shadow Dragon breathed.

A beam of light flew towards the huge fire rat.

The beam of light instantly flew a few miles and pierced through the fire rat. A large hole instantly appeared in its chest, and the beam of light continued to fly backward, directly turning more than ten mountains in the distance into ashes. Moreover, a huge mushroom cloud erupted at the end.

Another Nebula Warlock had died.

At this moment, all the Warlocks were trembling. They had completely underestimated Eli.

They might all die today!

“Sir, please spare my life!” The giant Withered Tree Warlock surrendered.

The other Warlocks also begged for mercy.

But in the next second, everyone’s voices stopped abruptly. The reason was that the giant tree demon Warlock was instantly enveloped by shadows, accompanied by a mournful wail, and then disappeared in the shadows. Meanwhile, Eli flew towards another Warlock.

“We’re done for!”

The giant bird Warlock looked desperate. He knew that Eli had no intention of letting any of them go today.

The bird flew into the sky, trying to break the shadow barrier. This was its only hope.

However, after a few attacks, he stopped, and the shadow barrier was unharmed.

“Damn you, Jerre!”

The Giant Bird Warlock was in complete despair as he cursed Jerre in the distance.

At this moment, Jerre’s entire body was trembling.

” How is this possible? How is this possible? ” He watched as Eli killed the Eagle Warlock with a claw strike, then flew off to kill a manticore. He didn’t even pause for a moment.

It was like beating up a child!

Jerre was in despair. He never thought that Eli would be so powerful.

His so-called gathering of forces was like a joke.

Soon, Warlocks fell from the sky one by one, turning into a blood mist that filled the surrounding hundred miles with blood. As for the terrain, there were only some changes. There were fewer mountains and more huge stone pits.

As for him, he no longer had the courage to attack. He could only watch as the celestials he brought died one by one.

“The manticore is gone.”

Jerre revealed a bitter smile.

Soon, as the last giant green bird’s head was crushed by Eli, and Eli flew towards him, Jerre silently dispelled his True Spirit Body.

He just looked at the huge shadow dragon in front of him and said, “Eli, everyone has underestimated your strength.

“I only have one request. When the Bloodline Tower conquers the manticore, don’t kill too many mortals.”

“Okay!”

The huge shadow dragon let out a sound. In the next second, Jerry was directly swallowed by the shadow!

The battle had ended!
