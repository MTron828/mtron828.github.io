After the banquet ended, Eli was free to move around the city. While waiting for the replenishment of resources, he observed the city at the edge of the Sofia Mountains.

He observed every place and also used this opportunity to observe the central continent.

Three days later, he had a rough understanding of this place.

From flying magic beasts renter, Eli learned that flying items had almost disappeared in the warlock era. People relied on their legs or flying beasts to travel long distances.

!!

He finally understood why the people in the city reacted so strongly that day.

These days, some people even went out of the city to observe the airships.

From the relay station where the information was transmitted, Eli knew that the communication in the warlock World was also a mess.

Long-distance communication was basically only available to large factions, and there was a price to pay.

From the city wall, Eli knew that these people had basically given up on using spell formations.

There were many similar things, and Eli was also very emotional.

And this was largely related to the change in bloodline cultivation methods. The Warlocks’ spiritual power was even weaker.

Simply put, the things that Mages had were no longer suitable for Warlocks.

While he was observing, the Golden Cicada Merchant Association had finished replenishing their supplies.

Eli was ready to continue.

On the day of departure, outside the city wall.

Amanta, Liliana, and Ian all came to see him off.

“My lord, most of the cities along the way should have our forces. If there’s a need, my lord can contact us at any time.” Liliana nodded and smiled. She was wearing a purple dress and black stockings.

“Yes.” Eli nodded.

” The same goes for the Golden Cicada Merchant Association. This is my identification card. You can get a 5% discount at any store. ” Ian handed Ell a golden card.

He had already uploaded the news. The higher-ups should know in a few days.

“Thank you.” Ely smiled as he took it. Actually, he still had Jin Ji’s token, and the discount was even greater.

Amanta stood up straight and said to Eli, “Bon voyage.”

“Alright.” Eli looked at him and nodded. If he didn’t know what he had done, Eli would have believed his good intentions.

After bidding farewell, Ely walked directly to the airship not far away and boarded it.

A few seconds later.

Accompanied by the violent wind elements, the airship suddenly soared into the air and accelerated away.

Ian and Liliana left.

Amanta’s gaze was deep.

‘This time, Clint has really hidden well.’ He had not seen him for a few days, so he must have gone to prepare.

…

“Sir, it seems that you are very popular here!”

As soon as he came up, Alida leaned over, but her eyes were filled with resentment.

The reason was that Eli had gone down alone for a few days, but he refused to let them go down.

But she could understand it. After all, they were too showy. If they all went out, they might scare the Warlocks here. At least before they reached the Bloodline Tower, it was best not to expose themselves.

” I’m almost done. Next, I’ll head straight to the Bloodline Tower. ” Eli nodded.

After a year of long journey, the resources on airships had to be replenished. He also needed to learn some information.

Since he had done all of this, he would not stay any longer. Instead, he would go straight to the Bloodline Tower.

“That’s great!” Alida’s eyes lit up. They were finally returning!

She hoped that things would be better. Their reinforcements this time were very powerful.

Including the original celestial warlock at the main tower, there were a total of four celestials. Although they were still no match for the manticore, they had the power behind them, so it shouldn’t be a problem for them to survive.

And there was also Sir Eli.

She looked at Eli. Although the lord said that he was at the micro star level, she boldly guessed that Eli might be someone at the Nebula level.

The airship soon left Holmes City and entered other regions.

Although there were many Warlock forces in the central continent, each Warlock force had a large number of mortals supporting them. These mortals basically survived under the protection of the Warlock forces. Eli and the others also tried their best to choose public areas in order to reduce trouble.

Along the way, Eli also saw traces of mages on the road and was filled with emotions.

Of course, he did not take the initiative to go down. After all, these had been exposed for thousands of years. There was almost no valuable part left.

Just like that, ten days passed in the blink of an eye.

Eli and the others finally left and entered the western region of the Western Regions.

In the past ten days, they have only been in the outer region of the Sofia Mountain Range. The central continent was not like the West Coast. It was hundreds of times larger, and it took a lot of time to travel.

Just as he left the area.

Holmes City.

In a room.

Amanta sat on the side, and a Warlock stood in front of him.

“You haven’t found him yet?” Amanta asked.

...

” Yes, sir. We’ve used all sorts of methods, but we still haven’t found any traces of Sir Clint. It’s as if he’s gone missing. ” the Warlock reported.

“Alright then.” Amanta’s face was gloomy.

For a full ten days, there was no news of Clint at all. Counting the previous few days, it had been almost thirteen days.

This was too abnormal.

Moreover, Amanta didn’t think Clint would give up the airships.

This was also the part that he could not understand the most.

Where did Clint go?

“Have you contacted the Clint family?” Amanta asked the Warlock.

“I sent a warlock yesterday. We should know by today. ” The Warlock nodded.

“Yes.” Amanda nodded.

The Warlock also lowered his head, but he seemed to know something, and his body froze.

...

He slowly raised his head and said with an ugly expression,” Sir, there’s news about Sir Clint. His family has the Bloodline Soul Lamp, and now the lamp has been extinguished. ”

Amanta’s expression changed.

There was only one possibility for the lights to go out, and that was that Clint was already dead.

But how could he die?

“And Milord, the time when the soul lamp extinguished should have been thirteen days ago in the afternoon.” The Warlock continued.

Amanta was stunned.

He slowly raised his head, and cold sweat gradually appeared on his forehead.

In the afternoon thirteen days ago.

Didn’t that mean that Clint died not long after leaving his room? Of course, it was also possible that he died as soon as he left.

Clint had not caused any trouble recently, so the only possibility was…

“Eli! ” Amanta picked up the glass of water on the table with a trembling hand, but he couldn’t pick it up no matter how hard he tried.

After trying a few times, he picked up the cup, brought the water to his mouth, and took a few sips.

“Damn it. He hid it so well!” Amanta closed his eyes.

Eli was stronger than he appeared. He was probably only able to survive because Ely was too lazy to deal with him.

” This is the Bloodline Tower’s branch warlock? ” Amanta’s heart was beating fast.

You call that a branch?!

Fortunately, he wasn’t the one who made a move this time.

…

Another month passed.

Three huge airships were flying in the sky.

In the airship, Alida and Eli were drinking afternoon tea as sunlight shone through the window.

” Sir, after passing through this area, with the speed of this airship, we should be able to reach the Bloodline Tower in another month. ” Alida was still holding a map as she spoke to Eli.

“Yes.” Eli took a look and sighed.

It had been more than a year, and it was finally almost time.

“Alida, why were you assigned to the West Coast to gather reinforcement?” asked Eli.

“Sir, this is troublesome. I…” Alida seemed to hesitate as she bit her pink lips.

“It’s okay. If there’s any problem, maybe I can help you solve it.” Eli smiled.

If it weren’t for Alida, no one would have come to the West Coast branch.

“Alright, my lord.” Alida nodded and prepared to speak.

Pa, pa, pa!

Someone knocked on the door.

The two of them raised their heads at the same time and listened to the knock on the door in the distance.

Who would come here at this time?

“Come in!” Eli was also very surprised. Speaking of which, no one should come at this time.

Moreover, he was slightly unhappy that his precious time had been ruined.

The door opened, and a third-circle male Warlock walked in.

“Oscar, what happened?” Ely asked. The man in front of him was the Warlock in charge of the Bloodline Tower this time and also the deputy master of the Bloodline Tower.

“Milord, a flying magical beast has appeared in front of us, blocking the sky. It seems like it has ill intentions.” Oscar said.

“Oh? What faction’s sphere of influence are we in?” asked Eli.

Beside him, Alida quickly recovered and came to the map. She then said to Ely, “Sir, this seems to be the Four Seasons Garden Warlock Academy’s territory. A faction with a celestial, slightly weaker than the Bloodline Tower.”

Her expression gradually became serious as she added,” And if I remember correctly, this force has a beneficial relationship with the manticore family. ”

“Oh!”

Eli’s eyes flickered. He never believed in coincidences.

It seemed like the enemy was there to ambush them.

“If a celestial makes a move, I will too.” Eli put down his teacup.

He was very unhappy that his afternoon tea time was ruined.

Hearing this, Alida blinked. She could hear the displeasure in Eli’s tone.

She hoped that this faction would be sensible.

Alida prayed for them.
