502 The Godly Bow is Drawn

The forest foreign races were much faster than Eli had imagined.

Three days later.

In the core area of the green field, a light rose from three directions at the same time.

One of them was a giant toad with silver patterns imprinted on its body. The silver patterns on its body emitted a silver light, like a bright moon. Another was a giant firebird with three huge tail feathers that looked like tassels on its back. It was like a great sun. Finally, there was a huge tiger that emitted a blood-red murderous aura!

All three of them were extremely huge, each of them at least a thousand meters long. The aura they emitted was not weaker than that of Dragon King Giovanni at all. In fact, they were even slightly stronger!

The three were the strongest creatures of the Moon God Toad Clan, the Sun Bird, and the Bloodmoon Demonic Tiger.

The three figures were like gods, dying the sky in three colors. Their huge figures and unique auras shocked and even scared the entire green field.

After the three figures left their respective places, they flew straight toward the elves.

Their goal was very clear.

Countless non-humankind beings watched as the three non-humankind Kings left.

The Feathermen Clan!

Countless Feather Men hid in tree holes and trembled.

” Each of the three kings is a fourth-circle creature. Can Roland really resist them?”The Feather King stood under a large tree and looked at the three figures. He felt his heart clench tightly.

Everyone knew that Roland was very strong, but could he defeat the three foreign kings?

Moreover, these three races were not simple. Each of them had a powerful bloodline. Their bloodline level exceeded level four. Although they did not reach the fifth circle, their combat strength was different from an ordinary fifth circle.

“I hope so.”

He prayed silently.

“I hope he’s dead.” Dragon King Giovanni narrowed his eyes. He was loyal to Eli and was a spy in the Green Field. Naturally, he wanted Roland dead.

“Sigh, let’s fight. I don’t believe that the Mage Alliance will return!” The Dwarf King laughed loudly and put down the one-meter-tall wine cup. The wine inside shook!

They were not the only ones. As the three figures rose up, all the foreign tribes stopped and looked up at the sky, looking at the three god-like figures.

For the first time, they felt their hearts clench.

After all, they didn’t know about Eli’s achievements in the human race. It was useless to know because that was ” Eli “, what did it have to do with Roland?

At this moment, outside the Elven Temple.

“Milord, the three foreign rulers have arrived. They will arrive in half an hour at most. Milord, how should we face them?” Erwin looked at Eli with a worried expression.

“Don’t worry. Half an hour ago, in order to avoid any accidents, the main body gave a weapon to me.” Eli waved his hand and took out a pale golden longbow!

“This is…!”

The Priests behind Erwin were shocked. As elves, they were naturally familiar with longbows. The bow in front of them was probably of a frighteningly high level. It was at least a fifth-circle bow!

But…

Erwin hesitated.

At this moment, Eli had already drawn his bow!

The pale golden longbow was held in Eli’s hand as he moved forward. The pale golden power of faith behind him instantly erupted. The dazzling light even made everyone take a step back involuntarily, and a storm swept up in the surroundings!

Weng!

Eli placed his hand on the bowstring. The bowstring, which was made of some unknown material, began to pull up gradually. At this moment, three faint golden arrows appeared on the string that originally had no arrows.

Fatal… Fatal! ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Everyone took another step back in unison, a trace of horror flashing in their eyes.

“Milord is already making me feel like my life is in danger just by pulling the bow. Just how strong is Milord now?” Erwin couldn’t believe it.

The others looked at each other in dismay.

Only now did they realize that they had still underestimated their master’s strength.

At this moment, the string was already full moon!

The golden light of faith wrapped around Eli. With a soft shout, Eli released his hand, and three rays of light bloomed in an instant.

Weng!

The three rays of light were like plowing soil, and black cracks appeared in the space. The surrounding golden light emitted a brilliant light under their illumination.

In an instant, the golden light disappeared from everyone’s eyes and then split into three arcs.

At this moment.

The three non-humankind leaders were advancing, and countless non-humankind beings on the ground were trembling as they observed.

All of a sudden, some of the foreign races raised their heads.

At the end of their field of vision, there was an extremely brilliant golden light. Within the golden light, there was an arrow-like light. As the distance approached, the arrow light became larger and larger.

“What’s that?”

“How, how is this possible? I can even feel the threat of death from so far away!”

“That direction, it can’t be Roland, right?”

Countless non-humankind beings stared blankly at the scene, at the arrow light that pierced through their eyes.

Their target was none other than the Foreign Leaders!

What would happen…

At this moment, everyone looked at the sky, but their eyes did not blink!

At this moment, the Foreign Leaders of the three factions also made their moves.

The Moon God Toad let out a terrifying croak, and a silver light shot out from its mouth toward the arrow light. The temperature within a few thousand meters instantly dropped, turning into extreme cold. Meanwhile, boundless flames rose around the Sun Bird, and it accelerated toward the arrow light. The Bloodmoon Demonic Tiger also roared and flew toward the arrow light.

Faced with this provocation, the three leaders made the same choice.

Attack! Attack! Attack!

In the next instant!

Almost at the same time, three attacks collided!

The entire green field was instantly illuminated by these three rays of light. Countless foreign races raised their heads to look, but they could not see anything. However, within the white light, a golden light appeared and bloomed.

Then, they heard three wails at the same time.

As the boundless blood mist rose, the white light gradually dissipated.

Countless alien races raise their heads and stare blankly at the sky. The leaders’ huge bodies were still entrenched in the sky. However, a golden light pierces through the three, and countless blood mist comes from their bodies.

Moreover, the three leaders’ bodies seemed to be fixed, unable to move. They could only wail incessantly, and in between, they seemed to be begging for mercy.

“It’s over? How is this possible?”

“You must be joking.”

“They failed just like that. They seemed to be shouting for mercy!”

The foreign races stared blankly at the sky, the shock in their eyes seemingly frozen.

No one could believe that what was supposed to be a great battle had ended just like that!

Giovanni, who heard the wails, raised his head and looked at the three battlefields. His amber eyes suddenly flickered.

‘How could it end like this? Damn it, I’m finished. Could it be that this is another powerful character like Eli? Wouldn’t it be over if the other three died? If I had known earlier, I would have agreed to their invitation. No, if I joined, I would probably die as well.

‘No, I have to immediately ask for help from my lord. I can’t stay in Green Field anymore.’ He got up anxiously and was ready to ask for help from Eli!

He couldn’t stay in Green Field anymore!

Crack!

The wine glass fell again.

The Dwarf King’s mouth twitched, and his eyes froze.

“No way, no way, so strong?” He couldn’t believe it.

Even the lord of the Warlock Alliance wouldn’t be so ridiculous.

“Damn it, what if he comes looking for me? No, even if he comes looking for me, I will never surrender. The Dwarf Race would rather die than submit!” The Dwarf King consoled himself as if he was crying!

Countless people looked at the three leaders.

At this moment, the originally powerful siege was like a joke.

A clown!

In the next moment, three figures were wrapped in golden light.

They wailed as they flew into the sky.
