86 Arrest

Eli, who was familiar with Seviro Mesa, was certain that it was his handwriting.

He might have just finished exploring the mausoleum and immediately shared this letter with Eli before he was caught.

“What did he find?” Eli held the letter, a little confused.

Had he found what Saleen metatrin had left behind? Was it in the mausoleum? Then what was it?

Or was there something in the tomb that allowed him to confirm where Saleen metatrin’s things were?

“Sigh, this won’t do. I have to see seviro Mesa.” After hesitating for a moment, Eli still felt that it would be necessary to meet seviro Mesa.

As for where the former director was? Eli decided to look for his teacher.

…

In the library.

Third floor.

In the director’s study, Eli met his teacher.

“Eli, I thought you didn’t have to work today? Is there something you need from me?” Clement touched the glasses on his nose. His vision had not been very good over the years.

“Yes, teacher.” Eli nodded.

“Speak!” Eli had been with him for more than twenty years, so they understood each other well.

“Yes, teacher. I would like to know the situation of the former director, Seviro Mesa.” Eli said without any hesitation.

Clement suddenly raised his head and widened his eyes. “Don’t get involved in this matter. Bryne the seventh is already very angry. He won’t live for long.

“I also respect the director, but what he did this time was too much. No one can help him.”

Digging up someone’s ancestral grave did seem a little overboard.

However, looking at Eli’s determined eyes, clement’s heart softened again. “it’s true. I know that you have some connection with seviro Mesa, but just give up. No one can save him.”

Eli still didn’t say anything.

“Fine, fine, fine. I’m so unlucky. Why would I have students like you and Herman? I’ll help you find out. Don’t do anything stupid. You’re my student, after all.” Clement sighed.

Clement had no children. Herman and Eli were the closest people to him. At this moment, he was as helpless as an old father.

“Thank you, teacher.” Knowing that his teacher would agree, Eli laughed.

“Why are you laughing? I still have a lot of work to do. You have to help me finish it today.”

“Alright, I’ll do it, I’ll do it. Teacher, you can go and rest.” A light-hearted voice was heard.

A smile appeared on Clement’s face. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

…

No matter what, Clement was now the director of the Imperial Library. His social status and information channels were incomparable to those before. Very quickly, he had gathered what Eli wanted.

Looking at the letter that was handed over, Eli took it.

“This is all the content. Remember to destroy it after you’re done reading.” Clement said as he watched Eli take the envelope.

“Okay, teacher.” Eli was a little surprised. It had only been half a day, and he had actually found all the information. This could only mean that it was not bad to have a library director as a teacher.

“Then, teacher, I’ve finished my work, so I’ll take my leave first.” Eli was almost done with clement’s work, so he prepared to go back and read the contents of the letter.

“Yes.” Clement nodded and watched as Eli walked out the door.

But just as he reached the door, he called out to him.

“Eli, you’re very smart, but don’t do anything stupid. ” Clement was still a little worried.

“Teacher, don’t worry. What can an ordinary person like me do?” Eli smiled and walked out of the room.

…

Soon, he returned home.

He opened the letter and saw that it recorded the entire process.

The cause of the incident was five days ago. A guard of the Imperial mausoleum suddenly felt sick in his stomach while he was on his daily patrol. He wanted to find a forest nearby to settle his problem, but he found a big humanmade cave in the forest instead.

The guard was so shocked that he didn’t even bother to pull up his pants.

He quickly reported it.

A group of two grand knights and more than a dozen knights surrounded the cave. Then, under everyone’s watchful eyes, Seviro Mesa climbed out and was captured. After some investigation, they found that the end of the cave was the imperial mausoleum.

Bryne the seventh was furious, and Seviro Mesa was imprisoned. He would be executed in ten days.

“The director was so unlucky!” After reading this, the corners of Eli’s mouth twitched.

If it wasn’t for the guard’s stomachache, how could he have come to such a remote forest? He wouldn’t have found the hole, and seviro mesa wouldn’t have been caught.

It could only be said that everything was a coincidence.

“Sigh, what a pity!” Eli shook his head, then looked at the address where Seviro Mesa was kept.

In the deepest part of the second imperial prison, room three.

“Alright, I’ll have to make a trip.” Eli turned around and prepared to take action, but in the next second, he was stunned on the spot.

He had to find out about the layout of the prison first!

He took half a day to do that.

The second prison of the kingdom was very luxurious as it mainly held the important people of the Empire and prisoners. Whether it was the walls or the underground, they were made of tough iron and stone, which was a kind of stone with high density.

As for the guards here, apart from a small number of soldiers, the guards were all Knights. There might even be a Grand Knight standing guard here at any time to prevent anyone from escaping.

“There are quite a few guards, but it’s not a whole army. The most important thing is that I can’t cause too much of a commotion, or else reinforcement will come quickly.” Eli gave a simple analysis.

He also took a map of the surrounding area. After all, he was going in to find someone, so he had to be more prepared.

However, to be honest, the danger was not that great.

With a little trick, it was not difficult to sneak in.

Soon, Eli thought of a good way to sneak in.

Although the guards here were Grand Knights, the head Warden was just an ordinary person. He was only able to become the head Warden because he was a member of the great nobles.

Instead of sneaking in, why not just walk in openly?

In any case, he had the faceless mask. After all, this was a Knight’s Kingdom. No one would have thought that there was such a thing.

“Oh, who’s the warden again?” Eli looked at the information he had gathered.

A name came into Eli’s sight.

Kaelun Herm.

Marquis Herm’s third son was an intermediate Knight. He had studied at the Empire’s Knight Academy and became the head Warden of the Empire’s second prison at the age of 26. He had only recently arrived at the Empire’s second prison for a month.

Herm family, wasn’t that the mortal enemy of Alina’s family?

Of course, that wasn’t important. What was important was that he had only been in the position for a month, so he definitely wasn’t familiar with the place. This surprised Eli.

“It doesn’t seem to be too difficult.” A smile appeared on Eli’s face.
