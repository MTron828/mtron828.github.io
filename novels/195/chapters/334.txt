335 The Reappearance of Eli

At this moment.

In the distant bloodline tower.

In a room, Aisha was lying quietly on a bed. Her face was pale, and she was surrounded by warlocks one after another.

There were about twenty warlocks, and all of them had unsightly expressions.

“Everyone, let’s talk about this. Tower master Alice has fallen into a coma, and Kriman has given us an ultimatum. How should we deal with this? ” A Warlock looked at Aisha on the bed and said worriedly.

“I think we should leave this matter to Sir Herman. He hasn’t shown up for hundreds of years. It’s not like he died.” An old Warlock said.

The higher-ups were all third-circle warlocks, so they naturally knew about Herman. That was why they were so determined to reject Kriman.

Their bloodline tower also had a celestial, but it didn’t care.

“Victor is right. Let’s leave it to His Excellency. I heard that Nikola has gone to see his Excellency.” A Warlock nodded, and the others all agreed.

“No need, I’m already here,”

Suddenly, a voice was heard. Everyone turned around and saw that the door was slowly opening.

A man walked out, and everyone looked at him in a daze.

“Lord Herman.” Of course, they recognized Herman. Even if they had never seen him before, they had at least seen the statue.

They all lowered their heads.

“What’s going on? ” Eli walked in, but another person followed. When everyone saw this, they couldn’t remain calm.

“Kriman!” The warlocks’ expressions changed drastically. They looked nervous as they looked at the person who had been their biggest threat recently.

“Don’t worry, I’ve surrendered to master Herman.” He had already changed his clothes, but there were still some wounds on his face.

Kriman looked like he had just been beaten up, and one of his arms was missing.

“Yes, Kriman will be a member of the bloodline tower in the future, so you guys can relax.”

Everyone sucked in a breath of cold air, their faces full of shock.

‘Didn’t Lord Nikola just go to inform him?’

Was the negotiation between true spirits so sloppy? However, when everyone saw the wound on kriman’s face, they realized that this celestial had probably been beaten into submission.

Eli also came to Aisha’s side.

Looking at the person on the bed, a silver light flashed in his eyes. He realized that Aisha wasn’t seriously injured. It seemed that her bloodline power was blocked by a trace of some curse, and the source was Kriman.

Kriman stood up and said, “Let me do it, my Lord.”

He reached out his hand and saw a blood-red glow appear on Aisha’s skin. In the blink of an eye, a portion of her bloodline source was taken away.

Aisha’s body trembled slightly as she slowly woke up.

The moment she opened her eyes, she saw Eli.

“My Lord.”

“The rest of you, leave. Kriman, stay.” Eli said to the others.

Everyone left, leaving only three people in the room.

Eli first explained kriman’s current situation to Aisha, then he instructed her on a few things.

“In the future, if we encounter a strong enemy, just leave it to Kriman,” Eli said to Aisha.

After all, the bloodline tower would encounter some problems in the future, and it couldn’t always rely on him.

“I understand, Grandmaster.” On the hospital bed, Aisha lay down as she spoke to Eli.

“I can help, as long as it’s not too much.” Kriman agreed. He was a celestial, after all.

“Alright, I’ll leave the rest to you guys. I’ll take my leave first. Eli said to the two of them.”

Now that the matter had been resolved, it was time for him to leave.

Before leaving, Aisha promised him, “Grandmaster, don’t worry. As long as I’m alive, I’ll definitely manage the bloodline tower well.”

“Alright!”

Eli smiled, then left.

…..

Two hundred and fifty years later.

Eli stood in front of Aisha’s tombstone with a complicated expression.

Behind him, there were dozens of people in black Warlock robes. Kriman stood at the front.

“My Lord, my condolences.” At this moment, a Warlock walked over and consoled him.

“Yes.” Eli nodded and glanced at him.

Hein had three rings and was temporarily in charge of managing the bloodline tower. Kriman was only still a celestial. He couldn’t take on the position of tower master. He needed to train too.

“Forget it, I’ll leave everything to you, Hein.” Eli looked at him and said.

In the past few years, with Kriman overseeing the bloodline tower, although the territory of the bloodline tower didn’t expand much, the excavation and development of resources were much stronger than 250 years ago. Whether it was the number of higher-ups or the development of the lower-ups, the bloodline tower was much stronger. Kriman also seemed to have resigned himself to his fate and had given him many good things.

For example, the new bloodline cultivation method. It was also from him that Eli found out that the central continent had already abandoned meditation techniques and was researching techniques that were more suitable for warlocks.

The traces of the Mage’s existence were slowly being eliminated.

Eli also took a look at the cultivation method. It was indeed faster for cultivating bloodline. Even though Eli’s intermediate meditation method was slightly inferior, this was the most basic version. However, there was a disadvantage to this as well, and that was that there was almost no mental power cultivation.

There were advantages and disadvantages to this. The advantage was that warlocks could train faster in the future, but the disadvantage was that they almost had no chance to only use mage spells. Bloodlines were the only weapon they could use.

...

“From now on, warlocks and Wizards will have nothing to do with each other.” Eli shook his head, feeling a little sad.

However, this was a good thing for him. At least he had a stronger advantage now.

Besides, what did this have to do with him, a celestial from the West Coast? he might as well worry about the races from the deep sea!

Speaking of this, he felt that it was troublesome.

As time passed, the trouble in the deep sea seemed to be getting bigger and bigger. More and more races ran to the coastal areas. Although the area of the West Coast was not large, new races would arrive every few years.

The most troublesome thing was that these races basically didn’t listen to reason. In any case, they were here to hunt and didn’t care about the bloodline tower at all. There was no other way, so Eli could only kill them.

Thanks to this, Eli’s curse had already reached 50%. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

After two hundred and fifty years of cultivation, he had already reached the Nebula stage of the first celestial mage level. He had accumulated sixty units of stars, and his original strength far exceeded that of ordinary warlocks. With the curse, he wouldn’t even be afraid of a radiant moon marine creature. Even if he couldn’t defeat them, he could still run.

“When will there be a strong enough deep-sea race that doesn’t like fighting and will accept a negotiation with me?”

Eli sighed.

The funeral had already ended, and Eli left after offering a flower.

...

For him, he was still in the stage of hiding. It would not be too late for him to go to the central continent when he was strong enough.

He felt that the day was coming soon. Besides, Eli had not forgotten what was still being nurtured in the light pillar in his body. He had to figure it out first.

“A reasonable deep sea race…”

Eli wasn’t worried about this because he had already predicted that a suitable race would arrive within a hundred years.
