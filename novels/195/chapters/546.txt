547 Myriad Incarnations

Whoosh! Whoosh!

A gentle breeze blew across Cold Scattered City, and a huge sun poked its head out!

In the early morning, residents of all sizes would walk through the city to their respective work places. All the shops would also open for business to attract customers.

But on this day, the city was unusually peaceful.

The bustling morning market was empty, and the bustling streets were silent. Even in the sky, there were no birds chirping. It was like a dead city.

That was the truth!

At this moment, the empty streets were already covered with corpses. Countless blood flowed through the cracks of the bricks and tiles on the streets, then entered the moat and evaporated again. Then, it turned into a blood mist that enveloped the entire city.

In the center of the city, Qigu stood on a tall pile of bones, or rather, on an altar of flesh and bones. Countless souls were wrapped around him, silently transforming his body.

The soul entered his body, causing his flesh and blood to rot, but his bones became harder and harder. The once-aged bloodline emitted vitality again and fused into his soul, making him tremble!

“The soul is recovering. I’m abandoning everything and turning into a lich!”

Qigu touched his delicate bones and felt a burst of joy. Not long ago, his skin was full of wrinkles and decay, which made him feel disgusted, but now they had completely disappeared.

He knew that he had succeeded!

He was already a Lich!

” I obtained the Lich Transformation Technique at the time of my death. It seems like this is fate. Fate doesn’t want me to die just like this.” Qigu pursed his lips and remembered that he had no lips at the moment, so he could only hear the sound of teeth clacking.

He was not used to it.

However, he believed that he would get used to it after some time. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

” However, I had to sacrifice eight cities and a population of nearly five million. Plus, I was a Radiant Sun Warlock before, but I’m a Radiant Moon Warlock now. My combat power had dropped by too much, but fortunately, it was all worth it. I had obtained eternal life.

“I will walk on this land again and live a second life!” Qigu sighed silently.

He lowered his head and looked into the distance. There was a mountain of corpses and a sea of blood. Before the transformation, he felt a little uncomfortable, but at this moment, he actually felt a little desire, even hunger.

However, he knew that this was not the time to eat. He needed to leave as soon as possible.

Even though his phylactery had been successfully created, even though he had hidden it, and even though he would be reborn after death, he still felt a little afraid.

He had seen Eli’s handiwork. He was really afraid. Of course, he was not the only one who thought so. Most of the others felt the same.

” But this time, half of the central continent is involved. Even Eli can’t rush to every place. At most, his Warlocks will handle it. They can’t kill me.” He took a deep breath and turned to leave.

But the next second, he was stunned on the spot.

On the other side of the altar, a figure stood there!

A handsome face, deep eyes, and a familiar figure…

In an instant, his soul fire burned fiercely, and his body could not help but tremble.

“Sir Eli!”

He looked at the person in front of him with fear, his voice trembling.

“Qigu, I’m very disappointed!” Eli looked at him and shook his head.

The man in front of him was one of the two or three second-class forces in the eastern part of the Western Region, the Dusk Python Clan’s family, Qigu Mark. He was also one of the first families to seek refuge with him.

“Milord, I want to live. I’m already too old.” Qigu said bitterly,

“To personally slaughter all of your own bloodkin, as well as the sacrifice of millions of souls, is it worth it?” Eli looked at Mark and asked curiously.

This was also the second condition for Lich’s transformation.

“My lord, you will understand when you reach my age. It is torture to watch your bloodline weaken bit by bit, your soul rots bit by bit, and your life force disappears bit by bit.

“That’s why I didn’t hesitate when the chance to live forever appeared in front of me, even if there was a price to pay, even if I might face unknown consequences.” Qigu shook his head,

The same age as you?

Eli’s expression turned strange.

“Sir, I believe you can understand me.” Qigu raised his head, but his gaze gradually became firm.

“I don’t understand!” Eli shook his head.

“No, my lord, you can definitely understand!”

“I really don’t understand!” Eli looked at the man and shook his head.

“Alright, my lord. How do you plan to kill me? You still want to capture me, but you’ve given up on that idea. I’ve prepared in advance. I can kill myself at any time. Once I die, I’ll be reborn in the phylactery. So, my lord, why don’t you let me go? I promise that I won’t step into the Bloodline Tower for the rest of my life.”

Qigu raised his head and said.

He knew that he was definitely not a match for Eli, but Eli could not really kill him.

“No, you broke the law. You have to die today!” Eli shook his head.

A huge shadow hand slowly appeared and enveloped Qigu. During this process, Qigu seemed to have given up and watched the shadow gradually envelop him.

At this moment, there was no fear in his heart.

” Eli, hehehe, the lifespan of a fifth circle warlock is longer, but you will face death one day. You will understand me one day. I won’t die today. I will wait for you to die in the distance, then dance at your grave and kill your descendants.

“Eli, you lowly creature, you…” Qigu began to curse and insult Eli because he knew that he would not die. He would not die unless his phylactery were found.

Soon, the shadow gradually drowned the body, and his soul gradually disappeared.

During this process, Eli only watched, still calm.

However, a strange gray color seemed to be slowly disappearing with his soul.

..

At the same time.

Tens of thousands of meters away.

In a cave in a mountain range, a phylactery buried there slowly opened, and a soul slowly flew out.

“Hahaha, although I’m dead, scolding Eli is really satisfying. So what if he’s the top expert on the continent? He still can’t catch me!” Qigu said happily. “It’s a pity that I died just like this. It will probably take decades for me to be completely resurrected!” He shook his head and was about to return to his phylactery when a black color suddenly appeared on his body and gradually expanded.

“What is this?” He was stunned and wanted to expel it, but it was useless.

The black color was like a virus, continuously polluting his body, causing his soul to rot piece by piece. This person was completely flustered and lost.

“Impossible!”

However, he did not understand how this could have happened.

He had clearly just died, and his soul was also here. How could he be attacked?

Was it Eli?

No, it was absolutely impossible.

No one could trace the Lich’s body to the phylactery!

At this moment, something shocking happened. After the black spots on his body expanded, they gradually turned into a wisp of aura and flew toward the phylactery.

As it flew, it slowly turned into a black hand and grabbed the phylactery in the blink of an eye.

Kacha!

A crack appeared, and then Qigu felt extremely intense pain, causing him to instantly collapse to the ground, rolling on the ground and wailing.

However, his eyes flashed with another kind of disbelief.

Because that familiar hand was exactly the same as the one he had seen before.

But how was this possible?

Was it really him?

How could a Warlock do this? How could they possibly have a way to deal with the Lich? Even the Warlock Alliance had no way to resurrect a Lich.

Was this Eli?

At this moment, he thought of this powerful man and the calmness in his eyes at the end. Wasn’t it a mockery of his ignorance? The Warlock Alliance was helpless against the Lich, but Eli could easily deal with it.

“Sir Eli, spare my life!”

He understood. He begged for mercy in despair, but the hand did not hesitate at all. It exerted force and turned the phylactery into dust with a crack, scattering it all over the ground.

It was also at this moment that his soul trembled.

He knew that he had lost one of the most important things in his life.

However, there was something even worse…

He lowered his head and saw that the black spots had already covered every corner of his body. His soul had already turned into a black material-like object that was slowly disintegrating.

The phylactery was important, but his soul was even more important because it was his true soul. As long as this soul was destroyed, he would no longer be a person.

As for the phylactery, it was just a place to live. The soul was the key to a lich’s immortality.

Feeling his current state, he was in complete despair.

“Eli, I just want to live forever. What’s wrong with that?”

He let out a mournful cry, and then his entire body was completely enveloped by the black fog. Then, he completely disappeared from the world.

..

“Eli…What did I do wrong?”

The wails echoed in his ears. Eli looked down at the nearly one million corpses and flesh there. He thought of the dead silence in the surrounding cities and denied Qigu’s plea.

“If that’s the case, then I’m sorry. I won’t allow you to live forever!” He raised his hand, and a wisp of black fog appeared in his hand as if it wanted to pollute everything.

The black fog law had the ability to spread infection.

Even if separated by a phylactery, as long as there was a karmic connection, it could be infected. It was a seemingly insignificant law left behind by the Paragon, but it was an important tool for the spread of corruption.

At the same time, it could also help him get rid of the Lich.

Even if they were resurrected after death, Eli could still find their phylacteries.

“Let me end this ‘war’.”

His gaze gradually became firm. He glanced at the city and then continued to fly into the distance. A golden light enveloped him.

He was not the only one. There were dozens of lights flying on the vast land.

Wherever the light reached, the Liches turned into ashes!
