Chapter 43: War

The empire’s winter was very cold.

This year seemed to be even colder than before due to the cold front.

However, to Eli, it was no different. He just had to stay in the Imperial Library and stay at home.

The experiment continued, but it kept failing.

Of course, throughout this process, Eli did not give up on his cogitation because it was the foundation of his wizardry life. He did not neglect his witchcraft at all, and continued to learn new spells.

When he had nothing to do after work, he would occasionally go to the casino to play, but it would not be like before. He would just purely play and try not to cheat.

If he lost, he would go home. If he won, he would go to the nearby Liu Ying Street.

However, due to the powers of wizards, he won more than he lost.

…

In the blink of an eye, more than two months had passed.

Eli received a piece of news.

“The learner test has been postponed? ”

In scholar Clement’s office, Eli was a little surprised.

“Yes, it might be because it’s winter, and it’s not easy for scholars from other places to come here, so they’re planning to postpone it to summer. You don’t have to be too nervous, just relax. ” Scholar Clement comforted.

Eli nodded.

Becoming a learner was only one part of his plan, but it didn’t matter if it was delayed. It wasn’t a big deal any way. In the past, he was only concerned about the salary increase, but now, he didn’t care about the salary from the library anymore.

He only wanted stability.

“Well, delaying it for half a year will also give you more confidence. You should prepare well. ” Scholar Clement looked at Eli in admiration.

He was already old, and it would be difficult for him to rise further.

However, his students still had a bright future ahead of them. After the incident with the count, he admired eli even more. Furthermore, Eli was never late or left early, which made him admire him even more.

Self-discipline was also good quality.

” yes, teacher. I will prepare well. ” Eli nodded, then left the room.

On the way downstairs, he looked at the frost outside the window.

He had an inexplicable feeling that the learner test might not even be held next summer and might even be postponed.

But this time, the reality didn’t go as Eli had expected.

The scholar test was not postponed.

It might be canceled.

This was because the war had arrived.

…

Empire calendar year 310, as the winter was about to end, an earth-shattering event happened in the empire.

The duke of Frostwolf in the north had rebelled and joined forces with the northern grasslands, preparing to betray the empire and establish a new country.

Everything seemed to be just like the rumors in the winter of a few years ago, and it was coming true.

For a time, the empire was in turmoil.

Although there was no news from the king, everyone knew that the storm had begun.

As expected, two days later.

King Bryne the sixth issued an order to gather all the suzerains under his command. He was ready to start a war with the duke of Frostwolf, and he was going to fight in person.

This surprised everyone.

…

Another half a month passed.

This was the first time Eli met the Supreme ruler of this Empire, Bryne the sixth.

He had seen him on the vermilion bird avenue, which led to the outside of the city.

This was a king who could already be considered an old man. He wore silver-white armor and stood straight in front of the war chariot. His beard was a little white, but the aura that he exuded was the most powerful one that Eli had ever seen.

He was sure that it was the peak of a grand knight.

On both sides of the king were knights on horses. Each of them was at least an elite knight. Behind them was a long line of infantrymen. They were dressed in black.

“Could this be the descendant of Saleen Metatrin? ” Eli looked at the old man. it was a pity that he did not have a portrait of Saleen Metatrin, or he might have been able to confirm it.

” the war is about to begin. Should I eat mashed potatoes or goose-breast tonight? ” Standing in the crowd, Eli watched for a while before leaving.

As long as the war didn’t involve Jun Lin city, it had nothing to do with him.

The only unfortunate thing was that this year’s learner test might really be canceled.

…

Time flew by, and a month passed.

The king’s marching speed was much faster than Eli had imagined. In just half a month, they had already arrived at the territory of the Duke of Frostwolf, followed by a large number of other suzerains.

Their opponent was the Duke of Frostwolf and the grassland Alliance.

The war had begun.

A month later, the war was over.

The war ended much faster than eli had expected. He had thought that since the Frostwolf duke dared to assassinate the king and even rebel, he must have been prepared, but he did not expect the duke of Frostwolf to lose so badly in the battle.

However, the Duke of Frostwolf could not be blamed.

It was said that the king was extremely brave, leading a troop directly into Frostwolf fort and pulling the duke of Frostwolf out of bed.

No one expected this. After all, the king was already 70 years old.

The war started hastily and ended even more hastily.

On the day of the king’s triumphant return, Eli had even come to take a look.

He mixed in with the crowd and saw the king again.

He was riding on a pitch-black warhorse with the bloodline of a magical beast. His appearance did not change much from before, but eli could see that the king’s mental strength was no longer as strong as before.

Or rather, it was wilting.

He probably only had a few more years to live.

…

In a short period of three to four months.

So many things had happened, and it had a great impact on many people. With the death of a Duke, a large area became empty again, and a large number of nobles began to devour it like wolves.

However, the king did not bequeathe these titles to them. Instead, he bequeathed them to his second son, or rather, the second Prince, who was also conferred the title of Archduke.

As for the first Prince, this was a Prince that Eli had only heard of but had never met before. Eli guessed that he was already preparing to inherit the throne.

Originally, the king should have no problem living for 30 or 40 years in his previous state, but now he was estimated to live for seven or eight years at most. This was an unexpected ” surprise ” for the first Prince, who was almost 40 years old.

Of course, to eli, these things might affect him through the higher-ups, but the impact would be very limited. After all, the library was not only independent of the empire, but he was only a librarian.

He would only be affected if the whole country fell.Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

As for the learner test, it was canceled, and the next one would be held four years later.

For this matter, scholar Clement even had a heart-to-heart talk with Eli as if to tell him not to be too anxious and to continue working hard.

It really didn’t matter to Eli. Wasn’t it just four years?

He had a lot of time.

Furthermore, he had been in a good mood recently. As time passed, Eli’s potion experiments were becoming more and more perfect. He could feel that the day when he could concoct a low-grade potion was getting closer and closer.

“Everything is getting better and better.”
