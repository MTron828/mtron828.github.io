437 The Tribes Surrender

“You are stronger than I imagined.”

Yu Yun looked at Eli and took a deep breath, but his battle intent gradually rose.

As the top genius of the Feathermen Race for nearly a thousand years, he believed that he was the one who was destined to revive the Feathermen Race. He thought that the person in front of him was just an obstacle on his path. Even if the enemy looked very strong, he was not afraid at all. After all, he was also an existence at the peak of the four-ringed Radiant Sun!

With so many things on his back, he would definitely not lose!

“Come on, let me see what a mage is!” Yu Yun roared and looked at Eli.

At the same time, his huge wings spread out, and a storm that was hundreds of meters tall swept up around him. He roared angrily, and even the sky darkened quite a bit. There was even a faint rumble of thunder in the sky, and the storm was surrounded by lightning. Yu Yun was in the middle of it, looking at Eli with determination.

The environment changed instantly, and the sky turned dark. Many trees were uprooted and swept into the storm.

At this moment, both the elves and the feathermen were staring blankly at this confrontation.

On one side was the powerful Feather man, and on the other side was the legendary Mage!

“Lord Yu Yun will definitely win!”

“Sir, do your best!”

The Feathermen race quickly left, but they were still cheering for Yu Yun. Everyone was filled with confidence that their lord would not lose!

“Sir, do your best!”

On the elves’ side, a few priests felt a little depressed when they saw this confrontation. Only now did they understand that Yu Yun hadn’t even used his full strength to deal with them.

“Sir, you have to work hard!” Erwin clenched her fists and looked at Eli, who was floating in the sky.

Although she had full confidence in Lord Eli, the problem was the main body. This time, it was only the descent of faith, so it definitely could not display its full combat strength. Moreover, Yu Yun was so powerful. Could Lord Eli really win?

“We need to leave.” At this moment, a hand grabbed Erwin’s hand. She turned around and saw that it was the Moon Elf Priest.

“Yes!” Erwin nodded.

Eli looked at Erwin calmly. Thanks to the increase in the power of faith, the power in his body was unprecedentedly abundant. The huge celestial body behind him stretched out and raised his hand. The air in front of him instantly darkened, and countless shadows rushed toward the Yu Yun like a tide.

The storm rushed towards the shadow wave.

” Confrontation! My lord has chosen confrontation! ” The Featherman Race’s celestial looked at this scene in a daze.

The proud lord had indeed chosen this method.

This was a pure power confrontation. There was no technique, but it was very dangerous. If either side failed, they might be instantly shattered by the majestic power torrent!

“Good luck, my lord!” Erwin’s silver eyes flickered as she prayed for Eli!

In the next second!

The storm wave in the sky collided with the shadow sea in an instant. The green wind element and the black shadow instantly divided the sky into two colors. The shock wave from the elemental collision made it difficult for everyone to stand up. After all, all the power was concentrated in the sky!

At this moment, everyone held their breaths and waited for the result.

After three minutes of this confrontation, a change occurred. The black color was expanding bit by bit while the green storm was gradually shrinking!

Yu Yun was at a disadvantage!

“How is this possible?”

” The lord is at the peak of the Radiant Sun. How could he be at a disadvantage?”

“Oh my god, is this a mage?”

The Feather Men, who were originally confident, were panicking. They had not expected this. In their eyes, their lord was invincible, even if the person in front of them was a legendary Mage.

The eyes of the elves lit up, and Erwin gradually raised her head!

“Damn it, I’m being suppressed!” At this moment, within the storm, Yu Yun revealed a shocked expression!

In a direct confrontation, he actually lost.

“No, no, no, how can I lose? I have so much on my shoulders, and I have to lead the Featherman to become the strongest race in the World!” Yu Yun roared loudly. In an instant, the storm became a little bigger and even pushed back the waves of shadows a little.

Not far away, Eli’s mouth twitched as he listened to Yu Yun’s words. However, he did not hold back at all and poured out more power!

Boom!

The shadow waves rolled, and the shadow instantly suppressed the storm again.

“No, no, no, this is impossible!” Yu Yun’s eyes were filled with disbelief. How could the mage in front of him be so strong?

He felt that he could not hold on any longer!

“No!”

Yu Yun’s will collapsed. He flapped his wings and directly escaped from the storm. At this moment, he actually chose to escape!

The Feathermen in the distance were also stunned. Their mouths were wide open. They could not believe that the insufferably arrogant Yu Yun had actually escaped like this!

However, in the middle of a peak confrontation, the danger of suddenly withdrawing power was actually even higher. As Yu Yun left, the storm was instantly swallowed by the Shadow Sea, and then chased after Yu Yun at an even faster speed!

“No!”

Yu Yun turned around and looked at the shadow that was only tens of meters away. He was even more shocked, but he did not have the courage to fight. After the confrontation just now, he already understood the difference between the two of them. He was definitely not a match for Eli! Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

But at this moment, the shadow was also getting closer and closer. Yu Yun also bitterly discovered that he could not escape at all.

“Is it over just like this?”

At the last moment, he suddenly stopped and looked at Eli in the distance. He asked bitterly, “Are all fourth-circle Mages as strong as you?”

“No!” Eli shook his head.

Yu Yun nodded. It was not that he was too weak but that the Mages in front of him were terrifyingly strong, even stronger than a fourth circle warlock.

“It feels good!”

...

As if he had settled a matter on his mind, Yu Yun nodded. Then, in the next second, he fell into the boundless darkness!

…

“We won. Milord won!”

Erwinlooked at the scene in the sky and shouted happily. The other elves also shouted happily.

Not far away, the Feathermen stood rooted to the ground with complicated feelings.

“Lord Yu Yun actually lost.”

“How could this be? Are mages that strong?”

“Is this what a Magus is?”

The Feather Men were in despair. They stood on the spot and even forgot to run. However, many people understood that running was useless. They could run, but could the Feather Men run? And even if they ran, where could they run to?

After today’s battle, would this mage really let the Feathermen race off?

“It’s over!”

...

The invaders closed their eyes!

…

“What? Yu Yun died in the battle of the elves? That Mage has appeared again!”

When the old Feather King heard this news, he almost fainted on the ground.

He actually knew Yu Yun’s movements, but he did not stop him.

But following Yu Yun’s death, he understood that everything was over!

“Feather King, what should we do?” At this moment, there were other Feathermen in front of Feather King. They were all higher-ups of the Featherman race. At this moment, all of them felt despair. Clearly, no one had expected Yu Yun actually to fail.

However, they had to bear the consequences of failure. Even these featherman celestials who had lived for thousands of years were panicking!

They looked at the leader of the Feathermen Race, the Feather King!

After a few minutes, the King sighed deeply and said, “What should we do? It’s already like this!”

“Sir, what do you mean?” A Winged One frowned and asked.

The king slowly sat up straight and looked at everyone.”Everyone, it has been five thousand years. It’s time for us to remember our identities and return to our positions.”

Hearing this, all the feathermen sighed. They naturally understood what the Feather King meant.

The Feathermen were once slaves of the Mages!

“Everything is going to be different!” The King slowly walked out of the green field and looked at the vast green field outside the treehouse!

After today, not only the Feathermen, but many of the other races who had been watching would probably make their choice!

After all, 4,000 years was a long time for the non-cursed races. However, for the top races, their lives were enough to last them through this time. In other words, there were many races waiting.

And the idea that the Mages would return had never been heard of in this green field!

However, the Feathermen used a Radiant Sun-level combat power to confirm this completely.

….

A week later!

In the elven palace.

There were two huge thrones in the temple at the top. One of them was Eli, and the other was Erwin.

At this moment, Eli looked down at the palace in front of him.

At this moment, there were dozens of creatures standing on the ground. Other than a few Elven Priests, there were nearly 30 races with different attitudes. The Feathermen were among them, and it was the Feather King!

“Everyone, tell me. May I know your purpose?” Eli looked at the many races and said calmly.

“Milord, of course, I heard that Milord has returned. You have to know that we have been waiting for Milord!” The first one to walk out was Feather King. He said humbly.

“That’s right, sir. We’re all looking forward to your return!” The other non-humankind beings also lowered their heads, indicating that they would accept the leadership.

Eli nodded. He did not expect this scene to happen, but since he had already put on a show, then he would go all out.

Moreover, just in front of him, he had the combat strength of eight Radiant Suns, far surpassing the Eight-Armed Naga!

“Yes, I’m very happy!” Eli nodded and looked at everyone. “I’m sure everyone knows why I came back this time, but the time for the return of the main group is unknown. However, everyone believes in me, which means that everyone believes in the Mage Alliance.

“I’ve said before that I’ll establish a trade route with the elves and the warlocks. This plan hasn’t started yet, but everyone has their own specialties, so when the time comes, everyone can participate and benefit from it!

Hearing Eli’s words, all the races present were stunned. Clearly, they had not expected this to happen.

However, if they could really establish a connection, it would be a great thing for them!

“Sir, we specialize in the cultivation of demonic plants.”

” We’re mining and smelting metals. ”

“We’re making extraordinary food.”

“…..”

As the races spoke of their specialties, the corners of Eli’s mouth curled up!

He could see a logistic system forming that would greatly benefit him!

As for the Feathermen, Eli also generously chose to forgive them. To him, this was not a big deal.

“That’s great!”

Erwin was also looking at Eli, her eyes shining. As expected of a mage!

The elves were about to rise, although Eli didn’t mention it.

However, there was no doubt that the elves would be responsible for this. This was also a huge opportunity for them!
