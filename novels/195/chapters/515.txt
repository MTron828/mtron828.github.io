516 Hamis Attacks the Army

“So many, so many!”

In the Mage Tower, Eli looked at the eighth and ninth faith imprints that appeared one after another, and his mouth was wide open.

It seemed that the impact of defeating the Hamis family was not small. It had to be known that it was becoming more and more difficult for him to condense his Imprint of Faith. Now, the difficulty of one Imprint was comparable to three Imprints in the past.

However, he still condensed two of them, which showed how big the impact was this time.

At this moment, these marks had already extended from his forearm to his wrist.

“This isn’t very beautiful.” Eli raised his eyebrows.

In the next second, the mark began to move. In the end, it turned into a nine-petal lotus mark on his forearm, occupying only a small area.

“Not bad, that’s good!” Eli revealed a satisfied smile.

“However, I’m afraid that there will still be some trouble ahead, so I have to break through to Thousand Leaves Stage as soon as possible. As long as I break through to Thousand Leaves Stage, the Warlock Union will pose a relatively small threat to me. Even if I can’t defeat them, I can definitely escape easily!

“I need to be stronger, but breaking through the Laws of Shadow is not an easy task. Now that I have broken through to the fifth circle, perhaps I can try to strip away the Black Fog outside of the Laws of Shadow!” Eli narrowed his eyes and took out the Shadow Law.

It was still the same as before, but the gap had shrunk a lot.

” Ever since I broke through to the fifth circle, it’s almost impossible to condense a five-ringed clone based solely on the power of faith. However, it’ll definitely take a long time to research new methods. It’s better to put the power of faith into it and extract the shadow law. This will also be beneficial to my breakthrough.” Eli’s gaze gradually became determined.

He needed to be stronger.

Moreover, this was only one part of his plan. He had to keep up with other methods, whether it was the Explosive Blood Secret Technique or the Eye of Mercury. He had not reached his limit yet.

“I need time!”

Eli condensed a clone with a lot of combat power and stood there. Then, he walked towards the spatial spell formation in the distance.

The space rippled, and Eli entered the secret realm again.

Compared to other places, there was no doubt that this place would buy him a lot of time.

When he arrived at a familiar place, Eli immediately began his plan.

..

Time flew by.

Eli used laws and the power of faith to strip away the rules of the black fog. At the same time, he maintained the Eye of Mercury twenty-four hours a day. This caused his lifespan to decrease, but his proficiency also increased rapidly.

There was also the Explosive Blood Secret Technique.

Eli’s Eye of Mercury reached the limit of the fifth circle. In the same year, he broke through to the fourth level of the Explosive Blood Secret Technique.

In the outside world.

This month was stormy.

On the surface, the Bloodline Tower was deserted due to the Warlock Union.

However, in the dark, all the major forces were contacting the Bloodline Tower. Most of them had given them whatever help they could, including Sea Dragon, Sea Shark Family, Wind God Yao Long, and other families.

Although these families didn’t plan to get involved in this storm, for the time being, they still gave Eli a friendly exchange. Of course, it was in secret. This also meant that the Bloodline Tower had completely entered the circle of friends of the major forces in this world.

Not only that, they had not been doing well recently.

Due to the alliance’s resistance against the Lich Tower in the north, the Warlock Alliance issued a call to arms to all the clans, asking for resources, manpower, and information. The number was huge, except for the Bloodline Tower.

This gave the families a lot of pressure because the Alliance wanted too much.

As for the fact that they didn’t want the Bloodline Tower, that was a clear sign. It was obvious that the Alliance intended to completely destroy the Bloodline Tower. All the clues explained this, including the changes in the Hamis family!

Just like that, as the various families gritted their teeth and gave the Warlock Union a large number of resources, three months passed in the blink of an eye. In the time fragment world, more than thirty years had passed. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“I didn’t succeed, but…”

Eli looked down at the shadow law that had lost three-quarters of its black fog, as well as his almost empty faith lotus.

He had underestimated the difficulty and overestimated himself.

He still failed.

After spending decades, he still couldn’t remove the fog around the Law of Shadow.

“Moreover, the power of faith is almost completely consumed. It will probably take decades for it to slowly recover in the outside world.” Eli pursed his lips.

However, he was not sad. Even if his Explosive Blood Secret Technique had not broken through to the fifth level and his Eye of Mercury had not reached its peak, he did not feel regretful at all.

“Because… I’ve broken through to Thousand Leaves!” Eli smiled.

At this moment, on one of the branches on the side of the shadow of his Twin Tree of Laws, a black leaf with a rich texture swayed slightly in his spiritual world, emitting an extremely condensed power of laws.

That’s right, when he was stripping away the shadow law, his understanding of the shadow law became stronger and stronger. In the end, he directly broke through and became a Thousand Leaves Sorcerer.

“It was an accident!”

Eli was very happy.

After breaking through to this level, the shadow leaf in his body was like a highly condensed shadow law. Its strength had once again soared compared to before, and there was a huge gap between it and the divine tree stage.

At this moment, he no longer needed to worry about the upcoming crisis.

Because even the Upper Three Families only had Thousand Leaves Warlocks. At most, they were able to delay Eli. They couldn’t kill him.

If he wanted to run, there was almost no one who could stop him.

“I wonder if the Hamis family would come alone without the support of the other families. That would be interesting!” Eli gave a strange smile, but he felt that it was quite possible.

Based on the evil families in the Alliance, they could do this.

“However, it’s a pity that I didn’t manage to extract the Laws of Shadow. I can only wait for the future.”

Eli put away the rules and decided to return to the Grassi Land to take a look.

Soon, he returned to the familiar tower.

After walking out of the place, he looked at Hill and Hydra.

The strengthened Eye of Mercury allowed him to see even more. At this moment, Hill was really one step away from a fourth-circle, and he would be able to advance in three years at most. On the other hand, Hydra had also benefited from this misfortune, and it had the potential to advance to the fifth circle.

“Who would have thought that the seed picked up by the human kingdom would be able to advance to the fourth ring after thousands of years? Even a chimera with an ordinary elemental core would have to break through to the fifth ring.”

Eli sighed. Compared to humans, these were the ones who had accompanied him the longest.

“This is not bad.”

Eli smiled and returned to the Tower. He was ready to familiarize himself with his new power and see if he could condense a few more leaves of law.

In the blink of an eye, a month had passed in the outside world.

At this moment, Eli had condensed two more leaves, one of which was the Leaf of Time Laws. The other side was no longer bare, but it was a little unbalanced, making him feel a little uncomfortable!

At the same time.

The outer layer of the Warlock World.

Azak looked at the space fragment that had finally opened and said loudly, “The 78th generation Patriarch of the Hamis family requests the Patriarch to solve the Hamis family’s current predicament.”

“Humph, I know all the trouble you have caused these days. It’s true that I’ve only slept for a few hundred years, and this happened.”

A voice rang out in his ear. He turned his head abruptly and saw a white-robed warlock looking at him with a gloomy expression as if he was very angry.

“Sir, I’m wronged!” Azik wanted to argue.

“Alright, you have to bear the responsibility for what happened. The position of the family head will be handed over to someone else.” The white-robed Warlock glared at him and scolded angrily.

Azak nodded with difficulty but did not refute.

This was because the person in front of him was his great-great-great-grandfather, the only Divine Tree powerhouse in the Hamis family, Hamis’ pillar that supported the heavens!

“Alright, let’s go back to the Warlock World. I want to see which newly promoted Germinal Warlock has such strength.”The white-robed warlock sneered after he dismissed Azak.

“Yes.”

Azak lowered his head, the hatred in his eyes for Eli burning again.
