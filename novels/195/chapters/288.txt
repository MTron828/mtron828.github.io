289 Situ’s End

Half a day passed in the blink of an eye.

At this time, on the plains, thousands of Holy tower warlocks who were bound were gathered together. Not far away, there were bound magical beasts and logistics personnel.

It was as dark as the ocean.

Not far away, in the sky.

Eli looked at this scene with a calm gaze, and Vivika was beside him.

“Thanks to teacher’s help, we have achieved an unprecedented victory,” Vivika said respectfully to Eli. Eli nodded.

From where he was standing, he could clearly see the Holy tower main city in the distance.

At this time, the area was filled with noise and clamor that spread for dozens of miles. Occasionally, one could even hear the sounds of battle. It was the battle between the warlocks who had entered the city!

“Teacher, the Holy Tower City is full of defeated soldiers. We can clean it up in three days at most. Besides this place, the warlocks of the bloodline tower have already gone to various places to occupy the remaining forces of the Holy tower. We estimate that they will complete the occupation within a month. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“From now on, the entire south-central part of the West Coast is in our hands!” Vivika smiled as she spoke to Eli.

“Fine, how’s Hydra?” Eli asked as he nodded.

In that battle, Hydra suffered serious injuries. Fortunately, it was an elemental creature, so the effects were not great. However, its strength had still been reduced.

“Yes, Lord Hydra has already recovered. He has almost swallowed all the magical beasts that died on the battlefield!” Vivika said.

Everyone knew that Hydra could recover from its injuries by eating.

“Oh right, teacher, there’s one more thing I have to report to you!” She suddenly said.

“What is it?” Eli turned his head, a little curious.

“Situ ran away. Our people didn’t find him in the follow-up search!” Vivika was a little guilty.

“It doesn’t matter. Let him run!” Eli shook his head.

It’s just Situ, it’s not a big deal.

Moreover, even if he ran, it might not be any better than being caught.

“Give me a copy of the Holy tower’s information. I’ll see if there’s anything I need. I’ll focus on whether there’s any information on breaking through to the celestial realm!” Eli ordered.

The Holy tower had been destroyed, and he would be safe for a long time.

He could also consider breaking through.

The celestial was not a small bottleneck!

“Yes!”

Vivika remembered everything that Eli said.

“I’ll be returning to the bloodline tower. I’ll leave the rest to you!” With that, Eli prepared to leave.

Vivika looked at Eli’s back, took a deep breath, and prepared to head forward to command the team.

But suddenly, Herman turned his head around.

“Teacher, do you have any other instructions?” Vivika raised her head and looked at Eli.

“The war is over. Don’t strain yourself too much. Have a good rest.” Eli said, then turned to leave.

“Alright,” Vivika showed a bright smile.

..

A month’s time passed in a flash.

Under the bloodline tower’s attack, the remaining Holy tower forces were taken over one by one. The bloodline tower’s flag was also hung all over the central and Southern parts of the West Coast.

Since then, the situation on the West Coast had changed again.

The bloodline tower became the only owner of this place.

A large number of supplies were also transported to Eli’s place in the process.

Eli also began to take stock of his loot.

After an inventory check, he found some things that were useful to him.

A Mage tool and a box of books.

The mage tool was a bracelet called the Mithril bracelet.

The Mithril bracelet was a third-circle mage tool. It was made of precious Mithril and covered with complicated mage runes. It was a good item left behind from the mage era.

Its function was to create a special force field around him, which could control the gravity in a certain area, which was very helpful in close combat. After all, there were many warlocks now, and Eli had to think about the problem of close combat.

Moreover, this weapon was already close to the limit of the third circle. It was very powerful.

After all, at his current level, there were not many things that could interest him.

On the other hand, the other box of books made Eli happy.

This box of information was all that Eli needed.

One of them was about the soul, while the other was about mechanics.

The soul aspect would be helpful to his research of soul runes, and the knowledge of mechanics could help him break through to the third-circle mechanics and from there, open the box that had not been opened all this time!

He had been coveting that box for a long time.

In fact, it was the same for the soul runes. Up until now, he had not been able to research anything. Of course, it could also be related to the fact that he did not put too much effort into it.

But what happened next was good. It was foreseeable that he would have a lot of time. As long as the hourglass didn’t go crazy, he would have a lot of free time to study.

“Oh, right. At this time, he should have run back to the hourglass.” Eli suddenly thought of Situ, the person who had escaped everyone’s eyes.

...

He had learned some information about the time hourglass from the third circle warlock.

It was likely that Situ would not have a good ending if he returned!

..

Time slipped.

In the hall city, there was a tall white building. The building was built in white, and a scale was carved in the center!

A trial was in progress.

The Chief Judge sat on the judge’s seat, leaning back against the red velvet high-back chair. He lowered his head and looked at a man not far away, then sighed deeply.

“Situ, your recklessness caused the hourglass to lose a lot of resources and Lord Klay. You also provoked a powerful force and warlocks. Do you plead guilty? ”

“I plead guilty!”

Situ closed his eyes.

He was wearing a gray wizard robe, which belonged to the hourglass of time. He had been stripped of his qualifications, and his hands and feet were cuffed, which were especially used to restrain warlocks.

...

He had run away on the battlefield, but when he returned, he was faced with the judgment of the hourglass.

He knew this, but he had no other choice.

He might still be able to survive here, but it would be a little miserable.

“Alright, since you’ve admitted your guilt, I’ll strip you of your bloodline and imprison you for life!”

“Do you have any objections?”

In the end, the trial was passed, and Situ sighed.

“No objections!”

“Alright!”

With the hammer of judgment, his fate was judged.

Soon, Situ was pulled into a room. Accompanied by a painful and mournful scream, Situ was pulled out. At this time, his body was covered in wounds, and his bloodline had been directly deprived.

Situ was almost unable to move at the moment as he was being pulled.

Next, he would be sent to prison.

However, before he could leave this place, a person blocked his way.

“Situ, look at you. Not only did you fail, but you also implicated master Klay.”

A voice sounded, and the weak Situ raised his head.

“Andrew, are you here to laugh at me?” He looked at the person and said bitterly.

It was Andrew, the leader of the other faction in the hourglass. There were two warlocks behind him!

Andrew shook his head and looked at Situ with pity.

“I’m just here to ask about Herman’s situation. We’ll be going back sooner or later, so I want to know more about this enemy.”

“Him!” Situ thought for a moment and said, “If you want to deal with him, then forget it. I’ll give you a piece of advice. Unless he’s dead or our Lord awakens, you’d better not have such thoughts.”

Andrew was silent.

He had heard about Herman’s situation and just wanted to confirm it.

Is there really such a powerful third-circle warlock?

“Alright,” he said. Andrew nodded and stepped aside, allowing the staff to pull Situ away.

After seeing Situ disappear at the end of the tunnel, the person beside him asked, “My Lord, do we need to get rid of him?”

Andrew shook his head. “he has already lost his bloodline. What else can he do? just let him die of old age in prison.”

“Yes!”

“let’s wait for the Lord to wake up. We’ll talk about other things then. For now, withdraw all forces and let the house of bloodline run wild for one or two hundred years. We’ll return later.”

Andrew said calmly.

“Yes!”
