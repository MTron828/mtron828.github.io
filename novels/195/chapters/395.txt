396 Eli’s Attack

When the sound of the horn spread throughout the sky of Nightfall City, the atmosphere of the entire battlefield instantly changed.

On the battlefield, all the Warlocks of the Akasha family raised their weapons high. Their bloodlines erupted, and in an instant, the sky turned red because of the large amount of blood aura. The birds also let out sharp cries, piercing through the void, and the huge throwing weapons began to spin.

The Bloodline Tower’s side was similar, but they lacked flying magic beasts.

The Warlocks of the Bloodline Tower on the ground held their weapons nervously and took a deep breath. Facing the Akasha family, everyone felt very nervous. Rafik held his weapon tightly and mixed in the crowd. He felt his blood boiling!

Suddenly, he heard a whoosh.

He looked up and saw a round stone with a radius of four meters shooting out from a distance, flying straight toward Nightfall City. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

The huge round rock streaked across the air, bringing with it a scorching heat and a trail of flames. At this speed, even a second-circle Warlock would not dare to take it head-on!

There were more than a dozen huge round stones following this huge rock, like a meteor shower streaking across the night sky.

Rafik looked back, and the other Warlocks also looked up.

The boulder was very fast. In the blink of an eye, it crossed a few hundred meters and flew directly toward the city wall.

However, what puzzled the Warlocks of the Akasha Family was that the Warlocks in Nightfall City did not seem to care about it.

At the very back of Akasha’s team was a huge war chariot. Other than Mam, the rest of the celestials were there.

” Eh? What is Bloodline Tower doing? ” A Warlock was puzzled.

“I really don’t understand. Are they not going to run or defend?” The Warlock was also confused.

“Could it be?” Pavao, who was at the front, did not say a word. He only looked at Nightfall City.

Under the sunlight, the bright patterns on the walls of Nightfall City seemed to be flickering with light, emitting a faint elemental aura.

Could it be that there was something wrong with those lines?

In the next second, just as the round stone was about to hit the city wall, the silver pattern suddenly exploded. Ripples were discovered, and everyone saw a huge silver membrane instantly extend along the city wall, turning into a huge shield that enveloped the entire city.

Bang!

The huge round rock hit the membrane, and with a buzzing sound, the membrane was slightly bent. However, the speed of the huge rock also slowly decreased, and in the end, it slowly fell to the ground. The same effect happened to the dozen or so huge round rocks that followed.

“What is this?”

The Warlocks of the Bloodline Tower opened their mouths wide. Such a fast round stone was actually blocked so easily.

Moreover, this was not just the city walls. This thin membrane had almost enveloped the entire city, completely rendering the long-range attacks of the Akasha Family useless.

The Warlocks of the Akasha Family frowned. The Bloodline Tower seemed to be different from what they had imagined.

” It’s just a small trick. Since long-range attacks are useless, let’s destroy the Bloodline Tower directly. ” Pavao frowned.

” Attack! Destroy the Bloodline Tower’s defense! The flying army will join the battle! ” Pavao’s vigorous voice instantly spread throughout the entire battlefield, and the fighting spirit of all the Warlocks was once again ignited.

It was just a small setback. They were the Akasha family!

The Warlocks began to move, rushing towards the Bloodline Tower.

The flying Magical Beast Army in the sky was even faster.

” Brothers, let’s show the Bloodline Tower our power! ” The leading Warlock of the Flying Legion shouted.

The Warlocks laughed and commanded the magical flying beasts beneath their feet.

This time, they had observed the situation and realized that the Bloodline Towers didn’t bring any magical flying beasts with them.

The remaining Warlocks took the lead and flew into the distance. They soon arrived above the Bloodline Tower. At this time, he also saw that there were many covered objects on the walls of Nightfall City.

“What’s that?”

The Warlock was slightly confused.

However, in the next second, he saw the Warlocks on the city wall lift the curtains, revealing what was underneath.

They were like giant cannons. Runes were engraved on the three-meter-long barrels, and there were 30 huge bases fixed on the city wall, making the Warlocks feel instinctively uneasy.

“What are those?” The Warlock’s throat moved slightly, and he even forgot to attack for a moment!

The other flying Warlocks also felt uneasy.

“Fire!” The words of a Warlock on the city wall pulled them back to reality.

In their eyes, the patterns on the huge cannon barrel instantly lit up, and the surrounding elements gathered towards the cannon barrel. A large number of elements were magically gathered by the spell formation, emitting a unique light.

“What?” The Warlock’s throat moved slightly, and his heart seemed to be gripped tightly at this moment.

He felt that if he did not run, he would definitely die.

He stepped on the flying magic beast under his feet and wanted to change direction, but the energy of the giant cannon had already been gathered.

In the next second, a scorching elemental cannon flew toward him at an extremely fast speed. Before he could react, his body had already melted.

“No!” The other Warlocks widened their eyes and cried out in fear.
