367 You Call This a Branch Tower?

On the ground, countless Warlocks looked up at this scene.

“West Coast Tower? Do we have such a branch?” A Warlock asked the Warlock beside him in confusion.

“I think so, but we haven’t contacted each other for a long time.” The Warlock replied.

” But the west coast seems to be a very barren place. The branch there should be very weak, but this branch feels a little off! ” The Warlock was confused.

Looking at Hydra beside Eli and the commotion that had just happened, it was clear that this tower was strange.

The battlefield between Vya and Glen.

Glen clutched his chest, also looking confused.

The west coast tower was still there. He suddenly understood why Alida was reacting this way.

However, he did not know how strong this person was. However, since the giant snake had a man as its master, it meant that this person’s strength should be at least stronger than the giant snake. Could it be Nebula level or even stronger …

“That’s not possible. “Glen shook the idea out of his head.

However, even if it was a Nebula level, it seemed to be ridiculously strong compared to their main tower.

You call this a branch?!

…..

On the other side.

Sensing Eli’s killing intent, Jalin narrowed her eyes, and the blood in her body gradually increased.

Although she couldn’t sense Eli’s strength, since Eli said that he was from the west coast tower, he was probably at most the same level as her, which was Radiant Moon-level.

Knowing that Eli was only on the same level as him, Jalin calmed down.

“Then come.” Jalin snorted coldly. In the next second, her bloodline surged, and a 150-meter-long manticore appeared in front of Eli.

The enormous body shook the battlefield. Everyone could feel the terror of Radiant Moon Warlock. Even Glen felt his breathing stop. Radiant Moon and Morning Star were two completely different levels.

In the next second, Jalin, who had transformed into a manticore, stepped into the air and bit at Eli.

Its massive size stirred up the surrounding air, forcing all the magic beasts and Warlocks in the sky to descend, afraid that they would be killed by the shockwaves.

“Is this Radiant Moon? She’s too strong!”

” This Warlock is probably going to die. I don’t know why he has the courage to come out. ” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“How ridiculous. I was really shocked just now.”

The Manticore Clan’s Warlocks on the ground raised their heads as if they had already witnessed the death of this Warlock.

“No matter who you are, you will die here today.” Jalin roared and waved her sharp claws at Eli.

Eli held his magic staff, and the silver eyes in his eyes were activated to the extreme for the first time. A huge amount of mental power was being consumed, and an unknown amount of life force was burning. This was the first time that this power, which many mages were afraid of, erupted with all its power.

In the sky, Eli’s eyes were shining with silver light. In front of him, a huge amount of mental power transformed into a sickle.

The scythe was invisible, and only Eli could sense it directly. However, the power contained within it was terrifying.

Even Eli himself did not dare to say that he could withstand it.

The roaring manticore and the exploding psyche scythe.

In the next moment, the scythe was swung at Jalin like a god of death waving his scythe.

The Manticore was still roaring, but in the next second, fear flashed across its eyes. Although she could not see it, she instinctively felt uneasy.

She only felt it when the sickle brushed past her neck, but it was too late.

The scythe swept past, and her soul was instantly split into two.

“No!” The endless pain and fear made Jalin let out an instinctive cry, but her eyes gradually dimmed.

Following the inertia, Jalin finally arrived in front of Eli. However, she had directly transformed into her original form and fell to the ground. However, she was swallowed by Hydra, who was beside her. After swallowing her, Hydra revealed a proud expression and returned to Eli’s side.

The entire battle lasted less than three seconds.

Jalin was already dead.

With Jalin’s death, the entire battlefield was in a daze for half a minute. Only after half a minute did someone speak.

“She died just like that?! A Radiant Moon Magus of the manticore, a Magus who could easily kill Lord Gorin, died just like that?”

” How is this possible? Is this an illusion? ”

“This must be fake!”

Countless warlocks of the Manticore Clan instantly fell apart. No one could accept that the Radiant Moon Jalin had been instantly killed by the tower master of this branch!

You call this a branch tower of the Bloodline Tower?

It wasn’t just them. The other celestials were also stunned.

On the ground, Arona looked confused. He stared blankly at the sky, and a few words kept repeating in his mind.

Lady Jalin seemed to be dead?

The life force was dead?

She was indeed dead.

Alona was a little tired of talking to himself, but this was the only thing he could do because he could not understand.

She was a Radiant Moon Warlock!

She died so easily. How strong was her enemy? It was this man who called himself the West Coast Tower Master.

In the sky, Glen and Vya looked at each other with their mouths wide open.

...

Like Arona, Vya couldn’t believe it, but the story happened right before her eyes, so he had no choice but to believe it.

She looked at Glen, who was standing opposite her, and seemed to be even more shocked than she was.

“This is our tower branch?”

Listening to Glen’s repeated words, the corner of Vya’s mouth twitched.

Indeed, if this were really a branch tower of the Bloodline Tower, then the main tower would be too useless.

Of course, she knew that the most important thing now was to escape.

She immediately shouted at Arona on the ground, “Arona, split up and run.”

In an instant, she ran in a direction far away from Eli. Arona also reacted and chose another direction. At least this way, at least one of them could run away.

But what shocked the two of them was that Eli didn’t chase after either of them.

“Is he letting us go?” Vya was puzzled. In the next second, she saw a huge undead chasing after her from the airship in the distance and blocking her.

Sensing its aura, it was a celestial.

...

” Bloodline Tower Undead, Nikola! ” Nikola blocked Vya’s path.

On the other side, Arona was blocked by Hydra.

The two who were stopped looked desperate, especially Vya. He didn’t expect there to be a celestial.

Three celestials!

This was too ridiculous.

“You call this a tower branch?”

” Ah! ” Vya cried out in despair. Even the Manticore Family, their superior force, the Six-Armed Naga Family, wasn’t this arrogant.

“I surrender!”

On the other side, Arona chose to resist, and then, in front of Vya, he was slapped to death by Eli.

“Hey!” Vya sighed deeply and looked down.

With Jalin’s death, the Warlocks on the ground weakened their willpower. However, with the death of Alona and Vya’s surrender, all the Warlocks collapsed.

All the third-circle warlocks ran in all directions, including the Warlocks on the ground.

However, to everyone’s horror, the airships in the sky opened up again. Countless figures flew out, and each of them had already reached the third circle. There were as many as 120 people because they had broken through a little more on the way.

“How is this possible? How can this be a sub-tower?” One of the Warlocks turned around and looked at him in despair.

You’re telling me this is the west coast tower?!

He was not the only one. At this moment, both the warlocks of the Manticore Family and the Warlocks of the Bloodline Family felt that their worldview had been shattered again and again, almost to the point of being smashed into pieces.

The Warlocks of the Bloodline Tower were especially confused. They were immersed in the joy of surviving a disaster, but on the other hand, they were shocked and confused. They were shocked by the power of the West Coast Tower, and they were confused about whether they were really the main tower. Did they have such a tower?

On the other side, although Eli had many people, they were definitely not enough to encircle and suppress all the Warlocks.

Thus, Eli extended his hand. Within a few miles, a huge shadow birdcage appeared, blocking all the Warlocks.

This time, the Manticore Clan’s Warlocks were in complete despair.

Then came the slaughter. The Warlocks of the branch tower and the main tower killed together, and even the injured Glen joined in. For a moment, the smell of blood in the birdcage was ridiculously thick, and the ground was almost covered in a layer of blood. It was dark red and terrifying.

The massacre lasted for half an hour.

With the exception of Vya, all the Warlocks shouted excitedly.

At this moment, they finally realized that they had won.

“We won!”

As the sound of victory spread, even the entire Bloodline City was in an uproar. Countless cheers resounded throughout the world.

At the same time, everyone turned their eyes to the sky, looking at the man who claimed to be the Tower Master of the Bloodline Tower’s West Coast Branch.

He was the one who killed Jalin.

He was the one who saved the Bloodline Tower.

At this moment, Alida shouted from the city wall, ” That’s Sir Ely. ”

A voice rang out. One person began to call out Sir Eli, followed by ten, a hundred, and in just ten seconds, everyone shouted the same name in unison.

“Sir Eli.”

Everyone looked at Eli in admiration. Even the Warlocks, who knew Eli’s strength, were extremely excited. The Warlocks in the airship also shouted, as if this was the only voice in the world.

Eli lowered his head and saw that a second faith imprint was slowly forming on his arm. The power of faith was slowly accumulating, and some changes were taking place. Eli needed to feel it carefully later, but he gained a lot.

It could only be said that this landing was very timely.

The shouting continued for half an hour, but Eli didn’t stop it. The power of faith kept increasing until it was one-third full. With just tens of thousands of people, they had done something that a million people on the West Coast couldn’t do in decades.

The cheers lasted for half an hour before they finally stopped.

But everyone was still looking at Eli.

Eli stood in the air. From afar, a nervous Warlock walked over with his hand on his chest. He knelt down in the air. It was the Bloodline Tower Master, Glen.

He knelt in front of Eli and shouted in front of tens of thousands of people, “Sir Eli!”

Looking at this scene, Eli fell silent.

Wasn’t he the branch tower master?

The person in front of him seemed to be the main tower master!

There was a bit of confusion!
