162 Dispute

The next day.

As usual, Eli came to the third floor of the White Tower. As a member of the Council, he also had an office here, and it was very large.

“Milord, these are all the recent matters!”

Wearing an off-shoulder dress, Evena walked in with a document in her hand, shaking her rabbit ears.

“Did anything happen recently?” Eli asked curiously.

!!

“It’s been quite peaceful recently. It’s just that with the expansion of our forces, it’s inevitable that there will be friction with the Blood Alliance. But it basically doesn’t affect us.” Answered Evelina.

“That’s good. Then, you can distribute the potions and other magic plant resources to the camps and forces according to the previous proportion. I won’t care about this.” Eli laughed.

“Alright,” Evena forced a smile.

Seriously, Eli used to work for him, but now it was the other way around. Evena felt sad. She couldn’t go out to gamble again today.

“Oh, that’s right, there’s something else I need to tell you, my Lord.” Evena put down the document as if she suddenly remembered something.

“Oh?” Eli glanced at Evena.

“A new mage ruin has recently appeared on the border between the Blood Alliance and the White Tower, and there has been a great conflict. The nearby mage camp has asked us to ask for some magic potions.”

“Mage ruins?” Eli was puzzled.

“That’s right, this just happened, and it should be spread tomorrow. It’s said that it’s the remains of a very rich Mage. There are many precious plants, some magic tools, and a large number of elemental crystals. In any case, it should be the richest ruins recently discovered,” said Evena as she recalled.

“Oh? ” Eli’s eyes lit up. Not to mention magic potions and magic tools, but a large number of elemental crystals … Was this real?

For now, if Eli wanted to go further, he would have to improve his mage abilities, but the annoying thing was that his mental power was improving at a slow speed, and that was thanks to the blood bamboo flower in the second circle.

However, the first circle breakthrough required not only spiritual power but also elemental essence. These two factors were mutually restrictive, but there were very few items that could increase elemental essence, and the most common one was probably elemental crystals.

However, it was only relatively common. Elemental crystals were something that warlocks had long stopped producing. Even the White Tower did not have any stock, which made Eli feel very helpless.

Upon hearing that there were a large number of elemental crystals, Eli was overjoyed. However, he did not show it. Instead, he nodded and said to Evena, ” yes, I understand. I’ll agree to their request. We’ll talk about it later.”

“Alright,” Evena nodded and left.

As he watched Evena leave, Eli fell into deep thought.

To go or not to go?

If he went, he might get a large number of elemental crystals, which was very important to him. However, it did not seem to be a big deal if it did not have any. At most, he would just wait for the time to come.

Who knew what was in the secret realm?

If the blood Alliance sent two or three second-ring warlocks, even he would be at risk if they surrounded him.

After all, this matter was over. If White Tower brought back elemental crystals, he could buy them. But if they didn’t, then he would just pretend that this matter never happened.

“Forget it, forget it.” A few minutes later, Eli gave up on the idea.

It’s better to be more cautious. Besides, they still didn’t know how to excavate the ruins and what the situation is like.

…

The next day.

Eli had also confirmed the authenticity of the matter through official channels.

A secret plane had indeed been discovered, and it was in the buffer zone between the two forces. It was suddenly discovered during the battle between the two forces, which led to the subsequent events.

And after Eli confirmed it, he wasn’t in a hurry, because according to his understanding, this kind of confrontation that involved two forces definitely needed to be discussed.

As expected, in the afternoon.

Eli received news that there would be a meeting tomorrow, and the content was to discuss how to deal with the arcane realm.

The next day.

Eli arrived at the meeting room early. Other than him, there were only three other people present.

“Eli, you’re actually here so early. How strange!”

At this moment, the gate opened, and a man in Black and red clothes walked in. It was Rawls, who was also a Member of the council.

“For the sake of the White Tower!” Eli nodded. The two of them were usually quite harmonious when they communicated face-to-face. After all, they were both adults.

Rawls revealed a smile as he sat on his seat silently.

As time went by, the members of the parliament arrived one by one. Chairman Minister and vice-minister Kratos had also arrived, but there were still some missing members, such as Deputy minister Jesse and Theron.

“Well, there are ten people this time. Not bad.” Chairman Marcus sat in the middle and looked around.

They were the highest level of authority in the entire White Tower, so naturally, it was impossible for everyone to be there all the time. Having ten people was already a lot.

“Then let’s start.” Marcus coughed. He was already very old.

“I’ll explain the situation first. The secret plane we discovered this time is a medium-sized secret plane. Inside it is the remains of a Mage Academy, and it seems that a large part of this Mage Academy was warlocks.

“As everyone knew, when the Magi left, they took away most of the knowledge. There was also a lot of knowledge on the path of warlocks, and some of the Warlock’s training tools were also taken away. However, there could still be some inside these ruins. In addition to the magic plants inside, this secret plane could be classified into Grade Three according to the resources.

“Currently, we’re discussing sending people in with Blood Alliance. When the time comes, both parties will only send in the first and zero-circle warlocks. Then, we’ll distribute the rewards according to how many resources we obtain. Right now, we need a second circle warlock as a leader.”

The resources in the White Tower were divided into five grades. Grade 1 was the lowest, Grade 5 was the highest, and Grade 3 was already not a low evaluation.

Everyone nodded when they heard Marcus’ description. It was indeed a secret plane with rich resources, but that was all. It was common to find a few ruins every year, but most of them belonged to Mages. They believed that this time it was no exception. Plus, they had to deal with the Blood Alliance as well.

“Um, what do you guys think?” Marcus looked at everyone and asked.

“Um, I think we still have to fight for it, but it’s up to whoever is willing to go. After all, not everyone is willing to go.” Kratos said first.

“Yes.” Marcus nodded and hesitated, ” in fact, the secret realm is not a particularly big matter, but this time it is in the middle of two forces, so it is more sensitive. This is also the first time since the establishment of the White Tower that there was a direct collision with the blood Alliance, so the secret realm is not a big deal. The main point is the friction with the blood Alliance.

“We can’t show too much weakness. That’s why we need someone who can make decisions.

“Everyone here is a representative. Who has any ideas?” Marcus looked at everyone and asked.

The Parliament fell into silence for a while.

“If no one wants to go, then I’ll just tell you my thoughts.” Said Marcus as he looked at the crowd.

“Forget it. I’m the strongest. Since this is the first collision, let me do it.” Suddenly, Kratos, who was beside Marcus, spoke.

Eli didn’t expect Kratos to be involved in this matter.

“En, that’s fine too. You’re a late-stage two-circle warlock. That’s enough.” Marcus was not angry at being interrupted. Instead, he was happy. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“However, I need some help. Therefore, I plan to let Herman and Rawls go with me!” Kratos knocked on the table and said.

“Oh?” Marcus looked at Kratos in surprise and thought for a moment. “Of course, but it depends on Herman and Rawls’ opinion.”

According to the order of the Parliament, the members had the right to refuse.

On the other side, Eli was also stunned. Ah, he was stabbed in the back by Kratos.

However, since Kratos had already mentioned it, he felt that this matter was not that simple. Also, no one had seen through his disguise so far. Everyone assumed he was a first-circle warlock when he was not.

The other party only consisted of one second-circle leader. What was he afraid of?

“I can.” Eli raised his hand.

“I can do it too.” Rawls raised his hand excitedly as well, his eyes fixed on Eli.

All these years, he’s always treated Eli as an opponent, but he’s never won once. This was another opportunity.

“Hmm, only Rawls and Herman will attend it this time. Does anyone else have any opinion? ”

“I didn’t.”

“I don’t have any, either.”

…

Since Kratos had volunteered, the others had nothing to say.

“Very good. Then it’s decided. Kratos will lead the mystical realm this time, and Rawls and Herman will assist him,” Said Marcus.

“Meeting dismissed!”

The meeting ended and everyone left.
