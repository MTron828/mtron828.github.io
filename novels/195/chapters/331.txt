332 Vivika’s Death

Very quickly, Udo began to tell Eli his story.

According to what he said.

When he left that year, the first city he took the airship to was Holmes city, which was the closest city to the West Coast after crossing the Roya mountains.

Udo was temporarily staying there.

At this point, Udo said with some nostalgia, “At that time, I was living in Holmes city. Coincidentally, my neighbor was a beautiful girl named Tasha. She had long golden hair and blue eyes. It was funny, but I fell in love with her.

“I told her the story of the West Coast, and she told me her story. Everything was perfect and harmonious. I even planned to live there.”

Eli drank his tea and listened to the story. Up until now, the story was still quite beautiful.

“But… ” Udo said. “one day, two second-circle soul Masters came to us and said that Tasha was a wanted criminal. I didn’t believe them, so I beat them back!

“Then I asked Tasha, and she told me that she was a direct descendant of a bloodline family. Her bloodline was strong, but she was injured, so she couldn’t make any progress after becoming a first-circle Warlock. They planned to marry her to a genius from the family branch, but she didn’t want to, so she came here.

“After that, I asked her what she was going to do. She said that she only wanted to be with me, and I naturally believed her, so I ran away with her!”

Here, Eli could already vaguely tell that something was wrong.

“Excuse me. How long have you known each other? ” Eli asked.

“Hehe, one month!” Udo said bitterly.

Eli was speechless. ‘Fine, I’ll continue listening to him.’

“After that, after a certain period of time, there would be people who would catch up to us and want to capture Tasha. But my Lord, you also know that my strength is not bad, and I easily repelled those people.”

Before Udo left, he was a late-stage third-circle warlock. This level of strength wasn’t low even in the central continent.

“It went very smoothly. Our plan at the time was to leave the Western regions and head to the central regions. In just five years, we passed through that place and then secretly went to the border of the Western regions!

“After that, the tragedy happened.

“I trusted Tasha too much at that time and almost didn’t hold anything back. The second day after I was about to cross there, I was knocked out. She left with all my resources. While I was unconscious, I was caught by the people who were chasing us.”

The corners of Eli’s mouth twitched. This story was so f * cking melodramatic.

He could even imagine what would happen next. He would find out the truth about Tasha, and then he would be exiled or imprisoned.

As expected, a few seconds later, Udo spoke, “After I was captured, I found out that Tasha was a Warlock of an evil organization. She had assassinated many warlocks in the Western Region, so she was hunted down. I also became a wanted criminal because I protected her. I was pulled to a place to kill the invading foreign creatures!”

Eli, “…” ‘Udo used to be so smart in the past.’

“What happened after that?” Eli asked.

“After that, I stayed there for a full 120 years. I was caught in a place called the abyss, where there were some creatures underground trying to invade the world.

“Due to the unique environment there, after a hundred and twenty years, I degenerated to the level of a second circle warlock, and my face became like this.” Udo laughed bitterly.

“After that, there was an accident, and I ran out of there. But in my heart, I still decided to find Tasha.”

“Why?” At this moment, Eli couldn’t help but ask.

“Because I love her! My Lord, I know this is laughable, but this is the reason!”

‘You’re amazing!’

Eli gave Udo a big thumbs up.

“Did you find her?”

“No, but I found her daughter. She’s also my daughter. She told me she was pregnant on the way to the central continent. I didn’t believe her after everything that had happened. I didn’t expect it to be true,” said Udo, raising his head.

“According to my daughter, Tasha gave birth to her in the first year of her journey to the central region. Tasha was being hunted by their organization at that time. She drugged me so that I wouldn’t be involved.”

This reversal.

Although it was melodramatic, it was also reasonable. Otherwise, it would be difficult to explain why the woman had chosen to knock him unconscious instead of killing him.

“My Lord, it’s hard to imagine how I felt when I found out about this. In a fit of anger, I found several branches of that evil organization and destroyed them.”

“So, were you hunted down again?” Eli asked strangely.

“Your Excellency, you really guessed it!” Udo was also a little embarrassed.

“I was indeed being hunted down again. In the process, I was separated from my daughter. About ten years later, I was almost killed in one of the hunts, but I still managed to escape. However, I fell into the first circle. After that, they did not continue to hunt me down. I went around in circles for a few decades. After seeing my daughter for the last time, I finally returned.” Udo calmly finished the last part of the story.

“Didn’t your daughter come back with you?” Eli asked.

“No! She has her own life. I have no right to interfere. Besides, she’s very talented, much stronger than me!”

After listening to the story, Eli also sighed.

“There’s one more thing that you might be interested in!” Suddenly, Udo raised his head and said.

“Oh?” Eli looked at him.

“It’s about Vivika.”

“What about her?” Eli’s eyes narrowed slightly.

“Vivika is dead!” A few seconds later, Udo spoke word by word.

“What?” Eli stood up and shouted in surprise.

Vivika is dead?!

“yes, in the last few decades, I went to the bloodline tower. I wanted to see Vivika, but then I found out that she had died. It was said that she died in a fight for advancement resources.” Udo raised his head and observed Eli’s expression.

‘Such a big reaction. It seemed that His Excellency was still more concerned about Vivika.’

But what surprised him was that a few seconds later, Eli regained his calm and only sighed. “her talent isn’t good enough, so it’s very difficult for her to advance. Naturally, she has to fight for it. This is probably her fate.”

“Isn’t my Lord sad?” Udo didn’t understand.

...

As far as he knew, Vivika was probably one of the few closest people to Eli.

“What’s there to be sad about?” Eli glanced at him. “Vivika’s life was almost at its end, so it was normal for her to die at this time. I’m so happy for her!”

“Happy?” Udo was confused. What was there to be happy about?

“Yeah!”

Eli stood up, walked to the window, and looked outside.

He looked into the distance as if he could see through space and sighed, “Vivika was a smart child. She might have realized that her talent couldn’t be advanced anymore.

“That was why she chose another path, to reset and start all over again.”

Eli closed his eyes, and it was only then that he realized that the soul imprint he had once upon a time had shattered, but the soul runes that had been imprinted in Vivika’s soul were still there.

Vivika didn’t die.

She had succeeded!

“Another path?” On the other side, Udo was also confused by the words, unable to understand what Eli was saying at all!

...

“Let’s not talk about this anymore. Tell me, what do you plan to do next?” Eli turned to look at Udo.

“My Lord, you should be able to tell that I don’t have much time left. I just want to come back and spend my last days here,” said Udo.

“Yes.” Eli nodded.

At this moment, Udo’s appearance was weak, but his insides were even weaker. His life force was like a candle that was about to burn out.

“There’s one more thing I need Sir’s help with. Can I?” Udo said again.

“Speak!”

“I know that you will definitely go to the central continent in the future. If you meet my daughter, can you take care of her a little? Her name is Miya.” Udo said expectantly.

“Oh?” A smile appeared on the corner of Eli’s mouth. “I’m indeed going to the central continent, but how can you be so sure? if I really meet her, I can protect her. Who knows, she might have already surpassed me by then!”

“I believe in you, my Lord!”

Udo didn’t say much, only firmly believing.

“Alright, if I have the ability.” Eli nodded.

If he really did encounter her, and it wasn’t dangerous, it wouldn’t be a big deal to help.

Of course, the prerequisite was that she was still alive when he went.

“Alright, then I’ll take my leave.” Udo stood up and bid farewell to Eli.

“Goodbye!”

After seeing udo off, Vivika and udo left on a boat.

..

A week later.

Eli received Aisha’s message.

“Udo is dead!”

Looking at the message, Eli was silent for a few seconds before he replied, “Bury him in the cemetery of the Holy tower. He should like it.”

Soon, udo was buried in the cemetery of the holy tower. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

That day, Eli went to take a look and returned.

A traveler’s return!

The latter half of his life was tragic yet blissful. At least he had found someone he loved. Although it was only five years, it was not bad. The only problem was that he did not have enough strength.

If he was a celestial, there was a high chance that there wouldn’t be so many pursuers.

Therefore, strength was the king.

Moreover, just from Udo’s description, this central continent was quite dangerous. There were evil organizations, the invasion of the underground abyss, and there were even people being hunted down. Udo’s tragedy was not completely unrelated to the environment.

So, Eli decided to hang in there and wait until he was strong enough before heading to the central continent.

Safety first.
