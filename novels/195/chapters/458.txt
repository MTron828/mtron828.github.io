459 Sixty Years

New Calendar Year 4683!

Thank you readers!

The Abyss was in chaos, and a large number of demons broke out of the seal. The City of Dawn suffered countless casualties. It took three days for the Heart of the Chaos Abyss to successfully suppress the demons!

Eli received the news on the same day, and when he saw the news, he became vigilant!

The Abyss Seal was an important reason for ensuring that a large number of demons in the Abyss could not come out in full force. It was also a super large spell formation left behind by the Mages when they left. It could repair itself and absorb energy from the dead demon bloodline and nature to maintain itself.

There had been no problems for thousands of years, but this year, there was a problem.

Both the Western Regions and other places were paying close attention. Fortunately, the matter was resolved smoothly in the end, allowing everyone to breathe a sigh of relief.

However, Eli did not care about this. He noticed that all the Warlocks from the other forces had died in the City of Dawn. It did not seem like a big deal, but Eli thought of something else. Perhaps they wanted to do something else when they were not being monitored!

Of course, this was just a guess, but Eli was still on high alert.

Of course, he was no longer as nervous as before. His celestial power had accumulated to 285 units.

The possibility of defeating Nero was already 9 points, while Tuman had even reached 18 points.

However, if he was near the City of Bloodline, he could even use the power of faith to the greatest extent, which would further increase his strength. Even if he could not defeat Nero, the possibility of him dying on the spot would be greatly reduced!

Of course, this was only Eli’s guess, and it was impossible to predict the future with a hundred percent certainty.

Therefore, Eli’s choice was to spread the news through the Charm Mansion, some things about the Heart of the Abyss!

A month later!

The Heart of the Abyss!

“Damn it!” Nero smashed the table into powder with a punch, and his eyes turned red.

Tuman, who was also not far from his room, did not say a word, but he gritted his teeth.

” My lord, we don’t know anything about the purpose of the Charm Mansion. However, many factions have already arrived at the Heart of the Abyss to verify this matter. I’ve already called back everyone and canceled our original plan.” After more than ten seconds, Tuman looked up at Nero and suppressed his anger!

Hearing this, Nero also sighed and felt powerless!

“Tuman, who do you think did this?” Suddenly, Nero looked at Tuman!

Tuman was also very straightforward. ” I have several suspects. First of all, the forces in the central region. They have always wanted us to join the Warlock Council. Perhaps they are slandering us. Second, it might be some of our previous mistakes. Finally, there is the Bloodline Tower’s Eli. Although the Eight-Armed Naga was cleaned up, there are indeed traces left behind.”

“Yes, sir!” Tuman nodded and left the house.

After he left, Tuman heard the sound of things being smashed again!

Eli’s silver eye was watching everything. Eli didn’t grab any more valuable info, but this was enough. This could at least keep everything stable for decades!

“Patience!”

Eli happily returned to the Tower!

….

Time was merciless, even for Eli!

Twenty-two years later!

When Eli sensed 300 celestial power units, he knew that he had finally entered a new stage.

” Peak fourth circle! ”

Eli took a deep breath and felt extremely carefree.

At this moment, his chances of defeating Tuman had increased to 20 points. Even Nero had reached 13 points.

Although he had not officially reached the seed stage, he had already reached the seed stage’s power level. After all, he had been advancing both his power as a mage and a warlock.

In these 22 years, many things have happened.

One of the times, a crack in the abyss opened in the west of the Western Region, in an uninhabited area. Fortunately, it was discovered and sealed by Eli in time.

After this incident, the various factions began to have a lot of opinions about the Heart of the Abyss. This was because there had been no problems with the Heart of the Abyss for the past few hundred years. However, in just 70 years, three major incidents had occurred. This had caused many factions to point fingers at the Heart of the Abyss!

The Heart of Abyss was also very depressed and confused. However, what they did not know was that all this negative news was actually arranged by Eli in secret.

Of course, Eli knew that he would be discovered sooner or later, but he had to face the enemy sooner or later, so there was nothing much to say.

At this moment, he had the strength, so he was not afraid at all!

Of course, there were two other important reasons. One was related to the Law of Shadow. Although he still hadn’t gotten rid of the black fog, the sixty years of direct experience had given him a deeper understanding of the Law of Shadow. He could even feel an indescribable feeling in the celestial Great Sun!

As long as he continued to observe and comprehend, he would advance to half-step fifth circle sooner or later. Of course, it might take some time!

Even so, his Shadow Sorcery had received a slight improvement, and it was slightly different from an ordinary peak Radiant Sun.

There was also the second one, which was that the analysis of the celestial Body and the Bloodline avatar had long reached 100%.

The experiment had entered the final stage, which was to find the final balance point, or rather, the transformation point, and find the commonality between the two. Eli had spent about ten hours a day on this, and it had been going on for ten years!

It was difficult, but Eli had already seen the light.

At this time, experiments were done on Ortiz every day. He was a little busy, but he was being studied.

Over the past 60 years, Eli has invested nearly 100 million into this experiment. Every year, a large amount of money was invested. About 30% of the Bloodline Tower’s wealth had been spent on this experiment. There were more than 10,000 people participating in this experiment.

Although he had yet to succeed, he already felt hope for the future.

“But I’m afraid there’s not much time left. The Heart of the Abyss is investigating very closely. I’m afraid something has already happened.”

Eli took a deep breath, walked to the window of the wizard tower, and looked outside.

Outside the window, the greenery was green and extremely pleasing to the eye. In the corner, Hydra, who had advanced to Radiant Sun ten years ago, was stretching its body. Not far away, Nikola, who had also advanced to Radiant Sun, was studying his soul magic. Further away, Dylan and Hill were both peak third circle.

Although Dylan had been given a lot of resources by Ely, Ely was not very knowledgeable about machine life. Although he had paid a lot of resources, he had not successfully advanced. Hill, on the other hand, was too big and did not meet the requirements to advance.

Over the years, although Dylan hadn’t advanced, Eli had still been able to take him to various regions of the Western Regions with his power. However, he still hadn’t found anything. Of course, it wasn’t Eli’s fault. It was limited to the north and east. The south was the area of the Heart of the Abyss, so there was nothing he could do.

So if nothing went wrong, Eli guessed that the clue to Dylan’s true body was in the Heart of the Abyss!

“The Heart of the Abyss. Why does it seem like everything is connected to them? The clues to the Gray Tower, the stable environment, everything.

“Why must it be like this? I just want to slowly grow stronger and develop in peace. Why are there always people or factions stopping me?”

Eli was slightly moved, but he wasn’t as nervous as he was before because he had many more trump cards than he had 60 years ago.

Other than what was on the surface, there were also war magic tools that were stored for dozens of wars, magic staffs that had been refined into staffs by Eli, power of faith, Greenfield’s subordinates, and dozens of fourth-circle giants that he had transformed into undead from the Mountain Giant World…

Eli had even calculated that their chances of winning against the Heart of the Abyss could reach 70 to 80 percent!

“It’s not enough. I need more protection! ” Eli didn’t relax because of this. Instead, he became more cautious!

A 70 – 80% chance of winning was no different from failure.

There was no difference!

” It’s best to break through to half-step fifth circle. Secondly, I need to find the balance point as soon as possible. However, Ortiz alone is obviously not enough. I need more dragons. Of course, the third is to find a half-step fifth-circle dragon to fight. I need to familiarize myself with this level in advance. It’s best if it’s before the war with the Heart of the Abyss!” Eli kept nagging!

However, he knew that his ideas were still very troublesome, and none of them were easy to realize.

He needed an opportunity.

Even Eli couldn’t find a suitable target, which made him even more helpless!

“Who can bestow me with a half-step fifth-circle creature?” T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Eli prayed in his heart.

Pa, pa, pa!

There was a sudden knock on the door. Eli turned his head in confusion and heard an urgent voice coming from behind the door.

“Brother Eli, something bad has happened!”

“Something big has happened!”
