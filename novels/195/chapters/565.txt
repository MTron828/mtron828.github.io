566 Identity Revealed, Crazy Advancement

The two Liches had died, and the Lich King had suddenly appeared on the battlefield!

Instantly, the atmosphere of the entire battlefield changed.

The Liches looked at the figure, and their Soul Flames flashed as if they had seen the hope of survival. The human Warlocks frowned, not expecting such a turn of events.

Of course, it was only a split second. When the Lich King spoke, the entire battlefield was ignited.

“.. Teacher Eli?”

“Long time no see!”

Teacher!

Was Eli the Lich King’s teacher?

Wasn’t this too exaggerated?

Countless Liches and Warlocks gasped in shock.

“Teacher…Are you kidding me? Is Eli the teacher of the Lich King? There must be something wrong with my ears, right?”

“How is this possible? Wasn’t Eli born on the West Coast? Could it be that David was also from the West Coast? That couldn’t be right. The time of the two didn’t seem to match, right? The two of them actually had a teacher-student relationship? A lich leader and a human leader. What happened in between?”

“Fake, it’s all fake. I don’t believe it!”

Countless Liches felt their faith crumbling at this moment.

“My lord!”

The warlocks of the fifth circle looked at Eli’s back with complicated expressions.

“Brother Eli actually had a student? How could it be the Lich King? Eh, why do I feel like I’ve seen this Lich King somewhere before?” Vivika stood rooted to the ground, her eyes wandering between Eli and the Lich King in the distance.

She felt a sense of familiarity from the Lich King.

What was going on?

..

Everyone was doubting their lives, and the Lich King had already arrived in the sky above the battlefield. He was standing directly opposite Eli, looking at Eli with a smile on his face.

Looking at the silent Eli, he smiled and said, “What’s wrong, Teacher Eli? Don’t you recognize me? I’m David!”

“No, you’re not!”

Eli shook his head and looked at David.

The moment it appeared, the Soul Imprint in Eli’s body suddenly flickered, which confirmed that the Lich in front of him was his student, David.

However, it was not he who controlled the body but another consciousness.

“Oh? Then who do you think I am?” He turned his head and asked.

“A damned thing that was born from the black mist!” Eli answered calmly.

This was his guess.

To be able to control the black mist, there was no doubt that it had a great relationship with the ruler of the black mist.

David was stunned when he heard that. Layers of black fog emanated from his body, and his body gradually grew taller. He stared at Eli and said, “Sure enough, you guessed something. Otherwise, you wouldn’t have sealed the Calamity Lich. It looks like I’ve underestimated you.

“So what are you going to do? Do you want to kill your student? That’s really cruel!”

In the next second, his figure instantly disappeared from where he was and appeared in front of Eli.

Black mist surged, and a black palm attacked Eli.

Bang!

The shadow collided with the black mist, and Eli’s body flew backward.

At the same time, more shadows surged out of his body and wrapped around David, turning him into a large cocoon, leaving only his head behind.

In an instant, Eli trapped him.

He stared at Eli and said maniacally, “Come on, kill your good disciple. He’s trying his best to prevent me from killing you with this body.”

Looking at the mad David, he frowned.

He was just making a casual guess, and he did not expect to be right.

The thing controlling David was actually something born from the black fog.

It seemed that he had to force this thing out.

Eli shook his head and put away the wizard book. However, another wizard book with chains wrapped around it slowly appeared in his hand. It was the Book of Curses that Eli had not used for a long time!

The moment he took it out, the chain slowly opened. At the same time, the soul imprint in Eli’s body slowly appeared in his hand and was directly inserted into the book.

“This is?”

In the distance,” David ” saw this scene and suddenly had a bad feeling.

But in the next second, his eyes widened.

Curses suddenly appeared in his body. Each curse was tightly wrapped around his body as if they were sticking to his bones as if they wanted to kill him.

The curses were so powerful that they wanted to kill him directly. Even if he was born in the black fog, he could not withstand them at all.

“You lunatic, you’re crazy!” He wailed as he looked at the calm Eli not far away.

He could sense that Eli was losing at least 5,000 to 6,000 years of life force to cast the curses.

Wasn’t he afraid of dying? Was it worth it for a student?

At the same time, a consciousness in his body seemed to have awakened again and launched a fierce attack on him. This almost made him go crazy, and the expression on his face became more and more ferocious and crazy. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

In the distance, Eli was watching this scene calmly.

On the ground, all the living beings were at a loss as they watched this scene. Their lord had been captured. Had their lord gone mad?

However, in the next second, they saw a black fog suddenly emerge from the Lich King’s eyes. The black fog drilled out of his body and left David’s body! David fainted, and the thing flew out.

His entire body was like a flowing black fog, but his figure was a blurry human figure. As soon as he appeared, curses appeared on his body, making him look like the most vicious existence in the world. He had no eyes, but Eli knew that he was looking at him, filled with chaotic killing intent.

“Eli, you deserve to die!”

He let out a shrieking sound as he glared at Eli with hatred.

“I knew you were not human!”

Eli’s gaze was calm as he threw the unconscious David to Vivika, who was far away.

“Take good care of him!”

A voice rang out. Vivika looked at David beside her and suddenly felt that the wonderful feeling was even more peculiar. Meanwhile, the other people had complicated expressions.

Of course, they no longer paid attention to the Lich King. The thing in the sky was obviously the culprit!

Everyone looked up at the sky.

..

“Eli, are you that confident that you can kill me?”

Enduring the curse on his body, the creature of the black fog stared at Eli.

“Oh?”

Eli remained calm. In fact, he was very confident.

He still had a killer move that he had yet to use. As for the Black Fog’s trump card, he had already guessed it. It was nothing more than using the curse to devour all the Liches.

Therefore, he gave him a look as if he wanted him to hurry up.

Sensing Eli’s emotions, he twitched.

“Alright, you forced me to do this.” He let out a furious roar. His voice was like that of a wild beast, but it felt like it was overlapping. A change was also occurring.

..

On the ground, the Liches were watching the battle.

Suddenly, a Lich let out a wail and fell to the ground in pain.

“What’s wrong with you?” The Lich was a little dumbfounded as he watched the fallen Lich.

However, in the next second, he saw Lich’s body gradually turn illusory. In the illusion, a black curse broke like a string!

“That’s… the curse?” His eyes widened as if he had understood something.

However, in the next second, a sharp pain spread through his body. He felt his strength depleting bit by bit. He looked around and realized that he was not the only one. All the Liches had fallen to the ground. Even the fourth-circle Liches who were high above were no exception!

Millions of Liches died in an instant, but the black mist in the sky grew stronger.

What immortality? It was just a trap to lure them.

The gifts given by fate had already been marked with a price.

At this moment, he suddenly understood, but it was too late.

..

Looking at the dead Liches on the ground and the trembling sealed Liches in the ring, Eli raised his head and looked at the Black Fog, whose aura was increasing.

One circle.

Second circle.

..

Five circle.

Germinal, Divine Tree, Thousand Leaves, Thousand Flowers, Laws.

In the blink of an eye, the black fog’s aura had risen from a mass of void level to the peak of the laws.

“I see!”

Eli understood.

“Immortality? A bunch of fools still thought that such a simple ritual could grant them eternal life. It was just an illusion I brought upon them by using the laws.” The black mist turned into a human figure and looked at Eli.

“Indeed!”

Eli agreed with this. There were no benefits for no reason.

“So, are you ready to die?” Eli looked at the black shadow with a smile.

The black shadow was speechless.
