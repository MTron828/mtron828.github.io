185 Mages

A month later.

At the exit of the mountain range, a man in ragged clothes walked out.

His clothes were torn, and he was heavily injured. His clothes were stained with blood, and his face was pale.

“What the hell is going on?!”

Simon’s voice trembled as he recalled what had happened in the past month.

On the first day.

He encountered an elemental storm and fell into the mountains.

On the third day.

He encountered a group of second-circle demonic wolves, and after a fierce battle, he left.

On the sixth day.

He accidentally fell into an underground cave and faced a third-circle human-faced Demon Spider. If it weren’t for the demon Spider not leaving the cave, his bones would have rotted away by now.

On the ninth day.

When he encountered the wizard camp, it was a group of bloody warlocks. He had to use his life-saving means to survive and escape with difficulty.

On the twelfth day.

..

On the twenty-seventh day.

..

Every three days, he would be unlucky, and as the days dragged on, the stronger the enemies he would encounter. If he weren’t really strong, he would have died here.

But fortunately, he had finally come out of the mountain range today.

“There should be nothing else after this, right?” Simon took a deep breath.

“Eh, why is the sky so dark?” Simon suddenly felt that his vision was a little dark. He thought that the sky had darkened, but then a drop of water the size of a bucket fell in front of him.

“It’s raining!” Simon was stunned. It didn’t seem like it.

Simon’s body instantly froze, and his throat moved slightly. He slowly raised his head and saw a third-circle Mountain Giant staring at him like a piece of fatty meat.

Simon’s face turned even paler.

Meanwhile, the mountain giant’s attack had already arrived. Its huge hand grabbed Simon, and the already exhausted Simon had no way to dodge it. He could only watch as he entered the giant’s mouth.

Simon closed his eyes.

In the next second, the sound of flesh being chewed up could be heard. The mountain Giant pursed its lips and then strode into the mountains. It was originally going out to hunt today, but it got lost and ended up here. It actually had an unexpected harvest.

What a lucky day.

..

“Is he dead?”

The moment Simon died, Eli smiled as he watched his hair turn gray in front of him.

As expected of a Peak second-circle magic caster from a major force, he was still alive so many times after being cursed. It seemed that warlocks of the same level were not easy to be cursed to death.

“He was already very powerful to survive until today,” Eli shook his head.

However, it could also be related to the curse he used. Generally, it would not directly affect the target itself, and it was achieved externally. The disadvantage was that the power would be greatly reduced, but the advantage was that it would not be discovered.

Did he really think that he could leave easily after destroying Eli’s peaceful life? Moreover, he died outside, so what did it have to do with the White Tower? No one would do anything about this.

A month had passed, and the White Tower had completely taken over Blood Alliance’s forces. The White Tower’s scale expanded rapidly, and it became one of the larger forces in the South of the West Coast.

The only regret was that the higher-ups of the White Tower were not very strong at the moment. This could not be helped as they needed time to recover. Fortunately, they were relatively remote and would not have any conflicts with the major forces in the short term. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Of course, there were also many forces that were shocked that White Tower had swallowed up the Blood Alliance, and they did not dare to act rashly.

The White Tower was the most powerful force in the South, and there were seven or eight more powerful forces in the north. They were stronger than the White Tower in terms of scale and power, including the Lilith Warlock Academy, the storm Griffin Warlock, the cross blade Warlock camp, and the violet Warlock Academy.

But fortunately, there were no three-circle warlocks.

Further north was the black Isotta, the bloodline tower, and the other major factions in the central region. These factions had third-circle warlocks, and Eli’s student, Vivika, was in the bloodline tower.

This was also why the other day when Eli heard Simon mention the bloodline tower, his eyes lit up. However, now was not the time to meet, mainly because it was too far away.

At the same time, Eli felt a sense of urgency.

At this moment, his combat power could be said to be almost invincible among the peak of second-circle, especially with the support of his Shadow Dragon bloodline.

However, if Eli had to face five to six peak two-circle warlocks at the same time, even if it was Eli, the chances of him winning were not high. Hence, he could not afford to be reckless now. He had to become stronger.

He didn’t know how to break through as a Warlock, but he knew how to do that for mages. Now that he had the tilted tower to train his power of the will, what he needed to do was to increase it.

This required the help of the blood bamboo flower potion. However, the blood bamboo flowers in the second-circle were only average at the moment. However, the difficulty of nurturing them to the third-circle was on a completely different level than nurturing them to the second-circle. Hence, Eli was very annoyed.

He needed a more efficient way to increase his mental power.

This would depend on the mage camp’s efforts. As he became stronger as the mage, he also felt the limitation of the land. His lifespan was exhausted twice as fast as before, which was ridiculous.

He was curious why the mage’s world had become like this.

Fortunately, he was immortal, so he didn’t have to worry about this. If not for this, he wouldn’t have been able to collect so many ” useless ” mage resources from here.

Therefore, he would once again enter the stage of silent development.

..

Just as Eli was thinking …

...

In a tower of the black Isotta Warlock Academy in the middle of the West Coast.

A man looked at the message and thought, “White Tower won? Unfortunate. We’ll have to wait. The competition with the bloodline tower is at a critical moment. We’ll deal with them later. Plus, they’re still far away from us.

“However, who would have thought that Simon would die in the mountains? This is very suspicious. I don’t think White Tower is behind this. They wouldn’t have the guts, so it couldn’t be the other forces, right?

“Forget it. I’ll just ignore it.”

The man shook his head. As a third-circle warlock, he didn’t need to spend too much effort on the death of a second-circle warlock.

The only thing he had to pay attention to was that the leader of the White Tower seemed to be very powerful.

“But Simon didn’t tell me his name. He must be the chairman, Kratos.” The man remembered the name.

..

Twenty years later.

After a day of meditation, Eli opened his eyes.

He felt the mental energy in his body.

...

His mental power was about 120 points. It was 100 points when he started, so it increased by about 20 points, but it was all in a vaporized state. This was the result of his using a lot of resources.

According to this calculation, he would need at least 100 years to advance to the liquid stage. After that, he didn’t know when he would advance to the crystallization stage.

The advancement of a second-circle Mage was different from that of a Warlock. When their mental force reached 200 points (vapour), the mental force would be compressed and then liquified. Although the liquification would compress the mental force and increase the quality, the quantity would also be greatly reduced, dropping it back down to 100 points. The mage had to raise his mental points again to 200 points and undergo another round of liquification before the mental power could be crystallized.

“This is too slow!” Eli shook his head and strode out of the secret realm.

He stood on top of the wizard Tower and looked at the bustling White Tower.

Compared to 20 years ago, the current White Tower was much more powerful in terms of scale and influence. Of course, it was still in a state of development.

With the rapid supply of a large number of resources, the White Tower also re-cultivated several second-circle warlocks, allowing it to gain a slightly stable foothold. Eli had also silently benefited from it.

This was a flourishing force.

There was also the mage camp, which was constantly developing. Every day, there were thousands of people working hard for the second seal of the devouring spell. Three years ago, the seal had finally begun to take shape.

Three years had passed, and the seal had become clearer and clearer.

Just yesterday, he received news from Tijie.

The seal seemed to have succeeded.

Eli was also preparing to leave the White Tower and go to the mage camp to take a look.
