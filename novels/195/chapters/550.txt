Weng!

The clouds parted like waves, and the boundless blood color scattered like thick ink.

In the sky, hundreds of ” meteors ” passed through the clouds and entered the Warlock World, heading in the direction of the Bloodline City. They set off endless elemental waves, and the terrifying phenomenon instantly attracted the entire continent.

Southern Region!

Sea Shark and the Sea Dragon Clan’s head raised their glasses to celebrate. The location was no longer the hidden Mage Tower but the city of the Sea Dragon Clan. At this time, both clans belonged to the Bloodline Tower, so there was naturally no boundary!

“Brother, this is good. Ever since the establishment of the Bloodline Alliance, there has been little exploitation in the continent. Moreover, the Bloodline Alliance is different from the Warlock Alliance!” the Sea Dragon clan said leisurely.

“Yes!” Patriarch Sea Shark nodded in agreement.

Without a doubt, they had made the right bet.

“It’s just a pity that there’s still the Lich Tower…” The head of the Sea Dragon Clan shook his head. However, in the next second, he felt that the color of the sky seemed to have changed. He raised his head and looked outside.

His mouth gradually opened wide.

“What’s wrong?” The head of the Sea Shark Family was confused. He followed his gaze.

Gulp!

His throat moved slightly, and his body gradually stiffened.

“A hundred fifth circle warlocks? How is that possible?” His voice trembled, and the fear in his eyes gradually dissipated.

In the sky, the hundreds of figures were all fifth circle, especially the auras in front of them. None of them were weaker than Thousand Leaves. He could even vaguely sense an even stronger aura.

Thousand Flowers?

But how was this possible? Where did these guys come from?

“I’m afraid we’re in big trouble.” The head of the Sea Dragon Clan stared at the figure in the sky.

Since the establishment of the Bloodline Alliance, due to the great war, the number of fifth circle warlocks was even fewer than the Warlock Alliance. There were only about twenty people, but there were more than a hundred fifth circle warlocks in the sky.

Moreover, he noticed that there seemed to be many old men among them. They were all old monsters who had never appeared in the world. He even saw members of the five great families.

“I’m afraid their target is the lord. We’re in big trouble.” He looked at the person beside him with fear in his eyes.

Their eyes met!

In the next second, two figures flew out of the tower and flew into the distant sky.

Their lord needed them! 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Eastern Region.

The head of Wind God flew out of the sky bitterly, but his expression collapsed.

“A hundred fifth circle warlock? How is that possible?

“How can we resist? The alliance that was just formed is about to end just like that?

“I hate it!”

He had no confidence in the Bloodline Alliance because he knew how powerful the Bloodline Alliance was.

Even with the unknown strength of Eli, he didn’t think he could win. After all, if you could fight a dozen people, could you fight fifty or sixty people? He did not believe it.

However, he still had to provide support, but he felt that he would probably die this time!

The good days had just begun!

Damn it!

The Central Region!

In a hidden valley, a large number of Warlocks were gathered. The surroundings were filled with various materials, and in the middle sat an old man with a peak four-ringed aura.

He was the former president of the Golden Cicada Merchant Association, Jin Ji’s former superior.

However, compared to the past, he was much more down and out now.

“After the establishment of the Bloodline Alliance, we lost our biggest reliance. The Golden Cicada Merchant Association suffered a devastating blow in the blink of an eye, while Jin Ji rose rapidly in the Bloodline Tower and stepped into the fifth circle.” Thinking about the past, he almost vomited blood.

The Warlock Alliance, which had been established for thousands of years, was gone just like that!

Who would have thought?

“This is all because of Eli!” His eyes were filled with hatred. He dug his nails into his thigh, causing blood to flow out, but he ignored it.

He hated it!

Suddenly, he raised his head and looked at the sky.

A few seconds later, his eyes flashed, and he stood up like a madman.

“Hahaha, how did these old guys get together? Is their goal the Bloodline Tower? Hahahaha, Eli, you’re dead!”

He had seen many of those figures in the sky. Many of them were old fellows who had been sleeping for thousands of years. They were afraid of losing their lives and never came out!

To be honest, the special curse of the warlock world was also effective in the vicinity. Unless one completely left the warlock world, the effect of the curse could not be eliminated. Therefore, even if one were in a world fragment, they would still be affected, but it would be weakened!

“Hehe, Eli and Jin Ji, you’re dead meat.”

His face was ferocious and terrifying, and the calmness he had when he was the guild leader was completely gone.

Perhaps this was his original appearance!

..

Northern Region!

In Cold Wind Castle!

Many Liches sat on chairs, and a screen in front of them displayed the scene of the warlocks entering the Warlocks World.

“Bone Dragon, great work! It seems like the Bloodline Tower is going to be destroyed this time. I didn’t expect there to be so many old fellows left in the outside world.” A Lich sighed as he looked ahead.

The bone dragon looked at him and said, “Indeed, this is beyond my imagination. However, this is also a good opportunity. This battle is bound to consume a considerable amount of combat power from both sides. It will reduce some obstacles in our future battles.”

The Lich of Calamity did not reply. He only looked at the figure in front of the light screen. It was an old man who was all skin and bones, like a dried corpse.

However, he did not belittle him. Instead, he became more cautious and said, “But who would have thought that there would be a hidden Thousand Flower Warlock in those world fragments? He’s almost at the middle stage.”

“Yeah, but he doesn’t have much lifespan left. At most, he’ll have five years. No wonder he came out.” The Bone Dragon Lich was a little disdainful.

“Eli is dead!”

As he spoke, the Liches present all smiled.

“Sir, what do you think?” At this moment, the Lich looked up at the figure at the front. It was the Lich King who had not said a word since the beginning.

The Lich King did not answer. He only looked at the screen, his soul fire slightly rippling.

‘Why do I feel a little lost? Could it be that this person called Eli was really related to me in the past? I really can’t remember!

‘Damn it!’

The transformation of a Lich would cause one’s will to gradually fall into darkness, and one would gradually lose their memories. Even he could not remember his past!

He only knew that the world should not be like this!

Why did he change?

Was it when he was once a mage who had to struggle to survive and was hunted down by the warlocks?

He was very confused!

Why did he do that?

Everyone could feel the drastic change in the Lich King’s mood, so they didn’t think too much about it. They only thought that their lord was happy about the upcoming future.

Everyone ignored him and focused their attention on the screen!

At this moment, many Warlocks had already entered the Warlock’s World.
