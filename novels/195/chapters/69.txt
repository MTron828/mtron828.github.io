70 Ruins

That night, Eli and the others were left in the palace. Scholar Clement was a little emotional. This was his first time meeting the Queen of a country. On the other hand, Eli was full of anticipation for the excavation tomorrow.

It had to be said that the Queen was indeed very beautiful. Although she was in her thirties, she looked like she was in her twenties due to the physical fitness of a Grand Knight. She also had a kind of Majesty that ordinary people did not have.

However, compared to the Queen, Eli was more concerned about Saleen Metatrin’s student.

“I hope Weiss’ inheritance is still there!”

This was the most important reason why Eli was so attentive this time.

He didn’t want to waste his time.

...

At the same time, in the palace.

Back in the main hall, Queen Cynthia sat alone on her throne, seemingly in deep thought.

Suddenly, a cloak was placed over the Queen’s shoulders.

“It’s getting a little cold now.” the female knight stood beside queen Cynthia, her eyes fixed on the queen as she spoke in a low voice.

“Ever since I became a Grand Knight more than ten years ago, this wind is no longer cold enough to make me feel cold.” Queen Cynthia said calmly as she looked ahead.

“Maybe, but this is a force of habit. When we were teenagers, we were carefree. Our favorite thing was to run to the top of the hall at night to look at the stars. We would wear cloaks, or it would be very cold!” the female knight said with a smile.

“Yes, but we can’t go back to how we were before. In the face of time, everyone is equal.” Queen Cynthia sighed.

“Don’t put too much pressure on yourself. Relax a little.” The female knight placed her hand on the Queen’s shoulder and said.

“Yes, but not now. I heard that Bryne the sixth is dying. Many countries have been in turmoil recently. We need more power to maintain the hard-won peace.” Queen Cynthia said as she looked at the empty Hall before her.

“Alright, I will always be by your side!” The female knight also looked forward.

The female knight was the Empire’s general and was in charge of managing the Kingdom’s Army. She was also Queen Cynthia’s absolute supporter. The two of them had always managed to keep the kingdom in good order.

They were the core of this country.

...

In the blink of an eye, it was the next day.

Eli and the others were led out of the palace early on. They were assigned to their warhorses and were prepared to follow the soldiers to the place where the ruins were buried. They were in charge of observing the ruins.

As for scholar Clement, he wasn’t there, mainly because he wasn’t young anymore and couldn’t ride a horse.

But what Eli didn’t expect was that when he and the others arrived, someone was already waiting.

Queen Cynthia was dressed in silver-white armor with a sword hanging from her waist. A crimson cape was draped over her back, and she was riding on a magic horse. Every breath she took would release a pillar of air. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“You guys follow me. We’ll set off immediately. We should be there in half a day.” Queen Cynthia straightened her body and looked at everyone with a calm gaze.

Eli was surprised. He didn’t expect the queen to come out personally. He immediately followed her, and the others followed closely behind.

Just like that, the Queen rode her horse at the very front, while Eli and the others followed behind on both sides. Then, there were a large number of cavalrymen and soldiers around them, and the group quickly advanced toward their target.

Along the way, the Queen didn’t say a word, and no one around her said a word.

Because the Queen was going to travel personally, the road ahead had been cleared. Along the way, many big trees could be seen being cut down, as well as mountain rocks that had been moved away.

Four hours later, they arrived at their destination.

This was the foot of a huge mountain range, and there were many green-black rocks that were like chasms. A large number of rocks were piled together, like a small mountain.

In addition to these, hundreds of people had been summoned here in advance. They had completely occupied the surroundings and were ready to clean up everything in front of them at any time.

“Is this the place we found?” Vera looked at the scene in front of her and exclaimed.

” Yes, ” Eli replied softly as he looked at the mountain range in front of him.

According to the records from a hundred years ago, this place should be a small plain. However, it was now a corner of a small mountain range. It could only be said that the changes caused by the earthquake were much greater than what Eli had imagined. It was no wonder that this place had not been discovered by anyone for decades.

“Eli, we’ve confirmed that there’s something underground here. Do you have any suggestions? ” at this moment, the queen spoke, tilting her head slightly and looking at eli.

“Your Majesty, your people must have already observed everything. I’d better not show off in front of an expert! ” Eli replied.

“Yes.” Queen Cynthia nodded. She really liked this young man, Eli. He had a good sense of self-awareness and was also very good-looking.

“Let’s begin!” Queen Cynthia shouted at the knights and soldiers not far away.

“Everything is for the Queen!” A deafening sound was heard.

Everyone took out the tools that had been sent here in advance and began to dig.

The scene of hundreds of people working at the same time was spectacular. Eli saw that the hill in front of him had instantly shortened by a layer. When the soldiers dug up the soil, if they encountered a stone, the Knights would smash it directly, and then the soldiers would transport the pieces of rocks not far away.

“How are the soldiers of the Lorraine Kingdom compared to Bryne?” Queen Cynthia asked Eli again.

“Very energetic. I can feel that they even worship Her Majesty in their hearts. Her Majesty is their faith!” Eli replied respectfully. He could truly feel the soldiers’ support for the Queen.

“What a novel answer!” Queen Cynthia’s brows twitched as she revealed a smile that resembled a blooming flower.

She had asked many people this question. Some talked about the combat power of the army, some talked about the quality of the soldiers, and some talked about their cohesion. Eli was the first to talk about faith.

“I investigated you yesterday and suddenly felt that Bryne has really buried your talent. Why don’t you come to the Lorraine Kingdom? We are in need of talents like you.” Queen Cynthia invited again.

She really did think that Eli was a very talented person.

She had sent someone to inquire yesterday, and only then did she find out that Eli wasn’t even a scholar, but only Clement’s student, and he was just an ordinary librarian. This shocked her greatly.

Initially, he thought that Eli was a genius scholar from the Bryne Empire, but it did not seem like that was the case. However, judging from the talent displayed in the ruins of the Empire, he was definitely a rare talent.

This could only mean that eli didn’t care about fame and fortune at all, which made her like him even more, and she wanted to take him under her wing.

“I’m sorry, Your Majesty. I still prefer the days in the library.” Eli had his own thoughts.

If he were to really come here, he would receive a lot of attention, which would make him feel terrible. Furthermore, he had not finished investigating Saleen Metatrin, the king of the Bryne Empire, so how could he leave?

“Alright, I’ll say the same thing. The door of the Lorraine Kingdom is always open for you.” The Queen nodded, indicating that she understood.

She knew that he couldn’t persuade Eli. He was definitely not an ordinary young man.

“It’s been dug open!” At the same time, not far away, the ground suddenly caved in, revealing a large hole. The soldiers at the side shouted excitedly.

Queen Cynthia’s eyes lit up as she rode over on her horse.

“How timely!”

Looking at the leaving Queen, Eli also relaxed a little. If the Queen really invited him again, he really wouldn’t know what to do.

But now that they had found the ruins, the next step was to check whether Weiss’ inheritance was still there.
