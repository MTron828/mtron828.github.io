543 The Current Situation of the Gray Mage Tower

Crack!

When Eli placed the silver key on the wall, the wall immediately rippled like water.

“Sir, we’re almost inside!” Dylan’s eyes were filled with enthusiasm.

“Yes.”

Eli nodded and took a step back. A clone was formed.

After the clone was formed, he slowly opened his eyes and said to Dylan, “Let’s go in and take a look.”

“Yes, sir.” Dylan completely understood what Eli was doing. After all, he had been with Eli for so many years.

Whoosh!

Walking into the rippling wall, a spatial fluctuation enveloped them.

“Sir, the interior of the Mage Tower has merged into a large space. This is the normal spatial fluctuation when entering!” Dylan said as he sensed the familiar fluctuations.

Upon hearing that, Eli nodded.

Three seconds later!

They had already appeared in another area.

“This is?” Eli looked up.

In front of him was a huge space that covered an area of more than a thousand acres. There were countless complicated circuits on the walls, and there were control panels on the ground. At the center was a protruding control panel.

Was this the core control area of the Gray Mage Tower?

Really… Ordinary!

Eli pursed his lips, but he did not dare to underestimate this place.

“Sir, here!” At this moment, Dylan, who was far away, had already run to the highest control panel and waved for him to go over.

Eli walked over and found a keyhole on the side of the console. It matched the key he was holding.

“Sir, as long as you insert the key in and operate it, you will be able to obtain the final authority!” Dylan added.

In the next second, Eli inserted the key into it.

Crack!

As the key was inserted, Eli instantly felt the ground begin to tremble. The screens in front of him also began to flash, like ancient black and white screens. In the middle of the screens, a human Mage Spirit wearing a black suit slowly walked out.

“Sula, long time no see!” Dylan shouted happily.

“Oh, Dylan?” Sula looked at Dylan with a hint of surprise, then turned to look at Eli. His eyes were filled with doubt, but when he saw the key, his eyes suddenly lit up.

“This is Lord Eli…” Dylan quickly introduced them.

Soon, Dylan introduced them to each other.

Eli also understood that Sula was the original chief spirit of the Mage Tower. He was like a butler and had the ability to mobilize most of the power of the Mage Tower.

Sula also understood the current state of the world, as well as the things about Eli and Dylan.

“The world is unpredictable. Who would have thought that the great Mage World would become like this?” Sula sighed and looked at Eli. “In that case, I will hand over the authority of the remaining Mage Towers to you.”

“Alright!” Eli nodded, understanding the most crucial step.

As a series of data floated up from Sula’s body, Eli received it all!

An hour later.

Eli opened his eyes, but he looked at Sula with a complicated expression.

“Is the situation in the Magus Tower really that bad?” he asked.

“This tower has been ownerless for so long. But now that the lord is here, I believe that he will be able to deal with the problem.” Sula seemed to understand what he was saying and sighed.

Sigh!

“This is terrible!” The corner of Eli’s mouth twitched.

Just now, he had obtained all the authority of the Tower and understood that the current situation of the Tower could only be described with one word: a mess.

99% of the mobility devices were damaged, 90% of the weapon systems were damaged, the energy system was completely damaged, the external communication system was completely damaged, and 80% of the internal communication system was damaged…

It could be said that the Gray Mage Tower was now a completely immovable iron lump!

It was completely different from what he thought.

What rule over the Mage World? It was all a lie!

However, it was indeed possible to repair it, but who knew how many years it would take?

“Sir, the Mage Tower’s situation is like this for the time being. However, Sir has obtained the authority to order some of the mechanical creations in the Magus Tower to begin self-repair. However, some important systems may still require help from real alchemists!” Sula sighed.

“That’s true!”

Eli nodded and looked helplessly at the screens in front of him.

..

Eli left.

He left very quickly.

That afternoon, he left the secret plane and returned to the Grassi Land with Vivika and Alida. As for what Eli had experienced inside, he had no comment and told the two to pretend that they had never gone out.

The two of them naturally agreed.

In the Mage Tower, Eli was sitting on a recliner, looking out the window, thinking about the Tower.

He left Dylan and a clone in the Gray Mage Tower to repair and destroy some monsters, while he decided to come back first.

“The repair of the wizard tower is a long way off. It seems that I have to go to the green fields and make the dwarves surrender. However, this matter has to be discussed in the long run. At least not in the short term, at least for a year or two. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“There must be some news from the Warlock Alliance, so I absolutely can’t do anything during this period of time. At least I can’t let others suspect me. I’ll pretend that nothing happened!”

The Mage Tower was too important. Even Eli did not dare to release the news. Otherwise, he would face the pressure of the entire world. That would be really troublesome.

But even so, he still felt a lot of pressure.

He needed to be stronger.

“No, continue with the previous idea!”

Under pressure, Eli decided to do something!

He quickly walked down the mage tower and headed to the laboratory.

He entered a laboratory.

In the laboratory, there were two living Warlocks sealed on two crosses. Eli ignored them and took out the seventeen people he had obtained this time.

“I have to deal with these people quickly!” Eli lowered his head and looked at these people.

Devouring power!

Now that he had advanced, he could absorb different laws. Therefore, Eli naturally thought of devouring other Warlocks to obtain laws.

Anyway, he had also done such a thing when he was at the Second Circle.

“Bring Patriarch Press over first.” Eli first looked at the Warlock he was ” familiar with “.

In the next moment.

Eli stretched out his hand, and a shadow appeared in his hand. Then, a crack appeared, and a tentacle slowly stretched out, pulling his corpse into it.

Digest, devour!

Eli slowly closed his eyes, sensing the changes.

Half an hour later.

He opened his eyes again, and his eyes shone with joy.

“It’s a success!” Eli took a deep breath and looked into his body.

At this moment, other than the two flowers of laws, there were three more fiery-red flowers that emitted dense fire elemental law energy, just like the former patriarch of the Press family!

It was useful!

Eli clenched his fists tightly, but in the next second, he seemed to have recalled something.

“Damn it, I forgot to save the corpse for the undead army!”

Eli closed his eyes and felt a pang of pain in his heart!

It hurt!

It was too painful!
