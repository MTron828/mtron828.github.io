558 The Deep Sea’s Response

A familiar name, a familiar soul fluctuation!

Even Eli had to admit that the Lich King might be David, his disciple in the mortal world.

“This…” The corner of Eli’s mouth twitched.

He had never expected this turn of events!

The enemy suddenly turned into his student, which made him feel a little complicated!

“Looks like a lot of things have happened over the years. Sigh!” Eli sighed. From a genius mage to a Lich, from the West Coast to the extreme north, from a determined mage to a cold Lich, perhaps David had experienced as much as he did.

“Looks like I have to deal with the Lich Tower later.” Eli shook his head.

The trouble caused by his own student should be settled by his teacher.

After knowing that David was the Lich King, Eli suddenly stopped panicking.

The reason…

“That means David’s soul was imprinted with a soul imprint.” Eli extended his senses into his body. In a certain corner, a soul imprint that had been dim for an unknown period of time was still there!

Even though it had long since lost its effect, to Eli, this extremely deep connection was enough to change a lot of things. As long as Eli broke through the law of the mage, as long as it was under the sixth circle, he had ways to subdue it.

Besides, David couldn’t possibly be at the sixth circle, or else the Bloodline Alliance would be gone already.

“The next time we meet will be the time to settle everything!”

Eli shook his head and walked into the wizard tower.

He was feeling very complicated at the moment and needed time to calm down.

A day later.

Eli confirmed it again and then went back to work.

The problem was solved, but there might be some changes in David that he was unaware of. He needed to become stronger, whether it was in terms of mastering the Laws of Light or improving his strength, especially the latter.

He needed to break through to become a Mage of Laws as soon as possible!

After two months of rest and training, he was fully prepared.

So one day, Eli strode to the bottom of the wizard tower and began his breakthrough.

The reason why it wasn’t in the time world fragment was that he was afraid that it would burst.

..

In the blink of an eye, another month passed.

On this day.

Suddenly, a massive power erupted from within the Mage Tower, and an extreme shadow power shot into the sky. Fortunately, the spell formation of the Grassi Land appeared in time and enveloped it, preventing outsiders from seeing it.

However, Hydra, Nikola, Phoenix, and the others inside raised their heads at the same time.

“The lord is even stronger!” Nikola sighed.

He had already broken through the Divine Tree, thanks to the Warlocks that Eli had killed.

Hiss hiss hiss!

The Hydra beside him could not help but let out a cry, its eyes filled with excitement.

To him, Eli was his only master. Naturally, the stronger, the better.

“How ridiculous!” Phoenix stretched his feathers, his heart numb.

During this period of time, he felt that he might not be able to leave this place for the rest of his life.

Eli’s strength had grown so fast that it was as if he had cheated.

At this moment, the Wizard Tower opened, and Eli walked out slowly.

“Congratulations on your breakthrough, sir!” Nikola and Phoenix congratulated him.

Hydra came up and rubbed against Eli’s body.

“Haha!” Eli revealed a smile, feeling pleased.

He had already broken through to the fifth level of the fifth circle, the Fruit of Law Realm. He was one step closer to the sixth circle.

If he were to sense the Tree of Law in his body, he would be able to see a small fruit growing on the top of the shadow of the huge Tree of Law. The shadow inside flowed as if it was nurturing everything.

This was the fruit of the law, the result of the law of shadow being condensed once again.

“This level of improvement is to continuously improve the fruit until it reaches the peak. However, I feel that I might still need to condense the Time Fruit. Perhaps my bloodline…” Eli pondered.

At his level, he had no choice but to consider the matter of sixth circle.

Sixth circle was related to the world. Although he still didn’t quite understand, he had vaguely found some resources. He knew that the sixth circle seemed to be based on the foundation of laws. The more natural laws, the better. The stronger, the better.

Therefore, Eli’s plan was to condense the rules of his main path.

The whole fifth circle was the life of the tree of laws. There were flowering and bearing fruits, so there would be death. Nirvana was the process of death.

The leaf of laws fell, the flower of laws decayed, the fruits of laws fell, the tree died, and then a stronger power was born from death, advancing to the sixth ring.

This was the secret of the Nirvana Mages.

Of course, Eli didn’t know what the detail of the process was.

Therefore, from a certain perspective, law Mage was actually at the peak of the fifth circle. As for Nirvana, it was an end or perhaps a beginning.

“Right now, my strength is about twice as strong as before, and there are many other changes!” Eli was deep in thought. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

At this moment, his strength was comparable to a peak Mage. If the hundred Warlocks from before came again, he would probably only need a third of the time to deal with them.

“Interesting. I have to comprehend this change.” Eli pursed his lips and glanced at his arm.

After another month, the collection of faith imprints finally stopped. At this moment, it had already reached 48 petals, and runes appeared on its surface!

“Compared to before, the lotus flower of faith seems to have changed a little. However, I can actually sense some emotions from the deep sea. It seems that this battle has still spread there.” Eli thought.

The power of faith also contained some of the emotions of others, such as shock, surprise, and understanding. However, this time, some of it came from the deep sea.

This meant that his power of faith was enough to reach the deep sea.

“Interesting. I wonder how Laura is doing!” Eli suddenly thought of the Mermaid Tribe, which he had casually invested in back then. He wondered how it was doing.

He closed his eyes.

The power of faith appeared in his mind one by one, appearing in various regions of the continent. Further away, in the deep sea, there was also a small light spot!

Seeing the light spot, Eli did not hesitate and immediately teleported his consciousness there.

Weng!

In an instant, the power of faith bloomed!

..

At the same time!

Deep Sea!

On top of a huge shell that was tens of thousands of meters wide, there were deep-sea buildings. Countless mermaids wandered here, making it look like an underwater paradise.

In the center was an even larger palace.

At this moment, a mermaid swam into the palace from the outside.

Within the palace, mermaids were roaming on both sides. At the very front was a beautiful figure. She was covered in seven-colored scales and fishtails. Her body was pure and flawless, and her appearance was incomparable. It was Laura!!

As soon as the mermaid entered, she came directly to Laura respectfully.

“Uncle Eval, how is the Imperial Dynasty?” Laura looked at the figure and asked directly.

The strange phenomenon in the sky more than a year ago also attracted the attention of the various races in the deep sea.

“From the looks of it, it seems like a war has broken out between the human forces. It doesn’t affect us much.” He shook his head, but his face was filled with worry!

“Then why did uncle…” Seeing this expression, Laura understood that there was something else.

“Your Majesty, it’s like this. During this meeting, the Imperial Dynasty decided to kick us out. All this while, it was because of your father that we were able to enter, but now they feel that we’re no longer powerful enough to enter the Imperial Dynasty.

“Moreover, the Megalodon Shark clan, who has been watching us, has also set their eyes on us. They are a powerful sea race with fifth circle. I’m afraid we’ll be in big trouble.” Eval said slowly.

“What? How dare they!” Laura stood up, her body trembling in anger.

However, a few seconds later, she sat down again with a face full of despair.

What could they do?

In the deep sea, strength was everything.

Although they had returned to the deep sea, their strength was still much weaker than before. Now, it was finally time to face everything. Could it be that they had to leave again?

She couldn’t accept this!

Laura bit her lip, feeling a sense of powerlessness in her heart. She turned her head and saw a statue not far away. It had not moved for hundreds of years.

“If Brother Eli was here… No, even if he was here, he couldn’t change anything!” She shook her head, and her eyes quickly became firm. She said to Eval, “We’ve been at odds with the Megalodon Shark Clan for a long time. Even if we leave, they won’t let us go. In that case, go to the other clans and ask for help.”

“Yes!” Eval nodded and turned to leave.

After he left, Lola sat back down and waved her hand to disperse the crowd. However, her face suddenly drooped as if she was tired and helpless!

She took the statue and muttered, “I became the queen of the merfolk, but you didn’t contact me.

“Liar!”

However, seeing that the statue was still the same as before, Laura could only shake her head helplessly. She then put it down again and closed her eyes to rest for a while.

What she didn’t notice was that after she closed her eyes.

The statue of faith suddenly flashed, but of course, it only lasted for an instant!
