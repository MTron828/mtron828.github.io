209 Return, Breakthrough

A day later.

The irises ‘campsite.

Eli and the others returned.

“My Lord, you’re finally back.” Before he even entered the campsite, Catarina had already come up to him.

“What happened recently? What’s wrong? ” Eli asked curiously as he cast a glance at her. Catarina was usually very calm.

“My Lord, the situation in the central continent has completely changed in the past two years. The bloodline tower is currently struggling under the black isotta’s suppression. And it’s not just them. Our hidden forces in the central continent have also been greatly affected, and several branches have been uprooted.” Catarina didn’t expect Eli to be gone for so long, so she told him about the recent situation.

“Okay, I got it.” Eli nodded.

With two third-circle warlocks, it was normal for them to suppress the bloodline tower. It was even possible that the bloodline tower would completely disappear in a few years. However, he did not have the time to care about this now. As long as he broke through to a third-circle mage, the situation would be completely different.

Catarina was stunned. Eli was way too calm.

“Catarina, prepare the materials. The ones I asked you to collect earlier. Take them all out and leave nothing behind.” Eli said to the stunned Catarina.

As the two of them walked, Catarina was also stunned when she heard this.

Materials?

Lord Roland had indeed asked them to gather materials, and as one of his subordinates, she knew what his goal was to break through to the level of a third-circle warlock.

Could it be that her master was about to break through?

Catarina’s face was filled with shock.

It wasn’t easy to become a 3rd Circle Warlock, not to mention that resources were hard to find in the current era. Moreover, they were on the relatively poor West Coast.

The third circle warlock was extremely rare on the West Coast, and it was the highest level.

If her master broke through to the third circle, it might change the situation.

“yes, yes, sir. I’ll go and prepare now.” Catarina’s voice trembled as she left in excitement.

Half a day passed in the blink of an eye.

Half a day later, Eli left the iris flower camp with the materials and headed for the White Tower.

Not all of his resources were collected by the irises. In fact, most of them were still in the White Tower, and a part of them was in the house of the undead north of the White Tower.

..

On the way back to the White Tower.

Along the way, Eli saw many warlocks with unfamiliar bloodlines. They were all warlocks who had left because of the war between the bloodline tower and black Isotta. There were even Warlock families among them, and some had second-circle warlocks.

They were running away to seek refuge so most of them stayed away from the White Tower. They were not dumb. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

The conflict between the White Tower and the black Isotta was known by many. Everyone knew that after the bloodline tower was destroyed, the White Tower would be next, so they naturally wouldn’t join the White Tower.

“I wonder how the White Tower is doing.” Eli shook his head and continued on.

A day later, Eli returned to the White Tower.

As soon as he returned to the periphery of the White Tower, Eli saw a large number of warlocks gathering. At the entrance, dozens of warlocks were gathered in a circle. A second circle Warlock stood at the front, carrying all sorts of bags. Behind him were two second-circle warlocks and many first-circle warlocks, all carrying many things as if they were escaping from a disaster.

In front of them was another human wall, but it was the guards of the White Tower. Among them was an old Warlock at the peak of the second circle, Rawls, who had already entered the late stage of his age.

The two sides seemed to be in a confrontation. Something must have happened at the White Tower.

“No, none of you can leave today.” Rawls exuded the aura of a second-circle warlock at the peak. He looked at the group of warlocks in front of him.

“Lord vice-chairman, everyone can see that the bloodline tower won’t last much longer. Our White Tower will be next.” The 2nd-circle warlock had triangular eyes and was currently looking at Rawls with a sinister expression.

“Hmph, the chairman hasn’t even given the order, and you’re already leaving with so many warlocks. You’ve gone too far.” Rawls just shook his head firmly as he would not let today’s event go.

The two-circle warlock gritted his teeth and looked at Rawls angrily.

It was unknown who had informed Rawls, otherwise, they should have been able to rush out smoothly.

“Rawls, we will definitely leave today. You’re already old, Can you stop us if we escape at the same time?” The two-circle warlock made a threat.

“You …” Rawls felt his blood boil. If he were young, he would have attacked by now, but he had matured since then.

“Just tell us if you’re going to let us go!” The warlock took another step forward and glared at Rawls, the aura of a late second-circle warlock emanating from his body.

Rawls’ body trembled as if he was ready to rush out and fight.

“Just let them go!” Suddenly, a hand touched Rawls ‘shoulder.

Rawls froze for a moment, he turned his head, and his eyes slowly revealed a shocked expression. He said in surprise, ” Herman, you’re back!”

“Yes.” Eli nodded and looked at the people in front of him calmly. He had more or less understood what had happened in the crowd just now.

It was just a small matter.

Herman!

Rawls was shocked, not to mention the others. They all looked at the name and confirmed that this face was the feared one from the Black Tower.

“it’s true. F * ck, why is he back? ” On the other side, the second-circle warlock looked at Eli in horror.

Although the outside world might not know, he had personally seen Eli take out eight warlocks the limit of second-circle decades ago. He would never forget that shocking scene.

But didn’t this guy go out?

Why did he suddenly come back?

He looked at the smiling Eli and felt his whole body tremble.

“Your, Your Excellency!” He stammered.

Eli just glanced at him, looked at Rawls, and joked, “if it were a few hundred years ago, we would definitely be in a fight now. You’re getting old!”

...

Rawls’ mouth twitched as he looked at Elie and said, ” ha, you’re older than me. If it weren’t for the fact that my bloodline’s lifespan is ordinary, you would definitely have died earlier than me.”

“Hahaha.” Eli smiled, but he was also a little sad. Rawls was also dying!

Rawls laughed as he looked at Eli.

As for the warlocks on the other side, they looked at each other, not knowing what to do.

“I’ve brought back some materials this time, and I might need more. Hurry up and organize a meeting.” Eli pulled Rawls away.

“But what about these people?!” Rawls directly staggered away.

Just as he thought of asking how to deal with those people, he suddenly heard a cry. He turned around and saw a large shadow on the ground. Countless tentacles stretched out and pulled the warlocks into the shadow. Although the warlocks struggled with all their might, it was useless.

“He’s gotten stronger again!” At the sight of this scene, Rawls drew in a cold breath.

The other warlocks were shocked as well, and the news of Herman’s return quickly spread throughout the camp.

On the other side, it was only then that Eli realized that Ross and the others weren’t around. He then found out that they had gone to attend a meeting regarding the bloodline tower.

Eli didn’t care about them and got Rawls to help collect all the resources he needed, then left the place again a day later.

...

The basic advancement materials had been gathered, and the next step was to go to the house of the undead.

..

Three days later.

Eli arrived at the territory of the house of the undead, located in the northern region of the White Tower, outside a forest.

“Forest of despair!” Eli stood on a high slope and looked at the area in front of him.

All he could see were large trees. However, compared to ordinary trees, these trees were all pitch-black in color. There were white patterns on the trunks that looked like Ghost faces, and the branches that extended out looked like the sharp claws of a demon. It wasn’t that the trees were like this in the first place but that they were the result of being contaminated with undead aura for a long time.

This was the home of the undead’s territory. Although he was still a few hundred meters away, Eli could still hear the meaningless mumbling of a large number of undead in the forest, and he could see their figures.

The life force of the forest before him had long been sucked dry. It was a Forest of Death.

With just a glance, Eli took out a bone token from the arcane realm and strode in.

As soon as he stepped into the forest, dozens of spirits of the dead immediately flew towards him, but after sensing the token, they left one after another because it had Nikola’s aura on it.

Walking in this Forest of Death, the ground was deathly white. These were all corpses before the undead transformation.

It had a lot to do with Eli. When he released Nikola back then, it actually meant that many lives would die. Eli knew this very well, but he still did it. The reason was simple. He needed Nikola to collect soul crystals for him.

It might be cruel, but Eli didn’t regret it.

Most of the corpses here were magic beasts and warlocks. Stepping into the magical world meant that one had to be ready to face death. This was just their bad luck.

This was the law of survival in the mage World, the law of the jungle.

It was the same as how warlocks hunted down Mages.

Stepping on the bones, Eli went all the way to the center of the forest.

In the center of the forest, there was a huge bone altar. It was seven or eight meters tall and covered an area of nearly 200 square meters. It was made of white bones, and undead flames burned around it.

This was the advancement altar that Eli had prepared for himself.

He would complete his advancement here.
