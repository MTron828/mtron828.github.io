89 Wait

After Seviro’s death, Eli sighed, turned around, and walked out.

The two guards were waiting.

“let’s go,” said Eli directly.

“Alright,” he said. The guard nodded.

!!

“Sir Warden, how is seviro’s condition? Should I go in and take a look?” The prison guards were a little hesitant.

“He’s in pretty good shape. We’ll see how it goes later.” Eli said calmly, having transformed back into Kaelun.

“Alright!”

Just like that, Eli was brought out of the prison without anyone stopping him.

Eli got into the carriage and headed back the way he came. On the way, he found an excuse to get out of the carriage and left the place, secretly returning to Jun Lin to go home.

When the guard was wondering why the old master wasn’t back three hours later, he finally realized that something was wrong. He looked around but didn’t find any traces.

“I’m done for.” The guard felt that something was not right and was ready to leave and return to the manor.

When they arrived at the manor, everyone was shocked after the report was made. The guard who had been standing guard outside the door mustered his courage and opened the door, only to see Kaelun tied up and unconscious on the bed.

The Herm family was shocked.

Meanwhile, in the prison…

When the guards returned and saw the dead Seviro Mesa and the broken chain, they understood that something major had happened.

The Grand Knight in charge of this place was also dumbfounded.

He immediately brought a team of Knights to the Herm family to demand an explanation.

Marquis Herm was also dumbfounded. On the other side, when he found out that Kaelun was unconscious, he was dumbfounded.

He told the grand knight who was stationed at the prison the truth, but the grand knight didn’t believe him. His guards weren’t blind, so how could they mistake the warden for someone else?

He immediately thought that Marquis Herm was covering for his son and reported it to Bryne the seventh.

Bryne the seventh was furious!

He gave the order to capture Kaelun, but at the same time, the Herm family was also in deep trouble. They were immediately searched, and a large number of crimes against the Empire were found. Then, their title was immediately cut off.

When Kealun, who had just woken up, saw the dozen or so Knights around him, he was dumbfounded. After knowing what ” he ” had done, he was even more dumbfounded. He quickly denied it, but no one believed him. Or rather, the king did not want to believe it.

Just like that, when Alex woke up, he was also dumbfounded to hear that his old enemy had been arrested.

As for why Bryne the seventh had such a strong reaction, there was a reason for it.

The Imperial mausoleum represented the dignity of the royal family. The fact that it had been dug up shamed him. The king needed to push someone out as the scapegoat, and the Herm family was it.

Secondly, everyone was watching. If he didn’t give a reasonable explanation, Bryne the seventh’s prestige would be reduced again.

Of course, these were all stories for later.

…

On the third day.

The Imperial Library retrieved seviro’s body and buried it in the library’s tomb. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

It might have been a coincidence, but it rained heavily that day.

Eli offered seviro a bouquet of flowers, then stood in the crowd and watched the priest recite a prayer.

A woman who looked to be in her 30s was crying heavily. In the rain, she did not hold an umbrella and allowed the rain to hit her body. Everyone could see her sadness.

She was Seviro’s daughter.

Seviro’s daughter was already 30 years old. After all, seviro was almost 60 years old. How could his daughter be so young? She was very beautiful.

Eli sighed.

From a certain point of view, seviro had a sad life.

He was actually very talented as a mage, but it was a pity that he was born in this world. On the other hand, it was the ordinary-looking Eli who got the mage’s inheritance. It was really a freak combination of factors.

His first 20 years had been tragic.

His twenty years in the middle were glorious.

For the last 20 years, he had been caught in a maddening search.

This was seviro’s life, brilliant and glorious.

After the banquet ended, the others left.

On the other hand, Eli was following Seviro’s daughter, and he quickly caught up to her.

“Hello, I’m a friend of your father. I’m also very sad that your father died, but jun lin is not suitable for you to stay for long,” said Eli directly.

“Um.” the woman was shocked as well, but when eli took out a bracelet that he had taken from seviro before he left, the woman nodded.

It was the necklace that her father always carried with him, and it was impossible for outsiders to get their hands on it.

“Alright,” she said. The woman was also very straightforward. She understood that Junlin was not suitable for her.

“Alright, I’ll make the arrangements. You can go home and pack,” said Eli directly.

The two separated.

Since he had promised Seviro, it was only natural that Eli would fulfill his promise.

Three hours later, a caravan carrying a large number of goods set off from the Kazan Chamber of Commerce, heading for the Lorraine Kingdom.

“You’ll be safe in the Lorraine kingdom. Someone will take care of everything. you don’t have to worry about money for the rest of your life.” Eli said to the woman in the carriage.

“This isn’t good.” The woman was a little hesitant. She had received so many benefits for no reason. He had sent her away and arranged everything.

If she remembered correctly, her father had been in a state of poverty for a long time. How could he have the ability to pay this man in advance?

“Don’t worry, seviro has already given me enough compensation.” As if he could read the woman’s mind, Eli said.

Seviro had indeed given him his reward.

It was a place where there was a 90% chance that Saleen metatrin’s remains were still there.

To Eli, this alone was worth an entire manor.

Not to mention, seviro had even paid with his life for it.

“I’ll drop you off here. The journey was thankfully smooth.” Eli bade farewell.

“I’ll definitely repay you in the future.” The woman said gratefully.

“There’s no need.” Shaking his head, Eli got out of the car.

They were on the road a few kilometers away from Junlin, and there were still many people.

Looking at the long line of carriages, Eli turned around and returned to Jun Lin.

…

Although Seviro had died, he had left behind very precious information.

Saleen metatrin’s legacy was left in the palace, and it was in the underground of the main hall.

It was impossible to excavate that place without making a sound. There were even countless Grand Knights in the palace. Even if it were Eli, it would be impossible for him to escape from the hands of more than ten grand Knights.

Therefore, he couldn’t be reckless in this matter. He had to be fully prepared.

If it was seviro, he might have immediately sneaked into the palace.

Eli shook his head thinking of his friend.
