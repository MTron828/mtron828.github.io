473 Blood Sacrifice, Change of Situation

As long as they found it, evidence was never necessary.

Meanwhile, Eli continued to quietly comprehend the laws at home and conduct his own experiments.

The success of the experiment was getting closer and closer, and it was indeed time to start some operations.

This time, the Hamis family would help him find out the true situation of the Heart of the Abyss!

..

Eastern Region!

A city left behind by the Twilight Lizard Family!

Having lost the main power of the family, this place was temporarily requisitioned by Fayed!

In the conference room of the Magus Tower!

Fayed sat in the main seat, and below him were many other factions!

“Did anyone find anything?” Fayed looked at the people below and asked casually.

In the past few days, he had sent these warlocks to investigate almost all of the Western Regions.

“Sir, we haven’t found anything yet. The enemy is hiding deeper than we thought. Although we’ve worked hard, we still haven’t found anything!

“Even the Heart of the Abyss and the Bloodline Tower were investigated in the name of the Lord, but we can’t find any clues!” A Warlock frowned.

“We don’t have any here either.”

“We don’t have it either!”

The Warlocks reported and looked at Fayed carefully, only to find that their lord was not as angry as they had imagined. He seemed to be quite relaxed!

“Sigh, looks like you guys still can’t do it!” Fayed shook his head and took out a pile of things, including documents and other items.

“This is?” A Warlock asked curiously.

“Hehe, maybe you guys are really too weak. You actually didn’t discover anything, but my people only took a round and found so much.” Fayed narrowed his eyes.

“These are some of the actions that the Heart of the Abyss did or hid before, but we found out that they did this a long time ago. It’s very likely that they did this.”

It wasn’t that they were ignorant, but Fayed’s words were simply too shocking!

If it were really done by the Heart of the Abyss, then things would be big!

It would be troublesome to solve it!

After all, that was the Heart of the Abyss!

“Sir, this matter involves the Heart of the Abyss. Could it be that someone framed them? Moreover, could this matter be too coincidental? After all, the Heart of the Abyss is a top faction in the Western Regions…..” a Warlock advised.

“Heh, a top force? Not just any Tom, Dick, or Harry can call themselves a top force. The Western Regions are just not that important to us, so we let the Heart of the Abyss dominate. However, if they dare to attack us, we will let them know what it means to be powerful!”

Fayed stood up and looked at the Warlock with a sharp gaze!

The Warlock’s body trembled, realizing that he had said something wrong.

The Heart of Abyss was indeed powerful, but could it defeat these top-notch families of the Warlock Union?

“Hmph, I’ve already reported this to the family. The family will send two half-step fifth circle people to arrive in a few days. Tell all the eastern factions to prepare for me. If they really did it, then be prepared to be destroyed!” Fayed sneered, his eyes filled with contempt!

A mere Heart of the Abyss.

Did they really think that they could look down on everyone just because they had half-step fifth circle clan leader?

In any case, they had long been unhappy with the Western Regions. Perhaps they could take this opportunity to take over this place. Or rather, this was their true goal. Otherwise, their families would not have sent people so quickly!

“No matter who gave us this information, since it’s given to us, we’ll take advantage of the opportunity to swallow this fat meat.”

Fayed was not a fool. How could so much evidence fall into his hands so easily? But since it was sent, he naturally would not refuse, and neither would the Hamis family!

They had been coveting the Western Regions for a long time.

This time, he finally found an excuse.

..

Three days later.

War had broken out!

The two half-step fifth circle figures from the Hamis family led the forces in the eastern part of the Western Region to produce evidence and declare war on the Heart of the Abyss!

The Heart of the Abyss naturally would not admit to this evidence. Nero naturally would not allow the Hamis family to search as they pleased. After all, the evidence really could not see the light of day.

Unsurprisingly, war broke out.

“It went smoother than I thought. It seems that this should be in line with the interests of the Hamis family, so they went with the flow and launched a war, wanting to swallow the Heart of the Abyss!”

Eli stood in the Tower, looking at the grassy land in front of him.

Even he did not expect the plan to go so smoothly!

“However, it’s only two half-step fifth-circle warlocks. They’ve underestimated the Heart of the Abyss. It seems that the various factions are very unclear about the power level of Heart of the Abyss. They thought that they only had one half-step fifth-circle warlock. However, it’s enough to help us test their strength.

“Moreover, with so many people, there shouldn’t be any major problems. The Heart of the Abyss shouldn’t have the courage to fight these major factions head-on.” Eli pondered!

Of course, it would be best if the Hamis family could directly destroy the Heart of the Abyss. That way, his trouble would be gone.

“Unfortunately, that’s not possible. These major powers have their roots in the central region, so it’s impossible for them to send so many people here. Even those top combat powers are restricted. The Warlock Union isn’t as united as one, and the other powers won’t allow them to swallow the western region in one go.

“Perhaps the Hamis family was acting alone this time, and the other forces did not know!” Eli pursed his lips and guessed!

However, no matter how it developed, this matter had nothing to do with him.

“My Bloodline Tower will stay in place, but I’ll still ask Alida to shrink her forces so that we don’t disturb the battle between the two sides.” T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Eli chuckled and informed Alida.

Then, he walked toward the laboratory again.

He had to continue the experiment as soon as possible.

In the end, everything depended on him.

..

The Heart of the Abyss.

“Who did this? Can someone tell me who did this?”

Nero angrily waved his arms and gritted his teeth as he looked at the Warlocks in front of him.

“Who else can tell me? Who can tell me why the matter was leaked?”

The Warlocks in front of him were the Warlocks that had been promoted after Tuman and Lous’ deaths, including Faerun.

Faerun frowned and raised his head. “Sir, this matter has absolutely nothing to do with us. Look at the evidence. It’s even from a long time ago. Moreover, it’s just some guesses. There’s no way to directly prove that this matter is related to us!”

“Indeed.” Another Warlock said, ” At the end of the day, this is just a guess. It’s fine as long as we refuse to admit it. Moreover, this is probably just an excuse the Hamis family found to bully our family!”

The Warlocks shared their thoughts.

Nero rubbed his temples, feeling a headache.

Initially, he had only wanted to initiate a blood sacrifice. He thought he had cleaned up all the evidence, but somehow they were still involved. They were involved. It was really troublesome!

Moreover, the Hamis family came aggressively. They couldn’t possibly give up everything.

“Milord, what should we do next?”Faerun asked.

Nero raised his head, and his gaze gradually turned cold. “I didn’t want this to happen.

“We’ve been quietly carrying out our plans, but there are always some people who try to take advantage of us. It’s time to teach them a lesson and let them understand why we’re the top faction in the Western Regions. We’ll also make the Hamis family, who looks down on us, withdraw from the Western Regions!”

He slowly stood up and took a deep breath. “Since we’re going to fight, we have to be ruthless and make all the factions fear us. Only then can our next plan be smoothly implemented!

“Otherwise, we’ll be blamed for every accident. Who knows when we’ll be able to break the seal!

“Faerun, Cauchy, Ola, you are all half-step fifth circle warlocks. You will lead the army to fight. You must kill all the Warlocks that are attacking this time. Not a single one will be left alive.

“Since they look down on us, let’s show them our strength!

“On the other hand, send someone to investigate who slandered us!”

Black and red lines appeared on Nero’s face, and his eyes gradually turned red. A wave of pressure pressed down on them like a tidal wave, making them feel very pressured.

However, the few of them were not nervous at all. Instead, they revealed cruel smiles.

The Hamis family thought they were still the old Heart of the Abyss. But in reality, they were cruel and bloody demons!

“Yes, sir!”

Faerun lowered his head and said. The blood essence in his body was getting thicker and thicker!

Last time, he didn’t kill many people. This time, he could finally kill to his heart’s content.
