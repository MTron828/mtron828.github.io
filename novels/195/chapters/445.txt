446 The Demons’ Ambush

Thank you readers!

Crack!

Large chunks of flesh and blood fell from the Mother Nest in the sky, and demons jumped out one after another!

And this was not the most shocking part!

In the center of the mother nest, there were eight huge Balors. They also held huge flame whips. They had thick and ferocious horns on their heads, and their auras had reached the peak of the sun.

!!

They looked at the humans on the ground with smiles, full of mockery!

Boom!

In the next second, eight Balors jumped up, and their bodies became bigger and bigger as they landed.

The eight Balors landed on the ground, and the impact caused the flames on the ground to churn. Countless Warlocks and demons were killed by the Balors as they landed, and the Balors glared at the human celestials.

At this moment, all the humans were stunned. Their mouths were wide open as they watched the change in the situation before them!

” Ah, how could this be? The demons hid most of their combat power. We were fooled. ”

” Nine Peak Radiant Sun Balors. How are we going to fight them? ”

” Conspiracy, this is a complete conspiracy! ”

All the Warlocks were panicking and feeling despair!

This time, their combat team was strictly formed according to the demon team they had scouted previously. Of course, for insurance, they still added a portion, so there were still some extra Warlocks. However, compared to the hidden strength of the demons in front of them, it was still not enough.

Even the Eight-Armed Naga, who was at the peak of Level Two, only had three Suns warlocks, let alone them.

Even if a few forces came out in full force, they would only be able to gather eight or nine Sun warlocks at most. However, there were a total of eight peak Sun Balors hidden in the demon nest in front of them!

This power was even enough to fight a few second-class forces head-on.

The Holy Tower Master, who was fighting the Balor in the distance, was also stunned for a moment!

“How is that possible?” His body was trembling. For the first time, he felt that the plan this time might not be so perfect!

The enemy was much stronger than they had imagined!

The Balor instantly found an opportunity. Its right hoof stomped on the ground, and the whip in its hand instantly transformed into a hundred-meter-long pillar of flames that flew toward him, emitting a shrill sound as it tore through the air.

Holy Sword couldn’t dodge in time and was instantly hit, flying into the distance.

Boom!

He was directly blasted into the ground and only got up after a few seconds. However, he had already suffered quite a few injuries. This was how top-notch battles were. As long as he was distracted for a moment, the enemy could find his weakness and cause considerable damage!

However, it was clear that he had no time to pay attention to this. When he got up again, he found that the Balor in front of him had already turned into two. The other two clan leaders were also facing at least two peak Sun Balors. As for the other three, they were facing other celestials.

Gulp!

Holy Sword’s mouth twitched, but he felt a wave of despair in his heart!

He was evenly matched with one of them. In addition, he was injured now. If he faced two of them, he would probably die in less than an hour!

Moreover, he was not the only one. The other two clan leaders were even weaker than him. They might not be able to last as long as he did. By the time he finished them off, the other Balors would definitely not be able to escape. If the high-end combatants died, the fate of the other Warlocks would be self-evident!

He seemed to have already thought of the top news in Central Continent tomorrow!

” Three Second-Class Forces in the Western Regions were ambushed by the Evil Demons and were completely annihilated! ”

“Die!”

At this time, the Balors in the distance had stepped on the ground again and rushed towards him, one on each side!

Holy Sword took a deep breath.

One minute later!

Bang!

The Holy Sword was sent flying again. At this moment, there were already several wounds on his body. Almost three-quarters of his clothes were destroyed, and a faint layer of flames burned on his body, continuously corroding his body.

He looked around.

Not far away, the other two family heads were on the verge of collapsing under the Balors’ attack. They were also heavily injured and were almost risking their lives to resist!

As for the other three Balors, two of them were fighting the Sun Warlocks one-on-one. One of them had already lost half of his body, and a blood-red mist was floating in the sky. The remaining one was dodging the Balor’s attacks left and right and had no chance to attack. The last one was slaughtering the low-level Warlocks. Every time he waved his whip, a tsunami of flames could be seen. Every time, hundreds and thousands of Warlocks would die. Even celestial Warlocks would find it difficult to resist!

The difference was too great. One Sun level combat power was enough to break the balance of the war, let alone eight.

He had underestimated the enemy and overestimated himself!

“I’m going to become a sinner of the Holy Tower!” Holy Sword had never been as desperate as it was today!

At this moment, with another boom, the other two clan leaders were sent flying at the same time. The two of them flew toward the Holy Sword.

Seeing the two of them gathering toward the Holy Sword, the six Balors let out a hiss and gathered together.

In less than a minute, the battlefield was instantly divided into two halves. On one side were the bloodthirsty and violent Balors. Nine peak Sunlight Balors stood in a row, like an insurmountable mountain range. On the other side were the warlocks, who were in despair. The celestials supported each other.

At this moment, even the most determined Warlock could not help but feel despair.

Luo Ye clutched the wound on his chest and looked at the terrifying Evil Demons in front of him. The arrogance in his heart also disappeared without a trace this time!

“There’s no chance of victory!” He spat out a mouthful of blood and said in despair.

“Hehe, looks like today is my last day.”

” Who the f * ck would have thought that this would be the outcome? The Heart of the Abyss! It must be them! Otherwise, how could there be so many demons? ”

The Warlocks all cursed. At the moment when they were about to lose their lives, everyone had different reactions. Some silently closed their eyes, some cursed and vented their dissatisfaction, some burned their blood and prepared to fight to the death, and some looked around to see if there was a chance to escape!

At this moment, even the three family heads did not want to care anymore. At this moment, the three of them looked at each other with bitter expressions.

“It’s over!” Holy Sword sighed, but in the next second, the flames around his body began to move.

...

He changed the topic and gritted his teeth.” But before I die, I have to drag an Evil Demon down with me! ”

In the next second, his figure slowly flew into the sky. A layer of scorching flames suddenly began to brew toward his body, emitting a powerful aura.

Looking at his actions, no one smiled. They all felt even more bitter.

Burning Bloodline was a method that every Warlock would only use when they were in a desperate situation. Once it started, there was no way out.

Even so, when they saw that their family head was actually preparing to burn their bloodlines, the other families and Warlocks also took a deep breath. In the next second, thousands of bloodlines were ready to be ignited, and their eyes were filled with burning battle intent!

“Come on, demon bastards!”

Holy Sword stood high in the sky and shouted at the Balors. This made the Balors unconsciously take a few steps back!

Although it hadn’t started yet, they could still feel the threat!

In the next second!

“Family heads, wait a moment. Don’t burn your bloodline!”

At this moment, a loud voice came from afar. Everyone looked behind them.

A huge spell formation had been carved on the mountain from before, and Nikola was standing in it with a statue in his hand. Eli saw that there were too many enemies, so he decided to let Nikola hide and draw a spell formation to better collect his power!

“Nikola!”

At this moment, Holy Sword turned around and frowned at Nikola. What was he trying to do?

What use could a spell formation have?

The others also felt very unhappy that they were interrupted. After all, they were about to die gloriously, but you interrupted them!

Nikola felt a little embarrassed when he saw the displeasure of the crowd, but he had no choice!

They couldn’t possibly burn their bloodlines and die before their lord landed!

Of course, he did not explain. He just raised the statue above his head and activated the spell formation under his feet.

In the next second.

A golden pillar of light shot into the sky and broke through the clouds!

At the same time, Bloodline City!

Everyone stopped and looked out of the city. They only saw the huge statue bursting with unprecedented light. A pillar of light soared into the sky, devastating and dazzling.

In the Mage Tower, Eli looked at the two remaining faith imprints that were instantly cleared, then closed his eyes!

When he opened his eyes again, he only saw the light wrapping around him, as well as strands of faith surrounding him.

Eli looked down.

Beneath his feet, the Fire Demons and human Warlocks were all staring at him blankly, not knowing what to do.

“Eli!”

Luo Ye opened his mouth wide and looked up at the sky in shock!

The others who had seen Eli’s portrait looked at him in a daze as if they could not imagine why he would appear here!

The demons were a little confused, but one of the peak Balor directly let out a roar, then stepped on the ground and flew towards Eli with a bang. The whip in his hand was like a cross-regional space, wanting to tear Eli into pieces.

“Die!”

A buzzing soul voice echoed in everyone’s ears.

Eli looked down at the Balor and waved his hand. Countless shadows emerged from the void behind him and turned into a huge palm. Then, he swung it out in an instant!

The space trembled, and the shadow was terrifying.

In an instant, the shadow came in front of the Balor and gently touched him as if nothing had happened. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

In the next second, a black light suddenly exploded. Everyone only saw darkness in front of them.

However, when everyone regained their vision and saw the scene in front of them, they all sucked in a breath of cold air.

“Hiss!”

Holy Sword’s burning bloodline stopped abruptly. He felt his heart stop for a second.

He couldn’t believe what he was seeing.
