471 First Fusion, City Massacre

Time slowly passed.

Although the Warlock Alliance was furious, the Western Region was still dispensable to them. Moreover, they had lost a half-step fifth circle warlock, so these people had decided to give up control of the Western Region!

This made Eli even more glad that he had not told them.

If he told them first, it would be hard to convince them, but would they really be willing to spend a huge amount of resources and risk major damage to help the Western Regions? Of course, there was a possibility that they might be invaded by demons, but at least they would be able to delay for a while before Nero and the others could retreat.

That would be troublesome!

Time slowly passed.

Ten years later!

Grassi Land!

At this moment, Eli was standing not far away, with Giovanni lying beside him.

“Eli, how much progress have you made in your experiment?” Giovanni asked curiously.

“More than half!”

Eli replied.

“It’s more than half done. Looks like my mission is almost over. The damage from your experiments is strange. It makes me feel like I’m back in the Mage’s era, but it’s much scarier.” Giovanni smiled.

“Yes!”

Eli replied, looking at the green grass that had grown for countless generations not far away.

“It’s been ten years!”

Eli was in a trance, not because of the passage of time but because the past ten years had not been peaceful at all.

Seven years ago.

The western part of the western region, which was the region of the Soya Mountain Range, had collapsed.

The collapse extended for tens of thousands of meters, and even Holmes City was destroyed. City Lord Amanta brought hundreds of thousands of city residents to join Eli and was taken in by Eli!

He had gone there to explore after the incident. Although there was nothing there, he had felt the same feeling he had felt at the Eight-Armed Naga. That charred black aura of death!

He had carefully investigated and searched, but he did not find anything wrong!

After all, if they really wanted to break the seal, they had to consider everything. If they failed, they would definitely be noticed by the Warlocks. Therefore, they only had one chance. It was entirely possible to do some rehearsals.

And an incident five years ago had proven Eli’s conjecture.

A large number of living beings in a mountain range had all died. It was suspected that they had been sacrificed!

Logically speaking, this matter might not necessarily be directly linked to the Heart of the Abyss, but Nikola’s team had seen people from the Heart of the Abyss appear nearby at that time!

How could this be a coincidence?

“The rehearsal has begun. How long will it take for the official performance?”

Eli shook his head.

He had long wanted to make a move, but it was a pity that whether it was the laws or the bloodline experiment, they were far from being successful. They were not foolproof yet, so he had to continue waiting.

“There’s still time!”

Eli took a deep breath and returned to the laboratory.

Next, he had to speed up the progress!

He would add some more people. In these ten years, he would have nurtured a new batch of talents.

..

Time passed.

Five years later!

Under Eli’s instructions, the total number of peripheral and core personnel participating in the two experiments had reached 50,000. Almost all the talents in this field had been plundered.

Eli even dug out a few mountains near the City of Bloodline for experiments. For this, he pulled in countless dragons. Even the Blue Dragon Sayis ” volunteered ” to join the experiment.

Of course, with such manpower and resources, the experiment progressed rapidly!

At this time, the Celestial Bloodline Body’s balance point search was already 70%.

“Soon, soon. Give me a few more years!”

Eli took a deep breath and looked at the distant sky.

Another fifteen years.

In the laboratory. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Eli was sitting on the ground with two figures behind him.

One was the avatar of the Shadow Dragon that controlled the shadows, while the other was the celestial that controlled the elements!

If anyone else saw this, their jaws would probably drop.

This was because there had never been a fourth-circle warlock who possessed both!

What was even more shocking was that the two of them were still getting closer and closer. There was even a certain level of overlap as if they were merging!

Illusion and reality collided, and the fusion of the two was getting closer and closer to the limit.

At this moment, the entire experiment lab was also filled with red bloodline fog and elemental storms. They wrapped around Eli like gauze clothes, making whooshing sounds. The nearby experimental equipment also made cracking sounds.

As the fusion of the two reached its limit, the sound became louder and louder, as if it was about to reach its limit!

However, in the next second, there was a bang, followed by a series of explosions. The blood mist and elements suddenly disappeared, and the fusion of the two stopped abruptly.

“Just a little more!”

Eli opened his eyes and sighed deeply.

The experiment progress was close to 92%, and he was getting closer and closer to finding that point.

Today, he was also on a whim. He was almost done, so he tried to fuse it at the last minute. Unfortunately, it still failed. However, it also allowed him to eliminate some mistakes and push the progress to 96%.

“Soon.” Eli was a little happy, but when he turned around and saw the broken experimental equipment on the ground, the smile on his face froze. This was his most expensive laboratory!

“100,000 magic crystals, 300,000 magic crystals, and 1,000,000 magic crystals….” Eli’s throat moved slightly as he felt his heart throb!

It took him a few minutes to recover. As he walked out, he comforted himself, “It’s okay. I’m not short of money. I’m not short of money…”

Eli walked out of the laboratory and entered the picturesque valley. He was in a much better mood!

In the distance, Hill was breathing in and out life elements that resembled mist. She was getting closer and closer to the fourth circle. Meanwhile, Hydra and Ortiz, who were further away, were at loggerheads.

On the other hand, Giovanni was not there because he was in the Green Field and had gone back to deal with the matters of his race!

“In the past fifteen years, although many things have happened, they haven’t made any big moves. I don’t know if they’re preparing for something big!”

Eli sighed.

All these years, the Heart of the Abyss had been relatively honest and did not do anything big. However, this made him even more nervous because the Heart of the Abyss was not a kind person!

“Maybe they really didn’t do anything!” Eli felt that he was overthinking things.

“Brother Eli!”

At the same time, a voice suddenly entered Eli’s ears. He saw an anxious Vivika running towards him from afar.

Looking at the anxiety on her face, Eli knew that something big had happened.

This was because, compared to the last dragon invasion, her eyes were even more flustered now!

A few seconds later, Vivika ran up to Eli, panting heavily.

“What happened?” Eli steadied her and asked.

After being fixed, Vivika raised her head, panic flashing in her eyes. “Sir, the Twilight Lizard Family is gone. All the Warlocks in the family died overnight.”

“What?”

“Is it a demon invasion? That’s not right. If it was a demon invasion, I didn’t sense any spatial fluctuations…..”

Even Eli couldn’t remain calm.

Compared to the Saka Family, the Twilight Monitor Lizard Family was even stronger. It was similar to the Akasha Family that Eli had once fought against. It was also a top-notch force among the Level 2 forces!

It shouldn’t be!

” It’s not a demon invasion! ” Vivika quickly denied it and continued, ” It’s not an invasion. It’s a blood sacrifice! ”

Blood sacrifice!

Thump thump thump thump!

Eli took a step back. When he heard this word, his eyes widened!

Damn it!

What a jinx he was!
