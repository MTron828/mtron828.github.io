181 Shocked Crowd

The familiar White Tower.

On the stairs leading to the White Tower, more than a dozen warlocks were standing in a circle. Rawls, Ross, Theron, and the other warlocks were all seriously injured. Below them were a large number of apprentices, all of whom had serious looks on their faces.

These were the main members who had participated in the battle earlier. At this moment, they were almost at their limits.

The battle had almost stopped, and the only ones who were still confronting each other were Kratos and Pabulo.

However, Kratos was also in a terrible situation. Since there were more people from the blood alliance, more than one person attacked Kratos. At this time, one of his arms had been torn, and most of the scales on his body were broken and covered in blood.

At this moment, Kratos was half-kneeling on the ground, and not far from him was Pabulo.

“Kratos, it’s over!” Although Pabulo’s rock body was also damaged, it was basically intact.

“Damn it!” Kratos clenched his fists and glared at Pabulo.

The others were also in despair.

At this point, no one felt that there was any chance of turning things around.

Ross pursed his lips, his face bitter. He had been wandering around. If it weren’t for his Lord, he wouldn’t be where he was today. It also changed his fate. Was it going to end again today? He was really an unlucky fellow!

“It seems that I can only pledge my loyalty to you in my next life.” He looked around and sighed as he saw that there were still many enemies.

“It’s only been about a hundred years. Are we done already?” Theron, Jesse, and the others sighed. They looked at the tall white Tower behind them and lowered their heads.

This time, they had underestimated the Blood Alliance.

“Herman didn’t come. He must have been killed too. Too bad I haven’t fought him face to face.” Rawls looked at the smug Pabulo and swallowed the blood in his mouth, revealing his sharp teeth.

On the other side.

“I can’t imagine how angry you must be!” Pabulo laughed complacently when he saw Kratos’ expression.

After today, the Blood Alliance would welcome new glory.

“eh, but where did that guy, Sores, go? ” Pabulo looked at the person behind him and asked. This guy had left the group since the beginning and hadn’t shown up until now.

“Sores, I saw him on the way here.”

A voice was heard.

Pabulo frowned and turned to look.

From a short tower not far away, a Warlock jumped over.

“Herman!!”

The people from the White Tower immediately recognized him and revealed shocked expressions. Only crazy people would come here at this time.

“I think he’s the head of the logistics department of the White Tower. He’s Herman,” Someone from the Blood Alliance said to Pabulo.

“Herman?” Pabulo also looked at the nearby Eli, revealing a strange expression. “you’re Herman? Sores told me about you. You’re a Warlock at the peak of the first circle. I didn’t expect you to dare to come!”

“This is White Tower. You’re the one who shouldn’t have come,” Eli replied.

“Herman, leave quickly.” Kratos was both shocked and touched.

In his opinion, there was no hope for Eli to win this battle. He might still have a chance of survival if he hid.

Furthermore, a one-circle warlock’s strength was completely useless here. He was too weak. This was not a competition but a real life-and-death battle!

With the strength of a one-circle warlock, he would be courting death.

“Sir Herman, you shouldn’t have come!” Among the first circle warlocks, there was also the one that Eli was familiar with, Evena. She sighed, and the rabbit ears drooped down, her eyes red.

“As expected, he still came.” Rawls’ feelings were complicated. He knew that Eli was very strong, but he was definitely no match for Pabulo, who was at the limit of his second circle.

..

“Sorry, this place will soon be ours!” Pabulo shook his head, looking at Eli. “You’re very courageous. You actually dared to come here. What made you come here at this time? Is it courage out of boredom? ” Pablo laughed heartily.

The other warlocks from the blood Alliance also laughed. At this time, they thought that the war was over.

“Of course, it’s to kill you,” Eli looked at Pabulo and said calmly.

Pabulo’s massive body trembled, and he laughed even louder.

His bloodline was activated once more, and his body transformed into a series of rocks. His eyes also gradually turned into an earthen yellow color. He looked at Eli, stretched out his hand, and pointed to the large number of blood alliance members behind him.

There are nine second-circle warlocks, forty first-circle warlocks, and more than five hundred apprentices. They are all elites from the Blood Alliance. Even the apprentices had their bloodlines fused.

“I don’t think you can even defeat a one-circle warlock. Do you think you have the right to kill me?” Pabulo stared at Eli, expressing pride in his heart.

The corner of Eli’s mouth twitched. “Can you f * cking stop talking!”

“I should tell you more about me, so you know how stupid you are.

“I started meditating as a Warlock apprentice when I was six, and I became a Level 1 Apprentice when I was eight. I reached Level 3 when I was twelve, and I became a level 1 Warlock when I was sixteen. I also fused with the bloodline of a third-circle mountain giant. I’m only three hundred years old now, and I’m already at the limit of the second circle. I might even break through to the third ring in the future. What makes you think you can kill me?” Pabulo’s aura gradually erupted as he spoke word by word.

Eli sucked in a breath of cold air.

He couldn’t take it anymore. Why would this man ramble so much?

“Roar!”

As a Dragon’s Roar rang out, everyone could only see that Eli’s aura had instantly become stronger. His eyes also gradually turned into cold vertical pupils, and scales appeared one after another.

He then stomped on the ground and charged straight at Pabulo.

????

Everyone in the White Tower widened their eyes. What kind of bloodline was this? Didn’t Herman fuse with the bloodline of the thorn tree demon? This was a Dragon bloodline, right? What the hell?

It was only then that everyone remembered that they had never seen Eli fight before.

Kratos and Rawls, who was not far away, looked at each other. They hadn’t discovered Herman’s power for more than a hundred years.

“Stop!”

Pabulo was a little shocked as well because the bloodline emanating from Eli’s body seemed to be of a rather high level. Furthermore, his aura seemed to be a little off from first circle.

However, before he could say it, someone had already rushed over to stop him. A second-circle Warlock who was closer had already flown out. He had the bloodline of a demonic Wolf.

However, it was only for a moment before the voice stopped abruptly.

Everyone watched as the second-circle warlock was pierced by the shadow the moment he got close to Eli, and then torn into two halves, flesh and blood flying everywhere.

He was killed in seconds?!

A two-circle warlock was killed in seconds?

He didn’t even have time to react.

Pabulo’s eyes widened, and he doubted his own eyes.

This was a second-circle warlock. Even though he was only in the early stage, the power difference shouldn’t be so large.

As the battle began, Eli’s aura was released, and everyone realized that he was in the second circle, and he seemed to be very strong.

“Second circle?” Kratos blinked his eyes. He had thought that he knew Herman very well, but now he realized that he was terribly wrong.

“He’s really a second-circle warlock. I knew it.” Rawls gritted his teeth as he stared at Eli.

Kratos was speechless.

You also know about it?!

I’m the only one who doesn’t know?!

“But so what if you’re a two-circle warlock? I’m at the limit of second-circle,” Pabulo calmed down once more, and said to Eli.

“I have the bloodline of a third-circle Mountain Giant. It’s one of the best bloodlines on the West Coast. Don’t think that you can talk to me like that just because you killed a weak warlock.” Pabulo walked in step by step.

His body also slowly expanded. Pieces of rocks attached to the surface of his body, increasing his defense. His body also gradually grew to a height of five to six meters.

Although he said he didn’t care, he still silently stacked his defense to the highest.

“Go to hell!” Pabulo let out a furious roar, then jumped towards Eli. The ground also started to shake as the boulders flew at Eli.

In the next second, countless shadows instantly exploded on the rocks.

Eli walked out of the rock and looked at Pabulo. Instantly, the pressure from his bloodline gushed out. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

His eyes were burning.

He charged over once again.
