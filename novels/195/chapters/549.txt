550 A Thousand Years of Waiting!

Outside the world, the two Liches were busy contacting various old fellows!

Eli was unaware of all this because he was currently immersed in his own experiment.

Grassi Land, laboratory.

Eli carefully observed the experiment table in front of him.

On the experiment table, there was a glass cover engraved with a large number of complex runes. A wisp of golden aura floated inside. At the same time, wisps of almost white aura were emitted from the glass cover and drifted towards the golden aura.

The moment they came into contact, the two of them began to fuse. However, it was only for a moment before the two of them quickly separated, and the golden aura weakened bit by bit.

“I failed again.”

Seeing this scene, Eli sighed helplessly.

The experiment in front of him was the fusion of the power of faith and the power of purification. It was one of the main experiments he was currently conducting, but the progress had been slow.

Failure was common.

“However, the two have already begun to come into contact, which means that my idea is not wrong. I just need to continue to improve!” Failure did not defeat Eli. After all, such failures were too common in his past years.

Soon, Eli readjusted some parameters and began the experiment again.

The two powers began to merge again.

However, it was different this time. The golden light and white light fused, but this time, the fusion did not stop. A wisp of faith power and purification power fused further.

“Is it working?” Eli was taken aback. He didn’t seem to have expected this.

But sometimes, experiments were like this. You never knew which came first, failure or surprise.

He stared inside, his eyes gradually turning silver as if he was about to discover something.

Finally, after the Silver Eye was activated to its limit, Eli saw a faint aura like a candle in a storm between the two. It was a ray of holier and purer light, just like…

“Light!” Eli’s eyes lit up as he stared at the ray of light.

However, the light only appeared for a moment before it disappeared before Eli’s eyes.

However, that was no longer important. This was already a huge step forward. As long as he followed this path, he would definitely be able to discover this strange power.

“However, the quality of this wisp of aura feels a little too high. It even surpasses Shadow and Devour.” Eli rubbed his chin in surprise.

Even he did not know what would happen when the two fused. After all, he was only suppressing the black fog because of the two powers.

“Looks like I have to invest more attention and resources.”

Eli immediately decided to pay more attention to this experiment.

Originally, this experiment was not as important as the Gray Mage Tower, but he decided to push it forward.

Speaking of the Mage Tower, it was still under construction, but it was really… The progress was slow.

“After all, it’s too big. Even if only a small part of it is damaged, it will take ten years.” Eli had a headache. He had even temporarily given up on the power system and focused on repairing the weapon system.

He had no choice. He had to handle it bit by bit.

” I won’t be leaving this world anytime soon anyway, so it doesn’t matter if I don’t move. However, having a weapon system is equivalent to having a huge weapon in the sky. Once it’s activated, the effect will be quite explosive. However, if I want to use the weapon system, I definitely have to aim, and the surveillance system also needs to be repaired.

“That’s right. Actually, the external surveillance system might be more important to me. Is that equivalent to a large satellite? This is what I need!” Eli suddenly came to a realization.

What was the point of not being able to aim after the weapon system was repaired?

He had to repair the aiming system first. Anyway, the mage tower seemed to be still intact in this aspect. If the dwarves went all out, they should be able to repair it in a short time. This way, he could have an extra surveillance eye outside the world.

Immediately, Eli took out a silver key.

This thing was not only the activation key of the wizard tower but it could also be connected to the wizard tower.

A mysterious fluctuation spread out, and two figures slowly appeared in front of Eli.

“Sir Ely.”

Wizard Tower’s Sula and Dylan said respectfully.

“Sula, Dylan.” Eli nodded and then directly said his thoughts.

“Of course.” Dylan confirmed Eli’s thoughts and continued, “But my lord, the repair work of the tower is still too much. It is really difficult to continue with the dwarves alone. I think we need more people.”

“More people. There aren’t many people who know alchemy in the Bloodline Tower, and I can’t let humans in for the time being.”Ely replied with a frown.

” Not alchemists, but handymen. They will be responsible for helping with construction. Even if they don’t know much, it’s fine. Some races with rough skin and thick flesh in the green fields are very suitable.” Dylan quickly added.

“Alright then.”

Eli nodded. If that was the case, then it was fine.

He directly waved his hand and told him that there would be a large number of foreign races supporting him later.

“Oh, right, Milord, there is one more thing I feel that I have to tell Milord.” Dylan suddenly spoke as if he had thought of something.

“What is it?” asked Eli.

“Um, my lord, you know that the Mage Tower is located in the half-plane outside the world. It is located between the real and the illusory. We can observe the outside world.

“Recently, there seemed to be many traces of fifth-circle creatures in the outer layer. I even sensed the bloodline aura at several world fragments. It seemed that Warlocks had awakened, and there was also the aura of liches.” Dylan raised his head and reminded him.

Lich? The aura of awakening?

He frowned.

What was a Lich doing in the Outer World?

At this moment, the two forces had just finished their first round of probing. No matter what they wanted to do, it was not the right time. Of course, it was not impossible for the Lich to pass by by chance. There was also the aura of awakening, but Eli still felt that something was wrong.

His brain was working very fast, and one possibility after another formed in his mind.

Soon, an idea emerged in his mind!

“Could it be that the Lich Tower wants to ally with the remaining Warlocks?” Eli felt that this was the most likely possibility, but why? There was a high chance that they were afraid of his black fog law. After all, this thing was quite a counter to them.

This was not a big deal. The main thing was that he could not figure out what the Lich Tower had to offer to attract these people.

Lich transformation? It could be counted as one, but it was not enough.

What else could it be? The possibility of advancing further was unlikely. After all, the Liches lacked resources. After all, they were currently lacking offerings and sacrifices.

However, was this enough for them to betray the humans?

Not enough!

There must be greater benefits.

Eli fell into deep thought, and during this process, Dylan and Sula also cut off contact.

He pondered for three whole days.

Three days later, he suddenly raised his head, and his eyes lit up.

“No matter what, the Lich Tower’s final goal is to destroy the Bloodline Tower. As for the process, I don’t care. As long as their goal is me, there will be an inevitable conflict sooner or later.”

His furrowed brows gradually relaxed.

That’s right!

What was there to think about?

At this moment, he was almost approaching the middle stage of the Thousand Flower Realm. Even if there were really a few Thousand Flowers opponent, he would not be afraid in the slightest!

“We’ll deal with whatever comes our way!”

Eli took a deep breath and immediately walked into the secret world fragment.

If his guess was correct, then he still had a few more years. This might allow him to reach a higher level. Even if he were wrong, then his hard work would not be a loss!

Anyway, he had to make preparations.

He didn’t want to fight a battle of the same level!

As for the experiment, he would think about it later. He had to be cautious first. After all, he could do the experiment anytime!

..

The outside world was calm.

Eli meditated silently in the time world fragment to become stronger while occasionally going out to investigate some information. Under his investigation and Dylan’s secret spying, he indeed found traces of liches and fifth-circle warlocks.

As for the ground, it was calm, as if the Lich Tower had accepted its failure.

However, Eli understood that the Lich Tower was going to be ruthless this time!

He waited quietly!

Just like that, ten years passed.

In the secret realm, Eli had spent 1,300 years.

“So slow?”

In the time fragment, Eli looked at the increasingly damaged environment around him and opened his eyes.

He did not expect that the enemy would give him so much time.

It was too abundant.

“I originally thought that I might need to rely on these people to reach the late-stage Thousand Flower Realm, but now that I’m almost at the late-stage, I’ve gained 7032 flowers, which is almost half as fast as before.” The corner of Eli’s mouth twitched.

The current him was much stronger than he was ten years ago.

Even if the Liches really came, he was not afraid at all.

“Hurry up. I’m still waiting to advance to the peak.”

Unlike his previous nervousness, Eli was now looking forward to it.

However, he knew that he couldn’t rush it. After all, it would take a lot of time to wake up the sleeping Warlocks and persuade them.

Another year passed.

One day, Eli suddenly opened his eyes.

The silver-white eyes pierced through the world fragment and arrived at the outer layer of the Warlock World. Hundreds of figures entered the Warlock World like rain, and their target was the Bloodline Tower!

“They are here!” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Eli stood up and walked towards the teleportation array in the distance.

A great battle was coming.
