52 Coincidence

“No, I have to make a trip!”

Although Hila did not really care about that spot, she had already made up her mind, and now, her spot had been taken away by an unknown scholar. How could she accept that?

The more she thought about it, the angrier she got. Her full chest rose and fell with her breathing.

“No, I’ll go tomorrow morning!” Hila looked outside, and the full moon was already high in the sky. At this time, even if it was the library, there should not be many people.

Hila took a deep breath.

She wanted to see who this clement had.

…

The full moon gradually set, and the sun gradually rose.

The bright golden sun touched the earth, and the cool morning wind swept through every street in Junlin. The city began to come alive.

Eli walked down the street, heading towards the library as usual.

The tramps on both sides of the street were no longer the tramps they used to be, and many of the shops on the street had been replaced.

The people on the road were either walking quickly, taking a leisurely stroll, or worrying about not being able to find work.

‘khorium one’s effects are getting worse and worse. I need to make new plans. It’s a pity that Saleen Metatrin left me with very little information about potions, and there are no other mental power potions. It seems that I can only rely on time to slowly grind it out.’ On the way, Eli thought to himself.

It was true that it was difficult for Eli to concoct a perfect potion, but thankfully, Eli didn’t need to do that. He only needed to concoct one that consumed life force to permanently increase mental power.

However, the only problem was that even though Roland’s trade association had developed a lot, it was still limited to the Empire. The materials were all materials that could be found in the Empire, and Eli had more or less studied these materials, so he did not need them.

Unfortunately, he had no access to other countries.

‘Sigh, forget it. I’ll just take it one step at a time. At most, I’ll just slowly grind it out with time.’ Eli was very relaxed.

In fact, he didn’t need the spiritual force potion.

Although it felt good to quickly increase his spiritual power, he actually cared more about the process.

To a mage, the spiritual force could be transformed into visible power, but in the end, knowledge was the true source of a Sorcerer’s strength.

However, knowledge did not come out of thin air. In addition, the help he had was limited, so he could only use this as the foundation in the notes to continue to extend and expand.

The simplest way was to constantly do various experiments and carry out various investigations.

For example, in the experiment to make khorium one, other than the unexpected success of the potion, Eli learned that the process of making the potion was more important than the final success.

He couldn’t slack off in his studies for even a moment, and he couldn’t stop his experiments for too long either.

As he pondered, he quickly arrived at the library.

It was only when he arrived at the library that he found out that something special had happened today. Scholar Clement was called out early in the morning while Herman went out to play with his fiancée. He told Eli that he had gotten engaged a while ago.

At the time, Eli even saw the girl. She looked average, but she looked very nice.

Eli also observed her for a moment. She was a very clean girl.

In the blink of an eye, that cheeky Herman was also getting married. It could only be said that time passed too quickly.

“Alright, I’ve been slacking off for the whole day!” His teacher and senior had run away, so Eli decided to slack off for the rest of the day.

He went straight to the second floor and opened the door to the teacher’s office.

Then, he went in and lay on the recliner. He began to think about the problems he had encountered in the past few days.

…

On the other side, an exquisite carriage stopped in front of the library. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

A woman got off the carriage. She was wearing a white, elegant long dress with a slender waist. She walked towards the library, and the eyes of the people around her instantly focused on this beautiful lady.

The only thing they regretted was that the woman was still wearing a black gauze hat, which blocked her face.

“This must be a beautiful lady!”

Everyone exclaimed in surprise.

Hila, on the other hand, was already used to such situations, and she walked toward the library.

“Beautiful lady, please come in.” The guard at the door saw Hila and quickly greeted her.

“Do you know where scholar Clement is?” Hila had not been to the library for a long time, and she did not know who scholar clement was.

The guard felt extremely happy at this time, and he stammered, ” beautiful lady, scholar Clement’s office is on the second floor, the one closest to the right side of the corridor.

“Alright, thank you,” Hila said politely before walking into the library.

Perhaps it was because of her beauty, no one stopped her along the way. She went straight to the second floor and arrived at the room that the guard had mentioned.

Hila gently knocked on the door.

…

Upon hearing the knock, eli, who was lying down, stood up immediately.

“teacher, you’ve returned so quickly?” Eli was a little surprised.

His mental power flowed out, and Hila’s image outside the door was reflected in Eli’s consciousness.

It was a woman, and she was very beautiful. He didn’t know her.

“Please enter!” Eli didn’t know who she was either, but he still felt like inviting her in first.

Hila, who was outside the door, heard the sound and gently pushed the door open, walking in.

“What a beautiful woman!” upon seeing the woman, eli was a little surprised too. Such a beautiful woman was rare even in the empire.

‘Is he scholar Clement?’

Hila looked at Eli. Because of the transformation, Eli’s face did not look young, but neither did he look old. Hila estimated that he was around 23 to 28 years old.

As Hila did not know much about clement, she did not know how old he was.

But seeing that ” Clement ” was so young, many thoughts appeared in her mind. The first thought was that he was a descendant of a gilded noble.

In fact, whether it was the library, the cloister, or even the knight academy, there were similar people. They were blessed from their birth.

She started to understand why she had been replaced. It was politics at work.

As such, Hila was very angry right now. If her slot had been given to an old scholar, he might not be so angry, but right now, she was really angry.

However, she still decided to test ” scholar Clement ” first to see how bad his academic ability was.

And from the expression on scholar Clement’s face, he didn’t know her.

“Do you need something?” Eli had a strange look on his face. This woman didn’t say anything the moment she came in. Was there something wrong with her?

” It’s like this. I came to the library recently and had been studying. I have a lot of questions. I heard that you are very knowledgeable, so I want to ask you some questions. May I? ” Hila requested.

Eli thought it was something important, but she just wanted to ask for advice.

Occasionally, he would encounter people from the library who would come to ask for advice. Eli usually wouldn’t stop them since they would only pose simple questions.

It was a pleasure to help others.

“Of course you can,” Eli replied with a smile.

“Thank you so much,” Hila thanked him, and the questions that she should be asking appeared in her mind.
