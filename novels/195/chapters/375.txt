376 Jerre’s Final Stake

Two days passed.

Glen stood in front of the window of the Mage Tower, looking at the distant sky, his eyes eager.

” Eli said it should be within these two days. Why isn’t he here yet? ” These few days could be said to be the most torturous days for Glen. He waited anxiously every day.

Pa, pa, pa!

!!

Suddenly, there was a knock on the door, and the door opened.

Glen turned his head. Only one person dared to knock on his door.

“Grandpa, the people from the Amina family are here. It’s that warlock called Simon again.” Alida walked in and said to Glen.

“Ah, he’s finally here.” Glen was overjoyed and immediately walked out of the room. He did not forget to remind Alida,” Alida, go and call Sir Eli. ” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“Yes!” Alida replied.

…

Half an hour later.

In the conference room.

Eli sat at the head of the table, Glen sat on one side, and Alida stood behind Glen. On the other side of the table was Simon.

“Sir, long time no see!” Simon said humbly to Eli, without the slightest bit of arrogance he had for the first time.

“Yes, what happened to your teeth?” Eli noticed that Simon’s front teeth seemed to have grown shorter, as if they had just grown out.

“I fell!” Simon smiled awkwardly. He couldn’t say that it was Sir Selona who boxed him.

Eli didn’t expose Simon’s lie. He just smiled.

“Sir, these are the resources that we have gathered this time. A total of one million magic crystals. They are mainly related to the various bloodlines that low-level Warlocks need to train, including magic plants to improve their bloodlines, a batch of magic beast bloodlines, and a large number of supplementary resources. This is a new contract.” Simon took out an interspatial ring and a new contract.

The ring was brought to Eli. Eli glanced at it and threw it to Glen. He was in charge of these things.

Glen picked up the ring with trembling hands, filled with emotions.

In the past, they were the ones who gave the resources to the Amina family. Now, they were actually the ones who received them.

This was the first time he had heard of such a thing, let alone seen it before.

As for the agreement… Glen looked at this new treaty, and tears were about to flow out. They really didn’t have to pay any responsibility, and the Amina family had restrictions everywhere.

Moreover, this was a bloodline contract, which was imprinted in the bloodline and almost impossible to violate.

Glen couldn’t imagine under what circumstances Salona had agreed to this contract.

He dripped a drop of his blood on the contract with mixed feelings.

Beside him, Alida took a glance and then looked at Eli with admiration.

She understood that this was all because of Eli.

After signing the contract, Simon took it back and stood up. He said to Eli, “Sir, we have a new piece of news that might interest you! ”

“Oh?” The three of them raised their heads at the same time.

“Jerre seems to be gathering all the celestials under his banner. He even paid a lot of resources to gather three or four wild celestials. There are about ten celestials in total. They are currently in the territory of the Manticore Family. They seem to be discussing how to deal with Lord.” Simon said.

Eli frowned.

In fact, Jerre should have already dealt with it long ago. However, since he had just arrived at the Bloodline Tower, he had many things to deal with and familiarize himself with, so he didn’t pay attention to them.

This guy actually wanted to take the initiative to attack?

Eli took out the Dice of Fate and asked about the possibility of defeating Jerre.

The die flashed again and finally rolled to the 18 positions.

“So dangerous.” Eli sucked in a breath of cold air. It seemed that the quantitative change had really caused a qualitative change.

“What about Nikola and Hydra?” Eli rolled the Dice of Fate again.

20 points.

Eli nodded.

“Thanks, I got it.”

Simon was speechless.

Looking at how calm and collected Ely was, he couldn’t help but wonder, ‘Those were eleven celestials. Even the Amina Family could not guarantee victory.’

However, when he thought about how powerful Eli was that day, Simon felt relieved. He turned around and left.

This time, it was really uncertain who would win!

“My lord.” After Simon left, Glen and Alida looked at Eli worriedly.

Last time, there were only three celestials. This time, including Jerre, there were probably eleven. This number was a little terrifying.

“Glen!” Eli suddenly looked at Glen

“Sir, I’m here,” Glen replied.

” Tell the Warlocks of the Bloodline Tower to keep a close eye on them. If there are any traces of celestials, report it immediately. Also, start gathering the Warlocks of the Bloodline Tower. We’ll be busy from now on. ”

What?

Glen didn’t understand. He could understand if they had to keep a close eye on the surroundings, but why would he gather the warlocks?

Eli glanced at him and explained, “We’ll prepare to take over the territory of the Manticore family.”

….

...

The Manticore Clan.

In front of a huge manticore statue, Jerre looked at the ten celestials in front of him.

Six of them were the celestials of the Manticore family’s subordinate forces, and the other two were wild celestials.

Among them, there were two Radiant Moon Warlocks, three Nebula Warlocks, three Star Warlocks, two Microstar Warlocks, and him, a Radiant Moon Warlock.

There were a total of eleven Warlocks, which was the entire lineup this time.

In order to hire these Warlocks, Jerre had spent half of the Manticore Family’s wealth, so this battle could only be won.

Jerre stood at the front and looked at the Warlocks. “Everyone, our goal this time is very clear. It is to kill all the celestials of the Bloodline Tower. There are four of them in total. The leader is Eli, a Radiant Moon Warlock. Next is an undead, a giant snake, and Glen. These three are all at the micro star level.”

His plan was very simple, and that was the decapitation operation.

As long as they dealt with these celestials, the Bloodline Tower would not be a problem for them.

“Jerre, it seems that the Bloodline Tower has been in contact with the Golden Cicada Chamber of Commerce and the Charm Mansion. Will something unexpected happen?” A Warlock asked.

” These two factions are neutral. There’s no reason for them to intervene. You don’t have to worry about that. ” Jere explained.

...

” That’s not a problem. Sir, when are we leaving? That way, we can come back early!” A Warlock laughed.

“That’s right. Lord Jerre has done a lot this time.” Another Warlock laughed.

No one was nervous. After all, there were eleven celestials and three Radiant Moons.

Although the Bloodline Tower was much stronger than before, it was still far from enough.

“Since everyone is waiting anxiously, let’s set off now.” Jerre also smiled.

The Warlocks nodded.

In the next second, Jerre flew into the sky and turned into a dark green pillar of air, flying into the distance.

The other Warlocks also rose into the sky and followed.

Eleven traces of bloodline power arced through the sky.

There was no concealment.

The target.

Bloodline Tower.
