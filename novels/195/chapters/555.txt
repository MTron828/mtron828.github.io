556 Lich’s Betrayal, Trapped David

Crack!

The smooth mirror slowly dissipated, turning into thousands of spiritual light spots.

In the castle, the cold Soul Fire burned in the cold wind. Although they were not afraid of the cold, at this moment, all the Liches felt a chill in their hearts.

“How is this possible? How can he be so strong?” The Lich’s voice trembled, and his body trembled even more.

“We underestimated his strength, far from it!” The Bone Dragon Lich also had a bitter expression on its face as it spoke in a low voice.

The strength displayed by Eli was too shocking. It was already on a completely different level from the Warlock Alliance. There was no comparison, which was why those Warlocks were easily killed by Eli.

But how could Eli be so strong? How could he…

They gritted their teeth, feeling a little lost and helpless.

They were at a loss because of Eli’s strength. They were at a loss because Eli was so powerful and had the means to restrain them. Could they really defeat Eli and end the Bloodline Alliance?

No, they didn’t have to solve the Bloodline Tower’s problem now. It was just that the Bloodline Tower would attack them sooner or later. By then, would they be able to stop it?

“Milord, what should we do next?” The Calamity Lich looked up at the Lich King, who had been silent all this while. Everyone also looked up at the front, the current Lich Leader.

At this moment, the Lich King’s eyes became clearer, as if he had recalled something.

After a few seconds of silence, he looked at everyone and slowly said, “Ten years from now, after digesting the previous wave of power, we will gather our strength and launch a general attack on the Warlock Alliance!”

A general attack?

The Liches trembled as they looked at him in disbelief.

“Sir, we might not be a match for the Bloodline Alliance now. It’s not appropriate to start a war.” A Lich retorted.

“Indeed, why don’t we make peace and wait for us to develop?”

“Too impulsive!”

Many Liches expressed their opinions. The Bone Dragon Lich and the Calamity Lich were also thinking about something, but their expressions showed that they were unwilling to start a war.

However, the Lich King didn’t seem to care about them. He said calmly, “Ten years later, we will start a war.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he stood up and walked toward the back of the castle without caring about the others, leaving the Liches looking at each other.

After a few seconds of silence, the Lich looked at everyone and said, “Since the lord has said so, then let’s carry it out. Everyone, disperse first.”

Many Liches had ugly expressions on their faces, but they also stood up and left the castle!

The Calamity Lich also left the castle after taking a glance at the castle in the darkness.

Then, the door slowly closed.

However, he didn’t return to his own territory after he left. Instead, he looked around and came to a place where the cold wind whistled. There was an ice mountain standing there, and under the ice mountain, a huge figure was already waiting for him.

“Bone Dragon!” The Calamity Lich looked at the figure and said.

“It’s me.” The Bone Dragon Lich slowly walked out of the snow and nodded.

“So, what do you want me to do?” The Lich frowned and asked.

Just before he left, this guy suddenly sent him a message.

“Do you want to die?” The Bone Dragon Lich suddenly asked.

Calamity Lich, “???”

He instantly became cautious, and the cold flames around his body burned.

“Don’t be nervous. I’m just telling you one thing.” The Bone Dragon Lich looked at his old friend and said seriously, “As you know, we were all found by him in the past hundred years and turned into liches.

“Before that, Milord had already transformed into a Lich for an unknown period of time. We were all very clear about the aftereffects of transforming into a Lich. Our souls would gradually degenerate. I had only transformed for a hundred years, but I felt more and more that I was no longer myself. One could imagine Milord’s current situation.

“However, my goal was to live a little longer. If I were to fight against Eli, it would definitely be very tragic. Not necessarily, but there was a very high possibility that we would die. To be honest, I don’t want to fight Eli.”

“I naturally don’t want to!” The Lich frowned and asked, “Then what do you mean now? We signed a contract back then, and there’s no way to change that.”

This time, he didn’t answer. Instead, he changed the topic and said, “The lord is a madman. He only wants to complete his great cause and purify this world to its former state. I once sneaked into his room and read a part of his diary. I learned that he was actually a Mage!” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“A mage?” The Lich was stunned.

The Lich King was once a mage. This was really big news.

“Yes.” The skeletal dragon nodded and continued,” He used to be a mage, but his life was miserable. He was almost captured and attacked by warlocks.

“However, by chance, he entered a world fragment in the outside world. I don’t know what he discovered inside, but after that, the lich line was born!”

“What are you trying to say?” At this moment, the Calamity Lich was completely confused!

” What I want to say is,” the Bone Dragon Lich said.” My lord’s dream is for the world to return to the era of mages and the era of everyone living in harmony.

“That’s why he’s casting Lich spells without any scruples. But do you think we Liches are mages?”

He looked up at the Lich of Calamity, who shook his head and said, “No, we can only be considered half mages at most. After all, liches are almost not the same species as humans.”

“Yes!” The Bone Dragon Lich nodded and said,” That’s true. This is a contradiction. The world can never return to how it was before. Besides, Liches can’t reproduce, so Master’s idea is just a delusion. However, he has been a Lich for too long, so even he might not know what he’s doing now.

“He is a paranoid, a dreamer who has taken the wrong path!”

At that moment, he bluntly expressed his opinion of David.

“So…” The Lich of Calamity narrowed his eyes.

“We’re rebelling.” At this moment, the Bone Dragon Lich no longer concealed himself and took out two feathers. “These are two feathers of the Nefarious Filthbird. I obtained them from the Warlock Alliance. They can help us remove the curse.

“Since David is a lunatic, why don’t we replace him and devour the Liches? That way, our strength will be unprecedented. Then, we’ll get rid of Eli and find a chance to leave this world!”

Hiss!

The Calamity Lich gasped.

In the end, wasn’t it just backstabbing? They would use the entire Lich Tower as resources for the two of them to advance, then deal with Eli and the Lich King, and finally leave this world.

However, if they devoured all the Liches, their strength would soar. Even Eli would not be their match. Everything would be within their grasp.

He fell silent, lost in thought.

The Bone Dragon Lich was also waiting quietly at the side, not saying anything.

After a long while, the Lich slowly raised his head and looked at him. “Alright, I agree!”

The Bone Dragon Lich revealed a smile!

..

At that moment, David, who was far away in the castle, slowly opened his eyes and said, “David, so Eli is your teacher. Interesting, interesting. But he’s still alive. This person definitely has secrets!”

“No, you can’t…”

Another voice came from his body, and his soul fire trembled.

The Lich King felt as if his body was out of control. In an instant, a black shadow-like aura spread out from his body. Only then did he calm down, and the voice stopped.

” Everything is going according to plan. Everything is going according to plan except for the problem with Eli. However, it’s not a big problem.

“You were the one who controlled the situation before, but I’ll do it from now on. You should sleep for a while.” He shook his head and walked deeper into the castle.

Outside the castle.

The cold wind howled and never stopped!
