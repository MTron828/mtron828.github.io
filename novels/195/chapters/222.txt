223 Crushing Defeat

“Who are you?”

Trembling, Vivika looked at Eli and spat out a few words.

“We’ll talk about my business later. Let’s get rid of the outsider first.” Eli didn’t answer but instead looked into the mountains in the distance, his gaze calm.

The smoke had slowly dissipated, revealing the current state of the mountain.

A huge cylindrical pit had appeared on the originally steep mountain wall, surrounded by collapsed mountain rocks. They were piled up in the pit and buried Kloss.

However, he did not die.

Suddenly, a gurgling sound could be heard. The originally Black Mountain rock slowly turned red, then crimson red, and finally, it seemed to have turned into liquid. Then, Kloss slowly crawled out from inside.

However, compared to before, he was now in a much more miserable state. Many parts of his body were entangled by shadows, and a large number of flames were constantly being extinguished. His right hand had already disappeared, and his left hand was covering his chest. There was no longer a black mark.

“Who are you?!”

Kloss suppressed his anger and asked Eli with a beast-like voice.

“Didn’t you put me on the wanted list? How come you don’t even recognize me?” Eli smiled. He was using Roland’s face at the moment.

Locks, “…”

He had never seen this person before.

However, he had posted a wanted hit on Herman.

Could this person be Herman?

“Are you Herman?” Kloss asked, frowning.

“yes, yes. You might be more familiar with this face.” Eli smiled, and his appearance gradually changed into Herman’s.

Upon seeing this face, Kloss no longer had any doubts, but looking at Eli, he felt a faint chill.

Another third-circle warlock!

Didn’t they say that the South didn’t have any advancement knowledge? Why did a new third-circle warlock appear? this made him extremely sullen.

“My Lord,” At this time, Nikola also slowly stood up.

Question marks were written all over his face again.

“You guys are working together?” Kloss was stunned again.

“So that’s how it is!” Realization dawned on him. He slowly stood up and walked out of the mountain that was more than ten meters deep. His right hand gradually turned into a flaming hand.

“I was too careless this time and let you succeed in your sneak attack. However, you’re just another third-circle early-stage warlock. Even if I’m injured, it’s enough to kill you!” Kloss’ gaze was fierce. These people had given him too many “surprises” today.

As for the black light pillar just now, it was true that he was severely injured, but he thought that it was the result of accumulating power for a long time. Otherwise, how could a three-circle early-stage warlock possibly burst out with that kind of power?

“Come, let me see how long you can last!”

The flames around Kloss’ body twined again, and his aura was powerful.

Eli just smiled, and the eight black balls slowly appeared before him again, and the shadows gathered once more.

Kloss’ smile froze.

Kloss quickly retreated, but Eli had already made his move. In an instant, eight balls flew towards Klosss, like a net, enveloping him. Then, there was another loud explosion.

“This …”Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Vivika covered her ears. Even without getting close, she could feel the power contained in it. But what she didn’t expect was that the person in front of her was Herman. The master of the White Tower.

She was unfamiliar with Herman’s face, but why did she feel that he was somewhat familiar?

For a moment, she couldn’t tell.

“As expected of Master!” Nikola, on the other hand, smiled.

Although Eli has just advanced to the third ring, his combat power is no weaker than Kloss’.

“F * ck!”

On the other side, Kloss, who was tormented by the shadow explosion, emerged from the shadows in a sorry state. He looked at Eli who was not far away, and the flames on his body extinguished the shadow.

“I knew that Herman had a shadow-type bloodline, but I didn’t expect you to be at the third circle. Unfortunately, fire elemental spirits are very effective against shadows, undead, and darkness.” Kloss said with relief.

Eli laughed. Kloss was happy too soon.

In the next second, water dragons that were over ten meters long appeared beside him, splashing water in the air. They roared at Kloss, not hiding their malice at all.

The 3rd Circle spell, water Dragon’s death. It was a 3rd Circle water spell that Eli had specially learned over the past few days, and it could already be used in actual combat.

“What is this?”

Kloss blinked.

This situation didn’t seem to be what he had imagined!

However, at this moment, more than a dozen water dragons were roaring and flying over. Kloss could only control his flames to fight, which made everything even more difficult. What frightened him was that in the gaps in the valley, formations lit up again.

50!

With a total of 50 spell formations, Kloss was heavily suppressed.

More than a dozen water dragons surrounded locks, occasionally launching a fierce attack at him. Whenever damage was caused, Eli would immediately repair it with a few more water dragons. This caused Kloss to feel a sense of despair.

“Why are there still so many spell formations?!” Kloss gritted his teeth.

He had never thought that there would be more than a hundred spell formations set up in this small valley. This was not something that a normal person could do.

And Herman had tricked them. Not only did he have a shadow bloodline, but he was also a mage. He was a cunning person.

“Herman!!

“you’re courting death!” Kloss bellowed, and his bloodline burst forth instantly. Countless flames surged out of his body, and fire elemental spirits appeared one after another, flying toward the Water Dragon. As for him, he flew towards Eli.

It would be fine as long as Herman was dealt with.

Bang! Bang!

However, to his surprise, scales appeared on Eli’s body first, completing his bloodline transformation. Then, dozens of shields appeared around him, tightly wrapping him up.

Kloss’ mouth twitched as he watched. It couldn’t be.

What made him even more desperate was that Eli was faster than him. Not only was he unable to catch up to Herman, but interestingly enough, his long-range attacks couldn’t even break through Herman’s defense.

Pfft!

Finally, a minute later, he stopped his pursuit and panted heavily.

The ambush had failed.

And at this moment, Eli had already summoned a dozen water dragons again and attacked him. There were even a few shadow attacks mixed in. Kloss was dumbfounded.

Just like that, a new round of attacks began.

Three minutes passed quickly, and Kloss took a deep breath.

He knew that he couldn’t continue like this.

He stretched out his hand and took out a fiery red pill from his body. This was a blood-burning pill used to burn the power of one’s bloodline and unleash the last of one’s strength.

“Herman, you forced me to do this!” Locks looked at Eli, his eyes filled with determination, and then he was about to put the medicine into his mouth.

However, before he could do so, he suddenly felt a mysterious aura appear outside his body. At the same time, the blood in his body began to go berserk. He felt as if his body had frozen in an instant!

Not far away, Eli was looking at him with a smile, a wisp of breath wrapped around his fingertips.

A curse?

Locks understood. This was the curse that dark Mages were best at!

The curse seemed to be strong!

However, this was no longer important. During his moment of stiffness, dozens of elemental attacks had already locked onto him. A dozen water dragons also raised their heads and stared at him, baring their fangs!

“I’m done!”

Kloss looked at the medicine in front of him and silently closed his eyes. A brief moment of stiffness was enough to change everything. Furthermore, there were more than a hundred spell formations and curses. How could he fight against them?

Not to mention fighting, he hadn’t even touched Eli yet.

“So this is a well-prepared Mage? No, he seems to be a Warlock. What is he?” The moment locks closed his eyes, many thoughts ran through his mind, but his greatest thought for Eli was …

He was clearly very strong, but how could he be so patient?

He only made his move at the end!

He sighed, and in the next second, his entire body melted by a large number of elemental attacks.

Looking at the beautiful fireworks-like scene in the sky not far away, Vivika stood in a daze. It turned out that Nikola really did not lie to her. His master was really strong.

However, she did not expect this person to be a mage!

At this moment, Eli, who was not far away, slowly dispersed his shield and walked over.

“Who are you?” Vivika stared at Eli and questioned him.

“What’s wrong? Aren’t you going to give me a hug?”

Eli slowly approached Vivika, and the faceless one’s mask slowly disappeared. He took off the mask and revealed his original appearance. His figure also slowly recovered, and then he reached out his hands!

“Teacher!”

Vivika was stunned!
