242 Making Good Friends

“It’s you!”

Jin Ji’s eyes widened as he looked at the young man in front of him. This young man was the other guard who had stopped him earlier!

“Yes, it’s me!” The man smiled and glanced at Jin Ji. When he saw the Golden potion on Jin Ji’s waist, his eyebrows immediately rose!

“How about it? hand over the potion, and I’ll let you go!” The man slowly approached, and the other two apprentices also slowly approached.

“I was too careless!” Jin Ji gritted his teeth. He didn’t expect to encounter such a thing.

It was impossible for him to hand the blood over. Even if he did, they would not let him go. However, there was one thing that he could not understand!

“The Golden cicada potion is the exclusive bloodline of the Golden cicada Chamber of Commerce. It’s strictly forbidden to spread it to outsiders, and every single one of them has a serial number. Even if you take it away, you won’t dare to use it. Even if you sell it, no one will dare to buy it. Do you think there’s any point in that? ” Jin Ji clenched his fists tightly, his body trembling.

“hehe, of course, it’s meaningless!” The man smiled, but his face gradually twisted. The way he looked at Jin Ji also became more and more twisted, and he said fiercely, “But so what?”

“If I have to watch you advance to the next circle, I’ll be so upset that I’ll die. I might as well kill you now!”

The man revealed his white teeth, but his expression was twisted like a demon.

Jin Ji, “…”

The man, however, taught him a lesson. He had never thought that, as colleagues, there would be someone who could be so vicious and do such a thing that harmed others without benefiting himself.

It was really vile!

“forget it. I’ve finally told you the reason. It seems that I’m still a reasonable person.” The man stretched his body and gave the other two a look.

The two of them nodded and approached Jin Ji, but they looked at the man with disgust.

They were only hired by the man. Although they were doing the work of mercenaries, they did feel uncomfortable today. It was so disgusting! Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

But since they were paid, the two could only sigh and look at Jin Ji.

The battle began!

Both of them were at the limit of the zero circle, and so was Jin Ji. However, the two of them cooperated very well, but Jin Ji’s combat power was unexpectedly good. He could barely hold on.

The man took a look and then joined in.

The situation of the battle changed in an instant. In a short while, Jin Ji was suppressed.

Ten minutes later, Jin Ji was held up in the air by two skinny warlocks, his entire body covered in blood. The guard slowly walked up to Jin Ji and took out his potion.

“What a beautiful color!” He was fiddling with the potions in front of Jin Ji.

“You should die!” Jin Ji’s eyes were about to pop out.

The next second, the potion fell to the ground and shattered. Golden blood flowed out and slowly fused into the ground in a few seconds.

“No more!” The man laughed as he looked at Jin Ji with a wild smile.

Jin Ji’s face was ashen as he looked at this scene!

“The potion is gone, and the next thing to do is to kill you!” The man slowly approached Jin Ji’s face and said fiercely.

“Why don’t we just forget about it? this isn’t very good!” The Warlocks hired by the man couldn’t bear to watch any longer.

How disgusting.

“I’ve already paid. Do you want to breach the contract?” The man cast aside their conversation, and they immediately stopped talking.

“If there’s a next life, I’ll definitely kill you!” But to his surprise, Jin Ji didn’t beg for mercy. Instead, his face became even more ferocious, like a burning flame.

“Oh, oh, oh, that’s really scary!”

The man smiled, then grabbed Jin Ji’s neck and slowly exerted force.

Gah gah gah!

It made it hard for Jin Ji to breathe. At the same time, he lost control of his body’s functions, and the shadow of death tightly wrapped around him.

“I’m going to die!” Jin Ji gave up struggling! “This damn fate!”

But in his mind, there was no desire for life but the injustice of fate. Why did he have to be like this? When his family was destroyed, he fled all the way. When he came here, he worked hard to become stronger, but in the end, this was the end result.

He was unwilling to accept this!

However, everything in front of him turned white, and Jin Ji slowly fell into the abyss.

Death had arrived.

After a few minutes, he slowly opened his eyes.

He saw a dark alley, but in his sight, a man was holding a bottle of medicine and looking down at him with a smile.

“Sir Herman!” At first, Jin Ji was surprised that he wasn’t dead, but then he immediately realized who this man was. It was his benefactor, Sir Herman.

“You’re awake!” Eli looked at him and retracted the bottle of medicine with his right hand.

Jin Ji was dumbfounded. He sat up and looked around. Not far away, the three people from before were sitting together. He looked at himself and saw that there was no wound on him, but the potion fragments in front of him told him that everything was real.

He’s dead? But he was alive again?

“I gave you a fifth circle mother of life potion, which I got by chance in ruins. It seems that you’ve been saved!” Eli said slowly to him with a smile.

“Five-circle? The mother of life?”

Jin Ji was stunned. He looked at the potion bottle in Eli’s hand. It was indeed emitting an extremely pure life force, and it was of a very high level, but it was empty.

“You saved me, my Lord?” Jin ji still felt a little confused, so he looked at Eli.

“What do you think?” Eli smiled.

Jin Ji was stunned. He recalled the cold feeling just now. It couldn’t be fake. The fatal feeling just now was also very real. The broken potion bottles on the ground also showed that everything was real.

“It’s true!” Jin ji looked at Eli, his throat moving.

...

“my Lord, why did you save me? It’s such a precious potion!”

He didn’t understand why someone would use a precious five-circle potion to save him. Five-circle potions were almost extinct in the world, and no one could make them.

“ah, looking at you reminds me of my past self. At that time, I also encountered many difficulties. I just happened to pass by, but your words still touched me, so I saved you!” Eli sighed as if he had returned to his younger days.

Jin Ji was stunned. In an instant, gratitude and emotions filled his mind. After his family was destroyed, no one treated him so well.

On the other side, Eli sighed at the scene.

The five-circle potion and the tough past were all fake. That part was an illusion. The assault from the two mercenaries and the other guard was real. As for why he made up this story, he had his own reasons.

A child of destiny was worthy of such treatment from Eli.

He was only making an investment for the future.

“I can’t repay your kindness in this life!” At this moment, Jin Ji’s eyes were filled with tears, and he knelt on the ground.

“Haha, it’s fine. Get up.” Eli smiled and helped him up. He looked at the bloodline potion not far away and asked, “What are you going to do with the potion?”

“If it’s gone, then it’s gone. I’ll save more. At least I’m still alive.”

...

Jin Ji gritted his teeth. He didn’t know when he would have enough magic stones again.

“Haha, I’ll help you to the end. This is for you!” Ere smiled and threw a small bag at Jin Ji!

Jin Ji took the bag and was a little dumbfounded.

He opened the bag. There were a high-ranked magic stone and a metal die!

“This is …” Jin Ji was stunned and looked up.

The Eli in front of him had disappeared without him knowing.

“A little investment and something that can give you a direction when you need it!” Eli left, but his voice entered his brain.

Jin Ji knelt on the ground, looking at the magic stone and the mysterious die.

A few seconds later, he slammed his head on the ground with a loud thud.

After that, he stood up and was about to leave. However, after taking a few steps, he turned back and looked at the three people not far away. He took a deep breath and walked over.

He had to thank his colleagues for giving him a lesson.

He had benefited for life from this lesson.

From this day on, he would not trust anyone else except the Lord, who gave him a second Life.

“After I get my revenge, my life will be Master’s!” Jin Ji took out a small knife from his clothes and ended the Guard’s life in one strike, then quickly left.
