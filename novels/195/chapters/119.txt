120 Eli’s Departure

The battle on the ground was intense, and below the ground, Eli was waiting anxiously.

Eli was at the bottom of the prison, and from time to time, he could hear intense explosions coming from the outside world. The terrifying elemental fluctuations caused the entire prison to tremble from time to time. They were just two weakened versions of celestials, but their power was still beyond Eli’s imagination.

Time slowly passed.

Eli waited anxiously, and after about three hours, the ground gradually fell silent.

“Who won? What’s going on? ” hearing that there was no movement outside, Eli asked.

!!

Just as he was about to go out and check, suddenly, Eli felt the space around him change again. His eyes widened, and the next second, he was teleported away again.

When he came to his senses, Eli had appeared in the castle again.

However, the castle had long disappeared without a trace, leaving only a ground full of gravel. The area within a few hundred meters was also in ruins. The soil was tumbling, and the earth was cracked. It looked extremely miserable.

At the moment, Eli was standing on the ruins of the castle, and beneath his feet were large pieces of broken rocks. In the distant sky, Nick’s figure was already extremely illusory, and on the ground not too far away from him, a shadow was bound by who knew how many chains.

The demonic Dragon was in an extremely miserable state. Half of its right wing had disappeared, and most of its black scales had been shattered. One of its eyes was also black, while the other was tightly shut. More than ten chains had pierced through its body, trapping it on the ground.

Without a doubt, the demonic Dragon had lost.

“Ahem, Eli.” In the sky, Nick slowly descended. His figure flickered as if he was about to collapse.

“Celestial sorcerer.” Eli immediately walked over.

“I’ve lost!”

Nick’s first sentence numbed Eli a little.

???

What about the mystic Dragon lying on the ground?

As if he knew what Eli was thinking, Nick shot him a glance and said, “we’ve both suffered heavy losses. I’ve used my energy grid line chains to trap him temporarily. But, the moment I dissipate, he’ll be able to escape. I don’t have much time left.

“I’m sorry, but I can’t give you this secret plane. You have five days to escape. I can hold on for another five days. After five days, the energy grid line chains will lose their support and disappear instantly. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“I’ve underestimated him this time.”

Eli coughed. This turn of events had happened too quickly. One second, he was still happily preparing to receive the inheritance and arcane realm, and the next second, he had to leave this place and escape.

“I won’t let him run away. I’ve already memorized his smell. When I get out of here, I’ll catch him immediately and kill him. Your inheritance will end here.” Suddenly, the shadow Dragon in the distance opened his only remaining eye and glared at Nick.

“I’m sorry!” Upon hearing this, Nick turned to face Eli and apologized.

This time, it was his mistake.

“Oh, right. Do you still have magic crystals? If you have magic stones, you can leave some here to sustain the chain for a while longer.” Nick asked.

“I don’t have any!” Eli shook his head in embarrassment.

If there were magic stones here, they would have been excavated by Magi long ago.

“That’s true.” Nick fell into silence. After a while, he spoke again, “I’m sorry,” he said.

Nick apologized again, but Eli wasn’t in the mood to think about that right now. He was about to face a four-circle Shadow Dragon that had recovered. How could he possibly run away?

He had to think of other ways.

Did Nick just mention the magic stone?

Wait a minute. The magic stone didn’t have much magic power. Could it be enough to trap the shadow Dragon? He immediately raised his head and asked Nick, “Is the magic stone enough to maintain this chain?”

“Of course. After all, it’s the chain of rules that traps the dragon and not the stone. As long as there is mana support, the chain will be there.” Nick explained, but his heart was filled with sorrow.

Because of his mistake back then, the inheritor that he had found with great difficulty was about to die.

All the melancholy turned into a sigh.

On the other hand, Eli’s eyes lit up when he heard Nick’s words, and he hurriedly asked, ” Sir, then I’ll stay here and come in once a day, injecting some mana into the chains every day.”

“Nonsense,” Nick cast a glance at Eli and continued, ” I used the power of rules in the secret realm to trap the dragon. You can leave while I’m still here, but once I’m gone that’s not going to work. You’ll have to stay here until the dragon dies, or you die.

“Although this Shadow Dragon doesn’t have long to live, he can survive easily for another one or two hundred years. Although the secret plane will slightly reduce the consumption of life force, a normal first circle Magus will definitely not be able to survive longer than the dragon.”

Nick’s tone was getting lower and lower, but on the other side, Eli clenched his fist.

A hundred years!

It was impossible for a normal mage to survive because an ordinary first circle mage could only live for 200 years. In the mage world where life force was quickly consumed, they could only live up to 140 years old.

It was impossible for a normal mage to defeat a Shadow Dragon.

But it was different for Eli. If his life was guaranteed to be safe just by staying here for a hundred years, it wouldn’t be a loss for him at all. It was only a hundred years anyway.

“Sir, I think I should stay here. After all, I can’t escape. I might as well stay here and live a little longer.” Eli lied.

“Alright,” he said. Nick glanced at him and sighed.

It was all his fault.

“But I want to go out and bring my things in,” Eli said.

“Take this. This is the vessel for the secret realm. Within five days, you can use this to come back to the secret realm.” Nick handed a black ring to him, and he took a look before putting it on.

Eli nodded.

The next second, he was transported out of the secret realm.

The dragon closed his eyes in disdain.

He could just endure it.

The shadow Dragon was a famous long-lived species in the endless world.

…

At this moment.

In the valley.

Vivika and David were waiting in the valley with anxious looks on their faces.

It had been three hours since they were teleported out, but there was still no movement from their teacher. The bronze door had also disappeared.

“David, do you think something happened to teacher? ” Asked Vivika worriedly.

“I don’t know,” David sighed.

Just as the two of them were lamenting, the space in front of them suddenly fluctuated, and a figure appeared from the void.

“Teacher!”

Vivika and David were pleasantly surprised and immediately walked forward.

Meanwhile, Eli shook his slightly dizzy head, looked at the two of them, and said, “I’m going back to Junlin immediately. I’ll take my leave first.”

And so, under their dazed gazes, the wind element under Eli’s feet surged, and he left.

He only had five days, and he had no time to waste.

The first thing that Eli did after returning to Junlin was to head to the palace.

As for Anna, who was in the middle of an important diplomatic communication, she was interrupted and called away by Eli.

“Prepare these materials for me, the more, the better, and then send them to Leighton Manor.” In the room, Eli immediately gave Anna a list.

There were limited materials in the arcane realm, so Eli needed a lot of materials and substances to ensure that he could use them for a hundred years. Oh, he also had to bring some seeds or something, or he would starve to death in the arcane realm.

“Teacher, did something happen?” Anna asked.

She remembered that her teacher should have gone to explore a secret realm. Why did he come back?

“it’s nothing. It’s just that I might have to go on a long journey,” Eli touched Anna’s head and sighed.

He had watched Anna grow up since she was a child, and now that he had to leave, Eli’s feelings were complicated.

The next time he came out, things would probably change already.

“Travel?” Anna was a little confused. Even if it was a long journey, was there a need to be so depressed?

Even if he had to travel for a long time, it couldn’t be longer than his teacher’s last trip, which had been twelve years.

“Help me collect these things first. Remember, collect as much as you can. There’s no limit. I’ll return to the manor first.” Eli said again and left quickly.

Watching Eli’s departing figure, Anna blinked and began to call out.

“Men!”

…

On the other hand, after returning to the manor, Eli also began to organize his items.

Experimental equipment, experimental materials, magic plants that had been planted, the important blood bamboo flower, some backup of magical beast blood, and flower pots for planting seeds.

Eli directly threw everything into the arcane realm.

On the other side, under Anna’s order, carts of materials began to be sent to Leighton Manor without stopping, and the materials piled up into small mountains.

And this was with the manor’s geographical limitations, otherwise, the manor would have been filled with stuff. At this moment, Eli was extremely grateful that he still had the Empire to operate. Otherwise, where would he find so many materials at this time?

The trucks of Leighton Manor did not stop for a whole day and a half.

Eli also kept sending the resource into the arcane realm.

At this time, there were still three hours left before the five days were up.

In the manor, Eli touched Anna’s head and said, “I can’t help you in the future. I might be away for a long time. I’ve left you a process to make those bloodline Knights. It’s all in here. You may need to study it.”

“Teacher, are you really leaving?” There were tears in the corner of Anna’s eyes. She had a faint feeling that they would not have a chance to meet again after this departure.

“Yes.” Eli gave Anna a hug.

He had stayed in Junlin for about a hundred years, and this time, he would be leaving for almost a hundred years.

After a hundred years, there would really be nothing left.

“Take care of yourself,” Eli said one last time.

In the next two hours, Eli continued to send things into the arcane realm, making sure that everything he needed was there. The only pity was that David hadn’t returned yet, and Eli hadn’t gotten the chance to study his ability rune, but it didn’t matter anymore.

The last hour.

Eli quickly scanned his surroundings around Jun Lin and finally returned to the manor.

In the study, Eli glanced at the land outside for the last time and said calmly, “Goodbye, Junlin.”

In the next second, Eli disappeared.
