245 Desperation

“The silver Moon banquet!”

Jin Ji looked at the noisy Silver Moon Lake in the distance with a smile.

Unlike before, his identity had completely changed. After meeting the West Coast Chairman of the Golden cicada Chamber of Commerce, he was recognized by the chairman and accepted as a student.

Although he was only a first-ring warlock, his status in the Golden cicada Chamber of Commerce was quite high.

He had returned to this place to find Sir Herman and thank him!

“He should be there!” He walked around the corner and asked for Herman’s location.

But the next second, he only saw a figure flash before his eyes.

“Sir Herman!”

He was stunned when he saw the figure in front of him.

Then, before he could react, he felt the clothes behind him tighten, and his entire body was lifted up. When he came back to his senses, he was already at the riverbank.

“My Lord!” Jin Ji was stunned as he looked at Eli.

“I have something to do. Help me fish for a day. I want the element’s heart. Help me catch a few more!” Eli patted jin ji’s shoulder.

In this game of luck, there was no doubt that jin ji was number one in this town. Perhaps he was also the number one on the West Coast. Wasn’t he the most suitable candidate?

“My Lord, I don’t know how to fish!”

Jin Ji was still dizzy.

“It’s okay, I believe you.” Eli patted him on the shoulder, then quickly moved out of the crowd. He then turned into a bloody light and flew out of the town.

That speed was much faster than an ordinary third circle warlock. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

But at this moment, Jin Ji just looked at the fishing rods around him in a daze. His throat moved slightly. Didn’t he come to thank him? How did it become fishing?

But … If it’s Eli’s request, then let’s go fishing.

“The element’s heart?”

Jin Ji picked up the fishing rod and looked toward the silver Moon Lake with a serious expression.

“Hehe, the element’s heart?”

“Are you two acting?”

The people next to them had just finished listening to the conversation between the two and laughed. “Do you really think that the elemental heart is easy to catch? Do you think that a fish that had not been caught for hundreds of years was a joke?”

After a few mocking words, everyone retracted their gazes!

But suddenly, a cry of surprise rang out.

Everyone turned their heads to look. At this moment, jin ji was tightly holding onto the fishing rod. With a bang, a fish with a rainbow-colored light glided across the air, emitting a unique color.

The unique color instantly attracted everyone’s attention.

All the fishermen looked over and were dumbfounded by the dazzling color.

“The element’s heart!”

Old John, who was beside Jin Ji, opened his mouth wide. The mouths of the people around him twitched as well.

Was it really that heaven-defying?

What made them stunned was that Jin Ji kept the fish and continued to fish with a calm expression. He was still muttering the words Eli had told him, “Let’s catch a few more!”

Everyone sucked in a breath of cold air and watched this scene quietly.

If someone could see fate, they would see that the cicada made of fate behind Jin Ji also stuck out its tongue as if it was fishing.

..

Whoosh!

The sound of something breaking through the air came from the side. Vivika turned her head and looked. A wind blade swept past her and flew toward the ground. In the blink of an eye, dozens of trees were directly cut off!

“Damn it!”

Vivika flapped her wind wings and looked up.

At this time, the sky and the surroundings had been surrounded by a barrier. The entire ruin was in a sealed state. No, it was not a ruin at all. It was a ruin in disguise.

When they entered the ruins yesterday, everything was normal at first. They took care of some mechanical objects and discovered some mechanical-type things. However, as they went deeper, the person in charge of the heart of the night suggested that they split up.

The other forces all nodded in agreement and then split up.

However, they didn’t know that this was all part of their scheme. As they scattered, a few forces led by the heart of darkness took action directly, sealing the ruins and killing them at the same time!

Vivika was also being chased by several people.

With that in mind, she turned her head and saw two people in the sky not far away, a man and a woman. The man had third circle and was from the heart of the darkness. The woman had third circle and was from the heart of thorns!

“Vivika, just surrender. As long as you join us, we won’t kill you!” The male Warlock from the heart of darkness shouted at Vivika arrogantly.

“Such a beautiful lady. I wonder what it feels like to cut open your skin with thorns!” The female Warlock laughed as her body was covered in thorns.

“the heart of darkness has already violated the West Coast treaty. You are disrespecting your oath!” Vivika looked at the two of them and gritted her teeth.

“An oath? Hahaha!”

The warlock laughed after hearing this, but his face slowly darkened.”What oath? It’s just an agreement we made when we came here together. At that time, we weren’t familiar with this place, so it was just an expedient measure.

“However, a few hundred years have already passed, and there hasn’t been much progress. We have already run out of patience. Rather than slowly grinding away, it’s better to cut the knot and let us take over everything.

“Even if there’s nothing, we’ll just accept it!

“as for your bloodline tower, it’s only in the third circle, but because of the Treaty, it takes up such a large piece of land. Don’t you think it’s too inappropriate? ” At this moment, his eyes had already turned black, and his sharp claws extended. This was the night demonic Wolf bloodline that belonged to the heart of darkness.

...

“If that’s the case, we can give up part of our territory!” Vivika said.

“hehe, that’s no longer important. The West Coast is a small place, and there’s no need for so many forces. Just one of us or the Alliance is enough!” The man shook his head.

“Die or submit, your choice.” The two of them looked at Vivika and smiled.

The situation was already completely under their control. Even the high-level combat forces of the Holy tower and other forces outside were controlled by them, so there would be no accidents.

“Dead? Surrender? In your dreams!”

In just an instant, a storm surrounded her. The man and woman immediately became alert, not daring to relax. After all, Kloss, who was in the middle stage, had also died at the hands of the bloodline tower!

However, to their surprise, the storm did not attack them. Instead, it formed a wall of wind, and she quickly fled in the opposite direction.

“Damn it!”

The man’s mouth twitched.

..

Two hours passed in the blink of an eye.

...

Although Vivika had blocked the two for a while, the two gradually caught up, and a battle soon broke out. Vivika quickly fell into a disadvantageous position.

“Go to hell!”

The warlock looked at Vivika ferociously and attacked.

However, to his surprise, a flame appeared this time and blocked the attack.

The flames dissipated, and a figure appeared.

“Udo!” The woman seemed to know the person who appeared and said in surprise.

“The Holy tower’s master’s student, Udo?”

The man also looked at udo with a strange expression.

“You …” At this time, Vivika was also dumbfounded, and she put away the staff that she was about to take out.

“I’m a friend of Herman. He saved my life!” Udo turned to look at Vivika. After asking around, he learned some information about Herman. He was actually Vivika’s teacher.

As for what he saw when he was hiding just now …

He was in a dilemma because he had been hiding for a long time without being discovered. He should have continued to hide, but the only student of Herman, who had saved his life, was right in front of him, and her life was in danger.

To save or not to save?

This was a problem!

However, there was not much time left for him to think. In the end, after some hesitation, he still decided to save her!

Since it had already come to this, he couldn’t run away. He would just take it as repaying the favor.

“teacher’s friend? ” Vivika was puzzled. She didn’t know how her teacher knew this Udo!

“Great, that’s just right. Two at a time is just enough for us to finish our mission quickly!” The warlock looked at the two of them, then took out a firework and lit it up.

A bright signal bloomed.

In the blink of an eye, two figures flew over.

Their auras told everyone that they were two middle-stage third circle warlocks.

The Warlocks looked at Udo and Vivika with a smile.

The two of them had unsightly expressions.

Three of them were in the middle stage, and one was in the early stage.

“It seems like I made the wrong decision this time!” udo was in despair, but the flames on his body began to burn, and his eyes became determined.

He hated owing people favors!

Vivika was also surprised. She didn’t expect her teacher’s friend to be so brave.

Since that was the case …

Vivika’s body also slowly stopped, and the storm slowly appeared behind her.

It was just a battle!
