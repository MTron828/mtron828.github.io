374 Don’t Come Over!

On the other side, the people in the temple looked at each other, but no one spoke.

After a few seconds, Selona, who was sitting high above the temple, asked in confusion, “What was Kenan doing just now?”

“I don’t know!”

The two Warlocks shook their heads.

!!

This time, they were also puzzled. He had agreed to go out and test the waters, but in the end, he went out to welcome them?! CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

The three Warlocks were confused, but they did not say anything because Eli had already entered the hall.

Eli walked to the front of the hall, looked at the three of them, and said, “The Bloodline Tower’s Honorary Vice Master, Eli, is here to discuss matters regarding the Bloodline City and Grassi Land with the members of the Amina Family. ”

Looking at Eli, the two people in the hall walked to Selona’s side.

Selona looked at Eli and said calmly, “Hello, I am Selona, the current head of the Amina family.

“A few months ago, there was a riot in the northern Green Field. Almost all the members of the Amina family went out. At that time, we were seriously short of manpower. I was worried when I heard about the trouble in the Bloodline Tower, but I had no choice.

“Fortunately, you came to save the Bloodline Tower from danger. Otherwise, I would really be a sinner. After all, your Bloodline Tower is under our protection!”

Selona sounded sad, as if he was telling the truth.

Eli sneered in his heart. If he didn’t know the truth, he might have really believed Selona’s nonsense.

These people might not be very strong, but at least their acting skills were at the level of the best actors.

However, Eli did not intend to feign civility with them. He said directly,” Family Head Selona, I don’t think there’s a need for such pleasantries. I only have one purpose for coming here, and that is to discuss the Bloodline Tower’s position and the Grassi Land. ”

Hearing this, the expression on Selona’s face gradually disappeared. He said thoughtfully, “What do you mean?”

” I don’t think it’s appropriate for the Bloodline Tower to be a subordinate now. ” Eli looked at the three of them without any fear.

“What location?” The other Radiant Moon Warlock pulled a long face and coldly said,” The Bloodline Tower is protected by the Amina Family. In return, the Bloodline Tower provides us with some help and resources. As a subordinate, do you think there’s a problem? ”

The pressure of a Radiant Moon Warlock suddenly spread out, pressing down on Eli. Even the dust in the air trembled slightly.

The pressure swept over Eli, but Eli was unfazed.

In the next second, an even greater aura erupted from Eli’s body like a volcanic eruption.

The hall trembled slightly, and the Warlock took a few steps back.

He raised his head with a solemn expression.

Even Selona’s expression changed. Even though he wasn’t the one who had to bear the pressure just now, he still felt a huge sense of oppression!

Eli seemed to be stronger than he had imagined.

However, there were some issues that could not be compromised.

He suddenly snorted and said to Eli, ” Regarding the Bloodline Tower’s position, there’s no need to talk about it. This is a condition agreed upon by the previous leaders of the two factions, but we can talk about the Grassi Land. ”

“Eli.” Selona’s tone softened a little. “Your strength has won my respect. I can give you the Grassi Land as long as you pay 300,000 Magic Stones a year. ”

Eli, “???”

Eli suddenly understood Glen’s feelings.

Eli took a deep breath and said, “Let me tell you my thoughts.”

“Sure.” Selona nodded.

” First, the Bloodline Tower will be an independent force from today onwards. It won’t be attached to any force, including the Amina Family. ” Eli extended his hand and continued, “Second, the Grassi Land is a resource that belongs to the Bloodline Tower.

“Thirdly, due to the fact that the Amina Family did not do anything during the Manticore’s assault, you will have to pay Bloodline Tower a total of 1.5 million magic crystals.

“Do you have any objections?” Eli finished speaking in one breath and then looked at the three of them.

” How dare you! Do you know what you’re talking about? Are you rebelling? ” The other Warlock roared and pointed at Eli.

In the next second, a huge mental palm condensed and hit the Warlock’s face.

Bang!

The Warlock flew out and crashed into the stone pillar of the hall, spitting out a mouthful of blood essence.

” Eli, don’t push it. ” Selona stood up and looked at Eli. A pair of white wings slowly grew out from his back.

The other celestial’s eyes slowly turned white-gold as he stared at Eli.

“So you guys don’t agree?” Eli stretched his body and asked.

“Absolutely not.” Selona appraised.

Eli nodded, then moved his wrists and slowly approached the two of them.

The two Warlocks took a step back.

“What are you doing? Don’t come over. Don’t do anything rash!” The two Warlocks shouted.

With that movement, a fatal sense of danger instantly wrapped around their hearts.

This sense of danger came from Eli. At this moment, the Morning Star Warlock was already curled up in a corner, looking at Eli in fear as if he was looking at a terrifying beast.

” Eli, what are you doing?! ” Selona’s voice grew louder and louder as he spoke.

“What do you think? Of course, I’m trying to negotiate with you.” Eli revealed a kind smile.

Selona turned around and saw that the nearly ten-meter-tall door had closed with a bang. All the places that could be illuminated were instantly covered by shadows.

Gulp!

Selona’s throat moved slightly, and he had a bad feeling.

Another Radiant Moon Warlock consoled Selona. “Milord, don’t be afraid. We’re Radiant Moon Warlocks!”

...

“Yes!” Selona nodded.

There was nothing to be afraid of. It was just one Eli!

…

Outside the temple.

Simon and Kenan waited.

Suddenly, the door closed with a bang. The two of them looked over instantly.

“What happened? Why is the door closed?” Kenan frowned.

“Not just the gate!” Simon pointed at the shadow at the side. At this moment, the entire temple was enveloped by shadows.

The two of them looked at each other and vaguely felt that something was wrong.

The next second, Simon’s brows contracted, and he said to Kenan, who was beside him, “Did you hear any screams?”

“Screams?” The Warlock frowned.

...

Listening carefully, there really did seem to be screams of ” Ahhhhh ” mixed with words like ” Spare me ” and ” I agree “.

Where did the voice come from?

The two of them turned their heads at the same time and looked at the temple.

“It can’t be?”

Simon’s mouth twitched as he vaguely guessed something.

Kenan’s entire body began to tremble. The voice just now seemed to be the voice of two Radiant Moon Lords. Thinking back to what had just happened, he seemed to understand something.

“Should we break through the shadows and go in to take a look?” Simon suddenly turned around and asked Kenan.

“I think we should forget about it. It should just be a nice conversation.” Kenan looked into Simon’s eyes and shook his head firmly.

“I think so too.” Simon agreed.

Thus, the two of them stood in front of the temple. They stopped anyone who came to check on the temple.
