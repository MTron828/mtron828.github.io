386 The Massive Beast Tide

“It’s not over yet?!”

Nikola looked at Hill in confusion.

At this moment, Hill was still bathing in the wood element. She was no longer absorbing the elements, and the elements were no longer gathering here. How could it not end? DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“Oh, it’s a change in nature!” Nikola seemed to have remembered something.

Glen was confused. They were all celestials, so why couldn’t he understand?

At this moment, a change occurred.

Under everyone’s gaze, Hill suddenly burst out with a huge life force. This life force was at least dozens of times stronger than the life force in the Grassi Land. With the explosion of life force, Hill’s height rapidly increased!

Thirty meters.

Forty meters.

…..

90 meters, 100 meters!

Hill’s height rapidly increased. At the same time, her branches became thicker, and her roots went deeper into the ground. It was unknown how far they went. The branches and leaves quickly spread and grew in this life force. Every piece was as green as jade, emitting a dense life force.

This life force affected the surrounding plants.

The trees nearby also began to grow taller. The saplings turned into big trees, and the big trees also grew to a height of 50 to 60 meters. All the big trees surrounded Hill, and countless branches and leaves made rustling sounds as if they were thanking her.

It wasn’t just the trees. All the plants were growing rapidly, and the Magic Medicine Field not far away was the first to bear the result.

Glen was dumbfounded.

One by one, the first circle magical plants broke through to the second circle, and more than half of the second circle magical plants broke through to the third circle. Even among the third circle demonic plants, there were seven to eight that broke through to the fourth circle.

Glen was already numb.

Just the aftershock of the breakthrough had helped so many magic plants breakthrough. What was the origin of this tree?

The ancestor of plants?

What kind of great existence was that?

“As expected, Hill is not simple! “At this moment, Eli also had mixed feelings.

He realized that he had underestimated Hill. He had really restricted Hill for too long.

A massive life force spread out rapidly, towards the depths of the mountain range, towards the Bloodline Tower.

Bloodline Tower.

Many Warlocks suddenly realized that all the plants in the city had started to grow.

In just a few seconds, the vines on the buildings grew as thick as pythons. The trees on the streets grew dozens of meters tall in the blink of an eye, splitting the surrounding roads. The potted plants were taller than humans in the blink of an eye. Weeds grew wantonly, covering every corner of the place.

In just a few minutes, the entire city turned green!

The entire city looked at this huge change in a daze. The upper echelons of the Bloodline Tower quickly took control of the situation.

“Everyone, this is just a small accident. There’s no need to panic. We’ve already controlled the situation!” On the highest Mage Tower, Alida’s voice reverberated throughout the entire Bloodline Tower. In the absence of all the celestials, she had the responsibility of stabilizing the situation.

She stood at the top of the Bloodline Tower and looked at the Grassi Land.

In the mountains, there seemed to be a touch of dazzling green that emitted a strong aura of life!

“What’s that?”

She frowned. She didn’t remember such a tall tree in the Grassi land.

If she remembered correctly, it seemed that Sir Eli and his grandfather had gone there. Could something have happened?

She was going to take a look!

However, in the next second, when her peripheral vision swept across the other areas of the mountain range, her gaze instantly froze.

“What the hell!” Alida’s voice trembled.

The mountains in the distance had already turned gray. This was caused by the flying dust. Within the gray fog, there were countless magical beasts running wildly. Even the sky was as dark as an ocean. There were quite a number of first, second, and third-circle creatures.

In the front, she saw a giant as large as a mountain, a silver moon wolf, and a large bird in the sky. Each of them emitted an aura that was at least a fourth circle. Their auras were similar to that of Jalin.

Three Radiant Moons creatures and tens of thousands of magical beasts!

Beast Tide!

Gulp!

Alida’s throat moved slightly, and cold sweat instantly drenched her back.

” What’s going on?! ”

Alida’s eyes were filled with fear, and her voice was trembling.

With such a huge commotion, it was obvious that they were not the only ones who noticed it. The entire city was instantly in an uproar!

The three circle Warlocks flew into the sky while the low-level Warlocks climbed as high as they could.

“How can there be such a large-scale beast tide?”

” Three celestial-level demonic beasts and tens of thousands of demonic beasts. What is the reason? ”

” How can we block it?! ”

The Warlocks opened their mouths wide and trembled. Some of them even flew out of the city.

” Wait, look! It seems like the Beast Tide is heading towards the Grassi Land. A powerful life aura is erupting from there! ”

Suddenly, someone shouted.

...

At this moment, everyone realized that if the paths of the magical beasts were turned into a pattern, it would be a semicircle, and the center of the circle would be the Grassi, or rather, the dense life force.

However, this did not ease the warlocks’ nervousness because the distance was too close.

The Grassi Land was only a few kilometers away from Bloodline City. If the Beast Tide came, it would be enough to destroy Bloodline City.

“We can’t go out!”

Suddenly, the Warlock who had just escaped returned to the city.

“It’s the same outside the city. There are also many creatures approaching here!”

The Warlocks were shocked. They quickly turned around and realized that countless flying magical beasts were also approaching from afar. There were also countless magical beasts running toward them from the ground. Although their numbers were not as many as those in the mountains, their numbers were not any less.

Soon, the Warlocks discovered that there were creatures approaching from every direction, even underground.

At this moment, the Bloodline Tower was like an isolated island in the ocean. In the next second, they were about to face a huge tsunami that could sink the island.

“We’re done for!”

A Warlock Apprentice collapsed to the ground. There was hope for the powerful warlocks to escape, but it was absolutely impossible for them.

...

If they were to face this beast tide, they would probably be instantly torn into pieces.

“What should we do?” His heart was heavy.

In fact, the entire city was already in a state of turmoil due to the changes in the plants just now. At this moment, it was completely sliding toward one end of the scale, despair!

On the highest Mage Tower, Alida was also feeling heavy, but she knew what she had to do!

Looking at the despairing city, Alida shouted, “Everyone, don’t be afraid. We still have Sir Glen, Sir Nikola, and Sir Eli! ”

Alida’s voice traveled down from the height, and many people raised their heads when they heard it.

” Yes, we still have Sir Eli! ”

“Sir Eli is a Radiant Moon warlock!”

Many Warlocks raised their heads, hope flashing in their eyes. In the face of despair, they had almost forgotten about the strongest warrior of the Bloodline Tower!

But then, a trace of doubt flashed through everyone’s minds.

Where was Eli?

Suddenly, a buzzing sound entered everyone’s ears, and everyone raised their heads.

In the distance, above the grassi land, countless wind elements were gathering, and the seemingly corporeal wind elements seemed to be transforming into something.

“A loudspeaker?”

Alida looked at the elemental wind object in the distance, and a question mark slowly appeared above her head.

She was not the only one. The others were also stunned when they saw the 100-meter-long loudspeaker!

None of the ten thousand Warlocks spoke.

At this moment, the huge loudspeaker began to vibrate, and a voice came out from it. It was Eli’s voice.

“SCRAM!”
