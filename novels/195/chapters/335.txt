336 The Merfolk’s Gift

50 years later.

Eli was in the Tower when he suddenly seemed to sense something and looked out of the tower.

He could feel it. That race was here.

“I finally don’t have to fight monsters every day!” Eli heaved a sigh of relief.

!!

In the past 50 years, his curse had reached 60%. It should be known that he wasn’t specifically going to kill the sea race. He would only attack if the deep sea race were not friendly.

He only made a move once every few years, but it had still accumulated to this extent. In any case, Eli felt that it was a little troublesome.

After all, he had once experimented with spells, but he was not that productive.

He quickly left the mage Tower and flew in the direction he sensed.

…

Eli was very fast, and he soon saw this sea tribe.

To be more cautious, he first observed from the sky.

It was fine if he didn’t observe, but once he did, he was shocked.

On the surface of the sea, not far away, a team was advancing.

There weren’t many of them, only about a hundred, but every one of them had at least two rings, and half of them had three rings. The most outrageous thing was that everyone in this team wore leather armor made of metal and gemstones, and they all held metal weapons.

Weapons and leather armor are not things that ordinary members of the sea tribe can use. However, it might be possible for this race to use them. Eli’s eyes were deep.

At this time, the sea race below was not some random sea race but mermen.

Mermaids and murlocs were two completely different races. Murlocs had a weak status, while mermaids were nobles. They were one of the few sea creatures who had submitted to the mages during the mage era.

These merfolks all had the body of a human and the tail of a fish. Of course, they were different from humans. Their eyes were deep blue, and there were two long blue fins on both sides of their heads. The color was also very dreamy. Even for Eli, this was the first time he had seen such a wonderful race.

“and I’m afraid that this group of mermaids is not ordinary.”

Eli looked towards the center of the merfolk.

A giant sea turtle exuded the aura of the third circle. On top of it, there was a huge open-style seat. On the seat, two merfolk were resting.

It was a man and a woman. The mermaid was dressed luxuriously and had a beautiful face. Her brows and eyes were moving, and her skin was white and red. Half of her upper body was bare, and only two shells covered her chest. She had a different kind of beauty, but her aura was ordinary, only at the level of the second circle. The Merman beside her was tall and strong, and his face was determined. His aura was no weaker than a cluster star rank.

However, the interesting thing was that the merfolk seemed to be led by women.

Besides, Eli could sense the touch of fate on the woman, just like Jin Ji.

…

“Are we really going to run, Eval?”

The mermaid sighed as she sat on the chair.

“Your Majesty, with the death of the previous Sea King, the situation of our merfolk race has become worse. This time, with so many races besieging us, His majesty had no choice but to send us away. The Merman said to her. “But don’t worry, Your Majesty. I’ll protect you.”

“Alright,” he said. The Queen’s eyes were filled with sorrow.

She understood many things, but she was still unwilling to accept them.

“It’s good that you understand, my queen.” The merman, eval, also sighed.

But suddenly, his expression changed.

“Did something happen, Eval?” The Queen asked.

This time, Eval didn’t answer. He just looked up at the sky. In the air, a man was flying towards them. His aura made him feel uneasy.

At this moment, everyone noticed Eli. The merfolk below all looked up at the sky cautiously. Even the Queen became cautious.

The water element wrapped around eval, lifting him into the sky and making eye contact with him.

“Who are you? What is your purpose?” He asked.

“This is my territory. I should be the one asking you this question.” Eli looked at them, and in the next second, he released his aura.

The aura belonging to the Nebula level exploded in an instant, and with the addition of the bloodline curse, it was approaching the radiant moon Mage. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

As the pressure came, all the merfolk on the surface of the sea felt as if a mountain was crushing their bodies. Their faces turned ugly, and they lost control. The Queen even sprawled on the surface of the sea, her face filled with fear.

At this moment, Eval’s face was extremely ugly. This person was not on the same level as him. If this person in front of him wanted to do something to him, he might not even be able to resist.

“Sir, I’m sorry for trespassing on your territory. We’ll leave now.” Eval said apologetically.

“No,” Eli shook his head, looked at the woman on the turtle shell, and smiled. “Queen of the mermaids, you don’t want your race to meet with an accident here, do you?”

As soon as he finished speaking.

Eval’s face changed, and the mermaid’s face turned pale.

…

Half an hour later.

On the turtle shell seats, the mermaid Queen and eval sat on one side while Eli sat on the other.

However, the two merfolk had strange expressions on their faces. They were even a little surprised.

“Sir Herman, you said that you can let us settle down here. You can even help us when necessary. We just need to help you block the invading sea folk and manage the creatures here?” The mermaid Queen looked at Eli. She had never thought that the story would develop like this.

She thought Eli would destroy them. However, she didn’t expect that he would be negotiating terms with them.

“What does the queen think? ” Eli asked curiously.

The Queen blushed.

After a few seconds, she recovered and said to Eli, “We need to discuss this.”

...

“Alright,” he said. Eli nodded and flew into the sky, giving the two of them some space.

“Eval, do you think we should agree?” The Queen asked Eval.

“My queen, do we still have a choice? And you have His Majesty’s bloodline!” Eva said to her.

Hearing this, the Queen lowered her head. That’s right. They had no other choice.

She touched her stomach. The emperor’s bloodline could not be cut off, and the mermaid royal family could not go extinct. The future mermaids needed her child, even if they were not born yet.

“I’m just worried that he might have other conditions later,” Eval said hesitantly.

“Then we’ll just agree to it, no matter what!” The Queen gritted her teeth.

She raised her head and looked up at the sky, shouting, “We’ve finished discussing.”

In just an instant, Eli had already flown down from the sky.

“We agree to your conditions.” The Queen said to Eli.

“I’m sorry, I suddenly thought of something. I might need one more thing.” Eli looked at the mermaid Queen with a burning gaze.

...

“Greedy human, I knew it.” The mermaid Queen gritted her teeth, feeling Eli’s gaze, her body trembling.

This human, indeed, had salacious thoughts about her.

“I can give it to you,” She said through gritted teeth. For the merfolk, she was willing to give up everything.

“that’s great. You’re the Queen, so you should have some knowledge about the faith of the mermaids. Can you tell me more about that? ” Eli was pleasantly surprised.

The Mermaid Queen was stunned!

“faith knowledge? Do you only want that? ” The Queen’s eyes widened as she shouted.

“What else did you think?” Eli looked at her with a strange expression.

A pregnant Mermaid Queen, Eli wasn’t that perverted.

And …

Eli’s gaze was unhurried. In the mermaid Queen’s stomach, life was being nurtured, and the touch of fate was from the unborn child in the queen’s stomach.

How interesting!

“Alright, I’ll give it to you!” at this moment, the Queen felt too ashamed to see anyone, so she lowered her head and agreed.

Compared to other things, the knowledge of faith was not worth mentioning.

“very good. I’ll have my men make arrangements for you guys. I still have an experiment to do. See you later!” Eli said to them, then quickly flew away.

The two merfolk watched blankly as Eli left.

At the same time, a spirit of the dead was flying toward them from not far away.

“My Lords, I’m Sir Herman’s subordinate. I’ll make the arrangements!” Nikola said to the two.

The mermaid Queen and eval looked at each other.

A human who had undead subordinates and still wanted to take in the sea tribe. What kind of person was he?

Was this a Warlock?

They couldn’t figure it out.

A few seconds later, the mermaid Queen nodded at Nikola and said, “Then I’ll have to trouble you to lead the way,”

Since they were already here, they would take things as they came.

Perhaps it wasn’t a bad thing for them to accept Eli’s protection.
