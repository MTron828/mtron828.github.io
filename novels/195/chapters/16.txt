Chapter 17: Invitation

Translator: Lonelytree

The next day as the sun rose, Eli walked out of the house.

He stood in front of the gate and looked at the familiar street in front of him. After determining the direction, he quickly left.

Along the way, Eli looked around from time to time and noticed that there were clearly many homeless people. On the narrow and dirty path, many people were leaning against the wall, their eyes listless.

“I heard that this year’s harvest is not very good. It seems that many people will starve to death this year.” Eli hurriedly walked past, not paying too much attention to these people.

Every era had its own limitations, and this place was no different.

There were some things that he could not change.

Soon, Eli entered the commoner’s district and arrived at the library a few minutes later.

After greeting the security guard, Eli walked in.

Because the teacher was present today, Eli chose to enter the second floor and stopped in a room on the side of the corridor.

“Herman, look at what you’ve done. You can’t even do such a simple thing!”

Before he went in, he heard Clement’s familiar voice. If he wasn’t mistaken, he was lecturing Herman.

Herman was one of the two invigilators and one of Mr. Clement’s students. His father was a Baron, and he was the sixth son of the Baron. He was sent to the library to study.

Eli knocked on the door gently.

“Come in!” Scholar Clement’s voice rang out.

Eli pushed the door open and walked in.

As soon as he entered, he saw scholar Clement sitting behind the table. Compared to three years ago, he had more white hair and more wrinkles. He looked much older.

Herman was standing in front of the table. He had short brown hair and blue eyes. His head was lowered as if he was being lectured by his teacher.

“It’s Eli!” When scholar Clement saw that Eli had arrived, his originally furrowed brows relaxed, and a smile appeared on his lips.

Eli was probably the most outstanding student he had received in recent years. Not only did he learn things quickly, but he also had a good personality and was always polite to others, which he liked very much.

This feeling was even stronger when he saw Herman.

Thinking of this, he glared at Herman.

Herman, “...” I know that I’m not good at my studies, but you don’t have to do this.

“Yes, what’s the matter?” As if remembering something, scholar Clement looked at Eli and asked.

“It’s fine. The materials that teacher asked me to prepare last time have been prepared.”

Eli took out the material from his pocket and handed it to his teacher. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Scholar Clement would often give them some missions to test their abilities.

Scholar Clement took the materials and immediately flipped through them. As he read, his eyes gradually lit up, and the curve of his lips grew wider. He was very satisfied.

“even if I were to prepare this, it’d be difficult to achieve this level. Eli, you’re improving too quickly.” After putting down the materials, scholar Clement stroked his beard.

“It’s because of the teacher’s good education!” Eli said humbly.

“Haha!” Scholar Clement laughed out loud, and his previous unhappiness seemed to have disappeared. He then cast a disdainful look at Herman.

The corner of Herman’s mouth twitched, and he looked at Eli with a bitter expression.

“Is there anything else?” After looking at the materials, scholar Clement asked again.

“That’s all.”

“Then go to work.” Scholar Clement nodded and looked at Herman, who was next to him. He waved his hand and said, “You should leave too.”

‘Hey, what do you mean by that disdainful action!’

Even though Herman was complaining in his heart, he didn’t have the courage to say it out loud. He could only walk out of the room with Eli.

As soon as they walked out of the house, Herman became more active.

“Are you kidding me, Eli? you don’t know this, but there’s clearly something wrong with teacher Clement recently. He’s always picking on me.

“My life is getting harder and harder. I’m starting to regret coming here.” Herman shook his head and sighed.

“Then you can leave the library at any time. The restrictions here aren’t that strict!” The two of them walked along the long corridor, and Eli joked.

“Haha, I’m just joking. How can I leave? ” Herman chuckled.

Although his father was a Baron, he had six sons. The title and the family property had almost nothing to do with him. Being able to enter the library was the greatest help his father could give him.

“Then study hard and don’t make Mr. Clement angry.” Eli nodded and advised.

“You’re right.” Herman sighed and said helplessly, ”

He had a carefree personality, so it was not easy for him to study for a long time.

“Eli!”

The two of them turned a corner when a young girl suddenly entered their line of sight.

Her long brown hair reached her shoulders, and her purple dress revealed half of her calves. Her fair face made her look even more youthful, and her purple eyes made Herman’s heart beat faster.

It was Lias Gimori, the young lady who had passed the test with Eli three years ago.

“Good Morning!” Eli greeted.

Three years ago, she was still a very ordinary girl. Three years later, she had become such a beautiful young lady. This was something that Eli had not expected.

Speaking of which, something had actually happened between her and Eli. Two years ago, this Rise seemed to have a good impression of him because she often asked him questions.

Back then, Eli had also noticed the problem, so he decisively rejected it.

Women would only affect the speed at which he could activate his spiritual power.

After that, Rias did not pester him anymore, and they were now friends.

“You’re really pretty today.” Herman looked at the girl and praised her.

“Thank you,” he said. Rias nodded at him politely, then looked at Eli.

“Eli, I’ve invited a lot of friends to my family’s Manor to hunt this weekend. Do you have time? ” Rias asked, her big purple eyes looking at Eli.

“Hunting?” Eli raised an eyebrow.

Rias Gimori was part of the Gimori family, and the Gimori family was a true count family, a true, noble family.

Although he had been puzzled at the beginning as to why she had come to the library, he seemed to gradually understand that although the library was always unknown, its influence was no less than that of the top nobles.

“Oh, there’s also Herman. Are you guys willing to go? ” Rias added.

“I’m willing, I’m willing.” Herman nodded.

This was a Count’s family. If he could get some connections there, it would be a great thing for him.

However, he also knew that he had benefited from Eli’s success, so he only looked at Eli expectantly and waited for him to make a decision.

“You rejected me last time too. You can’t reject me this time.” Said Rias, looking at Eli.

“Alright then!” Eli nodded helplessly.

He had already rejected Rias’s invitation a few times before, mainly because he thought it was troublesome, but since he had already been invited a few times, it would not be good to reject her every time.

“Then it’s a deal!” Seeing that Eli had agreed, the corners of Rias’s mouth curled up into a smile. With her purple dress, she looked like a blossoming violet.

Rias had come to invite Eli, and after that, they exchanged a few pleasantries before leaving.

Eli, on the other hand, looked at her back as she left, then turned around and left with Herman.

Nothing should happen during a hunt.

However, even if something happened, he was confident that he could solve it.
