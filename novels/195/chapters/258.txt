259 A Ray of Blood Light

“Hahaha, if that’s all, you won’t be able to stop us!”

Tatuck laughed at this scene, and his voice echoed throughout the battlefield.

Compared to his usual self, the bloodline transformation caused his body to expand rapidly, almost reaching 2.5 meters tall. The flesh on his body was no longer bloated, and he looked like a demon!

“Damn it!” Udo gritted his teeth and shouted,

“Lord Kewusu!”

As a battle that would determine the outcome of the war, they also had a trump card, and that was the senior late-stage Holy tower master who had secretly come. His strength was also almost at its limit!

As soon as Udo’s words fell, a Warlock not far away also stood up.

Wisps of flames wrapped around his body, and his eyes seemed to contain endless anger. His body was like a monkey, and he was holding a golden staff in his hand!

“Kewusu!” Tatuck was also stunned when he saw the person. However, he immediately smiled. “kewusu, the last time we met was three years ago. We were still the same back then, but unfortunately, I just broke through a while ago. It’s not like before!”

An even greater moonlight bloomed from his body, and the attack’s aura expanded again!

“Hehe!” The Warlock named kewusu wasn’t afraid at all and rushed directly at the attack.

The two strongest powerhouses instantly collided. In an instant, the huge flame and moonlight collided like a membrane that split the sky in half!

The two of them approached each other. The moonlight in tatuck’s hand turned into a long blade, and the iron rod in the hands of kewusu expanded. The sound of an intense battle erupted.

The two of them began to fight.

Even just the aftermath of the attack had caused dozens of unlucky people to fall. Among them, there were even second-circle warlocks who died inexplicably.

At this moment, the heart of the darkness’ warlocks had also dismounted from the poison Wyvern and launched an attack on the Holy tower Alliance. There were only 1000 of them, but their aura suppressed the 10000 Holy tower members.

In the sky, Udo glanced at the battle between the two late-stage third-circle warlocks before turning his attention to the battlefield below. At this moment, three or four third-circle warlocks were already charging toward him.

He gritted his teeth and looked at the ground.

“Everyone, stop them! We can’t let them pass through here today!” Udo’s voice reverberated throughout the battlefield.

“Kill!”

The members of the heart of darkness were also affected by this voice. After someone shouted, all the warlocks rushed towards the heart of darkness, and the huge bloodline power even caused the surrounding air to tremble!

Bang! Bang!

The two black waves collided, and the battle instantly began.

Udo stood alone, and flames surrounded him as he flew towards the several third-circle warlocks, blocking their attacks. However, the enemy had the advantage in numbers, and he was quickly at a disadvantage.

Not just him.

Although the Holy tower had more people, their level was significantly lower than the heart of darkness. More than half of the warlocks were even from the zero circle, but this also reflected the difficulty of the Holy tower’s current situation.

Therefore, it was inevitable that he would be at a disadvantage.

The Holy tower’s warlocks were almost desperate. In this case, it was mechanically difficult to maintain the status quo, let alone snatch the elemental core.

Udo took a deep breath. His body was covered in wounds, and his bloodline aura was only half of what it was at the start. His expression was extremely ugly.

“hehe, the Holy tower wants to stop us with this? ” One of the warlocks looked at Udo with a mocking expression.

“Surrender. If you surrender, you might still have a chance to survive. Why don’t you join the heart of darkness?”

“the Holy tower’s defeat is inevitable. Why bother? ”

A few of them attacked Udo while mocking him.

Suddenly, everyone heard a voice.

With a loud bang, a huge flame fell from the sky. Everyone looked over and saw the dust on the ground dispersing. The Warlock named keWusu had fallen into a state of unconsciousness!

“Kewusu is dead!”

“As expected of Sir tatuck!”

The heart of darkness’ warlocks shouted.

In the sky, Tatuck looked down at kewusu and smiled contemptuously. Then, he looked at Udo and smiled kindly.

“Kewusu was defeated?!”

Udo was a little dumbfounded!

Kewusu was the strongest Warlock among them this time, but he was actually defeated in one move. How could they fight him?

“This is a loss …” Udo started to doubt his life. He didn’t think that in less than 10 minutes, things would turn out like this.

The silver Moon lake’s elemental eruption would continue for two days. How could they possibly hold on?

Udo gritted his teeth, feeling somewhat unwilling!

There was no longer any suspense!

..

“Something’s wrong, something’s wrong.” On the edge of the battlefield, Simona was frowning.

It was obviously going well, but the uneasiness that followed her like a shadow kept shrouding her heart. It made her feel an inexplicable fear, and as time passed, it became more and more serious.

“Something’s wrong!”

Finally, she gritted his teeth and retreated from the battlefield!

The Warlock who had been attacked was also dumbfounded, not understanding what had happened!

But in the next second, everyone heard a terrifying shriek. A bloody light flew over from a distance, and a shadow spear came along with it.

The spear cut through the sky and flew straight at Tatuck.

...

Everyone only saw a ray of moonlight collide with the shadow, and then the moonlight fell!

The moonlight hit the ground, and a huge pit instantly appeared on the ground. Through the gravel, the dumbfounded crowd looked at the deep pit. Tatuck was lying on the bed in the middle of the deep pit. A huge gash appeared on the left side of his chest, and a shadow nailed him firmly to the ground!

His life and death were unknown!

The 100-meter-wide pit was in sharp contrast to the 10-meter-wide pit of keWusu.

What was happening?

Everyone was dumbfounded because it was too sudden. Tatuck, who had been extremely arrogant a second ago, was now underground.

This turn of events was too sudden.

It was only when everyone noticed tatuck’s defeat that they finally saw the blood-red light flying towards them from a distance.

The blood-red light slowly dispersed, and a figure slowly appeared.

“Are we not fighting anymore?”

Eli looked at the battlefield that had stopped and touched his nose.

...

Looking at Eli’s actions, everyone blinked their eyes, not knowing how to answer.

Everyone had the same question.

“Who are you?”

“Benefactor?”

Udo, who was on the battlefield, blinked his eyes as he looked at the person who had saved him decades ago. It was Sir Herman who had saved him twice.

“Herman, he’s here?”

At this moment, Simona, who had already run out of the battlefield, blinked her eyes.

Black hair, black eyes, wearing a Black wizard’s robe, holding a magic staff in his hand. As for his face, it was the same as it had been decades ago, without any change.

However, his aura was much stronger than before!

What was he doing here?

“Who are you?”

Seven to eight third-circle warlocks from the heart of darkness flew out and questioned eli.

“it doesn’t matter who I am. What’s important is that Silver Moon Lake can’t be destroyed!” Eli didn’t answer directly!

Silver Moon Lake?

Did this person come for the silver Moon Lake?

The heart of darkness warlocks on the field looked at each other, but the person in front of them had killed tatuck in one hit. This made everyone not dare to act rashly and just stare at him.

Suddenly, tatuck, who had been impaled on the ground, coughed.

Threads of moonlight twined around him, repairing his wounds. However, the power of his bloodline was rapidly being consumed. His eyes slowly opened, and he twitched as he looked at the long spear in his chest!

The massive moonlight surged towards the shadow. After all, it was just a casual attack, so it was quickly resolved.

After resolving it, he slowly flew into the sky and looked at Eli.

Everyone heaved a sigh of relief when they saw tatuck recover.

Tatuck, on the other hand, was staring at Eli with a serious look.

“Who are you?”

The attack just now had been too sudden, and he had no time to block it effectively.

“Oh, you blocked it?” Eli still didn’t say anything and extended his hand!

Countless shadows appeared in front of him, and long spears emerged from the shadows. Each of them exuded the same aura as before, but there were a hundred times more of them!

He moved his thumb slightly.

In the blink of an eye, hundreds of Spears flew towards Tatuck. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

It was a massacre, to begin with, so why speak so much nonsense?

“This …”

Tatuck’s expression froze when he saw the 100 shadow Spears flying toward him.

A hundred?

He used the remaining moonlight, but it was useless. After the huge shadow spear passed, countless moonlight and shadows were instantly torn into pieces, blood and flesh scattered!

Tatuck was dead!

The others were speechless for a long time.

However, a 3-circle heart of darkness Warlock immediately shouted, “All third-circle warlocks, gather and kill him together!”

Although it was only for a moment, everyone understood.

They were in big trouble, and they had to gather everyone’s strength.

Even if this person in front of them had the power that could overwhelm Tatuck, it was also impossible for him to survive the attack of four third-circle warlocks.
