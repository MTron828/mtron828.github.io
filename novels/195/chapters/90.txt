91 Teacher

“Long time no see. I didn’t expect to see you here.” Hila was a little surprised to see Eli.

Ever since Clement’s teacher had become the director, the two of them had gotten to know each other again. They were now considered friends, very good friends.

Hila was no longer young, but even though she was about the same age as eli, she had maintained herself very well, as if she was around 30 years old. She always had a faint smile on her face, and she looked very friendly.

“I’m here to take a look. What about you?” Eli replied.

“Me? I don’t have that kind of free time. It’s just that someone recommended me, so I came.” Hila and Eli were a little similar. They did not care about these things and preferred to research.

Eli nodded and did not say anything else.

Soon, more people arrived in the hall.

Eli didn’t expect that there would be so much competition for a teacher of the first princess.

Just as everyone was waiting, a group of people suddenly entered the main hall. The person in the lead was a dignified and beautiful woman dressed in luxurious clothes. Beside her were guards.

From the whispers of the people around him, eli learned that she was her majesty the queen.

“Hello, everyone. I’m Christina, little Anna’s mother. I’m very happy that so many people are here today,” the woman said slowly.

“Today, there are three Grand scholars, sixteen scholars, and an honorary learner. You are all the pillars of the Empire, and each of you is enough to teach little Anna.” The Queen said.

When everyone heard this, they were stunned. A learner? Was there a learner among them? Who was so brave?

Eli pursed his lips while Hila, who was beside him, gently covered her mouth. Her voluptuous body trembled slightly. This was too funny.

Eli had always been a learner, and she had teased him about this a lot.

“Well, it’s a very difficult problem to choose a teacher, so we decided to let little Anna choose directly. You’ll each teach her for 20 minutes, and she’ll choose at the end.” The Queen announced her choice.

The people had different expressions.

This method was very new.

On the other hand, Eli’s eyes lit up. This selection method suited him very well.

“Okay, that’s it then. Everyone, get ready for 15 minutes. We’ll start in a while! ” The Queen had come and left in a hurry, leaving with the others.

Everyone was thinking about how to teach.

On the other hand, only Hila and Eli were chatting.

“I’m not interested. Are you really not worried at all? ” Hila looked at Eli and asked with a smile. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“It’s alright. I’ll leave it to fate,” Eli said humbly.

“You’re worthy of your reputation!” Hila’s eyes flickered as she revealed a smile.

‘This guy, Eli, is still as confident as ever!’

However, as someone who was familiar with Eli, she knew that Eli’s knowledge was no less than hers. He was really knowledgeable, and she would sometimes ask him for advice. It was incredible.

As the two of them chatted, the others naturally noticed the two of them.

“Who is this man? Do you know him? He looks very close to scholar Hila!” One of the scholars asked the scholar beside him.

“I think he’s a student of Grand scholar Clement.” the man replied. Seeing Hila covering her mouth and laughing, he was also a little unhappy.

Clement had been a Grand Sholar a few years ago.

There was a reason for the man’s unhappiness. One of the reasons was Hila. When she was in her twenties, she was the most beautiful female scholar in the Empire. Now that she was in her fifties, she was still the most beautiful female scholar in the Empire. She was also very popular in the academic circle, especially since she was still single.

“Is he the learner? He’s really messing around, what’s he doing here?” The man was a little dissatisfied with Eli’s reality, but he was even more dissatisfied with Hila’s attitude.

She was usually very cold and aloof and rarely got close to others.

“it seems like your charm is really long-lasting. It hasn’t changed at all after so many years.” Naturally, Eli felt the hostility from the other men and teased Hila.

“Hmph! that potion of yours is quite useful,” Hila said as she glanced at Eli. “I do feel like I’m in a good state. Rias likes it a lot too.”

The two of them were talking about anti-aging potions that he had made for Rias. As for Hila, he made them for her later in his life.

The two of them chatted for a while before Hila suddenly said, “At this moment, a Grand scholar entered the room. He was a court scholar. He looked at the crowd and said, “The first one, scholar Cole!”

An old man stood up and was taken away. The others stayed where they were and waited.

Eli continued to chat with Hila as if he was not worried at all. The others’ originally nervous feelings were also shattered by the two as they watched the two ‘flirt’.

Soon, scholar Cole returned.

Another scholar was summoned.

The princess could only do this for so long. Therefore, it was better to get summoned earlier than later.

Very quickly, Hila tidied up her clothes and left. She returned twenty minutes later.

“How is it?”

“The princess is very beautiful!” Hila replied.

Eli, “??”

‘What do you mean by that? What does it have to do with me whether the princess is beautiful or not?’

“Didn’t you say that you like the younger ones?” hila glanced at him and said.

Eli, “…”

As for when he said those words, Eli couldn’t even remember. ‘I didn’t expect this woman to remember. It must be when we were chatting in the past.’

“Alright, alright, I won’t tease you anymore.” Hila looked at Eli’s expression and laughed.

At this moment, three-quarters of the crowd had passed, and it was finally Eli’s turn.

“I’m leaving!” After saying goodbye to Hila, Eli and the guard left.

After walking past a few palaces, they came to a small palace.

As soon as he walked in, he saw a table not far away and a little girl with a helpless face.

Hila did not lie to him; she was indeed beautiful.

The little girl’s skin was very fair and her face was very pretty. Although she was still young, one could tell that she was a beauty. She was like a little angel, extremely beautiful.

Of course, Eli wouldn’t really have any thoughts about it. In fact, he still preferred older ones.

He liked women like hila, who had big breasts, a good figure, and long legs.

“Are you the new scholar? Let’s start.” When the little girl saw that more people had come, she waved her hand and told him to start.

“Alright!” Eli nodded. “Which history do you wish to learn?”

“Then, let’s talk about when bryne established his country. ” the girl thought for a while and said.

“Alright, I know quite a lot about this.” Eli nodded. The guards were standing nearby.

Eli began his lecture, and at the same time, an invisible mental force was emitted. This was a simple application of the charm spell.

This was not a fair competition, to begin with.

Eli spoke with fervor and assurance, and the girl quickly fell into it. She kept feeling that the grandfather in front of her had an inexplicable attraction, which made her have a good impression of him.

In fact, Eli was also a good teacher. In order to assist and help seviro mesa in her search, Eli had also read a large amount of information and was very clear about the foundation of the kingdom.

Soon, the story ended.

The girl, who was the first princess, pointed at Eli and said in a tender voice, “He is the teacher I want.”
