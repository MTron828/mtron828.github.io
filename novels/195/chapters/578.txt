579 Sea King Poseidon

Three days later.

In the Tower, Alida looked at the thousands of letters in front of her worriedly.

Each of them came from a different location, but the content was surprisingly similar. They were all about the Sea Tribe invading the continent and needing help.

“This move of the sea race is ruthless!” Alida shook her head.

The ocean was several times larger than the continent, and there were many marine life forms in it. As for the marine race that had combat strength, there were as many as the hair on an ox. In terms of numbers, humans were far inferior.

“What should we do?”

She sighed and suddenly remembered what she was told a few days ago.

If it was three days, it should be today, right?

She raised her head and saw a blood-red light leaving the Grassi land and heading into the distance.

“Sir?”

Alida’s eyes widened.

The blood light was very fast. In the blink of an eye, it had crossed more than half of the continent and arrived above the ocean.

The light dissipated, revealing Eli.

As his clone sensed the locations of the upper echelons of the Sea Tribe, Ely was trying to figure out which one to start with. He only made up his mind when he saw a familiar Sea Tribe.

“Let’s start with the Deep Sea Demon Whale Clan.” Shaking his head, Eli set off toward the depths of the sea!

..

Extreme Sea Abyss!

This was the temporary place where the Demon Whale Clan was based, and it was also their clan’s territory. Ever since the war began, the Demon Whale Clan had moved here in order to avoid possible attention of Eli.

In the depths, two demon whale clans were currently conversing.

One of them looked like an old man in his twilight years, while the other was a young and strong Demon Whale. However, compared to the two, the young Demon Whale seemed particularly respectful, even humble.

The young Demon Whale lowered its head and looked at the fifth circle peak expert who had awakened decades ago. This time, it was also because of his suggestion that the Sea Tribe decided to use this guerilla attack.

“Sir, the various marine races have already invaded the human continent and caused great damage to them. However, won’t this be a bad thing? Will it completely anger Eli?” He lowered his head and asked cautiously.

“Definitely.” the old man said calmly.

“Then…” The young devil whale wanted to say something but was stopped by the old man. He sneered,

“But so what? Can he still find the traces of all the members of the Sea Clan in the endless deep sea? This is absolutely impossible. He is only a sixth-circle warlock!

“If he wants to use force to make our Sea Race submit, then he’s thinking too much. The Sea Race will always be free. They will definitely not be slaves of humans, whether it’s today or tomorrow!”

The young devil whale couldn’t help but lower its head, not daring to speak.

He had once heard that this ancestor was once a slave of the Mages. That was why he hated humans so much!

“But…If not for the fact that they worked for the mages, the Sea Tribe would have been killed already.”

Of course, he didn’t dare to say these words. He could only mutter them in his heart.

He didn’t feel much about becoming a vassal of the human race. After all, the sea race had been a vassal of the human race for tens of thousands of years. It was just that they had been free for the last few thousand years.

“I understand, Patriarch!” He nodded and prepared to leave, but suddenly a strange smell entered his nose.

“Eh, what’s that smell?” He frowned.

“It’s blood!” The old devil whale glanced at him disdainfully.

Blood?

But in the next second, both of them were stunned!

Why would there be blood in the deep sea?

However, the two devil whales did not panic. They only frowned.

“Let’s go out and take a look!” The fifth-circle demonic whale frowned and said.

“Good!” He nodded and turned his head around. A figure had already appeared not far away, looking at the two demon whales with a smile.

“Who are you?” The eyes of the two flickered. The old devil whale looked at this person and asked.

“Eli!”

Eli replied calmly, and the expressions of the two whales changed.

“How could it be you? How did you find this place?” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

The two devil whales panicked at the same time. They moved at the same time and turned to run.

But in the next second, the two of them realized that they could not move.

He turned around and saw the projection of a world slowly descending.

“It’s over.”

The two of them looked desperate.

..

“What? The Deep Sea Demon Whale Clan has been discovered by Eli, and all the people above the fifth circle have died!”

In another secret place in the deep sea, the emperor of the Giant Octopus was shocked.

“Yes, Patriarch!” In front of him, a small Gigantic Octopus nodded and said uneasily, “And it wasn’t just the Deep Sea Demon Whale Clan. All the higher-ups of the Black Tortoise and the Sea Giant Clan were found and killed.”

“How is that possible?” Emperor Giant Octopus’ face was filled with disbelief!

” It’s true, my lord. Eli seems to have a heavenly eye. No race can escape his eyes, and as soon as they’re discovered, the higher-ups will all be slaughtered!” The octopus had a bitter expression.

The recent week was the most turbulent week in the Deep Sea.

Dozens of races have been slaughtered and even affected the battlefield. A large number of sea races have no choice but to retreat and give up the attack. Now the war seemed to be over.

In reality, five out of the eight royal families had already been killed. The four royal families that were from the aggressive faction had become history. The Imperial Dynasty’s combat strength had fallen to the lowest point in history.

And the worst thing was that Eli was still killing.

“It’s over. Everything is over. The Sea Race is finished!” Giant Octopus Emperor sighed, feeling sad.

He had advised them not to attack back then, but unfortunately, no one listened to him.

However, this price had to be borne by all the Sea Tribes.

Kaka!

Suddenly, a giant octopus ran over from the distance. It had a hurried expression and shouted, “Patriarch, there’s a fluctuation outside the clans-ground. There’s an aura fluctuation outside. Our hiding ground seems to have been discovered.”

” It’s over. Eli is here!” Giant Octopus Emperor’s face was filled with despair.

However, in the next second, another giant octopus swam over quickly and said, “Patriarch, it’s not Eli. It’s the king of the merfolk, Poseidon!”

“Poseidon?”

Giant Octopus Emperor was stunned. He didn’t understand why he was here at this critical moment!

Soon, he met Poseidon.

Poseidon’s first sentence stunned him.

“Do you want to live?”

Of course, he did. Five of the Imperial Family had been killed, and he could be next.

But what did Poseidon mean by this?

“Of course. Do you have a way?” He looked at Poseidon and asked.

“I have a way to stop Eli from slaughtering the Sea Tribe!” Poseidon nodded and said,” But I have a condition. If I succeed, I want you to support me as the new king of the Sea Tribe!”

Hiss!

When he heard that Poseidon had a way, he almost jumped up.

As for the conditions after that, so what!

As long as he could survive, everything was not a problem.

Even if he had to become a vassal of mankind again, even if he had to lose his freedom again.

“Alright, I want you to contact the various races.” Poseidon smiled.

“But I have a question,” he suddenly asked.

“Tell me!” Poseidon said.

“Your conditions are naturally fine. In fact, I think most people will agree with it. But do you have the power to keep the various races in place?” Giant Octopus Emperor asked worriedly.

In the next second, a vigorous aura erupted. An aura that even surpassed him appeared in front of him. It had also reached the peak state of the fifth circle.

“What do you think?” Poseidon asked with a smile.

“Sure!”

The Giant Octopus Emperor took a deep breath and nodded.

“I’ll contact them for you now!”

..

In fact, the negotiation was beyond the Giant Octopus Emperor’s imagination.

Once he contacted the marine race, almost every one of them quickly agreed, as if there were hungry wolves following behind them.

The truth was, recently, seven or eight large clans had been massacred, so they couldn’t help but feel afraid.

They moved to gather at a spot for negotiation. Even if they risked being discovered, they would still fight for this chance to live.

As for the location, it was in the territory of the Deep Sea Giant Octopus Race.

This was a secret realm of the sea, and it was also one of the safest places.

Dozens of remaining Sea Clan leaders looked at Poseidon in the center, their eyes filled with anticipation.

“Poseidon, tell us what your plan is.” The Deep Sea Giant Octopus Emperor looked at him and said.

“Yes, everyone is here!”

“As long as you can really save us, we will support you as the new Sea King!”

“I agree!”

The Sea Tribe Patriarchs nodded and agreed.

Mermaid Laura, who was among them, saw this scene, and her mouth twitched.

She naturally knew about what had happened during this period of time. She really thought that Eli was going to slaughter all the Sea Tribe. She had originally planned to have a chat with Brother Eli, but this happened instead.

At this moment, she finally understood Eli’s purpose.

On the other side, Poseidon nodded at Laura and took out a soul contract. He raised it and said, “This is a soul contract. I need everyone to sign the contract first. Don’t worry. This contract is very loose.

“Of course, I can also guarantee that my method will not harm everyone’s interests. Everyone can take a look at these contracts before signing them.”

Seeing the contract, the expressions of the members of the Sea Tribes changed.

However, when they took the contract, they found that there were no traps on it. Its content was similar to what Poseidon offered verbally. Only then did they relax a lot.

“I’ll sign it!” Giant Octopus Emperor was the first to sign the contract.

The other races took a look, nodded, and signed the contract.

After withdrawing the contract, Poseidon, who was also Eli, nodded in satisfaction. He looked around and said, “Everyone, I will personally go to the human continent and have a talk with Eli!”

Hiss!

Everyone sucked in a breath of cold air, and their gazes were shocked!

He still dared to go to the human continent and even wanted to talk to Eli?! What kind of courage was this? It should be known that Eli would kill any member of the Sea Tribe he saw and would not talk to them at all.

Regardless of success or failure, everyone was already shocked.

In the corner, Laura was desperately pursing her lips, afraid that she would laugh.

She had no choice. It was really painful to endure.

..

On the other side.

Bloodline Tower!

Alida looked at the dozens of scattered letters in front of her and smiled.

In less than half a month, the situation of the war had changed.

“But the lord is really ruthless!” Thinking of the news from the deep sea, Alida could not help but shake her head.

These days, the lord really went on a killing spree!

It was no wonder that the marine race was completely afraid.

“I just don’t know when the lord will return!” She shook her head, but the crystal ball not far away suddenly flashed.

“What happened?”

She was stunned and quickly connected her mental power to it.

“His Excellency is about to return, and he will be negotiating with Poseidon, the king of the Sea Tribe!”

As she recalled the information in the crystal ball, she opened her mouth wide.

As expected, the marine race responded.

However, would the negotiations go smoothly?

Alida pondered silently.
