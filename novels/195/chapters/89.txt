90 Opportunity

If the time were one day, one week, one month, or even one year, the possibility of a break would be zero.

However, if the time were extended indefinitely, the probability of an opportunity appearing would be 100%.

And this was the one hundred percent chance that Eli was waiting for.

…

!!

Five years later.

Eli had just finished a day’s work and left the library when he heard his teacher calling for him. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Teacher, you were looking for me?”

In the familiar library, Eli met his teacher.

“Oh, Eli, you’re here.” Clement raised his head and looked at Eli.

At this time, his hair and beard were all white, and the wrinkles on his arms were clearly visible. He was already 80 years old. In this world, except for those Grand Knights, he was really considered old.

“Teacher, what’s wrong?” Eli asked directly.

He should be 47 years old at the moment, and his appearance gave off the feeling of an uncle who had experienced many vicissitudes of life. His eyes seemed to be filled with knowledge and were filled with a different kind of charm.

At this time, there was no one to talk to him about marriage.

Everyone knew that learner eli was a man who liked to be alone.

Oh, right, he was still a learner at the moment, and he simply didn’t want to be promoted. Otherwise, with his knowledge and connection, it would be very easy for him. the main thing was that he might have to take care of students after becoming a scholar. If he had a student like Herman, it would be a headache.

Speaking of Herman, he had already retired and had a grandson. Eli had even given his grandson a name.

Over the years, he had also known many people who had died. Dor example, the kid from the knight academy had died in a duel, and Roland’s second son had accidentally drowned!

It had only been five years, and the changes had been so great.

It was foreseeable that there would be a period of time in the future when a large number of Eli’s friends would die. Just thinking about it made him feel a little vexed.

Eli could only remain calm and focus on more important things.

This was the only way he could maintain his motivation.

“Send out this document and see who wants to try it.” Clement pushed out a document.

Eli took it.

After a casual glance, his eyes lit up.

He understood.

The opportunity had come.

The document simply stated that His Majesty the king’s six-year-old eldest Princess needed a teacher who was proficient in history to undergo five years of education.

Bryne the seventh originally had one eldest son, who died in an accident about seven years ago. Currently, he only had a Princess who was born six years ago. According to Bryne’s rules, women also had the right to inherit. As the eldest princess, as long as she was not too bad in the future, she would have the opportunity to become Bryne the eighth.

This was an opportunity for Eli.

It was not easy to excavate the main hall of the palace, but what if the queen wanted to excavate and rebuild it?

Eli’s thoughts were simple.

After controlling the future queen, when she inherited the throne, it would be time for him to reap the rewards.

As for the fact that it might take some time, that was a small problem.

“Teacher, who is qualified for this?” Eli turned and asked.

“Are you interested in this?” Clement raised his head, and a rare look of surprise flashed in his eyes.

This student of his was not bad in other aspects, but he was very lazy.

He was too lazy to socialize.

He was too lazy to be promoted.

He was too lazy to go out.

Apart from the friends he made when he was young, he would not attend any parties or social meetings with strangers. He would not take the initiative to make friends with others either.

Although he vaguely knew that Eli’s social circle was actually quite high-end, he wasn’t very sure. Anyway, he felt that Eli should make more new friends.

As for the promotion, Eli was too lazy to even take on a student. However, after having Herman as a student, Clement understood why.

Clement had the most misgiving about Eli’s social life. In the past thirty years, the only time he had gone out was to negotiate with the Lorraine Kingdom. Other than that, he had never gone beyond the ten-kilometer range of the Jun Lin.

“Do you want to try?” Clement asked again, and his tone was somewhat impatient.

“Uh, I do have some ideas.” eli looked at teacher clement’s actions and laughed. Was it that ridiculous?

“Okay, then I’ll have a good chat with you.” Clement nodded and motioned for Eli to sit down.

Eli sat down.

“Well, in fact, every princess and prince has many teachers. These teachers are generally proficient in different aspects of knowledge. This is to ensure that they have their own opinions from different aspects.

“This time, the first princess needs a history teacher. If you are interested, you can try it. As long as you are a learner or a scholar in the Empire, you can try.” Clement said.

Eli nodded, indicating that he understood.

“Well, what if there are many people who tried to fight for the post?” Eli asked.

“Well, it’s usually based on fame, or someone will test you. It depends on your ability. However, if you aren’t even a scholar, I’m afraid you’ll be directly eliminated and don’t even need to participate in the competition.” Clement glanced at Eli and smiled.

Eli was speechless. Was all hope lost?

“don’t worry, you’re my student. With my letter of recommendation, you’ll be able to pass easily.” Seeing Eli’s expression, Clement laughed.

“Teacher, I’ll leave the letter of recommendation to you.” Eli smiled as he looked at Clement.

“A month’s worth of work.”

“Three days,”

“Twenty days.”

“A week!”

In the end, after a heated discussion, Eli won the recommendation letter with ten days of helping out with Clement’s work.

“Thank you, teacher. I’ll take my leave then!” Eli left with a smile.

Looking at Eli, he shook his head. He wasn’t being serious at all.

He had once thought of letting Eli inherit his position, but after seeing Eli’s attitude, he gave up on this unrealistic idea. It was impossible for him to handle documents every day.

“Hey, why are the documents still here?” suddenly, he realized that eli didn’t take the documents with him. “Eli, come back! Do you still want the recommendation letter?”

…

Three days later.

Eli went to the palace with a recommendation letter from his teacher.

He showed the letter to a guard, and then he was led all the way to the palace, through many long corridors and gates, and was brought to a building.

The moment he entered.

Eli looked around.

Good Lord, so many people.

There were more than a dozen people, including several grand scholars and other scholars. Some of them were famous scholars, and they were all sitting on the chairs on both sides of the room.

The competition was fierce!

Eli sat quietly on the chair at the back, waiting for the selection to begin.

Just as he sat down, another person sat down beside him.

He turned his head and looked.

The famous female scholar of the Empire, Hila.

“Long time no see! Hello, ” Eli greeted.
