463 Capturing the Dragon with One Hand

Eli didn’t answer. He just looked at the dragon, especially the flames. He felt a unique feeling as if it could burn everything. It seemed that this was the special power of the laws.

Thank you readers!

“Answer me!” Seeing that Eli did not respond, Giovanni shouted angrily, and a scorching firestorm appeared around him!

Seeing the Firestorm, Eli waved it away and said calmly, “I was the one who took him away, but I didn’t imprison him. I just wanted him to cooperate with me for some experiments. When the experiment is over, I’ll naturally let him go. However, since you’re here, I happen to lack a high-level dragon experiment subject for my experiment.”

An indifferent tone and a contemptuous tone!

At this moment, after hearing these insulting words, Giovanni was completely furious.

!!

Not only he, but the other dragons behind him also revealed angry expressions. If Giovanni was not in front, these dragons might have rushed out and killed Eli in the next second!

“Come on, let me experience the combat strength of a half-step fifth-circle dragon. Tell your clansmen to stay here and not move. Otherwise, they will bear the consequences!”

Eli flew into the sky and did not forget to remind him.

Giovanni’s mouth twitched. He wanted to kill Eli immediately, but he still said to Sayis behind him, “Wait!”

Although the human in front of him was arrogant, the contact just now made him inexplicably feel a trace of fear.

The human in front of him might not be as simple as he thought!

After that, Giovanni soared into the sky. The flames around him burned like a red torrent!

A man and a dragon came to a higher place!

Eli stretched out his hand, signaling the dragon to take action. At the same time, he activated all the defensive methods on his body. Then, he held the Wizard Book in one hand and the staff in the other as he looked at the dragon. He was like a teacher testing his students before an exam, relaxed and unconcerned!

Giovanni’s mouth twitched!

However, in the next second, countless flames fell from his body and changed continuously. In the end, it transformed into the shape of a dragon’s head. It opened its scorching dragon mouth and roared as it flew towards Eli!

The flames streaked across the sky, and cracks appeared in the surrounding space, emitting shrill screams.

The Warlocks on the ground closed their eyes as well. They could feel the surrounding temperature rising at a visible rate. Bubbles appeared in the lake, and water evaporated. Many plants were rapidly withering and turning into dried corpses!

It was just a flame attack, but its power was much stronger than an ordinary peak Radiant Sun!

This was a half-step five-ring!

“How are you going to deal with it?” Giovanni looked at Eli seriously.

This attack looked ordinary, but it was at least 70% of his strength. Its power was terrifying!

If the Warlock in front of him were really a peak Radiant Sun Warlock, then he would definitely die!

In the next second, an ocean-like shadow condensed in the sky, turning into a huge shadow hand that grabbed at the dragon’s head!

The flames were scorching hot, but the shadows were even stronger.

Under the watchful eyes of the crowd, the huge flaming dragon head was grabbed by the shadow and flew towards Eli.

Easy!

“Compared to ordinary flames, the flames are not only hotter, but they also seem to have some other properties. It seems to have the feeling that they can burn anything!” Eli lowered his head to observe the flames. The flames kept burning the shadow, and holes appeared in the shadow at a rapid speed!

This was the first time Eli had encountered such a powerful flame. Or rather, it was not just flames in front of him, but there was even a sense of law!

Fortunately, the number and quality of the shadows were high enough to barely suppress the flames, but they could not extinguish them!

The eternal flame?

“So this is the half-step fifth circle creature’s power. It seems that this is the reason why they are even stronger!”As Eli was comprehending the flames, his understanding of the half-step fifth circle deepened!

At this moment, Giovanni, who was not far away, was watching this scene in a daze!

Caught?

His flame attack was caught in the palm of his hand?!

This was too ridiculous!

“Who exactly are you? You definitely can’t be Radiant Sun.” Giovanni shouted at Eli.

“I am Eli.”

Seeing that he couldn’t figure out anything from the flames, he looked at the Dragon King again and waved the book in his hand.

“Continue. Use other methods as well. Your flame is indeed interesting!”

His tone was as if he was treating an experimental tool. Giovanni’s mouth twitched, but the anger in his heart erupted like a volcano!

“I’m going to kill you!”

…..

The raging fire made the flames around his body even more turbulent, and it also allowed Eli to see more methods!

Soon, he was even clearer about the difference between a half-step fifth circle and fourth circle.

Firstly, one would need to gain a preliminary understanding of a law at this stage. For example, Giovanni had the law of fire. The special thing about it was that his fire could burn everything. Not only shadows but elements, celestials, and even spiritual energy could be burned!

Its power was also many times stronger than ordinary flames. It was not a simple increase in temperature and strength!

Secondly, the Fire law seemed to be feeding the dragon’s body, allowing it to adapt to the rules. At least, this dragon’s body was many times stronger than his son’s.

“I see!”

Eli blocked another attack and recorded the data in the book.

He then closed the book and looked at Giovanni. The flames on his body had dimmed a lot. He was panting heavily, but the flames did not stop at all. However, they were much weaker than before!

“It seems that your strength is only this much. If that’s all, then you can stay here today!” Eli said.

Roar!

With a low growl, Giovanni looked at Eli doubtfully. He felt that he must have seen a ghost today!

Eli was just a Radiant Sun, but he had easily suppressed him. It was simply ridiculous!

He finally understood why Ortiz was captured!

He was too strong!

While he was sleeping, a powerful Warlock had unknowingly appeared in the northern part of the Western Regions!

However … Want to capture him?

“You’re delusional. You’re very strong, but you’re only slightly stronger than me. If I want to leave this place, you can’t stop me!” Giovanni looked at Eli and said cautiously.

“Indeed.” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Eli nodded in agreement and then changed the topic, “Capturing prisoners and killing are indeed two different levels of difficulty. If I were to rely on myself, there might be some accidents. However, it’s a pity that you chose to fight here. This is my main battlefield!”

Giovanni:

What did he mean? He didn’t understand!

In the next second, he saw Eli wave the staff in his hand. The giant humanoid statue on the top suddenly burst into dazzling light. Golden light soared into the sky and flew toward Eli.

Countless golden lights wrapped around Eli’s body, like a layer of golden gauze, emitting light.

He was like a god!

The Warlocks on the ground also raised their heads to look at the sky, their faces filled with shock!

For most of the Warlocks, the battlefield was too high above the ground. Coupled with the elemental smoke and fire, they could not see the scene at all. However, at this moment, everyone could only see a huge shadow in the sky. He held a witchcraft book in one hand and a staff in the other!

The light illuminated thousands of areas, as well as the huge red dragon that was thousands of miles long!

In the next second.

Everyone only heard the word “seal”.

A huge shadow hand suddenly appeared in the sky. It was also three thousand meters long and then grabbed the dragon!

Roar!

With a shrill cry, the giant dragon was captured by the shadow hand like a small earthworm.

Then, it exploded. Layers of light spots lit up and wrapped around Giovanni. The flames were extinguished bit by bit, and his strength was instantly sealed. His limbs could not move, and he was like a lamb waiting to be slaughtered!

“I have the material!”

Looking at the sealed dragon, Eli smiled.
