163 Blood Soul Flower

White Tower Square.

It was a square located near the periphery of the White Tower. The entire area was paved with white stones and was very large. Generally, large-scale outstation teams would gather here.

At this time, a large group of people had gathered in the square. There were about 150 people.

Among them, there were about 120 apprentices. They were basically wearing ordinary leather armor or Warlock robes. It was a kind of clothing similar to a mage’s robe but lighter.

The others were all first-circle warlocks. Although they were also wearing leather armor and Warlock robes, the materials and defensive spell formations they were made of were worlds apart from those of the acolytes.

At this moment, the warlocks were all looking up at a high platform in front of them.

On the high platform, Kratos stood at the front while Rawls and Eli stood on both sides behind him.

Eli stood on the high platform and looked down. He saw Ross in the crowd, but Ross was already a middle-stage first-circle Warlock. He had been brought out of prison twenty years ago and was also participating in this event.

“The warlocks in the camp are also developing well. They’re quite strong. Herman, you have to be careful. Don’t lose to them one day.” Rawls’ eyes flickered as he spoke to Elil. Eli glanced at Rawls and ignored him.

Speaking of which, the strength that he had shown was definitely not one of the strongest 16 people in the White Tower. After all, although warlocks were not bad in the late stages, there were always some who were talented. For example, Rawls was already at the limit of the late stage of the first circle. However, as one of the founders, unless he died or was betrayed, no one could pull him out of the Parliament.

“You little rascal, I have a bloodline of a two-circle creature, so it’ll be much easier for me to break through in the future. I’ll probably break through to the second circle before you do, so be careful of me taking your place, okay?” Rawls laughed.

“Okay, good luck then,” Said Eli as he nodded.

Rawls’ smile froze.

He still wanted to say something, but this time, Kratos turned around and glanced at him, signaling him to stop.

Kratos was also helpless. They had known each other for sixty or seventy years, but nothing had changed. Then, he turned to look at the warlocks below.

It had been two days since the last meeting, and the White Tower had selected many warlocks to participate in this expedition to the mystical realm.

“I welcome everyone to participate in the battle against the Blood Alliance. I am Kratos, and I believe everyone is familiar with me.” Kratos started to speak directly, and the crowd quieted down in an instant. “This is an opportunity for the Blood Alliance and us. So I only have one request for you this time, and that is to win!

“Not only must we win against the Blood Alliance in terms of the ownership of the secret land, but we must also win against them in terms of combat and let them see the power of the White Tower warlocks!” Kratos said loudly.

“Of course, we won’t let everyone work for nothing. This time, we’ll rank everyone according to the number of resources you gain. When the time comes, you can use your contribution to purchase stuff from the White Tower, including limit-breaking potions, magic blood potions, bloodlines, or bloodline crystals needed by first circle warlocks.” As compared to empty promises, material rewards were much better.

The Academy had also put in a lot of money.

Therefore, the warlocks below heard this and shouted one after another. Their fighting spirit instantly rose to the peak. They even wanted to enter the secret realm immediately.

But as the council member of the White Tower, Eli pouted.

Loss?

If they could obtain the secret plane, then these resources were nothing at all. If they couldn’t, a quarter of the warlocks’ resources could basically offset the rewards. Not only would they not lose anything, but they might even make a small profit.

As for where the money came from, it went through all sorts of conversion and then entered the pockets of the various higher-ups, and it just so happened that Eli was one of them.

Therefore, when Eli looked at this group of people, he felt they were rather innocent.

“That’s all I have to say. When the time comes, we’ll just adapt to the situation in the secret realm. Members of Parliament Herman and Rawls would also enter the secret realm. If you meet them, you have to follow their orders!” Kratos said again.

Then, Rawls and Eli also gave a simple speech and then distributed the map of the arcane realm, ending the meeting.

At the same time, dozens of giant Sauron Eagles were already waiting on the side.

This was a type of Giant Eagle from the zero circle. Although its level was low, it was very heavy and large. Each of them could carry up to a dozen people. It was a means of transportation for the White Tower.

“Let’s go!”

At Kratos’s announcement, all the warlocks climbed onto the back of the giant Eagle. Eli and Rawls also walked to one of the giant eagles.

“Herman, Rawls, come with me.” At this moment, Kratos waved at the two of them. They were baffled but followed him.

On the other hand, Eli felt that something must have happened. He had already felt that something was off during the meeting.

After getting on the back of the giant Eagle, Kratos didn’t say anything. They each sat in a corner.

When everyone was ready, the giant Eagle flapped its wings, and at the same time, light wind elements wrapped around the sides of its wings, bringing them into the sky.

Buzzzzzz!

At this moment, a magic tool on the neck of the giant Eagle was activated, and a shield appeared, blocking the surrounding pressure and wind for the warlocks. Then, it flew away.

The giant Eagle was very fast, flying dozens of meters in the blink of an eye. Eli was also admiring the scenery on both sides, considering if he should find himself a flying ability.

Just as he was thinking, Kratos, who was not far away, finally spoke.

He turned around and looked at the two of them. “Come closer. I have something to tell you.”

Rawls was a little dumbfounded, but Eli had already expected this, so he was very calm.

“Milord, is there something you need?” Rawls asked.

“It’s nothing. I just want to talk to you about the secret realm.” Kratos sat down and smiled at the two.

“You must have some questions this time. For example, why did I take the initiative to accept this mission? ” Kratos asked.

“No?” Rawls said subconsciously, but he soon realized that he had said something wrong.

Kratos was speechless for a moment, but in the next second, he smiled again and said, ” I want to join the secret realm this time because, in the first round of exploration, my men found traces of second circle blood Soul Flowers. I need this thing very much!”

Kratos looked at the two of them with a serious expression.

Eli understood now. It made sense now, but if he remembered correctly, the Blood Soul flower should be a precious plant that could repair the damage to one’s soul.

Could it be that… Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

On the other side, seeing that the two of them also understood what the blood soul Flower was, Kratos didn’t hide it and said, ” you’ve been my subordinates for many years, so I trust you. To be honest, when I fought with the Blood Alliance, my soul was damaged. At first, it was nothing, but as my strength increased, this problem became bigger and bigger. Now, if I want to go further, I have to make up for it.

“That’s why I need you to do your best to bring out the blood soul Flower from the secret realm for me. Can you do it? ”

“Lord, don’t worry. We’ll definitely take out the blood soul Flower for you, “Eli said.

“Me too,” Rawls also hurriedly expressed his loyalty.

Kratos was their supporter in the White Tower, and he also bore the identity of their protection umbrella, which could save them a lot of trouble. At least 50% of the reason Herman had been safe for so many years was his credit.

So, as long as there was no danger, Eli would retrieve the blood soul Flower for him. Of course, if there were any danger, he would just let it be.

As for Rawls, he would definitely do his best to defeat Eli in front of Kratos.

“Yes.” Kratos looked at his two loyal subordinates with satisfaction, who had followed him since they were apprentices.

“Does my Lord know the exact location of the blood soul Flower?” Eli asked.

“Of course. This is the general map of the place. I’ve recorded it.”

“A map? Didn’t they already give one out before?” Rawls was puzzled. They had already sent out a map before.

“That’s a simplified version.” Kratos cast a glance at him and took out two maps.

Eli took out the one that was distributed at the square earlier and opened it to compare. ‘Good Lord, this castration is too outrageous.’

The previous map only had the names of the buildings, but some places on this new map even indicated the resources and the possible dangers. There was even a rating.

“As team leaders, this is the map that you should have obtained. This place seems to be the location of the blood soul Flower.” Kratos said as he pointed at a place.

Eli immediately understood. This was their exclusive ” leader ” map, so the others had a simplified version.

It could only be said that there was differential treatment everywhere!

That was all they had to say.

After the conversation ended, Eli and Rawls returned to their original seats. Rawls stared at Eli with a burning gaze as if he was saying that he would find the blood soul Flower in advance.

Eli glanced at Rawls and closed his eyes.

Just like that, the giant Eagle carried the warlocks of the White Tower and flew toward the target location.
