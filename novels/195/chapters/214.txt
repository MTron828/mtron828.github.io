215 Dream of the Lost Butterfly

Herman?

Mason was stunned!

As an old rival of the White Tower, they were one of the few forces that knew who was in charge of the White Tower. He also knew that the core of the White Tower had always been one person, and that was Herman, who was the person in front of him.

But why was he here?

Did he come to the wrong place?

No, this is the Forest of Death, the territory of the house of the undead!

Eli’s sudden appearance stunned Nikola, and he took the opportunity to leave. He flew behind Eli and said, “My Lord!”

Hearing this, Mason’s eyes widened even more. What was going on? Why did Nikola address Herman as his Lord? Could it be that Herman was the actual controller of the house of the undead?

Mason’s eyes became serious as he stared at Herman.

He didn’t expect the house of the undead to be in cahoots with Herman. It turned out that the chaotic scene from before was just an act for them to see. The real South West Coast had already fallen into the hands of this man.

“Herman, you’ve played us like a fool!” Mason said coldly as he looked at Eli.

“It’s just that you guys are too stupid!” Eli shook his head and looked at Mason. This was also his first time facing a third-circle warlock.

“Stupid? No, as long as I kill all of you, no one will know!” Mason shook his head and looked at Eli. “if I were you, I would’ve run away just now instead of jumping out!

“Are you seeking your own death?”

Mason’s mouth slowly opened. The information about advancing to the third ring was top secret, and no one outside of Black Isotta and Bloodline Tower should know about it. Besides, Nikola had fallen to the second ring again. He really didn’t know why Herman was so brave.

Eli only smiled and didn’t answer.

He had a better understanding of Mason from his observation just now. He should only be at the beginning of his third circle. Because of his good bloodline, his elemental attraction force should be four times better than normal.

“You laughed?” Mason was dumbfounded. What the hell was going on? How dare you laugh?

In just an instant, Mason’s anger surged. He took a deep breath, and a huge Dragon’s might was instantly released, pressing down on Eli. This was his third-circle bloodline power, and it had a terrifying suppression effect on low-level bloodlines and warlocks. It might not have been strong against Nikola, who was third circle just now, but now that he was in the second circle, the situation was completely different.

However, to his surprise, as soon as he released his aura, an even more powerful aura was released from Herman’s body. It was also a Dragon’s might, but it was different from a mixed Dragon like him. It was a higher-grade giant dragon’s bloodline.

Bang! Bang!

It was as if two powerful auras had collided, and many of the undead swayed left and right from the impact. A clear boundary appeared in the air, and in just a few seconds, he was suppressed.

For a moment, he felt that his strength had been reduced by 30%.

He was being suppressed?

Another Dragon bloodline?

Mason felt a shadow-like pressure on him, and he felt uncomfortable all over. He looked at Eli with a strange expression. This guy definitely wasn’t at the second circle. He was in the third circle, and he had a powerful Dragon bloodline at that. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Mason instantly ran away without any hesitation.

The situation was getting out of hand. Besides, he had a feeling that he might not be able to defeat Eli. Otherwise, how could he be so calm? But what made him feel strange was that Herman seemed to just watch him leave and did not stop him.

“Are you an idiot?” Mason felt strange, but he was getting faster and faster.

But a few seconds later, when he turned his head again and saw Herman and Nikola dozens of meters away, he fell silent.

What was going on?

Why was he still here?

He continued to run, and after more than ten seconds, he was still in the same place.

Mason’s face darkened as he realized that something was wrong. He looked around, then at Herman, and said with a serious expression, ” space-type bloodline talent? ”

He couldn’t figure out how a Warlock below the third ring could obtain such a talent. Space and time had always been exclusive to celestial. However, celestial was gone from this world already.

Mason shook his head and looked at the two people who didn’t seem to speak. He suddenly thought of another possibility!

“Not good!”

Mason’s eyes widened, and he suddenly looked frightened. He seemed to have understood something.

In an instant, all the blood in his body was ignited. A huge force stimulated his body, but there was still no change. Then, he took out a sharp blade and began to cut his body. In the blink of an eye, his body was covered with wounds.

With these stimuli, his vision started to blur, and the space in front of him started to shatter.

“Illusion, I knew it!” Mason finally smiled.

Illusions were rare among warlocks, but he had encountered them before. However, this was the first time he had encountered someone as powerful as Eli. He was confused for a moment. A Dragon that was good at illusions? What kind of spell was this?

Just like that, with a smile on his face, the environment around him finally cleared.

But the next second, he was stunned!

At this moment, Herman’s body was covered in scales, and his eyes had turned golden. At the same time, a large amount of shadow energy had gathered into a black ball in front of him, and terrifying power was gathering within it.

“You’re finally out!”

Then, he heard a surprised voice, and a black light flashed in front of him.

Bang! Bang!

In an instant, the black ball flew toward him. In an instant, a large amount of darkness enveloped him. A beam of black light pierced through him, and the power contained in it exploded. He didn’t even feel any pain before he disappeared into the air.

At least in the blink of an eye, Mason had disappeared.

A third circle warlock was gone, just like that.

Mason was dead!

Beside Eli, Nikola’s soul was trembling as he looked at the terrifying black light that covered a dozen meters in front of him. Mason had actually died from a single attack!

Eli had just advanced?!

...

The difference was too great. As expected of his master.

Nikola sighed with emotion and was even more in awe of Eli.

However, Nikola was also confused because Mason was stabbing himself before he was annihilated. Nikola had a vague guess because there seemed to be a fluctuation in Eli’s spiritual power earlier.

..

“Not bad!”

Looking at Mason, who had been destroyed by the shadow dragon’s breath, Eli pursed his lips. This gifted bloodline wizard was not bad.

He only discovered this after he broke through to the third ring. He thought he didn’t have an innate spell, but he found out that he still had one.

Using the massive shadow and corrosive power to create a powerful sphere and then attack. This was the strongest attack that Eli had at the moment.

Of course, he had also used a new spell on Mason.

That illusion was not the new sorcery that Eli had learned recently, the dream of the lost butterfly.

It was a charm spell. It was a spell that had a wide range of applications. It was also a type of spell that Eli had been lacking. It just so happened to make up for his shortcomings.

...

This was his first time using it but the effect was not bad.

A true third-circle warlock was much weaker than he had imagined.

“My Lord, I knew you would make a move!”

Nikola said as he looked at Eli with admiration.

“Of course.” Eli nodded. He did not have the heart to tell him that he had observed for a long time before confirming that there was no danger.

It was his first time facing a real third-circle warlock, so he had to be more cautious. He had used all his strength to show respect to his opponent. He just didn’t expect Mason to be so weak that he couldn’t even take one blow.

And there was another problem.

“Damn, why is it all gone?”

Looking at Mason, who had completely disappeared, Eli sighed.

There was no point in a battle without any gains!

I’ve lost so much!

Eli sighed, turned around, and left. His figure quickly disappeared.

Nikola stood still and was about to leave too. Suddenly, a wave of mind power appeared in the air where Mason died. Nikola turned around.

In the air.

A human face slowly appeared. It was Kloss.

Kloss’ face appeared, and he looked around. Within a few hundred meters, he could only see Nikola not far away. He immediately looked at Nikola, and his expression slowly became angry as he shouted, “Nikola!!!”

Hearing the voice, Nikola blinked his eyes and looked dumbfounded.

What was it this time?
