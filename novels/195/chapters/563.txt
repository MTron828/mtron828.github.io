564 Bully

Northern Region

It used to be a prosperous place. There were a lot of ore resources here, which brought them a lot of wealth. At its peak, even the Warlock Alliance would not go there.

But now, the dark clouds of war loomed over this place, and the thick fog of death in the sky made everyone feel even more pressured.

The front line!

Millions of Warlocks stood guard while a large number of Liches were staring at them with bloodthirsty and cruel eyes.

Behind the battle line, Vivika was flying high in the sky. There were more than 20 fifth-circle warlocks around her. All of them had serious expressions on their faces as they stared at the Liches in the distance.

Behind the Lich, two god-like figures stood in the shadows. One was a bone dragon that was tens of thousands of meters long and was surrounded by bone-chilling flames. The other was tall and had two tusks that seemed to pierce through the sky. Both of them looked down at them.

“Calamity Lich and Bone Dragon Lich!” Everyone looked bitter.

Just yesterday, the Lich Tower had broken through four lines of defense of the Bloodline Tower, and this was the newest one. Everyone had rushed over from all over the Towers.

However, when everyone saw the two behemoths, they understood that they were definitely not their match.

“I’m afraid I’m going to die here today!” a fifth circle warlock said unwillingly.

“Sigh, the two of them are too strong. We’re far from being a match for them. Why hasn’t Master Eli come yet?”

“Uh, is it possible that you also feel that he’s not a match for them?”

They all muttered in a low voice, and the final voice made everyone’s spirits rise.

It wasn’t that they hadn’t thought about this. It was simply too hopeless.

Suddenly, the shadow in front of them began to dissipate. With a wave of soul fluctuations, everyone felt a chill in their hearts. Meanwhile, the Liches on the opposite side had already let out a roar and rushed toward the Warlocks.

“It’s starting!”

Everyone reacted.

At this time, the Liches on the ground in the distance collided with the Warlock. Suddenly, the battlefield raised a bloody mist. In the sky, a large number of celestial Liches had begun to fight.

Vivika took a look and also began to envelop herself with elements, instantly creating a gust of wind and killing a large number of liches. However, the fifth circle liches were indifferent.

Weng!

Suddenly, the fog in the distance receded like a tide. A ten-thousand-meter-long bone dragon slowly flew out of it, emitting an icy aura that instantly froze the battlefield.

Roar!

Accompanied by a dragon’s roar, he looked at everyone and said mockingly, “The Lich Tower actually sent out these people. They really look down on me!”

His tone made the fifth-circle warlocks feel a chill run down their spines, and they were furious!

“Bone Dragon Lich, don’t be too arrogant.” One of the Warlocks shouted angrily, and a flame attack flew toward him.

Weng!

The flames tore through the sky and illuminated the fog, but the Bone Dragon Lich only smiled. A layer of gray fog wrapped around its body.

The gray fog wrapped around the flames, and the flames actually dissipated.

“Is that all?” he mocked him.

“Everyone, let’s attack together. Otherwise, we’ll all die here today!” The Warlock’s expression was ugly. He then looked at the people around him. A dozen of them nodded, and a few of them even took half a step back.

“Cowards!” He cursed but ignored them.

In the face of difficulties, there were people who stood up, and naturally, there were people who retreated.

“Let’s do it, everyone!” He shouted and flew towards the sky. The dozen or so Warlocks nodded, but the others turned around and flew back.

They actually chose to run away!

“Hahahaha!” The Bone Dragon Lich laughed loudly when it saw this.

However, the gazes of the dozen or so fifth-circle warlocks gradually became determined. Their bloodlines surged, and attacks condensed in front of them. Flames, lightning, storms…

A large amount of blood circulation caused the surrounding air to distort.

However, the Bone Dragon Lich remained calm, as if it did not care.

“Now!”

The Warlock shouted loudly, and dozens of attacks flew toward the Bone Dragon.

However, in the next second, the bone dragon opened its mouth, and a layer of invisible gray fog rippled. Then, it actually swallowed more than ten attacks at the same time without causing any damage.

“Too weak!” He shook his head, and his figure flashed. In the blink of an eye, he arrived in front of the Warlocks.

A claw!

Weng!

A Warlock exploded into a bloody mist, and a large amount of blood fell to the ground.

On the ground, the Liches were shocked when they saw this scene. The Calamity Lich in the distance also smiled. This scene has happened many times. The difference in combat power could not be made up for by numbers.

The next step would be the slaughter!

The Bone Dragon Lich was also very fast. In the blink of an eye, it arrived in front of another Warlock and clawed at him. The Warlock immediately felt despair. He could not see any hope.

But suddenly, an inexplicable feeling enveloped him. He quickly retreated, and it was not just him. The dozens of Warlocks around him also did the same, flying backward in unison.

Weng!

On the other side, the dragon claw tore through space, but it did not catch anyone.

The Bone Dragon Lich was stunned and looked up.

At this moment, a figure had unknowingly appeared in front of the Warlocks.

The scarlet sorcerer’s robe fluttered in the wind. A sorcerer’s book in one hand and a staff in the other. The power of faith behind him emitted a soft light that dispelled the coldness around him.

He gently waved his staff, and a layer of light instantly covered the surrounding tens of thousands of miles!

The fog was instantly dispersed, and the air was filled with the aura of light.

Even the Liches felt as if they were being suppressed. The bone dragon even shook its body as if the aura was making it uncomfortable!

Of course, it was only for a moment because its attention was focused on the person who suddenly appeared. In an instant, the Calamity Lich from afar also walked over.

“Eli!” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

The two Liches shouted at the same time and looked at the person who had arrived.

Eli!

This name seemed to have magical power. In an instant, everyone’s battle stopped. They looked up at the sky and focused their gazes on that figure, that figure that was like a god.

The master of the Bloodline Tower, Eli!

Eli ignored their stares and threw the escaping Warlocks to Nikola, who had come with him. “Control them!”

“Yes, sir!” Nikola nodded, but his heart was filled with emotions.

The Lord’s appearance was becoming more and more powerful.

“Eli, I didn’t expect you to dare to come.” In the distance, the Bone Dragon Lich looked at Eli, the Soul Fire in its eyes burning.

“There are only two weaklings here. Why wouldn’t I dare to come?”

Eli looked at them and raised his eyebrows.

Weaklings?

The Bone Dragon Lich’s eyes instantly froze, and his soul fire could not help but rise and fall.

Looking at Eli, he couldn’t take it anymore. He gritted his teeth and said, “Eli, do you think that we are still the same as before? Go to hell!”

In the next second, the Bone Dragon’s huge body rushed toward Eli, stirring up the endless gray fog. Powerful soul flames quickly covered its entire body, emitting a terrifying aura.

Even the Fifth circle warlock felt a chill from this aura!

“Can you block it?” In the distance, the Calamity Lich sneered.

They were now liches of the Laws, and they were much stronger than before!

But in the next second.

“You are very brave!” Eli gently waved his staff!

A shadow spread out like an ocean and flew toward the bone dragon.

“Watch me tear apart your shadow!” The Bone Dragon Lich said cruelly and gradually became bloodthirsty!

His dragon claw stretched out and tore at the shadow.

Hiss!

The dragon claw collided with the shadow, but the expected cold feeling did not appear. Instead, the dragon claw entered the shadow, and an obscure feeling came from it.

The lich saw the shadow devour it as if it had encountered a delicacy. A corrosive aura even caused cracks to appear on his bones!

“No, no, how is this possible? No, spare me…”

The Bone Dragon’s wail spread throughout the battlefield, and all the Liches felt a chill run down their spines.

This was especially true for the Calamity Lich in the distance, who could only watch helplessly as the Bone Dragon melted into the shadows like a bubble, and its aura gradually weakened.

In just a few seconds, the Bone Dragon Lich died!

“How is this possible?” The Lich of Calamity was stunned. He couldn’t accept it!

Eli just looked at him and calmly said, “Your turn!”

Kakaka!

The Calamity Lich’s body stiffened, and a cold feeling spread throughout his body!

It was terrifying!
