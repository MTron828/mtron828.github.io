205 Murloc Tribe

As soon as he entered the ocean, the coldness of the sea water made Eli shiver. He looked towards the ocean.

His golden vertical pupils were like a weak candle flame in the darkness, allowing him to easily see the scene thousands of meters away. As he went deeper, his surroundings slowly revealed themselves.

It was vast and tiny. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

That was the first thought that came to Eli’s mind.

!!

In the ocean, he felt like a tiny fish. The vastness of the endless sea was even more shocking. Even he could only see a part of the scenery, but even that part made his trip worthwhile.

In the deep blue sea, there were whirlpools at the bottom of the sea, and there were all kinds of fish swimming in other places. Some were as small as a finger, while others were magical beasts that were more than ten meters long and emitted powerful auras.

Compared to the creatures on land, the creatures in the ocean weren’t very intelligent. Even if they were in the second or third circle, most of them relied on instinct to move.

Eli was swimming among these creatures. The creatures around him sensed his aura but did not approach him.

At this time, Eli’s appearance was completely different from before. With the faceless mask and the mimicry ability of the power of shadow, he transformed into a three to four-meter-long fish creature. His pair of golden eyes blinked constantly as he moved toward his target.

He was getting further and further away from the shore, and the surrounding environment was getting more and more complicated. After passing through a large coral Bush, Eli officially stepped into the territory of the murloc tribe.

Eli’s disguised body moved gracefully, his eyes looking down.

At the bottom of the sea, there was a large forest of rock pillars, each of which was at least tens of meters high. No one knew how they were formed, but there were various shellfish attached to the surface, and the area was very large, no smaller than the White Tower.

The murlocs were scattered in the forest of rock pillars.

Soon, Eli saw the first murloc.

It was a creature with the body of a human and the head of a fish. It was about a meter tall, with two dead fish eyes on its head, followed by a few tentacles and sharp teeth. Its body was covered with scales, and there was mucus on the scales, which allowed it to move quickly in the ocean.

Of course, as an intelligent creature, the murloc that Eli saw was even wearing armor made from shells, holding a bone spear in his hand, and his aura had also reached the level of a first circle.

“A murloc at the first ring!”

The area that Eli was currently in was the outskirts of the territory. After all, murlocs in the first ring rarely appeared, and this made Eli feel that something was amiss.

Thus, he decided to follow the murloc to see what was going on.

To Eli’s surprise, the murloc seemed to be swimming toward the outside after leaving the tribe. It would even turn its head every five meters as if it was careful of something.

Eli thought for a moment and followed, and the murloc didn’t notice Eli either. Fish like Eli was the most common in the area, and they were everywhere.

Soon, he saw the murloc burrow into another reef.

..

“This should be the place.” Ro the murloc spat out a series of air bubbles and looked around.

This place was not very close to the murloc territory, and this was the place they had agreed to meet at.

“I don’t want to do this, but the offer is too tempting. With those resources, I’ll be able to break through to the second circle. At worst, I’ll just join another camp. I might even have a chance to play with merfolk.” As Ro the murloc was lost in his thoughts, he swam towards the reef, not noticing that a fish in the higher level of the ocean was looking at him.

Soon, Ro arrived at a hidden reef.

“Aren’t they here yet?” Ro looked around him, then closed his eyes and waited.

“There’s something wrong with this murloc.” Eli looked down at Ro from above. He definitely didn’t have good intentions for coming here.

At this moment, he suddenly sensed a wave of water element fluctuations in the distance.

In the waves, a creature that looked like a killer whale swam over quickly.

“An intelligent race, devil killer whale.” Eli took a look and was a little surprised.

This creature rarely appeared here. They should be creatures that existed even further away from the coast. Their sudden appearance here should be related to the murloc.

Sure enough, the devil killer whale swam over and directly entered the reef, swimming directly towards the murloc.

A curious expression appeared on Eli’s face, and he began to observe even more seriously.

..

“Lord Whale.”

The murloc opened its eyes at this moment, and its eyes brightened when it saw the approaching devil killer whale.

“Ro!” The devil killer whale had already arrived, and his voice was somewhat muffled as he said, “We’re ready to make our move. How are your preparations?”

“My Lord, I’m ready.” Ro nodded, but there was some hesitation on his face. “My Lord, is the situation at the outer seas this harsh? Now, even Lord’s race is preparing to come here.”

“Hmph, ever since those terrifying Magi left, the entire world has been changing. You have no idea how many races are developing in the endless sea. Your race is only living along the coast, but you’re already under a lot of pressure, not to mention the outer seas. The battles there are even crueler. The deep seas is another story.”The devil killer whale explained.

“But we’re not going to leave that place. It’s better to be safe than sorry. We’re planning to occupy a piece of land here to prepare for the future.”

“I see!” Ro indicated that he understood.

“Don’t worry. You won’t regret joining us. Although we can’t come here directly, as long as we succeed, I’ll probably stay here. I’ll give you your resources when we take action.” The whale explained.

“thank you, my Lord.” Ro’s eyes lit up.

Didn’t he join them just for this?!

As for the other things, he didn’t really understand. As for the situation of the outside world that the whale talked about, he was even less interested. He was just a small murloc. What could he do?

“Then, my Lord, when do we make our move?”

“Tomorrow, I guess.”

“Tomorrow?”

“Right!” The whale said with certainty. He stared at Ro with his huge eyes and said, “There aren’t many of us here, so we only have one chance. We have to be quick, or it’ll be troublesome if the other forces notice this. After all, our main force hasn’t arrived here yet.

“you can start preparing when you get back. Be careful not to be discovered.”

“Yes.” Ro nodded heavily.

“Alright, then you can go back first. We’ll act according to the time tomorrow.” The whale nodded, then its huge body quickly left the sea. The aura of the second-circle creature made the surrounding creatures quickly disperse.

...

“Tomorrow?” Ro glanced at his surroundings and quickly left.

“It’s a good thing I came to take a look.”

On the reef, Eli looked at the two creatures leaving. He took a deep breath and spat out a string of bubbles.

Although he had already investigated and made ample preparations, this was beyond this expectation.

“But this might not be bad news.” Eli thought.

There were actually two biggest problems for him in stealing the water elemental fruits. One was how to sneak into their plantation, and the other was how not to be discovered or how to leave after being discovered.

Eli’s methods were sufficient, and he was very confident, but there was still a certain risk after all.

However, if the devil killer whales invaded, then most of the murlocs’ power would definitely be drawn away, which would make it easier for him to achieve his goal, which was a good thing.

So, Eli decided to postpone the time to tomorrow. After all, the ocean wasn’t his home field, so he naturally had to choose a time with a greater chance for his success. He had already been delayed for so long, so he could wait for one more day.

There was something the killer whale said that attracted Eli’s attention too. It was about the situation at the endless sea. When the mages were still around, no race dared to cause trouble. However, with the departure of the mages, new changes were taking place in the ocean, affecting all kinds of living creatures.

And this was only the situation at sea. What about the many creatures in the sky and on land? Although warlocks were still the Masters, they were much weaker than the mages of the past. They might not be able to manage this world well.

...

Eli predicted that it would still be normal for a few thousand years, but it would be hard to say anything after that.

“We’ll take one step at a time.”

Suddenly, Eli laughed.

He realized that he seemed to be thinking too far ahead. He should think about advancing to the third circle first.

But was it really that far?

A thousand years, ten thousand years, it didn’t seem to be long.
