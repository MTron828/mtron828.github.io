Chapter 50: Ten Months

In the dark courtyard, standing on the clean ground in between the pools of blood, Eli’s mood was slightly different.

He didn’t feel anything when he killed just now, but now he had a strange feeling. He didn’t feel any discomfort. Perhaps it was the absolute rationality of being a mage.

There was no pain, regret, or any other unnecessary emotion. Even the joy of getting off work early today seemed to be stronger than this.

“Being too rational is not necessarily a good thing!” Eli sighed and started searching the body.

Wasn’t it normal to kill and loot corpses?

In the end, Eli found more than fifty gold tarls on the two of them, as well as a Knight’s skill book. Eli was surprised to find that.

He did not have any thoughts about becoming a knight, but he felt that he could have a deeper understanding of knights through this book. Eli was very happy.

After that, Eli left immediately.

As for Herman, he would just leave him here.

When he woke up, he would definitely be very surprised.

…

The next afternoon, the imperial police found Herman in the abandoned house.

According to Herman, he woke up in the afternoon and saw that scene. He was tied up, so he almost crawled out of there before he was discovered.

No one knew how Herman felt that day.

However, that night, Herman also learned from the Imperial Police that Windsor and David were repeat offenders, which made him feel ashamed.

Hence, on the fourth day at work, Herman said that he would take on more work in the future, which was a pleasant surprise for eli.

Herman had a strong tolerance, so he quickly got over the incident. It was said that he met a nurse in the hospital, and they seemed to have fallen in love.

This time, it was normal. she was just an ordinary girl.

The two of them were preparing to get married a year later. Of course, this was a story for later.

As for who had killed Windsor and David, no one cared.

At first, the police wanted to investigate, but there were no clues, so they gave up. No one cared about the life and death of two repeat offenders.

As for Scholar Clement, he had gone to a noble he was familiar with to ask for help, but the noble didn’t care much. After some running around, Clement found Herman at the imperial police station.

As for Eli…

He went home to sleep. After all, this matter had nothing to do with him.

…

Herman’s matter had come to an end.

On the other side of the empire, a storm was suddenly brewing.

No one knew where the news came from, but the king’s health was on the verge of collapse. Suddenly, Jun Lin City and the whole kingdom became unstable.

The commoners loved the current king, and when he was the king, the Empire had been developing well. No one knew what would happen if he died.

Of course, compared to them, the surrounding countries were also very concerned about this matter.

The most obvious feeling was that there were many more foreigners in Junlin. No one knew what purpose they had in Junlin.

As for Eli, he went to and from work as usual.

He would consume a bottle of khorium no. 1 every once in a while, and his mental strength was also growing. However, he could clearly feel that his resistance to this potion was getting stronger and stronger. It might not be long before it would be useless.

He had also carefully read through the knight’s book that he had found on David.

He found out that the advancement of a Grand Knight actually required the integration of elements. However, it did not record how they integrated elements. This should be a secret, so he did not spend too much effort on it.

Half a year later, Eli received a piece of news from his teacher.

Perhaps due to diplomatic considerations, the empire decided to visit the neighboring countries to establish a deeper connection.

There would be a marquis of the empire leading the team, along with some knights, musicians, scholars, and so on. they would visit and interact with each other to establish friendship between the two countries.

As for who would lead the team, who would be brought, and where the visit would be, those were all classified information.

But eli knew very well that this matter wouldn’t be delayed for too long.

He reckoned that this was the king’s last plan to pave the way for the first prince before his death.

Of course, this matter had nothing to do with Eli and the others.

First of all, it was impossible for the visiting group to bring him, an ordinary librarian, along. Even if he were to go, he would definitely be going with his teacher.

However, with how low-key Scholar Clement usually was, it was almost impossible for him to be chosen.

Although this was only a diplomatic activity, it was a good promotion for scholars. Many famous scholars and even Grand scholars would fight for it.

It really wasn’t that Eli was looking down on her teacher.

Scholar clement was a slacker among the scholars. Perhaps he was old and knew that he couldn’t compete, so he just did his own thing.

It could be said that clement was the most low-key scholar among all the scholars.

Even if there were activities outside, they almost didn’t participate unless they were forced to.

Regarding this, Eli didn’t care.

This was also good.

…

At the same time, in the palace, the pale-faced King Bryne the sixth sat on the throne. There were two guards on both sides of him, and below him stood a man who did not look any younger than the king.

” Marquis Alina, you should know that even though the kingdom is doing well now, after my death, whether it is the rats within the empire or the jackals outside the empire, they will all make their move.

“At this time, we need more friends to help us. This time, I will send you to the Lorraine Kingdom to establish an alliance with them.”

“yes!” marquis Alina also raised his head to look at the king.

This man, who used to be a peak grand knight, had become like this. It was really sad.

It was almost impossible for even a Grand Knight to penetrate the enemy’s camp and kill the Duke of Frostwolf, but he had done it. It was simply unimaginable.

“Alright, then you can leave. The members have already been decided, but if you want to change, it’s up to you.” the king waved his hand, signaling for marquis Alina to leave.

The two of them had known each other for many years and were already very familiar with each other.

“yes.” Marquis Alina didn’t waste any time and left.

After Marquis Alina left, the king gestured for the two guards to leave. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Not long after, another man walked in.

He was wearing a loose scholar’s robe, had a head of white hair, black eyes, and a strong body.

“Ash, you don’t have much time left.” the man said.

“I know!” The king, Ash, coughed twice, and a mouthful of blood flowed out. “There’s an item left behind by my ancestors. It can only be used by consuming my flesh and blood. It’s really terrifying. I’m clearly a Grand Knight, but after using it, I can explode with power far stronger than a Grand Knight.” Said the king helplessly.

“If you hadn’t mastered that power called spiritual power and wanted to use it, it would have been impossible. So you paid the price.” the man looked at the king and shook his head.

“Haha, that’s true,” Bryne the sixth smiled and asked, ” “are you still looking for that power?”

” of course, since Saleen came from the outside, there must be a place famous for having ‘mages’. I have been looking for it, but I have not found it. ” The man shook his head.

“Stop finding, or you might end up getting killed.” Bryne the sixth said with a chuckle.

“If that’s the case, I’ll just accept it.” The man shook his head and said.

“Also, your eldest son has been trying to meddle in the library recently. I won’t allow that to happen.”

“Haha, okay, I’ll warn him. But after I die, I probably won’t be able to intimidate him for long. After all, he’s the future king.” a smile appeared on Ash’s pale face.

It was no secret that the king had a good relationship with the head of the library.

“Okay, I’ll be leaving then. Take care of yourself”. The man took one last look at the king and left.

Finally, in the empty Palace, only Bryne the sixth was left on the iron throne.
