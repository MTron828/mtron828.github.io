237 Jin Ji

The Golden cicada Chamber of Commerce was different from ordinary forces. If the other forces were similar to academies and sects, then the Golden cicada Chamber of Commerce was like an Alliance formed by merchants.

As a Chamber of Commerce, the first characteristic was naturally that they had money and resources. With these, the Chamber of Commerce had gathered many powerhouses, which was why they were not weak. The West Coast was only a small branch of their Chamber of Commerce.

This was also Eli’s destination. If there were a place that was most likely to buy the recipe, it would be here.

“Good day, my Lord!”

!!

As soon as he reached the door, two maids welcomed him. Whether it was their beautiful faces or pointed ears, it was clear that they were not human, but elves.

“An elf as a maid, how intriguing!”

Eli clicked his tongue. As a great civilization that was once a subordinate of the mages, the elves were good at natural energy and were a good helper to help with the work of dealing with magic herbs and plants. But they were actually treated as maidservants here.

Ignoring the two elves, Eli walked straight through the Golden Door.

“Hey, good day, my Lord!”

A young man came up to him the moment he entered.

He looked very capable and experienced. He didn’t look very old and had zero-circle strength. He wore black clothes with golden spots all over. His eyes were bright and he looked very alert.

“My Lord, my name is Jin Ji. What can I do for you? I’m not joking, the Golden Toad Merchant House will definitely be able to help you find what you need. Even if it’s not available here, we can even transfer it from the central continent. Of course, the price will be much higher!” The young man said with a smile.

“Oh!” Eli frowned. He didn’t expect the Chamber of Commerce to be so powerful.

“I need some information on the formula of a 3rd circle magic potion. Do you have it here? ” Eli asked directly without interrupting.

“Third circle?

“Master, I don’t think I’m qualified to sell the information on the third circle. I’ll have to ask the manager. How about I take you to the lounge first, and then I’ll call the manager? You’ll have to wait a few minutes. Is that okay?”

Jin Ji said quickly, his words accurate and polite.

“Of course!” Eli nodded.

“My Lord, follow me!” Jin Ji stretched out his hand to guide, and Eli followed him.

As he walked, he looked around.

Perhaps it was because it was called the Golden cicada Chamber of Commerce, the first floor was also made of gold and resplendent. The counters were inlaid with gold, and there were all kinds of materials on display. There were many precious items among them, some of which even Eli had never seen before.

“Is my lord interested in these magic plants?” Jin Ji chatted as he walked.

Eli nodded.

Soon, Eli was led to the second floor, which was different from the first floor. There were rooms here, and a guard was leading a first-circle Warlock into a room on the left.

Soon, Jin ji led Eli through the room and to the end, where there was an even bigger room.

“Sir, you wait here. I’ll go find the store manager.” Jin ji led Eli in, then opened the cabinet and made a cup of tea for him.

It was a luxurious room, and Eli had never seen anything more luxurious than this. Even Vivika’s room was far inferior. At least, he had never seen a carpet made from the fur of a third-circle magical beast.

Sitting on the sofa made of some unknown leather, Eli took the tea from jin ji and took a sip, feeling a slight increase in his spiritual power.

“Is the Golden cicada Chamber of Commerce so generous?”

Eli was slightly shocked, and he turned to look at Jin ji’s back as he left.

As if he had suddenly seen something interesting, he blew on the tea again and took a small sip.

“It’s really good!”

..

“Are you crazy? You actually brought an unfamiliar guest into Room 1!”

As soon as Jin Ji left the room, a guard pulled him to a corner and questioned him.

“I have my own judgment!” Jin Ji glanced at the guard and said.

“Hmph, who can enter room No. 1? They have to be at least a third-circle warlock, but you just randomly dragged someone in. I know you want to get the resources to advance to the first circle, but there’s no need to bet like this. You’re crazy!” This guard looked about the same age as Jin Ji.

“Looks like you’re going to be driven away this time!” The guard shook his head and sneered.

“You don’t have to worry about that. I have to go to the store manager first!” Jin Ji glanced at him and left.

The Chamber of Commerce did have such a rule, but if he didn’t advance now, he wouldn’t have a chance.

Moreover, he had a special ability since he was young. He seemed to be able to see through a person’s disguise, even if it was the store manager. However, he couldn’t see through the person today, so he felt that this might be an extraordinary opportunity.

One successful transaction would allow him to accumulate a lot of resources.

“tsk, not all toads are golden toads!” The guard cast a glance at Jin Ji. He was clearly a guard, but he seemed to have great ambitions. It was really disgusting!

Why do people have to have unrealistic goals?

..

Eli had just finished a third of his tea when jin ji returned with a middle-aged man.

It was a chubby-looking man in a black tuxedo. He had a beard and a warm smile on his face. His eyes were golden.

“Hello, I’m the manager here, I’m Jin Huan!”

The man reached out his hand and walked over.

Eli put down his tea and stood up to shake hands with him.

“Third circle!” The moment they shook hands, Jin Huan instantly sensed Eli’s strength, and his eyes lit up. He was initially very unhappy that jin ji was looking for him. After all, how could these apprentices be able to judge the level of warlocks with first circle and above? but now, it seemed like he was right.

“Jin Ji, you can leave first.” Jin Huan said as he glanced at Jin Ji.

“Yes!” Jin Ji still had a smile on his face as he silently retreated outside the door. He then closed the door and began to close it, but he clenched his fists in his heart!

It seemed that he had made the right bet.

...

..

“my Lord, I heard from Jin ji that you want the 3rd-circle potion formula. ”

After shaking hands, Jin Huan sat opposite Eli and asked.

“Yes, is there any difficulty?” Eli glanced at Jin Huan. He was also a third-circle warlock. It seemed like he had underestimated this Chamber of Commerce.

“No. The formulas are not worth much!” Jin Huan laughed.

“It’s not worth much!” Eli was silent for a moment.

Sometimes, he would feel that he was not in sync with the warlocks, as if he was not on the same frequency as them. Were 3rd circle potion formulas not valuable?

As if reading Eli’s question, Jin Huan explained, “My Lord, if the magic potion formula were to be placed in the Mage world, it would naturally be very precious.

“However, there were very few warlocks nowadays who were even at the 2nd circle, let alone 3rd circle apothecaries. As time passed, the value of a 3rd circle formula naturally decreased.

“Could it be that you are a 3rd circle pharmacist?”

“Of course not. I just need to study it!” Eli shook his head.

...

It seemed to be true. The bloodline tower was a huge force, but Jin Huan heard that there was only one Warlock who could barely make second-circle potions. It could only be said that they were skilled in different areas.

But this was a good thing for Eli.

“Do you have any specific requirements? Each formula is sold for 1200 magic crystals.” Jin Huan thought and said.

“1200 magic stones?”

Hearing the prices of the dishes, Eli’s eyes widened.

‘It’s still too expensive. I knew it.’ Jin Huan looked at Eli’s expression and sighed. ‘After all, who would want these things?’ So he gritted his teeth and said, “How about this? 1000 stones per formula will do!”

Discount?

Eli suddenly felt the joy of being a mage in the Warlock world.

“Sure!” Eli nodded.

“Hmm, then how many do you want, my Lord? we don’t have that many in our inventory, only a dozen or so, all of which were once third-circle magic potion formulas from the Mage world!”

Jin Huan said as he took out a crystal ball and began searching, then handed it to Eli.

Eli took the crystal ball and soon frowned. Although they were all third-circle formulas, they were all pretty good, but none of them were the kind of potion he wanted.

“What’s wrong? is there nothing that my Lord needs?” Jin Huan asked. Even though this was probably a small business, a third-circle warlock was worth his time.

“yes, my bloodline power has been stagnant recently. I want to see if the mages have similar potion formulas to give me some inspiration.” Said Eli as he nodded.

“This is going to be difficult!” Jin Huan shook his head.

However, ten seconds later, he seemed to have thought of something. He looked at Eli and said, ” my Lord, if you really need it, I can contact the central continent. As for information, we have ways to get it directly, but you’ll have to pay a price.”

“I can pay more!” Eli said.

Golden hoop’s eyes brightened at the mention of more money, but he still frowned. “um, Sir, to be honest, we’re using a kind of special ore to build communication. However, our stock is running low.

“The problem is our mine has been occupied by a third circle primary stage demon bear. We’ve been at our wit’s end all this time. We currently have two third-circle early-stage warlocks. If we had three, we would be more stable, but we haven’t found a suitable candidate yet.”

At this point, Jin Huan slowly raised his head and said, Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“If my Lord can participate in this activity and help us kill that demonic bear, not only will we give what my Lord needs as a reward, but we can also give you more resources.”

A mission?

Eli frowned!

If that were the case, he would have to go out again!

However, the demonic bear that was only at the peak of the third circle early stage did not seem to be a big deal. The risk was very low. However, if he did not participate, he might not be able to get the formulas.

“Alright, I can join!” Eli finally agreed.

“Congratulations on joining!” Jin Huan smiled.
