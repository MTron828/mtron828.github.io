366 The End (3)

A 100-meter-tall four-headed snake appeared in its original position and was hissing toward the sky.

It really was a celestial!

Many Warlocks were stunned, especially those from the Bloodline Tower.

In the next second, everyone saw the giant snake charge into the sky like a warrior.

As for Radiant Moon Warlock Jalin, she smiled and got off the cloud whale. The power of her bloodline surrounded her as she attacked the Hydra. She didn’t need her avatar to deal with a micro star.

On the ground, on the ground, Arona smiled when he saw Hydra. A micro-star creature was meaningless.

He turned around and continued to attack the Warlocks of the Bloodline Tower. In just a few minutes, he had killed countless Warlocks. As for him, he didn’t even consume much of his bloodline power.

” Haha! ” Vya laughed loudly in the sky. ” I thought it was some powerful existence. It’s just a little snake that has just reached the fourth circle. ”

The hope on Glen’s face gradually dissipated.

Although he didn’t know where this giant snake came from, with Jalin around, it was meaningless.

He even took a glance. In just a few seconds, the giant snake had completely fallen to the ground. Other than its inexplicably high fighting spirit, it was not a match at all. It was likely that Jalin would be able to finish it off very quickly.

Of course, his situation was not much better. He was also at the end of his rope.

Despair instantly filled his mind.

On the ground, Alida, who was thrown out by Hydra, looked up at the sky with a dumbfounded expression.

He had clearly been motionless before, but why was he suddenly so active, even attacking Radiant Moon Warlock?!

This change was too fast. Lord Hydra should be very lazy!

Was there another reason?

Alida pondered, but in the next second, she seemed to understand something!

Pets would only show their best when their owners were around.

Alida’s heart began to beat rapidly as she became more and more certain of her guess.

At this moment, in the sky, following Jalin’s attack, a blood-red hand grabbed the Hydra, preventing it from escaping.

Jalin smiled and prepared to kill the giant snake.

In the next second, a shadow beam shot toward Jalin. Jalin was shocked and immediately let go of her hand to dodge.

The shadow beam brushed past her and directly hit the Sky Cloud Whale not far away.

Everyone only saw a black mushroom cloud appear in the sky. Accompanied by a terrifying explosion, the huge Sky Cloud Whale was directly blasted into countless pieces. Countless pieces of flesh and blood flew toward the ground. There was only a blood-colored fog in the sky.

The hundred-meter-long Sky Cloud Whale disappeared from everyone’s sight.

Everyone who saw this scene was stunned. Even a few celestials stopped.

“What the hell is that?!” On the ground, Arona felt the blood rain around him and was extremely shocked.

Even if it was him, it was absolutely impossible to directly cause the sky cloud whale to become like this.

In the sky.

Vya’s expression was serious. She felt that she might not be able to withstand that attack.

Even Jalin felt her breathing quicken.

“What exactly is it?” Everyone looked in the direction of where the beam came from.

Under the sunlight, three huge airships slowly flew over.

Looking at the airship, everyone’s eyes were solemn, but no one dared to move. They could only watch as the airships slowly approached.

Only Alida, who was far away, was so excited that tears flowed out. She had guessed correctly. His Excellency had arrived.

The airship was very fast. In the blink of an eye, it arrived above the battlefield. Under everyone’s gaze, Eli walked out of the airship.

Everyone looked at this person cautiously, especially the few celestials who were staring at Eli.

They were unable to sense Eli’s strength.

“Who are you?” Jalin looked at him and asked.

At this moment, Hydra, who was on the ground, had also shrunk its body and quickly arrived beside Eli.

“You’ve worked hard!” Eli touched Hydra and looked at Jalin. ” You must be the Mage of the Manticore Clan. You smell exactly like that Wellington, the smell of poison. ”

Jalin’s face darkened. What did he mean by smelly?

But when she heard Wellington’s name, she had a bad feeling.

“Who exactly are you? Why do you know Wellington?” She questioned again.

Eli had a strange look on his face. Didn’t they know about the ambush? He was wondering why it went so smoothly after the ambush.

“I see. It seems like that was Wellington’s private operation! “Eli shook his head and smiled. ” Let me introduce myself. I’m the Bloodline Tower’s West Coast Branch Tower Master, Eli. ”

West Coast? Branch tower master?

Everyone looked at Eli with strange expressions.

Everyone remained silent. No one spoke. Eli remained calm, but his gaze on Jalin gradually turned cold.

” Since no one is talking, I’ll say something. Lady, you just hurt my pet. Are you ready to compensate me? ”

“Compensation?” Jalin’s muscles tensed up.

“Yes, compensation.” Eli nodded and looked at Jalin with killing intent.

In an instant, killing intent swept across the entire battlefield like the autumn wind. Everyone felt a chill.

...

Jalin’s eyes also froze.

She felt uneasy.
