274 The Great Disparity

Perhaps it was because autumn was approaching, but the sky above Silver Moon Valley was once again covered in thick dark clouds. The entire sky was dark, and even the sunlight could only penetrate a little.

Above the river valley, Situ’s large body was standing on the head of a venom Wyvern while his eyes were observing the situation.

As far as his eyes could see, within ten miles, there were nearly a hundred venom Wyverns flapping their wings and roaring. On each of them, there were many warlocks that were fixed in place.

On the ground, there were thousands of warlocks gathered in an army. If one looked carefully, one could see that some of these people were surrounded. They were holding short black staffs in their hands, which exuded a strange aura.

!!

And this aura was connected to the other magic staves that were also held in the hands of other Warlocks!

These were their special weapons, which they had once obtained from the wizard ruins.

And their opponents were warlocks from the bloodline tower!

However, the configuration was a little different.

In the sky, there were only about 30 to 40 venom Wyverns. The rest of the area was occupied by gray-white shadows, exuding the unique aura of the undead.

They used the spirits of the dead to make up for the lack of air power.

In the past few years, this kind of thing had been very common and had caused them a lot of trouble. Fortunately, they were doing a ground fight today.

Although there were many warlocks on the bloodline tower’s side, they were still weaker than the Holy tower. This was due to the Holy tower’s suppression over the years!

This was reflected in the fact that the number of bloodlines tower warlocks was only three-quarters of the Holy tower’s, and the overall quality seemed to be slightly weaker. In order to make up for their combat power, Situ even saw many magical beasts being pulled into the battlefield!

This was a good sign. It meant that there weren’t enough people in the bloodline tower!

“It’s stable!”

After he finished observing, Situ revealed a smile!

“Situ, if we win this time, we can break through the bloodline tower’s defense and enter their territory. After fighting for so long, there’s finally some good news!”

A voice was heard. Situ turned his head and saw that it was Sancher.

“Indeed, and this time we also have the spell formation. These are all good things from the Mage era, and not many can be preserved until now. I believe the bloodline tower doesn’t have so many good things!” Situ smiled.

“Hahahaha, that’s true. It’s just a pity that we don’t have enough.”

“Those Mages are so powerful.” Sancher clicked his tongue and sighed.

“Hmph, so what? at least for now, we’re the ones in control of this world!” Situ smiled smugly, but he knew that if this were the Mage world of the past, he would be easily vanquished.

“It’s almost time. Prepare to attack.” Sancher changed the topic.

Situ nodded.

..

Compared to the optimistic side of the Holy tower, the atmosphere in the bloodline tower was undoubtedly a little heavy.

In the Army, the warlocks looked at the Holy tower warlocks in the distance, as well as the many venom Wyverns in the sky, and felt an inexplicable chill.

Whether it was quantity or quality, the Holy tower surpassed them!

“Can we really win?” John’s gaze was solemn as he clenched the staff in his hand!

He was a two-circle Warlock of the bloodline tower and had only joined the bloodline tower a few years ago. The reason for his joining was simple: The Holy tower had destroyed his family.

That’s right. He was the old man who was fishing with Eli by the river. Five years ago, when the war began, his family just happened to be on the way to the Holy tower, and then they were wiped out!

It was only after that that he found out who he had been fishing with!

Then, he came here for revenge and to survive.

However, he had still overestimated the bloodline tower. Compared to the Holy tower, which had the support of the time hourglass, they were much weaker and were often in a state of defeat!

This was a very important battle.

But just looking at the configuration, it didn’t seem too good!

“But fortunately, lady Vivika and master Nikola are here!” He said. He looked forward and saw two figures standing in front of him.

One of them was wrapped in a green storm, just like a real wind elemental spirit, while the other was Nikola, who had spread out his huge spiritual body and was surrounded by many spirits.

This was also one of the reasons why he still had the courage to stand here.

This at least meant that the bloodline tower had decided to defend this place.

“But …”

He looked around and heard many negative voices.

“F * ck, how do we fight this?!”

“The Holy tower has completely crushed us. We’re definitely going to lose!”

“We’re doomed, we’re doomed!”

These tiny sounds lingered around his ears, making him feel uneasy.

Fortunately, there were only a few of them, and … It wasn’t like they didn’t have any trump cards.

As if he had thought of something, John put his hand into the pocket of his Warlock’s robe. A diamond-shaped crystal was emitting a slight heat at this time as if it made his blood throb.

The main reason they lost was the spell formation of the Holy tower.

But today, tower master Vivika had suddenly given this to him!

The spell formation core!

He was shocked.

He just didn’t know how effective it would be!

“The quality of the Holy tower’s spell formation is very good, but there’s a high chance that this is not as good, but it’s better than nothing!” John’s mind was running wild, The power of the Holy tower’s spell formation had already been deeply engraved in his heart.

...

He truly felt how powerful the mages in the Mage World were!

All of a sudden, he felt a huge stream of air flash past him!

He looked up.

A human figure flew into the sky like a small ball of lightning.

“Situ!”

John looked at the familiar lightning and knew who had attacked.

The Holy tower’s side had Situ, a third circle ultimate Warlock with the bloodline of the heavenly lightning Giant Eagle.

However, Situ’s appearance had completely changed. The bloodline transformation had made his body more balanced, and a pair of lightning wings had spread out behind him. His skin was also covered in lightning scars, but the most eye-catching thing was the huge lightning around him.

He was a very powerful Warlock!

At the same time, a gray shadow flew out from the bloodline tower’s side.

With powerful soul ripples, Nikola and Situ began to fight.

For a time, lightning and gray clouds kept flashing and colliding in the sky, but everyone could see that Nikola was at a disadvantage. However, Nikola still had the help of a large number of spirits, so he could still fight.

“Attack!”

At the same time, the Holy tower in the distance and the bloodline tower gave out orders at the same time.

In the sky, the venomous Wyverns collided with the sea of undead.

On the ground, more than a dozen third-circle warlocks streaked across the sky and fought.

The first was naturally a long-range probe!

The bloodline tower’s main bloodline was the low-ranked wind elemental spirit, the wind elemental child’s bloodline, while the Holy tower’s bloodline was the low-level bloodline of Udo’s lava Fire Monkey, the fire Monkey bloodline.

On the side of the Holy tower, fire elements flew towards the bloodlines tower like fire rain, followed by storms.

In an instant, the battlefield was split into two.

The wind wall blocked the rain of fire. One side was red, while the other side was green. However, because there were only a few people in the bloodline tower, a hole appeared in the wind wall after a while. Many fire raindrops flew over, and many warlocks were directly burned to death by the fire rain!

Upon seeing this, the Holy tower warlocks all revealed happy smiles.

“The bloodline tower will lose!”

“I’m sure we will win this time!”

After this round of long-range attacks, a voice came from behind.

A Warlock stood at the back of the sky and shouted, “All Holy tower warlocks, activate the spell formation and destroy the bloodline tower’s defensive line!”

The majestic voice swept across the entire battlefield. The Holy tower warlocks who controlled the core of the spell formation raised their magic staves one after another. In an instant, rays of faint light bloomed and lit up the battlefield.

An invisible wave swept across the entire battlefield. Some of the Holy tower warlocks felt as if their mental energy had been connected, and the Army united as one!

At this time, the momentum of the entire Holy tower had reached its peak!

All the warlocks from the bloodline families felt their hearts sink. They felt helpless!

This spell formation had already defeated them many times.

“Is it starting?”

At this moment, in the crowd, John was also holding the core of the spell formation.

He looked at Vivika, who was not far from the sky.

Wait for her order!
