562 Ten Years

Grassi Land!

Mage Tower.

“It’s a success!” Eli let out a long sigh of relief.

After almost two hundred years of hard work, he had finally comprehended the Law of Light.

He reached out his hand, and a gentle light suddenly lit up in the Mage Tower. Light, holiness, purification, purity… All sorts of attributes were sensed by Eli.

This was an experience he had never experienced before. Normally, the rules he comprehended only had one attribute. For example, his shadow was devouring. However, the law of light this time was completely different. It actually had several attributes.

“As expected, it’s of a higher level than ordinary laws!” Eli was very happy.

The essence of the Law of Light was still relatively high. Among the Laws that Eli grasped, only the Law of Time could compare to it. Even the Law of Devouring was slightly inferior.

Of course, being inferior did not mean that it was not important. After all, the law of devouring was extraordinary to Eli.

Of course, there was one more important thing. The Law of Light had a strong suppression or even restraint on the Law of Black Fog, or even curses and Darkness attributes. It was of great significance to Eli!

After that, he would be even more confident in teaching his student a lesson!

“However, the Law of Light is actually a fusion of the power of faith and the Law of Purification. It seems that some laws of the same origin can be fused. Perhaps I can try to fuse some of the laws that I have mastered.” Eli rubbed his chin and pondered.

The fifth circle was essentially the stage of mastering the laws.

The difference between a strong law and a weak law was naturally like the difference between heaven and earth.

The Shadow Law that he had mastered was just average. It was just that his other skills were too powerful. It enabled him to bully his opponents. In fact, it was a little unusual!

“Therefore, although the experiment is over, a new experiment has been initiated.” Eli pursed his lips.

Doing experiments was like this. When he was free, he might not have had any good research projects for hundreds of years. When he was busy, he could not stop.

However, this was also quite good. The main goal was to enrich himself!

“It can transform and flow… Maybe I should try to merge the two.” Eli set a small goal first, to upgrade the Shadow Law.

In any case, the situation in the deep sea and on the continent was quite stable. Nothing major should happen in the short term. He still had a lot of time.

Ten years later!

“Bah, I failed again.” Eli walked out of the laboratory with a face full of dust. He turned around and saw that the laboratory behind him was covered in shadows!

Just now, he had tried to merge the Laws of Modifications into the Laws of Shadows, but he had failed accidentally. In the end, he almost caused a huge explosion. It was only because he had sharp eyes and fast hands that he had not caused an accident in the experiment.

After a simple cleaning, Eli decided to rest for a while.

He took out the experiment log and flipped through it.

In the past ten years, he had successfully fused the Darkness and Corrosion Laws into the Shadow Law, causing the Shadow Law to be upgraded twice. Currently, it was a Law at the second level he had mastered. The first level was the Time and Light Laws.

Of course, it was almost impossible to complete so much in ten years. This was because Eli had the time world fragment.

Ten years was the time. He had spent almost 1,300 years there, which had made his strength soar. At present, the Law Fruit of Time, the Law Fruit of Bloodline, and the Law Fruit of Light had all been condensed. These were the main laws that Eli had mastered.

Of course, according to the growth rate of the fruit, it was still quite far away.

He divided the fruit’s growth rate into four levels. The first level was when it had just been condensed, and the fourth level was when it had reached the standard for advancement. At this moment, the Shadow Rule and Bloodline Fruit were at the third level, the Time Rule was at the second level, and the Light Rule was at the first level!

Speaking of bloodlines, this was all thanks to the Eternal Flame.

The burning of the flames had promoted the improvement of his bloodline. At this moment, his Shadow Dragon Bloodline had almost reached the peak of the fifth circle bloodline. This was also the reason why the Bloodline Fruit had improved so quickly.

Of course, there was still a long way to go before he could advance to a sixth-circle bloodline. He did not know when he would succeed.

“I’ve gained a lot over the years. It’s just that taking on four laws at the same time is a bit of a waste of time.” Eli shook his head and sighed.

Normally, a rank 5 Magus would specialize in a single law. Naturally, it would be much slower for him. Of course, there was a price to pay, and his combat power was also far superior to those of the same rank!

After sighing, he took out a crystal ball and began to read.

As for the content inside, it was about advancing to the sixth circle.

That’s right. It was the resource that Eli had been searching for.

The information was much easier to obtain than he had imagined. Seven years ago, the merfolk joined the moderate party, and then the Giant Octopus family simply sent over their information on mage, including the knowledge of breaking through the sixth circle.

Of course, it wasn’t without a price. At the very least, if there were a war in the future, they would have to participate!

At that time, Eli was also hesitant, but it was only for a moment.

This was nothing compared to the knowledge that he had gained from breaking through to the sixth circle!

Moreover, that was Poseidon’s matter. What did it have to do with him, Eli?

“To break through to the six-ringed realm, one actually has to use the laws to condense a world of laws, forming a world-like collective and then erupting with powerful power. This is also the reason why the sixth circle realm is also known as the World Lord!” Eli sighed and shook his head.

Just hearing these conditions, he could already feel the difficulty.

Condensing a world of laws required a Mage’s mastery of laws, mental strength, and other aspects. Not to mention that he had four laws. The difficulty was off the charts.

” But it doesn’t matter. As long as I have enough time, I’ll slowly grind it to the limit. Moreover, I have the resources of a continent. It might not be as difficult as I think.”

He was still quite optimistic, at least about advancing to the sixth circle!

Of course, he still needed time.

“I hope the time world fragment can last until I break through to the sixth ring.” Eli looked forward to it.

So far, the time world fragment has helped him a lot.

Perhaps to others, it was a place where time flowed differently, but to Eli, it was almost like an accelerator. Coupled with the law of devouring, it allowed him to advance so smoothly.

He still relied on his hard work day and night to get to where he was now.

Otherwise, the thousands of years in the time world fragment would not be something an ordinary Mage could endure. It was only because he was used to it that he did not feel anything!

“Such is eternal life!”

Eli sighed and turned to walk towards the wizard tower.

..

Another three days passed.

Eli was in the mage tower when a deafening sound suddenly woke him up.

“What happened?” Eli was stunned. He immediately flew out of the wizard tower and looked at the sky.

In the sky, Nikola, Hydra, Phoenix, and even further away, a large number of Warlocks were looking into the distance. That was where the voice came from.

The sky there was shrouded in darkness, and no one knew what was going on.

” That direction is the Lich Tower…”

Eli narrowed his eyes.

He seemed to have sensed the aura of a fifth-circle battle. Moreover, what could be sensed there was definitely a big battle, and it was a battle between advanced fifth circle masters.

He took out the Dice of Fate that he had not taken out for a long time and rolled it!

“Something big happened in the Lich Tower? Will it affect the Bloodline Tower?”

The golden light spun and slowly stopped at 20!

“20?”

Eli slowly put it away and stretched his body.

He understood.

The final battle was about to begin!
