302 Vivika’s Letter

Eli found the letter on the table in his mage Tower.

The letter was wrapped in a very ordinary yellow envelope, and the seal was a flower petal. It was an ordinary wildflower, probably picked by the roadside, very common.

Eli came to the table, picked up the envelope, and slowly opened it.

“Dear teacher,

“It’s very sad to say goodbye in such a way, but I think it’s the best way for me. After all, if I really faced teacher, I don’t know if I would still have the courage to turn around and leave. It’s too cruel.

“I remember that the first time I met you was almost 800 years ago. It was you who pulled me out of the darkness and gave me a new life. You also let me know that there were more powerful forces in this world besides Knights.

“I was really happy during that period of time. I didn’t feel any pressure in my studies or in my life. It was only when you suddenly disappeared because of the mystery realm that everything seemed to have changed a little.

“I followed my senior brother David to the West Coast to join the bloodline tower. Although the journey was difficult and dangerous, I never gave up. The biggest reason was that I know you must still be alive. I have to live to see you again.

“I’m glad that my guess was correct.

“When teacher appeared before me again, you were still my greatest support. You easily helped me deal with the opponents that I couldn’t defeat at that time. After that, it was the same. One by one, my opponents were easily defeated by teacher.

“I stood behind you and looked at you in admiration.

“Just like that year!

“I wanted this to go on forever, but it was obvious that I couldn’t.

“Teacher, you still have a chance to break through to the celestial realm, but I don’t have much hope on the West Coast.

“Thus, I decided to head to the central continent. There, I might still have a sliver of hope.

“I want to be stronger so that I can accompany teacher for a longer time!”

The first page ended.

Eli’s feelings were complicated. No matter what, he was the one who brought Vivika up. She was also one of the people who had accompanied him in Bryne. Furthermore, she was his student, so naturally, he would take care of her.

He didn’t have any special thoughts about it, but Vivika’s relationship seemed to have changed a little!

Eli flipped to the second page.

“Teacher, if I leave now, I might not have the chance to come back again.

“Of course, if I can break through, I’ll definitely come back, but I know that the hope is slim, but I’m still unwilling to give up.

“Compared to teacher, I’m still too ordinary.”

In his last words, Eli could sense Vivika’s sadness. Besides, Vivika seemed to have vaguely sensed that Eli was extraordinary, which was why she said that.

After all, Vivika knew that he was a mage.

As for Mages, they shouldn’t have lived for so long!

Both Eli and Vivika knew this very well.

Vivika was also the only one who knew how long he had been alive, but both Eli and Vivika had tacitly ignored this matter.

Eli shook his head and continued to read the last paragraph.

“teacher, if we can meet again in the future, I hope to be with you in another identity!”

After reading it, Eli didn’t say anything.

The last sentence seemed normal, but it contained a lot of information.

He seemed to understand why Vivika had taken the family’s children away.

Vivika was best at researching bloodlines when she was an apprentice. Now that hundreds of years have passed, she might have made new achievements in this area. Vivika might have even studied bloodlines more deeply than him!

If she failed to advance, would he be seeking opportunities in the bloodline?

Was that her backup?

“Then I’ll look forward to our next meeting if there’s a chance!”

Eli kept the letter and opened the window.

Outside the window was the center of the bloodline tower. It was a bustling and lively scene, and Eli also sensed that Vivika’s mark was getting further and further away.

Vivika left too, and Eli suddenly realized.

She was his only friend on the West Coast!

Now, there were none left. There were only some people he knew later or his subordinates.

However, Eli was gradually getting used to it.

Anyway, he had already experienced these things many times.

Eternal life was something that countless people yearned for, but wasn’t it also a punishment?

“But there are still many things worth pursuing!”

Eli opened the window, and the wind outside caressed his face.

There were still many things that he had not seen and many stories that he had not written. How could he slack off? he had to work hard and break through to the celestial realm.

“I’ll stabilize myself for a hundred years. I’ll break through to the celestial realm first!” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Now that the storm on the West Coast had subsided, he should work hard to improve his strength. He would break through to the celestial realm first. After that, he would think about other things.

..

After making up his mind, Eli gave Aisha some instructions.

He quickly left the bloodline tower and returned to the White Tower in the South.

The bloodline tower Herman disappeared and the black Tower prison had an extra Warden.

...

Since Vivika left, Aisha had become the new tower master.

She took control of all the forces on the West Coast. Since then, the entire West Coast had been under the bloodline tower’s control, with the exception of the North. The bloodline tower’s flag was erected in all the territories except for some deep mountains.

The bloodline tower’s momentum had also reached its peak.

..

In the blink of an eye, thirty years had passed.

This year, Eli’s mental power had reached 400 points, which was also the minimum requirement to advance to celestial, which was also the commonly known limit of the third circle.

In the past few years, Eli had begun to let the bloodline tower search for the ruins of the past Wizards on a large scale in an attempt to find information about mages advancing to the celestial level, but the results were very good.

At this time, Vivika had been in the bloodline tower for more than 20 years.

From the mark, he knew that Vivika had reached the limit of third circle and was climbing very fast in the bloodline tower. She was almost at the top of the main tower.

All of this was within Eli’s expectations. He had witnessed Vivika’s management skills over the years. Even if she were to go to the central mainland, she would not be too bad.

Aside from these people, there was also Nina, the former person in charge of the irises camp.

...

The reason why she was the previous one was that she was already dead.

It was an extreme death. It was an accidental death when she encountered a peak third-circle magical beast while exploring a place. It was a sad death, but it was normal. In fact, there were almost no mages who could die of old age.

Oh, there’s also Udo.

This fellow was also preparing to leave for the central continent.

Because of what had happened before, Luo ye was short of subordinates. Udo also wanted to go to the central continent to take a look, so they hit it off and he took the spaceship to the central continent.

At this point, the number of people that Eli was familiar with on the West Coast could be counted on one hand.
