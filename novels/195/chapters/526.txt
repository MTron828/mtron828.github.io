527 War Outbreak

” Peak of Thousand Leaves?”

On the grassi ground, Eli stretched out their hands, looking somewhat unreal.

Even if he didn’t go deep into his perception, he could still feel that on one side of the huge tree of laws in his body, nearly a thousand leaves of laws were swaying along with his sea of spirit.

In terms of numbers, he was indeed at the peak of the Thousand Leaves Realm!

However…

Eli pursed his lips and looked to the other side.

Compared to the lush shadow on one side, on the other side of the translucent time branch, there were still only two or three time law leaves swaying, lonely.

His Indistinct Law did meet the requirements for advancement, but when he advanced back then, he had more than one law. Other than the Law of Shadow, he also had the Law of Time!

“So, I’m considered half of the peak of Thousand Leaves?” Eli was a little stunned!

However, it was already enough. After all, it had only been less than half a day. It was already very ridiculous for him to reach this level. Other than half of the power of laws, there was also the advanced “devouring” law.

Thinking of this, Eli once again tried to sense his spiritual perception.

Above the Laws of Shadow, there seemed to be countless shadows moving. The moving shadows were rotating irregularly, emitting a devouring aura like a black hole.

This was what Eli had gained from the Blood Bamboo Flower.

There was a special devouring rune inside the advanced Blood Bamboo Flower. The moment Eli observed it, his devouring law came into contact with it, and a change that shocked Eli occurred.

The law of devouring had advanced!

After his advancement, apart from the fact that his own laws had become stronger, Eli had also obtained a new ability, which was devouring. It was different from the simple devouring power of the past. This time, it was the devouring power that could devour laws.

Unconsciously, Eli had swallowed more than half of the Shadow Law, which was why he had advanced.

“What a waste!”

Eli lowered his head to look at the Law of Shadow and immediately felt his heart bleeding.

This was a complete set of laws!

While Eli was sighing, the surrounding creatures looked at each other, not daring to disturb Eli.

In the end, Nikola couldn’t help but whisper to Eli, “Sir, are you alright?”

Eli finally reacted and smiled at the few of them, explaining, “Nothing much. I just got a little bit of information and accidentally immersed myself in it.”

Lord, you look like you have gained something!

However, they didn’t ask any questions. When they saw Eli, they dispersed one by one. Phoenix, in particular, directly transformed and flew towards Hill before stopping.

Eli returned to the tower and continued to comprehend the advancement of the devouring law.

Very soon, Eli gained a deeper understanding of the devouring law, as well as a new understanding of his own state.

“My current state is very similar to my second ring. As long as I devour the same law, I can advance, but where can I find the time? Or should I say the law of time?” In the Tower, Eli was deep in thought.

The current situation on the continent was extremely complicated. It was possible that a war would break out in an instant. He had to do his best to become stronger. Then, he had to search for the law of time that could be devoured.

However, the time law was a little more advanced, and it was not easy to find.

Eli suddenly thought of something and sent his perception into his Sea of Consciousness! Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Eli glanced at the Sea of Consciousness as he passed by the Tree of Law.

There, a white ray of light that pierced through reality, consciousness, and the void stood. There were also strands of translucent light around it, emitting the aura of time.

“This is definitely related to the laws of time. It might even be the laws!” Eli sensed it silently, but he quickly gave up on his ridiculous idea.

What a joke.

It was not a problem of whether it could be devoured or not. If the Eternal Life buff were gone with a bite, it would be a big problem. Therefore, he definitely could not set his sights on it.

Since the white pillar of light could not be considered, what else was there?

As Eli pondered, his eyes lit up again.

“I’ve thought of it!”

The corners of Eli’s mouth gradually curled up!

..

Crack!

The ” lightning ” of the time world fragment shot down from the sky, causing the space to fluctuate.

Normally, the lightning would enter the earth and then integrate into the unique ecological environment of this world fragment. However, there was a slight change on this day.

In the corner of the Time World Fragment, every time a ” lightning ” fell, a figure would quickly appear at the landing point, then open its shadow mouth and devour it!

Gulp!

After swallowing the lightning again, Eli smiled as he felt one-fifth of the Law Leaf appear in his body.

After his examination, these thunderbolts did contain a certain amount of time law. Of course, the law was very weak. It might take dozens of thunderbolts to gather some leaves of law.

But even so, it was still much faster than him meditating.

“This is really my blessed land!”

Eli looked into the depths of the Time World Fragment, where the lightning in the timeline fell like heavy rain, stirring up the air and Eli’s emotions!

..

Ten days passed in the blink of an eye.

Inside the time world fragment, Eli sat at the edge of the fragment, sensing the more than 100 leaves of the time law swaying on the other side of the tree. He smiled in satisfaction.

“According to the current efficiency, it will take at least three months in the outside world!” Eli assessed his efficiency, delighted but not that delighted.

He was happy because this was extremely easy for him to advance. However, he wasn’t so happy because Miya had sent news a few days ago that the remaining five families of the Warlock Union seemed to have moved!

The entire Warlock Union’s higher-ups were already secretly taking action. A big operation might be brewing, so Miya reminded him to be careful.

“Sigh, what an eventful time!”

Eli shook his head.

Of course, he had already informed Alida of the news. The Bloodline Alliance had already been mobilized, and the top leaders of the various families were also waiting.

“But it has nothing to do with me. I’d better break through to the true peak of the Thousand Leaves Realm as soon as possible.” Eli pursed his lips and made up his mind.

The Warlock Alliance was strong, but not that strong!

Thousand Leaves was already the limit!

Reaching the peak of Thousand Leaves was enough to deal with most of the problems. Moreover, Eli himself knew that he should be able to fight against two or three people of the same level. However, if the time law also reached the limit, then he would not be afraid of any enemy at the Thousand Leaves level.

“Good luck!”

At this time, Eli had also rested, so he continued to walk deeper into the time world fragment.

..

A month passed in the blink of an eye!

At this moment, the number of time law leaves in Eli’s body had already reached 400, and he was getting closer and closer to the peak of the Thousand Leaves Realm.

Just as Eli felt that he could successfully reach the peak of Thousand Leaves, something happened that made Eli temporarily stop.

That was because…War had broken out!
