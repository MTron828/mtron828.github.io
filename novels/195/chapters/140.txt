141 Returning to the Camp

After leaving the city of Corina, Eli did not return to the campsite directly. Instead, he entered the forest on the way, chased away the bear in the tree hole, and entered the arcane realm.

In the secret plane, Eli looked at the small mountain of magic stones and the miscellaneous items on the side. He felt his breathing quicken. It had been a long time since he had seen so much money.

After taking stock, he found that there were a total of 3000 low-grade magic stones, three zero-circle magic tools, one first-circle magic tool, two first-circle bloodlines, and some strange items. One of the black boxes caught Eli’s attention.

The box was black in color, and it was covered in red blood vessel-like patterns. There were spell formations at the bottom, and it looked very strange.

Bang!

!!

The box was stained with blood.

This was actually nothing much, but as the blood stained the box, it began to emit a bright light, and a strange and evil aura slowly spread out.

Eli silently retreated a few kilometers.

In the next second, all of the spell formations in the secret plane were activated, and the box was instantly enveloped by all kinds of colorful restrictions. One of the undead was ordered by Eli to open the box.

The pale white bone slowly touched the box, and a wave of darkness and shadow slowly climbed up. However, the box also slowly opened with a determined speed, revealing a purple-black heart inside.

The heart was about the size of a basketball, and its surface was black and purple. There were green-black blood vessels attached to it, and at the same time, a shadow and dark aura were emitted from it.

“The heart of a shadow lizard!”

Looking at the heart, Eli relaxed. It was just a shadow lizard’s heart, but judging from its aura, it should be a second circle, which was why it had such a strong aura. It should be the Elena family’s Secret treasure.

The restrictions were lifted layer by layer, and Eli slowly walked over, letting the undead hold the heart.

How should he deal with it?

Eli frowned. Logically speaking, a second-circle bloodline was quite valuable, especially one taken from a second-circle creature. Whether it was for fusion or other uses, it would be worth at least a thousand magic stones.

The most cost-effective way would be to sell it, but Eli had no intention of doing so.

Shadow lizards were almost the standard equipment of the shadow lizard Warlock Academy. If he sold them privately, it would definitely attract their attention. It would be bad if he was discovered, so he might as well use it himself.

Shadow lizard and shadow dragon were from the same family, so Eli could use the heart to increase the compatibility of his bloodline.

Since he had an unlimited number of magic stones, he might as well use the heart to increase his combat power as a Warlock.

Eli grabbed the heart and headed to the lab.

Half a day later, Eli looked at the bottle of dark purple blood in his hand and drank it all in one go. At the same time, his compatibility with the shadow Dragon bloodline was rapidly increasing.

34%.

35%.

…

Three days later, Eli opened her eyes. After sensing that the compatibility rate was 49%, he smiled.

Although it seemed like he had suffered a loss, he was still very happy to see his strength increase.

At the same time.

Eli suddenly felt a message from the camp.

“The Corina family has terminated the mission ahead of time, and the camp has now stabilized. Herman, you can come back now.”

It was Evena.

Eli looked at the message and stood up. He had been hiding outside for more than two years, so it was time to return.

And if Eli didn’t remember wrongly, many ministers died this time.

This time, things might be very different.

…

Five days later.

After getting used to his upgraded bloodline, Eli returned to the camp.

At the same time, his aura slowly rose to the level of someone who had just entered the first ring. At the same time, the gentle aura of a plant-type bloodline also began to emanate from his body.

It had to be said that as expected of the shadow dragon. His disguising ability was superb, and with the help of the faceless mask, even a third-circle mage would not be able to discover him. As for celestials, Eli wouldn’t know until he met another one.

The only pity was that although the quality of his items was good, they were all in the first circle. The main thing was that his ability wasn’t enough. When his alchemy skills were high enough, he could directly upgrade them.

Five days later, Eli came to the edge of the camp.

There were traces of battle everywhere on the road, and there were even blood and remnants in some places. Many houses had collapsed, and it looked like the battle had been quite intense.

Eli didn’t return to the campsite immediately. Instead, he went home first. His ‘Warlock neighbor’, Tijie, had already left.

Judging from the message that Tijie had given to him, she had already left the place with the mages and was preparing to set up a new camp somewhere.

After all, he might have to take refuge with the mages one day, and it would be good to visit the wizard camp. As for Tijie, if it were convenient, he would also give her some help and raise her status.

After settling everything down, Eli went straight to the camp.

The further he went, the more damaged buildings he saw. There were also very few people on the streets. Compared to before, the prosperity level had dropped by more than one level. It would take time to recover.

At the entrance of the camp, Eli actually met someone familiar.

“Long time no see, Sir Herman.” Alice looked a little sad.

“Hmm, you don’t seem to be in a good mood. What happened?” Eli asked.

“Well, it’s just that I grew up here. I’m sad to see this place in such a state.” Alice sighed, then looked at Eli and said in surprise, ” “My Lord, you’re at the first circle?”

“Yes, I had my breakthrough outside.”

“Congratulations, my Lord.” Alice congratulated.

“Okay, then I’ll take my leave first. If you run into any big trouble, I’ll sort it out. If you run into any small trouble, you can come to me at any time.” Eli said.

Alice nodded and watched Eli leave.

…

Potion Department

Bang Bang Bang!

“Come in!”

Eli walked into Evena’s office.

“you’ve advanced in rank!” Evena was surprised to see Eli walking in.

“Yes, I’ve integrated my bloodline with a bramble demon.” Eli smiled.

He looked at Evena now. Her appearance had not changed much, but the power of her bloodline was obviously much weaker. It seemed that she had been seriously injured in the battle.

“I knew you could do it.” Evena smiled. “Now, the camp needs people. You’ve advanced to the first circle, so you’ll definitely be valued. When the time comes, I’ll bring you to see the battalion commander,” Said Evena.

“by then, you should be able to get a good position, and you’ll gain access to better things.”

Just as Eli had expected, being in the first circle would bring about new changes.

“I really didn’t expect you to succeed, tsk tsk tsk!” Evena stood up, shook her head, and sighed. Her rabbit ears swayed.

Eli, “…”

I’m so looked down upon!

“Hmm, tomorrow then. I’ll bring you to see the battalion commander tomorrow. I’ve been really busy recently.” Said Evena.

“Yes.”

He was already looking forward to tomorrow.

…

The next day.

Led by Evena, Eli followed her to find battalion commander Kratos.

On the way, Eli looked at the bunny-eared Evena and asked, ” “Minister, can you tell me about the battalion commander?”

Although he had been here for many years, he had not had much contact with this battalion commander.

“Eh, he’s actually quite a good person. He’s quite gentle, just that he looks cold, and he’s also very protective of his subordinates. In any case, he’s a strong but gentle man.” Said Evena after thinking for a while.

“Is that so? then…” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Don’t ask. You’ll know when you see him.” Eli wanted to ask more, but he was stopped by Evena.

At this time, they had arrived in front of a Mage Tower.

After entering and reporting to the guard, Eli was brought to a room.

“I’m not going in,” Said Evena with a smile.

He nodded and knocked on the door.

“Come in!” A bright voice was heard as Eli opened the door and walked in.

It was a small room, but the layout was quite unique. It was basically brown, and there were oil lamp-like magic lamps hanging on the walls on both sides. On one side was a bookshelf filled with books, and on the other side was a magic Wolf specimen.

In the middle of the room was a large table, and a man was looking at him.

He had short brown hair and dark pupils. His face looked very comfortable, but there was a horizontal scar near his eye. However, he looked very friendly overall.

“Hello, Sir Kratos. I’m Herman.” As Eli introduced, he secretly observed.

Evena did not react to his disguise at all. He wanted to see how this battalion commander would react.

“Not bad, not bad. I’ve heard about you from Evena. You’re quite experienced in the camp. After all, you’ve been here for more than 20 years. You’re very conscientious.” Kratos said with a smile, exuding the power of a second-circle warlock.

“It’s all thanks to your good management of the camp. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have such an environment to improve myself!” Eli said.

“Hahahaha!” Hearing this, Kratos smiled. After all, everyone was willing to listen to praises.

“Well, the main reason you’re summoned is that many first-circle warlocks have died in the camp, and there are many empty positions. I’ve been very troubled recently.”

“I’m willing to help you solve your worries, Sir,” Eli said.

“Yes, I’ve prepared two positions for you. One of them is to lead an important Department, and I’m worried about handing it to someone else. You’ve been with Evelina for decades, and she’s my confidant, so I trust you.” Kratos said with admiration.

“Which two?”

“The head of the magic plant Department and the head of the mage relics disposal Department.”
