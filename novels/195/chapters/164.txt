165 Entering the Secret Plane

Two days later.

On the plain, under the altar, hundreds of people were gathered.

Eli and Rawls stood in front of the White Tower warlocks, and not far away were the warlocks of the Blood Alliance. Adams and Molin were also standing in front of the warlocks of their forces.

Adams straightened his body with an unruly expression, and his eyes didn’t even look at the White Tower. On the other hand, Molin, who was a charming man with good skin, was smiling.

As for the warlocks behind them, they were all grinning and looking at the sorcerers of the White Tower with sharp eyes as if they were lambs waiting to be slaughtered. The victory was in their hands.

“It’s almost time.”

On the altar, Kratos said calmly, with Dick beside him.

“Indeed, it’s almost time.” Dick also nodded, his eyes flashing with a cold light.

Then, the two of them looked at the altar behind them. There were still holes in the portal, and people were filling it with magic stones to replenish its energy.

The whirlpool grew larger and larger and soon became like a wall.

“When the time comes, we’ll be placed at random after entering. If you encounter an ally, group up.” Below, Rawls said to the people behind him. The vortex had already been completely formed, and they could enter.

“Everyone, let’s go up to the altar first!” Kratos shouted as his eyes constantly patrolled the Blood Alliance to check if they had reached the standard. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Dick was in the same state, but he was still a lot more nervous. However, a few seconds later, Kratos looked away and smiled in relief. He was sure that he wasn’t discovered. At this time, Dick had also finished checking the White Tower warlocks and found no problems.

And what he was most concerned about was actually Eli, not because of his strength, but because this guy had once brought them great pain, which indirectly led to their failure back then.

Thus, when the group began to ascend the altar, Dick directly said to Adams and Molin as they passed by, ” “Kill that Herman guy.”

“I know.” Mo Lin nodded.

“Alright,” Adams had an indifferent expression on his face, and he glanced at Eli curiously. He also knew about the deeds of this Warlock, but he did not take them to heart.

After all, this was a world where strength was the most important thing. People like Herman, who studied small tricks, would not have a good result.

“How sad!” Adams sighed.

“The door to the secret plane can last for two days. You just have to come out after two days. At that time, the competition will be over!” Kratos said to the crowd.

Hearing Kratos ‘words, Rawls and Herman also prepared to enter, but before they could, Adams stepped forward and blocked them. He turned around and said, “I’m sorry. We’ll be going first.” Then, he stepped into the secret realm with Molin following closely behind.

‘This guy.’

Rawls’ mouth twitched, and Eli looked away from Adams with a strange smile.

“What’s the matter, Herman?” Rawls asked when he saw Eli’s expression.

“It’s fine. It’s just a small thing.” Eli shook his head and entered the secret realm with Rawls.

The others followed closely behind. A few hundred people quickly entered the secret realm, and the vortex in the secret realm slowly shrank.

“Hehe, Kratos, pray that your White Tower can survive,” Dick said with a smile after everyone entered.

Kratos ignored the provocation, but his furrowed brows showed that he was not confident.

Dick revealed a smile and walked down the altar.

He was already looking forward to Kratos’s wonderful expression in two days.

…

On the other side, Eli shook his slightly dizzy head and looked around.

The area he was in now seemed to be a huge forest surrounded by giant trees that were dozens of meters tall. The ground was also full of weeds and raised roots. This was an area that no one had stepped into for hundreds of years.

“The forest?”

Instead of moving, he took out a map and began to check his position.

“Huh? it seems to be very close to the blood soul Flower that Kratos needs!”

According to the map, he should be in a forest at the edge of the secret land. Outside the forest, there seemed to be the magical herb garden that Kratos had mentioned, which was the place that he had pointed out.

“But…” Eli looked at a plant under a tree that was more than ten meters tall, his eyes narrowing slightly.

Moon spring water was a precious magical plant. If he remembered correctly, it had been extinct on the West Coast for decades. He did not expect to find it here. It was indeed a historical site.

Why don’t we first collect the things here before going?

Anyway, two days was a lot of time, so there was no rush.

After making his decision, the shadows under Eli’s feet began to wriggle, and shadow eyes quickly scanned the surroundings. This was more efficient. As for him, he went to collect the moon spring water.

“The White Tower’s Warlock!”

At this moment, behind a large tree tens of meters away, a middle-stage first-circle warlock squinted his eyes and stared at Eli’s crouching body.

He had just entered and saw Eli collecting plants.

‘He is too careless. He can’t blame anyone for his death!’ The Warlock looked at Eli’s crouching body, and the corners of his mouth rose.

At the same time, his right hand gradually transformed into a sharp claw, and his body instantly leaped toward Eli.

Wind elements gathered on his sharp claws, turning into wind blades. Wind elements also appeared behind him, increasing his speed. He had fused with the bloodline of the first circle wind sickle ferret, which made him best at explosive power and sneak attacks.

At this distance, he did not believe that the Warlock in front of him would be able to escape.

“Go to hell!” When he was five meters away, the Warlock grinned.

But in the next second, he couldn’t smile anymore because, in an instant, a large shadow appeared in front of him like a tide, directly wrapping him up.

“What kind of magic is this!” The Warlock struggled madly, but the shadow seemed to have a life of its own. It tightly wrapped around the Warlock and pulled him into the shadow.

“He must be a fool.” After finishing collecting the silent moon spring, Eli turned to look at the dead Warlock.

Did this guy think he didn’t notice him?

Was he really that stupid?

“Sigh, what a pity!” Eli pursed his lips. A first circle Warlock had died just like that.

He then summoned a skeleton to loot the corpse in case the Warlock had anything good on him.

In total, he had found three valuable items.

A map, a small mage weapon, and a first circle alchemy leather armor.

“The map is for the secret realm. Not bad.” Picking up the map, Eli realized that it was for the secret realm.

It was slightly better than the normal white Tower map but not as good as his. However, there were still some good points to derive from it.

As for the magic tool, Eli was rather interested. It was a product of alchemy that was the size of a Rubik’s Cube.

Taking it, Eli immediately erased the soul brand of the dead Warlock, then engraved his own brand and threw it on the ground in front of him. Immediately, the Rubik’s Cube changed, and in the blink of an eye, an alchemy hut of seven to eight square meters appeared.

“Not bad, not bad!” Eli sighed.

This was the first time he had seen such a thing. It was much more convenient for travel. Moreover, he was not familiar with it, so it was worth learning.

On the other hand, the alchemy leather armor was not too interesting, and Eli put it away.

Having gained so much in just over ten minutes of entering the arcane realm, Eli suddenly felt that this trip to the arcane realm seemed pretty good.

“Oh, and the elemental crystals. I wonder where they are? ” Eli didn’t forget what he needed the most this time either, so he prepared to explore slowly.

At this moment, as the shadow’s eye explored, Eli also discovered many new magic plants. He continued to explore the forest, and among them, he also encountered the White Tower and the Blood Alliance warlocks.

The White Tower warlocks greeted him respectfully. Eli didn’t really want to deal with the Blood Alliance Warlocks, but they were so determined to kill him. Eli had no choice but to kill them tearfully and loot their bodies.

In the blink of an eye, three hours had passed.

Eli had practically explored the entire primeval forest before he exited it.

The destination was the magical plant garden not far away.

“There should be a lot of good things in the magic plant garden.” Eli pursed his lips and sped up.
