435 The Elf Race Is in Danger

In another wizard tower used for receiving guests.

Tuman Slamu was sitting on the sofa. He was wearing a black-red shirt and pants, as well as a pair of red shoes. At this moment, one of his legs was crossed over the other, but his eyes under the mask seemed to be flickering with flames. He was very unhappy!

“Really, you actually made me wait for so long!” Tuman felt that there was a violent anger in his chest that he wanted to vent!

He felt that this Warlock named Eli didn’t seem to respect him or the Heart of the Abyss!

!!

“Sigh, it’s a pity that we can’t fight. After all, we’re here for a friendly exchange. We haven’t killed anyone for a month!” Tuman stretched his muscles and bones, feeling a little bored!

Suddenly, the sound of shoes stepping on the ground came from outside the door. Tuman’s eyes lit up. He put down his legs and stood up to look outside the door.

The door opened, and Eli walked in.

“Hello, I’m Tuman Slamu from the Heart of the Abyss. I’m here to discuss some matters with you!” Tuman lowered his head like a gentleman and introduced himself.

“Hello. I’m Eli!” Eli nodded.

Tuman also raised his head, but when Eli saw his eyes, he froze for a moment, and no one noticed.

“May I know why the Lord of the Heart of the Abyss has come to my house this time?” Eli said warmly. He only took a closer look at Tuman, who was wearing a mask. He was more cautious. Although he couldn’t see his face and the mask seemed different, Eli definitely wouldn’t mistake the pair of slightly red eyes.

The Warlocks in front of him were the Warlocks who had helped Jesse.

Although Tuman didn’t understand why Eli suddenly became so enthusiastic, he still told him the purpose of this trip.

” Sir Eli, I do have something to do this time. It’s about the Heart of the Abyss. ” Tuman said.

“Oh? What does the Heart of the Abyss have to do with us?” Eli asked with a frown.

” Hahaha, you might not be familiar with this. I’ll explain it to you. ” Tuman smiled and said, ” Sir, since 300 years ago, although the Heart of the Abyss has been guarding the Demonic Abyss, we have been under a lot of pressure. Moreover, many forces have been worried about the situation in the Abyss for some reason. Therefore, after that, every force above Level 2 will send a portion of their combat strength to share the pressure. That’s my purpose this time. ”

When Eli heard this, he raised his eyebrows as if he had not expected such a thing to happen!

“Your Excellency, that is indeed the case!” At this moment, Alida reminded him.

Alida had been following Glen all this while, so she knew a lot. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Sure, I’ll send out Warlocks as needed!” Eli nodded.

Although it was a form of help, it was also a form of surveillance to prevent any problems from happening in the Abyss. It was understandable!

If there was really a problem with the Heart of the Abyss, the team he sent out could report it in time!

“Hehe, thank you, sir.” Tuman chuckled as if the Heart of Abyss really needed this support!

” I wonder how many Warlocks you need. The Bloodline Tower is still in the construction phase, so we might not be able to send too many people! ” Eli said.

” Of course, this is up to you, sir. We can discuss it properly. Sir, let’s sit down and discuss it! ” Tuman spoke to Eli like a gentleman, completely without the irritability he had when he was alone!

“Yes!” Eli nodded, but his silver eyes had already been activated.

He realized that although Tuman looked very calm, this calmness seemed to be hiding the fiery-like violence and brutality. He also realized that he couldn’t see through this warlock. He even felt that there was something strange about this person in front of him!

Of course, these were all secondary issues. The more important issue was the support.

The two of them quickly discussed and decided that the Bloodline Tower would send out a celestial, 30 third circle warlocks, and 100 second circle warlocks as reinforcements!

“Since the discussion is over, I have to go back and report.” Tuman stood up and said goodbye!

“Sure, I’ll send you off!” Eli nodded.

“I won’t trouble you, sir. I plan to take a look around!” Tuman smiled and refused.

“It’s okay. This is just my clone. I have plenty of time!” Eli said casually.

He was not at ease with this person in front of him at all. He seriously suspected that the incident with the Eight-Armed Naga had something to do with them!

“Alright then!” Tuman’s mouth twitched as he nodded!

Finally, after half a day, Tuman finally understood that Eli seemed to be very wary of him, so he left immediately.

Eli sent him out dozens of kilometers away, then quietly marked him with a marker before returning!

The calmness in Tuman’s eyes disappeared as he watched Eli leave. It was as if a flame had been reignited.

Tuman shook his head and plunged into a mountain range. Instantly, the mountain range was filled with a bloody fog!

He loved killing!

…..

On the other side.

Eli also told Glen about this matter and then asked him to spread the news. If there were Warlocks who volunteered to go, he would directly choose them, and it would be best to place a few clever Warlocks.

Although Glen found it strange, he still quickly spread the news. For a time, it caused another uproar.

Although this matter didn’t seem too important, it was an invitation from the Heart of the Abyss. Moreover, those who were qualified to guard the Abyss were second-circle forces. This meant that the Bloodline Tower was already qualified to replace the Eight-Armed Naga. It was a true second-rank force!

This surprised many people!

After all, although the Bloodline Tower had absorbed the remnants of the Eight-Armed Naga Family, it had yet to convert them into actual strength. Although Bloodline Tower’s actual strength wasn’t that great, he was still recognized. However, Eli was strong enough that even the first-class force, the Heart of the Abyss, had to acknowledge him.

For a time, there was a new discussion about Eli’s strength in the Western Region. It was about how strong Eli’s limit was.

However, this was unsolvable.

At least for now, no one would dare to provoke Eli. At least for the time being, no one was going to find out.

…..

“Eh, looks like there’s going to be another battle!”

After returning to the Grassi Land, before his butt could even warm up, he suddenly frowned.

The moment he returned, he seemed to sense that someone was asking for help from the statue of faith in the distant green fields.

...

The elves seemed to be in big trouble!

“The Green Field. I also need to arrange the teleportation array there. I can also verify the newly built giant faith base station or statue.” Eli grinned!

Moreover, he had not visited the elves recently.

“Hehe, Mage Roland is about to come online!”

Eli smiled.

The next second, Eli closed his eyes.

At the same time, outside the city, everyone seemed to have sensed something and looked out of the city.

The huge statue of Eli suddenly gave off a majestic power and a golden light. A pillar of light shot into the sky, breaking through space and disappearing before everyone’s eyes.

“What is this?”

“A miracle?”

The Warlocks ‘mouths were wide open as they stared at this scene in a daze.

...

For Warlocks, this was still a little high-end!
