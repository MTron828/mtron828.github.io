414 A New Source of Faith

The Elven Priests nodded and sat on the chairs on both sides. Erwin sat beside Eli!

They all looked at Eli, curious about what would happen next!

“There are three things I want to say.” Eli watched as everyone sat down and blocked the outside of the temple. Then, he said, “First, I can’t stay here for long. I’ll leave in a week!”

As soon as Eli finished speaking, everyone’s expressions changed!

!!

“Ah, Sir, are you leaving?” Erwin asked.

“Yes.” Eli nodded. ” I’m preparing for the mage Alliance. The main battlefield is still the human world. I believe everyone can understand. ”

Eli was also desperate. Since he had already pretended to be a mage scout, then he would pretend to the end. So be it if he was the vanguard!

The Elven Priests nodded in agreement.

” That’s why I’m going to ask the second question. My power in the human world is called the Bloodline Tower. Next, I plan to establish a connection between the Bloodline Tower and the elven race. This will be beneficial to both forces. The elves can obtain the resources you need, which is also good for the elves. What do you think? ”

Ely looked at everyone. This was also one of the main topics of today’s meeting.

At this moment, the Elven Priests were also deep in thought. Erwin looked at the Priests and said, “I don’t think we can refuse!”

The priests looked at Erwin.

Erwin’s eyes were calm and she said without any shyness, ” Although the elves have been unified once again, our strength is still insufficient. This is a good opportunity for us. I feel that we shouldn’t miss it. Concocting potions was once the responsibility of the elves! ”

After hearing Ivan’s words, many priests nodded in agreement.

“I agree!”

A few priests spoke at the same time, but there was also a priest who raised a question. It was a moon elf priest. He looked at Eli and asked, ” But my lord, there’s another problem. There are still human defenses outside the green fields, such as the nearest human force, the Amina family! ”

” Don’t worry. The Amina Family is also one of us. I will inform them! ” Eli replied.

The Moon Elf Priest’s mouth was wide open as if she hadn’t expected that the Amina Family would also belong to Eli.

As expected of a lord!

The other priests also looked at him in awe!

“You don’t have to worry about the humans. You just have to resume the production of potions here. I’ll tell you what potions we need later. You don’t have to worry about the magical plants either. Someone will come and deliver them.” Eli reassured everyone and then said the third thing!

“The third thing is that you need to build a statue of me in the territory of the elves!” Eli looked at everyone calmly and said.

The priests were speechless.

Erwin also turned his head and looked at Eli in confusion, blinking her eyes.

Feeling the strange gazes from the crowd, Eli felt a little awkward and immediately explained, “I will leave this place later, but if you encounter a strong enemy, you can use my statue of faith to temporarily access part of my power.”

Hearing this answer, everyone felt a little embarrassed and regretted their wrong thinking!

“That’s not a problem. We’ll immediately mobilize the skilled craftsmen of the elf race to carve it later!” Erwin nodded and asked, “Then should we sculpt the appearance of the lord like this?”

“Roland’s face will do! ” Eli smiled.

For the statue of faith, its appearance was not the most important. The most important thing was to establish a connection.

“Alright.” Erwin nodded.

Everyone left.

…

Time flew by.

Just as the statue of Eli was being carved, deep in the green fields on a huge ancient tree that was 300 meters tall.

In a tree hole, seven or eight Feather Men sat together with serious expressions.

They all had eagle-like heads and sharp eyes, but their bodies were somewhat similar to humans. However, their entire bodies were covered in white feathers, and they had a pair of folded wings behind them!

The Feathermen Race was one of the strongest forces in the inner region of the Green Field. It was also a powerful race with several Radiant Suns.

“Everyone, have you heard about what happened to the Moon Elves these days?” A Feather Man elder in the center looked at everyone and said.

Everyone nodded, and the atmosphere became even gloomier.

After more than ten seconds, an old Feather Man raised his head and said in fear, “Lord Feather King, have the Mages really returned?”

He looked very old, and even his feathers were a little dark. At this moment, his body was almost trembling.

He was afraid!

” I don’t know, but the news from the elves is that a mage from the Wizard Alliance has returned! ” Feather King sighed.

Three days ago, a piece of news had spread among the elves. It was that a mage had returned and wanted to reunite the green fields.

This was undoubtedly a terrifying thing for many foreign races. 4,000 years passed since the calamity. Mages couldn’t live for that long but some foreign races had long life expectancies. Some even came from the Mages Era.

That was why they understood the meaning of the word, mage.

Civilization destroyer, world slave owner, fearmonger

Therefore, when the Feathermen heard this news, they were really shocked!

“Milord, what should we do?” The old Feather Man asked in a trembling voice again.

The Feather King fell silent. Clearly, he did not know what to do either. Moreover, there was a very big problem. They were the closest to the elf race!

“Isn’t it just a Mage? And you’re already so scared!” A young featherman spoke again.

His feathers were slightly brown, and so were his eyes. At this moment, his face was filled with disdain as he looked at the few old Feather Masters and said, “Please, look at those Warlocks outside. If it wasn’t for the fact that the green fields were sufficient, we would have invaded the outside world long ago. They’re just Mages, how strong can they be?

“I think you guys are getting old. Perhaps it’s time for Lord Feather King to hand over the position of the leader!”

The Feather Man named Yu Yun, snorted coldly and flew out. At the same time, his voice entered the ears of many Feather Men! Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

...

“Feather King, I will prove that you are old. In at most half a year, I will break through. At that time, I will bring back the head of that mage and personally defeat you to become the new Feather King!

“I will lead the Feathermen Race to become the strongest race!”

Seeing Yu Yun fly away, the feathermen looked at each other.

The Feather King’s face turned black as he recalled the time when he was still a young featherman.

At that time, the world still belonged to the Mages!

However, he was unable to stop Yu Yun because Yu Yun was almost as powerful as he was.

Once Yu Yun broke through, he would no longer be a match for him.

Perhaps the feather king also hoped that Yu Yun would kill this new mage.

Perhaps he was very weak!
