525 Three Blessings

Bang!

Far away in the center of the Central Region, Patriarch Press’s face gradually turned ashen as he read the information in front of him. He clenched his fists tightly, making cracking sounds.

“Eli summoned the World Will and suppressed the Phoenix King of Thousand Leaves to the level of a divine tree. He then easily defeated the Phoenix King and killed Sabodier in Bloodline City!” At this moment, Patriarch Press felt that his bloodline was about to burn.

He did not understand how things had turned out like this.

How could that fellow, Eli, summon the world’s will? After all, even their families did not have any means to summon the world’s will, so Eli’s means were completely out of their plans.

What was even more worrying was that the Thousand Leaves Warlock that Eli had killed was a lord of the Press family.

He gritted his teeth. This was the first time he felt so troubled.

The combat power of Thousand Leaves was almost the top combat power of a few large families. The death of one of them meant that their combat potential had been greatly reduced.

Moreover, they were still facing the Lich Tower.

As more and more ancient and dormant Warlocks joined the faction, the faction expanded tremendously. Even they were finding it more and more troublesome.

“Eli.” He gritted his teeth and read out the name.

If it weren’t for this man, they wouldn’t be in so much trouble.

However, with the establishment of the Bloodline Alliance, it meant that there was no room for negotiation between the two groups. They represented the interests of the two forces. One was the ancient bloodline family, and the other was the bloodline family that had developed over the years!

The conflict between them was even more intense than the conflict with the Lich Tower.

“But no matter what, if we don’t get rid of the Bloodline Alliance, there will be many nails behind us. If we get involved in the battle with the Lich Tower, it will be really troublesome!” He gradually calmed down and pondered.

“The Bloodline Alliance has to be eliminated first before they fully develop. There is still a chance for us to fight with Eli. Otherwise, it will be troublesome later!” He pursed his lips, but his will gradually became firm.

He knew what to do!

He looked at a ring in his hand and pressed it down.

It was time for the meeting!

..

“Sir, all the family heads have left. The details of the joint cooperation have also been discussed!”

In the Tower, Alida reported to Eli.

“That’s good. I’ll leave it to you. Go do your own thing.” Eli waved his hand.

“Yes.”

Alida nodded and left quickly.

After Alida left, Eli stood up and walked to the window.

Outside the window was a valley. At this moment, in the corner of the valley, countless shadow chains were binding a huge bird to the ground. The huge bird was struggling non-stop and letting out a shrill cry.

The giant bird was the Phoenix King, and Eli had not killed it that day.

Firstly, it would be a pity to kill such a high-level magic beast, but it had fused with a large amount of black fog, which had high research value. Secondly, Eli also felt that he needed a means of transportation.

However, it was not very cooperative.

“It’s not easy to subdue such a high-level magical beast. I’ll do it myself.” Eli shook his head, then walked down the wizard tower and slowly walked towards the Phoenix King in the distance.

Seeing Eli come over, the Phoenix King struggled even more crazily and looked at Eli with anger.

Pa!

Eli walked over and gave him a slap!

The huge force directly caused the ground to cave in, and the Phoenix King was also dizzy.

At this moment, Eli’s voice entered its consciousness.

“I’ll give you two choices.” Eli extended two fingers.” First, sign a contract with me and pledge your loyalty to me. Second, I’ll kill you right here.”

With that, Eli waved his hand, and a huge wind blade leaned against the head of the Phoenix, waiting for its answer.

the Phoenix King instantly stopped moving!

Feeling the wind blades above its head and the faint killing intent, it had no doubt that if it refused, it would definitely be killed here.

A few seconds later, a hoarse voice entered Eli’s consciousness. “What contract?”

“A simple contract. I’m very considerate of you.” Eli smiled.” A master-servant contract. But as long as my lifespan runs out or I die, you’ll be free. You know very well that according to the rules of this world, it’s only a few thousand years for me. But for a creature like you, a few thousand years is nothing. How about it?”

“Exhausted lifespan?” The Phoenix King raised its head and looked at Eli. It did not believe that Eli would outlive it, so it agreed immediately.

“I agree!”

“Good!” Eli released his hand, and a contract slowly appeared.

The Phoenix King took a look and confirmed that the conditions were as they had said before. A little of its soul power drifted out onto the contract, and the contract between the two of them was immediately established.

Sensing the mysterious power of the contract, Eli smiled.

The shadow chains on the Phoenix King’s body also dissipated one by one. Its aura also slowly rose and returned to Thousand Leaves.

This was because he had signed a contract with the world will. A connection was formed between him and the world will. As time passed, it would completely integrate into the Sorcerer World, and its combat power would not be affected.

In fact, most of the foreign races in the Green Field were the same. However, they had established a connection with the world will because of their bloodline!

“From now on, you will be called Phoenix. I will fix this fragment in the Grassi Land.” Eli also made arrangements.

“Yes, my lord!” The Phoenix King did not dare to retort. It slowly stood up, and its body gradually became a few meters long.

It had also accepted his fate!

In any case, it would only take two to three thousand years. It could still afford to wait.

“Yes!”

Eli was also very happy to have subdued a thousand-leaf-level combat power, and a smile appeared on his face.

Kakaka!

At this moment, a cracking sound suddenly entered Eli’s ears. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Eli looked toward the source of the sound and saw that the giant shadow egg in the distance had suddenly cracked. A five-headed giant snake slowly crawled out from it, and the aura it emitted had reached the level of the fifth circle.

“Hydra!” Looking at the giant snake, Eli’s eyes lit up.

Without a doubt, Hydra’s advancement had ended.

At this moment, Hydra was also moving quickly toward Eli, exuding joy. However, when it saw the giant bird behind Eli, it froze!

He turned to look at Eli, his gaze as if to say, I’ve only been away for a few days, and you actually have a new pet?

Looking at Hydra’s reaction, Eli laughed out loud. He was about to explain things to the little fellow, but before he could speak, a majestic life force suddenly spread out from afar.

“No way!”

Eli stopped what he was doing and looked into the distance.

The withered Hill’s charred book cover suddenly began to crack, and a touch of green gradually emitted. At the same time, an excited voice said,

“Father, Hill has successfully advanced!”

A bell-like voice entered Eli’s ears.

Eli pursed his lips. He felt that there were too many surprises today.

Three happy occasions.
