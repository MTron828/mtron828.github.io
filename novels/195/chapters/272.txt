273 The War is Coming

“Tower master Vivika, my Lord asked me to give this to you!”

In the Tower, Nina looked at Vivika, the student of Eli and the master of the bloodline tower. She was currently one of the highest-ranking people on the West Coast.

As far as she knew, the bloodline tower used to be a force with only one or two third-circle warlocks, but it was forcibly elevated to this level by His Excellency.

His master was too strong!

!!

Nina sighed and looked at Vivika seriously. She took out the space ring and handed it over.

Vivika was a little confused, but she still took the ring!

At this moment, her entire body was tightly covered. Not only was she wearing a gray Mage robe that covered her entire body, but she was also wearing a mask that completely covered her face!

As the master of the bloodline tower, it would be troublesome if others knew that she was in contact with the mage forces.

In fact, as time passed, the status of Mages became lower and lower, and there were fewer and fewer of them. However, their attitude towards Mages also became more and more severe!

“What is this?” Vivika asked.

“You’ll know when you see it!” Nina had some guesses about what was inside because two years ago, Eli had asked them to make some things, they were parts for a spell formation!

Considering the plight of the bloodline tower over the years, it was clear what was inside.

It should be a large number of spell formations!

“What is it?” Vivika didn’t know that. She just looked at the ring and pondered!

A few seconds later, she extended her consciousness into the ring, and the things inside were reflected in her consciousness!

The space of a few dozen cubic meters was filled with crystals. They were the core of a spell formation, and unlike ordinary elemental spell formations, each core was blood-red in color.

That feeling … It was like fresh blood!

In a war, they had naturally collected spell formations before, but the Holy tower’s spell formation felt completely different from this. It was as if they were two different types!

It was as if it was specially made for warlocks!

And the level seemed to be ridiculously high!

She observed carefully and found that the lowest level was at the second circle level, and many of them were at the third-circle level. Not to mention the bloodline tower, even in the hourglass, there might not be a single person who could refine a spell formation of this level!

Her teacher must have spent a long time creating this many spell formations!

Could it be that her teacher had already anticipated that she would come to ask for help?

“Teacher!” Vivika was a little touched.

She held the ring in her hand and took a deep breath. With these spell formations, it should be of great help to the war. She just didn’t know how effective these spell formations would be!

At the same time, Vivika suddenly felt a crystal ball in her space ring shake!

This was the crystal ball that he had given to her student, Aisha, and it would only be used in an emergency.

Something big had happened!

Vivika’s heart skipped a beat!

She immediately took out the crystal ball and sensed the information inside!

“The Holy tower ambushed the warlocks in the Silver Moon Valley. Our people suffered heavy losses, and more Holy tower warlocks are quickly gathering, ready to launch the first major attack!”

After reading the message, Vivika immediately stood up.

She looked at Nina and quickly said, “Please thank teacher for me. There’s a problem on the battlefield. I have to return!”

“Alright!” Nina nodded.

After that, Vivika quickly left iris under Nina’s arrangement. After leaving, Vivika removed her disguise and flew into the sky, heading toward Silvermoon Valley.

“I hope I can make it in time!”

Vivika held the ring and activated it as fast as she could. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

After she left, Nina came to Eli’s tower.

“My Lord, your ring has been given to lady Vivika. She asked me to thank you on her behalf!” She said.

“I know,” Eli said calmly.

Looking at the calm Eli, Nina asked, “My Lord, there’s something I don’t quite understand. Can you give me an answer?”

“Go ahead.”

“Why doesn’t Your Excellency take the initiative to attack? with Your Excellency there, it should be much easier!” Nina asked.

Hearing this, Eli shot Nina a strange look.

It seemed that he had to teach her his way of survival.

“Nina, come in and I’ll have a good chat with you. You’re still too young!” Eli opened the door of the Wizard Tower and invited.

“En!”

After a while, Eli’s voice rang out non-stop, while Nina made “oh oh oh” sounds from time to time as if she had been inspired.

After a full three hours, making sure that Nina’s thoughts had been corrected, Eli let her go.

..

At the same time.

Silver Moon River Valley.

A green arc of light streaked across the territory of the bloodline tower, and Vivika slowly descended.

She looked around and saw that a large number of warlocks were ready to go. They had their weapons in their hands and the team had already been assembled, ready to set off at any time.

...

“I made it!”

Vivika took a deep breath and relaxed.

Naturally, Vivika’s landing was noticed. Soon, the crowd dispersed, and several third-circle warlocks approached, including Nikola, her student Aisha, and others.

“Teacher, you’re finally back!” Aisha was the first to come to Vivika.

“yes, I rushed back as soon as I received your message!” Vivika replied.

“Tower master Vivika, you’re back. I’ll leave the team to you!” Nikola stepped forward. At this time, he was at the limit of third circle and had the highest combat power here.

“The people from the Holy tower are approaching. Should we set off immediately? ” A third-circle Warlock asked.

“No!” Vivika shook her head and refused.

“??”

The warlocks were puzzled, and Nikola was also puzzled.

“Of course, there is a reason. Before the war, we have to get familiar with these things!” Vivika smiled and took out her space ring!

...

The next second, the item in the ring appeared on the ground.

Smoke filled the air.

The three-circle warlocks also took a few steps back subconsciously and looked at the smoke.

A few seconds later, the smoke dispersed.

Looking at the large number of magic circle cores piled up on the ground, even though they were only two to three meters high, the few third-circle warlocks’ mouths were wide open. They looked at the magic circle, then at Vivika, each and every one of them showing a shocked expression.

“What is this?”

A three-circle warlock looked at the spell formation on the ground and gasped.

It was not that they had not seen these before, but they could not imagine where their tower master had gotten so many spell formations from. Could it be that she had left this time to get these?

“They are spell formations!”

Vivika smiled. “don’t just stand there, we have to distribute this quickly. I feel that the people from the Holy tower seem to be getting closer!”

Everyone nodded and began to distribute the spell formation.

Only Nikola felt a sense of familiarity when he looked at the spell formation.

A few seconds later, he took a deep breath. He recognized who this feeling belonged to!

It was his master.

However, he had a question in his heart. When did his lordship become proficient in spell formations?

Nikola was confused. Suddenly, a loud buzzing sound resounded above the bloodline tower. He instantly raised his head because this sound only meant one thing!

The people from the Holy tower were here!

The war was about to begin!
