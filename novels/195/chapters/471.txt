472 Blood Sacrifice, Change of Situation

The orange sunlight pierced through the space and enveloped the main city of the Twilight Lizard Family, GammaCity!

Standing in the sky above the main city, Eli looked down at the city on the ground.

The ancient city was covered in blood. The dark main road of the city turned scarlet as it extended towards the center of the city. There was a huge altar made of countless flesh and bones!

White bones were everywhere, and blood and flesh flowed everywhere!

Scarlet blood reflected in Eli’s eyes. A rough estimate was that there were at least tens of thousands of people who made up this altar. Including the other areas of the city, at least hundreds of thousands of people died here!

Hundreds of thousands of people was not a small number. Moreover, this was once the main city of the Twilight Lizard Family!

“How ruthless!”

Eli pursed his lips and turned to look into the distance.

He wasn’t the only one there. The other forces from the eastern part of the Western Regions had arrived as well. Everyone looked at the ground with fear and trepidation, not knowing what to do.

They were both forces in the eastern part of the Western Region. The Twilight Lizards were the top forces in the eastern region, but they were actually destroyed overnight. What if the enemy was one of them?

Thinking of this answer, everyone broke out in cold sweats.

“Sir Eli, you actually came over. I wonder what you think of this matter!” At this moment, an old acquaintance flew towards Eli and asked him.

Seeing that it was holy sword, Eli shook his head and said, “I don’t have any thoughts!”

Although he guessed that it was the Heart of the Abyss, there was really no evidence for such a thing, so there was naturally no need to say it out loud!

There was another reason. Although the forces in the eastern region had a good relationship with the Bloodline Tower, they were still far away from the Bloodline Tower. Therefore, they were actually more closely related to the central region, or rather, some forces in the Warlock Union!

At this moment, in front of the group of Warlocks, a dark-skinned Warlock with sharp eyes was looking down at the ground with an angry expression.

His name was Fayed Hamis, and the Hamis family was stationed in the Western Regions. The Hamis family was a member of the Warlock Union and was also a superior force to the Twilight Lizard and other forces.

In fact, in this world where status was determined by bloodline, the power of the family was delineated by levels. However, at the end of the day, it was all related to those top families. Most of the forces in the Eastern Region were related to them.

The Bloodline Tower had originally belonged to the Amana Family, but they had left the family, so they had no dealings with these major forces. In fact, the Warlock Union had sent out the signal last time, but unfortunately, that Warlock had been killed before he could finish his mission!

“Does anyone know who did it?” Fayed gritted his teeth and looked at everything before him.

They could ignore the disappearance of the Warlock Union’s camp and the death of the Warlock because those were not directly related to them.

However, this time, the Twilight Lizard was supported by their family in the Western Region. If it died for no reason, it would be a disgrace to the family. It could even be said to be a challenge to them!

“Milord, the only thing we have found is that the corpses on the ground were sacrificed, and their souls were taken away. I guess it might be done by some evil forces. Moreover, it wasn’t just here. The twelve main cities of the Twilight Lizards were destroyed at almost the same time.” A Warlock walked up and said.

“You don’t have to tell me that!” Fayed gritted his teeth and looked at everyone present. “No matter who did it, our Hamis family will not let them off!

“This is a provocation to the Hamis family. I will investigate this matter thoroughly!!”

His angry words reached everyone’s ears, and Eli was deep in thought.

Currently, he had no intention of contacting the Warlock Union.

However, he felt even more anxious!

Although there was no evidence, he still felt that it was the Heart of Abyss at work!

“What are they trying to do?” Elo frowned.

Although he knew what the ultimate goal of the Heart of Abyss was, he did not know the details. However, what happened today was a bad sign!

Massacre the city!

Hundreds of thousands died!

The Heart of Abyss was getting more and more shameless.

“But … No matter what they want to do, I just need to make things difficult for them. Since the Hamis family wants to investigate thoroughly, I’ll give them some evidence.

“I also need time to develop!” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Eli turned to look at Fayed, who was not far away!

If they offended a top-tier faction, the Heart of the Abyss would definitely not have an easy time. At the very least, they would not be able to free themselves for a short period of time. Instead, they would be in trouble!

Thinking of what to do, Eli smiled.

..

Time passed by slowly!

Under the leadership of the Hamis family, almost all the factions in the eastern region had sent people to participate in this operation. Their goal was to thoroughly investigate who was behind the Twilight Family’s incident!

The Bloodline Tower kept a low profile. However, the evidence they had gathered in secret was slowly spread. Of course, it wasn’t about the demons but about the actions of the Heart of the Abyss!

This evidence was enough for them to focus their attention on the Heart of the Abyss!

Of course, it might not be that sufficient, but to the arrogant members of the Warlock Union and one of the top Warlock forces, the Hamis family, evidence was not important!
