188 Feast

At the same time.

Molin Kingdom, a Kingdom of Knights to the South of the Calina Kingdom.

The Sunbird Warlock family.

“This is over.”

Ji He, the first circle warlock who was the clan leader of the Sunbird clan, was hiding in a house. He trembled as he looked at the scene outside the window gap, his face full of despair.

This was their family’s main territory. Half an hour ago, it was suddenly invaded by the undead.

Outside the window, a large number of undead were making soul-shaking sounds. Translucent undead was dancing in the sky and attacking the warlocks on the ground.

One by one, the warlocks died, and the dead warlocks were quickly transformed into new spirits to be resurrected and participate in the battle of slaughtering their clansmen.

These spirits of the dead were different from ordinary spirits of the dead. They were all under control, and the one controlling them was an even more powerful spirit of the dead.

He looked up and saw a huge undead hovering in the sky, exuding a terrifying and horrifying aura. What made Ji He despair was that this aura was not weaker than the two-circle warlock.

An undead at the peak of the second circle!

Ji He could not understand how such a powerful undead could appear here.

But all he could do was hide here and pray that he would not be discovered because once he was discovered, he would be dead.

At the thought of this, he lowered his head. The sounds of fighting outside were like knives stabbing into his heart. After all, these were his clansmen and descendants.

Normally, he should have fought alongside them, but he didn’t have the courage to.

A few minutes later, he looked up again and found that the undead in the sky had disappeared.

“Did he leave?” Ji He was a little surprised.

“I’ve found you!”

Suddenly, a voice rang out. Ji He felt that his surroundings had turned cold. He froze instantly and slowly turned his head to look behind him. The undead from before was staring at him with a faint smile.

In the next second, a battle began.

A second later, the spirit Nikola took a deep breath and turned the Warlock into a spirit as well. He then passed through the physical building and floated toward the sky, looking at the ground.

“The creatures here are almost all gone.” Nikola looked at the Warlock’s camp, which had no breath of living people.

“If I want to return to the third circle, I need more undead, and this is far from enough. However, there seems to be no Warlock camp nearby. It seems that I can only win by quantity. The souls of mortals can also produce qualitative changes.”

Nikola opened his arms, and all the spirits of the dead under him floated towards him as if they had been summoned and then integrated into his body. One could even see with the naked eye that his body was filled with a large number of spirits of the dead.

These were all his assets, and once he had enough of them, he would use them to return to the third circle.

Once he returned to his third circle, he would go and retrieve that bit of soul in his earring, and then he would look for an opportunity to break through to his fourth circle.

“Let the mortals experience the real world!!!”

Nikola laughed, and his huge body flew toward the city in the distance. The spirits in his body also made noise as if they were happy.

“Hiss, the situation is already that bad?” Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Half a day after Nikola left, Eli walked into the sunbird Warlock’s camp.

He had followed the aura of souls to this place, but it seemed that the situation here was not very good. He could only smell the aura of death, and also the aura of the undead.

“No, there are still living people.”

As if he had discovered something, Eli looked towards a spot not far away.

He quickly walked over and opened the door. It was an ordinary house. In the corner, a woman was dead, but she was blocking the corner with her dead body.

“It’s safe now!”

Eli frowned and moved the woman away. Only then did he see that there was a secret compartment behind the woman. He opened the secret compartment. A girl was hiding inside, covering her mouth with her hands. There were tears in her eyes, and they were filled with fear.

“Poor child!” Eli instantly understood what had happened.

The mother had blocked the door so that her daughter would have a chance to live.

Since he had seen it, he couldn’t just ignore it. Eli slowly squatted down and said gently, “Little friend, do you want to go with uncle?”

There were still tears on the girl’s face. She looked at her mother not far away and couldn’t stop her tears. Eli wanted to wipe the girl’s tears away, but the girl only retreated a little.

It was understandable that she was afraid.

“How about it? Uncle will take you out of here!”

This time, the girl bit her lip and nodded, then put down her hand that was covering her mouth.

Eli realized that it was a very delicate little girl, as cute as a doll, but at this moment, her face was covered in tears. What a poor child.

Eli carried the child out and helped her bury the girl’s mother.

Ten minutes later, he left the camp with the girl in his arms.

..

With the girl in his arms, Eli kept moving forward.

They passed by one destroyed city after another. Ordinary mortals had no chance of survival in the face of the undead army. Of course, they met some survivors, but they did not stay for long and left immediately.

On the way, Eli learned that the girl’s name was Catarina. Her mother was a Warlock in the Sunbird Warlock camp, and her father was an ordinary person.

This kind of unauthorized Union with ordinary people was not allowed in some Warlock families, but her mother still spent a lot of effort to give birth to her, but the mother and daughter were tortured by the camp.

“But she’s quite talented as a mage.”

Catarina was a talented mage. This was also one of the reasons why Eli took the girl away. The possibility of Tijie breaking through to the third circle was not high, but he still needed someone he could trust to help him manage the camp after her death. This little girl was quite suitable.

...

He would not do anything meaningless.

After he was done with his revenge, he would take a wisp of the girl’s soul and send her to the mage camp. Compared to living with him, it might be more suitable for her there.

On the way, the girl hugged him tightly.

Eli didn’t say anything. After all, she was still a child who had just lost her mother.

After half a day, he finally caught up with the undead.

It was in the capital of Molin’s Kingdom, and he wasn’t late this time.

“Let’s go. We’ve arrived!” Eli put Catarina down and led her inside by the hand.

Before he even entered the capital, more than a dozen spirits of the dead had already discovered him.

They all let out shrieks and then waved their hands as they flew over as if they had seen food.

Bang!

It was just an ordinary elemental attack, flying toward a few undead. They died instantly, and the soul power of the undead was quickly absorbed by Eli.

...

Eli felt a slight increase in his spiritual power.

“Not bad.”

Eli pursed his lips and smiled as he looked at the capital before him. How was this the city of the undead? This was clearly a banquet he had been invited to, and the undead were just dishes.

“Let’s have a big meal.”

Holding the girl’s hand, Eli walked into the capital.

The girl’s big eyes were looking at him. Although she was still young, she seemed to have a vague understanding of how powerful Eli was.

As soon as they entered the capital, a hellish scene unfolded.

There was a wide street that led to the city gate. At this time, countless people had fallen on the street, and there were even more people running and wailing on the road. Behind them were many spirits of the dead.

“Help!!!”

“Mom, where are you?” The child walked on the road in a daze.

“What are these things? are they demons from hell? How could there be such a terrifying thing?” The townsfolk were fleeing in a frenzy.

“This is God’s punishment.” The priest lowered his head, his body trembling as he prayed.

Countless people were running and wailing in pain. Everyone was in despair. Even the high and mighty Knights couldn’t deal with the undead here. The Grand Knights might be able to, but they didn’t have time to care about the civilians.

It was an apocalyptic scene.

Eli sighed. Such a scene was really disturbing his good mood.
