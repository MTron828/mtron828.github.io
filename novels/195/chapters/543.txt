544 New Experiment

The river of time flowed endlessly.

A week later!

In the laboratory!

On the silver-white table, a black tentacle covered in eyes was firmly controlled by the power of faith on the experiment table. There was also a white light shining on one side, making the black tentacle slightly calmer.

In front of the experiment table, Eli’s eyes glowed with silver light as he dissected the tentacle.

” Strictly speaking, this creature isn’t a living thing. It’s like the condensation of some evil. However, the Black Fog’s laws are quite interesting. Even if it’s dead, the laws still exist. If it’s not controlled, it’ll probably become a small-scale disaster.”

Eli was very interested in the Black Fog’s laws and had been studying them these days.

However, he was still very cautious. He only took a small part of it for research. This way, even if there were a problem, he would have a way to solve it. Moreover, a damaged, low-quality version of the tentacle would not affect him much.

After studying it for a while, he put down the scalpel.

” I have to continue analyzing the Black Fog’s laws. This law has great potential. After all, it was once one of the laws of the Eighth circle Ruler.” Eli thought for a moment, then turned his gaze to the two lights on the console.

The power of faith and the light of purification.

The former belonged to him, while the latter was from the purification rune.

These two were accidental discoveries during experiments. Previously, his own power of faith had a certain resistance against the black fog, but later, Eli accidentally discovered that when the two fused together, it had a kind of suppression against the black fog.

The black fog could not move at all in the light of the two. This was also the reason why Eli dared to experiment freely.

‘Looks like I’ll have to study the two in the future. Whether it’s my understanding of the laws of the black fog or the suppression of the black fog itself, it’s of great significance.’ Eli thought as he undressed, disinfected, and left the laboratory.

He felt that all of these were meaningful. The former would allow him to gain a better understanding of that civilization and supplement his methods. The latter would restrain it and might be of great use in the future.

“No, I still have to study my own uniqueness.” Eli did not forget the strange resistance he had shown to the black fog creatures that day in the Gray Mage Tower.

“In that case, we have to start three experiments at the same time!” Eli felt that his entire body was filled with motivation.

The feeling of doing an experiment was really great!

But at this moment, someone called out to him.

In fact, he had already guessed that the matter with the Warlock Alliance had been exposed.

“Milord, something big has happened.” Alida looked flustered and said, “Milord, just a few days ago, we discovered that all the higher-ups of the Warlock Alliance had disappeared. The reason is unknown.”

“What? Is there such a thing?”

Eli’s eyes widened in shock as he stood up from his seat.

“That’s right, my lord. There are dozens of fifth-circle Warlocks. If they were really plotting something, it would be troublesome!” Alida was worried, and all kinds of dangerous thoughts occupied her mind.

Sneak attack, opening the door to the Otherworld, the descent of the Abyss…

“Milord, what should we do?” She raised her head and asked.

Eli’s expression was calm, but he frowned and said, “Continue to observe. If there is really something big happening in the Warlock Alliance, there will naturally be traces. If there is nothing, then we wait.

“Maybe this is our chance. Don’t worry about where they’re going. As long as they show themselves, we’ll devour their power and force them out!

“Don’t worry, I’m here.”

As if he really didn’t know, Eli began to speculate.

He couldn’t even fool himself, let alone others.

“Yes, my lord.” Alida felt much more relaxed.

“Then hurry up and do it. We can’t be too careless!” Eli continued.

“Yes, sir!”

Alida anxiously left the Grassi Land.

Beside the window of the Tower, Eli watched her leave and sighed, “It’s time for the Warlock Alliance to end!”

..

In the blink of an eye, a week had passed!

Eli started three experiments at the same time, but the focus was still on analyzing the black fog.

At the same time, under Eli’s hint, the Bloodline Tower also began to devour the Warlock Alliance’s territory. Although many factions were puzzled, they still did so.

Even the Lich Tower was deeply puzzled.

However, they still did not move. They wanted to see what the Warlock Alliance was going to do.

But after a month, they finally couldn’t sit still anymore.

At this moment, a third of the Warlock Alliance’s territory had been devoured, but the Warlock Alliance did not have any reaction. They finally realized that something had gone wrong with the Warlock Alliance’s upper echelons.

Therefore, they began to attack the Warlock Alliance in a hurry.

The war had begun!

However, the outcome of this war was beyond everyone’s expectations.

In just a month, two-thirds of the Warlock Alliance had been occupied by the Bloodline Alliance, while the rest had been occupied by the Lich Tower. The Warlock Alliance had been absurdly destroyed just like that.

As for the higher-ups of the Warlock Alliance, they did not show their faces until Heaven City was destroyed!

However, when they arrived at the clans-lands, they were shocked to find that these fifth circle Bloodline Soul Lamps had been extinguished for a long time. They were already dead.

This shocked the continent again, and soon, it became an unsolvable mystery.

..

Another month passed.

“Sir, the Warlock Alliance’s forces have been completely subdued. Currently, the Lich Tower in the north is the only one on the continent. As for the western region, the central and southern regions, as well as the eastern and southern regions, they are all under our control.

“The era of the Warlock Alliance is over,” Alida said absentmindedly.

Even she felt that the past month was surreal.

The Warlock Alliance was gone just like that?

In the blink of an eye, they had become the number one faction of the human world!

Ridiculous!

“Yeah, it’s already over.” Eli nodded.

In fact, a few months ago, when he killed those higher-ups of the Warlock Alliance, the end of the Warlock Alliance was already decided.

However, the trouble was not over yet. There was still the Lich Tower!

Compared to the Warlock Alliance, this was an organization that truly wanted to destroy the world. Moreover, after so many years of development and the characteristics of the Lich, they were much more difficult to deal with than the Warlock Alliance.

Of course, the two sides would not have any conflicts in the short term.

They all needed to develop and digest.

“Sir, this is what we obtained from the Warlock Alliance’s treasure vault. However, it’s very strange. Their treasure vault has almost been emptied. We suspect that it has been moved, and we’re still investigating.” Alida said as she took out another ring.

Eli nodded and opened the ring.

The space inside was not big, and the number was much less than he had imagined.

However, Eli was not surprised. They had used up all their resources at the Gray Mage Tower to clear a path for Eli.

However, as a large force, even if it was just the remaining loot, there were still many that Eli needed.

After picking and choosing, Eli still found quite a few good things.
