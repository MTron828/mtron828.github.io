When he reached the sky above Bloodline City, Eli noticed that something was wrong.

On the ground, the once-prosperous Bloodline City was even more prosperous. The city had been expanded by another level, and the number of people had increased. However, most of the people were in a hurry, and there were many Warlocks holding weapons and injured.

The Potions Department in the distance was surrounded by a thick green fog, which told Eli that the Potions Department had been producing potions all this time. The Alchemy Department in the distance was similar, and there were tinkling sounds coming from it.

Of course, that was not the main thing. He smelled panic.

It’s not a metaphor but a real smell. The kind of hormone exuded a disgusting smell.

What was it that made them afraid?

Thinking back to the edge of the coast that he saw outside the world, Eli had an answer.

“Looks like something happened to the Sea Tribe that I don’t know about!” Eli took out the statue that was used to communicate with Laura from his interspatial ring. If something really happened, Laura would definitely leave some information behind.

As expected, when Eli’s spirit connected with the statue, a series of messages appeared.

” Sir, something big has happened. Clint of the Gigantic Octopus Clan went missing during his shift. The Gigantic Octopus Clan is furious, and traces of humans have been found nearby.

“The Imperial Dynasty held a meeting. The aggressive faction proposed to attack the humans, but it was rejected in the end. Gigantic Octopus Family changed their member in the council, named Cedi.

“Cedi is dead. I don’t know who killed him!

“A peak fifth circle creature from the Deep Sea Demon Whale Clan has awakened. The power of the Deep Sea Demon Whale Clan has increased greatly, and they have become the new leader of the aggressive Faction.

” The balance has been broken. For the first time, the aggressive faction has surpassed the moderate faction.

“A new round of royal rotation has begun. This time, the Deep Sea Demon Whale Clan leads the council.

“The Imperial Dynasty meeting has begun again. The war proposal has been raised again.

“My lord, a war is about to break out!

“My lord, are you still not awake?”

The messages were arranged from fifty years ago to two years ago, and the content displayed was also about the major events that had happened to the Sea Tribe during this period. However, it had already told Eli why there were so many auras on the coast and also made him understand why most cities felt a little lonely. It turned out that the war had begun.

The Sea Tribe War!

This was another war between the human race and the sea race after thousands of years. This was too shocking!

“I didn’t expect so many major events to happen in fifty years!” Eli shook his head, but he was even more confused. Even if there was a war, it shouldn’t be so isolated.

At the very least, he didn’t sense any of the familiar faces he had contacted in Bloodline City.

Even Nikola, Hydra, and Phoenix were not there.

What exactly happened?

“Eh, something’s not right. There’s still one more person.” Eli frowned and suddenly sensed an aura. Jin Ji didn’t seem to have left. He was still in Bloodline City!

This was normal. After all, he was in charge of finance, which was more important than fighting.

With a flash, Eli flew to every corner of the city.

..

“Where did the lord go?”

Jin Ji looked at the documents in front of him and sighed in his heart.

Although the war only started two years ago, the terror of the Sea Tribe still made him feel apprehensive. Whether it was the number of high-level combat members or the size of the army, this was a force that surpassed the Warlock Alliance and the Lich Tower. This would be the strongest enemy after the establishment of the Bloodline Alliance.

But that was not the worst thing. The worst thing was that Sir Eli was not here!

Ever since his disappearance 50 years ago, they had never appeared again.

It was the same even if war broke out.

Eli was the leader of the faction. His absence was not good news for the stability of the faction. There were even many rumors on the continent.

Eli was dead, Eli had fallen into a secret realm and was heavily injured, Eli’s lifespan had reached its limit, he was about to enter old age and did not dare to come out…

Even though they had tried their best to extinguish the rumors, there was only so much they could do.

“Could it be that the lord really…” Jin Ji couldn’t help but ponder.

Eli was at the fifth circle and could live for at least 3,000 years. He still had a few hundred years to live. How could he die? No, what if Eli was older than him?

Before Eli came to the Central Mainland, he was already a fourth-circle sun warlock. Moreover, he was Herman’s student. In that case, he couldn’t be too young. It seemed like many years had passed since then. Could it be… Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“No, it’s absolutely impossible…” He shook his head in panic.

“Impossible what?” Suddenly, a voice entered his ears.

“Naturally, it is impossible…” He subconsciously wanted to answer, but he suddenly realized that this was his room. Why was there a sound? Who was it?

Jin Ji quickly turned his head and found a figure sitting on the sofa not far away.

His mouth gradually opened, and his pupils shrank, almost shouting out, “Lord Eli, you’re finally back.”

“Yes.” Eli nodded and gestured for him to sit down. He asked, “I just came back. Tell me the details of what happened recently.”

“Good, good, my lord.” Jin Ji could hardly hide his joy.

The Lord is back!

He sat down and immediately began to tell Eli about what had happened over the years.

Soon, Eli had a clearer understanding of the details. He also understood the disadvantages he had faced over the years and, most importantly, why Alida had left Bloodline City.

“Are you saying that in the deep sea, there are three royal families gathered in the southern region at the same time, millions of sea races gathered, and three kings of the sea race personally led the army?” Eli looked at him and asked for confirmation.

The attitude of the Deep Sea race was so firm this time. There were three Deep Sea Sovereigns, and they were all peak fifth circle existences. It seemed that they really wanted to destroy humankind.

“Yes, sir. Your student David has left, along with the Pagoda Master and the others. Almost all the powerhouses of the human forces have gone. There’s even a hidden peak fifth-circle warlock who has joined the war! “Jin Ji looked anxious.

“Oh, there’s actually a hidden peak fifth circle warlock on the continent?”

Eli was surprised.

However, he shook his head. This was normal. After all, the Mage’s World was very big. It was reasonable for some Warlocks to be hidden. However, they actually came out to help in the battle. This showed the seriousness of the matter!

Of course, there was another reason. This time, it was not an internal conflict between the humans but a battle between races. If the humans were really defeated, they would not have a good ending!

“Yes, that’s a lord called Kyle.” Jin Ji nodded.

“Alright, I got it!” Eli stood up.

“Sir, where are you going?” Jin Ji asked.

Eli glanced at him.” To end the war, of course!”

It just so happened that he had not fought after his breakthrough!

The marine race was a good opponent. He also wanted to see how strong he would be after his breakthrough.

Jin Ji’s eyes lit up, and he said, “Sir, do you want me to go with you?”

“Don’t. You should guard the rear. Your mission is equally important!” Eli was determined.

“Then I wish you a safe journey!” Jin Ji nodded.

In fact, he had already felt that his lord was different.

If he had seen his lord in the past, he might have been able to see a little. However, at this moment, he could not see Eli clearly at all. It even reminded him… that the world’s will had descended.

When he thought about the disappearance of Eli, a shocking guess appeared in his mind.

“Sir, you broke through…” Jin Ji couldn’t help but raise his head and ask.

But when he looked up, the room in front of him was empty. There was no sign of Eli.

Instantly, his guess became even more certain.

His spirit was shaken, and he gradually confirmed his guess!
