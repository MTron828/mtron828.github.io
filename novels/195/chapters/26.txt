Chapter 27: The Beginning of the Experiment

Translator: Lonelytree

“Teacher, you guys are too much. How could you leave me there?”

In the library, Herman was still talking about what happened yesterday, but when scholar Clement looked at him calmly, he stopped.

His “respect” for his teacher had almost become a habit.

“You’re scolding me again, ” Herman mumbled in a low voice as if he was looking at Eli not far away for help.

“You’d better not provoke teacher anymore,” Eli said with a smile.

It was as if Herman was always the injured one.

Today was the second day after the banquet, and they came to visit the teacher according to the daily routine.

Clement sat on the chair as if that was the only thing he had the strength left to do. He looked at the disappointing Herman, then at Eli, and took out a bag from the table.

“Eli, this is the reward the library is giving you.”

“Oh? ” curious, Eli took the bag.

In the bag, there were three shiny gold tarls.

“What is this?” In fact, he had already guessed what it was.

“This is the reward you snatched from the Knight Academy and the mystic academy. It’s not much, but you know that it’s hard for the library now.” Count Clement said as he looked at Eli.

“Thank you, teacher.” Why would Eli mind that it was too little? This was an unexpected fortune!

He could start his potion simplification work early.

“yes, and the Count. If it’s possible, try to maintain a friendly relationship and get to know more important people. It’ll always be helpful to you.” He saw Eli pick up the gold tarls, and then he reminded.

“I know, teacher.” Eli smiled, then took out two gold tarls and placed the bag back on the table.

“What is this?” Scholar Clement did not seem to understand.

“teacher, if it weren’t for you, I wouldn’t have had the chance. Just take it that I’m contributing this golden tars to buy you some new research materials.” Eli replied with a smile.

“This won’t do!” Clement shook his head. He was a scholar, so how could he accept gold coins from students?

“Teacher, it’s not much. If you hadn’t accepted me as your student, I would be an ordinary librarian.” Eli said again.

He was a person who knew how to repay someone’s kindness.

“Alright, then.” This time, scholar Clement did not refuse, but his gaze on Eli became more kinder.

...

In the blink of an eye, another month had passed.

Eli went to Moore Manor a total of three times to help the count train his horses. He tamed about twenty horses, and the process went smoothly without any accidents. Eli also received two gold tarls.

The main reason was that the Count’s wild horses were not transported to the horse track together but in batches.

After all, the horse track was only so big. In addition, there were already some horses raised there. It was impossible to keep nearly a hundred horses. They could only be transported in batches, tamed, and then transported away.

Regarding this, Eli didn’t have much of an opinion. Anyway, the manor wasn’t far from the city, and he could also make a trip to his secret base along the way. It was just a few more trips, no big deal.

“It’s time to find Roland.”

He already had four gold tarls in his hand, enough for him to carry out the first round of experiments.

He had not seen Roland for a long time.

...

Three days later in the Rose Chamber of Commerce.

In a simple room on the second floor that was not considered luxurious, Eli was sitting on the sofa, and opposite him was a friend he had known for a long time, Roland.

However, compared to more than three years ago, Roland was more mature now. He had black hair and blue eyes that were less translucent and more shrewd than before. He sat opposite Eli and said with a smile, “Eli, I’ve found all the materials you wanted.”

“Thanks.” Eli nodded.

Two days ago, he told Roland what he needed, and then Roland helped him gather the materials with the power of the Chamber of Commerce. In just two days, he had collected all the materials.

It could only be said that Roland really had the connection. If Eli were to collect them, he might not even be able to collect them in a few months. This also reflected the importance of networking.

“Hey, by the way, what do you need so many materials for?” Roland was a little confused.

“I’ve been doing some research on Herbology recently, and I think it’s very interesting.” Eli found an excuse.

“I see.” Roland nodded. He had now taken over his family’s business and was getting to know more and more people, but he had fewer and fewer close friends. Eli was a very special one among them.

Eli was very special in the sense that he didn’t care about anything.

It made him feel like Eli was looking at the world from a higher level, but it was contradictory. How could an ordinary person give him such a feeling? He could only attribute it to his reverence for scholars like Eli.

“However, I can’t give you these materials for free.” Roland already had the self-awareness of a businessman.

“That’s for sure,” Smiling, Eli took out four golden tars, which was all he had.

The experiment would definitely take a long time, and he did not know how long it would last.

“Well, I didn’t expect you to be a rich man.” Roland laughed when he saw the gold tarls and then put them away.

“I’ll arrange for someone to send these materials to your house.” Roland stood up, but the next second, he added, “oh, by the way, I heard that there’s a high-end place in Liuying Street, and there are even down-and-out noble women there. Do you want to go together? ”

Eli cast a strange glance at Roland. ‘Great, am I that kind of person?’

“You can go on without me.”

“When the time comes, I’ll call you.”

“You’ve changed a lot.”

“You haven’t changed at all!”

...

Eli’s experiment began.

Because the money had been gathered in advance, it allowed him to start the work of potion-making, but this work was much more difficult and complicated than Eli had imagined.

Due to the lack of notes on potion-making, Eli had to explore many things on his own, and the progress of his experiment had been stuck at the first stage. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

He divided the potion work into three stages, which were the preliminary screening of the materials, the specific replacement of the materials, and the configuration of the potion.

The first stage was the most time-consuming and money-consuming one because he had to spend a lot of time collecting the herbs that had the effect of the original potion. This could only be done through repeated experiments.

However, this was nothing much for Eli. After all, he could learn a lot from it.

As for when the magic potion would be refined, that was completely up to fate. He wasn’t that anxious.

Three months later, the first stage of Eli’s work stopped again.

It wasn’t because he had succeeded but because he had run out of money.

The high-intensity experiments consumed materials at a rapid rate. In just three months, all the materials he bought were depleted. However, for some unknown reason, the horses did not arrive in the past three months, which meant that he did not have new money for the experiments.

Of course, he could earn a salary from the library, but he was not even a scholar. His salary was limited, and it was completely inadequate.

“I can’t just steal or rob.” On this day, Eli had just finished tidying up the books in the library and was on his way to visit his teacher.

He pushed the door open.

Scholar Clement was cursing and waving his hands, and Herman was standing in the corner with his head lowered.

What was happening?
