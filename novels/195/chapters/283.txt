284 The Final Battle

Holy tower!

As the strongest force that had come to the West Coast, they occupied the most prosperous and resource-rich land on the West Coast. Even their headquarters was far more prosperous than other places.

Not to mention the headquarters that was as large as a city, which could accommodate hundreds of thousands of people, there were also thousands of Mage towers standing in the city.

And the most magnificent of these buildings was none other than the central tower of the Holy tower.

It occupied dozens of acres and was 300 meters tall. White stones that could increase the concentration of bloodline were used on the outside. From the outside, it looked like a white Holy tower emitting a bright light.

At this moment, two people were standing at the top of the light.

One was fat, and the other was normal. One was wearing a Sorcerer’s robe covered with sand, while the other was wearing a tight-fitting Sorcerer’s robe. The two of them did not talk, just stood there quietly.

Situ’s eyes were gloomy as he suddenly said, “Woox, what do you think our chances of winning are?”

“It depends on how many more tricks you have up your sleeve, Sir.” Woox shook his head helplessly. “I’m afraid it’s very difficult to win this war by relying on our people alone. We can’t even deal with the three-headed snake, let alone others!”

“Three-headed giant snake!” Situ pondered!

He had also been to the front line and had seen the giant snake on the battle line.

It was indeed very strong, ridiculously strong.

Not only did it have three elemental abilities, but its huge body was almost made up of elements. It was difficult for their people to cause any substantial damage to it, so it had caused great trouble for them all these years.

And from the information he got, the giant snake was actually Herman’s pet.

Just how powerful was Herman?

In fact, he had never seen this person before. Ever since the battle at the Silver Moon Lake, this person seemed to have disappeared without a trace. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

No matter how critical the situation was, he didn’t show his face. He was as cunning as a Groundhog!

Otherwise, he would have asked master Klay to kill Herman and then clean up the bloodline tower.

The worst thing was that this person didn’t show up, but he always provided the bloodline tower with support, causing them to be in a passive state. Year after year, the disadvantages accumulated, causing the situation to become like this.

In fact, they had nowhere to retreat to!

“Woox, do you regret it?” Suddenly, Situ turned to look at Woox.

“there’s nothing to regret. It’s just my own choice. I’m responsible for my own choice.” Woox’s eyes were calm as if the Holy tower was not the one that was about to be destroyed.

“Alright!” Situ revealed a smile.

The Holy tower master he had subdued was more decisive than he had thought!

He patted Woox’s shoulder and smiled. “You don’t need to worry. Lord Klay will come for the final battle.

“Most of the higher-ups like Vivika will show up. If Herman doesn’t show up, he’ll lose his people. If he does, he’ll die with them!”

Woox nodded as he heard Situ’s laughter, but the worry in his eyes was not gone. He sighed deeply and said,

“I hope so.”

..

Eli shook the dice, and the Golden dice of fate flickered with a strange color as if there were golden threads shaking around it.

He had already forgotten how many times he had used this divination spell.

It seemed to have been a few hundred times, and the lifespan consumed by this spell had probably reached about 7000 to 8000 years, which was nearly ten times his current lifespan. This also made the die of fate a little special.

The die kept spinning and only stopped after a full ten minutes.

“17 points!”

Seeing the number, Eli put away the die.

Another twenty years passed, and he had improved by two points.

Klay was indeed very strong. Should he make a move or not?

After all, this battle was too important. Although the winning rate was a little low, it was not unacceptable.

“Oh, that’s right, my Silver Eye has also reached the third level. If I curse Klay as well, it shouldn’t be a problem!”

… Eli pondered.

He persisted in using the silver eye every day, and the spell was at the third circle.

Then there was the curse. To be honest, it was not that useful because he didn’t even know Klay’s full name to curse him. But it was better than nothing.

Of course, he also had a trump card.

“Can the soul Blade kill Klay?” Eli rolled the die again.

20 points!

Eli’s eyes brightened as he understood.

After 500 years of accumulation, it was time for this spell to be exposed.

..

Time passed by slowly, and the tense atmosphere also slowly spread.

In the bloodline tower, a huge amount of resources were mobilized under Vivika’s command. Tens of thousands of warlocks had crossed the Sofia mountain range and arrived at the area of the Holy tower, gathering in the direction of the Holy tower.

Even a few airships were flying North.

Behind the Army, there was a long supply of resources that stretched over a hundred kilometers, like a long Dragon.

On the other side, the Holy tower had also abandoned all external forces. All the warlocks had gathered in the Holy tower’s main city, and the remaining resources had been taken out without reservation, preparing for the final battle.

They could not afford to lose to the bloodline tower.
