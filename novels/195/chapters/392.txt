393 New War

The news that the war was about to break out quickly spread, and everyone was in an uproar.

In the past few decades, the Bloodline Tower had been developing rapidly. It wasn’t that there weren’t any forces that wanted to tear off a piece of fat meat. However, under the intimidation of the Golden Cicada Chamber of Commerce and the Charm Mansion, most of the forces didn’t dare to make a move, and the few that dared to make a move could be easily dealt with.

However, this time was different. The enemy of the Bloodline Tower was the Eight-Armed Naga, one of the top forces in the Western Region.

In terms of strength, they had a powerful Radiant Sun Warlock and were a force to be reckoned with.

Unless it was a warlock force of the same level, no one wanted to provoke them.

And that wasn’t all. The Eight-Armed Naga had no less than four or five Level 3 forces under its command, and each of them was on the same level as the Bloodline Tower or even higher. Some of them were only called Level 3 forces because they didn’t have any powerhouses on the level of the Radiant Sun.

This time, the Bloodline Tower was facing a powerful and seemingly invincible opponent.

As for the deterrence of the Golden Cicada Merchant Association and the Charm Mansion, it was useless.

After all, although the two factions were powerful, they weren’t as strong in terms of combat power. If the Eight-Armed Naga were determined to destroy the Bloodline Tower, they would at most provide some help to the Bloodline Tower.

As the news spread, the culprit of the attack was revealed.

The Akasha Family, which belonged to the Eight-Armed Naga Family.

” The Akasha Family is the strongest third-grade force under the command of the Eight-Armed Naga. It could almost be called a second-grade force. ”

After reading the information, he looked up at Liliana.

” Sir, this information contains almost all the information about the Akasha Family. It was collected by our Charm Residence previously. I hope it will be of help to you! ” Liliana was sitting across from him. She was wearing a black dress, revealing half of her fair legs.

At this moment, she was looking at Eli with worry in her eyes.

“Yes.” Eli nodded and continued to look down.

“The bloodline of the clan is the Lava Fire Dragon, a fourth circle ultimate bloodline. It’s best at close combat and fire attacks.

“The clan is extremely powerful. They had one peak Radiant Moon Warlock, one Full Moon Warlock, two Crescent Moon and Waning Moon Warlocks, and four Morning Star Warlocks. They were practically the strongest faction below rank 2. Once a Warlock advanced to the Radiant Sun, the faction will advance.

“Due to their special bloodline, this family’s Warlocks are more skilled in combat and have great combat strength. There are roughly three hundred third-circle Warlocks, and two…

“The head of the family is called Maria Sigurd. He is in charge of most of the matters in the Akasha family. He is a peak Radiant Moon Warlock with powerful combat abilities. The Warlocks under him are…

” The last battle of the family was 300 years ago when they fought against the Mountain Giant Family, a rank three force. However, they killed the Mountain Giant Family with lightning speed. The entire battle lasted only ten days, and the Mountain Giant Family surrendered.

” Note: This force is in the top three among the rank three forces in the Western Region. It is recommended to maintain friendly relations. ”

That was the end of the message.

The Charm Mansion’s information about this family was quite comprehensive. It almost covered the relationship between the forces, the specific information about the warlocks, the strength of the family, the recent achievements, and so on. After reading it, Eli also had a very clear understanding of it.

However, such comprehensive information would probably cost a lot.

” Liliana, thank you for sending this information. I will pay you later. ” Eli smiled at Liliana.

” This information is a personal gift from me. After all, I don’t want the Bloodline Tower to be destroyed. ” Liliana shook her head, but her face was still full of worry.

“Compared to this, I feel that Milord should be more worried about the Radiant Sun Warlock of the Eight-Armed Naga Family. Compared to Radiant Moon, Radiant Sun is on another level.

“This Warlock is called Ma Mu, a Dark Sun Warlock. He advanced to the Radiant Sun three hundred years ago and is one of the elders of the Eight-Armed Naga. He is very powerful!”

Liliana had never been so worried before. After years of development, the Bloodline Tower had become the most promising force associated with the Charm Mansion. She also didn’t want to see Eli die in this war.

“Of course, I know!” Liliana lowered her head and suddenly felt a figure appear beside her and hug her!

She leaned over naturally and felt the warmth of the body beside her.

” Sir, if you really can’t do it, then leave this place. With your strength and our help, it won’t be difficult to rebuild a Bloodline Tower. ” Liliana raised her head and looked at Eli worriedly.

Eli lowered his head and looked into each other’s eyes.

“I can’t run! Don’t underestimate the Bloodline Tower and me! ” Eli smiled and pinched Liliana’s cheek. It was soft.

“My lord!” Liliana blushed.

“But the enemy is really too strong!”

This time, Eli didn’t reply. Instead, he changed the topic.” I heard that the Akasha family seems to be growing a flower called Mandala. It’s a rare magical plant. I’m very interested. ”

Liliana looked up at Eli, feeling that they were not on the same page.

She was worried about Eli, but Eli was already eyeing the resources of the Akasha Family.

“Is this plant very important to you?” Liliana asked.

“Yes.” Eli nodded.

In fact, Eli had already reached the peak of the Dark Sun for two years, but he was still unable to break through to Sun Crown. He still needed a catalyst.

There was a potion called the Mandala Potion in Eli’s potion formula that could help him.

The core magical plant was the Mandala Flower.

However, this kind of magic plant was very rare. Even if Eli sought out the Golden Cicada Merchant Association, they said that it would take a year to source. However, the Akasha family came at the perfect time.

“Don’t worry. The Akasha family can’t do anything to me!” Eli consoled.

” It’s good that you have confidence. If you need me, you can tell me anytime. ” Liliana nodded, and the worry on her face faded a little. She believed that Eli would not lie to her.

“Of course, I still have to thank you for giving me such complete information!” Eli smiled at Liliana.

“Yes!”

In the next second, a hand went through her waist and carried her up, walking towards the room at the side.

“Sir, it’s still daytime!” Liliana exclaimed but did not resist.

“The lighting is even better.”

Three hours later.

...

Liliana left the room and Eli got dressed.

There was a knock on the door. It was Vivika.

” Brother Eli, Lord Glen wants you to go to a meeting! “CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m
