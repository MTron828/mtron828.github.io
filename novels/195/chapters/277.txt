278 The Awakened Soul Slaves

“No, no, no!”

Eli shook his head.

“The battlefield is good, but it’s not like there’s no room for improvement right now. I’ll let him go to the battlefield when we really don’t have enough resources. Besides, he’ll be in the middle to late stage of third circle in a few years. It’ll be more stable then!”

“It seems that you still need some time before you can earn your own living!”

!!

Eli tapped Hydra’s head lightly.

Hydra let out a creaking sound and leaned on Eli’s shoulder!

..

At the same time.

Far away, in the northern part of the Holy tower, outside a mountain.

At this time, there were a large number of Holy tower warlocks stationed here, all of them surrounding the mountain. This mountain was also very strange. One side was smooth as if it had been cut off, and there was only one hole leading down.

At this moment, there were three people standing at the entrance of the cave.

Woox, Situ, and Sancher.

“Situ, it’s been eight years, have you still not removed the seal here?” Sancher looked at Situ and asked.

“it’s almost time. This seal is more time-consuming than I thought!” At this moment, Situ was also a little embarrassed.

This was the place where the soul slaves from the Mages’s era were sealed. It was also a place he had once discovered by chance. There were a large number of soul slaves sealed in ice!

He had already said that he was going to use this to change the situation.

In the end, after eight to nine years, he still hadn’t removed the seal.

“We can’t do much on the battlefield now, and the bloodline tower’s power is expanding rapidly. They were once slightly weaker than us, but now they’re almost on par with us!” Woox sighed.

He even regretted boarding this pirate ship, but it was too late!

“don’t worry, this seal will definitely be lifted in two years at most!” Situ said.

“Then let’s wait for another two years.”

Sancher and Woox looked at each other helplessly. They could do nothing but wait!

..

Two years later.

The three of them reappeared.

The three of them passed through the hole and headed inside.

The entrance was narrow at first, but as they went deeper, the space inside the mountain became larger and larger. The group held alchemy lamps and soon arrived at the place where the soul slaves were stored.

“Is this the place?”

Sancher looked at the darkness in front of him.

In the darkness, there seemed to be a chill, as if there were countless eyes staring at him. Standing there, he felt an inexplicable chill.

“It’s been almost ten years!” Woox sighed.

“We’re finally in!” Woox took a deep breath.

He walked forward slowly. The alchemy lamp could only light up a few meters. Not far away, a high wall appeared.

No… It was not a high wall.

In an instant, the alchemy lamp in his hand bloomed with light.

It lit up the area in front of him.

The scene in front of them was completely revealed to the three.

“Oh, my God!” The three of them exclaimed at the same time.

In front of him was a wall of ice, filling the entire space. Inside the wall were a huge number of soul slaves that were piled up like shadows. These were magical beasts enslaved by mages in the past.

Countless beasts, countless species, countless numbers!

The entire ice sculpture was filled with Frozen Soul slaves. There were probably tens of thousands of them, and their quality belonged to those of the first and second circles. However, this was no longer important. Such a large number was enough to change everything. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Situ’s mood instantly brightened, and he revealed a smile.

The other two also looked at each other, speechless.

“But how do we control these soul slaves?” Suddenly, Sancher asked.

“You don’t have to worry about that. The frozen Soul slaves in the mage era were usually used as a reserve for war. They didn’t have any branding. As long as we brand the core creatures among them, everything will be fine!”

“I see!” The two of them nodded.

“Hehe, in the mountain range, spell formations are completely useless, but these magical beasts are like fish in water. I’ll see how they deal with this!” Situ laughed coldly.

The three of them also showed a smile.

..

New calendar year 3775!

The Holy tower released the soul slaves.

Tens of thousands of soul slaves swarmed into the mountains. With such a huge number and the hostile environment for warlocks, the situation quickly turned.

In just two years, the bloodline tower was defeated on the mountain battlefield.

They temporarily withdrew from the mountain range.

...

The momentum of the Holy tower’s side soared, and they even began to prepare for a counterattack.

However, in the plains, the bloodline tower relied on a large number of spell formations to not fall behind the soul slave Army. The Holy tower’s plan failed, and they retreated back into the mountains, preparing for a second counterattack.

After this battle, the bloodline tower’s originally exuberant momentum was also extinguished.

The two forces were once again in a situation where no one could do anything to the other.

However, there was one thing that made the bloodline tower feel uneasy. The soul slaves of the Holy tower seemed to have been frozen for a long time, and their strength had been reduced by a lot.

However, as time passed, the soul slaves’ powers were slowly recovering.

..

“He’s at the limit of the third circle!”

In the secret realm, Eli looked at the Hydra in front of him and sighed.

On the lawn not far away, Hydra was coiled up. Its huge body was at least 40 to 50 meters long, and its three snake heads were hissing. One of its eyes was black, one was red, and one was blue.

“With such a large number of soul slaves, Hydra’s strength has increased very quickly!” Eli sighed.

...

He didn’t expect that Situ and the others would have stock from the Mages’ era. These large number of soul slaves were secretly transported away by the bloodline tower after their death and then brought here.

However, there was one interesting thing. Although most of these magical creatures were only at the first or second circle, they used to be at the second or third circle. Their power essence was very strong, and they were good ‘nutrients’!

Thus, Hydra experienced the fastest growth in its life!

In just two years, he had grown from the initial stage of the third circle to the limit of the third circle!

With the Hydra’s body possessing the power of three elements and the power of devouring, its strength was almost at the peak of the late stage. However, that was all it could do. The potential of the materials from back then had already been exhausted. After this, it would all depend on whether it had any special encounters!

“However, if we let those soul slaves continue to grow, it will be troublesome!”

As a mage, he naturally knew what a frozen soul slave was like. These frozen beasts would only get stronger.

If this continued, the bloodline tower would not be able to hold on!

He had to do something.

“But I can’t go out yet!” ‘Eli felt his own spiritual power.

At this time, he had about 345 points. However, he could now mobilize about 120 times the elements, which was much stronger than before.

Eli took out his investment and calculated the possibility of him defeating that half-step celestial.

13!

It had increased by another point, but it was still not stable!

Therefore, he could not show his face yet. This time, he could only let Hydra take action.

At this thought, Eli looked at Hydra and extended his hand.

Sensing Eli’s gaze, Hydra’s body slowly shrank and then moved closer to Eli, allowing him to touch his head.

“Go to the mountains in the North and kill the cores controlling the soul slaves!” Eli ordered as he left a bit of mental energy in the Hydra’s consciousness.

Hiss hiss hiss!

Hydra raised its head and blinked its bright eyes!

The next second, the two of them left the secret plane and came to Eli’s Mage Tower.

The Hydra’s body turned into a large shadow, and then it turned into a shadow and flew toward the horizon. Its speed far exceeded that of an ordinary third-circle warlock!

“Let the Holy tower test your combat power.”

Eli watched as Hydra disappeared from his sight before returning to the secret realm.

In the secret realm, Hill was still waving his branches.

“You … When are you going to advance to the second circle?”

Eli looked at Hill and sighed.

He had overestimated this tree’s rate of advancement compared to Hydra’s. Hill’s rate of advancement was like a turtle’s speed, but Eli didn’t mind. After all, how could you count on a tree?

He had all the time in the world anyway.

Hydra should be able to buy him more time.
