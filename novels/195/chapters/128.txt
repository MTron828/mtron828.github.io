129 Improved Magic Potion Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Improving potions was already a walk in the park for Eli.

Normally, the first step would be to analyze the materials, but this time, Eli had no intention of doing so.

The first step for Eli was to directly extract the extraordinary essence from all the extraordinary ingredients of the potion, using the life extraction technique that Nick had left behind. Then, he began to directly mix the extraordinary essence according to the potion formula.

Very quickly, a magic potion appeared.

The test showed that the potion’s effectiveness was at least 1.7 times that of the normal one.

However, it was impossible for Eli to hand this over because ordinary pharmacists didn’t have this knowledge, and it was impossible for them to make potions of this level. As for handing over the life extraction knowledge, it was even more ridiculous. Eli only wanted to reverse-engineer a new potion formula from this.

Every material had its own bad properties, and not all need to be refined with life extraction.

What Eli had to do was make a new potion with its impurities removed. That way, even if he really handed everything over to Evena, it wouldn’t have too much of an impact.

After all, there was a huge difference between directly adding and cutting the ingredients and slightly changing the proportion. The former would instantly attract a lot of attention, while the latter was only slightly better than normal.

And thus, it began.

…

Two months passed in the blink of an eye.

To Eli, the experiment was going smoothly.

Soon, he got rid of some of the impurities, and the effects of the potion improved slightly. However, this was far from enough, and Eli continued to work hard.

On the other side.

Due to the influence of the sun Corolla potion, few people bought the silent Crescent potion now. After all, there was a better substitute.

The income of the potion Department shifted to other potions, but it was not doing any better. This made the magic potion Department not look very good recently, and the atmosphere was very depressing.

Evena saw this, but she couldn’t do anything.

There were very few warlocks who were good at potioneering. Warlocks normally focused on bloodlines. Therefore, she could only seek help from the camp leaders.

However, when she went to ask for help, she found out that even the camp leaders couldn’t help her because the contract had been signed.

Naturally, nobody cared about the invisible Eli. Everyone was thinking of their own way out.

…

In the blink of an eye, another two months had passed.

In the laboratory of the arcane realm.

Eli looked at the potion that he had just made and took a deep breath.

The potion modification work was finally over.

There was a new potion on the table. It was different from the light blue color of the silent Crescent. This potion was dark blue and looked very similar.

In fact, the two potions were originally the same type, but the current potions were much more simplified than before.

This potion simplified some of the materials, such as the silent Crescent. Originally, the potion would use all parts of the plant, but Eli’s new formula would only use the tender parts.

After a general examination by Eli, the effect of this potion was 1.4 times that of the previous one, and the duration had also increased from three hours to twelve hours. The only regret was that the cost had not been reduced by much.

However, Eli already felt that it was fine. After all, it was impossible for everything to be perfect.

His skill level was not at that level yet.

Holding the potion, Eli walked out of the arcane realm and prepared to head to the potion Department.

“Herman, I heard that there’s a problem with the potion Department,” Victor asked curiously at the door.

“It’s a small problem,” Eli replied with a smile.

…

Soon, Eli arrived at the potions Department.

However, before he entered, he saw three familiar pharmacists walking out with their things.

“Where are you guys going?” Eli asked, puzzled.

These people were all veterans of the potions Department. Why were they also preparing to leave today?

“Oh, Herman, I’m sorry. We don’t want to leave, but the department’s effectiveness is getting worse and worse. We can’t do anything about it.” One of the pharmacists said helplessly as he spread his hands.

“Indeed, I can’t afford to live anymore. I can only go to the sun Corolla. They also need pharmacists there.”

“Why don’t you come with us?” The three of them advised.

“Then you guys can go.” Eli shook his head. If three more left, the Department would probably only have half of its staff remaining. Who would have thought that the Department that was still popular a year ago would be reduced to this state in the blink of an eye?

“Okay, good luck then.” The three of them left after just a few polite words.

Looking at the backs of the three of them, Eli shook his head.

He glanced at the empty building and walked toward Evelina’s office.

…

In the room, Evena sighed.

This was the most difficult period for her since she took over the Department.

The sun Corolla potion had reduced the department’s income by at least half. Excluding the department’s operations and salaries, there was really almost no money.

“Lord Phil probably didn’t expect this either.” Evena shook her head.

If this went on, sun Corolla would take over the potion department. The ugly head of capitalism reared its head.

However, it was still a long way to go before Evena could modify a magic potion. In fact, there was not even a single first-circle pharmacist in the camp at the moment. This was the shortcomings of warlocks.

Many warlocks would subconsciously choose a stronger bloodline when they chose to advance. These bloodlines all had their own attributes. Although they would strengthen some attributes, they would also weaken some.

This made it difficult for most apprentice warlocks to focus on studying potions after they advanced, and this was without considering the effect of unstable mental strength brought by the bloodline itself.

In the past, magic potions were refined by mages, and warlocks basically wouldn’t come into contact with them.

Now, this had become one of the factors that limited the development of warlocks.

Thinking of this, Evena sighed deeply again.

Bang Bang Bang!

Suddenly, there was a knock on the door.

Evena looked up in confusion. Who would come to him at this time?

“Please enter!”

…

“Minister, I’m Herman.” Eli walked in.

“Herman, what’s the matter? Do you want to leave too?” Asked Evena.

In fact, most of the people who knocked on the door these days came with this purpose.

“No.” Eli shook his head.

“Oh, then what’s the matter?” Evena was even more confused.

“I’ve made the improved potion,” Eli replied.

“Oh, an improved magic potion… Okay. I’ll approve your leave. Wait, what?!” Evena jumped up at once, her rabbit ears standing up and her slightly red eyes wide open.

She stared at Eli. This new member can improve the potion?

“Are you sure?”

“Yes.”

“Are you sure?”

“Yes, I am.”

After confirming it twice, Evena sat back in her chair and slowly lowered her ears. She had to see it for herself.

“Did you bring the potion?” Asked Evena.

“Minister, this is the potion.” Eli took out the medicine he had prepared in advance.

Looking at the dark blue potion, Evena blinked and took it. It looked normal!

“Forget it. I’ll just test it.” Evena thought for a moment and rang a bell.

Soon, there was a knock on the door.

“Come in!”

An old acquaintance walked in, Rooney.

Rooney had been working when he suddenly received Evena’s call and rushed over in a hurry.

“Herman.” As soon as he entered, he saw Eli at the side and was a little puzzled. “What’s going on?”

“Rooney, go and test this potion.” Faced with Rooney’s confusion, Evena did not give him much time to think and handed the potion to him.

“Alright,” he said. Rooney took the potion. Although he was confused, he looked at Herman and then walked out.

The next step was to wait. Evena and Eli were silent.

Evena was anxious. If it were successful, it would be a great thing for the potion Department. If it were not, then they would have been happy for nothing.

“Let’s see the results.”

…

Time slowly passed.

Half an hour later.

There was a knock on the door.

“Come in!” Evena stood up.

Rooney walked in, but he was in a different state than before. He looked like he had seen a ghost, and his hand holding the potion was trembling.

Before Evena could speak, Rooney’s voice trembled. “Minister, the ingredients of this potion are almost the same as the silent Crescent potion. Is this an improved potion? ”

“Yes.” Ivana glanced at Eli and nodded.

Eli stood silently at the side, not saying anything.

“How’s the effect?” Evena asked directly.

“Minister, you must have found a master to improve it. The effect of the potion is amazing. It’s 1.42% of the original effect. What’s more outrageous is that the effective time has been extended by three times.” Rooney panted heavily, unable to keep calm.

Upon hearing this result, Evena was also dumbfounded, and her rabbit ears stood up again.

It was true!

The potion was real!

Ivana looked at Eli. She could not believe that the member she had recruited a few months ago could actually save the potion Department.

No, she had to ask about the cost. If the cost were too high, it would be useless.

“Herman, what’s the cost of this potion? ” Evena looked at Eli with a serious look.

“It’s about 95% of what it was before, and the steps are similar to the previous ones, but the processing of the materials may be more troublesome,” Eli replied.

She closed her eyes and took a deep breath.

If that was the case, then this potion was the Savior of the pharmacy department.

When she opened her eyes again, she looked at Eli and said seriously, “if everything is true, then you will be the Vice-Minister of the potions Department in the future.”

Rooney, “…”

Rooney was dumbfounded, but when he heard the words ” Deputy Minister, ” his body stiffened. He looked at Eli, and his mouth gradually opened wide.

It can’t be.

Herman… You…
