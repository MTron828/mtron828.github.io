296 Hall’s Discovery

The happy game of cards began.

The cards that Eli was playing with them were not the cards from his previous life, but the cards unique to this world, the mage cards, a game left behind from the mage era.

Soon, the two warlocks started to lose a lot of money, and their faces became more and more serious.

However, Eli’s purpose wasn’t to win money but to waste time, so he began to lose magic stones on purpose. The two of them looked better, and the atmosphere became better.

Compared to winning or losing all the time, this was also extremely addictive.

Eli looked at the two of them and smiled.

As he fought, he observed the situation in the secret plane.

..

On the other side, flames surrounded Luo ye as he quickly passed through the gate of the secret plane.

The dizziness in the space made him a little uncomfortable, and Luo ye shook his head.

A few seconds later, he looked ahead.

He was currently in mid-air above the secret plane. He turned around and could see the secret plane’s Gate, which was emitting spatial fluctuations, about a hundred meters above the ground.

Fortunately, he was at the third circle. If he was an apprentice, he might have fallen to his death.

“This mystical realm is interesting!” Luo ye raised his head and observed.

The area was estimated to be close to ten square kilometers, and they were at the edge of the secret realm.

“Is it there?”

He looked at the center of the secret realm and narrowed his eyes.

“Luo ye, everyone’s here!” At the same time, the warlocks behind him had already gathered. Hall said to Luo ye.

“Let’s go!” Luo ye nodded. Flames surrounded his body and he was about to fly forward. However, he suddenly felt an inexplicable pressure from the surrounding space, making him fall quickly.

In just a few seconds, he quickly descended from the sky.

The other warlocks were the same. It was as if the secret realm didn’t react earlier, but now it did.

Luo ye was also a little angry and unhappy.

He raised his head.

In the sky, blue runes appeared one after another. When they combined together, they looked like a strict machine. However, they disappeared in a flash.

“A large-scale spell formation that forbids flying?” Hall, who was behind him, exclaimed in surprise.

Such a large-scale spell formation already showed that this secret plane was not simple, and the danger was probably not low.

“Luo ye, it seems that this mystery realm is not simple. We have to be careful!” Hall reminded Luo ye.

Luo ye smiled and said with confidence, ” isn’t that good? it means that we are at the right place.

“Everyone, let’s go!” He said to the others and then strode forward.

His steps were firm, without a trace of hesitation.

Hall’s mouth twitched when he saw him like this.

He was still too inexperienced.

But this was the person he was protecting!

He sighed and then followed. The others quickly followed.

However, what no one noticed was that bits of colorless mental energy began to slowly separate from many people’s bodies. Then, they began to gather in the air, and a silver-white illusionary structure of an eyeball appeared.

It flew into the sky.

At this moment, the blue runes appeared again as if they wanted to stop it from rising.

However, in the blink of an eye, countless silver mental force burst out in an instant, as if they were going to head towards the spell formation. Then, the spell formation began to flicker and then disappear as if it was afraid.

Meanwhile, the spirit eye retracted the silver thread and flew into the sky.

It flew to the top, a few kilometers above the ground, and then stopped to follow Luo ye and the others. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

..

The danger of the secret realm was beyond imagination.

Even Eli didn’t expect this Mystic realm to be so dangerous!

The first hour after entering the secret realm, the group of people first came to a forest.

As soon as they entered, a large number of chimeras rushed out of the forest. There were thousands of them, and many of them were strong. There were even nearly a hundred third circle chimeras!

The battle started at once.

In this battle, Eli witnessed the fighting power of this group of people.

Among them, Luo ye was indeed a genius. He was really strong. He almost fought hundreds of chimeras alone and suppressed them. His bloodline flame was wrapped around his body like a god.

The others weren’t bad either. Under the lead of Hall and the other half-step celestials, they quickly began to fight and continuously advanced.

In just half an hour, Luo ye and the others had passed through this place without any injuries!

..

Three hours after entering the secret realm, Luo ye and the others set off again after a short rest.

This time, they were welcomed by a Canyon.

In the canyon, there was a Dark Castle.

...

This was the only way to go.

On their way to the castle, countless undead swarmed toward them. The terrifying sounds of the undead shook the entire valley as if a ghost Kingdom had descended!

Eli observed from the sky.

This group of undead was much stronger than Nikola, and some of them were even comparable to half-step celestial stage undead. Every attack from them could even make the warlocks feel uneasy!

As it turned out, warlocks were still not good at dealing with these things.

Compared to the chimeras, the undead was a greater challenge.

The number of deaths was as high as four late-stage third circle warlocks.

However, Luo ye was still high-spirited and full of fighting spirit.

This kind of genius had always been like this. He was arrogant. Thus, he ignored the dissuasion of others and was the first to step into the castle.

As soon as he stepped into the castle, the silver eye in the sky quickly retreated. This was because the castle began to collapse as if it was decaying.

A black mist emanated from the castle, and an indescribable throbbing even made Eli’s eyes widen!

...

Only then did he realize that the castle wasn’t real at all. It was a terrifying curse that had been arranged in advance. Someone didn’t want anyone to enter this place!

This curse would be troublesome even if it were to hit Eli.

Outside, Eli even lost his concentration and lost a few cards.

Under this curse, a few warlocks who were close to it were also affected. In just a few breaths, the body tissues of these warlocks began to grow new flesh.

What was even more outrageous was that their mutated bodies started to attack themselves uncontrollably.

This was a physical curse.

There was no doubt that Luo ye and the others were unlucky.

Eli was also very curious about how they would deal with it. Then, he saw Luo ye’s trump card as to why he was so brave. He saw a bloody mark suddenly appear on his arm.

The blood started to burn quickly, and a layer of silent flames began to appear.

Like a spread carpet, it spread in all directions and quickly covered everyone. The flames were orange, warm, and comfortable, and the curse was gradually suppressed by this power.

“A power from the celestial!”

Although Eli had never seen a celestial before, he was sure that this was definitely the work of a celestial.

However, the flames did not eliminate the curse. They only became more powerful and suppressed it. After all, even a celestial warlock was not good at handling curses.

They had safely passed through this place.

“Everyone, let’s continue!”

This time, Luo ye’s expression finally changed.

He felt a little uneasy.

Every one passed through the canyon. What Luo ye did not notice was that behind him, Hall shook his head as if he had been affected a lot. An inexplicable light flashed in his eyes as he continued to follow Luo ye.

No one saw it, but Eli did.

“This is getting interesting!”

In the outside world, Eli pursed his lips.

This person had to be dealt with!

Moreover, their adventure had come to an end, and it was time for him to pick the fruit!

Thinking of this, he looked at the two warlocks.

Diogo was having fun, and the other one was in a similar mood.

“The two of you!”

Eli’s voice suddenly rang out, and the two of them turned their heads at the same time.

They only saw a touch of silver, and they felt as if the world was spinning. Then, their eyes gradually became dull, and their bodies became motionless as if they had stiffened.

On the other hand, Eli stood up very calmly, then wrapped the two of them in his shadow and placed them beside the tree.

He took all the chips on the table, looked at the secret realm, and walked in.

..

On the other side.

Luo ye and the others moved quickly and encountered all kinds of traps along the way. Luo ye took out his precious items several times to break through the traps, but several warlocks still died.

At this time, Luo ye’s face no longer had the initial confidence, but he was still calm.

This was because they had already arrived at the core of the secret plane.

In the distance, there was a steep rock wall in the center of the secret plane. In front of it was a Mage tower. The Mage tower seemed to be completely made of metal, reflecting silver light, and there was no entrance.

On the large piece of land in front of the tower, mechanical objects stood there, covered in dust and soil, many of which were wrapped in vines, as if they had been standing there for thousands of years.

Luo ye’s eyes lit up when he saw the mechanical objects.

“This is the place!” Seeing this scene, Luo ye felt his heart beat fast.

Until now, they had been dealing with dark magic but this was pure mechanical ruin. It was basically telling them the treasure was there.

Of course, they had to pass through this area first!

Luo ye turned to the remaining 20 or so warlocks and said, “Everyone, let’s rest first. After this, we’ll have a fierce battle with our friends!”

“Yes!”

The group of people nodded and began to rest.

“Milo, follow me!” Suddenly, one of the half-step celestial warlocks heard a sound. He turned his head and saw the person approaching. It was Hall who had the highest status besides Luo ye!

“What’s wrong?” Milo found it strange!

“There’s something we need to discuss!”

Looking at Milo, who was still clueless, Hall’s eyes were deep as he said in a low voice.

“Follow me first!” Hall pulled Milo away. This time, he didn’t ask. Luo ye also saw it, but he didn’t say anything. He didn’t think anything was wrong.

Soon, Milo was pulled to an open space in the distance.

“What’s wrong?” Milo frowned and asked.

“We’ve been tricked!”

Looking at Milo, Hall finally spat out the truth.

Tricked?
