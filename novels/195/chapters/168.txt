169 Beating Adams

“Damn it, damn it!”

Ross covered his wound and hid behind a big tree.

He lowered his head to take a look. At this moment, there was a huge gash on his chest, and the gash was filled with flesh and blood that flowed out.

Ross didn’t expect Adams to be so powerful.

He was at the peak of the middle stage of the one-circle, yet in the hands of Adams, who was at the peak of the one-circle, he had been completely defeated in a single move.

!!

When he was facing Adams, he felt like he was facing the councilmen of the second circle in the White Tower. They were not on the same level at all, and Adams was very relaxed.

“I’m done for. I’m really unlucky. Wherever I go, I’m unlucky.” Ross took a deep breath and got ready to get up and continue running.

But when he stood up, a figure walked out from under a big tree not far away. With a faint smile on his face, he looked at Ross and said softly, “I’ve found you!”

Ross’s eyes widened. The person in front of him was indeed Adams. His body was even trembling slightly. Only after fighting with Adams did he understand that the gap between the two of them was huge. They were not on the same level at all, and there was no hope of victory.

“Is this the end?” Ross gritted his teeth and took a deep breath. He stared at Adams, who had once again transformed.

Countless shadows emerged from the surroundings, turning into long shadow spears that flew toward Adams. The spears tore through the air, making a series of air-piercing sounds.

Seeing this, Adams only smiled. His eyes turned into cold vertical pupils. At the same time, the surroundings started to become scorching hot. A wall of fire instantly appeared, blocking in front of him.

When the shadow spears attacked, they melted like snow. In the flames, all the shadows disappeared one by one. Adams was unharmed.

The giant kemoyin serpent was a giant serpent-type creature that could control the fire element.

“Pitiful weaklings!” Adams walked out of the flames with a smile and looked at Ross with disdain.

He definitely couldn’t beat him, so he just had to see if there was any hope of escaping.

Ross took a deep breath, tensed his muscles, and ran toward the forest behind him. But to his surprise, his body seemed to be frozen and he couldn’t move.

“Giant kemoyin serpent’s second circle innate spell, petrification. How is it?” Adams explained to Ross as he walked over.

Ross’s eyes were wide open as he looked at Adams in disbelief.

A 2nd-circle innate spell … Didn’t this mean that Adams was actually a 2nd-circle Warlock? However, on second thought, if Adams were just a first-circle sorcerer, it was almost impossible to cause such damage to him.

F * ck, the Blood Alliance didn’t follow the rules.

Ross’s heart sank, and he slowly closed his eyes. In front of the second-circle opponent, any struggle was meaningless.

“Have you accepted your fate?” Adams smiled, and a fireball the size of a basketball flew toward Ross.

Bang!

The flames collided with the shadow, and a shadow wall suddenly appeared, stopping the flames.

“It seems like you still want to live!” Rawls was stunned, thinking that it was Ross’ technique. He approached Ross, and scales appeared on his body. Then, flames wrapped around his hands as he confidently attacked the shadow wall.

Bang!

His fist collided with the shadow wall, but it wasn’t like what Adams had expected. The flames on his hand were extinguished, while the shadow wall didn’t move at all.

Adams was stunned. How could this be?

Could it be a special mage tool?

The next second, an even bigger flame smashed toward the shadow. The cloud of fire exploded, but when the flames dissipated, the shadow wall was still intact. Instead, Adams had lost a lot of power.

Ross had already opened his eyes. He was a little confused by the scene in front of him. This wasn’t something he could do. What was going on? When he sensed a familiar aura coming from the wall, he was stunned.

“Milord, leave quickly! He’s in the second circle!”

Although he didn’t know where it was, he could tell from the aura that it was Eli.

Eli had actually come to save him. He was touched but also anxious.

The person in front of him was a two-circle warlock. Ross was burning with anxiety.

“My Lord?” On the other side, Adams was also stunned when he heard the voice. He turned to look around and saw a person slowly walking out of the forest under a big tree more than ten meters away.

Who was it?

Adams looked at the stranger.

“Ah, I was almost too late!” Eli nodded at Adams, and countless shadows instantly appeared behind him, transforming into a giant hand that grabbed at Adams. The shadow wall from before also transformed into a long spear, attacking Adams.

He didn’t waste time and directly attacked.

The sudden attack also stunned Adams. However, he still conjured a wall of fire subconsciously. It should be enough. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

However, he immediately realized that he was wrong. The shadow hand actually passed through the flames and grabbed him. The terrifying power made it difficult for him to breathe.

At the same time, the giant spear behind him also attacked. Adams gritted his teeth and moved to the side, allowing the giant spear to penetrate his right chest.

“How is this possible?” Adams could feel the restraint and the intense pain in his body. He gritted his teeth and looked at the nearby Eli. This level of power … He should be at the second circle already.

“Your White Tower doesn’t follow the rules.” Adams gritted his teeth and looked at Eli.

He wasn’t a fool. A first-circle warlock couldn’t do this to him. His opponent was definitely a two-circle warlock.

“Follow the rules?”

A strange expression appeared on Eli’s face. “You don’t have the right to say this, do you?”

“Hmph, but if you think you can kill me like this, then you’re underestimating me too much. Watch me break the seal.” Adams gritted his teeth and glared at Eli in anger. He was about to unseal the seal on his arm.

“Huh?”

Adams wanted to undo the seal, but he suddenly realized that there was no reaction from the seal. He turned around and saw that the seal had been cut off. It couldn’t be used at all, and he couldn’t release his power.

“There are many methods to hide one’s strength. This might work if you run into someone else. Unfortunately, you met me. Next time, remember to choose a better sealing technique.” Eli shook his head and slowly approached.

It wasn’t difficult for him to cut off the seal in a short time using the shadow. Of course, if Adams was familiar with sealing, he could undo Eli’s disruption, but it was obvious that he wasn’t.

“How is that possible?”

Adams was in disbelief. Was this something a Warlock could do? Which normal Warlock would learn sealing?

He was dumbfounded, but when he saw Eli approaching, he also realized his situation.

“Don’t kill me! My father is a Peak second-circle Warlock!” Adams couldn’t care less about his face. He quickly begged for mercy and even explained his background.

But the next second, a wind blade flew over.

A head flew up, and blood splattered everywhere!

“You fool!” After confirming that Adams was dead, Eli pouted.

At this moment, Ross’ mouth was wide open as he looked at this ridiculous scene.

What did he see?

Adams was killed by his master Herman in less than five seconds.

Ross looked at Eli in a daze as he silently took away Adams’s things and walked over slowly.

“Mas-Master.” Ross stammered.

“Yes, I’m here to save you. I’m leaving.” Eli threw a bottle of potion at Ross, then turned around and left as if he really was just taking a trip.

Ross just stood there in a daze, looking at the potion in his hand.

He was dumbfounded.

So his Lord was that powerful? Wasn’t it a bit too cowardly of him to ask Eli to run away earlier?

“Oh, right, keep this a secret!” A message came from the soul brand.

“I understand, my Lord.”

…

“A mage tool and some materials. Why are there so few?”

After Eli left, he checked the items he had collected from Adams’ body.

A two-circle Warlock had only collected a few materials and a one-circle magic Ring. That was too little.

If the dead Adams knew what Eli was thinking, he would be so angry that he would come back to life. He came here to kill people, so he wasn’t in a hurry to collect materials.

“But this ring of will is not bad. It can increase a portion of your concentration. It’s not bad.” Eli kept the one-circle ring.

After dealing with this matter, Eli looked in that direction and continued to head toward the center of the arcane realm.

The collection at the periphery was almost done. It was time to go to the central area.
