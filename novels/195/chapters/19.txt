Chapter 20: Ball

Translator: Lonelytree

“Eli, what are we doing next?!”

After they left, Eli and Herman were left alone. Herman asked.

“Of course, we’re going to eat and drink.” Eli gave Herman a strange look, then looked at the table not far away.

This was a very long table, and it was currently filled with all sorts of food.

In addition to the bright red wine, there were all kinds of delicious food on the table, like grilled sausages, roasted meat, fruit pies, butter prawns, pickled geese, white bread, desserts, and so on.

“Erm...” Herman didn’t know how to refute him.

Shouldn’t one be actively trying to get to know other nobles and make connections at an aristocratic banquet? Why would they come here to eat?

‘Eli’s thoughts are... unusual as usual.’

“if you want to get to know other people, then go ahead. There’s no need to pay attention to me. I’m just a little hungry.” Naturally, Eli understood Herman’s thoughts and waved his hand.

Although Herman was unlikely to inherit the title, he had been working hard. Coming to such a place, he naturally had to do something. Eli couldn’t be bothered, and he really couldn’t be interested in getting to know other people.

To him, that was a waste of time.

“Alright, then.” Herman looked apologetic and walked in another direction. He saw someone he knew.

Meanwhile, Eli immediately walked to the table at the side, picked up the plate, and began to get the food.

The food served at the banquet was of a much higher quality than what he usually ate. Since he was there, he had to eat more. It was free anyway, so it would be a waste not to eat.

Soon, he had a plate full of food and showed a satisfied expression.

A dozen meters away, Klein happened to pass by and saw this scene. His mouth twitched and he cursed, “What a country bumpkin. He’s too inelegant.”

Naturally, Eli didn’t care about the others ‘gazes.

Eli walked to the corner of the banquet hall, found a table, sat down, and began to gobble down his food.

There were still some people here, but when they saw Eli, they subconsciously moved away.

It was too inelegant!

For a moment, the entire banquet seemed to have formed a boundary line. On one side were the nobles, who were elegantly chatting, and on the other side was Eli, who was gobbling down large chunks of food.

As Rias directed the others, she saw Eli in the corner and didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.

‘This guy really didn’t care about what other people thought at all!’

Half an hour later, with a burp from Eli, he was full.

He wiped his mouth, stood up, and looked around. At this moment, Herman had already blended into the small group and was chatting with them. They seemed to be in harmony.

After half an hour, the banquet finally began.

Rias stood on the platform in the middle and began to speak. First, she was happy that everyone was there, so she spoke a lot and finally announced the start of the ball.

As for hunting, that was the last activity.

The dance naturally required a venue. Eli saw many maidservants and male servants entering the banquet and moving the tables that were filled with food away. Most of the food was left untouched.

Without a doubt, most of the food would probably be wasted.

There were still many civilians starving to death outside, but it did not seem to have anything to do with them. The value of the food consumed by the banquet alone was probably enough for hundreds of civilians to survive through the winter.

As the tables were moved away, a band entered the banquet hall and began to play music.

Beautiful and melodious music entered Eli’s ears, which made him feel much better. Compared to the always noisy music on Liuying Street, this music was clearly much better.

As the music notes danced, the men also invited the girls to the dance floor.

Eli stood outside the dance floor, quietly watching these people dance. Suddenly, he felt some people on his right walking towards him.

“Eli, let me introduce you. This is a new friend I’ve just made.” Herman walked over with a nobleman beside him. He had golden hair and blue eyes. From the coat of arms, he seemed to be from a Baron family.

“Herman, who is this?” The noble that Herman brought over was also curious about who Herman was going to introduce to him.

“This is my best friend, a student of the library’s scholar Clement.” Herman introduced them to him and then raised his eyebrows at Eli.

He knew that Eli didn’t like socializing, but Herman felt that it was necessary for him to get to know people of a higher level. As Eli’s good friend, he felt that it was necessary to help Eli on such an occasion.

“This is David.” Herman then introduced the man.

Hello, I’m David. May I know which family you belong to? ” The golden-haired David smiled.

“Hello, I don’t belong to any noble family.” Eli didn’t expect Herman to do this, but he still answered politely.

Although he was very polite, David accurately caught the keyword. ‘Not a noble?’

His smile instantly disappeared, and the way he looked at Eli gradually changed from an equal to a condescending one.

“I’m sorry, I still have something to do,” David said straightforwardly and left, not even paying attention to Herman.

He had paid a great price to get to the banquet, so he couldn’t waste his time on commoners. As for Herman, he probably wasn’t that noble since he was friends with a commoner.

Herman was stunned as he watched David leave. He didn’t expect this to happen.

“I’m sorry, Eli.” But after a few seconds, he understood and said to Eli.

“It’s fine.” Eli shook his head.

Who would care about an unimportant person like that?

“Aren’t you going to chase after him?” Eli asked, looking at Herman with interest. He had just seen Herman chatting with that noble for a long time.

“Uh, don’t make fun of me.” Herman was a little embarrassed. ” but I’m here because of you. I’m on your side!” he chuckled.

“Alright then!” Eli nodded, and her impression of Herman increased by quite a bit.

At this moment, another person suddenly walked over.

Rias, in her purple dress, walked over with a smile and invited, “Eli, do you want to dance?”

Right now, the dance on the dance floor was a standard noble dance, a dance derived from classical dance. It was difficult, but it looked very beautiful.

He shouldn’t have rejected a lady’s invitation, but he didn’t know how to dance like that.

“I don’t know how to do this dance.” Eli declined tactfully.

“It’s okay, I can guide you,” Said Rias with a bright smile.

She was here to take revenge. She had been lectured many times by Eli when she asked him questions at the library.

For example, “it’s so simple.” “Have you really learned this before?” “I think you need to revise.”

To her, that was a nightmarish existence. Now that she had finally managed to invite him to the banquet, she naturally wanted him to know that she, a noble lady, was also very strong in other aspects. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“You told me that life is about the experience.” As if worried that Eli would reject her, Riaz said slyly.

With his memory as a wizard, Eli could guarantee that this was not something he had said before.

“Alright,” he said. However, he did not refuse this time. He only said, “But can I take a look and learn a little first?”

“Of course, you can.” Rias appeared to be elegant, but she was laughing in her heart. She could only maintain a dignified expression in a banquet.

‘You’re finally in my hands.’

Eli looked towards the dance floor, and all sorts of movements rushed into his mind like fragments, allowing him to quickly grasp the dance’s movements.

Rias, who was watching from the side, saw that Eli was staring at the dance floor as if he was really learning. She revealed a sly smile. ‘Keep pretending.’

Three minutes later, Eli stopped.

“Did you learn it?” Rias pretended to ask.

I know you’re good at learning, but I don’t believe you can dance well.

Dancing was a test of physical ability.

“I’ve learned it.” Eli nodded calmly and extended his hand at the same time, inviting, “I wonder if this beautiful lady is willing to dance with me.”

Rias was taken aback. Looking at the black-suited man in front of her, who always had a confident expression, she suddenly felt as if they were back in the library and she was going to be overwhelmed by Eli’s knowledge again.

‘It can’t be. Impossible!’ Rias shook her head. She didn’t believe that Eli could dance.

“Alright!” Rias held onto Eli’s hand, and the two of them walked towards the dance floor.

Herman, “...”

How did you guys ignore me so naturally?
