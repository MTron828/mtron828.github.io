196 I Surrender

“Skeletons?”

The group looked at the skeletons around them. Other than being a little dumbfounded by the number and quality of the skeletons, the way they looked at Eli was completely different as well. This was not something a Warlock should be able to do.

One of the top leaders of the White Tower was actually a Mage. This was really big news!

Mages were hated by everyone on the West Coast.

!!

The white-eyed man looked at Eli solemnly, then took out a crystal ball, trying to send out a message, but he realized that the message couldn’t be sent out at all.

“There’s a concealment spell formation here so that no messages can get out. Also, I can see that the defense formation is very strong. I’m afraid we won’t be able to get out if we don’t get rid of Herman.” He kept the crystal ball and looked at the shadow wall outside the canyon.

“Then let’s fight.” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

After receiving the message, the team leader looked at the skeletons around him. He wanted to see how long Herman could last with so many skeletons.

The others also looked at each other, and all of them instantly activated their bloodlines.

Pale blood bats, giant rock elephants, wailing Banshees, flaming Lions …

The white-eyed man’s bloodline was activated, and a pair of blood-red Wings grew on his back. His body also became blood-red. The team captain’s body was surrounded by a large piece of rock. The voluptuous female Warlock became bewitching, and a tail grew from her back …

The battle started at once.

The team leader was the first to attack. He stomped his right leg on the ground, and a large number of rock pillars instantly appeared, burying dozens of skeletons in an instant.

Roar!

After doing that, he let out a furious roar and charged Eli. He knew very well that as long as he took care of Eli, the rest was all small problems.

The others also covered their leader and approached Eli.

Naturally, it was impossible for Eli to let them have their way. The skeletons swarmed forward and attacked the warlocks.

Some of them attacked them with shadow weapons, while some of the skeletons further away held bone staffs and fireballs. There were even spirits harassing them from the sky and underground.

Compared to the past, the types of undead skeletons he had now were much more varied and much stronger.

The skeletons swarmed forward, and the eight-man team instantly felt the pressure.

“Damn it, how can these skeletons be so strong!!” The voluptuous woman tried to charm the undead but found that she couldn’t. She could only use her tail to smash an undead approaching her and curse.

“Herman has hidden his strength too well. I doubt even Nikola can defeat him.”

“What an outrageous number!”

At this time, the group also realized the severity of this mission.

Eli was far more difficult to deal with than they had expected. At first, they had thought that two or three people would be enough to surround him, but now, it was clearly Herman was able to take on eight of them alone, which shocked them.

Half an hour later.

Bang!

After repelling another wave of undead, the group huddled together and looked at each other.

“This won’t do. We can’t even get to Herman. Change our strategy, Dearle … The four of you, help me clear the skeletons in front of me. The rest of you, attack Herman from a distance. I’ll rush to Herman. I’ve fought with necromancers before, and they’re not strong in close combat.” The leader looked at the sea of the undead around him and knew that they could not go on like this.

“Yes!”

Everyone nodded and began to move.

Three of them approached the leader, surrounded him, and then approached Eli.

The other four looked at each other, then launched an attack on the distant Eli.

In that instant.

The inferno Lion Warlock took a deep breath, and a concentrated ball of flame was produced. It then streaked through the air and flew towards Eli. Along the way, the skeletons melted. This was his most powerful attack.

But to his surprise, Eli didn’t dodge.

Instead, he waved the staff in his right hand, and a shadow-like shield suddenly appeared in front of him. Then, the fireball hit it directly and was swallowed.

“What?”

The Warlock’s eyes widened. He watched as the fireballs went straight into the shadow wall. It didn’t even cause any changes. The only change was some ripples.

“Not bad!”

On the other hand, Eli felt the extra Magic power in his body and pursed his lips.

Since this was a battle, it was also an opportunity for him to test his strength.

The shield in front of him was not just a simple shadow shield but a new spell created by Eli’s innovative devouring system, a second circle special spell, devouring wall.

Its function was to swallow the enemy’s attack directly. Of course, if that was all, there was nothing special about this spell. The special thing was that the spell that was swallowed would turn into elements or magic power to supplement Eli. It could be changed into a shield to cover Eli’s body. It was a spell that combined endurance and defense.

Although their attacks had been devoured, the warlocks began a new round of attacks.

The group of four attacked Eli frantically. All sorts of powerful elemental attacks surged toward him, but what made them dumbfounded was that Eli didn’t dodge at all. He simply allowed the attacks to hit.

As they attacked, the other team was even more dumbfounded.

“F*ck, it’s been almost an hour. Why hasn’t the number of skeletons decreased at all? Instead, they’ve become more ferocious.”

“Indeed, how could he have so much magic power?!”

The team leader looked at them, who were getting further and further away from Eli, and felt very confused.

This didn’t make sense at all. Even a Necromancer wouldn’t be able to sustain such a large number of skeletons for so long.

On the other side, the four-man team attacked with all their might, and it was extremely intense.

Eli had to block the attacks while controlling the sea of skeletons.

Was this something a normal person could do?

...

This was completely wrong!

What about the conservation of energy?

He was a wizard at the peak of the second circle, so he was no fool. Looking at the relaxed Eli and the elemental shield in front of him, he seemed to have realized that something was wrong.

He immediately turned around and shouted to the four of them, “Don’t attack his shield. It can absorb your attack to replenish his strength!”

A powerful voice sounded. The eyes of the four flickered, and as if realizing that something was amiss, they immediately stopped.

“Let’s not care about anything else. Everyone, head straight for Herman, or we’ll all die. This guy is even more difficult to deal with than Nikola.” The leader continued to shout.

Everyone nodded in agreement. At this point, they finally understood how terrifying their opponent was.

Even if Eli were a necromancer, the number of corpses he had collected was not right. How long had it taken him to collect these corpses? Where did he get them from?

All the prisoners that the White Tower had taken care of during its expansion over the years were all dealt with by Eli, and they were all of high quality. There was also the house of the undead. There was also the iris mage camp. The three major forces were collecting corpses for Eli, how could the number not be a lot?

To put it bluntly, even if they fought like this for an entire day, Eli didn’t feel any pressure at all.

As for the magic power consumption …

...

Eli thought for a moment, took out two bottles of potions, and gulped them down. His mental power quickly recovered.

A bottle of mana potion replenished mana, and a bottle of blood bamboo flower potion replenished mental power.

“Damn!”

On the other side, the eight-man team watched as Eli drank the potions. They instantly sensed that his aura had been filled up again. Everyone looked at each other and realized the severity of the problem.

And what made them despair was that Eli was very fast. Even though they kept getting closer to him, he was also retreating. The distance between them was getting further and further, and he didn’t even want to fight them in close combat.

“Curses!”

Everyone took a deep breath as they felt the power of their bloodlines gradually being consumed.

Today, if it were not Eli who died, it would be them.

An hour later, the leader looked at the two remaining warlocks beside him, and his mouth twitched.

What the f * ck!

Fifty minutes ago, Eli had started a long-range spell attack. In just fifty minutes, they had seen almost a few hundred spells that involved all kinds of elements. Coupled with the skeletons, they had instantly suffered heavy casualties.

And it gave him the feeling that it was as if Eli was playing.

It was as if Eli was treating them as puppets to experiment with spells. Otherwise, why would he use so many spells on them? What made him dumbfounded was how long did Eli take to learn that many spells?

He looked at the heavily injured people behind him.

They didn’t seem to be able to hold on much longer.

Another hour passed.

The leader looked at the empty surroundings and closed his eyes silently.

A few seconds later, he raised his hand.

“I surrender!”
