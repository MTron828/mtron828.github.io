308 Wanderer Alliance

Masude was a half-step celestial Warlock. He had offended a powerful force in the central continent and had to escape. He then came to the relatively remote West Coast.

In order to obtain resources, he joined the Wanderer organization here, the Wanderer Alliance. It had been a few decades since then.

However, in recent years, the internal conflicts within the Alliance had grown bigger and bigger. The reason was simple. It was because of insufficient resources and the uneven distribution of resources!

Compared to the bloodline tower, which occupied most of the resources, the Wanderer Alliance only occupied a few dozen resource points, which was far from enough to meet their needs. Moreover, there was a steady stream of people coming to the West Coast every year to join them.

And so, last year, their leader decided to take action against the bloodline tower.

In fact, they had enough power, but they didn’t have enough people. However, with the increase in numbers over the years, they had reached that level. Therefore, he was sent out to investigate and prepare for a future attack!

After making preparations, he sneaked into the Sofia mountains, ready to investigate the core area of the bloodline tower, but he encountered a special situation on the way.

He saw countless magical beasts gathering in the soya mountain range. At this time, he was surprised to find that there were so many magical beasts in the mountain range.

So he immediately followed, and before he reached the center, he saw all the magical beasts suddenly die, and then their soul fragments gathered in the sky, like a dream.

He was dumbfounded when he saw the soul crystal.

Its quality was close to the fourth circle, so it was definitely an extremely precious item.

But when he got close, he found that an ordinary-looking man was already close, so he made up his mind and was ready to kill and rob.

“Hand over the spirit crystal!” Masude flew to a spot not too far away from Eli, his eyes flashing with an ominous glint. At the same time, the aura of a half-step celestial was completely released.

“You’re going to rob me, right?” Eli asked despite knowing the answer.

“Nonsense, kid, this isn’t something you can have!” Scales gradually appeared on Masude’s skin. His right hand turned into a sharp claw, and his eyes turned into vertical pupils, looking at him coldly.

“Then come and get it!” Eli looked at him with a smile.

He was being despised!

Masude looked at Eli’s smile, and his eyes became even colder.

He was wanted in the central continent and had been looked down upon, but no one dared to look down on him here.

The blood in his body flowed faster, and blood suddenly surged up from Masude’s body, drilling out of his skin and turning into a huge lizard behind him. It wrapped around him and stared at Eli! ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

The next second, Masude streaked across the sky like a bullet.

His powerful physique allowed his speed to be almost invisible to the naked eye. Only a terrifying red shadow could be seen charging toward Eli, the pressure from his bloodline bringing with it the sound of the wind.

“Go to hell!” There was a sinister smile on Masude’s face, and he did not hide his malice at all!

Eli smiled and raised his hand.

A shadow gradually condensed.

Shadow Dragon breath!

On the other side, Maduse initially did not take the shadow that was gathering to heart seriously, but as the shadow gathered, Eli’s power gradually became apparent, and a feeling that made him feel fear gradually wrapped around his heart, like a shadow following him.

Wrapped in the blood, Masude’s eyes gradually widened.

What the f * ck is this?!

Is this a third-circle warlock?

The person in front of him was a celestial.

He had provoked the wrong person.

“Sir, please spare me!” Masude had never been as terrified as he was today. He shouted as he turned and ran. He didn’t dare to think about the spirit crystal.

The person in front of him was not the kind of person he could bully. He was the creator of this tragedy.

What the hell did he do?

Immediately, the blood outside his body began to burn. He was burning his own life force so that he could run faster. However, when he turned around, he only saw a shadow already in front of him.

“I’m finished!”

Masude cursed, and then he was covered by the black light!

As a beam of light with a diameter of several meters swept through the space, he only saw the blood around him bubble. His body had already disappeared into the shadows before he could even react.

This was definitely a celestial!

Before he died, Masude said in his heart, “It’s impossible to have such a powerful third-circle warlock.”

As he watched this half-step celestial die, Eli just waved his hand lightly. A gray shadow gradually appeared where Masude had died and then flew into the sky, all the way into the soul crystal.

With this step, the soul crystal was instantly completed and burst out with a dazzling white light.

A few seconds later, the white light disappeared, and the shadow in the sky disappeared without a trace.

However, a translucent crystal was floating in the sky, emitting a gentle light. Its aura was even more terrifying, reaching the level of a fourth-circle warlock.

“The second last step of advancement is complete!”

Eli flew over to grab the crystal, unable to hide the joy on his face.

“A fourth circle soul crystal, that’s enough.”

And so, after transmuting all the soul slaves, Eli left the place and returned to the bloodline tower.

Now, he was only lacking a bit of mental power.

..

At a valley!

It used to be an abandoned ruin, but since the Wanderer Alliance came, it became the core area of their force.

At the center of the Magus tower, there was a sudden cry of alarm.

...

“What? Masude is dead?!”

Guyiduo looked at the Warlock who had sent him the message, his face full of confusion.

“Yes, sir. We have confirmed that the aura that Lord Masude left in the Alliance has disappeared!” A woman said to Guyiduo.

“How did he die?”

Guyiduo frowned. He was a half-step celestial Warlock and the person in charge of the Wanderer Alliance. He was the one who sent Masude to investigate, but he was dead.

Who in the bloodline tower could kill him?

He didn’t quite understand.

“Gather the others!” He thought for a moment and then said to the woman.

“Yes!” The woman left.

Half a day later, dozens of people were gathered in a meeting room. All of them were at the peak of third circle, and six of them were half-step celestial, including Guyiduo.

The others were all looking at Guyiduo.

...

Guyiduo’s eyes were calm, and he said, “Masude is dead!”

“What? Masude is dead?! Didn’t he go to investigate the bloodline tower?”

“How is this possible? Could it be that the bloodline tower has discovered us?”

“What happened?”

Guyiduo’s words were like a bomb that woke everyone up. They were all shocked.

“I don’t know what happened either. However, it seems that Masude went missing near the Sofia mountains.” Guyiduo tapped the table lightly, signaling for silence.

However, no one seemed to be listening to him, and they continued to argue.

Guyiduo frowned at the sight.

It couldn’t be helped. They were all wanted criminals, and it wasn’t easy to unite these people. However, it was impossible for them to be completely obedient. This was also an important reason that restricted their development!

He had no choice but to wait.

After a while, the discussion ended, but there was still no answer.

They really couldn’t remember if there were any powerful figures in the bloodline tower. After all, they had just arrived.

As for Herman, they had never heard of him.

This was very normal. Even in the warlock world, if you didn’t show your face for more than a hundred years, how many people would remember you, let alone these outsiders?

Guyiduo opened his mouth after everyone had quieted down, “This time, we have to consider the worst-case scenario for Masude’s death. This means that the bloodline tower might have someone stronger than we expected!

“So we’ll stop our plan for a few years. I have a friend who belongs to an underground organization in the central continent. They have four half-step celestial warlocks and are coming to join us.

“By the time they arrive, we’ll have ten half-step celestial warlocks. No matter how many trump cards the bloodline tower has, they will be annihilated. At that time, we’ll take control of this land.”

“What? four half-step celestial warlocks?!”

“That’s great!”

“Really, I think we have enough people now. Maybe Masude’s death was just an accident! We should continue with the attack!”

Some people were happy, while others were unhappy!

But this time, Guyiduo didn’t plan to let them be.

A huge aura swept across the entire area. His gaze was cold.

“This is how the matter will be settled. Does anyone want to object? ”

He was able to control this place not because he was good at talking but because he had real strength.

Seeing Guyiduo’s reaction, the others didn’t say anything and agreed.

They would wait for the four half-step celestial warlocks to arrive.

They could wait for a few more years.
