455 Eli’s Help

Weng!

Thank you readers!

The buzzing sound pierced through the clouds, and the thousand-meter-long Sky Cloud Whale slowly left the vicinity of the Bloodline Tower.

On the tallest Wizard Tower, Eli stood on top and watched Jin Ji leave. Then, he looked down at the crystal ball in his hand!

The crystal ball was ordinary, but the content inside was priceless!

After all, Eli had been searching for decades, but he still hadn’t been able to find it. This piece of information was no less valuable than a second-class force in Eli’s hands or even more valuable. He had been prepared to fight a protracted war, but when he thought of such a pleasant surprise, it was no wonder that he was happy.

” So this is what breaking through to the fifth circle is like! ” Eli also checked the crystal ball and knew a little.

It was similar to the breakthrough of a Warlock, but the fifth circle of a Mage was to comprehend the law in the celestial Sun, then condense the seed of law in the celestial, and then continuously comprehend it. Finally, the seed broke out of the celestial and grew into the tree of law.

“The Mountain Giant King didn’t lie!”

Eli sighed deeply, and he was even clearer about the path ahead.

Raising the power of the celestial, comprehending the laws, trying to purify the pollution of the shadow laws, experimenting with the celestial Body!

“Looks like time is going to be tight.”

After finding his goal, Eli finally saw the direction he should go in. He was instantly filled with anticipation for the future.

An hour later.

Eli had already thought about what to do next and was ready to return to the Grassi Land. However, he had only taken a few steps when he looked back.

He sensed that something seemed to have happened to Jin Ji and the others!

With the Eye of Mercury activated, Eli’s line of sight quickly crossed tens of thousands of meters before stopping.

A huge Sky Cloud Whale stood in the middle of a towering mountain range. Jin Ji and a group of people stood in front of it, and in front of them was a Warlock who was blocking their way.

He was wearing a black warlock robe with mandala flowers on it. His head was covered by a hood, revealing only his eyes. His aura had reached the peak of the Radiant Sun Realm. He was looking at Jin Ji with an unfriendly expression as if he had been waiting here all this time. He did not hide the killing intent in his eyes at all!

“Ambush? Someone wants to kill Jin Ji.” Eli said. After listening to a few words, he understood that it was indeed an ambush!

“This is my lucky star. How could he die so easily?”

Eli shook his head and extended his right hand.

In the next second, a 100-meter-long black pillar of light shot into the distance. Eli then turned around and returned to the Grassi Land.

On the other hand, the Warlocks on the ground looked up at this scene. They were all curious about what had happened!

So Ya Mountain Range!

It was still this mountain range.

At this moment, the huge Sky Cloud Whale stopped uneasily on the spot and let out a cry. Jin Ji’s expression was also ugly.

“Who sent you to kill me?!” Jin Ji gritted his teeth as he looked at the Warlock, who was covered in black robes.

” You don’t need to know that. You just need to know that you will die here today. ” A hoarse voice came from under the Warlock robe, but it carried a hint of mockery!

Everyone’s expression was extremely ugly, especially Jin Ji. At this moment, his muscles were tense, and his bloodline felt a great sense of fatality!

He was only a Radiant Moon Warlock, and the subordinates he brought this time were not at the Radiant Sun level. After all, they were only a merchant association, and they were meeting friends within their territory!

Jin Ji smiled bitterly and gritted his teeth. “It’s Apland who hired you, right? How many Magic Stones did he offer? I can give you double! ”

Hearing Jin Ji’s words, the Warlock seemed to be stunned, but he still said, “Sorry, assassins have professional ethics too!”

Assassins?

Hearing this, Jin Ji’s eyes lit up, and he said even faster, “Five times!”

Hiss!

Even the assassin gasped at this moment because he knew how much money this was.

Unfortunately …

“He took out all his net worth and everything else. You can’t afford it!” This time, the Warlock shook his head and said.

Jin Ji’s face fell. The assassin in front of him was confident that he could kill all of them, so he even chatted with them for a while. The information he revealed also allowed him to know who did it. However, it was really, as the Warlock said, he really couldn’t afford the counter price!

“Forget it. It’s time to die!”

The Warlock did not want to say anything else. He stretched his body, and his aura exploded.

The Sky Cloud Whale let out a mournful cry and slowly descended to the ground. The Warlocks on it could not even move under this pressure. They all looked desperate. Even Jin Ji could only grit his teeth. He knew very well that he might really die here today.

“Go to hell!”

The Warlock’s speed was very fast, and he flew directly toward Jin Ji. Clearly, this was his primary target.

Jin Ji activated all the magic tools on his body, and dozens of layers of protective shields were activated in an instant. However, he was still very clear that he would not be able to hold on for long if the Warlocks got close!

“I, Jin Ji, actually died in such a ridiculous way!” Jin Ji gritted his teeth, his face filled with despair.

The Warlock was getting closer and closer. He could even see the contempt in his eyes.

But…Boom!

A huge black pillar of light arrived in an instant. The sea of clouds churned, and the space trembled. Everyone only saw a black pillar of light in front of them, and then they saw darkness.

However, when everyone opened their eyes again, they only saw a huge pit that was a few hundred meters deep. At the bottom of the pit, there was a Warlock whose body had been torn apart!

He was dead!

The sudden turn of events stunned everyone, but in the next second, the despair in their eyes was filled with surprise!

No matter what happened…But they seemed to be saved!

Even Jin Ji’s eyes were dull. However, when he thought of the shadow just now, he seemed to have thought of something. He immediately turned his head and bowed deeply in the direction of the Bloodline Tower.

There was no doubt that this time, it was Eli who made a move!

Seeing Jin Ji’s bow, the other higher-ups of the Bloodline Tower weren’t fools. They naturally understood what Jin Ji meant and bowed to the Bloodline Tower as well. They were originally unhappy with Jin Ji’s preferential treatment of the Bloodline Tower, but now, the resentment disappeared without a trace!

The Warlocks, who occupied more than half of the upper echelons of the Golden Cicada Merchant Association, were completely convinced by Eli!

After a few minutes, Jin Ji stood up.

The others also stood up and looked at Jin Ji, waiting for the next order!

At this moment, Jin Ji’s gaze was sharp as he said,” Change direction, I’ll leave alone. This time, Apland has gone too far. In that case, I can only send him on his way! ”

The others nodded in agreement.

No matter what, Apland could not live!

Hiring assassins?

It would be fine if they died. If they did not, with Jin Ji’s current power, he could forget about living.

Of course, they could understand why Apland did this.

However, he was really unlucky. Because of his connection with the Bloodline Tower, his forces were no match for Jin Ji. Now, even the assassin he hired was killed by Eli, and he would lose his life next!

What a pitiful child.

Soon, everyone split up and left, and a bloody storm was about to begin! Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Of course, Eli didn’t know about this, and he wasn’t interested either because he had things to do next.

Begin the experiment!
