451 The Gift of the Mountain Giant King

“Human, help me!”

Thank you readers!

Upon hearing this, Eli blinked and turned around. The giant in front of him was still sitting there like before, but the voice was undoubtedly sent by the giant.

Was this giant actually alive? Or rather, he was not dead yet!

“Help you?” Eli asked tentatively.

“Yes!”

The voice came again. This time, Eli confirmed that it was really the giant speaking!

“How can I help you?” Eli asked again.

“Kill me!” A painful cry rang out again. The black fog on the giant’s body suddenly bloomed as if it was about to attack Eli. Eli instantly felt a fatal threat, and he did not even see a trace of the possibility of survival!

However, in the next second, an earthen yellow aura suddenly erupted. The black fog instantly retracted, and the giant’s voice sounded again!

“Kill me!”

Painful cries rang out over and over again. This Giant King seemed to have been enduring immense pain for thousands of years, and at this moment, he saw the hope of relief!

Eli was stunned, but he did not make a move. Even a casual attack from the giant could easily destroy this clone!

As if seeing Eli’s hesitation, the giant’s voice sounded again. The distorted voice said, “Help me. I can give you a reward that you can’t refuse. Human Mage, you haven’t broken through to the fifth circle, right? I can help you! ”

The giant’s voice rang out, and Eli was once again stunned. This was the first time his identity as a mage had been seen through!

The giant’s words piqued Eli’s interest. If it were really the reward for breaking through to the fifth circle, then it would not matter, even if the clone was gone!

“How can I help you?” Eli asked directly.

” I’ve already been corrupted, but the power in my body is still resisting the power of the black fog. I need you to help me break the balance. I know it’s very difficult, so you’d better come here within a hundred years to help me resolve it. At that time, I’ll give you a gift for a breakthrough! ” The sound of the giant struggling could be heard again!

Break the balance?

Eli blinked his eyes as if he had thought of something. He stretched out his hand, and a pure white light instantly illuminated the place!

With a boom, the white light flew towards the giant in the distance while the Giant King’s eyes widened.

“What is this…? Purify? This thing is useful, damn … Ah, the balance has been broken!”

The pure power of purification suddenly erupted. Although this power was extremely weak and was not even worth mentioning compared to its power, this unique power caused the black fog’s power to weaken slightly. However, this weakening was enough for him!

A light instantly bloomed, and the black fog was instantly suppressed. The other half of the Mountain Giant King’s body slowly began to recover, and the black fog slowly disappeared!

This lasted for a full three hours!

Three hours later, the black fog above the giant suddenly dissipated, and the yellow light on the giant’s body instantly bloomed. Its shriveled body instantly filled up, and the original giant instantly transformed into a strong Giant King. With its clothes, the Mountain Giant King descended once again!

The moment the Giant King recovered, its bright yellow eyes looked at Eli, who was not far away and it thanked him, “Thank you, human Mage. If it weren’t for your help, I would never have been able to escape the torture of these five thousand years. ”

“Yes, yes.” Eli nodded, but he was still a little confused. After all, he was only here to collect resources. Who knew how such a thing would happen?

Moreover … Eli looked at the Giant King. The Giant King looked very healthy at the moment, but its vitality was depleting at a rapid rate. It would probably lose its life completely in less than an hour.

As if seeing Eli’s confusion, the Mountain Giant King only smiled and said, “I’m very grateful that you’ve freed me. Other than the conditions I promised you before, you can ask me three questions! ”

Eli was stunned, but he understood that this was a rare opportunity. He asked directly, “Sir, do you have the knowledge to break through to the fifth circle?”

“No, I haven’t.” The Mountain Giant King shook his head and replied, “Although I’m a 6-circle creature, I don’t know much about the Mage system. But I can tell you that the 5-circle Mages are related to the laws, and the 6-circle mages are related to the world.

“This is the first question; let’s move on to the next one!”

” The fifth circle is related to laws, and the sixth circle is related to the world! ” Ely was stunned. This was also the first time he had heard of such knowledge. He immediately felt that it was worth it. Although knowledge was just two sentences, its value to him was already immeasurable. At least it gave him a vague direction!

” Second question, my lord. What exactly is that black mist? ” Eli asked again.

“Black mist.” The Giant King seemed to have recalled some painful memory and said, “The Black Fog is a natural order controlled by a supreme expert of that civilization. After he died, the natural order scattered and corrupted every world fragment. I was also corrupted by it and chose to stay here! ”

The black fog was actually a law left behind by the death of an Omnipotent Entity. This was really shocking!

Even if he was dead and had lost his rule, he could still torture a six-circle Mountain Giant King for nearly 5,000 years. How powerful was his opponent?

“Alright then.” Eli took a deep breath and asked, “My lord, do you know where the mages went?”

“Aren’t you a Mage? You don’t know where the mages went?” The Mountain Giant King looked at Eli strangely and asked.

” My lord, I’ve never been out of the mage World. ” Eli replied calmly.

Hiss!

The Mountain Giant King’s pupils suddenly dilated, and he gasped. Then, he looked at Eli as if he had seen something, and he was even more shocked!

“The power of faith that belongs to the sea race. This is not your main body!” He said softly. Then, as if he had understood something, he said, “Oh, aren’t you walking the path of a mage? Or is it something else? It’s a little strange. Then you shouldn’t be affected by the curse. No wonder!”

The Mountain Giant King’s imagination ran wild, but Eli did not say anything.

“Where did the Mages go? It’s hard for me to answer this question because the Mages split into three groups and left in three different directions to find a new place to live!” the mountain giant replied.

“Alright.”

Eli was satisfied. Even though it was only three questions, Eli was already satisfied. The harvest this time was too great.

Moreover, he had not forgotten that the Giant King would give him a reward for advancing to the fifth circle.

Could it be a law?

Sure enough, in the next second, the Giant King slowly said, “I promised to give you a satisfactory reward. That is a laws!”

The Giant King suddenly raised his right hand and grabbed at the space in front of him. A black shadow was captured, and it was surrounded by dense black fog.

Looking at the shadow, Eli’s eyes widened. He seemed to see everything in the shadow.

Corrosion, devouring, darkness …

That was the shadow itself!

” Ever since the Mountain Giant World was shattered, most worlds would contain a portion of the natural order, which is also the most important thing to maintain the world fragment. And you are very lucky that the world fragment of this world’s natural order coincidentally contains a complete Shadow World’s natural order. You are very lucky, but of course, there are also disadvantages, which is that it has also been polluted by the Black Fog. You can only sense a very small part of it unless you can completely resolve the Black Fog pollution.

“Of course, even if you can only feel a part of it, it’s still a very precious item. You’re lucky!” The Mountain Giant King looked at him and threw the shadow to Eli!

Eli caught it and looked at the shadow wrapped in black fog. He found it difficult to breathe.

Wait a minute.

Eli suddenly looked at the Giant King warily and asked tentatively, ” Sir, if this is the most important part of the world fragment, won’t the world fragment collapse if it’s taken out? ”

“Yes.” The Mountain Giant King nodded approvingly and said, “So, you’d better leave this place within five minutes! ”

The corner of Eli’s mouth twitched.

It was so sudden, but it was indeed time for him to leave.

Eli nodded and was about to leave the temple, but he was stopped by the Mountain Giant King again!

” Wait, since this place is going to be destroyed, I’ll give you another gift. It’s an excellent material for a magic staff. Many people asked me for it back then! ” The Giant King stretched out his hand, and Eli heard a rumbling sound. Eli looked outside. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Not far away, the thousand-meter-tall mountain giant suddenly broke free from the ground. The earth shook, and the mountains shook. Then, it began to shrink slowly and flew toward Eli. In the process, it slowly shrank until it was only a few meters in size. The giant tree had already lost its life.

This was the terror of the Giant King. The giant tree that had caused them great trouble just now did not even have the slightest ability to resist.

“Thank you, sir!” Eli bowed respectfully to the Mountain Giant King and left.

Time was running out!

At this moment, as the rules were drawn out, Eli could already feel the ground shaking!

As he watched Eli leave, the Mountain Giant King only stretched his body and sat on his throne. In the final stages of his life, he chose to live and die with this fragment!

He looked into the distance, watching Eli leave.

“Wait?”

The Mountain Giant King’s eyes suddenly widened, and a trace of white light flashed in his eyes. He, who was originally prepared to face life and death, instantly lost his composure.

“F * ck!”

“I see!”
