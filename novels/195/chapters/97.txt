98 Bryne the Eighth-Queen Anna

The second Prince was dead.

This was something that no one had expected.

It was said that this happened when the second Prince had gone into the forest with the others during a hunting trip. When the hunt was over, they realized that the second Prince had not returned.

So, everyone returned to the forest to look for the second Prince. They also dispatched many soldiers and Knights. Finally, they found the dead second Prince in the corner of the forest and the Grand Knight who had been protecting him.

This was definitely a deliberate murder.

After all, the creatures in the hunting forest were placed there by the palace people for the hunt. How could there be a magical beast that could threaten their lives? Even if there was, there was a Grand Knight beside the prince. However, they died silently.

The Empire immediately sent people out to search, but there were no clues at all.

The biggest suspects were actually the third Prince and Anna.

After all, the second Prince was dead, and the third Prince was most likely to inherit the throne. As for Princess Anna, there was also a certain possibility, but the degree of suspicion was still less than the third Prince.

However, the inspection team still subconsciously ignored the prince and princess.

After all, any one of them could be the future heir, and it was not a good thing to challenge the future ruler.

At this moment, in Anna’s Palace.

When Anna received the news, she was also very surprised.

After expressing her sadness and surprise, she returned to the palace calmly. As for who killed the second Prince, there was no need to say much. She had just passed the information to her teacher, and the second Prince had died. It was hard not to connect the two.

“Teacher is too amazing.” Anna returned to the palace in a good mood.

She gently took off her white silk pajamas, then took a bath in the palace.

…

Just as Anna was enjoying herself.

In another Palace.

The third Prince sat on the main seat, drinking wine and laughing.

Below him were all kinds of nobles. Some of them had supported him before, and some of them came to support him after the second Prince’s death. They sat on both sides and drank wine.

The third Prince was really happy.

With the death of the second Prince, he was basically Bryne the eighth.

These few days, he would wake up laughing even in his dreams. As for his brother’s death, he really didn’t feel much. He had long wanted the second Prince to die!

Now, someone had helped him solve it.

“Your Highness, isn’t it too ostentatious of us to do this? Besides, the second Prince has just died. If someone wants to harm you, I think it’s better to stay in a safe place.” Seeing the second Prince’s expression, a woman beside him reminded him.

She was sent by the nobles on the Prince’s mother’s side to protect him, and she was also a Grand Knight.

“Himi, don’t worry. Take a look.” The third Prince glanced at the woman and asked her to look forward. “Do you see that? There are at least a dozen Grand Knights here and dozens of Knight guards outside. Do you think it will be dangerous here?” The third Prince stretched out his hand and said loudly.

“That’s right. Even if a peak Grand Knight were to come here, it would be absolutely impossible to get in front of His Highness.” A noble raised his cup and said loudly.

“That’s right. With us around, no one can hurt His Highness.”

“The second Prince must have been ambushed by a large number of Grand Knights. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have died so quickly. There are so many people here. How could anyone dare to come? ”

Many nobles discussed and raised their glasses to celebrate.

“That’s right, let’s drink!” The third Prince smiled.

Indeed, this place was impregnable. Who would dare to come here?

“Come, drink!” The third Prince stood up and raised his glass to the crowd.

Many nobles also stood up and raised their glasses.

“Why do I feel a little sleepy?” Suddenly, one of the nobles spoke.

“Me too,” The other noble also shook his head, feeling that something was wrong.

A noble not far away fell to the ground.

This was like a signal, and in the next second, everyone in the palace fell. Even the Grand Knight fell to the ground after taking a few steps.

“What is this?” The third Prince’s eyes were wide open, and he felt indescribable dizziness. From the corner of his eye, he saw that the Grand Knight who was his personal guard had fallen. The third Prince screamed in his heart, but he also fell straight forward and down the steps.

The sound of flesh hitting stone was heard, and the third Prince rolled into the hall.

The hall that was noisy a second ago fell into silence the next.

Even the outside of the palace was silent.

A few birds flew past, and the silver moonlight shone through the door. A pair of black shoes stepped in the moonlight and walked into the hall.

“This is a special stun potion that I’ve developed over the years. Even the magic elephant at the late stage of the zero circle I encountered in the Lorraine Kingdom couldn’t resist it, let alone a Grand Knight.” Eli looked at the Grand Knight, who had fallen to the ground, and smiled.

“Now, where is the third Prince?” Eli did not forget the purpose of his trip. He stepped through the crowd and soon saw the third Prince who had fallen at the bottom of the steps.

“Tsk, tsk, tsk, what a terrible fall.” Seeing the third Prince’s head covered in blood, Eli sighed and then sent a wind blade over.

There was a deep crack in the ground, and the third Prince’s head had been separated from his body.

After making sure that the third Prince was definitely dead, Eli looked around and made sure that no one was awake before walking out of the hall. He looked as relaxed as if he was shopping in a mall.

The next day.

When the guards who were passing by entered the palace, they found that it was full of people who were unconscious. They were scared out of their wits and ran out.

…

On the third day.

The news of the third Prince’s death once again shocked the kingdom.

However, this time, there was no search nor any action.

The official news was that the third Prince fell down the steps and died in an accident. Those who knew the inside story did not dare to reveal it, nor did they expose it. As for who did it, everyone had a vague guess, but no one dared to say it.

Another three days passed.

The Empire announced that first princess Anna would inherit the throne.

…

A month later.

Anna became the new queen.

On this day, the entire country celebrated.

People came out from the streets and alleys and gathered on both sides of the road. They cheered as they looked at Anna in the gorgeous carriage. Everyone was looking forward to her bringing New Hope to the country. Bryne had really been in decline for a long time.

From then on, she was the new master of this country. As for the past, no one dared to talk about it, or rather, no one cared.

Only the nobles would care about such things. The people did not care who would inherit the throne. They only knew that the seventh king, who had caused them to live a poor life, had finally become history.

The succession of the king only took three days, but the various matters that followed took a long time. By the time the various matters of the Empire were completed and the nobles expressed their loyalty, a month had already passed.

Everything ended.

Anna also sat firmly on the throne.
