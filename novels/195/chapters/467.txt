468 Spying on Memories

The laboratory!

Thank you readers!

The silver walls reflected the bright light of the mage alchemy lamps, and in the center of the laboratory were two tall tables. On the tables were two corpses. They were Lous and Tuman from the Heart of the Abyss.

Eli and Nikola stood beside Lous.

“Sir, this corpse doesn’t look right!” Nikola looked at the corpse with a deep gaze.

“Indeed!”

Eli nodded and looked at Lous, who had been stripped naked!

On his white skin, other than the normal body hair, there were black and red blood vessels all over his body, which looked like ferocious centipedes!

Moreover, it was not just a matter of one or two streaks. His entire body looked similar.

He was not the only one who was like this. Tuman, who was not far away, was similar. His body was also covered in black-red blood vessels.

“First, extract the soul!”

Eli said to Nikola. It had been less than an hour since the two of them died, but their souls still existed.

Nikola nodded and reached his hand out to Lous’ head. A gray aura slowly came out of his brain and condensed into Lous’ appearance, or rather, his soul fragment!

“What is your name?” Eli asked directly.

A soul in this state had almost no secrets.

“Luo…Lous!” The soul replied in a daze.

Very good. It seemed that the soul was undamaged.

“What is your purpose?”

“Under Lord Nero’s orders, go to the Bloodline Tower and kill Eli,” Lous replied in a daze again.

Eli nodded. As he had expected, this matter was indeed planned by the Heart of Abyss.

“Why?” Eli asked again.

“Because he has obstructed our plan and must be eliminated!” Lous replied again.

“Plan? What plan?” Eli’s eyes lit up as if he had gotten the key information.

“Plan…The plan…The plan is …” Lous answered hesitantly, and a pained expression appeared on his soul’s face. The black and red mist gradually emitted from his head.

Bang!

The soul exploded and turned into the purest spiritual power that appeared in front of the two of them.

“There’s a trap set up in the soul!” Eli looked at this scene calmly, his eyes narrowing slightly.

Without a doubt, this was Nero’s method to prevent the so-called ” plan ” from being leaked!

What was the plan?

Eli felt a little troubled. No matter what his plan was, it would definitely not be a good thing. The Eight-Armed Naga and the Saka family were still vivid in his mind.

The scope and targets of their plan, as well as the danger, might be much greater than he had imagined. Moreover, it would be much more dangerous and would hinder his peaceful life. That was something he did not want to see.

“Sir, I’m afraid the person behind the trap would have sensed it already. We’d better deal with Tuman quickly!!” Nikola pointed at Tuman’s corpse not far away.

“Good!”

Eli knew that he couldn’t waste any more time. He immediately ran to Tuman’s corpse and used the same method to absorb Tuman’s soul. At this moment, Tuman’s soul was already covered in layers of black-red aura, as if it would be destroyed at any moment!

“My lord,” Nikola revealed an anxious expression. It was obvious that Nero reacted faster than them.

However, in the next second, he only saw a flash of silver light. The black-red fog suddenly became unreal, and then it turned into an old face. Its eyes were also slightly open as if it was spying on its surroundings!

However, the silver light had already enveloped its surroundings.

In the light, images appeared, confusing the old face!

Nikola was stunned and looked at Eli.

At this moment, Eli was still standing calmly in his original position, but the silver light in his eyes was like the moon blooming. Four silver patterns were circulating in his eyes, and his hair was black and white as if it was changing.

At this moment, it was as if the silver light was fighting against the face!

But at this moment, the face seemed to have realized something. Its eyes widened, and a black-red fog suddenly bloomed as if it was about to break through the silver light environment!

“This can’t hold on any longer!”

Nikola had seen this kind of spell from Eli before. However, it seemed that it was not enough to suppress the face at this time!

“Sir, hold on!” Nikola watched anxiously!

However, in the next second, the four silver lights suddenly turned into five. An even more intense silver light suddenly bloomed. The four silver patterns turned into five, instantly causing the entire laboratory to glow with a silver light.

At this moment, Nikola felt a terrifying suppression and a fatal threat. As long as the lord was willing, he could kill him in an instant.

Something was wrong. Nikola looked at the face with great difficulty. The black and red fog on the face slowly dissipated and returned to normal. A few seconds later, it turned into nothingness, but Tuman’s soul also disappeared into the air!

Everything disappeared!

Eli was almost paralyzed on the ground, and his body felt extremely weak.

His expression was extremely ugly. Even if his Mercury Eye had broken through to the fifth level, he did not have the slightest joy!

“Milord, what happened?”

Nikola ran over to help him up and asked the weak Eli.

“I just paid the price for knowledge!” Eli stood up slowly and said in a melancholic tone.

Just now, he had tried to use the Eye of Mercury to suppress Tuman’s soul or the people behind Tuman, but to his surprise, it triggered Nero. That’s right, that face was Nero’s.

The first thing he did was to use the Eye of Mercury to create an illusion so that Nero did not see Eli and Nikola but something else. Of course, Eli was almost discovered. But fortunately, the Eye of Mercury had also broken through to the fifth circle after such a high-intensity confrontation and years of accumulation.

The fifth-circle Eye of Mercury was on a completely different level compared to the fourth-circle Eye of Mercury. There was a qualitative leap in all aspects, and he had successfully suppressed Nero, which was why he was not discovered!

However, this was not the main point. Eli managed to spy on Tuman’s memories during this conflict.

And that plan.

Eli narrowed his eyes, but his heart was in turmoil! Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Eli had considered many things. For example, Nero wanted to use the demons to achieve his goals. However, he had never thought that Nero was actually a demon!

Nero was no longer a human but an Abyss Demon Lord!

An Abyss Demon Lord from the depths of the Abyss that a fifth circle creature!

“This is troublesome!”

Eli looked at the two corpses in the distance and immediately felt troubled!
