329 The Establishment of the Marine Division

The next day.

Aisha came to report the losses caused by the tsunami to Eli.

“teacher, we lost about 100000 magic crystals, and the two nearby cities were completely destroyed by the tsunami. The magic herb fields nearby were also submerged!” Aisha said.

“Then what about those people who are insistent on not leaving?” Eli asked.

!!

“They’re basically all dead!” Aisha shook her head. “but one or two of them were lucky enough to survive. They came to our area and questioned us. We arrested them!”

“They came to question us?!”

Eli laughed, but he did not take it to heart.

“by the way, Grandmaster, I suspect that this tsunami may just be the beginning. I plan to set up a marine supervision Department to supervise the sea area near the West Coast. What do you think? ” Aisha asked.

“Good idea.” Eli nodded.

Since he was living here, he naturally had to master the situation of the ocean.

“Alright!” With Eli’s support, Aisha was much more confident.

After discussing the details for a while, Aisha left.

..

In the blink of an eye, a month had passed.

The Marine supervision Department was established under Aisha’s proposal, and Nikola was in charge of it with Hydra as support. Hundreds of outstanding warlocks were also selected to serve as members.

A month after the Department was established, the first round of coastal investigation was launched.

He discovered that there were many more creatures from the deeper parts of the ocean that had appeared in the nearby waters. They might have been brought here by the tsunami, but when the news reached Eli, he still had a faint feeling that something was not right.

“I’ll choose the water element for my next elemental spell!”

Eli had a faint feeling that water elemental sorcery might play an important role for a period of time in the future. Furthermore, water elemental sorcery was of utmost importance in a battle at sea.

With the experience of creating a spell for the first time, Eli had become much more skilled at it.

However, Eli did not know much about water elemental sorcery, and he had not studied it in depth.

It was also ten years later that he developed the first four-circle water element spell.

Vortex funeral!

It used the surging water elements to constantly rotate in the sea, creating a huge Whirlpool. However, it was filled with high-intensity water element blades. As long as one entered it, they would be ruthlessly killed.

Moreover, he had also fused the spell with a certain amount of devouring runes, which allowed the whirlpool to possess a very strong devouring power.

..

He didn’t know if it was a coincidence.

At this time, the Marine supervision Department also sent a new message.

Something was approaching the West Coast.

Nikola came to report.

“my Lord, my undead seem to have seen a large number of intelligent sea tribes approaching from the West Coast. If I’m not wrong, they should be from the devil killer whale clan, and there are about 300 of them.”

“The devil killer whale clan!” Eli blinked.

He encountered this race when he went to the ocean to get the materials for the third circle. They were deep-sea creatures. They seemed to have planned to occupy the coastal area before, but they were killed by him and never came back.

However, this time, the ocean’s strange movement had actually led them here.

It meant that they were not successful in the deep sea or had encountered an accident.

Eli was also very curious about what was happening in the deep sea.

“Are there any celestial rank ones?” Eli asked.

“My Lord, we haven’t detected any celestial devil killer whales yet!” Nikola said.

“Alright!” Eli nodded. “investigate carefully. Keep me posted.”

“Yes!” Nikola nodded.

After reporting, he also left.

..

Five days later.

Nikola told Eli that the devil killer whale clan had already arrived on the West Coast.

Eli transformed into a ray of blood light again and left the bloodline tower.

After a few hours, he arrived at the endless sea.

Looking at the Azure-blue water, Eli looked in one direction. In that direction, he sensed the aura of a large number of creatures, which should be the devil killer whale clan.

..

On the vast ocean.

At a location.

The waves rolled, and a black line could be seen moving forward. The dorsal fins cut across the water’s surface, leaving marks on the surface of the sea.

And if one looked carefully.

Under the dorsal fin were huge bodies with black-and-white patterns and small eyes. Each of them was at least seven to eight meters in size, and the bigger ones were more than ten meters.

There were hundreds of them, and they occupied a large area. This terrifying group made the nearby sea tribe creatures avoid them, not daring to approach.

...

And at the forefront of these devil killer whales, three devil killer whales that were more than ten meters long were swimming side by side.

The largest one was fifteen meters long, and its aura was at the half-step celestial realm.

“Boss, do you think it’s a good choice for us to leave?” The one on the far right suddenly turned his head and asked. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

The devil tiger whale in the center glanced at him and then said, “I don’t know, but the deep sea is getting more and more dangerous. With the departure of the Magi, there are more and more fourth-circle creatures, and our race has no celestial.

“I think it’s best for me to leave as soon as possible and develop in a safer place for a few years. I’ll return to the deep sea after I’ve advanced to the fourth circle!”

The other devil tiger whale no longer spoke.

“Boss, there should be humans near the coast, right? Wouldn’t that be more dangerous? ” The devil tiger whale asked.

“Hmph!” The leader snorted coldly and said, “do you think this is still the Mage world of the past?” If that group of Mages was here, I wouldn’t even be able to get within 100000 meters of the continent. But it’s different now. There are only a few warlocks left in the Mage world, and they’re far inferior to Magi!”

However, seeing that the two devil tiger sharks still seemed a little worried, he comforted them, “Relax. We’re going to the West Coast this time. I’ve already sent our people to investigate. There aren’t any celestials here. There aren’t even many third-circle warlocks. There won’t be any problems for us to develop there.”

“I see!”

The two devil tiger whales relaxed a lot after hearing this.

...

Although it was difficult for their clan to break through to the celestial realm, it wasn’t difficult to break through to the third circle. The Tiger whales were in the second circle when they reached adulthood. At this time, eighty percent of their team was second circle and above, with the third circle taking up almost half.

Such a force was common in the deep sea, but it was different here.

“Speed up. We’re very close.”

The devil killer whale leader suddenly emerged from the surface of the sea and let out a cry. The sound was not loud, but it was full of power.

All the devil killer whales began to accelerate after hearing this.

Hundreds of devil killer whales began to speed up and swim toward the West Coast.

A few hours later, a white line gradually appeared in the whales’ field of vision. As they got closer and closer, they saw land.

They had arrived.

The devil killer whale clan’s leader once again made a lowing sound, expressing his joy.

“Eh, the water current doesn’t seem right!”

Suddenly, a devil killer whale said.

The group discovered that as they advanced, the water in front of them seemed to be churning. Moreover, a kind of suction force was attracting all the devil killer whales, pulling them forward.

A devil killer whale jumped up and looked ahead.

He was instantly stunned!

On the surface of the sea in front of him, a huge Whirlpool with a radius of hundreds of meters was spinning. Countless waves rolled and gathered toward the center, and in the center was a huge Whirlpool that was so deep that the bottom could not be seen.

And they had already arrived at the edge of the vortex.

“Ocean Whirlpool!”

He shouted.

All the devil killer whales were shocked, and so was the leader of the devil killer whales. He also felt that something was wrong because he was half under the sea, and he could see the bottom of the sea in the distance.

In just a few seconds, a huge underwater Whirlpool was formed, violently absorbing everything around it. He watched as a living second-circle creature was sucked into the whirlpool, torn to pieces, and dyed the Whirlpool red.

This was not normal!

This wasn’t an underwater Whirlpool. It was an underwater meat grinder!

He was shocked!

Just as he was about to let his clansmen retreat, a suction force came.

From the corner of his eye, he could only see his clansmen being sucked into the vortex, even those with a third circle. He struggled madly, but after a few seconds, he was also sucked into the vortex.

“We’re finished!”

The devil killer whale leader realized that he was getting closer and closer to the whirlpool and couldn’t help but feel despair.
