343 Someone From the Main Tower

“He has broken through!”

Outside a mountain range outside the bloodline tower, a few hundred warlocks of the bloodline tower were surrounding a mountain range. Further away were dozens of third-circle warlocks.

They were all staring at the mountain peak nervously. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Because today, their new tower master, Eli, was about to break through to the celestial realm!

!!

“When he took over, he was at the limit of the third circle. It’s only been three years, and he’s about to break through? As expected of the disciple of Lord Herman!” A Warlock sighed.

“I know, right? Not long ago, Lord Nikola and Lord Hydra also broke through to celestial. If another one comes, we will have four celestial. I’m afraid the main tower might not be stronger than us.” Another Warlock chimed in.

“Indeed,” The crowd was in a heated discussion. Although Sir Herman was dead, everyone felt like the bloodline tower had been revived.

This feeling was especially true for the new tower master, Eli, who was about to break through to the celestial realm.

“It’s starting. It’s starting.” Someone suddenly shouted.

The others looked up and saw a huge aura erupting from the mountain range in the distance, followed by a thick shadow.

Eli was starting to break through.

…..

On the mountain peak.

Eli put down his hand that was controlling the weather and stretched his body.

Advancing to celestial was part of his plan, and the goal was to increase the ability of a character like Eli.

After all, a person who had suddenly appeared had to be traceable as much as possible. In fact, for this reason, Eli had already disguised his life trajectory in order for people to believe that he was a real person. It would seem very normal for him to go to the central continent later.

Eli was still very cautious.

“I still need a few more hours to break through. I’d better familiarize myself with my new technique.”

Just a month ago, the White pillar of light that had been brewing in the space of consciousness for a long time finally activated, and it also bestowed a new ability on Eli.

“Time domain!”

Eli stretched out his hand, and the space before him gradually became illusory. Tadpole-like runes twisted in the air, and slowly, the air around Eli visibly slowed down. Even the speed at which the air was floating and sinking had slowed down significantly.

At that moment, a small bug flew over. It could be seen that as soon as it entered Eli’s surroundings, his speed slowed down.

“Almost three times.” Eli was also observing.

Of course, he could not only slow down time, he could also speed it up, such as three times faster with a thought.

In the next second, the bug’s speed suddenly increased, going from three times slower to three times faster in an instant. The bug flew out like a cannonball away from Eli.

This was the new ability that Eli had obtained. Within a certain range, he could control the flow of time to be three times faster or slower, and this range was about a hundred meters. Of course, it could still increase as his strength increased.

“It’s just that the consumption is a Little Big.” Eli felt his exhaustion.

In just those few seconds, Eli had used up a 10% of his power of the celestial body. The consumption was huge.

Eli was currently a radiant sun sorcerer with about 200 units of celestial force in his body, which was also the beginning of the bright sun stage.

The radiant sun was divided into three stages, namely the dark Sun, the sun crown, and the bright sun.

The dark sun was the first stage where the celestial force was still dim. The sun crown had a crown burning around the celestial force. The last stage had the celestial force blinding like the sun.

“This is a good trump card,” A smile appeared on Eli’s face.

Even though this method consumed a lot of energy, it could not hide the advantages of this skill.

After all, he was controlling time!

Even Eli didn’t expect that he would be given a spell that could directly control the time within a range. It was simply ridiculous.

It was only when he reached the celestial level that Eli understood how powerful the knowledge of the time was. If not for the white light pillar, he might not even have had the chance to come into contact with it.

The power of time was something that even five or six circles would covet, let alone the fourth circle.

At the very least, there was not a single warlock who was famed for controlling time.

This also made him more and more curious about the white light pillar. Eli was very curious as to what exactly it was. Not only did it give him eternal life, it even gave him the power of time when he was still in the celestial stage. Did that mean that when he reached the fifth circle, he might even be able to obtain more related powers?

“I’m really looking forward to it!” Eli stretched his body and felt that there was not much time left.

The next second, the aura of a celestial burst out.

After a while, Eli walked down the mountain.

The moment he went down.

A few dozen warlocks had already gathered around.

“Congratulations on your successful breakthrough, master Eli.”

Many warlocks congratulated Eli, and he responded to them one by one.

…

In the blink of an eye, a month had passed.

The news of the bloodline tower’s new master breaking through to the celestial quickly spread.

During this process, Eli’s power of faith increased slightly.

With the power of faith, as long as other people showed respect to Eli, he would gain power.

Usually, a conduit of faith was very important, but faith was not something so inconvenient. It was actually possible to gather faith without a conduit, but this required Eli to be within a certain range of his worshipers. Eli’s current area of influence could basically cover the entire West Coast, but he couldn’t gather faith from beyond the West Coast without his statues.

Therefore, the faith system still had flaws, and he needed to find ways to make up for them.

Eli had around twenty thousand units of power of faith if we calculated one unit of faith as one first-circle warlock worshiper.

...

Therefore, the breakthrough this time only increased ‘Eli’s’ faith. It was actually just a few dozen units, and to him, it wasn’t much. At least, it was far from enough to raise his cultivation!

If he needed more power of faith, he would have to go to the central continent.

That was why Eli had been thinking about how to get to the central continent these days. He needed an opportunity.

He had to go to the bloodline tower. After all, he had done so much, and there was also Vivika, whose condition was unknown.

However, there was a problem. He wasn’t sure if the bloodline tower still remembered the West Coast.

The branch tower of the bloodline tower on the West Coast had not contacted the central continent for almost a hundred years, and even Eli had no idea if they had been forgotten.

However, a year later, the situation changed. He confirmed that the West Coast had not been forgotten but had been ignored.

But everything changed. The change was a Warlock from the central continent.

A Warlock from the bloodline tower.

Eli met with this warlock.

“You’re the one who wants to see the bloodline tower’s master?” Eli looked at the Warlock in front of him and smiled.

...

It was a 2nd circle female warlock. She was wearing a blue hat and blue and white clothes. Her eyes were purple, her skin was fair, and she had a good figure. However, the lady was holding her clothes tightly with one hand and looked nervous.

“My Lord, that’s right,” She said as she looked at Eli.

“State your purpose!” Eli leaned back on the sofa.

The woman clutched her clothes and said after a few seconds, ” my Lord, I’m sent by the main tower. I’m here to get the branch towers on the West Coast to support the main tower.

“The main tower has encountered an unprecedented crisis!”

The woman said nervously.
