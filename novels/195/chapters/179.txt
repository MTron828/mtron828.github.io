180 Slaughter

“We’re finished!”

Ross took a deep breath, looked at the huge white Tower behind him, and then at the enemies around him, his face full of despair.

At this time, almost all the high-level members of the White Tower had gathered here, including Kratos, who was at the peak of the second-circle, Theron and Jesse, who were at the late stage of the second-circle, as well as second-circle warlocks such as Rawls, and a large number of first-circle warlocks.

Ross was among them. They were gathered at the bottom of the White Tower, surrounded by a large number of blood alliance warlocks. The two sides were in a confrontation.

“Pabulo, you guys are too sinister!!” Kratos stood at the forefront and gritted his teeth as he looked at the master of the blood Alliance.

“Hehe, all’s fair in war.” Pabulo only laughed smugly.

“Can you tell me how you got here?” Kratos looked at the configuration of the opponent’s ten thousand health and cursed in his heart.

Pabulo was at the peak of the second circle, and there were still twelve more. What shocked him, even more, was that there was a peak second circle Warlock standing in the corner, calmly watching everything.

He had never heard of this 2nd-circle Ultimate Warlock!

“Hmph, we’ve been preparing for ten years. Not only did we rent a large mage tool that can hide our aura at a high price, but the previous war was also to dig a path.” Pabulo replied with a smile. Ten years of preparation were finally about to bear fruit.

“I see!” Kratos gritted his teeth.

“Hmph, enough nonsense. Either you surrender now, or you’ll be killed by us later. Choose one.” Pabulo said calmly.

At this point, the overall situation was basically set.

“Damn it, White Tower will never surrender!” Kratos cursed and instantly transformed into his bloodline. A large shadow surged out of his body and attacked Pabulo.

Pabulo smiled. Rocks appeared all over his body, and his body grew rapidly, turning into a three-meter-tall giant. He had fused with the bloodline of the mountain Giant.

“Go to hell!”

He rushed toward Kratos without hesitation.

The battle began, and the others also began to transform their bloodlines.

Theron’s eyes turned red, and his wings grew out of his back. His hands turned into sharp claws, and Roger transformed into a giant wolf. They looked at each other and charged at each other.

“The battle has begun. It’s a pity that Herman isn’t here, but even if he was, it wouldn’t be of much use.” Rawls’ entire body was covered in Crimson runes, and balls of flames shot out in all directions.

“Fight.” Ross took a deep breath and activated his shadow lizard bloodline, rushing toward the other side.

In an instant, the entire area below the White Tower had turned into a battlefield. All kinds of bloodline power erupted here, and many buildings collapsed. Ordinary acolytes might even be torn apart by the aftermath before they could even enter.

This was the real battle between White Tower and Blood Alliance.

..

The White Tower was not a small force, so its core area was naturally not small either.

There was at least a radius of five to six kilometers. Eli was in a relatively remote area, about four to five kilometers away from the center of the White Tower, but even so, he could still feel the intense battle that was happening under the White Tower.

“Sigh, it’s too sudden.”

Eli stood on top of a house, looking at the surrounding mess.

No one had expected a war to break out so suddenly and in such a desperate manner.

But fortunately, he could still be saved. Eli glanced at the White Tower and continued on his way.

At the entrance of an alley, two first-circle blood alliance warlocks looked at a first-circle Warlock not far away and the apprentice behind him, revealing a sinister smile.

“Damn it!” The Warlock of White Tower gritted his teeth and looked at the two warlocks in front of him.

He couldn’t even beat one, let alone two.

The two warlocks closed in step by step, and he had a look of despair.

“We’re finished!”

Everyone thought that they were going to die. Suddenly, a shadow flashed in the next second, and the two first-circle warlocks were sent flying. Their bodies had been cut in half.

“It’s Lord Herman.”

Someone raised his head and pointed at the back of the already-departing Eli.

“It’s the Deputy Speaker. I didn’t know he was so cool. Those two were late-stage first-circle warlocks, and he killed them so easily.”

“But I remember that he’s a first-circle Warlock. How can he be so strong? ”

“It was too fast. Just now, a shadow flashed by and two warlocks died. How could he be a first-circle warlock? ”

“This is ridiculous!”

Some people were shocked, some were confused.

“Are we saved? It’s Lord Herman.” The first circle sorcerer was also relieved. Although he was also shocked by Herman’s strength, he knew that it was not the time to be shocked.

He turned to the apprentice behind him and said, “There’s no time. We have to go and meet up with the main force now.”

“Yes.”

Everyone quickly left.

“Sigh, it’s too chaotic.”

After casually taking care of a few more first-circle apprentices, Eli stopped.

It wasn’t that he didn’t want to go anymore, but there was a figure running towards him at full speed not far away. It was a second-circle Warlock.

..

“Herman, I finally found you!”

Sores shouted as he ran towards Eli.

He was moving in the direction that the Warlock had told him before, and then he suddenly saw Eli’s figure.

“And you are?” Eli furrowed his brows. The second-ring warlock’s expression, which seemed as if he wanted to kill him, left him dumbfounded.

“Who are you? Do we know each other?”

“We really don’t know each other. I’ll only tell you a name. Adams, do you remember? ” Sores stopped and stared at Eli.

“Adams, who is it?” Eli frowned.

“What? you don’t remember?” Solis’ eyes widened. What kind of person was this? You killed my grandson and didn’t even remember him?

“Oh, I remember now. Are you talking about the idiot who sealed himself? ” Eli said as he recalled.

“An idiot?” Sores gritted his teeth as he listened to Eli’s evaluation of the grandson he loved the most.

“Go to hell!” He couldn’t hold it in any longer. He instantly transformed into his bloodline and let out a sharp cry. A large number of sound waves attacked directly towards Eli, and at the same time, they rushed toward him.

Sound wave attack!

Eli raised an eyebrow, and a shadow wall suddenly appeared, blocking the attack.

As for Sores, who was charging at him, Eli just pursed his lips. A mental force attack was instantly activated from his earring, and it was aimed at Sores. At the same time, a spell model was activated.

Mental power attacks were very unfamiliar to warlocks, so Sores didn’t even have time to react and was already attacked. He only felt a burst of dizziness.

By the time he reacted, a large number of vines had actually grown out of the ground, directly climbing up his legs and clinging onto his body, tightly wrapping around him.

“What is this?” Sores’ eyes widened. Herman knew how to use mental attacks? and what were those vines?

He knew that he had to break free immediately. In an instant, the flames burned all over his body, trying to burn the vines.

But how could Eli give him the chance? in that instant, he had already arrived in front of Sores and grabbed his neck with his arm.

“Damn it!” Sores cried out in his heart, and the flames spread toward Eli’s arm at the same time.

What made him dumbfounded was that the flames didn’t have any effect on Herman’s arm. Instead, a large number of shadows rushed out and covered Eli.

“How is this possible?” Sores’ eyes widened in disbelief.

He had guessed that Herman was at second circle, but he did not expect him to be this strong.

“I’m Sores, spare me!” Feeling Herman’s power, fear appeared on Sores’ wrinkled face. Only now did he understand how powerful Herman was.

“I’m sorry. I’m very busy today and have no time to listen to you beg for mercy.

“Also, you’re as stupid as your grandson.” Eli shook his head.

Countless shadows instantly poured into Sores’s body, and in the next second, countless needle-like shadow spikes surged out from the inside and tore him into countless pieces.

As for Eli, he shook off the blood on his hand as if he had just crushed an ant.

Casually snatching away Sores’ items, Eli quickly flew towards the White Tower.

The man was too weak!
