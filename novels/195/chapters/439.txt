440 Giant King’s Court

The golden light cut through the sky, and Eli passed through the atmosphere, once again entering the outside of the world.

Outside the world, it was pitch black. World fragments were flickering in space. Eli was also filled with emotions. When he was young, he had prayed to these world fragments as stars. Who knew that the so-called ” stars ” were actually fake?

At this time, Eli had also arrived at the area where he had been last time. It happened to be in the sky above the Western Region, and there was still no one there.

Eli was also very clear that although the agreement was thirty years later, it was normal for there to be a day or two of deviation.

Just wait!

Three days later, a green light streaked across the sky, and Ely saw Gade again.

As soon as Gade arrived, he looked at Eli apologetically and said, “I’m sorry. I was discussing with the Heart of the Abyss today, so I was delayed for some time. I’m sorry!” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“It’s alright.” Three days were nothing to Eli, but hearing the name of the Heart of the Abyss still made Eli subconsciously alert. He pretended to ask casually, “Oh? The Heart of the Abyss is very far away from you. I didn’t expect it to be in contact with you.”

Gade didn’t think too much about it and explained with a smile, “The Heart of Abyss is a major faction in the Western Regions. In fact, we are more or less in contact with them. This time, it was just a very normal transaction. They bought a batch of Barrier-Breaking Stones from us.”

“Barrier-Breaking Stone?” Eli blinked. He naturally knew about this material because this thing was actually the raw material for bloodline rings or spatial rings, and it contained a large amount of spatial power.

It seemed normal, so Eli didn’t ask further.

“Yes. I wonder if you need it. Perhaps we can establish some connections. Your Bloodline Tower is quite famous in the Central Region.” Gade laughed.

“Of course. Just send someone over when the time comes.” Eli replied.

“Thank you so much.” Gade nodded. The Bloodline Tower was more than famous now!

In the central region, its reputation was almost the same as that of the Heart of the Abyss. In fact, it had spread even wider. At least, many factions were very interested in its potions and some of its creations. However, the quota was always gone in an instant. If they could connect with Eli, it would naturally be a good thing!

They were lucky to have met Eli, and their statuses were similar. However, the Bloodline Tower’s growth was beyond their imagination!

At the very least, their wealth was not inferior to a first-class force.

” Thirty years have passed. I wonder if Sir Gade has already gathered them to prepare for the World Fragment? ” Eli changed the topic and asked.

“It’s already prepared. ” Gade nodded and said, “Other than the two of us, I’ve already gathered the other three Radiant Sun stage Warlocks. They are all trustworthy. After that, we will be heading to the world fragment, which was once part of the mage’s world. The location isWe will gather there in ten days. You have another ten days to prepare.”

“Alright, I’ll do it. “Eli nodded and asked, “Then which world does that world fragment belong to? ”

“Mountain Giant World!”

…

“What is it? Mountain Giant Fragment!”

In the elven temple in the green fields, Ely gathered some races at the last minute and began to ask about the information of this world.

“Yes.” Eli nodded. When they talked about the races in the world, the other races in the Green Field knew better.

” I do have some understanding of the Mountain Giant World. ” At this moment, one of them spoke. It was Feather King!

Eli looked over.

Feeling the gazes around him, the feather King coughed twice and said, “It’s like this. During the mage era, the Feathermen World and the Mountain Giants were adjacent, so we still have a lot of records about this world.

“The Mountain Giant World should be considered a medium-sized force in the Middle World, and its environment is similar to the warlock World. However, it’s either plains or mountain ranges, and there’s no ocean. The Mountain Giants are loyal to the mage Alliance, and they’re extremely brave in battle. With the giants ‘physical fitness, they’re ranked first in the mage Alliance in war!”

Eli nodded. That was true. The Mountain Giants were considered tall among the giants. Even an ordinary Mountain Giant would have at least third circle strength when they reached adulthood. They would be 100 meters tall and at least 400 meters tall when they reached the celestial realm. They would be like a mountain range.

Of course, the weakness of this race was that they had very few people. Otherwise, they would at least be a top-tier medium world!

“The Giant King of the mountain range is also a member of the mage Alliance and holds a certain amount of power.

“Of course, the Mountain Giants ‘main method is to rely on their bodies made of stone to fight. There’s basically not much fancy stuff. Other than that, this world seems to have quite a lot of resources. Whether it’s the Mountain Giant Wood or the Eternal Night Flower, they’re all very famous high-level materials!”

“Wait!” The Feather King was still talking when he was suddenly stopped. He looked up and saw Eli staring at him.

“Lord Roland, what’s wrong?” he asked cautiously.

“I’m fine!” Eli shook his head, but his heart was in turmoil!

Eternal Night Flower.

It seemed that he had to go to this world fragment. After all, the burden of his breakthrough was placed on it, and there was also information about the dark and strange civilization.

“Continue!” Eli said again.

The feather King began to explain again. The outline of this world became clearer and clearer.

After the Feather King finished speaking, the other races, including Erwin, also shared their impressions of this race.

“Alright.”

In the end, Eli nodded and dispersed the various races.

In the blink of an eye, nine days passed.

On this day, in the Grassi Land, Eli watched as his clone flew into the sky and disappeared before his eyes. He returned to the Warlock Tower and closed his eyes. This time, he was going to put most of his energy into exploring the fragments, and his main body would temporarily fall asleep.

‘I hope everything goes well!’

….

Like the previous times, Elo entered the outside world and quickly advanced according to the spatial coordinates provided by Gade.

The spatial coordinates were actually located in the sky above the central region, and the distance outside the world was closer than Eli had imagined. In just an hour, Eli had arrived at his destination.

This star field was similar to the one before but the world fragment here was obviously much brighter.

At this moment, there were four people standing in the starry sky, three men and one woman. One was wearing a white magician robe with bright eyes, one was wearing a black magician robe with dark skin and looked a little old. The female magician was wearing a tight purple robe, and she looked beautiful and had a sharp gaze. The last person was Gade.

Eli flew over and smiled at Gade. “I didn’t expect to be the last to arrive.”

“It’s okay. We’re just a day early.” Gade smiled and was about to introduce the other three to Eli, but they were a step ahead of him.

The female Warlock in purple nodded and said enthusiastically,” Hello, Stacy Conrad of the Conrad Family, fourth-circle Corona Warlock, Bloodline Giant Spider. Gade has already mentioned you to us. I didn’t expect to meet the famous Bloodline Tower Master! ”

...

” Hello, Eli. Shadow Dragon Bloodline. ” Eli smiled and nodded. At this moment, the other two also greeted Eli.

The white-robed Warlock nodded. “Karel Shepard, four-circle Dark Sun Warlock, bloodline holy Pegasus! ”

Black Warlock Robe: ” Clessie Lass, four-circle Dark Sun Warlock, Bloodline of the Bloodthirsty Wolf! ”

Eli replied.

“It seems that everyone is still very harmonious. It seems that the rest of the journey will be very smooth!” Gade chuckled.

Stacy looked at Gade and said, “Gade, since Eli is here, you can tell us the specific information about the world fragment, right?”

Gade nodded. ” This time, we’re exploring the fragments of the Mountain Giant’s world. I’ve already done a preliminary investigation. It’s the core area of the Mountain Giant’s world, which is the most resource-rich area in the Mountain World. My goal is the mountain trees in the core area of the Mountain Giant.

“I only want this. As for the other resources, we can divide them according to our contribution points or needs. You can even buy them!

“I wonder if anyone has any opinions?”

Gade’s attitude was sincere, and the other three did not say anything. However, Eli asked a question.”What other dangers are there in here? Since you’ve already explored it but retreated, this place shouldn’t be simple, right?”

The other three also looked at Gade.

...

“Ahem.” Gade coughed and said, ” That’s true. I discovered that there were still some giants here, but they had been contaminated. For safety reasons, I ran out and invited everyone. ”

“There are giants?”

Eli blinked. There were still giants in that world fragment.

However, what did he mean by contaminated

Could it be that they had been corrupted by that civilization?

The other three nodded. It would be strange if there weren’t any danger. Eli didn’t ask any more questions. They would know when they went in.

” That’s it then. Let’s set off. That world fragment isn’t far from here. Everyone, follow me closely. ” After Gade finished speaking, he flew toward the world fragments in the distance, and everyone followed.

Eli followed closely behind him, avoiding the world fragments around him. Eli also memorized the route as he walked!

Time passed bit by bit, and everyone finally arrived at their destination.

Among the many world fragments, a huge fragment suddenly appeared. It was several times larger than the others, and it gave off a faint white light. There was also spatial power floating around it. Through the outside world, everyone could see a faint black light flickering within it.

“This is the place.”

Gade turned around and looked at everyone, then directly entered the world fragment!

Enter!
