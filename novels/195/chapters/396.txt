397 Eli’s Attack 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

However, when the elemental cannons fired, they died one by one.

There were thirty shots in one round, but nearly a hundred flying Warlocks and magical beasts died. They fell like rain.

Seeing this scene, the Warlocks from both sides were stunned.

The Warlocks of the Akasha Family widened their eyes as they watched the bloody scene.

“What is this? It’s too ridiculous.”

” That’s right. So many people died in one round. ”

“Is no one going to do anything? Can warlocks even do this?”

All the Warlocks felt a sense of absurdity. They felt as if their understanding had been shattered.

The Warlock forces fought flesh-to-flesh in close combat, but an elemental cannon was too much of a bully.

Everyone finally understood why the Bloodline Tower didn’t have any magical flying beasts. A few rounds of shooting would be enough to destroy their flying team.

The moral of the Warlocks of the Bloodline Tower soared, and they cheered. The worries that had been hovering in the sky instantly dissipated.

At this moment, the flying Magical Beast Army was also in a mess. They were flying in the sky in a daze.

” Everyone, don’t be afraid. Such a powerful attack can’t be unleashed a second time. Charge! ” A Warlock shouted.

The others nodded in agreement.

In the next second, another round of elemental bombardment was fired. When the elements dissipated, the remaining dozens of flying Warlocks in the sky looked at each other and then fled in their own direction.

F ** k it, it was possible to launch a second attack.

At this moment, these Warlocks were already scared out of their wits.

The magical flying beasts returned as if they were fleeing for their lives, and the occasional elemental light waves swept past behind them, and the rear of the Akasha Family was deathly silent.

No one had expected that the aerial attack would end up like this. At this moment, they all realized that the opponent this time was completely different from their previous ones.

The silence lasted for more than ten seconds before a Warlock spoke.

” The Bloodline Tower is indeed something, but during a close combat battle, their cannons won’t be of much use. As long as we can withstand this wave of attacks, we’ll be fine. ”

“Indeed, the overall quality of our Warlocks is very high!” Another Warlock nodded.

Pavao did not say a word at the moment, only looking at the battlefield.

At this moment, the elemental cannons were firing non-stop. Although the two armies had not engaged in battle yet, they had lost a large number of Warlocks, and their morale was somewhat low.

“Close combat? Can we win?”

Pavao suddenly asked.

As time passed, the two armies clashed.

…

“Kill! “Rafiq’s face was now bloodshot, and his battle will reached its peak.

He was not the only one. The others also felt their blood boiling. This was all due to their victories in the first two rounds.

As the two armies approached, he gripped the weapon in his hand tightly and roared!

Finally.

The two sides collided!

It was as if two rivers were crashing into each other from different directions, roaring and trying to devour the other.

However, what surprised Rafiq was that the Warlocks on the opposite side were instantly at a disadvantage in this round of collision. Many of their weapons were directly cut in half by the weapons that were branded with hard runes. Then, the Warlocks of the Bloodline Tower would send their weapons into the bodies of the stunned Arkasha Family Warlocks.

And this was not an isolated case.

” How is this possible? My weapon has been cut in half! ”

“Ah, spare me!”

“What the hell is this weapon?”

One by one, the Arkasha Family’s Warlocks died with unwillingness. They had never thought that they would die in such a ridiculous way.

As the two armies clashed, the battle gradually dispersed. What happened next made them collapse.

Every time a Warlock of the Bloodline Tower was injured, they would take out a bottle of dark green potion, and their injuries would recover at speed visible to the naked eye. Moreover, their stamina was even more abundant than before.

However, this was not all. Some Warlocks would even take out a red Critical Health Potion, and the power they could unleash would be more than 30 to 40 percent stronger than before. Many of the Akasha Family’s Warlocks had died from this sudden explosion.

In just a few minutes, the Akasha Family was completely at a disadvantage.

During this process, the third-circle Warlocks of the Akasha Family were also being beaten up. As soon as they rose into the air, dozens of elemental cannon fires would fly in their direction, and the third-circle warlocks from the Bloodline Tower, which was already in the air, would attack them in time!

At this moment, all the Warlocks of the Akasha family were in unbearable pain!

They had never fought such a depressing battle before. Compared to the Bloodline Tower, they were like primitive people who had fallen behind.

After the battle, Pavao’s face was as black as charcoal. The other Warlocks also had ugly expressions.

The others didn’t dare to speak either. The atmosphere was silent.

After more than ten seconds, Pavao gritted his teeth and turned to look at the celestials behind him.” Everyone, it’s obvious that we’re at a disadvantage. However, this is also a good thing. After the war is won, these will all be ours.

” Let these Warlocks of the Bloodline Tower understand that the celestials’ combat power is everything!

“It’s time to make them feel fear!”

Pavao enunciated each word, and the others nodded.
