240 I’m Not Good at Offense

“Roar!”

The smoke dispersed and the three of them looked over.

A greyish-yellow demonic bear walked out from the smoke, exuding a powerful aura. Pieces of yellowish-brown rocks were attached to its body, like armor. At this time, its brown-yellow eyes were staring at the three people, and it let out an angry roar!

“Everyone, let’s go!”

!!

Ignoring the demonic bear’s roar, udu looked at the two of them and quickly descended.

At the same time, black and red patterns appeared on his body, and his body was burning with a layer of flames.

The Hellfire monkey bloodline!

He threw a ball of fire at the demonic bear.

Bang!

It didn’t even have time to defend itself before it was hit. With a bang, a piece of its body was shattered, revealing a blood-red color.

Feeling the pain, the demonic bear roared and also looked at Udo!

Roar!

The huge demonic bear stood on the ground, and the rocks around it began to move. Rock spikes appeared one after another, flying directly toward the falling Udo.

“Damn it!”

Seeing this, Udo knew that he had been too careless!

But in the next second, a storm flew past, shattering all the rock spikes and scattering them on the ground, allowing Udo to land smoothly.

“Thanks!” Udo raised his head and shouted.

“It’s a small matter. You can repay me with your body!” The one who had attacked was Simona. She had also transformed into her bloodline, and she flapped her wings and winked at Udo.

Udo took in a cold breath.

However, when the demonic bear on the ground saw this scene, it was as if it had been humiliated. Its entire body rapidly grew taller, and it directly charged toward Udo. Its huge body was like a small mountain.

“Damn it!”

Udo felt that he must have been out of his mind to be the first to rush down!

But in the next second, to his surprise, he saw shadows rapidly rise from the ground and directly wrap around the demonic bear’s four limbs, trapping it in place.

Udo didn’t need to say anything to know who it was.

He looked up at the sky, and the bloodline-transformed Eli was now surrounded by shadows, and he nodded at him.

“I’m not good at offense. I’ll mainly help you control the demonic bear. I’ll leave the attacking to you!” In the sky, Eli shouted at Simona who was not far away, and Udo who was on the ground.

“No problem!”

Udo shouted.

After all, the shadow lizard only had a second-circle bloodline. It was probably lucky that it had advanced to the third ring. It might not have enough combat power, but it was good enough that he could control it. He had high attack power, but he was afraid of opponents with high attack and defense.

“Oh, such strong control. Herman, I think I’m in love with you!” Simona smiled sweetly. She flapped her wings and dodged the demonic earth bear.

Two streaks of white light streaked across, and two wounds instantly split open on the demonic bear’s legs, causing large amounts of blood to flow out!

Roar! Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

The earth demonic bear roared, trying to break free from the shadows. However, before it could break free from the shadows, more shadows pounced on it, locking it in place. Udo and Simona were overjoyed. They didn’t expect Herman’s control to be so strong.

Just like that, under the joint attack of a few people, wounds appeared on the huge demonic bear’s body. Throughout the whole process, the demonic bear did not even get to attack the few people.

“It’s so smooth!” Udo didn’t expect this either.

He turned his head to look at Eli in the sky. This level of control is really terrifying. “Luckily, he’s not good at attacking. Otherwise, how would the other bloodlines survive?”

“It seems like there won’t be a big problem!” In the sky, Eli looked down at the ground. The two of them were like two butterflies flying around the demonic bear, and the earth demonic bear’s aura was decreasing bit by bit.

It seemed like he didn’t need to do anything!

“Eh, something’s wrong!” Suddenly, it was as if he sensed something. Looking into the mine, he seemed to have seen something. Immediately, a shadow quickly condensed in his hand, ready to be used at any time.

..

“It’s time to end this!”

On the ground, seeing the demonic bear being tied up, Udo condensed another flame. The flame condensed into a long spear and flew directly toward the demonic bear’s eyes.

In the blink of an eye, the fire spear directly crossed a distance of more than ten meters and stabbed into the demonic bear’s eyes.

Roar!

The demonic bear howled in pain as blood flowed out of its eyes. However, the blood was quickly dried up by the flames, and it was half-knelt on the ground as if it was about to die.

“Well done!” Not far away, Simona’s eyes lit up.

Just as she was about to make his move, she suddenly sensed something. From the corner of his eyes, she saw an even larger demonic bear running out of the mine. Its speed was like a Cannonball as it approached Udo.

“Damn it, a middle-stage third-circle demonic bear!!” Simona screamed.

“Oh my God, there was actually another demonic bear hidden here. The Golden cicada Chamber of Commerce’s information was wrong!”

On the other side, Udo’s eyes were also about to pop out of their sockets. He had just attacked and couldn’t fight back, let alone escape. Once the demonic bear got close to him, it could even tear him apart!

“We’re finished!”

Udo’s face was filled with despair. He had never thought that such an accident would happen.

As expected, it couldn’t be too smooth!

At this distance, he couldn’t do anything at all. He could only watch as the third circle middle-stage earth demonic bear got closer and closer. He looked at the demonic bear’s frenzied eyes and wild body, and his body tensed up to the extreme!

...

“Shit!”

Simona gritted her teeth. The bears were too far away, and she couldn’t stop it.

It seemed like this mission was going to fail. As for Eli, she had no idea what he could do at all. After all, he was just a Warlock who was good at controlling!

“He’s dead!” Unlike a normal person who would choose to close their eyes, Udo’s eyes were wide open as he watched the demonic bear extend one of its sharp claws and swing it at him!

He was getting closer and closer!

Bang! Bang!

Udo knew that there was no hope, but in the next second, his vision turned black. It was not the darkness of darkness, but a black light flashed in front of him. Then, he saw the demonic bear in front of him disappear in an instant, and a crack appeared on the ground. That was the demonic bear’s huge body being smashed into the ground!

“What?”

Udo’s face was blank, the black light in front of him seemed to still be there.

When the smoke dispersed, a five to six-meter-deep pit appeared where the demonic bear had been. The surrounding ten meters had already sunk in, and Udo was at the edge of the pit.

In the center of the deep pit, there was an earth demon bear whose head had disappeared. Its neck was still bleeding, and the surrounding shadows were twining and biting the body of the earth demon bear!

...

“This!”

Udo took a deep breath and looked up at the sky.

In the sky, one of Eli’s hands was stretched out, and he smiled at him.

“I’m not good at offense!”

Udo’s mind suddenly flashed with what Eli had just said!

What lies?!

Killing a middle-stage third-circle great earth demonic bear with a single attack, and you call this not good at offense?

He had just been slowly grinding away at the three-ring initial stage demonic bear, but in the next second, he had launched such a powerful attack. Wasn’t this a little too much?

Not far away, Simona’s mouth twitched as if she had seen a ghost!

She also looked at Eli and pursed her lips, not knowing what to say!

In the sky, Eli waved his hand helplessly!

Of course, it was good to be able to survive, but there was obviously a small accident!

Suddenly, the other demonic bear that had been bound seemed to have finally broken free from the shadows. It also saw the scene in front of it and was stunned!

Where was its mother?

It clearly felt its mother’s aura just now. Why did it seem to have disappeared in an instant?

“Everyone, let’s settle the remaining one first!” Eli slowly landed and said to Udo, who had a complicated expression on his face, and Simona, who was not far away!

“Alright!” The two of them nodded, then looked at the heavily injured earth demon bear!

In the next second, the demonic earth bear’s remaining eyes could only see flames and a storm.

After a short while, its huge body fell to the ground with a loud thud.
