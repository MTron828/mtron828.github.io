288 The End of the War

On the ground, the two forces were still fighting.

In the corner of the battlefield.

The flames flowed like a large river. The scorching flames wrapped around Woox’s body like a gorgeous flaming cloak. The staff in his hand emitted a pressure that seemed to have substance.

Nikola’s body was spread open like a flag.

Countless spirits of the dead were wandering around, making undead sounds that would make ordinary warlocks go crazy. They also provided Nikola with resources to resist Woox’s attack!

“Nikola, you’re very strong, but it’s a pity that flames can restrain the undead!” as Woox fought against Nikola, he waved his staff, and a long flame cut through the air, smashing toward Nikola.

The flames swept through the air, but Nikola waved his hand.

A wall of undead had already appeared, and they turned into ashes. However, Woox’s attack had also been blocked!

The flames disappeared along with the wall of the undead.

Nikola’s face was ugly.

‘Damn you, this old man is too difficult to deal with!’

“You can block it once, but how many times can you block it?” Woox’s face was calm.

“Klay is dead!”

Nikola suddenly said to him.

??

Woox furrowed his brows. Couldn’t you lie better?

But suddenly, he noticed a detail. Why was there sunlight again on the ground where he was standing? It was clearly covered in thunderclouds just now, but no, the Thunder seemed to have disappeared.

Woox’s lips trembled slightly. He raised his head cautiously.

A scene that made people collapse appeared!

The thunderclouds in the sky were slowly dispersing, and the huge Thunder Eagle was slowly defeated like an illusory bubble. It was both real and unreal, and there was only one person in the center-Herman!

“Where’s Lord Klay?”

He did not see Klay’s body.

“It’s falling!” Nikola’s voice came from the distance, and it sounded like he was being mean.

Hearing the voice, he lowered his gaze.

Three hundred meters above the ground, a figure was descending at a rapid speed.

Thanks to his third circle vision, he could see very clearly.

That was Klay.

His appearance was the same as before. There was no change at all. There was some lightning all over his body, but it flashed like a jam. To his surprise, there were no longer any soul fluctuations in Klay, as if his soul had been erased.

When a soul was gone, it would usually only appear after death. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

He seemed to have understood something this time!

Is he dead?

His body trembled in disbelief.

How was this possible?

Wasn’t Klay a half-step celestial?

And now you’re telling me that he died in the blink of an eye?

Was Herman that strong?

Bang! Bang!

Woox’s body was powerless. The iron rod cut through his fingertips and fell to the ground. His eyes were sad as he looked at Klay, who had fallen to the ground, and closed his eyes.

It had ended!

They had all underestimated Herman!

Of course, it was not only Woox and Nikola who noticed the changes in the thunderclouds.

The others also noticed it.

“How is this possible? How can Herman be so strong?!”

“Milord, we’ve lost!”

“Impossible! I can’t accept this! No!”

“Just how much power is Herman hiding? Is he a celestial?”

On the battlefield, the warlocks of the Holy tower were in despair.

Klay’s god-like appearance was still reflected in everyone’s hearts, but in the next second, he was killed by Eli in one move. It did not even last more than three seconds.

He couldn’t understand.

“Lord Herman won!”

“He’s too strong!”

“I knew you could do it, Sir. I’m your absolute fan!”

“bullsh * t! You were just shouting that we were done for. Do you think I didn’t hear you? ”

The bloodline tower’s side was at ease. The warlocks were shocked, but they also heaved a heavy sigh of relief.

...

The more desperate they felt just now, the more relaxed they felt now.

It was too exciting.

“Is that my teacher?” Surrounded by a group of warlocks, Vivika’s eyes flashed with inexplicable light.

She bit her lips as she looked at Eli’s back in the sky.

Her teacher had always been so reliable!

She couldn’t imagine what would have happened if she didn’t have her teacher today!

A powerful half-step celestial was more than enough for dozens of third-circle warlocks to fight against. However, he was only able to withstand one move from Herman. They didn’t even see what trick he used.

However, this was no longer important!

At this time, after more than ten seconds of falling, Klay also fell to the ground with a plop.

It might have been a coincidence, but it fell right in front of John, the two circle Warlock.

He had been completely engrossed in the battle when he suddenly heard a plop.

...

He turned around and saw that it was on the ground.

Klay’s body fell to the ground, creating a small pit. His body, on the other hand, was not breathing.

“Klay is dead!”

John opened his mouth wide and shouted.

The people around him also confirmed that Klay was dead.

The news of Klay’s death spread throughout the battlefield in the blink of an eye.

The originally noisy battlefield suddenly stopped.

At first, many people still had one hope in their hearts, which was that Klay had only been beaten down and not dead. But at this moment, everyone’s heart collapsed.

They were no match for the bloodline tower, to begin with.

In the end, Klay appeared and gave them a glimmer of hope.

However, Herman’s appearance shattered their hope again in just a few seconds.

There was no greater sorrow and joy than this.

At this moment, not far away, Vivika, who had confirmed that Klay was dead, also took a deep breath.

“Klay is dead!”

“Surrender, and we won’t kill!”

Her voice echoed throughout the battlefield.

Bang! Bang!

A Warlock’s weapon fell from his hand, then the second, the third …

In an instant, the holy tower’s desire to fight dropped to the extreme.

Shouts of surrender echoed throughout the battlefield, and most of the warlocks of the Holy tower gave up on resisting.

The remaining warlocks loyal to the Holy tower looked at their surrendered comrades, gritted their teeth, and closed their eyes. The next second, they chose to commit suicide!

The surrendered warlocks knelt on the ground and looked at them, their heads even lower!

Compared to these ordinary warlocks, the third circle warlocks immediately tried to escape. However, after running for a few hundred meters, they found that the endless shadows had already reached them.

Herman!

They closed their eyes in despair, and the next second, the shadow drowned them.

The remaining Wizards sighed and surrendered when they saw the third circle warlocks were covered by the shadow.

In the corner of the battlefield.

It was still Woox and Nikola.

Nikola smiled and looked at Woox. “Woox, what is your choice?”

“My choice?”

Woox turned his head to look at the battlefield and then at the Holy tower in the distance. That was the place where he grew up, but today, everything was over. Everything was gone.

He shook his head with endless sadness and reluctance in his eyes, but then he became determined. He looked at Nikola and said, “You’ve won this time!”

The next second, the flame entered his body.

In the blink of an eye, Woox chose to burn himself without any hesitation.

Nikola’s mouth twitched as he looked at the ashes.

He still wanted to devour the soul of this Warlock.

What a waste!
