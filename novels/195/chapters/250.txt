251 Jin Huan Visits

The war started earlier than Eli had imagined.

Three days later, the heart of the darkness started a war. The two forces began a small-scale battle, and for a time, the entire West Coast changed.

It was also at this time that the small forces finally began to realize that something was wrong.

What about the West Coast treaty?

Wasn’t war not allowed? Why did the two largest forces start a war just like that? This was too sudden, wasn’t it? even so, they reacted very quickly.

They quickly chose their positions.

Of course, there were still some forces who were still observing and did not dare to act rashly.

The atmosphere in the bloodline tower was also rather heavy, but Eli was currently very happy.

In the wizard Tower.

Vivika and Eli were sitting on one side, while an old man was sitting on the other.

“Manager Jin Huan, long time no see!” Eli stood up and shook hands with Jin Huan.

“Hahaha, indeed.” Jin Huan also stood up and shook hands. He laughed even though the last time they met was less than a week ago.

Vivika felt a little strange as she watched the lively scene.

This morning, she had been dealing with some matters when someone suddenly reported that a store manager from the Golden cicada Chamber of Commerce had arrived and requested to meet her.

Vivika was very surprised at that time because they didn’t have any contact with the Golden cicada Chamber of Commerce, and the store manager’s status was already very high. Why would he come to see her?

The only connection seemed to be the recent changes. Although she couldn’t figure it out, she still agreed and finally met with the Golden Toad Chamber of Commerce’s senior management. Jin Huan.

However, to her surprise, he was not here to see her, but to see her teacher.

“master Herman, I’m here to give you something.”

After shaking hands, the two of them sat down with a smile.

“Oh?”

“It’s the materials you need. I’ve brought them for you.” Jin Huan smiled as he took out a bloodline ring and handed it to Eli.

Eli caught it. The ring had yet to recognize an owner, so it could be opened directly.

He opened it.

The space in the ring wasn’t big, only seven or eight cubic meters, and was considered a small ring. Right now, the ring was filled with materials, and other than the magic plants that Eli had ordered in advance the last time, there were also many other precious magic plants.

Even the materials that he had ordered were many times more than what he had ordered.

“Mr. Jin Huan, I didn’t ask for that much, did I?” Eli frowned.

A 3rd circle magic plant was not a joke. Not only were they few in number, but they were also very expensive!

It would probably cost at least 100000 magic stones. Moreover, this was only the money for the materials of the magical plants. The transportation and the cost of the collection had not been included.

This was not a small number to him.

“These are all for you!” Jin Huan smiled.

Eli was speechless.

Vivika was speechless.

Eli was dumbfounded. A magic plant worth 100000 magic stones was given to him just like that? Was this a joke? Aren’t you a Chamber of Commerce? This was not very businesslike!

Vivika was also dumbfounded. So many magic stones meant that her teacher had stronger connections with the Golden cicada Chamber of Commerce than she had imagined. But when did her teacher have a relationship with the Golden cicada Chamber of Commerce?

She looked at Eli.

“If there’s anything you need, you can just tell me directly. There’s no need to do this. I’m at ease doing things for money, but this …” After hesitating for a moment, Eli put down the ring.

Money was really nothing to him! Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“Hahaha, you’ve misunderstood. This is for you. The president asked me to give this to you!” Jin Huan laughed.

“President?” Eli frowned. The president Jin Huan was talking about was probably the president of the cicada Chamber of Commerce, the person in charge of the West Coast branch. But he didn’t know this person!

Were they in contact?

No… wait!

Eli’s thoughts jumped, and after a few seconds, he said with uncertainty, “Could it be Jin Ji?”

Jin Huan nodded. “Mr. Eli, you’re right. Our President took Jinji as his student. After learning that you saved Jinji, the president asked me to give these to you!

“Oh, right, there’s also this!” As if he had thought of something, he took out a token with two golden cicadas carved on it, exuding an extraordinary aura, and placed it on the table.

“This is the Golden cicada token of our Golden cicada Chamber of Commerce. This one is at the second circle level. With this token, you can enjoy a 20% discount at any of the Golden cicada Chamber of Commerce. It’s also a gift from my Lord.”

Looking at the ring and the token, Eli took a deep breath.

“A 20% discount was undoubtedly a very big discount, but it was just to save Jin Ji. Wasn’t that too much?”

“haha, Lord Jin Ji is very talented. Even the president has never seen someone so compatible with the Golden cicada’s bloodline. The president has even reported to the headquarters that once Lord Jin Ji reaches the central mainland, he will be able to give Lord Jin Ji a spot in the Golden cicada clan!” As Jin Huan spoke, his eyes were filled with envy.

“Golden cicada clan?” Eli asked.

On the other side, Vivika had already covered her mouth in disbelief.

“Teacher, I’ve learned a little about the Golden cicada Chamber of Commerce. I know that the system of the Golden cicada Chamber of Commerce is completely different from that of ordinary Chambers of Commerce.

“The outside was the Chamber of Commerce, and the inside was the true backbone of the force.

“There’s also another hierarchy inside, the Golden cicada sequence. It’s said that every one of them is a true genius with outstanding talent. The chairman of the Golden cicada Chamber of Commerce will be born from there!”

“F * ck!”

...

Eli had underestimated the horror of those who were blessed by fate.

“Haha, now you two understand why I’m here, right? Since I’ve delivered the items, I’ll take my leave,” Jin Huan stood up and said.

“Alright!”

Eli and Vivika stood up and shook hands.

Jin Huan didn’t waste any time and bid him farewell.

Soon, only Eli and Vivika were left in the room.

Eli picked up the ring and token.

Now that he knew the reason, he wouldn’t feel bad about keeping it. However, he didn’t expect that kid to have such talent and luck.

It seemed that the return on this investment might be much greater than he had imagined.

Moreover, the magical plant was here, so he could prepare to make potions and breakthrough.

He was only at the initial stage, but he had almost reached the limit of the later stage. He was very curious about how many times his perception of the external elements would improve after this breakthrough!

...

Just as Eli was thinking …

Suddenly, a faint voice sounded from the side. Eli turned his head and saw Vivika looking at him with a bitter expression.

“Teacher, who is this Jin Ji?”

Eli smiled.

Little Vivika was jealous.

..

Half a month passed in the blink of an eye.

The heart of darkness and the Holy tower’s probing was still not over.

However, Eli was already prepared to brew the medicine.

In the laboratory.

Eli looked at the many precious herbs in front of him and took a deep breath.

Jin Huan had given him a total of seven to eight potions, so Eli wasn’t too worried about the problem of materials this time. Besides, his level was enough to concoct potions of this level.

As long as he was careful, there shouldn’t be any major problems.

“Begin!”

Immediately, Eli’s hands began to move, processing the potions.

His hundreds of years of experience allowed his hands to move quickly. He cleaned up the ingredients one by one and then came to the complicated and difficult brewing process.

At this point, Eli was also very cautious.

He began to go all out.

A day later.

“I’ve succeeded!”

In the laboratory, Eli looked at the bottle of green potion in his hand and smiled. This bottle of potion was once very precious even in the mage world, and it was even more precious now because there were fewer and fewer people who could make it.

“But it’s not enough, I need a few more bottles.”

Eli thought for a moment. He had used several bottles when he broke through back then, and this bottle might not be enough. It was better to have a few more bottles to stabilize himself and prevent any accidents.

After all, if something went wrong during his breakthrough, even if he were in good condition, he would at least suffer some damage to his mental power. It was fine during normal times, but now was a special time, and he had to maintain his combat power at all times.

With that in mind, Eli went back into the laboratory.

In another two days, the potions should be almost finished.

Then, he would be able to break through.

..

At the same time.

He was on a venom Wyvern, trying to determine the direction.

It was Noah, but he did not seem to be in a good mood.

“If I didn’t run into the warlock from the Holy tower, I would have been in the bloodline tower’s territory.” Noah cursed.

He was quite unlucky. He had set off from the heart of darkness more than a week ago and went all the way South. He entered a mountain range, but he didn’t expect to get lost and run directly into the Holy tower. Fortunately, he didn’t attract too much attention, but even so, he still got into a lot of trouble. He only left the Holy tower’s attack yesterday.

“However, after leaving the mountain range, I won’t get lost this time.

“I can definitely make it in three days!”

Noah grinned, revealing his white teeth, and licked his lips.

“Vivika, the leader of a force, should have a different taste.”

The venom Wyvern beneath him let out a roar and accelerated!
