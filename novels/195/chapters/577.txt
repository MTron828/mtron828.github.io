578 Surveillance of the World

Entering the mage tower again, Eli was still shocked.

After passing through the Ring of Star Fury, he saw the main body of the Mage Tower.

However, the mage Tower was much livelier than before. The dwarves were all over the world, and other foreign helpers also acted as the hub. There were millions of them.

Of course, this was still far from enough for the repair work of the tower.

“Maybe I shall share my mage technique with some people. I’ll be able to provide talents to repair the Mage Tower!” As Eli pondered, he had already decided on the future direction of the world.

Of course, this was not today’s mission. He was here to check out the surveillance system.

Thinking of this, he judged the direction and looked at the tower in the center.

He took a step forward and opened his eyes again. He had already arrived in front of the Central Tower.

In front of the tower, two mechanical puppets stood guard, looking at Eli with a glint in their eyes.

“Eli, the owner of the highest authority in the Mage Tower, permission granted!”

The two mechanical figures opened up the path, and Eli walked inside.

Soon, they arrived at the space where they had been last time. Dylan was there.

“Sir, you’re here.” Dylan turned his head happily when he heard the voice.

“Yes!”

Eli nodded and glanced at Dylan.

Dylan’s strength had also become stronger through continuous transformation. At this time, he had already crossed the level of the fifth circle, and his strength was almost at the level of a divine tree!

“I heard you say that the repair was successful. I came in to take a look.” Eli nodded.

“As expected, Milord is here to monitor the system.” Dylan chuckled and pointed at one of the screens.

On the screen, there was a huge mechanical eye that was thousands of meters tall. Countless mechanical tentacles were circling above it, but in the center was a real eyeball. It was gray, but it seemed to be able to detect everything.

” That is the eye of a seventh-circle ruler. My teacher had once exchanged it and installed it on the Mage Tower. This is also the origin of the surveillance system. Moreover, it has been mechanically strengthened, so its observation ability is even stronger. Moreover, it has the power of a ruler. No creature can escape his eyes. Even a seventh circle ruler can be discovered as long as they are not deliberately hidden.” Dylan introduced.

“Then can you observe how many powerful creatures there are in the Warlock World and monitor their locations?” Eli asked curiously.

“Of course.” Dylan smiled. He pressed a button to the side, and a mechanical ball rose from the console.

“Sir, this is the control panel. As long as you connect your mental power to it, you will be able to see from the ‘eye’ and observe the nearby world!” Dylan said.

“Oh?”

Eli’s eyes lit up.

He connected with his mental power. He felt his mental power moving along the machine. Then, an inexplicable aura connected with him. He knew that it was the ” eye.”

It was hard to describe that feeling.

Although it was already dead, Eli could still feel the power in the eyeball. It was beyond the power of a living creature and was extremely terrifying.

Of course, Eli only managed to comprehend it for a moment before he was enlightened by the new perspective.

How should he put it? It was still an eye, just like the vision of the Silver Eye, but there were also some differences.

Firstly, he had eyes. He could see through space and see through all disguises, especially those below the seventh circle. Furthermore, his field of vision was extremely wide. At the very least, he could directly see the Warlock World, which was surrounded by world fragments that were like stars.

At this moment, Eli also realized.

This world fragment wasn’t simply distributed. It was intentional.

A large number of World Fragments were arranged in a regular pattern, like a huge spell formation, wrapping around the Warlock World and hiding it.

“I see. I was wondering how mere world fragments could shield the warlock world,” Eli was shocked.

He had never thought that a world could be used as the core of a spell formation.

What was interesting was that he discovered that the time fragment core he had devoured earlier was one of the cores which caused a certain degree of damage to the entire formation.

“Damn it, looks like I have to repair it later. Otherwise, it won’t be good if there’s trouble!” The corner of Eli’s mouth twitched.

Did he have a substitute material?

There really was.

“When the time comes, I’ll use the black crystal I obtained earlier as a replacement.” Eli shook his head, but he did not feel that it was a pity.

Fortunately, he still had time.

However, he did not forget the purpose of his visit this time. He changed his direction and looked directly at the warlock world. More accurately, he looked at the ocean.

The endless deep sea suddenly appeared clearly in front of Eli’s eyes. If he wanted to, he could see any corner of it. This was only the ordinary perspective of the Seventh Circle Eye.

“Is this the power of a seventh-circle creature?” Eli was shocked and decided to hurry up!

His vision swept across the ocean.

The ocean’s appearance changed once again, and a map appeared in front of Eli’s eyes. It included every inch of the seabed, every creature, every emperor, and even the aura of every person.

After a round, Eli had completed his goal. Of course, he had also confirmed a very important question.

“That is, there is no sixth circle in the sea race!” Eli smiled.

The judgment this time could be said to be crucial. The former confirmed the location of the source of the chaos of the Sea Tribe, while the latter confirmed his safety in the deep sea.

“Next, I just need to find them one by one and kill the higher-ups. Then, I can support Poseidon to become the ruler of the Sea Tribe and secretly control the Sea Tribe.”

Eli thought of a simple plan and felt that it was completely feasible.

The only difficulty in this plan was to kill all the higher-ups, but now this difficulty had disappeared.

“That’s it!”

He decided.

“Oh, right. Sir, you can leave a clone here and observe it directly!” Dylan suggested.

“Good idea.” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Eli nodded in agreement.

His goal had been achieved. Eli relaxed and began to observe the progress of the repair. He found that other than the surveillance system, the communication system was close to being repaired, but there was still a small part left. As for the rest, the progress was slow.

“It’s okay. Keep up the good work.”

He encouraged the staff and left the Mage Tower.

When he returned, he found that Alida was already waiting at the entrance of the valley.

“What happened?” Eli thought for a moment and allowed Alida to enter.

Very quickly, Alida told Ell about what had happened in the past few days. As expected, almost all the coastal areas of the continent had been attacked by the Seafolk, and the flames of war had spread throughout the entire world.

“Don’t worry. I’ll settle everything in three days.”

Eli told her.

“Yes, sir!”

Alida nodded, but she couldn’t help but look puzzled.

Solved?

How to solve it?
