510 Miya in Tears, Azak in Fury

A day later.

In a room in the Mage Tower, Miya was lying on a bed. Dylan, Nikola, and Hydra were standing not far away.

“It’s Udo’s daughter. Time really flies. In the blink of an eye, his daughter is already half a step into the fifth circle.” Nikola sighed deeply.

“Indeed.”

Eli nodded.

He didn’t expect to meet Udo’s daughter like this. After all, although he had promised Udo, he didn’t expect to meet her for real.

“Master has already treated her, so she should wake up soon. But Master Eli, when did you break through?” Dylan looked at Eli.

Hearing this, Nikola also showed a curious expression.

He was already in a desperate situation, but he did not expect Eli to break through to the fifth circle without a sound and easily kill a fifth-circle assassin. It was simply ridiculous!

“Oh, not too long ago. I broke through by luck. Let’s not talk about this. I just broke through to the fifth circle, and I’m still at the bottom of the fifth circle!” Eli instructed the two.

“The lowest level?”

The corners of their mouths twitched, but they did not say anything!

Because this was a very Eli thing to do.

” Miya woke up.” Suddenly, Dylan said.

Everyone looked over. Miya had opened her eyes.

..

It hurt!

Miya opened her eyes with difficulty. She looked around.

In an unfamiliar room, there was Eli, the spirit, and the mechanical dog.

Oh, she was being hunted down and was saved by Eli!

As she thought about it, she immediately got up, but her cheeks were a little red because her original clothes had long disappeared without a trace. A loose wizard robe was worn on her.

“Your Warlock robe is seriously damaged. I got someone to change it for you!” Eli walked over and said.

Seeing Eli, Miya immediately got up and thanked him, “Thank you, sir, for saving my life!”

“It’s alright,” Eli replied with a smile, his eyes kind.

Looking at Miya made him feel like he was looking at a junior.

Back then, Udo was one of his subordinates and had helped him a little.

Feeling the kind gaze of Eli, the corners of Miya’s mouth twitched, but she seemed to remember something. She asked cautiously, “Sir Eli, can I ask you a question?”

“Ask away!” Eli nodded.

After experiencing such a baffling rescue, it would be strange if she denied him.

Miya’s throat moved slightly. She looked into Eli’s eyes and asked, “Sir, may I ask why you saved my life?”

Miya was extremely confused.

“Oh, I promised your father that I would help you if I met you in the future,” Eli replied with a smile.

“Yeah, I still remember how that guy came back in a sorry state!” Nikola laughed loudly as if he had thought of something interesting. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“My father?”

Miya was stunned. She had thought of many possibilities, but she had never thought of this one. Her eyes sparkled.

“That’s right. I told that guy Udo not to go to the Central Region.” Nikola clicked his tongue.

“My father, Udo.” This time, Miya was certain. She looked at Eli as if she remembered the origin of this lord. He seemed to be from the West Coast.

So, this person in front of him was actually the lord that his father had mentioned!

Her father had already left the Western Regions, but he still cared for her in this way.

Instantly, countless tears filled Miya’s eyes. The longing for her father and the pain in her heart burst out like an ocean.

Drip! Drip!

Tears soaked the blanket. The leader of the continent’s famous assassin organization, Miya, exploded in emotions and cried.

“Father!”

Miya left a week later.

At this moment, she had fully recovered from her injuries. Eli also told her about the Hamis family.

Before she left, she lowered her head and thanked him, “Sir, I won’t forget your kindness, but if I’m not around, the organization will be in chaos. Moreover, the higher-ups of the Grim Reaper were killed by you, so I will return to take over their organization!

“When everything is over, I will return to join My Lord’s army and repay you for saving my life!

“When the time comes, even if you want to attack the Hamis family, I will definitely stand on your side. Even if I can’t help you, in terms of intelligence, our two assassin organizations are at the top.

“And I won’t tell anyone about my lord, I swear on my bloodline!!”

After that, Miya left, and Eli didn’t stop her.

Of course, Eli was also interested in her development.

Ever since his influence had grown, he might even have come into contact with the Central Region. However, he was not so clear about the news in the Central Region. Although the Charm Mansion was not bad, they were actually just an ordinary force in the Central Region. They did not have a fifth circle existence. Of course, the Golden Cicada Merchant Association was stronger. That president might have reached the fifth circle.

It would be a good thing for him if he could get more information from the two assassin organizations.

As for the other part, Eli didn’t take it seriously. Miya might have guessed that he was Herman, but so what? He could just make up a story!

“However, I’m afraid the Hamis family won’t stop!”

Eli sighed. He knew that something was going to happen next.

The only thing that worried him was that he still did not understand why the Hamis family had asked the Grim Reaper to take action. However, since they had hired a fifth-circle assassin, they were destined to be enemies.

“Of course, we have to crush our enemies!”

Eli returned to the mage tower. He decided to build a space passage between this place and the time world fragment to facilitate future rebellions and avoid such a thing from happening again.

..

“What? The Death Mandala’s Miya returned alive and annexed the Grim Reaper at an extremely fast speed?”

Azak jumped up from his chair in shock.

In front of him, the two Warlocks still covered their bodies. They lowered their heads and said, “Yes, Milord. The Grim Reaper hasn’t shown himself. In fact, we haven’t received any news from them since they entered the Western Regions half a month ago.

” Their whereabouts have completely disappeared. The ones who appeared were the four people from the organization. They appeared on the outskirts of a mountain range, but they never appeared again after entering the mountain range. Miya returned to the Death Mandala Flower a week later. As for Death, he never appeared again. We suspect that he’s already dead.”

“This…”

Hamis’s face twitched, and his eyes widened.

“How is this possible?” He couldn’t believe it.

A fifth circle Death couldn’t have disappeared for no reason, and it was impossible for Miya to have no reaction to his Hand. However, wasn’t death too ridiculous?

“It can’t be Eli, right?” At this time, another Warlock who had not spoken up reminded him.

“That’s impossible.” Azak denied it directly.

“Sir, don’t forget the fifth circle fluctuation that appeared ten years ago. Moreover, Ely was also at the peak of the fourth circle before!”The Warlock suggested another possibility.

Silence!

This time, Azak was silenced because, according to the Warlock, this was completely possible!

However, when he thought of Eli being at the fifth circle, he still felt that something was wrong!

As more and more clues were gathered, they were more and more certain that Elo had important clues about the Gray Wizard Tower. It might even be the location or the key. It was impossible for such things to fall into the hands of others.

“Indeed, we can’t underestimate him this time!” A hint of caution flashed across his eyes.

“However, it is impossible to give the Gray Wizard Tower to him. If he really has it, then it will be a big problem for us. Moreover, we can still hide it now, but what about later? If other families find out, our family will definitely not be able to get it!” Azak gritted his teeth.

Although the Warlock Union had six families, there was a power hierarchy inside it. Three families were weaker than the other three.

If they could obtain the Magus Tower, they might be able to directly resolve this issue and become the number one family. They might even be able to control the Warlock World, as the legends said.

Thinking of this, his expression became serious.

After a few seconds of silence, he looked at the two of them and said, “Send someone out to spread the word that Eli and Roland are colluding to fool the Warlock Union. When the time comes, I’ll take the initiative to propose to the Union that Hamis destroy the Bloodline Tower and then divide up the forces in the Western Region. They’ll definitely agree!”

“Yes, sir!”

The two nodded and left quickly.

After the two left, Azak sat back in his chair.

“If we assume that Eli is at the fifth circle and has the strength to defeat the Grim Reaper, then we should at least send out a fifth circle Warlock.

“So what if you’ve broken through to the fifth circle? There are some things that you can’t protect!”

Azak gritted his teeth and revealed a cruel smile.
