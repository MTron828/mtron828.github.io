333 The Level of Stars

Udo’s return and death were interludes in Eli’s life.

After that, he resumed his daily life.

Normally, Eli would explore new spells, especially advanced elemental spells.

As time went on, he was able to create new elemental spells every few years. The quality was definitely not that high, but it basically covered the basis.

Maybe it was because he had nothing to do.

Eli started to record everything that happened.

In short, he started to write in his diary again.

..

New calendar year 4031. This is the first year I have lived on Mercury Island. I started writing my diary in the year 4041.

Year 4045.

This year, the expanded marine supervision Department expanded rapidly with Nikola’s help and began to explore the resources around the ocean and take inventory of the creatures here.

In the end, they found a gold patterned stone mine not far from the ocean. It was a precious rare metal with malleability and plasticity and was often used to make large-scale mage weapons.

I was also very interested. A large amount of gold pattern stone ore was sent to Mercury Island, so I gathered a large number of resources and then made a flying device for myself based on the void stone I once obtained from the killer whale. It’s a third peak circle flying device.

Doggo also benefited from this. Many ores were integrated into his body, and his strength finally reached the third circle.

Year 4060.

On the West Coast, another new race had arrived. The Moli Nagas were a type of sea creature with a slender head but a snake-like body.

After they arrived, they wanted to invade this place.

That day, I tried out a large fireball spell that I had recently created. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

The 100-meter high-compressed fireball fell into the ocean and instantly turned into endless steam. More than 300 of the Moli Naga tribe were burned to ashes. Even the surrounding seawater was boiling for a few hours.

This year, I finally had two celestial stars.

..

Year 4075.

The Marlin had arrived, and they had three half-step celestial creatures.

They’re very fast, and just like the previous tribes, they’re cruel and murderous. It’s already affecting the resource department’s ocean resource collection. I’m testing my latest 4th-circle spell, the sea of lightning. When the lightning covers the surface of the sea, they have nowhere to escape.

This time, my bloodline curse has finally reached 0.5%.

Now, I have three celestial stars.

..

Time passed by faster and faster.

By the time Eli came back to his senses, he had realized that it was already year 4298.

Two hundred and fifty years had passed.

In the Tower, Eli sat by the window, looking at the boundless sea level outside the Mage Tower. He looked down, and there was a thick diary in his hand.

Even if he only wrote once in a while, two hundred years would be enough for him to write a thick book, and after that, it was even possible for Eli to write once every few years.

“It’s been two hundred and fifty years!” Eli flipped open the diary and was filled with emotions.

Eli flipped through the diary.

Year 4100.

The four units of celestial stars were all fine.

Year 4110.

There were 10000 koutao sahagins of the sea, none of whom were celestial level. A single Whirlpool was enough to resolve the situation. The curse had reached 0.8%, getting closer and closer to 1%.

Year 4120.

No invasion. Reached five celestial stars.

Year 4130.

It was the first time I had seen the invasion of the batfish race, and it was very novel. Thus, I left behind some to dissect to gain a better understanding of marine life.

The bloodline curse had finally reached 1%.

Year 4135.

Jin Ji sent me a letter and told me that he had become the person in charge of a region of the Golden Toad Chamber of Commerce in the Western Region, and the area was several times larger than the West Coast. I was very surprised, but I was happy for him. After all, that would be a great help for me in the future.

Hehe, isn’t it a little inappropriate to say that? anyway, no one would read this diary.

I hope he’ll become more and more powerful.

Year 4140.

Jin Ji wrote to me again, telling me that he had encountered a lot of trouble, and I replied to him.

At this point, I have 6 celestial stars and 1.2% curse rate.

Year 4160.

The oceanic race and the demon Vulture race had arrived. There was a celestial among them. I killed him. I didn’t expect the curse actually to reach 3%. It seemed that I had underestimated these ocean races.

Not bad.

Year 4180.

...

The Sawtooth shark clan of the sea clan has invaded.

Year 4190.

A fourth-circle flame giant dragon flew by, but I didn’t kill him. I took some of his blood and let him go.

Year 4220.

10 celestial stars, curse Rate 4%.

Year 4235.

The sea spider race has invaded. There are many of them. No celestial. Kill. Curse has reached 5%.

Year 4237.

The giant demonic turtle race has invaded.

Year 4245.

Moonlight ocean elves have invaded. Kill!

...

Year 4260.

The Sea Monkey race has invaded.

Upon seeing this, Eli’s reading speed increased.

After that, there would be a batch of invading races every few years, and during this process, Eli accumulated more and more celestial stars, and the power of his curse became stronger and stronger.

A few seconds later, Eli closed the diary and felt the fifteen units of celestial stars in his body. According to the laws of mages, he had already stepped into the cluster star level.

The micro star realm has 1-15 units of celestial stars, the cluster star realm has 15-45 units, and the Nebula realm has 45-100 units.

Of course, the rate of growth in the later stages of this process would increase with the accumulation of celestial star units, but it was conceivable that the gap between each level would be much larger than before.

But at least he was already a star-ranked wizard.

Compared to two hundred years ago, he was much stronger. If it was a celestial like Gaido, he could easily kill him.

“The stars aren’t enough. I need to be at least at the radiant moon level to go to the central continent.” Eli looked at the scenery outside the window and pondered.

There were definitely many experts in the central continent, so he had to be more careful.

At this time, his bonus damage to the sea creatures had reached 30%. Here, his safety and security were higher.

“Let’s continue like this.”

Eli got up from the window and stretched his body.

At this moment, there was a sudden clapping sound outside the door.

Upon hearing the knock, Eli turned his head in confusion, especially after sensing the person outside the door.

“Come in.”

The door opened, and Nikola floated in.

“Nikola, you haven’t looked for me in a long time, but you look good.” Eli looked at him and greeted him.

“That’s right, long time no see, my Lord!” Nikola humbly lowered his head.

He was still at the limit of the third circle, but his aura was much better than before.

“So what happened for you to come to find me? ” Eli asked.

“My Lord, something has happened on the West Coast recently,” Nikola said in a deep voice.

“Oh?”

“A week ago, a celestial Warlock came to the West Coast. Under his leadership, a new organization was quickly established, and he demanded the bloodline tower to submit to him!” Nikola said.

Eli was speechless.

‘Are they looking down on me?’

“Where’s Aisha? Why didn’t she inform me of such an important matter?” Eli looked at Nikola.

“Aisha has been injured by the true spirit and has fallen unconscious.” Nikola sighed.

“What about the others?” Eli frowned. He really did not know about this.

“Sir, you haven’t shown your face for more than two hundred years.” Nikola looked at Eli and said.

“Alright, I understand!”

Eli nodded. It had been too long since he had shown his face, and he had been forgotten!

He came to the window again, his eyes flashing with silver light.

In the silver light, his vision passed through space. A few seconds later, he saw a Mage tower and an unfamiliar Warlock in the Mage tower.

This was the celestial he was looking for!

A celestial at the micro-star level.

It was time for him to show his face.

Thinking of this, he walked outside, and Nikola behind him showed a happy expression.

His master was finally returning to the world.
