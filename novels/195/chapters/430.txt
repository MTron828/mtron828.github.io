431 Spatial Teleportation

In the distance, Eli stood in front of the experiment table and looked at himself not far away. He smiled and asked, “Are you ready?”

“I’m ready!”

Eli entertained himself for a moment before activating the device!

At the same time, part of Eli’s consciousness was transferred to the clone!

!!

As soon as he moved, Eli was instantly illuminated by the light from the spell formation. Eli quickly cast a spell and everything returned to normal!

As soon as he raised his head, he could see the main body not far away, smiling at him. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

This feeling of looking at oneself was quite strange, but Eli only glanced at it, and his attention returned to the spell formation!

Eli also had a strange feeling. He felt like he was still in this layer of space, but at the same time, he didn’t feel like he was there!

Of course, this was just a passing observation. At this moment, all his attention was still on the rune.

Eli felt completely different when he was inside. The runes in front of him were naked, allowing Eli to admire them. Every detail could be seen clearly, and Eli’s understanding of spell formations also rapidly improved.

He no longer had any doubts about this spell formation. As long as he was given some time, he should be able to inscribe it!

After achieving his goal, Eli realized what he was about to face.

” Spatial Teleportation! ”

Eli’s throat moved slightly. In the next second, Eli heard a sound like a bubble that was about to burst. Then, he felt the space in front of him crackle!

Boom!

A white light burst out, and Eli disappeared from the laboratory in an instant, entering an unknown space.

Countless spaces swirled in the void, emitting various colors. Eli was like a stream of light that shuttled through it. Among them, many Behemoths in the void looked at the stream of light. Before they could react, the stream of light had already disappeared from their eyes.

Eli, who was inside the stream of light, forced his eyes open and observed his surroundings. He did not lose contact, which meant that he was still in an area that his main body could contact.

He knew exactly where he was now. He was in the space turbulence. It was filled with all kinds of dangers. If he was unlucky, he might even encounter a powerful creature by chance.

Of course, he could also feel the sharp spatial elements here. These powers were rapidly wearing down the power of faith of this clone, so he had to get out quickly.

“Let’s go out while we can still contact each other.”

Eli gritted his teeth and crashed into a spatial hole not far away, then plunged into the real world!

Whoosh! Whoosh!

Eli finally left the spatial turbulence and entered the real world.

“The connection is still there, which means that the distance is still acceptable!” Eli was deep in thought!

It took him a few seconds to recover. Then, he raised his head and opened his eyes to look around.

“Why am I here?”

Eli’s mouth was wide open as he stared blankly at the scene before him!
