306 Conditions

After sending off Collina, Eli temporarily stayed in the Mage Tower.

He returned to the secret realm.

The moment he entered the secret realm, a figure appeared in front of him.

“Eli, when can we go to the central continent?!”

!!

Dylan stood in front of Eli, looking at him with his mechanical eyes, his gaze distant!

Eli was his last hope. He had always wanted to head to the central continent as soon as possible. His main body was in the central continent, and he was desperate to find those things.

But why did he feel like that guy, Eli, didn’t have that intention at all?

“Don’t worry, we’ll be there soon!”

Seeing that it was Dylan who was blocking the way, Eli consoled him.

“I’ll have to wait until I’ve advanced to the celestial realm. After all, the central continent is so dangerous. You don’t want me to die halfway, do you? if that happens, there’ll be no hope at all.”

“Alright then!” Doggo had nothing to say. He ran to a dog house not far away and lay down.

He had heard the same words many times, but he couldn’t do anything.

“That’s the way!” Eli smiled as he passed by.

Further ahead was the area where Hill was.

Tens of meters in the air blocked the sun, and thousands of branches hung down, emitting a lustrous green light. An aura of life was being emitted without reservation.

“You haven’t advanced yet!”

Eli had already forgotten how many times he had said this.

Hill’s advancement to the second circle was much slower than he had expected.

He could only say that he was naive!

He had underestimated Hill.

Upon hearing Eli’s voice, Hill lowered his branch and got closer to him.

Returning Hill’s response, Eli continued walking forward.

Soon, he arrived at the magic medicine field.

This place didn’t change much from before, but there were many rare magical plants. The ordinary ones had been removed by Eli long ago. After all, he didn’t rely on the magical herb field to earn money for him anymore, unless it was a very old and effective one, but those were very rare!

And in the center of this magical herb field was a large patch of blood bamboo flowers.

Although they were no longer of much use to Eli, he still kept them and planted them in a rather large area. It wasn’t that he was nostalgic, but he was curious if he could grow a four-ring blood bamboo flower, and if there would be anything that would surprise him.

Anyway, it’s just a piece of land, it’s not a big deal.

After passing through the area of the blood bamboo flowers, Eli finally arrived at his laboratory and living area.

The structure of the house here was not the same as that of the Mage tower. It even looked a little like the single-story houses of the past. However, this was not important. In front of them was the huge Hydra.

The several dozen-meter-long shadow body was coiled together, with three heads curled up in the body. Although it was only lying there, it gave off a mountain-like feeling.

The reason he was here was to help him guard the laboratory.

Eli walked along the path, and during this period, Hydra raised one of its heads. When it saw that it was Eli, it lowered its head again.

Eli walked all the way into the lab before taking out the spatial ring.

Eli took a deep breath and took out everything from the ring.

There was a crystal ball, a fruit, and a letter.

He opened the envelope first. It was a letter from Jin ji.

In the first half of the letter, other than an introduction of his situation, it was almost the same as what Collina had said, but there were some more details and no mention of the curse.

The second half introduced the items he brought.

The crystal ball contained the information that Eli needed to level up as a mage, as well as the information for a Warlock. The fruit was a precious material called the Comoros fruit. It could increase a mage’s success rate by 5% during the process of leveling up.

“It seems that the person was here to deliver this fruit!”

Eli picked up the fruit. The fruit looked like a pineapple on the outside, emitting a spiral pattern. In essence, it had almost reached the fourth circle, just a little bit off.

If Eli remembered correctly, this was harvested from the fourth-circle magical beast, the Comoros crocodile. They would have this kind of magical plant growing on their heads, and it would only grow once every few hundred years.

The difficulty of collecting it from a four-circle magical beast was self-evident.

Even Jin Ji probably had to pay a huge price.

There was also information about mages and warlocks. It seemed that Jinji had really put in a lot of effort.

After checking the fruit, Eli began to read the information.

It didn’t take long for him to understand what was needed for a celestial to advance and what the difference was between a celestial and a third-circle warlock.

There was only one condition to reach the celestial realm mage.

That was the minimum mental power of 400.

However, this breakthrough process was the most difficult. According to the requirements, mages needed to compress their mental strength to the extreme until it was compressed to the limit. Then, during this process, the power of the celestial would be born.

It was a type of power that was closely related to mental power but had a different type.

This step was the only threshold for advancement. That’s right, advancement was that simple.

However, this step caused countless third-circle mages o fail. On average, only one out of dozens of them would succeed.

Of course, warlocks were similar, but they condensed their bloodline and compressed it to the extreme.

...

It was very interesting.

As for the difference between a celestial and a third circle warlocks were the celestial body and the true bloodline avatar!

A large body formed from the massive amount of celestial force could allow a Magus to burst forth with power tens of times greater than before. The effects could destroy the heavens and the earth, while a bloodline avatar could transform into the bloodline itself and obtain the powerful combat abilities of those creatures.

In short, the moment one reached the level of celestial, there would be a huge change for both Wizards and warlocks. That was why the fourth circle was called celestial and not the fourth circle.

This was because the essence of their power had already changed.

The information given to him by jin ji was about the promotion of both of them, as well as many things to take note of. Eli guessed that it was probably the internal information of the Golden Cicada Chamber of Commerce.

Strictly speaking, Jin Ji had violated the rules and was taking a risk.

This was a good child!

Eli sighed. This was also the reason why he was willing to help him.

“However, I still need to make a lot of preparations to advance!” … Eli pondered.

If a celestial wanted to advance, he had to be well prepared. First of all, jin ji’s Comoros fruit could only help him a little since it was related to the bloodline. But Eli wanted to advance as a mage. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

...

However, for some reason, Eli felt that he might really need to use it. The reason was that when he first advanced to his third circle, a small accident happened, and it couldn’t be ignored.

“I need a large number of soul crystals, higher level soul crystals!”

Other than some commonly used materials, what Eli needed the most right now should be a large number of high-level soul crystals.

And this Eli was planning to obtain it from his soul slaves that he had been raising. There were tens of thousands of magical beasts hidden in the mountains, and there were many of them in the third circle.

Although it was a pity, if it was for his advancement, then it didn’t matter.

“my mental power is 462 points. I estimate that I can reach 470 points. I will need about 15 years before I can level up!” Eli sensed his condition.

Although 500 points were the limit, it was completely a theoretical value and was impossible to reach. Even if it was 470 points of spiritual force, it was already above 99.9% of the Mages!

When he was ready, his mental power should be enough, and he could advance.

Time left no trace, and he had finally reached this stage.
