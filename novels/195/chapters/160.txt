“Even though it was my bloodline that broke through first, my combat strength is still at second-circle.”

In the tower, Eli clenched his fist as if he could feel the power within it. As long as he closed his eyes, he could sense a black-red bloodline core in the depths of his bloodline. That was the condensation of the shadow dragon’s bloodline, and it was also the powerful driving force of ordinary two-circle warlocks.

However… Eli looked towards the blood-colored crystal. At this moment, there was a mysterious rune within the crystal. It looked very illusory. He could sense the power within.

It felt just like David’s ability rune.

However, Eli knew that it was not an ability rune but something else that should not have appeared on his body.

!!

A warlock’s exclusive bloodline talent!

“This is unreasonable…” Eli pursed his lips.

There were only two differences between a mage and a Warlock. One was their lifespan, and the other was their innate talents and spells.

Lifespan didn’t really affect their combat power, but innate talents and spells differentiated the two. Due to the integration of bloodlines, Warlocks would obtain an innate talent at every stage of their bloodline.

Innate spells were much more powerful than ordinary spells because of their high quality. It was also an important reason for mages to become warlocks.

Eli was working hard on the path of the mage but now, he had an innate warlock spell. How was this possible?

Eli sensed deeply and knew that this rune, or rather, this bloodline talent, should be called shadow control. With this, the manipulation and control of shadows were completely different from before. The new shadows were also different from ordinary shadows, as they could carry other powers.

“No, don’t tell me…” Eli pondered.

In the past, mages would break through to become mages before they considered becoming warlocks. However, because of the devouring spell, the path of the warlock had taken the lead for Eli.

Or perhaps, mages could also use warlock spells as long as their bloodline was strong enough.

This discovery was too shocking.

If it was in the past, it would definitely be a discovery that would shock the world, but now, this secret could only be known by Eli himself.

Eli shook his head. With a wave of his hand, a large shadow appeared before him.

However, the shadow now was completely different from before. Not only did it have more textures, but it was also tougher. Even the power contained in it was different from before. In comparison, it was as if the shadow in the past was a youthful version.

“I can only say that it was a freak combination of factors,” Eli exclaimed.

At the same time, there was a knock on the door.

“Come in!”

The door opened, and Tijie walked in. She looked at him in fear because he was emitting a powerful aura. If she was not wrong, it should be the aura of a second-circle warlock.

“Sir Roland has broken through to the second warlock. This is really good news.

“My Lord, you’ve broken through?” Tijie asked carefully.

“Yes.” Eli nodded. He had just broken through, so he was still unable to control his bloodline.

“that’s great. The Lord has advanced, so the camp is safe.” Tijie said excitedly. She then asked, “Then, what are your plans for the camp?”

“From now on, we’ll just do as usual and slowly develop.” yes,” Eli replied.

The order of the camp and him could not be mixed up. It was the camp that supported him, not him supporting the camp. The camp was still too small at the moment. It was best to expand it further.

The cultivation of a second-circle bloodline Warlock was very simple, which was to form a bloodline core. This required a lot of time and blood, so Eli still needed the camp to continue collecting blood for him.

“Yes.” Tijie nodded her head.

“Yes, I’ll be leaving in a few days. You guys have to continue collecting the blood. Oh, and this.” As he spoke, a shadow condensed in his palm. Then, the shadow turned into a small pitch-black ball, and he threw it to Tijie.

“What is this?”

Tijie didn’t understand, but she could feel the power in it.

“This is something I’ve created with my power. It’s called a Shadow Bomb. It can explode with the power of a two-circle warlock. I’ll leave one for you.” Eli said calmly.

“Thank you, my Lord.” Tijie was touched. She swore that even if there were no soul contract, she would never betray Roland.

Of course, Eli didn’t know that a small shadow Bomb could cause such a huge change in Tijie’s mentality. He waved his hand and dispersed her.

For the next week, Eli spent his time in the camp, constantly familiarizing himself with the various means of the power of the bloodline, and the power of the shadow force.

In just a short week, his strength was on a completely different level from before.

Also, with the power of the shadow Dragon bloodline, even an ordinary second-circle warlock like Jesse might not be a match for him. Thinking of this, even Eli was shocked.

The current White Tower had a total of five second-circle rings, including Marcus at the peak of the second circle, Kratos at the late stage of the second circle, Jesse at the early stage, Theron at the middle stage of the second circle, and the newly promoted second circle warlock, and No. 1 Council Member, Clyne.

This breakthrough really changed Eli a lot. His strength had instantly reached the top of the White Tower, and he would be able to do a lot more things in the future.

“However, I can only fight against a Warlock in the early stage of the second circle. I might be able to tie in the middle stage, but I might not be able to win against them in the late stage. If there are a few of them, I’ll be dead. So, I still have to develop in the White Tower quietly.” Eli thought.

This world was too dangerous, so he had to be more careful.

…

Thus, another week passed. Eli returned to the White Tower and continued with his work as usual, as if nothing had happened.

And in the White Tower, no one caused trouble for Eli because he was too low-key and hardly participated in any disputes. However, his potions were only very strong, and many people had to rely on him to concoct potions.

Most importantly, he was only responsible for part of Kratos’ work. He was just an executor with Kratos behind him, so no one dared to touch him or wanted to touch him because it was meaningless.

A top-notch pharmacist was something that every major force lacked.

…

In the blink of an eye, another ten years had passed.

Eli had a subordinate named Rosse, who was in the early stage of the first circle. It was said that he was hauled from the prison of the shadow lizard, but the shadow lizard had passed away a long time ago, and no one cared about his background.

And the White Tower’s forces were also developing steadily, just like the strategy they had set in the beginning.

…

Ten years later.

With the constant efforts of the Mage camp, Eli’s bloodline broke through again, reaching the middle stage of the second circle.

His elemental essence conversion and mental points had also reached 69% and 75 points respectively, getting closer and closer to the second circle. His connections in the White Tower were also increasing, which made him safer.

There were also four more first-circle Mages in the camp, and the number of apprentices in the camp had exceeded 300. Including servants, there were more than 1000 of them, which was considered a big force on the West Coast. There was also Tijie, who had broken through to the late stage of the first circle.

Everything was developing steadily.

However, five years later, something happened that surprised Eli.

Rawls had made great contributions during an out-of-town mission and had broken through to the late stage of the first circle. Coincidentally, the 12th member of Parliament had died. He had also entered the Parliament with Kratos’ help and became a colleague of Eli.

Rawls sighed that he could finally compete with Eli again. On the other hand, Eli regretted having one less worker under him, so he randomly chose Alice to be in charge of the magical plants.

By the way, most of the shadow lizard’s forces were taken over by the White Tower, including the various camps. Alice had joined the White Tower as well, but she was taken in by Eli after she broke through to the first circle.

This was normal. After all, he had been in the White Tower for decades, and he had some people under him.

…

Thus, there was another wave in Eli’s peaceful life. Rawls would come and harass Eli from time to time, but Eli didn’t take it seriously. The two of them played around, being friends and enemies at the same time.

Ten years later, Eli realized that the blood of zero-circle beasts was almost useless to him, and the blood of the first-circle beasts was also much less effective than before.

Another ten years passed.

The blood of zero-circle beasts was completely useless now, and only the blood of zero-circle beasts was of some use. However, the collection of first-circle blood was inevitably very slow, so Eli temporarily stopped his progression.

His elemental essence conversion was already at 73%, and his mental force was at 76 points. Although it was getting higher, progression was getting slower and slower.

On the other hand, his bloodline didn’t change much more than it was ten years ago. Without the blood supply, Eli didn’t spend too much effort either, so naturally, there wouldn’t be too much of a change.

However, there was also good news. In the same year, there was finally a blood bamboo flower that broke through to the second circle under Eli’s cultivation, and it could provide Eli with even higher quality life-boosting potions.

And when Eli sensed these changes and turned around, he realized that forty years had already passed.

He had been on the West Coast for a long time, and he had been in a daze for a long time.

He finally had the strength to protect himself to a certain degree.Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com
