262 Hourglass of Time

The huge airship was floating in the sky. The hatch opened, and a figure flew towards Eli.

“Teacher!”

Vivika came to Eli’s side, her eyes looking around.

There were corpses, dismembered limbs, blood, and flesh everywhere. Wails could be heard, and the terrain was destroyed. A large number of Heart of Darkness warlocks were wrapped in shadows on the ground, unable to move.

!!

She quickly understood what had happened! Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

His teacher had actually crushed the heart of darkness by himself!

There were thousands of them, and there were even dozens of third-circle warlocks among them. They died just like that, and they didn’t even cause any damage to Eli. It felt like a fantasy story.

A day ago, she had been dumbfounded when she received the news from Eli that she had to rush to Silver Moon Lake. After all, a battle was about to break out at Silver Moon Lake. What was Eli going to do?

Now she understood!

Seeing that Vivika had arrived, Eli nodded.

“Long time no see, Udo!”

After the greeting, Vivika looked at Udo.

“Yes, tower master Vivika, long time no see!” Udo lowered his head and nodded. Although the bloodline tower’s strength had always been at the bottom of many forces, no one would dare to look down on this force in the future!

Even if they were really weak, with Eli’s support, no one would dare to touch them.

At this time, all the heart of darkness warlocks were slowly captured by the Holy tower’s side and gathered to the side. They squatted on the ground, waiting for judgment.

“Milord, what should we do with these?” Udo looked at Eli.

“Send them to the prison of the bloodline tower.” Eli glanced at the remaining hundred or so people. There were so many high-quality materials, and he could not let them go.

“Sure!” Udo nodded and looked at Vivika. “I’ll leave these people to tower master Vivika.”

“Yes.” Vivika nodded.

At this moment, the Golden cicada Chamber of Commerce’s airship was also slowly descending.

The door opened.

A Warlock walked out from inside.

He had golden hair and black eyes. His eyes were as deep as the abyss, but he also had the shrewdness of a businessman.

He was wearing a dark gold Warlock robe and had rings on each of his ten fingers. He had two rings, which made him look like a businessman!

“Jin Ji of the Golden Toad Chamber of Commerce!”

Looking at the person who came, Eli and Vivika didn’t have any reaction, but Udo’s mouth was already wide open.

Everyone knew that the Golden Toad Chamber of Commerce’s West Coast had produced a genius, Jin Ji, who had a compatible Golden cicada bloodline. He was accepted as a disciple by Jin Yin, who had reached the limit of third circle. He also had the opportunity to go to the central continent. His future was bright.

But why would he be here?

It could be said that although he was only in the second circle, his status was something that even the leaders of the various forces did not dare to look down on. After all, the Golden cicada Chamber of Commerce was powerful in the central mainland!

Could it be … ‘Eli?

He fell silent, then watched as Jin Ji slowly approached Eli.

“Sir, I haven’t seen you for decades. I wonder if you’re well!” With a smile, Jin Ji lowered his head and extended his hand respectfully.

“Everything is fine!”

Eli smiled.

Jin Ji was no longer the teller he used to be. He was a genius with a bright future!

“My Lord, may I know why you’ve summoned me this time?” Jin Ji was puzzled.

He was dealing with an important matter, but he suddenly received news from Eli, so he stopped everything and came here. He wanted to know what exactly happened.

“Fishing!” Eli said!

“Fishing?”

Jin Ji blinked his eyes.

..

“Hu Hu!”

Simona had already transformed into a bloodline creature, and her harpy wings had already flapped as she flew into the distance.

“He’s too strong!”

Simona shivered as she recalled the scene she had just seen.

She finally understood why she felt so uneasy.

If she had really been there, she would probably be dead by now.

Fortunately, she had run away in advance and saved her little life.

“Let’s hurry back.” She shook her head and increased her speed.

However, after flying for a while, she suddenly stopped.

“Wait a moment!” Simona touched her chin, one hand on her chest, and fell into deep thought.

It didn’t seem right for her to run back alone after the heart of darkness’s allied army was annihilated. What if Sergei flew into a rage and tore off her skull?

It seemed like she couldn’t go to the heart of darkness and even the Harpy school.

Then where was she going?

...

For a moment, she was actually a little lost!

After a while, she seemed to have understood something and immediately changed her direction.

Instead of returning to the heart of darkness, she might as well join the bloodline family. They probably wouldn’t reject a third-circle warlock’s offer.

..

Three days passed by in a flash.

The people of the Holy tower had already evacuated, and the warlocks of the bloodline tower had already occupied Silvermoon town and the surrounding areas, putting up the symbol of the bloodline tower.

Speaking of which, this place used to be the venue for the meetings of many forces. It was almost dependent on five or six forces, and the house of the bloodline was one of them.

As Jin Ji left on the airship, everything seemed to have come to an end.

“Four!”

This time, Eli looked at the four fish in his hands and smiled in satisfaction.

He still had to rely on Jin Ji for this kind of thing.

...

However, this might be the last time. Jin Ji told him that he would leave the West Coast in the next few decades and head to the Golden Cicada Chamber of Commerce in the central continent.

He even invited Eli to go with him, but naturally, he was rejected by him.

What a joke.

It had not been easy for him to become so strong on the West Coast, and now he was going to be beaten up on a high-level map?! Not to mention anything else, at least Eli had to reach the celestial realm first.

In any case, he would never go to the central continent before he ascended to the celestial realm.

It was too dangerous.

After watching Jin ji leave, Vivika came to Eli’s side. “Teacher, what should we do next?”

“It’ll be fine as long as we can develop normally!”

These resources were already enough for him, and he didn’t have any plans to expand. However, the bloodline tower’s normal development was inevitable, and he wouldn’t stop it.

Vivika nodded.

“Oh, right. Yesterday, a female Warlock named Simona came and wanted to join our bloodline tower. I heard that you know her, my Lord!”

“Simona?” Eli thought for a few seconds before he remembered and said, ” then let her join us. It doesn’t matter. We don’t need to make any special arrangements.”

“Alright!”

“There’s one more thing that I think you should know,” Vivika said.

“Oh?” Eli turned around and looked at Vivika curiously.

“It’s about the force that has been supporting the Holy tower recently!” Vivika replied.

Eli became serious. The reason why the Holy tower had been able to stand tall recently, other than its own Foundation, was the participation of that unknown force, but it did not seem to be a force from the central region.

“teacher, that force is called the hourglass of time. It’s in the North of the West Coast and is the only force in the North.”

“Tell me in detail!”

And this was a faction that Eli had never heard of.

Vivika looked around and then began to explain, ” teacher, you also know that the northernmost part of the central continent is the heart of darkness and the Holy tower’s territory. But what you don’t know is that this division of territory was due to the hourglass of time.

“the forces from the central main road came here about 700 to 800 years ago. Before we came, this place was actually unified. It was ruled by this force called the hourglass!

“This was a Warlock force that had developed by relying on the inheritance of the dark Mages.

“It was said that the major forces back then even sent a celestial to destroy the Hourglass, but they managed to survive by relying on some things. The Hourglass retreated to the North of the West Coast, but strangely enough, the celestial was unwilling to attack further.

“After that, this force continued to develop in the North and never revealed itself.”

Vivika introduced the hourglass of time to Eli, as well as the history.

“However, this force is very strong. They haven’t made any moves in hundreds of years. It seems that they have some ideas recently and want to expand to the West Coast again!”

Hearing the story of this faction, Eli was a little surprised.

Since it was related to the celestial, he couldn’t underestimate this force. The story behind it was also very interesting. This was a faction that even celestial didn’t want to face.

Terrifying!

After all, the celestial was the strongest entity Eli knew.

“then let’s collect more information about this organization. At least for now, it seems that they haven’t launched a large-scale attack!” Eli looked at Vivika and said.

“Alright!”

After chatting for a while more, Vivika left, leaving only Eli behind.

At this moment, Eli was by the silver Moon Lake. He looked at the calm surface of the lake, and his heart was somewhat moved.

The West Coast was not that simple!

However, for him currently, it was still okay.

At the very least, he could infer from what he already knew that the hourglass should not have a celestial. This was enough. He would put it aside for now. He would continue to develop.

He’s only at the middle stage of the third circle!

This operation could also delay the heart of darkness, allowing Eli to develop in peace for a few decades. After all, Eli was still a little weak when it came to fighting this famous Sergei.

He had tested it with the die, and the success rate was only 4 points!

Sergei was still too strong!
