134 Pity

As Gino’s residence was rather remote and far away from the camp, there was no one else on the way to the camp other than Eli. The other two apprentices took another route.

“Necromancy, interesting.” As he walked, Eli kept in mind the new knowledge he had obtained.

After all, it only cost a little money, so it was really worth it.

But when Eli turned a corner, he suddenly stopped in his tracks, and a strange expression appeared on his face.

Through his senses, Eli knew that Gino’s figure was getting closer and closer to him.

!!

“Sigh, it seems like he wants to kill and rob. Why would he go after an old man’s inheritance for his grandson? ” Eli sighed and walked towards the small path.

There was no doubt that the moment Gino appeared, he was already Eli’s enemy. He had no other choice.

As for why he was so sure that Gino was up to no good, Eli had never seen anyone hiding while chasing after someone, so he was very clear on what he was thinking.

…

Not far away.

Gino watched as Eli’s figure walked into the small path, and he revealed a sinister smile.

This was just right. The path was more hidden.

After making sure that there was no one else around, he headed straight for the small path, but very quickly, he realized that Eli’s path had already deviated from the small path, and was heading into the forest.

“Have I been discovered?” Gino was puzzled. “forget it. It’s better this way. It’s more hidden in the forest.”

In his mind, he was a first-circle Warlock, while Eli was only a zero-circle apprentice. They were not on the same level.

As he chased, he was getting closer and closer to Eli.

Soon, he stopped in front of a valley where Eli was.

He strode into the valley. Then, the moment he entered the valley, he suddenly felt runes appearing at the entrance behind him, sealing the valley in an instant. Meanwhile, Eli’s figure appeared not far away.

“What is this?” Gino did not care about Eli. Instead, he looked at the runes behind him curiously.

“This can hide the fluctuations here, and not a single sound will be emitted,” Eli replied not far away.

“That’s even better,” Gino wasn’t shocked. Instead, he was overjoyed, and he revealed a sinister smile as he looked at Eli.

He was too lazy to pretend anymore.

“Give me the fleshy flower.”

“No, this is Victor’s inheritance for his grandson. I’ve already promised him.” Eli shook his head, indicating his refusal.

“Then go to hell.”

Gino didn’t waste any time. The power of his bloodline was activated, and wisps of flames wrapped around his body. Fine hair grew out of his skin, and he charged straight at Eli.

This was the bloodline he had fused with, the One circle Lava fire Lion.

When Eli saw this, a large shadow surged out from his body, and his pupils gradually turned into golden vertical pupils. Scales that were barely visible appeared on his skin, and a cold feeling was instantly emitted.

Ever since he had fused with his bloodline, he had not fought a single battle. Gino would be his experiment.

Meanwhile, Gino, who was charging forward, had his eyes wide open. That was because he could feel a terrifying pressure from Eli, as well as an extreme sense of danger.

I can’t win!

Run!

Gino didn’t know why Eli had become so terrifying, and he wanted to change his direction.

But in the next second, Eli had already rushed over.

One claw appeared!

“No!”

Gino’s eyes widened, and he subconsciously blocked with his right hand. The next second, he felt a huge force and an all-pervasive shadow. In just an instant, his skin began to crack, and his body was directly sent flying backward.

Bang!

Gino’s figure shot into the rock wall like a cannonball, making a loud noise. However, due to the effect of the runes, the sound could not be transmitted.

When the smoke dispersed, Gino’s figure was revealed.

He was covered in blood, and a few of his bones were twisted. His eyes were filled with fear.

“Who are you?” Gino struggled in pain.

This was clearly a first-circle Warlock. How could he be an apprentice? He actually couldn’t tell at all, but when he saw Eli charging at him again, he knew it was too late.

Immediately, he stretched out his pocket and used the wizard weapon from before.

A mental energy attack instantly shot toward Eli.

Gino struggled to climb out of the mountain. In his impression, other than a small portion of bloodlines, most bloodlines had no resistance against mind power spells, not to mention that one look at Eli’s bloodline was enough to tell that he was extremely violent.

But when he looked at Eli out of the corner of his eye, he was also stunned.

The mind power attack passed through Eli, but Eli didn’t seem to be affected at all. His speed was even faster, and in the blink of an eye, he was already in front of him.

“No, don’t.”

Before he could beg for mercy, the attack had already arrived. In an instant, Gino’s head was turned into minced meat and fell to the ground with a bang. The mind power pendant also fell to the ground, making a clear and crisp sound.

“That’s all?”

In front of the corpse, Eli shook his head.

So weak!

This 1-circle warlock was too trashy, he thought he could fight for a while!

However, it was normal. Bloodline was a strange path, to begin with. When there was no difference in level, high-level bloodlines would have the power to crush low-level bloodlines.

Not to mention, it had been a long time since he became a mage, and he had been integrated with his bloodline for several years. It was reasonable for him to easily defeat a warlock who had just integrated the first circle bloodline.

As for the mind attack just now, it was fortunate that he had chosen to use Mind Shield. Otherwise, Gino might have been able to delay Eli for a while. It seemed that he had made the right choice by choosing this solidified spell.

“What a tragic death! One can’t be too greedy!” Looking at Gino’s dead figure, Eli shook his head. He extracted his broken spirit and burned it directly. This way, he could ensure that he would not turn into an undead.

After confirming Gino’s death, Eli began to search the corpse. As it was a sudden pursuit, he did not take many things with him. He only took the first circle mage tool and more than a hundred magic stones.

After cleaning up his tracks, Eli continued to leave on the road. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

As for the other ruin remains in the house, Eli thought about them and decided not to. After all, he had gotten what he wanted, and there was no need to cause trouble for those trivial matters.

…

Everything went smoothly on his way back, but when he returned to his house and saw the person lying in front of the door next to him, he was stunned again.

The corner of Eli’s mouth twitched.

If he wasn’t blind, the one lying in front of the door should be Victor.

It was almost the same position as last time, and he was also seriously injured.

If it weren’t for the fact that the wound was different, Eli would have thought that he was dreaming about it more than half a year ago.

He didn’t know what Victor had gone through to come back alive from the undead of the first circle.

However, he was still alive.

Just like the last time, after checking that there were no other traces, Eli dragged Victor into the house and performed a simple treatment.

…

Two days passed just like that.

So far, no one had discovered Gino’s death, and Victor’s injuries seemed to have recovered, but his spirit seemed to have been damaged. Eli had to feed him some magic potion.

Another two days passed.

Victor finally woke up from his sleep.

“Herman, you saved me again.” Victor opened his eyes with a weak look and felt that his wounds and injuries had healed.

“It’s nothing. It’s just a small problem.” Eli shook his head. He did not lack these magic potions.

“Also, I heard that you took the initiative to draw away the first circle undead. You’re really brave! Oh? ” Eli teased.

“Don’t even mention it.” Victor was indignant when he heard this, ” Actually, it was Gino who forced me to go. He even used the fleshy flower as a threat before I reluctantly agreed.

“Hey, is Gino back? Did he bring back the fleshy flower?” Suddenly, he realized something and asked Eli.

“Here, your fleshy flower.” Eli smiled and walked to another room to retrieve the wooden box of the flower and handed it to Victor. Since Victor was still alive, it was natural to return it to its original owner.

Victor took a deep breath as he looked at the fleshy flower in the box. He was immediately puzzled. “Gino actually gave this to you? I thought he’d keep this to himself.”

“Well, it actually went quite well. But he is still a terrible man to force you to lure a first-circle undead away.” Eli thought about how he had killed Gino with a slap, so it should be considered a success.

“Is that so?” Victor was surprised. This was different from the Gino he knew.

“Then how did you escape?” Eli changed the topic.

“uh, I was being chased by the undead. I was about to die, but I suddenly reached an exit and ran out. After that, the undead didn’t chase me and ran in another direction.” Victor recalled the nightmare-like memory.

“Just like that?” Eli was surprised. It seemed like Victor was very lucky.

“I’m almost done too. I’ll be leaving then.” Victor didn’t want to trouble Eli just like last time.

“Yes.”

Watching Victor leave, Eli didn’t stop him.

“Eli, thank you for helping me take care of the flower.” Suddenly, Victor turned around and thanked him.

“I’m just doing what I should be doing,” Eli replied with a smile.

…

Three days later.

Someone suddenly knocked on Eli’s door, and it was Victor.

“Eli, something’s happened. Gino’s dead!” Victor said in disbelief.

“Dead? How did he die?” Eli was also very surprised.

“I don’t know. Last night, Gino’s friends went to look for him. Not only did they not find out where Gino went, but they also found out that his soul slaves were all dead. So, he should be dead.” Victor panted heavily and said happily.

“That’s a pity. Did they find out who killed him? ” Eli asked again.

“No, they searched the entire area and finally found some traces in the valley, but the killer cleaned the place up too cleanly and didn’t have any clues at all. It’s really a pity.” He sighed.

“It’s indeed a pity.” Eli nodded in agreement.

A first-circle sorcerer had died just like that!

No one even knew who killed him. What a pity.
