320 Book of Curses

In the secret realm!

Eli was lying on the recliner.

Not far away, Hill was stretching his branches. Beside him, Hydra was lying on the grass with its three snake heads raised as if it was enjoying the sunlight.

Further away, Doggo was surrounded by a large number of mechanical items, which were modifying himself. In his words, he had to make himself stronger before heading to the central continent. He was currently at the combat level of a second-circle warlock!

During this period of time, Eli had once again sunk into a relaxed environment. He would usually do experiments, followed by his daily meditation. The main reason was that he currently had nothing other than the information on the fourth circle upgrade.

Therefore, he had to increase his previous knowledge. This was also an important means to improve his combat power, especially his control of shadows, which was of utmost importance.

“I kind of want to go to the central continent to take a look.”

“Damn, what am I thinking?!”

Eli suppressed this terrifying thought. He would not entertain the thought of putting himself in danger. If he could delay going to the central continent, he would.

At this moment, Doggo walked over and asked a familiar question, ” Eli, when are we going to the central continent?!

“Don’t worry. We’ll be there soon!” Eli laughed.

“Alright,” he said. His mechanical eyes were filled with helplessness.

That’s what Eli had said for over a hundred years.

But he wouldn’t leave, especially after Eli advanced to celestial. This might really be the last celestial mage he would meet. He couldn’t leave him.

Doggo left in disappointment, and Eli turned to look behind him.

The huge Hill was emitting a glow and was now nearly 20 meters tall.

“When do you think you’ll be able to advance?” Eli asked, sighing. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

At this moment, Hill stretched out the branch and placed it on Eli’s forehead.

“You need more space and a higher concentration of elements? Is the West Coast not enough? ” Eli blinked. This was the first time Hill had expressed his appeal so clearly.

He finally understood why Hill had not advanced.

It turned out that he had encountered the same problem as when he was in Bryne, where the environment did not allow it.

In that case, the only place that could satisfy him was the central continent!

Eli was speechless. All of his subordinates were so restless. The Hydra was still the best. All it did was eat and sleep. Eli looked over.

As if sensing Eli’s gaze, Hydra opened his eyes and fell asleep again a second later.

Eli, “…”

“Hill, don’t worry. We’ll be there soon.” Eli looked at the tree behind him.

Hill didn’t have much of a reaction. He only shook the branch gently.

“Good child!” Eli smiled, and Hill’s branch swayed even faster.

As they laughed and joked around, suddenly, the space in front of Eli seemed to tremble slightly.

Eli sat up straight and looked over. A crack gradually appeared in the space, and an aura that contained a curse slowly emerged from it, flying towards him.

“Eh, I thought they had already settled it by themselves!”

Looking at the shadow, Eli was stunned.

Since the crystal didn’t react more than ten years ago, he thought that Jin Ji was fine. He didn’t expect that it would suddenly be used more than ten years later. Something must have happened!

“A bloodline curse?” Eli felt the curse in it and pursed his lips gently!

It was a new curse that he had never seen before.

“Maybe I can combine this curse with the ones I already have…” Eli took the shadow and sealed the curse within.

He had a hobby, and that was experimenting with curses and spells.

It just so happened that he had nothing to do recently!

Immediately, Eli headed towards the laboratory.

Three months later.

Eli walked out of the laboratory, a book that looked like a mage’s book in his hand.

The cover was dark green, with golden patterns on the surface and silver borders. What was interesting was that the entire book was wrapped in a layer of Mithril chains.

“Book of curses, a third circle warlock weapon, using the remaining Shadow Dragon Skin, Mithril, and quicksand gold … Currently, it contains three curses: an ordinary curse, a mental curse, and a bloodline curse. The book can also be improved further!” Eli held the book and smiled.

However, since he had already made it, he needed to use it.

Then who should he use it on?

Eli fell into deep thought.

A few seconds later, his eyes lit up. Wasn’t there a suitable person on the West Coast? There was no information on the celestial warlock from the Hourglass, so he had to collect some information first.

Since there was a battle between the time hourglass and the forces from the West Coast, there must be some clues.

He had to ask Aisha and the others to help him investigate.

Soon, Eli sent a message to Aisha.

“What? the hourglass of time has a celestial?” Aisha, who had just arrived, was surprised.

“Yes, I am.” Eli nodded. A long time ago, he had determined that based on the die of fate.

Aisha sucked in a breath of cold air.

“Grandmaster, I’ll send someone to investigate!” Aisha became serious. If this were true, it would not be good for them.

...

Her Grandmaster had just advanced, so he might not be a match for him.

Aisha left in a hurry, and Eli went back to wait.

A month later, Eli received a message.

“Gaido Misda.”

They only got a name, but it was enough for Eli.

Eli took out the book of curses, and the silver chains slowly unfurled. He flipped to the third page and wrote down the name of Gaido Misda. As for the price he had to pay, it was a thousand years of his life. After all, it was just an experiment.

The price was light.

..

At this moment.

At the inverted tower in the distant hourglass of time.

The bottom of the tower had been transformed into a huge pool filled with blood. There were also pipes at the side that constantly replenished the blood.

...

In the pool, the thick blood was boiling and bubbling from time to time. In the center was an old man with a naked body, absorbing the power in the blood.

Gaido Misda, a Warlock who had once been a cluster star celestial warlock, had almost died in battle. Now, after a hundred years of recovery, he had finally returned to his former level.

Suddenly, Gaido opened his eyes and spat out a mouthful of blood.

“What is this?” Gaido was stunned.

He had been absorbing blood as usual, but just now, he suddenly felt that his blood flow was not smooth, and his blood vessels almost went berserk, which caused him to suffer quite a heavy injury.

He had lost the progress he had made over the past twenty years.

“F * ck!”

The corner of Gaido’s mouth twitched, and he could only blame it on his own bad luck.

So he quickly ordered his men to replenish the blood.

..

Thirty years later.

Pfff!

Gaido spat out another mouthful of blood!

“Damn it!” At this moment, his face was ferocious and full of anger.

For the past 30 years, his blood would go berserk once a year. This caused his recovery to be extremely slow, almost the same as when he had just woken up, and his level had also fallen to the micro star level.

But at this moment, he also realized a problem.

This might not be a coincidence anymore, but someone wanted to harm him.

“Who is it?” Gaido gritted his teeth.

He had been keeping a low profile ever since he woke up, so how could anyone have found out?

Could it be those guys from the central continent?

But wouldn’t they all be dead? Furthermore, how could they suddenly attack him after a thousand years?

If it was impossible for it to be on the central continent, then it should be on the West Coast.

However, the bloodline tower was the only force on the West Coast!

Although he didn’t go out, he’d heard about the bloodline tower and knew that they had a celestial Warlock who seemed to have just advanced. He’d originally planned to kill him after recovering a little, but now it seemed that the situation was reversed.

“Damn it. The blood of a celestial should be enough for me to recover a bit.”

Gaido gritted his teeth, and his face was ashen!

He was really angry.
