145 Numb

A year passed in the blink of an eye.

To Eli, this didn’t mean anything special, but to Rawls, he was feeling complicated and excited.

After two years of growth, the latest batch of magic plants in the magic herb field had basically matured and could be picked. He also thought that this was a good time to chase away Eli.

“Such a person is too weak.” Rawls shook his head. He was very displeased with Eli.

Although he had never gone to take a look at Eli’s magic herb field again, it was clear from Eli’s carefree life every day that he didn’t put too much effort into it. He wasn’t like him, who was conscientious.

!!

“Tomorrow is the time for the report. At that time, I’ll definitely make a complaint in front of battalion commander Kratos.” Rawls looked at the production report and revealed a smile.

He was very confident.

…

The next day.

Eli and Rawls arrived at Kratos ‘office.

In fact, every department had to report to Kratos about the development of the Department, and the special magic plant Department had to make a summary of the growth of the magic plants every two years.

Coming here again, Eli didn’t feel anything at all. He was holding a document in his hand, while Rawls, who was standing straight beside him, had a confident smile.

“Tell me, how have you been these two years?” Kratos asked with a smile.

Both Eli and Rawls were his new generation of subordinates, so it was hard for him to say which one he was biased towards. However, as for Rawls, a Warlock with a second-circle bloodline, although he had some minor flaws, he was serious in his work, and Kratos had high hopes for him.

“My Lord, this year has been very smooth for the magical plant Department, especially for the part where I manage. The output of all the magical plants has increased to a large extent, among which the silent Crescent has increased by ten percent compared to the year before last. Other crops such as sun Corolla, snake fruit grass, and the like have also increased to different degrees.” Rawls said proudly.

“The specific values are silent Crescent…”

Rawls spoke with fervor and assurance while holding the document.

Kratos also nodded in satisfaction and praised, “Rawls, good job.”

He was indeed very satisfied. This was the highest production in the camp in the past ten years. Compared to the year before last, the production had increased by about 20%. Although it did not seem much, it was already very good.

“This is what I should do. I go to the magic herb field every day and use many methods. I often work late into the night.” Roars revealed a smile and expressed his efforts.

It was said that hard work was more valuable when it was seen by the boss.

“Eli, what about you? These two years, I think you’ve been slacking. Maybe the magic potion Department is used to that kind of life. You can’t be like this. The magic plant Department needs people who are willing to do hard work.” Rawls said with a smile.

As for his heart, he was already thinking about what he should say later to get rid of Eli.

Eli: “…”

“How about you, Herman?” Kratos asked after dealing with Rawls.

“The production of my field is a bit lower than expected,” Eli said.

“Oh, by how much?” Kratos asked curiously.

“40%!”

Pfft!

Rawls covered his mouth and laughed in his heart, but he apologized, “I’m sorry. I didn’t expect you to be able to be so bad.”

“Indeed, it’s a little bad.” Kratos also frowned. It was 40% less than in previous years. What was this? Although there was an insect disaster last year, it shouldn’t be like this.

“It’s indeed a little bad. I originally thought that the production would increase by at least 60%, but it’s only this little. It’s indeed much worse than I expected.” Eli nodded in agreement.

Kratos was speechless.

Rawls was speechless.

“What did you just say? Increase production?” Rawls exclaimed with a confused look.

“That’s right. This year, the silent Crescent… The scattered parts should be a little more than 40%, and after rounding it up, it should be 40%.” Eli looked at them strangely. “Aren’t we talking about the same thing?”

On the side, Kratos ‘mouth twitched.

What shocked him, even more, was that Eli had an increased production!

40%?

How the f*ck did he do it?!

“How did you do it?” Kratos was in disbelief.

“The previous planting methods and processes were too crude, ” Eli said curiously. “I’ve only improved a little.”

Kratos took a deep breath, feeling that there was a generation gap between him and Eli.

Crude?

Kratos thought for a moment. Their planting method seemed to have been updated thirty years ago. He wondered who taught them at that time, but they had been using it all the time. Was it very crude? Kratos began to doubt his knowledge.

“40%, 40% …” Rawls still muttered.

“No, I think we should go and see it in person. I don’t believe it.” Rawls shook his head and said.

An increase in production by 40% was too ridiculous.

He had worked hard and checked daily in exchange for this result, but someone suddenly told him that he had been sticking to bad methods and that he was not even as efficient as Eli. It was a little unacceptable to him.

“Hmm, now that Rawls has said so, let’s take a look over there.” Kratos didn’t quite believe it, either.

Eli nodded. So be it.

Growing magic potions was also a type of knowledge that needed to be adjusted at any time. It would be a bit of a dream to rely on a single method to guarantee a high yield. This group of people had dug their heels to the point of becoming fools.

Soon, Kratos, Eli, and Rawls arrived at Eli’s farm.

“Minister, ah, battalion commander.” Paul happened to be there and exclaimed when he saw the three of them.

“Yes, we came with our battalion commander to take a look.” Eli nodded, indicating for him to do his thing.

Kratos and Rawls didn’t have the time to pay attention to him because they were looking at the magic herb field in front of them in silence. The once sparse silent Crescent grew like wheat, and so did the other magic herbs.

What surprised them, even more, was that the overall quality of the magical plants was also very high.

“Not bad, not bad at all.” Kratos nodded with a smile.

The magic herb field was considered his property, and he could also get a lot of profits from it. Of course, Eli would also get some of the profit.

At this point, Rawls could no longer speak. He just kept taking deep breaths, feeling a bit uncomfortable.

His hard work was not as good as the one occupying the recliner daily.

This caused his worldview to collapse.

“Hey, wait a minute.” Suddenly, Rawls seemed to have seen something and walked towards a magic herb field.

“This place has also been invaded by those bugs,” Rawls confirmed.

“Yes.” Naturally, Eli knew what he was talking about.

The magic plants that had been gnawed on by the seed would generally have a little trace, and their medicinal properties would also be reduced.

Kratos looked at this scene with interest. He knew about the bugs, but the problem was solved quickly, so he didn’t pay attention to it.

Was there something else that he didn’t know?

“Yes, if I remember correctly, when I came here, there were more insects here than there were in my place. I solved the pest issue after using the magic potion department’s magic potion, but what about you? You must have used the same potion. But how did you get the potion before me?” Ross stood up and looked at Eli with a serious face.

“Did you deliberately collude with the potions Department? I remember that you were the Deputy Minister there in the past.” Rawls looked at Eli with a sharp gaze.

The scene was solemn.

Eli looked at them, a little speechless, not really wanting to explain.

“Uh, but the potion was developed by department head Herman!” Suddenly, someone at the side spoke up. It was Rona, who had been following not far away.

“What?” Rawls suddenly broke free and looked at Rona.

“That potion was developed by the Minister and then sent to the magic potion Department. Otherwise, you wouldn’t have gotten the potions in the end, Minister Rawls.” Rona hesitated for a moment, but he still said it. He felt that his leader couldn’t be slandered like this.

“You’re the one who created that potion?!” Rawls couldn’t take it anymore and looked at Eli.

Eli didn’t say anything. He just nodded and looked at Rawls as if he was looking at an idiot.

Rawls: …

Why didn’t you say so earlier?

Kratos also came to a sudden realization. Then, he looked at Eli with admiration. Although this colleague of his was only at the first circle, he was indeed a man of great potential. It seemed that he had to pay more attention to him in the future.

“Eli!”

Rawls still wanted to say something but was stopped by Kratos, who said, “That’s it. Rawls, I have to criticize you. Eli is such a good example, how could you not learn from him?”

Rawls almost spurted out a mouthful of blood.

Role model? He went to work once every three days, and when he came, all he did was lay down on a recliner.

He suddenly felt that the world was dark.

“Sigh, I’ve lost this time.” Rawls looked at Eli and sighed.

“When were we in a competition?” Eli was baffled. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Rawls became stunned. Eli wasn’t even paying attention to him. He covered his chest and moved two steps back.

For the first time in his life, he felt that the world was gray.

On the way back, Rawls walked at the back with his head lowered. Kratos and Eli talked with fervor and assurance. Kratos first shared his own life story. Then he started to talk to Eli about potions. The main thing was that he really didn’t understand potions.

Back at the tower, Kratos looked at Eli and praised, “Herman, you have to teach Rawls. He might not understand these things.”

Eli nodded.

Rawls closed his eyes. If not for Eli, he would have contributed the highest magical plant production in the past few decades. However, his world collapsed.

Simply put, he was numb.
