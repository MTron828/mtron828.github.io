94 Departure

It was different from the simple funeral of Seviro Mesa when he died.

When Clement died, many of the Empire’s famous big shots came to express their grief. This was also the first day Eli did not conduct any studies or experiments.

On this day, he was busy preparing for the funeral.

As for the expenses this time, they would be paid by the library.

They watched as the gorgeous coffin was sent to the cemetery. Soil dropped on the coffin, and the wooden coffin disappeared in front of everyone. Some people covered their faces and cried, while others treated it calmly.

Eli and Herman were standing in the middle.

Eli was silent.

Herman was also sad. He wasn’t any better than Eli. Actually, Clement was more worried about him and had even helped him a lot.

On the other hand, it was eli who rarely needed help and was very capable.

This was also why he had asked Eli to help take care of Herman.

“Don’t be too sad, Eli.” Rias patted Eli’s shoulder from the left and consoled him.

On the other side, Hila was also standing quietly. Unlike Rias, her feelings for Eli were more of admiration.

Even further away, Marquis Alex, count Klein, and the others were also watching this scene in silence.

Roland held his wife in his arms, and his daughter stood aside. Although they weren’t familiar with Clement, they knew Eli and knew that he was a person who had helped them a lot. Today was the day that Eli’s teacher passed away.

Eli took a deep breath and turned to look at the group of people behind him.

He bowed deeply.

Then he left.

Everyone made way for him.

…

Clement’s death was a huge change for Eli.

He had become more tenacious.

He felt that he had really grown up. It was as if he had suddenly understood many things from the past. He also understood that he should continue to live well and not let down his teacher’s expectations.

Eternal life was just a state. Everything he experienced would be turned into nourishment, allowing Eli to grow gradually.

And growth often came with a price.

…

After Clement’s death, the library was also closed for three days to express their condolences.

But at the same time, the king’s side finally began to move.

For a time, the authority level of the library was changing rapidly. This place was gradually becoming the king’s own territory.

This time, Eli didn’t care.

Three months later.

The Vice Directors of the library had been changed. The two nobles were the king’s own people, but in order to not look too bad, they still elected a person from the library, and Hila became one of the Vice Directors.

Another three months passed.

The chief election had also begun.

This time, it was a Marquis who had taken up the position of the head of the library.

The library completely belonged to the king, and the original system had changed. The system was more strict, and the ideology was less intense. It was more like a bureaucratic organization than a library.

Eli didn’t do anything, and he just maintained his peaceful life.

Another two months passed, and this time, the imperial library allowed eli to return and take on parts of the work. They also gave him a generous salary and welfare benefits, as well as the opportunity to promote him to a scholar.

He refused.

He then resigned from all his duties in the library and became an ordinary learner.

From then on, he didn’t belong to any power.

A year passed in the blink of an eye.

Eli made a decision. He decided to go out and travel to increase his knowledge, understand more things, and see how the world worked.

He was already a level 3 acolyte.

To him, there was almost nothing there that could pose a threat to him. As long as it was not a first-circle opponent, even if he could not defeat them, he could still escape.

As for the possibility of encountering the creatures of the first circle, the probability is not high. After all, he’s only going out to travel, and it’s not like he has to go to the deep mountains to look for something.

Furthermore, there was a map left behind by Seviro Mesa. Not only did it record the terrain and dangerous situations of many places in the country, but it also recorded many places abroad. It would be of some help to Eli.

Just like that, in the year 339 of the bryne calendar, the 54-year-old Eli told his friends that he was leaving Jun Lin.

…

A week later.

Somewhere outside the city.

Sitting in the carriage, Eli smiled at the group of people who were there to send him off.

“Be careful on the road!” Rias’ eyes were slightly red as she spoke.

She knew she couldn’t stop Eli’s decision.

“Okay, you take care of yourself too.” Eli nodded, and the two of them hugged.

“You’re already 54 years old, but you’re still running around. Seriously.” Hila said unhappily after Rias bid her farewell.

“Take care of yourself.” Eli didn’t say anything. It was just a simple hug.

She was one of his few female friends.

“Good friend, I hope to see you again!” Alex was almost 60 years old, and his body wasn’t as strong as it used to be.

“Take care,” he said. Roland simply held onto Eli’s hand and handed him a badge.

“This is my badge. Along the way, as long as there is a place with the Rose Chamber of Commerce, you can go in and take whatever you want. If you need anything, you can also ask them to prepare it.”

“Alright!” Eli nodded.

The Rose Chamber of Commerce had grown into the number one Chamber of Commerce in Bryne. They had their own chambers, even in the surrounding countries.

“Sir, this is from the Kazan Chamber of Commerce.” Zhong Li also handed over a plate and said.

Eli took it as well, looked at the crowd, and turned around to get into the car.

“Teacher!”

At this moment, a clear voice was heard.

“Oh?” Eli turned to look.

A luxurious carriage drove out of the city gate, and the black dragon on the side of the carriage told him that it belonged to the merlin family, the imperial family.

A pretty young girl poked her head out and greeted them.

As soon as the carriage stopped, a figure jumped down. It was a young girl of about 13 or 14 years old. She was beautiful, with long black hair, blue eyes, and tender white skin. She was wearing a white dress.

She ran straight towards him and hugged him.

“Teacher, why didn’t you tell me that you were leaving?” The girl looked up at Eli.

“Anna!” Eli touched the girl’s head.

This was the six-year-old girl from before, and now she was about to mature.

The girl alighted from the carriage, and the other woman, who was also graceful and luxurious, also alighted from the carriage.

“Her Majesty!” Everyone immediately saluted when they saw it.

“Anna wants to see you, so I can only send her here.” The Queen said.

She still couldn’t understand why Anna liked her teacher so much.

But thankfully, Eli was already 54 years old, so she didn’t think there was anything wrong with it. It was just a strong teacher-student relationship, which was why she brought Anna along.

If Eli was 20 years old, she would definitely kill him.

“Teacher, I brought this for you.” Holding onto Eli’s waist, Anna seemed to have thought of something and took out a coat of arms from her clothes. “this was given to me by my father. As long as you’re still in the Empire, even a Marquis will help you if you take this out!” Anna said as she looked at Eli with her big eyes.

“What?” the queen’s eyes also widened. ‘This thing is too powerful for a mere learner!’

“Forget it. I’ll leave this to little Anna. Her Majesty, I’m leaving.” Eli refused with a smile and saluted the Queen. He then patted Anna’s head and turned to get into the car.

“Let’s go, coachman!” At this moment, the coachman was already in shock. Heavens, just who was this person? So many important people had come to send him off.

However, he did not dare to delay. He slowly started the carriage and headed towards the main road. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Goodbye, teacher!” It was still Anna’s clear voice.

Eli glanced at the waving crowd and drew the curtains.

The next time he returned would be the time to retrieve Saleen Metatrin’s legacy.
