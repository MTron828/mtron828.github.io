576 Sixth Circle

Looking at Eli’s gaze, the two Sea Tribe Sovereigns couldn’t help but take a step back!

That was the Black Turtle Emperor, an existence with the highest defense. Even it couldn’t defeat it easily. But today, Eli had easily done something it couldn’t do!

This made it feel inexplicably cold!

The sea giant stood on the spot, its huge throat trembling as it said, “Are you kidding me? The Black Turtle Emperor lost just like that?”

Compared to them, the army of the Sea Tribes on the ground was even crazier, especially the Ink Turtle Tribe. They let out mournful wails and looked at Eli with anger in their eyes.

“How could His Majesty lose just like that? Absolutely impossible!”

“Damned human, he must have used despicable methods. His Majesty has been plotted against!”

“No, no, no, it’s fake. It’s all fake!”

Countless members of the Sea Tribes were boiling. They were completely boiling!

The Alliance members couldn’t help but take a deep breath.

“Why do I feel like the lord has become stronger again!” Alida looked at Eli’s figure and touched her forehead. She felt that it was unreal!

Was it resolved just like that?

That was a powerful late-stage fifth-circle marine race!

Wasn’t this a little too much?

“Did Milord succeed?” Nikola looked at the same time. He seemed to have thought of something, and his eyes narrowed.

However, if his guess was correct, it was too fast!

” As expected of my teacher!”

David looked at Eli’s figure and immediately recalled the scene of the Lich War that day. His blood boiled, but when he thought of how he had promised his teacher to take care of everything, he lowered his head in shame.

“Is this the person I wanted to plot against?”

Kyle was looking at Eli in the distance with suspicion, his mouth twitching.

He could suppress the Black Turtle Emperor, but he could not kill it, let alone control it.

At this moment, he suddenly regretted his little trick earlier!

“But… If you were facing the Deep Sea Demon Whale Emperor and the Sea Giant Emperor, would you still be able to be so relaxed?”

He raised his head and looked at the battlefield in the sky.

Facing two emperors…

Could he still crush them?

..

In the sky.

After all, the Deep Sea Demon Whale Emperor and the Sea Giant Emperor were fifth-circle entities who had survived for countless years. Therefore, after experiencing a few seconds of shock, they quickly adjusted their mentality.

They looked at Eli cautiously, but there was no fear.

The Deep Sea Demon Whale King took a crown out of nowhere. The enormous crown rapidly transformed and flew towards the head, turning into a gorgeous crown in the blink of an eye!

The crown slowly pushed the whale king’s power to the sixth circle.

” This is the Deep Sea Crown, a top mage tool. As long as you wear it, as long as there is an ocean nearby, the user will receive the blessing of the power of the ocean.

“At this moment, I can even temporarily possess the combat strength of a sixth circle mage. How can you win me?” The Deep Sea Demon Whale Emperor looked at Eli and roared loudly.

At the same time, an illusory ocean seemed to appear behind him, emitting a cool feeling and a splashing sound as if it was a real ocean.

The Sea Giant Emperor also revealed a look of reverence.

The reason why the Deep Sea Demon Whale Clan was able to sit firmly in the first place was also because of the tool bestowed by the mages in the mage era.

Although it wasn’t a complete world with six rings, this ocean was still like an incomplete world. It was enough to unleash a portion of the power of the sixth circle to suppress the enemy.

“What are you going to use to stop me?”

The Sea Giant Emperor silently took a step back.

“What? How did it do this? Eli is finished. No, we are all finished. Everyone will die here today.” Kyle’s mood, which had just changed, became heavy again, and his body could not help but tremble.

This was a sixth-circle beast!

The rest of the people also looked at the scene in the sky, and their throats moved slightly.

As for the marine race, they were already cheering.

The Deep Sea Demon Whale Emperor on the other side…

He looked at the calm Eli and was a little angry!

“Eli, go to hell!” The Deep Sea Demon Whale Emperor let out a whale cry, and the sea and sky shook along with it. At the same time, the ” ocean ” behind him also pressed down on Elai.

Weng!

It was as if an incomplete world had fallen from the sky. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Countless Warlocks instantly felt a huge pressure, and they were all pressed to the ground. Fourth-circle Warlocks had no choice but to fall, and the five-circle Warlocks also felt very difficult. Even the city walls began to buzz as if they would collapse at any moment.

“Is this the power of the sixth circle?”

Many Warlocks felt a chill in their hearts as they looked at the sky uneasily.

“Brother Eli!” Alida looked worried.

“We’re really done for!”

Kyle’s body trembled. He completely regretted participating in this battle.

He moved his body and ran into the distance.

He wanted to run.

However, a figure blocked him.

The Sea Giant Emperor looked at him with a smile and said, “Human Warlock, you can’t leave before my lord finishes off Eli!”

Kyle’s face turned completely dark. He knew that he couldn’t leave today.

“Oh, is that it?”

At this moment, Eli’s voice suddenly entered his ears, and he couldn’t help but look over.

In the blue sky, Eli was suspended.

In front of him, the incomplete ocean pressed down like the real world, as if it wanted to crush Eli into pieces. However, Eli remained calm, but a mysterious fluctuation suddenly emanated from his body.

The aura surpassed the fifth circle stage and swept across the battlefield like a storm.

Everyone felt the pressure, and suddenly it became even more difficult.

“Only, why do I feel that the pressure is even stronger than the Demon Whale Emperor!” However, the Warlocks raised their heads and revealed puzzled expressions. Then, their mouths fell open.

After Eli spoke, the power of the world rippled. In the midst of the illusion, various phenomena appeared. The sea of blood rippled, the hymn of heaven, the cry of the abyss, the cry of time…

After that, a huge shadow slowly descended.

It was a complete world.

“Press!” Eli pressed down with one hand.

In the next second.

The world of Eli pressed down on the ocean. In almost an instant, the huge ocean world shattered into pieces without any resistance.

The entire battlefield fell silent.

“What?” A few seconds later, the Sea Giant Emperor spoke in a daze.

How could the ocean world be crushed so easily?

Was it an illusion? However, the extremely realistic sensation around him told him that this was real. The sea world had really been crushed into pieces by Eli, using another world.

But wasn’t that a sixth-circle technique?

“Eli is at the sixth circle!” He couldn’t believe it and pulled his hands down weakly.

“Sixth circle!”

“Eli is at the sixth circle!”

The Sea Giant Emperor’s words were like a switch. On the entire battlefield, whether it was the Sea Tribe or the humans, everyone was stunned as they read out the information that Eli was a sixth circle warlock. Their voices spread for thousands of miles.

“How can you be at the sixth circle?”

Only the Deep Sea Demon Whale Emperor had a crazed expression as it stared at Eli.

He couldn’t accept it. He couldn’t accept it!

However, whether he accepted it or not, the truth was right in front of him.

And there was another thing that made him even more desperate.

“The world is here!”

The enormous world had arrived.

It smashed towards him!
