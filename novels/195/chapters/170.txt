171 A Change in Attitude

The two warlocks stayed for a while more before quickly leaving the place while Eli continued his search into the fog.

Soon, he found a new Chimera, but this time its target was not the White Tower but the Warlock of the Blood Alliance.

He wasn’t so kind when facing an enemy force, so he took out a small folding stool and began to watch the battle.

In the middle of the road, a man and a beast were fighting. In the house in the distance, Eli was sitting on a small stool and watching the battle.

The one from the blood Alliance was a Warlock at the middle stage of the first circle. His opponent was a one-circle late-stage Chimera, a creature that looked like a wild boar.

!!

“Damn it, damn it!”

The Warlock saw Eli as well, but he was currently being held back and had no way out. What made him even more uncomfortable was that he was completely suppressed by the chimera, and there was nothing he could do.

Finally, ten minutes later, the chimera pierced through the Warlock’s body and tore him into several pieces.

The victorious Chimera chuckled and tried to devour the Warlock’s body. However, in the next second, countless shadows instantly enveloped it.

A few seconds later, the shadow dissipated, leaving behind a black crystal on the ground.

“Slightly smaller, about 40 grams.” Eli walked over to pick up the core and sensed its general weight.

Then, he quickly left.

There weren’t that many chimeras in the fog, so he had to hurry.

And so, in the fog, someone who destroyed the ‘battle environment’ suddenly appeared.

Every time he met the warlocks of the White Tower, Eli would thoughtfully help them defeat the chimeras and then send them away. And when he met the warlocks of the Blood Alliance, he would take out a small stool to watch the battle. If the Warlock could win, then he would thoughtfully give some help to the chimeras. If the warlock couldn’t win, then he would wait patiently. Of course, if it was too slow, he would still intervene a little.

Just like that, the number of elemental crystals in Eli collected increased rapidly.

As time went by, the number of people searching was getting slower and slower, and the number was getting smaller and smaller. Eli also deliberately moved toward the center of the Mage Tower. He was looking forward to what was in the Tower!

..

What Eli didn’t know was that everything outside was also changing.

Two hours ago.

The two warlocks ran out of the town in a sorry state and told everything about how Eli had saved them. The other warlocks had interesting expressions on their faces.

“He’s that strong?”

“That’s not true, right? I don’t think he saved you for no reason. How could there be such a selfless person? ”

“Impossible, that’s impossible!”

The group of White Tower warlocks discussed animatedly, but the majority still had reservations about the words of the two warlocks. They did not quite believe that Eli was such a person.

But as time passed.

Warlocks and apprentices came out one after another, and the situation changed.

“It’s true. If it wasn’t for Sir Herman, I would have been dead.”

“From now on, master Herman will be my idol. He saw that I was too weak, so he sent us to the entrance of the town. If it was master Rawls, he might not be like this.”

“I’ll be a fan of master Herman from now on. He’s really something to be able to become a representative.”

The warlocks who were saved by Eli gushed in praise, while the warlocks who had remained outside were dumbfounded. Their attitude towards Herman was gradually changing.

From not caring to valuing, from distrusting to trusting, from disdain to admiration.

Of course, there were still some people who looked down on Eli, such as the first one-circle later stage Warlock, who scolded Eli first. He said in disdain, “He’s just a late-stage first-circle warlock. You guys can’t really think that he’s that strong, right? He must have some special way of dealing with chimeras. He’s just a clown.”

He was proud of himself, but when he looked around and saw eight or nine first-circle warlocks and a dozen zero-circle apprentices glaring at him, he suddenly shriveled up and did not dare to speak.

He had to admit that he had spoken a little too loudly just now.

Finally, under the kind persuasion of the warlocks, he lowered his head and said, “I’m an idiot.”

..

Eli didn’t know that the outside world’s view of him had changed so much. Even if he knew, he wasn’t in the mood to care because he had already arrived on the roof not far away from the Mage Tower.

He raised his head and looked forward.

The Black Mage tower was more than a hundred meters tall, piercing through the White mist like a dark spear that tore through the light. It was tall and solemn, and at this moment, a one-on-one battle was taking place under this solemn Magus tower.

It didn’t make sense to call it a one-on-one because, at this time, in addition to one man and one Chimera, there were seven or eight people scattered on the ground. They were from the White Tower and the Blood Alliance, but without exception, they were all first-circle warlocks.

To be able to kill so many warlocks here, the opponent was naturally not simple.

The chimera looked like a giant, five or six meters tall, and its body burned with cold blue flames. Its eyes were only the size of green beans, but the aura it gave off was not weak at all. It was a two-circle chimera.

His opponent was someone that Eli was very familiar with. It was Rawls who had previously gone deep into the mist. He was also in a very bad state at the moment.

“Are they all dead?” Rawls took a deep breath as he looked around.

Some of the seven or eight corpses were intact, some were broken, and they were scattered nearby. The ground had long been stained with blood. Even he was already at the end of his battle.

An hour ago, they came here with the Blood Alliance. They were supposed to be the ones fighting, but the sudden appearance of a two-circle Chimera changed everything.

They had no choice but to team up against such a powerful opponent, but they quickly realized the difference between a first-circle and second-circle creature. Even if it was a Chimera with limited intelligence, it was still not something they could defeat.

He was the only one left now, but his bloodline power had almost been completely burned out, so he was completely powerless to resist.

Therefore, when the ice flame giant walked to his side and grabbed him with one hand, he didn’t even move and just accepted his fate.

The ice flame giant picked him up and was about to stuff him into its mouth. It could replenish its energy.

“I’m going to die.

“It’s a pity that I couldn’t defeat Herman even once in my death.” Rawls felt his head becoming heavier and heavier.

The biggest regret of his life was not being able to defeat Herman, not in terms of combat power, but in other aspects.

However, it didn’t seem like a big deal to die with regrets.

“Goodbye, world.” Rawls ‘consciousness gradually faded.

Finally, his eyes slowly closed, and he was about to fall unconscious. Just as his eyes were about to close, a familiar figure seemed to appear in his blurry vision.

Herman?

Rawls sensed that figure unconsciously. He could never forget about that figure for the rest of his life. It must be a fantasy before his death.

Just like that, Rawls fell into a coma with regret.

At the same time, a shadow turned into a crescent moon and arrived at the arm of the blue flame giant in the blink of an eye. It was like a swallow flying across the blue and white sky.

One of the blue flame giant’s arms was broken in a split second, causing Rawls to fall down. However, a shadow caught him and threw him aside.

Bang!

Rawls directly knocked down a big tree. He was thrown far away from the battlefield.

“A second-circle chimera should have a valuable core, right?” Eli looked at the blue flame giant, his eyes shining.

In the next second, the entire area within a hundred meters was covered in shadows. One by one, skeletons wrapped in shadows appeared and fused with each other. In the blink of an eye, seven or eight second-circle shadow skeletons appeared.

In their hands were hammer bones condensed from shadows, and their bodies were covered in shadows.

The 2nd-circle combination spell, shadow-skeleton combination, used the basic undead manipulation as the main base. With a bit of combination spell and a bit of shadow from the dragon bloodline, this simple spell was formed, and its power reached the 2nd circle.

It just so happened that this spell had not been tested yet, so today was just right.

The blue flame giant, “…”

His pea-sized eyes looked at the seven or eight two-circle skeletons. He didn’t have much intelligence, to begin with, so he felt that something was wrong. However, it was too late. The skeletons had already attacked.

Three minutes later, the blue flame giant’s body fell to the ground with a loud thud, accompanied by a powerless wail.

A shadow reached into the giant’s body and took out an elemental crystal the size of a fist. It then moved over considerably and placed it into Eli’s hand.

In just three minutes, a two-circle Chimera had died.

The battle was over.Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m
