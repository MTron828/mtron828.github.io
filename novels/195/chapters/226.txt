227 Grimm’s Tower

“Wait. The bloodline tower isn’t a native force of the West Coast? ”

Eli extended his hand and interrupted Vivika. These forces seemed to be different from what he had imagined!

“Teacher, don’t you know?” Vivika had a strange look on her face!

‘I know nothing!’

!!

Eli muttered to himself. The White Tower had grown since the shadow lizard Warlock camp, and then it had come to this point step by step. Although it had been a long time, Eli had only been living in the South of the West Coast and had little contact with the central continent. Even the irises camp had developed a little in the central continent, but how could they have any connection with the top echelons of the West Coast like Vivika? so he really didn’t understand.

“Oh, it’s normal for the teacher to not understand. It seems that these things have not been made public!” Vivika suddenly understood and nodded. “Teacher, let me explain this to you.”

“Yes.”

It was necessary for him to understand the situation outside.

“Well, if I have to explain it, I might have to start from the source. The origin can be traced back to the period of the catastrophe. You should know about it, right, teacher catastrophe? ” Vivika said as she looked at Eli.

“I still know this. Yes, ” Eli replied.

However, he was very confused. How could this be related to something that happened thousands of years ago? it seemed that this matter might not be what he had thought. He would listen to Vivika.

“Well, that saves me a lot of trouble.” Vivika cleared her throat and said, “When we talk about the great catastrophe, we have to talk about the Magi’s departure.

“Tens of thousands of mages boarded the Sky City, and then passed through the world membrane of this world, and then headed to the endless world to find a new gathering place.

“Although they took away most of the resources, the Mages world was a truly large world at that time. Even if they evacuated, it was impossible to take everything away, so they had to give up some resources. It was these things that gave rise to the warlocks.”

Eli listened calmly. These were all things that could be inferred, and he knew that Vivika was not done.

Sure enough, after she finished, Vivika took a deep breath and began to tell him what she really wanted to say.

“The mages left many things behind. Among them, there is a legend that they left behind a legendary mage Tower, Grimm’s Tower. It is said that it is still hidden in this World!” Vivika’s gaze was distant as if she had returned to that era. Eli also listened carefully, this was all information he didn’t know.

” Grimm’s Tower?” However, when he heard about the mage Tower, Eli was still very confused. What did a mage tower have to do with anything?

Seeing the doubt in his eyes, Vivika first poured more tea for her before revealing the reason.

“The bloodline tower isn’t a force from the West Coast, but a force from the central continent. In fact, our full name should be the bloodline tower’s West Coast branch.

“The bloodline tower isn’t the only power on the West Coast. The majority of the major powers on the West Coast are from the central continent. We’ve joined forces to monopolize this place, which is why there’s so little information on how to advance to third-ring warlocks. Of course, this is off-topic.” Vivika smiled and added, “And we came here because there might be clues to Grimm’s Tower!”

“Clues?”

Wait a minute!

Eli extended his hand and raised his question at the right time.

“Just a clue? Is that why are there so many forces swarming the West Coast?”

“yes, clues. We’re not even sure if the clues are true. As for the authenticity of this legend, there are still doubts. We can’t even be sure if it’s true. It’s ridiculous, right? ”

Vivika smiled bitterly. She had the same reaction as Eli back then.

“This is ridiculous!” Eli raised his eyebrows. “it’s just an uncertain clue from an uncertain legend. Is Grimm’s Tower that powerful? ”

“Powerful? It’s more than just powerful!” Vivika tried her best to recall the story that Natasha had told her. In fact, this was all confidential information, but since Eli was her teacher, she would tell all. So she sat up straight, took a deep breath, and looked at Eli.

“Teacher, I don’t need to tell you how powerful the Mage world used to be. You should have learned about this from ancient books. So, what do you think of the strength of the Warlock world now? ”

“The difference should be huge!” Eli pursed his lips and said tactfully.

He wasn’t joking. It was hard to say if the current Warlock world had even 10% of the power of the Mage world.

“That’s right,” Although Vivika was a Warlock, she also agreed.

“The current strength of the mage world is very different from what it was in the past. But if I say that you have the power to rule the current mage world with Grimm’s Tower, would you believe it?”

Rule the world?

Eli’s eyes widened. No way, was it that exaggerated? Wasn’t it just a mage Tower?

“I know that teacher must think that it’s just a tower, how could it have such power?!” Vivika understood what Eli was feeling, and she sighed.

“But it seems to be the case. It’s really interesting. A tower left behind by the mage world could have the power to help one rule over the warlock world. That’s how weak we are compared to the mages back then.”

“Indeed,” Eli nodded. He was also a little curious about that era, but the past was in the past. He could only say that he had transmigrated a little too late.

Compared to that, he was more curious about the Tower.

If what Vivika said was true, this Tower was so powerful. It was no wonder that even if they were not sure whether the legend was true or not, it would still make the central main road send people to the relatively poor West Coast.

“Let’s talk about this tower. I’m curious about what kind of Tower can have such great power.” Eli took a sip of tea and needed some time to calm down.

Vivika nodded and said, “Legends are legends because there are many uncertainties.

“However, there were still some known facts. This Tower seemed to have once been the vehicle of an eighth-circle wizard, Grimm. Many people in the wizard World gathered to build it, but it seemed that this wizard had disappeared due to some accident, so his tower was left behind in this world.

“The legend says that the tower is huge!”

“Huge?”

“Yes, it’s very big!”

“How big?”

“Teacher, look out the window!” Vivika reminded him.

Eli looked outside. The sky was already a little dark, and the night was slowly falling. A full moon hung high in the sky, emitting bright moonlight.

What was he looking at?

He didn’t quite understand what Vivika meant, so he turned to look at her.

“The moon!” Vivika looked into Eli’s eyes and said in a low voice.

“The moon? You mean …” Eli’s eyes slowly widened, this meant …

“Teacher, you’re right.” Vivika gave Eli an affirmative look, pursed her lips, and said, ”

“Grimm’s Tower is said to be about the size of the moon!”
