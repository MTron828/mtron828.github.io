575 The Battle of the Three Sovereigns of the Sea Race

“Hmph, humans are nothing more than this!” Opposite him, the Deep Sea Demon Whale Emperor spoke.

“Oh? The former slaves of humans dared to be so presumptuous and even start a war. It seemed that the Mage Alliance was too kind to the Sea Tribe. What a pity!”

At this moment, a voice filled with disdain entered the ears of some people, and the entire battlefield seemed to freeze.

Who was it?

Who dared to speak like this?

“Who is it? Get out here!” The three royal families of the sea race were also furious. The Deep Sea Demon Whale Emperor looked around angrily and discovered that a figure stood not far away!

Who was it?

The gazes of the sea race gathered on this person.

“Sir Eli!”

However, compared to them, Alida was the first to call out his name.

The other Warlocks of the Bloodline Alliance looked at the scarlet wizard robe. It was none other than Eli. Even David shouted in surprise, “Teacher!”

“Eli?”

Kyle recognized him as well. After all, there were statues of him everywhere on the continent. It was hard not to recognize him!

Whoosh! Whoosh!

This made him relax a lot. Although he did not know why Eli had only shown up now, with him around, at least he should be safe. At the very least, he could run away now.

“Eli, let’s join forces and defeat them!” Kyle said loudly.

“Who are you?” Eli glanced at him strangely.

Kyle was speechless. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“I’m Kyle.” He gritted his teeth and said!

“Oh!” Eli nodded and ignored him. He looked at the three Seafolk and said, “Come at me together. Maybe then you’ll have a chance.”

Looking at Eli, who had completely ignored him, a wave of anger buried him.

One against three, who do you think you are?

” Eli, you’re too arrogant.” The three Kings of the Sea Tribe were also furious. Among them, the Black Turtle Emperor, who seemed to be the calmest, was actually the most irritable. He charged at Eli, and the runes on his body flickered as he used his sealing technique!

Looking at the mountain-like Black Turtle Emperor, Kyle immediately retreated without any intention of attacking.

“These Sea Race Sovereigns aren’t that easy to deal with!” He said hatefully, intending to see Eli make a fool of himself!

He was also very afraid of this sealing spell. Eli would also suffer.

However, to his surprise, when Eli saw the Black Turtle Emperor, he was pleasantly surprised, as if he had seen something good. “Oh, it’s a good sealing technique. It’s a perfect match with my sealing technique!”

The frivolous words made the Black Turtle Emperor furious.

This was the first human in so many years who dared to provoke it.

” Eli, I want you dead.” He attacked Eli.

Facing such a powerful attack, Ely waved his hand, and a boundless shadow instantly covered the sky. Then, it wrapped around the Demonic Turtle Emperor.

“You want to block the attack just like that?” In the distance, the Deep Sea Demon Whale Emperor laughed loudly.

“Is he crazy?” Kyle was also stunned.

He didn’t think that the fragile shadow could stop the Black Turtle Emperor’s attack.

But in the next second, he was stunned!

When the Black Turtle Emperor collided with the shadow, all of his power seemed to disappear without a trace. His aura was instantly absorbed by the shadow, especially the runes. They were all devoured bit by bit. As for his main body, it was entangled by countless shadows before shrinking and flying into Eli’s hand!

From start to finish, it was less than a second.

In the blink of an eye, a late-stage Black Turtle Sovereign fell into his hands.

As for Eli, he held the turtle shell and played with it as if he had encountered something joyful!

He didn’t expect that he would gain such a good thing when he just arrived!

However, this wasn’t a good time to study it. The war had to end.

Thinking of this, he looked at the two stunned Sea Tribe Sovereigns and waved his hand.

“Attack me together. Don’t waste time!”
