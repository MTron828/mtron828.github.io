327 The Truth of the Great Catastrophe

“Great catastrophe!”

It was the main culprit that led to the current sorcerer world.

Because of the great catastrophe, countless mages had to leave their homes. The once-powerful civilization was almost on the verge of falling apart, leaving only a few mages in the world.

The higher the level of a mage, the faster their life force would be consumed in the mage world.

!!

It was like a curse, a curse on this civilization.

Therefore, when Eli asked about the great catastrophe, even Nikola could not help but feel sluggish. His tone was a lot lower, and there was some sadness in his eyes!

He was a mage who had really experienced those years, and he had experienced the glory of the mage world. He could feel the terrifying downfall even more than Eli.

After a few minutes, he said, ” my Lord, the great catastrophe is too advanced. I only know a little, and it’s not complete.”

“Speak!”

Nikola took a deep breath and said, “As for the great catastrophe, it started when civilization was discovered.

“First of all, according to the practice of our Mage world, when we discover a new civilization, we usually send out an advance party to investigate. This time was no exception, but it was said that when the advance party returned, they all went crazy!”

“Crazy?” Eli asked.

“That’s right. They had all gone crazy. Their mental energy was contaminated, and they had lost their self-awareness!” Nikola sighed. “At that time, the mage world did not realize the problem with these people. After returning, they let these people go home. However, what no one expected was that this pollution was actually contagious, and it spread very quickly.

“By the time everyone realized it, those people had already infected close to 10000 people. They were also infected, and their mental power was greatly reduced. It was even difficult for them to use any spell.”

“How does the mage world deal with this? ” Eli asked.

“Isolation!

“The Mages directly activated a level-3 World warning, isolating all these people in a floating city and using the teleportation circle to solve the pollution problem. Under such high-intensity measures, the pollution has been effectively contained!”

“What happened after that?” Eli asked. Since they had managed to contain it, a huge catastrophe still happened later on. It seemed like there were still more variables!

“After that, something that no one expected happened.” Nikola’s eyes were full of fear, “a large number of contaminated mages have gathered in the floating city. No one expected that the contamination would deepen. In just three days, the contamination that had gathered together seemed to have completely exploded. Those mages have completely lost their minds. Their consciousness has collapsed, but they can still move.

“The other worlds believed that these infected mages were no longer sane and decided to use void exile to throw them into the endless void, but they encountered great resistance.

“In the end, the Mage Council overcame many obstacles and gave the order to banish them!”

Nikola explained while Eli listened quietly.

It seemed that the situation was not too bad so far!

“But when everyone arrived near the floating Sky Island, something unexpected happened.

“The floating island was no longer the same as before. Not only were the Mages, but even the buildings, items, and the island itself had been distorted.

“And as the distortion occurred, a passage was born. It wasn’t a physical passage, but a mental force passage.”

After saying this, Nikola paused for a few seconds before he continued, “the powerful great mages could feel that this place has become a mark, a mark of another world. Using this mark, another civilization has invaded the mage world. This is also the invasion of the mage world!”

Upon hearing these words, Eli was also shocked.

It was self-evident how powerful the mages were in the past. If this civilization dared to invade, it could be said that they were strong or courageous.

“And after that? What happened? ” Eli asked.

“After that, with the help of this mark, the creatures from that world descended upon the Mage world! I don’t know much about this, ” Nikola pursed his lips. “this is because the area they landed in was not on the West Coast.

“At that time, the powerful eighth-circle sorcerer directly separated that area from the rest of the world. However, because the connection had already been established, they attached themselves to the mage world, and the war happened there.”

“What about you?” Eli asked jokingly.

“Don’t make fun of me, master. I was only in the first circle and didn’t participate in the war. The information about the war was strictly confidential. Every year, thousands of Magi enter the war, but only a few return. If I went, you might not be able to see me!” Nikola said in a ridiculing tone.

“I see.” Realization dawned on Eli.

He was just saying that if a war really did break out, how could there be no traces of it? So it didn’t happen all over the mage world.

“What was the result of the war?” Eli asked.

“The result!” Nikola sighed with emotion.

“The war lasted for about ten years, and in the end, an unprecedented battle seemed to have broken out.

“The most powerful people of that world had also come here through the mark. It was said that the war had caused the sky to turn dark, and the entire mage world could see the effect of the war. The elemental tide that was caused lasted for a full month in the world.

“We won that war.

“The Supreme Being of that world fell. It was said that he was a terrifying existence at the peak of the eighth-circle, but we also suffered heavy losses. Two of our eighth-circle mages died.

“However, that Supreme Being used that mark as the price and all of his life as a sacrifice to do something. After that, a terrifying catastrophe occurred.

“That’s all I know.”

“The peak of eight circle? A Supreme Being? A mark? A great catastrophe?”

One by one, the names shocked Eli’s heart. He never thought that the story behind the great catastrophe would be so complicated and full of twists and turns and that it involved so many powerful people.

Eli could not calm down for a long time.

“Oh right, my Lord, there’s something you might be interested in!” Nikola said as if he had thought of something.

“Oh?” Eli’s eyes narrowed! Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Of the two fallen Lords, I don’t know about both of them, but one of them is called gray. He is the owner of Gray’s Wizard Tower, one of the top ten most powerful weapons in the mage World. It is also the wizard Tower that the warlocks are currently pursuing!” Nikola said.

“Oh?” Eli’s eyes lit up, and he immediately asked, “So, that Wizard Tower really exists?”

If it were confirmed, it would be a big deal.

“I don’t know about that. Anyway, the wizard Tower disappeared after the war.” Nikola shook his head, indicating that he did not know.

“I see!” Eli sighed, a little disappointed.

...

However, he was not depressed because he had already learned too much that day. If he had not experienced it himself, he would not have known this information.

Of course, there were many things that Nikola did not know.

For example, the name of the civilization, the specific creatures, who the strongest person was, and their specific information, what kind of war broke out in the area that was taken away, and most important thing was how the curse affected the mage world and caused the war.

These were all things he didn’t know about. There were still many things that were unknown about this history.

“Then, is there anything else you would like to ask? If not, I’ll take my leave.” Nikola asked.

“Okay, I’ll send you off.”

“Thank you, my Lord.”

Soon, Eli sent Nikola out of the secret realm.

On the way back, Eli saw Hill. Passing by Hydra, he also saw Doggo, who was still modifying himself.

But this time, he looked at Doggo with curiosity.

That was whether Doggo was really related to that Magus tower and how did he come to the West Coast.

...

However, there was no answer to this question.

Eli glanced at him and left.

He had gained too much today, but not only did he not get any new answers, but he also had more doubts. Unfortunately, he had to take the initiative to find the answers to these questions, and they were not on the West Coast.

“The central continent?”

Eli closed his eyes.

He would go, but not now.

A few seconds later, he opened his eyes and walked toward the laboratory.

In the distance, Doggo raised his head and glanced at Eli.

Blue light flashed in the mechanical eyes.
