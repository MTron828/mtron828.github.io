416 The Heart of the Abyss

“What’s wrong?”

Eli looked at Vivika and asked curiously. It seemed that something big had really happened!

” Eli, Brother Eli. ” Vivikapanted heavily, her hand on the door at the side. It took her more than ten seconds to come back to her senses. She raised her head and shouted at Ely,” This morning, the patriarch of the Eight-Armed Naga, Jesse, issued an order to attack the Bloodline Tower in three days. ”

Eli raised his eyebrows.

!!

Ever since the battle at Nightfall City, he had not heard of the Eight-Armed Naga.

And from some sources, it seemed that because of the loss of the Radiant Sun Warlocks, a few forces had even launched a new round of attacks on the Eight-Armed Naga. But in less than a year, the Eight-Armed Naga had returned?! This didn’t feel right!

Eli frowned and said to Vivika, “Vivika, go get Glen and Liliana.”

” Alright, Brother Eli! ” Vivikanodded and was about to walk out, but she was stopped by Eli.

“No need, they’re here!” Eli raised his head, and as if he had seen through time and space, he could see beyond the Grassi Valley.

Outside the valley, two people were waiting. It was Glen and Liliana.

…..

Ten minutes later!

In a room on the top floor of the Mage Tower.

Eli and Vivika sat on one side while Liliana and Glen sat on the other.

“Tell me the details,” Eli asked Glen.

“Alright.” Glen nodded. His condition was much better than before. He paused and said, “Milord, I only received the news not long ago.

“However, according to our information, just yesterday, the Eight-Armed Naga’s enemy, Holy Tower, took the initiative to retreat from the Eight-Armed Naga’s territory. Even the other forces in the other regions seemed to have received some order and retreated one after another. After that, the Eight-Armed Naga quickly adjusted its forces.

“This morning, Jesse, the head of the Eight-Armed Naga, announced to the public that he would pay the Bloodline Tower in blood for the death of Ma Mu in Nightfall City!

“We even received a letter from the Eight-Armed Naga an hour ago. The letter said, said.”

Glen gritted his teeth as if he found it difficult to speak. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“What did he say?” Eli asked with a frown.

” The Bloodline Tower only has two choices now. One is for you to commit suicide and hand over the Bloodline Tower to the Eight-Armed Naga Family. The other is for them to completely destroy the Bloodline Tower and then kill you! ”

Hearing this, no one said anything. Only Vivika said angrily, “Ah, what a detestable Eight-Armed Naga!”

Liliana frowned when she saw Vivika’s expression.

As for Eli, he was frowning. He wasn’t angry at Jesse’s trash talk. He was just curious why so many factions had retreated in just one day.

This was not something that the Eight-Armed Naga could do.

There must be something that he didn’t know about, so he turned to Liliana.

“Liliana, do you know what happened? ” Eli asked directly.

Liliana seemed to understand something. She nodded and said, “I know a little!”

Vivika was speechless.

What do you know?

Glen, who was in charge of the organization, also looked at Liliana. He knew that the person in charge of the Charm Mansion was much more well-informed than them!

Liliana didn’t hide anything. She brushed her long purple hair aside and said,” This matter seems to have been interfered with by the Heart of the Abyss! ”

“What? How could it be the Heart of the Abyss?” Glen’s mouth was wide open as he said in a dumbfounded manner.

Even Eli frowned.

Only Vivikawas dumbfounded. She did not understand what the Heart of Abyss was.

” What is the Heart of Abyss? ” she asked curiously.

Eli did not speak, but Glen did. He explained with an ugly expression, “The Heart of the Abyss is the most powerful faction in the western region of the central continent. It’s located in the southern part of the western region and occupies the entire southern region. It’s a very powerful faction even in the entire central continent.

“If the Eight-Armed Naga is considered a second-class force, then the Heart of the Abyss should be considered a first-class force. It’s not on the same level as the other forces in the western region!”

“So strong?” Vivika’s eyes widened in surprise.

” Yes, it was the Heart of the Abyss that was mediating the conflict between these forces. It was also them who made the forces temporarily put down the battle! ” Liliana added.

As soon as he finished speaking, the few of them immediately felt the atmosphere turn silent, especially Glen’s eyes, which were filled with deep worry.

” What’s the relationship between the Heart of Abyss and the Eight-Armed Naga?” asked Eli. He didn’t look worried.

Seeing how calm he was, the others calmed down, especially Liliana, who covered her mouth and laughed. She joked, “Actually, there’s no need for everyone to worry too much!

“As far as we know, the Heart of the Abyss and the Eight-Armed Naga have no obvious relationship. The Heart of the Abyss has never directly intervened in the wars between the forces of the Western Region, but occasionally, in order to regulate the stability of the Western Region, it will intervene in the battles of some forces as a mediator.

“As the guardian of the Demonic Abyss, the Heart of the Abyss has no time to pay attention to this!”

Eli nodded, indicating that he understood.

In fact, the reason why the Heart of the Abyss rarely appeared in the northern part of the Western Regions was because of the Demonic Abyss!

As for the term ” Demonic Abyss, ” Eli first learned of it from Udo, who had returned from the West Coast. Eli learned that the Demonic Abyss was actually connected to the underground of the Mage World. It used to be the connection between the mage world and the demonic world World. It was a powerful large world, but later the demonic world’s contact was lost after the mages left.

The passage had closed, but there were still many Abyssal Creatures left in the Abyss. This was the origin of the Demonic Abyss. The Heart of the Abyss was responsible for suppressing the Demonic Abyss, so it usually paid attention to the stability of the Western Regions!

So maybe this was just a coincidence.

However, Eli had a feeling that it was not that simple. He felt that there must be something going on!

Perhaps the connection between the two forces was deeper than he had imagined!

Of course, regardless of the relationship between the two forces, Eli still had to solve the problem of the Eight-Armed Naga.

...

He wasn’t too sure about the Heart of the Abyss, but he couldn’t possibly think that Jesse would start a war for no reason.

Eli pursed his lips. As a top-notch second-class force, he probably had a lot of things!

Perhaps there was information about the Fifth Ring.

And there was another important factor. The box that Natasha, the tower master of the West Coast, found should be in the north of the Western Region. After all, it was likely to be in the range of the Heart of the Abyss. He was still thinking about Dylan, and he had not forgotten the existence of the Gray Wizard Tower!

At the thought of this, Eli felt his blood boiling, and his eyes gradually lit up!

‘Hurry up, I can’t wait.’

Looking at Eli’s eyes, which were gradually brightening up, the Warlocks looked at each other. Why did he feel a little happy that they had met an enemy?

The enemy was the Eight-Armed Naga Family!
