179 The Sudden Attack

In the Tower.

Eli looked at the die of fate in front of him and smiled.

The appearance was similar to a normal die. It had six sides, but the color was dark gold. The dots were eye-catching gold, which was very beautiful.

He had spent almost 10000 magic stones on the materials for the die, but it was worth it. With this, he might not need to spend so much effort on some things.

“Let’s try it out.”

Eli thought and pondered as he cast his gaze toward the street outside the window.

“Within five minutes, there will be five or more first-circle warlocks passing by!”

It was just a random thought.

At the same time, a complicated spell model began to spin in Eli’s mind. It was different from the structure of ordinary spell models. This spell model seemed to be layered, and a mysterious aura also spread out.

There was also a price to pay. Eli could feel the life force in his body rapidly draining away. In the blink of an eye, almost thirty years had passed.

The die spun in the air, and his life force was rapidly lost.

Three seconds later, the die stopped spinning and showed a six.

“Six? That’s not very likely.” Eli put away the die.

The street in front of his tower was a remote area and generally speaking, there were very few first-circle warlocks who would pass by. This was even more so for now.

He wanted to see how many would pass by.

In the blink of an eye, a minute had passed.

Not a single one.

After two minutes, there was still nothing.

Three minutes.

No, there wasn’t.

Not even four minutes.

Time passed by slowly. Eli furrowed his brows and started to doubt his life. Could it be that there was a problem with his prediction? He had spent almost 50 years of his life!

Four minutes and thirty seconds, forty seconds, fifty seconds.

Time passed by seconds. Eli frowned. The situation was not what he had believed.

Suddenly, there was a loud noise. Eli turned his head and saw that outside his Tower, at the end of the intersection not far away, more than a dozen first-circle warlocks were fully armed and running towards the camp exit. They passed through this place in the blink of an eye.

Eli looked at the time again. Four minutes and fifty-eight seconds.

There was no mistake. Eli revealed a relaxed smile.

However, something must have happened for so many first-circle warlocks to leave in such a hurry.

..

On the same day.

It turned out that the war had entered a new peak, so the White Tower had also sent out a large number of warlocks, which was a normal phenomenon.

Eli wasn’t nervous either. He handled the allocation of resources as usual, and during his break time, he went to various parts of the camp to test the accuracy of the Dice.

Especially in the casino, holding the die of fate allowed Eli to win almost every battle. This made him confirm that the die was indeed very useful, of course, if one did not consider the thousands of years of life that he had spent.

It was a pretty good tool, but it was a bit of a waste of life.

..

In the blink of an eye, two months had passed.

The war between the two forces seemed to have begun to slow down as if the war was about to end.

Most of the warlocks of the White Tower also began to slowly return to the White Tower to recover and heal their wounds. The Blood Alliance was the same, leaving the battlefield and returning to their forces.

Eli was in charge of the allocation of resources, and he was also very confused about some things during the process.

This was because the allocation of resources allowed him to learn a lot of news about the front line. According to them, it seemed that after the recent dispute, the upper echelons of the blood Alliance had not shown their faces again, as if they had hidden away.

Also, the Blood Alliance was clearly stronger than them, but they ended the war so rashly. Eli originally thought that the war might last for more than ten years, but it ended in two years.

He didn’t take it to heart and started working normally.

..

A month passed in the blink of an eye.

Ross watched the last batch of supplies being transported back to the White Tower and smiled.

The war was finally over.

He turned his head to look outside the White Tower. The dark forest was as quiet as usual. He turned his head and was about to enter the forest when suddenly, a noise came.

Suddenly, seven or eight venom Wyverns flew out of the forest, carrying nearly a dozen two-circle warlocks. What shocked him was that there were dark shadows moving in the forest, as if there were a large number of warlocks.

Ross’s eyes widened, but he still immediately hid and glanced at the top of the venom Wyvern.

“That’s Pabulo!”

As a representative of the White Tower, he was no stranger to the main figures of the Blood Alliance. The others were also second and first circle warlocks of blood alliance, and there were a few warlocks that he had not seen before.

“We’re done for! How did they get here?” Ross was completely dumbfounded.

This was the center of the White Tower. How did they arrive here without anyone knowing?

But the next second, he realized another problem. With so many people, how could White Tower resist?

“What do we do?” Ross was in despair. Looking at the venom Wyvern flying past him, he immediately sent a message to Eli.

..

On the other side.

Eli was doing an experiment in the arcane realm when he suddenly received Ross’s message.

“The people from the Blood Alliance have sneaked into this place. All of the second and first circle warlocks have been mobilized, and there are also a large number of apprentices.”

Eli was speechless.

F * ck!

What was going on?

“This…” Eli was stunned for a few seconds. This was too sudden, wasn’t it? However, he immediately realized something. If this was true, what should he do?

“Run!” Eli instantly left the arcane realm and packed his things.

It was so dangerous that he had to leave this place as soon as possible.

As for the White Tower, what did it have to do with him?

Realizing that danger was coming, Eli felt like he had to abandon everything.

However, just as he walked out of the room and looked out the window, the scene that greeted his eyes made him numb.

Under the setting sun, a huge energy shield had already enveloped the area within a few kilometers of the White Tower. There was no time to escape.

“Damn it!” Eli gritted his teeth.

It seemed like the Blood Alliance was well prepared this time. He couldn’t run, but was he going to fight?

But could he defeat so many warlocks?

“What’s going on? ” Eli frowned. It had been too long since he had fought a battle of the same level. He was no longer sure how strong he was. Thus, he took out his die.

“What’s the probability of me defeating all the warlocks who came?”

Eli threw the die, and his lifespan was quickly consumed.

A few seconds later, Eli fell silent.

Looking at the six in front of him, he sucked in a cold breath.

“Am I that strong? What? ” Eli had a strange expression.

He was just a Peak 2nd circle warlock and a 2nd circle wizard. Of course, he also had tens of thousands of skeletons, hundreds of one-time-use explosive items, and dozens of defensive wizard tools in the secret plane. He was indeed different from an ordinary wizard.

But … Was this enough?

Eli rubbed his chin and fell into deep thought.

It seemed that he had been hiding for too long and had almost forgotten that he was actually very strong.

“Ah, then let’s fight,” Eli said.

He strode out of the secret realm.

Today, he was going to show them what he was made up.

..

The tall Magus tower had collapsed, and the bustling Commercial Street had been destroyed.

A large number of blood alliance warlocks were wantonly destroying everything in sight, and the White Tower warlocks were ambushed so suddenly that they could not organize a normal counterattack, not to mention that not all warlocks were present.

It was too sudden.

To White Tower, everything was too sudden. No one had thought that such a thing would happen.

“Herman, get out here!” He shouted.

At this moment, a Warlock tore apart a one-circle Warlock and then shouted to the surroundings.

Sores revealed a sinister smile. It had been sixty years, and he had finally come to the inside of the White Tower. While the others were fighting with the main force, he had come out ahead of time to find Herman.

“Do you know where Herman is?” He grabbed a Warlock apprentice and said with an embarrassed expression.

“Ah … It’s in that direction.” The apprentice who was caught was in pain. One of his arms had already disappeared.

“Thank you, ” Sores nodded and tore the man in half.

Then, he frantically flew in that direction.

Today was the day the White Tower would be destroyed.

It was also the day he killed the enemy who had killed his grandson. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Herman!”

As he moved quickly, Sores was like a Mad Dog.
