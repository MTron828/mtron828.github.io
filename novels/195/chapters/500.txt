501 The Conflict in the Core Area of Greenfield

Hiss!

Eli gasped.

He looked at Dylan, then at the key in his hand. Pursing his lips, he said in disbelief, “You’re not going to tell me that this is the key to the Gray Mage Tower, are you?”

“Yes.” Dylan nodded affirmatively.

“Eh!” The corner of Eli’s mouth twitched!

Good lord, he was only here to look for clues, but now he had a key.

This development surprised Eli.

While Eli was in a daze, Dylan told his story.

” At the end of that great battle, my teacher gave me the key and sent me away from the battlefield. However, the impact of the battlefield was much greater than I imagined. I was greatly corrupted, and in the end, I had no choice but to abandon that mechanical body and replace it with this one.

“However, in order to preserve the information and to prevent me from being affected again, I still sent myself to the West Coast and asked the dark Mages who were leaving to remove my memories to avoid contamination.”

“Contamination? Are the invading species that terrifying?” Instead of asking about the key, Eli changed the topic.

“Yes.” Dylan nodded bitterly and said, “I’m only at the edge of the battlefield. I didn’t even come into contact with the creature. Even though I’m a machine, I was also corrupted. I had no choice but to abandon my body and even that part of my memories. That’s why my previous memories were so incomplete.”

It seemed that the cursed dark civilization was more dangerous than he had imagined!

“Alright, it seems like you’ve experienced more than I thought.” Eli nodded and turned his gaze back to the key. “Tell me about this key.”

“Sir, I’ve already told you about the key’s origin. The function of this key is to sense the specific location of Gray Wizard Tower and obtain the final authority.” Dylan explained.

“So you mean that we can enter that place now?” Eli asked curiously.

“Of course,” Dylan nodded and said,” But you have to think carefully, sir. Once it is activated, if it is still in the Warlock World, then everyone will notice it. There are also many mechanical creations left behind inside, and there is no lack of powerful mechanical creations. More importantly, you have to at least walk to the center and insert the key to obtain authority.

“Although my teacher gave me the key, no one knows what happened in that war, whether the Tower still existed, or whether it was still in the warlock World.

“After saying so much, does my lord still want to open it?”

The more he listened, the tighter his frown became. In the end, Eli shook his head.

It was fine if the tower wasn’t in the warlock. If it were, it would be a big trouble.

Exposing the Mage Tower would definitely attract the attention of many forces, which was not in line with his personality. Moreover, it would definitely be very dangerous to enter, so why would he go?

“Forget it, forget it. We’ll talk about it in the future.” Eli said regretfully.

“Alright then. Please keep the key safe.” Dylan smiled and handed the key to Eli. He knew that Eli would make such a decision. His Excellency was really careful!

Eli didn’t refuse.

It was better to carry this thing with him.

“Oh. One more thing…”

“What?” Eli was puzzled.

“The legends left behind are true. With the power of that Mage Tower, it is really enough to rule the world today.” Dylan chuckled.

“Then let’s wait for the future.”

Eli smiled.

His will to resist temptation was strong enough. His life was more precious than anything else.

..

Time flew by.

Three months later!

Although the discovery of Dylan’s identity and the clues to the Gray Tower were significant, the impact was still quite limited. After all, they were all kept secret. The only people who knew about it were Eli, Nikola, and Dylan.

This was more like a hope for the future than the present.

Of course, it wasn’t that nothing major had happened in the past few days. It was just that the Warlock Union seemed to have caused some conflicts between the Hamis family and other families, resulting in the withdrawal of aid to Eli.

He had secretly learned about it from Jin Ji, and it seemed to be related to the information about the ruins.

It was also at this time that Eli suddenly found out about the details of the eastern region ruins and was immediately shocked.

So he immediately asked Dylan, “Yes, that should be my senior brother and also Gray’s son. Back then, my teacher gave me the key in the end, but perhaps he had already made preparations!” Dylan thought for a moment and replied.

Upon hearing this, Eli suddenly felt a sense of urgency.

If they were to discover the location of the Mage Tower or some news about Dylan, it would be extremely bad news for Eli.

Eli and Dylan looked at each other as if they could see a thorny problem.

” Eli, give me all those mechanical creations. I used to be at the fourth circle, but I’m already at half-step fifth circle. As long as I have enough materials and a body, I can recover my former strength. I think I need to be stronger.” Dylan said.

“Good!”

Eli nodded.

“Eli, you have to become stronger as soon as possible. Advance to the fifth circle as soon as possible. When we reach the fifth circle, we might be able to go to Gray’s mage tower.” Dylan was also getting anxious.

Eli didn’t answer, but his gaze deepened.

It seemed that he would have to search for ways to quickly advance to the fifth circle.

The current situation really made him feel a sense of urgency.

Soon, he began to read through the information and collect resources to advance to the fifth circle through various channels. However, he was soon disappointed because there were almost no laws that were comprehended particularly quickly. They all required time.

Anyone who broke through the fifth circle quickly had a deep understanding of the laws. Although Ely’s understanding was not shallow, he had just advanced. It was a bit of a fantasy for him to break through directly.

“Looks like this matter still needs to be discussed at length. Perhaps I can try using a large amount of law energy to reveal the Law of Shadow completely. After that…” This was the best solution he could think of.

“That’s it.”

Eli immediately decided to take action, but just as he entered the mage tower, his footsteps suddenly stopped, and his brows gradually furrowed.

A few seconds later, he pursed his lips and said calmly, “A little trouble, but also an opportunity for me.

“Perhaps I can find an opportunity and method to break through.”

In the next second, Eli closed his eyes and opened them again.

The scene changed, and he had already arrived in an exquisite palace. He was wearing a loose wizard robe and sitting on the throne in the center.

He turned his head and saw Erwin smiling at him.

Looking down, the Moon Elven Priest lowered her head and said respectfully, “Lord Roland, due to the war with the Bloodline Tower, the other foreign races were affected. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“In the core area, besides the Dragon Clan, there was also the Dwarf Clan. The other three core clans, the Moon God Toad Clan, the Sun Bird Clan, and the Blood Moon Demonic Tiger Clan, had joined forces and decided to attack us. They were already on their way.”

“Alright.”

Eli smiled. This was what had delayed him just now.

The continuous conflicts and changes finally made the Green Field understand their situation, and the choice they made was to fight Roland to the death!

One battle would decide everything.

“I hope they can give me some surprises!”

Eli narrowed his eyes. As a race in the core area and once the core servants of the mages, there might be something he needed in their treasure vault.

Moreover…

It was time to unify the green fields.
