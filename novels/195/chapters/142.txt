The warehouse was located halfway up the mountain behind the Department. It was a space dug out from the middle of the mountain for storage. Although there were many things inside, most of them were worthless.

This was because the explorers would take away the valuable things and not leave anything valuable for Eli. Of course, this was only for warlocks. There could still be some stuff that mages could use.

At the foot of the mountain.

The corners of Eli’s mouth twitched as he watched Paul take out a bunch of keys from his waist and skillfully open the door that was locked with iron chains.

This was the first time he had seen such a simple gate since he came to the camp. Whether it was the potion or demon plant divisions, not only were there all kinds of spell formations but there were also warlocks patrolling. However, not only was there no one guarding this place, but they actually used such a weak door.

!!

“Isn’t this protective measure a little too careless?” Eli asked after taking a deep breath.

Paul was puzzled for a moment, then said, ” but there’s nothing of value in the storage. Most of them are useless trash.

Eli, “…”

Fine, it seemed that he had overestimated this Department.

“Alright, I’ll go in and take a look.” Shaking his head, Eli followed Paul into the open door.

Using a simple zero-circle spell, the entire space was instantly illuminated.

In front of him was a huge space. The ground area was about the size of a football field, and the height was about ten meters. There were shelves on both sides of the space with all kinds of items on them.

Rather than a warehouse, it was more like a garbage dump.

“My Lord, these are all the items. If my Lord has taken a fancy to anything, just take it. There are no records of these items, and no one cares.” Paul reminded him.

“Yes, yes.” Eli nodded and walked inside.

“Eh, this is?” Just as he walked to the first shelf, the items on it surprised him.

On the third level of the shelf, there was an item that looked like a Monocle with a golden frame. On the other end was a chain, which looked interesting.

“master, this was dug out from a ruin. It was left behind by a mage. It seems to be an object used to observe soul fluctuations. Unfortunately, it seems to be connected to mental strength and can only be used by mages. It might have had some value in the past, but no one needs it now.”

Eli blinked.

He observed the soul fluctuations.

This seemed to be exactly what he needed for his experiment!

“It looks pretty good, so I’ll take it.”

Eli took it away.

Paul nodded. It didn’t matter.

After taking the glasses away, Eli continued to search inside. He had thought that the stuff here would be good, but he realized that he was completely wrong. There was almost nothing here. The glasses from before might already be the most valuable thing here.

Eli was a little disappointed.

“We still have to go further in. If we go further in, there are some books that used to be written by mages. They basically introduce the mage world and other things.” Paul kept talking as he walked, telling Eli about all sorts of things here.

“Oh?”

Upon hearing this, Eli’s interest was piqued again.

At the end of the warehouse, there were all kinds of books piled up on the ground. Some looked like they had been bitten open by bugs, and many of the remaining ones were rotten.

Damn it, didn’t this group of warlocks know how to properly preserve their books?

“Paul, find a few people to sort out the books and send them to me. I’ll take a look at them. I’ll get rid of the trash.” Eli frowned as if he was a little displeased with this pile.

“Alright. I also think it’s time to pack up. These books are such trash.” Paul nodded, then he suddenly felt a chill behind him.

He turned to look at Eli, who was still smiling kindly.

“Strange…” Paul commented curiously.

“Well, that’s it then. I’ll come here once in a while in the future, and you’ll still be in charge of this place.” nodded Eli.

“Yes, Minister.” Paul smiled.

After settling the department’s matters, Eli’s life returned to normal.

Everything was developing in a good direction, and it seemed like life was going back to normal.

He would go to the potions Department for half an hour every day, and then he would do experiments at home.

The gold-rimmed glasses were also of great help to Eli.

…

In the laboratory.

Another blood bamboo flower was placed in.

As the instrument was activated, a few elemental particles penetrated the blood bamboo flower. In a state of extreme speed, a mysterious fluctuation appeared once again, directly sucking the blood in the blood bamboo flower dry. However, the fluctuation was constantly observed by Eli.

“So it’s like this!”

Under the lens was another world. The moment the fluctuation appeared, Eli saw that the bamboo flower first produced a rapid frequency, then a dozen small fluctuations, and finally produced that power.

This was also the first time that Eli felt that he was so close to this devouring power.

However, even though he was getting closer, the experiment seemed to take longer than Eli had expected. The main reason was that the frequency was too long, but it was also too fast. If he were to analyze everything, it might take a long time.

“So, everything has to be overturned?”

The corner of Eli’s mouth twitched. After today’s observation, he realized that his previous train of thought was completely wrong. He originally thought that the power fluctuation was just a wave, but he didn’t expect it to be a dozen short segments put together. It was completely wrong.

He had to start from the beginning. Decades of hard work had been shattered in a single day. If it were any other first-circle mage, they would probably vomit blood. But Eli shook his head and began to arrange the direction of the experiment again.

It would only take a few decades to rectify a mistake.

Anyway, he didn’t expect this to be solved in the short term.

Eli’s gaze gradually became determined. This was also his advantage. In an infinite amount of time, the cost of his trial and error would be infinitely reduced, and time would always be on his side.

…

Paul had also sent all the books over to Eli.

Eli began to read.

40% of the books were damaged and unreadable, the remaining 50% were basically general knowledge, and the remaining 10% were scattered knowledge that was very fragmented.

The first thing that Eli looked at was the science section, which basically introduced some places in the mage World, the world’s geography, or the enemies from other worlds that they had encountered.

He read with great interest. It was at this moment that he realized how powerful the Mages were. Many other worlds had submitted to them, and they even had the title of slave owner of the endless world.

However, such a huge civilization suddenly changed more than 4000 years ago. The mages who had the ability left the mage world, and the ones who did not have the ability stayed. As a result, it developed into the world today.

One of the logs had such a passage that attracted Eli’s attention.

“This is a terrifying ***. We’re not their match. We’ve lost.”

What was ***?

The time in this log was about the time the mages had escaped.

What had they encountered?

A world with many seven-circles mages had suddenly collapsed.

“Forget it. This isn’t something I can worry about for now.” Eli shook his head and continued to flip through the books on other topics.

As for the other books, most of them were short, but they also gave Eli some new ideas.

In short, it was the right decision for Eli to come to this Department.

…

Time slowly passed.

This morning.

As usual, Eli went to the office of the magical plants Department.

He lay on the recliner and read the reports from the past few days.

Rona was also sitting on a sofa not far away, drinking tea. Time was peaceful.

On the other side, Rawls was sitting in a chair, seriously dealing with all kinds of things in the magic herb field and actively making arrangements. Next to him, Erdo was also constantly flipping through documents.

For a moment, the entire office was filled with two different images.

Erdo was busy with his work, occasionally looking at Rona with envy.

Rawls also kept his eyes on the documents, but when he saw that Eli had already prepared to leave, he couldn’t hold it in anymore.

“Eli, you’re leaving again?”

“Yeah, it’s time to get off work!” Eli glanced at Rawls.

“Then why don’t you carefully check the properties of the magic medicine field, the spraying of various nutrients, and other matters?”

“No need, I’ve already made arrangements.” Eli glanced at Rawls, baffled.

“Um.” Rawls was at a loss for words. He said, ” you’re so careless. I forgot to tell you that I’ve already told battalion commander Kratos. If you’re bad at this job, I’ll definitely make you leave this Department.

“Planting magic herbs is more than just reading reports. I suggest you practice more instead of sitting here. I go out to the fields every day. What about you? ”

???

Eli glanced at Rawls. ‘I’ve been farming for more than a hundred years, and I still need you to teach me?’

Eli shrugged and left without a care.

Rona was also very surprised that their Minister was so brave, but he immediately followed.

Rawls’ mouth kept twitching.

What do you mean by ‘Oh’? Does he not care about me at all?

Beside him, Erdo also opened his mouth wide. However, when he saw Rawls looking over, he immediately lowered his head.

“Erdo, bring me all the information on the magic herb field today. I’m going to study it and redistribute the planting modules to increase the production.”

The corner of Erdo’s mouth twitched. Big brother, can you not work so hard? He had not left this place for more than a month.

“Hmph, when the production result is out, we’ll know who’s more suitable for this place,” Rawls said angrily as he glanced at Eli’s back.

How can you slack off at work?

This was a betrayal of the commander’s trust in them.Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎
