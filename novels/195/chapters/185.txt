186 Traces of the Undead

Three days later.

Eli walked out of the Tower and walked on the street that led to the outside world.

One by one, the warlocks brushed past the street. No one greeted him. Too many people had died that year, and in addition, Eli rarely showed his face in recent years. So, although some warlocks knew that the White Tower had a powerful honorary member, very few people knew who he was.

Eli was very happy about this. The fewer people who knew him, the better.

Keeping a low profile was the best protection.

He passed through a few streets and came to the tall white Tower. In the White Tower, Eli saw Kratos.

“Are you going to leave for a while?” Kratos asked in surprise.

“Yes, I need to go out for a while.” Eli nodded.

“Sure.” Kratos nodded in agreement.

Although he was still a representative, Eli was also one of the core members of the White Tower at the moment, and his authority was no less than his. Rather than a request, it was more like a notification.

“Well, since you’re going out, it seems that there’s a new trace of an undead in the Knight Kingdom in the South. The leader is a second-circle undead. If you have time, you can take a look. It might be the undead that was related to the shadow lizard Warlock camp back then!” Kratos said.

“Okay, I’ll take a look if I have time!” Hearing this, Eli nodded.

Upon hearing this news, Eli’s interest was piqued. One had to know that he was still holding a wisp of this undead’s soul in his hand. He was looking forward to meeting him, of course, after he had settled the matters at the camp.

“Alright, I’m relieved to hear that.” Kratos nodded.

“Then I’ll be leaving.” Eli nodded, then turned around and left.

..

Five days later.

Kerna mountains.

Eli stood on a mountain peak and looked into the distance.

In the mountains not far away, on top of a huge mountain, Mage towers rose from the ground. From the foot of the mountain to the peak, one could feel the traces of Mages.

Not only were there many elemental spell formations around the mountain, but there were also acolytes patrolling the area at all times. This was the current iris’ campsite, one of the largest campsites in the South of the West Coast.

“What a great change.”

Even Eli couldn’t help but exclaim at the changes the camp had undergone in the past hundred years.

In the past, there were only a few mage Towers here, and the number of mages was only in the tens or hundreds. Now, there were thousands of them. Although they could not be compared to the Warlock forces, it was already very impressive.

Of course, this was not unrelated to his efforts.

After a brief observation, Eli transformed into Roland and walked straight into the camp.

In less than a minute, someone had discovered him.

A few apprentices from the patrol team looked at him seriously.

“Call Tijie out and tell her that I am here.” This time, Eli didn’t tell Tijie about his return.

“Roland? You’re Lord Roland.” The apprentices were shocked as they looked at the strange man.

Although the person in charge of the campsite was lady Tijie, everyone knew that the real owner of the campsite was a wizard named Roland. Not only was he powerful, but he also provided a large number of resources for the campsite. The only problem was that this Lord had not appeared for almost a hundred years, and some people even suspected that he was dead.

“Yes.” Eli nodded.

“Sir, please wait a moment. We’ll inform the others right away.” The apprentices panicked, and one of them ran into the camp.

Eli stood there calmly and waited.

Three minutes later.

A large number of people walked out from the forest in front of them. More than a dozen first-circle Magi surrounded the second-circle Tijie.

“My Lord, why have you returned?” Tijie hurriedly walked in front of Eli and respectfully asked,

“the seal has succeeded. I naturally have to come back to see it,” Replied Eli with a smile.

“Let’s return to the camp and talk. I can also tell you about the current development of the camp.”

Just like that, Tijie led Eli back to the camp. The other mages were looking at Eli curiously, wondering what kind of mage he was.

They quickly returned to the camp.

Both sides of the street were filled with people, looking at Eli.

Eli didn’t pay any attention to them as he was led all the way to the tallest Tower in the camp.

In the study room, Eli was sitting on the chair while Tijie was reporting to him.

“master, there’s one mage in the second circle, 15 in the first circle, 400 apprentices, and about 500 ordinary people.”

“Hmm, what about the resources?” Eli asked, nodding.

“At the moment, the internal resources of the camp mainly rely on planting some magical plants, hunting magical beasts, and collecting some natural resources from the mountain behind us. The external resources are mainly supported by Lord Eli.” Tijie quickly explained the current situation at the campsite.

“yes, it’s still alright. It’s mainly a regional problem. It’s more or less inconvenient to be in the mountains.” Eli nodded.

“Anyway, this is the current situation of the camp. Sir has come this time for the second seal. Regarding this, the current train of thought is very clear. It is based on one of Sir’s ideas.

“The first seal was about the bloodline, but the second one was about mental power. We’ve basically succeeded, but the last part is up to you, Sir.”

“Alright.”

Eli was very satisfied. After decades of hard work by hundreds of mages, it was finally almost done. As for the last part of the content, he had to rely on himself, because he had only given the camp part of the content, the core knowledge was still himself.

Soon, with Tijie’s introduction, Eli quickly familiarized himself with the various aspects of the camp and met the newly promoted mages.

It was mainly about the exchange of knowledge. Most of the mages had gained a lot, and they were also shocked by the knowledge that Roland had learned.

...

After he was done with that, Eli finally saw all the information about the second seal.

“It’s just as I thought. I’ll still rely on the devouring rune before digging deeper.”

Eli looked at the information and fell into deep thought.

All in all, this seal was actually from the first seal, so there had to be some similarities. The only difference was that the first seal involved a bloodline transformation, while this one was a mental power transformation.

One involved a physical body, while the other was relatively illusory.

That was why it took so long to set up.

And what Eli had to do was to assemble the results of the camp and carve them into his body.

“Looks like I’ll have to stay here for a while.”

Eli pursed his lips, but his eyes were burning. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Once he had this new seal, his mental power breakthrough to the second circle would be much easier.

However, the last part wasn’t simple either. Fortunately, he already had an idea. The next step was to spend time on it.

...

..

Three years later.

Outside the laboratory, Tijie passed by the campsite’s laboratory.

Looking at the tightly shut door, she revealed a helpless expression. Half a year ago, Eli had entered this laboratory and never showed up again. She had no idea what was going on.

‘I wonder how long it will take?’

All of a sudden, the door opened slowly and a figure walked out with a faint smile on her face.

“Lord Roland, have you succeeded? ”

Tijie was surprised as she looked at Eli who walked out. Everything else was the same as three years ago. The only difference was that there were now two rings on Eli’s arms instead of one.

“Yes, it’s a success,” Eli nodded.

Looking at the rings on his arm, even the usually calm Eli couldn’t help but feel a little excited. After decades of hard work, he had finally reaped the rewards today.

“Go, bring me one of the prisoners on death row from the camp’s prison.” Eli immediately turned to say to Tijie.

“Yes!”
