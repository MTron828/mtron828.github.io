369 Jin Ji and Luo Ye

At the door, the two of them met Alida, who was waiting for them.

“Alida, help your grandfather,” Eli said to Alida.

“Alright,” Alida hurried up to support Glen.

Thus, the three of them walked toward the back of Bloodline City.

The further they went, the fewer buildings there were, and the more winding the road became. Finally, Glen stopped a few kilometers behind the Bloodline Tower.

“Milord, it’s in front.” Glen pointed forward.

Eli looked in that direction and saw a wide path suddenly appear in the mountains. The path led to a valley. Before entering, Eli could already feel a dense aura of life.

“Interesting!” Eli narrowed his eyes.

Suddenly, he heard a swishing sound in their ears. He turned his head and found nothing.

“Did something happen, my lord?” Glen and Alida looked over.

“I’m fine!” Eli shook his head.

After observing for a while, Eli was not a sound from the outside. It seemed that it could only be from Eli’s Mystic Realm.

Eli’s consciousness entered the secret realm and saw that Hill’s branches were waving at the same time as if they had encountered something attractive.

At the same time, a consciousness came over. It was a childish voice that sounded like a little girl.

“This is the place. I can take root here.”

Eli gasped. Hill had never communicated with him directly before.

‘Good heavens, this kid was forced to speak. It seemed that this Grassi Land is not simple.’

“Don’t worry. This will be our territory in the future!” Eli comforted Hill, and Hill slowly calmed down, but she still felt anxious from time to time.

After the pacification, Ely’s consciousness slowly returned. At this time, the three of them had already arrived at the periphery of the valley.

The entrance to the valley was a little narrow at first, but as they entered, it became wider and wider, and the aura of life became denser and denser.

Finally, with a bright light, Eli and the others entered the grassy land that the Manticore Family was fighting for.

Whoosh!

Eli took a deep breath and looked forward.

There was a huge space in front of him, roughly about 100 acres in area. There were countless towering trees growing there, each of which was estimated to be 100 meters tall. A river flowed through the valley, sparkling with light. On the side far from the entrance, there was only flat land with wild grass 30 feet tall. There were also many demonic plants that he had seen in the books.

Of course, this was not the most important thing. The most important thing was that the life aura here was almost ten times that of the outside world.

Whether it was magical plants or other plants, they could grow at least two to three times faster.

Eli suddenly understood why Hill was so anxious.

This place was simply a paradise for plants.

At this moment, Eli decided where he would live in the future. It was this valley.

It was spacious, and it was good in all aspects. Moreover, Hill would grow up here in the future, and it was not far from the Bloodline Tower. It was the most suitable place for him to settle down on the Central Mainland. He was also curious about why the life aura here was so dense.

” Sir, this is the Grassi Land, the root of all trouble. ” Glen looked at the land with mixed feelings.

“No, this is a treasured land!” Eli said.

Glen and Alida looked at Eli.

” I prefer the quiet. This will be my residence from now on. ” Eli said to the two of them.

“Yes, sir.” Glen nodded and looked at Alida.” Then I’ll arrange for someone to clean up this place. If you have any thoughts, you can tell Alida directly. I’ll get her to pass it on. ”

“Sure.”

“Then what is your next move?”

“I’ll come back here after the modification is completed. Besides, there are still many troubles that haven’t been dealt with!” Eli shook his head and walked out.

Glen and Alida exchanged a glance and followed.

“Oh, right, Glen, there’s something you need to help me with.”

“What is it? My lord.”

“The rumors outside are too ridiculous. They say that I easily killed Jalin. I clearly experienced a life-and-death battle and was seriously injured.”

“Yes!”

…

A day passed in the blink of an eye.

The news of the Bloodline Tower’s banquet, where Eli became the Honorary Tower Master, spread, and the surrounding forces also received invitations.

The details of the battle were also spread.

The Bloodline Tower’s branch had arrived, and the three celestials led by Eli had assisted in killing Radiant Moon Warlock Jalin with great difficulty. Eli had also suffered heavy injuries, but he had wiped out all the warlocks of the Manticore Family, including Vya, who had surrendered in the end. She had also been executed in front of everyone, greatly boosting their morale.

For a time, many forces’ mouths were wide open.

After all, this matter was a little too magical. The main tower of the Bloodline Tower was saved by the branch tower.

Was this a normal story?

And a tower with three celestials?

Everyone felt that it was a joke, but they could not believe it. After all, many people had seen it.

In short, after this battle, none of the surrounding forces dared to underestimate the Bloodline Tower. They were even afraid that they would do something.

...

After all, being able to kill Jalin meant that this force had already surpassed 99% of the 4th Tier Forces. It might be slightly weaker than the 3rd Tier Forces, but as long as it accumulated time, there was still a chance.

However, there were still no factions that showed goodwill to it because the manticore had only lost three celestials.

There was also the even stronger Jerre and the many forces under him.

No one knew what would happen next.

…

“It ended just like that?”

At this moment, in a city not far from Bloodline City, Lobelia put down the letter.

She had arrived at the Bloodline Tower in the early hours of the morning yesterday, but the matter had ended at that time, so she had to leave and wait for news.

But she never expected the story to change like this.

Originally, she had wanted to prevent Eli from meeting the enemy or mediating between them, but she hadn’t expected Eli to directly meet the enemy and even kill a Radiant Moon Warlock. Even if he was injured, he was still a Radiant Moon Warlock, completely different from a Morning Star Warlock.

“Looks like I need to raise my ranking again. His strength might have already reached the second stage of Radiant Moon, Crescent Moon. How terrifying!” Lobelia sighed deeply.

...

Who would have thought that a branch on the west coast could do this?

” Eli, what kind of Warlock is he? It looks like I’ll have to meet him in the future. ” She shook her head. Although she didn’t have an invitation, it wasn’t difficult for her to get one.

She just hoped that she wouldn’t be the only one going. That would be awkward.

…..

At the same time.

In a distant mountain range, a huge merchant association was advancing.

The Chamber of Commerce parade stretched for tens of kilometers, with countless Warlocks escorting it on both sides. In the middle was a huge rhinoceros that was nearly ten meters tall. It carried a luxurious chair on its back, and its surroundings were covered by a gemstone curtain.

There was a person sitting inside.

At this moment, the Warlock from the back of the caravan suddenly flew over. His aura had reached the late stage of the third circle.

The Warlock stopped beside the rhinoceros and reported, “Vice President Jin Ji, there’s an urgent letter from Holmes City that needs to be opened by you. ”

“Come!” The person behind the curtain seemed surprised to hear that it was from Holmes City. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

The curtain opened, revealing the person behind it.

He had white hair and black pupils. He wore a gold-rimmed hat and a suit of gold-spotted clothes. He wore ten rings on his hands, each of which was a different color. He looked middle-aged, but he was full of dignity and exuded a noble aura.

The person in front of him was one of the two vice guild leaders in charge of the western region, and the only person above him was the Central Region Golden Cicada.

However, he was also a little puzzled because, in the past, his master always hid his emotions, but today seemed to be a little different.

What surprised him was that as the envelope was opened, his master’s expression seemed to become more and more serious, and his gaze became more and more complicated. In the end, he even closed his eyes.

As his master’s trusted aide, he could feel his master’s sorrow.

What exactly happened?

The Warlock was extremely shocked. He had never seen Daren with such an expression.

After more than ten seconds, Jin Ji slowly said, “Turn around and go to the Bloodline Tower.”

” But Sir, we’re going to see the president this time. ” The Warlock’s eyes widened. ‘What was in the letter?’

” Alright, then let Collina go. Let him go to the Bloodline Tower and meet Eli. ” Jin Ji took another deep breath and said.

“Yes!” The Warlock nodded, but the confusion in his heart deepened.

Lord Collina was a Radiant Moon Warlock. He had once saved Lord Jin Ji’s life. Now, he was Lord Jin Ji’s strongest and most trusted subordinate, and Lord Ginji was actually willing to send him out.

Was it because of this Bloodline Tower?

The Warlock was confused.

The Warlock quickly left, and the caravan continued forward.

Behind the curtain, Jin Ji silently shed tears.

Lord Herman was still dead!

Then he would go and see his students.

Unfortunately, he had something to do for the time being. He would definitely go and meet him when he returned from the Central Region.

..

At the westernmost part of the Western Regions.

This was where the Holy Tower, one of the major forces of the Western Region, was located.

In one of the rooms.

“Young Tower Master, this is all the news. It should be a major event that has happened in the Western Regions recently.” A Warlock reported respectfully.

“Alright then.” In front of them, a figure raised his head.

His black hair was elegant, but his red eyes were aggressive. He wore a black and red Warlock robe and had an arrogant aura.

” I didn’t expect to hear news about the Bloodline Tower on the west coast. He’s Herman’s disciple. ” Luo Ye raised his head, his eyes filled with surprise.

“Then how should we deal with it, sir? After all, this faction is too far away from us.” The Warlock asked curiously.

” Send someone over to greet the warlock, Eli. It’s a pity that it’s the territory of our arch-enemy, the Eight-Armed Naga Family. Otherwise, I would have to go there no matter what. ” Luo Ye shook his head.

“Yes!” The Warlock retreated.

…..

The Manticore Clan.

“Damn it!” Jerre smashed the blanket in his hand into pieces. The anger and confusion in his heart made him suffer.

He had never expected that the team of Warlocks led by Jalin would be completely wiped out.

“Eli, the west coast tower!” Jerre said through gritted teeth.

This was the second time he had heard this name, but he did not expect such an outcome.

It seemed that the missing Wellington was also related to him.

However, he still couldn’t understand how a west coast tower could have such strength.

This didn’t make sense!

“But we must get the Grassi Land!” Jerre gritted his teeth.

He also had a reason not to give up, but he could not tell his clansmen.

Of course, he didn’t plan to make a move for the time being. Since Jalin was also killed, it meant that Eli’s strength was definitely not ordinary. However, since Eli was injured and surrounded, he shouldn’t be much stronger than Jalin.

Jerre was holding the latest official information about the Bloodline Tower in his hand. “It looks like I have to contact all the subordinate forces.”

He planned to join forces with others and destroy the Bloodline Tower. Of course, he had his own plan, which was to spread the news that the Bloodline Tower had surrendered.

“They even dare to hold a party.”

Jerre sneered. He didn’t believe that any force would go!

He believed that the other forces would give him some face. After all, he was the leader of the Manticore family.
