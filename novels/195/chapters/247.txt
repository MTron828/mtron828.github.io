248 Farewell

Two minutes ago.

At the center of the ruins.

There weren’t many people here at the moment, only about a dozen or so. However, if the warlocks on the West Coast saw this, they would definitely exclaim in surprise because they were all third-circle warlocks.

However, there seemed to be a battle going on.

At this time, eight or nine people were facing the other six people.

On one side, there were five men and four women. Five of them were wearing robes with the symbol of the heart of darkness. Their strength was even more terrifying. Three of them were at the late stage of the third circle, and the other two were at the middle stage of the third ring. As for the other four, they were from heart of thorn and helwall!

Of the six people on the opposite side, two of them were wearing white robes and belonged to the Holy tower. The other four belonged to the Golden Cicada Chamber of Commerce, the unicorn Warlock Academy, and the Harpy school. Among them, one of them was a late-stage third circle from the Holy tower, one of them was a late-stage third circle warlock from the Golden cicada, and the rest were mid-stage third circle warlocks.

The heart of darkness was clearly prepared, and many high-end combatants had come.

“Luo Fu, is the heart of the night going to tear up the Treaty?”

The leader of the Holy tower was the Warlock that Eli had met by chance before. At this moment, he had an angry expression as he questioned the Warlock from the heart of the night.

“Moss, it’s already like this. Do you still need me to say anything?” Luo Fu, a long-faced Warlock, looked down at the man and said.

“Alright then!” Moss closed his eyes. At this point, there was indeed nothing more to say!

No matter what happened today, at least the West Coast treaty would be completely torn apart, and the entire West Coast would no longer be as peaceful as it was today.

It seemed that they could only pray that they could hold on until everything was over.

At this moment, Luo Fu, from the heart of the night suddenly, frowned.

“What’s the matter?” A late-stage third-circle warlock asked.

“It seems like the barrier has been damaged a little!” Luo Fu frowned.

According to the strength of his barrier, it should be impossible for even a late-stage third-circle warlock to break through it. But how could there be a problem all of a sudden? Could it be that the other forces had reacted so quickly?

“Forget it. Rodin, go and take a look!” He turned to the Warlock on his right. He was also a late-stage third-circle warlock, and he looked a little old!

“Okay, but is there no problem here?” Rodin nodded and looked at the few people opposite him.

“no problem. Even if you’re not here, they’re no match for us!” Luo Fu said confidently, ” it’s located in the southwest. Go and check it out. If there’s no problem, return immediately!”

“Alright!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Rodin’s body was surrounded by moonlight, and then he flew in the direction that Luo Fu had said.

After watching Rodin leave, Luo Fu turned back and looked at Moss.

He instantly attacked.

On the other side, Rodin had also disappeared from their sight.

“This is the place, right?”

Rodin was very fast and soon arrived near the forest. This was the place that Luo Fu had mentioned.

“But who is that?” He looked towards the center of the forest. There seemed to be a battle going on there, but it was too far away, so he could not see clearly.

After thinking for a moment, a beam of moonlight entered his eyes. Immediately, a beam of light was emitted from his eyes. His vision seemed to penetrate the void, and he could see everything that was happening in the forest.

“F * ck!”

Rodin’s eyes widened after a few seconds of observation.

What did he just see?

A man?

Then, he instantly killed three third-circle warlocks. What the hell was that last move, shadow wave? It was just too powerful.

In an instant, Rodin realized a problem. He could not defeat this person. He was already very old. Although he was still at the late-stage of the third circle, he was still at the bottom of the hierarchy. His strength had deteriorated seriously.

So … He should just run.

Thinking of this, Rodin controlled the moonlight and made a sharp turn. As he flew in the other direction, he shouted, “damn, I almost went the wrong way. The southwest should be that way!”

..

???

In the forest, the three of them looked at each other.

Vivika and Udo looked at the third circle warlock, who was making a sharp turn, and their mouths twitched. They had thought that another enemy was coming, but this was it?

Where’s your backbone as a third-circle warlock?

“He ran fast!”

Back when he was destroying the barrier, Eli had thought that he would attract the attention of the person who set it up, so he wanted to act quickly. However, he did not expect that they would react so quickly. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

But it was good. It saved him a lot of effort.

“Benefactor, are we going to the core area next?” Udo was stunned for a moment before he asked Eli.

“No, I’m ready to leave!” Eli shook his head. His only goal was to save Vivika. Thinking of this, he looked at Vivika with a serious expression and said, “Let’s go!”

It was not a request but an order!

Vivika bit her lips, then walked behind Eli like a child who had caused trouble!

“Do you want to come with me?” Suddenly, Eli looked at Udo!

“I …” Udo hesitated, but after a few seconds, his gaze gradually became firm. “benefactor, I’m sorry. The Holy tower needs my power.”

“Alright!”

Eli didn’t say anything. Everyone had their own choices.

...

Udo was more determined than he thought. This was a man with a pure heart. No wonder Eli saved him back then. If he didn’t die this time, he might have a good future.

With that in mind, Eli looked at Udo’s fate.

The blazing flames were not as strong as Jin Ji’s physical manifestation, but it was still good enough. At least, the fate of most people was a blur.

“What about Vivika?”

Eli was curious, but there was nothing behind Vivika!

“There’s nothing!” Eli found it a little strange, but he didn’t delve into it. After all, it was his first time coming into contact with fate, and he was also a newcomer.

“Let’s go!”

With that in mind, Eli flew out of the ruins, Vivika following closely behind.

As for Udo, he gritted his teeth and ran towards the core region.

..

The journey to leave was much smoother than Eli had expected.

...

Eli left the ruins without a hitch.

An hour and a half later, the two of them returned to their destination.

Outside Silvermoon town.

The silver Moon banquet’s revelry had yet to end, and Eli said to Vivika, “Go and gather all the warlocks in the bloodline tower. We’ll leave in an hour!”

“Alright!” Vivika nodded, knowing that she shouldn’t stay there for long.

“Then what about you, teacher?”

“I’ll go and see the results.”

Eli smiled and looked towards the silver Moon Lake. He noticed something strange. There seemed to be a lot of people in the area where he had been!

He felt that Jin Ji might have gained something.

“Alright!”

Vivika nodded and quickly left.

Eli strode to the side of the silver Moon Lake, and as soon as he arrived, he suddenly heard a cry of surprise.

“Again? The f * cking element’s heart again?”

“How is this possible?”

The crowd’s discussion could be heard. Something had happened.

Jin Ji had actually caught five elemental hearts, three blood God fish, and a number of other fish in less than half a day!

“Is it that ridiculous?” The corner of Eli’s mouth twitched. He had still underestimated the power of fate’s Child.

Perhaps Jin Ji’s fortune was indeed good, or else fate wouldn’t have condensed into a Golden cicada.

However, it was a pity that this was the end. He had to leave immediately.

Eli walked towards the crowd, and an aura spread out, pushing people to the sides. The people who were pushed were angry at first, but after Eli released the aura of a third circle, they all quieted down.

With everyone’s understanding, Eli walked to the central area without any obstructions.

At this time, in the central area, Jin Ji was sitting on his recliner, holding a fishing rod with a serious expression. In the big bucket beside him, dozens of fish were emitting various colors of light.

“Jin Ji!” Eli called out.

“My Lord!”

Hearing the voice, Jin ji turned his head. Seeing that it was Eli, he was instantly overjoyed.

He quickly put down his fishing rod and walked towards Eli. “My Lord, I’ve caught the fish you wanted!”

“Yes, yes!” Eli nodded. You didn’t just catch it. “You’ve probably emptied the entire Silver Moon lake’s reserves.”

“Then, my Lord, you can take these fish away!”

“No need, I only need the element’s heart!” With a wave of his hand, the five element’s hearts in the fish pond were collected by Eli.

“My Lord, you are …” Looking at Eli’s hurried movements, Jin ji asked curiously.

“Something happened.” Eli thought for a moment, then told him the rest through his mental power.

“What!”

After hearing this, Jin Ji’s mouth was wide open. Such a big thing had actually happened.

“I’m leaving now. You do as you see fit. I’ve taken advantage of you this time.” Eli patted Jin ji’s shoulder, then turned to leave.

Looking at Eli’s back as he left, Jin ji gritted his teeth, put away the fish, and quickly left.

The West Coast was going to change.

The others were also stunned as they watched Jin Ji leave.

The next second.

“I’ll take this seat!” A second-circle warlock directly occupied Jin Ji’s original position.

“Detestable!”

Many people gritted their teeth when they saw it. It had been robbed. There was a rule here that no fights were allowed near silver Moon Lake. Otherwise, those who violated it would be blacklisted by all the forces. This was part of the West Coast treaty.

But what they didn’t know was that the West Coast treaty had completely dissolved already.

..

An hour later.

As the airship of the house of bloodline took off quietly …

Only then did the residents of Silvermoon town realize that all the members of the bloodlines tower had left.

Everyone found it strange.

The silver Moon meet hadn’t even ended, and the bloodline tower had already left?!

However, there were also some who smelled something amiss and left first.
