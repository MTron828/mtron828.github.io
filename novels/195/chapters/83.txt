84 A Peaceful Life

Just as the library was celebrating scholar Clement’s promotion to head library …

At the same time, in the palace.

In a palace that was not very big, bryne the seventh was lying on a luxurious bed made of gauze. His head was resting on a pair of soft and tender thighs, and a pair of delicate hands was rubbing his temples.

“Your Majesty, I’ve received the news. The Corsi family fled from Jun Lin overnight. A scholar named Clement became the head of the library!” The woman was beautiful and dignified.

!!

“Oh, really?” The man on her Jade-like legs opened his eyes.

His face was very similar to Bryne the sixth’s, but he was much younger than him. He also seemed to lack a trace of majesty, but there was an indescribable melancholy.

“Hmm, it seems that Your Majesty’s plan this time wasn’t very successful!” the woman gently rubbed the man’s temple and said with a smile. “Do you want to investigate?”

“Forget it. There’s no need. It was just a test anyway.” Bryne the seventh sat up and held the woman in his arms. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“The original director, Seviro Mesa, was a good friend of my father’s. I couldn’t do anything about it. It was probably him who was behind this. He is very cunning.” said Bryne the seventh calmly. “even if you investigate, you probably won’t find anything. It’s meaningless.”

“Then, your majesty, are we just going to let the imperial library continue to develop like this?” The woman didn’t understand.

“It’s fine. Seviro Mesa was severely injured in the past, and he probably doesn’t have many years left to live. When he dies, I’ll slowly take over the Imperial Library!” Bryne the seventh pushed the woman onto the bed and looked down at her.

Although he was already forty-five years old, he still had the strength and heart of a Grand Knight.

The woman’s face was slightly red, full of anticipation.

“Forget it, a few more!” Bryne the seventh sat up and shouted to the outside. A few women came in again.

The door was tightly shut.

…

At the same time, in the bryne Empire, seviro Mesa, who had just sneaked into an ancient tomb, sneezed and scratched his nose.

“I feel like someone is talking about me!” Seviro pursed his lips.

However, it was only for an instant. He then focused on excavating the ancient tomb.

He had already been in this desolate place for a week. Who would talk about him? It was really nonsensical. He might as well focus on the excavation of the ancient tomb.

“This time, I feel like I’ll definitely be able to find something!” a smile appeared on Seviro’s face, which was covered by a veil.

Three hours later, he left in a sorry state.

‘F*ck! Is this a rat’s nest or an ancient tomb?!’

Seviro left with a dejected look. Needless to say, he had gained nothing this time.

He took out a map of the bryne Empire and drew a cross on a certain spot.

Upon closer inspection, the crosses on the map had already covered almost three-quarters of the map. Most of them had been explored before.

…

What good would it do for his teacher to become the head director?

Eli felt it very clearly.

First of all, other people would be more polite to you.

Secondly, you’ll have more freedom to go to work and leave work, and the guards won’t stop you.

Finally, all the books in the library could be read, even if they were confidential.

How should he put it? It felt very good.

Of course, compared to the happy Eli, scholar Clement was much sadder. Although it was good that he had become the head of the library, he had to deal with even more things. As a 68-year-old man, it was hard on him. Thus, he decisively pulled his good student, Herman, to help him with the work.

Herman was dumbfounded. Every day, he would stare at the pile of documents on his desk.

Why was he always the one getting hurt? He was already 35 years old!

Couldn’t he just rest for the rest of his life? He had to work during the day and at night. He felt like he was going to be squeezed dry.

…

The Empire was weakening day by day, and Eli was getting off work as usual.

To Eli, life was far calmer, and he began to devote himself to the experiment again.

Currently, he had two main experiments.

The first was the in-depth study of magic potions and the formulation of mental potions.

The study of potions had been the main content of his research, and his competency had been slowly but steadily improving. Compared to ten years ago, his level of potion-making had improved at least twice, and many potion formulas were at his fingertips.

On the other hand, there was a long way to go before he could concoct a potion that could increase his mental strength.

The main reason was that the advanced potionology manual did not record such a precious formula, so Eli could only figure out how to formulate it himself. However, it was never an easy task to create something from nothing.

The second was the study of bloodlines.

After all, he only had four books on wizardry and one notebook. Warlocks’ bloodline choice was mainly theoretical, but it still had some practical applications, so he had been trying to learn it.

That was why he wanted Zhong Li to get him some demonic beast blood.

It was mainly because the blood he had collected earlier was almost used up.

The study of blood vessels was more complicated, and the experimental equipment and receptors needed were more troublesome, so he stored them in the valley outside the city.

“Forget it. I should go outside today.” Seeing that it was still early, Eli decided to do the bloodline experiment today.

After leaving Jun Lin, Eli arrived at his secret base.

Calmly, he walked into the entrance that was filled with a dozen spell formations. This was enough to ensure that if anyone barged in, this place would be instantly buried, ensuring that the things inside would not be discovered.

It was completely silent inside.

There were only seven or eight caves scattered on the stone wall, and there seemed to be something inside.

Eli calmly walked into the one on the far left. This was a place that looked like a laboratory. It was mainly made up of animal experimental subjects, such as mice, wolves, tigers, and mainly monkeys.

It had to be said that the monkey was indeed a good test subject for bloodlines.

Eli didn’t want to do human experiments because he didn’t want to harm innocent people.

He still had some humanity in him.

“Let’s start the experiment.” Eli looked around and numbed a monkey.

He took out the experimental materials he had prepared. This time, he was going to do an animal experiment. He was going to try to transplant the hand of another wolf on the monkey.

Soon, the experiment began.

Eli began to work seriously.

Compared to a simple elemental experiment, this type of experiment was still very difficult. It was mainly about rejection and the damage to the limbs caused by biological fusion. The reason why he did this experiment was that he had something to verify.

What if he failed?

Who said that experiments had to be successful to be useful?

Knowledge is power.

This process was a form of wealth to Eli in and of itself.

This was a day in the dry and boring daily life of an eternal mage.
