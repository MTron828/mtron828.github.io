132 The Ruins

It was already a month later when he saw Victor again.

…

At dusk.

Eli had just returned from the potions Department and had just reached the mountain where his house was located. Just as he was near the house, he saw Victor lying outside the door.

“I knew something must have happened.” Eli’s eyes widened as he quickly walked over.

!!

Victor’s eyes were closed, and his lips were dark. He looked dispirited, as if he had suffered a serious injury.

After checking for a few minutes and making sure that there was nothing else on Victor’s body, Eli helped him back to his house and fed him a first-Circle Healing potion.

After all, they were still friends, and a little help was nothing.

Of course, his help was limited to this.

After treating him, Eli returned to the yard to water the vines.

Half an hour later, there was a sudden cough from inside the door.

Eli turned around and saw that Victor, who was lying on the bed, had woken up.

…

“cough cough!”

Victor coughed and opened his eyes in pain. He was in a strange place.

“Where is this place?” Victor frowned.

He remembered that he was so seriously injured that he had wanted to go home, but he had fallen down in front of his house.

At this moment, Eli walked in.

“Herman.” Seeing Eli, Victor naturally understood what had happened.

“Thank you. If it wasn’t for you, I might have lost everything in my body.” Victor felt that nothing was missing from his body, so he thanked him.

“No problem, we’re friends.” Eli shook his head.

“Yes, but thank you.” Victor coughed twice and said with difficulty.

“Well, I haven’t seen you for more than a month. It seems that you were up to something.” Looking at Victor, Eli asked.

“Sigh, don’t mention it.” Victor sighed, but he didn’t say anything.

“I should have taken more potions. I will return them to you when the time comes. Also, don’t worry. My injury has nothing to do with other warlocks. I won’t cause you any trouble.” Victor didn’t seem to want to answer and got up to leave.

“Okay, be careful.” Ere nodded.

He had a lot of secrets, so how could he force others to tell him? besides, what happened to Victor had nothing to do with him.

“it’s mainly because I’m also very confused. I’ll tell you what happened if I have the chance.” Victor got off the bed and walked towards the door.

On the other hand, Eli acted as if nothing had happened, closed the door, and entered the arcane realm.

…

Half a year passed just like that.

Many things had happened in the past six months. For example, the sales of the sun corollas had plummeted because of the silent crescent spring. Instead of leaving, they had chosen to cooperate with the potions Department and join the camp.

This was great for Eli because he earned even more from the profit.

As for Eli, he remained silent throughout the entire process. Other than Evena and Rooney, the others still thought that Eli had only played a key role in some steps of the potion’s transformation. They didn’t know that it was actually Eli who had transformed the potion.

On the day of the cooperation, Eli even met the owner of the sun Corolla store. The two of them shook hands in a friendly manner, and the old man even proposed to cooperate in person with Eli, but he was tactfully rejected by Eli.

“I was expecting them to send someone to kill me!” At that time, Eli thought the thought in his head was funny.

In fact, according to the news, it was the Department that had modified the magic potion under Evena’s leadership. The owner of the Sun Corrola Chamber wouldn’t attack Evena for no reason.

Therefore, although Eli was promoted to the deputy minister, he was still a nobody. However, he was already very satisfied.

There was also Rock, who had also sent a letter to Eli, telling him that he had joined the shadow lizard Warlock Academy and that he was a student of a second circle Warlock.

Eli replied to express his blessings.

After everything was over, another half a month passed.

Victor found Eli.

…

“Are you saying that you want to invite me to join your expedition?” Eli asked, puzzled.

“Yes, I am.” Victor nodded and said, “Actually, I went out half a year ago because a friend of mine happened to discover the ruins of a small Dark Magus school and invited me to explore it together. In the end, due to insufficient preparation, not only did we fail, but we also suffered heavy losses.

“after half a year of rest, we are ready again, but we are short of a pharmacist, so we came to you,” Victor said with a sincere face.

Hearing this, Eli frowned and asked doubtfully, “Victor, why are you involved in this?”

Victor wasn’t like this before.

“My grandson is about to break through to the first circle, but he still lacks a lot of magic stones. Although most of the things in the Magus ruins are not worth much, there are still some good things that I need.” Victor said with a sincere face.

“Help me, Eli.” Victor knew that Eli’s level of potioneering was very high.

“A ruin?” Eli thought for a moment and asked, “What’s the current makeup of your expedition group?”

“There are six of us. One is a newly-promoted 1-circle Warlock, five are 0-circle apprentices, and including you, there are seven of us. Don’t worry. It’s going to be fine,” Victor said.

“I’m sorry, I refuse.” After some thought, Eli still refused.

Ruins sounded very dangerous. He still remembered the accident that happened at the last ruin. If something were to happen again this time, Eli didn’t want to bear the consequences.

“I see!” Victor sighed.

“However, I can provide you with potions on the condition that I can take some of the things you get back from the ruins. Of course, I will pay for them, “Eli said.

He could choose not to participate in the ruins, but he was a little envious of the mage knowledge in the ruins.

Victor hesitated and said, “sure, but I’ll have to ask the Leader first. Can you let me do that?”

“Of course, you can.” Eli nodded happily.

As long as Eli didn’t need to go there directly, Victor could do anything.

…

Three days later.

In a bar, Eli met Victor’s leader.

It was a red-haired man who looked very old. His eyes were blue, and he exuded a slightly scorching aura. It seemed that he had just advanced not long ago and could not completely control the bloodline in his body.

“Hello, Herman.”

“Hello, I’m Gino. I know you, the Vice-Minister of the potions Department.” Gino looked at Eli and said with a smile.

“Let’s talk inside. The others are still waiting,” Victor said with a smile as he saw a good atmosphere.

He was the one who pulled Eli over, and if the cooperation was successful, he could get an extra portion.

“Alright,” he said. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

The two of them walked into a room at the side. There were five other people waiting inside.

Eli glanced at them, and they were indeed all apprentices.

“let’s have a chat. I heard that you want to participate in it, but you don’t want to go to the ruins.” Gino sat at the head of the table, showing his signature smile, but Eli thought it was fake.

“Yes, but I’ll provide you with all the potions you want. Also, as everyone knows, most of the things that mages have are useless to warlocks. When the time comes, you’ll probably sell them, and I can buy them at market price, ” Eli answered sincerely.

In fact, his goal was to be the first to purchase all their findings.

“I see!” The other apprentices were furious when they heard it at first, but after hearing what Eli was going to offer, they seemed to think that it was quite reasonable. After all, they did not lose anything, and they would even get some potions for free.

“Like this?” Gino thought about it and was tempted, but he still tried to invite him. “How about this? If you join us, I can give you a bit more of my share.”

Potioneers were sometimes very important in an expedition because sometimes, situational environments like poisonous fog or abnormal conditions required a new potion to be made on the spot.

“I’m sorry, I’m just a pharmacist. I don’t have the strength to even truss a chicken. I’m not suitable for exploration. However, I can give you the best batch of potions from the potion Department. These potions are enough for you to use.” Eli gave an affirmative answer again.

Gino furrowed his brows. A few minutes later, he stood up and extended his hand toward Eli.

“Happy cooperation.”

“Happy cooperation.”

Just like that, at the cost of providing potions, Eli received the right to purchase and inspect the spoils of war from the exploration of the ruins in advance.

It looked like a loss, but Eli felt like he had profited.

He made a rough estimate. The price of the magic potion should be close to 200 low-grade magic stones according to the market price. According to the cost, it should be around 70 magic stones, which was equivalent to two months of profits from the sales of the silent crescent spring.

Therefore, Eli only spent two months ‘worth of money and eliminated the risk that might be brought about by the exploration of the ruins. As for the purchase later, it was another matter.

From the perspective of Victor, Gino, and the others, it was indeed a loss for Eli, but from the perspective of an immortal, not only was there no loss but there might even be a small profit.

After saying goodbye to Gino, Eli and Victor returned.

“Herman, if anything happens to me, please help me send the money to my grandson. He’s a student at the shadow lizard sorcerer Academy, and his contact number is…” Victor suddenly said.

“Relax, you’ll be fine.”

“No, Herman, I’m serious. I’m not young anymore. My son died many years ago, and he’s the only grandson I have left. He’s having trouble advancing to the first circle, so I have to help him.” Victor said with a serious face. “I’ve already told the others. If something really happens to me, you can ask them for the things I have left for my grandson.”

“Okay, okay, okay, I promise you.” Eli finally agreed.

“Thank you, Herman,” Victor said gratefully.

…

Half a month later.

Victor and the others set off with Eli’s potions. Their target was the dark sorcerer ruins.

On the other hand, Eli watched the group of people leave.

He didn’t know how things were going, but a month later, he received news that Gino and the others had returned.
