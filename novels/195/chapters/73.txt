74 Disturbance

A month passed in the blink of an eye.

The success of the Alliance did have a significant impact at first, but as time passed, other people’s attention gradually shifted to the specific contact between the two countries.

As for scholar Clement and Eli’s fame, it spread within a certain range. However, habits that had been formed over the years could not be changed. After scholar Clement returned, he returned to his normal life.

It was the same for Eli, just like usual.

This made many people dumbfounded, sighing that there was a pair of ” strange teacher and student ” in the library.

After all, if a normal person suddenly gained such great fame, they would usually publicize it and take the opportunity to increase their influence. When it came to them, it was as if they were hiding from this fame.

However, no matter what, the fame of the two had increased to a certain extent.

As for the king, he did not seem to have any intention of summoning them.

Eli felt that something must have happened, but this was good too. He could focus on studying and understanding the advanced books.

In the blink of an eye, half a month had passed.

Due to the Alliance, the relationship between the two countries gradually deepened. The Kazan Chamber of Commerce had finally opened its first branch in Junlin, which meant that Eli would have a stable source of materials from now on.

Of course, the happiest one was not Eli but Roland.

Originally, Roland had almost been driven crazy by the previous incident and was even ready to sell his property, but he suddenly received a request for cooperation from the Kazan chamber of commerce.

This made him both dazed and ecstatic.

The desperate Chamber of Commerce had suddenly connected with the number one Chamber of Commerce in the Lorraine Kingdom. This not only saved them from danger but also gave them more power.

As for why such a large Chamber of Commerce would suddenly take a fancy to them ...

Roland only thought of Eli, who was going to Lorraine, but he didn’t say anything.

However, the two of them had a drink together that night and went to Liu Ying alley.

...

Another month passed.

Something else happened that Eli didn’t expect.

One of the vice directors of the imperial library had passed away.

There were usually only three Vice Directors in the Empire’s library. They were in charge of assisting the director in managing all aspects of the library. Moreover, since the director was not around all year round, they were often the ones who managed everything together.

There were a total of three candidates to replace the vice director this time. For some reason, scholar Clement was among them.

There was also the Empire’s famous scholar Hila, and the other was a knowledgeable scholar.

However, after hearing about Hila, the third scholar gave up.

Just when everyone thought that Hila would compete for the position of Vice Director, something even more unexpected happened. Hila also gave up, which made everyone’s jaws drop.

The reason she gave was that she was not as good as Clement, which shocked many people.

In the end, scholar Clement inexplicably became the Vice Director.

In this regard, Eli was happy.

In the future, he would be able to take advantage of the situation openly.

Of course, there was happiness and sadness.

When eli returned to Jun Lin and saw that Herman had already become a learner and was showing off in his learner’s uniform, he closed his eyes silently.

Damn it. He was the only a minor librarian.

The process of scholar Clement becoming the Deputy Director was also very calm, and nothing happened.

Three days later, the library curator summoned scholar clement.

Eli didn’t know what the two of them were talking about. He only knew that after Clement returned, he told the curator that he wanted to see him.

...

A day later.

The carriage left the library, carrying Eli and scholar Clement.

In the carriage.

“Teacher, why does the curator want to see me?” what’s wrong? ” Eli asked.

“Don’t worry. It’s a good thing.” Scholar Clement said with a smile, keeping him in suspense.

Speaking of which, he was quite proud of himself during this period of time. After all, he was almost 60, but he suddenly became Deputy director. He felt that this was an inexplicable affirmation of him.

The only thing that puzzled him was why Hila had given up. Since there was no answer, he could only guess that Hila was not interested in the position.

“Okay, then tell me about the director, teacher.” Ere nodded and asked.

Speaking of which, this head of the library was quite a legend.

His name was Seviro Mesa, and it was said that he was born in the slums of a small city. His family was poor, and his parents were both gambling addicts. He often went hungry for two to three days.

When he was eight years old, his parents were beaten to death because he owed too much money. He became an orphan overnight.

With no money and no food, it was, needless to say, how miserable Seviro Mesa’s situation was. However, he was born with a special ability, and that was a photographic memory. As long as he had seen something, he would not forget.

Then, he used this ability to recognize words and quickly became a scribe.

Later on, when he was 12 years old, he came to Jun Lin and entered the library. At the age of 20, he quickly became a Grand Secretary. And when he was 15 years old, he accidentally obtained a Knight’s study technique. He discovered that he was very talented. In the same year that he became a Grand Secretary, he also became an advanced Knight.

As for now, he was already 50 years old. Not only was he the head of the library, but he was also a grand knight. It was said that he had a deep friendship with bryne the sixth.

It was like a novel, and many people in the Empire regarded him as an idol.

However, the strange thing was that he was everywhere before the age of 40, but after the age of 40, he seemed to have disappeared without a trace, and it was very difficult to know what he had done.

“I don’t know much about him, but he seems to be wandering around the countries outside of Bryne all year round. “Scholar Clement said after a moment of hesitation.

“I told him about what happened in Lorraine, so he wants to see you. Relax, the director is very easy-going.”

“Oh!”

Eli nodded.

‘It seems that this was just an ordinary meeting, and there is no need to think too much.’

Eli chatted with his teacher, and they soon arrived at a Manor.

The manor was huge, but there were not many people. It was said that it was a gift from Bryne the sixth.

As soon as Clement and Eli got out of the car, a Butler immediately came over to receive them. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Soon, they were arranged to stay in a living room.

“Master will be back soon. He might need some time.” The Butler explained.

What else could the two of them say? They could only wait.

Fortunately, the chief didn’t make them wait too long.

Ten minutes later, the Butler came again.

“Mr. Eli, let’s go!”

Eli got up and followed him. As for Clement, he continued to wait. He had brought Eli here today, so it had little to do with him.

Following the Butler, the two of them quickly arrived at a room on the top floor.

The Butler knocked on the door.

“Come in!” A sonorous voice rang out. The Butler gently pushed the door open and gestured for Eli to enter alone.

Eli nodded and walked in.

He wanted to see what kind of person this chief director was.
