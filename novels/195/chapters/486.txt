487 Hundreds of Thousands of Gaze on Him

“Shadow Dragon…Breath!”

Accompanied by a buzzing sound, the next second, a breath spewed out!

In the sky a black pillar of light that was thousands of meters long tore through the sky. The huge fire axe was like fragile glass, turning into countless sparks before extinguishing. Meanwhile, the Shadow Dragon’s breath continued to envelop the Balor.

“This is impossible!”

The Balor roared loudly, and panic flashed in its eyes.

In the next second, the light arrived in front of him, and countless shadows instantly covered him.

“Ah!”

The Balor’s eyes were about to pop out as it felt its body being corroded bit by bit. Its skin was also cracking bit by bit. The shadow entered the skin through the cracks and corrupted the internal tissues of its body!

He could feel his life slipping away bit by bit!

Fear was like mud that stuck to his throat, causing him to only let out some meaningless ravings. However, when the shadow entered his body, he realized two more terrifying things.

The first thing was that the shadow before him seemed to contain mental power that kept attacking his brain, making him feel his consciousness collapse and disintegrate. However, how could a dragon-type bloodline have such power?

The second one was even more terrifying. He did not feel any obvious power of law in the shadows. In other words, Eli had not used any law yet.

Of course, he wouldn’t think that Eli didn’t comprehend any laws.

So there was only one possibility. Eli was still hiding his strength.

“Be… Be… Careful, he…!”

He turned his head and looked at his companions in the distance. He wailed and wanted to say something, but as he spoke, his voice became lower and lower, and his figure gradually disappeared.

A few seconds later, his figure slowly melted into the shadows.

After the Shadow Dragon’s breath, it slowly dissipated, leaving a dark pillar of light tens of thousands of meters long in the blue sky, like a brush of the gods.

“Cough!”

Eli felt the dead Balrog in the shadows and took a deep breath. He then looked at the remaining people, and they immediately shivered.

“How is this possible? Sula died just like that?”

“How is that possible? They were both half-step fifth-circle warlocks. Why was there such a huge difference?”

“Can we really beat this guy?”

No one had expected that a half-step fifth-circle warlock would die like that.

Eli was far more powerful than they had imagined.

At this moment, it wasn’t just them. The Warlocks on the ground were also dumbfounded.

They stared blankly at the shadow mark in the sky as if telling them that everything that had happened just now was real. With just one attack, a half-step fifth-circle warlock had died.

Are they f * cking sure that they are on the same level?

“Sir Eli!” Countless people began to cheer as if they had seen the hope of victory.

“How terrifying!” Vivika pursed her lips, and her pupils dilated.

“This is a little ridiculous. What is this thing? Could it be that His Lord really…” Nikola was completely stunned. As a former mage, he was the only one who could sense the aura that his master had released!

That was the power of the celestial body!

However, this was a bloodline avatar…Could it be that his lord had fused the two powers together?

He pursed his lips and suddenly understood why the world’s will had descended that day. It was because all the mages had left. Otherwise, Eli would have instantly become famous in the mage’s world.

“Fortunately, I chose to stay with him.”

In the distance, the Warlocks who were sending messages also stopped.

“How ridiculous!”

A Warlock tore the information into pieces and started writing again. They had underestimated the Bloodline Tower and Eli.

“Let me see how strong you are.” He raised his trembling head and looked at Eli.

It was not just him. Everyone, regardless of whether they were men or women, no matter what they were doing, hundreds of thousands of gazes were cast toward the battlefield, focusing on the thousand-meter-long dragon.

Eli.

..

In the sky.

The five of them looked at Eli solemnly. This time, no one dared to make the first move. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“What’s wrong? You guys weren’t like this just now!” Eli turned his huge body, his golden dragon eyes flashing with an unfriendly light and his dragon claws flashing.

Gulp!

Their throats moved slightly, but they still did not make a move.

After a few seconds, the Bone Demon slowly said solemnly, “Everyone, let’s attack together. This person in front of us is much stronger than we imagined. If we don’t go all out, everyone might really die here today!”

The Bone Demon’s words made everyone tremble, but there was no doubt that he was right.

This was indeed the best choice at the moment.

“Let’s attack together!” The Bone Demon’s voice sounded again.

In the next moment, the demons attacked Eli one after another.

Flames, bone spikes, mental attack, dark aura…

Dozens of attacks dyed the sky within 10,000 meters in all kinds of colors. Dozens of attacks mixed with the figures of several people flew towards Eli at the same time and attacked.

When Eli saw this scene, his eyes turned silver.

Boom!

From the five-ringed Eye of Mercury, a huge mental attack was directed at the Lust Devil.

Boom!

In an instant, the Lust Demon let out a wail, and then a trace of blood flowed out of her head. Then, she stopped instantly, and her attack instantly dissipated.

Seeing this scene, the rest of them did not stop moving and continued to attack.

Eli was still calm and used his mental attack.

Ever since the Eye of Mercury evolved to the fifth circle, its power was even more powerful than the Shadow Dragon’s Breath, especially when used against weak Warlocks.

Even the Lust Demons who specialized in mental attacks were weak to it, let alone the others.

Hence…With a flash of silver light, four mental power attacks shot out. They were unable to block them at all. The moment they were attacked, they let out painful howls.

Their bodies stopped, and even the power of their original attacks was greatly reduced.

Eli controlled a shadow tsunami and instantly eliminated all the attacks in the shadows.

A wave of joint attacks from several people ended up with serious mental injuries, while Eli was unharmed.

Eli didn’t stop. While his enemies were still under the mental influence, he flew directly to the side of a Balor. His huge dragon claw grabbed its head and squeezed!

Bang!

His head shattered like a watermelon, and another half-step celestial died.

And this was only the beginning. Eli’s body flashed, and every attack killed a demon. Even if they woke up, they could not resist at all, especially the Lust Demon. As a mental power demon, she was the first to wake up, but when faced with the dragons with invincible physiques, she was smashed like tofu by the dragon’s tail!

In the end, as the giant scythe created sparks on Eli’s scales, Eli crushed the bone demon’s head with his dragon claws and casually threw its corpse to the ground. The six demons died.

All of this seemed to take a long time, but from start to finish, it took less than three minutes.

After settling the matter, Eli did not stop.

Instead, he lowered his head and looked at the nearby Rolle City. Ignoring the warlocks who were trembling, Eli let out a dragon’s roar, followed by a black light condensing.

Boom!

The Shadow Dragon’s breath reappeared on the battlefield and flew toward Rolle City.

A light curtain rose up. This was the spell formation of Saul City, but it was useless. In an instant, the light curtain shattered into countless pieces and scattered on the ground.

The shadow continued to move forward and crashed into the city wall.

Bang!

The city wall cracked under the corrosion of the shadow power.

A few seconds later, as dust and gravel flew, the wall that had stood for thousands of years collapsed, revealing the core area of the Heart of the Abyss behind it.

“Attack!”

The dragon roared, waking up countless people from their shock.

Looking at the shattered city in front of them, everyone felt as if they had just woken up from a dream.

They were dead.

The city was broken.
