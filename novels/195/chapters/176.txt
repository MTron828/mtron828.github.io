177 Deputy Chairman

The White Tower.

In the familiar meeting room, fifteen seats were already filled. This was the first time in the last twenty years that all the top members of the White Tower had come. Instead, the person in the head seat, who had never been absent, was absent.

“How did he die?” Eli sat on the sixth seat and sighed.

Although he rarely made any contributions to the outside world, he had actually modified many magic potions that were suitable for various warlocks to use. So, even though there were already seven two-circle warlocks in the White Tower, he was still in sixth place.

He looked around and found that there were 15 people there. The three Deputy Speakers were still Kratos, Jesse, and Theron, but the other Members of Parliament had basically been replaced.

The ones who were familiar with Eli were the second Member of Parliament, Rawls, the eleventh member, Ross, and two new members under Kratos. The other seven had been replaced by other people a long time ago, except for two or three old people.

Thus, it was very rare for Eli to be able to sit here with the strength of a one-circle Warlock.

“Let’s have a chat about what we should do about this!” Kratos, who was the first to speak, had an even colder gaze. His aura was now at the limit of the second circle warlock, thanks to the blood soul flower.

“Yes, just proceed as we discussed before,” Theron said.

Although Marcus’s death was a pity, it was not without any warning.

He was already very old, to begin with, and after a few decades, he had finally exhausted the last of his life force. Hence, before he died, they had already discussed what would happen after his death.

“Yes.” Kratos nodded.

“Then, according to our vote, I will be the new speaker. This has already been passed. Of course, if anyone has any objections, you can raise them.” Kratos looked around and said domineeringly.

As the only two-circle Warlock in the White Tower, he was the most suitable candidate.

“I don’t.”

“I don’t have any, either.”

…

After a short while, President Kratos’s identity was confirmed, and he sat in the seat of the president without any hesitation. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“In that case, there will be two more things to discuss later. One is the simulation of the various disputes caused by the death of the former chairman, Marcus, and the new job planning for everyone.

“to facilitate the follow-up arrangements, let’s move on to the second matter, the division of duties.” Kratos took out another document and said.

Everyone nodded and waited.

“First, there will be three ministers. Theron and Jesse’s positions will remain the same. However, Herman will now be in charge of resource allocation and Resource Exchange.

“Although his strength is average, he’s the strongest among the council members when it comes to handling such matters and various assignments. It just so happens that this position doesn’t require too much combat power. This is my suggestion. Does anyone have any objections?”

Eli didn’t expect Kratos to mention him first.

“No, I didn’t,” Theron and Jessi were the first to agree.

With the change of the chairman, Kratos was bound to assign his men to important positions. No one could stop him.

Herman’s strength was average, and he was a good candidate. His ability had been proven in the past few decades, and what was interesting was that he wouldn’t lose even in an election.

Other than the president, there were four people on their side. The four people here would support Eli too because Eli had saved them in the arcane realm forty-five years ago.

Their status had been low in the past, but as time passed, they had come to a higher platform.

Therefore, even though Herman wasn’t as famous in the lower ranks, he was one of the most influential people in the upper ranks. He was a low-key person who wouldn’t be ignored.

As for the other councilmen, the first-circle warlocks were fine, but a few of the second-circle warlocks were unwilling to accept this, but they had no choice.

“Hmm, then Herman will take my previous position and become the new Deputy chairman.” Kratos slammed the table and made a decision.

“Well, next is the division of the others …” Kratos began to announce them one by one.

Rawls became the new first representative and Ross the seventh. The others had also undergone some rotations and were finally confirmed after voting.

This task took almost half a day.

It was morning when they came, and it was already night when the second event began. Also, Eli had changed his seat to the position of Deputy Chairman, which was close to Kratos.

It was pretty good. Just like before, with Kratos behind him, no one dared to touch him. He was still a resource distributor, and Eli liked this position very much.

He could gain benefits and no one would have any ideas about him unless they wanted to challenge Kratos.

“Secondly, Theron has always been in charge of the external Affairs of the disputes over the death of the chairman. Tell us about it.” After dealing with the post, Kratos continued.

“Yes.” Theron nodded and took out a document. “At present, the biggest impact of Lord’s death on us will come from the nearest force, the blood Alliance.

“As for the conflict between the Blood Alliance and us, I’m sure all of you are aware of it, so I won’t say much. They will definitely do something. In fact, as far as I know, they have already begun to take action, and a war may be inevitable.”

Theron’s eyes were serious as he analyzed the situation.

Everyone had a serious expression on their faces, and even Eli was frowning. Wasn’t it better for everyone to be safe and sound? Why do you have to fight and kill?

“Mm, then we have to make preparations in all aspects. Although we are stronger than before, Blood Alliance is also stronger too. We have to make preparations in all aspects.” Kratos nodded.

When a war was about to begin, the potions, materials, wizard tools, and Alchemy products were all important resources.

“There are two main aspects, one is external, and the other is internal. The external matters involve fighting, and the internal matters mostly are about logistics…” Theron analyzed.

“Then, who do you want to deal with outside and inside matters? it’s up to you to decide.” Kratos said.

“I’ll go out to deal with the matters outside.” Jessi raised his hand.

“Me too!” Rawls also raised his hand. As a possessor of the Balor bloodline, he was naturally arrogant and fierce.

One by one, the councilmen expressed their stand, and soon it was Eli’s turn.

“Herman, what do you think?” Kratos asked.

“I’ll stay in the camp and plan the distribution of resources,” Eli said bluntly.

What a joke. How could he go out? The outside was not as safe as the inside of the White Tower. Moreover, the Dice of fate spell had not been refined yet. He would not be at ease without this.

“Yes.” Kratos nodded. In his mind, Eli had always been strong in his ability to deal with things rather than his combat power, so it would be good for him to stay in the camp.

“Okay, that’s it then. Meeting adjourned.”

In the blink of an eye, another hour had passed, and the meeting that had lasted for a day finally came to an end.

After the meeting ended, the White Tower also began a new wave of adjustments with a new circle of power. All kinds of things were quickly handled, and Eli participated in the various distribution of resources.

Dealing with the Blood Alliance had also become the most important thing.

However, something shocking happened. For a full month, there was no movement from the blood Alliance, as if they had fallen into silence.

Eli understood that this was just the calm before the storm.

However, compared to the previous storm, he could no longer stand by the sidelines. This time, he was one of the core figures.

Things remained the same, but people had changed!
