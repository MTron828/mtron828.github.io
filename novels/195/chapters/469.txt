470 The Arrogant Warlock

A week later.

Thank you readers! Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

The moon was bright, and the stars were sparse!

Outside a valley in the southern part of the Western Region, Faerun Sil stroked the black and red marks on his body. He raised his head and looked at the entrance of the valley with his red eyes.

“Milord, it’s up ahead. That’s the encampment of the Western Region’s Warlock Alliance!” A Warlock came to his side and lowered his head to look at Fearun respectfully, not daring to overstep his boundaries!

The person in front of him was Lord Nero’s new trusted aide, and he was in charge of the Warlock Union’s part in this operation!

“I understand. It’s a good time to test the power that Milord gave me.” Faerun licked his black barbed tongue and clenched his fists. The power bestowed by his lord made him feel invincible!

“Let’s go!”

Faerun shouted and flew straight toward the valley.

Dozens of people in the forest behind him quickly followed!

“Ah, who is it?”

A guard behind the valley illuminated Faerun, but with a wave of his hand, the Warlock did not even let out a cry. A black flame burned the guard into ashes.

However, the Warlocks were still alerted. In an instant, the valley lit up, and a few Warlocks flew up!

“Kill them, don’t let any of them escape!” A trace of bloodlust flashed in Faerun’s eyes as he flew toward the Warlocks. In a few seconds, the Warlocks fell to the ground!

“Kill! Hahahaha!” Faerun shouted excitedly in the sky!

On the ground, killing…Roar…Wails echoed in the valley!

And this was only the biggest one. At this moment, in the other parts of the Western Region, all the existence of the Warlock Union and the Death Mandala was rapidly being erased!

A day later, Eli heard about it from Liliana.

“Sir, this matter has angered the forces in the central region to death. In particular, the big shots of the Warlock Union have expressed that they will investigate this matter thoroughly.” Liliana said.

“Warlock Union!” Eli blinked. What did this have to do with the Warlock Union?

He had originally planned to let Miya take the blame for him. After all, Black Mandala didn’t have any stronghold in the Western Region. Even if he died, Miya probably wouldn’t care.

But why did she suddenly have a connection with the Warlock Union?

He couldn’t figure it out and couldn’t understand it.

“This matter has received a lot of attention, but unfortunately, there has been no discovery. These people have a meticulous strategy, and their actions are so unified. In fact, these insiders did not even spread any news. How can they have such loyal subordinates? I have been ordered to investigate this matter, but unfortunately, there are no clues yet.” Liliana said.

What a joke, they had all been enslaved by the Demon Lord, so how could they not be loyal?

Liliana was stunned by what she heard.

Just as she was about to ask more questions, the door suddenly opened. Nikola quickly came in and said something to Eli.

“I’m sorry. Someone from the Central Region has arrived. I might have to excuse myself!” said Eli to Liliana. He then followed Nikola out of the room.

Along the way, Eli asked Nikola, “Are you sure it’s someone from the Warlock Union?”

“Yes, my lord. The people from the Warlock Union have indeed come and specifically asked to see you!” Nikola shook his head helplessly and deliberately emphasized the name!

“They named me?”

Eli listened to the contemptuous words and smiled with interest.

“Then let us go and meet this lord.”

Eli pursed his lips.

..

After a while.

Eli saw the Warlock, who had come from the distant Central Region.

He was wearing a black warlock robe with a high collar. He looked like he was in his thirties, and his aura was half a step away from the fifth circle. He raised his head with an arrogant expression as if he was looking down on everything.

His face was very long, like a shoehorn. Due to his bloodline, his eyes were vertical, with 30% coldness, 20% neglect, and 50% disdain.

The first sentence stunned Eli.

A sharp voice came out of his mouth, “I’m here for two reasons. First, I feel that the Warlock Union thinks that you guys are not bad and have the potential to join us. You only need to pay 20% of the resources of your organization yearly to join us.

“The second thing is that I’m here to investigate the matter of this branch. I need your cooperation!”

Join the Warlock Union and give up 20% of the resources!

What f * cking harsh conditions!

Eli was stunned. He had long heard that the Warlock Union was high and mighty, but this was the first time he had come into contact with the Warlock Union. He did not expect them to be so arrogant!

According to Liliana, this was because the Warlock Union was formed by the noblest Warlock families with the highest bloodlines in the world. At first, it was fine as they managed the world together. However, as time passed and the noble bloodlines were added, this force became like a decadent dynasty, arrogant and contemptuous of everything!

Of course, they did have the right to be arrogant because they were really strong!

However… He didn’t care about these things!

If you don’t give me face, don’t expect me to give you face!

” I’m sorry, ” Eli said with a fake smile. ” The people of our faction have things to do during this period of time. We can’t help you. I’ll have to trouble you to collect them yourself.

“As for the matter of joining a force, we’ll talk about it after you finish your mission!”

After saying that, he directly strode out of the room without any intention of staying.

He didn’t lack time, but he wouldn’t waste it on people who were worthless.

As he watched Eli leave, the Warlock’s eyes widened. He gritted his teeth and cursed, “Hmph, what a country bumpkin!”

However, he didn’t chase after them. That would be too embarrassing!

After he was done with his investigation, he would naturally show this warlock what it meant to be powerful. Perhaps he did not even know what it meant to be a half-step fifth-circle warlock.

The Warlock snorted coldly and left the place in large strides.

On the other side.

“Are we letting him go, my lord?” Nikola asked curiously.

Eli’s face was calm as he continued, “Do you think he can finish the investigation alive?”

Realization dawned on Nicholas, and he smiled too!

Investigate the truth?

Wasn’t that courting death?

..

Three days later.

Eli received the news of the Warlock’s death.

The corpse was found in a valley. It was said that the entire body had turned into a sticky state, and even the bones were about to melt. He was melted alive before he died, and he had suffered extreme torture!

This matter had infuriated the Warlock Union, but they did not send anyone over this time!

Half-step fifth circle was already a very high level of combat power. They could not afford to lose another Warlock of this level. However, they condemned Eli for not helping them.

Eli didn’t even bother with him and went straight into the laboratory!

There was no time!

Nero was getting more and more reckless.

He felt that time was running out.
