For the third-circle warlocks who had experienced a long and difficult journey, a short rest was enough for them to recover. Thus, early the next morning, a male warlock walked out from the group.

“It’s so comfortable!”

The Warlock walked out of the Wizard Tower and felt the texture of the ground under his feet. He smiled.

Compared to the feeling of being in the sky, he preferred the feeling of being on the ground.

His name was Diogo, and he was one of Luo ye’s followers. He was also a third-circle Warlock from the Holy tower headquarters.

“I’ve never been to the West Coast, so I don’t know what it looks like!” Diogo’s gaze crossed the villa area and looked toward the Main City in the distance.

Mage towers stood in great numbers, and elemental fluctuations rose and fell. It was a bustling scene. Although it was far from the central continent, it still seemed to have unique regional characteristics.

“Let’s go out and take a look.” Diogo pondered.

Luo ye didn’t restrict their travel but only told them not to cause trouble!

With that thought in mind, Diogo tidied his clothes and walked out.

Soon, he came to the only path that led to the other area, which was also the path they had come here before.

The road was located on the east side of the area, connecting to the main area of the city. There was a white arch that was not very wide.

But just as he reached the door, someone happened to come in.

“You must be the Lord of the Holy tower. I was sent by Lord Udo to serve you, my Lord. If you don’t mind, let me take you out for a walk.”

Diogo looked at the man.

He had black hair and black eyes. He was quite good-looking, and his aura was only that of an ordinary three-ring warlock. However, his eyes had a mysterious charm that could enchant people. The most intriguing thing was that his pupils were silver.

“Alright,” Diogo nodded.

Since they were sent by the branch here, they should be very familiar with this place.

He couldn’t help but lower his head and look into this person’s eyes.

The mysterious silver color also made him a little dazed.

When he opened his eyes again, he found himself standing beside the White arch, but in the opposite direction.

He subconsciously looked at the man beside him and patted his shoulder. “Thank you, Herman. I had a lot of fun this time.”

Beside Diogo, Eli smiled humbly.”What are you saying, my Lord? this is what I should do.”

“Alright,” Diogo nodded, feeling a little tired! “then I’ll go back first. I feel a little tired from today’s shopping!”

Diogo scratched his head. He clearly felt that he had just left!

And what did he shop for?

It seemed like he just ate, drank, and went to some places to play, but for some reason, his memory was a little blurry, as if he had done it and had not done it.

The wonderful feeling still lingered in his heart, but he subconsciously ignored it.

He scratched his head and returned to his residence.

He just went out for a walk, what could have happened?

“I’ve progressed more than half of the third level of the silvery-white eye. Its power is really not bad!”

In the distance, looking at Diogo’s back, Eli shook his head.

He didn’t go out for a walk. He just watched Diogo stare blankly for a few hours and smile from time to time.

It didn’t seem to be as difficult to fool this group of people as he had imagined.

“In ten days. I feel that we can just tell them the location in ten days!” Eli took out a small stool and sat down by the arch, then waited for the next person who wanted to go out.

It was a bright and beautiful day.

On the other side.

As soon as Diogo returned, he was called over by Hall.

“Diogo, did you find anything strange or interesting when you went out? ” Hall looked at Diogo and asked.

Even though he had checked the people nearby, he still felt uncomfortable.

His bloodline was the human-faced giant spider, a Spider-type third-circle creature. It usually lived in cold, damp, and dark environments, which also gave it the ability to sense danger. This had saved him many times.

It was the same this time. As soon as he came here, his bloodline made him feel a little uncomfortable.

That was why he came to ask again.

When Diogo heard this question, he replied respectfully, ” Sir, everything is normal, but there is one thing that is really interesting!”

“Oh?”

Hall’s gaze turned serious.

“Sir, the humans here have slightly different physiques from the humans in our world. I found that the women here are generally plumper!” Diogo said with a serious expression.

He had personally experienced it, and it was that good brother who had brought him there.

It was very moist!

Hall was speechless.

He had never been so speechless in his life.

“Get lost!” The corner of Hall’s mouth twitched, and he glanced at him.

Apart from being his subordinate, Diogo was also his nephew!

“Alright!”

...

Diogo wasn’t angry and left with a smile.

Seeing him leave, Hall also relaxed a little.

It seemed that he had really been overthinking.

Could it be that the human-faced giant spider was also uncomfortable in a foreign place?

..

Time passed day by day.

Other than Rou Ye, the rest of the Holy tower’s warlocks had also gone out to stroll around the Holy Tower City. They were all led by the Warlock, Herman, who had been sent by Udo.

Everyone was having a good time, even Hall.

Many of them also treated Eli as a good friend and even invited Herman to go back with them to the central continent, but he politely declined.

Just like that, Eli fooled them for ten days.

Every day, he would sit at the door and watch them fall into their fantasies before returning.

...

Of course, it wasn’t like he didn’t do anything. He also learned a lot about the central continent.

This included the composition of the forces, the races, the strength of the strong, the local customs, the current situation, and so on. This gave Eli a rough impression of the most prosperous area in this world.

First of all, the central continent was at least hundreds of times larger than the West Coast. It was a truly huge continent, occupying 60% of the world’s land. It was said that the earliest Mage forces were born here.

In the past, many mage forces had occupied this land and created incomparable glory.

Of course, that was all in history. At the moment, the situation in the central continent was completely different from before.

With the disappearance of Mage, Warlock families took over this land and re-divided it, forming the so-called “bloodline forces.”

Mage had almost disappeared from the continent, and their situation was much worse than the West Coast. At least there was one on the West Coast, but mages had become a legend on the central continent. Only a few other Mages were still around.

Furthermore, unlike what Eli had expected, the Mages seemed to have only taken their own people back then and left behind many other races. This resulted in many other races in the central continent, including elves, dwarves, and races that were once slaves of the mage.

They each occupied their own area, and because they were not weak at all.

Finally, Eli also understood the current combat power situation of the mage world.

Celestials were the highest levels.

Even the Holy tower only had two celestials.

There weren’t as many celestial in the central continent as one might imagine!

This made Eli very happy. This meant that as long as he became a celestial, at least in this world, he would have a certain guarantee of safety.

“The Mage’s departure has a huge impact on this world!” Eli sighed.

If one were to go back in time by 5000 years, a celestial would be a slightly stronger version of a normal mage.

But it was still good for him.

At least, the less important a mage’s item was, the easier it would be for him to get it.

High-level knowledge, flying sky cities, dangerous mage weapons, tall wizard towers, prosperous and strange small spaces, and even … the legendary gray’s tower.

A glimmer of hope appeared in Eli’s eyes. Even now, he could not imagine what kind of creation could be as large as a moon.

He wanted to take a look!

“But not now!”

Eli shook his head. He would wait until he was strong enough.

He would stay here for a few thousand years first, and when he was stronger, he would go and get those things.

He didn’t lack time anyway.

“Take it slow!” The dejected look on Eli’s face was swept away as he looked towards the villa area.

Compared to those, he should pay more attention to this group of warlocks.

It had been ten days!

It was time for them to go to the ruins!

With that in mind, Eli tidied up his clothes, put on an anxious expression, and ran towards the villa area, his speed getting faster and faster.

While running, he shouted, “My Lords, we’ve found the ruins!”
