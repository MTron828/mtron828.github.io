57 The City of Perfume

The tour was only a front, but the purpose of the Bryne Empire was still to seek an alliance.

Of course, this was definitely not something that could be done in a day or two. Even if it was just a rough estimate, Eli estimated that it would take more than a few months. By the time he returned, the learner’s test should have already ended.

If nothing went wrong, Herman would become a learner by then, and so would Rias. After all, even though she had decided to inherit part of the family fortune, she would never give up her identity as a scholar, which was a great bonus.

Only the pitiful eli was still an ordinary librarian.

Therefore, he decided to take a break and go out to find a channel for herbs. This way, his trip would not be in vain.

However, this plan was destroyed by marquis Alina at the very beginning.

Out of consideration for the safety of the environment, except for a few people, everyone had to stay in the hotel for three days. They could only leave after that.

With no other choice, Eli could only stay in the same room as scholar Clement for three days.

Each room had two bedrooms.

Every day, Eli would stay in his room and think about some problems. Although scholar Clement could not go out either, he would hang out with the other scholars every day. During this period, he invited Eli, but he was rejected.

Finally, three days passed as Eli anxiously waited.

The sun had just come out that day when Eli jumped out of bed.

But it wasn’t just him. Scholar Clement had also woken up early and even earlier than him.

“Eli, are you going out?” scholar clement asked eli as he tidied up the suit he had specially bought for going out.

“Yes, I’m planning to go out and see the difference between Duoling and Jun Lin.” Eli replied with a smile.

“Be careful. There are many mercenaries in Duoling. Be careful and run to a place with more people if you’re in danger.” Scholar Clement reminded.

“Yes, I understand.” Eli nodded.

Then, he watched as scholar Clement tidied up his clothes, took out some perfume from his pocket, and sprayed it on himself. “teacher, are you going to meet a beautiful lady? ”

“What nonsense!” Scholar Clement glared at Eli and said, “Don’t you know Duoling’s other name, the perfume city? Perfume is very important in this city.”

“Of course, I know. I was just joking? ” smiling, eli also took out the perfume he had prepared from his pocket and simply sprayed some on.

It hadn’t been long since Duoling was called the perfume city, probably around 20 years ago. It started because Queen Cynthia loved perfume. In order to please the Queen, more and more new perfumes were developed. Slowly, Duoling became known as the perfume city.

Therefore, there was no shortage of perfume stores in Duoling. There might not be any other stores every few dozen meters, but there were definitely many stores selling perfume.

In this country, everyone had a special feeling for perfume. It was also a custom to wear some perfume when going out. They were doing as the Romans did.

“Teacher, where are you planning to go today?” After making a joke to liven up the atmosphere, Eli continued to ask.

“I’m going to visit some old friends. If you’re willing, you can come with me, but I’m sure you’ll reject me, so I didn’t tell you.” scholar clement shot him a glance.

After more than eight years together, eli knew clement very well, and clement also knew eli very well.

Eli didn’t answer and only smiled. As expected of his teacher.

“Let’s leave together.”

The two of them finished packing at almost the same time and walked out together.

Along the way, clement chatted with eli. Just as they reached the hall, they saw a group of people walking over.

Leading them was marquis Alina, followed by a few earls and a professional diplomat.

At this time, the nobles were all dressed up, and with the addition of the diplomat, it was needless to say that they were going to the palace for their first meeting.

When he saw that it was marquis Alina and the others, scholar clement subconsciously pulled eli aside to make way. After all, they weren’t familiar with each other. However, something that he didn’t expect happened. Marquis Alina actually greeted him. “good morning, scholar clement!”

Clement was instantly stunned.

He did not expect that marquis Alina would take the initiative to greet him.

“Good morning, Lord Marquis.” scholar clement stammered and replied.

“Good morning, Lord Marquis,” Eli replied respectfully.

“Yes, we still have things to do, so we’ll be leaving first.” The Marquis said casually. He nodded and walked out.

The counts behind him also looked at scholar Clement with strange expressions.

Although it was a simple greeting, everyone could tell that marquis Alina was definitely related to this scholar clement. Otherwise, the marquis would not have stopped to say good morning.

‘It seems that this scholar is not simple.’ the few of them silently remembered this and left with the Marquis.

“Eli, did you see that? This is my academic status. ” after the marquis and the others left, although scholar clement was still a little confused, he still smiled and spoke to eli.

“Of course, it seems that your reputation has already spread to the upper levels!” Said Eli with a smile as he cast a glance at the Marquis who was leaving.

Needless to say, this was the Marquis’ kind gesture. As for who he was talking to, it was obvious to Eli. After all, Eli’s teacher was present, and he couldn’t just greet him directly, as that was not in line with the etiquette of the nobles.

He couldn’t possibly say hello to Eli. After all, the fact that Eli had saved the Marquis was a secret, so he could only say hello to scholar Clement.

“Hahaha!” upon hearing Eli’s flattery, clement’s face bloomed with joy. He took out a money bag from his clothes and took out a dozen silver tarls, handing them to eli.

“Take it and spend it. I’m in a good mood today.”

“Okay, teacher.” Eli took the silver tarts from scholar Clement with a smile.

It would be a waste not to take free money.

After putting silver tarl into his wallet, eli and scholar Clement parted ways at the entrance of the hotel.

Clement headed in one direction while eli headed toward a carriage.

“Sir, would you like to rent a carriage?” before the carriage, the man bent down and asked eli.

” yes, I need a carriage that is as comfortable as possible. I will rent it for a week. How much would it cost? ” Eli stated his request.

The upcoming negotiations would have nothing to do with him, so he decided to hire a carriage to take him around Duoling.

Upon hearing the request, the man quickly found a carriage that met Eli’s requirements. The horse was a maroon-colored horse, and the carriage was relatively exquisite, very much in line with Eli’s requirements.

“This one.” Eli was very satisfied.

“Five silver tars in total.” The man said with a smile.

“Sure!” eli nodded. Without haggling, he immediately took out five silver tarls.

After paying, the man quickly called the coachman over. He was a middle-aged man who looked a little old.

“Let’s go!” Eli also got into the carriage.

“Sir, where are we going?” The driver’s voice was very muffled.

“Um, the most fun place.”

“Let’s go to Camellia Lane, then. The most beautiful women in Duoling are there.” The coachman thought for a moment and said. Then, the carriage began to move slowly.

‘Camellia lane?’

At this moment, Eli blinked his eyes in the carriage.

‘Does he mean...’

However, since the carriage had already started moving, it would definitely be troublesome to turn around. It was better not to make things difficult for the coachman. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

He was too kind.
