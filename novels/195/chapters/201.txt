202 Cleaning Up

Three days later.

Eli arrived at the base camp of the iris mages.

There was a huge campsite deep in the mountains. There were mage Towers and thousands of mages. Eli only took a glance and blended into the crowd.

Walking around the campsite, there were all kinds of shops selling things on both sides. There were magic potions, mage weapons, and even bloodlines. Of course, there were also some shops selling knowledge.

After a few hundred years of development, the iris campsite was no longer the same as before. Not many people still remembered the person in charge, Tijie.

“What a great change.” Eli looked around and walked straight into the camp.

The closer he got to the center, the stronger the mages he saw. There were many apprentices in the outer circle. When Eli reached the tower in the center, he could even feel the aura of several second-circle mages.

“Have they rebuilt it?” Eli looked at the tower in front of him. It seemed to have been built on top of the tower that used to be there. Both the height and the area it covered had been greatly improved.

There were two more apprentices guarding the door. Eli thought for a moment, and then a wave of mental power swept past. As the two apprentices shook their heads, he had already entered the tower.

“I felt something was wrong just now!” One of the guards said to the apprentice beside him.

“It should be an illusion.” The other guard frowned as if he felt something was wrong, but he couldn’t put his finger on it.

“Is that so?” The guard shook his head and didn’t take it to heart. He continued to stand guard.

..

In a room on the highest floor of the tower, Catarina frowned and let out a long sigh.

With the expansion of the irises’ campsite, the area of the campsite became larger and larger, and there were more and more people. in the process of expansion, they encountered many other forces, and the campsite became more and more difficult to control.

The most difficult part was that even though she was brought up by Tijie, there were still many different factions in her camp. Her power was not enough to control everything.

“I’m only at the early stage of the second circle, but there are already mages in the middle stage. I need to get stronger.” Catarina shook her head in confusion.

Just as she was lost in her thoughts, there was a sudden knock on the door.

Catarina looked over, a little puzzled. No one had reported anything, and why would someone come at this time?

“Come in!” Catarina shouted. This was the campsite, and there were many second-circle mages outside. She was not afraid at all.

The door opened, and a person walked in. Catarina’s eyes widened.

Although the person in front of him looked very unfamiliar, the familiar fluctuations and the aura of the soul brand in her body at this time all indicated who this person was.

“Lord Roland!”

Catarina let out a cry of surprise.

“Yes, it’s me, but my current name is called Alex.” Eli nodded and walked in.

Although he had no connection with Catarina, he had a soul imprint on her, so there was nothing to worry about. Besides, she had always been very disciplined.

“Lord Roland, no, Lord Alex, why have you come? ” Catarina quickly stood up. It was almost impossible for a mage to go against a Soul brand.

“I came out to lie low for a while.” Eli sat on the sofa at the side and said, “I’ll be staying here for a while, so we can slowly talk about things.”

“My Lord, are you planning to stay here for a long time?” Catarina’s eyes lit up. Although she wasn’t too sure how strong Eli was, the battle from a hundred years ago had still spread around quite a bit.

Nikola, who was a two-ring mage, was being suppressed by a mysterious mage.

Although she didn’t see the image at the time, she guessed that it should be true. It meant that Eli was at least a peak second-circle mage or even a third-circle mage.

With such a Mage around, her previous troubles were nothing. They could be easily resolved.

“Yes, I’m indeed planning to live here. You can arrange a job for me.” Eli thought for a moment. His mental force had already reached its limit, and at most, he could only see if there was any slight increase in the compression, so he did not plan to stay in the arcane realm for decades this time.

This time, his plan was to relax in the mage camp or to study for a few decades, to see how the current mages learned, to see if there was any new knowledge, or to communicate with the mages.

It was impossible to stay behind closed doors for a long time. He needed human interaction to find the truth.

“That’s great. There are still many positions available in irises. My Lord, do you have any requirements regarding your position?” Catarina asked.

“Not outside. I want to be in the camp and no fighting involved.”

“Yes.” Catarina fell into deep thought. There weren’t many positions that fulfilled so many conditions. A minute later, she looked at Eli and said, “I’ve thought about it. There should be three positions that can satisfy you, Sir.

“The first is responsible for resource allocation. The second is the person in charge of the camp’s Tower of Knowledge. The Tower of Knowledge is in charge of integrating, collecting, and selling the knowledge in the camp, and the third is the person in charge of the camp’s laboratory. Lord, which one do you think is more suitable?”

After listening, Eli made a choice. “Then let’s go with the second one.”

He had done enough of the job of resource allocation. Although the laboratory could also come into contact with knowledge, it was still relatively independent. The second job could allow him to interact directly with the entire camp, which was the most suitable for his requirements.

“After that, I’ll have a meeting to introduce you to the others and hand this job over to you.” Catarina nodded.

However, she looked at Eli with an embarrassed expression and said, “However, my Lord, I don’t have that much control over the camp. I might run into some obstacles, and I’ll need some time.”

“Obstacles?”

On the sofa, Eli raised his head and glanced at her.

It was true that an early-stage two-circle mage could not control the camp well. After all, he had just sensed the aura of a middle-stage two-circle mage. However, Catarina had already done very well.

“Don’t worry. I’ll take care of it!” A smile appeared on Eli’s face.

He would try to reason with them and use the truth to conquer them.

..

In the blink of an eye, five days had passed.

Many people knew that a powerful mage had come to the camp.

Second circle mage, Alex.

It was said that he had a good relationship with Catarina, the current head of irises, and Roland, who had disappeared a long time. He was currently in charge of the Tower of Knowledge.

At first, it was said that many mages were against this mage taking on such a role, but later it was said that he visited all the mages in the camp one by one and then agreed.

...

Of course, there were a few mages who were still limping and some who were still lying at home. No matter what, this was a victory for Alex. As for how the actual persuasion went, no one knew.

..

In a mage Tower.

Eli stood by the window and looked at the camp outside, smiling.

In five days, he had cleaned up the entire camp. This made the camp completely under his control. After doing this, he could slowly develop.

All he needed to do was wait for all the materials to be collected, and he would be able to advance to the third circle.

As for this period of time, it was better to keep a low profile. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

After a hundred years of silent growth, less than a month after coming out, Eli would once again fall into a dormant state.

This was the self-cultivation of an immortal.
