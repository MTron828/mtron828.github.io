350 The Manticore Family’s Response

Amanta still didn’t know that his old friend of many years had died. He only felt happy at the thought of a large number of resources coming.

From his point of view, a Nebula Warlock against a newly advanced celestial Warlock, wasn’t that a piece of cake?

The gap between celestial ranks was extremely large, and each rank had a huge difference. The difference between nebula warlock and micro star warlock was huge. It was not just a difference of several bloodline cores (similar to celestial stars but for warlocks) but a categorical difference.

This was also the reason why there was no essential difference between the fourth circle, but the division was more detailed. Even a small difference in the stage was almost impossible to overcome.

Other than the Magus world, some worlds had even divided this stage into three levels to show the difference.

At the Nebula level, their bloodline was at least three times that of a micro-star, so their strength was a completely different matter.

As for battling warlocks above their rank, that was even more impossible.

“Poor Eli, I don’t want this to happen either. If you want to blame someone, blame this world. Blame this man-eating world.”

Amanta had a look of pity as he sighed.

…..

On the other side.

In a building, in a room.

A small blood basin was placed on the ground.

A Warlock with his eyes closed was bandaging his right arm. It was obvious that he had just drained the blood.

He carefully felt the power of the blood, and a connection that belonged to the bloodline was gradually established in his heart. A human face gradually appeared in the blood basin on the ground and began to speak.

“What’s going on that you’re using this method of communication?” The bloody face asked in surprise.

For warlocks, since the methods of the Mages were lost, they usually used magical beasts to transmit information, but for emergencies, they used bloodline connections. The price was a large amount of blood, and the warlocks had to have the same bloodline. Furthermore, the connection had to be established in advance. Thus, unless there were special circumstances, they would not use it.

“Sir, a branch-tower of the bloodline tower has appeared in Holmes city.” The Warlock said quickly. He was a Warlock from the Manticore family.

“Oh?” The bloody face seemed a little surprised.

A few seconds later, he said, ” it’s fine. We have an easy time fighting the main bloodline tower. It’s just a branch tower.”

“However, my Lord, there are three high-grade mechanical airships in this branch tower. They are at least at the third circle. I think my Lord might be interested in them.”

“Mechanical airship?” The bloody face let out a surprised sound. “It just so happens that I need to prepare some presents lately. This is indeed good.”

“Then what’s the owner’s strength?” The bloody face asked, lost in thought.

“I’m not sure, Sir. They didn’t get off the airship. Their leader was invited to the banquet, but I know that this is a branch-tower on the West Coast.”

“The branch-tower on the West Coast? The place that the bloodline tower abandoned?” The bloody face seemed to have heard something funny.

“I’ll send a force along the way to help. They have a celestial that’s not much different from the bloodline tower’s main tower. It’ll be easy to complete this task.” The bloody face rose and fell like a demon before it slowly disappeared.

The Warlock kept the blood basin and left.

They didn’t even care about the main tower. What could a branch-tower do?

In fact, they wouldn’t have cared about this branch if they didn’t have the airships.

…

At this moment.

In a tent some distance away, six people were sitting at a table.

Suddenly, a man in the corner raised his head. His face was pale, and he revealed a cold smile.

“Wellington, what happened?” At the main seat of the table, a Warlock with a square face looked at the man.

“Lord Jerre, a small branch of the bloodline tower has arrived in the central continent to reinforce the bloodline tower.” The man replied respectfully.

“Oh, it seems that this branch tower is very special. Otherwise, they wouldn’t use a bloodline connection to communicate the info.” Just then, another woman spoke. She was sitting next to Jerre.

The two of them were the highest combat power of the Manticore family.

“lady Jalin, it’s because they seem to have three high-level mechanical airships. They’re rare and good things.” Answered the pale-faced Wellington.

“Oh? Airships? No wonder.” Jerre nodded.

They couldn’t replicate such a good thing from the mage era.

“I’ll leave it to you then. I will allow you to mobilize some of the family’s resources to get those three airships.” Jerre continued.

“Yes, my Lord.” Wellington nodded again.

Then, no one mentioned it again because it was just a small branch-tower. There was really nothing to pay attention to.

“The next step is to negotiate with the Amina family, the force behind the bloodline tower,” Jesse continued after a while. “After the resources are divided, we can make our final move on the bloodline tower.”

“What a joke. The bloodline tower protected the precious resources found in the bloodline tower area for the Amina family, but they didn’t even realize that the Amina family had sold them out.” Jalin chuckled as she covered her mouth.

The others also laughed.

This time, they only attacked the bloodline tower because of their interests.

There was only one reason why the bloodline tower still existed: they had yet to reach an agreement with the faction behind the bloodline tower.

As for the bloodline tower, no one cared.

There was only one celestial. Everyone here was a celestial, and they could easily take control of the bloodline tower.

As for the main tower summoning a branch, it was just a dying struggle in their eyes.

For a moment, the atmosphere in the room became lively.

…

Very quickly.

...

A piece of news came from Wellington.

On the way to the bloodline tower, there was a plain, where the Four Seasons garden’s Warlock Academy was located.

In the center was a garden. In the garden, dozens of flowers grew. The flowers wriggled and sprayed out green mist to block the vision. In the mist, there was a small wooden house.

In the wooden house.

An old man had his eyes closed.

He looked very old. His face was full of wrinkles, and blue veins was exposed. It was obvious that the blood inside was green. His legs were entangled by thorns. At this time, a flower grew out of one of the thorns, and a letter was spat out.

The old man picked up the letter and started reading.

“A branch of the bloodline tower is coming. They want me to snatch their airships. I can take any other resources.” The old man suddenly opened his eyes, revealing his green eyeballs.

As a subordinate force of the Manticore family, he had received a mission.

Fortunately, the mission this time wasn’t too difficult. At least, it was easy for him.

“Airships? This is good stuff!” The old man knocked on the vines beside him.

...

After a short while, a woman walked in.

“My lord, what are your orders?”

“Pay attention to the sky. There might be a few airships coming here soon. Inform me when you find them.” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Airship?” The woman was puzzled.

“It’s something left behind from the mage era. It’s a mechanical object that can fly in the sky.” The old man explained.

To the warlocks of this generation, airships were probably something that no one had ever seen.

“Yes, my Lord.” The woman nodded and left.

The door closed, and the old man closed his eyes again.
