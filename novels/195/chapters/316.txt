The valley was the main territory of the Wanderer Alliance, but not all warlocks lived there. There were many people around, but they were all a few kilometers away.

Therefore, when the terrifying explosion happened, countless warlocks felt their houses tremble, and then their ears rang.

They all ran out of their houses and saw the 100-meter-high mushroom cloud in the valley.

The warlocks’ eyes were wide open, filled with a bright light.

“What happened?”

A third-circle warlock’s body and face were trembling.

Suddenly, he seemed to have sensed something. His eyes widened, and his bloodline surged. In an instant, he transformed into a bloodline, and scales instantly appeared on his skin.

At the same time, he only felt a huge shock wave pass by. This was the aftermath of the explosion.

Fortunately, this did not affect him much. A few seconds later, he retracted his bloodline and could clearly sense that the air here seemed to have become much hotter and was filled with fire elements.

“I have to go and take a look!”

The Warlock’s body trembled. He knew that something big had happened.

He immediately flew toward the valley.

Along the way, the closer he was to the center of the explosion, the more fire elements there were. He even activated his bloodline to avoid this kind of damage. He was not the only one. Whether it was in the sky or on the ground, he saw many people gathering towards the valley.

Soon, he arrived at the side of the valley.

“Ah!”

The Warlock was completely stunned by the scene before him.

There was no longer a Valley. The original Valley had been razed to the ground. The surrounding rocks had been blown into several parts, and the buildings inside had long disappeared. Even the ground had turned red.

He hesitated for a moment and continued walking.

Soon, he reached the central area.

At this time, the ground in the central area had almost turned into a translucent crimson red. The flames had directly crystallized the ground and sand.

Among them, he saw a black bracelet, but it was almost half-melted and damaged.

His eyes widened. If he remembered correctly, this was an accessory of Lord Guyiduo, he had seen it before.

If the accessories were already like this, then the lord…

His throat moved, and he continued to look around. He found a few more remains, a few of which he guessed were half-step celestial warlocks who had just arrived.

They were all dead!

He only felt a slight headache.

“What the hell happened?” He held his head and let out a painful cry.

If the masters died, the Wanderer Alliance would also disband.

Then what should they do?

At this moment, many people came in from afar. They were all shocked when they saw this scene.

..

The next day.

The news of the annihilation of the Wanderer Alliance’s high-level forces had completely blown up the entire West Coast.

Whether it was the tower of bloodline, its subordinate forces, or the other forces, they were all confused by this sudden situation.

They had clearly been fighting the day before, but they were all dead the next day.

This was a shock!

Furthermore, there were so many powerful people. How did they all die?

This time, Herman’s name was spread again. It was spread by the people on the front line that day. They spread the news that Herman had killed thousands of warlocks and three half-step celestial warlocks on the battlefield. Then, someone told them that they had seen a red shooting star in the sky on the way to the wanderer’s alliance base.

As soon as they contacted each other, they knew that it was the work of a Warlock named Herman.

Then, the information about Herman was found.

The new generation of warlocks finally knew that the bloodline family had such a powerful person.

Many people with bad intentions also went into hiding. They were a little afraid.

..

As for Eli, he had already silently returned to the bloodline tower.

This time, he had gained a good understanding of celestial.

The only pity was that he didn’t test his bloodline avatar this time. He could only do it next time.

He also understood the difference between a celestial and a third-circle warlock. They were on two completely different dimensions, and there was no comparison at all. At this level, even in the Mage world, he was definitely not considered weak.

Of course, Eli felt that he was still lacking in too many things.

Whether it was in terms of knowledge or anything else, he was far from enough.

Regarding this, Eli also understood that he wouldn’t be able to resolve it in a short period of time. He could only wait for the future since he wouldn’t be going to the central continent for the time being.

Slowly, Eli walked into the laboratory again.

He began his research and study.

..

Three days passed in the blink of an eye.

...

Aisha came to visit Eli.

“Because of your interference, teacher, the wanderer’s Alliance is no longer our match. In a while, we should be able to take back our former territory.” Aisha reported.

“Understood, ” Eli said.

“Oh, by the way, Grandmaster, we seem to have found something in an abandoned base of the Wanderer Alliance. You might be interested in it!” Aisha said.

“What is it?” Eli asked curiously.

“Hehe, Grandmaster will know when the time comes. It’s still in the process of transportation.” Aisha replied with a smile.

“Alright,” Eli smiled.

..

Three days later.

A box was sent to his Wizard Tower.

It was a black rectangular box, long and narrow, with complicated patterns and lines carved on its surface. If Eli was not mistaken, it should be a spell formation.

...

This should be a box from the mage era.

This piqued his interest, and he gently opened the box.

Inside the box, there was a wizard staff!

The body of the staff was about 1.5 meters long. It was made of Mithril and had a spiral shape. At the head of the staff, there was a purple crystal that seemed to have liquid flowing inside.

A mage’s cane!

Eli squinted his eyes. Although this staff was only a third circle staff, it was the best of the best. He had never seen anything better than this.

It had been a long time since he last used a mage staff, mainly because he didn’t have a suitable one. However, he liked the one in front of him.

Eli took out the staff and held it in his hand. His power of the will quickly imprinted a mark on the staff, and he quickly learned the information about it.

“Mo Luo’s staff!”

Eli placed his wand over his head, feeling very comfortable.

Although he was already a celestial, the wand could still provide him with a lot of support. It could increase his power by about one-twentieth. It was already very impressive for a third-circle staff.

“it’s just that the crystal at the head is a little lacking. Otherwise, it might have had the chance to become a 4th-circle staff!”

The Amethyst was beautiful, but it was a pity that the quality of the item was so-so, which lowered its standard. If he had the opportunity to get a better staff head and melt it down, it might really become a four-ring staff.

Of course, the current one was not bad either.

Eli liked it.

“Let’s call it the scepter of Eli.” Eli very naturally changed the name of the staff.

With the death of the higher-ups of the wanderer alliance, the bloodline tower quickly seized back most of the area occupied by the wanderer alliance, and the territory of the wanderer alliance shrank rapidly.

Finally, as the last resource point was taken back, the bloodline tower finally regained its former territory. As for the Wanderers, some were preparing to return to the central continent, while others had sneaked away.

This force had completely disappeared from the West Coast.

Although there were still warlocks from the central continent, most of them chose to join the bloodline tower. Of course, they were allowed to join selectively, but this also increased the bloodline tower’s power bit by bit.

Everything was going in the right direction.

Another interesting thing was that Aisha had ordered many statues of Eli to be placed in the areas of the bloodline towers. This had spread Eli’s fame quite a bit.

When Eli heard this, he wanted to stop her, but after thinking about it, it didn’t seem like there was anything wrong, so he ignored it.

After all, the only threat to Eli on the West Coast was the celestial from the hourglass of time.
