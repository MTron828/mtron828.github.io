137 Leaving the Camp

In the dark room.

Eli sat on the chair while Tijie stood on the ground in her red chiffon dress.

“I’m a zero circle mage apprentice. I was sent here to collect as much information as possible, including where there are high-value items, the group of warlocks, how many high-level warlocks there are, and so on. We might organize a surprise attack later.” Tijie explained the matter in a concise manner.

Eli was speechless. He was told that mages were dying out. How did they even dare to attack the Warlock’s camp?

“Is the mage camp you belong to very strong?” Eli asked curiously.

“We have about three official mages and about 20 apprentices,” Tijie replied.

“You’re going to attack the Warlock’s camp just like that?” Eli looked as if he had seen a ghost. Putting everything else aside, there were at least several two-circle warlocks in the Warlock camp, and there were at least ten people in the first circle. As for apprentices, there were about a hundred of them.

“With such a huge difference in strength, you’re telling me you want to attack the camp?”

“Er, we’re not attacking. Our goal is to destroy and plunder some resources,” Tijie replied.

Destroying and plundering resources?

That would indeed be easier, but it shouldn’t be enough.

As if reading Eli’s mind, Tijie added, ” we are not the main force. We are only responsible for destroying and pillaging the camp. The main force is another force.”

“Oh!”

This makes sense!

“Then who is the main force?”

“I don’t know about that. I only know that it seems to be another Warlock’s force.” Tijie took out a bottle of her magic potion and consumed it. Her wounds healed bit by bit.

Eli nodded.

This was really bad. Initially, he thought that he had only discovered a spy, but he did not expect to suddenly find out about such a conspiracy. Eli was a little caught off guard.

“So, should I report this to the camp, or should I just pretend that nothing happened?” Eli frowned.

If he reported it now, he would be able to ensure that he would be able to eliminate the danger he was in. However, how to explain it was another problem. Even if he reported it secretly, there was a risk of being discovered.

Therefore, reporting it might not be a good idea, so he could only hide it.

He would hide everything he knew and leave the place temporarily. He would return after everything was over. It just so happened that Eli could use the excuse of a breakthrough to leave the camp temporarily and return after everything was over.

After figuring this out, Eli relaxed a lot and continued asking, “When do you guys plan to start the invasion?”

“I don’t know. We’ve only just begun to infiltrate and search. We’re only just starting preparations. We’re controlled by the main force. Whenever they say they’ll take action, we’ll take action. It may be half a month, or it may be a year or two years later. It all depends on when they want it. I don’t think it’ll be more than two years.” Tijie thought for a while and answered seriously.

“Yes, yes.” Eli understood. ‘I need to leave tomorrow. The camp is getting dangerous.’

When everything was settled, Eli would return. After all, there was a high chance that the camp would still exist, and he might even be valued because of the loss of personnel.

Three birds with one stone.

And how to leave, Eli had an idea too.

However, before that, he had to solve his problem with Tijie.

Looking at the young apprentice, Eli gave her a kind smile and asked, “Do you want to live or die!”

There was silence.

…

The next day.

Eli came to the hall early in the morning.

“Deputy Minister Herman, what brings you here today? ” Alice said with a smile. Unlike the mortal world, beauty potions in the Warlock world were actually quite common and easy to make, so most of the time, you would only see one face over the decades.

“I’ve been preparing to make a breakthrough recently, but I’m still lacking material and money. So, I’m preparing to take on a mission to earn some money,” Eli replied.

Eli was planning to take on a mission and leave this place.

“Do you lack money too, Sir Herman? but I heard that you’re quite carefree in the camp!” Alice joked with a smile.

“It’s because I’m too free and easy that I don’t have money,” Eli replied with a smile.

Alice couldn’t say anything, so she took out a photostone.

A clear image was projected. It was a list of missions.

“Do you have any requirements for the mission?” Alice asked.

“Well, it’s best if the pay is high and it takes me further away from the camp,” Eli stated his condition.

“I see!” Alice nodded and quickly selected a mission. “Master Herman, what do you think of this? You can stay in the palace of the kingdom of Corina for five years and maintain the peace of the kingdom during this period. The reward is 200 low-grade magic stones, but since you are a late-stage apprentice, you should be able to get an additional 50 magic stones.” Alice said as she looked at a mission and introduced it to Eli.

Five years?

Eli was a little hesitant. Five years was a little too long!

After all, this invasion would probably end in three years at most.

However, this was indeed a very suitable mission for him.

“Sir, if you are worried about safety, there is no need. There is still a first-circle warlock in the kingdom. You don’t need to do much,” Alice explained.

“Alright, I’ll take this one then!” Eli nodded.

Soon, Alice handed the mission to Eli.

After taking the mission, Eli went to look for Evena.

“Minister, I’ve accepted a mission. I might need some time away.”

Evena nodded to show she understood.

Accepting missions was an individual’s choice, and the ministers had no right to interfere.

Besides, it was just a mission, and it was probably a short one. He would be back soon.

She had never thought that Eli would take on a long-term mission.

…

Just like this.

It was early in the morning when Eli knew that the camp might be in danger for some time. In the same afternoon, Eli was already packing his things and preparing to leave.

Outside Tijie’s door, Tijie looked at Eli.

He was one of her targets. He had actually left just like that. What a waste of her efforts.

Sighing, she returned to her room and sent a new message to a certain Soul brand. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Master, the Vice-Minister of the camp’s potions Department, Herman, is preparing to leave the camp. He seems to be out on a long-term mission. Everything is normal. We don’t know when he will return!”

Meanwhile, on the other side, Eli received the message and smiled playfully.

‘It feels so different to hear about me from someone else.’

Last night, in order to get the specific information and the location of the future wizard camp, Eli had also planted a soul brand in Tijie and made her his subordinate.

However, she thought that her master was Roland. She had no idea that Roland was Eli.

After making sure that everything was ready, Eli said to his newly hired Grand Knight coachman. “Let’s go.”

Just like that, the carriage quickly left the warlock camp and set off all the way to the kingdom of Corina.

…

Three days later.

Eli had arrived at the capital of the kingdom of Corina, the city of Corina.

Eli also made his way to the palace.

In the palace, Eli met the Queen directly.

“Greetings, Your Majesty.” Eli greeted respectfully.

“There’s no need to be so formal.” The Queen smiled.

She was about 50 years old and had an elegant appearance. She wore a red dress and luxurious jewelry. From her aura, she was actually an apprentice, or perhaps she was an apprentice in the past.

It was different from the situation in Bryne where there were no traces of the mages. Because Corina was closer to the former mage forces, there were still families of mages here. Of course, most mage families were now families of warlocks. The royal family of Corina was once a mage family, and Rock was the queen’s son.

“Just tell me what I need to do, my queen,” Eli asked directly, not wanting to waste any time.

“Your mission is to protect Ross, Rock’s son.” The Queen thought for a moment and said.

Eli, “…”

Rock actually had a son?

Seeing Eli’s expression, the Queen also asked in confusion, “Do you know rock?”

“Rock and I used to be friends,” Eli said without denying it.

“Well, that’s even better. Rock’s son is called Ross. He’s about six years old, and he might have inherited Rock’s talent. He’s also very talented, but he’s still young. He’s currently studying with the royal family. All you have to do is to protect him for the next five years. After that, he’ll be sent to a mage Academy.” The Queen nodded and said.

“Alright,” Eli nodded.

Although he had some doubts, he didn’t intend to ask. Anyway, some things would slowly come to light.

“Yes, someone will take you to see him later. I’ll take my leave first.”

Ten minutes after the Queen left, someone came over and brought Eli to a small castle in the palace. There, he saw Rock’s son, a little one who was always full of pride.

“Are you the one sent to protect me?” Ross’s face was chubby like a baby’s, and he looked up at Eli.

“yes, I’ll protect your safety from now on.” Eli nodded.

“Yes.”

The little boy was still very sensible. He chatted a little with Eli in a silly manner and then went to play the game of Knight and Prince. Eli smiled and was led to a room in the castle.

“My Lord, this is your room.” A servant opened a room.

Eli walked in and saw that it was a very luxurious room. After all, he was still a ‘Level 3 acolyte’, so it was impossible for the reception to be too bad. He was a protector, not a nanny.

“If Milord needs anything, you can tell us at any time.”

“Alright,” he said.

After chasing away the maidservant, Eli entered the room and inspected the entire room from top to bottom. He then set up a few spell formations before he started to heave a sigh of relief.

He had finally left the camp.

Although he didn’t know when the camp would be attacked, he decided to stay away for now.

It would be best if the camp still existed after that. However, if the camp were wiped out, Eli wouldn’t cry over it. He’d just start over somewhere else.
