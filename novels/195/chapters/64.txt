65 The Dumbfounded Marquis Alina

Queen Cynthia had long forgotten when she had cried the last time!

On the day of her father’s death, she cried.

After that, no matter if it was the harassment from powerful countries or the political disputes of the Empire, she never cried. It was not that she did not want to cry, but she knew that she could not cry!

How could the Queen of the kingdom shed tears?

However, when she put on the perfume and smelled it, she was sure that the perfume was ordinary and couldn’t even enter her collection. However, it made her feel like she had seen her father.

When she was young, her father always liked to hold her in his arms and tell her about the kingdom. She would also pull her father’s beard, and the two of them would laugh together.

That was her happiest time.

“Venus? What a nice perfume!” More than ten seconds later, Queen Cynthia wiped away her tears and clenched the perfume in her hand.

This perfume seemed to let her see what she wanted to see the most. It was a feeling that she had never felt before in other perfumes. How should she put it? It was wonderful, but she really liked it.

“It’s a really good perfume.” Queen Cynthia was very happy. She hadn’t been this happy in a long time.

She tidied up and called for the guard to get Aria.

Aria and Victor were in the room next door, waiting.

“Aria, you can’t win against me. The Chamber of Commerce should have been mine. If you are willing to come back, I will welcome you.” victor said as kindly as ever.

“Stop talking nonsense now. Don’t you feel disgusted?” Aria just glanced at him and ignored him.

He was anxious, not knowing what had happened.

Could it be that the perfume was too strong?

Suddenly, the sound of the door opening was heard.

A guard walked in, and both Aria and Victor stood up immediately.

The guard glanced at the two of them and said, “Aria Kazan, the queen wants to see you. as for victor Kazan, you can leave. ”

Victor felt as if he was struck by lightning. He looked at Aria, who was not far away, with a face of disbelief.

How was that possible?

A smile finally appeared on Aria’s face. He immediately followed the guard.

But when he saw the Queen again, the first thing the Queen said was, “I don’t think the name Venus is good. Let’s call it Starlight, the only ray of light among the stars in the sky.”

Aria was stunned for a moment, then he smiled.

“From today onwards, this perfume will be called Starlight.”

He got it.

...

Victor walked away in a daze.

Aria left smugly.

Queen Cynthia returned to the main hall and sat on her throne. She held the bottle of perfume in her hand.

Queen Cynthia had long since gotten used to the cold throne. She once again sprayed a little bit of perfume and sniffed. In an instant, a strange attraction spread over her body.

She didn’t cry. Last time, she had only cried because she had suppressed her tears for too long. After venting her emotions, she was still the majestic queen of the empire.

At this moment, someone else walked into the hall.

“My queen, marquis Alina of the Bryne empire requests to meet you again!” This was a woman who also exuded the aura of a Grand Knight. However, she was a little confused at this time. Looking at the Queen, she felt that the Queen was particularly attractive today, which made her want to tease her.

“Yes. Let him come!” Queen Cynthia nodded. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“But didn’t you say that you won’t see them last time, my queen?” The woman was puzzled. She had grown up with the Queen and had the closest relationship with her. Now, there were only two of them, which was why she asked this question.

Queen Cynthia glanced at her and said, ” the Bryne empire is stronger than the Lorraine kingdom, but the Lorraine kingdom is richer than the bryne empire. This is not a good thing.

“So I needed to give them a warning and wait for the right time to talk about the conditions. Otherwise, they will only think that we are weak.”

“Didn’t your majesty tell me yesterday that we won’t do that so soon? Why are we doing it today?” The woman asked curiously.

“It’s nothing. I’m just in a good mood.” Queen Cynthia glanced at her and didn’t say anything.

“Let’s go. Let’s go meet the Marquis of Bryne.” Queen Cynthia said calmly as she walked down from her throne.

It was originally planned, but she was in a good mood today, so she decided to bring this process forward.

As for a reason, it was probably because of that small bottle of perfume.

...

At the same time, in a conference room, Marquis Alina sat in the front, his expression calm.

Behind him were the others, most of them looking nervous. If they were nervous for a while, they might be rejected without hesitation.

“I hope this time will go smoothly.” marquis Alina calmly looked ahead, deep in thought.

In fact, Queen Cynthia’s repeated rejections had already caused his original confidence to waver. He wondered if he should lower the conditions a little.

This Queen was much more difficult to deal with than he had imagined.

Just as they were thinking, the door suddenly opened.

Queen Cynthia walked in front with the group of people following behind.

The Queen’s eyes narrowed slightly, and a sense of majesty emanated from her. This Queen, who had ruled the kingdom for nearly 20 years, had long let the other countries know that she was not to be trifled with.

Everyone took their seats.

Marquis Alina took a deep breath and prepared to speak.

“I agree to the alliance. Let’s talk about the conditions.” However, before Marquis Alina could speak, Queen Cynthia spoke.

“Huh?”

Marquis Alina choked on his breath and almost couldn’t breathe.

His mind was filled with questions. What had happened?

Why did the Queen change so much?

...

The next day, in the morning, eli had received news that Aria had received the queen’s support and had already returned to the chamber of commerce, preparing to eliminate victor. This was normal, and in this way, Eli felt that his efforts were not in vain.

A small amount of investment was about to turn into a huge amount of wealth, which would give Eli the possibility of obtaining wealth and freedom in the future.

But the news he received in the afternoon surprised him.

The Alliance had actually succeeded.

This made Eli look at Marquis Alina in a new light. He didn’t expect him to turn the situation around so quickly.

But what he did not know was that Marquis Alina was even more confused than he was. He just wanted to know why!

However, success was only the beginning. What followed would be the negotiations for the exchange of interests. That would be the time for the real confrontation. Marquis Alina would not give up on the interests of the Empire, and Queen Cynthia would definitely show her skills.

This would probably take some time.

At this time, the doctors, scholars, and the other people that they had brought with them could finally play their roles. They were assigned to various departments in the Lorraine Kingdom to learn and communicate.

Eli and Clement were assigned to a small team of scholars.

They would work together on a project that people were not optimistic about.
