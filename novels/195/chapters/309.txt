310 Celestial

Eli took a deep breath and released his mental power like a wave. Layers of ripples gradually appeared in the surrounding air, and a terrifying suppressive force rippled out.

At the same time, the hexagram spell formation beneath him began to light up from the core, and it quickly spread out towards the outside, blooming with a dazzling light, directly enveloping Eli within.

Meanwhile, Eli had his eyes closed as he felt his body.

In the sea of consciousness.

!!

The ocean-like mental energy began to go berserk. Like ocean waves, it slapped Eli’s mental energy layer by layer. During this process, Eli’s mental energy was also solidifying bit by bit.

The tidal sea meditation technique.

The mid-grade meditation technique that Eli had obtained from Bryne’s Secret realm was much more effective than ordinary meditation techniques. Even though he had found many meditation techniques over the years, none of them were as good as this.

And at this time, it also played its role.

His mental energy was like waves, wave after wave, constantly compressing Eli’s spiritual energy. The power of the spell formation, on the other hand, was assisting Eli in better controlling his mental energy.

Eli’s will was firm.

There was no return. He could only advance.

“It’s not enough, it’s not enough!”

The mental power in his body was being compressed slowly. The pressure was not enough, so Eli immediately made a decision.

In the next second, the mental energy waves instantly grew larger. Boom boom boom, it was as if there really was a wave blowing up in Eli’s mental energy ocean. This process also accelerated infinitely.

The sea of mental energy gradually turned into a large river and then from a large river to a Lake!

However, when it reached a certain limit, it could no longer shrink.

At this moment, in the outside world, the huge spell formation that covered a kilometer around Eli was instantly activated. The light from the activation even illuminated a radius of several dozen kilometers, as if a huge sun had fallen onto the ground.

At the same time, the spell formation attracted the elements, and the elements from dozens of kilometers away were gradually gathering towards Eli. In the sky, countless elements seemed to have taken on a physical form, blocking the sun as if the end of the world had arrived.

The great sun is below, and the Apocalypse is above!

As the spell formation was activated, Eli’s mental strength continued to be compressed.

At this moment, countless people witnessed this scene.

Although this place was very remote, the commotion and the scope were still too big.

Those who were closer looked at the sky-covering scene in the distance with horror on their faces!

“What’s that? An apocalyptic catastrophe? ”

“Oh my God!”

When ordinary people saw this scene, some immediately knelt on the ground, and some ran back home to hide. This terrifying scene really made many people feel afraid, but there were also some warlocks who gathered there. They felt that there was something precious in this.

“as expected of Your Excellency. The commotion every time you break through is not small!”

Nikola looked at the strange phenomenon and sighed.

He’d seen a celestial breakthrough before, but not as terrifying as this one. However, it made sense when he thought about how fearsome his Lordship’s previous breakthrough was.

He could imagine how Eli would be. After Eli was done, perhaps a few leftovers would be enough for Nikola to use to preserve his soul.

At this moment, he could sense that warlocks had begun to gather in this direction from a distance. There was even a Warlock who was only a few kilometers away and was craning his neck to look in this direction.

Nikola’s eyes turned cold, and the spirit behind him roared and rushed over.

How could he let this group of trash interfere with his master’s breakthrough?

However, a figure was even faster and had already flown out from his side. It was Hydra.

“Hahaha!” Nikola laughed.

The undead exploded, and the Warlock who had just arrived looked at this scene in fear. He wanted to turn and run, but how could he run? a snake head had already arrived and swallowed him.

Then, the Hydra raised its head and waved its nearly 100-meter-long body. It looked around, and its three pairs of eyes were filled with killing intent. Its master had told it not to let anyone near it.

..

On the other side.

Eli’s mental energy was still constantly compressing, and in just an hour, the spiritual Lake in Eli’s mental energy had disappeared, leaving only a basketball-sized collective of mental energy, but it seemed to have stopped shrinking.

He had reached his limit again.

But Eli didn’t panic, it was all within his expectations.

The next second.

Beside him, over a million spirit crystals began to burn. Pale-white flames flew towards him, surging into his body and burning his mental energy. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

It looked as if the water of the ocean had been poured into a bottle. The water was the burning mental power, while Eli was a bottle.

With the help of the soul flames, Eli instantly felt his mental strength begin to compress and gather. The impurities within his mental strength were also rapidly burned away, making it even purer.

However, even after consuming millions of soul crystals, he only managed to shrink it to the size of a soccer ball. At this moment, the fourth circle soul crystal in front of Eli also exploded, and an even more powerful flame burst out.

At this moment, Eli’s mental power was burning rapidly again.

In the blink of an eye, his mental power was reduced to the size of a ping-pong ball.

Sensing this situation, Eli didn’t relax, knowing that what came next would be more difficult.

It was the extreme compression of mental energy to achieve the celestial realm!

“Come on.” Eli took a deep breath, and silver light bloomed in his eyes.

In his consciousness, his mental power was quickly shrinking. It was getting smaller and smaller. An unknown power was also gradually brewing. It was a power that was higher than mental power.
