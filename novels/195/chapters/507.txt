508 Miya in Danger

” You’re too arrogant, Eli!”

Dani was very angry at this time, not only because of Azak’s deception but also because of this shameless guy in front of him.

Even if you just advanced to the fifth circle, where did you get the courage to provoke me?

He decided to teach Eli a lesson!

A layer of gray fog surged out of his body and covered his body like a cloak. A dense death aura wrapped around his body, and everything around him was rapidly corroding. All the life force in the surroundings was rapidly disappearing.

In the blink of an eye, the land within a few hundred meters of him had turned into a purgatory.

“Damn it!” The corner of Eli’s mouth twitched. This was his territory!

“We’ll go out and fight!” Eli shouted and flew towards the mountain range behind the valley.

Dani took a look and followed, leaving everyone looking at each other.

” Wait a minute. Your Excellency is at the fifth circle?” At this moment, Nikolas, who was lying on the ground, asked Dylan, doubting his life.

“Maybe?” Dylan’s mouth twitched.

They were so close that they did not know when Eli had broken through to the fifth ring.

On the other hand, Hydra, whose body was more than half broken, revealed a joyful expression.

“Silly snake!”

Nikola cursed angrily and quickly got up to save Hydra.

..

On the other side.

The two of them flew tens of thousands of meters behind the mountain range.

Soon, Eli stopped. A gray figure slowly appeared not far away, revealing Dani’s figure. At this moment, there was a blood-red dagger in his hand!

“Someone told me that you’re a half-step fifth circle warlock. It seems that you’re the one who advanced some time ago. It’s only been ten years since then. This time isn’t even enough for the newly-advanced fifth circle warlock to stabilize the rules.” Dani looked at Eli calmly.

“Come and try!” Eli smiled.

“Alright, then I’ll kill you.” Dani’s eyes narrowed slightly, but his figure gradually disappeared into the void, disappearing from Eli’s vision.

As an assassin, this was a method he was used to.

Dani merged into the void as if he had completely disappeared from this land.

However, the faint killing intent told Eli that he was right beside him, ready to launch a fatal blow at any time. Therefore, Eli did not hesitate and activated the five-ringed silver eyes.

Since advancing, Silver Eye had become stronger.

This was a powerful skill that was taboo even in the mage world. It allowed Eli to easily see Dani’s figure. At this moment, Dani was a few hundred meters in front of him and was slowly approaching.

Eli watched him approach as if he did not sense it.

Although Dani noticed the change in Eli’s eyes, he didn’t feel that he had been discovered. He continued to slowly approach Eli, and in the blink of an eye, he was a hundred meters away.

He had already entered the attack range.

“Go to hell!”

In the next moment, he exploded.

The Law of Death condensed on the dagger at this moment. A hundred meters in an instant, Dani launched his first fatal attack on Eli.

Under the powerful rules, an obvious gap even appeared in space.

However, it was as if Eli had already sensed it. He retreated backward and dodged the attack.

“What?!” Surprise flashed in Dani’s eyes.

As he watched Eli brush his shoulders, the attack in his hand slipped gently. The small dagger attack instantly slid to the ground.

Bang!

An ear-splitting sound rang out as a terrifying scar that was thousands of meters long instantly appeared in the mountains. The depth of the scar was also dozens of meters. Several mountains were directly split into two, and the crack emitted a dense aura of death. Everything within a thousand meters of the crack quickly died.

The entire mountain range was in an uproar. Countless creatures ran into the distance. It was extremely spectacular, but most of them were stained with the aura of death. As they ran, their flesh fell off and turned into ghastly white bones!

There was no difference whether it was a zero-circle or a fourth-circle creature.

Under this attack, the entire mountain range within a thousand meters turned into a hell of death.

This was a fifth-circle attack. Although it looked ordinary, the power contained in it was not vague at all.

After missing his target, Dani prepared to escape.

But how could Eli let him have his way? He waved his hand.

Boundless shadows appeared and covered Dani, emitting a devouring power. In an instant, a huge suction force was released and pulled him out of the void.

After that, the shadow directly wrapped around him.

“How is that possible?”

Dani was shocked when he felt the restraints around him.

How could a newly-advanced fifth-circle warlock pull him out of hiding? This was his best skill, which had once allowed him to survive in front of a divine tree warlock.

He had to break free!

The gray fog dissipated once again. He wanted to corrode the shadows, but he was shocked to find that the gray fog was actually swallowed by the surrounding shadows without causing any ripples.

This was because he had been completely crushed at the level of laws!

“How can a newly advanced Germinal Warlock crush me in terms of laws?” Dani was panicking. He looked at Eli in the distance with fear in his eyes. He was no longer as calm as before.

“I never said I was a Germinal Warlock!”

At this moment, Eli slowly approached Dani, and a shadow condensed in his hand.

“Not a Germinal Warlock?” Dani was stunned, and then a trace of shock flashed in his eyes. He felt that the shadows around him had indeed surpassed this level.

“You’re actually at the Divine Tree Stage!” Dani’s eyes were so wide that he could not believe it, and even more so, he directly begged for mercy, “Sir, spare my life, spare my life. I’m just doing my job for money!”

“I prefer it when you were unruly.” Eli glanced at him, and the shadow in his hand condensed and flew toward Dani.

Bang!

The shadow instantly exploded a few meters away from Dani, turning into a resplendent shadow. Then, a devouring power erupted, absorbing everything in the surroundings. Dani directly melted into the void.

For a few seconds, it was as if the void was about to be absorbed. After that, the shadow gradually dissipated as if nothing had happened, except for Dani, who had disappeared and died.

” About one-tenth of my power is enough to kill a Germinal Warlock. I don’t even need to fight with our lives on the line!”

After the battle, Eli finally had a rough estimate of the Germinal Warlock’s strength.

After thousands of years of silent development, the result was good.

This also made Eli approve of his previous decision. If it were not for the arduous meditation, if he was still in the germinal stage, then he would be in big trouble.

If he were still in that stage, he would inevitably suffer some injuries or even die. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“I’ve avoided another life-and-death crisis!” Eli sighed and then began to search Dani, who was kept in the shadows. Soon, he saw that in the shadows, Azak gave Dani a copy of Miya’s location and asked him to help kill Eli.

“Azak!”

Eli narrowed his eyes. It was this guy again.

The Hamis family was really persistent!

But were they crazy? At this moment? Why did they attack him? Eli couldn’t understand.

“But let’s talk about this later. If I remember correctly, if I remember correctly, Miya should be Udo’s daughter.” Eli recalled the West Coast. That was more than a thousand years ago.

He seemed to have promised Udo that he would help his daughter if they met in the future.

” Let’s do that. I’m a person who keeps her promise. She should be surrounded by four Half-Step fifth-circle warlocks now. I have to go now. Otherwise, she’ll die.”

Eli searched for the general direction, then turned into a blood-red light and flew away. His speed was dozens of times faster than a fourth-circle warlock, like a blood-red thread.

Half an hour after Eli left.

An Earthen Demon Bear walked out of a mountain range not far away, its body trembling. Its body, which had shrunk to a few meters, kept trembling. When it saw the thousand-meter-long death rift in the distance, it felt even more terrified.

Even though he was a half-step fifth circle Demonic Earth Bear, he could clearly understand that if that attack landed on his head, he would definitely have no chance of survival. There was not even a one in a hundred thousand chance.

“Moreover, the person who just got off…” He recalled that figure and immediately cried, “Damn it, last time I ran into the depths of the mountain range to hide from him. This time, I actually met him again.

“However, I can’t stay here anymore!” He grumbled, but his body was heading west. He wanted to go to the central region. He didn’t want to stay in the western region for another day.

Bullying a bear!
