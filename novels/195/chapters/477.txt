478 The Reaction of All Sides, First Round of War

The large-scale mobilization of troops naturally could not be hidden from the other factions.

Soon, the other forces also noticed the changes in the Bloodline Tower. Although they didn’t know what they were going to do, they all became nervous.

The eastern part of the Western Regions!

Many forces gathered together to discuss this matter!

Most of the forces in this area had joined the Heart of the Abyss. The Bloodline Tower had suffered a lot, so everyone was nervous.

At this moment, an old man in a black warlock robe stood up and looked at everyone calmly.

“Everyone, I’m very happy that everyone can come. We’ve gathered here for only one purpose, which is to deal with the changes in the Bloodline Tower.”

Hearing the old man’s words, the others raised their heads and spoke one by one.

“The Bloodline Tower has done a good job of keeping this a secret. No information has been leaked, but whether it’s the Warlocks that have gathered or the large number of resources that have been mobilized, it’s clear that the Bloodline Tower is going to make a big move this time.” a Warlock said.

“Aren’t you talking nonsense?” The Warlock beside him glanced at him and said, “I found that most of the leaders of the forces under the Bloodline Tower secretly went to the Bloodline Tower and stayed there for a long time.

“With so many Warlocks gathered, and considering the current situation, if a war were to break out, they would either attack the Heart of the Abyss or the Green Field further north.

” It’s unlikely to be the Green Field where many foreign races gather. There are many powerful creatures there, and the benefits are too low. Therefore, I think the Bloodline Tower is going to make a move on the Heart of the Abyss!”

As soon as the Warlock finished speaking, a commotion broke out in the meeting.

At this moment, the old man at the front spoke again.

He shook his head and denied it. ” I don’t think so. The power of the Heart of the Abyss far surpasses that of the Bloodline Tower. Moreover, based on Eli’s previous performance, he didn’t dare to confront the Heart of the Abyss directly. I’m afraid he doesn’t have the guts to do such a thing. ”

“Indeed!”

” That’s true. Eli is just so-so. He hasn’t done anything for the past few decades. I think his previous fame was all made up.”

Many young warlocks nodded in agreement. They had never seen Eli in battle. Coupled with his performance over the years, they naturally thought that Eli was just like many famous warlocks who were exaggerated.

“But … Although the Bloodline Tower won’t attack the Heart of the Abyss, they might attack the east. Therefore, when you return to your forces, prepare your defenses just in case.” Seeing everyone’s reaction, the old man smiled and continued.

“Of course!”

The group of people smiled, but they were no longer as nervous as before.

After a series of analysis, no one believed that the Bloodline Tower would attack them. After all, the Heart of the Abyss wasn’t to be trifled with.

Did Eli have the guts to do that?

The City of Dawn!

“What is it? The Bloodline Tower has the guts to do that?”

Nero frowned as he looked at the Warlock, who was also the head of the intelligence department.

“Yes, sir. It started a week ago. We predicted that there was a 30% chance that they would target us!” The Warlock said respectfully.

“30%?”

Hearing this number, Nero raised his eyebrows.

However, a few seconds later, a cold smile appeared on his face. “The probability is not small, but the Bloodline Tower? Hehe, I don’t believe it. I actually hope that he will make a move on us. This way, my plan might be able to be completed in one step. At the very least, I won’t have to worry about being discovered when the blood sacrifice happens.

“However…” As he spoke, Nero suddenly changed the topic. “But if it’s this person, it’s not impossible. That person looks timid, but from the confrontation over the years, he’s not a simple person. He’s definitely an old fox!”

Many rumors were spread about Eli. It was fine if others believed it, but Nero would not take it seriously. At the very least, the forces that had underestimated Eli had long since been annihilated.

“Pass down my order. The peripheral factions of the Heart of the Abyss are to be prepared. If he doesn’t come, it’s fine. If he comes, don’t blame me.” Nero ordered.

What a joke. Did Eli think he could win Nero by himself?

..

After the eastern faction meeting and Nero’s decision, almost all the factions moved. A large number of Warlocks were moved to the border, and many factions even activated war warnings.

For a time, the Western Regions was like a powder keg, just missing a fuse.

“Milord, everything is ready. We are on standby.”

In the Bloodline Tower, Alida was dressed in a silver Warlock robe. She lowered her head and spoke to Eli.

“Very good. Have you discussed the area for the first round of attack?” Eli nodded and asked.

“Sir, everything is ready.” Alida took out a map that was roughly divided into three parts. One part was the north and the west, the other part was the subordinates of the Heart of the Abyss in the east, and the last part was the Heart of the Abyss in the south.

At this moment, red circles had been drawn on the edges and inside of the two regions. They were the key locations of the two factions.

“Hmm, not bad.” Eli nodded. Alida was very attentive.

“Then let’s do it in three days. Three days later, the entire army will attack and occupy these regions according to the battle strategy. At the same time, we will declare war on the Heart of the Abyss.” Eli said.

“Yes, sir.” Alida nodded, but her expression was a little hesitant. “Sir, are we really going to declare war on the Heart of the Abyss? There has to be a reason, right?”

“The reason is that the Heart of the Abyss is encroaching on our forces and has evil intentions towards the Bloodline Tower.” Eli interrupted Alida and said directly.

“Good!”

The corner of Alida’s mouth twitched as she nodded.

Although this reason was hasty, it was not wrong. However, she felt that there was definitely a deeper reason behind this. Otherwise, it would be impossible to start a war like this.

His Excellency definitely had his own considerations. I just need to do my own thing.

Alida shook her head and said as she retreated, “Alright, then I’ll go and make the arrangements first!”

Watching Alida leave, Eli returned to the Wizard Tower.

He should continue to adapt to the Blood Celestial Body. There was no need for him to make a move in the short term!

Three days later.

Under the night sky.

In the sky, hundreds of airships slowly left the Bloodline Tower area and headed toward several forces. At the same time, hundreds of thousands of Warlocks finally knew the Bloodline Tower’s purpose.

Kill the Heart of Abyss!
