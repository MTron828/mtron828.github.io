360 Scout

In the sky, the giant eagle was extremely fast. After half a day, Lobelia arrived at a city.

Arriving at the local Charm Mansion, she passed through the reception hall and the colorful corridor before entering a dark room. There was only a very old woman in the room, and behind her and on both sides were a large number of letters and documents.

Seeing that it was Lobelia, the woman immediately stood up. “Greetings, my lord!”

“When did the three airships pass through here?” Lobelia asked.

“Five hours ago. If you want to catch up with them, ” the woman added, “you’d better change to another means of transportation. Their airship is very fast. ”

Lobelia understood what the woman meant.

Her giant eagle couldn’t catch up with the airship.

” A third-circle giant eagle can’t catch up with an airship. Are the alchemy products of mages that powerful? ” The corners of her mouth twitched, and her plump chest heaved up and down again.

However, this third-circle eagle was already the fastest-moving tool she could find.

” Looks like I can only wait for the landing. I hope I can make it in time. ” Lobelia turned around and left the room.

After Lobelia left, the woman sat down again.

The side door opened, and a large number of envelopes were put in again. The woman casually took one.

She opened it.

” The negotiations between the Manticore Family and the Amina Family have ended. They have obtained the development rights of the Grassi Land. The internal meeting will begin in ten days. ”

Looking at the message, the woman’s expression clearly froze.

” Lady Lobelia should be interested. Unfortunately, she left too early. However, she should know about this when she reaches the next city. ”

The woman put the letter away and closed the door not far away.

…

In the blink of an eye, eight days had passed.

The manticore family finally realized that Wellington was missing.

In a tall wizard tower.

The current head of the manticore family, Jerre, sat in the middle, with the celestials of the manticore family sitting on both sides.

At this moment, he frowned and asked everyone, “Still no news from Wellington?”

Everyone was silent for a few seconds. After a few seconds, a celestial said, “Sir, from Wellington’s men, we know that he disappeared half a month ago. It is said that he went to see the celestials of the Lilias Warlock Family, the Harma Warlock Academy, and the Mercury Family.

“The celestials of Lilias Warlock Family and Harma Warlock Academy didn’t leave any Bloodline Soul Lamps in their families, but the celestial of the Mercury Family did. His Soul Lamp was extinguished nine days ago. At that time, we were negotiating with the Amina Family, so we didn’t notice.”

“Is that so? Does anyone know where he went?” Jerre frowned.

” They disappeared after they left. It seems like Wellington deliberately concealed its tracks and information. Otherwise, we wouldn’t have found out so late. ” The Warlock complained.

Jerre fell silent.

Concealing his tracks and disappearing?

What was he up to?

” Sir, could it be that he discovered some good ruins and went to explore them? Wellington also disappeared for a month to do this in the past. ” At this moment, a Warlock suddenly said.

“Indeed, this kind of thing has happened before.” A Warlock nodded in agreement.

Hearing them speak at the same time, Jerre also wondered if that was the case. After all, if one of them died in the secret realm, it could explain the disappearance.

As for the bloodline tower branch being involved, they didn’t even think about it. During this period of time, they dealt with many branches, but most of them were very weak. Except for a few branches, they were not too concerned, so Wellington’s disappearance was probably due to other reasons.

Jerre thought for a full five minutes before he slowly said, “Wellington is a Nebula Warlock, so it shouldn’t be a problem. Let’s ignore him for now and talk about the Bloodline Tower.

“Some time ago, the Bloodline Tower’s main camp was doing an apprentice trial, and a valley near the main tower was accidentally opened. It was called the Grassi Land, and the wood elements were extremely abundant there. There were also a large number of high-level magic plants from the mage era, and the benefits were not small.

” After negotiating with the Amina Family and exchanging benefits, we will hand over the territory of the Mercury Family to the Amina Family, and then we’ll take over the territory of the Bloodline tower. Of course, we have to do it ourselves, but the Amina Family will not interfere.

“What do you think?”

Jerre finished his narration in one breath.

” Sir, I have a question. ” Suddenly, a Warlock looked at Jerre, and Jerre looked back.

The Warlock straightened his throat and said, “Sir, the House of Mercury is also an important territory for us, and the resources it produces are of great use to us. Are we giving up too much?”

Hearing this question, Jerre frowned and shook his head, “No, I’ve thought about it carefully. ” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

After saying this, he stopped talking.

The Warlock vaguely felt that something was wrong, but he did not ask further.

No one else asked any more questions. Jerre said,” In that case, two days later, Radiant Moon Warlock Jalin, Minor Star Warlock Arona, and Cluster Star Warlock Vya will lead the Warlocks to the main Bloodline Tower. ”

He turned to look at the woman beside him and said, “Jalin, I’ll leave it to you.”

“Alright.” The woman nodded.

Actually, sending a few Star warlocks would have been enough. She was probably sent because Jerre was afraid of accidents.

“Alright, that’s all for now. Meeting dismissed.” Jerre stood up.

Everyone stood up and left.

….

In the blue sky.

The three airships flew at a speed faster than the average third-circle creatures, leaving three trails in the air.

In the airship at the front, Eli, Alida, and Oscar were talking.

...

” Sir Eli, we should be arriving at the Bloodline Tower in two days. We’re already in the Bloodline Tower’s area. ” Oscar said to Ely as he held the map.

“Yes.” Eli glanced at the map. They were indeed very close.

“But you didn’t look for me for this matter, right?” asked Eli, who had suddenly been visited by Oscar and Alida a few minutes ago.

“Sir, I just thought of something. I think it’s necessary to implement it.” Oscar said.

“Oh? What is it?” asked Eli.

” Sir, we are getting closer and closer to the Bloodline Tower, but we know nothing about the situation in the main tower. I think we should send someone to scout first. It’s inevitable that there will be problems. ” Oscar suggested.

Scouting?

Eli rubbed his chin. Although he was not afraid of the manticore, he couldn’t lose the necessary caution.

“Then have you decided who to go?” Eli asked.

“Milord, let me go.” At this moment, Alida said, “I’m a member of the main tower, so it’ll be easier for me to communicate with them when I return. Besides, I’m more familiar with the terrain.”

“Sure.” Eli nodded.

...

“Have you thought about how to go there?” Eli turned to look at Alida. She had come to the West Coast on a flying magic beast, but they did not bring the beast with them.

“Ah, this.” Alida was obviously stunned for a moment. She did not expect Eli to ask such a question.

“Hehe, let Hydra accompany you. He is very fast and is skilled in the power of shadows. He is very stealthy and is powerful enough to protect you.” Eli stretched out his hand, and a small snake slowly crawled out of his sleeve and climbed directly onto Alida’s shoulder.

” Alright, thank you, sir. ” Alida felt the weight on her shoulders and took a deep breath.

During this period of time, she also learned that the third celestial from the Bloodline Tower was this little snake, Elo’s pet.

“Then I will take my leave, Milord.”

“Yes.”

Just like that, Alida left the room with Hydra, and Oscar also left.

An hour later.

A giant snake left the airship and flew into the distance. Its speed was even faster than the airship.

Meanwhile, Alida was directing the direction, riding Hydra.
