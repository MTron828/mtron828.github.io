411 Appoint the Elven Queen

On the other side.

Under the Blood Elf’s lead, everyone arrived at the Forest of Tree Demons, which was the territory of the Treants.

On the ground, countless tall Treants stood in a forest. They looked no different from the other trees around them, but whether it was their roots that could break free from the ground at any time or the old faces on the trees, they were all different.

Unlike the gnolls, these Treants did not even notice the arrival of Eli and the others in the sky.

!!

“Sir, this is the territory of the Treants.” The Blood Elf Priest said respectfully to Eli.

After what had just happened, no one dared to underestimate this Mage!

The others were also looking at Eli, curious about what Eli would do. These Treants were very difficult to deal with compared to the gnolls. They were not as easy to kill as ordinary creatures.

Eli naturally understood that a single-target attack like the one before would not be able to cause devastating damage to the Treants.

So his choice was

Eli stretched out his staff, and a huge celestial body suddenly stood in the sky, emitting a powerful aura.

” Spell, Lava Calamity! ”

Eli waved his staff, and the huge celestial body behind him let out a furious roar. At the same time, all the fire elements within a few hundred miles gathered in this direction, and a huge amount of Celestial Power gushed out. In the sky, huge fireballs that were as hot as the sun appeared.

Each fireball was more than a hundred meters in diameter. The interior of the fireball was burning with scorching lava, while the outer layer was burning with orange flames, like the tentacles of a demon.

The Blood Elf Priests instantly felt the surrounding temperature rise by dozens of degrees, and even the air was glowing.

“Gulp!” The Blood Elf Priest’s throat moved slightly, and the corners of his mouth twitched!

Every fireball made him feel a fatal threat. What was ridiculous was that there were nearly fifty of them!

A total of 50, wasn’t that a little too much?

On the ground, the Treants, who were slow to react to the environment, seemed to have sensed the changes in the surrounding environment. Their tightly shut eyes opened one by one, and the branches on their bodies swayed!

When they saw the 50 suns in the sky, all the Treants were stunned.

As elementary intelligent life forms, this was a test of their brain capacity.

How could there be 50 suns in the sky?

No, waitMoreover, the fireball seemed to be getting closer and closer to them.

Some of the Treants were relatively calm at first, but when they saw the 50 suns fall, they instantly lost their calm. They let out strange sounds as if they were communicating!

However, it was already too late. As countless fireballs fell on the Treants, intense flames spread in all directions, devouring everything.

Whether it was the new zero-circle Treants or the ancient fourth-circle Treants, they were all eliminated by this gentle flame. They did not even struggle much!

The flames seemed to have intelligence as they only gathered in the area of the Treants. The flames lasted for a full half an hour before dissipating, leaving only scorched earth. As for the Treants, they had already disappeared in flames!

In the sky, the Elven Priests looked at the hell-like area in the forest, the scorched earth on the ground, and even the glass-like area. Their mouths twitched!

The powerful Treants clan was gone so easily!

” Blood Elf Priest, I’ll have to trouble you to sort out the loot here! ” Ely said to the Blood Elf Priest.

“Yes, sir!” The Blood Elf Priest nodded.

In the next second, Eli left with a few elves while the Blood Elf Priest flew down.

He had thought that he was here to help in the battle, but in the end, he was here to help loot the battlefield!

On the other side!

Eli and the others had also arrived at the Astral Spirit race’s territory. They were creatures that were like light bulbs, emitting faint light. Their system was different from humans, and they were good at sealing spells. They were once responsible for sealing some world wounds and other dangerous areas during the mage era.

This race was also in a valley, so it was very convenient to clean them up.

When the endless dark shadow flooded the valley like an ocean, all the spirit bodies instantly sank into it, and the light they emitted was swallowed by the darkness!

In less than five minutes, the race ended. Eli left another elven priest to deal with it before leaving again.

Another hour passed.

Bearman Clan!

The powerful Bearman Race bravely fought against Eli but was once again slapped to death!

Eli left another Elven Priest to deal with it.

After that, Eli led the other Elven Priests back to the Moon Elves!

It was noon when they set off, but it was dusk when they returned. This was because they had been delayed for too long on the road!

When Eli returned to the treehouse with a few priests, the moon elf priest was eating with Erwin!

“Yolanda, it’s done. The few forces have been dealt with by Sir!” The flower elf priest said happily.

The fruit in the Moon Elf Priest’s hand fell to the ground with a thud!

“What did you say?”

The Moon Elf Priestess was stunned!

—————–

After half an hour, Yolanda finally accepted the shocking fact that Eli had taken care of several races!

“Sir, you’re really amazing!” Yolanda shook her head. She still felt like she was dreaming!

She thought that Eli would deal with those races, but she didn’t expect it to be done in such a way.

This was simply a massacre!

‘Fortunately, the elves were the first to come into contact with you!’ The same thought popped up in Yolanda’s mind as she sighed deeply. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

...

“Next is the unification of the elves.” Eli looked at them and said.

“Yes, sir!” Yolanda nodded and continued, “Sir, without the obstruction of a few races, there won’t be too many problems with the unification of the elf race. However, I feel that the elf race can’t be like us now. There must be a ruler or a representative!”

“We priests definitely can’t do it because this is the rule of the elves. I want Erwin to be the queen of the elves. What do you think, sir?” Yolanda looked at Eli and suggested.

“Ah, Lord Priest, how can this be?” Erwin was dumbfounded!

How did this have anything to do with her?

The other Elven Priests widened their eyes and stared at Yolanda as if they hadn’t expected this!

“Sure!” Eli nodded.

He still needed direct contact with the elves or to balance the internal conflicts of the elves, so the elf’s strength could not be too strong. There was also an important factor, which was that Eli recognized Erwin’s determination, courage, and strength. She was also at the limit of third circle, and was indeed a good candidate!

The other Elven Priests were so jealous that their eyes turned red!

Sinister Yolanda!

However, they understood that this matter had nothing to do with them. The moon elves had always been the royal family of elves. Moreover, the moon elves were the first to come into contact with Eli, so they had no right to decide.

...

Even in the past, the ruler of the elves was directly appointed by the mage Alliance.

Eli was the representative of the Mage Alliance, so he naturally had the authority to do so!

With just a few words, Eli decided on the future queen of the elves.

However, this elven queen was filled with fear and unease. She opened her mouth wide and said nervously,” Sir, I think there are many elves who are better than me. I might not be able to take up this position! ”

“Erwin!” Yolanda wanted to scold Ivan when she saw that she had refused!

But then, Eli spoke.

He looked at Erwin. ” Believe in yourself. If I think you can do it, you can. The other priests will help you. ”

The other Priests nodded. They were actually very happy that the elves, who had been separated for hundreds of years, were reunited.

Erwin took a deep breath and said to Eli, “Yes, my lord!”

“Yes.” Eli laughed.

Bang!

At this moment, there was a knock on the door. The door opened, and a few priests who were helping to search for resources entered.

“It seems that everyone has returned. Let me introduce you. This is the new Elven Queen of the future race. I hope that everyone can do their best to assist her in the future!” Eli stood up and pulled Erwin in front of him, introducing her to the priest again.

The Elven Priests who had just entered were shocked. They didn’t expect such a thing to happen in such a short time.

However, they had already seen Eli’s strength, so they naturally would not disobey!

Therefore, in the treehouse, with the sunset outside the window, a few elven priests lowered their heads respectfully and said, ” Lord Eli, Queen Erwin. ”

Eli smiled.

Of course, before that, Eli had to take stock of his gains this time!
