286 The Terrifying Klay

“Kill!”

The killing intent was as cold as the autumn wind, and it spread across the entire battlefield. The massive bloodline tower Army was instantly mobilized like a giant beast that was moving.

Kill!

Tens of thousands of warlocks and magical beasts let out angry roars. Countless roars joined together, and countless warlocks rushed towards the Holy tower like a stream of steel.

!!

As they ran, blood-red pillars of light burst forth. The warlocks’ bloodline power was activated, and it was like a stream converging into a sea.

The power of the bloodline was like a beast, roaring and rushing toward the Holy tower.

Upon seeing this terrifying scene, many of the Holy tower warlocks were even trembling slightly, their hearts trembling!

“Thankfully, Lord Klay is here!”

In the sky above the Holy tower, Situ was also moved by this scene.

‘It’s hard to imagine that the bloodline tower has already grown to such an extent. Fortunately, Sir is here today.’

“How terrifying!” Woox, on the other hand, had a serious look in his eyes.

He had never seen such a scene before.

“Kill!”

Situ also flew into the sky, countless bolts of lightning coiling around him. The air rippled, and his momentum was like a Thunderbird that covered a corner of the sky.

Kill!

The warlocks of the Holy tower heard the sound and moved.

The first to move out was the massive magical beast Army at the front. These magical beasts were the best meat shields, and the 10000 magical beasts that formed the front line were advancing forward like a wall!

Even the lowest magical beast was at least two to three meters tall. Thus, when these magical beasts advanced together, the entire ground seemed to shake, and it was accompanied by flying dust.

And behind this line of magic beast cavalry were the Holy tower warlocks who were charging forward. They also activated their spell formations, allowing the elements to fully envelop every Warlock, allowing them to burst out with even more power.

On the battlefield, the warlocks ‘bloodlines had been stimulated to the extreme, and many warlocks’ bloodshot eyes were already filled with bloodlust.

The distance of a few kilometers was not worth mentioning to magic beasts and warlocks.

Two armies set off from both sides and converged toward the center.

Behind the Holy tower Warriors, Woox took a deep breath, and the flames that spewed out immediately drowned him. This person was like a ball of fire, and in his hand, an iron staff covered with dark patterns appeared.

Flames gushed out from his body, and like a meteor, he was the first to collide with the bloodline tower’s Army.

The flames that filled the sky descended like lava. He waved the iron staff in his hand, and in an instant, dozens of warlocks were burned to ashes by the flames!

A gap had appeared in the corner of the battle line!

“Stop!”

However, before Woox could make another move, a huge gray hand had already appeared. It extinguished the flames and then grabbed at him!

“Nikola is here!”

Countless spirits of the dead were wailing around him, and the aura of death was surrounding him.

He led Woox to the sky, and the two of them began to fight! Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“Hahahaha, let’s have a great battle!”

Seeing this scene, the people in the sky laughed.

On the other side, Situ, who was flying in the sky, looked toward the core of the Holy tower.

The lightning in the sky gathered and turned into a Thunderbird. Accompanied by a terrible shriek, Situ’s eyes were determined as he rushed toward the bloodline tower’s camp. His target was the warlocks led by Vivika.

“Go to hell, Vivika!”

Situ’s speed was extremely fast as if he was a real bolt of lightning.

Like a bolt of lightning, he charged directly at Vivika.

Seeing this scene, Vivika immediately got ready. The wind element flowed down her shoulders like a Cape and then turned into wings on the back of her shoulder.

A silver longbow appeared in her hand. It was completely silver and covered with complicated and beautiful patterns. The bowstring was empty as if there was nothing there.

Vivika held the bow in her left hand and pulled the string with her right.

As if a real bowstring had appeared, a huge amount of wind element gathered and turned into a wind element arrow. It then rushed toward Situ with the power of wind and Thunder!

The sharp arrow cut through the air and collided with Situ.

To everyone’s surprise, the lightning expanded and instantly devoured the lightning.

“Vivika, if this is all you’ve got today, then you’ll die here!”

The speed of the lightning became even faster as it rushed toward Vivika.

“Damn it, it’s that strong?”

“Protect lady Vivika!”

“Come quickly!”

Several three-circle warlocks beside Vivika were shocked when they saw this scene. They immediately surrounded Vivika.

“he’s stronger than Sergei!”

Vivika’s eyes widened.

Situ had always been annoying, but he rarely made a move. Even Vivika didn’t expect him to be so powerful.

Her attack just now, with the support of the wizard weapon, was an attack that did not fall below the limit of third circle!

...

However, she did not panic because …

In the next second, a huge figure flew out of the corner of Vivika’s eye.

The huge shadow’s body was over a hundred meters long. It had three snake heads, and each of its eyes was emitting a different elemental power. The Hydra, who had not taken the initiative all this while, had also made its move!

“Lord Hydra has made his move!”

“We’re safe!”

The warlocks beside Vivika were relieved and calmed down.

Although Situ was very powerful, he was definitely not enough to look at in front of Lord Hydra.

In their hearts, the Hydra was an invincible existence below the celestial realm.

“Hehe!”

However, what surprised them was that when they saw the Hydra charging over …

Unexpectedly, Situ did not Dodge at all. In fact, he did not even move.

...

Like a warrior, he charged towards Hydra.

“A Hydra!” In the sky, Situ could feel his speed, and he took a deep breath before shouting, “Lord Klay, it’s time to make a move!”

Situ’s voice would reverberate throughout the battlefield.

At this time, he finally chose to reveal each other’s last trump card.

The moment Situ shouted, everyone heard a thunderous sound and saw a purple lightning flash behind the Holy tower.

In the blink of an eye, the lightning bolt had already arrived on the battlefield.

Upon hearing the powerful thunderclaps in the sky, Hydra immediately raised one of its heads, and a hint of uneasiness flashed in its eyes.

It could sense that the lightning posed a great threat to it!

In the next second, lightning bloomed, and a huge lightning hand appeared. It was like lightning Dragon flying towards Hydra. Along with the sound of the shadow and lightning colliding, the lightning wrapped around Hydra.

Then, like a rope, it actually pulled the Hydra directly from the ground into the sky.

At that moment, the lightning gradually dissipated, revealing the man’s appearance.

Klay’s eyes were calm, and the giant hand in his right hand, which was covered in lightning, grabbed the Hydra.
