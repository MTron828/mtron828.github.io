270 Failed Celestial

The moon was as dark as ink!

The cold moonlight shone down, illuminating the scene North of the Holy tower on the West Coast.

In the North, it was no longer near the sea. It was surrounded by land. It was a large Highland area with a lot of resources, but the environment was not good.

Situ and Sancher were walking on the ground at the moment, surrounded by thick fog. Due to the altitude, they did not dare to fly too high.

“We’ll be there soon!” Situ looked at the mist around him and let out a deep breath.

“You don’t need to say that.” Sancher, who was standing beside him, glanced at him and said, ” compared to this, we should be more worried about Herman. He might be stronger than we thought!

“Indeed, but even though the Lord is asleep, we still have Lord Klay. As long as he agrees to our request, there won’t be a big problem.” Situ pursed his lips and said.

“Sir Klay doesn’t belong to any faction, ” Sancher said. “it won’t be easy to convince him.”

“Don’t worry. I have an idea!” Dous smiled and looked at the fog in front of him.

At this moment, the outline of a building could be seen at the edge of the fog.

In the midst of the mist, Mage towers could be seen on the plateau, and the sounds around them gradually increased. A bustling city of warlocks had appeared.

This was the city where the hourglass was located, Hall City!

“An idea?” On the other hand, Sancher was a little puzzled.

“Hehe, you’ll know when the time comes!” Situ smiled but did not say anything.

“Alright,” Sancher nodded and did not say anything else.

Very quickly, after an identity check, the two of them entered the city.

Passing through the crowd, the two of them first headed to their territory and told others about the recent events. One by one, the hourglass warlocks expressed their shock.

After a series of procedures, the two of them passed through a large number of buildings and arrived in front of a Tower in the center of the city.

Fatty Situ knocked on the door gently, then stepped back to the side to wait, with Sancher following beside him.

A few seconds later, the door opened, and a Warlock apprentice poked his head out. He looked at the two and said, ” you can go back now. Master Klay will not participate in your competition!”

The Warlock was about to close the door after he finished speaking, but he was stopped by Situ.

With one hand on the door, he smiled and said, “I’ve heard that Milord’s grandson was heavily injured some time ago and has fallen unconscious. We can save him.”

The apprentice was stunned and hesitated.

At this moment, a hoarse voice came from the Wizard Tower. It seemed to be very far but also very close.

“Let them in!”

Hearing the sound, the apprentice did not hesitate and slowly opened the door.

“Milords, please!”

Situ took a look at Sancher, and then the two of them looked at each other and walked in together.

The Wizard Tower looked very old. There were only a few alchemy lamps on the wall that were not so bright. Magic stones were used as energy sources and emitted a dim light. As soon as they entered, the two felt an inexplicable pressure.

Hu! ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Situ took a deep breath, his mind recalling the information on this important figure.

He was once the person in charge of the hourglass. His talent was extraordinary, and it was said that even Her Excellency valued his talent. He once studied by her side when Her Excellency was still awake, and he quickly reached the limit of the third circle.

However, when he reached the limit of three rings, a tragedy occurred. It was said that there was an accident during his breakthrough, which caused him to fail. But interestingly, perhaps because of his bloodline, he didn’t die. Instead, he fell into a special situation.

Although he didn’t advance, he was still much stronger than an ordinary third circle warlock.

Some people called this state a half-step celestial.

Soon, the two of them were brought to a room.

There was a bed in the room, and a young man was lying on it. His eyes were closed, and his mental power fluctuations were very strange as if he had disappeared. Beside him stood an old man. His eyes were very bright, and his hair was gray and white. However, his back was bent, and he gave off a feeling of loneliness.

“My Lord!”

Situ understood that this was the person they were looking for.

“Can you really wake him up?” The old man looked at the young man on the bed, his eyes full of sighs.

“of course, my Lord. We found a precious stalk of dead Soul Flower in the central region some time ago. This kind of magical plant can even be said to be in the fourth circle. It has a miraculous effect on this kind of soul sealing. Perhaps it can help my Lord!” The bloodline ring in Situ’s hand flashed, and a box was taken out.

The apprentice took it and handed it to Klay.

Klay took it, opened it gently, and then closed it again.

A few seconds later, he spoke. “I know what happened to you. By right, master is still asleep. I shouldn’t get involved in this. But you’ve helped me a lot this time.

“When the time is right, I’ll make a move!”

“Understood!” Situ revealed a smile but then said, “But it’s not necessary for Milord to take action. We have more methods than this. Unless it’s absolutely necessary, we won’t ask Milord to take action.”

“Alright,” Klay said softly and did not say anything else!

“Then we’ll take our leave first!” The two of them had already achieved their goal, so they naturally did not plan to stay any longer.

Very quickly, the two of them left the Magus tower. As soon as they left the tower, they saw that there were already three or four warlocks outside the Magus tower. Each of them exuded a very strong aura, and the one in front had even reached the limit of the third circle!

The one at the front was a brawny man with short black hair and a dark body. He was frowning as he stared at Situ with an extremely unhappy expression.

“Situ, you shouldn’t have dragged Lord Klay into your plan!”

“Hehe, that’s our business.” Situ smiled, his third-circle aura also spreading out.

The other party was an old enemy of his. They were the other party who had insisted on waiting for their master to wake up before taking action.

“Sorry, Andrew, we have to go!” Situ smiled and didn’t want to waste any more time.

...

“Stop!” The burly man wanted to stop him.

At this time, suddenly, a huge aura came from the Wizard Tower. Andrew only felt that it was difficult to breathe, and he couldn’t even move his feet. The other warlocks couldn’t bear it and directly knelt on the ground!

“Hehe, thank you, Sir.” Situ bowed to the back and turned to leave.

After they left, Andrew and the others could finally move.

“Was that Lord Klay?” Andrew’s expression was ugly.

As a peak third-circle Warlock, and one of the best bloodlines of the third-circle, the amount of power he had was more than 70 times that of a Mage, but he couldn’t even withstand the aura of Klay.

“Damn it, let’s go.” After a few seconds, he cursed and left.

The situation was no longer under their control. They would have to see how capable these guys could be.

..

“Teacher, another third circle soul master joined us today!”

In the tower of the bloodline tower, Eli and Vivika sat together and said.

...

Eli nodded.

This time, Sergei and the other Wizards were too arrogant. They attracted the attention of all the forces, and the news of Eli’s battle was also spread.

Herman’s fame spread again, and a few statues of him were erected in the White Tower. This group of kids finally believed in the relationship between Herman and the White Tower.

It was very interesting.

After that, Eli returned to the bloodline tower with the awakened Vivika and the others.

What happened after that surprised Eli. A large number of warlocks came to join the bloodline tower, and in just a few days, three or four third-circle warlocks had joined the bloodline tower.

As for these people, they were mostly warlocks who had escaped after Heart of Darkness ‘defeat. Some of them had joined in from the sidelines, which led to the bloodline tower’s rapid expansion!

“But teacher, with so many third circle warlocks joining us, I’m worried that I won’t be able to suppress them!” Vivika was a little worried!

“Don’t worry. I’m here!” Eli laughed.

“Hehe!”

Vivika smiled, and a smile appeared in her heart.

“But the Holy tower will definitely make a move later. You have to be careful!” Eli looked at Vivika.

From the Warlock’s mouth, Eli learned more about the situation, but he also had a better understanding of the Holy tower. He understood that this was a powerful force.

He had to be careful.

So after this, he had to return to the iris temporarily. He would not come out until he was strong enough. Of course, he had to wait for one thing to be over.

That was the silver Moon banquet.

In the blink of an eye, another 50 years had passed, and the Silver Moon conference would be held in 10 years!

And for some reason, Jin Ji hadn’t left the West Coast yet. He was already a Peak 2-circle Warlock, a true genius Warlock.

Therefore, he had to invite Jin Ji again.
