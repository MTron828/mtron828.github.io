358 Crushing Battle

Looking at the huge shadow dragon that was several times larger than them, everyone held their breaths and vaguely felt that something was wrong.

“Five hundred meters?” The huge mountain giant let out a muffled sound, and its huge eyes were filled with confusion.

The size of the bloodline avatar didn’t really matter much. The main thing was that the size of the true body would naturally be different if the bloodline were different. For example, although his strength was the weakest among the four of them, his body was the largest, reaching 200 meters.

However, although he did not know what the bloodline of the creature in front of him was, its body had reached an exaggerated size of 500 meters. It was even larger than him.

!!

This made him feel a little uneasy.

The blazing flames around the Blazing Lion were also swaying. Clearly, his thoughts were also fluctuating.

On the other hand, the Psychedelic Butterfly Warlock remained calm, flying in the air.

“Don’t be afraid. As far as I know, his bloodline is an ancient dragon, so his body is huge.” Although Wellington didn’t recognize the bloodline of Eli, he knew that he had to do something. At least, he had to fool them.

After Wellington finished speaking, a few of them clearly calmed down a lot.

“Attack together.” Wellington let out an angry roar and rushed toward Eli, followed by the others.

However, the Mountain Giant had only run a few hundred meters when it saw a huge green fireball appear in front of it, emitting an icy temperature.

He quickly dodged, and the flames flew past and smashed into the mountain behind him.

Instantly, flames covered the entire mountain, burning wantonly. The creatures on it clearly looked fine, but they died one by one. Their souls were burned to death.

The mountain giant frowned and looked up. Nikola was looking at him.

“Your opponent is me,” Nikola said calmly.

He had been reflecting on himself for more than a thousand years. His experiences as a mage in the past had made him feel that the way of the undead was monotonous. With the help of Eli, he created sorcery that belonged to the undead, the system of undead sorcery. He was the only one who knew how to use it.

He was also pursuing to become stronger. He did not wish to be pulled too far away from Eli.

In fact, Eli alone was enough for today’s battle, but Eli let them take action.

” Sir, you’re actually trying to help us adapt to the battle between celestials! ” Nikola sighed, his eyes turning colder as he looked at the Mountain Giant.

Even if a mage had become an undead, he was more powerful than a warlock.

In the next second, countless death flames flew toward the Mountain Giant, and the stone pillar in the Mountain Giant’s hand smashed toward it.

The battle began.

On the other side.

The roaring Hydra shot out four beams of light that were 100 meters long. They were of different elements and attacked the Blazing Lion. The Blazing Lion retaliated with flames and spat out flames from its mouth. It was like a cannonball that could destroy the world. In the next second, the attack was canceled.

Meanwhile, Hydra had already arrived in front of the Blazing Lion, and it immediately latched onto it. Close combat!

The lion roared, and the snake hissed.

Although the Hydra’s energy level was slightly lower, its combat instincts were not lacking at all. Chimeras were originally created by Magi to fight, and their combat instincts were imprinted in their cores.

On the other side, the manticore and the Psychedelic Butterfly charged at Ely.

The huge manticore took the lead. Every step it took was dozens of meters. The trees on the ground were easily destroyed, and the smoke it raised was hundreds of meters high. It opened its mouth and stretched out its sharp claws, clawing at Eli.

During this period of time, Wellington had learned a lot about the West Coast and was very familiar with the environment there.

The density of elementals there was far inferior to those in the central continent. Even Radiant Moon rank would require at least a thousand years. However, he observed that Eli’s vitality was rather abundant, like the morning sun. He was at the peak of a Warlock’s vitality. To be able to reach the Nebula rank was already a genius.

Although the size was a little ridiculous, some creatures were naturally huge.

“Eli, let me see how strong you are!” Wellington roared.

Eli looked at Wellington, who was charging at him. The shadow of his dragon tail coiled behind him, and he smashed at Wellington.

It was covered in scales, long and thick, like a long whip that had been magnified countless times.

Wellington’s eyes were filled with confidence. In the next second, his sharp claws collided with the dragon’s tail.

His huge pupils suddenly shrank. He felt a huge force coming from the dragon’s tail, accompanied by a powerful shadow power. It was completely on a different level from his own strength.

“How is that possible?” Wellington could not believe it.

In the next second, his huge body flew out from the opposite direction like a cannonball.

He passed through a few mountains in a row and finally embedded himself into a huge mountain. The blood outside his body flowed out like a waterfall, nourishing the earth.

“How is that possible?” Wellington crawled out of the mountain and looked at the Shadow Dragon Eli in the distance with a confused expression.

How could he be so powerful?

Not far away, the Psychedelic Butterfly also retreated rapidly and looked at Eli cautiously.

The estimated difference in strength was too great. It was not right that a single attack could send Wellington flying so far.

“Purple Sand, let’s go all out. There’s something wrong with this guy.” Wellington came to Psychedelic Butterfly’s side and said, with blood flowing out.

“Okay!” The Psychedelic Butterfly made a sound.

In the next second, the eyes on her huge wings lit up like two moons. Countless purple dreamy bubbles appeared in a radius of a few kilometers. Illusions separated from reality appeared, pulling Eli and Wellington into the illusory space.

“I’ll cover you.”

With the appearance of the illusory space, the Psychedelic Butterfly’s figure turned into countless bubbles and disappeared from the vision of the two people.

Wellington was also surrounded by countless bubbles and disappeared from sight.

“Illusion!”

Eli lowered his head to look. The ground had turned into a lake that looked like a dream. It was a false illusion, as if he was already in another world.

“Interesting!” Eli pursed his lips, and the dragon’s eyes gradually turned from gold to silver.

With the use of the Silver Eye, Eli’s vision changed drastically.

...

The illusionary dream faded like bubbles. Not far away, Wellington, who had transformed into a manticore, slowly approached Ely. He tiptoed, giving off a comical feeling. The air around him was filled with illusory purple discs, and he saw the psychedelic butterfly walking through them.

Eli smiled.

It seemed that the Silver Eye was powerful enough.

Of course, the illusion was still there, but Eli’s vision had changed.

He looked at the manticore calmly and did not move, but he had already begun to prepare the Shadow Dragon Breath.

In their field of vision, Ely was standing there in a daze as if he could not see anything.

‘Why are his eyes changing color?’ Purple Sand, who was hiding in the illusory passage, was puzzled. He noticed the change in Eli’s eyes.

Wellington was now very close to Eli, only a hundred meters away. Wellington’s scorpion tail was also raised high, accumulating power, and preparing to strike with all his might. Eli would definitely not be able to react in time.

“Go to hell.” Wellington looked at Eli with resentment as he accumulated more and more power.

In the illusory passage, Purple Sand was still puzzled and continued to observe.

But soon, he noticed that the Shadow Dragon’s throat seemed to be squirming abnormally, and its sharp claws were slightly bent as if it was preparing for something!

...

That was not right.

Had he seen through everything?

“Wellington!” The Psychedelic Butterfly’s voice suddenly sounded.

However, it was too late. The scorpion’s tail had already stabbed out, and its speed had reached its peak.

“Go to hell!” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“No!”

Purple sand trembled, and the huge shadow dragon flashed as if it had expected this. The scorpion tail brushed past, but a dragon claw grabbed the scorpion tail and pulled it fiercely. The huge body of the manticore was pulled in front of Eli.

In the next moment, a loud roar was heard, and a huge shadow pillar of light spewed out from the dragon’s mouth.

The manticore’s head was instantly submerged in the shadows, and the ground trembled. A deep pit of unknown depth appeared, accompanied by cracks in the surrounding ground. With this place as the center, huge cracks spread out in all directions for a few kilometers.

As for the manticore’s body, it slowly disappeared.

The Psychedelic Butterfly, who was hiding in the illusion, trembled. As expected, Eli had not been affected by her illusion from the beginning. Of course, this was not something that made her afraid, but the power that Ely had just erupted with had already surpassed the Morning Star stage.

“He’s a Radiant Sun!” Purple sand was dumbfounded.

Even a force on the level of the manticore couldn’t have such strength.

This was already the top combat strength of the Western Regions.

‘Run!’

That was the only thought in her mind.

However, in the next second, a shadow entered the illusion space, followed by a huge dragon head. Its silver eyes looked at her, and she felt a power stronger than her illusion force forcefully tear apart the illusion she had constructed.

“I found you, little butterfly!” A voice rang out, and she saw the shadow dragon leap in.

Purple Sand looked desperate.

She slowly transformed into her human form and asked bitterly, “Before I die, can you tell me what bloodline power this is?”

“Of course.”

A few seconds later, Purple Sand’s eyes widened. Then, a shadow flashed by, and her body slowly melted from her feet up.

She looked at Eli for the last time, her eyes full of understanding.

“A mage’s power can achieve this level?! How terrifying!”

A leisurely voice was heard. In the next second, her head disappeared into the shadows.

At this point, two Nebula Warlocks had died.
