541 Strange Creature, Core Area, Appearance

Whoosh! Whoosh!

Press panted heavily as he looked around.

At this moment, they were on a steel ground, surrounded by steel signal towers. On the signal towers, elemental cannons were aimed at them, and there were a large number of mechanical products surrounding them.

“Damn it, there are too many of them. There’s no way to finish them off!” Not far away, a man in a white magician robe shouted loudly. He was the current commander of the team, his former master, Saladin.

As for him, he had long been dismissed after that failure!

Bang!

Press felt a little helpless after destroying another robot.

After entering this area, they realized that they couldn’t fly there. Furthermore, a large number of robots surrounded them. There was no lack of high-level fifth-circle robots. These robots were connected to the surrounding creations, and the explosive power was extremely terrifying!

Moreover, there were too many of them, so many that they felt it was ridiculous.

However, they had no choice. This was their last chance.

Just when he thought that they might have to fight here for a longer time, he suddenly realized that the attacks of these robots had suddenly stopped, and they were stunned on the spot.

Looking at the robot that had stopped attacking, they were also dumbfounded.

“What happened? Why did they stop attacking?”

“Yeah, strange!”

“Did something happen?”

The Warlocks were puzzled. In the next second, all the robots moved again. Everyone was nervous. They thought that a new round of attacks had begun, but they realized that these robots actually turned around and left as if they were completely ignoring them.

“Looks like we might have triggered some mechanism. It’s over!” Saladin walked out and smiled.

The others nodded in agreement.

“In that case, let’s continue exploring,” Saladin said.

Crack!

Suddenly, a rustling sound entered their ears.

Turning around, they saw a pitch-black figure that looked a little like a human. However, there were countless eyes on its body that kept blinking. These eyes were staring at them, and their eyes were shining with joy as if they had seen prey!

Gulp!

Saladin and Patriarch Press’s throats moved slightly. They both felt threatened by this strange creature!

..

In the monitoring room, Eli was watching a scene.

At the edge of the screen, the warlocks who had just finished the battle were left with wounds. However, in the center of the battlefield, the monster, the corpses of two divine tree, and one thousand leaves warlocks were left behind.

At this moment, all the eyes on the monster’s body were closed, emitting a strange fluctuation. Meanwhile, the three corpses in the distance were covered in eyes, looking extremely strange.

“Their combat power is comparable to a peak Thousand Leaves, and their methods are mainly mental attacks. They are natural threats to mages and warlocks.” Eli thought about the battle just now and had a deeper understanding of the war in the past.

Thinking of this, he turned to look at Samuel, who was not far away, and said, “Samuel, gather the body of this ‘Eye Devil'(named by Eli), and then transport part of the tissue and the three Warlocks’ corpses to the laboratory. I want to examine them personally!”

Among the many privileges he had obtained, there was also a laboratory. There should be a laboratory not far from here.

“Yes, sir!” Samuel said!

Half an hour later, Eli was already standing at another location.

In a silver lab, there were four experiment tables in the center. Other than the three dead people, there was also a part of Eye Devil’s body.

Taking a deep breath, Eli put on the protective suit and went to the laboratory to begin the dissection.

First, there were three people.

” First, the appearance. There’s a slight mutation, and some tissues have appeared. Then, the eyes should be contaminated by some kind of consciousness. It’s a little like the Black Fog. No, it’s like a derivative of the Black Fog. Then, the blood system is not contaminated for the time being, and…” Eli dissected from the outside to the inside and soon had a general understanding.

The mutation wasn’t big. After all, it was just battle corruption, and they were all high-level Warlocks.

“Let’s look at Eye Devil’s body.” Eli turned to the other side.

The ice-cold scalpel cut open the corpse, and Eli discovered that it was still flesh and blood tissue. It emitted a faint feeling of contamination. It was the same as the source of the black fog. It was a special law that came from the supreme being!

The dissection quickly continued. Eli also made an interesting attempt, but it left him dumbfounded!

“Why does it seem to have no effect on me?” Eli looked at the eyes in front of him in a daze. They were touching part of his flesh, but it was useless.

The thing was not dead, but it still had no effect on him.

“Things are getting interesting!” Eli pursed his lips.

Although the reason had not been found yet, it was definitely a big discovery.

Was there anything special about him?

It seemed that he needed to explore it properly in the future!

At this moment, a figure appeared from the camera at the side.

” Lord Overlord, according to your command, the outer area of the core area has been cleared. At this time, they have already entered the core area and are fighting with the polluted mechanical life forms and cursed creatures in the inner tower!” Samuel lowered her head.

“Oh?”

Eli’s eyes lit up.

The speed was faster than he thought!

“Put these away and go to the monitoring room first!” Eli said quickly and walked out of the laboratory.

Soon, he returned to the monitoring room. Dylan was still there.

Eli ignored him and looked up at the screen.

On the screen.

A towering mage tower stood in the distance. It was unknown how far it was. Below it was a huge steel city. Many polluted mechanical and cursed creatures occupied it. They were no longer under the control of the mage tower. They were only there to prevent people from entering.

Behind them were the remaining 27 Warlocks.

They stepped into the steel forest without hesitation. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The battle erupted.

As soon as they entered, an intense battle erupted. At this moment, these people also erupted with their own strength. It was as if they knew they had no return, and a large number of creatures fell.

“As expected of the Warlock Alliance that has been entrenched for thousands of years. They still have a lot of trump cards. There are even many items that Warlocks can’t use.” Eli looked at the steadily advancing team, as well as a large number of dead machines and creatures on both sides, and the corners of his mouth twitched!

At this moment, it was no longer a competition of combat strength but of foundation!

“How generous!”

..

Time slowly passed, and the thousands of interspatial rings of the Warlock Alliance exploded one by one.

A day later.

At least tens of millions of mechanical lives had died in this city. At this moment, the Warlock Alliance’s foundation was almost exhausted. They began to fight on their own, but the number of enemies had decreased by a lot.

However, as the periphery of the central area where most of the evil creatures had gathered, there were still many powerful creatures. The number of casualties began to rise, but they were indeed getting closer and closer to the center.

At this moment, Eli slowly stood up.

“Milord, where are you going?” Dylan looked up and asked.

“According to the surveillance, most of the creatures in the city have already died. There are only one or two obstacles blocking the way.”

Eli smiled, and Dylan’s eyes lit up.

..

A layer of black fog enveloped the land.

The huge hub stood in the middle, and in the dark room not far away, more than ten figures slowly appeared.

“We are out!”

Saladin let out a long sigh and turned around to look around.

There were still seventeen people, all of whom were Thousand Leaves. As for the Divine Tree, they were all dead.

“Everything is worth it. As long as we obtain that Mage Tower, we can turn everything around!” At this moment, Patriarch Press walked to his side and looked ahead.

“Yes!”

Saladin also looked at the mage tower in front of him.

He had never seen such a beautiful mage tower. It was only a dozen meters tall, completely silver, and without any decorations. This was the control center of the entire planet.

If they controlled this place, they would control the Gray Mage Tower.

Along the way, they had already seen the horror of this mage tower. It had consumed thousands of years of their foundation, and more than 90% of the devices were not activated, and no one was controlling them.

“Victory will eventually belong to us, the Mage Tower, and the Warlock World!”

He shouted, and the surrounding gazes flashed with fanaticism.

Da da da da!

However, at this moment, a sound that sounded like a walking stick hitting the ground rang out.

Everyone was stunned and turned around. A figure slowly walked out from the black fog.

“Everyone, thank you for your hard work!”

Eli walked out slowly, holding a wizard’s staff in his left hand and his right hand on his chest.
