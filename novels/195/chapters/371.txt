372 Personal Greeting

In the conference room.

Eli sat at the head of the table, Glen stood to the side, and Simon was at the end of the table, further away.

However, Simon was standing straight on the spot with a serious expression. He lowered his head slightly and curled his hands tightly.

” Tell me, what is the plan of the Amina Family? ” Eli asked.

!!

” Uh, Sir, our request is regarding the ownership of the Grassi Land. There’s another condition that even I think is too much, ” the Warlock added awkwardly. ” It’s about separating Bloodline City and Grassi Land from the Bloodline tower and making them the territory of the Amina Family. ”

Eh?

Eli’s expression was strange.

“Sir, I’m also against this. After all, Bloodline City is an inseparable part of the Bloodline Tower. However, the family has already made the decision, so I can’t do anything about it.” Simon looked indignant as if he was on the same side as the Bloodline Tower.

Eli quietly watched this person’s performance, then turned to look at Glen, whose mouth was twitching, and asked, “Glen, what do you think of this matter?”

” Sir Eli, of course, I don’t agree. Besides, they didn’t do anything when the Manticore Family invaded. ” Glen was also fuming.

Before the war, they backstabbed the Bloodline Tower, and after the war, they had come to take resources.

They had gone overboard.

Eli nodded and looked at Simon. “What do you think?”

At this moment, Simon’s forehead was covered in a cold sweat. He felt that if he could not answer this question well, he would not need to leave.

After pausing for more than ten seconds, he gritted his teeth and said,” Sir, of course, I’m against this, but this is our family leader’s decision. I’m not the one who makes the decision. ”

After saying that, Simon could feel his back getting wet, and his heart was beating fast.

“Not a bad answer.” Eli smiled.

Simon forced a smile, and then he saw Eli take out a die.

What was he doing?

Moreover, it was a 20-sided one. It did not look ordinary.

Simon didn’t understand, but when he saw the dice spinning on the table, it was time for his fate to be judged.

The dark golden dice spun on the table. There seemed to be a mysterious aura circling around them. The dice reflected the sunlight from the outside world, making it look even more dazzling.

Ten seconds later, the dice stopped.

Glen and Simon couldn’t help but look over.

20 points!

In the next second, he saw a big hand take the die. Following the hand, he saw Eli smiling at him.

“Don’t worry. I won’t do anything to you.”

Simon heaved a sigh of relief, but his heart jumped to his throat again in the next second.

“Is the Amina Family far from the Bloodline Tower?” asked Eli.

Cough!

Before Simon could reply, Glen had already said, “My lord, the Amina Family is the third-level force closest to the Bloodline Tower. If we use the speed of a celestial, we might be able to reach it in a day, but if we use a flying tool, it might take us about three days. ”

“Sir, could it be that you intend to … ” Glen seems to be somewhat unable to believe his guess.

However, Eli did not answer him. Instead, he asked Simon again, “Simon, how did you get here?”

“I came here on a magical flying beast,” Simon replied.

“Then you don’t mind me joining you on the way back, right?” Eli asked with a smile.

What?

Simon and Glen opened their mouths wide.

“Sir, are you planning to go to the Amina Family?” Glen asked uncertainly.

“Of course. Didn’t Simon say that he couldn’t make the decision? Then I’ll find someone who can make the decision. Moreover, the Amina family is our superior force. It’s not appropriate not to pay a visit.” Eli stretched his body and looked at Simon. “You wouldn’t mind, would you?”

“I don’t mind. I don’t mind.”

Simon’s expression was uglier than crying.

The head of the family was a Radiant Moon Warlock. Logically speaking, if Eli went to the Amina family, he would be like a lamb on the chopping board. However, Simon had a bad feeling about this.

“Then let’s set off. The earlier we go, the earlier we return.” Eli stood up and walked over to pull Simon out. He shouted at Glen, “Glen, I’ll be counting on you for the next few days. Nikola and Hydra are in the Grassi Land. If you need help, you can go and ask for it. ”

Just like that, under Eli’s instructions, Glen watched as Eli pulled Simon away. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Simon, on the other hand, was stiff and allowed Ely to pull him as if he was in a vegetative state.

“Just like that?”

Glen’s mouth twitched. Isn’t this too brave? Eli was prepared to go to the Amina family to discuss it personally.

Glen also had a worried look on his face. Judging from the current situation, they wouldn’t be able to negotiate properly!

He hoped that everything would go smoothly.

….

An hour later.

Accompanied by a sharp eagle cry, a huge green eagle flew into the sky.

Eli sat in the middle of the eagle while Simon sat in the corner, trembling.

“By the way, will it be a problem for you to let your people walk back?” Eli suddenly turned around and asked.

...

“Milord, it’s fine,” Simon replied.

” That’s good. I’ll meditate for a while. Call me when we reach our destination. ” Eli said again.

“Yes, sir.” Simon immediately nodded, but his heart could not help but tremble rapidly.

The Alina family had the bloodline of a humanoid creature called the Two-Winged Angel. It had great power, and that was that it had a certain danger sense. When Ely had gently patted him, he had felt that he had suddenly encountered a huge danger, and when he had pulled him out just now, that feeling …

Simon’s throat moved slightly.

That feeling made him feel like he was walking on the edge of a cliff. It was ten times more terrifying than when he faced the family leader.

“Patriarch, don’t blame me!” Simon had a feeling that he might have done something stupid this time.

….

On the other side.

A few minutes after Simon brought Eli with him, a Warlock quickly left.

A piece of news quickly traveled thousands of miles across the ocean and arrived on Jerre’s table.

...

In the room.

Jerre looked at the message and sneered.

He knew that the Amina family would not be able to hold it in, but he did not know what choice Elo would make.

However, since Eli went to the Amina family, he might not be able to come out in one piece.

The patriarch of the Amina family was a more sinister and vicious person than him. He would not allow anyone under his command to threaten their rule.

Maybe the Amina Family would help him solve this problem.

“Good!”

Jerre leaned back in his chair, feeling happy.

The organizations under his command had already finished their preparations. The next step was to wait for news about Eli before launching an attack.

…

Time passed. In the blink of an eye, three days had passed.

“Milord, we’ve arrived.”

The meditating Eli was awakened by Simon.

Eli stretched and stood up.

The next step was to have a good talk with the Amina family.
