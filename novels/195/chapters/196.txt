197 The Waiting Crowd

The leader knelt on the ground, his face full of helplessness.

At this moment, he only wanted to slap himself for his ignorance. They had seriously underestimated the White Tower, or more accurately, they had seriously underestimated Herman’s strength.

This Warlock, or rather, Mage, was simply outrageous.

One against eight, but he beat them easily.

!!

He looked around and saw the bodies of the other second-circle warlocks lying on the ground. They were so arrogant a few hours ago, but now no one made a sound.

He was arrogant earlier too, and now he was in a sorry state.

As he surrendered, the skeletons around him also retreated to the sides. Among the white bones, he finally saw the enemy they were fighting against, Herman.

“You’ve really hidden your strength well!” He looked at Eli with a complicated expression.

“No, I’ve never hidden. It’s just that you guys are too weak.” Eli shook his head.

The team leader, “…” Do you have to speak the truth?

“Tell me, how many people do you have behind you? What is your specific strategy? Also, what methods do you plan to use to attack? if you can satisfy my knowledge, I might let you go.” Eli looked at him and said calmly.

“Alright,” he said. The lead hesitated for a moment. At this moment, he only wanted to live.

“We still have a warlock at the peak of the second circle, twenty second-circle warlocks, and one hundred first-circle warlocks. I’ve only brought 500 apprentices this time.”

“I see!” Eli nodded. If that was the case, then there was no need for him to participate in the follow-up.

After all, it would be too ostentatious for him to defeat them all by himself.

The black Isotta warlock in front of him looked up and pondered, and his eyes lit up. This was the opportunity he was looking for.

At such a close distance, if …

The warlock gritted his teeth and made a decision in an instant. Rather than giving up everything to Herman, he might as well take a gamble. Thinking of this, his bloodline power started to circulate at a rapid speed again.

His muscles also began to tighten.

Roar!

In an instant, he let out a furious roar, and then his body instantly charged toward Eli. He punched out, and earth elements gathered. He felt as if his blood was burning.

This was his all-out attack and also his strongest attack.

After all, the heavy rock colossuses were second-circle creatures that were extremely skilled in strength. Therefore, he did not think a mage like Eli could withstand it.

“Go to hell!” He revealed a sinister smile on his face.

The next second, his smile froze.

Bang! Bang!

The punch was blocked.

He looked at the scale-covered Dragon Claw that had grabbed his fist. His powerful strength had been neutralized so easily.

“You …” He was dumbfounded.

This shouldn’t be the case!

‘Your bloodline is this strong too? Aren’t you a mage?’

Raising his head, he looked straight into Eli’s eyes. Eli’s golden vertical pupils exuded an intimidating aura, instantly drenching his back with cold sweat. He revealed an awkward smile.

“Your clothes are a little dirty. I wanted to help you clean them.”

“It’s fine, I’ll do it myself,” Eli revealed a kind smile.

In the next second, Eli exerted force.

“Ah!”

The Warlock let out a terrified roar. His arm was instantly torn off, and then, in his terrified eyes, the Dragon Claw directly grabbed his head.

“No!”

Buzzzzzz!

The black ring lit up, and the Warlock’s mental force rapidly surged into Eli’s mind. The Warlock, on the other hand, had a look of horror on his face, and the light in his eyes slowly disappeared. A minute later, Eli’s mental force rose from 197 to 198. As for the Warlock, he was already dead.

Then, he quickly absorbed the mental force of the other warlocks as well. As long as they were within three hours of death, he could still absorb them.

After the absorption, Eli’s spiritual energy had finally reached the limit of advancement.

200 points.

“Not bad.” Sensing the abundant mental force in his brain, Eli felt a burst of joy.

It had been two to three hundred years since he broke through to the second circle. Now, he was ready to advance. However, advancing to the third circle was very troublesome, so he wasn’t in a hurry.

Stability was the most important.

After sighing for a few seconds, Eli began to collect the relics of the warlocks.

In the end, he collected 600 mid-grade magic stones from the warlocks, which were about 60000 low-grade magic stones. It was a lot if he carried it with him.

Other than magic stones, there were also other things, such as some valuable materials and some secret books.

“Eh, this one’s not bad.” Between the books, Eli found something good.

Burning Blood Secret technique was a secret technique for escaping.

He opened the book and saw the introduction to the secret technique.

This secret technique was discovered from the research of a type of demonic beast, the blood arrow snake. The blood arrow snake was a special creature. When it encountered danger, it would release the blood sac in its body, which would then be activated to escape quickly.

This secret technique was developed from that. When necessary, the warlock could burn his bloodline to escape. If the situation was serious, he could even burn his life force.

...

“Interesting.” After reading the introduction, Eli’s interest was piqued.

Burning blood to burst out with speed. Although this was a secret escape technique, it happened to be what Eli was lacking at the moment.

He would study it when he got back. It was a life-saving method.

Apart from that, the rest were all rather common items. Eli only took a quick glance before storing them in his arcane realm. Currently, with the White Tower, iris cap, and the house of undead behind him, he really didn’t lack any ordinary resources.

After taking care of the spoils of war, Eli cleaned up the traces of the battlefield and returned in the direction of the White Tower.

He did not forget that there was still a Warlock in the White Tower that he had not dealt with. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Rolant.

Eli left the canyon, and ten minutes later, he arrived at the White Tower’s line of defense.

..

At the front line of the White Tower.

This place was originally a plain, but at this time, a seven to the eight-meter-tall wall had been erected on the plain. This wall had been built by the warlocks with the earth’s elemental bloodline.

...

At this time, all the White Tower warlocks on the wall were ready to go.

All the higher-ups of the White Tower were in the middle section.

Kratos, Rawls, Ross, and Lorant …

Kratos stood in the front. After the baptism of time, he had long lost his domineering aura. With the leather armor on his body and his lowered eyes, everyone knew that this might be the last battle for the old man.

He was too old. Unless he burned his life force, he could not possibly burst out with the strength he once had.

Rawls stood on the side.

“Can you really hold on?” He knew very well that this battle was not going to end well.

After all, their first opponents were eight peak second-circle warlocks. At the second circle, warlocks could double their strength with every bloodline core they condensed. It wouldn’t be a problem for a peak two-circle Warlock to fight several late-stage first-circle warlocks.

They could block a few of them, but what about the others?

“But it’s a good thing that Rolant is back.” He cast a glance at Rolant, who was not far away.

This guy suddenly disappeared but he returned half an hour ago. Although Rawls didn’t like him, he had to admit that the man was a powerful warlock.

“Why aren’t they here yet?”

Rolant was also looking into the distance, but he thought that his new masters should be here at this time.

Could it be that they had encountered an obstacle along the way, or had they changed their strategy and decided to wait for the main force to arrive before attacking?

Rolant didn’t know, but he was confident.

The black Isotta Alliance was very strong, and White Tower was no match for them. Before he disappeared, he had used some means to contact them, hoping to defect in advance.

After all, the gap was too big. He couldn’t see any hope, so he might as well surrender. If he did well, he might have a chance to join the black Isotta in the future and obtain the information to advance to the third circle.

Whoever wanted to stay with this dying force could do so.

“Sir Herman, is he really not coming? ” Rawls was worried.

“There’s someone!”

All of a sudden, an alarm rang out. Everyone’s attention was instantly piqued. Over a thousand people at the line of defense were on high alert. This alarm was a detection method from the front. It meant that someone was coming.

The people from the black isotta Alliance had arrived.

Everyone held their weapons and looked forward with determination. They were ready to fight.

Come on!

It was a fight to the end.
