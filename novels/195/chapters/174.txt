175 Rawls’ Refusal

“Is it normal to not leave the house for ten years?”

How could this be normal?

Sores thought that he had met many people in his life, all kinds of weirdos, but Eli trumped all of them. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

He had learned something new.

Eli hadn’t left the house for ten years.

However, he had to avenge his grandson, so Sores could only start thinking of other ways.

So he returned to the blood Alliance and finally found the leader of the blood Alliance. He requested to get spies into the White Tower. At first, the leader was very unwilling, but in front of a large amount of wealth promised by Sores, he finally nodded and agreed.

Ten days later, Sores returned. After some consideration, Sores thought he had chosen someone who had a conflict with Herman and had always disliked him.

Rawls, one of the representatives of the White Tower.

“Rawls, a two-circle Warlock who advanced a year ago, is currently a genius-level figure in the White Tower forces. He’s a rising star in the future and is an excellent genius in all aspects, well-known by many.

“However, he has always been unhappy with Herman and has always wanted to kick him out of his position. I guessed that there might be some conflict between the two of them, and this stemmed from the time when he was in the shadow lizard Warlock camp.” Sores nodded.

He wanted to get Herman out of the White Tower, and this person should be able to do it.

So, one night, he had the lurker send a letter to Rawls.

..

“I want to talk to you about Herman. Meet me in the center of the crying forest.”

On the other side, Rawls was frowning as he read the letter with a dumbfounded expression.

Compared to ten years ago, his aura was much more powerful now. He had also become a second circle warlock and was an influential figure in the White Tower. Many people praised him, but he knew that he was still lacking, especially compared to Herman.

He had been with this guy for almost a hundred years. He had once wanted to defeat and drive this guy away.

However, the incident in the secret realm ten years ago left him with mixed feelings.

On the one hand, he was confused about how Eli had saved him. Although Eli had said that it wasn’t him after the incident and that the Chimera had just left, how could he believe it? After all, he had seen his figure with his own eyes.

Secondly, he clearly remembered that the chimeras he fought back then were in the second circle. Even now, Rawls wasn’t confident he could defeat it.

Although he didn’t know how strong Herman was, he knew that Herman was definitely very strong. In fact, he was ridiculously strong. Ten years had passed, and Herman was probably even stronger than before. This made him feel a little desperate.

Therefore, when a letter suddenly appeared in front of his door, he had mixed feelings.

“Let’s just meet. There shouldn’t be any big problems. What does the owner of this letter want? ” Roars frowned. The crying forest was just at the edge of the White Tower. At this distance, he was absolutely safe.

After putting away the letter, he put on a black suit and set off.

Half an hour later, he arrived at the location mentioned in the letter. There was already a man wearing a black robe and a mask waiting there.

“Rawls, nice to meet you.” Sores said in a hoarse voice while wearing a mask.

“Who are you?” Rawls asked with a frown.

“You don’t need to know who I am. I just want to ask you one question. Do you dislike Herman? ” Sores did not answer but asked instead.

“Yes.” Ross nodded. There was nothing much to say about this matter.

“That’s good.” Under the mask, Sores revealed a smile and released his two-circle late-stage aura. He said, “I can help you deal with him, but I have a condition. You have to help me lure him out of the White Tower.”

Sores was stunned. The person in front of him was actually a late-stage second-circle Warlock. He was a little dumbfounded. Moreover, was he actually going to deal with Herman? was it for the reward?

“You want to deal with Herman?” He asked.

“Yes,” Sores replied with certainty.

“You?” Rawls glanced at Sores and said in a strange tone.

Judging from the operation ten years ago, he guessed that Herman was at least a late-stage second-circle sorcerer or even stronger.

Sores also raised his eyebrows. What did this mean? Rawls was looking down on him.

“Forget it. I’m leaving. You can’t do this.” Rawls threw a glance at that man before turning around and leaving.

Sores was speechless.

What do you mean I can’t do this?

“Hey, I just need you to help me lure him out. It shouldn’t be difficult for you, right? I have one less enemy, and you have one less opponent. Isn’t that good? ” Sores shouted, trying to save the situation.

This was a little different from what he had thought!

“Get lost!” Rawls snorted coldly. “first of all, I don’t think you can kill Herman. You don’t have the ability.

“Second, why do you think I will help you? Let me tell you. I will definitely defeat Herman, but not in this way. I, Rawls, disdained using this method. I want to defeat him fair and square.

“Lastly, you should leave as soon as possible because once you return, I will report you. Also, do not try to attack me here. You won’t be able to kill me in a short time, but the White Tower will definitely notice, and you’ll be dead before you can kill me.”

After saying that, Rawls turned around and left. However, after walking more than 10 steps, he turned around and glanced at Solis, spitting, “What bad luck, you’re wasting my time.”

No ability? Was I too weak?

At this moment, Sores was looking at Rawls’ back with a dumbfounded expression.

Which part of the plan went wrong? It shouldn’t have!

‘It’s completely different than what I’ve imagined. What on earth happened? or is Rawls really that kind of person?’

Ridiculous!

However, this wasn’t the time to think about this. He knew that he should really leave. He believed that Rawls would really report this to his superior, and after that, Sores wouldn’t be able to come here anytime soon.

At least not for the time being.

“F*ck, forget it. White Tower and blood Alliance will have a battle sooner or later.” He gritted his teeth and quickly disappeared into the forest.

He couldn’t figure out how this could have happened.

..

“A late-stage second-circle Warlock?”

A day later, in the tower, Eli looked at the message from the Council.

A second-circle warlock had actually contacted Rawls, trying to trick him out, but he was reported by Rawls.

To be honest, it was a little funny.

“Sigh, it’s a pity he chose the wrong person.” Eli pursed his lips. He knew Rawls very well. Although he had some strange habits, he was indeed an upright person.

He wouldn’t do such a thing. This was also the reason why Eli kept him alive. If this person really had the intention to kill him, why would he keep him?

However, he was a little surprised by Rawls ‘unyielding attitude.

The only question he had was why there was a second circle Warlock waiting outside to ambush him. Fortunately, he had never planned to go out, or he would be in danger if he was ambushed.

“Forget it, forget it. The White Tower will take care of this. I’ll just do what I have to do!” Eli shook his head and walked into the secret plane.

There were still many things on his list that had not been completed!

The first was the progress of his level. His mental force had already reached 80 points. The elemental essence conversion had also reached 82 points. He was getting closer and closer to the limit of the first circle. His bloodline had also reached the late stage of the second circle.

Next was the various learning processes. He had learned a part of spells, but he was slowly mastering alchemy. He was not very familiar with it, and it would take time. Lastly, the Dice of Fate, which he had not even started on. Eli had slightly underestimated the difficulty of this spell.

However, this was normal. After all, this involved fate, and it was still a little too advanced for him at the moment. It was destined that he would need a long time to master it. However, he was very patient. He was determined to get his hands on this spell.

For him, what he needed the most now was to develop silently.

In any case, he would not leave this place until he had settled everything.

Time was still on his side.
