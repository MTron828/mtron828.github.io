498 Choosing the Law Attribute

Eli sorted out his gains and updated his mage tools and reserves.

At the same time, the Bloodline Tower was also sweeping through the entire Western Region at a rapid speed. All the forces were ” actively ” joining the Tower of Bloodline. Even the traitors in the Eastern Region had joined the Bloodline Tower.

Of course, to be cautious, Eli still took out a bloodline contract.

This made many powers hesitate. After all, even if the contract were very loose, if they really signed it, they would be bound to the Bloodline Tower in the future. They would be considered subordinates of the Bloodline Tower.

Therefore, many people were waiting for the Warlock Alliance’s reaction.

But soon, the news spread that the Warlock Alliance had acknowledged the existence of the Bloodline Tower and its current power. This made many powers shocked, and they signed contracts one by one.

The storm of war was over much easier than they imagined.

In just three months, the Bloodline Tower had occupied the Western Region.

From then on, the era of the blood of the Western Regions began.

Another year passed.

The reconstruction of the Bloodline Tower had basically begun.

The City of Dawn had been completely cleaned up. The seal had been strengthened by Eli by dozens of layers, which consumed a lot of lifespans. At the same time, a clone was left here to suppress the Abyss.

Speaking of clones, Eli had already condensed two clones.

One guarded the abyss, while the other headed to the green fields and became ” Roland.”

The two clones had the strength of ” Eli ” on the battlefield. After condensing two clones, Eli had three faith imprints, so he now had seven imprints, all condensed in the past year.

It was very exaggerated.

Even Eli didn’t expect it to be so exaggerated.

However, it was normal to think about it. After all, as the master of a region, it was normal for people to know about it. Of course, there was another reason. Some bastard gave him the title of the number one person below the fifth circle. This was the reason why his reputation soared.

“Sigh, I didn’t want to do this either!” Eli felt helpless.

However, he had no choice but to keep a low profile.

After thinking of a strategy, Eli went into the tower.

..

Three years later.

A piece of news once again shocked the world.

The Bloodline Tower publicly announced the existence of ” Roland “, but they didn’t mention the mage Alliance. They only told everyone that there were hidden Mages in the Green Field and that they needed to be eliminated. They also began to gather an army.

A few months later, the war broke out.

It was said that the first war was extremely fierce, and even the mage ” Roland ” appeared. Eli appeared and fought with him, and both sides suffered!

The world was shocked by Roland’s power and began to question his name.

However, the Warlock Union was very satisfied with the Bloodline Tower’s efforts. They sent a large amount of resources and even some medicine to heal their injuries.

And so, a continuous war began.

At this moment, Eli, who was ” injured ” in the battle with Roland, stretched his body and took a bite of the precious fruit sent by the Warlock Union that could heal wounds.

The taste was really good and very sweet.

“It feels good!” Feeling the weak life energy in his body, this made him feel a little happy. Of course, this was only one aspect. He had even happier things.

“I’ve finally chosen the primary direction of the Laws of Shadow.” Eli took a deep breath.

After three years of thinking.

He finally found what he was best at in the shadows.

“Devour!”

Eli’s eyes gradually became determined.

Whether it was the concealment of the shadow or the power, it had helped him a lot.

However, if one were to say what he was best at, it might still be devouring!

It might have something to do with the devouring runes, but he hadn’t used this ability for a long time. After Eli’s consideration, this direction was the most suitable for him.

Because this was his creation!

“Then I’ll prepare to advance.”

Eli smiled and returned to his room.

..

A month later.

As the thick fog and the spell formation were activated, a large number of shadows surged out from a room in the Mage Tower, dragging the Mage Tower into darkness.

Even the entire valley fell into darkness.

The sleeping Hydra looked up at this scene and let out an excited hiss.

Nikola, who was still digesting a large number of half-step fifth-circle dead people on the battlefield, opened his eyes and looked at the shadow with a happy smile.

Then, he flew out and began to guard the valley.

And this protection lasted for half a year.

On this day, the shadow of the valley slowly began to dissipate, and the Tower slowly reappeared in space. The shadow flowed into the Tower.

After a few minutes, Eli walked out.

Looking at the green environment outside the door, Eli smiled.

“I have broken through to the half-step five-ring!”

Eli was overjoyed.

His consciousness sank into the celestial Great Sun. At the core of the celestial Great Sun, a pitch-black shadow stopped like a seed, but it gave off a devouring power, and small vortexes appeared around it.

“This is my Law.” Eli smiled.

At this moment, he felt that he was unprecedentedly powerful.

The initial mastery of the law made him feel better than ever. First of all, the quality and power of the shadow had almost made a certain leap, almost five times more than before.

There was also the devouring power. His shadow power had a certain devouring power. Compared to ordinary shadows, this was a domineering and tyrannical power.

Moreover, with the shadow of the devouring power, as long as he came into contact with the opponent, Eli could devour their power to replenish himself.

It was very strong.

Of course, the exact strength needed to be tested.

“Next, I’ll continue to comprehend the rules and then look for an opportunity to advance to the fifth circle.”

Eli took a deep breath, his gaze unprecedentedly determined.

It seemed calm and peaceful, but he felt a sense of danger. The war at Green Field would drag on for, at most, a few decades. By then, the Warlock Union would definitely find out. If they attacked him, he would not have the strength to protect himself.

“Stronger. I can only guarantee my safety if I am at the fifth circle.”

Eli muttered to himself before returning to the tower.

Nikola and Hydra, who had just sensed it, looked at each other in silence.

“The lord really doesn’t relax for a moment!” The corner of Nikola’s mouth twitched.

He wanted to congratulate him!

“However, it’s normal. After all, the lord hasn’t broken through to the fifth circle.” Nikola also sighed. Eli was still under the fifth circle, so no matter the advancement, he was stuck at the same level.

Bang!

He turned around and was about to leave when the door opened again.

At this moment, Eli’s face was filled with shock, and his muscles were tense.

“Sir, what happened?” Nikola was stunned. Eli didn’t even have such a reaction when he came out earlier.

“A great issue!”

Eli sighed and even started to get a little nervous.
