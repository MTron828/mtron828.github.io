535 The End, the Reaction of All Sides

Roar!

After Eli left, the Phoenix reappeared in the distance. Hydra, who had been at the edge of the battlefield, also let out a cry and released its aura.

Looking at the combat strength of the two fifth-circle creatures, the rest of the celestials had ugly expressions on their faces.

No wonder Eli left just like that. So his subordinates were still here!

As for them…At this moment, they were all below the fifth circle, so how could they stop them? VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“It’s over!”

The celestials gave up resisting and raised their hands in surrender.

On the ground, the Warlocks of the Warlock Alliance also lowered their heads. Although they had been resurrected, the bloodline power in their bodies was almost exhausted.

It was definitely on purpose!

Sigh!

The Warlocks surrendered one by one. They had no desire to fight.

It was over!

..

On the other side.

Eli stopped after flying for 10,000 meters.

His body recovered!

Puff!

Eli instantly felt uncomfortable.

At this moment, his face was pale, and his mental power and bloodline were almost exhausted. Even the tree of laws had temporarily fallen into a dispirited state.

“I overestimated myself. Resurrecting them is my limit. Also, if I didn’t burn a large number of bloodlines, I probably wouldn’t have been able to do this.” The corner of Eli’s mouth twitched.

Time Backtrack was very powerful, but the range this time was too large!

He had almost been exposed in front of everyone, so he had run away quickly to prevent his image from being ruined.

He wasn’t injured in the fight, but in the end, he was injured in posturing.

“I’ll definitely be careful next time.” Shaking his head, Eli determined the direction and returned to the Grassi Land.

Soon, he returned to his lair and entered the Time World Fragment.

He was injured, and this made him feel a sense of danger!

He had to recover quickly.

..

Half a day later!

Phoenix and Hydra had returned.

From the two of them, he knew that everything was going smoothly. All the Warlocks had been captured, and the celestials had been dealt with. This made Eli heave a sigh of relief.

Fortunately, there were no accidents.

Then, he sent a letter to Alida and arranged the next matters. Then, he plunged into the time world fragment again and continued to recover from his injuries!

At this moment.

The Wizard Tower of the City of Bloodlines.

At this moment, Alida looked at the battle report in front of her in shock!

“Fake,” She looked confused.

Looking at the battle report, The Lord had descended, fought with the fifth circle, and revived a million Warlocks… Everything that happened was so illogical, but it was true.

“How ridiculous!”

She sighed and shook her head, then looked back.

After seeing that there were still millions of Warlocks, as well as the final war matters and the matters that needed to be dealt with after the war, all the shock was thrown to the back of her mind. She only felt that the future was dark!

The sorrow of happiness!

This was the first time that Alida felt it!

In a room not far away from her, Jin Ji revealed a smile.

Looking out the window, he felt that the future was bright!

He believed they had the opportunity to charge to a higher realm!

..

Eastern Region!

Sea Dragon Clan Master and Sea Shark Clan looked at each other.

” I admit that I’m inexperienced. Who would have thought that Eli’s strength would reach such a level? How high is his true strength?!” The head of the Sea Dragon Clan let out a long sigh of confusion.

“Yeah, he hid it too deeply!” Patriarch Sea Shark nodded.

This time, the strength that Eli had displayed in the battle was too terrifying.

He was not a Thousand Leaves Warlock, but he fought more than ten fifth-circle warlocks alone.

Even at this moment, they had deep doubts about Eli being Thousand Leaves warlock. Was their guess really correct? Could this be the true strength of this person?

“Yes, I wouldn’t be surprised if you said he was Thousand Flowers now!” The Sea Dragon Clan’s head curled his lips.

“Ha, your scale is too small!” Patriarch Sea Shark snorted.

The head of the Sea Dragon Clan was speechless.

Shaking his head, he changed the topic and said, “Speaking of which, since Sir Eli has already defeated the enemy in the main army, it’s time for us to counterattack, right?”

Patriarch Sea Shark’s eyes lit up.

” F * ck!” he shouted as he sat across the table. “That’s right! After being bullied for so long, it’s time for our Bloodline Alliance to counterattack the Warlock Alliance. It’s time for the old man to step down from his position!”

“Counterattack!”

The two of them nodded, and the light in their eyes became brighter and brighter.

..

The Central Region.

Golden Cicada Merchant Association.

” How is this possible? How is this possible?” Golden Cicada looked at the information in front of him in a daze, feeling his brain go black.

How could he lose?

“I don’t understand!” he muttered. For the first time, he felt that he had made the wrong choice.

“The Warlock Alliance is in a bad situation. After this war, the Bloodline Alliance will be on the same level as the Warlock Alliance. With the Lich Tower, this is the most critical time for the Warlock Alliance!”

He began to feel worried for the Warlock Alliance!

As the Chamber of Commerce with the Warlock Alliance backing him, he had never been worried about this problem. After all, the Warlock Alliance had stood for thousands of years. How could it possibly fall back? But this time, he really felt that it might be gone!

“Jin Ji.”

He suddenly thought of the successor he had once thought highly of.

He took a long breath and sighed,

“I was wrong this time!”

..

“Everyone, we were wrong this time!”

In Heaven City, the patriarch of Press seemed to have aged a few thousand years overnight. His eyes were dull and lifeless.

Below him, the heads of the other families remained silent.

Without a doubt, their plan had failed!

And if he failed, he would naturally have to bear the consequences of failure!

“The Bloodline Tower’s army has already entered the central region, and most of the western region has been controlled. The southern and eastern regions are also counterattacking quickly. The two regions have almost fallen into the hands of several forces, and they are still counterattacking.

“Everyone, this time, the Warlock Alliance is truly on the brink of death!” At this moment, the silent Yun Ge clan head spoke in a low voice.

“Eli.” Patriarch Dylo clenched his fists tightly.

Everything was caused by this person!

Hearing this name, everyone’s expression changed.

Everyone’s eyes were once filled with disdain, but now, they were filled with a hint of fear and a hint of mystery.

They were afraid of Eli’s power and future. They could not see through him at all.

At this moment, they had completely placed him in a position that was even higher than theirs!

“Actually, we don’t need to worry too much. Even if our attack this time fails, our strength still surpasses the Bloodline Alliance.” Press said slowly with his dry lips.

These words seemed to have instilled a lot of power into the Warlocks present, and their expressions became a little better.

However, at this moment, the Sela family in the corner suddenly let out a cry, and then their faces revealed an extremely terrified expression.

He looked terrified and even panicked. “Something bad has happened.

“The Lich King of the Northern Region had sacrificed a million souls to destroy the Western Region. Our clan elders were completely wiped out, and only a few Warlocks managed to escape. At this moment, the Northern Region had been completely occupied by the Liches, and they had already set off for the Central Region!”

Crack!

The atmosphere instantly turned deathly silent, and the Warlocks present was instantly rendered speechless.

Tears and snot flowed down the face of Patriarch Press as he looked up at the sky and lamented, “Is it really the Heaven that wants to destroy the Warlock Alliance?”
