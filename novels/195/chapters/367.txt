368 Conversation with Glen

Bloodline City.

In the tallest mage tower.

In the morning, the sun rose, and the slightly dazzling sunlight shone into a room in the tower, making everything seem relaxed and comfortable.

Eli stood by the window and looked outside.

Outside the window, Bloodline City was in a mess. Even the thousand-year-old city walls were broken. Many Warlocks were walking around, repairing the damaged city.

It was the second day since Eli arrived at Bloodline City.

After yesterday’s victory, Eli had been arranged to stay here by Glen.

” From yesterday until today, this new faith imprint has allowed me to feel the rapid growth of my celestial Power. ” Eli looked down at the new mark of faith.

Since yesterday, he had been able to feel the power of faith from the Warlocks in this city. Last night, his celestial Power had increased by one unit. It was 203 before, and now it was 204.

” It seems like I made the right choice to come here. However, I have to settle all the troubles first before I can start on other matters. ” Ely stretched his body and felt a sense of relief.

Suddenly, there was a knock on the door.

Eli walked over and opened the door.

” Sir Eli, Grandfather has settled the matter and is waiting for you in the meeting room. ” Alida lowered her head and said respectfully.

“Got it.” Eli nodded.

“Sir, this is your first time here, and you are not familiar with the terrain. Let me lead the way for you. Sir Eli, do you need to prepare?” asked Alida.

“No need.”

Shaking his head, Eli walked out with Alida leading the way.

Alida led the way without saying a word, while Eli took the opportunity to observe the area.

In terms of strength, the main tower was not much different from the west coast’s sub-towers. However, such strength could only be considered at the bottom of the Central Mainland. However, it was understandable. After all, this was the Central Mainland, the former center of the world.

Along the way, there were people who looked at Eli from time to time. It was obvious that they recognized Eli, and some even wanted to get close to him.

Fortunately, some guards noticed the commotion and rushed over to escort Eli.

Under the respectful gazes of the guards, Eli was sent to his destination.

There was a tall mage tower with two guards guarding the door.

” Sir Eli, thank you for everything you’ve done for the Bloodline Tower. ” Before they parted, the guard bowed deeply to Eli.

Eli nodded.

“Sir, this is the place. Grandfather is waiting for you on the third floor.” After the guard left, Alida said to Eli.

“Alright.” Eli nodded, and the guards in front of him had already opened the door for him.

Eli walked in, and Alida’s sincere and loud voice came from behind. “Thank you, sir.”

Eli smiled and walked up to the third floor without turning back.

There was only one room on the third floor. The door was open, and the decoration was simple and warm. There was only one person inside at the moment, and it was Glen. He seemed to be a little weak at the moment, and his eyes were lifeless as he sat on a sofa. There was a bandage on his chest.

” Sir Eli, I’m sorry. My injuries are a little serious. I hope you don’t mind. ” Glen said to Eli and coughed twice.

“It’s a small problem.” Eli didn’t mind and sat opposite Glen.

He was also very curious about what Glen wanted to talk to him about.

There were two cups of tea on the table. Eli naturally picked up one and took a sip. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Glen looked at him and suddenly said, ” Sir, I wonder if you’re interested in becoming the Bloodline Tower’s Tower Master! ”

Cough, cough, cough!

Eli choked, and after a second, he looked at Glen with a strange expression. “What did you say?”

” Sir, you didn’t hear wrongly. ” Glen was very free and easy. He looked at Ely and said, “I thought that the Bloodline Tower had fallen in my hands. Who would have thought that your arrival would save us?

“However, I had already been severely injured in the battle with Vya, so I probably wouldn’t be alive for long. However, the Bloodline Tower still had to continue moving forward, but now that the Bloodline Tower didn’t have a second celestial, I had no other choice.

“I hope you can fulfill my request.”

Eli had a strange look on his face.

He observed Glen and realized that this old man really didn’t have much life left. He could only live for ten years at most.

However, to become a tower Master on the second day after coming to the main tower, this progress was a little too fast.

Eli was actually not very interested in the position. He still hoped to be like before, enjoying the power of control over the organization, but he did not need to bear the burden of those miscellaneous things. It was a waste of Eli’s time.

After coughing twice, Eli replied, “Actually, I came to the Central Mainland this time in the hope of seeking more development. I won’t leave the Bloodline Tower for the time being, but I’ll leave this Bloodline Tower to you for the time being. I’ll let my deputy Oscar familiarize himself with it. ”

Eli’s meaning was also very clear. He intended to stay but was still not prepared to be the tower Master.

However, this was enough for Glen. The confirmation that Eli would stay in the Bloodline Tower was enough to surprise him.

” Since you don’t want to be the master of the Bloodline Tower, I wonder if you can accept the position of Honorary Master. Of course, it doesn’t matter if you don’t accept it. Anyway, I’ll hand over everything in the Bloodline Tower to you. ” Glen, an old man who didn’t have much time left, was very lenient toward Ely.

“Sure.” This time, Eli didn’t refuse.

After all, the Bloodline Tower would be in his hands sooner or later, so he wouldn’t refuse the position of Honorary Tower Master, who enjoyed the power of the tower master but didn’t have to bear any responsibility.

” Thank you, my lord. Cough, cough, cough! ” Glen lowered his head and coughed a few more times.

Eli was a little emotional.

He was the one who wanted to take Glen’s Bloodline Tower, but Glen wanted to thank him. This world was sometimes very strange.

Eli was filled with emotions. If he had come here as soon as he had advanced, he definitely would not have been treated like this. It seemed like he had made the right choice to stay on the West Coast and develop in silence.

...

“Since my lord has accepted it, then I’ll introduce the Bloodline Tower to my lord.” Glen looked at Eli.

Eli nodded.

Soon, Eli had a general understanding of the Bloodline Tower.

Although the Bloodline Tower’s main tower was a small power in the central continent, it was already as large as the West Coast. Moreover, it had several other territories outside of the Bloodline Tower, and its population was much larger than the West Coast. It had at least 10,000,000 people, twice as many as the West Coast.

Next was their strength. There were about a hundred people with the third circle, three to four hundred people with the second circle, and even more people with the first circle and acolytes.

They were slightly weaker than the Bloodline Towers, but it made sense. On the west coast, resources were exclusive to the Bloodline Towers. Moreover, with Eli around, the Bloodline Towers had some potions that could help them advance, so they had a lot of resources.

However, the Bloodline Towers in the Central Continent weren’t in such a good situation. For example, a Grassi land had almost caused a massacre.

The last reason was that the Bloodline Tower was temporarily attached to a force called the Amina Family. This time, it was because of their indifference that led to the tragedy of the Bloodline Tower. However, after Wellington’s death, Eli searched for some information and knew that they had actually made a deal with the manticore.

Eli also told Glen about it.

Glen spat out a mouthful of blood and cursed angrily, “I have to contribute a lot of resources to them every year. When something happens, they turn around and sell us out.”

“Calm down.” Eli looked at Glen’s condition and was a little worried. Just these few mouthfuls of blood would probably reduce his life by a few more days.

...

“I’m fine. I have to thank you for telling me this.” Glen clutched his chest, but there was a helpless look on his face.

The Amina Family was a force on the same level as the manticore, perhaps even slightly stronger. Even if he knew about the backstab, he could not do anything.

He looked at Eli. If there were anyone who could change everything, it would be Eli.

To be able to kill Jalin so easily, even though he didn’t know Ely’s exact strength, he was definitely very strong.

In the Central Mainland, strength was the foundation of a faction. With Sir Eli around, the Amina Family might make some changes in the future.

” Since you have accepted the position of Honorary Tower Master, we need to hold a banquet. It will be held after the reconstruction of Bloodline City is completed. However, I will spread this news first. Don’t worry, sir. It was approved in the meeting today. ” Glen said again.

“Sure.” Eli nodded and asked, “Oh right, what exactly is the Grassi Land? Why is the manticore so interested?”

Eli also knew about the Grassi Land and Glen was a little surprised.

“Grassi Land?” Glen blinked and said, ” The Grassi Land is behind Bloodline City. If you are interested, I can take you there now. ”

“Alright.” Eli nodded.

Glen stood up, one hand covering his chest as he reached out toward the door.

“Sir, please.”

“Why don’t we do it another day? Your wound seems to be bleeding again.” Eli saw that Glen’s bandage was stained with blood.

“Milord’s matter is more important.” Glen shook his head. “I’m fine. It’s just a minor injury.”

Eli nodded worriedly, and the two of them walked out.
