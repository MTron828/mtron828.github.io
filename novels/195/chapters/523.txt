524 Shocking Alliance

“The Phoenix King was subdued just like that? How is that possible?”

“You must be joking. What was that terrifying will just now? Why do I feel like I’m facing the world directly? And that The Phoenix King is also instantly suppressed!”

“Wait, suppressed? Wasn’t that the legendary World Will?”

In Bloodline City, everyone looked at Eli in the sky in shock and confusion as the golden specks of light disappeared.

Who would have thought that this would happen?

Whether it was the will just now or the suppression of The Phoenix King, it had left a deep impression on them, and they had a new understanding of Eli’s methods.

Was this a f * cking normal method?

How could anyone summon the current World Will?

Ever since thousands of years ago, wasn’t it very difficult to awaken the World Will? Why are you out again today?

At this moment, the Sea Dragon Clan’s Clan Head was also shocked.

“Is it the World Will?” He said these words in a daze.

“World Will? How can he summon the world’s will? Could it be that the world’s will awakened decades ago…” Patriarch Sea Shark couldn’t care less about his injuries.

At this moment, the two of them looked at each other and saw the shock in each other’s eyes.

The mouth of the Wind God Yaolong clan’s head twitched.

Why are you two standing there?

Hey, hey, hey!

Everyone was paying attention to the world’s will, but did no one notice how powerful Eli was?

That was The Phoenix King at the Divine Tree stage!

A divine tree!

It could easily kill us!

“Come on, didn’t you guys not notice Eli’s strength?” In the end, he couldn’t help but remind them.

The two of them turned their heads at the same time and looked at him strangely. “What’s so strange about that? It’s said that Eli is a Thousand Leaves Warlock. It’s normal for him to be able to defeat the divine tree.” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

He was speechless.

However, this attack allowed the three of them to finally confirm Eli’s strength. They were instantly more at ease. Even if they were injured now, they only felt that their future was bright!

While they were still immersed in hope for the future, Eli’s voice pulled them back to reality again!

“Everyone from the Warlock Union…”

Someone from the Warlock Union?

They raised their heads and looked at the sky. They saw three figures appear in the sky in the distance.

The three of them, two men and one woman, looked to be middle-aged, but the aura they emitted had reached the Thousand Leaves Realm, and the two behind them were also divine trees!

Judging from the robe, Warlock Thousand Leaves should be a Warlock from the Press family. The two people behind him belonged to the Yunge family and the Dylo family!

At this moment, the three of them looked at Eli with furrowed brows and disbelief in their eyes!

..

“Looks like you guys were the ones pulling the World Fragment.”

Eli looked at the three of them calmly, but his Mercury Blade was ready to be activated at any moment.

Compared to the alien races, these humans were much more ferocious.

“Eli, you’re very powerful. You can actually contact the world’s will. This time, our judgment was wrong.” The Press Clan’s Thousand Leaves Warlock looked at Eli, his brows gradually relaxing.

The plan had undoubtedly failed.

However, they could not be blamed for the current situation. Who would have thought that Eli would summon the world’s will and directly suppress The Phoenix King from the peak of Thousand Leaves to the Divine Tree? It was simply out of the picture!

“However, we’re on the same level. It’s impossible for you to keep us here. I can pretend that today’s matter never happened.” Thousand Leaves Warlock continued.

“Leave?”

Eli was shocked.

You’re going to kill me, yet you want to leave right in front of me.

Was the Warlock Union that arrogant?

Alright, it really suited their style.

“Sorry, you have to stay here today!” Eli shook his head and expressed his opinion.

“Good!”

The Thousand Leaves Warlock raised an eyebrow, but his bloodline was activated.

His muscles began to turn white, and white wings spread out behind him. There were a total of nine pairs, and a scorching aura was emitted from his body. His body grew to five meters tall!

Six-ringed bloodline, Blazing Angel bloodline!

“Eli, you can’t keep us here!” He looked at Eli and released his aura.

” His bloodline is very strong. He’s probably just entered the Thousand Leaves Realm, but I’ve accumulated more. I can defeat him, but there’s a certain risk. There’s about an 85% chance of victory. There’s a lot of danger!” Eli evaluated this person and was a little shocked.

The risk factor was too high!

So…

In the next second, the silver-white eye in Eli’s eyes bloomed. Round after round of silver-white light bloomed, and a silver blade that seemed to not exist in the world slowly drilled out of one of the eyes.

Its entire body was silver-white, and silver-white spiritual power flowed around him. Moreover, it did not emit any aura, as if it should not exist.

Pa!

Suddenly, a hand grabbed the sharp blade.

Holding the Mercury Blade, Eli looked at the Warlock.

“This is?!” The Warlock frowned.

Although the knife-like blade in front of him did not look oppressive, he did not dare to underestimate it. After all, the opponent was Eli, their core enemy.

Weng!

In the next second, Eli waved his sharp blade gently.

Instantly, the silver-white blade rippled, and an extremely sharp mental force condensed at the tip, then instantly disappeared from the Warlock’s eyes.

“No more…Where did it go? It hurts!” The Warlock was confused for a moment, and then he felt a sharp pain.

He looked down and saw that the sharp blade had already pierced into his heart. The power that erupted from it had actually reached the level of ten thousand flowers. It instantly killed all the tissues in his body and then attacked his mind.

Bang!

The Warlock’s vision turned dark. He knew that his consciousness had been cut into countless pieces.

Before he died, he looked at Eli from the corner of his eyes.

“What kind of method is this?” he said hoarsely. His eyes were filled with desolation as if he still could not accept that he had fallen like this.

“Mercury Blade!”

Eli replied.

In the next second, the light in the Warlock’s eyes suddenly disappeared. His bloodline transformation also gradually disappeared. His life force aura dissipated bit by bit, and then he fell to the ground.

All of this happened in less than a second.

At this moment, the others were still watching the two of them confront each other, but in the next second, the Press Family warlock died.

At this moment, everyone on the ground was also dumbfounded when they saw this change.

“Isn’t that a Thousand Leaves Warlock? He died just like that?”

“Are you kidding me?”

” Ah, Lord Eli’s strength is actually at this level? That was too ridiculous. They were at the same level. Could he be a genius?”

Everyone discussed.

The aura of that person was not weaker than Eli’s, which meant that he was on the same level as the Lord. However, it was really ridiculous that he died just like that.

“In the future, I will only follow Your Excellency’s lead!” The Sea Dragon Clan’s head’s mouth twitched, and he forced out this sentence after a long time.

“Me too!”

“Me too.”

The other two nodded.

The damage caused by today’s incident was limited, but it had completely displayed Eli’s power in front of the Warlock Alliance. It was likely that the Warlock Alliance had done a good deed with bad intentions, helping them strengthen the cohesion of the Warlock Alliance.

After today, the Bloodline Alliance’s trust in Eli would reach its peak.

What a coincidence!

“Dead?”

At this moment, the remaining two people in the sky felt their hearts tremble!

That was the Thousand Leaves Warlock of the Press family!

Did he die just like that?

At this moment, Eli turned to look at the two of them and smiled. “Do you two want to have a cup of tea together? I have a lot of good tea leaves here!”

Gulp!

The two of them broke out in cold sweat, and fear gradually spread from their eyes.
