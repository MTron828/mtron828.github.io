219 Everything is Ready

Just as Nikola was talking with Vivika, Eli was looking around for a suitable ambush spot.

“This is the place!”

In mid-air, Eli looked down.

This was a valley surrounded by mountains that extended upwards, leaving only an area of about a few thousand square meters in the center. There was only one entrance, and once a spell formation was set up, it would be difficult to escape.

Other than that, the concentration of elemental energy here was relatively high, and there were very few disturbances. It was very suitable for setting up some spell formations, and it was the most suitable place for an ambush.

After choosing a location, Eli slowly descended, took out a large number of materials, and started setting up a spell formation. During this process, the magical beasts in the valley would often come and disturb him.

Facing these creatures, Eli simply dispersed them and didn’t kill them, mainly because he was worried that Kloss would find out that something was wrong. He had to be careful when ambushing a third-circle warlock.

The choice of spell formation was of utmost importance as well. He had to be careful. Eli mainly chose a water element spell formation because Kloss’ bloodline was a fire elemental creature, a fire elemental elf bloodline that was similar to Vivika’s. It was a three-circle high-grade bloodline and had extremely powerful explosive power.

As for the number, Eli had only set up around a hundred of them. In short, in order to ambush Kloss, he had put in a lot of effort. Every spell formation was valuable, and they were at least of the second circle level. Once they entered, even Kloss would have a problem for a long time.

When everything was ready, Nikola finally returned.

“It’s finally over!” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Nikola saw the valley from far away and quickly flew over.

This operation was quite dangerous. After all, if he was discovered or Vivika didn’t agree to the Alliance, he might be surrounded. Even if he was a third-circle warlock, he might not be able to win.

“This must be the battlefield chosen by my Lord. It’s not too far from the bloodline tower, so it’s quite suitable.”

Nikola’s knowledge was not low, and he felt that this place was indeed very suitable for an ambush.

Soon, he arrived at the entrance of the valley and entered directly.

At first, he was very relaxed, but the deeper he went, the more nervous he became.

There were high-intensity Mage spell formations everywhere, and even a rough estimate would place at least a few dozen of them, layer after layer. The energy emitted by them still made Nikola’s heart skip a beat.

Just how many spell formations did his master prepare?

Just like that, Nikola finally saw Eli while he was in a state of panic.

“My Lord, everything went well. Vivika has agreed, and I have given her the crystal ball!” Nikola felt much more at ease when he saw Eli, and he came to his side to report.

Eli nodded, indicating that he understood.

“My Lord, isn’t it a little too much to have so many spell formations? your combat power isn’t any lower than Kloss!” Nicola looked around and could not help but ask.

“Ah, Nikola, your ideological awareness is not good!” Eli turned his head and said with a serious expression, “Kloss is a middle-stage third-circle, and I’m only an early-stage third-circle, so of course, I have to be more cautious.”

“But …” Nikola really wanted to complain, ‘But your power level is easily beyond the middle stage of third-circle.’

“It should be very easy for Master to fight those above his level.” He couldn’t help but mutter.

“Wrong again.”

Nikola looked up and saw Eli looking at him with a serious face. “Don’t try to fight above your level. It’s good if you succeed, but generally speaking, the risk is too high. So, the best thing is to bully the weak!”

Bullying the weak?

For the first time in thousands of years, Nikola heard someone regard this as a virtue. For a moment, he felt a little sluggish, and after more than ten seconds, he said with difficulty, “My Lord … What a creative idea!”

“Of course. Nikola, remember, you are also an undead, and your lifespan is much longer than that of ordinary humans. In the future, be smart. If you meet someone of a lower level, you can fight them, but if you meet someone of a higher level, you can run away. You can come back and beat him up when you are stronger than him.” Eli said.

These were all his life experiences in the past years and were also his basic principles in doing things. They saved him a lot of trouble.

“Yes, yes, I understand, my Lord.” Nikola nodded with difficulty. Although his lordship’s reasoning sounded a little strange, it seemed to make sense.

“Forget it. Let’s not talk about it. I’ll curse Kloss first and then detonate it during the battle!”

Before Nikola could react, he saw Eli reach out and stuff his hand into his body. He then took out a wisp of Kloss’ aura and ran to another part of the valley to start the curse.

“A darkness that is deeper than darkness, a strangeness that is more violent than poison … Today, I, Eli Lucifer, will use 2000 years of my life as the price to curse Kloss …”

Nikola watched as Eli ran a few dozen meters away and started cursing. Although he didn’t know what price he had paid, Nikola closed his eyes and began to mourn for Kloss when he saw the large amount of dark and strange aura surrounding Eli.

Why did Kloss choose to leave a brand on Nikola? He did this to himself.

..

Three days passed in the blink of an eye.

Eli’s setup had already been completed, and the spell formation had been hidden. The location of the valley had also been told to Vivika through the crystal ball.

What puzzled Eli was that this black Isotta had surrounded the bloodline tower for so many days. Why wasn’t it attacking yet? but fortunately, he was very patient. In at most a month, a battle would definitely break out.

As he had expected, ten days later.

On this day, while Eli was still hiding in the hidden mountain he had set up in the valley, he saw Nikola return in a hurry.

“Sir, it’s starting!”

Was it finally starting?

A delighted smile appeared on Eli’s face, and he said to Nikola, “It’s up to Vivika now!”

“Yes!”

In the hidden space, a man and an undead waited silently.

..

At the same time.

The war had already broken out.

The outermost area of the bloodline tower was a plain. At this moment, a battle was happening on this plain. The two parties involved in this battle were the black Isotta and the bloodline tower.

...

Wails, elemental explosions, sounds of weapons clashing, and roars were all mixed together. Thousands of warlocks were fighting fiercely, and people died every second.

The two sides of the battle were all warlocks, most of them apprentices. There were hundreds of first-circle warlocks and only a few dozen second-circle warlocks.

Although it was a war, there were still basic rules. It was basically an apprentice fighting an apprentice. The first circle fought the first circle, and the second circle fought the second circle. Even so, the aftermath of the fights between the first and second-circle mages had killed countless apprentices.

The battle was a one-sided one. The bloodline tower was a major force, but in general, the black isotta had the upper hand. After all, the bloodline Tower had suffered heavy losses over the years.

At this time, on the ten-meter wall that was temporarily built outside the bloodline tower, many high-level members of the bloodline tower looked nervous. They kept looking at Vivika, who was at the front.

Today, Vivika was wearing sky-blue leather armor and a cloak. She was holding a crystal staff inlaid with huge gems in her right hand and standing straight in the front.

It was clear to everyone that when there was no huge gap between the strength of both sides, the outcome of the war was still decided by the high-end combat power, and this time was no exception.

Everyone was waiting for the battle between Vivika and Kloss!

“Ah, Kloss’ combat power is much higher than the tower master’s. What should we do?”

“Does the heavens want to destroy the bloodline tower?”

Although the battle had not begun, many of the higher-ups were already in despair. Even they did not think that Vivika could win against Kloss.

...

“the valley ten kilometers away? ”

At this time, Vivika was holding her staff and looking at the battlefield, but her mind was thinking about the ambush. In fact, she still didn’t quite trust Nikola, but she seemed to have no other choice.

Kloss was very strong, and she had fought with him before, but she could only barely contend with him. There were a few times when she was almost killed by Kloss, and she had to rely on the speed of her wind elemental elf bloodline to escape.

She could still run today, but once she did, the bloodline tower would definitely be destroyed. Where could she run to? besides, she might not be able to escape this time. Kloss would not let her go!

Thinking of this, Vivika sighed.

Bang! Bang!

Suddenly, at the edge of the battlefield, a huge cloud of fire exploded, and dozens of warlocks were killed in an instant, which also caught the attention of Vivika.

She looked up and saw a tall man floating in the air above the fire cloud. He looked at her with a fake smile, revealing his white teeth.

“Kloss!”

Vivika’s eyes gradually became serious, knowing that she should make a move.
