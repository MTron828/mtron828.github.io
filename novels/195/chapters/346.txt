347 Understanding

Rawl city!

In a spacious room, the burning candles on the walls illuminated the entire room. However, the ground in the center became dark again due to the influence of the force fields of the six people.

At this moment, a few of them had their eyes closed.

Suddenly, one of them opened her eyes. It was a beautiful woman with black and purple seductive patterns on one side of her face. She was only wrapped in a few pieces of cloth.

She opened her eyes, and a trace of doubt flashed across her eyes.

Her change was also noticed by the others, and they all opened their eyes to look at her.

A dark-skinned Warlock looked at her and asked, “Lefay, what happened?”

Lefay didn’t hide anything and looked directly at the few people in the dark. “Did you guys feel like you were being spied on just now?”

“Spy?”

“How is this possible? It’s impossible for anyone to enter this place with our power unless they are fifth circle or above.

“But how could there be a fifth ring spying on us here?”

“Indeed. If the fifth circle warlocks had intervened in the Western Region, it wouldn’t be like this. Those old guys should be either sleeping or in the nearby world fragments. Otherwise, their lifespans would be depleted!”

Everyone chimed in and denied the woman’s idea.

Furthermore, they were confident that no one could easily spy on them.

“Alright, it seems like I’m overthinking it!” The woman named Lefay nodded, but her doubts did not disappear.

“Everyone, let’s conserve our energy. There’s still a huge battle to come!” A Warlock suddenly suggested.

“Ha, we have six half-step celestial here. What accident can there be? Once this fish, Eli, enters, we can easily draw in the net and eat the fish.”

“We’re all halfway to the fifth circle. He’s very strong, but we don’t stand a chance against him if we join forces!

“Indeed!”

The crowd instantly burst into laughter, and their eyes showed pity for Eli!

‘Can’t you just stay in the North? Why did he have to provoke the heart of the abyss?

‘I wonder if he’s stupid.’

..

The bloodline tower’s war chariots were gradually advancing in the heart of the abyss!

In the Grassi land.

Eli sat on the grass and sniffed at the floral fragrance in the distance. Hill was behind him, and two tiny tree branches stretched down to massage his temples. It was a pleasant experience!

It was so comfortable.

As he enjoyed the massage, he turned to Hill and asked, “Hill, how did you learn these things? ”

“I learned it when I saw the people in the city outside. I thought that I could do it to my father after I learned it.” A chuckling voice came from behind him, like a little girl.

Hearing the way Hill addressed him, Eli smiled and slowly got up.

Looking at Hill in front of him, Eli was filled with emotions.

Ever since they had taken in the elven race, the elven race had no lack of cultivation methods for the magical trees and some related resources.

Hill had benefited a lot from this. Although she had not broken through yet, she was getting closer and closer to the fourth circle. She was now the equivalent of a 13-14-year-old girl.

“Hurry up and break through to the fourth circle. When the time comes, I can’t do it without you!” Eli looked forward to it.

The source of life that Hill could convert was enough for her to break through to the fourth circle, but not higher. Plus, she was a special being.

That was why Eli was also constantly paying attention to Hill.

As long as she broke through, it would be a great thing for both her and Eli.

“Hill will work hard!” A crisp voice rang out.

Eli nodded, then walked towards the laboratory.

The war was one thing, but his experiments had never stopped.

He was still at the peak of the radiant sun. Although he had relied on his experiments to break through and reach the peak of four rings in terms of combat strength, there was no telling where life would take him. Hence, Eli had to break through to half-step fifth circle as soon as possible and gain an initial understanding of the laws.

This was a long-term strategy!

A few minutes later, Eli arrived at the laboratory.

Although most of the laboratories had been moved out, the main laboratory was still under Eli’s watch, mainly because he was worried about losing it.

He opened the door of the laboratory and looked at the vacuum equipment in the distance. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Compared to a few decades ago, the black fog surrounding the shadow core was obviously thinner. One corner of the black fog was so thin that it was about to disappear, and the core could be seen directly!

“Decades of extraction have finally paid off. I should be able to completely extract the black today. This will be a turning point in my observation.”

Eli revealed his white teeth, walked to the experiment table, and started to operate.

As the device was turned on, a large amount of energy gathered on both sides and an elemental ray toward the shadow core and then peeled off a black fog.

“Ten more times, and it’ll be enough!” Eli made a judgment.

After the device cooled down for a while, it was turned on again.

Whoosh!

Whoosh!

..

...

Magic stones were used for experiments, but at this moment, Eli did not consider the problem of money at all. He only kept repeating the experiment, and the black mist was also being peeled off bit by bit!

Finally, after the last separation, a corner of the mysterious black mist completely disappeared! A gap had appeared in the layer of the black mist.

Darkness entered Eli’s eyes!

The shadow core that had completely shed its disguise was reflected in Eli’s eyes.

Eli’s throat moved slightly, and he was extremely excited.

Even if it was just a glance, he could feel that his understanding of the shadow had deepened. This was completely different from how he had been studying the shadow elements earlier.

Cool!

In such an environment, perhaps the day that Eli broke through to the half-step five-circle stage would come faster than he had imagined.

Eli was mesmerized. However, the next moment, he discovered that the black fog was slowly spreading back toward the gap.

How could this be?

Eli attacked immediately, his elements surging, but it was useless against the black mist. He used his bloodline as well, but it was useless. The gap was getting smaller and smaller, but there was no time to hesitate. Eli used the power of faith directly, and this was his final choice.

...

The golden power of faith quickly gathered toward the gap and blocked the black mist from spreading.

Eli’s eyes lit up, but looking at the shrinking gap, he gritted his teeth. The imprint of faith on his arm flickered, and he spread it up to strengthen the barrier!

At this moment, Eli couldn’t care less about his consumption. His power of faith poured out like a Great River!

In the end, it took two marks to stabilize the gap.

At this point, the power of faith on Eli’s body was now empty, without a single drop left.

However, looking at the gap that was only the size of a ping pong ball, Eli felt like crying.

“but it’s okay. This little bit is enough for me. It’s so small and cute!” Eli consoled himself.

Then, he sat there and began to comprehend the laws of shadow. This made his understanding of the power of shadow rapidly deepen, dozens of times faster than before!

Time always passed very quickly during meditation. A week later, Eli left his meditation feeling like he could have done more.

He might be able to gain an initial understanding of the laws of the shadow in a few years.

He didn’t want to wake up from his mediation but there was a reason.

“Have we already reached Rawl City?”Eli sighed.

The next moment.

He closed his eyes again and focused his consciousness.
