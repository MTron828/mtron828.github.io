233 One Hundred and Fifty Years

Three days later.

Eli returned to the White Tower.

On the day of his return, a meeting was held quietly.

In the meeting.

!!

“from now on, the White Tower will continue to develop steadily. In the future, I’ll establish a deeper connection with the bloodline tower. As for the White Tower, we’ll just develop it in the South of the West Coast!” Eli looked at the crowd and ordered.

“Yes!”

Everyone agreed.

Eli was like a pillar of support to the White Tower. He had saved the White Tower from danger several times and even made decisions to support the bloodline tower when it was in danger. Not only did he save the White Tower from disaster, but he also allowed them to continue existing.

The meeting was over after a few simple instructions from Eli.

After the meeting.

“What are your plans, Sir?” Ross asked respectfully.

“I’m naturally going to work next!” Eli cast him a strange glance.

“Work?”

Ross’ old face froze, a little surprised.

..

Very quickly.

The news spread throughout the black Tower prison again. The former Warden Herman had returned.

For a moment, all the warlocks who were still alive when Eli was the warden were trembling with fear. The newcomer had a strange look on his face as he asked, “What’s so special about Herman?”

The elders were all telling the newbies about Herman’s “cruelty.” All of them were terrified, their bodies trembling, and their mouths twitching. “How brutal!”

Eli knew nothing about the prisoner’s sadness. In any case, he returned to the black Tower with a relaxed expression.

This was a good place.

Experiments were indispensable to him. He didn’t even feel good about using ordinary people, but he didn’t have any psychological barriers when it came to the prisoners here. He could do body modification, drug experiments, blood cross-breeding experiments, and so on.

Returning to this place was like returning home.

Just like that, Eli started his regular life again.

He studied and meditated on a daily basis, and he would come out to patrol every ten days to half a month to relax.

Time passed by slowly.

..

Twenty years later.

“Twenty years?” In front of the black Tower’s window, Eli looked out the window, his eyes distant.

Ten years was not a long time for him, but many things had happened.

Although the bloodline tower’s strength had greatly increased after annexing black Isotta, their overall strength had still declined due to the loss of potential in the previous war. This led to a lot of friction, and they lost a lot of territories they had previously occupied.

However, it was normal. Vivika did not do anything out of line. She only maintained the stability of the forces. The White Tower was also stable, and nothing major happened.

On the other hand, Katarina from irises camp was already at the limit of her second circle. She was only 200 years old, so she could be considered a little genius.

“It’s a pity that the lifespan for mages in this world is limited!” Eli shook his head.

For normal mages, it was almost impossible for them to reach the second circle if they were not talented. Therefore, every second circle mage had good basic talent, except for Eli.

Eli’s own talent was average. He had relied on the devouring seal and time to reach his current level. Usually, for someone with his talent, it would be a miracle if he could even reach the first circle, let alone the third circle.

However, Eli didn’t think much of it either. Everything was destined.

In addition to the development between forces, he had also changed a lot.

He advanced according to the previous three paths.

His control of shadow sorcery was more smooth. Elemental sorcery was average, but his proficiency in Wind and Fire elemental sorcery was good. There was also his bloodline. He had dug deeper into the shadow Dragon bloodline, and it was much stronger than before.

It could be said that now that he was facing Kloss again, even if he did not make any preparations, he could still easily defeat and kill Kloss.

The three battle paths were not bad, but on the other hand, the three research directions were completely opposite.

Mechanical alchemy was a completely different path from what he had learned before, and this made it difficult for him. Even the basic runes were slightly different, and he had no choice but to change many of his previous habits.

The creation of machinery was also very troublesome. The main body was metal, and many alloys had to be created by himself. This made him inexplicably need to learn a new technique, forging. For this, he had even built a forging workshop.

However, Eli guessed that after these preparations were done for a long time, the subsequent work would naturally speed up, so he didn’t have any other thoughts. It was only time anyway. As long as he didn’t get stuck, it wasn’t a problem for him.

Mechanical alchemy wasn’t going well, but potioneering wasn’t going well either. Although he had tried his best to collect the 3rd-circle potion formulas, they were very rare.

He could only take it slow and leave everything for the future.

The second was the soul runes and the statue of faith.

This progress was also very slow, and there were not many ideas at the moment. Eli had already asked the irises to send people to study it to see if they could find a more suitable path.

The third was the collection of esoteric information. He did manage to find some, but they were not what Eli wanted.

It could only be said that although 20 years was not a short time, there was not much he could do. After all, there was not much he could do on the west coast.

However, Eli didn’t have any thoughts about leaving this place. Before he advanced to celestial, he was prepared to stay in this ‘barren land’. There were small benefits to a small place, and that was that it was safer and more suitable for him. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“Take it slow, there’s no rush!”

Eli pursed his lips, turned around, and walked down the prison.

...

“I have nothing to do today, so I’ll torture my cellmates!”

..

Another thirty years passed.

Everything was calm, but a person came to the door.

It was Vivika.

In the black Tower, Eli looked at Vivika who had come to visit him. In fact, Vivika would visit him once every few years or more than a decade, but this time she brought different news.

“Teacher, the silver Moon banquet is about to be held. Are you interested?” Vivika was wearing a blue chiffon dress as she looked at Eli.

“Silver Moon banquet? What is that?” There was a puzzled expression on Elie’s face.

“Didn’t I tell you before that the purpose of these forces is to find the ruins? This meeting is held once every 50 years. It is either to exchange clues, to excavate a possible ruin together, or it is a simple grand event.

“The main topic of this meeting is to excavate new ruins, and we’re going to clear out a mage’s territory. However, it’s only territory with a large number of magical beasts, so we’ll gather the third circle warlocks and clear it out. After that, we’ll split the magical beast resources we obtain according to our contribution, and we’ll also decide on the distribution of new resources.

“Teacher, do you want to go? Although it’s dangerous, I’m sure we’ll gain a lot!” Vivika asked.

...

“I don’t think so.” Eli shook his head. Even the group of third-circle warlocks said that it was dangerous, so he decided not to go.

“Uh, teacher, you won’t go? But I heard that there are a lot of resources in the wild!” Vivika blinked.

“I’m not going!” Eli quickly refused and continued, “But if there are magic plants, I can buy them with money. It doesn’t matter if they cost more.”

“Alright then!” Vivika sighed.

In the end, Vivika left after Eli’s stern refusal.

“Let’s hope they’ll be able to gain something.” Eli shook his head.

Spending more magic stones was nothing, as long as he could avoid risks.

..

A year later, the silver Moon banquet would be held as scheduled.

Many third-circle warlocks, including the ones from bloodline tower, participated in the event and began clearing an area.

It was said that at that time, more than a dozen third-ring warlocks joined forces to clear the mountain area, and several third-circle magical beasts jumped out. One of them was even a late-stage third-circle tree demon, which directly killed an early-stage third-circle warlock.

When he received the news, Eli was glad that he didn’t go.

It was a cautious victory.

Some rare plants were indeed found in the remote area. Eli had Vivika pay a high price for some of them, which cost about 100000 magic stones.

Eli’s potion research was able to proceed smoothly.

He began to study the potions that could be used by him when he was the third circle.
