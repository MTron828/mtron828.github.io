Chapter 38: The Awakened Marquis

Translator: Lonelytree

“Let’s go!” At this point, Alex couldn’t be bothered with the etiquette of a noble, and he turned around and walked inside.

Count Gimori looked at the two doctors behind him, then the three of them walked into the room together, and the door closed again.

cough cough cough!

As soon as he entered the room, the first thing he smelled was the pungent smell of herbs, which came from Marquis Alina, who was lying on the bed.

The Marquis was lying on his bed with his eyes closed. His hair was brown, and his face was wrinkled from the years. But even so, he still gave off a faint sense of majesty.

However, the Marquis seemed to be in a terrible situation.

The bulging veins on his arms were bluish-purple in color, and even his lips were dark black. The family members of the Marquises were all around the bed.

Some of them were crying at the foot of the bed, some were standing by the side, watching everything, and some of them had unconcealed excitement on their faces. This made Gimori wonder if he would see something like this when he was on his deathbed.

On the other side, the two doctors brought by count Gimori had already gone up to check.

They gently pried open the Marquis’ eyelids and could see that the Marquis’ eyes were listless. Then the two of them discussed for a while and began to try to treat him.

Half an hour passed.

Count Gimori watched as the two of them busied about. They even used the Count’s blood samples for experiments, but none of them worked.

Alex closed his eyes as he witnessed all of this.

He had seen the same procedure many times, but it was useless.

He suddenly felt that he should not continue like this. Instead of letting the Marquis continue to suffer, it was better to let him die with dignity.

“Forget it!”

In the quiet room, Alex finally spoke.

The two doctors stopped and looked at each other helplessly. After testing, the poison in the Marquis ‘body was very tenacious and could not be removed. It would be fine if the Marquis was a Knight, but unfortunately, he was just an ordinary person.

“I’m sorry, my Lord.” The two of them walked toward count Gimori with their heads lowered.

“I’ll send you off.” Said Alex, dejected.

Count Gimori was hesitating. He put his hand into his pocket as if he was hesitating whether to take out the bottle of potion. He did not know if it would really work.

“I have a bottle of potion here. I got it by chance last year. It might be able to detoxify the poison!” In the end, count Gimori still took out the magic potion.

Alex looked at the bluish-purple liquid in the potion bottle in the Count’s hand and fell silent.

The others also looked at the potion with strange expressions. Could this potion really cure the poison?

“Let’s give it a try.” Count Gimori also knew that this was really outrageous, but he still said it out of curiosity.

“Alright.” Alex nodded after a moment of hesitation.

One last time, just one last time.

The two doctors took a blood sample. The blood was abnormally black. The Count opened the potion and dropped it a little into the blood sample.

It was only a drop, and the bluish-purple medicine entered the reddish-black blood.

A sudden change occurred.

The blood started to turn red, and a layer of black substance appeared on the blood.

“Oh my God!” Alex’s eyes widened.

The others also showed an expression of disbelief.

Alex took a few steps forward and took the blood. He looked at it, and it was a healthy red color. This made his entire body tremble.

“Quick, give it to father!”

Of course, it was impossible to use it so rashly. The medicine had to go through tests and be confirmed to be harmless before it was given to the Marquis.

Everyone looked at the Marquis as if they wanted to see something change. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

A mouthful of black blood slowly flowed out of the Marquis ‘mouth. His fingers, then his limbs, began to tremble. As the blood flowed out, the Marquis slowly opened his eyes.

No one dared to make a sound as they witnessed this.

When the Marquis spoke, Alex was the first to cheer.

...

At the same time, outside the room, Count Monchi was talking to the other counts.

“I’m telling you, the Marquis probably won’t make it. We have to be prepared.”

“Indeed. The mystics and Doctor Robert can’t do anything. It seems like there’s no hope.” One of the counts nodded.

“Teacher, let’s go!” The elegant young man behind the woman said.

The leading woman of the mystics nodded.

With their failure, they had lost all hope of saving the Marquis. After some discussion, they were ready to leave.

However, before they could walk out of the door, they suddenly heard a loud noise behind them.

The Marquis’s door opened, and a man ran out, shouting, “The Marquis is awake, the Marquis is awake.”

Everyone was stunned.

The noisy conference room instantly fell silent.

It only returned to normal after a few seconds.

Count Monchi stood there in a daze as if he couldn’t believe this fact. How was this possible? How could count Gimori possibly have resolved such a terrifying poison?

The previously confident Robert also frowned and asked, “Are my two students that powerful?”

The mystics also stopped, wanting to know the specific information.

Such a complicated poison could actually be cured. The healer knew how to deal with the complications between different poisons.

For a moment, everyone in the room, from the Earl to the doctor, had their own thoughts and questions.

No one knew if the Marquis had really recovered or how.

...

The next day, Eli received the news that Marquis Alina had fully recovered.

It seems like there’s a way to get the purple irises. Elie smiled and continued with his experiment.

In the next half a month, Junlin was in turmoil.

The news that the Marquis had woken up was more impactful than what Eli had imagined. It was impossible for such a violent poison to be natural. After the Marquis ‘thunderous search, he found out that the poisoner was actually a Count’s family. They had secretly mixed the poison into the Marquis’ food.

This matter had a huge impact. Not only was a Count’s family directly exterminated, but why would a Count have the guts to poison a Marquis?

And considering that Alina’s family controlled an important iron mine in the Empire, the truth behind this was enough to make one’s hair stand on end.

This also made Eli even more grateful that he wasn’t directly involved in this matter.

He was just an ordinary librarian.

During this period of time, the Count did not look for him to talk about the purple irises. He was not in a hurry either. The Count had sent him a letter, telling him that he would look for him after the storm passed.

In the blink of an eye, another month had passed.

Count Gimori did come looking for him, but he did not bring the purple irises that Eli wanted. Instead, he brought another piece of news.

Marquis Alina wanted to see him.
