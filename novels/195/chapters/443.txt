444 City of Dawn, Vivika’s Determination!

After returning to the Grassi Land, Eli first went to the center of the Magic Medicine Field.

The Blood Bamboo Flowers grew there, occupying an area of several acres. Each Blood Bamboo Flower had reached the limit of the third circle. Their thick branches swayed slightly, and huge stamens grew at the top. The translucent tentacles swayed with the wind as if they were ready to hunt at any time.

Eli looked at one of the flowers, shook his head, and walked toward Hill.

Soon, Eli came to Hill’s feet. Hill skillfully extended her roots and said in a tender voice, “Father, the Blood Bamboo Flower’s level is too low. At my current level, I’m still unable to make it break through to the fourth circle level. Perhaps I can make it after breaking through to the fourth circle level myself! ”

At this moment, Hill’s intelligence had increased significantly compared to before. Her intelligence was equivalent to that of a teenage child.

Upon hearing Hill’s words, Eli nodded thoughtfully. He then looked at Hill and said, “It’s okay. There’s no hurry!”

With that, he returned to the Magus Tower and saw Dylan on the way!

” Eli, I’ve been thinking about something recently. ” Dylan looked at him.

“What is it?” Eli glanced at him.

” I think I’m still too weak. If I can become a fourth-circle mechanical product, then I might be able to directly sense the location of my main body or rather, increase the range of my perception. ” Dylan winked at Eli.

“Good idea!” Eli nodded.

“See what materials you need. Go directly to Glen and tell him what you need.” Eli said directly.

“Alright!”

Dylan’s eyes lit up, and he happily ran towards the exit of the Grassi Grounds. He didn’t say anything else. The Bloodline Tower’s wealth was beyond words. At the very least, as long as Eli agreed, there would definitely be a way to gather enough resources for him to break through to the celestial Realm.

There were also those races in the green fields who were proficient in metal manufacturing over the years. They could also help him. Perhaps it would not be long before he could break through to the fourth circle and sense his body.

At the thought of this, Dylan’s footsteps became lighter.

Behind him, Eli smiled and returned to the Wizard Tower. He still had things to do!

After returning to his room, Eli closed his eyes silently. His consciousness suddenly sank into darkness without a trace of light.

In the next second, a dot of light suddenly lit up, and this was just the beginning. The first light was like a signal, and then one after another, electric lights lit up. In Eli’s consciousness, they were as dazzling as stars. If one observed carefully, one would find that they were like the distribution map of the Bloodline Tower.

Indeed, these bright spots were actually statues that carried the faith of Eli, standing in every city.

This project started a long time ago. Firstly, it was to enrich the faith, and secondly, it was to make it easier to travel to various places, especially after the giant statue of faith! Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Of course, this was nothing. Eli’s purpose this time was to observe.

He looked at the edge of the light spot. There was a huge light spot on the north side, a moving light spot on the east side, and a faint light spot on the south side. The three light spots belonged to Green Field, Nikola, and Vivika.

” Nikola is quite fast. He should arrive in three days! ” Eli glanced at Nikola first, then at the southernmost point, the lone bright spot.

In the next second, Eli’s consciousness tapped on that bright spot, and a ray of light suddenly bloomed!

…..

Abyssal World!

It was located in the southern part of the Bloodline Tower in the western region. It was also guarded by the Heart of the Abyss, a first-class force in the western region. The interior of the Bloodline Tower led to a mysterious underground cave. In the deeper parts of the Bloodline Tower were the races of the Abyssal World, the Demon Race!

The demons were constantly trying to invade the human world. However, whether it was the Heart of the Abyss or the protection of other factions, it made this mission extremely difficult. All of this was related to a magnificent city, the City of Dawn!

Standing on the city wall, Vivika took a deep breath and wiped the demon’s blood off her face.

Looking into the distance, a huge pit suddenly appeared on the ground in the distance. A conservative estimate was that it was at least ten kilometers in radius. Inside it was dark, but from time to time, an evil red color flashed, and roars sounded!

That was the abyss, which led to an underground cave. No one knew how deep it was, nor how big the area inside was.

However, they knew that even after hundreds of years of slaughter and war, the number of demons had not decreased at all!

Further out was a stretch of pitch-black scorched land that stretched for dozens of kilometers. Not a single blade of grass grew, and every inch of the land was filled with the thick smell of blood and stench. At this moment, thousands of Warlocks were dealing with the demon corpses quickly and skillfully!

Further out was the area where Vivika was, the city wall of the City of Dawn.

The city was not directly facing the abyss. Instead, it was surrounded by a high wall that stretched for dozens of kilometers and was hundreds of meters tall. The true face of the city was revealed after that. According to Vivika’s own estimation, there should be tens of millions of humans living in this city. It was a well-deserved giant city!

“It’s almost thirty years!” Vivika looked at the abyss and sighed.

No one expected that the decision she made back then would actually change her so much. She was no longer the naive girl from back then.

The thousands of killings every year also made her understand how difficult it was for Eli back then. It was he who saved her from danger.

” But only by becoming stronger can I provide help to Brother Eli! ” Vivika touched the silver armor she was wearing. She was already a peak third-circle warlock, only one step away from the fourth-circle.

She turned around and walked down the city wall, ready to end the battle for the day. Suddenly, she seemed to have sensed something.

Her eyes lit up, and she immediately sped up. Soon, she entered the city and returned to her residence. She didn’t care about cleaning her clothes and took off her armor. Then, she took out a statue that was emitting a lustrous light!

As if sensing that they had arrived at a safe place, the statue’s light instantly bloomed, and an image of Eli appeared in front of her.

“Put on your clothes!” Eli subconsciously turned his head. This little fellow was only wearing her underwear under her armor!

Vivika blushed and put on a Warlock robe. She looked at Eli and asked curiously, “Brother Ely, why are you contacting me all of a sudden? ”

It was no wonder that she was curious. Previously, Ely had only helped her a few times when she was in danger!

“I’m here to ask about something!” Eli said directly.

“What is it?” Vivika blinked her eyes in confusion.

“It’s about what happened in the Saka family recently. The demons have invaded the Western Regions. Didn’t the Heart of the Abyss announce that it would tighten its watch over the Abyss? The outside world doesn’t know about this, but you should know a little since you’re there, right?” asked Eli.

This was also the purpose of his visit this time. He was still worried about the Heart of Abyss!

“Huh. There seems to be such a thing. Recently, the guards of the Abyss seem to have increased their manpower, and they have also sent people into the Abyss, but it seems.” Vivika hesitated.

“Seemed like what?” asked Ely.

” It seems to be a surface job. It’s like they are just strolling around and doing nothing.” Vivika pursed her lips.

Eli’s eyes suddenly lit up.

...

As expected, something was not right. How could they be so perfunctory after such a huge change? Unless they were sure that nothing would happen here!

Of course, that was not necessarily the case. After all, these were all just Eli’s guesses, so Eli just nodded and said to Vivika, “Yes, this information is very important to me. It helped me verify some conjectures. Your 30 years of servitude is coming soon. When the time comes, you can come back immediately.”

Hearing that she had helped Eli, Vivika’s face lit up with joy. She nodded and said, “Yes, yes. Brother Eli, I miss you too! ”

“Alright, see you later!”

The clone formed by Eli’s power of faith touched Vivika’s head and then suddenly dissipated!

Sensing that Eli had left, Vivika was stunned. She quickly cleaned up her armor, put it on again, and walked out.

She could see that Brother Eli seemed to be wary of the Heart of the Abyss as if he suspected that the demonic invasion was done by the Heart of the Abyss.

“Brother Eli must want to investigate, but unfortunately, he can’t come. However, since I’m here, I’ll do it for him.

Before I go back, I have to at least find out something!”

Vivika took a deep breath. Her eyes were filled with determination, and her footsteps became more powerful. A few places where she could look for information flashed through her mind.
