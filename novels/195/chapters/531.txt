532 Am I The Villain?

Blood flowed like a river on the ground, but the Warlock Alliance’s people couldn’t care less.

Fight, fight, fight!

As the battle progressed, Eli found another opportunity to kill two more Divine Tree Warlocks. During this time, the World Extinguishing Wind Crystal Butterfly Warlock at the peak of the Thousand Leaves Realm joined the battle, not even caring about his life!

Farther away, Phoenix and Hydra were fighting the two Thousand Leaves. Hydra was not qualified to participate in the battle yet and was at the edge of the battlefield.

The battle continued, but Eli wasn’t anxious. As the battle progressed, his opponents couldn’t hurt him at all. Instead, one Warlock after another died under Eli’s hands. He was also looking for a better opportunity!

Many Warlocks from the Warlock Alliance could feel this, but they could do nothing about it.

The main reason was that Eli’s strength was completely beyond their imagination!

Whoosh! Whoosh!

He dodged another attack from a peak Divine Tree, but this time, he didn’t dodge. Instead, a large shadow directly entangled with him, and then a Mercury Blade flew out.

“What is this?” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

He widened his eyes, and the Warlocks in the distance could not help but panic.

Weng!

Shocked by the spiritual wave, the Mercury Blade entered the tree trunk before everyone’s eyes. Then, a mercury-like light lit up in everyone’s eyes.

The light dissipated, and everyone looked over.

“How is that possible?” The heavily injured Wind Crystal Butterfly Warlock’s voice trembled.

In his line of sight, the main body of the Warlock with the divine tree bloodline had already turned pitch-black, and the lush tree crown had also turned gray. The aura of death lingered around him!

He was dead!

A peak Thousand-leaf warlock had died!

The expressions of many of the fifth circle warlocks changed drastically, and then their faces became extremely bitter.

Looking at the huge body of the shadow dragon, they even felt a wave of fear.

They couldn’t beat him at all!

At this moment, one of the two peak Thousand Leaves was injured, and the other was dead. How were they going to fight? They only had one Thousand Leaves left, and the other two were still fighting the Phoenix King!

With the death of the Warlock, the two sides of the battlefield came to a temporary halt.

The remaining five Warlocks stood in a row and looked at Eli.

The World Destroying Wind Crystal Butterfly Warlock looked at Eli. At first, he seemed hesitant, but then he became determined.

His eyes seemed to be burning with flames.

He looked at Eli and said firmly, “Eli, you’re very strong, but for the sake of the family, we have to kill you today. Otherwise, we’ll have a lot of trouble!

“Family, world, for everything we have to protect, even if we have to burn our lives and our souls, we will keep you on this battlefield!”

The Warlock’s voice was firm and passionate. He looked at everyone and nodded in unison.

A silent tacit understanding was formed between everyone!

In the distance, two Thousand Leaves Warlocks had also flown back, but they had some injuries on their bodies. They had also joined the team, and the seven of them looked at Eli.

“Eli, they’re crazy. They’re coming back after taking a few of my attacks!” At that moment, Phoenix flew toward Eli and shouted.

“They are indeed crazy!” Eli nodded and looked across.

At this moment, the skin of each of these people began to crack. A large amount of blood moistened their bodies, and then their blood began to burn, enveloping them in layers of flames.

Burning Bloodline!

Phoenix was dumbfounded when he saw this.

Especially when he felt a fatal threat in his heart, he shouted at Eli, “Eli, they’re going to burn their bloodline. Damn it, they don’t want to live anymore.”

“You leave first!”

Eli said to him and then looked at these people.

He could already feel a connection between them that was like a bloodline curse. These people had consumed their lives, so they naturally had no intention of letting Eli leave.

But… No matter how many ants there were, they could not defeat the Titan!

The corners of Eli’s mouth curled up slightly.

His life also began to burn, and he used the secret technique.

Level 1!

Two levels!

..

Fifth level!

In the blink of an eye, a layer of blood-red mist slowly ” flowed ” out from the gaps between each scale, covering his entire body like mist. In the blink of an eye, he transformed from a black dragon into a blood dragon!

Burning one’s bloodline. Who said he didn’t know the same trick?

Seeing that Eli had also started to burn his bloodline, Phoenix flapped his wings and cried out, “Crazy, crazy, everyone’s crazy. I’m going to run!”

Black fog pervaded the air as his figure flew into the distance, disappearing from everyone’s sight in the blink of an eye.

On the ground, all the celestials raised their heads to witness this scene.

Even though they were tens of thousands of meters away, everyone felt a fatal threat!

Luo Ye lowered his head and looked at the Warlock on the ground. A thin membrane enveloped the people nearby, and then layers of barriers enveloped him as well, like an eggshell.

His bloodline instinct told him that he had to defend well.

As for the warlocks below the celestial stage, they could only pray for their own good fortune!

At this moment, most of the celestials on the battlefield made the same choice. Each of them activated their bloodline and activated their strongest ability. Some even kindly protected the low-level Warlocks.

However, looking at Eli, who was facing a great enemy, all the low-level Warlocks were ashen. They were not fools and understood that the next attack would probably be a threat to everyone present on the battlefield.
