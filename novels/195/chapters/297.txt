298 Things

At the same time, Luo ye, who was resting, suddenly raised his head.

He looked into the distance, his eyes filled with confusion.

“What happened?” Luo ye frowned.

Just now, he heard a soft sound, which made him instantly alert.

“Milo and Hall!”

Luo ye suddenly thought of something. Wasn’t that the direction Hall had gone in?

Did something happen?

He immediately stood up.

Luo ye’s rise also made the others stand up in an instant. They were somewhat puzzled as they had not heard anything!

“Milord, what happened?” A Warlock walked over and asked. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“Hall went out just now, but I heard a sound. It was very soft, but there was no doubt that they encountered something!” Luo ye said as he looked in that direction.

“Milord, they’re moving!”

But suddenly, a Warlock exclaimed.

Luo ye turned his head, and his pupils slowly shrank.

On the plains in the distance, all the mechanical creations seemed to have encountered some kind of stimulation. One by one, they began to tremble and transform. In the blink of an eye, each of the mechanical dolls began to slowly stand up, and whether it was vines or dust, they all flew up.

The eyes of the mechanical puppets emitted a faint blue light.

Then, they all looked at Luo ye and the others.

“My Lord, we might be in trouble!” A Warlock’s expression turned ugly.

“I don’t need you to tell me that!” Luo ye’s expression was ugly.

Without a doubt, the riot just now might have awakened this batch of mechanical creations!

Buzzzzzz!

As soon as he finished speaking, a mechanical doll took a step forward and charged toward them. It was extremely fast, like a tank, charging forward.

Luo ye’s mouth twitched. He understood that he might not be able to find Hall and the other man.

“Prepare for battle!”

He shouted to the others.

The battle started at once.

..

What no one noticed was that above the battle.

With a flash of silver, a figure hidden in the air quickly flew across the battlefield and toward the Tower. As for the original anti-air spell formation, it seemed to be useless.

The figure quickly flew past the battlefield and arrived at the back of the Tower.

“The battle is very intense!”

Eli’s gaze was calm as he looked at the people fighting in the distance.

The battle of the mechanical doll was still very interesting. Whether it was the transformed machinery or its own resistance to elements, they were not easy to deal with for warlocks. They should be able to buy some time for Eli.

As for the Tower, he would take care of it.

With that in mind, Eli looked at the mage Tower.

At this time, he was only a few meters away from the Tower. When he looked up, he could only see a part of the Tower. However, he found that the wizard Tower seemed to have no entrance at all.

“There must be an entrance!” Eli fumbled around carefully.

Soon, he really saw something behind the Tower.

There was a small hole outside the smooth tower.

The hole was very small, and if not for Eli’s careful observation, he would not have noticed it at all.

“Could it be?” Looking at the tiny hole, Eli naturally took out the key from the box.

Although there was no reason, Eli felt that the key in his hand was the key to opening this Tower.

He did not hesitate.

Eli inserted the key.

It was very smooth.

The key was inserted directly. It seemed that the Tower was originally one with it, and with the key inserted, it seemed that the last part of the mage Tower had been completed.

Eli could faintly hear the sound of gears turning!

He silently took a step back.

Although everything was normal on the outside of the tower, one could tell from the sound that there were countless gears spinning and twisting inside, and the magic patterns were fitting together.

A crack slowly appeared on the smooth outer wall of the silver tower where the key was located. It was pushed to both sides and a large door that was only one meter wide opened.

“As expected!”

Eli knew that his guess was right. That key was the key to this Wizard Tower!

What was inside?

Eli turned his head to look at the battlefield in the distance. At this moment, everyone was still fighting with the mechanical dolls, and to his surprise, the dolls were actually faintly suppressing these warlocks!

...

It seemed like there was still a long time for Eli to explore.

However, it was better first to predict the dangers inside.

With that in mind, Eli took out the die.

A few seconds later, Eli silently put away the die.

He walked into the Tower.

..

“Damn it!”

Luo ye’s mouth twitched as he looked at the mechanical doll that was burned by his flames but was not damaged.

The strength of this batch of mechanical dolls was much stronger than he had expected.

Even they would take a long time to deal with them.

“But there’s nothing to be afraid of!” Luo ye still did not know what fear was.

...

He had brought a lot of things with him on this trip.

“as long as I take care of these puppets, that Tower will be mine.” He looked at the Tower in the distance. Everything they had experienced so far proved that this realm was important.

They might really be able to find clues here.

“Fight!”

When he thought of this, Luo ye’s fighting spirit rose again.

..

While Luo ye was fighting, Eli had already walked into the Tower he desired.

“It’s different from what I thought!”

Eli walked into the Tower and looked at the layout inside, a little dumbfounded.

It looked like a Mage tower on the outside, but it was empty inside.

It was like a hollow model, and the inside was extremely smooth. Standing at the bottom, Eli could even see the bottom of the wizard Tower and the runes that were all over it.

However, it wasn’t like there was nothing.

With that in mind, Eli looked at the bottom of the first floor of the Tower.

On the ground, there was a metal box.

The box was about a meter wide and a meter long. It was covered with silver-white patterns and engraved with various patterns. It looked a little like the sky City, and at the top was a mage Tower.

“Don’t tell me I have to open this box too?”

The corner of Eli’s mouth twitched.

He immediately summoned an undead skeleton and ran to the box, trying to open it.

To Eli’s surprise, when the skeleton held the box and lifted it gently, the box actually opened directly.

There was no lock!

It seemed reasonable. After all, there was already the defense of the mage Tower outside.

“What is it?”

Could it be a new map? Or clues? Or something else!

Eli took a deep breath, approached the box from a distance, and cast his gaze inside the box.

Looking at the scene in the box, Eli was stunned.

What the f * ck was this?

Inside the box, a mechanical head was calmly placed. Other than that, there was nothing else.

The head looked like an ordinary mechanical head. It was similar to a human’s, silver-white in color, and there were broken wires on the neck of the head!

Eli believed he had seen this type of mechanical head before.

It was the head of the most ordinary mechanical doll.

It was one of the most common mechanical items.

But was it really ordinary?

Eli frowned.

A key, a map, a box, a dangerous secret plane, a scalp-numbing curse, an undead army, a large number of mechanical dolls, and a mage Tower… All that just to preserve an ordinary mechanical doll?

Impossible, absolutely impossible.

There was definitely something wrong with this mechanical head.

However, he still had to leave.

Because the battle outside was about to change, he had to leave first.

With that in mind, Eli closed the box again, put it away, and turned to leave.

But after taking a few steps, Eli turned around.

He took out a box. It was the box that had stored the key and the map.

Eli silently placed the box back in its original position, then placed a stone in it. He took a look and gently closed the box.

After taking one last look, Eli left immediately.

Then, the door closed, but Eli didn’t take out the key.

It was mainly for Luo ye to enter later!

The battle in the distance had reached its final stage. Eli took a deep breath, then flew into the sky and quickly flew towards the exit of this realm.
