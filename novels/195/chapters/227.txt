228 Mechanical Box

“A Mage Tower as big as the moon?”

Ere sucked in a breath of cold air and digested this information.

The mage world wasn’t much different from Earth in his previous life. They had similar star systems. The mage world was also on a planet, and the moon was a satellite of the mage world.

However, the mage world was much larger than Earth, so the size of the moon was about three to four times that of his previous life. However, the size of the moon in his previous life had also reached 2.199×10 cubic kilometers.

!!

If Vivika wasn’t joking, then wizard Gray’s tower was at least six by ten cubic kilometers, which was already beyond what Eli could imagine.

Thinking about the size of this mage tower, Eli sucked in a breath of cold air.

A Mage tower the size of a planet, this was truly terrifying!

Although there was no fixed concept of a Mage tower, this was definitely not like the mage tower that Eli was living in. Instead, it was a multi-purpose war machine and had a large number of Mage tools and arrays. It could invade the world, could travel through time and space and had many other functions.

It was not just a heavy object!

Eli could no longer imagine how much power it could burst out with. Even if it was just used to collide with an enemy, the momentum it produced could even destroy an ordinary small world.

F * ck!

He seemed to understand why these Warlock forces were looking for this Tower.

Even if he didn’t get it, he couldn’t let others get it.

“What’s the clue you got?” Eli looked at Vivika.

“the organization that the mage was in was called Sky City, but no one has found the ruins of Sky City yet. However, many people have found an organization that belonged to Sky City, the machinery hivemind. As for the West Coast, it was once a territory of the machinery hivemind. The clue we got so far is that the organization on the West Coast seems to be related to Sky City and even the legendary mage Tower.” In front of Eli, Vivika unreservedly revealed all the secret information she knew.

“Although we don’t know about the ruins yet, I don’t think anyone has found them. Otherwise, there wouldn’t be so many forces that just came here.” Vivika smiled.

She also felt that this matter was very unreliable. In fact, in the past few thousand years, there had been too many similar clues, and they were basically all fake. On the contrary, many forces had spent a lot of energy on these clues.

“The West Coast treaty is signed by these forces who came to the West Coast. Under normal circumstances, we won’t make a move. After all, our goal is not to occupy the territory here.” Vivika said.

“Then what about the black Isotta?” Eli was puzzled.

“I don’t understand it either.” Vivika shook her head with a blank expression.

“Wait!” Suddenly, Vivika frowned. She remembered Kloss’ strange actions that day. He seemed to think she had something he needed.

Did she have anything that Kloss needed?

Looking at Vivika, who had suddenly fallen into deep thought, Eli merely sipped his tea. In fact, the words that Kloss said to Vivika the other day were full of suspicions. It seemed like she had recalled something.

Time passed by slowly. Eli looked at the moon outside the window.

Ten minutes later, Vivika seemed to have finally figured it out. She looked at Eli with a serious expression and said, “Teacher, I suddenly understand why Kloss wanted to fight the bloodline tower.”

Vivika pulled up her sleeve, revealing her fair arm and a bracelet on it. It was probably a piece of spatial equipment like the bloodline ring. In fact, at the third ring, spatial equipment was no longer a rare thing.

She stood up and walked to the space at the side, then touched her bracelet.

Bang! Bang!

In the next moment, there was a bang and a metal box appeared on the ground.

The box was about the size of a small box, and it was silver in color. Under the light of the elemental lamp, it emitted a silver light, which showed that it was made from a very high-grade material.

The top of the box was covered with mechanical patterns, giving it a sci-fi feel. Three mechanical locks were placed on the left, right, and middle sides, two big and one small.

“A mechanical box?” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Eli stood up as well and looked at the box.

“This is the mechanical box left to me by master Natasha. I used to think that it was an ordinary mechanical box, but it seems that it may not be so simple.” Vivika’s face was solemn.

“Then open it and see what’s inside,” Eli said.

“I can’t open it!”

“It can’t be opened?”

Eli had a puzzled look on his face, while Vivika looked helpless. “tower master Natasha didn’t give me the key, or I would have opened it long ago.”

Just like that, the clues were cut off again.

Eli sighed.

“But teacher, you don’t have to be too anxious. Look at these three locks.” Vivika pointed at the three locks and said, ” this is a type of mechanical lock from the mage world. According to the records, as long as you have enough mechanical knowledge, you can open it directly. It’s not a traditional lock, and it’s not too difficult!”

“Mechanical knowledge?”

In an instant, Eli fell into silence again.

What a coincidence? This was a knowledge that he was unfamiliar with.

The reason why the mage world was so powerful in the past was mainly because of two things. One was the profound knowledge of mysticism, which included elemental sorcerers, curses, fate, and so on. The other was mechanical alchemy.

This part of knowledge was mainly learned by white mages. A large part of them could be considered mechanical mages. The manufacturing of small paths and mechanical dolls, as well as the construction of sky cities, were all their domains.

What Eli had learned was only slightly inclined to the construction of mystical wizard tools. He was relatively unfamiliar with real mechanical alchemy.

It was a true knowledge blind spot.

“Does your bloodline tower have any relevant knowledge about that?” Eli looked at Vivika. Although he didn’t know what had happened, his reaction to Kloss proved that this thing wasn’t ordinary. It might really be related to the legend.

A Tower the size of a planet, there was probably no mage who would not be interested.

“Our bloodline tower is a pure force of warlocks. We don’t have any knowledge about this!” Vivika was a little embarrassed.

Eli sighed. They had gone back to square one.

“Teacher!” Suddenly, he felt his arm being touched. He looked over and saw Vivika. She looked into Eli’s eyes and said, “although we don’t have the knowledge in this area, the black Isotta seems to have done research in this area. They should have some mechanical knowledge, which should be helpful.”

“Then, when you’re done collecting them, give me a copy,” Eli said.

...

He was quite interested in new knowledge, especially since it was mainstream knowledge in the past world, not to mention that this mysterious box required related knowledge.

“Alright, that’s all for today. We’ll talk again next time.” As the night grew darker, Eli knew it was time for him to leave.

“Yes.”

Vivika looked at the dark night, nodded shyly, and murmured in a low voice.

Eli turned to leave, but before he could leave the room, Vivika called out to him.

“Teacher, you can take this mechanical box as well.”

“?”

Eli blinked, looked at the box on the ground, and then looked into Vivika’s eyes. After all, this box was given to her by Natasha, and it was not a good idea.

“My things are naturally teacher’s.”

Sensing Eli’s gaze, Vivika lowered her head, tugged at the corner of her shirt, and spoke in a low voice that only the two of them could hear.

The dim yellow alchemy lamp lit up Eli’s eyes. He pursed his lips and looked at Vivika with a smile.

...

The seed that was planted back then had turned into the fruit that he had today.
