513 War in the Sky

Blue sky!

The three-headed lightning python was like a myth that had been reflected in reality!

Its terrifying body was ten thousand meters long, and its thickness was probably a hundred meters. Each of its purple-blue scales was several meters long, and the indifferent aura emitted by its nearly ten-meter-long purple vertical pupils made everyone tremble in fear!

Their heads were round, but they had a pure white spiral horn growing out of them. Countless lightning bolts coiled around them, spreading out in all directions without restraint!

Lightning spread out from their bodies in all directions like a river. In an instant, the sky of the entire Western Region turned blue-purple, and their huge bodies were reflected in everyone’s eyes.

At this moment, everyone looked up at the sky and saw that huge body.

Bloodline City!

The Warlocks looked up at the sky. Their bodies could not help but tremble, and they even fell back.

“What is this? You must be joking! How could the bloodline avatar reach the size of 10,000 meters? This must be a nightmare.”

” This is definitely not a fourth circle! Could it be the legendary fifth circle?”

” I think I understand why they haven’t started a war yet. They’re planning to use their high-end combat power to attack directly. Can Sir Eli really resist?”

“Is this really an existence that we can resist?”

Not only the low-level Warlocks but even the celestials of the Western Regions were shocked by this scene. A hint of despair flashed in their eyes!

Just the aura and strength emitted by three fifth circle warlocks far exceeded that of a half-step fifth-circle warlock. It was a completely different dimension from a half-step fifth-circle warlock. It was indeed a little too exaggerated.

“Three of them?”

Liliana’s throat moved slightly, and her eyes flashed with shock.

She knew that the Hamis family would definitely send out a fifth circle warlock this time, but she did not expect that Hamis would send out three. Wasn’t this a little exaggerated?

“It seems that they don’t want any accidents to happen. Moreover, there was probably a reason for him to show off his strength to the other factions as a warning to the other factions that were restless.” Liliana thought of more, but it was bad news for the Bloodline Tower.

In a situation where very few factions had a fifth circle, for the Warlock Union families that had many fifth-circle warlocks, it would be a huge blow to the other factions.

Even the Bloodline Tower was no exception, except…

“So, Eli, what’s your trump card?” Liliana looked at the grassy ground, her heart racing.

..

Eli looked up at the three lightning pythons that seemed to be on display.

Obviously, the Hamis Family didn’t just want to destroy the Bloodline Tower, and they also wanted to show off the strength of the six families to the outside world. Even if they were one of the three lower families, they weren’t something the other forces could compare to.

“The first time, three Germinal Warlocks came. This means that the Hamis family has learned to be smart!” If he remembered correctly, the Hamis family only had four or five Germinal Warlocks.

“But… If they all died here, they would definitely be very sad.” Eli grinned and looked up at the sky.

At this moment, the three lightning pythons were already thousands of meters above the Bloodline Tower. In the middle of the sea of lightning, the three of them looked down at the Bloodline City, or more accurately, at Eli, who was not far away!

“Eli, you violated the contract and colluded with the Mages. Today, I will represent the Hamis family to judge you!

“Come out and die!”

The booming sound was accompanied by thunder as if divine punishment had descended. The other two also lowered their heads to look at this “small city”. Their gazes were like lightning, and their auras were like a tsunami.

At this moment, the defensive spell formation of the Bloodline City was instantly activated. A light screen blocked it, but just its aura alone was enough to shatter the light screen inch by inch.

Even the Warlocks had no choice but to lower their heads and no longer dare to look at the three fifth circle warlocks. It was still fine if they were at the celestial level, but if they were below the celestial level, it would be difficult for them to stand still, and their bloodlines would constantly tremble!

Despair appeared on everyone’s faces!

“Hmph, what nonsense are you three old fellows spouting? This is not a place where you can behave atrociously!”

Suddenly, a deafening sound echoed in everyone’s ears. They saw a figure fly out from behind them towards the lightning python in the sky. At the same time, the statue of faith in the distance emitted a majestic power that completely enveloped Bloodline City to protect them.

Feeling the pressure suddenly disappear, everyone looked at the figure. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

He was wearing a scarlet robe that fluttered in the wind, and the clothes of mercury flowed in it. He had a complicated belt around his waist, and the Scepter in his hand was emitting a faint time fluctuation. He did not bring the Mage’s Book, but there was even a dazzling light of faith behind him.

At this moment, this figure was facing the three-headed lightning python. It was like a mortal facing the gods and Buddhas in the sky. It was shocking.

” That’s Sir Eli.” A warlock recognized Eli and shouted.

“Ah, it’s Lord Eli, but can he defeat them?”

“That’s impossible. I remember that he only has fourth circle.”

Everyone raised their heads to look at Eli. Some were excited, some were still in despair, some were sad, some were gloating, and some were grieving.

Some people still believed in Eli.

There were also people who believed in reality. It was impossible for Ely to win!

..

In the sky.

The three lightning pythons looked down at Eli as if they were looking at a bug!

“You are Eli. Aren’t you very brave?” The mocking voice of the lightning python in the middle rang out.
