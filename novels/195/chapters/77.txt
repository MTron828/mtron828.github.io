78 Ten Years

The war didn’t have much of an impact on the Empire, but it had a huge impact on the people who had participated in the war.

Some people died, some received rewards, some families lost their fathers, and some had to leave for other places.

Nothing was crueler than war.

This was the first time Eli had felt the war being so close to him.

The war had a huge impact on Rias, but it also affected the Kazan Chamber of Commerce and the Rose Chamber of Commerce. Due to the war, some of the Chambers of Commerce’s connections with other countries were instantly cut off. This allowed Roland’s Chamber of Commerce to grow rapidly. Of course, the Kazan Chamber of Commerce also expanded its power from this, and Eli benefited from it.

Of course, there were other effects.

For example, there were many new faces in the wilderness of Liuying alley. Several casinos had closed down, Alex had also begun to make a name for himself, and Andre, the red-haired man from the knight academy, seemed to have made some small achievements and was starting to stand out.

“Everything is changing,” In response, Eli sighed.

As time passed, everyone had their own plans and their own paths.

No one knew what was going to happen!

…

Ten years later!

Year 325 of the bryne calendar.

The first snow of the empire had just passed, and the sun was beginning to clear up.

“It’s a little cold today!” The gate of a street opened. Eli walked out and looked at the layer of frost and snow that covered everything in front of him. he took a deep breath of fresh air and instantly felt much more comfortable.

Speaking of which, he still preferred summer. If it was hot, so be it. At least he didn’t need to clean the yard.

“Another year has passed!” An invisible wind swept past, and the snow at the door immediately scattered to both sides. Eli took a look at the vines that were still green, turned around, and walked into the house.

He didn’t go to work this morning. He was just used to waking up in the morning to take a look.

When he returned to his room, he looked at his face in the mirror next to the door.

He still had black hair and black eyes, but compared to ten years ago, his appearance had changed greatly. First was his hair, which was much longer than ten years ago, and he looked much more mature. There was also a layer of black beard under his nose, and his eyes were deeper, with a special charm.

“He’s so handsome!” Eli pouted and sighed.

It was naturally impossible for him to maintain his appearance from ten years ago. The appearance in front of him was changed through the faceless mask.

Of course, it wasn’t just his head. His body seemed to have become stronger as well. This was a special potion that Eli had concocted five years ago, which made his body as strong as an Elite Knight.

The loose robe covered his well-proportioned body, but no one could ignore the explosive power beneath it, which further increased Eli’s self-security.

However, these were all secondary. His main force was still his mental power.

At this moment, his mental power had already reached 14.0. The progress was a little slow. If he were to really compare himself to those geniuses, he might really be very bad. However, to Eli, he could feel that he was at least twice as strong as he was ten years ago.

This was mainly due to the improvement of his potioneering skills in the past ten years, as well as the increase in the power of his magic brought about by his mental strength. It could be said that if the current Eli were to encounter a Grand Knight who had just advanced, he would be able to kill them instantly. However, if he were to encounter a top-notch Grand Knight, he might not be able to defeat them, but there was a high possibility that he could escape.

Eli was a little glad that he had been thrown into the kingdom of Knights when he transmigrated and not the real mage’s world. Otherwise, he might not be living as well as he was now.

“Time really flies!”

Looking at himself in the mirror, Eli sighed.

Ten years passed in the blink of an eye. The main reason was that these ten years were relatively stable. Nothing major happened, and even if there were, it was just some minor things.

The first one was Roland. In terms of business, under Roland’s leadership, the Rose Chamber of Commerce became a famous large Chamber of Commerce in the Empire. They had achieved certain results in various fields of the Empire. In terms of family, this kid already had two sons, the oldest already five years old.

For this reason, Roland poked fun at eli a lot.

As for Liuying alley, only Eli was going there at the moment because it was a little inappropriate to bring Roland along.

The second was Rias. The Countess of Gimori had also developed her family to a great height with the help of the old count. This made the old count Gimori feel a little relieved, but his only regret was that his daughter had not taken a fancy to anyone, which made him very anxious.

There was also Hila. It was by chance that Eli later found out that she was actually a well-known scholar, and he was very surprised. This lady, on the other hand, did not seem to have been to the library either and had always thought that he was Clement.

She had already become a Grand Secretary last year.

Andre had also become a general.

There was also Marquis Alina. Unfortunately, he passed away two years ago due to an illness. At that time, Eli had also gone and found out that it was truly a terminal illness, but there was nothing he could do. After that, Alex took over the family’s flag and became the new Marquis Alina.

There was also Eli’s senior, Kurt. he was attacked by a wild beast and died during one of his studies outside. it was a pity.

As for Herman, he was still working in the library and was much more mature than before. Moreover, his daughter was already nine years old. She kept calling Eli uncle when she saw him, which made him feel a headache.

Of course, this was only with the people around Eli. On the other hand, the Empire had also changed a lot.

Compared to the former Bryne the sixth, Bryne the seventh was much weaker. Or rather, he was a mediocre King in all aspects.

In the past ten years, not only did the Empire’s strength not increase, but it was even slightly weakened. Be it the economy or the military. They were not as good as before. Even their political power was much weaker than before.

Over the years, the interests of the bryne Empire had suffered quite a bit, but Eli felt that it was still alright. At the very least, the domestic and foreign environment was still relatively stable. However, no one knew if this stability could be maintained.

“The former king has too few children. There was not really a better choice for him.” Eli attributed the reason for this.

Bryne the sixth only had three sons, two princes, and one Princess.

The princess did not like politics. She had already inherited her title and moved to live in a city in the southern part of the Empire. The second Prince was even more outrageous. He liked to travel and was not interested in anything at all. This made the ordinary first Prince not seem so bad.

If bryne the sixth had more children, he would not have had so few choices.

“It’s a pity,” Eli sighed.

In the afternoon, Eli casually glanced at the flower pot that hadn’t sprouted and walked out of the house. But just as he walked out the door, he saw a letter in the mailbox.

It was from the head of the library, Seviro Mesa. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

His goal was to tell Eli to meet him at the usual place.
