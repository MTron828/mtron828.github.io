293 Vigilance

The scorching sun had just risen, sprinkling down golden sunlight!

Outside the Holy Tower City, in a large open space.

Dozens of people were waiting. Most of them were the higher-ups of the Holy tower, including the leader, Udo. Even Eli was there, but he followed behind Udo like a guard.

Udo turned his head to look at the crowd. Hearing these people’s whispers, he sucked in a cold breath.

“There’s actually a Warlock from the Holy tower headquarters here. I wonder what his purpose is. ”

“The old tower master just died, and Udo has just taken over as the new tower master. I wonder if there will be any accidents.”

“Maybe, but the other forces have been very stable recently. We have also established contact with the bloodline tower. Recently, many of their people have come to our side. I believe that Sir will not have any opinions about us!”

As Udo listened to the words in his ear, he couldn’t help but look at the guard, Eli, beside him with a look of awe!

What the hell was this?!

Even the mystic butterfly bloodline with illusionary powers couldn’t do that.

Dozens of memories of the third ring warlocks had been modified.

And it wasn’t just them. Hundreds of people in an area of the city had also been modified.

It was hard to imagine.

This wasn’t just a matter of memory. How to arrange the memory so that no one could see any flaws was even more terrifying. He couldn’t imagine how his benefactor could do it.

This wasn’t a Warlock.

“Relax, there won’t be any problems!” Eli, who had already concealed his aura, looked at him and said with a smile.

If there were a problem, he would just solve it all!

Udo took a deep breath, and his breathing gradually returned to normal.

According to the time, the people from the Holy tower headquarters should be here soon!

“They’re here!”

Suddenly, someone said, and everyone raised their heads.

The clouds in the sky dispersed, and the huge sky cloud whale slowly descended.

Looking at the huge creature that was hundreds of meters long, everyone sucked in a cold breath.

“sky cloud whale, an adult creature at the limit of the third circle!” Eli looked at the huge creature, and his eyes lit up. He had never seen such a huge creature before!

However, it was a pity that he could not dissect it. After all, it was the Holy tower’s possession.

The huge cloud whale stopped about three hundred meters from the ground. That was the lowest distance it could reach. At this distance, the others could see the castle on the cloud whale and the black dots around it! Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

All of a sudden, the black dot started to leave the cloud whale in the sky and descended toward the ground.

Eli also saw the person’s appearance and strength clearly.

Needless to say, the young man at the very front should be the so-called genius Luo ye. He was indeed very strong. Eli could feel that although he was not at the limit of third circle, he was not weaker than him when he had just broken through to the late-stage thirty years ago.

Moreover, there were a total of thirty-two people behind him, each of whom was a late-stage third circle warlock.

There were also three people behind him, all of whom were half-step true celestial warlocks.

The landing was very fast. In just a few seconds, dozens of people had already landed on the ground.

Luo ye took the lead, followed by many warlocks.

He strode to the front of the welcoming party with a smile, but he couldn’t hide his pride. He extended his hand to Udo.

“Hello, I’m Luo Ye. You must be the tower master of the Holy tower branch tower on the West Coast, Woox.”

“Hello, I’m the Holy tower’s master, but my name is Udo.” Udo looked at this group of warlocks and felt his heart beating rapidly!

“Eh? Udo?” Luo ye turned to look at Hall and asked, “Hall, did I remember wrong?”

“No, I remember that the person in charge here is Woox. I’ve checked.” Hall frowned.

“Woox is my teacher. He died a few years ago, and I just took over. I didn’t have time to send the news to the headquarters!” Udo’s heart was in his throat as he spoke.

“Oh, I see!” Luo ye nodded.

“What?” Hall, on the other hand, frowned.

“Hall, don’t think too much. It doesn’t matter!” Luo ye looked at Hall and frowned.

“Yes, my Lord, I’ve already prepared your living quarters. We’ve already sent people to look for the map that my Lord gave us. We’ll probably find it soon!” Udo said quickly.

“Let’s go,” Luo ye nodded.

Behind him, Hall still wanted to say something, but he was pulled away by Luo ye.

And so, the group was pulled away by Udo. As for the sky cloud whale, it slowly dove into the clouds.

Eli took a look and followed Udo.

..

The area prepared for Luo ye and the others was the area near the East of the Holy tower. It was the area with the best environment, and there were very few people there. Moreover, their memories had been modified.

Soon, they arrived.

Looking at the villas and the Tower in front of him, Luo ye nodded with satisfaction.

“Not bad!” Luo ye was very satisfied.

‘It seemed that this group of country bumpkins was still capable!’

“My Lords, if you need anything, you can tell me at any time. Additionally, there are all kinds of entertainment facilities here. You don’t need to go to other places!” Udo said.

...

Luo Ye nodded and then said, “You’d better find it quickly.”

“Yes! We’ll take our leave then!” Udo said respectfully.

“Alright!”

He casually dispersed Udo and waited for them to settle down. After that, he would deal with the rest.

Eli left with Udo as well, but before he left, he cast a glance at these people, especially tHall. He felt that he was quite interesting.

After Udo left, Luo Ye and the others began to divide the living areas. He also chose a Mage tower, and the group quickly settled down and began to rest.

They had been on the road for a few months, and they really needed to relax.

However, as soon as Luo ye entered the Mage Tower, there was a knock on the door.

He opened the door and saw Hall.

“Hall, what’s the matter?” Luo Ye was a little unhappy!

“Luo Ye, I think something is wrong here!” Hall said with a frown.

...

Ever since he came here, he had felt that something was off.

“What’s wrong? I feel it’s quite normal!” Luo ye shook his head. “I think you’re thinking too much. You should rest!”

After that, he pushed Hall out of the door.

Looking at the closed door, Hall’s mouth twitched!

However, he had no choice. Compared to the Holy tower’s hope for the future, he was nothing.

“No, I have to check.” He shook his head.

There were quite a few people in this area. He could go and search in secret.

..

A day later.

In the Tower.

Hall touched his beard. After a day of investigation, he did not find anything wrong. He had checked many people in the vicinity, and everything seemed normal. He had been overthinking.

“It seems like I’ve been overthinking.” Hall shook his head and relaxed quite a bit.

There might be problems with one or two of them, but it was impossible for hundreds of people to have problems.

“I’m getting old, and I’m getting timider and timider!” Hall smiled and turned back to rest.
