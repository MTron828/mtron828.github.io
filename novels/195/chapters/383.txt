384 Full Power Strike

He had never heard of such an outrageous request.

Eli raised an eyebrow!

In the next second, Eli took a deep breath. In an instant, his bloodline erupted to the limit and he directly activated the third level of Explosive Blood!

The blood mist formed by his blood essence enveloped Eli. Eli felt that he was filled with power.

Marsin Quinn chuckled disdainfully.

In the next second, a mass of pitch-black shadow energy rapidly gathered in Eli’s hand. Even the blood essence that had just gushed out wrapped around the shadow, and the shadow became even thicker.

Marsin’s eyes widened.

A sense of crisis!

A fatal sense of crisis!

With this blood essence, he finally noticed a very serious problem. The kid in front of him was a celestial Warlock, and he felt very strong.

“Not good!”

Marsin’s pores enlarged, and his pupils shrank. He could feel that the shadow was about to explode. The dark purple shadow in front of him instantly became thicker.

At this moment, he was extremely regretful. Why did he participate in such a ridiculous bet?

In the next second, the Shadow Dragon’s Breath activated.

The shadow that had been condensed to the extreme descended at this moment with the support of a secret technique!

A black shadow arced through the air, like a world-destroying natural disaster streaking across the air. A shadow pillar of light dozens of meters thick appeared and directly came into contact with the dark purple shield. However, the shield did not have any effect and melted into the shadow.

Marsin’s eyes were about to pop out, but in the next second, he melted into the shadows.

After killing Marsin, the beam of light did not stop. It streaked through the air for dozens of kilometers and crashed into a mountain that was thousands of meters tall. With a bang, the mountain instantly turned into nothingness. The mountain was shattered by the power of the shadow. A huge sound spread across hundreds of kilometers, accompanied by an earthquake!

Gulp!

Eli pursed his lips as he watched this scene!

He destroyed the environment again!

Losing a hundred years of lifespan was still acceptable. The price was very small!

As for Marsin, Eli stretched out his hand and pulled out a soul from the void.

Eli sensed it.

Ten seconds later, Eli came to a realization.

“So that’s how it is. The Eight-Armed Naga family? It seems that I didn’t hit the wrong person!” Eli sighed.

Just as he had guessed, this Warlock was indeed a Warlock from the Eight-Armed Naga family. It seemed that his news had spread. Otherwise, they would not have had the time to pay attention to him.

As for the information he was spreading, it was about the problem with the Eight-Armed Naga bloodline!

“It’s just a pity that a Radiant Moon died just like that. I didn’t gain anything.” Eli felt a little regretful.

However, there was something wrong with saying that. At least he had tested the power of the bloodline power that had been enhanced by the third level of the Explosive Blood Technique. He had a basic idea.

It was indeed very strong.

Eli had another trump card.

“But we have to leave quickly.” Eli looked into the distance. There were already Warlocks approaching.

He did not want to be discovered.

Run away!

….

Soon, a group of Warlocks arrived at the mountain peak!

” What is this? Why do I remember that this is a mountain? ”

A Warlock opened his mouth wide in disbelief.

“I found a high-level demonic plant here some time ago. I was thinking of coming over in a few days, but damn it, I haven’t been here for a few days and the mountain is gone.” An old man closed his eyes in pain.

“How did such a huge mountain suddenly disappear!”

The Warlocks discussed animatedly, each of them wearing a grave expression.

Everyone had heard the loud voice that sounded like heavenly punishment, but the scene in front of them was clearly beyond their imagination.

A thousand-meter-tall mountain was gone just like that, leaving only a pile of debris. This was beyond the imagination of the Warlocks present.

In fact, they were not the only ones.

As the mountain collapsed, it directly led to an earthquake.

At this moment, everyone in the cities near the Savon Mountain Range ran out of their houses in panic.

Standing on the streets, everyone looked at the swaying city. Many houses in many areas had collapsed. Many Warlocks were trying to stabilize the situation. As for the Warlocks with earth elemental bloodlines, they tried their best to prevent the houses from collapsing. In the end, almost no one died in this earthquake, but it attracted the attention of many people.

Why was there an earthquake here? What exactly happened?

Many Warlocks hurriedly spread this news to the upper echelons of their forces. At the same time, there was also the matter of the disappearance of the mountain peak.

For a time, countless Warlocks were busy investigating this matter.

What they didn’t know was that the aftershock was farther than they had imagined!

The Amina family also experienced a wave of aftershocks. The power was not great, but it still surprised many people.

In the temple.

...

“Master, the earthquake seems to be coming from the Bloodline Tower!” Kenan reported to Selona.

“Bloodline Tower?”

Selona nodded.

“Yes, Patriarch. Do you need us to pay attention?” Kenan asked again.

” Forget it. Let’s just think about how to deal with our problem. We’ve offended the Eight-Armed Naga family this time. We’ve lost a lot of resources. Sigh! ” Thinking of this, Selona sighed deeply. His family had been having a hard time these days.

Many forces were wary of the Eight-Armed Naga family, so they cut off contact with them.

“Bullying the weak and fearing the strong!” Selona gritted his teeth, but his face was filled with helplessness.

At this moment, the door suddenly opened and Simon walked in excitedly. He shouted at Selona in the distance, “Sir, we have a new source of resources!”

“What?!” Selona stood up in disbelief.

” It’s the real, patriarch. The Bloodline Tower has established a partial connection with us, and the Golden Cicada Trade Union and the Charm Mansion are also involved! ” Simon said.

Bang!

...

Selona sat back down on his chair, feeling that the rock that had been hanging in the air recently had finally fallen to the ground.

It was normal for the Bloodline Tower to establish a connection, but the Golden Cicada Trade Union and the Charm Mansion had nothing to do with them. He knew who he needed to thank for this.

“Sir Ely!”

Selona was grateful. With the help of these forces, perhaps the Amina Family could go further.

Perhaps submitting to Eli was a rare benefit.

….

” Sir, a tall mountain has mysteriously disappeared near the Savon Mountains, causing an earthquake in the surrounding area. It might have been directly shattered. It is suspected that a very high-level Warlock has approached! ”

In the Magus Tower, Glen reported to Eli.

“Oh? Such a thing actually happened.” Eli said, ” We must investigate it properly! ”

This time, he went out secretly. No one should know his whereabouts!

“Sir, I’ll send someone to investigate!” Glen became serious. He had originally suspected that it was Sir Eli, but now it seemed that it wasn’t!

” Hmm, there’s no need to waste too much manpower and resources. Maybe it’s just a high-level Warlock passing by. If you really find out, it might cause him to be unhappy. ” Eli reminded.

“Yes, sir.” Glen nodded, then looked at Eli and said, “Sir, there’s another piece of good news. ”

“Oh?”

” The Grassi Ground is basically ready. You can move in now! ” Glen said.

Eli’s eyes lit up.
