268 The Recovery of Memory

One minute ago!

Sergei’s terrifying aura spread out.

Under the White Tower, the warlocks’ hearts trembled as if they felt threatened. They looked up and saw Sergei.

Sensing this person’s terrifying aura, everyone felt their scalps go numb!

!!

No one knew who this Warlock who had suddenly appeared was.

However, they knew that even their most powerful tower master was not even one-tenth as strong as that Warlock. Some people even suspected that just the aftermath could kill their tower master.

“we’re done for. When did the White Tower provoke such a terrifying enemy!”

“He’s in the third circle, right?”

“No, even the master of the bloodline tower, Vivika, isn’t as strong as this person. I’m guessing he’s at least at the mid-stage of third circle.”

All the warlocks were dumbfounded, not understanding how the White Tower had provoked such a person.

Even the higher-ups of the White Tower were hiding in the Tower. There was not a single third-circle sorcerer in the White Tower, so they were no match for the Warlock in front of them.

As for Herman, who was this person shouting for?

Some warlocks were dumbfounded. Wasn’t this a higher-up of the bloodline tower? What did this have to do with the White Tower? why did this strange Warlock come here?

Time would digest everything and erase all traces.

It had been a few hundred years since Eli showed up in the White Tower. Those who knew him would have died long ago, so only the oldest group of warlocks might have heard of this name.

He was the only honorary Deputy of the White Tower.

Most people only knew that there was a powerful wizard in the bloodline tower called Herman, but they didn’t know that he was related to the White Tower!

The warlocks felt that Sergei had found the wrong place!

However, the enemy had already arrived. How should they deal with it?

Everyone was a little confused. At this moment, suddenly a figure flew out of the black Tower prison, the prison on the edge of the White Tower, and exuded the same powerful aura as the enemy.

“Who is that?”

Everyone was dumbfounded. Was there such a powerful person in the black Tower prison?

However, before anyone had time to think, they saw the two men attack. Then, they saw shadows covering the sky and the earth, and the enemy died instantly!

At this moment, an old man pointed at Eli and said in a trembling voice.

“he’s Herman, the only honorary representative of the White Tower. He’s just been in the bloodline tower all these years!”

As a Warlock who had grown up listening to the stories of Herman, the most painful thing for him was that the White Tower had forgotten Herman, the great representative who had saved the White Tower from disaster countless times.

But he was also helpless. No one cared!

Everyone only knew that the bloodline tower of the West Coast had Herman, who was extremely powerful, but not many young warlocks of the White Tower knew that Herman had come from the White Tower.

“Sir Herman!” The Warlock looked at Eli’s figure, tears streaming down his face!

His Excellency’s figure was as tall as it was hundreds of years ago. At that time, he also protected the white tower in this way, and it was the same hundreds of years ago and still the same now!

Herman didn’t seem to have changed much, but they were already old!

..

In the forest a few kilometers away from the White Tower.

More than thirty warlocks were floating in the sky, looking at Sergei calmly.

Some of them were surrounded by air and blood, some exuded a cold aura, and some were like a bonfire. Although they had different bloodlines, their auras were all extremely powerful.

“my Lord, you’re so wise. Sergei and Herman will both be injured. As long as Herman dies, we can reap the benefits. After all, Sergei is too strong. If we try to kill him, we’ll be dragged to death!” One of the warlocks sighed.

“That’s true. I’ve heard that Herman is also very terrifying. Decades ago, he killed dozens of third-circle warlocks. Although most of them were at the early stage, he was still terrifying.”

“I really don’t know how someone like him appeared on the West Coast recently!”

“Let’s just watch the show, we’ll just wrap things up.”

“it’s best if one of them is dead or injured. It will make things easier for us!”

The third circle warlocks were quite relaxed. They were not sure how the battle would end up, but they would be there to clean up the mess.

The group waited for Eli to show up!

Soon, Eli appeared!

One by one, the warlocks looked at Eli and smiled.

“He looks like an ordinary Warlock!” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“I wonder if Sergei can beat him!”

The warlocks discussed animatedly and laughed.

They quietly looked into the distance, anticipating the start of the battle.

However, a few seconds later, everyone’s smiles instantly froze, and the originally lively atmosphere froze in an instant.

“What the hell is that?”

One of the warlocks was trembling, his eyes filled with disbelief.

Heavens!

One move!

Sergei had been killed in one move. This must be a joke!

...

“How can he be this strong?”

Some people couldn’t believe it, some questioned it, and some were confused. All of them stood in the sky like zombies, and no one knew what they were experiencing in their minds!

And a few seconds later, they looked at Eli, who had turned his head around.

A Warlock’s throat moved slightly, and his lips trembled. “He’s looking over!”

At this moment, everyone was looking at Eli’s figure and felt a chill!

“Everyone, what do we do now?”

The Warlock at the front looked at the crowd. His eyes were solemn and his breathing was heavy. He was no longer as relaxed as he had been at the beginning.

“I think we need to reconsider how to deal with Herman. Let’s go back first!” A warlock muttered in a low voice. He was probably the only one who could hear it.

Although the voice was soft, the others seemed to have heard him. One by one, they said,

“Indeed, you’re right.”

“I also think so!”

...

“Not a bad suggestion!”

The corner of the lead warlock’s mouth twitched. How much do you guys not want to fight?

“Alright!” The leader of the warlocks nodded.

The group of warlocks immediately stood up and prepared to leave, but in the next second, their movements came to an abrupt halt.

It wasn’t that they had changed their minds, but that the space around them had been covered by shadows, like a dark ocean.

They were surrounded.

“He’s already here!” The Warlock in the lead sighed and closed his eyes.

The other warlocks were shocked by Herman’s speed, but they immediately understood the situation. Their eyes became tense, and they instantly activated their bloodlines, getting into battle mode!

They understood that this would probably be a fierce battle!

Some of them would definitely be able to escape, but many more would definitely die.

“We’ll try to escape. He can’t possibly make all of us stay!”

The Warlock in the lead floated at the very front. He looked at Eli, who walked out of the shadows, with a calm gaze.

“You can definitely try.”

Eli looked at these people and smiled.
