Chapter 23: Taming Horse

Translator: Lonelytree

“Father.”

As they walked, they suddenly heard a voice.

They looked up and saw a large group of young people in front of them. A black-haired girl with purple pupils in a tight black leather jacket was running toward them.

“My Rias.” Count Gimori gave her a hug when he saw her. He then looked at the crowd behind her and asked curiously, “Daughter, why are you here? Who are these?”

“Father, Didn’t I tell you last month that I’m going to hold a banquet? How could you forget everything? ” Rias snorted as she held the Count’s arm.

“I see. I remember now.” The count smiled awkwardly and touched his head.

Last month, his daughter did say that she was going to hold a banquet, but he had something to do at the time and handed it over to the Butler. He didn’t care much about it, and now he felt like he had been caught.

At this moment, Eli and the others walked over.

“Greetings, count Gimori. I’m Alex from the Alina family.” Alex took the lead and said respectfully to the count.

“Hello, my Lord. I’m Klein, from the Alexander family.” Klein followed closely behind.

The group of people introduced themselves to the count, and Eli and Herman also greeted them and introduced themselves.

“My Lord, I’m Eli, a student of scholar Clement.”

“Eh? Are you a student of Clement?”

To him, it was naturally impossible for him to do anything with a bunch of children who did not even have a noble title. However, he was surprised when he heard Eli’s introduction because his teacher was right behind him.

“Scholar Clement, is this your student?” he asked. He turned around and asked. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Scholar Clement was also surprised to see Eli here, so he quickly went up and replied, ” count, this is indeed my student. His name is Eli, and he’s a very talented student.

“They are both my students.” Then, he pointed at Herman, who was standing beside Eli.

Herman thought, ‘What am I? Chopped liver?’

Of course, this was just an interlude, and the count was only asking casually. He then looked at Rias and asked, “Are you guys going hunting now?”

“Yes, we’re preparing to head to the horse track.” Rias nodded.

“Horse track?” The count’s eyes suddenly lit up, as if he had suddenly thought of a good idea.

He turned around and looked at the scholars, teachers, and instructors from the three forces. “I have a good idea now. I can decide which one of you can get this donation.”

“Oh?” The old man from the Knight Academy had a curious look on his face, and the other two also looked at the count.

“It’s like this. I was planning to form a Regiment of Knights and purchased a large number of wild horses from the Semi Plateau.

“I suspect that one of them has the blood of a magical beast, and it has not been tamed by my Knights. If any of you can tame it, I will invest this money in your academy.” Count Gimori explained.

Although the Empire didn’t seem to have extraordinary powers like Wizards, magical beasts did exist, but their numbers were very small.

Taming horses?

Investment?

Eli didn’t quite understand what he was saying, nor did he know why teacher Clement was there.

“Horse taming! That’s a good idea!” On the other side, the eyes of the old man from the knight’s Academy lit up when he heard this.

Although the student he brought with him today was only a low-level Knight, his strength and coordination were beyond ordinary people. Horse training was one of the courses in their academy.

How could he not be happy with such a suggestion?

“Taming horses is also fine!” On the other side, the woman from the mystic academy also nodded in agreement.

Although the students he brought didn’t know how to tame horses, they were good at adjusting the appropriate herbs. They had a certain degree of confidence in taming wild horses, and they had also learned some lessons on how to tame animals.

Clement was speechless.

Taming a horse was too sloppy. He turned his head to look as if he wanted to ask Kurt if he knew how to tame a horse. He was already old, so he naturally couldn’t personally take part in the battle.

At this moment, Kurt’s face was black.

Horse taming? He was a scholar. If it was about understanding the horse’s body structure, or even about the care of a mare after giving birth, he might know a thing or two. But taming a horse, he really didn’t know!

Wasn’t this the same as sending a scholar to the battlefield?

On the other side, the two of them had already agreed, and the count seemed to be very satisfied with this method. Scholar Clement ignored the dark expression on Kurt’s face and looked at him with an encouraging expression. He then nodded at the count.

“My student is fine too.”

“Okay, let’s go to the horse track. Seeing that everyone had agreed,” the Count revealed a proud smile.

Rias explained to Eli and the others. They all prepared to watch the show, and as for hunting, it would wait until later.

‘It seems that it has nothing to do with me.’ Eli was also relieved.

He thought it was something important.

In the end, it was just a donation, so it had nothing to do with him.

He pitied his senior, Kurt. He was a scholar, but he had to train horses.

‘This is really interesting!’

Soon, everyone arrived at the horse track.

At the Count’s request, a horse was brought out.

It was a very tall horse with maroon fur that was glossy and smooth. The color of its mane was even darker. There were four patches of white on its limbs as if it was stepping on four white clouds.

Even if he didn’t know anything about horses, Eli could tell that this was a good horse.

However, at this time, the horse did not look very happy. It let out a rough grunt. It was somewhat resistant to being pulled from time to time. Its eyes were also filled with untamed wild nature.

The horse was only led by a rope and did not have any saddles.

“it does feel like it has an extraordinary bloodline.” At this moment, Eli and Herman were already behind scholar Clement, observing the horse.

The horse’s eyes were very bright as if there were flames burning in them. There was a sense of violence, and from the horse’s body, Eli could also feel a slight element. This horse was not a magical beast, but it did have the feeling of a magical beast.

There was a high probability that he was of mixed blood.

The horse was tied to an iron rod and neighed.

“Who’s first?” The Count asked, and the others also looked at him curiously.

“My student first.” At this moment, the woman from the mystic academy spoke, and the man behind her walked out.

“Senior, relax a little!” On the other side, Eli turned around and suddenly realized that Kurt’s muscles were very tight as if he was very nervous.

“At most, we don’t need this donation. It’s no big deal.” Eli said with a smile.

Upon hearing the consolation, Kurt looked at Eli, the disciple his teacher had taken in three years ago. He said with a strange expression, “I forgot to tell you, this donation will pay your salary.

“Without this donation, I don’t think the library can pay you for the next six months.

“Ah!”

Eli blinked.

The smile on his face also gradually froze.

He looked at Kurt and slowly said, “Senior, are you saying that without this donation, we wouldn’t be paid for half a year? ”

“Right!”

“Senior, are you confident?”

“I’ve never even ridden a horse before!”

This time, it was Eli who covered his face.
