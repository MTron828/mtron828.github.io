339 Five Hundred Years

“Herman, you’re too slow.”

Around Mercury Island, the waves were rolling. In between the waves, Eli was skateboarding, traversing the waves. Beside him, a young mermaid girl was shouting at him.

“Laura, you’re too fast.” Eli smiled.

At this moment, Laura was already in her teens. However, she was still very young among the mermaids, just like a child. Nevertheless, Laura had perfectly inherited the characteristics of the mermaid Queen, so she was extremely beautiful.

!!

She had long sky-blue hair, eyes that were like sapphires, and fair skin. She was still wearing gemstones on her upper body, and her lower body was still a blue fishtail, but it was shining with a strange color.

All these years, Laura had temporarily lived on Mercury Island. In order to take care of her, the mermaid Queen also temporarily lived on Mercury Island.

The waves gradually calmed down, and Eli put away his board. He had made it some time ago, and he played with it occasionally. It felt pretty good.

Eli stopped, and Laura slowly approached him.

“Herman, why are you not playing anymore?” Laura approached Eli and asked with her eyes wide open.

“It’s almost time.” Eli smiled and walked towards the shore.

Laura helplessly followed.

Soon, Eli walked up to Mercury Island, and a person was still waiting.

“Lord Eli!” The mermaid Queen smiled at Eli. Compared to before, she had now advanced to the third circle, and the mermaids could transform their fishtails into legs at the third circle.

Eli felt that mermaids and humans definitely had a huge relationship.

He had even personally explored it, and there was indeed no difference after the transformation. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“According to human fashion, this is not very appropriate.” Eli cast a glance at her. At this moment, her upper body was covered in a shell, and her pair of big white legs were exposed, almost only covering her private parts.

“Aren’t we the only three on this Island?” The mermaid Queen lowered her head.

She actually didn’t want this to happen, but for now, they were completely under Eli’s protection. Once she lost him, she might not be able to protect Laura at all. She might even be noticed by existences in the deep sea.

Therefore, she chose to give up something.

Of course, no one knew about this.

At this moment, Laura had also come ashore. Water elements wrapped around her fishtail as she walked. She was still young and only knew that Eli was taking care of them.

“Alright, see you tonight!” Eli smiled, not minding it.

The three of them walked toward the island.

At this moment, beside the Tower on the island, there was a large lake connected to the ocean. Laura and the mermaid Queen would usually live here. Of course, they would occasionally disappear at night.

On the shore, there was a table that was already filled with food. Doggo had made it, and he had discovered it by chance. God knew why Dylan’s module still had memories of a dining table.

The three of them ate in silence.

“Herman, do you think we’ll be together forever?” Laura suddenly looked at Eli, her eyes shining.

The Mermaid Queen was stunned.

No way. Could it be that her daughter had fallen in love with Eli?

However, it seemed to make sense. Compared to the merfolk, Herman was more intelligent, powerful, and charming.

the mermaid Queen bit her lips.

“No.” Eli raised his head and said straightforwardly.

“Why?” Laura seemed to be a little sad when she heard the answer.

“Because I will leave this Island sooner or later to pursue the truth. And your world should be in the endless sea. One day, we will be separated.” Eli replied while the mermaid Queen heaved a sigh of relief.

“I see, but I want to be with Herman forever!” Laura pouted and snorted, no longer saying anything.

On the other hand, the mermaid Queen was determined to leave this place once Laura became an adult.

Very quickly, dinner was over.

Laura entered the lake, and the mermaid Queen followed, but she was pulled back by Eli.

“Beautiful lady, would you like to stay for a drink?” Eli laughed.

“Alright!” The mermaid Queen nodded.

…

In the blink of an eye, a hundred years had passed.

On Mercury Island, in the Tower, a powerful aura suddenly burst out and then quickly descended.

In the lake not far away, the mermaid Queen raised her head in surprise.

“According to the humans, this should be the second stage of the fourth circle, the radiant moon stage.”

Her face was still beautiful. For the long-lived race, 100 years was nothing, but there were advantages and disadvantages. In any case, their race’s reproduction rate was far lower than that of the human race.

As the waves rolled, Laura also swam out and looked curiously at the wizard Tower in the distance.

At this moment, the tower not far away opened, and Eli walked out.

“Have you advanced, Eli?” the simple-minded Laura waved her hand and asked loudly.

“Yes, ” Eli replied with a smile.

Ever since he had the aid of the power of faith, Eli’s improvement had been much faster than before.

Eli felt the power that he had gathered into a crescent moon. He roughly estimated that there should be more than 100 units. His strength was much stronger than before.

Moreover, the power of the curse was now almost at 80%.

This had something to do with Laura. Eli sealed Laura’s power with shadow. Occasionally, there might still be a leak, which directly led Eli to kill more marine race.

...

Of course, it turned out that it was a good choice for Eli to welcome the merfolk back then. At least, other than the occasional leak over the years, he didn’t have much problem.

“ah, that’s great. Eli, you’ve gotten stronger again. Does that mean we can go further away from here?” Hearing that he had advanced, Laura was pleasantly surprised.

She did not change much from before, but her appearance was more beautiful and alluring.

“of course, with my current strength, I should be able to cover your merfolk territory. If you want to, you can return there. Of course, it is the same for the Queen,” Eli said to the two of them with a smile.

“I don’t want to. Those mermaids are too boring,” Laura shook her head and refused.

“Maybe you should go and play with young mermaids of your age.” The mermaid Queen advised.

“No!” Laura was determined again as she looked at Eli.

The mermaid Queen covered her face, having a bad feeling.

In the end, neither Laura nor the mermaid Queen left.

….

Time flew by in the blink of an eye.

...

A huge elemental fluctuation flashed in the sky.

In the lake on the island, the mermaid Queen looked at this scene and sighed, “Looks like Herman has broken through to the radiant sun rank. In just 400 years, he’s already passed the waning moon, crescent moon, and full moon stages of the radiant moon stage and advanced to the radiant sun rank. What a terrifying speed!”

She didn’t expect that she would stay there for nearly 500 years.

It was not that she was shameless but they needed to rely on the strong. In fact, the queen had been by Eli’s side longer than she had been by the King’s side.

Unfortunately, more than 100 years ago, a group of mermaids passed by, and they knew that the mermaids had completely collapsed. Their clansmen had scattered all over the ocean, and her former mermaid Emperor had also died. In other words, they were now only the remnants of the mermaids.

“But …” The mermaid Queen turned her head and saw Laura cultivating in the water. She had already attained the third circle and was about to pass her teenage years as a mermaid.

She had once thought of leaving once Laura could control her own aura, and now Laura was almost able to do so.

The mermaids couldn’t stay here forever.

Moreover, Laura was of royal blood and the only bloodline of His Majesty. They had to take on the heavy responsibility of re-establishing the mermaids.

Perhaps it was time to part.

The Mermaid Queen was reluctant, but she knew it was time to leave.

At this moment, the Tower in the distance opened, and Eli walked out as he always did.
