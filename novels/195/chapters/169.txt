170 Chimera

Eli arrived at the center of the arcane realm half an hour later.

At the center of the secret plane was a huge Mage town, filled with towers and low-rise buildings. Many of the buildings were connected by chains.

“That should be the core of the realm.” Eli looked up and saw a tall mage Tower in the center of the town.

This mage Tower was completely black, and it was dozens of meters higher than other Towers.

“the elemental crystals are probably inside.” Eli made a bold guess.

!!

After searching for more than half a day, he had basically finished searching the other places, but he still did not find one of his goals here, the elemental crystals.

Now, it seemed that if there were another place where it could be found, it would be here.

But to Eli’s surprise, there were already a lot of people gathered outside the Town, including those from the White Tower and the Blood Alliance. None of them entered the town.

And,

Eli looked up.

In the town not far away, he could vaguely sense the explosion and consumption of a large number of bloodlines powers, as well as the gathering and scattering of elements. He could even hear waves of roars.

There seemed to be a chaotic fight inside?!

Eli frowned and walked to the back of the forest.

When he came out again, he had changed back to his original appearance. He tidied his clothes and then strode toward the White Tower warlocks.

“Lord Herman.”

“My Lord.”

“My Lord, you’re here.”

As soon as Eli walked over, many of the White Tower warlocks crowded over and asked with concern. Of course, there were also exceptions. A few late-stage first-circle warlocks looked at him in disdain. In their hearts, every one of power was a late-stage first-circle Warlock, and he had only become a member of Parliament because of Kartos.

He didn’t care about these people. Instead, he asked an apprentice, “What happened inside?”

The apprentice was surprised by the sudden question, but he quickly replied, ” my Lord, some people wanted to go to the Mage Tower in the center to see what was inside, but the mutated monsters gathered in the town suddenly exploded and surrounded the entire central area. Now, many people are trapped inside.

“Oh, Lord Rawls is also trapped inside.” The apprentice added.

“I see!” Eli nodded and then asked, ” what’s the level of the mutated monsters in there? ”

“They’re basically first-circle monsters. Some of them are almost second-circle monsters. Otherwise, everyone would’ve rushed in already.” A first circle sorcerer said.

“I see. I’ll go in and take a look then.” Eli nodded, then turned around and walked into the town.

Apprentice: “…”

He had already told him that it was dangerous inside, but master Herman still wanted to go in. This was beyond his expectations. The other first-circle warlock also frowned, but they did not stop him.

“He’s a representative. We will show him face, but the mutated monsters won’t show him any mercy inside!” A late-stage first-circle warlock’s tone was filled with disdain for Eli.

“Indeed, but at least he has some self-awareness and didn’t send us in.” The other first-circle sorcerer nodded in agreement.

On the side of the blood Alliance’s settlement.

“My Lord, someone from the White Tower has entered. I think it’s Herman, the chairman of the White Tower.” An apprentice immediately reported to the first circle warlocks after seeing this.

“Well, he’s just looking for death. There must be good things in the wizard Tower, but it depends on whether he has the life to take them.” The leader of the group was a late-stage first-circle warlock.

“Then, my Lord, are we just going to wait here?” Some of the apprentices hesitated.

“Let’s wait for Lord Molin and Lord Adams to come. When they come, it’ll be time to deal with this group of White Tower warlocks.” The first-circle warlock said coldly. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

The two forces outside the town were safe and sound, not because of some tacit understanding but because their strength was about the same. However, Molin and Adams had not come here yet. Once they did, it would be time for them to clean up the White Tower.

“A small faction that has been around for decades dares to compete with us!”

The Blood Alliance Warlocks sneered.

…

At the same time, in the small town, Eli’s figure flickered in the shadows as he advanced quickly.

It was only after entering that he realized that the town was huge, much larger than the White Tower’s camp. However, this did not affect him much. After all, he could see the tower in the center of the town whenever he looked up.

However, as he got closer, he noticed that the environment before him was gradually changing.

Layers of mist began to appear in the small towns. It was a vast expanse of white. When Eli walked into it, he realized that his perception would be suppressed by the mist, and the distance of his perception was less than fifty meters.

And in the mist, Eli also started to hear the faint sounds of battle and explosions. He headed towards the sounds of battle.

He was very fast and arrived at the source of the sound in the blink of an eye.

A few dozen meters away, two mid-stage first-circle White Tower Mages were struggling to hold off a giant creature.

“A chimera?”

When Eli saw the creature, he was a little surprised.

Chimeras were very common creatures used by dark Mages. These creatures usually relied on a certain core. They were good helpers for dark Mages in battle. This chimera looked like a Black Tiger, but it had three or four tentacles on both sides of its body. Its energy level was around the limit of the first circle.

…

“Damn it. We can’t hold on any longer.”

“The level of these deformed monsters is higher than we thought. In this fog, our perception is severely suppressed. It’s too difficult to reach less than ten meters.”

The ones fighting the chimeras were the White Tower warlocks. At this time, they had suffered many injuries and were in a difficult situation.

After dodging another attack, the Chimera’s tentacles instantly wrapped around the two people’s bodies and pulled towards the Chimera. Its head split open as if it wanted to swallow the two people directly.

“Damn it!”

Feeling the power of the tentacles, the two of them were instantly drowned in despair.

Suddenly, the two of them heard a terrifying roar, and then the tentacles began to loosen slowly. What shocked them was that a huge vine protruded from the ground not far away.

On the vines, the chimera that had almost killed them before was struggling violently.

One man reached into the Chimera’s head and took out a black, low-level crystal. As soon as the crystal was taken out, the Chimera stopped moving.

“Sir Herman!”

The two of them looked at the person in front of them in shock. It was someone they had never thought of-representative Herman.

And he was actually this strong.

They used to think that Herman was a hooligan, but after seeing the scene in front of them, even a one-ring fusion beast was no match for him, they realized that they had misjudged Herman.

In that instant, the two of them recalled their misunderstanding of Eli and instantly felt ashamed.

At the same time, Eli, who was holding the black crystal, was also stunned.

He stared at the black crystal in his hand. It was about the size of a ping pong ball and weighed about 30 grams, but it exuded a strong aura of dark elements.

“Elemental crystals?” Eli was shocked. The crystal in front of him was actually an elemental crystal, and it was a dark elemental crystal. It was much more precious than ordinary elemental crystals.

The cores of the chimeras here were actually elemental crystals.

Eli pursed his lips, and his eyes gradually became serious.

He looked into the fog and heard the sounds in the distance. This was not the sound of battle. This was the sound of the summoning of elemental crystals. It was so pleasant to the ear.

He immediately turned to look at the two first-circle warlocks.

“You guys go out first. I’ll go save the others,” Eli said righteously.

Then, under the dumbfounded gazes of the two, he rushed into the fog.

“God, he still volunteered to go save the others.” The two first-circle warlocks looked at each other and fell silent.

The elemental crystals were worthless for warlocks. Each gram of them only cost a few dozen magic stones. Therefore, they didn’t think that Herman was doing this for money.

Herman was a real hero.

In an instant, their eyes were filled with admiration for Sir Herman.

They had misunderstood this powerful Warlock in the past. It turned out that he was just keeping a low profile. They had found a new idol.
