Chapter 310: The Touch of Frost

As soon as Zhao Xu finished chanting the incantation, he felt his life force being extracted from his body, and then condensed into a ghostly hand that emitted a strange, eerie glow. Some spells in Arthur's repertoire required "physical contact" with the target.

For allies, this meant moving closer to the target, while for enemies, it meant getting close enough to grapple. These physical interactions posed a significant risk for mages, as many spells required specific gestures, and if one was caught off guard, they would be unable to cast the spell without the "Mastery of Spell Release" specialization.

Therefore, even though the captive spirit was suppressing the ferocious bear, Zhao Xu prioritized his safety above all, and did not dare to get too close. He then cast the "Ghostly Hand" spell, which allowed him to substitute for the physical contact required by spells of levels one to four.

The only cost was that each time he cast the spell, he would lose 1-4 HP, and his life force would be restored after the spell was finished.

As the warrior and barbarian surrounding him watched in amazement at the seemingly materialized "hand," they were all eager to see its effects.

Although the Ghostly Hand was a minute-level spell, Zhao Xu still managed to seize the opportunity to continue casting the next spell.

【Adventurer Summer, you activate the "Knowledge of Devotion" ability, linking with Knowledge (Nature), and the result is 17, allowing you to know the weak point of the ferocious bear in front of you, and your attacks and damage increase by +2 insight bonus】
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu suddenly activated his own "Knowledge Domain" to exchange for the "Knowledge Devotion" ability, but unfortunately, this ability could only be used by himself. Meanwhile, the same ability to counterattack monster could not be used because the ferocious bear did not belong to one of the five categories.

After receiving the enhancement, Zhao Xu began to seriously chant the low-level ring magic - "Frosty Touch!"

The ghostly hand controlled by Zhao Xu directly injected a extremely cold frosty air into the palm. If the ghostly hand were not a phantom, it could even form ice and snow.

As soon as the spell was completed, the ghostly hand directly drove the cold and frosty air in the palm towards the ferocious bear.

The ferocious bear, seeing the ghostly hand approaching, tried to dodge the attack with its entire body.

"A mage hits a bear?" the poet muttered to himself, standing in the corner. Normally, the summoned energy hand would mostly inherit the mage's own combat consciousness.

As for a mage's close combat ability, it was not hard to imagine.

Even the ferocious bear thought so, focusing more on defending against the soul prison.

The bear's rough outer skin had a strong 7th-grade natural defense, making it ultimately have a 17th-grade defense. This was also the reason why players had a low expectation of defeating the bear.

However, the ghostly hand itself was strengthened by 2 levels of attack due to the spell, and combined with the 2-level knowledge devotion, it directly touched the bear's body.

As a close-range touch attack, it ignored any armor and natural armor.

In that instant, the ferocious bear was still not affected, knowing it still had a vast amount of life force.

However, a cold and piercing chill directly entered the bear's heart, causing it to start shivering all over its body, affecting its entire body's agility.
Here is the translation of the text:

At this moment, the players were all excited and shouting, as if they had cast the spell themselves.

The bear's speed was affected, which meant that its evasive abilities had decreased, making it easier to hit.

【Adventure Seeker Zhongxia, you cast "Chilling Touch" on the "Fierce Bear", dealing 13 points of agility damage, lasting 7 rounds.]

Suddenly, the bear's limbs stiffened like a statue, paralysed and unable to move. Some people thought that an ice sculpture had sealed it away.

The specter of the captive soul began to release "Captive Soul Attack" round after round.

The players watching nearby were shocked to see the level 7 fierce bear, which had been controlled by the wind mage with a single spell.

"Is the three-ring spell that strong?" a guild member asked.

"It's probably a paralysing state. This three-ring spell is generally very effective. It's not surprising that even a high-stamina fierce bear couldn't withstand it."

At this moment, no one knew that Zhao Xu had actually dealt 13 agility damage to the fierce bear, reducing its agility to 0.

Compared to the severe consequences of physical strength reaching zero, which would result in instant death, agility reaching zero would cause paralysis.

As a three-ring spell, "Chilling Touch" could deal 3-18 points of agility damage, with an average damage of 11 points, making it extremely cost-effective.

What's even more terrifying is that it's a spell that doesn't require a saving throw or spell resistance.

As soon as the attack hits, the spell takes effect.

In general, players who don't have a high agility score won't be able to withstand a single hit from "Chilling Touch".
Here is the translation of the text:

Even if he has no 6th-level spell, he can still use "Extreme Effect" and "Strong Effect" spells to deal 27 points of damage. Ordinary creatures, without legendary or innate high sensitivity, cannot resist this attack. Even ordinary players are usually reduced to zero agility by him, then fall into a stunned state.

Especially after he masters the high-level "Lucky Wave" spell, he can ensure that his attack will always hit. Combining "Lucky Wave" with "Extreme Effect" and "Strong Effect" spells, this combo is virtually unbeatable unless the opponent has immunity to damage. Even then, it will still deal massive damage.

Eventually, the ferocious bear, originally stunned, finally failed to resist the repeated experiments of the Soul Prisoner, and its massive body, weighing several tons, suddenly lost its ability to support itself and fell to the ground, causing a shockwave that made everyone feel the ground shaking.

At the same time, a small bear-like creature appeared in the Soul Prisoner's chest, and everyone was shocked to see this scene, realizing that it was the ferocious bear's soul.

After losing its soul, the ferocious bear's corpse, no matter who casts a revival spell on it, will not take effect.

The Soul Prisoner also uses the 12HD ferocious bear to directly gain 60 points of energy, which it uses to cast 60 times its spell-like abilities.

According to Zhao Xuyu's instructions, the Soul Prisoner immediately consumes the gained energy to cast the "True Knowledge" spell, a minute-level spell with a spell-like ability level of 18.
Here is the translation of the text:

So, within the next 18 minutes, Zhao Xu will be able to see through the darkness and magical darkness, as well as the hidden gates of magic. All illusions, stealth, and shape-shifting will be undone.

The Demon's Soul has 60 points, which is enough to allow Zhao Xu to enjoy the effects of this spell for the next 18 hours.

As for the Frost Sword, it allows him to temporarily dissect the bear's body and take away some valuable bear fur and bear gallbladder parts.

"This is a huge corpse lying here, and it's also quite troublesome. It's easy to attract other animals," the Frost Sword said, feeling a bit annoyed.

"Don't be silly, just now the bear let out two roars and has already disturbed the surrounding living creatures," Snow said.

Zhao Xu had already returned to his horse and continued to flip through his magical tome, looking a bit embarrassed.

He actually had prepared a silence spell, which could completely silence everything within a 6-meter radius, including spells with sonic components. However, Zhao Xu didn't want to reveal his magical abilities in front of the priest, so he didn't use the spell to silence the bear's roar.

The Frost Sword didn't dwell on it and directly ordered everyone to continue moving forward.

As the sun's rays scattered across the lake, the world was about to return to silence. Zhao Xu's group also arrived near Mirror Lake, where a stone path half a meter high was built around the lake, allowing people to walk on it.

"Crazy Wind, the exploration time tonight will likely be quite long, so we'll have to temporarily line up to solve the food problem. We can't impose on you to wait here for a while, or we can divide into batches to line up," the Frost Sword said, seeking Zhao Xu's opinion.
Here is the translation of the text:

In his opinion, it's best to take them all together, avoiding the risk of being picked off one by one. However, this is the easiest way for the crazy wind mage to encounter risks.

"I can turn invisible, there won't be a big problem, let's go down together," Zhao Xu said, actually needing to take a break and eat.

He has a concert to attend in two days, so he needs to resolve the task of the mage tower within these three days. Otherwise, he'll have to sneak away with a huge loss.

"Uh?" a wanderer suddenly asked in a low, dubious tone, causing everyone's spirits to tighten up instantly.

Zhao Xu didn't exclude himself, preparing his spellcasting actions while looking back at the past.

He saw that the wanderer was holding a white rabbit in his hand, showing his teeth and laughing, "It's a lost rabbit, somehow venturing into a crowd of people."

Upon hearing this, the players in the guild laughed loudly, having just finished fighting the ferocious bear. However, Zhao Xu's face was as stern as ever, and the players who noticed it all fell silent, looking at Zhao Xu in surprise.

"How is it, Mr. Wind?" Shang Jian also asked cautiously.

Zhao Xu, however, continued to scan the surroundings, and only after a moment did he whisper, "The wild rabbit's white color, where did it come from?"
