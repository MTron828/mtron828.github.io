Chapter 640: The Iron Heart's Power, Battle of the Artificial God

At this moment, Zhao Xu's mind was flooded with the secrets of the "Iron Heart's Power", a technique considered one of the three supreme martial arts of the Nine Swords. He was deeply impressed by the extraordinary power of this style.

The "Antimagic Scroll" written by the Magic Goddess herself was a rare and precious item that he had brought back from his visit to the goddess's realm. It had already imbued him with a hint of divine power.

As a result, it directly exerted its influence, forcing the artificial heaven to submit to his will. However, he didn't expect that his "Iron Heart's Power" would find a loophole in the Antimagic Field, completely exempting him from its suppression.

In reality, at this moment, Zhao Xu's entire body was still exerting its influence, effectively fulfilling its role of suppressing the artificial heaven. Meanwhile, he also used his "Iron Heart's Power" to find the loophole in Arthur's defenses, freeing himself from the Antimagic Field's suppression and instantly restoring his magical powers.

With his flying ability restored, he hastily grasped the artificial heaven and began to slow down, but he didn't dare to reclaim ownership of the artificial heaven. He wanted to prevent the artificial heaven from being suppressed by the Antimagic Field due to his actions.

At this moment, Zhao Xu was no different from his usual self, but outside a three-meter radius, he was encased in an invincible "Antimagic Field" shell. At this moment, he could be said to have taken his combat power to the next level! "Awaken your inner spiritual and physical strength, and assume an invincible stance to end all unfavorable situations!"
Here is the translation of the text into English:

The essence of Iron Will is to overcome any difficulty through determination and training, ultimately defeating all enemies.

It can instantly terminate any spell, effect, or environmental influence that has been affecting oneself for more than one round or longer.

Even before the next round begins, attacks and damage can increase by two levels due to the activation of determination.

To be honest, relying on determination and training can produce such extraordinary effects.

Zhao Xu initially thought it was just nonsense, but who would have thought that with daily exercises like 100 push-ups, 100 sit-ups, 100 deep squats, and 10 kilometers of running, one could achieve invincibility.

The peculiarity of Iron Will lies in its ability to eliminate all unfavorable states.

To put it dramatically, even if Zhao Xu were about to drown in water, he could use Iron Will to escape from this unfavorable state.

As long as the state is unfavorable to him, he can eliminate it.

It is worthy of being called the "ultimate negative state elimination method" left behind by Arthur since the creation of the world.

It seems that this technique is one of the few backdoors left behind by Arthur.

With Black Mage's counter-magic + Iron Will, it's as if someone has become a living, breathing Gundam, even if the priest is in front, let alone having Red Jade Guard as a superior.

Zhao Xu also deeply felt that the original intention of giving the Nine Swords to the warrior profession was to provide a lifeline, but it has instead made the mage and priest much stronger.

As he thought and synchronized his descent, he slowly landed at the bottom of the dragon crystal vein area.

The piercing red light in the darkness hit him, as if the entire world had entered infrared mode.
Here is the translation:

Zhao Xu even thought he had entered a vast ocean of dragon crystal, with a panoramic view of the area where the naked red dragon crystal deposits stretched out before him.

Compared to the Arthurian crystals hidden in the stones on the surface, which were laboriously extracted and mostly broken into small pieces the size of a finger, the naked crystal deposits before him were enormous, with each crystal so large that two people holding hands couldn't even encircle it, and it could be easily broken open with a axe.

Arthurian crystals were generally worthless, like diamonds on Earth, but if they were in a solid state, their value would skyrocket.

"I feel that after extracting these Arthurian crystals, I can make enough Olympian crystals to last all the mages from level 20 onwards," Zhao Xu sighed.

"Indeed," someone replied.

The coldness penetrated to the bone, and Zhao Xu felt it crawl up his back.

The original summer season suddenly turned into a winter scene, with the air frozen into ice three feet thick.

A voice filled with a sense of danger and eeriness echoed from the shadows, like the buzzing of insects and mice scurrying through the darkness.

Zhao Xu suddenly turned his head, his gaze fixed on the direction where the red light and darkness converged, but his heart didn't feel too anxious.

At this moment, he was in the "Anti-Magic Zone", with his defense boosted by the holy armor of Arthur, naturally immune to most magical attacks.

"It's him!" a voice echoed from behind him.

The fake Grim Reaper!

This was Zhao Xu's third time missing his opponent, who he had never formally met before.

As soon as he inherited the "Grim Reaper's Aura", the two parties had lost any room for negotiation.

This was also the reason why the Heaven's Judgment decided to side with Zhao Xu, judging that he had no intention of becoming the Grim Reaper.
Here is the translation of the text:

Because he had no possibility of negotiating with the artificial God of Death.

At this moment, a body with an endless negative energy emanating from it, as if formed by the confluence of black shadows and killing intent, emerged from the darkness.

The surrounding light seemed to be distorted, and at first glance, it was a bizarre and eerie scene that was impossible to focus on or pay attention to.

"Help me stall for just one minute, and I'll be fine, let's chat for a bit," the Human Heavenly said urgently.

"Damn it, I should have re-forged myself when I was unstable and released too much breath, which caught its attention," the Human Heavenly said, his face flushed with anger.

As he faced the critical moment that would determine the rest of his life, the Human Heavenly couldn't help but curse out loud.

Zhao Xu also nodded slightly, his whole body on high alert, ready to strike at any moment.

"Mr. Zhong Xia, can you hand over the long sword in your hand to me?" the artificial God of Death said slowly, its voice as gentle as a mosquito's hum, yet able to penetrate the hearts of everyone present.

At the same time, the red glow and black curtains surrounding them suddenly flashed with a pair of crimson eyes!

Legendary aura, undead beings!

Zhao Xu briefly scanned the scene and noticed that there were at least a dozen legendary-level undead beings in the room, including the shadowy elves, lava demons, and frost skeletons, among others.

The only thing that gave him relief was that this place was not like the land of the sleeping gods, Antanas, where there were "withered ones" and "half-witch sorcerers" that could cast spells.

These physical undead beings were mostly cannon fodder.

Legendary creatures that couldn't cast spells were equally unable to achieve great things.
Here is the translation of the text:

Just a moment later, Zhao Xu fell silent, his eyes fixed on another powerful undead being. The withered and desiccated body was tightly wrapped in ancient, intricately patterned shrouds.

【Adventurer Xunxia, you gaze at the "Half-God Mummy", and your attempt to avoid the effect fails, resulting in a 1-4 round stun.】

Fortunately, Zhao Xu had already completed the action of drawing his "Lian Jun Jian Hua" when he landed on the ground, and all his "Wu Ji" skills were fully restored.

Iron Heart!

With the Iron Heart activated once more, the numbness transmitted from the "Personified God of Death" was instantly dispelled.

In reality, when Zhao Xu saw the "Personified God of Death" earlier, even if he didn't initiate an attack, facing multiple undead beings, he would have still used a spell like "The Merciful Compassion of the Martyr" with a large amount of immunity. However, now he remained motionless, as if he didn't want to make any move in front of the Personified God of Death.

As a special ability, the Nine Swords Martial Art has no special effects when used, and won't be detected or sensed like a spell.

"You need to tell me who you are," Zhao Xu asked.

"Oh?"

Suddenly, the Personified God of Death let out a cold, mirthless laugh, and the chilling aura around him grew stronger. The nearby dragon crystal formations began to frost over.

"I thought I had already become your old friend," the Personified God of Death said.

"Ah, Mr. Xunxia, how many favors do you owe me?"
Here is the translation of the text:

At this moment, the artificial god of death has become like a black shadow with no definite shape, its lower body constantly dissipating, swaying with countless dark and profound eerie black lights.

"Ah, misunderstanding, misunderstanding."

Zhao Xu waved his hand and smiled, but his hand was sweating more and more as he held the palm of the human paradise.

"Whatever." The artificial god of death shook his head. "In my impression, humans are creatures that cannot get up early, and most of the time, the price is not enough to achieve their goals."

As he spoke, he fixed his gaze on Zhao Xu, his red eyes radiating a cold glint.

"Anyway, you obtained this weapon from the two ancient hands sealed away in the depths of the earth, which has indeed helped me."

"If you're willing to give me the long sword in your hand that's useless to you, I can give you all these undead creatures."

The artificial god of death's red light locked onto Zhao Xu, the eerie light blending with the surrounding dragon crystals.

"You should know that with these undead troops, you'll be able to conquer the entire Wasteland tomorrow. This land, which has been abandoned for so long, will attract its true master."

"As a king who holds the nine continents in one hand, don't you think this adventurous life is better than this?"

"Now, you're just a small lord who doesn't obey you and can still defect to other forces. But once you have these troops, everything will be different. Even the forces controlling the Wasteland will be torn apart, and you'll have the capital to reach the top of the Arthurian Empire!"

The artificial god of death's cunning words took effect, step by step, deepening the trap.

"Ah, I'm finally back to normal." The human paradise, which had been counting down the seconds, finally let out a sigh of relief.
Here is the translation of the text:

Although they didn't say much, Zhao Xu's silence had a profound impact. The minute they met, it was as if a plethora of secrets had been revealed. Zhao Xu's face was expressionless, and his eyes were filled with a sense of foreboding. "Don't you think the divine fragment I took from you is even more precious?" he asked, his tone cold and detached.

The artificial god laughed out loud for the first time, causing the surrounding crystals to vibrate and even sending some powder flying. "It's simple," he said, "because I've already killed them."

Zhao Xu felt a surge of fear as he was suddenly transported back to the ruined town, where he had lost loved ones. The once-thriving town was now a desolate wasteland, with houses reduced to rubble and the land scorched and barren. The sight was a cruel reminder of his past.

Zhao Xu's mind was flooded with memories of his lost loved ones, and he felt the pain and sorrow of his past. He had always been cautious, aware of his "destiny line" and the powerful beings that lurked in the shadows. He had avoided getting too close to his family and friends, fearing that one careless mistake could lead to a crisis that was difficult to resolve.

That's why when Lakshmi decided to take the divine fragment to establish a connection with Zheng Xin, Zhao Xu accepted it without hesitation.
Here is the translation of the text:

"It was impossible for him to anticipate that this painful memory would resurface again. Zhao Xu suddenly gripped his long sword tightly, silently gazing at the sword that had just been re-forged, emitting a heavenly aura. "Higher demon transformation weapon!" he exclaimed.

At the same time, a mysterious horse suddenly appeared beneath his legs, which he tightly grasped.

"Hmm?" The artificial death god, who was accompanied by a hint of surprise, didn't quite understand Zhao Xu's intentions.

It had taken back the fragments of the divine god's power, which meant that there was no more conflict of interest between him and Xiyue.

After all, that power had long since left his body, so why would it suddenly erupt like this?

"I advise you not to be impulsive, Mr. Xiyue. For us, the upper echelon, emotions are the most unnecessary things."

The artificial death god sneered, "Besides, I'm only taking back what belongs to me."

"It is because humans are born to be human that we have joys and sorrows."

Zhao Xu was currently riding the mysterious horse with unyielding courage, holding his long sword with one hand and stroking it with the other, as if feeling the rhythm and pulse transmitted from within.

He was familiarizing himself with this comrade-in-arms.

"If I were you, I would calmly sheathe my sword and apologize," the artificial death god said, using a thought process akin to divine wisdom.

"The ones I killed are already beyond revival. Although that mysterious power escaped, it is still barely clinging to life. She thought she had observed me for many years, but I have been quietly sleeping and waiting to devour everything."

"As a result, she left the temple and removed my prison, allowing me to return and reclaim my power."

"It was actually thanks to you, Xiyue, that all of this was possible."
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu calmly rebutted, "You can't revive him, and deceiving children is already unacceptable. Your soul and divine power are the best offerings for revival, unless the God of Death is willing to die?"

As soon as these words were spoken, a thunderous rumble echoed through the air, like the sound of thunder striking the earth.

"Are you going to try?" The artificial God of Death's voice also became fierce and ruthless, and it had not expected the other party to discover this ancient secret in such a short moment.

At this moment, Zhao Xu lifted his head and gazed at the other party's eyes, which were filled with the intent to kill.

"Paradise of Humanity, morphing long gun!"

+5 Quick and fearless flowing style transformation, dense and sparse shadow assault and defense long gun!
Charge forward on horseback!
