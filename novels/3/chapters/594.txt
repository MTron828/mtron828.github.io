Chapter 595: Dragon Tribe's Assault, Five Great Vows, Heavenly Gate!

As one of the eight major magical factions, "Curse" faction, the summoning system is a crucial pillar, and even extended to the specialized summoning of "Summoners". Meanwhile, the resources of "Specialization" and "Level Up" are also abundant.

In the summoning system, the most typical spell is the "X-rank Monster Summoning" that can summon cross-dimensional beings such as interdimensional creatures, elemental beings, and magical beasts from the corresponding monster list.

This is also a summoning spell used by mages, pastors, and poets.

However, Druids and Rangers have their own "X-rank Natural Ally" spell, but it is limited to specific natural beings.

Zhao Xu had not previously used summoning spells, partly because he had not invested much in this area, and partly because of the characteristics of summoning spells.

The summoned creatures themselves are similar to the "projections" they had before, although they may be suppressed by "Anti-Magic Zone", but they are not afraid of death, making them excellent disposable materials.

Furthermore, the monsters themselves possess their own characteristics, including various supernatural abilities and magical effects, which can be utilized by summoners, just like mastering shape-shifting allows one to master the characteristics of all monsters.

Having the ability to summon can greatly utilize the special abilities of these summoned monsters, achieving unparalleled effects.

However, there are drawbacks.

For example, the "Five-rank Monster Summoning" spell can only summon a heavenly being "God's Envoy" of level 4, with limited power.

In addition to the summoning spell, the entire process of casting a spell is quite complex. On the battlefield, mages really have a hard time pulling off a full-fledged magic spell within a genuine six seconds. One misstep and the enemy will counterattack, and with a low focus level, the spell cannot be cast. Moreover, the duration of the summoned creature is only one level.

For example, if a 1st-level mage casts the "Summon Monster 1" spell, the summoned creature, such as a celestial hound or hellish eagle, will only last for six seconds before disappearing. Fortunately, the later summoning spells are more varied, such as Zhao Xu's current five-ring "Secondary Dragon Pact", which allows him to summon a dragon with a life total of 15 or less to his side.

However, he must first negotiate the terms and pay a premium in life total in gold coins. At this point, the summoning spell itself is more like a mediator. With a life total of 15 or less, Zhao Xu can only summon a young dragon, and even the "Higher Dragon Pact" at level 9 can only summon a mature black dragon with a life total of 27. The ancient black dragon with a life total of 37 is still a long way off.

However, at this moment, Zhao Xu triggered the "Legendary" curse placed on him by Anzhi, and the sky above Ayun suddenly filled with the sound of thunderous dragon roars, as if a grand ceremony was being held. Instantly, countless dragons descended upon the sky above Ayun, numbering over a hundred, and spread throughout the entire sky.

From white dragons to black dragons, blue dragons to red dragons, and green dragons to evil five-colored dragons, all gathered together in this grand event. Originally, the common people who were terrified of the "Undead Wave" outside all looked up at the most dazzling existence in the sky.
Here is the translation of the text:

The giant dragons surrounding Zhao Xu had already densely covered the sky, compressing the cloud layer to the point where it was impossible to gaze directly at it. Looking far away, the sky was a vast expanse of gray, with the shadow of giant dragons looming over it.

Even the most experienced scholars of giant dragons would have difficulty seeing so many dragons at once, let alone simultaneously appearing on the same canvas of the sky. Among the group of dragons summoned by Zhao Xu, the youngest was over two hundred years old, known as the "middle-aged dragon".

The other old dragons, numbering four to five hundred years old, the extremely old dragons of six to seven hundred years, the ancient dragons of eight to nine hundred years, and the ancient dragons over a thousand years old, were all evenly distributed.

Zhao Xu's companion, the middle-aged white dragon Sereus, was also teleported by the magical force, staring blankly at the present situation. However, the power of the legendary magic soon penetrated his soul, allowing him to understand that this time he would be participating in a grand endeavor.

Although he was being forced by a human wizard to participate in a war, the influence of the magic had already made him surrender to his inner will, believing that he had made a "contract" with Zhao Xu since ancient times.

The lead dragons, all over a thousand years old, opened their mouths and asked, "What is the purpose of your summoning us, Master?"

Their scales had lost their vibrant colors, resembling a plain antique, but their eyes still shone with golden light, indicating that their cultivation had already reached an extremely internal state.

"Kill all the undead creatures below," Zhao Xu declared loudly.

His voice was grand and cold, elevated above the rest.

With one sentence, the fate of the countless undead army below was sealed.

In an instant, all the giant dragons summoned by the legendary magic lifted their heads, bowing respectfully to Zhao Xu and saying, "As you wish, Master."
Here is the translation of the text:

The colossal dragon army, like a barrage of artillery fire, descended upon the earth, their unfolded wings slicing through the sky, tearing apart the heavens and the earth. At this moment, the sky of Elyria was stirred by the countless dragon blows, generating a massive whirlwind storm, as the dragons, like dark clouds, converged upon the land teeming with life.

Zhao Xu, who had just displayed this miraculous feat, stood majestically on the horizon of Elyria, watching as the dragons soared through the skies under his command.

In reality, Zhao Xu initially thought that he had only formed a bond with over ten "white dragons". He didn't even consider using this "dragon tribe" as a decisive blow.

However, he didn't expect that this legendary spell would connect with the ancient dragon's covenant. According to the dragons, this world was created by the ancient creator dragon, and the current continent of Arthur was the body of the original creator dragon, Arthur, after his death.

The benevolent dragon and malevolent dragon gods were the incarnations of the creator dragon Arthur's eyes.

It was rumored that the creator dragon Arthur had left a "dragon prophecy", although no one knew its true existence. However, many mages and dragons suspected that the prophecy was hidden within Arthur.

The mysterious symbols inscribed from the sky to the land, and even to the depths of the earth and caves, concealed profound meanings, or were even signs of the dragon prophecy.

It was said that the "arcane" origin was one manifestation of these symbols.

This was also the reason why Zhao Xu chose the specialty of "dragon prophecy". The magic goddess Sylvina told him that the only way to grant no-potential individuals with potential points was through this method, and he was left wondering about the relationship between "potential points" and the original creator dragon Arthur.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu also saw the initial version of the legendary skill "Dragon Tribe's Assault". It can only summon ten red dragons, and there is a 20-turn time limit, not to mention providing nine-ring wizards with nine-ring skills. The project is massive, and therefore, the Dragon Tribe's Assault legendary skill has never successfully appeared in the world since ancient times.

Now, under his eyes, hundreds of giant dragons are hovering, and the whirlwind they create is enough to destroy a forest. Meanwhile, behind Yang Nan, countless civilians have already lost hope in the face of the "Spirits' Tidal Wave" and its scale, especially experienced players like him can instantly see that this is something Yang Nan cannot resist.

Even if these words can shake the morale of the army, it will still spread to ten people, and ten will spread to a hundred. News spreads quickly, and even relatives of players in important positions are hurriedly packing their belongings or writing wills.

Even King Qingwei, who has always been calm and carefree, can't help but change color when she sees the number of undead creatures outside the city that exceeds what she has seen in her lifetime.

Even in the underworld, where the undead creatures are concentrated, she has never seen such a large number of undead creatures.

Given that humans can easily become undead creatures, Yang Nan's strength is no match for this. It's like a curse cannon, with insufficient casters and resources, unable to cover every city wall, let alone build basic towers and arrow towers in two weeks.

At this moment, the strongest Yang Nan looks like this, and the fate of other powers can be imagined.
Here is the translation of the text:

Alongside Wang Qingwei, Esveikh's pale face was equally ashen, to the point where she had already made up her mind to knock out the opponent and forcefully take them away from the desolate wasteland in case the situation didn't go their way.

As for Zhao Xu's family and friends, those who had some degree of blood relation with him and could reach the relatives in the other world, could only pray for a miracle to occur again.

Zhao Xu's parents, who had crossed over for the first time, hoped that their son, who had already created a miracle, would not actually have the thought of sharing life and death with the entire world. In the end, the city was destroyed and people perished.

Countless people whispered prayers.

Those who had lost faith in their hearts, seeing the phenomenon of crossing over and the desolate wasteland, would also surrender and believe in the gods.

In the end, all the wandering and lamentations were swept away by the "tidal wave" of the giant dragon.

The giant dragon tribe, especially the ancient dragon, had strength that was comparable to legendary creatures, and even their malleability was not much different from humans.

In addition, legendary creatures like the Rainbow Dragon, Power Dragon, and Time Dragon, which were far more famous, existed in the world.

After crossing over, the "giant dragon's" mighty reputation also quickly entered the hearts of every Earth-crossing person.

Even children knew the giant dragon's reputation.

Zhao Xu's strike summoned hundreds of giant dragons under his control, completely igniting the initial despair emotions, as if they had already achieved a glorious victory. Thousands of civilians knelt down before him, forgetting their equal thoughts, and bowed down like they were praying to the gods' statues in the previous world. The sense of being on the brink of death made them forget their equal thoughts, and they bowed down like they were praying to the gods in the sky.

Other players, even those at the top of the first tier, can see this scene and realize that unless they can become invincible, it is impossible to achieve this level of greatness in this lifetime.

Zhao Xü, who is located at the top of the sky, is looking down at the dragons that have covered an entire plain with their bodies. These dragons are constantly spewing out their own weapons!

The black dragon spews out acidic liquid, which instantly boils the ground and creates a thick smoke, corroding the skeletons and zombies to nothingness. The green dragon's acidic mist has a similar effect, but it creates a thick fog that disperses, leaving behind only rubble.

The red dragon's fiery breath is even more intense, setting fire to the plain in front of it and turning the gathered undead into a mountain of fire and flames.

The blue dragon's breath creates a linear lightning strike, striking down one undead creature after another. The white dragon's frost breath is less intense, but it turns the spirits into blocks of ice that shatter into pieces.

However, after unleashing their breath attacks, the dragons with mage levels also activate their own magic.

These hundreds of natural mages unleash a torrent of spells, which is the true meaning of "war magic". Just "fireball" alone hoes the ground below countless times.

Other powerful spells are hurled out without mercy, as if the dragons have no intention of holding back.

The frontline of Ya Nan has seen the first appearance of a true vacuum region, where undead creatures are slaughtered to the point of being completely wiped out. Even the skeletons and zombies that have no intelligence and are fearless of death begin to stiffen, as if they have truly realized that the road ahead is like a mountain of swords and sea of flames.

However, at the most critical moment, An Ning used the legendary magic spell he had stored in his body to release it, and Zhao Xu gained an endless gaze of admiration from below. At this time, he showed no sign of relaxation.

Anyone who flew to his level, gazing out at the endless plains, and seeing the endless army of undead creatures pouring out of the deep pit, would know that the hundreds of giant dragons were just a drop in the bucket.

Unless he brought back a million giant dragons, he might have a chance to stop this undead tide.

Zhao Xu had to face the enemy, who had swallowed up other camps and strengthened their forces by absorbing the undead army.

At this time, countless forces from Earth, who had crossed over to help, were also doing their best to assist each region, although they were also struggling to survive. But they were still holding on for dear life.

Zhao Xu's thoughts flashed by, and he instantly disappeared!

The next moment, he appeared in another camp 100 kilometers away.

Just as he had appeared, he vanished again, only giving a fleeting glance.

In the next round, Zhao Xu appeared in another camp 100 kilometers away in a different direction.

From that dimension, he could even see the direction of An Ning from the edge of the horizon.

This time, Zhao Xu similarly glanced briefly before disappearing.

He used the Five-Ring Transmission Technique.

The potential point was restored to the Five-Ring Technique position.

Zhao Xu performed these two actions every round, traversing over a hundred camps in just ten minutes, while the giant dragons and undead tide were in a stalemate.

Finally, he returned to An Ning.

He had confirmed the desperate situation of the camps facing the undead pressure using his own unlimited transmission.

This investigation also made him realize one thing:

This undead tide was indeed controlled by a hidden hand.
Here is the translation of the text:

It distributes a sufficient number of undead creatures according to the strength of each district, and in just a few days, the districts that have not received support will become a densely populated district of spirits. However, the pressure and number of spirits faced by the most dazzling pearl in all districts are the most numerous, equivalent to half of the entire spirit tide!

As a result, the districts that have not yet submitted to the influence of the pearl have already been consumed by an overwhelming number of undead creatures, unable to withstand even a few hours.

Although he does not know why his pearl is being targeted by an invisible hand, Zhao Xiu will not ignore this fact.

Since hundreds of giant dragons cannot overturn this chessboard, he will use the will that can shake the world!

He has already been clear that this is the true crisis of extinction that humanity has faced since crossing over.

Zhao Xiu immediately took out the twelve candles representing the goddess of magic from his bosom, lit them without hesitation, and scattered them around his body.

The next moment, he took out the rosary from his pocket, which he usually used to activate the "magic bead" to elevate his magical abilities by 10 minutes to level 4. This time, however, he drew out the last seven beads of the rosary, summoning the deity of the user to appear in the physical form, consuming a single-use item.

Zhao Xiu then summoned his own "Treatise on the Laws of the Universe" and activated the "Miracle Art" of the ninth circle, casting it four times in a row!

The "Treatise on the Laws of the Universe" was on the verge of instability and began to slowly disperse, but Zhao Xiu didn't care. He summoned the "Treatise on the Laws of the Universe" again and activated the "Prayer Art" of the ninth circle, casting it four times in a row!

Finally, the abilities left by Larkes could no longer sustain the "Treatise on the Laws of the Universe", and it instantly returned to its original form, flying towards the unknown direction of Larkes, returning to its original owner.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

Next, Zhao Xu placed his hand on his pulsating heart - the "miraculous technique" given to him by the previous pope, with three divine representatives, each with unpredictable power that could surpass legendary levels. He activated the second "miracle"!

At this moment - the sky above Ya Nan flashed with countless, shimmering lights, like a shooting star shining brightly.

The five great wishes - prayer candles, invoking beads, miraculous techniques, prayer techniques, and divine miraculous techniques - combined to transform into the most pure energy channel created since the birth of the world - the gate of heaven's kingdom, open!
