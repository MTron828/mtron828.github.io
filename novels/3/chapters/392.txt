Chapter 393: Close-Range Damage Explosion

Compared to the 300HP super giant mutated scorpion, the giant one had dropped to half its health, leaving 150HP. The super large one had decreased to half again, leaving 75HP, while the large one had decreased to 32HP. Even the medium-sized one had decreased to 13HP, and the small one had decreased to 6HP, making it an easy kill for Vivian with a single sword strike.

To enhance his own attack power, Zhao Xu's gaze immediately turned to the two large knowledge-enhancing abilities that could increase attack and damage.

Since insect-type creatures were not within the scope of dark knowledge and its effect was limited in time, Zhao Xu didn't consider it.

His knowledge devout ability was currently usable, as long as he was in combat with the corresponding creature, and it would allow him to gain an enhancement.

As an insect-type creature falls within the scope of natural knowledge, Zhao Xu had already upgraded this skill to level 5, with a total adjustment value of 9 from his 28 intelligence. Therefore, his knowledge (natural) skill was at level 14.

The higher his skill level, the higher the attack and damage increase he would receive.

No longer was Zhao Xu the novice who could only barely gain a small amount of skill value through meticulous calculations.

For skills that others couldn't even begin to imagine, he would only consider whether to switch to a different spell slot or not.

Zhao Xu immediately cast the two large spells that could enhance any skill level.

【Adventurer Zhong Xia, you cast the "Skill Enhancement" spell, selecting the knowledge (natural) to gain a 7-level environmental enhancement (7 = 2 + level 11/2), duration: 110 minutes (10 minutes per level).】
Here is the translation of the text:

"Adventurer Xia, you cast the spell 'Learning Song' (lasting spell), selecting knowledge (natural) to gain a 10-level enhancement (10 = 4 + level 12/2). The duration is 24 hours (originally 12 rounds).

In an instant, Xia's knowledge (natural) skill, which was at level 14, suddenly increased to level 17 and soared to 31.

With just two simple yet inaccessible ring spells, Xia stacked his knowledge skills to the level of a master.

Or, to put it another way, it's a level that most players can only dream of achieving in their lifetime.

At this point, Xia can still cast spells to stack, such as the divine knowledge spell, which can give all knowledge skills a 10-level insight bonus.

This means he can still increase his knowledge skills to level 41.

This means that to him, secrets below level 41 in the knowledge source are no longer secrets, and even 61-level secrets can be searched and retrieved perfectly.

In essence, this world has become transparent to him.

The level 41 knowledge skill can even access the inner workings of the knowledge source. He can get what he wants.

Even after accepting Vivian's support, Xia searched for a 44-level secret - the true appearance of the demon mother, which even the demon mother herself felt terrified of, and any living being who saw her true appearance would die.

However, Xia has shifted his focus from gossip to his own improvement and attack route.

'Knowledge Devotion', Adventurer Xia, activates the spell, targeting the variegated scorpion creature. Your knowledge (natural) check is 42 levels (30 + D20), exceeding the fifth-level difficulty of 36 levels, and your attack and damage gain a +5-level insight bonus.'"
After gaining insight into Zhao Xun's attack aspect, his attack power exceeds 11 levels. At this point, once he comes into contact with a variant spider, the ability brought by the insight will make it easier for him to detect the variant spider's weaknesses and break through its defense. Zhao Xun's 11-level attack has already reached a point where he no longer needs to enhance his own attack power.

The variant spider's defense level, ranging from 10 to 20 levels, is based on its natural defense armor. With the sustained "Ghost Strike" spell, Zhao Xun can penetrate all armor. The variant spiders, from super mini to super giant, lose their defense armor, which is only 10 levels or lower.

Therefore, Zhao Xun, who has mastered the Ghost Strike spell, is an inevitable existence for the variant spiders. Even if he unleashes a clumsy attack, he can, with his skill and good luck, hit the variant spider's weak point and cause damage.

Even the leaders of the escape teams hiding in the mountains cannot imagine that they were unable to penetrate the defense before and are now as fragile as paper in front of Zhao Xun.

The combination of the Ghost Strike spell and the accumulated knowledge and skills is a terrifying combination.

Vivian seems to have noticed the abnormality on Zhao Xun's body and asked, "Will you increase your attack power?"

Zhao Xun nodded and smiled.

"You're just not using the stick in your hand effectively," Vivian slightly furrowed her brow.

The damage output of Arthur's weapon is divided into two parts: area damage and fixed damage.

Area damage refers to the damage caused by the weapon itself, determined by the location, depth, and intensity of the attack.
Here is the translation of the text:

Like a wooden stick that has gone through a lot of statistical analysis, its damage range is very clear. A small wooden stick is 1-4 (1D4), and a medium-sized one is 1-6 (1D6) points.

Fixed damage includes additional damage from strength and other fixed additional damage.

Zhao Xu can now casually strike a mutant scorpion and cause 1-6 points of floating damage.

As for fixed damage, there are the following: -1 (strength), 5 (insight/knowledge devoutness), 3 (good luck/praise), and 2 (magic weapon), totaling 9 points.

So, he deals 10-15 points of damage with a single strike, which falls within the moderate range.

However, among players, he is already an extraordinary existence.

At least, he lightly strikes and means the death of a medium-sized mutant scorpion.

As long as Zhao Xu is willing to sacrifice a 1-ring spell, the damage he deals in that round can be doubled, reaching 20-30 points of damage output.

Generally, ordinary two- to three-star warriors are killed by him with a single strike.

After that, Zhao Xu and Vivian set out to find the mysterious nest of the mutant scorpions.

Although the visibility in the valley at night is poor, they quickly located the general direction of the nest due to the existence of the same treasure box.

Vivian also utilized her 12th-level search skill.

After flipping through a region of over a hundred square meters, they found a cave. The entrance of the cave is not narrow, and it is already very difficult for a giant mutant scorpion to enter and exit, let alone a super-giant one that relies on its own arbitrary door ability to move around.

Vivian knelt down and gently picked up a hard block, as if sensing the hardness.

"What is this?"
Here is the translation of the text:

"Ah, the feces of the mutated scorpion, and indeed, that's their nest below. Viola directly crushed the lump in her hand, not showing the slightest psychological distress.

Zhao Xu's stomach was a bit uncomfortable.

He remembered an adventure he had with Zhang Qi in his past life, where Zhang Qi fell into a strange mud pit and all the monsters around them seemed to be trembling with fear. Even wild rabbits like that would freeze in place, allowing them to catch them.

Later, Zhang Qi specially went back to dig up the mud pit and brought it back home to worship it.

Before going to battle in the future, he would take a mud bath to boost his morale, almost making it a rule for their family, the Zhangs.

One day, a merchant told Zhang Qi that the mud was actually the dragon's dung.

'Will we go in now?' Viola asked, holding up her sacred avenger and preparing to attack ahead.

'Wait a minute, I'll add another layer of magic,' Zhao Xu whispered.

At this moment, his eyes also showed a hint of seriousness.

'Before, we weren't sure if we could find this nest, so I only added a single ring of magic. But now that we're sure, I can add more.'

Zhao Xu wasn't just planning to knock out a single large mutated scorpion with one hit.

As a 3rd-level basic attacker, he hadn't reached the 6th level and couldn't master combo attacks.

So Zhao Xu could only use his full strength to launch one attack per round.

With the Quickening technique, he could barely add another attack.

He smiled slightly and raised his hand to begin casting the spell.

'Adventurer Zhongxia, you are using the 3-ring spell "Higher Unusual Impact", increasing your wooden rod damage from medium-sized 1-6 to giant weapon damage 3-18 (3D6), lasting for 12 hours.'"
Here is the translation of the text:

As the weapon becomes larger, its damage-causing ability also becomes stronger. However, there is no such physique that cannot hold a corresponding weapon. The higher-level non-magical strike, in an instant, turns the weapon held by Zhao Xu with an average physique into one held by a giant, causing the same damage as a giant holding a stick. It directly crushes the damage of all medium-sized weapons. At this time, the "wooden stick" - the symbol of power, directly releases a halo of light, as if his body has grown several circles larger. At this time, Zhao Xu's wooden stick can cause 12-27 damage with a single swing, with an estimated 20 HP, and activating the staff's amplification effect will cause 40 HP. It can take down two large variant scorpions in one round. However, Zhao Xu is not satisfied and does not stop the spellcasting process. Suddenly, this original 1-round spell makes Zhao Xu's first strike after each charge cause double damage, lasting 24 hours. The staff's amplification effect also allows for consecutive attacks with increased speed. Looking at this scene, Zhao Xu is finally satisfied. As long as he activates the staff's ability to double the damage, then his charge followed by a swing will deal 3 times the basic damage. That is, 60 (buff + staff) + 40 (staff) = 100 HP of massive damage output. Arthur's doubling is calculated by adding one, so two doublings are not quadruple damage, but triple.
Here is the translation of the text:

At this moment, Vivian noticed the weapon in Zhao Xu's hand, which shone with a radiant glow, and understood what he was doing. Or rather, she had seen similar behavior in the May Lady. Even the opponent had a similar "Power Symbolic Rod" in their hand.

"The Guildmaster," the May Lady also likes to add abilities to her wooden rod that can double the damage of a charge attack," Zhao Xu said with a smile.

Zhao Xu's expression faltered slightly, and he seemed to have a familiar impression. He immediately pulled out a recent edition of the Arthurian Magical Compendium from his backpack. Then he quickly located the ability and chuckled to himself, "It's indeed a rare find to have such an effect in a +1 value weapon enchantment. It's really hard to come by."

Like a dance, the weapon's effects were like +5 value and decapitation effects were also +5 value. Generally, +1 value enchantments were rather ordinary.

Just as Zhao Xu had tripled the damage of his weapon, he saw this scene and couldn't help but get excited. He immediately began to read the detailed effects of the enchantment.

Ordinarily, people would refer to these contents before customizing their weapons and enchanting them. However, Zhao Xu actually had a spell that allowed him to temporarily enchant his weapon.

"Adventurer Zong Xia, cast the 'Self-Strengthening Weapon' spell to temporarily add a +1 enchantment effect or up to 3000 gold coins to the weapon, lasting 110 minutes," he cast the spell.

Instantly, the Power Symbolic Rod in Zhao Xu's hand transformed into a +2 Unwavering Wooden Rod on the character card. Unfortunately, he had not yet reached the sixth level, otherwise, he could have temporarily added a +5 value enchantment ability to his weapon enchantment.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

Regardless of how it turned out, the damage output of Zhao Xu's activated staff at this moment has already become 80HP (4 times) + 60HP (3 times) = 140HP, a terrifying output.

One bull charge, one staff ability, and one fearless ability.

A giant mutated scorpion is now standing in front of him, which is a two-rod-killing situation.

Later, Zhao Xu will obtain even stronger spells, which can continue to improve from the perspective of strength, enchantment, and expertise.

Most of it is a continuation of his thoughts today, and even these spells can be used to be legendary.

When he upgrades a few more times, his one-round damage output will not be the current 150HP, but rather several thousand damage output.

Even slaying a giant dragon will no longer be a fantasy.

"Go in, Vivian," Zhao Xu directly put the staff with the power symbol on his shoulder and walked in slowly.

At this moment, Vivian was looking at Zhao Xu's back, feeling as if the ghosts of countless mutated scorpions were wailing.
