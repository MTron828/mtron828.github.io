Chapter 680: The Past and Present

Zhou Xu hadn't expected to run into an old acquaintance in the early stages of his reincarnation.

In his past life, he knew that Xiao Ling liked the members of the idol group, Lü Yǔ. This was because after their reincarnation, they had met again, and Lü Yǔ continued to exhibit her pre-reincarnation talents, participating in a performance troupe composed of Earthlings, touring various places and performing Earth music and art to spread Earth's culture to the people of Artesia.

This approach was, in essence, driven by Earth's influence, attempting to continuously spread Earth's culture and leave a mark in this world.

During their tour, the troupe was unfortunately attacked by Goblins while passing through the town of Qīng Xīng.

By the time Zhou Xu received the distress call and arrived at the scene, many people had been killed or injured, and Zhou Xu had to rescue the nearly kidnapped teenage girls, fighting off the enemy.

Before the Earthlings intervened, these people had to settle down in Qīng Xīng and gradually assimilate into the local community.

At that time, Zhou Xu and Xiao Ling's relationship was still in its early stages, not yet officially married, but almost there.

Naturally, Xiao Ling was overjoyed to see Lü Yǔ again and immediately took on the task of taking care of her.

Most of the people who joined the troupe were refugees who had lost their families in various chaotic situations and had no one to rely on.

Zhou Xu couldn't understand why Lü Yǔ was so eager to repay him. Maybe it was because of his heroic image when he saved her, or maybe it was because she was worried about her future and wanted to express her gratitude.

Lü Yǔ sneaked onto Zhou Xu's bed one night, when Xiao Ling was participating in a ceremony at the temple, and was prepared to offer herself to him.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

Zhao Xu had forgotten about it, and he had refused the other party with a certain kind of determination at the time.

After this incident, Lü Yu quietly followed a merchant caravan and returned to the Earth's sphere alone.

Later, Zheng Xin'ao scolded Zhao Xu for possibly offending the other party after returning from the festival.

Zhao Xu just laughed naturally and brushed it off.

It wasn't until seven or eight years later, when Zhao Xu was burdened with a deep sense of blood debt, that he encountered Lü Yu again in the capital of a certain country. By then, Lü Yu had become a wealthy noblewoman living alone.

The coincidence of their reunion was like a gentle spring breeze, and Zhao Xu still felt emotional when he saw her again today.

As Lü Yu heard Zheng Xin'ao's surprised cry, the girl idol in the cell was worried that the two of them would make a loud noise, which would attract the attention of the cannibal demons. However, she still couldn't suppress her inner excitement.

It was as if she had truly felt the impact of her "idol" identity for the first time after crossing over.

"Louder, do you recognize me?" Lü Yu asked with a hint of surprise.

"That's definitely it, I love your album 'Girl Fly Away' so much that I listen to it every night before going to bed," Zheng Xin'ao said happily.

"Kun'er, wait a minute, I'll open the door first," she said, scanning the door lock with her eyes and preparing to rescue the other party.

However, Lü Yu saw this scene and finally burst into tears, choking back tears. "It's great, I've finally waited for you," she said.

At this time, Zheng Xin'ao was holding the "Heavenly Paradise" that Zhao Xu had given her earlier, which had a golden core that could break any obstacle. It was no problem for a normal door lock.

However, Zhao Xu just pressed his shoulder slightly and held it for a few seconds.
Here is the translation of the text:

Until the moment when Zheng Xin Yao and the deer-like woman, Lu Yue, revealed strange gazes, he only relaxed and said, "It's nothing, I'm just observing the door lock structure, seeing if there are any traps, afraid you might accidentally trigger one yourself."

"Uh-huh," Zheng Xin Yao nodded slightly and then brandished the long sword in his hand, focusing all his attention, preparing to break the lock hanging from the prison cell.

When Zheng Xin Yao and Lu Yue were talking earlier, Zhao Xu had already quietly used the "One Ring" divination art to perceive the state of the four people in the prison cell.

The three divination results were "on the brink of death," indicating that they were still alive but severely injured, with their life force almost depleted to zero.

Only Lu Yue, as the only female, was completely normal, except for being covered in filth from head to toe. He didn't fear that there might be any hidden traps inside, mainly because he needed to investigate thoroughly before giving Zheng Xin Yao a lesson on the spot.

If there were any hidden traps inside, he would definitely intercept them and tell Zheng Xin Yao where the weaknesses were.

But Zhao Xu's true concern was actually the welfare of Lu Yue, so he used the "memory modification" to search for Lu Yue's past in the prison cell.

Lu Yue, hearing the glimmer of hope, couldn't help but choke back tears.

"Those demon-eaters are so terrifying. My companions were all dismembered and thrown away. I only managed to escape by singing their sacred song."

"Before I was on Earth, everyone told me that as long as I played the role of an idol, I could sell my dreams to fans. No one told me what actual survival was like..."
As she spoke, her eyes revealed a panicked gaze, as if she was trapped in a state of numbness, with rapid breathing.

"Lady Lu, you don't need to worry, you can still survive well after we get out," Zheng Xin Yao comforted her quickly.

As soon as he finished speaking, the long sword she was holding was still pressed against the iron lock.
Here is the translation of the text:

However, the only sound caused by allowing was a crisp and clear ring.

The iron lock remained unmoved.

Embarrassing.

"You don't have enough strength," Zhao Xu said, and as he spoke, he walked to the front and gently pinched his hand.

At this moment, the strength of over 50 points on Zhao Xu's body suddenly burst out, and the entire iron lock twisted and deformed, and he easily took it off with his bare hands.

"Ah?" Allowance was shocked, "Commander, you have such a trick up your sleeve, did you hide a metal rod in your hand?"

Meanwhile, sitting in the cell, Rain, who had the best angle to see Zhao Xu's performance, was completely shocked by the fact that Zhao Xu relied solely on his physical strength to bend the iron lock.

She was also brought back to reality by this stunning scene.

"Save your idol, girl," Zhao Xu said lazily, not bothering to scold Allowance.

Allowance naturally followed and leaned into Rain, her face flushed with excitement, with no hesitation in embracing Rain.

Zhao Xu was also puzzled, was he really forgetting something?

How could he remember the idol, Rain, so deeply?

"Rain, are you okay? Can you still move?" Allowance asked, concerned.

"I'm fine, and I can still do everything well," Zhao Xu joked.

"What? Men's minds are only like that?" Allowance couldn't help but pause.

"No, I'm just telling you the truth," Zhao Xu shrugged, "I said that, and you look much more at ease."

At this moment, Allowance realized she had many things to say but couldn't find the words to argue back.

Zhao Xu's mind was also becoming increasingly entangled. If Rain were to offer herself to him again, would he accept or refuse?
Oh, no matter how I think about it, there's a bit of a scoundrel's tendency.
