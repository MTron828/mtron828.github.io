Chapter 652: Returning to the Family

Zhao Xu walked on the ground of the Yannian region, his mind still revolving around Anniel's last warning.

"Anybody who possesses cursed flames will exhibit extraordinary behavior."

The owner of the cursed flames has their own characteristics, including their skills, innate abilities, and internal magical energy, which are all different.

Once one possesses the cursed flames, the simplest way is to use them for medical purposes or create explosive fire waves, or even absorb the effects of magic that comes into contact with them.

As for those who have deeply researched the cursed flames, they can even achieve more effects.

For example, they can release multiple waves of cursed flames at once or directly control the flames to fly.

Compared to the magic driven by "incantation" and "spell", the power of the cursed flames is a more primitive and uncontrollable ability.

However, despite Anniel's many explanations of the effects of the cursed flames, Zhao Xu still couldn't immediately awaken this ability.

It was as if his "luck card" had expired and needed to be recharged.

According to rumors, in each era, there will only be one person who awakens the cursed flames.

This means that if Zhao Xu awakens the cursed flames, it would mean that people of the same era as him, such as Wang Qingwei and Eisvehi, would have lost the opportunity to awaken the cursed flames.

Even the chosen ones of the silver flames, only a select few with deep understanding, can reach the threshold of the cursed flames.

At this moment, Zhao Xu walked quietly towards his own house, his mind still thinking about the typical uses of the cursed flames that Anniel had pointed out.

The first use of the cursed flames is to absorb magic spells targeting oneself, similar to the "absorption wand".
Here is the translation of the text:

It is said that the "Absorption Wand" worth 50,000 gold coins is actually a "Spell Magnet" that can absorb targeted spells and store the energy within the wand.

The wielder of the Absorption Wand can use the absorbed energy to cast spells. For example, they can store the energy of a 6-ring spell and a 3-ring spell to cast a 9-ring spell. However, the wand can only absorb 50 rings of energy before returning to its original state as a ordinary wooden stick, making the 50,000 gold coins worthless.

The "Curse Fire" is not as exaggerated as the Absorption Wand. Zhao Xu, who is 27 years old and has an adjustment value of 8, can absorb 8-ring spell energy. However, he cannot cast the spell as is, but can instead shoot out Curse Fire energy arrows, dealing 1-6 points of damage per ring. The remaining energy can be used to heal damage, with one ring healing 2 points of damage.

Zhao Xu thought deeply about the matter, considering that the "Absorption Spell" effect is quite powerful. However, he couldn't understand why the Curse Fire is more advanced than the Silver Fire. Furthermore, it is also the "Key" to something.

As Zhao Xu's mind was filled with thoughts, he soon arrived at his family's luxurious mansion within the city. Initially, he deliberately did not arrange his parents to work at the Spell Association office, but instead chose a nearby luxurious mansion, also considering the larger land area. The Zhao family is not a family that is overly extravagant in their spending.
Here is the translation of the text:

Everyone is a social animal who can't help but be influenced by their environment. As the order of Yánán began to take shape, Zhao Xu's relatives and friends gradually began to be arranged to relocate to the capital city of Yánán. Meanwhile, through interactions with Zhao Xu's parents, who had a different social status, even the most naive person would become aware of Zhao Xu's connection to the legendary "Zhōngxià".

On the one hand, Zhao Xu's parents wanted to live in a warm and lively home, and having everyone live together would make it easier to manage and arrange resources. Additionally, it would also ensure security. Therefore, Zhao Xu initially allocated a large mansion with dozens of rooms for his parents.

However, it turned out that the dozens of rooms were soon fully occupied by various relatives and friends who came to visit. People seemed to have an unspoken understanding, automatically gathering around Zhao Xu's parents' room and gradually expanding their social circle. As the rooms were quickly filled, it became difficult to keep track of everyone, and even distant relatives came and went, looking dejected.

But they refused to give up and instead chose to sleep on the floor in the main hall, even willing to survive on the daily rations. Not to mention that a typhoon was approaching, and no one could predict how long it would last. Even Zhao Xu's relatives, who were normally quite dignified, had to consider the safety of their husbands, wives, children, and elderly family members.

In the end, they packed their belongings and rushed to join the crowd. Zhao Xu's parents, who came from a family with a strong clan tradition, even went so far as to rewrite their family tree not long ago.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

At first, he could only maintain distant relationships through phone calls, relying on memory to keep in touch. However, with the help of the "group", he was able to reconnect with childhood friends who had become distant over the years.

Zhou Xu also realized that his concept of "relatives" went beyond the batch of people he visited during holidays.

As the only child of his generation, he didn't have any siblings. However, his grandparents, parents, and even his parents' friends were numerous. These people also had their own networks of relatives, such as cousins, which was impossible to count.

Zhou Xu's mother was a kind-hearted person who believed that her son's sudden good fortune was a blessing from heaven, accumulated by his ancestors.

She had always done good deeds and accumulated blessings for her son's future. But when she saw the suffering of children, she couldn't bear it. She welcomed relatives who came to visit with open arms.

Ultimately, Zhou Xu arranged for three rows of large houses with over 100 rooms, and the place was fully occupied. Although each room was allocated to a family, with only three to five people, the actual situation was that many more relatives moved in, with 10 people sharing a room.

Before the big storm passed, no one would easily leave the "villa" that was as solid as a rock and would be protected until the last moment.

As long as Zhou Xu was alone, he would make the predictable choice.
Here is the translation of the text:

However, the living arrangement was solved, but the issue of food was another matter.

Initially, the food rationing was based on the number of laborers, and the allocated food was mostly thin gruel and thin porridge.

Even if the villagers, who were experienced farmers, had extraordinary abilities, they couldn't reduce the time spent on sowing and harvesting crops from the soil.

It was natural for Zhao Xu not to have to remind him about the allocation of materials in his family. Under the influence of Zhao Xu's "Military Rations Creation" magic, it was not a big problem for a single soldier to feed three to four thousand people.

According to Zhao's father and mother's plan, each day, all registered relatives would gather together to eat three meals a day, with the food supply open and abundant. The food was top-notch, and everyone could eat as much as they wanted, but they couldn't take it away.

However, in the situation where every family was scrambling to accommodate people, a familiar phenomenon appeared.

Although the unit was officially registered as having 300 people, the actual number of people was in the thousands.

As a result, the welfare distribution was also shared among thousands of people.

At this time, the additional people could still participate in the work of Yangnan and eat thin gruel, but it was far inferior to the daily fixed-point meals in the Zhao family.

Finally, under Zhao's mother's reluctance, each day, each room would pack three meals and send them back home.

As for how to divide the remaining food among the rest, that was up to each family to decide.

Since everyone was taken care of, Zhao Xu was also completely without burden.

In fact, he could even use multiple war magic spells, and it would be no effort at all.
Here is the translation of the given text:

However, Zhao's father, who had been immersed in the business world for many years, directly pointed out that if he really dared to come, he would not refuse, and all the relatives and friends who were being taken care of by each family would also be taken care of together. This would only lead to the snowball effect getting bigger and bigger. The number of people to be supplied the next day would become 3,000, the day after that it would become 10,000, and eventually, even the entire city of Asia would be relying on various connections to supply him unlimitedly. Therefore, the extra food would be allocated to each household according to their ability to take care of how many people with three mouths to feed, which is a matter of their own capacity. Although he also knew that each household would definitely get more than they could handle, he was also willing to look the other way. As Zhao Xuzhi returned to his noisy home, the guards at the outer circle saw him and hurriedly bowed down, showing the deepest respect.

These guards were known to the outside civilians as "Qian Shui Lou Tai" (meaning "the one who gets the moon first"), being able to contact the top existence of Asia at any time. Instantly, several young men who had just finished eating and were sitting at the door chatting and joking, stood up excitedly and shouted loudly. "Xuzhi, have you come?" "Did you take time out of your busy schedule today?" "Come quickly, I'll go call Mother out." "Mother, Xuzhi is back!" For a moment, with the waves of noise spreading, the entire row of houses seemed to be torn apart by the morning cock's crowing, and various sounds of tables and chairs being moved, as if everyone was moving due to Zhao Xuzhi's arrival. Zhao Xuzhi felt a slight headache.

In fact, the people standing at the door, he didn't recognize a single one of them. On one hand, these people were still not old enough to be introduced to him by his parents during his rare homecomings.
Here is the translation of the text:

Every time he returns home, his parents will always put on a show, and they also want to take care of the "outstanding" younger generation. They will eagerly introduce him to the family members.

Standing at the door, these people who are usually idle will naturally not get this opportunity. They can only stand at the door, waiting for the rabbit to come out. But who would have thought that they actually ran into each other?

As for Zhao Xu's personal pace, he is extremely fast. He can activate his "Higher Flash Move" at any moment and instantly switch to the courtyard.

Even if there is a thick wall in front of him, Zhao Xu can pass through it without any obstacles. For these distant relatives who have eaten their fill and are too lazy to participate in the construction of Yangnan, Zhao Xu is also too lazy to educate them.

To be honest, he has somewhat understood the thinking of some aristocratic families in ancient times. Why do they still raise a bunch of family members, despite knowing it's not good?

Although looking at these people, Zhao Xu feels that they are a bit too lazy to work, but with his ability to read minds, he can sense that when they meet Zhao Xu, they are genuinely sending out a joyful intention.

Even the enthusiasm with which they address Zhao Xu's parents is not fake.

It's not like when they're outside, they always think about a few "I can take his place" and "You're just lucky" kind of thoughts.

Of course, the world also has people who are ashamed of their own relatives.

But at this moment, Zhao Xu has opened up too much, even becoming the breadwinner for many people. Naturally, his thoughts will no longer be as narrow-minded as before.

It can be said that the people staying in this house, including those who are eager for Zhao Xu's brilliance to shine even more.
Here is the translation of the text:

It didn't take long for Zhao Xu to arrive in the grand hall. At this moment, his parents were sitting in the main seats, surrounded by his relatives, including some of his more distant cousins. However, only a few of them had the qualification to sit on the chairs.

Most of the young people were still standing at the edge of the hall, their eyes wide with excitement, gazing at the scene before them.

The elder members of the family were also beaming with joy, nodding their heads and even the elderly ladies, such as Zhao Xu's great-grandmother, were smiling from ear to ear, as if they had just experienced the most joyful moment.

This was a far cry from the time when Zhao Xu had quietly returned to his hometown, eating meals with his family without drawing attention to himself.

For a moment, Zhao Xu's near and distant relatives looked at him with warm smiles. "Xu, you're staying for dinner tonight, aren't you?" someone asked.

"Yes, Auntie hasn't seen you in years, and we have a lot to catch up on tonight," another person chimed in.

"It's great that our Zhao family has produced someone like you, who has made our family proud," someone else said.

Even Zhao Xu's family was not one to be outdone, and they were always careful about how they distributed their resources.

As for Zhao Xu's immediate and extended family members, they were the ones who received the most attention and care from Zhao Xu's mother, who was responsible for allocating resources. In fact, Zhao Xu's family was known for their generous hospitality.

Despite the delicious free meal being offered, no one was willing to leave the house. Even those who weren't hungry were punctual in attending the dinner because they knew that staying close to Zhao Xu's parents was the most important thing, and it was crucial for their future.

"Xu, thank goodness you've finally arrived," someone said.
Here is the translation of the text:

As Zhao Xu returned, his mother finally let out a sigh of relief and breathed a deep breath. "Hurry and take a look at your aunt Liu's daughter, what's the situation now?" she asked. However, Zhao Xu's face was grave. He had already seen a girl with a pale face lying on the ground, her breath as faint as a wisp of silk. This was the reason why his mother was so anxious for him to come back and why he had to take half a day off from work.
