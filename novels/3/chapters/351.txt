Chapter 352: The Lawcaster Level 12

The gatehouse of Mistral's city is extremely high, but since its establishment, no human army has attempted to attack this city.

The four-sided stone walls, over 100 meters high, were created by legendary mages using transformation magic, and were strengthened by the power of magic. Unlike ordinary city walls, which are built by manual labor, these walls are even more resilient.

For centuries, the walls have not shown any signs of war or battle. The city seems to be a synonym for peace.

The drawbridge at the city gate has never been raised, and Mistral is one of the few cities that is always bustling at night, with no curfew.

After the three of them converged at the city gate, they directly avoided the crowds and boarded a horse-drawn carriage waiting nearby, heading straight for the town of Frosty, where an old witch dressed as a woman attacked the middle-aged woman.

The carriage's wooden wheels creaked as it rolled over the stone pavement, and the wind chimes on the carriage also produced a clear and crisp sound.

Zheng Xin'an was observing the rhythm of the music, while Elliot was holding his dagger tightly, taking deep breaths to adjust his emotions.

It seemed that they were going to execute a mission that would inevitably result in death.

Zhao Xu thought to himself that since he wanted Zheng Xin'an and Elliot to experience a battle of sufficient intensity, he had to elevate himself to be able to suppress the potential risks that might arise.

He slapped the old witch with a single palm, but it was a bit of a bore.

The journey from Mistral to Frosty was not far, and the carriage could reach its destination in about an hour.
Zhao Xu began to take advantage of this time to cast spells on himself.

First, he released the orange-yellow Arien stone from his pocket, which was then pulled by the gravitational force and began to spin steadily above his head, tracing a path.

Initially, Zhao Xu's spellcasting level was 6, but after undergoing the "Robe" ritual and the Arien stone blessing, his level was directly upgraded to 8 or more.

Next, he took out a red gemstone with imperfections, worth 250 gold coins, and clenched his fist tightly, as if he wanted to crush it. However, with only 8 strength, he couldn't crush it.

Suddenly, Zhao Xu quickly spat out a mysterious phrase filled with magical energy, and drew a pattern in the air with his arm, moving at an incredibly fast speed.

At the same time, he activated his profession ability and incorporated it into the spell model structure.

"Super Magical Control" - Spell Duration!

In an instant, a tremendous amount of magical energy burst forth from Zhao Xu's fist, shattering the red gemstone he was holding. Red powder fell from his fist like sand, scattering on the floor of the carriage.

The intense shockwave struck Zhao Xu's entire body, tearing at his physical body and binding his motor nerves.

【Adventurer Zhongxia, you have used the "Super Magical Control" ability, offsetting the 6-ring spell slot upgrade cost, and taking 6 points of damage to your agility attribute.】

【Adventurer Zhongxia, you have cast the "Physical Sacrifice" spell, reducing your constitution attribute by 8 points, upgrading your spellcasting level by 4 levels, and lasting for 24 hours (originally 1 round).】
Here's the translation:

Two hints, and Zhao Xǔ's physique and agility were severely weakened.

Instantly, his face turned a pale white, and the flesh on both cheeks appeared to shrink.

"Sir?" Zheng Xin Yu and Elliot both cried out in amazement.

Zhao Xǔ, however, waved his hand reassuringly, indicating that he was fine.

Only his arm movements were slow and stiff, as if an octogenarian was waving goodbye.

Using the Super Magic Grip to weaken his agility was intended.

As for the 8-point damage to his physique, it was the price for upgrading his spellcaster level.

Zhao Xǔ had used this 2nd-level spell, "Sacrifice Physique," during his time with Artesia.

This spell, which consumed a 250-gold Red Gemstone, allowed Zhao Xǔ to sacrifice his physique attributes to upgrade his spellcaster level.

As an 8th-level spellcaster, Zhao Xǔ could sacrifice 8 points of physique, not reaching the upper limit of 10 points of physique damage.

However, every time he sacrificed 2 points of physique, he could upgrade his spellcaster level by 1 level.

Therefore, Zhao Xǔ's spellcaster level suddenly skyrocketed from its original 8th level to 12th level.

Generally, ordinary mages and characters typically reach 6th level and 6th-level spellcaster level around level 6.

They rarely have access to the 36,000-gold Aen Stone and the ritual array that can upgrade spellcaster levels.

For Zhao Xǔ at this moment, his 12th-level spellcaster level was equivalent to a doubling effect.

This means that some spells that are determined by spellcaster level, such as duration and damage, were effectively doubled.

However, this spell was not to be spoken of, even if it was publicly acknowledged, as its users were few and far between.
Here is the translation of the text:

Because the "Meat Sacrifice" spell consumes a lot of materials and has a fixed duration of one round, it's not very popular. However, it can be affected by Zhao Xu's "Spell Endurance" specialty, which increases its duration to 24 hours, a 14400-fold increase from the original duration. Many spells that normally last only one round are considered ordinary, but with the boost from "Spell Endurance", they gain a different level of power.

Zhao Xu then uses the secondary restoration spell to remove the physical attribute damage caused by "Meat Sacrifice". After that, he uses the spell to heal the damage caused by using the "Super Magical Control" ability. Since "Meat Sacrifice" cannot be cast when the caster is immune to physical damage, Zhao Xu can only absorb the damage.

After consuming three one-ringed spell slots, Zhao Xu's attributes are restored to normal. The success is also extremely abundant. Meanwhile, for the next 24 hours, he will have a 12th-level spellcaster level and his fireball damage will be stronger than that of a three-ringed mage. At this point, Zhao Xu begins to realize the way to level up the spellcaster level to 70 or above, as shown by "Anshen Niya".
Here is the translation:

He only sacrifices his physical body as an appetizer. When he levels up further, the means of increasing his stats will become even more terrifying. Especially after reaching level 8, when he can cast the evil necromancy spell "Domain of Decline" and kill lives to raise his own level, he can increase his spellcasting level by as much as 50%. It's easy to reach level 20 or above.

"Take off your armor," Zhao Xu said.

"Huh?" Zheng Xin Yi's face turned red, and for a moment, he didn't understand Zhao Xu's intention.

Zhao Xu, who had already reacted with ambiguous words, chanted a spell on the spot. "Group Shield of the Mage."

【Adventurer Summer, you obtain the effect of the "Group Shield of the Mage" spell, gaining "+4" armor value, lasting 12 hours.】
This time, he cast a spell of a few hours, so it didn't provide permanent buffs or say that the spell itself couldn't be sustained.

"Huh?" The two of them didn't understand Zhao Xu's actions, but they could feel that their bodies had acquired an invisible but powerful armor.

"This spell of mine is the group version of the Mage's Shield," Zhao Xu explained. "So the three of us can be equivalent to wearing a formless 'chain shirt'."

After thinking about it, he gave up the three-ring "Higher Mage's Shield" that could increase his armor value by 6 levels and released the same three-ring "Group Mage's Shield" instead.

"Mr. Summer, does that mean I don't need to wear chain armor for the next 6 hours?" Zheng Xin Yi asked.
Here is the translation of the text:

In reality, she is not just a game character who wears a heavy armor and feels the burden of its weight and movement. These are all firsthand experiences.

Players on Earth would never wear armor just for the sake of defense or to feel safe from monsters. "Let me correct you, it's 12 hours."

The duration of the "Mage Shield" spell is 1 hour per caster level, which is a well-known fact among people.

12 hours means that it's a 12th-level caster.

Suddenly, both Zhao Xu's eyes fixed intensely on Zhao Xu.

"I just upgraded my caster level, and you can do the same too," Zhao Xu said with a warm smile.

However, Elliot looked at Zhao Xu with a more respectful gaze.

Upgrading a caster level is indeed not easy?
As a member of the Mage family, he knows that there are many ways to upgrade a caster level, but each one is extremely difficult to obtain.

"Do you know why I gave you the upgrade?" Zhao Xu started to coax the two of them.

"Is it because the opponent's melee attack is very strong?" Elliot tried to answer.

"No, that's correct."
Zhao Xu said as he raised two fingers, "The old witch has at least 12th-level melee attack ability, which can tear apart armor and flesh with great force. This is also the reason I gave you the invisible force armor."

At this time, Zheng Xin'an had already taken off the sacrificial robe outside, wearing a chain armor that weighed over 20 kilograms, and even carrying a heavy load.
Here is the translation of the text:

"On the other hand, the opponent has magical abilities. The most important ones are the 'Weakening Ray' spell, which can weaken one's strength, the 'Magic Missile' spell, which can cause damage, and the 'Sleeping Spell' that can control people. Zhao Xu counted on his fingers, saying this.

"Moreover, the opponent's magical abilities are almost at level 8, so the Magic Missile can deal 2-5 HP damage to each of the four projectiles."

Eliot couldn't help but turn pale, saying, "The Magic Missile might be able to kill me instantly."

The Sleeping Spell and Weakening Ray are ultimately control spells that can force people to leave the battlefield.

However, the Magic Missile is a spell that can instantly kill anyone it hits, regardless of who the target is.

Zhao Xu almost burst out laughing, saying, "I called you here to go on an adventure, not to die. He then pulled out four items from his backpack and threw them in front of the two of them, including the 'Shield Spell' scroll, shield pendants, protective wands, and a brochure for the 'Secondary Spell Immunity' spell.

"These are methods to counter the Magic Missile."
