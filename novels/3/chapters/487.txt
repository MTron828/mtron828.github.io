Chapter 488: The Disappearance of Anzelina

At this moment, Anzelina turned her head directly, gazing at the suddenly appearing devilish lord.

Suddenly, her voice became somewhat urgent and she said, "Don't turn back."

As soon as she finished speaking, Zhao Xu suddenly realized that Anzelina, who was standing beside him, had vanished into thin air.

Her entire body seemed like a water bubble under the scorching sun, and her eyes blinked, leaving no trace behind.

It was as if Zhao Xu was the only one who had entered this cave from the beginning.

"Force Ball!" Zhao Xu immediately gripped the super magical staff in his hand, and in this extremely perilous moment, he unleashed this powerful defensive spell.

Instantly, a faintly glowing force field enveloped him, appearing semi-transparent at first, with layers of energy waves constantly swirling around the ball-like body, resembling a soap bubble that could burst at any moment but was impossible to destroy.

The Force Ball is considered the strongest defensive spell in the Four Rings.

At the same time, it is also Zhao Xu's strongest counterattack spell that he can currently wield.

Currently, Zhao Xu is surrounded by this impenetrable barrier, which will not affect his breathing or internal movements.

Inside and outside this Force Ball barrier, there are two separate worlds.

Nothing can penetrate this ball-shaped barrier!

Zhao Xu had previously experienced this spell on the battlefield, where he and his group of adventurers were hired to capture a rogue evil mage who had escaped from the Four Rings.

According to the intelligence Zhao Xu received before the mission, the mage's magical abilities were almost depleted.

Despite being utterly exhausted, the mage still easily slaughtered ten of his teammates.

Here is the translation:

After that, Zhao Xu saw the evil sorcerer use his last remaining life-saving spell, "Resilience Ball".

At that time, Zhao Xu and more than twenty adventurers were waiting, as there was no mage, and various blades and axes were hacking at the half-transparent ball body, but to no avail.

They dragged on until the sorcerer's reinforcements arrived, allowing the opponent to escape smoothly.

Only the four methods specified - canceling, negating, disintegrating (sixth circle), or target-type dispelling (third circle) - could attempt to dispel the ball body before attacking the person inside.

Like Vivi's staff, which could cast higher-level dispelling magic, was unable to affect the Resilience Ball because it was area-type dispelling.

So, this spell is strong because it can be used to divide the battlefield, control a portion of the enemy, or protect fallen comrades.

For ordinary warriors, this ball body is an existence that can never be solved.

If someone had showcased these spellcasting techniques to a large number of players from the start of the game, even the most stubborn players would give up.

However, Zhao Xu successfully cast this reverse defensive spell and did not relax at all.

He knew that this spell had wasted the opponent's "action" of disassembling, which could instantly make Anzhiya disappear.

He was still thinking of finding a way to counter the opponent's action at the moment.

"Young man, it seems that this is our third meeting," Gratz's enticing voice came from behind him.

Zhao Xu strictly followed Anzhiya's last instructions.

He did not turn back.

Even for the opponent's words, he did not respond.
Here is the translation of the text:

Confronted with a deep-seated evil lord of the abyss who has witnessed the passage of millennia, what more schemes, no matter how cunning and sinister, can be employed against him? These hellish creatures have played out all their tricks.

It is only power that can suppress them, and that is the true victory.

"Oh?"

"Don't respond to me? That's fine, I'll just tell you anyway. As long as you can keep silent, it doesn't matter."

"You, for the first time, took back the soul of Frank's wife from my hands. That gang of trash has yet to compensate me for what they owe me, and I'm still keeping track."

Zhao Xù listened quietly, without speaking up.

Just as Anzuzu had glanced back and vanished from sight, Zhao Xù didn't utter a word.

And Gratz's arrogant words also revealed the nature of the demons.

According to the logic of the opponent, a single bet only means a single victory.

It does not mean that the demons will not attack again.

Not even a contract, for the demons of the chaotic camp, is effective.

They are like a nickname, once they've followed you, they can never be shaken off.

"In the second case, I demand a promise from you. For this, I even sacrificed my elector bishop. As for the demon itself, it is very loyal to me now, but you've had it imprisoned in a dungeon without sunlight. This is the second loss you've caused me."

Even though Zhao Xù had been shielded by Anzuzu's mental barrier, he wouldn't be affected by any mental spells or effects. However, just listening to Gratz's impassioned words made Zhao Xù feel like he was really wrong.
Here is the translation of the text:

He took a few deep breaths, trying to regain his composure and calmness. He even began to control his thoughts in his mind, not thinking too much and reducing the impact. He knew that this was a moment when his "communication skills", "intimidation", and "deception" skills were working together.

"Zhongxia, I'm giving you a third chance. I hope you won't disappoint me this time. Otherwise, my anger will be unbearable."

"I need your promise."

"If you're sure to make this promise, I can even make your avatar a lord of the abyss, controlling one layer of the realm. Think about the immense power, is it something that Anniya can give you?"

"After the magic empire fell, she was only a nominal princess of all the tribes, with a name but no real power. What can she give you?"

"But if you agree to my promise now, even if I don't need it in the future. What's difficult for you?"

At this moment, Gratz's voice was getting closer and closer, as if he was already standing beside Zhao Xu's ear, whispering softly.

However, Zhao Xu remained calm, looking at the shield in front of him. As long as it was there, he knew he was still safe.

"Oh, is it still silent, using silence to resist?" Gratz suddenly sighed.

"I once gave a lucky charm to a fortunate person, a pot that would constantly produce gold coins. Every time you put your hand in, you could take out 1000 gold coins. But the cost was that the fortunate person's friends and family would die as a result. Guess how many times the other person tried it?"
Here is the translation of the text:

"I won't make the moral choice that you devils have set for me."

Zhao Xu suddenly replied.

He didn't need to guess what Glazet would extend to next. For example, if it wasn't someone he knew who had died, how would he make a choice? Even if Zhao Xu started answering "no".

Then, the story model would change, and the "Treasure Pot" would become a "Treatment Pot", and people waiting for his rescue would appear beside him. It would gradually ask Zhao Xu questions to correct the entire story model through fuzzy boundaries.

Once temptation didn't work, these chaotic demons would tend to shatter a person's "idea". This is also the reason why only people with firm beliefs can become a qualified Saint Warrior.

Even Saint Warriors would encounter many moral dilemmas. For example, if Glazet asked a Saint Warrior to eat the corpse of a deceased infant to save one person, how would that Saint Warrior react? If he refused, what would happen to the people in the city?

This moral dilemma is set up through predetermined difficult situations to trap people. Therefore, Zhao Xu refused for the first time.

In the end, Glazet didn't expect that the Zhao Xu standing in front of him, who didn't have the natural human instinct to listen to stories, would suddenly and decisively refuse.

It let out a few dry, forced laughs before continuing to change direction.

"That's it, you don't care about the safety of 'Anzhi Nia'? Just now, I killed her with one hand, and if you hurry, you might still be able to save her. It's possible that she would be forever grateful to you for saving her life."
Here is the translation:

"Oh? Really? Then I'll crush her soul."

"No," Zhāo Xù spoke up, "I don't believe you can do anything to my mentor."

Zhāo Xù still found that he had been hit in the soft spot.

Although he was 99% sure that An Tiè Niā was fine.

However, when facing a "demon king" who had almost reached the pinnacle of power, if this moment was when the opponent personally descended and combined special means to catch An Tiè Niā off guard, the 1% possibility of something happening still existed.

So Zhāo Xù decided to make an effort to make the opponent reveal more information.

"Help me," suddenly An Tiè Niā's voice came, full of pain, as if struggling.

"I'm fine," another voice echoed from the altar, also An Tiè Niā's voice.

However, the voice was coming from inside the force field.

At this moment, Zhāo Xù lightly put down his right hand, which had just struck the resonant point.

He had just used the "Phantom Art" of the zero ring to replicate An Tiè Niā's voice.

It was also to tell Grazzite, a simulation of this voice, this psychological warfare tactic, was of no use to him.

"Interesting. I'm starting to suspect that An Tiè Niā and you have done a joint test against high-level demons."

Grazzite couldn't help but compliment, "I'm curious, why are you so confident that you can't kill An Tiè Niā?"

"To know, only those who have seen the methods left by Ernest for An Tiè Niā have basically been wiped out. Only we old-timers who know her terror."

Zhāo Xù heard this and couldn't help but laugh out loud.
Here is the translation of the text:

Anzhiya also teased him, saying some ambiguous things to deceive him. However, there was one thing she never lied about. She said she could go to the depths of the underworld at any moment, or even flirt with Glaizte, which could achieve this. And with such a powerful ability, it's not something that Glaizte could easily brush off.

He only estimated a 1% chance of this happening and didn't really believe it. It's like everyone has a chance to get hit by a drunk driver who ran a red light, it's just a matter of probability. He also suspected that Anzhiya had simply disappeared for a while, otherwise, this demon could just lock himself up for a few days, weaken his will, and then say it.

"Why do you need my promise?"

Zhao Xu still couldn't help but ask after a long time, which was also a question he had pondered many times.

"This needs to start with a very old story."

Glaizte's voice grew more distant and profound.

"If you don't mind, you can listen to me tell it slowly."
