Chapter 405: Celestial Oddity

Zhao Xu didn't expect that the bait he threw out would be caught so quickly, and even the mastermind behind Sara's curtain would rather give up the rules and halve the price.

In the end, the income from selling it on the black market went to the black market's headquarters. However, the buyer's emotions belonged to the mastermind's personal account, and as long as they had future cooperation opportunities.

Therefore, Zhao Xu immediately accepted the standard price after knowing it was a standard sale.

"Mr. Zhongxia, you really have good eyesight. This necklace has just been put into storage and was originally planned to be auctioned off next week, so it was reported at a price that doubled the previous one."

"After learning that you are an important noble customer, I quickly reported the standard price, and I'm really sorry."

"No need to apologize," Zhao Xu said with a slight smile, implying that he had gotten a good deal.

In reality, the more Zhao Xu looked at the necklace, the more he thought he had made a good profit.

Perhaps the person in charge of managing the storage didn't understand the true value of the necklace because they were not a godly being. The necklace, being a set, could not be broken down and could only be used to enhance the level of the magician's magic. During the initial evaluation and appraisal stage, it became a barrier. Especially since there were two magical beads, and one that ordinary people couldn't use, the summoning bead.

Under such differences, people who liked wind beads couldn't help but abandon them due to the excessive useless beads.

However, Zhao Xu was clear.

When he could cast the "Sacred Word" spell, as long as the magician's level was at least 10 and the life dice was rolled, he would be able to instantly kill without exception.
Here is the translation of the text:

At that time, he had 7 rings, 13th level, 1st level ceremony, 1st level Ayn stone, 5th level physical sacrifice, 4th level pendant, and a total of 24 levels. All 13-life dice below that were under Zhao Xu's spell, and it was all seen to be dead. Not to mention that he could still continue to stack spell levels.

Zhao Xu took advantage of this good feeling and hastily scanned the counter, looking for a suitable target. At the same time, he flipped through the name list on his hand.

In an instant, his eyes narrowed slightly, and he looked at the nearby Salarzi and said, "Is this ring still here?"

Salarzi looked at it and nodded, his voice trembling, "This should be here, but sir, are you sure?"

Because the man in front of him had upgraded at least two levels.

"Bring it over," Zhao Xu ordered.

Within half a minute, the ring was sent from the storage room behind and placed in front of Zhao Xu.

When Zhao Xu saw the magic ring on the cart, he couldn't help but shake his head.

This made Salarzi nervous, "Sir, is something bothering you?"

"Not, just a bit of nostalgia," Zhao Xu said.

This platinum ring had a simple and elegant design, but it was also one of the most expensive items in the black market. If Zhao Xu didn't have a 600,000 gold coin loan limit, he wouldn't have even considered buying it, it was just too expensive.

The ring had three levels: junior, intermediate, and senior. Zhao Xu chose the senior version that could store 10th-level spells, and its price was the most realistic, directly 2 million gold coins.

The ring's biggest use was that Zhao Xu could store spells in it and then transfer it to someone else, who could instantly know the spells stored in it and release them like using a magic wand.
Here is the translation:

He handed the ring to Vivian, and she gained the ability to cast spells. In advanced situations, she could accelerate the casting of spells. Additionally, Zhao Xu could borrow the ring to transfer skills to others, allowing them to cast special spells on themselves.

Zhao Xu felt that this was likely to become Pandora's box. As for the "hand" location, Zhao Xu did not worry much and accepted the recommendation of Sara to buy the popular product "Forger's Gloves".

The gloves' greatest significance is that each round, you can freely store one item in the space between the gloves. The two gloves can store two items. In desperate battles, Zhao Xu can save time selecting their own weapons or wands.

Zhao Xu now has several wands, and though he was interested in this aspect, he decided to spend 20,000 gold coins to solve the problem.

Next, Zhao Xu's gaze turned to his internal and external body parts. However, he soon found himself in a predicament.

The selection of equipment slots was extremely limited. For example, he couldn't wear armor, so there was nothing to say.

Unfortunately, the black market did not have the legendary "Wise Sage's Robe" with a crimson golden fabric. Otherwise, Zhao Xu would have spared no expense to buy one.

The moment he bought the ring, Zhao Xu basically became fearless.

After several rounds of selection, Zhao Xu finally gave up. He suddenly realized that the three empty slots - "hand", "internal body", and "external body" - might not be his destiny yet.
Here is the translation:

Zhao Xu thought about the impending disaster location and turned his attention to the staff, wand, and scepter of the three types. Previously, Anxinyao had given him a shield staff worth 60,000 gold coins to defend himself, and it had indeed saved his life multiple times.

However, the staff's energy had almost been depleted, and Zhao Xu had returned it to Anxinyao. Compared to the wand, which could only store and release a fixed number of spells, the staff was more powerful, capable of storing and releasing multiple types of spells.

Moreover, the staff's incantation costs were also more expensive. For example, Zhao Xu's legendary staff could release an average of 30,000 energy per cast, which could bankrupt a person instantly.

This time, Zhao Xu hesitated for a moment before selecting the only remaining stock of the "Passage Staff" from the black market.

This staff could cast the "Portal" spell (fourth circle, one cast), "Wall-Breaking" (fifth circle, one cast), "Spatial Portal" (seventh circle, two casts), "Higher Teleportation" (seventh circle, two casts), and "Starlight Projection" (ninth circle, two casts).

However, the spells on the staff were not something Zhao Xu could cast in the short term, and through this staff, he also avoided getting stuck in the mysterious building's predicament.

The staff's price was 170,000 gold coins, which made Zhao Xu wince.

After that, Zhao Xu began to purchase magic scrolls on a large scale.

The process left Saraizi, who had been accompanying him, looking stunned.

He couldn't help but feel that, even though he was in a relatively peaceful northern alliance, Zhao Xu had still taken sufficient precautions against risks.

After completing these purchases, Zhao Xu wanted to select some more, but was told that the night market had already closed, and it was almost dawn.
Here is the translation of the text:

He had thought about shopping again, so he decided to come back the next day at 3 am. At that time, he would be led to another area, and perhaps he could find some new and exotic items.

Then, Zhao Xu took out his wizard badge and went to the management office to handle his account savings and loan. After signing his name on several sheepskin papers, his account balance of 100,000 gold coins was cleared instantly. From then on, half of his monthly gold coins would be deducted for repayment.

Zhao Xu felt a bit uneasy, having never been familiar with the concept of gold coins.

After they received their ordered equipment, Zhao Xu and Vi Vi were arranged to sit in a carriage on the street. This time, they changed cars and Sara Zhi pretended to ask Zhao Xu a few questions about his work, which Zhao Xu dodged.

Unbeknownst to them, the badge's owner had been appointed as the deputy chairman of the small town's association.

When they returned to the street, they found that it was still quite gloomy, with no sign of dawn yet.

The winter chill, combined with the approaching dawn, made Zhao Xu shiver, as if he wanted to squeeze out the mist from his body.

The two of them quickly rushed back to their rented room in the inn, considering they would go out at night. They had only rented one room, without thinking much about it.

Luckily, the room had a small window that allowed them to gaze at the distant stars, which was quite cozy.

Zhao Xu sat beside Vi Vi, drinking a warm and fragrant red tea, and gazing at the night sky. At the same time, he was also re-checking his magic scroll and related magic items, preparing for a big battle before the storm came.
Here is the translation:

Vivia is also deeply focused, gently wiping the sacred avenger in her hand, feeling the feedback from it.

They wait quietly, awaiting the anomaly's arrival.

Suddenly, the distant horizon is like a sheet of glowing red embers, illuminating the entire sky with a reddish hue, as if a new dawn has suddenly arrived.

A large and hard meteorite, accompanied by a loud boom and explosive flames, is sliding down to the ground.
