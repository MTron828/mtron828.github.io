Chapter 304: Belonging and Recognition

Before Zhao Xu used his powerful magical abilities, the other party could still understand it as the strength of the staff and scepter, and even compress the casting time, which was only suspected to be a powerful specialty.

However, if Zhao Xu could freely decide on the magical abilities to be used, it would mean that the original restrictions on the freedom of law mages would no longer exist.

The first to protest would actually be the numerous mage players.

Mages typically have four magical abilities per circle, while mages can learn an unlimited number of abilities as long as they can copy them from spellbooks.

However, mages have six magical abilities per circle, and even by the time they reach level 20, they would only have 3-5 abilities. From circles 7 to 9, they would only have 3 abilities, which is quite pitiful.

This would require mages to choose which abilities to learn, and they would need to have extremely high applicability. However, mages often neglect the consequences and can only specialize in one area and cannot be all-around.

Therefore, law mages have never envied the ability of mages to cast spells freely, as they know what kind of price they have to pay.

At this time, Zhao Xu, aside from "Precognition" which allows him to have 6 magical abilities equivalent to his intelligence score that can be cast freely, "Multiclass Mage" also allows him to merge low-level magical abilities into high-level ones at will.

He essentially has two methods of "free casting", and when combined, the restrictions he faces are greatly reduced.

However, Zhao Xu did not dwell on this for too long. He directly gestured for Frost Sword and others to stand back, and only stopped when they were about 7-8 meters away from that suspicious door.
Here is the translation of the text:

From Shao Jian to Chen Nu, and then to the people who followed, everyone's eyes were fixed tightly on Zhao Xu, eagerly expecting him to perform some miracle.

Even the "Five Rings" technique, which can turn stone into dust, cannot solve this problem. Does he plan to use the opponent's staff or authority to solve it?

At this moment, everyone's heart was filled with expectation.

Especially Shao Jian, who had already revealed their location, knew that they had no way to turn back.

Once they leave this area, it's likely that next time they come back, this place will have been thoroughly looted.

The mastermind behind the organization that can mobilize over a hundred goblins and challenge level 11 giants is not an ordinary person. It's possible that they can break through the current situation.

Zhao Xu slowly walked in front of the marked brick and took out a small hammer and a bell from his backpack as a spellcasting tool.

Then, he quickly recited the incantation and performed the spellcasting gesture, completing the spell in just a few seconds.

The iron hammer in Zhao Xu's hand began to shine with a golden light as the spell took effect. Zhao Xu immediately seized the opportunity and vigorously struck the bell with the small hammer.

Suddenly, the calm bell began to produce a buzzing sound, which reached a climax in an instant and then dissipated, creating a high-frequency wave that made people in the distance cover their ears, but without causing any harm.

After the wave of sound dissipated, everyone's gaze was redirected to Zhao Xu. However, they were shocked to find that the ground in front of him, within a circle with a radius of five meters, had been completely pulverized into a vast expanse of blue bricks, which had been carefully arranged and stacked into a flat surface.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

The stone bricks, which were originally as hard as steel, suddenly turned into powder, causing Zhao Xu to suddenly find himself standing on dusty ground, his height reduced.

However, the hidden pit that was previously concealed has now been revealed.

In reality, the first spell to break through is the "sound wave" spell from the Plastic Energy system.

Although there are biological organisms that are immune to sound waves, the number of such organisms is much smaller than those that are immune to fire, so it can be a viable attack method at times.

Zhao Xu had just cast the "Crush the Ground" spell, which is a three-ring spell in the Plastic Energy system. Currently, Zhao Xu can cast this spell to cause 7-28 (7D4) damage in a small range, with the side effect of crushing the stones and wood inside the area. However, the basic damage of each level of this spell is only 1-4 points, lower than the 1-6 points of the Fireball spell. Moreover, the spell can only cause damage to the area around the caster, unlike the Fireball spell which has a range of 120 meters, increasing by 12 meters per level.

As a result, although the sound wave system is less constrained, the "Crush the Ground" spell, which is also a three-ring spell in the Plastic Energy system, is ultimately suppressed by the Fireball spell.

This is also what Chen Nu did not hear of this spell from the beginning, let alone think of applying the sound wave energy to crush the ground evenly.

After Zhao Xu finished casting the spell, he immediately signaled everyone to come and observe the hidden pit that had just been revealed.

After Zhao Xu showed off his skills, especially when everyone watched him slowly put the spellbook back into his backpack, it was clear that the spell he had just cast was his own spell, which had directly broken through the ground.
Here is the translation of the text:

The wizard's face turned cold and expressionless, as if he didn't want to explain anything further. Everyone seemed to suppress their curiosity, and refocused their attention on the exposed underground chamber.

However, it was only when the explorers approached that they discovered the entire surface had been shaved off, exposing a half-meter square space. A leaden box lay quietly at the bottom, waiting for its moment to resurface after a hundred years.

The two explorers didn't seem excited, but rather carefully checked their surroundings to ensure there were no additional traps. They then carefully lifted the box using a pair of tongs.

As the explorer gazed at the leaden box, he spoke softly, reciting the words recorded on the surface: "To my descendants, the secret buried beneath this lead box is a thousand-year-old secret. If you don't have enough power, I hope you never open it, as it will only bring disaster to our family. If you must obtain it, then the wizard's tower is the only help I can offer you. May my magic be with you always."

After finishing his words, the explorer glanced at the long sword on his side, receiving a nod of confirmation from the other party. He then gently opened the entire box.

Inside the box was a black-bound notebook. The explorer took a glance and didn't dare to open it rashly. Instead, he handed it to Chen Nu for examination and then passed it to Zhao Xu.

At this moment, Zhao Xu, without hesitation, directly took the notebook containing information about the wizard's tower and the wizard himself and began to exchange information with the wizard.

But little did they know, the notebook containing all the secrets of the wizard's tower's mechanisms and construction suddenly flew out of Zhao Xu's hand, straight towards Zhao Xu's direction.
Here is the translation:

The book finally fell into Zhao Xu's hands, motionless. This sudden turn of events left everyone stunned, especially since the opponent was a mad wind sorcerer, which made even the warrior who should have drawn his sword hesitate to act rashly.

"What is this, Mr. Wind?" Shiyue asked with a difficult-to-conceal expression.

This was indeed a scene that seemed to mimic the moment when the protagonist finds a treasure and the villains appear.

For a moment, the air in the spacious hall seemed to freeze, as if it could burst into a battle at any moment.

However, Zhao Xu seemed to have grabbed a hot potato, hastily trying to hand the book back, saying, "The sorcerer's hand can only handle that unknown object. My previous action was not intentional."

"Was it flying on its own?" Shiyue asked.

"I don't know," Zhao Xu replied, taking two steps back and handing the book back to Shiyue while keeping his hands empty to prove his innocence.

Even if it was a divine artifact, Zhao Xu couldn't bring himself to commit such a shameful act in front of others.

His personal moral standards were not something that could be measured by a divine artifact, let alone a god.

Just as Shiyue was about to open the book to examine its contents, the notebook suddenly shook violently.

This time, Shiyue had made sufficient preparations, shouting loudly and hugging the notebook tightly, refusing to let it slip away.

However, the flying notebook suddenly released a massive and powerful force, sweeping across the area and dragging Shiyue towards Zhao Xu.

"Let go," Zhao Xu exclaimed, seeing Shiyue being pulled away, "first release your grip."
At this moment, Frost Sword didn't have too many thoughts, and directly let go, suddenly losing control of the notebook and flying straight forward. Then, it made a full circle of 180 degrees in the same spot and landed steadily in front of Zhao Xu's face.

It was as if from the beginning, after it had separated from the lead-lined iron box, it had completely belonged to Zhao Xu.
