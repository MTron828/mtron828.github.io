Chapter 8: The Scholars of the Scroll

Zhao Xu gazed at the majestic and lofty floating city hovering in the clouds.

Even though he had heard about the mystical and magnificent place known as the Magic Capital of Mistral in his previous life, Zhao Xu's heart was still racing with excitement.

The Arthus World possessed supernatural powers that were beyond human comprehension, including magic and divine powers.

However, for ordinary people, their most reliable sources of power were still the original forces of human, water, and animal power.

As a 5th-level warrior who was on the verge of death, Zhao Xu was considered a top-level fighter in a small town.

However, in his 10-year adventuring career, he had only experienced teleportation a few times.

The ancient empire's sphere of influence was limited by communication methods.

In the Arthus World, the lack of transportation tools meant that almost everyone's range of activity was limited to the distance their legs could carry them.

Even players in the Arthus World were not immune to this limitation, as teleportation was a 5th-level arcane spell.

Although it did not have the side effects of a 5th-level revival spell, only 9th-level or higher mages or clergy could cast such a spell.

Those who could cast 5th-level spells were mostly found in large cities, where they could find various professional organizations.

Ordinary mages who wanted to conduct research would usually hide in unknown locations to avoid distractions.

Those who were poor and lived in the mountains had distant relatives, not to mention the Lord of the Law.

The floating city above Zhao Xu's head was actually a research site for mages.
Here is the translation:

The Floating City is extremely high in the air, and it is basically only possible to reach it through teleportation portals or teleportation magic.

Zhao Xu's previous life was mainly spent in the Northern Region, and even after a six-year period of wandering and struggling, he had never come to Mistral, the sacred land of wizards.

At that time, most of his activities were limited to the Northern Region, and he had lived his entire life within his own city.

Zhao Xu's guild, which was composed of students from the same university, was divided into areas based on their hometowns.

As a result, Zhao Xu was astonished when he realized that he was in Mistral, a city in the south.

He had essentially become isolated, and as a result, he couldn't receive help from his classmates while doing tasks, leveling up, and fighting monsters.

It wasn't until he reached level 5 that he could become a true wizard, and at that level, he could cast level 3 spells.

Before reaching level 5, he wouldn't have been too skilled.

The only reliable support he had was his priest profession, which he also possessed.

At least his spell slots had increased significantly, with a twofold increase in quantity.

Zhao Xu then carefully read the recommendation letter, which included a rough map of the city, with his current birthplace marked.

After taking a closer look at the map, Zhao Xu discovered that the headquarters of the wizard's guild in Mistral, known as the "Gate of Magic," was actually located next to the cathedral of the magic goddess Sylvana and the main temple.

He thought for a moment and it seemed reasonable. Sisilvina, after all, was the mighty power of the legendary mage's achievement.

Even many high-level mages who were unknown to the world would worship the magic goddess and consider her the first and pioneer of the magical path.

Zhao Xu gazed at his reference letter, starting to feel a sense of unease.

This magic academy was considered the best on the mainland.

Not to mention the legendary mages who were as common as dogs, even top-level mages in big cities were rare to see. In this place, they should be as common as dogs.

Meanwhile, most clerics were training at the temple, and he was also recommended to the Sacred Heart Cathedral for cultivation.

In China, it's not uncommon for someone to receive a special recommendation.

Zhao Xu knew that the person who issued the reference would give a higher level recommendation if he was more suitable for the initial professional training location.

However, the two reference letters pointed to places that couldn't be described as high-level, but rather top-level.

It's no wonder that the street was not crowded with players, because not many people had reached the required level to be sent here.

Even a year later, few players could set foot in Mistral.

As Zhao Xu quickened his pace, the pedestrians on the street began to increase gradually.

Various shops for mages and adventurers, such as magic shops, scroll shops, and material shops, slowly became more concentrated.

Occasionally, a group of guards dressed in dark blue and black robes would ride horses and gallop through the street, patrolling the entire city.

Gazing at the opponent's dark blue and black robes, Zhao Xu slowly recalled who they were - the Magic Guardians of Mistral City.

This was the only team in the Arthurian world's main plane that could afford to use mages as guards.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

The advanced profession has always been a dream for countless players in the game. Especially for mages, advancing to an advanced profession is rare, as it requires a significant amount of contributions and prestige. A player once spent a great deal of effort to accumulate enough prestige to advance to the "Spell Guardian" profession in Mysterra. After doing so, the player wrote a post summarizing their experience in two words: "Giving up". The post exposed Mysterra's reputation among the mage community, and it spread far and wide.

For Zhao Xu, being in Mysterra, the capital of Azeroth, is the most beneficial for him to advance his profession, including some secret inheritance of basic professions that cannot be learned elsewhere. Zhao Xu's list of specialties is still empty.

As Zhao Xu walks, he also searches his bag. Eventually, he finds two badges at the bottom. He picks them up and looks at them. The text on the badge reads: "Mysterra/Occult Gate/Apprentice/Summer". Zhao Xu lightly touches it and realizes that it is a secret silver material, which can reduce the failure rate of magic spells when worn with armor. The higher the level of defensive magic, the higher the failure rate of all magic spells, making it a popular choice among the mage community. The other badge is the honorary badge of a novice priest, with a polished and transparent mirror-like surface inscribed with his identity and name.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhou Xu also brought many players who had undergone professional training for a period of time, only to find it was not suitable for themselves, or were still uncertain about their career path. They usually pursue other training at the same time.

After all, one must finally meet the requirements, and the system will only recognize the 1st-level profession.

Before that, it doesn't matter how many professional trainings one has undergone, as this is also the reason why the system directly selects professions.

Don't think too much, just try it.

At this moment, Zhou Xu's thoughts were completely concentrated on the two badges. They gave him a sense of quality, was it really a magical item?

Arthur's magical items, most of which require identification to know what they are.

However, not identifying them will not affect their use.

For example, this kind of attribute-enhancing item, if worn for 24 hours, will take effect.

He didn't think about it, and the next day, he could see the attribute values on the panel.

But Zhou Xu suddenly slapped his forehead, +2 Strength attribute equipment, priced at 4000 gold coins on the market. In remote areas, the price may fluctuate.

How could the system possibly give him 8000 GP?

Zhou Xu thought about it and continued walking towards his destination. However, he did not know that.

It was only in the Hall of Creation that the statues of Lawmakers and Clerics would shine with light, allowing players to obtain the two badges at the same time.

The owners of these two badges, born in Mistral, can become Arthur's most mysterious foundation profession, the Scroll Scholar, a magical version of the Mage.
