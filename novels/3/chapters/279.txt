Chapter 280: Idol

As Zhao Xu confirmed the plan, he didn't move again. Even though the undead zombies below began to move, he remained as calm as a meditating monk. However, Lark looked at the slope, nearly 80 degrees and almost as steep as the wall, and couldn't help but hesitate.

The undead zombies in front were sacrificing their vanguard to act as a buffer, and the main force was basically following them, running down the slope without much trouble. However, they were still in the tunnel entrance, lacking the buffer of undead zombies in front, and it would be no different from jumping off the building.

The original undead zombies that were kneeling on the ground also started climbing back to their original tunnel entrances, rushing forward and easily drawing attention to themselves.

If the opponent was an intelligent immortal being, the "Immortal Veil" would not be reliable, as the "Fearful Spirit" had already discovered Zhao Xu's true identity.

However, if they continued to drag on and the undead zombie army returned to their nests and climbed back up the tunnel, Zhao Xu would be immediately blocked.

After some thought, Lark felt a hint of anxiety: "Master, it seems we're back in a difficult situation again."

Zhao Xu, however, remained calm and comforted Lark: "No, I think the current situation is actually very good. At least we've clarified our goal by seeing the 'Obsidian Coffin.' Once we're close to the temple, we can do some investigation and find them, so at least this time we won't lose. And if we can get our hands on the 'Divine Fragment,' that would be an unexpected bonus."

Zhao Xu's thoughts and feelings are very clear, and they are also within his own judgment range.

"Lords, don't you have any desires for divinity?" Lakshmi suddenly felt astonished, "Or are you unable to comprehend the power of the gods?"

"No, Lakshmi," Zhao Xu suddenly revealed a hint of nostalgia in his eyes, as if he had experienced rebirth.

After the mass migration, the gods who truly manifested their divine power showed how they could subjugate the entire Earth's forces.

In reality, when people witness true divine miracles happening in front of them, most people's beliefs will be shaken.

Even the priests of the gods, who can only perform a three-circle "remove illness" spell, will have a grateful and reverent attitude, which will quickly spread.

Who can guarantee that they will never rely on divine healing for the rest of their lives?

Among human beings on Earth, except for a few people who have received higher education and have their own independent beliefs, most ordinary people, like the common people of Arthur, have a fanatical faith in the gods.

Even some people who have migrated from Earth to show their devotion have become more fanatical than the followers of Arthur.

"Rakshasa, if you lower your expectations, you will still be delighted when you reap the rewards," Zhao Xu gave Lakshmi a motivational speech.

Most tragedies in the world are caused by the mismatch between expectations and reality.

This is also the reason why Zhao Xu has been able to maintain a tranquil and contented state of mind.

"But, lord, what if they come back?" However, at this moment, Zhao Xu directly leaned out of the wall and lay on the precipice, not sliding down towards the bottom, but instead continued to climb upwards.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Oh, okay, let's climb up." Lakshmi suddenly exclaimed, "Wait, how did we get to the sky?" They had clearly found a sealed stone door in the wilderness and were about to embark on an adventure in an underground city. However, a time-space anomaly occurred, and they found themselves in a cliffside, having walked over a thousand meters through a corridor in the underground city.

If they had just walked another kilometer in the wilderness, they would have seen a deep pit and, eventually, the "Sleeping Land" monument. However, Lakshmi was initially distracted by the "Amber Coffin" that suddenly appeared from nowhere and didn't notice this unusual phenomenon.

Zhao Xu then quickly chanted a spell, "Wall Crawler," to help himself climb the wall. After five minutes, the spell ended, and they were still too short.

Meanwhile, countless "Flesh Eaters" were crawling up the cliffside, trying to return to the corridor. Only the "Shadows" could fly back quickly. Occasionally, they could hear Flesh Eaters falling from the cliffside because they lost their grip, but they were immediately trampled to death by other Flesh Eaters.

Lakshri then began to wonder about the scenery at the top of the cliff. Not far from them, what lay beyond the sky? "Lakshri, be prepared to defend yourself at all times and be ready to transform your godly artifact," Zhao Xu said calmly, as if nothing was beyond his emotional range.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu did not try climbing when he was on Earth, and he didn't feel anything when he was crawling horizontally in the tunnel just now. But when he started climbing near-vertical cliffs, he finally felt the power of his own abilities.

With the enhancement of his 20th-level skills, Zhao Xu's entire person seemed like a seasoned rock climber with decades of experience. Every time he saw a protruding rock or a crevice where he could insert his fingers, his mind automatically constructed a diagram of how to climb.

Even his 8-point weakness was directly cancelled out by the enhancement of his skills.

"Lakshmi, sometimes I feel like you wizards are just too overpowered," Lakshmi said.

At this moment, Zhao Xu was almost at the top of the cliff, his eyes filled with determination.

Wizards can also use their skills to reach extremely high levels.

So, this profession is even more deserving of the title of "Master of Skills" than the "Wanderer" profession, which has a wealth of skill points.

"Lakshmi, this is because we can take one path and find countless possibilities," Zhao Xu said, already having climbed to a distance of several meters. He suddenly used all his strength to push off, and directly flipped over.

At this moment, Zhao Xu had flipped over completely, looking at the green meadow in front of him with a look of astonishment.

At the far end of this meadow is a giant statue, sitting at the end. The statue is wearing a scale armor, over a hundred meters tall, its face serious, looking at the distant horizon, and its hands holding a giant sword, as if ready to strike at any moment.
Zhao Xu was taken aback because the statue before him was not the statue of the Grim Reaper, Nagi. "This is the God of Slaughter, Edmond," Lark said. Zhao Xu reacted instantly.

Edmond was the male protagonist of the renowned novel "The Path to Becoming a God" that was known throughout the continent.

This God of Slaughter was the prisoner who, through the guidance of the Grim Reaper, Nagi, had mastered the Grim Reaper's divine power and eventually became the new generation's "God of Slaughter".

However, they had just seen the statue of their opponent on the rocky wall surrounding the "Land of the Slumberers". Zhao Xu was almost certain that he had broken the curse on the "Stone Gate" and directly entered another dimension.

Otherwise, this enormous statue, almost as tall as a hundred feet, would not have gone unnoticed in the forest.

Each church has its own statues of varying sizes, shapes, and sizes, corresponding to the legends of various gods mentioned in religious scriptures. Such a massive statue is rare in the headquarters of any church.

This statue represents the arrival of a god who can accommodate the will of the divine.

"Lord, is this?" Lark asked, her expression filled with concern, "Perhaps it means that this God of Slaughter has been in this semi-plane for a long time and has obtained the divine power of the Grim Reaper?"

However, Zhao Xu's eyes were crystal clear, and he walked slowly towards the statue, eventually reaching the bottom of it.

It was as if he had been summoned, and Zhao Xu stretched out his hand to touch the toe of the statue.

Instantly, the entire statue began to vibrate.
