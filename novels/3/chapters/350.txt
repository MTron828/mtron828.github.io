Chapter 351: Trials

After listening to Zhao Xu's words, the few novice pastors who had gathered to join in the fun looked at each other in confusion.

Are they too strong?

As professionals in their own right, the pastors and mages had already known that these two professions had reached a level of strength worthy of praise in Arthur. Now, this person who had defeated the demon, was saying that their strength was excessive and far beyond their imagination.

"So, let's say," Zhao Xu smiled and said, "for combat professions, stacking up professions won't bring much benefit. However, for mage professions, because it involves leveling up the caster's level, it can sometimes be busy. You might not be as strong as a pure pastor or pure mage."

For example, the pastor's "dispel undead" ability, its strength is determined by the level of the pure pastor profession. So, if you're just a 1st-level pastor, facing some powerful undead creatures like ghosts or zombies, you won't be able to dispel them at all."

Zheng Xin-yuan nodded slightly, "So, it means we can only barely dispel some low-level undead creatures like skeletons and zombies?"

"No, that's right," Zhao Xu replied.

It seemed that Zheng Xin-yuan, who had been busy leveling up during this period, had also been continuously enhancing her knowledge of the game's system.

"Yes, go confirm the details with the other side," Zhao Xu instructed Zheng Xin-yuan, "and then we'll go together at the agreed-upon time."

Since Zhao Xu had become an "upper-level" person, he could now freely order others to do tasks, and many small matters no longer required him to take care of personally.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zheng Xin Yu heard the words and slightly bent her body towards Zhao Xu, and then returned to her seat together with the other novice pastors.

As they gradually moved away, a gossipy female pastor turned to Zheng Xin Yu and asked, "Xin Yu, what did you and Xu discuss just now?"

Zheng Xin Yu finally revealed the content of her conversation with Zhao Xu.

Instantly, the others pretended to be displeased, saying, "Wow, Xin Yu, your charm has even mesmerized this 'NPC' instructor, and he deliberately took you on a task to create a stir."

"No, I didn't," Zheng Xin Yu hastily denied it.

"Hey, why didn't he bring us along? You want to know what happened after the 'NPC' instructor, Ekira, was attacked by a phantasmagoric monster? After that, he would always exchange pleasantries with his students and didn't even bother to acknowledge us," the female pastor teased Zheng Xin Yu, intentionally provoking her.

"It's clear that Xin Yu's charm is excellent," the female pastor said with a smile.

As it turned out, everyone roughly understood what Arthur meant by "NPCs", which did not have the concept of completing tasks to receive rewards.

It's not uncommon for them to receive rewards directly and straightforwardly.

However, she did feel that there was something strange about it. When she touched the instructor, Mr. Summer, who led them as novice pastors, she couldn't help but think of a mysterious man who had given her a "game activation code" in the past.

The two of them shared similar personalities.

The only difference was that Mr. Summer didn't like to chat with everyone, and after class, he would suddenly disappear.

Strictly speaking, today might have been the most extensive conversation they had since they met.

Recalling some notes she had read about pastors, she even suspected that this strange phenomenon was caused by "faith".
Here is the translation:

Zhao Xu sat quietly in the corner of the pavilion, watching the lively and playful girls laughing and playing. However, he couldn't help but smile slightly in his heart.

After reaching level 6, he realized that his stay in "Mistra" would not be long.

Before leaving, he needed to make a good arrangement for his only "pastor".

Although his energy was weak, Zhao Xu felt a growing sense of "faith" from the other party after accepting the "pastor" education.

However, he was not brave enough to expand the number of pastor personnel, and could only arrange the "Death God" as a "spare chess piece".

To truly exert his immortal influence, he might have to wait until he became a legendary mage.

Next, he needed to notify his chosen "follower", Elton, who had brought a talisman with a sand-filled pendant that Zhao Xu had entrusted to him earlier.

At this moment, Zhao Xu squatted down and picked up a handful of sand, imagining the image of the target he wanted to communicate with in his mind.

Slowly, the sand in his hand began to heat up, and then jumped up.
Here is the translation of the text:

In a classroom at the Academy of Literature, Elliot was still following the daily lesson plan and teaching as usual. However, he suddenly felt a strange sensation in his chest, as if his pendant had vibrated. The next day, he followed the mysterious teacher to the Sacred Heart Cathedral, but he couldn't get close to the events that unfolded. As the news spread, Elliot began to understand just how extraordinary the events were.

The next day, he returned to class, where he found that his classmates who were not ordinary were excitedly sharing stories about the Sacred Heart Cathedral. Elliot felt a mix of emotions. It was as if he was reliving a legend that he had heard again.

Later, Elliot learned from Mr. Rayan that Mr. Zhongxiao had defeated the evil bishop, while Mr. Rayan's spell had failed. Mr. Zhongxiao had even used a handful of sand from the roadside and inserted it into the pendant, giving it to him. Elliot kept the pendant close to his chest.

Years later, Elliot finally received a signal from the pendant. He immediately picked up the pendant and put it to his ear. The pendant transmitted a series of "wind and sand" sounds, but soon, Elliot recognized the voice of Mr. Zhongxiao.

"Today... afternoon... you will go to..."

Elliot rushed out of the classroom, listening to the instructions from the pendant while responding to it. His heart was racing rapidly.
Here is the translation of the text:

He knew this was his chance to shine. After the communication was over, he finally put down the talisman, but his eyes were fixed on something else, and he couldn't help but mutter to himself, "Is this the power of a master with a way in?"

The "Short Message" spell was clear to him, but the spell could only send a short message of no more than 25 characters. However, Mr. Zhongshu, with just one "Sand Whisper" spell of the three-ring level, had established a communication channel with him from a distance.

Even if he was a descendant of a wizard family, he had spent a lot of time searching for information on this spell, but he couldn't find any. It was a secret spell passed down through generations.

This realization immediately made Elton's heart tremble. He deeply realized that his instructor's background was far beyond his imagination.

...At noon, Zheng Xin and Elton gathered at the city gate according to their agreement, along with Zhao Xu.

Although the old witch had transformed herself into an old woman using her "shape-shifting" ability, she was still afraid to easily enter Mistral, a place without a reliable rear guard. Without a reliable rear guard, these monsters were extremely difficult to sneak into Mistral without being discovered.

The "transformation" ability that seemed to deceive others was of no value in the eyes of the high-level wizard who had mastered the "spell of protection". Zhao Xu looked at the two of them, who were fully equipped according to his instructions.
Eliot, due to his profession, is not skilled in armor-making and therefore wears a simple robe with no defensive capabilities. Meanwhile, Zheng Xin'an, who has trained in armor-making, has only mastered the "medium-armor" level and has not reached the "heavy-armor" level. However, she is wearing a lightweight armor called the "Chain Mail Shirt".

Although this armor weighs over 20 pounds and is the heaviest in the lightweight armor category, it provides the best defensive capabilities, "4th-grade" armor enhancement. Compared to the "Scaly Armor", which also provides 4th-grade defense, the Chain Mail Shirt is 50 gold coins more expensive. However, it has fewer restrictions on skills and speed, making it a popular choice.

Eliot wearing the Chain Mail Shirt is not unusual, and Zheng Xin'an, who has only played the game for over 10 days, can afford such an item. Without the blessings of "Wang Congwei" and "Eiswisch", it's surprising that Zheng Xin'an can afford it.

"Ha ha, my savings are quite abundant," Zheng Xin'an said with a blush.

Zhao Xu listened quietly, not saying much.

After all, in his previous life's memory, Zheng Xin'an's disposable income is not small. Spending money on the game is just a form of entertainment expense, and it will all be waste in the end.

"Ah, then I'll brief you two first," Zhao Xu reminded the two of them, starting to brief them.

At this point, Zhao Xu himself would not be able to defeat the "Old Witch" monster alone.
After Zheng Xin'an's arrival in the Earth world, she will naturally accompany her friends to complete ordinary tasks such as defeating "Goblin-like" monsters. With the "Kai" ability from her home world, she can easily handle ordinary monsters. Therefore, Zhao Xu originally planned to verify the faith route, but he also added a new goal, allowing Zheng Xin'an to experience higher-level Arthurian monsters, which are of what level.
