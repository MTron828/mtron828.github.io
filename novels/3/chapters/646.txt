Chapter 647: Journey to Hell and the Abyss

As Zhao Xu demonstrated his third "Divine Art" technique, the aftershocks caused by his display continued to linger, spreading rumors among the players and civilians who witnessed the scene. Meanwhile, the atmosphere in the entire Ailan camp was becoming increasingly tense.

The dark clouds in the sky were growing thicker, resembling a canvas being painted by a beginner, with layer upon layer of colors blending together into a dark mess, making it impossible to distinguish anything. Even the rainclouds were so dark and dense that they blocked out most of the sunlight.

The entire wilderness felt like it was stuck in a perpetual twilight, as if it was still in the gray area between dawn and dusk. Zhao Xu had shifted his focus back to Ailan, pouring all his energy into it.

After just finishing a high-level discussion meeting, even Zhao Xu, who was usually full of energy, couldn't help but massage his temples. The high-level meeting in Ailan was attended by the vice chairmen of various departments, with a total of less than 100 people, and fewer than 30 people who were qualified to speak. These individuals were all former Earth elites.

Players, even with their attributes amplified, could only rise to the level of vice leaders at most. This was not unusual in Ailan, as many administrative personnel were not adventurers in core professions. Civilians, nobles, mentors, and experts were not in short supply.

It was only the warriors and rulers who held the real power.

The joint meeting of the council just concluded, with each department presenting its difficulties in preventing the recent heavy rainfall and proposing solutions. However, none of these proposals were without flaws. Meanwhile, the responsible personnel were faced with the urgent need to respond to the requests for help from the various districts, with some even dispatching personnel to stay in the districts to handle public relations.

This situation also made Zhao Xu feel a bit troubled.

At this point, the federation was led by the federal system, with the capital as the main center of power, governing the various districts under its jurisdiction.

However, Zhao Xu had already experienced the contradictions between the "central" and "local" authorities.

Each district was crying out for the central authority to provide support, while the central authorities were reflecting their own policies and unable to implement them.

Moreover, due to the limitations of "technology", despite the daily dispatch of messengers between the capital and the various districts, the news from the distant districts often took two to three days to arrive.

The outdated communication methods had already begun to restrict the power of the entire federation. This issue was also evident in the ancient maps of the imperial dynasties.

However, Zhao Xu had a plan to resolve the issue, so he was not too anxious.

"Governance of a country is far more complicated than we thought," he said.

Wang Jingwei also looked puzzled, with a thick stack of files waiting to be reviewed in front of her.

At this point, the large meeting hall was almost empty, with only seven or eight waitresses standing by, waiting to attend to the two individuals.

Even though the entire federation lamented the lack of manpower and construction workers in the face of the heavy rainfall, the personnel allocated to the core associations were still adequate, and the daily food consumption was astronomical.

Whenever Zhao Xu sees this scene, he can't help but sigh, wondering how power can corrupt most people, except for those who are free from desires and worldly attachments. "Let's get through this difficult moment first," Zhao Xu comforted himself.

"The situation will only get better as we accumulate our strength. Every punch we throw will be full of sharpness."

He gazed at the "Yanan" map hanging above the conference hall, saying that in the past three weeks, Yanan had grown from a small, insignificant place to the first force in the vast wasteland, with a population of over a billion.

Although most people were still just nominal rulers, with actual power concentrated in a single hand.

But they had finally gotten through the initial turmoil, and the various camps under Yanan's rule had restored basic order.

However, this rapid growth had also made Yanan seem "fat and flabby," not a steady and stable growth.

"After weathering the storm, we'll focus on ourselves, starting to remove these redundant issues," Zhao Xu said.

He and Wang Qingwei both knew that their strength was ultimately limited, as more and more personnel were promoted to the core management layer of Yanan, with countless unofficial relationships emerging.

At the same time, because of this "apocalypse," the clan forces were growing increasingly difficult to suppress.

In the end, only family members were the only reliable ones. Even the most foolish players understood that family was their strongest backing.

"Yes," Wang Qingwei nodded, her expression serious.

"We've exhausted all our strength, and almost all our resources have been allocated for flood control and disaster relief. Whether old or young, everyone has been mobilized to participate in collective construction."

"But I still have some concerns in my heart," Wang Qingwei said, looking at Zhao Xu with a helpless expression.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhou Xu smiled calmly, "Don't worry, I know these problems and will solve them."

Although the entire Yannan region is a flat plain, no one can predict the sudden accumulation of rainwater that cannot be quickly drained away. Then, the areas with low-lying terrain will be the first to be destroyed.

If there are many dead bodies after the disaster and the accumulated polluted water spreads out, it is likely that the entire camp area will be infected and die from diseases.

The unique and terrible diseases in Yannan are no less deadly than those on Earth, and some cannot be treated with medicine, but only with magic.

"There will be a group of pastors from several big churches entering Yannan soon, and this problem will be alleviated at that time," Zhou Xu said.

He also couldn't help but think about the bottleneck in treatment.

Rescuing countless civilians and diseases relies on the number of pastors, even if he can provide "magic wand"-type supplies, it's still necessary to have someone who can cast spells. Ultimately, it still falls to the pastors.

"Ah," Wang Qingwei said with a hint of embarrassment.

"What's the matter?" Zhou Xu asked, standing up to leave.

Wang Qingwei slightly tilted her head, "It's about Yu'er."

"What's the problem?" Zhou Xu was surprised.

Since Yu'er was revived by the goddess of magic after death, she had already fallen to level 1 due to using the "Revival Spell" several times earlier. And after being revived by the divine power to suppress the power of death, her body was weakened. For the time being, she could only rest and not participate in adventures.

This period of time is also Zhou Xu's last chance to think about the "God of Death's Seal".

"It's not Yu'er's problem, but rather that of a certain mage."
Here is the translation of the text:

As King Weiwei spoke, she also revealed a shy expression, "A mage player, but I don't know how he awakened his bloodline's arcane power."

"Oh?" Zhao Xu's interest was piqued when he heard this.

"That mage has mastered all sorts of pink magic, including joyful illusions, spring dream magic, and the like," King Weiwei said.

Hearing this, Zhao Xu almost lost his footing, "Is he causing trouble for Allowance?"

"Not really causing trouble, but he was reported by a knowledgeable player before he even got close, and then he was beaten up by the guards and locked up," King Weiwei said, furrowing her brow, "Before Allowance got into trouble, he had been imprisoned for a long time."

Knowledgeable player... Zhao Xu had heard of this pink mage's exploits before, and now he couldn't help but scratch his head.

Perhaps it would be more accurate to call him a "red-blooded player".

In fact, the players in Arthur's world are all weird and wonderful, and this legendary "pink mage" may have learned these pink magic spells from excessive use of yellow oil in Arthur.

It's worth noting that these pink magic spells are not part of the core sequence, and even mages can't awaken them. Zhao Xu had seen these spells in the "Final Scroll" and knew they were effective, but he had never used them himself.

For example, the spell "Unbutton and Remove" can make the target creature shed all non-magical clothing and armor, which has some practical applications in battle.

However, spells like "Summon Bed Partner" and "Unbreakable Sword" are only suitable for 18+ audiences.

Therefore, these spells have been locked away in Zhao Xu's mind, never to be used once. When calculating the number of spells he knows, Zhao Xu always quietly skips over these spells because he doesn't feel comfortable talking to others about them.
Here is the translation of the text:

Although he has the ability to use "Divine Magic", otherwise, after lending out the magical book, someone might accidentally see the record of this magical spell and it would be impossible to explain. The abnormal seal will firmly imprint on his body, leading to his social death.

This pink mage from the previous life also sparked a commotion in the player community, or rather, broke through the limits that players had imagined for the game.

Theoretically, the pink mage who mastered these magical spells had no combat power whatsoever.

However, the pink mage accumulated a significant harem, including elves, cow-headed people, and fox women, under the guidance of a beautiful and charming guide.

Zhao Xun turned King Arthur into a legendary warrior, while the other party turned him into a 18X King Arthur.

However, the player who only focused on accumulating a harem was criticized by angry players for a while.

Later, the account expired due to the special account that was only valid for nine months, and the player had to re-register the character, returning to his original mage form and losing his initial fame.

It seems that this life was a mistake due to Zhao Xun's influence, causing time compression to 8 months and solidifying the pink mage account.

However, it is clear that the other party's heart has not changed, and he is now eyeing the beautiful human fox spirit, directly kicking the steel plate and being imprisoned for a period of time.

It can only be said that the other party's luck is great, and the divine god only relied on the chain explosion to kill the demon lord, catching Ragnarok off guard, and then using the demon lord's life as a pawn to drain Ragnarok's temporary energy.
Here is the translation of the text:

A pink-clothed mage who has no combat strength would undoubtedly be directly sensed and killed by Lirien on the spot. Zhao Xu thought to himself and continued to take steps, preparing to leave this hall.

"I'll go see him when I get back," he said.

Perhaps no one knew about it. However, Zhao Xu was clear that these pink magic spells all came from a peculiar pink dimension. Conveniently, his "Super Sculpting Spell" was also a product of that world.

Perhaps through the other party, he could understand the "origin" of his strongest advancement as a mage in history.

"...Ready?" Anzizo looked at Zhao Xu and said.

At that moment, the two of them were standing on the highest tower in the city of Yulan, surrounded by wind, and it seemed that they could touch the layer of dark clouds above. Below them, there were countless people constantly moving and working.

Facing the impending big rain, they were all working hard to build, trying to finish the construction before the rain came.

Zhao Xu had already fully equipped himself, with all his magical items undergoing meticulous maintenance and repair.

"Yes," he nodded, "I'm now in a state of Level 1 combat readiness."

"That's fine," Anzizo's eyes narrowed slightly, also satisfied.

Zhao Xu had mastered many spells, and theoretically, he could continuously cast spells on himself every moment.

However, this was not necessary and would only make him exhausted.

So, Zhao Xu divided his preparedness into three levels, with the lowest being the third level, retaining only the necessary Buff spells and melee combat spells that gave him near-combat abilities.

The more he went up, the more spells he would hang on.
Here is the translation of the text:

While in a state of high alert, Zhao Xu had already brushed up on most of his magical skills. Others might spend an hour meditating to prepare their magic, but Zhao Xu was able to cast a self-buff spell within an hour. Who would dare to take a glance at Zhao Xu with his "Detection Magic" at this moment? He would be blinded by the intense light, tears streaming down his face.

"Teacher, do we really need to go all out this time?" Zhao Xu asked, "Is it just to retrieve the secret left behind by Ernest?"

But Anniya revealed a mysterious smile. "Zhao Xu, your experience this time entering the underground cave has made me realize something."

"Uh?" Zhao Xu couldn't help but feel curious.

"What I mean is that you're still too weak," Anniya said, sighing and wiping her forehead as if she couldn't bear it. Her charming eyes also flashed by Zhao Xu's eyes for a moment.

"Teacher, I've outputted around 8,000 damage in close combat," Zhao Xu complained, feeling a bit frustrated.

"I'm not referring to your damage output," Anniya said, wiggling her fingers.

"In reality, you managed to kill that artificial god with a single hit, which is also due to the opponent's overconfidence in their static panel. They thought one round of recovery to full health would make them invincible."

"Even at that time, they were intentionally giving you a perfect output opportunity, trying to make you surrender."

"What do you mean, teacher?"

At this moment, Zhao Xu's heart was as clear as crystal, but he was still unable to understand Anniya's out-of-this-world thoughts.

"My intention is that before entering Ernest's secret,"
Here is the translation:

"I'll have to create something first, your static panel, although it can't compare to the artificial god, but it has to be able to fight and resist in order to progress."
"While the first step, we'll start from the most basic attribute brushing."
As Anitsuna spoke, she confidently raised her hand and pointed to the distant horizon, "The first stop --- the Abyss."
