Chapter 620: Ancient Weapons, Paradise for Humans

Zhao Xushi hesitated for a moment, then looked up and said, "Is it a wooden stick?"

As he spoke, he turned his head to prepare to take out the weapon from his backpack, but he suddenly remembered that he had just received the "Magnetic Field" restriction.

Of course, the two spatial items he possessed, the "Dimensional Bag" and the "Howard Convenience Bag," had lost their connection to the "Second Dimension" and had become two ordinary bags. Moreover, they were empty.

The old man, Weng Bufei, instantly understood Zhao Xushi's intention, and his gaze subtly condensed.

Zhao Xushi immediately felt the weight of his backpack and the dimensional bag on his waist return.

The ability to freely manipulate the magnetic field in this space also made Zhao Xushi re-evaluate his understanding of the opponent.

However, he quickly reacted.

This magnetic field, in essence, was targeted at Weng Bufei, who was unable to use the nine-sword system.

At this time, Zhao Xushi was also taking out his long-term mainstay weapon, the "Force Symbolic Staff," which could be translated to "Wooden Stick" in terms of weapon systems.

A naturally magical weapon, the +2 Wooden Stick was priceless in the current wilderness. Just relying on the +2 weapon, it could be valued at a thousand gold coins.

"Not bad, I haven't seen such a weapon in many years," Weng Bufei said, gazing at the Force Symbolic Staff in Zhao Xushi's hand.

For a mage, the staff was even more meaningful, as it could consume the mage's spell slots and release the fixed spells within the staff, such as fireballs, spell nullification barriers, and the like.
Here is the translation of the text:

For Zhao Xu, the most incomprehensible thing about this staff is that, after activating it with a one-ring spell at a cost, it will have twice the killing power for a whole round of time. "Besides, I also occasionally use the 'Lightning Long Gun' spell, which creates a spear-shaped beam of light," Zhao Xu added. This lightning long gun can automatically extend and retract like a like a magic staff, allowing it to switch freely within a range of zero to six meters.

The key point is that the power of the long gun comes from the mage's intelligence rather than strength, which is a blessing for countless mages who try to engage in close combat. After being hit by the lightning long gun, the opponent's force field spells such as mage armor and shield will also be suppressed.

Therefore, many mages who try to engage in close combat consider the "Lightning Long Gun" spell when choosing weapons. "The two weapons you mentioned are not bad, but if you want to succeed in the Nine Swords system, you'll need a real sword," Zhao Xu said. Generally, the best way for a Nine Swords system apprentice to cultivate is to let the opponent use a traditional weapon, relying on the inherent rhythm of the traditional weapon to gradually absorb the essence of the style.

At this moment, Zhao Xu also had a moment of realization, and he directly cast his gaze at the traditional weapon "Transcendent Way" leaning against the old man's back.

Is this staff the one he's been practicing with? "Ah, how nice," the old man shook his head, "With your dual elite profession system, you've reached level 10 in both spellcasting professions. How many more resources can you spare for the 'Nine Swords' system?"
Here is the translation of the text:

"The purpose of spreading the Nine Swords system is to choose individuals who can spread the entire system and let the glory of the Nine Swords continue to shine even after the Eastern Empire is destroyed. Therefore, the target individual must be a 'Sword Master', a 'Warrior', and a 'Crusader' at the same time, and must have advanced to the level of 'Nine Swords Master'."

"You?" Wén Bùbài glanced at Zhào Xù with a light smile, and his voice echoed through the empty square, sounding very serene.

"Unless you can master both the Taoist and the martial arts paths and become a Nine Swords practitioner, I won't consider you as a spreader of the Nine Swords."

Zhào Xù hastily waved his hand, and the light of the Taoist arts weighed heavily on his shoulder, making him feel pressured. He didn't dare to ask for anything else and hastily said, "Old master, no need to be so polite, just normal will do."

"Hmph, you seem to have some self-awareness, take it," Wén Bùbài said, stretching out his withered and emaciated arm, which had also become old and frail.

Wén Bùbài then drew a long, sharp sword that emitted a fierce glow and suddenly thrust it into the ground in front of Zhào Xù.

The sword was plain and had no decorations, except for a simple cloth wrapped around the hilt. The sword was designed for close combat and was a pure killing instrument.

Zhào Xù narrowed his eyes.

The sword, also known as a "Single-Handed Sword", was a type of single-handed, close combat weapon that belonged to the "Alien" category of weapons. It was not suitable for general warriors who were used to wielding a variety of weapons. Only those who had specialized in the "Sword Master" profession could master it.

However, the sword was also a popular choice as a secondary weapon, and it could be used as a main weapon in close combat.
Here is the translation of the text:

As a warrior, if you don't plan to wield a heavy sword with both hands, then you don't need to specialize in it at the expense of your other skills.

"This is an ancient weapon, known as the 'Paradise of Humanity'."

After mentioning the name, Wén Bùbài suddenly became serious and stopped describing it in detail.

Zhāo Xù asked quickly, "What about the next step? How do I activate the ancient ritual?"

At that moment, Wén Bùbài had already crossed his legs and sat in a meditation-like posture, with his eyes closed. "If you know, then you should understand that these things are something that can only be grasped by oneself."

"What do you mean?" Zhāo Xù said, feeling that something was off.

"This ancient weapon is something I got by chance, and I know nothing about its origins or abilities. It was only through the ability of the Nine Swords Master that I sensed its existence. It's not bad for beginners, and even comparable to the 'Way of the Ancients'. That's why I gave it to you."

"Well, you also have the 'Power Symbolic Rod' and don't need a heavy sword. So what abilities does it have, and what's the relevance to you?"

After hearing Wén Bùbài's philosophical words, Zhāo Xù almost had a mental blackout.

As for fighting, you don't need this heavy sword, but how can you deeply understand the essence of the Nine Swords style?

Ancient weapons are just ordinary magic weapons at first glance, but only when you activate the "Ancient Ritual" do they reveal their true value.

In general, ancient weapons can grow with the character's level and gradually develop new abilities.

The abilities developed through the weapon are the most critical three rituals: "Initial Ancient", "Middle Ancient", and "High Ancient", which are specialized in obtaining initial, middle, and high-level skills for the weapon itself.

As for the rituals, besides consuming mental energy, they also consume a significant amount of money, which is priceless.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

"Just like the iron heart passed down through generations that Zhao Xu heard about, the "Heaven's Heart" ancient weapon, it is not a relic that can activate ancient abilities, but a "+1 Secret Silver Fine Sword" similar to the "+1 Heavy Sword" in front of Zhao Xu.

However, after completing three ancient rituals, it gains new combat skills such as "Dreamy Sword·Cyan Jade", acceleration, intuition avoidance, and action flexibility, as well as time stopping (20th level). However, the process of awakening is quite exaggerated.

The initial ancient ritual, "Fearless Effort", requires stealing a weapon from a higher-level strong person and activating the ritual with 1500 gold coins and materials.

The intermediate ancient ritual, "Dragon Fire Refining", is to survive the fiery breath of a high-level or identical giant dragon and pay 13,000 gold coins in materials.

The advanced ancient ritual, "Hopeful Terminal", is to find a mysterious iron factory in the celestial realm, meditate for 24 hours, and then use 39,000 gold coins in materials to reforge the weapon.

These methods may seem tedious, but at least they provide a direction.

As for the "Paradise of Humanity" in front of him, the old man doesn't reveal his words to him.

How does Zhao Xu know how to obtain these intermediate and advanced ancient specialties (Paradise of Humanity)?

Zhao Xu is also feeling a headache.

There is another skill in the knowledge system called "Martial Arts Knowledge", but he hasn't invested any points in it.

This skill requires basic training and levels to be determined, so even if Zhao Xu can reach level 60-70, he is still powerless and needs to go back and upgrade his basic martial arts knowledge to level 1."
Here is the translation:

"All right, it's clear that you know where the specific direction is, so you can figure it out yourself." Wang Feng looked at Zhao Xu'er with a thoughtful expression and immediately made a definitive statement: "Actually, you want to get out and break through the seal of the demon king's device, but first you need to learn the 'War Edge' (Military Way Sword)."
"What do you mean by War Edge?"
