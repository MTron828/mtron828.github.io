Chapter 703 Bottomless Domain
"The Lord of the Abyss?"
Zhao Xu repeated with a puzzled voice, this character, which has never existed since Arthur founded it.
It's like the "King of the Gods," everyone feels like it should appear.
But it definitely won't appear in his generation.
Because, such a powerful existence that surpasses everything, must not have been born at this moment.
"Yes, it is waiting for the Lord of the Abyss to return to His throne," the voice of the void in the land of prayer continued to echo.
"Including the entire blood battle?"
Zhao Xu, afraid that the whole topic would turn into a dead end, asked from a different angle.
The endless battle between the devils of the nine layers of hell and the demons of the bottomless abyss, which almost caused a shitstorm, has been going on for countless years, and can be said to involve huge energy and strength on both sides.
Some scholars once speculated that if the abyss and hell, both belonging to the evil camp, could really set aside the rift between the "chaos" and "order" camps and work together with one heart.
Then it is really not impossible to storm the mountain of heaven, capture various goddesses alive, and bring them back as concubines.
On the battlefield of the blood battle, the scorched earth seemed to be irrigated with the blood of countless demons and devils, resulting in a bright red and scorching surface.
Countless strong people, captured by the abyss demons and thrown into the battlefield, would basically not be able to survive for a few days.
Because this battle has no rules, no negotiations, and no possibility of negotiation. It is a battle to completely annihilate the opponent.
There is no agreed ceasefire and rest time, all time is waves of war machines exchanging, wearing down each other's strength.
Just like on the battlefield of World War II, after setting up a machine gun for strafing, using human lives to fill the trenches.
If there is not a deep power behind the entire campaign, constantly giving birth to demons, no one can withstand this kind of burning.
If all of Arthur's forces were united, they still couldn't resist the consumption.
At this time, the land of prayer let out a sigh.
"This is the trick of Asmodemos, used to block the unification of the abyss."
"If the abyss has no external enemies, then its enemy will be itself, all the great demon lords will turn their focus to the unification of the abyss, in this way, the abyss will welcome the return of its true master."
Rarely hearing the voice of the void, saying several more words.
Zhao Xu nodded in understanding, also beginning to realize the depth of this game.
Damn, he felt too hot to handle even as a foot soldier, let alone a standard-bearer.
In an instant, several years flashed through Zhao Xu's mind.
Could it be that the recent attack on the abyss by the Heavenly Mountain was also a way to prevent it?
They don't want the abyss to welcome its true master?
It should be noted that with the power of Asmodethils, as the lord of the Nine Hells, although each layer also has a devil lord responsible for guarding, they are all like foot soldiers, replaced by the will of the lord of hell.
And under the influence of the order camp, the demons' internal discipline is completely unified and well-organized, and it is not an exaggeration to say that they can move as one.
And in the bloody battle against the abyss, the demon lords are just fighting each other, it's a dog-eat-dog situation, with no one having the upper hand. This stalemate has lasted for many years. If the abyss truly dominates, where else is there room for other planes? No wonder it's such a big deal! However, Zhao Xu noticed a loophole in the words of the prayer land and continued to ask, "So what you're saying is that the owner of the abyss is not actually determined?" "We're just waiting for one demon lord to take the lead and make the others submit," Zhao Xu asked. He thought that these demon lords didn't need to conquer land like in the ancient unified China, causing constant warfare like in the end of the Three Kingdoms period. It's more likely to be a model like that of Xiang Yu during the late Qin Dynasty, where everyone just submits. In fact, as long as the territory under their control exceeds one third, becoming the biggest faction, and there are no comparable enemies nearby, the difficulty is greatly reduced. Including the wild lands of Yanan, he also had this idea, letting Yanan become the leader first, instead of trying to take over everything at once. However, the prayer land let out a sigh. "No, we are just waiting for the return of the lord of the abyss, not for the victor to become the lord of the abyss." "Otherwise, the will of the abyss can choose any favorite and they will automatically have the ability to control the entire abyss." Zhao Xu also nodded, this was true. If they give up their current faction and wait for a new one to rise, the other side really has the confidence to do so. If the abyss really favors a certain demon lord, all the demons born would belong to it. Compared to the relationship between Corilon and the elves, he is the main god of the elves, their greatest belief, the father of the heavenly realm.
Here is the translation of the text:

The abyssal will is the ultimate fate of these abyssal evil demons. When its will finally descends, the creatures created by it will betray their original "Lord" first. The topic should stop here.

Zhao Xu thought to himself, feeling that asking further would lead to forbidden topics, especially since he knew too many secrets about the abyss. It's possible that Ennoia would arrive soon, and he wouldn't be able to leave this place. Zhao Xu had no interest in living in the abyss, even if the demon sisters performed for him every day. However, his curiosity was burning like a flame, and he continued to ask.

"Has the Lord of the Abyss appeared?" he asked.

"It has appeared, but it hasn't returned yet," the Wishing Ground replied.

Zhao Xu thought to himself, "I know now, can I leave?"

In reality, he didn't know why he was here or how he ended up here.

"Not yet," the Wishing Ground suddenly said, with a sense of urgency and solemnity.

This time, the sound waves carried an urgent and heartfelt tone.

"You can hear the ancient song of the abyss, which means you are the chosen one, the catalyst for the appearance of the Lord of the Abyss. Therefore, we need your help."

"What help? There must be a price to pay," Zhao Xu said, feeling a sense of responsibility weighing on his shoulders. However, he didn't hesitate and asked again.

"This Wishing Ground, how can I give up my flesh to get something?" he asked.

"You've already received the gift," the Wishing Ground replied suddenly, "Now it's your turn to fulfill your obligations."
"Where?" Zhao Xu questioned in disbelief.
"Just above your 16-point power," the voice from the void remained cold.
"Hey hey, did you not mention equal exchange from the beginning? I proposed it and you should just satisfy it, I was just testing." Zhao Xu suddenly felt a little confused, not wanting to be taken advantage of.
This rare place of wishes was too wasteful to be used to achieve such an increase in attributes. Most of these things Antinoya could have done for him. Now this "place of wishes" that seemed to be closely related to the Lord of the Abyss, if he really wanted to ask for help, he could easily negotiate and give up a few million demon armies, right? It didn't have to be too high-end, he didn't even expect a Baloyan Demon at this level. A slightly lower-level Six-Armed Serpent Demon would do, with a challenge level of a dozen or so, he could make do with it. How could it be exchanged with just a few simple wishes? Not to mention the only "legendary belt of +12 strength" worth several million, which he had returned without secretly keeping it for himself. And the most important 80th level Scroll of Extracted Power, he had paid for it himself. If he gave a little advantage, it wouldn't be a good deal no matter how you looked at it.
"Let me reintroduce myself, this is the place of wishes."
"Hmm?"
"Anyone who makes a wish in the place of wishes will have their wish granted."
"However, when the wish reaches a certain level, it will be tested. You will be able to hear the immortal song of the abyss, proving that you can help the return of the Lord of the Abyss."
"So, the place of wishes is offering you a 'wish'."
Upon hearing this, Zhao Xu really felt a bit annoyed.
"What if I don't agree?"
He immediately spoke with a firm tone, and his eyes showed a fearless and determined look, as if he would rather be shattered than be compromised.
Of course, when the knife was really put to his neck, he would still obediently submit.
However, he simply said, "After all, I wasn't clear from the beginning, so this is not mandatory."
"But if you don't agree, then the power of the will of heaven and earth will no longer favor you."
"What do you mean?" Zhao Xu felt that this was a big deal.
"It means that you will lose the ability to use 'wishful thinking' from now on," the voice replied from the void.
This?
Is this too much?
Will I be punished for not obeying?
Zhao Xu was angry at first, but then he thought it was reasonable.
Especially since he hadn't reached the ninth circle yet, he couldn't use "wishful thinking" at all, so it didn't affect him at all.
However, he had a vague feeling of "illusion" deep down.
It was more serious than "she likes me".
It was as if it was saying,
If he didn't agree, he would definitely regret it for the rest of his life.
At this moment, Zhao Xu calmed down and began to rethink everything that had happened.
He replayed the scenes from the moment he entered this mysterious space.
He wondered if he had fallen into any traps during this process.
Although Zhao Xu knew from the beginning that this was the land of wishes, in reality, he was just probing and didn't dare to overstep at all.
It can be said that his initial actions were carefully considered decisions, and upon reviewing them, he couldn't find any fault.
Finally, Zhao Xu nodded and said, "Tell me, what do you want me to do—"
But at the moment he was about to agree, his words suddenly stopped in his mouth.
Because he saw the hourglass around his neck.
The sand did not fall from the top of the bottle to the bottom.

This necklace is the "Time Recovery Amulet" given to him by Anniya initially.

The sand in the hourglass-shaped bottle will turn over and start flowing down once it has all fallen to the bottom, due to the magical effect. However, if he activates the time-stopping spell, the sand will stop flowing, and the rapid flow will be extremely slow, similar to molasses, with the illusion that time is not passing. This seems to indicate that time is distorted here.

Zhao Xu looked around at the completely dark and desolate space, unable to bear the sight, and added a hint of strange atmosphere.

From the beginning, he had no idea where he was.

In his mind, there was no layer in the depths that satisfied the current condition.

If he hadn't sensed the chaotic aura here, he would have doubted whether he was still in the depths.

Zhao Xu raised his hand directly, "I agree, but before that, I'd like to make a request."

"What?" This time, there was no distraction.

"What is this place?" Zhao Xu emphasized.

"Do you really want to know?"

"Not."

"But you've actually realized that the depths are rumored to have a layer where time stands still."

Indeed.

Zhao Xu sighed inwardly!

According to rumors, the depths have a layer where time almost comes to a standstill.

This means that any living being that enters will experience centuries, but when they leave, the outside world will only have passed a moment.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

However, no one has ever thoroughly surveyed the depths of the abyss, so no one knows where this layer is located. But he, Zhao Xu, got lucky and stumbled upon a portal by mistake, and surprisingly, he ended up exactly in this layer. And this layer also has a more crucial identity!

It's no wonder that the demonic lord who hangs the heavens didn't follow him, as he encountered an existence above him.

"I'm wrong, I'm the embodiment of the bottomless realm, the boundary of the abyss," he said.

It is rumored that the bottomless realm is the final destination connected by the seams of the deep abyss, a place that no demon has ever entered.

It is said that the scholar Ahham once read the "Tome of the Abyss" here, which contains all the secrets of the abyss, and wrote the "Black Scroll" series, recording the countless secrets of the abyss and demons. As a result, he was pursued by the demons.

Some scholars believe that this place holds the opportunity to become the master of the abyss.

Oh, Zhao Xu sighed.

Time has stopped flowing here, which means one thing.

Anastasia is unable to come to his rescue.

From the outside, Zhao Xu is still in the "next moment" that has not arrived yet.

It's like the turtle and the rabbit racing, with a difference in speed of 10 times.

The turtle fires a shot 10 meters away, and the rabbit follows 10 meters later. The turtle runs 1 meter, and the rabbit is still 1 meter behind. Then the rabbit runs 0.1 meters, and the turtle runs 0.1 meters, still behind by 0.1 meters.

Then the rabbit runs 0.1 meters again, and so on, in this extreme distance, the rabbit can never catch up to the turtle.

Zhao Xu took a deep breath, "So what do you want me to do?"

At this moment, a sudden and fierce storm and a vast void wave emerged around him, making the entire large space seem like it was about to be overturned!
"Accept, the master of the deep abyss, this position."
