Chapter 087: Magical Trap

However, Zhao Xuan knew that before taking action, he had to do some psychological counseling for the team, otherwise, this team wouldn't be able to move forward.

Things that can be restored, such as lost life, are not scary.

For example, as long as the team has a priest who can restore life, everyone can face death without fear.

Zhao Xuan looked at Feng Ye, whose face had also turned pale, and comforted him, "Don't worry, it's only permanent if it's not dispelled. The third-level spell 'Remove Curse' or the fourth-level spell 'Break Seal' can terminate this effect."

"Report this to the nearby temple and they will give you a blessing to dispel this curse," Zhao Xuan said.

However, Zhao Xuan didn't mention the rest of the conversation, which was that the underground leader, Isis, wanted to cover up this place and would give a generous reward, including helping Feng Ye remove the curse.

It's hard to conceal this from the team with a priest like You You, who is very difficult to conceal.

After hearing Zhao Xuan's words, Feng Ye finally let out a sigh of relief, and the faces of the people around him also became less gloomy.

This is the fate of a warrior, to bear everything in front of them.

"In addition to the curse, there is another effect that is even more terrifying, which is that there is a 50% chance to slow down or be unable to act every round," Zhao Xuan added.

Hearing this, everyone suddenly couldn't imagine what it would be like to only be able to move around for a while and then collapse.

Without saying anything else, they at least had to retreat for the time being.

"Why not go back and change people?" suggested the poet Qing Wa.

They had only been in for half an hour and could easily go back and replace someone else to come in.
Here is the translation of the text:

"We've already reached the pinnacle of our team's strength," Maple Leaf said, standing up. "It's nothing, just a slight decrease in life points. It's not a big deal."

He patted his chest, indicating that even with only 8 points of vitality left, he was still a resilient warrior.

Zhao Xu thought to himself that, in addition to losing 3 points of toughness, he had also lost 3 points of fortitude, making him at a disadvantage when facing fortitude checks.

However, Maple Leaf was right. As a level 1 warrior, he was still much stronger than those outside.

"This is the confidence of the eleven basic occupations," he said.

"Shall we now dispel this magical trap?" Rainbow Wanderer asked, eyeing the stone block behind the altar, which had just been struck by a yellow light.

If his search skill had been stronger, the system might have warned him about the trap.

"Wait a minute," Zhao Xu said, noticing that everyone seemed to be at a dead end, unable to pass the trap.

"I'll use my 'Detection of Hidden Doors' spell to take a look," he said. "If there's no special trick, we'll just give up on this place."

Just then, the two wanderers checked the altar again, but this time the trap was activated, making it riskier to check further.

Zhao Xu didn't have the habit of seeing a trap and feeling compelled to dismantle it.

At this point, everyone scattered to the sides to avoid disrupting Zhao Xu's spellcasting.

Zhao Xu directly activated his "Multitasking Mage" ability, using the two zero-level divine magic slots in his mind as fuel, and began to chant incantations and make spellcasting gestures.

After completing the "Detection of Hidden Doors" spell, Zhao Xu felt a strange sensation in front of him, within a conical range of about 20 meters.

In an instant, he saw the outline of the hidden door in front of him.
Here is the translation of the text:

However, Zhao Xu continued to maintain his full concentration, and his focused skills began to feed back energy, helping him to maintain this state.

The detection of hidden doors is related to the growth of detection time, and the more information obtained.

Time ticked by, and everyone quietly watched Zhao Xu, waiting for the result of his spell.

After this period of time, Zhao Xu had become a true expert in their team.

A while later, Zhao Xu finally stopped his spellcasting actions, let out a gentle sigh, and turned around to say, "There is indeed a hidden door here, and it can only be opened by pressing the stone block."

Everyone thought deeply for a moment.

"The entrance to the underground city is behind this hidden door," said Luo Ya, lowering his head in thought, with a hint of another kind of inspiration in his eyes.

As the wayfarer Hil, who was standing beside Luo Ya, looked straight ahead with a scowl on his face, he said, "I'll try it."

"Be careful," Luo Ya cautioned.

Hil, the wayfarer, rummaged through his tool bag and walked up to the front, keeping a certain distance from the magical trap.

Just then, the player Qingyun, who had not searched for this trap, followed him and crouched down to observe.

"Qingyun has learned the 'Disarming' skill, right?" Zhao Xu whispered to Yu Yu, who was standing beside him.

"Yes, Qingyun is very quick to graduate. He's almost graduated from our Stormwind Adventurers' Guild," Yu Yu replied.

Zhao Xu couldn't help but smile at this.

If it really could be disarmed, he would have saved a lot of energy.

Just then, Hil suddenly pressed Qingyun and pulled him back, saying, "Don't try it."
Here is the translation of the text:

The rainbow, seemingly out of nowhere, hurried over to see the tragic state of the maple leaves. Everyone was hesitant to take any rash actions, knowing that this was a trap. The entire team, including Zhou Yu, took a few steps back, with Zhou Yu almost bumping into Zhao Xiu, who whispered apologetically.

It wasn't until they were about three meters away from the trap that Hill said, "I just got lucky and managed to figure out the trick, and the result is extremely high."

"Is it disarmed?" Luo Ya shouted, his voice filled with excitement.

But Hill shook his head, "Actually, I just realized I failed. This kind of trap is too difficult, and even disarming it is uncertain. So I won't try again, including you."

As he spoke, he looked at the rainbow. The rainbow nodded glumly, acknowledging that the trap was too difficult, even for someone who got lucky. Zhao Xiu wasn't surprised.

After all, it wouldn't make sense to set up a trap that an 11th-level adventurer couldn't even touch.

Zhao Xiu took a few steps forward, keeping a safe distance. "Luo Ya, are you sure you want to go in?"

Luo Ya, who had planned to have the maple leaves retreat and consult with the leader, was taken aback by Zhao Xiu's words.

Although Hill was only a 1st-level adventurer, his equipment was the highest level in the team, which was why he had brought Hill along. He looked at Zhao Xiu incredulously and asked, "Sir Zhou, do you have a plan?"

Zhao Xiu nodded, "Yes, it's just that you need to spend some money. This is a consumable magical item."

This is an exception to the adventurer's code, where using a spell slot is a responsibility. But using a consumable item would require the team to account for it.
Here is the translation:

"There's no problem, even if we can't get in, we'll compensate Mr. Zhongxia for the equivalent value of the Star Fragment. If we can get in, we'll calculate it separately." Luo Ya assured.

This is also a temporary task he received, otherwise, with Isis's level of attention, even the spellcaster and magical items will be prepared for him.

Star Fragment? Zhao Xu thought for a moment, and he had never heard of this power's name in the past ten years, but it doesn't matter now that the additional gains have been obtained.

Zhao Xu gazed at the magic trap ahead and directly pulled out the "Protection Wand" given to him by Anzhi, which originally cost 65,000 GP, but the residual magical energy is currently uncertain.
