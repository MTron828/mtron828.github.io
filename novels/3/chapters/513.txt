Chapter 514: Mysterious Organization, Shadowy Veil

"Have you heard?" 

A druid player wearing a leather armor sat at a wooden table on the street corner, communicating with a few companions around him.

As time passed, players who initially chose the "druid" recommended profession also gradually left their forest hometown and entered the city.

These nature-worshipping, powerful individuals who could manipulate raging storms and dawn sunlight, as well as the mysterious abilities of forest beasts, began to show off their strength to players in other towns.

Slowly but surely, the "druid" profession could transform into a fierce animal fighter, bringing along animal companions and casting spells to participate in battles. The popularity of this profession was also rising rapidly in online forums.

The half-human, half-beast player sitting next to the druid player had a cruel smile, his sharp fangs flashing, "Just now, I heard that the Summer Sorcerer didn't leave any trace of using his mysterious abilities, and directly made all the high-ranking officials in the Star Town tremble with fear."

"I estimate that they won't dare to provoke the top-ranked player in the short term."

The half-human, half-beast player sneered, stroking his waist where a finely crafted giant axe was attached. The axe's blood groove had turned dark red, indicating that it had been used to test the freshness of blood.

"Is that so?" The druid player's tone was full of surprise, "Those high-ranking officials are not ordinary people who have never touched magic. They must know that they are using magic spells."
Here is the translation of the text:

"Fear is likely a four-ring spell fear spell, and it just fits the opponent's 7th-grade identity. They want to cast it silently and noiselessly, and they need to combine it with 'Spell Mute' and 'Spell Fixation' expertise. The opponent would need to use a six-ring spell slot, which is simply impossible."

"But even if you use a super-magical staff, you'd still need to combine it, and it's impossible to cover both."

Saying this, the Druid player looked at the half-orc barbarian player and asked, "Were they holding something in their hand at the time?"

"This, I don't know?" The barbarian player looked back, his eyes fixed on the fiery figure of the tea shop owner.

"Ah, men," the Druid player sneered.

The barbarian player immediately became defensive and turned his head away, saying, "You Druids just worship nature and are bound by traditional oaths, and you don't use metal weapons, but that doesn't mean you're not interested in women."

However, the Druid companion who was sent to assist them by the organization didn't respond, continuing to keep her head down, hiding her entire body in her cloak.

The barbarian player also became bored and turned his face away, but the third person sitting at the table, who had been silent from the start, suddenly stood up. He was wearing a pure black cloak.

The balcony of Starfall Town was the most lively place in the daily routine, where many novice poets would choose to perform their talents and test their skills through the applause of the audience.

As the days went by, the businesses around the area began to thrive, and the open-air teahouse where the three of them sat down to chat was born. The three of them chose this spot because of the rumors circulating around this place.

"Don't be impulsive!" the barbarian, who was usually hot-headed, suddenly stopped his companions from taking action. "The opponent is Arthur's first player, you can't take action on your own!"

"Hmph, I'm not your subordinate, and besides, you, a newly promoted chef, have no idea what it means to be part of an organization."

With that, he turned around and disappeared into the crowd, his black cloak fluttering behind him.

"Slacking off? I thought he was a zombie," the barbarian muttered to himself.

"It's possible, but definitely not a zombie, you've seen a zombie with intelligence?"

The druid sitting across from him shook his head, "I just have a hunch that something is off."

"Oh, yeah. As a druid, I don't care if it's good or evil, but I hate unnatural things like monsters and undead creatures. Being in a team, it's better to have fewer problems. You're not a true druid."

"You know a lot, which is surprising for a half-orc barbarian player," the druid player spoke with a cold tone.

"This is obvious, my greatest skill is pretending to be stupid and then making people fall into the trap. Compared to the intellectual property of my half-orc species, it doesn't affect our true intelligence. Those players who clearly don't need intelligence, but still add 10 points to it, are just stupid, what's the point of having extra skill points?"

After joking around, the savage player fixed his gaze on the Druid player in front of him, "No way."

"We're a half-elf, a half-orc, two species that are naturally sworn enemies. Yet, we can sit here and talk because we're both human at the core. So, we don't care about this nonsense logic."

"But our professions are different. They're chosen based on our nature, especially for high-demand jobs like priests and druids."

"You Druids mostly don't believe in the gods, so you'd only join secret sects within your own organization. How can you be here? And how can you see undead creatures without attacking them?"

As the savage player spoke, he couldn't help but reach for the massive axe at his waist, as if he was about to swing it and flee at any moment.

"Hmph."

"It's because my sect and the organization's ideals align."

"We believe that short-term sacrifices are necessary for a longer-lasting peace."

"Battlefields are everywhere, and the scorched earth is fertile soil for the future growth of trees."

The Druid player said this, then gently pushed back his hood to reveal the mysterious tattoos on his face. The savage player was taken aback, his jaw almost dropping, "What the...? It's that crazy sect, and you're actually a member? How can you be absorbed into it?"

"Crazy, everything's gone crazy!"

The savage player shook his head, but his gaze couldn't help but wander to the distant area where the black-robed figure was preparing to build the tower for the future mages' association.

He couldn't help but speculate, wondering if the black-robed figure would really succeed.
Here is the translation of the text:

The night was dark and murky, and the house to be demolished couldn't be lived in, so most of the members of Zhao Xu's team arranged to stay at a nearby hotel. As for the players, most of them were underground, and they didn't need to worry about living arrangements. Zhao Xu was still standing in the courtyard, gazing up at the cool moonlight, thinking about the architectural plans in his mind, wondering which parts needed to be renovated. He kept pacing back and forth in the courtyard, even neglecting other matters, completely absorbed in his thoughts.

On the side, the so-called "left behind to protect him well" white dragon was already sitting at the corner of the wall, constantly snoring. After playing around all day, he secretly unleashed the "fear technique" to suppress the upper levels of the Starfall town, and the entire afternoon was filled with continuous visitors, most of whom were there for lessons or cooperation.

Suddenly, a faint, gentle sound caught Zhao Xu's attention, and he couldn't help but turn his head.

Only to see a man in black robes standing by the well, as if waiting for him.

"I've come to this place to bring you a message from our organization, inviting you to join our organization."
"So you don't know how to value yourself."
