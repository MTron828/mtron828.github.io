Chapter 411: Account Leak

As Zhao Xu walked across the stone bridge, he never thought that the first enemy he would encounter would be a demon.

Demon statues are artificial constructs created by sorcerers who have mastered corresponding magic, using a specific technique. They are essentially emotionless killing machines that cannot be enraged.

They will not think or execute complex battle strategies, only following the orders of their masters. The key ability of demon statues is their immunity to magic, allowing them to ignore any spells that require magical resistance.

Although Zhao Xu didn't understand, he wondered why the sorcerers who created these tools would create something that would ultimately harm themselves.

The demon statue, with its biological properties, also possessed a series of biological properties, such as immunity to psychological influence, instant death, sleep, and paralysis, similar to undead creatures. Additionally, they can adapt to various harsh environments, often being placed as guardians in tombs, making them a formidable enemy for adventurers.

The mud demon statue in front of them was a humanoid biological construct made from mud, standing taller than Zhao Xu by half a meter. Its broad chest was connected to robust arms through large joints. Suddenly, it swung its arm to strike Zhao Xu, accompanied by a howling gust of wind.

However, Veve had already rushed over. Compared to the slow-moving mud demon statue, her speed was significantly faster, and she had also raised her floating shield.
Here is the translation of the text:

As the sound of a clear and sharp impact, followed by a dull and muffled one, echoed through the air, the demon statue, unexpectedly, was deflected by Viola's shield. The shield itself was a magical item, extremely hard, and its surface was as smooth as a mirror, without cracking or shattering.

However, before Viola and Zhao Xusong could catch their breath and prepare to counterattack, the demon statue suddenly entered a state of extreme limit.

Its originally idle and relaxed arm suddenly swung from an unusual angle towards Viola, who was about to draw her sword to counterattack.

The fist was like a black tiger's paw, with a force like a broken bamboo, piercing through Viola's layers of defense and landing heavily on her stomach.

It was as if a heavy hammer had fallen to the ground.

Instantly, Viola spat out a mouthful of crimson blood and was knocked flying backward. Zhao Xusong, worried that she had been knocked into the molten lava below, quickly flew over to hug her and pulled them both back several steps.

Fortunately, the bridge was wide enough, otherwise they would have already lost their footing and died.

Zhao Xusong had just a moment to observe the demon statue's movement and was inspired to activate his built-in acceleration ability, resulting in a completely unexpected attack that shattered the defense of over 30 levels.

Instantly, the situation on the battlefield reversed, leaving Zhao Xusong facing the demon statue alone.

【Adventurer Zhongxia, you have successfully passed the "Knowledge (Mysterious)" skill check and analyzed the following information:】

The basic version of the mud demon has 90 HP (11D10+30).

The sixth-level spell "Earth Movement" can repel multiple meters and deal 3-36 points of damage.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

The six-ring spellcasting technique can cause a slow effect and deal 1-12 damage. The eight-ring spellcasting technique can immobilize the target and deal 5-50 damage. Zhao Xu saw these feedback and couldn't help but laugh. He thought that if he could cast these spells, he would have to use his knowledge and skills to find the weaknesses of a small demon.

However, when he recalled that he couldn't fly away from this place, he dared not to act rashly. Other spells would not have any effect on the demon unless they could bypass its resistance. The demon was called the "killer of wizards," but it was not that strong. Especially the mud demon in front of him was only level 10.

However, once it scaled up, it could unleash its powerful abilities, especially the low-level wizards who were quite formidable in terms of immune magic. The demon's natural armor was at least 20 levels, and it also had the ability to reduce damage by 10 points, which could only be broken by fine gold and blunt attacks.

Just as the mud demon unleashed its powerful strength and charged towards Zhao Xu again. Zhao Xu casually used the dimensional glove on his hand to retrieve the momentary staff.

In an instant, a black jade-like staff reappeared in front of him - the Power Symbol Staff.

The originally plain staff was surrounded by two streaks of light that had been released earlier. The High-Non-Ordinary Assault! Basic weapon damage increased from 3 to 20 points. Magic weapon enhancement! Added the "Fearless" affix.
Here is the translation of the text:

From the moment Zhao Xu mastered those close-range combat techniques, he would never tire of using them to specialize in wielding them for himself. Suddenly, Zhao Xu decided to engage in a fierce battle with the mud golem before him.

He directly wielded the wooden staff-shaped combat staff in his hand, charging towards the opponent.

Knowledge is true!

Divination check - Target: Mud Golem.

The instantaneous knowledge check result of 32 levels directly brought Zhao Xu a 4-level insight bonus to face the mud golem's attack, and an additional 4 points of insight damage.

The mud golem's originally hazy figure suddenly became clear in Zhao Xu's mind, and its weaknesses seemed to subtly reveal themselves.

Meanwhile, an instant spell slot in his mind instantly disappeared, and countless energies feedback to his own body.

The staff's ability, damage X2.

He smiled slightly at the corner of his mouth, because he was about to engage in a fierce battle with this mud golem.

Immediately, the contact.

The persistent spell "Rhino Charge" dealt 3 times the damage.

Cut in, burst.

The staff's passive ability "Fearless" dealt 4 times the damage.

If someone witnessed this scene, they would certainly shake their heads in disbelief, unable to understand the mysterious mage's actions.

The mage would stack the weapon's damage, and the piercing damage would be doubled and strengthened.

The only premise was - hit.

Miss, no matter how many billions of damage, it would be meaningless.

However, the Zhao Xu wielding the staff, which seemed to have an innate magical power, used his own wooden staff with confidence, as if he had been born with it.

And then, the originally unyielding mud golem suddenly burst into a crack at the point of impact, as if a spider's web had just been laid out.

This is a ghostly strike!
Here is the translation:

A continuous spell that lasts only one turn, with the enhancement of spell duration, Zhao Xu instantly eliminated his opponent's defense capabilities. The innate defense shield of the 14th level muddy golem in the muddy golem's natural defense armor directly returned to zero in Zhao Xu's mind.

Instantly, Zhao Xu, under the effect of his own "Speed Enhancement Spell", directly stored energy, just like the muddy golem, and struck again. The muddy golem was hit hard and fell apart, with the earth blocks scattering in all directions.

The whole process was so quick that even Selina, who had just sat up, had already finished. At this time, Zhao Xu walked slowly over and looked down at the internal core of the muddy golem, bending down to pick it up.

...At dawn, countless Arthur players, still half-asleep, opened the game forum, scanned the latest hot posts, and made sure to keep up with the trend.

But they soon saw a news report about a massive explosion that had just occurred outside the northern alliance town. Many players were busy refreshing the original post, waiting for the latest news from the front-line correspondents.

Some sensitive players instantly realized that the scale and power of this explosion were unprecedented in the history of their server. Even many northern alliance players at this moment were being called by various phone calls to rush to the explosion site for exploration.

As news of the discovery of extremely rare mineral crystals at the explosion site spread, the excitement reached a climax.

However, most non-northern alliance players could only watch others go on an adventure and leave their own comments. Zhang Qi was also just woken up by his mom to eat breakfast and could only sigh as he brushed his phone while rinsing his mouth.
Here is the translation of the text:

When he saw the massive explosion that occurred near the alliance, he felt itchy inside and couldn't wait to log in and organize his teammates for a battle. At the same time, the chat group of his class, Arthur, was also getting lively, with most of the discussions revolving around the live broadcast on the forum that morning.

Just as Zhang Qi was about to leave the table, he suddenly received a notification on his gaming forum app, telling him that the hottest topic of the day had just changed. Zhang Qi was taken aback, wondering why the second-hottest topic, also related to the massive explosion, had suddenly caught up.

As for the remaining topics, there was no need to mention them, as the first topic had already established a solid position, and other topics were being supplemented in real-time under that topic. Could there be new discoveries?

Zhang Qi immediately logged back in to the forum and his eyes fell on the hottest topic of the day:

"Shocking! The IP address range of East City Rui actually originates from a certain university!"
Zhang Qi's electric toothbrush, which he was holding in his hand, suddenly fell onto the sink without him even realizing it.

Even with a mouthful of toothpaste foam, he couldn't help but mutter to himself.

The legendary big shot East City Rui, it turns out, is a classmate of theirs?
