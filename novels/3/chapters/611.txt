Chapter 612: Deadly Lure, Venturing Alone
"Force Wall Technique!"
As Zhao Xu swung his magic wand, a powerful force field burst forth from the tip of the gemstone, instantaneously.

Zhao Xu, who had once used a summoning spell to conjure a "wall-like" barrier to block the explosion of the "Spellbreaker Technique", was now employing a different kind of "wall" - a force field technique from the Plasticity System.

The "Force Wall Technique" is a five-ring spell that can create an invisible force field.

What's more, this impenetrable wall will not take any damage and is unaffected by most spells. Even traditional three-ring "Dispel Magic" spells cannot take effect, nor can any spell or physical attack penetrate the wall. Only spells of level six or above, such as "Separation Technique", "Eradication Wand", and "Spellbreaker Technique", can affect it.

Zhao Xu can create a one-square-meter force field at each level, instantly sealing off the tunnel in front of him.

As Zhao Xu suddenly cast this spell, the players nearby were startled and gazed at the distant scene.

They saw that the mummies, which had been treated with preservative measures, were now lying on the wall, their consciousness restored. They were mumbling curses and rubbing against the force wall, yet unable to break through.

In an instant, a few players' willpower was broken by the mummies' "Despair" effect, which would render them paralyzed in fear if they gazed at the mummies and lacked the courage to resist.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

"At least 60-70 mummies," the 7th-level warrior who had overcome the negative effects said, "Even if we were to handle them all at once in the outside world, it would be very exhausting, not to mention the additional casualties caused by the decrease in numbers due to observation."

It was clear that Zhao Xu hadn't just dropped this "wall" to divide the battlefield. When they faced each other, they would have to take down a batch of them with the "despair" effect instead of just automatically recovering.

"You, Master of Magic, didn't use fireballs just now, but instead used this mysterious spell to seal it. Is there a reason?" the young Master of Magic approached humbly to ask for guidance.

At this moment, the force wall in front of them was deadlocked, with a giant mummy over three meters tall, having leveled up its profession, and its power was not small, but still unable to break through the barrier.

"I also need to observe a bit," Zhao Xu said.

This time, his essence was to see the reason behind the formation of the undead creatures in the bottomless pit, and as for being in the small team, he was also thinking about the huge team's attraction to the undead creatures.

However, the next moment, everyone's hearts were tense.

The number of mummies suddenly surged to hundreds, packed tightly on top of the force wall, and even some ghosts were seen floating in the air.

As the "force field" that could penetrate the "spirit realm" and the "main material realm", it could also block the phantasmal beings.

Therefore, Zhao Xu's "force field armor" was just as effective.

"This..."
Everyone looked at the undead creatures like ants, endless and continuous, making their hair stand on end, as if recalling the recent ghost wave, but now they had no support or assistance from the main base.

"This is another reason of mine."

Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu said with a wry smile, "In this mysterious underground cave, there are countless undead creatures that can't be killed, so there's no need to waste energy on killing them." Even if he had an endless array of magical spells, he had never thought of doing so.

If he had just used fireball magic, he would now be facing an endless horde of undead creatures, numbering in the tens of thousands.

"And besides," he reminded them, "these undead creatures may be blocked by a force field, but they can still penetrate through the invisible walls and surrounding rocks."

Zhao Xu summed it up, "So, let's hurry up and run. This is destined to be a journey of life and death."

In an instant, he gave the order, and everyone started running away as fast as they could.

However, in the process, they also crossed paths with another adventure team.

But to their surprise, the "Fearful Binding Spirit" that had been chasing them, along with the three bound spirits following behind, suddenly turned around and started chasing Zhao Xu and his team.

"I can't run anymore," the young wizards panted, one hand pressed against the wall, gasping for breath as they sucked in fresh air.

"You're a wizard, you're still so weak," the warrior said, approaching and trying to lift the wizard onto his shoulder.

"Ah, I see," Zhao Xu muttered to himself, having avoided combat throughout the entire process, and indeed, these undead creatures were truly impossible to kill.

However, the entire process took a turn that exceeded his expectations.

At this moment, they were standing at a fork in the road, with three paths emerging from which hordes of undead creatures were pouring in to encircle them.
Here is the translation of the text:

"I'm starting to suspect that we're carrying GPS on our bodies, attracting these undead creatures and allowing them to follow other teams and even attack us," said the priestess, Qing Lu, with a carefree expression, wearing heavy armor that limited her mobility. She was panting after running a short distance.

"Cast the law's chain, the extreme law's hammer!" she exclaimed.

"Force field!"

At this point, Zhao Xu also couldn't hold back and immediately sealed three doors. The "Fearful Binding Spirits" that could penetrate through the doors were one by one eliminated by the "Law's Hammer" that Zhao Xu wielded, dealing massive damage.

"What is this?"

"This is the Boundary King's Fist?"

"It's a completely unknown spell?"

"It's indeed a spell from the Yaxian clan, with no simple spells."

The more than 50 players following Zhao Xu were all stunned, unable to understand the devastating damage caused by the spell.

However, Zhao Xu didn't have much time to spare. He directly looked at everyone and said, "It's obvious that we have something on our bodies that's attracting these undead creatures, making them swarm over to us."

"If we continue like this, we'll all be annihilated," he said solemnly.

Except for me.

Zhao Xu muttered to himself, his voice barely audible.

"We didn't have any problems a few hours ago."

Naixia raised her head and thought for a moment, knowing that something was off but unable to pinpoint it.

"That's the difference," Zhao Xu said, shaking his head. "The solo mage, Qing Lu, has taken out the 'Olympus Crystal' and 'Magical Crystal', also known as the 'Dragon Crystal of Arthur'."

Suddenly, Qing Lu nodded her head, indicating that she understood.
Here is the translation:

"It's not my fault." Zhao Xu also sighed and said, "Maybe the cause of these undead creatures is related to the magic crystal in our hands."

"So, when I took out these two crystals, I attracted an endless stream of undead creatures. Just now, I tried to lead them away from the main group a few times, and I found that they all converged on my direction."

Hearing Zhao Xu's words, the people below grew pale-faced.

This means that the plan to dig for dragon crystals in this mysterious cave is impossible.

"So, I think I'll bid you all farewell first."

Zhao Xu silently walked to another branch without undead creatures.

"Is that so?"

At this moment, the female mage, Fei Su, also seemed about to cry and said, holding a "Olympic crystal" and a "magic crystal" in her hand, "I was just suspicious that it might be related to this, so I took them out to try as bait, but I didn't expectâ€”"

"No." Suddenly, Naliria's face was incredulous, "Fei Su, I don't want you to leave me."

"Stay calm!"

"If it's true, then we can't touch each other and should hurry to get away."

The warrior shouted loudly, "Remember, we're fighting for humanity, not considering personal gain or loss!"

At this moment, another cleric stood up and shouted, "We mustn't let our emotions get the better of us, or conflicts may arise."

The aftermath of this sudden shock and excitement may lead to emotional collapse or conflicts, so the experienced few quickly shouted to quiet everyone. Someone had already silently followed Zhao Xu, willing to die alongside him.
The translation is:

"No."

Zhao Xu directly used a "Portkey" to traverse a distance of over ten meters, but no one had time to react to whether he was using the Transfiguration spell or some other method.

"Explosive packages like this can be handled by one person," Zhao Xu said with a smile.
