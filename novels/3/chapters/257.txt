Chapter 258 Bottom Card
After Zhao Xu went offline, he did not immediately join the group.
Instead, he sat quietly on his bed for a while, re-experiencing his slightly different body.
The notice said the meeting would start in 10 minutes, but in reality, being able to gather more than 80% of the people within half an hour and start the meeting was already impressive.
The way to join the group is through the group number, and there are communication codes to avoid irrelevant people joining.
In fact, some players had already joined the "Mineral Association" and had been feeding information to the other side.
So by noon, some people had already realized the situation and sent out notifications for the meeting based on the participating personnel. This was also the reason why Cui Lu, as an important liaison person in the alliance, could obtain the communication code.
At this time, after getting off the bed, Zhao Xu silently ordered takeout and then opened the forum to watch.
Compared to before, Zhao Xu found that his memory had improved significantly.
Especially with a glance, all the posts on the forum appeared in his mind, giving him a familiar feeling.
Zhao Xu also began to experience the refreshing feeling of geniuses, not needing to think, just a glance and he could come to a conclusion, instead of constantly thinking and analyzing in his mind.
In the game, Zhao Xu's feelings were not very deep. At that time, his mind was more focused on deducing the entire battlefield situation, with more attention on the battlefield.
It wasn't until now, when he returned to the real world and saw the familiar forum, that he realized the difference before and after.
"Is this the way smart people think? It's really convenient," Zhao Xu couldn't help muttering to himself.
Thinking?
It turns out there's no need to think at all, everything is just a matter of intuition.
At this point, he also noticed the posts on the forum, which had begun live streaming the mysterious appearance of the temple in Falling Star Town, as well as the sudden change in weather to a winter climate.
"Who is in control of this strategic weapon? Did they just hand it over at Falling Star Lake?" one post immediately picked up on this key point.
"Just a reminder, it's still sunny where I am, but considering the sudden snowfall in Winter City, it's probably an effect spanning tens of kilometers."
"What? Is this the intervention of a godly power?"
"Indeed, according to our current spells that can only provide illumination and launch missiles, this is probably the legendary divine power, I wonder when it will be made available to us players."
Zhao Xu looked at all this and knew that many people found it hard to believe that the temple and the change in seasons were achieved through the "Nine-Ring Spell" he had cast.
In fact, most players still only saw Arthur's spells as "assistance in fighting monsters."
They couldn't understand that spells could also change the entire world's operation.
This was one of the reasons why Zhao Xu had directly cast this spell this time.
He wanted Earth players to have the opportunity to be the first to possess the qualifications of "mage" or "priest," or to attract some people with these qualifications to choose these two professions.
This way, after the crossover, Earth's strength would be even stronger.
After learning about the Seven Great Prophecies, Zhao Xu had silently regarded Earth's faith as a kind of foundation.
The main god does not need it, but the sub-god is very urgent.
Zhao Xu had been waiting for the "Resistance Alliance" meeting for over 20 minutes, and he directly opened the QQ group, entered the group number and verification information, and instantly passed the automatic verification to enter the group.
After scanning the group announcement that required changing the name to the affiliated organization and game ID, he scrolled back through the previous chat records.
At this time, at least hundreds of people had joined the group, and the information below was also very lively.
Zhao Xu quickly scrolled through most of the information, and even these messages seemed to form a completely consistent chat window, engraved in his mind.
"Which force do the newcomers belong to? Mark it, otherwise we need to avoid any spies and kick them out," the group discipline administrator directly mentioned Zhao Xu's alternate account.
"They're definitely spies, it's obvious that they're using alternate accounts."
Zhao Xu didn't say anything, but he actually felt that his hand speed had increased, and even the coordination of his hands perfectly adapted to his body.
But everything was not as much of an improvement as his brain, probably related to his intelligence in the game soaring to 22 points.
Zhao Xu saw that several people had mentioned him consecutively, so he directly changed his group nickname.
[User "997788" changed group nickname to "Star Reflection"]
As this notification popped up, the entire group suddenly erupted in a flurry of messages.
At this point, not only the high-level players in Winter City, but also the entire Northern Alliance and some powerful player forces, were paying attention to and intervening in this first major battle among players.
Many organizations and forces had sent personnel to attend.
Arthur is not a game that can be advanced with just resources, so it has suppressed the development of major player guilds. However, the players' own power in the game is still evolving, slowly adapting to Arthur's own mode.
"Is it a scam?"
"Is it really that level 4 pro?"
"Can I add you as a friend? Pro? @StarryReflection."
"@StarryReflection, same here, willing to pay big for mage leveling secrets."
At that moment, players from outside the Winter City were even more excitedly paying attention to Zhao Xu, as his chat box kept popping up with private messages.
Generally speaking, when players can come together and fight for a common goal, this kind of shared empathy is easily contagious to other passersby.
This is also the reason why the so-called "hardcore" game "Arthur" suddenly welcomed a wave of new players in the past few days, and many players are even seeking ways to change their IP location so they can be born in "Winter City."
This surge in traffic also means that Arthur is becoming easier to monetize, causing a lot of studios and guilds that rushed into Arthur but never got the upper hand to become anxious.
The resources they have piled up with manpower cannot compare to the materials owned by players who have won the favor of a few NPCs.
Zhao Xu, seeing this scene, did not think much and began typing a long paragraph on the keyboard.
"Here is the information I have gathered."
"The 'Mining Alliance' has a means of spreading a plague, and the source of infection is the bodies on the battlefield that have not been properly disposed of. Once a player fails a constitution check, they will lose 1-6 points of constitution, and then suffer another 1-6 attribute loss after 1 day."
"And this plague can be transmitted from person to person, without the third ring 'remove disease' there is no good way to handle it." Zhao Xu explained.
After seeing his words, the high-level players in the group, who were in charge of organizing the team, all reacted immediately.

It's not difficult to kill a player.
What's difficult is killing five players in a row while facing players who are increasingly experienced after death.
However, once a player is infected, he will turn into a wounded player and withdraw from the battle. Without the removal of the curse, he will only be able to recover for a long time.

Not everyone can directly commit suicide to eliminate the disease.
So, once the plague breaks out, it means that the five resurrection stones of the infected players are directly disabled, and even the possibility of re-registering an account is eliminated.

Actually, Zhao Xu had originally thought about how to use the "miracle technique" to directly eliminate the "epidemic" of all players in the scene, but when he heard "Lakshmi" remind him to be careful, he immediately reacted and decided to eliminate the source of the problem.

This is also the reason why he came to the group to remind everyone, even with the obstruction of ice and snow, they must be extremely cautious.

Many players in the group, including Zhang Qi, had been infected with the disease, but due to the intense battle, they were forced to directly commit suicide to be resurrected in full state.

This is also the reason why the memory of the group has a deep and somber color.

"Ah, you're saying it makes sense. But we need to confirm your identity first."
"No, if you're indeed the 4th-level player, then we can transfer command authority to you." At this time, a 2nd-level warrior who led the meeting showed his respect to Zhao Xu.

Zhao Xu then simply typed, "I'll appear again in the afternoon, and my cloak will have a large '5' on it."
Here is the translation of the text:

As for the rest, whether you believe it or not, I only fulfill my duties for the sake of justice within my heart.

Just as he finished speaking, a flood of messages from people kissing up to him appeared, with many asking to add him as a friend and offering to pay for it. However, Zhao Xu was still typing away on his keyboard.

"By the way, here are the data on the Star Lake Mining Association. Please read it first and then decide on the next battle schedule."

Zhao Xu uploaded the edited group file directly.

"What?"

"How do we win?"

For a moment, countless high-level players who opened the file exclaimed in unison.

However, many outsiders were more concerned about the "temple" and "weather issues" that appeared on the battlefield today. They quickly @'d "Starlight Reflection" and asked Zhao Xu questions.

Zhao Xu responded directly:

"The temple is brought about by the 'Miracle' spell of the Nine Rings."

"Winter is also brought about by the 'Fenbul Winter' spell of the Nine Rings."

His two concise replies were like a bomb dropped into the lake, instantly overturning all the water.

Even the strongest spells in any online game couldn't compare to the impact of changing the weather and summoning a temple.

Finally, someone asked the key question: "Is the priest really the strongest profession in this game?"

Zhao Xu responded: "And there are still priests waiting."

As for the phrase "two words", he ultimately omitted it.
What someone else can't get, there's no need to flaunt it and provoke envy.
