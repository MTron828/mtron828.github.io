Chapter 19: Battle Strength

"Are you continuing to read 'The Path of Arcane' today, teacher?" Zhao Xu asked, flipping through the book. He had already understood it by the second day, and it was indeed a special book with manipulated magic.

After closing the book, the contents inside would automatically change every time he opened it. To retrieve previously read content, he would just need to mentally recall related memories, and the book would automatically display the previous content.

This book with self-contained artificial intelligence search technology was something Zhao Xu had never seen before.

In his previous life, he had heard of equipment that could communicate with their owners and exchange dialogues.

For the past few days, Zhao Xu had been spending most of his time reading that book and attending lectures.

"Not necessary," Anniya said.

Even after spending a few days together, Zhao Xu had not been able to uncover her face hidden beneath her cloak.

"This organization has had some disagreements over your future path," Anniya said.

Zhao Xu immediately perked up, feeling no burden of being a pawn.

What he sought was to live a good life.

"The main reason is that someone has proposed a new perspective," Anniya said. "And as a dual role of a genius, you have a different perspective."

"Actually, Arthur also has the approach of not advancing, choosing a pure mage or pure priest profession. They are one of the few who can exist without advancing," Zhao Xu said.

Anniya nodded, "Yes, even without advancing, they will not weaken significantly."

"After the legend, pure mages will have even more abundant benefits. Andâ€”"

Anniya paused here, "Pure mages can also purely interact with magic, which is beneficial for magic research."
Here is the translation:

"Some people in the organization suggested that you should become a pure mage and not pursue short-term combat power enhancement."

Zhaoxu finally understood and thought that he could also cultivate himself through observation over the past few days. He didn't take the external route, but rather chose the research route.

But Zhaoxu thought carefully and realized that everything Anzhiya said was actually what happened after he entered the floating city. Therefore, the opinions of more people in the organization had also formed over the past two days.

Compared to three days ago, no one knew his existence.

"Before, we said we would decide on your career path to prevent you from wasting your advantages and leveling up some unnecessary levels. We can abolish your profession with absorption magic. In fact, our organization is still very free. So, I came here to ask for your opinion."

"Do you want to pursue the combat power route or directly become a pure mage and stay in the floating city to do research?"

As Zhaoxu listened to Anzhiya's explanation, his hair stood on end when he heard the name "absorption magic". Arthas had many negative states, such as attribute damage, attribute absorption, energy absorption, dizziness, blindness, deafness, trembling, fear, confusion, disorientation, fatigue, exhaustion, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, fainting, paralysis, and petrification.

However, among them, the most frightening to players was undoubtedly this energy absorption.

Absorption magic is a 9th-level spell that can directly eliminate an opponent's level 2D4 (2-8 levels) character.

2D4 refers to the sum of two four-sided dice, with a value between 2 and 8.
Here is the translation of the text:

As soon as you master this technique, it will be a piercing pain to the heart. If your character level is not high enough to absorb the level, you will directly die.

If you exceed the level, this technique will maintain for 24 hours, and then it will exempt each absorbed level. If the exemption is successful, the negative level will disappear, but if it fails, the negative level will disappear, and your character will permanently decrease by one level.

Permanently decreasing by one level is the true punishment.

In the past, a powerful friend of Zhao Xu's, who was absorbed by a warlock's ability, failed to exempt and directly fell into the mortal world, losing his influence.

Therefore, Zhao Xu and people who live by levels are all terrified of these exemptions.

Zhao Xu thought about the possibility of a philosophical dispute and hesitated before asking, "Teacher, can I ask, is it the organization that proposes this?"

"Strictly speaking, our ultimate goal is only a major force within the Arthurian Mage Association's headquarters, and the goddess has prestige, but it's not entirely decisive. This proposal is based on the views of some researchers who have been stuck on the topic of magical barriers, and they hope to have someone like you who is naturally gifted in both divine and arcane magic join them."

Zhao Xu suddenly felt a sense of relief and declined the offer, thinking it unlikely to be remembered.

"I heard that Arthur can also master both divine and arcane magic through the advancement of a secret technique?" Zhao Xu suddenly remembered a past event and asked.

Anastasia's expression suddenly changed, and Zhao Xu, hidden from the shadows of his cloak, felt her piercing gaze.

"This advancement is always very secretive, and players will learn about it later. But I didn't expect you to be able to access it in just three days."
Here is the translation:

Zhao Xu was taken aback, he never thought he would accidentally kick a stone. In reality, people like An Ti Nuo Ya, who are high-level individuals, know that Zhao Xu has access to the internet on Earth, which is something that has been publicly announced by the gods. Therefore, when Zhao Xu suddenly asked about some strange content related to King Arthur, An Ti Nuo Ya would always provide explanations without questioning him.

"Why are you questioning me?" Zhao Xu hastily nodded his head.

"The secret sorcerer, an advanced profession, has no professional skills except that each level of its practitioners can simultaneously stack with the levels of both arcane and divine spellcasters."

Zhao Xu suddenly realized that the secret sorcerer that others had blown up in his ears was actually hanging here.

A 1st-level mage/1st-level priest/10th-level secret sorcerer is equivalent to an 11th-level mage and an 11th-level priest in terms of spellcasting. What does this mean for his two elite teammates?

However, An Ti Nuo Ya quickly shattered his illusions.

"The premise of advancing to a secret sorcerer is that one must be able to cast both 2nd-level arcane and 2nd-level divine spells. Meanwhile, you two elite players cannot advance to this profession."

Zhao Xu suddenly understood that he had been trapped. Players can only touch advanced professions at level 7, so it's no wonder he suspected something.

The 2nd-level arcane and 2nd-level divine spells indicate that the player is already a 3rd-level mage/3rd-level priest, a 6th-level character. Even if they can take on a 10th-level advanced profession, they can only cast 6th-level spells until they reach level 16, at which point they can cast 7th-level spells.
Here is the translation:

At this time, Pure Mage has already mastered level 8 magic, and even the next level, level 9 magic, is within reach. However, if he directly generates a 20-level character, it would be fine for Secretist to advance, but starting from level 1, this profession with no special abilities will definitely make Zhao Xu play in a painful and unbearable way.

This is also his biggest advantage as a double elite, watching the pot and eating from the bowl. "Teacher, I'm choosing to go to the strength path," Zhao Xu said, having no more worries here, as he has a double elite, and wants to make the most of this advantage, not advancing to the strength path, which would be a waste of his entire testing number.
