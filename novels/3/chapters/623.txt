Chapter 624: Alone and Strongest Charge

After hearing this sudden shout, everyone's eyes widened in shock and joy, unable to accept this news.

As players' levels gradually increased, aside from magic weapons and armor flooding into players' hands, some powerful items began to manifest their unique abilities.

Among them, the "Ain Stone" with its flashy effects was well-known to players.

However, the "value" of the Ain Stone was completely disproportionate to its "price".

It was like spending a lot of money for a small gain, with more face gained than actual benefits.

The true significance of the Ain Stone was that it did not occupy a slot in the equipment and would not cause conflicts with magic, making it a valuable asset.

For example, Zhao Xu wore the "Time Return Amulet" on his neck, which allowed him to consume 4-level divine magic. The "Arson Cross" pendant, which could only be worn during daily morning preparations for magic, was stored in his backpack.

Zhao Xu knew that the Ain Stone was expensive, but he still chose to buy it.

However, most players had empty equipment slots and didn't need to spend a lot of money to buy the Ain Stone.

Over time, the Ain Stone became a status symbol for wealthy players.

When people saw an adventurer wearing the Ain Stone, it was like seeing someone driving a luxury car, with a hint of suspicion about whether they had rented the car or not, but the possibility of being wealthy was still high.

In other words, Zhao Xu's strength increased significantly in the eyes of others the moment they saw the Ain Stone.

The next moment, the exclamation "Zhōng Xià" turned everyone's perspective upside down. This was no longer a master, but a savior. As for Zhao Xu, he didn't expect someone to recognize him, and it was only when he walked in that he realized it was the female mage Qīng Lí who had been separated from him earlier. "What about your sister?" Zhao Xu couldn't help but ask.

Qīng Lí's expression turned bitter, "Zhōng Xià, after you took away the lifeless creatures on the day of the crystal, we ran into a 'Warlock' in the middle of our journey. The whole team was terrified and scattered. I was separated from them." 

Zhao Xu also shook his head in dismay.

They had encountered the Warlock, which was the highest-level undead creature. This was indeed bad luck.

The Warlock was essentially an 11-level mage or above. Even if Zhao Xu encountered one, the outcome would be uncertain.

"Aren't you the leader of the Yà Nán?" A mage player suddenly asked in surprise, "But why didn't my detection magic reveal any magical aura when I cast it on you?"

As the players looked at him through angry eyes, the mage player finally slapped his forehead, "Oh well, sorry Zhōng Xià. I must have misunderstood. Your Aën stone didn't detect any aura, I guess."

The mage player had never encountered such a situation before. He had always been able to sense the emotions of his friends and enemies without any obstacles. However, for the first time, he failed to detect the aura of a mage on the opposite side due to the mage's abilities.

Zhao Xu shrugged his shoulders.

At the moment the mage player walked in, he had secretly cast his detection magic on Zhao Xu. However, Zhao Xu's three-ring spell "Insight War" directly revealed this point. He could even counter this spell with a spell of his own as a countermeasure. However, it wasn't necessary.

His "hidden eye" immune to all detection and divination spells, and if they could see through it, that would be strange.

"Would you mind if I took a seat?" he joked, and he also wanted to know about these players' knowledge.

Everything that happened in the cave over the past two days.

Of course, the invitation was warmly expressed, and even the most restrained person would become enthusiastic at this moment.

Just as he sat down, Zhao Xu noticed that everyone was staring at him with shining eyes, filled with wonder and admiration.

"I was just an ordinary person before I crossed over," Zhao Xu said with a smile. "You don't need to look at me like that."

"Not at all, Mr. Zhong Xia," the boy said excitedly, "my sister was inspired by your previous post to persist in playing the game, otherwise she would have given up long ago."

"So after that, I posted a thread saying that everyone can cross over, and my parents and I went to register an account. We were even scolded by the game masters. But after crossing over, they were dumbfounded and regretted their decision, abandoning their superhuman bodies."

When the boy said this, his sister's face turned bright red, and she hastily grabbed the boy's waist to stop him from speaking in front of everyone.

At that moment, everyone in the cave burst out laughing.

Zhao Xu also smiled wryly.

He never expected to see the fruits of his labor from his previous post, which he had locked on the East City account, slowly revealing its power.

There were already two wizards and an additional mage in the room, which was a luxurious configuration.

As the crowd laughed, a few people's expressions turned bitter, and they began to recall their former comrades who had abandoned the game. Those players had only stopped playing because they had run out of five revival stones and had chosen to delete their accounts. In that case, they would be no different from other non-players who had traveled to Earth, with no material gains, only experience. "Thanks for your trust back then," Zhao Xu said.

After Zhao Xu's words, the scene fell silent, with an awkward silence. The players all wanted to ask him questions, but they were hesitant to do so due to the vast difference in their identities. Even though they had become "noble" players, they still felt pressure when facing Zhao Xu, the first person. Zhao Xu had never liked revealing his identity or explaining too much about his experiences. Especially when it came to his connections with high-level authorities, he had never spoken about them.

As a result, Zhao Xu had never revealed his identity in the cave. However, at this moment, he did not expect that the ten people in front of him were all curious, yet hesitant to ask him questions. It was not that they lacked social skills, as Zhao Xu noticed that there was a poet in the group. The problem was that the gap between him and these players was too great, and language could not bridge it. Especially in a society like Arthur's, which was not a democratic society where everything was decided through collective consultation and leadership. It was possible that Zhao Xu's words had determined the direction of the entire Arthur's journey.
Here is the translation of the text:

Currently, the entire world of Ayan is developing rapidly, especially with the recent success in blocking the tide of undead spirits by oneself. Other civilians may be unaware of the situation, but players are a group with resources to exchange, and they are extremely well-informed. They immediately understand that if Summer's intervention had not occurred, the civilians in the wasteland might have suffered a 50% casualty rate. It's even possible that humanity on Earth would have become extinct.

As for their lives and the fate of their loved ones, it's extremely likely that Summer would have had a say in it all.

The environment has become such that everyone is watching Summer's every move, and speaking in accordance with his intentions.

Each person is afraid of disturbing Summer, lest they offend him.

Suddenly, the "Paradise of Humanity" in Summer's hand let out a soft hum.

Alone and helpless, there was no one else but Summer.

Summer could only shake his head and take the initiative to start a conversation.

"It's fate to meet, and I'm also planning to tidy up in this cave. If you have any questions about the profession of Arthur, you can ask me."

"I also have some experience in upgrading from back in the day, haha."

Summer had just obtained the Nine Swords Inheritance and was feeling good about it. He had no hesitation in sharing the most critical "route information".

At that moment, the people sitting opposite Summer all looked at each other, especially the two female wizards, the older sister and younger sister, both of whom were wizards.

They and Summer shared the same profession and were the most likely to benefit.

"Mr. Summer, are there any upgrade routes for the warrior profession?" asked the female wizard, but it was actually her younger brother who asked, and her face was flushed with courage.

Mentioning warriors, Zhao Xu still has some experience, especially since he had vowed to take revenge in his previous life and was greatly admired by several powerful warriors, who taught him many battle strategies.

However, in this moment, the personification of the heavenly paradise in his hand once again triggered a feedback to Zhao Xu.

["Adventurer Xun, you have received feedback. Master the skill 'Leadership Charge' (White Crow, first layer)."]
"Charge!" Zhao Xu said.

Instantly, numerous "specialties" and "abilities" related to "charge" flooded Zhao Xu's mind.
