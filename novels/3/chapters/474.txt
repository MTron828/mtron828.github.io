Chapter 475: The First Official Pastor

In the Saint Heart Cathedral, Mr. Strala, a revered pastor, stood before a group of novice pastors. "Well, after this period of training, even if your progress has been slow, you have basically completed all the pastor training courses."

In a room filled with statues of goddesses, dozens of novice pastors sat silently, listening to the graduation speech. Today's graduation ceremony was held at night due to the special circumstances of the players. The elderly pastor, although only a 3rd-level, had been teaching new pastor lectures for over a decade and had even trained many bishops.

The elderly pastor looked at the players below him, feeling a mix of relief and satisfaction that they had not caused any trouble during their training, except for the initial demon invasion incident. He took a deep breath, feeling a sense of accomplishment.

The players, due to their faith in the Earth's deity, had a relatively low level of devotion to the goddess. Many players felt that it was not necessary to worship specific deities and instead chose to believe in the "camp faith" of the pastor. Most of the novice pastors present were of this opinion.

However, the lack of the goddess's "blessing" meant that these novice pastors would find it much more difficult to become "authorized pastors" and acquire "divine powers". While they were in the "goddess's divine sequence", there was still hope for them to get in line and take their chance.
Here is the translation of the text:

But these camp pastors rely heavily on their own strength to feel the "divine gift", to feel the truth of the camp. One night's enlightenment, how easy is it?

Generally speaking, based on his many years of experience, even if these players have special "divine blessings" in front of them, the road ahead will still be very difficult.

Otherwise, after a few months, the number of player camp pastors will not be limited to just a few.

"Allowing, listen to my old man's words, and from now on, we'll just raise them," said the girl pastor, Sina, who was sitting next to Zheng Xin'an, looking no older than 15.

"Other goddess pastors can rely on reading the holy scripture of the goddess of magic and through rigorous self-cultivation, gain the divine gift. But how about us, the faith pastors?"

"Besides, there's no doctrine to guide us," said the girl pastor. "I see that most successful cases are those who firmly believe in something and become camp pastors. Most of them have experienced major setbacks and transformations. But I, a spoiled and pampered little girl, where do I get that kind of feeling?"

At this point, the black-haired girl pastor sitting next to her whispered weakly, "Actually, I think the doctrine of the goddess is pretty good."

"Oh, so you're going to betray our camp and join the side of the goddess's faith?" Sina's voice rose in indignation.

The other players who were sitting quietly around them couldn't help but glance over, even coughing softly a few times.

Although the goddess is willing to accept and guide them, Sina's statement was a bit too arrogant, even causing the old pastor on the stage to glance at them with disdain.
Here is the translation of the text:

Ling Zhu Xue, who is 158 cm tall with a slender figure, may have a slightly weak personality, but she is still very resolute. "Nana, we three will start here and I swear not to betray anyone, even if I can never become a priest," she said.

Then, the girl player, Nana, turned around and asked Zheng Xin Yu, who was standing beside her, "What about you, Xin Yu? Don't you want to join the magic goddess?"

Zheng Xin Yu shook her head slightly. "I won't."

"By tomorrow, I estimate I'll leave the church and join my high school friend Qi Qi's guild," Zheng Xin Yu said. "She said I can be a priest-in-training and follow her around. But I think after school starts, I won't have as much time to play games as I do now."

After saying this, Zheng Xin Yu couldn't help but sigh.

Although she had no experience with brain-computer games before, she completed the entire priest training program at a slow pace, which was not outstanding.

However, no matter how many times the courses were repeated, or how complex the theological texts were, she persisted.

"Hehe, Xin Yu, as a refined lady from a rich family, you shouldn't be playing games at all," Nana teased, although she was the youngest of the three but also the most shameless when it came to driving.

She and Zheng Xin Yu, as well as Ling Zhu Xue, had met each other in this game and gradually became familiar with each other.

Without this kind of mutual support, it would have been easy to persuade girls who weren't really enthusiastic about playing games to give up.

At this moment, Ling Zhu Xue also nodded slightly, but her gaze drifted towards the statue of the goddess on the wall, as if she had seen the faint glow above it.

Although the church didn't force these priest-in-training to convert to the goddess, it had laid a solid foundation in various aspects.

At the same time, Zheng Xin Yu's expression turned nostalgic.
Here is the translation of the text:

Qi Qi was also very surprised that I would play this game, as she had recommended it to me many times before, but I had always refused. As a result, I'm now playing more frequently than her.

"Hehe, is your boyfriend playing this game?" Nana teased.

Zheng Xin An shook her head, "No."

"However, before I entered the game, I met a very mysterious person, and it was because of him that I chose to enter this game."

Their low-toned discussion also caught the attention of the people sitting in the back, and a male pastor couldn't help but ask, "Say, Xin An, didn't you and the 'Zhong Xia' pastor, who led our lectures, go on a mission together?"

"Is the opponent the same person as the first player, Zhong Xia?" he asked.

"I'm not sure," Xin An replied, for many curious people had been asking her about this since the "Sacred Breath" message appeared on the forum.

Or, they all sense that the Zhong Xia pastor had a bias towards Xin An, but initially thought he was an NPC.

"Now, it's a player, and the issue is no longer trivial."

"Hmph, I think it's him, and I was a big fan of his before," Nana said with a scowl, "It's also because of emotions and a sense of closeness."

"Xin An definitely won't let him take it away from her, she's the brightest flag for our 'Array Pastor'."

Nana hummed.

Just as she finished speaking, Zheng Xin An suddenly glowed with a strange white light, illuminating everything.

The originally peaceful prayer room was suddenly filled with a profound and ethereal chanting, with a hint of emptiness.
Here is the translation of the text:

"The Heavenly Language is a prayer, related to divine blessings. Xiao Tianxue, the most excellent student in the primary school, reacted quickly.

Just then, the elderly priest responsible for hosting the graduation ceremony suddenly changed color, and his face, which was already deeply lined with wrinkles, almost collapsed. His knees gave way, and he knelt down on the ground, saying, "Is it a blessing from the goddess?"

The other novice priests couldn't help but look at Zheng Xin'er. Without learning the structure of magic, novice priests who only mastered the basic incantations and postures could complete their training at a higher rate than magicians. However, the number of priests was not significantly higher.

The reason was that "receiving divine blessings and bestowing divine magic" was a major obstacle for most priests.

"How long has it been since we crossed the threshold?" someone asked.

"I heard that priests are now the highest-paid profession, and many studios are training, but they can't get the divine magic."

"You think even the strongest adventurer team and sponsor are in dire need of priests. A team of adventurers can't waste a priest, who can fight and heal. What else is there to say?"

"That's why this female priest is leaving," someone said.

"Don't people in real life just rely on their family's wealth to experience life? You think you're as poor as you are, but you're actually earning a living. You know that faith doesn't matter, so you come to our camp to have some fun."

But Zheng Xin'er had already ignored the surrounding conversations and saw a holy light slowly merging into her body."
Here is the translation of the text:

As for the elderly pastor who had fallen to the ground, he looked up at the sky with a bewildered expression, his mouth murmuring to himself: "Something's off, it's the aura of the goddess's domain, just the fluctuation of divine power is off."

"It's not the goddess?" he muttered.

"But it's not the goddess's power, why would the goddess allow it to descend upon the Sacred Heart Cathedral? Clearly, the demon invasion just occurred not long ago, and they've already set up a sufficient divine barrier around here."

"Who is it from God?" he wondered.

At that moment, the elderly pastor suddenly realized that the prayer room was suddenly opened by a "light gate" condensed from the holy light in the air.

"The Gate of the Otherworld!" someone exclaimed.

"Is it the Heavenly Servant of the Blaze?" another asked.

The other players, all priests, were staring at the scene in a daze. Although they had trained for this segment of time, they were all familiar with these terms.

However, it was because they understood that it was terrifying.

Zheng Xin Yu, on the other hand, slightly lifted her head and looked at the Heavenly Servant of the Blaze who had emerged from the sky, her mouth slightly ajar. "Who are you?" she asked.

"I am Artesia, sent to take a look," replied Artesia, with golden hair and a tuft of sticking out from her head. Her words sent a wave of peace to everyone's souls, and they all held their breaths, waiting for her next words.

As Artesia lightly extended her index finger, pointing it at Zheng Xin Yu's forehead.

"Congratulations, you are now a formal priest."
