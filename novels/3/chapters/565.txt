Chapter 566: Levels of the Training Ground, Hellish Scene

If an ordinary person were to say this, everyone would definitely sneer at them on the spot. However, Zhao Xu's voice at this moment carries a certain kind of thick and powerful energy, emitting an unusual charm that directly penetrates deep into people's hearts.

Not to mention the legendary reputation and power of the "wizard" himself, which has left a profound impression on players for over half a year.

Although the wizardry of a player and the native wizardry of Arthur are two different concepts, with the appearance of the player's tri-ring magic, this "large-scale destructive magic" and "mid-air three-dimensional striking technique" still establishes the reputation of tri-ring magic.

No matter how Zhao Xu showcases his own strength, it's still rare to see. Only when the tri-ring wizardry reaches a new level can it truly make the wizard profession no longer be stigmatized.

Warrior Zhang Yao Yu couldn't help but wobble his head to clear his mind, realizing that it's not the power of magic, but he somehow feels a sense of affection for this mysterious wizard.

Perhaps this is the magic of language, which can easily make people believe in the other person.

"You're also a player, are you familiar with them?" Zhang Yao Yu, the player-warrior, smiled brightly at Zhao Xu, his heart in good spirits.

"Sent by someone," Zhao Xu said half-true, half-false.

At this moment, Zhang Yao Yu's girlfriend couldn't help but tug on her boyfriend's sleeve, "What player do you think is in such a cold state, and at a time when everyone is busy looking for their loved ones, who has the time to waste it?"

She felt uncomfortable asking her boyfriend about the other person.
Here is the translation of the text:

The warrior player's eyes flashed with surprise, and he let out a bitter smile, saying, "Well, I hope you mages can save Stone him, we all started by optimizing our strength at the beginning, without thinking too much."

"Who would have thought that the initial game attributes would become a real physical attribute and bring such severe consequences?"

As the warrior, Zhang Yao Yu, couldn't help but feel grateful that he didn't take it to the extreme, and instead chose a moderate approach, allocating two points of intelligence to wisdom, and maintaining an average IQ.

Meanwhile, Zhao Xu noticed that the warrior's girlfriend was paying attention to his expression several times, as if trying to read between the lines.

However, Zhao Xu, who was responsible for recruiting mages, had done his homework thoroughly, making sure to avoid any unnecessary trouble that might lead to a passive-aggressive reaction.

To prepare for this critical task, Zhao Xu had re-read and memorized various time-limited control spells, and even selected some high-level control spells from the "Tome of All Spells" to ensure a successful outcome.

In addition to the effectiveness of these spells, there was also the art of diplomacy, which was the key to success in historical times, relying on one's eloquence and bearing.

In Arthur's case, these skills included "reading people," "deception," "negotiation," "intimidation," and "performance" (XX), which were all linked to "charm adjustment value."

As players truly crossed over, the skills they had invested in originally suddenly became "real and genuine" skills.

Even someone who was not very articulate could become a skilled orator with the help of high skills and charisma.
Here is the translation:

So, a large number of players have experienced a transformation on a par with a "face-lift" in the game.

This is also the reason why players can smoothly join the upper echelons of society.

Because their attributes, after 28 days of leveling up, or even 32 days of leveling up, have already reached the level of "heroic start", choosing one out of a thousand.

For example, Zhao Xu, after casting a continuous "Tianji" spell for a short time, obtained the innate abilities of the Lilliputians, instantly gaining 10-level insight in skills such as deception, negotiation, intimidation, and psychological analysis.

10 levels are already a significant difference between ordinary people and experts.

At the same time, Zhao Xu also has the four-ring occult "Longyan Art" on him, which makes his voice deep and powerful, leaving listeners feeling awe-inspiring, powerful, and profound.

If quantified, this means Zhao Xu will gain a +10 enhancement bonus in deception, negotiation, and intimidation.

When combined with his 4th-level charm, even if Zhao Xu has not invested any points in external skills, these skills have easily reached 24 levels.

It's not an exaggeration to call him a social master.

As they slowly chatted and deepened their understanding of the camp, many ordinary travelers began to look over at them. However, most of them only glanced and then turned back to their own business.

Some held makeshift tools made from dry branches they found, while others listened intently to the guidance of players who had taken the lead.

"It's going quickly, and we've even started teaching general language," Zhao Xu exclaimed.
Here is the translation of the text:

"It's true," the warrior player chuckled, "I learned English from a young age, but who would have thought that I would graduate and then encounter a time-traveling incident, and I still had to learn the common language of King Arthur. Luckily, the system started sending me the common language. If it were a barbarian, they would be in a sorry state, since they are born with no knowledge of writing and would have to relearn it."

"'Common language' is simple in grammar and vocabulary, and it can communicate with King Arthur's majority of races without wasting time."

Zhao Xu tried to comfort the warrior girl, who looked embarrassed, as this was also a problem she was facing.

Now, everyone is learning languages, and it's no longer just a matter of glancing at grammar and vocabulary and waiting for the skill points to convert.

Moreover, the system will automatically translate, and it won't affect anything.

Only a few veteran players who have mastered this language can achieve this.

"However, it's still more convenient for mages," the warrior, Zhang Yaoyu, said with a shake of his head. "When we entered the game initially, we could choose how many languages to master based on our intelligence. Naturally, the mages with the highest intelligence have an advantage."

Since Zhang Yaoyu, with an intelligence of 10, can only master one common language.

"One Ring of Arcane Understanding, Three Rings of Arcane Eloquence can all overcome language barriers," Zhao Xu explained. "This is where mages really have an advantage. However, there are also magic items that can help with language barriers. If you really need it, you can choose to purchase one."

"I can't afford magic equipment," Zhang Yaoyu said with a sigh, "and I didn't have any gold at the time, and now it's even more impossible."

"It's not certain," Zhao Xu said.

He thought to himself that those remaining wealth left in other forces may not be recoverable.
Here is the translation of the text:

As the lord of the territory who also serves as the chairman of the local association, his existence would be erased for a month due to the rampant corruption in the small town, and he wouldn't believe that there's no devil behind it.

Zhou Xuan is still unable to free up his hands to deal with the backstage hands for now.

Meanwhile, other forces' players, who have fixed assets, must have suffered even more severe losses. It's impossible to predict whether they will be ordered to hand over their assets according to the law.

Zhou Xuan then carefully observed this camp, and discovered that someone had already organized a group of children, receiving education from the original Earth and learning Arthur's language, and preparing for the worst.

"Here we are," said the warrior, Zhang Yao Yu, leading Zhou Xuan to a desolate area in the camp.

Many weak patients and elderly lonely people lay on the ground, crying and moaning, as if they were about to die.

Some middle-aged men with unkempt hair and dirty faces stared blankly into the distance, muttering to themselves and repeating phrases.

On Earth, abandoned wives and orphans, as well as drunkards and gamblers, are no different.

Compared to the state of the camp-crossers Zhou Xuan had seen initially, after some time had passed, the scarcity of food and the erosion of energy began to take effect, gradually accumulating and causing problems.

The camp-crossers were like debtors who couldn't pay off their debts, struggling to make ends meet each month, and falling into a vicious cycle.

Zhou Xuan, despite his mental preparation, still felt a pang in his heart as he looked at these people, because he couldn't see the slightest glimmer of hope on their faces.
Here is the translation of the text:

"If it's a player, even if they had a serious illness before, they could almost fully recover by the time they arrived in Arthur. Next door, there was a barbarian who had lost both legs in an accident, but after crossing over, he became a game character and was able to walk quickly and run in the morning.

However, those who were already ill on Earth and crossed over relied on divine power to reshape their bodies, and their original illnesses were significantly alleviated. But under the influence of this cursed land, their already weakened physical condition made them unable to withstand the challenges, and their illnesses suddenly relapsed.

What they thought was a recovery turned out to be an illusion, and many people who had been struggling with illness were devastated. Not to mention that there was no medical care available on Earth.

"No, we don't deserve to enjoy this," said the warrior, pointing to the direction of another camp.

It was said that it was not easy to start a fire and cook food just a day after crossing over, and it was a luxury that only the wealthy could afford in this desolate land.

As for the priest, although he had only a two-ring certificate, he had a three-ring "Removal of Disease" scroll on his body, which had attracted countless people who had begged at his doorstep, crying and pleading for the scroll.

However, it was not easy to obtain this scroll. The wealth of Earth was of little use here, and each person had only the clothes on their back. They could hardly even wash their clothes.

In a short while, except for players who had their own equipment and additional clothing, most Earth-crossers would have to wear tattered clothes."

"'Ah, I've heard from my sources that the troops led by Captain Zhang Yao Yu are planning to set up camp near Yalan. They're keeping a low profile, hiding behind the trees, and no one dares to mess with them. You said it's not too much, even the capital's household registration is taken into account when crossing borders.'

"'The second-tier forces are those that have received support from the Temple's clergy and the Saint Warrior's Guild. These holy men and women don't care about anything, as long as they can help the civilians and spread the faith. They have a big heart and are very noble.'

"'The third-tier forces are those that have received support from other forces. Although it's not obvious, they all have a purpose and plan. On Earth, we're like Chinese chives, we can be cut and eaten, but we also know how to cultivate ourselves.'

"'The fourth-tier forces are those that have no support. However, since there are many young people, we can still maintain a certain level of strength. We've already spread the knowledge of Arthur, and we have enough manpower to arrange for players to go hunting and gather resources. We can even sustain ourselves for a few days, waiting for help to arrive.'

"'The fifth-tier forces are those that have very few players. They're not sure if they can even self-defend, but they're still very happy. They say that even the emperor's treatment is not enough for them. As long as they find a few loyal people who won't betray them, their understanding of Arthur is their greatest wealth. Since our camp has many players, I just went to retrieve my weapon, but the Baotong family is so powerful on Earth that it's like they can see through the palm of their hand. They're already making it clear that players are highly valued in everyone's hearts. The players in the fifth-tier forces will only become more exaggerated.'"
Here is the translation of the text:

"The lowest-level ones are the countries that have never been opened or have only a few players. These places have an average player strength of only two or three, and most players can only survive by relying on their luck because the entire Arthurian world is against them."

Warrior Zhang Yaoyu quickly divided the current region into levels, although not as detailed as Zhao Xu and Wang Qingwei's discussion. However, it still made sense.

Limited communication channels meant that this could be achieved in just one day, indicating that the opponent's fourth-level region was already aware of this and had participated in decision-making.

Or, the intelligent players in the game had already occupied key positions, so their opinions could spread instantly.

"'Ah, the half-orc warrior you're looking for is over there,' Zhang Yaoyu said, pointing to a thick winter oak tree.

A half-orc warrior was chained to the tree trunk with iron chains, his face twisted in a ferocious expression, constantly looking around as if he wanted to pounce on his prey like a beast.

The patients around him, who were similarly afflicted with a deadly disease, dared not approach, not even from a distance, as if they were afraid of being contaminated by the evil spirits. They kept their distance, not even daring to touch the ground near the tree.

In the distance from the half-orc warrior, a seven- or eight-year-old human girl was crying uncontrollably, her face filled with sorrow as she gazed at the opponent."
