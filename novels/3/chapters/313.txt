Chapter 314: Secret Archives

As the sun shone brightly on the second day, Zhao Xu had already appeared in the hall of records in the floating city, carefully flipping through the nearly century-old records of renowned wizards.

Most players rarely visit this archive, preferring to linger in the library of knowledge to upgrade their skills and knowledge.

However, only wizards born in Mistral have access to the library's resources.

Without special training, wizards from other cities cannot find sufficient books to upgrade their knowledge and skills.

Therefore, players mainly rely on the knowledge and career skills of troubadours to gather information.

Zhao Xu had spread out a book in front of him, with a portrait of Elrold, a nine-ring wizard who reached the pinnacle of power a hundred years ago.

On the side, there were stacks of records of wizards who were contemporaries of Elrold, including his mentor in Mistral, such as Glacial Sword.

No one, including the master of the wizard's tower, was aware of Elrold's nine-ring level, mistakenly believing him to be a six- or seven-ring wizard.

This difference in value led to the wizard's tower itself being of vastly different value.

Zhao Xu relied on his own knowledge and career skills to retrieve some information and remained here, naturally, to "thoroughly understand" the premise.

The five-ring "Portation Spell" itself was extremely demanding, requiring the caster to have a clear understanding of the destination's location and terrain.

The more vivid the image of the destination in Zhao Xu's mind, the higher the success rate of the Portation Spell.

Apart from that, some energy wave transmission regions with extremely large targets will also fail to transmit due to unknown reasons.

Zhao Xu arrived at the archives, aiming to find clues by reading the biography of the opposite party and analyzing the history of the wizard tower. He wanted to understand the structure of the tower's floors and layout.

Unfortunately, the latter part was encrypted, making it useless.

Zhao Xu also obtained a new "Summer Magic Note" as instructed by An Tiya, and returned to Mistral to settle down and prepare to advance.

However, Zhao Xu did not rush to upgrade. On one hand, his high knowledge level had decreased after rapidly increasing his character level. On the other hand, he needed to accumulate more knowledge.

In particular, since starting the undead raid, he had almost no time to study the "Legendary Library".

According to his past memories, it would take about half a month for players to reach level 4. By then, he could upgrade to level 6 without hesitation.

Zhao Xu even wanted to try his luck, wondering if he could level up by accumulating.

As instructed by An Tiya yesterday, each of the seven notebooks could be fused to bring about leveling effects, a total of six levels. From level 15 to legendary level 21, it's six levels. From level 1 to 7, it's also six levels.

However, the timing of reaching level 6 depends on Zhao Xu's own choice, whether to do it now or in the future.

Unfortunately, the urgency of the matter is pressing, and Zhao Xu hopes to advance as quickly as possible.

Naturally, he will use all the upgradeable notebooks before crossing over.
Here is the translation of the text:

Ansenionya came to visit yesterday evening, and he only briefly glanced at these notebooks, which turned out to have sufficient energy and could simulate the attributes of a divine artifact, allowing people to upgrade. However, Ansenionya didn't provide any specific information about what these notebooks are.

As Zhao Xu thought about it, he began to ponder the biography of this Erool Linton, a mage. Erool's life experience was relatively straightforward and steady, with a gradual accumulation of knowledge, unlike some sudden breakthroughs. Compared to the other two families that obtained notebooks, the Erool family has consistently maintained the tradition of mages.

It's possible that Erool's family knows some secrets about the notebooks. Erool even suspected that the notebook was intentionally left alone, with some hidden tricks. Otherwise, a single map pointing to the Moon Lake at the bottom would be sufficient, and another transitional stone room would be unnecessary.

As Zhao Xu looked at the biography, he continued to memorize the clues he would need to pay attention to later, and his mind wandered to the information he needed to retrieve.

Although his head began to ache from memorizing too much, Zhao Xu did not give up and continued to research.

He knew that this period would be very busy. In the Arthurian world, according to the schedule arranged by Ansenionya, he should be leading new players who have just entered the game.

On the other hand, he also had to attend a concert tomorrow night and needed to log off early.

It's also been two months since he last went out to entertain himself after joining the game. The last time he went out, he discovered some special abilities and ran to the school hospital.
Here is the translation:

"Hey, little brother, you really have a connection with me." Suddenly, someone patted Zhao Xu on the back and sat down across from him.

Zhao Xu looked up and realized it was Lin Qi, a fat monk he had met at a shape-shifting lecture. Lin Qi had also pointed out some dark knowledge to Zhao Xu when he was studying the "Awakening Canon" during his research.

Zhao Xu suddenly felt a sense of disorientation.

In his impression, Lin Qi was just a 5-level mage, and even in the pre-civilization era, he was only around 5 levels. However, when Zhao Xu met Lin Qi again two months later, he had already caught up with him.

"Little brother, I don't know how your 'knowledge dedication' ability has progressed since last time," Lin Qi said with a smile, revealing his white teeth.

Before Zhao Xu could respond, Lin Qi glanced at Zhao Xu's book and exclaimed in surprise: "I didn't expect you to be searching for the lost Cloud Tower from a hundred years ago!"

"Cloud Tower?" Zhao Xu was taken aback by Lin Qi's words, which suddenly caught his attention.

"Cloud Tower belongs to the protagonist 'Eroil Linton', a 9-ring mage, in the biography you're reading. Legend has it that the mage tower was once located in the cloudy mountains, and its reputation was great."

"Ah, the mage tower, you know? In reality, many mage guilds in town are built using the structure of the mage tower. However, most of them are low-rise buildings. The Cloud Tower, as its name suggests, is a flying tower that can soar through the air and reside in the sky."

Note: The story appears to be set in a fantasy world with magical elements. The characters and events are fictional.
Here is the translation:

Lin Qi's eyes grew more excited as he spoke, as if he had stumbled upon a rare and precious find. "And the nine-ring mage, Linton, died unexpectedly in the chaos of a century ago. At the time, his tower was said to have fallen in the vicinity of Mistral, but the location of the crash site was sealed by the association and remained unknown to this day."

Although he was drawing his conclusion based on the biography in his hand, Zhao Xu still looked puzzled. "No, it's not that. But how did you know about the Cloud Tower?"

Arthur's legendary mages were not a hundred people, but dozens at the very least. Including the nine-ring mages, the number would be even greater, especially after they acquired the ability of eternal life. Therefore, it was reasonable to say that a mage tower should not be well-known to even a 5th-level mage.

Just then, Lin Qi lifted his head, his cheek trembling. "Oh, you're asking how I know, right? Well, I have to introduce you to another aspect of my identity - the Vice Chairman of the Mistral Lost Treasure Association."

Zhao Xu immediately understood that the "Lost Treasure Association" was actually the same as the "Protector" guild formed by the Frost Sword, a group of wild card organizations.

These were not like the "Final Scroll" officially registered under the Mage Association, but rather just a group of people who had gotten together, hung up a sign, and called it a day.

Lin Qi thought Zhao Xu was interested in their organization and quickly introduced himself. "And we have over 50 members in our organization, mainly focusing on tracking and archiving historical treasures that have gone missing. We even send people to excavate lost sites."

"And the 'Cloud Tower' is rare and unusual, having fallen in the vicinity of Mistral, and with the nine-ring mage having possessed it. Given the time gap of less than a century, it is currently one of our top three priorities in the association." Lin Qi exclaimed, growing more excited as he spoke.
Here is the translation of the text:

"In reality, from fifty years ago, legendary mage Morning Star accidentally let slip that the wizard's tower fell near Mistral, and you're holding this ancient tome that people borrow every year. However, most of the time, it's the five-ring wizards who want to borrow it to try their luck at sending it. But it's rare to see a low-level wizard like you."

As Lin Qi thought back to the experience of the mage in front of him using the "Shining Silver" emblem to blind him, he immediately said, "On the road of wizardry, one must strive to be the best. Little brother, you're still struggling in the one to two-ring area. If you have any difficulties, you can ask me for guidance. As for the 'Cloud Tower', you're not ready to rush into it yet."

Zhao Xu didn't expect this Lin Qi mage to be not only fat but also having exceptional lung capacity.

As he had already reached level 5, he didn't care about the other's mention of "hurry up". Moreover, he knew the specific location.

Only after hearing the other's mention of the "Cloud Tower" did Zhao Xu become curious and ask, "Can I take a look at the relevant documents?"

At this point, Lin Qi revealed a sly smile, made a rubbing motion with his thumb and index finger, and flattered, "This one needs some... smoothing out."
