Chapter 333: Sensing the Target

The subsequent search process was futile, even for the team led by Eliott, who had been following closely behind. Eventually, after reporting to the church, they quickly received permission from the church.

With a minister from the Judgment Council as their leader, Rayan and another high-ranking minister disguised themselves as followers, while Zhao Xu served as the secretary. The group of four, using a list provided by the church hierarchy, met with the ministers recorded on the list in sequence.

In essence, this "regular meeting" would be held periodically every year. The high-ranking clergy from each church would gather at the Sacred Heart Cathedral at a fixed time in a specific month to report their duties.

As for the gods, only the ministers of Mistral could rely on the transmission portals scattered throughout the world, managed by the Mage Association, to return to the Sacred Heart Cathedral regularly every year to report their duties.

The church would also concentrate on holding concentrated meetings with high-ranking clergy from distant churches during this limited period.

The clergy who had returned from distant stations were also the first to be suspected and were prioritized as targets. However, due to the leader's and Zhao Xu's low rank, Rayan's team was only assigned to investigate lower-priority individuals.

After a roundabout journey, the team arrived at a quiet room according to the schedule notes on the list.

On the stage was a three-ring female minister with a pure appearance, sitting cross-legged on the front table, muttering incantations and guiding the group.
Here is the translation of the text:

Below are the novice pastors, learning the teachings of the pastor, mimicking their movements, and breathing in sync with them.

Zhao Xiu suddenly felt a bit embarrassed.

The female pastor in charge of the lesson was teaching the most basic "prayer" methods. These actions are strictly regulated within the church's "morning prayer" and "evening prayer" rituals.

Pastors usually pray for divine power at these two fixed stages.

Zhao Xiu had not used his divine powers recently, so he still retained them naturally, and therefore did not continue the prayer ritual to obtain divine powers.

Unlike other devout pastors, the main purpose of the prayer ritual is to praise God and confess one's sins, and obtaining divine powers is just an additional bonus.

So Zhao Xiu did not need divine powers, and naturally, he abandoned the ritual.

The prayer ritual originally allowed individuals to pray freely, even directly kneeling down and shouting the name of God loudly.

However, after the church formed an organization, various prayer rituals became more standardized.

Even in the church, specific locations were designated for prayer, accompanied by incense and heavenly music.

Zhao Xiu, initially without this education, closed his eyes and began to silently recite prayers to the goddess.

Meanwhile, the leader of the group, Pastor Matthew, looked solemn, with a stern expression, as if he were a statue of ice.

In reality, Pastor Matthew, with his four rings, is the mainstream of the church's judicial institution, the "Court of Judgment".
Here is the translation of the text:

Matthew, who was also hastily summoned back by the church from the outside, participated in this action, and the four-person team, including him, were the only ones who truly knew what they were doing. Moreover, only Matthew, a pastor who was completely outside of Mistralla, could eliminate suspicion.

The four of them had established a common spiritual connection. Matthew, following Rein's instructions, waited until the female pastor had let the novice pastor practice, and then he beckoned the other side to come out.

When the female pastor with a pure appearance saw the other pastors wearing black robes, she immediately understood what was going on. Even though she knew her moral character was impeccable, she couldn't help but have a slight tremble in her heart, and then she and the novice pastor slowly walked out.

The five of them directly went to an empty quiet room in the corridor and sat down to discuss.

"Jerusalem, 5th-level pastor?" Matthew, as the leader, asked the other side questions throughout, with Rein guiding him through spiritual connection at critical moments.

Jerusalem took a deep breath and nodded slowly, then answered each question according to Matthew's questions.

Zhao Xu was recording the conversation between the two parties, and this transcript would be signed by both parties afterwards.

Throughout the process, although everyone was thinking about where the demonic pastor was, they still followed the normal procedure, only having a brief discussion with low-risk personnel.

It wasn't until they had spent more than 10 minutes together that Rein finally asked in his mind, "Zhongxia, how do you say it?"

Zhao Xu silently replied, "No abnormalities."

According to the church and association high-levels' inference, if Zhao Xu, who had not reacted after more than 10 minutes of interaction with the deep abyssal power, could eliminate the possibility of 9 out of 10.

"I have no problems," Matthew replied in his mind simultaneously.
As a pastor with over ten years of experience, Matthew himself had honed his skills in reading people's minds and observing facial expressions. He was judging from the perspective of the interviewee.

"Okay, no problem," said the pastor who was sitting in the corner, just like Anne, another female pastor who was acting as a follower. Her hair had turned white and her face was pale, but her complexion still showed hints of its former refinement.

"That eliminates the suspect, let's move on to the next one," said Rayan.

Generally speaking, failure is the norm in such investigations, and the list of suspects in Rayan's hand had already reached over 50 people.

It was unlikely that they would catch the culprit immediately.

After Matthew and the other party exchanged pleasantries and thanked each other for the interview, Rayan's team went straight to find the next target.

In the next process, Rayan's team followed the principle of proximity and first screened the trainee pastors who worked in the same building.

This was because the training of trainee pastors was mostly concentrated in the same building, and they generally avoided wasting time by running back and forth.

However, most trainee pastors who could take on a teaching job had undergone strict screening, and it was unrealistic to assume that they had not been exposed to any fake news for years.

As for those who suddenly took on the job today, they had not had any contact and it was difficult to judge their credibility.

Therefore, most of the time, they had to rely on Zhao Xu's "Deep Sea Power" intuition.

The answers were all rejected.

Until they reached a classroom, where an old pastor was sitting at the front, his old body still very energetic. He was reading from the scriptures, elaborating on the greatness of the goddess, and the ten or so earth players in the audience were on the verge of falling asleep.

"Ah, do you understand?"
Here is the translation of the text into English:

The Lightning Squad is currently waiting at the entrance for the other party to finish explaining. However, Zhao Xu noticed that someone's gaze was lingering on a student below the classroom, which piqued his curiosity. "Oh, an old acquaintance," Zhao Xu replied simply.

The temple itself was filled with the will of the goddess, and Zhao Xu lost track of the other party as soon as Zheng Xin entered the temple.

When he got closer to a certain distance, he was able to re-capture the other party's location. He was like a wireless radio, once the direction was aligned, the signal from the other party would re-emerge.

At this time, Zheng Xin was sitting downstairs, but unlike other students who were dozing off, he was tilting his head to the side, deep in thought, pondering the old priest's explanation on the stage.

"You're quite the character, huh?" Lightning An joked.

Zhao Xu didn't respond.

That's indeed the case in the Arthurian world. Most priests choose to believe in deities.

The number of camp priests is extremely small because it's much harder to obtain a response from the camp than from the deity.

As for the training of camp priests, it's usually handled by nearby camp organizations, and after completing the basic 1-level training, they will seek out the camp organization or fend for themselves.

Many players who can't determine their faith at the beginning will choose to become camp priests and receive training accordingly.

Most priests will eventually convert to worshiping the deity during this training process. The old priest on the stage is playing the role of a guide.

The batch of students in front of Zhao Xu consists entirely of these novice camp priests, which is also the reason for Lightning An's joke.
Here is the translation of the text:

"What's the background of those people outside?" A gamer who was sitting below couldn't help but mutter to himself.

As a priest player who was still in the initial training period, he was half a "newbie" like Zheng Xin-yu, who had just entered the game, and half an "old hand" who had deleted and re-rolled.

Especially in the current player group, the priest profession itself could bring extremely high returns.

Even the strongest 3rd-grade team wouldn't hesitate to team up with a 1st or 2nd-grade priest.

Some wealthy players even directly paid for priests to use healing skills in the game.

This also led to most game studios investing heavily in the priest profession, but only a few succeeded, and some players even quit the studio after becoming priests.

Facing the rising tide of priests and mages, their related gossip became a daily topic on the forum.

Therefore, when encountering some situations in the church, many people would enthusiastically discuss them.

"I'm definitely a group of high-level priests. Haven't you seen that old priest who preached the goddess's doctrine, and his tone became so confident and powerful?" someone said.

"Ah, that's just a bunch of yuanming people walking around," one studio player looked at the four people at the door with envy, "I wish I could level up to their level, it would be so cool."

"Don't be foolish, you won't even qualify to stand at the door after two years. Those people in black robes are from the Judgment Department, probably here for the annual meeting. Priests who can join that department are all above 7th level and can cast four-ring divine magic," another priest who had used up five revival stones said, basically considering today's encounters to be child's play.
Here is the translation:

"Hey, don't say that, I think this account can be passed down to my grandkids to play with."

Just then, the short priest who had just been mocked also looked dejected, and it was basically a consensus among players that it was difficult to upgrade their skills.

In reality, a game where you can't necessarily level up is, in itself, a very mysterious thing.

Finally, the old priest finished speaking and only then took a sip of water before walking out to accept an appointment with Zhao Xu and others.

"You three go meet with him," Zhao Xu said. "I'll stand here and wait."

At this moment, he was planning to sense the relationship between the distance and spiritual energy fluctuations between him and Zheng Xin Yu.

However, Lei An thought Zhao Xu had discovered something new, and his spirits were immediately lifted, and he quickly communicated with himself: "Waiting for good news."

"This... "
