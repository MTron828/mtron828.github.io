Chapter 320: The Mysterious Secret of the High-Ranking Mages

The ultimate truth of the divine nature remains beyond the understanding of the high-ranking mages who are present, and it is impossible to comprehend its secrets without experiencing it.

After Zhao Xu stayed for about half an hour, he looked at the research below and found that there was no progress. He then went back to the Observatory with Anita Noja.

After the winter arrived, the wind blowing over the island began to carry a hint of cold, but it was not yet biting. When Zhao Xu rubbed his face, it was a slight reminder of the change in seasons.

Throughout the process, Anita Noja remained silent, and Zhao Xu followed her closely behind.

After they returned to the Observatory, they did not immediately go to the office but instead found a rest area with a scenic view to sit down.

Zhao Xu lay down on the comfortable sofa, stretching his lazy arms and shoulders.

Anita Noja sat quietly in front of Zhao Xu, pouring a cup of hot red tea from the golden tea kettle.

The two of them sat in front of a small table, with the outside glass floor letting in natural light.

Gazing out the window, the entire city of the floating islands was illuminated at night, and it was even possible to see the distant green sky.

The observation deck was a place set up by Anita Noja on the 7th floor to relax and enjoy the night view.

Zhao Xu rarely stayed up late at night, and this was the first time he had accompanied Anita Noja to sit high up and watch the night sky, where they could still hear the distant howling of the cold wind blocked by the glass.

Anita Noja took a sip of the red tea and looked at Zhao Xu quietly.

"Teacher?" Zhao Xu couldn't help but ask.
Here is the translation of the text:

Annie didn't say much, but instead took out a stack of files from her dimensional bag and handed them to Zhao Xu. "I've arranged for you to take three positions. You'll be conducting research on magic and completing these three tasks in the near future."

Three positions? Zhao Xu was taken aback, but he still took the materials from Annie.

These positions weren't as simple as buying vegetables at a market. Zhao Xu looked puzzled as he flipped through the materials.

The materials were divided into three parts, corresponding to the positions at "Floating City", "Goddess Church", and "School of Letters". The positions were for "Apprentice Mage", "Apprentice Pastor", and "Scholar Noble Official".

"Theory says that the best fit for me would be to take up the position of Apprentice Mage in Floating City," Zhao Xu thought to himself.

He knew that his professional background and connections were well-suited for the position.

But Annie shook her head. "It's not just one of them," she said.

Zhao Xu was more confused than ever.

"I don't have to worry about it," Annie said. "These positions aren't full-time. They're arranged to have different schedules, so you can attend classes according to the schedule."

Zhao Xu understood what she meant. He could even imagine himself teaching Apprentice Pastors.

"But, Teacher, doesn't 'School of Letters' not quite match me?" Zhao Xu asked.

He had encountered students from School of Letters before. Annie and his friends, Andy and his companions, were all students at School of Letters.
Here is the translation:

The academy can be said to be a decent place for those who cannot become mages or priests, even if they are the children of the nobility or officials. The academy itself is aimed at cultivating talents for the nobility and officials, as well as technical officials. No matter how you look at it, it has no connection with Zhao Xu's situation.

"This is mainly to get you familiar with the middle-class society of Mistral," said Anzioya.

Zhao Xu listened silently.

The upper echelons of Mistral are the ones he is currently interacting with. The common people, adventurers who often venture out on missions, are constantly interacting with the world. However, it's the middle class, comprising ordinary nobles, a vast bureaucracy, and various wealthy merchants, that forms a closed circuit, subtly excluding him.

As he takes on the role of a teacher in this circle, he will naturally interact with them. However, this seems to have little to do with becoming a high-level mage.

As the liaison between the Association and the Goddess Church, Leen is definitely going to maintain close ties with this middle-class circle. However, whether Zhao Xu chooses the battle path or the research path, these people are not the ones he needs to interact with.

Therefore, Zhao Xu cannot help but carefully consider Anzioya's intentions.

Outside the observatory, the clouds on the horizon moved with the sky, blocking the moon's rays and dimming the earth's brightness. Zhao Xu's face also turned pale, which was already subtly suspected but not confirmed.

"Yes? Do you understand my intentions?" Anzioya suddenly laughed lightly.

"I guess there are two possibilities, but I'm not sure which one," said Zhao Xu, playing his cards.
Here is the translation of the text:

"All right," Anzhen said straightforwardly, standing up and revealing her tall figure. "So you, it's a long and arduous journey ahead."

Zhao Xu then lightly poured himself a cup of red tea, although he didn't feel anything since he was distracted by the projection. Only the city manager of Mistral, the master of this city, needed to deeply understand the middle-level officials who supported the entire system.

This meant that he would have to participate in this aspect of the job in the future. Because the players didn't have the slightest sense of belonging, they were more like outsiders.

This was his first guess.

The second reason came from a sentence he once read in a book in the legendary library: "Human nature is the first step towards divine nature." To become a god, he needed to interact with various believers and experience different human natures.

However, regardless of which guess was correct, it was a significant and far-reaching matter, so Zhao Xu dared not make any judgments.

Suddenly, Zhao Xu gazed at the three-quarter moon that had cleared the fog, looking at its shape, which was completely different from the Earth's. He couldn't help but ask, "Teacher, if the channel is not temporarily connected tonight, or even tomorrow, will we be unable to restart it?"

Zhao Xu's implication was clear: would they, the players, be unable to log in to the game again due to this influence?

Zhao Xu had just obtained some secret information about the energy material channel.

Therefore, he needed to judge the attitude of Mistral's high-level officials and even the gods towards this matter from Anzhen's attitude.

Anzhen indeed raised an eyebrow slightly, "So we're forever separated from the heavens?"

Zhao Xu was about to correct the other person's mistake, but before he could, he was interrupted by the words, which made him wonder how they could be forever separated from the heavens.
Here is the translation of the text:

Just as Animia suddenly turned around and faced Zhao Xu, she said in a detached tone, "Zhongxia, if that's the case, I'll go find you." "According to our lineage's rules, no one can be considered a true warrior before the legendary era," she said, her voice dripping with arrogance. "So, I haven't fulfilled my responsibility to you."

As she finished speaking, she let out a nasal tone, clearly satisfied with her answer.

Zhao Xu felt a sense of unease as he listened to Animia's words, as if a raven was flying over his head.

"Teacher, only legendary ones can be considered true warriors?" Zhao Xu asked.

"Well, it's not that strict," Animia said with a smile. "Or, you can help me when I occupy a layer of the deep abyss. That would also count as fulfilling your responsibility."

"I'll just become a legendary mage then," Zhao Xu said.

As Zhao Xu and Animia had a close exchange late at night...

Meanwhile, the online community was in an uproar, with many players being woken up by their companions to participate in the discussion. On the forum, numerous players were sharing their guesses, with many going crazy @ing the most perceptive Dong Cheng Ying, waiting for a response.

However, Zhao Xu was already in the game, so he couldn't respond.

As a result, many people started doubting whether Dong Cheng Ying was indeed the "1" online.

However, considering it was already late at night, it was possible that the other party was asleep, so this speculation was eventually dropped.

But slowly, as many high-level players appeared and shared their opinions, the forum voices began to converge towards a single direction...

Perhaps this disconnection was not caused by a server upgrade or network failure.

It was likely that a certain player had triggered a legendary-level storyline task in the game, leading to a version update.
According to Arthur's nature, there is a possibility that someone exists, guiding the entire world's change, which is indeed the case. This also explains why the opponent can log in to the game ahead of time. Because this is the person's pre-task.
