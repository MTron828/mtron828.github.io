Chapter 537: The Promise Revisited, A Choice of Fate

Upon hearing the description from the other party, Zhao Xu had already recalled the scene of the Star Lake Battle, where he had received injuries.

Arthur's magic, especially his damage-dealing spells, typically have a range of around 6 meters, with an exaggerated estimate of several dozen meters. Spells like "The Winter of Finbarr" that are on a kilometer-level scale are rare, and even more so without any damage elements.

On the battlefield, when facing high-intensity magical bombardment, any commander with an IQ online knows to spread out the troops to a certain depth. This is a basic operation, like distributing eggs to avoid being crushed all at once. Just as the world entered the era of iron flows after the earth's surface hardened, cavalry charges became the last hymn.

Confronting bombardments similar to magical artillery, soldiers also scatter, dig trenches, and take cover to avoid being hit. Even spells like fireball, which are "long-range" spells, have a casting distance of 120 meters, with an additional 40 meters per level. Most magic users, including mages and wizards, cannot stack up to 20 levels to achieve a depth of over 1,000 meters.

Therefore, in the fantasy world of Arthur, except for magic output units like mages and wizards who can form a reliable output force, most military magic users can only reach a range of several hundred meters at most.

As a result, in large-scale battles, unless magic output units like mages and wizards can form a stable output force, they are usually used as special forces.

Tactics like beheading, intelligence warfare, and pinpoint bombing are all targeted at the enemy's last weak points.

So, when old man Matthew mentioned this, Arthur had a spell that could cause massive damage on a large scale.

How could Zhao Xu not be shocked?
Here is the translation of the text:

At the time of the Star Lake Battle, he also relied on his "Nine Rings' Divine Technique" to obtain the blessing of the goddess Sisylvina, lavishly casting group spells. The power contained within this technique is far beyond the level of ordinary Nine Rings' magic, similar to the scale of directly removing the plague from an entire town.

Now, with such an enticing opportunity within reach, is it not a waste for someone like Zhao Xu, who already possesses so many snowball-like techniques? However, Zhao Xu's mind remained clear-headed and calm, slowly regaining his composure under the temptation.

As the saying goes, "You can't get something for nothing." The free lunch is the most expensive.

"What do you want from me?" Zhao Xu asked.

Although the old man, Ma Xun, looked at Ana with great concern, even going so far as to become the owner of that fake library, he was undoubtedly a core member of the Ernest team from back in the day. However, when it comes to family, he's just a father and mother.

There is no such thing as a free lunch among strangers.

"Take it easy," Ma Xun said with a smile, his wrinkles still piled up, but his inner joy was hard to conceal.

Not being taken seriously is the biggest protective barrier.

As soon as he opened his mouth, Zhao Xu had already entered the arena.

"I only need your promise," Ma Xun said.

As soon as the words left his mouth, he couldn't help but cough, as if he had said something wrong and received a retaliatory blow.

Again?

At this moment, Zhao Xu's whole body felt numb, and even his mind began to think of a thought.

Is it not possible that one day he can master the "Interdimensional Transmission" and reach the outer layer, and then use the "Ink City" controlled by the "Painful Lady" to lavishly sell his promise?
Here is the translation of the text:

A promise, how much is it worth?

If Mathew is the first to come to him to ask for this "promise", he won't know whether he has already given it out. By the way, from the past to the present, he is still a bit sensitive about "promises" like this.

Especially after Arthur discovered the "true name" and "oath" powers.

He can bring himself an "advantage" that cannot be ignored by making a promise like "I will not betray my magic to death". This is already a "power" that breaks the rules. If he goes deeper, he won't dare to think about it.

However, the weight of "warfare magic" makes it difficult for Zhao Xu to refuse directly.

From ancient times, it's not just about being rich to found an empire. There are a few lucky ones who have successfully obtained a treasure trove in history.

However, among these people, the old man Mathew has successfully established a powerful empire that spans the continent.

The Eastern Empire, which is still influential today, is not even close to this scale.

According to the old man Mathew, "warfare magic" has made great progress in the process of establishing the empire. "Don't rush." The old man Mathew noticed Zhao Xu's actions and entanglements.

He seemed to transform into a sharp-tongued persuader, saying, "The premise of 'warfare magic' is to be an expert in 'researching warfare magic'. Initially, the owner noticed that I had a desire to expand and conquer, so he passed on this expertise to me."
Zhao Xu couldn't help but raise an eyebrow. This is almost saying that Ernest knew his "ambition". And yet, he still didn't take precautions, and the Great Emperor is also a big-hearted person.
Here is the translation of the text:

"So, this is a specialty that even Miss Li doesn't know about, because she can rely on legendary magic to achieve the power of most war magic, and even surpass it. After listening, Zhao Xu also nodded.

Indeed, just the "Dragon Tribe's Attack" incantation he is holding in his hand right now, and he can release it at any time. With this, he can summon over ten giant dragons to descend upon Starfall Town, and even defeat a legion with the might of the dragons. However, a legendary mage is difficult to establish a country.

Even that legendary mage they encountered in the snowy wilderness, who established the Eastern Empire with the Nine Swords system, is not an exception.

Zhao Xu's perspective has now gone beyond his own growth. His focus is on how to make the entire force strong.

With the premise of specializing in warfare magic, it means that this is a skill that can be spread, so he can rely on the effects of warfare magic to offset the shortage of mages.

"The premise for learning 'Refining Warfare Magic' is a strong will and a 3rd-level spellcaster level, and after deeply understanding the truth of warfare magic, you can grasp the learning of these warfare magic."

Older brother Matthias said with a tempting tone.

It's clear that he is also aware that Zhao Xu will soon face a situation where the entire human population will be crossing over.

Behind Zhao Xu are "Arthur players" who occupy an extremely small proportion compared to the 6-7 billion population.

He and Matthias faced the same difficulties, with too few talents to maintain the stability of the entire territory, which is to say that the military is weak.

"Warfare magic, as long as you obtain the specialty I just mentioned, you will be able to experience all the remaining warfare magic when you enter the 'Final Scroll'."
Here is the translation of the text:

"They are both forms of magic, such as the 'Pastoral Magic' skill, which can create 100 units of food and water per level. Just one sentence and Matthew plunged into Zhao's heart.

The food problem is not just a joke, and it's not just a matter of 'purchasing' or 'magic' that can be solved. Looking at the global food market, you can see the turbulent and unpredictable nature of the market. If you buy too much, prices will rise.

Therefore, the magic users, like Arthur, who are experts in plant magic, start from the cultivation stage to achieve a bumper harvest through wind and rain control, soil improvement, and seed selection. It's not just a matter of 'creating' food.

Zhao immediately thought through the 'Military Rations' skill, which can create 3000 units of food for 10 minutes of magic, even exceeding the 'Food Creation' skill of the three-ring 'Cultivation Magic', which can only create 3 units of food per level.

Although Zhao will have unlimited magic slots starting from level 9, he can't bear the thought of constantly casting the 'Food Creation' spell for 24 hours.

Damn, this war magic is indeed fierce.

Three thousand people would basically wipe out all the acquaintances he knows.

Thinking back to when he had to find food, he had to sacrifice his own meals and secretly divide them among his relatives' children, worrying about the pressure he might feel. Zhao felt a pang of sadness.

Even a two-ring 'Military Mount' can summon 25 light-type horses per level. For example, the two-ring 'Force Field Hurricane' can give 25 targets within a certain range a magic bullet."

Note: I've tried to keep the translation as concise and natural-sounding as possible, while still conveying the original meaning of the text.
Matthew the Elder continues to enthrall Zhao Xudao, directly pointing out two incredibly powerful two-ring spells.

One two-ring spell is capable of unleashing 800 warhorses and simultaneously striking 800 targets with magic missiles. Originally, the numerical value was not exaggerated, but with Zhao Xudao's level enhancement above 20, it produced a terrifying astronomical number.

As a result, Zhao Xudao suddenly realized that war spells were simply an upgraded version of ordinary spells, transformed into a war mode.

The three-ring summoning spell corresponds to the four-ring creation of supplies, the one-ring summoning of a mount corresponds to the two-ring summoning of a cavalry, and the one-ring magic missile corresponds to the two-ring force field storm.

Is it not implied that the war spell itself has vast room for development?

"What specific promises are there?" Zhao Xudao finally could not suppress his curiosity.

In reality, the war spell's enhancement of his personal combat power is limited, but for the entire Earth's forces, it is quite inexplicable.

At this moment, he, despite resisting the promise, must ask about the price.

As soon as Zhao Xudao fell into the trap, Matthew the Elder's entire person finally revealed a sly smile, as if satisfied with the current situation.

He smiled and said, "Mr. Xun, don't rush."

"I also need to explain the shortcomings of war spells to you. Compared to fireball spells with an area of effect of 100 square meters, war spells have an area of effect of mostly 1,000 to 3,000 square meters, with a ten to thirtyfold increase. And naturally, their cost is not small."
Here is the translation of the text:

"The first point is that even the simplest war spell requires at least one minute of casting time, and during this time, it's easy to get interrupted just like other spells that require concentration. Fortunately, the spell itself is a long-range spell, so as long as you hide properly, it's not easy to be disturbed."

Zhao Xu smiled slightly at this.

He has special skills, such as "Multi-Talented Caster", which can change the casting time, so it's not a problem.

"The second point is that before casting the war spell, you need to observe the target area for at least one minute within the past 24 hours to familiarize yourself with the area's conditions."

"The third point is that casting the spell requires a significant material cost, such as creating military rations, which costs 500 gold coins, or silver, gold, or platinum pieces with holy seals."

Zhao Xu didn't seem to be troubled by this question.

As long as his "Supernatural Spell" can cover the war spell, these costs are just an illusion, and he knows that a blessing spell costs 20,000 gold coins, which is not for Anniya's exemption.

"So, what do you want me to promise?" Zhao Xu said with a sigh.

Facing this situation, he had already made up his mind, and as long as it's not too exaggerated, he will agree.

In the end.

"The war spell" is too much.

Older Matthew finally revealed a satisfied expression, understanding that his adventurous endeavor had finally yielded its fruit.

He felt deeply moved, but he didn't dare to act impulsively, and so he just sat in silence for half a minute before speaking.

"I want you to promise me that you won't give up - at - that time,"

As Old Matthew said the promise, Zhao Xu suddenly felt a ringing in his ear, but he still understood the specific words from the other's lips.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Okay, I agree," Zhao Xu said with a calm and composed tone, his eyes gleaming with determination.

"I'm unable to predict what I'll be like in the future, but I can assure you that at that time, I'll still have a heart as pure as a child's."

"Excellent, really excellent," Old Man Matthew laughed heartily. "It's truly delightful."

"Mr. Zhongxia, I know you've sensed that you're carrying a burden unlike anything else," Matthew said, his eyes momentarily troubled before firming up.

"But I can tell you, Miss, that before you entered the secret society's branch in the underground city of Mistralla, which is also the Hall of the Gods' Gate, Miss was hesitant about whether to involve you in the turmoil of this world."

"Miss was still indecisive, wondering whether to drag you into this turmoil. Even the goddess's daughter didn't notice you until that moment."

"If it weren't for Mr. Zhongxia, you would have arrived in Mistralla at the most inopportune moment. Miss would never have rashly dragged you into this turmoil."

Matthew's voice faltered slightly as he said, "So, at the most desperate moment, please don't blame Miss."

As he spoke, his voice trailed off into a hoarse whisper.

"It's all a matter of destiny's choice."
