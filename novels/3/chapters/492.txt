Chapter 493: The Two Aniela

In this world, it's hardest to resist someone's genuine enthusiasm for your benefit. Especially when the other person's starting point is to do good for you, and they're truly sincere about it, it becomes incredibly difficult to resist. If someone lacks strong convictions and has a people-pleasing personality, they'll be even more susceptible to influence.

At this point, Zhao Xu finds himself in such an awkward situation. No matter which angle he looks at it from, the two legendary female wizards' advice sounds reasonable and aligns with his own interests. As someone who has been reborn 10 years ago, Zhao Xu's "rebirth memories" are somewhat usable, but not decisive enough. On the other hand, after traversing 1000 years, even a pig like Zhao Xu could become a legendary wizard under the tutelage of the two beauties.

From a theoretical perspective, it's even more conducive to his character of being invincible.

However, Zhao Xu suddenly relaxes and refuses the kindness of others, finding it hardest to come up with a sufficient reason without hurting the other person. At this moment, a suitable reason suddenly pops into his mind.

"Dear Aniela, and future Lady Sylvia, I'm sorry. Right now, I'm a player from Earth, and I'm currently in a projection state. Under these circumstances, even if I want to stay, it will inevitably lead to catastrophic consequences due to the different timing of the two worlds."

In theory, the current timing of Earth and Arthur is synchronized.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu is currently connected to the current earth and the thousand-year universe, and this temporal difference is easy to trap him in a precarious situation.

"Ah, we know," said Anzhi Noya, reacting. "It's just a matter of bringing your physical body back to Earth, and you'll be able to shake off the habit of eating, drinking, and using the bathroom. You only need to give a straightforward answer."

Sislevina also nodded in agreement, saying, "It seems that the future universe projection plan has finally found its moment of implementation."

"I thought these things were just the imagination of the King of Elf, Ernest, wandering in the sky. I didn't expect someone to successfully recreate it."

"Who knows?" she added. "As long as there is manpower and resources, I can recreate a small-scale device similar to the original about 80% of the time."

Zhao Xu noticed that he seemed to have gained some new knowledge.

"..."

At this moment, Zhao Xu wanted to say something from the bottom of his heart, that these two legendary female wizards were being too good to him.

However, he couldn't bring himself to say it.

Especially, the original world's Anzhi Noya was also waiting for him at some point in time.

If he rashly agreed, he would not only betray countless people from the original world, but also disappoint Anzhi Noya, who was anxiously waiting for information.

"Alright, let's send you back," Sislevina said, noticing Zhao Xu's intentions.

Even Sislevina, who had been clever since childhood, noticed Zhao Xu's inner thoughts.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

She stood entirely in front of the door, with the soft light from outside filtering through her robe and shining onto her body. Suddenly, Zhao Xu saw her figure illuminated by the light.

"Regardless of whether it's a thousand years later, we'll meet again. I just don't know if you'll still remember us by then," Westsilvina turned her back to the two of them, and the air was filled with a sentimental atmosphere.

Zhao Xu couldn't help but glance at the results of his "knowledge" skill check and the dynamic abilities he had just activated, no matter which angle he looked from. However, he was now in a world that was more real than ever.

The two legendary female wizards' enthusiasm for Zhao Xu made him almost believe he was in the "plot" of the "main character" Urmazyr.

"It's goodbye, definitely," Zhao Xu stood up, especially since the Annyonja in front of him had already been intertwined with his "fate" many times.

"Thank you very much for your hospitality and enthusiasm," Zhao Xu expressed his gratitude.

"It's not enthusiasm," Annyonja turned her head, as if she was also doubting her own charm.

With her sharp senses, she also sensed why Zhao Xu was leaving.

Zhao Xu didn't dare to touch his smooth chin again, "Actually, I didn't expect that the teacher and the prince would be so familiar with each other to the point of sharing a room."

"Now is the time," said the Annyonja on the ground, who was sitting lazily, with a face full of fatigue, looking just like the Annyonja from a thousand years ago.

On the other hand, the Annyonja standing by the door had a cold and haughty expression, dressed in the same outfit as Zhao Xu when he went down to the hole. It was undoubtedly the current Annyonja.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Teacher, you've found your way here?" said Zhao Xu with a mix of excitement and surprise.

The person who had personally taught Zhao Xu, Anniya, nodded slightly and said, "You're clever to have found your way here. And after finding this place, you were able to locate me through Sylvina. When I observed my own fate line, I discovered that there was a trace of your existence at a certain node, and I was able to pinpoint my location to this place."

"So, it seems that Grazzle's layout this time was indeed accurate," said Sylvina, who had been standing by the door, but silently gave up her position to make way for Anniya.

The Anniya from a thousand years ago, however, remained silent, her eyes flashing with a hint of provocation as she gazed at the present-day Anniya.

A thousand years of separation seemed to spark a different kind of fire between the two.

The Anniya from a thousand years ago smiled wryly and said, "How did I become so foolish in the future, failing to accurately react to the layout of a demon king?"

"You're as clever now as you were back then," the present-day Anniya shot back, looking at her past self with disdain.

As for Zhao Xu, he was a bit perplexed, wondering how he and himself could talk like this.

"I'm certain that if I had just faced Grazzle back then, I would have definitely gone back to the original time node," said the Anniya from a thousand years ago.

"It's because of you that I was so easily calculated and lost my inner balance point."

Zhao Xu suddenly understood what was going on.

In other words, Anniya had been pulled back in time by the power of time, and in reality, she had the ability to break free and return to the past.

It was just like how she had returned to the same time node a thousand years ago.
Here is the translation of the text:

"It's also so." Westalis, who was standing in the corner, silently gazed back and forth between the two Anniyas who had been separated by a thousand years.

"According to reason, you shouldn't delay too long. Just now, after we spent some time together, we can sense that point. The other party's personality is absolutely easy to be designed into being slower than you by many times when they are drawn into the timestream. Or, it can be said that Glazet's intention is to leave him alone to communicate."

"Moreover, you're bringing your disciple into a dangerous place without taking responsibility."

The thousand-year-old Anniya scolded, "I can't figure out why my future self didn't do a risk assessment beforehand. The first sentence he taught us was 'Eagles must exert their utmost strength to catch rabbits.'"

"One wizard who doesn't have more than three plans for various situations shouldn't go out. Is it possible that you've forgotten after only a thousand years?"

If Zhao Xu wasn't sure that the two Anniyas were essentially the same person, he would have thought that this was a green tea mutual tearing scene.

The future self directly lost all sense of direction.

However, the Anniya at the center of the storm looked down at everyone with disdain, "The reason you think you can do better is very simple."

"Because I know that facing Glazet's summer, there won't be any problems. But if you wander too long in the river of time, he may be pressed by the will of fate and lose his memory."

"For you, the summer without memory is the summer."

"But for me, the summer is the true him."

After saying this, Anniya directly took Zhao Xu's hand and turned back to the original position.

The mysterious incantation accompanied the dancing leaves in the autumn wind, and the two disappeared into the river of time a thousand years ago.
Here is the translation of the text:

"After Anniya's disappearance into the future, she looked back at Xiservina, who was 1,000 years in the past, and asked, 'Did you leave a mark?' Xiservina nodded silently. Anniya said, 'I left one chance for him to go back 1,000 years into the past, and see if he can seize the opportunity in the future.'"
