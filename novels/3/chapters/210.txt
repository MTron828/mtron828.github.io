Chapter 211: Mummy

Zhao Xu's heart skipped a beat as he faced this scene. However, he didn't immediately turn around to look back. He had already caught the scent of the stench emitted by the gathering of undead creatures on the ground when he landed. But now, he detected a pungent herbal aroma instead.

Following this, he heard a low, mournful cry that seemed to come from the depths of eternity. Zhao Xu felt a shiver run down his spine. However, he managed to calm down slightly, having already guessed what kind of undead creature was behind him.

Unlike the mindless undead warriors like skeletons, which lacked intelligence and couldn't distinguish truth from falsehood, higher-level undead creatures were intelligent. Zhao Xu was confident in his own magical abilities.

Although Zhao Xu's appearance hadn't changed, intelligent undead creatures wouldn't immediately discover that he was still alive. They would at most suspect it. Therefore, Zhao Xu didn't rashly panic and flee or grab his "Eternal Magic Wand" to launch a counterattack. Such a move would only lead to him being surrounded by the undead horde and triggering secondary and tertiary magical attacks.

Instead, Zhao Xu mimicked the stiff-legged gait of a zombie, nodding his head and taking slow, stumbling steps back. He deliberately adjusted his direction slightly, adding a subtle arc to his path. As he moved, Zhao Xu strained his eyes to glance back at the undead creatures behind him, trying to confirm whether they matched his initial guess.
Here is the translation of the text:

However, Zhao Xu's movements were very cautious, as if he was intentionally doing something. Even though he had moved away a certain distance, he didn't directly look at the direction behind him at the time.

It was as if he was being cautious about something.

【Adventurer Zhong Xia, you have already entered the area more than 3 rounds and obtained the effect of "True Knowledge".】

When he heard this sentence, Zhao Xu almost let out a voice, but he still delayed the effect of True Knowledge, which meant that all undead creatures in the area could see through illusions.

Fortunately, his "Undead Cloak" was a necromantic spell effect, not just an illusion.

It was really too sinister!

In the end, Zhao Xu managed to snatch a small piece of residual clothing by controlling the light of his eyes, and suddenly his entire body was startled, and he directly closed his eyes.

Ah, it's really like he expected it to be.

Indeed, it was a "Mummy".

The 8th-level mummy was a soulless corpse brought back to life from the bodies of unrepentant killers or villains who died without atoning for their sins.

The 5th-level mummy, on the other hand, was commonly found in the Desert God system, brought back to life from a corpse that had undergone mummification, and they usually specialized in guarding tombs.

After getting a few mysterious notebooks and knowing they came from a mysterious tomb, Zhao Xu had deliberately learned about the common guardians of tombs.

One of them was even mentioned in the notebooks, and Zhao Xu didn't even need to make a knowledge check to memorize the information about the opponent.

The mummy itself had a challenge level, and a 4-man 5th-level team could already consider having enough strength to challenge a mummy.

Zhao Xu didn't dare to look directly at the mummy, naturally, because the opponent and the ghost would both be affected by a single glance.
The mummy itself has a terror aura effect called "Despair" which causes fear in those who look at it. Those who fail to make a DC 16 Will save will be paralyzed for 1-4 rounds due to fear.

Undead creatures are immune to paralysis, fear, disease, and death effects.

If the mummy is unable to paralyze its victims, it will likely attack them instead.

Zhao Xu is wearing a Starlight Cloak that makes him immune to ordinary attacks, but he is still concerned about the mummy's "Corpses' Plague" disease, which is a supernatural disease that can be contracted through physical contact with the mummy.

If infected, the disease will deal 1-6 points of damage to the victim's Constitution and Charisma, and will continue to deal damage until the victim's Constitution reaches 0 and their body turns to dust.

Zhao Xu remembers a classmate who contracted the disease in their previous school, and knows that even a high-level cleric may not be able to cure the disease with a Remove Disease spell.

Therefore, Zhao Xu is extremely cautious and keeps a safe distance from the mummy, careful not to get too close to its fear aura.

After moving out of the mummy's sight, Zhao Xu also takes the time to observe his surroundings.

Most of what he sees are undead skeletons that can be easily dispatched with a single fireball spell.
Here is the translation of the text:

However, the sudden appearance of the mummy also warned him that this negative energy field was not as simple as he thought. Who knows where the dry bones under his feet came from. Especially after just falling from a height, he was suddenly faced with a series of five harm-inducing magic spells, which made him jump in surprise. These five harm-inducing magic spells corresponded to the five healing magic spells, from one circle to four circles, plus a sixth circle. After being hit, the damage exceeded 200 HP, and even 9 Zhaos combined wouldn't be enough to kill him. Luckily, he was using an immortal shield, which made all the negative energy damage heal him instead, allowing him to narrowly escape.

At this point, Zhaos also woke up and realized that the stone slab hadn't been lying. However, he had also made a mistake. He was relying on his own wings to show off by jumping up and expressing his faith. However, he didn't consider that the vertical distance was already six meters, and adding the horizontal distance of one or two meters, he was more than seven meters away from the high platform where he had just fallen. If he had used "Sub-Instantaneous Blast" and "Teleportation Boots" together, he could have returned to the platform. This time, he might have only received damage from the first two spells.

At this point, Zhaos also warned himself that his next actions needed to be cautious and start from the safest angle. Then, he began to walk slowly towards the center of the arena, mimicking the pace of a zombie. He didn't know if any immortal beings were still paying attention to him. After arriving at the center of the arena, he knelt down, took out a forked branch, and began to cast his target magic, the two-circle spell "Item Location".
This spell can be used to search for a specific item that the caster has personally witnessed within the designated area. However, since Zhao Xu has not seen it, he can only use this spell to search for a certain type of item. Generally, the second effect of this spell is not very useful because once the nearest item of the corresponding category is found, the spell's effect will terminate. However, beneath these skeletons, there is only a token key for a teleportation door, so he has no worries in that regard.

Finally, as the spell is cast, an invisible field of perception spreads out, enveloping the entire area along with Zhao Xu's mental agitation. The spell is divided into close range, medium range, and long range, with a fixed distance and an increase in distance as the caster's level increases.

The "Item Location Spell" has a long range of 120 meters as a fixed distance. With each level increase, the caster's range increases by 12 meters, so at level 6, the caster's range is increased by 72 meters. This means a radius of nearly 200 meters, equivalent to a huge space made up of four football fields pieced together, all falling within Zhao Xu's perception range, covering the entire square of corpses below.

As the information continues to be fed back, Zhao Xu's eyes light up immediately. His gaze falls on a position to the left. Even though it is over 100 meters away, Zhao Xu almost wants to rub his eyes when he sees that there are nearly twenty mummies in that area. Clearly, he did not see this from the high platform above at the beginning. It's an illusion! Zhao Xu immediately realizes.
Surprisingly, at first, even what he saw might not be real. It's a pity that some undead creatures have extremely strong hiding abilities, and there are too many skeletons walking around on the field, blocking the view. So Zhao Xu couldn't see clearly what other threats there were in the field.

At this moment, Zhao Xu also began to consider how to obtain the teleportation key hidden under the ground by these 20 mummies.

The current damage of Zhao Xu's "Fireball Eternal Wand" is 5D6 (5-30HP), with an expected value of about 18HP. Due to the bandages, mummies have the characteristic of being "vulnerable to fire damage", which increases the damage by 50% to a maximum of 27HP.

Compared to the opponent's average 55HP of health, theoretically, he would need to cast two fireball spells to kill them all, and there would definitely be some leftovers on the scene.

The worst case scenario would be if all of them were left with a sliver of health and then counterattacked.

Another option would be to take the risk and go over to pick up the things and run. However, if undead creatures were paying attention to him, he would be completely exposed. Even if he were to be exposed as soon as he entered the circle of mummies, he would have to endure being surrounded and killed.

On the other hand, if Zhao Xu got the key and approached the high platform, he wouldn't be in as much danger. In the end, he could rely on the "Minor Burst of Speed" strategy to make it through the final 6 meters.

Therefore, as he watched this scene, Zhao Xu couldn't help but think about how he could safely and successfully obtain the teleportation key.
