Chapter 436: The New Chairman, Zhong Xia

"'Dead, dead, all dead!'"

A poet with a withered face and disheveled hair sat in a daze, staring blankly at the desolate wasteland before him, as if he himself was the corpse lying on the ground.

Just a hundred meters or so away, a ghostly soul demon with an otherworldly physique and long arms was rummaging through the corpse, trying to find a few living people to absorb their souls.

At this moment, it seemed to have heard the cries of the living, and its body remained still, but its head turned sharply 90 degrees to look at the poet's muttering, as if its mouth had been sliced open, revealing a cruel smile.

In the blink of an eye, it lunged at its latest meal, making a "crunch" sound.

However, the ghostly soul demon collapsed to the ground, motionless, like a failed long-distance runner, right before the poet's lost soul.

"'Ah, Cleric Dai, you've managed to subdue a ghostly soul demon with just three rings' 'Soul Binding Technique'! It's indeed a remarkable feat!" A middle-aged cleric suddenly appeared, but was actually flattering the elderly cleric, Cleric Dai.

"'Cleric Dai has always been a master of necromancy, and this technique is nothing more than child's play for him," the middle-aged cleric's companion, a fiery woman, chimed in.

"'I'm excited!" Cleric Dai nodded and smiled.

At this moment, the group of about a dozen clerics behind them, who had all arrived from the northern alliance's capital city using a teleportation spell, were still following them.

The teleportation spell's restrictions had been fully lifted just last night at dawn.

As the time approached, new figures began to appear around the crater, one by one. Compared to the figures that appeared last night at dawn, these ones were undoubtedly not the big shots from the North Alliance or the entire Ice Mountain Range north of it. Even the forces of the gods were present, with this middle-aged wizard casting a casual glance around the crater, where at least ten groups of people were gathered. The city guards of the alliance had also officially arrived, constantly collecting the corpses and wreckage on the ground. "Can you tell what happened here last night, Anze?" the chief wizard, Klae, suddenly asked. Upon being asked, Anze, who was standing at the back, blushed and said, "Chief Wizard Klae, I'm sorry, but I only saw the remnants of fireball magic, and couldn't see anything else." The other wizards around him couldn't help but burst into laughter. After Anze finished speaking, his expression quickly returned to normal. In fact, among the ten or so people present, only Anze and Fleur, the daughter of the leader of the North Alliance, were the ones who had snuck in. The reason they were able to join the investigation team was because of their family ties. Anze, on the other hand, owed his presence to Summer, the player who had killed four directions last night. As a fellow player, he was able to join the team to provide player-related knowledge and advice. "What do you think, En?" Chief Wizard Klae asked, greeting another senior priest with a white beard as he walked by, and then asked the middle-aged wizard next to him. Middle-aged wizard En thought for a moment and said, "Looking at these dead adventurers scattered on the ground, it seems they were all killed by a direct death spell. I guess it might be the sixth-ring death array."
Here is the translation:

At that moment, a few wizards behind him couldn't help but whisper in hushed tones, "Impossible, a death array with such efficiency and power?"

"Yes, after all, a single-target death spell is always a seven-ring spell, and the intensity of a six-ring death array is unimaginable," someone added.

It's no wonder that these young wizards are skeptical.

After all, a death array is a killing spell that can kill a certain number of HP, equivalent to a certain level of living being.

Each level of spellcaster can kill 1-4HD (HP) creatures.

On average, an 11th-level spellcaster can kill a total of 27HD (27HP) creatures at once.

Translated to a team of nine average-level 3rd-level wizards, it would be equivalent to killing 27 creatures.

It's possible that its power hasn't exceeded that of fireball spell.

"No, it was definitely caused by the death array," however, Klay said conclusively.

"How did you do it?" Freya couldn't help but wonder.

Compared to the fiery outfit she wore the last time she met Zhao Xun, this time she was dressed much more conservatively, and her exploration attire was even more imposing.

"I also have a scroll like this in my hand, but it doesn't seem to have this kind of power at all," Freya said, gazing at the massive crater created by the asteroid from the Ai Zhuo Palace, with the bodies of the dead scattered all over the ground, arranged in a circle.

"That's because the scroll in your hand was created by an 11th-level wizard. But the spell released by the other party was created by a 27th-level wizard," Klay smiled amiably.
Here is the translation:

However, Cleric Kiley, this number doesn't match. The power of this spell is capped at level 20, so once you reach level 20, you can kill 20-80 (20D4) life force dice, which is the total life force of the creature.

A young mage asked a question, his face beaming with confidence. "But look at the pile of corpses over there that haven't been moved yet. Based on their equipment and attire, I estimate that they are all around level 3 adventurers, which means that 40-50 people would have at least 150 HD of killing power. This is nearly twice the killing power of 20-level 50 life force dice."

However, Cleric Kiley did not give a praising look, but simply explained in a flat tone, "Because the opponent's spell is stacked with the legendary specialization 'Spell Oddity', which directly increases the effectiveness of these variable spells to twice the effect, so it has increased from the upper limit of 80 to a total of 160 HD of killing power."

As soon as these words were spoken, the mages behind him all took a deep breath in unison.

It turns out to be the legendary specialization Spell Oddity!
They had heard that this specialization required the prerequisites of "Spell Effectiveness" and "Spell Extreme Effectiveness" and that only a 27-level mage could master such a specialization.

"This can't be real, right?"
A staff was used to cast a six-ring spell, which was not uncommon for them. Even these arrogant young mages themselves had touched such a staff.

However, the spell had also stacked the legendary specialization, which was simply unbelievable.

"It's not possible, there's no hint of a divine artifact here, the opponent is just using a magic staff," Cleric Kiley concluded, "Nowadays, young people are really reckless, and the opponent's slaughter is probably exhausting the staff's energy to the point of being drained."

As he spoke, Cleric Kiley couldn't help but take off his glasses and wipe them with a cloth.

"Grandpa Kelay, isn't that so?" Frey couldn't help but stretch out her hand and pointed to the various spell circles lying on the ground. Meanwhile, the middle-aged mage looked at Frey with a kind face and explained, "Don't you think about where these soulless demons came from?"

As he spoke, he pointed to the distant crater in the distance. At this moment, more than ten soulless demons were wandering around, and not a few powerful forces were searching for the battlefield and clearing out these extraordinary undead creatures in the process.

"Can't summon soulless demons with general death magic?" Frey, who was not a mage, had a few magic items with her, but she couldn't quite understand.

"It's an eighth-level high-level soul summoning," the young man in the back said with a smile.

"That's really impressive," he said.

Even with the wealth of Tang De, Frey, who was standing with her back against him, couldn't help but feel a sense of awe at this scene. She stood up and turned around, as if trying to absorb the entire scene into her mind.

"So this is the reason why the player Zhong Xia was surrounded by over a thousand adventurers and managed to break through with over half of them?"

The old mage Kelay suddenly said, "Not at all."

"Ah, the young ones are indeed formidable, and they bring even more formidable magic items," Kelay summarized.

"I'm willing to spend millions of gold coins just to stage a slaughter," said the old man.

These mages were silently following the old man's gaze, looking at the crater in front of them, which was filled with an unknown number of corpses, with most of them scattered and bloodstained, like a chaotic battlefield.

Like a chaotic graveyard...

...Fallen Star Town.
Town gate of Fallen Star Town.
Here is the translation of the text:

The warriors dressed in armor stood at attention on the watchtower, wearing the coveted silver armor that would make outsiders envious. Suddenly, the sudden ascension of the Eldrid Palace shocked the entire Northern Alliance, and countless strong individuals rushed to the site where the falling star landed to investigate.

Meanwhile, the city gate of Starfall Town was heavily guarded to escort the refined silver, and the sentry's strength was not trivial. On this special day, they were even more vigilant.

At this moment, a wizard dressed in a radiant cloak walked up to the city gate. If someone were to gaze at him, they might sense the faint aura of death emanating from his body.

The wizard didn't pause and directly pulled out an introduction letter to hand it over.

The sentry who received the letter opened the red seal and looked down at it with disdain, thinking that a mysterious letter required such great effort.

"'The Northern Alliance Wizard Association, Branch Department, has dispatched Summer Zhongxia to Starfall Town——'"

The sentry suddenly looked up, his eyes wide with surprise, "Who are you?"

"What's going on?" a squad leader who was inspecting the package walked over, about to see what was happening.

But before he could even glance at the letter, his face turned pale.

"Zhongxia, a wizard."

Zhao Xuzi smiled warmly, looking at the sentries in front of him and introducing himself.
