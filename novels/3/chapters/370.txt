Chapter 371: Washing Away the Profound

At this time, Zhao Xu was following behind An Xinyao, walking through the mountain valley. Although he had already possessed the divine step and had complete flight ability, he was still following An Xinyao's pace as she measured the land with her feet.

However, Zhao Xu couldn't help but think that the Gustaf family's "second-hand information" almost got someone killed. It was ridiculous to think that the other party was just a lucky winner who got lucky.

Well, it was indeed a kind of luck. However, this lucky timing was in the era when Ernst developed magical civilization, and the meaning was completely different. At that time, Ernst and the first goddess of magic were contemporaries who could share the autumn mood. The later gods could only be considered as their juniors.

This also meant that the first believer described by An Xinyao was essentially a person from a bygone era, who could still be alive today and could be called a "living fossil". As for the Association of Mages taking no action, it was clear that they knew the inside story but dared not move. Even if the other party was a mage, it was uncertain whether they could successfully take on the position of the second goddess of magic. Under the management of the Association of Mages, which had been operating for thousands of years, the other party would only be controlled by this existence.

"Is your special ability determined by your sixth-grade level?" Anzhenya suddenly showed interest in Zhao Xu's progress.

In reality, it was about planning Zhao Xu's career path, but Anzhenya had already given him some guidance on his career development.

As for the special ability, it was actually Zhao Xu who brought up his needs, and Anzhenya provided him with channels.

"'I chose 'Magical Upgrade'," Zhao Xu answered briefly.

At this moment, the dark night enveloped the two, and their voices were swallowed up, as if even the faintest insect calls had disappeared. This made Zhao Xu suspect that he had entered some unusual place.

"Oh, so you want to use this special ability to bypass the screening of the ineffective magical barrier? But it's not very meaningful," Anzhenya simply commented.

"It's not, can't you increase the difficulty of avoidance?" Zhao Xu immediately gave his starting point.

"Well, you can already cast three-ring spells, even if the difficulty is increased to the equivalent of nine rings, the space is already very small, just six grades. Especially after you can cast higher-ring spells, the growth rate will become smaller and smaller."

"So, you've chosen a special ability with insufficient growth, at least before the legend. It's like that," Anzhenya said, looking back at him with a hint of surprise, as if she couldn't believe that the usually meticulous Zhao Xu would make such a decision.

However, she didn't say anything to Zhao Xu, and instead just looked at him with a hint of disappointment.
Here is the translation of the text:

The "Law Mastery" specialization, due to the limited scope of the player's available specialization slots and the difficulty of learning, has become a popular choice for many novice mages. However, it only increases the difficulty of spellcasting by one level. 

It's still necessary to choose one of the eight schools of magic, and if you choose Plasticity, you won't be able to enjoy the benefits of this specialization. The subsequent "Advanced Law Mastery" specialization also only increases the difficulty by one level. 

Moreover, it's not possible to choose multiple specializations at will. In the specialization system, there are only two levels of difficulty that can be increased. Once you've passed this stage, you won't be able to go back.

As a result, the 6th level of spellcasting difficulty is already a significant achievement for ordinary mages. They can only achieve this by using a 9th circle spell or increasing their intelligence score by 12 points to get an additional +6 intelligence adjustment. 

However, at this moment, Zhao Xu felt a slight chill running down his spine.

"Teacher, do you mean that my spellcasting can only be upgraded to level 9?"

Zhao Xu seemed like a student who had just left the exam room, only to be told that there was still another page. The feeling was incredibly subtle, but it was a sense of shock.

According to his plan, he thought that his magical abilities would be limited by his intelligence score, just like how he needed 19 intelligence to cast a 9th circle spell. 

Next, he was limited by his attribute points, as the premise of the damage attribute was that he had to have enough attribute points to lose the same amount of attribute points to exchange for the same level of magical ring enhancement.

Before An Ti Niu could answer, Zhao Xu immediately doubted himself, saying, "No, I've checked the literature, and there are 10th, 11th, and higher levels of magical circles that can be used to surpass the devil."
Here is the translation of the text:

The Ten-Ring Magic Circle is simply a single magic circle, as there is no such thing as a Ten-Ring Magic. Legendary Magic can be said to be above the Nine-Ring Magic, and it requires the use of the "Legendary Magic Circle". However, the Ten-Ring Magic Circle still has its own uses.

For example, if you want to cast the "Time Stop" spell, which is a Nine-Ring Magic, aside from using the "Higher Magic Wand" given by Zhao Xu, another way is to obtain the Thirteen-Ring Magic Circle, but at a greater cost. "Not wrong," Anniya smiled.

For Zhao Xu's self-doubting question, Anniya had already cleared up the entire issue.

At this moment, when walking through the mysterious maze, facing the "old acquaintance" on a dull journey, it suddenly became somewhat interesting.

"Just, ordinary mages won't have the Ten-Ring Magic Circle," Anniya said.

"How can they not have it?" Zhao Xu was no longer the naive child he was yesterday.

After going through these days of magic training and deeply rooted concepts from his past life, he clearly felt that this was a real world, and it wouldn't change just because the game company got bored and changed the settings.

"The reason is simple, the Ten-Ring Magic Circle is a concept after the Legendary Magic," Anniya said.

"To get the Ten-Ring Magic Circle, you need to get it through 'Progressive Magic Circle' from the Legendary Magic. Repeated choices can also get higher-level magic circles."

Anniya also briefly explained these to Zhao Xu, which would not be recorded in writing and could not be searched through "Legendary Knowledge".

Suddenly, Zhao Xu's mind seemed to burst with numerous thoughts.
Here is the translation of the text:

Although Anzhiya only gave him a brief introduction, he had already realized that the legend was an independent system. Even if it was directly erased, it would not affect Arthur's operation. It was thanks to the legend system that it was compatible with the previous specialties, and therefore "ascension" of a more primitive specialty was impossible without improvement under the condition of not having the ring of ten. "It's hard to put into words," Anzhiya's smile grew even more, "but it's also unfair to blame the author of the introduction to the specialty of ascension, who didn't think that someone could cheat and use ascension without corresponding to the ultimate ring number."

"Ordinary people feel a sense of loss when they ascend too many times," even if the high-level magic name does not live up to its name, but still, there are many useful ones. The author naturally won't remind you that this specialty is only limited to nine rings."

Zhao Xu was silent, saying, "It's just that from the beginning to now, I have chosen the specialty of holding magic. Few people have actually used the specialty of ascension, so I haven't reached the limit of exceeding nine rings."

As a result, he didn't even discover this unexpected place.

"Teacher, it's impossible that no one can ascend to ten rings, right?" Zhao Xu asked.

Even he was determined in his heart, for no one had achieved this before, and he would simulate the specialty himself in the future and fill in the gaps.

He also thinks that he can create a new path for future brothers who can cheat.

At this moment, the two were walking side by side on a narrow mountain path, surrounded by tall grasses and dense foliage, with a winding and hidden path, and it was impossible to see the end of the path.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu, a big man, wouldn't dare to walk on such a dark and eerie mountain path in the middle of the night on earth. Suddenly, An Ti Noya thought for a moment, "This must be true, the legendary skill 'Enhance Spell Progression' can definitely help you break through the ninth circle." She nodded slightly towards Zhao Xu, indicating that he could try his best in this direction.

However, as the person directly involved, Zhao Xu was taken aback and could only shrug his shoulders in resignation. The legendary skill system had actually made up for the limitation of "Spell Progression" and used another legendary skill to break through. Unfortunately, this meant that Zhao Xu could no longer utilize this skill before the legendary era.

"Ah," Zhao Xu sighed, announcing his failure in choosing the powerful skill for the first time. "Don't lose heart, don't you want this skill?" An Ti Noya asked.

Zhao Xu raised an eyebrow slightly. "It just feels like I made the wrong choice." He seemed to be regretting his decision, but he lacked the power to correct it.

"This is nothing," An Ti Noya whispered with a smile. "Want to change?"

Zhao Xu suddenly thought of the time An Ti Noya had replaced the extra skill "Steel Will" she had obtained from half-face with "Spell Flash" for him.

He nodded.

An Ti Noya immediately raised her arm, and a white arm like a jade-like arm emerged from her sleeve, accompanied by a gentle rustling sound. She lightly touched Zhao Xu's chest.

A primal, chaotic power emanating from the depths of the abyss surged towards his heart, carrying a mysterious and disordered aura.

"Do you voluntarily accept the eighth circle spell 'Devote to Chaos', obtain the legacy skill that meets the conditions, and give up one original skill?" the adventurer Zhong Xia asked.
