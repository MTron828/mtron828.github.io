Chapter 243: The Crown Falls

When the pastor "Feng" was struck by the giant sorcerer, but showed no signs of injury, the remaining players around him were deeply shocked.

Unexpectedly, the pastor who was as magical as a god then unleashed two powerful force fields, and the giant sorcerer was instantly paralyzed and unable to move.

At that moment, the only thing the players could do was be stunned into numbness.

The holy knight of the magic goddess and the pastor were both frozen in place, completely unable to comprehend the situation.

Zhao Xu had set up this scenario beforehand, relying on the pastor's abilities and preparing his magic.

Although he didn't know who he would encounter, this set of skills would essentially take down any living being with a life value of 350 or less, just like the giant sorcerer.

The only way to escape was to rely on magical resistance, but the giant sorcerer had no magical resistance and no magical equipment in that department.

Perhaps the opponent might have some and could pull it out depending on the situation, but it would be no match for Zhao Xu's seamless five-magic combination.

The giant sorcerer didn't even have the time to react, let alone pull out magical items.

When Zhao Xu prepared his magic, he directly consumed 1 point of potential and simulated the "Magical Efficiency" specialization, loading it onto the original three-circle holy magic "The Hammer of Justice".

Magical Efficiency requires a high three-ring magical position.

As a result, the extreme version of "The Hammer of Justice" occupied Zhao Xu's pastor's six-ring magical position.
Here is the translation of the text:

This spell was originally intended to deal 1d8 (1-8) damage to evil creatures based on the caster's level. After being amplified, it deals full damage, which is 8 points based on the caster's level. The priest Xu Xian's level is 20, but his caster level is no longer just that. Xu Xian used the level 2 spell "Sacrifice of the Body" to sacrifice 10 points of physical quality in exchange for a 5-level increase in caster level. Then, he used the "Divine Overdrive: Spell Duration" expertise to extend the duration of this spell from 1 round to a full 24 hours. As for the physical quality attribute he lost, he naturally restored his attribute points using a restoration spell. In addition, Xu Xian also extended the duration of the spell "Holy Verse" to increase his caster level by 2 levels, as well as combined it with the level 1 "Magical Tattoo" to increase his caster level by 1 level. Therefore, the current caster level of Xu Xian is 30 levels high, based on the 20th level of the priest, with the stacking of 5 levels from "Sacrifice of the Body", 2 levels from "Holy Verse", 1 level from "Ain's Stone", 1 level from the ritual, and 1 level from the tattoo. His highly amplified "Moral Hammer" can deal 30 x 8 = 240 damage. The ordinary version of "Moral Hammer" expects to deal 30 x 4.5 = 135 damage. In battle, Xu Xian used his latent points to simulate the "Instantaneous Release" expertise to trigger the "Blessing" spell, which is a daily use spell for the divine servant. Then, through the instantaneous release of the blessing spell, Xu Xian simulated the exclusive 8th-level divine spell "Higher Arcane Fusion". This spell allows him to release all his spells of 4th level or lower at once. Therefore, Xu Xian successfully amplified and released both the amplified and ordinary versions of "Moral Hammer" on the spot.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

The direct result of the two attacks is 375 damage.
Even if the giant sorcerer has passed the toughness saving throw and can negate half of the damage, they will still take a real 187 points of damage.
As for the giant sorcerer Tario in the tower, if he has not been upgraded and does not have any additional equipment, the opponent's life expectancy is theoretically 337 points (25D8+225).
After being hit by the two attacks, the giant sorcerer is left with just 150 HP and falls within the area of effect of the 8th-level spell "Order: Stun".
If the opponent gains even 1 HP, this spell will fail.
So Zhao Xiu is also taking a gamble, and he unexpectedly hits the perfect combination.
The spell "Order: Stun" can take effect with just one syllable and does not require a saving throw.
So this spell is a guaranteed hit against warriors who do not have more than 150 life points.
However, Zhao Xiu can only enjoy this once a day, as these are daily spells, unlike the Demon Lord's spells that can be used at will.
His priest's miracle spell is only a simulation of an 8th-level divine spell and 7th-level arcane spell, so "Order: Stun" and "Higher Arcane Fusion" require other channels.
However, Zhao Xiu does not relax, and he even doesn't have time to look back at the status of the giant behind him.
For enemies with 100-150 HP, "Order: Stun" can only stun the opponent for 1-4 rounds.
At this time, Zhao Xiu saw his dynamic prompt, and he had stunned the opponent for 3 rounds.
So he must do what he needs to do quickly - read the giant's memory.
The opponent mentioned "Arcane Notes".
This name reminded Zhao Xu of the "Midsummer Magic Diary" that he had compiled from two notebooks with unlimited pages in his backpack.

He needed to dig deeper to uncover more truths and analyze why the opponent had designated a magical priestess of the goddess of magic.

Zhao Xu was staring at the giant demon in front of him, who was three to four times his height, but he had to face a difficult problem.

Most spells that deal with consciousness control and memory reading require willpower resistance.

Zhao Xu's spell difficulty was based on a foundation of 10 levels, with the rest determined by his perception (divine magic) and divine magic level.

The giant demon's willpower resistance was directly 23 levels, combined with its intention resistance performance (1-20 levels).

In general, Zhao Xu's spells had a difficulty of over 30 levels, making it impossible for him to read the opponent's thoughts.

Even if he used his "Cerebral Web" spell, which had a difficulty of 27 levels, it would be challenging to deal with the giant demon.

However, Zhao Xu was not flustered.

He was a 20-level priest with potential points.

If there was something he couldn't do in this world, it was unlikely that others could do it either.

Zhao Xu had not planned to target willpower resistance at the beginning, as the battle was urgent and he didn't have time to bother with it.

He had also calculated the damage of his spells, assuming the opponent could negate half of it.

To attack willpower resistance, one could weaken the opponent's willpower or increase one's own willpower resistance.

"Miracle Simulated - Insight of the Hawk."
Here is the translation of the text:

Suddenly, a five-ring druid spell was cast on Zhao Xu, giving him a boost in perception attribute - for every two levels of the spellcaster, he could gain one point of perception insight. Instantly, Zhao Xu's perception attribute, which was previously 25, skyrocketed to 40. The difficulty of the seven-ring spell he was about to cast also increased to 32.

Just in time, Zhao Xu didn't hesitate to simulate the "Mind Spider" spell, a seven-ring divine spell. At this moment, he was the happiest priest in the world, and he could easily simulate any divine spell below the eighth ring without thinking twice.

Zhao Xu's potential allowed him to recover nine-ring and one-ring spells with just one point. He didn't bother to combine different "Multi-Casters" spells.

As Zhao Xu finished casting his spell, the giant sorcerer's willpower also failed. Suddenly, an invisible spider's leg landed on the giant sorcerer's forehead. Then, a stream of information began to flow into the giant sorcerer's brain. In reality, this spell could choose eight targets with the spider's eight legs. However, Zhao Xu wasn't interested in the two original people of the Arthurian origin behind him.

As for the player, they were under the protection of the gods, and the spell was temporarily ineffective.

Slowly, Zhao Xu began to obtain the surface thoughts of the giant sorcerer. He then searched through the spider's leg to retrieve all the thoughts about the "Notebook" designated by the giant sorcerer. Finally, he obtained some specific thoughts and detailed memories of the group.

As the information flowed into Zhao Xu's brain, he slowly discovered the truth. It could be said that the giant sorcerer's memories were directly excavated by Zhao Xu.
Here is the translation of the text:

After completing these tasks, the 3-minute deadline for the "Trembling" effect is about to expire.

Zhao Xu didn't want to reveal too much in front of the players and directly displayed his magical abilities, such as the Nine-Ring Restrictive Technique.

As Zhao Xu's strange, glowing light touched the giant at the entrance of the dark tower, the other party immediately fell into a fake death state and then disappeared as if it had never existed.

Or, to say, the other party was sealed away to the deepest part of this land.

Then Zhao Xu turned around and walked back to the players behind him, where only seven people could still stand.

"It's been a while since we last met," Zhao Xu said with a warm smile. "I suddenly received a message last night and had to leave without warning. Who would have thought that I would see you again under such circumstances?"

Cui Lu quickly stepped forward and introduced Zhao Xu to Saint Warrior Aite and the cleric Robin.

Zhao Xu only just realized that Cui Lu's team had encountered several assassination teams sent by the Mineral Association, with one team almost being wiped out.

Fortunately, they had met Robin and Aite, who were investigating a missing persons case. With the help of the two men's 5th-level abilities, they were able to fend off the attackers and then set out together to the town.

"May I ask who you are?" the cleric, who was also a goddess, asked with a trembling voice, full of reverence.

He had already seen the powerful magical abilities released by Zhao Xu.

As one of the few people in the scene who knew the extent of Zhao Xu's strength, he asked the question.

However, Zhao Xu did not give a formal answer.

He gazed at the bodies lying on the ground, which had just been killed by the giant and then defeated by him, all within a minute.
Here is the translation:

So, the bodies of the seven or eight players on the ground were still there, but some had already become transparent, and if they were left alone for a bit longer, they would officially die.

"Uh...!" Suddenly, Feng Ge, who had been performing CPR on Zhang Qi, burst into tears.

Standing beside her, Cui Lu's eyes also became red, as she knew Zhang Qi had obtained the Revive Stone.

Zhao Xu sighed and then raised his hand, pointing at the corpses on the ground and saying, "Please let these adventurers who have sacrificed their lives for justice come back to life!"

A sacred light descended from the sky, and the hymn of the Saint began to resonate throughout the area.

The originally fallen people suddenly had their wounds healing, and their breathing returned. Then, one by one, they gradually woke up, wondering how they had been brought back to life by a mysterious power from the Saint's Cathedral.

As Robin witnessed this miraculous scene of resurrection, he couldn't help but ask, "Crown, Crown?"

In Arthurian legend, the term "Frown" refers to three types of people: first, a divine incarnation; second, a papal bishop; and third, a chosen saint.
