Chapter 213: The Fearful Spirit

The Fearful Spirit's entire body resembled a lightweight fabric piled high in mid-air, drifting as if it were a ghostly entity. However, its essence was entirely composed of darkness, with red glints flashing in its eyes as it fixed its gaze on Zhao Xu, regarding him as prey.

Zhao Xu, without hesitation, activated his "Darkness Knowledge (Tactical)" ability, attempting to find the weaknesses of the creature before him.

His only impression of the Fearful Spirit was its name and the fact that its challenge level exceeded 10. In his past life, he had heard of a weakened version of the Fearful Spirit, with a challenge level of 5.

From the drifting figure's body, it was clear that the Fearful Spirit was similar to a ghostly entity, a type of undead being with no physical body.

In the past, the ghostly entity had rendered their team powerless, with half the reason being the entity's own formidable abilities, which included active range attacks such as "Terrorous Howl" and passive attacks like "Corrosive Gaze" and "Corrosive Touch". These attacks, which could erode attributes, made up the "Ghostly Spear" of the ghostly entity.

The "Undead" trait was the "Shield" of the ghostly entity, also serving as the shield of the Fearful Spirit before him.

To counter the Undead, only magical weapons could be effective, and even then, there was only a 50% chance of success.

As Zhao Xu was still searching for knowledge and analyzing the situation, the Fearful Spirit had already swooped down, closing in on him.
Here is the translation of the text:

As Zhao Xu's entire attention was focused, his years of combat experience told him that the enemy's attack power was at least over 15 levels above. Even with the stacked mage armor and shield spell, he was not sure if he could block it.

Just as Zhao Xu was thinking, the "Fearful Binding Spirit" in white misty form, with a spectral hand filled with deathly intent, touched him.

At that moment, the cloak he was wearing burst with starlight, shining brightly.

【The adventurer, Zhongxia, was attacked by the "Fearful Binding Spirit" with the "Body Empty Touch" attack, and the star cloak activated its effect, granting immunity to the attack.]

Zhao Xu's heart skipped a beat, but his face remained calm.

Originally, he would prioritize self-preservation, but in this situation, he had to judge based on his own guesses, rather than seeking the greatest gains.

Zhao Xu judged that the "Fearful Binding Spirit" had no magical weapons.

As long as the enemy's innate weapon did not possess magical properties, it would not be able to penetrate his star cloak's defensive layer.

At that moment, his knowledge of dark arts and religious knowledge also provided him with feedback, allowing him to instantly understand the characteristics of the "Fearful Binding Spirit".

Zhao Xu had just dodged the attack, but the attack effect was called "Body Empty Touch", which would absorb 1-8 points of vitality once successful.

The key was that the super natural ability's difficulty was as high as 25 levels.

Zhao Xu, with his 14 vitality, would not be able to withstand two or three rounds of attacks before dying.

As the knowledge feedback said, the creatures killed by the "Fearful Binding Spirit" would be transformed into puppets, or ordinary "Binding Spirits", and would become slaves to the enemy after death.
Here is the translation of the text:

So, the ancient and terrifying "Feng Ling" usually only appears in forgotten temples and abandoned tombs deep in the depths.

However, even though the mummies behind him have risen, Zhao Xu still hasn't taken the initiative to attack.

This negative energy field causes 10 points of negative energy damage per round, and once he takes action, the effect of the "Unkillable Shroud" spell will cease, putting Zhao Xu's life value in a precarious situation.

On the other hand, he is relying on the protection of the Stellar Cloak and is safer as a result.

The undead creatures surrounding him mostly have effects that can damage his physical body, but their supernatural abilities will not take effect unless they hit him.

Therefore, Zhao Xu is in a state of invulnerability to damage before the undead creatures cast spells or use magical weapons.

This is also the reason Zhao Xu has no choice but to choose the Stellar Cloak.

When the mummies rush to attack Zhao Xu, they see that the "Feng Ling" attacks him without any reaction and are all in a state of hesitation.

Or, the fear of higher-level undead creatures causes intelligent creatures to learn to wait patiently.

The "Feng Ling" that comes to attack Zhao Xu sees its attack failing and becomes angry, letting out a loud roar.

Unfortunately, the roar has no supernatural effects and is just a terrifying sound effect to Zhao Xu.

On the other hand, the ghost with a challenge level of 5-6, which has supernatural abilities, requires Zhao Xu to avoid its attacks.

These creatures with only one type of attack, from the "Super Miniature Variant Spider" with a challenge level of 1 and below to the "Feng Ling" with a challenge level of 11, are all unable to be dealt with by Zhao Xu.

This is also the effect of the team, with everyone's abilities complementing each other, becoming more comprehensive and able to overcome various difficulties. When facing a powerful enemy with magical resistance, Zhao Xu would initially find it challenging, just like when facing ordinary undead creatures. At this time, the "Fearful Binding Spirits" in the distance also sensed the situation and floated over.

However, when Zhao Xu saw the shadow of one of the "Fearful Binding Spirits", he almost wanted to run away, and even considered using his "Teleportation Boots" to create distance.

A "Fearful Binding Spirit" with a thicker body was floating towards him, its hands not retracting into its body but holding a ghostly scythe.

Later, Zhao Xu used the "Enchantment Weapon" spell to imbue the giant sword in Maple Leaf's hand, making it possible to deal damage to a spiritual entity, as magical weapons are effective against spiritual entities.

However, this effectiveness is only increased from 0% to 50%, and there is still a 50% chance of failure. This is because spiritual entities exist between the material plane and the spiritual plane, and it's unknown when wielding a weapon whether the opponent is in the material plane or the spiritual plane.

This is the legendary state of superposition, also known as the Schrödinger state.

However, when the "Underworld" attribute appears, all problems are solved.

The "Underworld" attribute is rare, except in a world where there are many ghosts and spirits. Zhao Xu had never seen a strong warrior wielding such an attribute before. By default, spiritual entities cannot wield magical weapons. However, with the "Underworld" attribute, spiritual entities can use magical weapons.
Here is the translation:

This also means that the "Fearful Spirit" holding the "magic weapon" is actually a weapon that can cause harm to Zhao Xu. Although Zhao Xu successfully dodges the attack and can avoid half of the damage from the magic weapon, the problem is that the "Fearful Spirit" can still cause harm to Zhao Xu's supernatural abilities, which are based on his physical attributes. At this point, Zhao Xu enters a state of calmness, like a still pond. He knows that this battle has exceeded the normal difficulty level. Even if a mage of the same level as him were to come here, they would not be able to survive without his powerful equipment. The Mage Association is not like the kind of story where geniuses are eliminated, but rather, it welcomes geniuses and even expects their appearance. Therefore, this difficulty level is somewhat strange.

Or, when the farmer who takes care of the flowers and grass at the manor points him in the direction of this place, it implies that he is special, so the difficulty level is higher. This difficulty also leads Zhao Xu to discover another clue - that Wang Qingwei and others did not enter from here. There are multiple entrances to the "Half-Plane of the Devouring Beast". Naturally, they may appear at different locations in the "Half-Plane of the Devouring Beast".

After Zhao Xu's calmness subsides, countless associations related to this challenge begin to surface in his mind. Meanwhile, the "Fearful Spirit" holding the giant scythe also draws closer to him. Zhao Xu just finished a knowledge check and obtained the perfect result of 20 levels. Therefore, he gained numerous pieces of information about the "Fearful Spirit". One of them revealed the "Fearful Spirit's" weakness - that it will lose its ability and flee in the sunlight.
Here is the translation of the text:

Unfortunately, it's not "flame" but "sunlight", otherwise Zhao Xu would have pulled out the fire torch from his backpack.

The "daylight technique" that can create a "sunlight effect" is the Three-Ring Technique.

It's a joke to say that Zhao Xu is at the level of a dead person right now.

Who would have thought that facing a challenge with a level 11 "Fearful Binding" and a life die of nearly 16HD, Zhao Xu could be suppressed by just one "daylight technique"?

This is the power of knowledge.

Slowly, the "Fearful Binding" approached Zhao Xu, within a distance of about 6-7 meters.

Zhao Xu smiled calmly, as if he didn't care about his own life or death.

Until the "Fearful Binding" approached Zhao Xu, reaching the attack range of the giant scythe, it swung its scythe wildly.

The followers of the God of Death consider the "giant scythe" with the "beheading" magic attribute to be a sacred instrument. Because once they succeed in a heavy blow, the scythe not only deals quadruple damage as the strongest weapon, but also has the effect of "beheading" - harvesting death.

But it was too late.

Zhao Xu's entire body suddenly burst out with a powerful radiance, like the sun descending upon the square.

The holy magic "Radiant Shield"!
