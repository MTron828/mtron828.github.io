Chapter 335: Cumulative Explosion

As soon as they realized that the devil was casting a spell, the faces of the two priests, Branich and Matthew, turned pale.

The old man who had been summoned for an interview looked pale and gray, almost wanting to close his eyes and not look at the cruel scene that was about to unfold. Even he, who was also affected, knew that his life-long church had been disgraced today.

No one could have imagined that the devil, with a mere 7th-level challenge rating, could upgrade to a 13th-level priest in just one day, reaching the level of casting the "Blasphemous Language" spell.

This spell's power is determined by the caster's level and the target's hit dice (HD).

It only affects non-evil creatures, and if the HD exceeds the caster's level, the spell has no effect.

However, if the levels are equal, the spell will at least cause a dizziness that lasts for a round.

As the level difference increases, the negative effects will gradually worsen, causing states such as paralysis and weakness to stack up.

Even if the difference exceeds 10 levels, the target will be killed directly and will not require a saving throw.

This is one of the few instant death spells that cannot be resisted with a saving throw.

In an instant, all the novice priests with a single hit die, who were still in attendance, heard the ominous and mysterious "curse" sound of the "Blasphemous Language" and their brains turned into a mushy mess, and they all bled from their seven orifices.
Here is the translation of the text:

A group of players who had finally gathered to receive training suddenly sat quietly in their seats, their eyes white as they stared fixedly at the podium in front of them. They had died peacefully.

【Adventurer Xiaoyue, you are affected by the "Profane Language" spell. Your 5HD and spellcaster level difference is over 10, and you are immune to the effects of death.】

【Adventurer Xiaoyue, you will experience dizziness (1 round) and numbness (1-10 minutes) and pass through the exemption judgment. You will also experience weakness and fail the exemption, reducing your strength by 6 points (range 2-12) for 4 rounds (range 2-8 rounds).】

【Adventurer Xiaoyue, due to the "Shield of Life" effect, you are immune to the "Profane Language" death effect.】

The three warnings caused Zhao Xu to feel a bit disoriented. At the same time, his strength suddenly dropped to 2 points, lower than the average of 3 points of a monkey.

If he hadn't successfully resisted the numbness and dizziness effects of the spell, he would have been lying there waiting to be slaughtered.

But no one could have guessed that Zhao Xu had already fallen within the range of the instant death effect of the other party, which was 5HD.

This means that the demon was either a 15-level or higher priest or carried an item that increased the spellcaster level, such as Zhao Xu's "Ain Stone".

Luckily, Priest Blanch, who had a premonition, had applied the "Shield of Life" to Zhao Xu before, allowing him to escape this calamity.

Otherwise, he might have become the first person to die under the instant death spell with a piece of the God of Death's fragment.

After the spell, Zhao Xu quickly scanned the entire scene.

To his surprise, even the 6-ring priest Blanch was affected by the "dizziness" and could only barely stand, completely lacking the strength to cast spells.
Here is the translation of the text:

As for Matthew and the old priest, it's unnecessary to mention them. The priest, Matthew, directly fell into a state of paralysis and plummeted from the air. The old priest, who was only 5 levels, died on the spot due to his low level.

Zhao Xiu had faced the deep-level demon, knowing that it possessed the ability to freely use its "Profane Language" spell. He directly used the "High-Level Immune to Magic" spell to nullify the demon's magic.

At that moment, facing an unknown-level demon, he was able to directly defeat them, leaving them completely off guard.

This is the terrifying aspect of a demon that has accumulated over 10 levels and has a level surpassing 20.

The player can utilize the profession's resources, which appear on monsters and other NPCs, making them even more terrifying.

This left only Zhao Xiu, with only 2 points of strength, still standing, with only 5 levels.

At this time, the demon with six life dice, hovering in mid-air, looked at Zhao Xiu with a mixture of surprise and interest.

Although the demon was only at the mid-to-low level in the Abyss, it relied on its shape-shifting ability to sneak attack adventurers.

It was only this kind of demon, with over 10 levels, that dared to challenge Zhao Xiu directly with its own strength.

However, it was clear that Zhao Xiu was completely within its grasp.

The only slight threat was Brandy, who was dizzy for six seconds, which was enough to kill Zhao Xiu.

However, Zhao Xiu just happened to glance at the already deceased novice priests in front of him.

His eyes were slightly melancholic, as if he was reminiscing about his past memories.

In his previous life, he had witnessed the destruction of a town, and suddenly felt an overwhelming sense of anger.

This time, he would not let tragedy unfold again.
Zhao Xu let out a soft sigh, and then looked at the demon with a determined gaze, saying, "Go back."

In an instant, the golden hourglass on Zhao Xu's chest began to shake violently, and the sand at the bottom suddenly flowed back up, pouring back into the upper part of the fine-mouthed bottle.

The second hand on the wall clock also started to move backwards, ticking away six seconds.

In that moment, all the novice priests who had been preparing to revive their souls in the "Creation Hall" were forcibly pulled back. Their faces, which had been covered in blood, suddenly became clean and dry.

The old priest who had died on the ground, as well as the paralyzed priest Matthew, both returned to their original positions.

Zhao Xu's "Temporal Reversal Talisman" caused the time within the classroom to reverse back to six seconds before the original time.

Although no external influence was felt, everyone in the room, from Blanch to all the players, including the demon, was shocked by what was happening.

The demon was momentarily unable to understand the reason before it, and did not dare to make a move.

"Time reversal?" an old priest muttered to himself, his eyes wide with astonishment.

If he hadn't felt the vibration of the goddess's power emanating from Zhao Xu, he would have kneeled down and praised the gods.

He knew that even the "Prayer of the Nine Rings" or the "Miracle of the Nine Rings" might not be able to achieve such a feat.

The players who had been revived, on the other hand, were even more astonished.

Although they had no knowledge of what had happened after their death, they were certain that they had just heard the strange voice of the all-black, grotesque creature before being cursed to death.

And then they revived right where they were?
Here is the translation of the text:

Is it not true that even the Revival Stone or the Five-Ring Divine Art could resurrect Arthur? Moreover, this is not a group resurrection spell, right? Those who choose the path of the priest know that with only five lives, Arthur, who possesses the resurrection art, will be an existence of unparalleled grandeur, and will be able to reap immense benefits in this game.

However, at this moment, even more fantastical thinking can only succumb to the reality that is unfolding. Everyone can only stare blankly as Zhao Xu displays his formidable abilities, simultaneously lamenting their own insignificance and being amazed by the power of these high-level priests.

Zheng Xin'an is also deeply contemplating Zhao Xu, whose eyes are filled with deep thought as he wears the black sacrificial robe. At this moment, the entire scene is most clear in Zhao Xu's mind, and he directly shouts, "Not yet, don't relax!" reminding Blanc to react immediately.

Because Zhao Xu is aware that his "Chrono-Reverse Talisman" is a simulated Nine-Ring Spiritual Power.
It is not a true "Chrono-Reverse", so the external flow of time remains normal, and the memories of those who have been reversed will still exist.

Therefore, it is impossible to deceive the demon for a long time, and eventually, it will react after being touched by the power of the Abyssal God. It is not a true "Chrono-Power".

As expected, within a short time, the demon began to flap its wings again, charging towards Zhao Xu.

Flying in mid-air, Priest Matthew was suddenly swooped by the demon and had to desperately try to intercept it.

Meanwhile, Blanc is worried about the opponent's "Blasphemous Art" ability, which is currently being cast to protect the novice students in attendance.
Here is the translation of the text:

As she saw this scene, the elderly woman's heart was also deeply troubled, fearing that if she gave up her current technique, the demon would continue to slaughter the novice priests, causing a scandal. However, she chose not to protect Zhao Xū, and he was basically exposed to danger.

Ultimately, Blanchet could only grit his teeth and continue with the current technique. The Holy Rose Cross was, after all, a sacrifice she had to make ahead of time. Each member should bear their own fate, and when it's time to die, they should die without hesitation.

The novice priests sitting in the classroom had a few who were quick to react, but even if they managed to throw a book or hard object, it would have no effect on the demon at all. The others could only look on anxiously, watching Zhao Xū, who was their target, as he was about to be struck by lightning. Zheng Xin was praying with all her might, hoping that the priest who was supposed to save them would come back safely.

They were witnesses to Arthur's historical event, but due to their own lack of power, they could only "witness" it simply. Meanwhile, Zhao Xū remained calm and quiet, holding up his legendary death spirit staff, which he had been hiding from the start. He pointed it at the demon priest who was about to attack him and said, "Death's Pointer."

"Potential Unleashed!"
