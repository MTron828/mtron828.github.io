Chapter 576: Teaching Mode

As he spoke, this was Zhao Xu's third time encountering the undead giant insect Night Shadow. The first time was during his journey to find the amethyst sarcophagus with divine power in the land of the sleepers.

The second time was when he encountered it with An Ti Nuo Ya and Wei Wei An in the tomb of the ancient elemental gods. On that occasion, he directly used the Iron Hammer of Justice and combined it with the Twin Born Extreme, killing the opponent on the spot.

Night Shadow is composed of pure darkness and evil power, and has already reached a middle-high level of undeath. Currently, there are three known Night Shadow creatures: the Winged Night Shadow, the Shape-Shifting Night Shadow, and the Giant Night Shadow. Each of them has unique powers.

For example, the Giant Night Shadow has an intelligence of over 20 points and can formulate a battle plan based on the enemy's situation. Before us, this Giant Night Shadow launched an attack with over 30 levels of biting ability, which is basically something that most current players can do. However, this behavior is more due to a sense of mischief. When people started running away, it suddenly pulled out its Frost Needle ability and attacked the crowd.

"Look, I'm going to use this Giant Night Shadow as an example to tell you about Arthur's middle-high-level monsters."

Zhao Xu looked at the Giant Night Shadow in front of him and spoke.

At this point, everyone had already cast a stunned and admiring gaze at Zhao Xu.

This is naturally due to Nan Xiao's sentence "Zhong Xia Ge Ge". Zhong Xia is a strong target that many players strive to reach in the game, and is also a strong target that first-rate players pursue.
Here's the translation of the text:

But from the very beginning to the end, no one was able to approach this radiant "name" even slightly.

It wasn't until the last month that everyone finally narrowed the gap between levels to just one level, but everyone was still confident that "Summer" could break through this limit and reach a new dimension at any moment.

After crossing over, accompanied by multiple notifications to the entire group, "Summer" became a well-known name in the non-player community.

Or, to put it another way, this name became the hope for many lost souls.

However, just as everyone was filled with confidence, Zhao Xu suddenly spoke up, causing those who were full of confidence to hesitate.

If Arthur, who could be considered the strongest "player" in the game, could kill an 18-level, nearly legendary giant monster like Night Shadow, no one would find it strange, and some would even actively stand up to questioners.

But now, is Summer really going to use the "Night Shadow" to develop a "teaching model"?

Even eagles need to spread their wings to soar, and even pretending to be someone else needs to consider the circumstances.

Many people who have seen online examples of people pretending to be someone else and ending up looking foolish are also worried for Zhao Xu.

Summer didn't die before he arrived, which was just bad luck.

But he has arrived and is already developing a teaching process. If he doesn't pay attention and causes a "teaching collapse" and someone dies, it will inevitably tarnish the bright and radiant name of Summer.

However, Zhao Xu, who is focused on the key point, doesn't care.

He immediately noticed that his childhood friend, Nan Xiaoyu, was still having some trouble, as if she had entered a stagnant air pocket.
Zhao Xu looked around and saw that most of the classmates of Nan Xiaowei, who were only seventeen or eighteen years old, were in the same situation. He even recognized a few of them, as he had crossed paths with them at the KTV that Nan Xiaowei used to go to. "You all feel nauseous and uncomfortable now, but in essence, it's the same as staying in this 'barbaric dead land'," Zhao Xu judged, looking at the restless giant worm night shadow. "Because they themselves emit negative energy just like this land. So sometimes, passing by the giant worm night shadow, you might even think there is an evil temple nearby."

"We call this ability 'profane spirit energy', a kind of halo-like supernatural ability with a radius of 6 meters. Once you step into its range, you will be affected. It's like angels have protective spirit energy, which can resist evil creatures and protect against low-level spells."

While Zhao Xu was describing the situation, the giant worm night shadow closed its mouthparts again and began to brew the next spell. But Zhao Xu was not just sitting around waiting for it.

"Radiance refinement!"

A defense spell using a nine-ring top-level arcane, instantly cast by the Book of Ten Thousand Laws. Zhao Xu's whole body was covered with 17 mysterious silver spheres. These silver spheres, about the size of his head, floated around him, constantly circling.

In fact, the only two types of spells that posed a significant threat to him from the giant worm night shadow were "death finger" and "monster immobilization spell". The others were not a big deal for Zhao Xu. Under Zhao Xu's control, each of the spheres created by radiance refinement could absorb arcane spells or similar spell abilities targeting him. These absorbed spells could also be stored in the spheres and transferred to other people at Zhao Xu's will.
When Zhao Xu saw this spell, he immediately thought of a way to abuse it. He would use these light orbs to absorb spells that "only affect oneself," and then transfer them to others, such as the Ghost Strike technique. Although the Radiant Refinement could not absorb divine spells, it was enough to deal with the giant night shadow in front of him. In the blink of an eye, as Zhao Xu completed the spell, the giant night shadow also emitted a destructive breath full of deathly power. In an instant, all the power of curse in the void surged toward Zhao Xu's body along with the arcane radiance, causing screams from the onlookers. The legendary "Death Curse"! However, Zhao Xu remained calm and used his mind to control the "silver light orb" to envelop his entire body, blocking the power of the "Death Finger" curse. "Adventurer Zhongxia, your Radiant Refinement light orb has captured the 'Death Finger' spell." The next moment, the light orb emerged from his body again, now also containing the power of the deathly spell. Without hesitation, Zhao Xu manipulated the light orb and shot it back at the giant night shadow. As a mage, Zhao Xu could perfectly replicate various combat techniques. However, when the light orb containing the power of death encountered the scales of the giant night shadow, it evaporated like a dewdrop on a hot iron, having no effect at all. In the end, the "caster level" of the Book of All Laws was just too low.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Just now, I used my spell to capture the enemy's death spell, which is one of the strongest spells in the Giant Night Shadow's dark magic ability, similar to the binding spell of the nine-ring group monster and the interdimensional teleportation. However, it can only be used once a day.

I just reflected the Giant Night Shadow's spell back, but it was blocked by the enemy's 'spell resistance'.

If you don't have a level 11 or higher magic user, it's impossible to break through the Giant Night Shadow's spell resistance, which is over level 31.

Zhao Xu chuckled and said to the players preparing to cast their spells, "Of course, if you use spells that don't require spell resistance, that's okay. The flash dust spell, for example, can cause blindness and make attacks lose half their effectiveness. It's very important."

"Don't worry, I won't mess up this play," Zhao Xu reassured. "When the Giant Night Shadow counterattacks, I have at least ten ways to block it."

"Time reversal chain" and "resurrection" are all backup plans Zhao Xu has in case he messes up.

Not to mention, his swift explosion spell can always block the enemy's performance before the Giant Night Shadow acts.

"Ah, Xiao Yu, our companion was just swallowed by the enemy. Can you save him?" South Small Yu finally regained consciousness, her voice trembling as she spoke.

"It's easy."

Zhao Xu nodded and said, "Dance light spell!"

He used this zero-ring spell to create several light balls around the Giant Night Shadow, shining like guiding stars, leading everyone to observe the area.

"The Giant Night Shadow is extremely skilled at catching, and once it succeeds, it will immediately activate its swallowing ability. I'm sure your companion was also swallowed like that just now."
Here is the translation of the text:

However, even if you make a mistake, don't panic. The "Swallowing" ability of the Giant Worm Nightshade, which is established on its enormous belly, can accommodate even a giant of over 30 people. Even if you're swallowed, you still have a chance to struggle. As long as you can deal more than 35 HP of damage by slashing or piercing, you can break free from the belly. However, the Giant Worm Nightshade's self-healing ability is quite high, so the wound will heal quickly.

Zhou Xu was curious about this. Heaven knows how many Giant Worm Nightshade bellies the mage who researched this used as a substitute to estimate this damage.

As Zhou Xu was talking, he suddenly disappeared through a "Portal" in front of everyone.

When his figure reappeared, he had already attacked the Giant Worm Nightshade from the side.

Since ancient times, mages have used "Portals" to create distance. At this moment, Zhou Xu used it to engage in close combat.

With his hand holding a giant sword, Zhou Xu took advantage of his "Religious Knowledge" to understand the structure of the Giant Worm Nightshade's body. He aimed at the belly and slashed.

"Dark Knowledge!"
"Knowledge and Piety!"
Two academic abilities burst out at once, allowing Zhou Xu to clearly understand the Giant Worm Nightshade's weak points.

At this moment, the Giant Worm Nightshade seemed like a piece of wood with a grain, allowing Zhou Xu to cut along the grain.

"Bang!" The sound of the Giant Worm Nightshade's hard shell was shattered by Zhou Xu's "Ghost Strike" technique, ignoring its natural armor. Even with the added 16 points of strength and the insight bonus from his knowledge, it was still useless against the Giant Worm Nightshade's natural armor.
Here is the translation of the text:

As everyone witnessed Zhao Xu's mighty and brutal sword, which directly sliced through the opponent's stomach, leaving everyone in awe. Even the warriors among them couldn't help but feel a bit uneasy. However, this also allowed them to see the two bodies being digested in the stomach, which were still struggling to survive.

At that moment, no one dared to approach and retrieve the bodies, as the wound in the stomach was rapidly healing. "Mind control!" Zhao Xu suddenly chose the "Mind Control" spell, a spell that could exert a force of over 300 pounds, sufficient to extract the two bodies from the stomach.

However, accompanied by a dull thud, the two bodies fell to the ground, but without any signs of struggle or pain, indicating that they had already become lifeless corpses. Even within half an hour, these corpses would be consumed by dark energy and transform into undead beings.

Zhao Xu sighed and said, "In the instant the Giant Night Worm attacked, besides the biting damage, its attack also carried 'toxic' effects, causing 2-12 points of damage each round. Furthermore, if swallowed, one would suffer 14-30 points of blunt trauma and 12 points of acidic damage. Moreover, if one failed to withstand the spell's resilience check, they would lose 1 level and have their life force drained." Zhao Xu described the severe consequences of being swallowed.
It is clear that the two people who were just swallowed have not even had a chance to recover from the initial damage. It's even less likely that they could escape by cutting open a path through their stomachs.

The giant worm Nightshade also starts to feel a sense of fear, realizing that the man in front of it is not as simple as it thought. Although it has "Lawful Defense" that allows it to easily bully those who are weakened by magic, the man in front of it is able to almost stab it with a single sword swing, making it feel a sense of fear.

As a result, Nightshade instantly gives up on its plan to attack and lets out a mysterious, eerie cry, as if it is calling out to its companions.

"This is Nightshade's summoning ability, commonly seen in high-level monsters such as demons and devils, which can summon a batch of lower-level hellish creatures at will."

"Nightshade can also summon undead creatures every night, with a team consisting of 9-16 shadowy figures, 3-6 higher-level shadowy figures, or 2-4 bound spirits of fear."

As Zhao Xu's dialogue ended, the shadowy figures and bound spirits began to appear before the crowd, releasing a sense of decay and death that made people even more uncomfortable.

Even a few people who were already inwardly complaining that Zhong Xia did not need to be so sincere in order to demonstrate to them that it was not possible to summon monsters. "It seems that our luck is not very good. Summoning usually takes 1-10 rounds to arrive, but who would have thought that it would arrive in the first round?" Zhao Xu laughed. "However, the problem is not big, as these summoned undead creatures will usually serve Nightshade for an hour, but we can ask them to leave ahead of time."

"Magic is effective, Magic Chain, Magic Twin, God's Hammer!"
Here is the translation of the text:

As the undead creatures were still getting used to their new bodies, Zhao Xu had already completed his spell, sending a wave of force field hammers accompanied by residual energy flying towards them. These summoned undead creatures all took two hits, and the ones that were hit were already severely injured.

【Adventurer Zhongxia, your "Justice Hammer" single-target attack deals 2 times 264 (33D8) = 528 damage.】

Generally, the best way to deal with summoned creatures is to destroy them, but if the cleric is strong enough, they can also dispel them. Zhao Xu said this with a nonchalant tone.

As the giant insect night shadow saw Zhao Xu's "Justice Hammer" spell, which dealt thousands of damage, it began to tremble with fear.

"Yes, it's now afraid and is activating the 'Interdimensional Transmission' spell," Zhao Xu analyzed.

However, Zhao Xu said, "We need to stop him."

"This place is prohibited from transmission!"

Zhao Xu took a step forward, and instantly, a faint green barrier with a subtle glow appeared on his body, locking down an area with a radius of 6 meters.

Within this 17-day (level/day) area, any attempt to cross dimensions, including teleportation, doorways, and phantom bodies, would be ineffective.

As Zhao Xu spoke the "Law" in his mouth, he naturally completed the 8-ring spell "Dimension Lock" in secret. Similarly, the 4-ring dimension anchor spell required his spell to hit the opponent before it could take effect.

"It can't teleport, so it will have to walk on its own two feet," Zhao Xu said.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

At this moment, the giant insect-like creature, Shadow, had twisted its body, preparing to burrow back into the ground. The people watching shouted loudly, yet they didn't dare approach to stop it. "Now, it's almost time to wrap up the introduction, and we'll take care of this giant insect-like creature," someone said. "Death binding!" A three-ring spell cast by the incantation "Death Binding" firmly bound the "giant insect-like creature" in place, making it unable to move. "Come on, one person, one knife, let's kill it."
