Chapter 525, The Legitimate Line, Invites Battle

Zhao Xu, who has always been aloof in front of players, naturally did not have the initial guard mentality when he saw familiar people like Zhang Qi in front of him in the Fallen Star Town.

He recalled Zhang Qi showing off his strength attributes in front of him in his previous life and telling him that having over 20 points of strength is what makes a real man.

Zhao Xu couldn't help but smile and ask, "Guess."

"25?" Zhang Qi guessed the number.

At the same time, his girlfriend Feng Ge, Fang Xiyue, Cui Lu, Du Nan, and others behind him all looked at Zhao Xu with curious eyes.

Strength can be one of the few data that can be directly quantified.

Generally speaking, 10 points of strength corresponds to a maximum carrying weight of about 90 pounds. It means that the character can lift things that weigh no more than this weight over their head, or even drag items that are 5 times their maximum carrying weight.

And 25 points of strength is already a maximum load of about 720 pounds.

But Zhao Xu shook his head, "More than that."

Zhang Qi couldn't help but widen his eyes, "30 points?"

Upon hearing this data, the group of students with attributes that were not even over 20 points were all open-mouthed, as if waiting for this game's top player to give a definite answer.

"You can guess more boldly," Zhao Xu reassured.

"Are you kidding me?"

At this moment, Zhang Qi finally realized the "gap."

30 points of strength is already the average level of an elephant, and a maximum load of 1500 pounds is no joke at all.

It's no wonder Zhang Qi only guessed 5 points each time. In fact, this was already a wide range of speculation.
Here is the translation of the text:

It can only be explained that the opponent's upper limit has exceeded his imagination. The difficulty of attribute origin has led many players who have realized this to delete their accounts and buy a new one with high attributes to start over.

The 28-point starting attribute is a one-time opportunity for each account, and it is also the only official "cash-grabbing" opportunity for Arthur.

"Forty points," suddenly stood behind Zha Qi, the captain of Zhao Xu's team, Cao Xi Yue loudly exclaimed.

Zhao Xu then said softly, "Almost there, 43 points."

The 8-point innate power, 6-point divine blessing, and 5-point internal value of the strong physique manual, as well as the 24-point value of the unknown domain of decline, are Zhao Xu's current foundation.

The maximum load capacity of over 4 tons is the reason why Zhao Xu can crush the stone devil with his bare hands.

"My god."

Hearing the number 43, Zhang Qi almost didn't believe his ears and thought his eardrums were broken.

As for the remaining Cui Lu and a few others, even with sufficient psychological preparation, they were still shocked to the point of disbelief.

"What are the comparisons with the divine power of 43?" Zhang Qi swallowed hard before asking.

"The ancient dragons, their power level is around 41-42 points."

"..."

Without a reference point, this answer instantly spread and caused countless players to gather to watch the commotion and whisper to each other.

As more and more players came to watch the commotion, even some players began to ask him about advancing methods.
Here is the translation of the text:

It's worth knowing that there are many players who are eager to revive themselves, and there are also many who are quick to draw their swords at the slightest provocation. Who knows when another player will emerge to challenge him and prove themselves?

Zhao Xu couldn't help but raise an eyebrow, "I apologize for startling you all just now. To make amends, I'd like to invite you all to the 'Deep Blue Song' nearby to take a break. Would you like that?"

"That sounds great," Zhang Qi exclaimed, and everyone behind him nodded in agreement.

As for Arthur, everyone knows that his true identity as the "Summer Solstice" holds a wealth of secrets.

From Arthur's current exchange rate on the black market, if Summer Solstice were to casually drop a word, it might just be the "secret code" to getting rich.

Cui Lu, as the leader of a few people, also nodded slightly, "This is also an honor for us, Mr. Lord."

When Zhao Xu smiled, his mouth curved upwards, "Thanks for the praise."

The Deep Blue Song is a famous gathering place in the Starlight Town, known for its secrecy and exclusive atmosphere. The entire process is accompanied by the "Frozen Blue Dew" wine, which is famous throughout the region.

Zhao Xu had originally planned to find an opportunity to "get to know" Zhang Qi and others in the near future.

Regardless of whether it was the doubts of the town management about the "Lord's Authority" yesterday or the various "exemption certificates" today, the town officials still sent a patrol team, claiming to "assist" in resolving the scene's issues. On the other hand, they were also taking the opportunity to investigate Zhao Xu's mistakes.

Even if he failed to capture that stone statue demon and caused "injuries to residents," he could imagine the kind of "public opinion climate" he would face.
Here is the translation of the text:

He is someone who does not care about what others think, acting according to his conscience, which is not driven by greed, hatred, or destructive desires. The devil is easy to fend off, but the tiny demons are hard to manage.

Zhao Xu, who has controlled the entire public security department in his previous life, has at least ten patrol teams under his command. He is well aware of the "short-sightedness" and "weather-vane-ism" of these low-level individuals.

They are too familiar with the principle of "a gentleman can deceive others with a square" (meaning to deceive others by appearing to be honest and fair).

In Zhao Xu's previous reading of history, there are many cases of officials who were deceived and taken advantage of by local families after they became county officials and were left to manage local affairs on their own.

Moreover, Starfall Town is not Mistral, and there is no magical environment here.

If it weren't for the players who appeared, these people who have never left the town might not have experienced magic even once.

As a result, their reverence for magic is mostly based on hearsay rather than firsthand experience.

The two disadvantages of "initial arrival" and "magic fame is insufficient" make it difficult for Zhao Xu, even with his dual roles as President of the Magic Association and Lord, to intimidate others.

Yesterday, the town's high-ranking officials dared to come and negotiate with him.

Even today's patrol teams will only report to the authorities and start the compensation process if they see anyone injured. Unless Zhao Xu is not concerned about his reputation, he will definitely be taken advantage of during the compensation process, and may even be bought out by new people.

Therefore, "establishing authority" and "installing loyalists" are the actions Zhao Xu needs to take next.

Yesterday's "fear spell" and killing three "stone ghost demons" with bare hands were both part of his efforts to "establish authority".

And now, people like Zhang Qi, whom he has gotten to know, are the second step in his plan to "install loyalists".
Here is the translation of the text:

Even from the moment Mr. Stra was brought in, with a warm and cordial atmosphere, there was a certain consideration from the association's top-tier officials.

Facing this, Zhao Xu could only let out a sigh.

He had already vaguely sensed that the "contradiction" between the central and local authorities, which had existed since ancient times, was also present in the wizard's association.

As Zhao Xu and others entered the luxurious "Deep Blue Song" room, the people around them only stopped looking at them.

Zhao Xu chose a position near the floor-to-ceiling window in this attic room, where they could gaze out at the scenery outside through the single-glazed window. This was a rare indulgence for the limited Arthurians.

"Mr. Zhongxiao,"

Cui Lu, who was wearing a chainmail shirt and had her long hair tied up, looked at Zhao Xu and said, "I think you invited us here not just to apologize."

"No mistake,"

Zhao Xu nodded slightly.

However, what was going through his mind was the "Iron Blood and Bravery" method employed by the "Falling Star Wizard's Association" when it was established. As a result, the apprentices who had committed crimes and fled to the association's headquarters were not dared to enter without permission, and Zhao Xu, as the leader, had to apply for permission first.

But now, even though it hadn't been completed, the other side was able to come and go freely.

"I mainly want to investigate the rumors among these local players in Arthur."

Zhao Xu began to speak using this information, which was more clear to him than to the people in front of him, and was also a kind of implicit verification.

"Mr. Zhongxiao, you're a fake number one, come and fight!"

Suddenly, in the room where most of the voices had been isolated, a loud shout from the outside echoed through the room, indicating the intensity of the anger and the loudness of the sound.
In the instant, the people in the private room also changed their faces, unable to bear the anger, and it was a slap in the face to them.

And when he heard the invitation to battle, Zhao Xu also couldn't help but sigh.

He remembered that he had just broken into the "Elder's Palace" and slaughtered hundreds of ambushers, and how could it be that now there were players flying around like this.

And it was unthinkable that he would be used as a stepping stone to prove oneself?
