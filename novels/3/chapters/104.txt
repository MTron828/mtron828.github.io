Chapter 105: The Gathering of the Guild

In the hearts of the people of Arthur, the towering architecture of the wizards' guilds meant mysterious experiments and the terrifying power to summon the wind and call the rain. This place was also mentioned in the town's legend as the most frequent occurrence of demonic wails at midnight.

Therefore, the town's administrators would often divide the area into sections, separating the wizards' guild from residential areas to avoid causing panic among the residents. Humans are like this - they both worship powerful and mysterious forces while also being afraid due to their ignorance.

This was also the reason why Zhao Xuguang was surprised when he entered the town of Yueya and saw that the nearby wizards' guild was stationed there.

After finishing his conversation with Feng Ye, Zhao Xuguang quietly pushed through the crowd and headed towards his destination.

Compared to the typhoon city, the town of Yueya near the southern forest had more diverse inhabitants, and Zhao Xuguang accidentally bumped into a dwarf who was shorter than his waist.

As an old bird, Zhao Xuguang was still cautious and carefully protected his backpack, not knowing what might be hidden inside. After all, the backpack might contain a "hand skill" master thief.

The hand skill was a professional skill of the vagrants, and it was also their trademark. This made them known for a long time as thieves.

Even some street loafers who were looking for opportunities to swindle outsiders noticed the scholar-dressed Zhao Xuguang and carefully examined him, especially his backpack, which looked like something of great value.

After all, Anzheni did not disdain to cultivate simple and rustic skills. Most adventurers who had spent a lot of effort and money on their equipment and decorations rarely paid attention to such things.
Here is the translation:

As soon as they discovered that Zhao Xū's destination was the Association's headquarters, they all immediately changed their demeanor, looking down and avoiding eye contact, fearing that Zhao Xū would notice their past malicious intentions.

Looking at the entrance of the Association, where the mysterious symbols of the eight magical factions were painted, Zhao Xū shook his head and walked in.

He was starting to doubt whether he had a talent for deception, as his 14-point physique, which was robust and athletic, led several rough-looking men to mistakenly believe he was a bookish scholar.

As soon as Zhao Xū stepped into the Association's entrance hall, he was directly stopped by someone who recognized his unfamiliar face.

At that time, there were already many service counters set up in the hall, with staff busy with their respective work.

Zhao Xū directly pulled out the wizard badge from his pocket and handed it over.

When he left Mistral, Anzhiya had taken back the old badge from his hand and replaced it with a formal wizard badge.

The badge had a circular ring on it, indicating that he was a first-level wizard who could cast first-level spells.

If he could cast ninth-level spells, the badge would have nine circular rings and be referred to as a nine-ring wizard.

The young maid responsible for welcoming guests had a few freckles on her face as she politely accepted Zhao Xū's badge and began to inspect it.

The badge had a line of text written in common language in the middle: "Wizard Association / 1st Level Wizard / Zhong Xia".

The text outside was surrounded by a circular ring, which was constantly rotating, allowing the maid to understand that this was a genuine wizard badge.

Compared to forging a badge, stealing a new wizard's badge might be easier.

At least, no organization on the continent had ever attempted to replicate such craftsmanship, or had the courage to do so.
Here is the translation of the text:

Just as the maid was about to return the badge to Zhao Xǔ, letting him go to the front desk to handle the relevant business, she suddenly realized that this badge was thicker than usual.

On top of the ordinary badge, there were some special badges!

Recalling the words of her supervisor, the maid quickly turned the badge over, revealing a thin silver plate embedded in it. As long as the clasp was opened gently, the plate could be removed, making the badge look like an ordinary one.

But the maid was trembling as she read the text on the silver plate - "May magic be with you, please assist the badge holder with all relevant matters. - Os"

The maid couldn't help but swallow hard, her eyes fixed on Zhao Xǔ in disbelief.

In a small town, someone had once seen a badge like this before, when her supervisor was hosting a guest from the association. At the time, she had received a high-level wizard from the association, who had seen this badge.

The words inscribed by the other party were far from what she had expected - just "Please cooperate with relevant matters".

Even without anything else, the name "Os" alone meant a lot - the head of the association, Arthur, was not necessarily the strongest wizard, but he was definitely the most powerful person.

Zhao Xǔ understood the weight of his badge and spoke softly, "Take me to see the person in charge here."

Anzhiya had told him that normally, he would remove the silver plate with the inscription, making his badge look like that of a first-level novice wizard. However, he would only do so when he really needed help.

In fact, Zhao Xǔ held this badge, and he could borrow several level 9 scrolls from the town as long as the town had them. The condition was that the town had them.
Here is the translation of the text:

"The association president and vice president left yesterday, and now there's only the chief administrator left in the branch. I'll take you to see him," the maid said hastily, still bowing her head.

At this moment, several employees in the hall had looked over curiously to see what was going on.

"Don't worry, I'll take you," Zhao Xu said softly, although he was in a hurry. He didn't like to show off his authority to ordinary people.

The maid quickly led Zhao Xu.

The Association of Mages is generally organized by city or town, with branches set up in various locations. The leaders of these branches are usually mages with a certain level of power, who are often busy researching magic themselves. Except for a few individuals with strong desires for power, most don't bother to get involved in the association's daily affairs.

As a result, the association's daily affairs are often handled by the chief administrator, a position that is also the pinnacle of achievement for many mage apprentices.

Even mages who know their family members lack the gift of magic still send them to become mage apprentices, just to meet the requirements for the chief administrator position.

After walking down a long corridor, Zhao Xu finally arrived at the end of the second floor, where he was about to meet someone.

The other person, introduced by the maid, took the badge from Zhao Xu and examined it carefully before returning it to him.

"Respected Zhong Xiaofu, I am Li Wei, the chief administrator of the Moon Tooth Branch of the Association of Mages," the chief administrator said after introducing himself, bowing his head to Zhao Xu before inviting him to sit in the main seat in the reception room.
Here is the translation of the text:

It is clear that he has already thought that Zhao Xu is a core staff member from the headquarters of the association, possibly even a relative of a high-ranking official.

If the chairman and vice-chairman were present, he might be able to use his seniority to assert himself.

As Li Wei, a former official who has long since cut ties with the association, he didn't have the courage to do so.

"Can we do anything to help you? Please feel free to instruct us," Li Wei said humbly, pulling out a packet of expensive tea leaves to brew for Zhao Xu.

Zhao Xu, who had never even stepped foot in the association's offices, couldn't help but feel astonished at the association's strong sense of superiority and bureaucratic red tape.
