Chapter 31: Against the Tide

As Zhao Xu slowly reacted to Anzheniya's tone, he realized that everything that had just happened might not have been as simple as he thought.

He hastily recounted the scenes he had seen, from being transformed into a female mage by a devilish charm to the final determination he had shown in reciting the incantation.

"Pffft!"

Zhao Xu's words were interrupted by Anzheniya's stifled laughter.

"Let me remind you of one thing: whatever you say today, you'd better not spread it to others, or you'll have a hard time forgetting this dark history of yours, haha...".

Anzheniya's expression had already given way to uncontrollable laughter.

"Hey, self-respect is also a player's right, isn't it?" Zhao Xu retorted.

"First of all, without a magical position, reciting incantations is completely ineffective. If you ever encounter a devilish charm in the future, you'd better not waste your time reciting useless incantations, but rather run away with your tail between your legs."

Zhao Xu was immediately taken aback, realizing that those incantations were just his own emotional indulgence.

"However, you haven't acquired any related demonic knowledge in the past few days, and yet you instinctively reacted without being kissed by the devil. Your intuition is indeed very sharp."

Zhao Xu could only take this as a consolation prize to salvage his dignity.

"However, didn't you see a giant circular plate with a mechanical watch-like mechanism on the ceiling during that time?"

As soon as Anzheniya asked her question, Zhao Xu suddenly fell into deep thought, with his full attention captivated by the female mage.

Under the intense impact of that initial encounter, Zhao Xu's eyes narrowed, and his pupils constricted.
Here is the translation of the text:

"It's not wrong, it's not a blank screen, but a circular plate, with markings like a clock face on the outside, and I can't remember the rest."

Anzhen Niya almost scratched her forehead.

She waved her arm directly and posed, chanting incantations in her mouth.

Zhao Xu widened his eyes, staring straight at his opponent.

This was the first time Anzhen Niya had performed such an obvious spell in front of him.

The last time, her opponent had cast the "Prayer Spell", a ninth-level spell, without making a sound, and he couldn't even notice it.

Now, she was casting a spell with such intensity, it couldn't possibly be a legendary spell?

Zhao Xu counted silently in his heart for more than six seconds before a mysterious light ball emerged from the tip of Anzhen Niya's finger.

The light ball gently fell to the ground, transforming into dust.

The entire floor, like a kicked-over pile of blocks, scattered open, and Zhao Xu's heart skipped a beat. He thought to himself, "I won't fall from a great height, I won't fall from a great height."

However, flying is a third-level arcane art, far beyond his reach.

Moreover, Anzhen Niya was currently maintaining the spell, completely unaware of his thoughts.

Just as everything was about to happen...

Zhao Xu realized he was still standing in the same place, as if being supported by invisible glass.

The floor continued to evolve, cracking open and then reassembling, along with the surrounding space.

After half a month of exposure, Zhao Xu had finally reacted, realizing this was Anzhen Niya's illusion spell.

It wasn't that she had directly shattered the land.

The illusion took shape quickly and slowly.

Zhao Xu's mouth opened wide as he saw before him the countless books stacked to the sky, layer upon layer of overlapping bookshelves, and staircases rising step by step.
Here is the translation of the text:

There was also the giant wheel above, and Zhao Xu finally understood that this was a map of the 27 main dimensions of the Arthurian world. From the hero's domain of Joseph's Garden to the gray wasteland of Hades, and from the deep and turbulent abyss to the empty tunnel, all of which were situated on top of it. It showed how this world operated.

Suddenly, like a broken dream, the fake curtain that had been gathering around disappeared, and was torn apart point by point. Like a vast cloud of dust, it was washed away by a sudden summer rain. The illusions stopped, and Anniya stood where the original female wizard had stood, looking at him.

Zhao Xu was also clear that what had just happened was not a test for him. That female wizard was not a demon in disguise. Zhao Xu's expression showed a deep sense of concentration.

"Five-level magic, mirage, it seems to have restored to its original state, similar to what you saw just now," Zhao Xu said, nodding to indicate correctness.

"What is the name of that lady?" Zhao Xu asked, his tone slightly more polite.

He was already worried that a sudden lightning bolt might strike.

"Legend Wizard Sylvina," Zhao Xu's eyes widened in surprise.

Zhao Xu was stunned. Sylvina was the goddess of magic and knowledge.

But at this moment, her title was still that of a legendary wizard. Wasn't it said that she was one of the three in one?

"That throne is the throne of the Law Emperor, which has consumed countless resources of the ancient magic empire to create. The seat you saw is just a part of it, and the rest of the body is buried underground, which is also the core of the sealing spell."
Here is the translation of the text:

"So, what you see on the pedestal is just its outer material that's not worth anything. Those who are suitable to become mages will sit on it and activate their own arcane circuit, condensing a spellcasting position. However, those with special talents will exhibit extraordinary powers. We will arrange our future research and advancement plans based on this."

Anzhiya paused and gazed deeply at Zhao Xun, trying to read something from his face.

"You have potential, so you'll be different from ordinary people."

"I, who also have potential, will automatically recover one spellcasting position when I sit down, including the apprentices."

"Today, I'm letting you sit down to relive the same experience, so that this batch of mages will submit to you and become your future disciples."

Zhao Xun was taken aback, and even Anzhiya was surprised by this revelation.

"But do you know what happened when you sat down?" "What?" "You disappeared."

Zhao Xun was stunned for a moment before slapping his thigh and regaining his composure.

"Do you mean I vanished? But I didn't feel any sense of transmission."

"It's not transmission; you've crossed the river of time. You went back to the era before the third generation of Sisylvina's ascension, to the truth temple of the final scroll."

"She walked over to you, naturally curious about someone who's moved against the flow of time to the past. It's not a demon trying to kiss you. You'd better forget about this idea, or you'll never be able to become a 1st-level priest."

"So, I'm curious - what's your greatest quality, since your potential is not your greatest trait?"

"In An Ti Nuoya's language, there was a sense of laughter. Zhao Xu's face was calm and unwavering as he looked at him. The reason was very simple: he was a reborn person."
