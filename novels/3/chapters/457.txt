Chapter 458: Pursuit

After hearing An's words, Zhao Xu was actually quite eager to correct him.

If there was no evolution, the ordinary production type of winter wolves would have a life value of around 50 HP, and could be killed by a team of four people with an average level of 5.

Of course, if facing 30 winter wolves, even a team of 10-level players would be at the mercy of the wolves' attacks.

It's only when engaging in actual combat that one can truly understand the meaning of "hard to defeat a strong opponent". Without martial arts skills, ordinary people would be at a disadvantage, and even more so against a group of winter wolves.

As for the "white dragon" above the winter wolves, that's not even worth mentioning.

The age range of the "young dragon" and the "ancient dragon" is the same as the "white dragon", but the challenge level is different, at 2 and 21 levels respectively.

The "white dragon" is one of the five-colored dragons, and they are basically from the chaotic evil faction. They can spit out a cone of frost and are not likely to kill you directly. Instead, they often leave you half-dead.

The habitat of the "white dragon" is the cold mountain range, so it's not uncommon for them to appear in the northern alliance near the icy mountain range.

On the other hand, the "black dragon" that prefers to live in warm swamps is rarely seen in this cold region. Zhao Xu has always been puzzled by the sudden appearance of the "black dragon" in his previous life.
As the scream echoed through the air, a heavily armored guard who had been holding a large steel shield faltered and fell to the ground, severely injured by the wolves' icy breath. The guards, who were already clumsy with their heavy shields, were unable to dodge the wolves' attacks, which were as devastating as fireballs.

The guard's body froze in place, as if turned into a statue, and he showed no signs of movement or breathing. It was as if he had left the world.

"Ack!" the young man, who had been protected in the center, let out a loud cry when he saw his loyal guard, who had been by his side since childhood, fall to the ground.

If they didn't warm up the cold quickly, the cold would soon seep into their bones and they would be ready to meet their maker.

The guards, including the young man, were now prey for the wolves, who were drooling and snarling, their eyes fixed on their next meal. They were like pieces of meat on a chopping board, and it was only a matter of time before they were devoured.

The guards, including those who could be revived, closed their eyes, resigned to their fate, waiting for death to arrive.

"I, Freyr, will die at the paws of these wolves today," the young man shouted, as if venting his last breath of fury. "I don't know who is behind this, but my brother-in-law, the leader of the Northern Alliance, Tang De, will avenge me one day!"

Meanwhile, the wolf leader behind them ignored the commotion and continued to howl, using "Giant Language" to drive the pack forward.

As for the cart that had just appeared, it simply glanced at them and then jumped over, as if it were a mere trifle. This cart, which didn't even carry the guards, was either extremely powerful or a new adventurer.
Here is the translation:

In general, most of the latter part of this group of adventurers are unaware of how many times they have blindly ventured into this kind of commercial adventure.

It's just like a late-arriving dish.

At this moment, its target is to eliminate this group of adventurers, and only then can it satisfy its master's will.

When Zhao Xu heard the name Tang De, his eyes suddenly lit up.

He even forced himself to recognize the name of the person in front of him, or rather, recognize the name of the opponent.

In his previous life, when Zhao Xu arrived in the capital, Tang De's sister, the mistress of the ice mountain trade, had already become the favorite concubine of Tang De. However, she died suddenly during childbirth and left behind a corpse with two souls.

Tang De's uncle, the big uncle of the ice mountain trade, also disappeared from view and became a legendary failure in the mouths of others.

As for the vast wealth, it goes without saying.

Originally, Zhao Xu just regarded these as gossip, but now he has learned through An Sheniya that Tang De is backed by the demon lord behind him, and he also controls a "notebook".

So he must take it seriously.

Perhaps this uncle of Tang De, who lost his prestige in his previous life, will be the suitable occasion for him to intervene in the city of Oulu.

At least, he doesn't need to follow the path of Tang De's illegitimate daughter, Fu Lei.

After all, Zhao Xu may cause Tang De's father to lose his reputation, even his family and life.

At this moment, Zhao Xu's gaze fell on the pack of wolves that had pounced fiercely, and his eyes began to sharpen.

Wolves, cold-blooded and immune to cold.
The price is fear of fire, so fire damage can cause an additional 50% damage.
Here is the translation of the text:

At this point, the merchant caravan also thought about this, but the torches they held were too weak to have any deterrent effect, and even if they waved them around, the strong winds would extinguish them in the cold. "Energy protection," Anzhiya noticed that Zhao Xu was about to take action and immediately cast a spell to boost him, relieving him of any worries.

Alternatively, it could be seen as endorsing his decision.

Zhao Xu immediately looked at the wolf pack, his tone colder than the snow.

"Spell extremely effective!"
"Spell born twice!"
"Fireball spell!"
In an instant, Fred, who was standing among the crowd, saw a small fireball flying towards the wolf pack and immediately felt delighted.

This is a three-ring mage!
But he soon realized it was not enough.
The fireball spell of a three-ring mage could only deal 6-30 points of damage, with a maximum of around 16-17 points.

Even if these wolves were as stupid as they seemed, they wouldn't be able to dodge the fireballs, and it would take at least three fireballs to kill them. However, in reality, it was impossible to face these wolves, which were agile and quick, with their powerful limbs. Without at least four or five fireballs, it was impossible to defeat them.

Even an identical mage with magical items wouldn't be in such a desperate situation.

As for a three-ring mage, preparing a fireball spell was already a stroke of luck. Not to mention that the method itself was already two-headed, and even if he was lucky enough to encounter an opponent with a fireball spell wand or scroll, he would still need to be able to cast it.

Fred gritted his teeth and made up his mind, determined to protect the mage as long as he had a means of continuing to cast fireballs. This was the only lifeline that these refugees could grasp.

However...
Here is the translation of the text:

In the next instant, the fireball spell landed in the midst of the wolf pack, and it immediately exploded. Fred and the guards who knew the spell, including those who had seen the player's fireball magic before, all stared with their eyes wide open and their mouths agape. The fireball spell that had burst open was like a simultaneous explosion of dozens of gas cylinders, generating a massive airflow mixed with the sound of explosions. The entire pack of wolves was instantly swept away by the powerful gust of wind. The scorching hot flames engulfed the wolves' shiny coats, just like cooking meat on a barbecue grill. The wolves' coats were no longer intact, and their bodies were left charred.

As the fireball spell dissipated, the remains of the wolves lay on the ground, their once smooth coats now gone. Even in the midst of the howling wind, the guards caught the scent of real meat. "Is this really fireball magic?" "Maybe we misjudged it, or maybe it's the legendary nine-ring explosion?" "It can't be fireball magic; I saw a mage in the city who killed escaped slaves with a fireball spell, and it only killed a few people without causing such a burning effect."

The guards who witnessed the scene couldn't help but mutter to themselves, repeatedly drawing on their own experiences to convince themselves, as if their worldview had been greatly shaken. Meanwhile, they looked at Zhao Xu's eyes, which had changed from "helpless sorrow" to "fear and reverence". Zhao Xu was satisfied with the "180HP" (increased damage by 50%) displayed on his information panel and nodded in satisfaction.
Here is the translation of the given text into English:

The caster level of his spell, which makes him cast a fireball spell, directly reaches the 10th level cap of 10-60 damage, and with the additional effect, it is 60 damage.

Adding the double damage from the twin-born, even the Winter Wolf Chief lies dead on the ground.

However, it's not surprising that he did so, since these Winter Wolves are standing so close together.

Just then, Fred approached him with a humble tone and asked, "Excuse me, sir, can I ask you something?"

However, Zhao Xu's gaze passed by him and went straight to the distant snowstorm.

"Ah!"
"It's the White Dragon!"
At that moment, the guards also followed his gaze and shouted in surprise.

In the distant snowstorm, a white dragon directly flapped its wings and flew away, stirring up the snow on the ground.

Zhao Xu was caught off guard, wondering why the white dragon didn't follow the rules?
Did it just flee?
What about the prestige and dignity of the dragon race?

In an instant, Zhao Xu activated his own flight ability and chased after it.
