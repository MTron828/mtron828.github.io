Chapter 570: The Mysterious Messenger, Visitor from Outside

"Don't rush, everyone. Let's form a line, and each person will get their share of food," the warrior priest of the faith magic goddess declared, taking a deep breath.

Below him was a sea of mud-covered people who had traversed the earth, having spent the day toiling and laboring. Despite their exhaustion, they couldn't help but glance at the food being transported in.

To prevent the disaster-prone travelers from fighting over the food and to ward off various dangers, the powers of the great gods' temples had dispatched their forces to the wilderness. Besides the clergy, the warrior priests had been specially instructed to accompany them.

Meanwhile, Robin, the pastor, was directing the novice pastors as they distributed the thin gruel, while keeping an eye on their surroundings.

"It's not very similar to the camp we went to yesterday," Robin said to the warrior priest, Atte, standing beside him.

"Indeed, these people don't look as desperate," Atte summarized.

On the surface, they were just ordinary members of the team, but secretly, they bore the responsibility of gathering information and finding suitable "candidates" for the organization. Behind them, several novice pastors who had been recruited from a camp yesterday were preparing to return and receive training in the church and warrior priest training.

This period ranged from four to five years to ten to twenty years. Therefore, many of the earthlings who had been chosen heard this time frame and had all given up.

Because they had heard that players had completed their training in just a few months.
Here is the translation of the text:

"It's possible that the number of players in this camp is large, so the message feedback is quite timely, and they also believe that the goddess will come to this place, spread her blessings, and naturally there's no need to be anxious. After Saint Warrior Ett thought for a moment, he concluded.

However, the crowd of people who received the bowls of porridge looked at the bowls in their hands with bitter expressions, with a uniform expression.

As a gift from the Goddess Church, people had to recite the incantation on the bowl before eating, to praise the Goddess. According to what the priests said, if this ritual was not completed, the "stable" magic of the bowl might not be activated, and the bowl would break apart in a few days.

Therefore, most people, even those who didn't know who the Goddess was, still recited the incantation sincerely.

In this time of famine and poverty, shouting that they wouldn't eat the porridge was a minority. This camp consisted of residents from the same city, who could at least live without starving. It was only those with refined families or those who had stomach problems who rarely drank porridge.

Now, looking at the porridge that was barely visible, people could only cry in despair.

Even those with diabetes who couldn't drink porridge had to swallow it down.

After a whole day of going out to collect resources, there were indeed some "animals" caught, but ultimately, it was a minority, mainly due to the fact that these players were powerful fighters.

However, facing the entire population of the camp, even if these players were willing to distribute, most people would still not be able to get a drop of oil.

"Mom, I want to eat chicken legs, I don't want to drink this," a chubby boy with four rolls of fat on his cheeks protested, looking at the almost imperceptible porridge."
Here is the translation of the text:

Just a small, round-faced mother, but she couldn't say a complete sentence, only sighing and saying: "Hurry and eat, or it will be too late, and even this porridge will be gone. Your father has just gone to investigate the food brought by the pastors, which can't even last seven days."

"Unless this land can grow crops, we'll have to go hungry in seven days," the mother of the chubby boy said, lacking her usual enthusiasm to coax the child.

Suddenly, the people around him looked famished, with sunken eyes, and the grandmother of the chubby boy panted and said: "Just a moment ago, Ah Fei didn't say he knew that player, who was going to get some meat. Let's wait for him to come back and feed the child."

But the mother of the chubby boy laughed mockingly and said: "Is he, who was once his superior, now thinking about his old superior? Those four players went out, caught a sheep, and brought it back. Can they really remember their old superior? Has my son done them a great favor?"

As a woman who had married into the family, she naturally lowered her voice and tone when speaking to her husband and his family before the crossover.
However, after crossing over, she soon realized that this world was different.

Meanwhile, Chapter Yao Yu was sitting nearby, sharing a piece of lamb with his girlfriend, who was also a player.

After crossing over, the players in the campsite had secretly agreed to take turns going out to hunt, while those who stayed behind were responsible for protecting the family members of the players.

Some clever and quick-witted people from Earth had secretly moved their positions to the area near the family members of the players, feeling safer.

In fact, Chapter Yao Yu didn't need to worry, as he had a packet of instant noodles that could last him and his parents and girlfriend's parents for two to three days.

After the crossover, the players were all equipped with everything they had on their bodies when they lost their connection a month ago.
Here is the translation:

If someone had a "dimensional bag" that could store a vast amount of precious items and also had food, they could, just like Yang Wan, gather people and take over a place, which was not impossible.

"Don't hurry, eat slowly, there will be more tomorrow," Warrior Zhang Yao-yu gazed at his girlfriend with a sorrowful expression, knowing that his girlfriend had a piece of lamb in her bowl that she wanted to save for her parents, but didn't say a word.

He looked at the people in the camp, who were lowering their heads to drink their thin soup. The soup was originally free, but no one dared to come and drink it. The people who had gone hungry for a day were even licking the bowls, not caring about the small cracks on them.

Because no one could guarantee that the "thin soup" would be distributed again tomorrow.

The scarcity of resources on the last day weighed heavily on the hearts of the people.

"Why do they get to eat big fish and meat, while we can only drink soup?" Suddenly, a man who had finished his soup but still felt his stomach growling stood up and shouted loudly.

The man knew his own limitations, but as long as he could stir the hunger of others, he could create chaos in the distant player's influence of the meat aroma.

However, after the man finished speaking, he did not see the stormy weather or the other person's anger or scolding, nor the threat to cancel his rations for the next day.

Instead, a female pastor who had just given him the soup apologized to him with a slight bow: "I'm very sorry, our transportation capacity is limited, and we need to transport food to other places tomorrow, so each camp can only keep enough food for everyone to maintain a minimal living standard."
Here is the translation of the text:

As the girl continued to explain the goddess's teachings on this occasion, she gradually attracted the attention of the people who had just finished eating and had nothing to do. The man who had previously caused trouble and was even detained suddenly realized that he was facing someone who had a well-planned scheme to get him to bring up the topic.

It seemed like he was waiting for him to make a move, just like someone who had finished their meal and was waiting for someone to join in. Slowly, the people's gaze turned to him, and the man's heart was filled with resentment. He could only quietly slip away.

However, the goddess's teachings had already taken root in the hearts of some people.

"Hello," Saint Warrior Aet said, taking advantage of the crowd's attention being drawn to the priestess, as he quietly approached the warrior, Yang Yao, who was still eating his lamb chops.

"What happened here before we arrived?" Saint Warrior Aet immediately asked, inquiring about the events of the past two days.

The warrior player was deeply aware that the "Church Power" played a crucial role in Arthur's performance, and immediately revealed everything he knew.

He was absolutely certain that he didn't say anything, and other Earth players would also quietly discuss it with the opponent. Because the scene that occurred during the day had too many witnesses.

The priest group in front of them was an object that everyone wanted to curry favor with.

As Yang Yao described it, Saint Warrior Aet's eyes widened in surprise. Even the priest, Robin, who followed closely behind, thought he had misheard.

He and Aet exchanged a glance, both seeing the unbelievable look in the other's eyes.

"How is this?" Yang Yao exclaimed, noticing that both of them were extremely surprised, and emphasized, "I didn't lie at all. You can ask others if you don't believe me."

As he spoke, he bowed his head humbly, "I dare not lie to the goddess's representative on earth."
Here is the translation:

As the pastor Robin heard the flattering words, he didn't show too much excitement, explaining, "You're a warrior, so you wouldn't be surprised or confused." He then looked at the other person with a serious expression, saying, "The rebirth technique, no, the one who intentionally kills and then casts the spell should be the 'Final Breath', a unique four-ring divine art exclusive to Druids, but strangely, the other person can also cast a nine-ring arcane blessing spell."

"Part-time?" Chapter Yao-yu proposed a guess he himself doubted, as he didn't know it was a Druid art and thought the mysterious person was just a powerful mage. Who could have guessed it was actually a grandmaster of the divine arts?

"Impossible." Robin shook his head, saying, "According to legend, the goddess has a domain where one can specialize in researching the boundaries between divine and arcane arts, and those who can clarify the spellcasters are called Secret Art Masters."

"This profession, which allows each level to increase the level of both mage and pastor simultaneously, is a path of divine-arcane dual cultivation. However, before advancing to level 7, one needs to be at least a 3rd-level mage and 3rd-level pastor, resulting in few combat-oriented spellcasters choosing this path, except for some old, dedicated researchers who will do so."

"Moreover, the choice of dual cultivation between Druids and mages is quite rare." Pastor Robin summarized.

"Actually, I've seen a Druid elder who mastered arcane powers in the Silent Forest," Aite said. "The other person was on the path of the Arcane Priest, similar to the Secret Art Master, but with additional abilities."

However, the discussion that followed left Warrior Chapter Yao-yu feeling overwhelmed and confused.
Here is the translation of the text:

Until the two people's tongues were about to dry up, Atte finally spoke up, saying, "Can you take us to the spot where that tree was when?"

"Yes, follow me," the warrior player replied on the spot.

After a brief pause, the priest Robin knelt down, feeling the dark burn marks on the ground in front of him. The ancient, towering tree had been struck by lightning, its branches broken.

As a priest with magical powers, Robin was familiar with the background knowledge of magic. "It's a bit strange," he said, "how can 'Flash Bolt' leave such a dramatic burn mark on the ground?"

"That's because it's a 40-meter-high, 6-meter-wide lightning bolt, no, I should say it's a 'lightning curtain' so you can see the mark on the ground."

The person who interrupted, who was also extremely devout, finished his rice and quickly came over, still maintaining his praying posture.

"Surprisingly," Robin said with a bitter smile.

Just moments later, his expression turned extremely serious as he said to Atte, "We have to hurry back to report to the top, we may have just missed the true embodiment of a goddess on earth."

"I'm here, feeling the radiance of the divine power."

However, just as Robin finished speaking, he suddenly realized that the ground in front of him had become damp.

Immediately, the entire sky turned black in an instant.

"Oh no! Quickly notify everyone to prepare for the rain! This scale will be deadly."
