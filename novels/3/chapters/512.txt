Chapter 513: Words Come forth, Fear Spreads

Zhaoxu and others followed the manager of the mine, Les, and the manager of the mine district, Ted, to inspect the 36th mine and the 48th mine under the jurisdiction of the association. They also met with key miners and management personnel, which was a good opportunity to get to know each other.

After that, everyone returned to the city, going back to the residence of Zhaoxu and Zheng Xinyi, which was also the new headquarters of the Starfall Wizard Association.

As news spread, not only did players who wanted to see the first person of the Arthur player come to the door, but also the power holders in Starfall Town, who needed to confirm the documents in Zhaoxu's hand and clarify the process of establishing the association's new headquarters.

Zhaoxu also saw many familiar faces among the players in the management layer, who were all key figures who had participated in the initial battle against the alliance.

Now, they were enjoying the fruits of their labor after the initial investment.

After the players had broken into Starfall Town, they executed the mine owners who had participated in the slave trade one by one, and punished the power holders from the town mayor to the top, leaving a vacuum in the management layer. This gave the players an opportunity to seize the initiative.

The current power holders, as long as their accounts could survive the journey to Earth and make it through the critical moment, would be able to easily rise to a higher level or return to the Earth's forces to gain a more critical position.

After a month of adjustment, Starfall Town had returned to its original tranquility.

"Mr. Zhongxia, these are the permits for demolition and construction."
Here is the translation of the text into English:

Town Mayor Laurence is a wise old man who was transferred from Winter City. In two years, he will also return to retire. It was a big deal to send him to take charge of the town again, and he was needed to stabilize the situation.

"Thank you," Zhāo Xù nodded slightly to express his gratitude.

As for this town mayor who was once driven out by the mine owners for refusing to compromise, he still has great respect for him.

At this moment, he was flipping through the documents in his hand, only to realize that there were additional documents such as "Tax Exemption", "Urban Management Exemption", and "City Management Exemption" hidden behind. These documents were to be used to deal with various government departments in the town.

However, Zhāo Xù still has another identity that he doesn't need to reveal.

"Take a look," Zhāo Xù handed the documents to Wáng Gěngwēi, "You'll need them later."

"What?" Wáng Gěngwēi looked puzzled.

"You're not the one who likes to build a giant tower in the central part of a big city, are you?" Zhāo Xù joked.

"Ah?" Wáng Gěngwēi suddenly emitted a slightly blushing voice, "How do you know?"

She didn't expect that her deepest, most secret fantasy would be revealed by Zhāo Xù, which was also one of the reasons she had initially chosen to be a wizard.

The towering wizard tower, located at the center of all buildings, was one of her dreams, and she had even planned out names like "Virtual Machinery".

Zhāo Xù, however, just smiled without explaining.
Here is the translation of the text:

The capital city of the Earth Force, Yangnan, is built like an eight-trigram, with each ring expanding outward. At the center of it all stands the wizard tower of Wang Congwei.

At first, he thought it was Wang Congwei's symbol of his own strength in the Earth Force.

But now, he realizes that this is just the manifestation of a middle-school girl's soul bursting forth.

He's starting to doubt whether the layout of the Earth Force's capital city was actually drawn by Wang Congwei himself when he was fantasizing.

Just then, the mayor, Zhongxia, suddenly bowed to Zhao Xu and said, "I'm being impudent, but I have a favor to ask you."

"What is it?" Zhao Xu replied, followed by his companions, who had been observing the surrounding architecture, now looking back at Zhao Xu.

The bishop, on the other hand, continued to bow his head, as if praying to the goddess.

Anzhino, on the other hand, glanced at the well in the middle courtyard and seemed very interested.

As for the people following Mayor Laurence, they all gazed at Zhao Xu with expectant and apprehensive eyes, regardless of whether they were players or residents of the city of Arthur.

A clear boundary had formed between Zhao Xu and the others.

Zhao Xu had thought that the bishop's face was the reason why the mayor was being so cooperative and friendly, and he had prepared all the evidence in advance.

However, it's worth noting that, aside from being "mysterious", the wizard is also notorious for being "fearful". Players were okay, but ordinary city residents were extremely afraid of magical buildings, fearing that demons with bat wings might burst out, or a fireball might suddenly appear from the window and fall into the residential area.
Here is the translation:

So Zhao Xu chose to locate the "Association" in this area, with the exception of relocating the outer ring of residential buildings, and even the entire road will be sealed off in the future.

"Mr. Zhongxia, didn't you obtain the 'Lordship' from Tangde before?" Lawrence asked.

"That's right," Zhao Xu nodded.

"However, the power system of the Alliance is a semi-autonomous model, where I obtained this region, including the entire Star Lake and mining area, with the 'Lordship' power. It doesn't mean I can do whatever I want. You shouldn't worry too much."

The Lordship power in some completely feudal countries is equivalent to controlling heaven and earth, except for divine authority, which is basically all-encompassing.

Although there is no such thing as "initial night authority" in the legend, the Lordship power is basically in charge of everything from taxation to mobilization, with the Lord saying what goes.

The reason the Alliance is not an empire or kingdom is due to its semi-autonomous feature, which is a collaboration between elites and nobles. The power of the Lordship is therefore restricted to a certain extent.

For example, in the management of the city, the Lordship holder will have a seat in the decision-making layer.

Even in the Winter City, he also has the right to participate in some expanded meetings.

Tangde's "Lordship" document actually allows Zhao Xu to join the high-ranking ranks of the Winter City!
He will also receive a certain proportion of financial income from taxation, which is the most profitable part of this "Lordship".

In the Starfall Town where silver mines are produced, it's even more valuable.

Moreover, his own merchant association has naturally obtained the "tax exemption" power, which can sometimes be used to easily crush other merchant associations.
Here is the translation of the text:

The "lordship" of the alliance is essentially derived from the concept of "land" and has a duration that can be divided into "temporary" and "permanent" types.

The temporary type has a duration of 10 years, after which the lordship of the land will be reclaimed by the alliance officials, pending rewards for their achievements.

On the other hand, the permanent type has no time limit, and those who possess a permanent-type territory are considered nobles within the alliance.

For example, the leader Tang De was promoted to a higher position, so the alliance allocated a temporary lordship territory to him. The part of the Star Town that Zhao Xu obtained was divided from this territory.

At this point, Town Mayor Lawrence bowed his head even lower, as if he was about to perform a bow, saying, "After our discussion, we still hope that you, Mr. Zhong Xia, will focus on the association and refrain from intervening in the town's management for the time being."

However, he reassured Zhao Xu, "But don't worry, we will definitely prepare your personal tax returns and will not delay it."

As soon as he finished speaking, Zhao Xu's companion, Wang Qingwei, couldn't help but laugh out loud.

White Dragon was about to explode in anger, but Zhao Xu gave him a stern look, and his open mouth quickly closed.

"It's not mine, and you can't take it from me," Zhao Xu said loudly.

Looking at the people in front of him, Zhao Xu noticed that they had already stiffened.

However, if something belongs to me, then no one can take it away."

He spoke loudly.

As for the second half of the sentence "except for Anniya", it's unnecessary to say.

"Mr. Zhong Xia,"

At this moment, a high-level player who had previously opposed the alliance, "Huo Ke", suddenly walked up to Zhao Xu and said, "Don't worry, we can exchange it for certain items."
Here is the translation of the text:

As he spoke, his gaze revealed confidence, "Including the wealth of the real world, it's also possible." This was the first chance for the player "Zhōng Xià" to interact.

Players from the upper echelons of the Starfall Town, who had been eagerly waiting for this opportunity, packed the entire courtyard, making it crowded.

Most of them gazed at Zhōng Xià with astonished eyes, as he suddenly became extremely serious.

"There's a saying on Earth that you can't take something back with your fist, but you can't get it back with just words either."

Zhāo Xù said, and suddenly popped a gold coin in his hand up into the air.

Technique: Concealment Spell!

Silent Spell: Magic Spell!

With the instantaneous action of popping the coin, Zhāo Xù used his "technique" learned through hard work and research to conceal the traces of his spellcasting.

"Ping."

In an instant, the gold coin, which had been flying through the air, followed its original parabolic trajectory and fell straight back into Zhāo Xù's hand.

"Ah!"

Zhāo Xù shouted in a loud voice, but without any incantation or magical tone.

The players who were close by almost burst out laughing, wondering if the other person thought they were casting magic and shouted out the incantation name. But the next second, his face turned pale and he directly covered his chest with his hand.

This spell with a range of 10 meters, a four-ring magic spell cast by the poet, suddenly exploded and enveloped everyone present.

【Adventurer XX, your willpower has failed to resist the fear, and you are now in a state of terror!】
Instantly, the dynamic bars of countless people popped up with this cold prompt.
Here is the translation of the text:

At first, the high-level players in the small town were filled with anticipation and expectation for Summer's retreat. However, in an instant, they felt a sense of fear emanating from deep within their hearts.

"Clang!"
"Clang!"
The sound of falling objects filled the air.

Those who had been affected by the "Fear Technique" held their belongings unsteadily, their entire bodies trembling with fear.

In this state, even if they tried to wield their long swords, their inner fear would prevent them from performing well.

Zhao Xu didn't say much, just like he had said, flapping his mouth was meaningless.

So he showed the power of his "speaking" to the town chief, Lawrence, and others.

Especially the town chief, Lawrence, who had been deceived by the dragon's effect before, saw this kind of effect and felt his heart racing with fear again. His legs began to tremble, and he dared not move.

The summer wizard before him was using a non-lethal attack on their minds, not causing actual harm.

Even if the opponent added more effects, relying on the accumulation of fear itself, they would rise from the first level of "trembling" to the second level of "surprise" and even the third level of "panic".

Once they reached the third level, it was easy for them to become emotionally unstable, exhibiting abnormal behavior, and unable to face things.

Some players, protected by the gods' blessings, although they didn't show the same level of trembling as Arthur, were still affected.

It was as if someone had pressed their head, and even flashed terrifying scenes in their minds.

"Damn it, how did the opponent cast that spell? I didn't even see it."
"Fear effect, the most direct estimate is the four-ring arcane fear technique." Another player explained.
Here is the translation:

"However, no one has been exempted, is this too exaggerated?" 

"Shut up, you're killing me. So many people have come, and none of them has taken action, yet they're already withdrawing."

At this moment, Zhao Xu looked at the town leader, Lawrence, with a friendly and sincere expression, and said straightforwardly.

"I think I've proven myself. I have the qualification to change your minds, don't I?"
