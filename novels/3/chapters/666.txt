Chapter 667: The Secret Behind the Tome of the Ancients

As Zhao Xu listened to An Ti Nuo Ya's explanation of the demons in the depths of the abyss, he was shocked to learn that there were demons with impressive stats, not to mention those with levels as low as 16, who could easily reach 50-60 points and even transfer over 10 points of attributes. There are reportedly over 300 known types of demons in the abyss, which is already a vast and complex field of study for even the most learned demonologists.

However, in reality, the true number of demon species is impossible to count, and even using the word "ten thousand" to describe it would be an understatement.

Zhao Xu couldn't help but be amazed by this revelation, and he felt a sense of trepidation as he thought about the potential consequences of An Ti Nuo Ya's actions in the past, when she was searching for a suitable target for the "Extraction Rite". He wondered if she had taken great risks in the abyss, and if she had even worn the "Crimson Justice" artifact to protect herself from the dangers that lurked within.

The "Extraction Rite" was not only capable of transferring attributes, but also of transferring skill values, which would have a profound impact on the outcome. Skills played a crucial role in Arthur's world, where they were the only reliable source of strength for the players who had arrived on Earth. In fact, skills were so dominant that they played a pivotal role in every aspect of life, even in combat.
Here is the translation of the text:

The typical adventurer team, according to King Arthur's consensus, typically consists of a "warrior-mage-thief" configuration.

The warrior takes on the role of physical input and tanking, while the mage controls the battlefield and deals magical damage. The priest serves as both a healer and a warrior, and the thief is responsible for their skills.

At first glance, the thief may seem to be unremarkable, only able to survive by relying on stealth attacks. However, they also excel at avoiding traps, conducting reconnaissance, creating forgeries to deceive enemies, and other techniques that allow them to "sneak around".

The reason for this is that an adventure is not just about fighting, but also involves a significant amount of social interaction, gathering information, and true life-or-death battles that may only last a few minutes.

As a result, the thief is able to break through the limitations of the 11 basic professions and join the ranks of the "Iron Four".

This point was shattered by the "spell" of the mage.

The thief is able to master skills because each level of the profession can earn 8 skill points from the profession, far surpassing the 2 points earned by the mage.

Even a strong thief will only be able to kneel down and cry "Dad!" when encountering a scholar.

The poet is able to master skills as a secondary role because the poet's spells can be stacked.

The scholar, who is also a poet, mage, priest, and ranger, has mastered a comprehensive set of spells.

The poem "Improvisation" increases the skill level by 1/2, adding luck.

The skill-enhancing spell "Intensification" increases the skill level by 2+1/2, adding environmental effects.

The song "Knowledge" increases the skill level by 4+1/2, adding a performance bonus.
Here is the translation of the text:

Just this one-ring spell that matches the level of the caster can easily surpass the skill limit of a "Tome Scholar" who has brushed up on their caster level. And "Emptiness Ritual" is even more so, as it can permanently transfer half of the caster's skill bonus to the corresponding demon, as long as the demon has twice the skill bonus. For example, a Balroth demon with over 20 levels can transfer a 10-level bonus.

The six attributes are just a minor concern, while the skills are numerous, with dozens of categories. Xiaoxu once struggled for a long time in the apprentice stage because of the low level of "Knowledge" and "Spell Identification". By the time he finally completed this round of skill grinding, he could say he was omnipotent.

After all, those spells are all targeted at a single skill, and the bonus for covering multiple skills won't be too high, so Xiaoxu didn't go crazy with continuous skill grinding, with most of them needing to be used in actual combat.

As the two of them discussed various demon targets, the Niyaruto Ti Pu, who was closest to being a demon and also a "Chaos" incarnation, finally couldn't take their conversation and exploded in a dream, expelling the two of them.

Xiaoxu also felt a sense of disorientation and felt the heavy air around him and the misty rain above the sky, only to realize he had returned to the tower of Ainan.

As for Anniya, she woke up at the same time, smiling at him.

"Teacher, how long have I been asleep?"

"If I told you, it's less than a minute, do you believe me?"

"This is natural."

Xiaoxu's heart was filled with trepidation as he looked at the "Gate of the Abyss" on the painting, with a deep sense of caution.
Here is the translation:

In this instant, the angelic appearance on the canvas suddenly transformed into a brand new girl-like painting style, but the gaze in her eyes remained as profound as the endless void in the midst of chaos.

"Um?"

Anastasia noticed the change in the painting and explained, "This form is the embodiment of the god who once visited Earth."

"It seems that this time, besides paying attention to everything, he also participated in some subtle moves. It's uncertain whether this 'Darkness Scroll' will also be included in his plans."

Zhao Xu suddenly felt a headache.

At this moment, the Earth-crossing forces, besides the piercing gazes of the abyss and demons, also included the vigilant gaze of the surrounding Arthur forces, and the gods of faith were seeping into the countless grains of sand, and now there was even the "Outer God" from the terrifying world intervening?

However, he also noticed Anastasia's mention of the embodiment and asked, "Teacher, is what we just encountered real or an embodiment?"

Anastasia shook her head. "I don't know. As an Outer God known for deception, my understanding of him is limited to knowing that he often takes on a human form and walks among mortals. He usually appears as a tall, thin, happy, and dark-skinned man."

"As for the embodiment, there are the grotesque giant-like Night Roarer, the winged lion-like god, and the two-headed bat-like Lernicus..."

As Anastasia recited the numerous Nyarlathotep embodiments, Zhao Xu felt a sense of shock.

The gods of Arthur cannot have an embodiment beyond their divine level, so the highest is 20.
Here is the translation of the text:

Even though Anniya was speaking all the way, she never mentioned the girl with silver hair, super long eyelashes, and blue-green eyes who had taken on a humanoid form on the painting.

Zhou Xu couldn't help but be curious, "Teacher, what's her name again?"

"This one... seems to be called Nayasha."

"..."

Zhou Xu felt that he had some familiarity with it.

"Ah, it's Xiaoyue."

Suddenly, Anniya turned around to face the vast and open city, with smoke rising from the distance, and the occasional roar of the lion-like transportation team, which made the children below look up in wonder.

"What's going on?"

"It seems that from the moment I appeared, you've never doubted my authenticity. You should know that the external god in the dream world is completely based on your impression and has been molded into the 'false' me."

"'Even the false existence is more in line with your imagination and impression than the true me.'"

Anniya's slender figure leaned against the railing, her gaze shining brightly, and her voice was soft and gentle.

"This is a secret."

Zhou Xu said, raising his index finger.

"Ah."

Anniya didn't bother to ask any questions, gazing at Zhou Xu's eyes with a hint of admiration.

"It's good."

"I was originally planning to take you to the depths of the abyss and settle the matter quickly, but I've changed my mind now."

Anniya then waved her hand, and the "Black Scroll" painting was rolled up and put away.

This magical item, which was related to the external god's observation of the terrifying world, was no longer suitable for Zhou Xu to collect. It was natural for her to take charge of it.

As their relationship stood, Anniya didn't need to explain anything to Zhou Xu, as he was someone who knew what was what.
Here is the translation of the text:

He is not the kind of person who would make a decision without careful consideration. In fact, he just finished drawing the outline and didn't dare to say anything, otherwise, it would only dig himself a hole. The other party doesn't know his details and won't rashly send someone to replace him.

Zhao Xun even sensed that An Ti Nuoya deliberately left herself in the dream of the other party, having a deep and profound conversation with him about the "Rite of Extraction", just like setting up a trap.

Is it possible that she is certain that the other party will send an avatar to come? She needs to prepare for this situation, so she's putting off the journey to the depths.

Just as Zhao Xun was sighing over the twists and turns of his journey to the depths, An Ti Nuoya suddenly spoke up.

"Zhong Xia. In fact, this is the reminder I wanted to give you. The powerful beings of that terrifying world are far beyond your imagination, to the extent that you can even understand the creation of the three giant dragons of King Arthur as existing on the same level as these beings."

"Generally speaking, because ordinary people and these mysterious beings are not on the same scale, any pursuit of these unknown mysteries is extremely likely to lead to a disastrous outcome."

As soon as Zhao Xun heard this, he couldn't help but sweat coldly at the back of his neck, "Teacher, I know that curiosity can be deadly, and I swear that I will never again get myself into such a situation."

But An Ti Nuoya just smiled lightly. "Sorry, Zhong Xia."

"These super powerful, nameless existences are of little interest to most humans, but---"
Here is the translation of the text:

"That being from the outside world of Naryarya, due to the characteristics of chaos, tends to intervene and even monitor ordinary people. From the moment you choose to enter a dream and meet with you, you have already escaped this fate.

Zhou Xu heard this and could only accept reality.

He muttered, "Teacher, isn't it said that this is a mysterious world with few interactions with Arthur? How do you know so much?"

"That's natural," replied Anniyao, her lips twitching slightly as she covered her forehead with her cloak.

"Summer solstice," she said, her voice barely above a whisper.

"You forgot what profession we are," someone shouted.

Suddenly, a massive blue lightning bolt flashed across the darkening sky, accompanied by a thunderclap that shook the ears.

It seemed to foretell the impending storm that would exceed human imagination.

Residents of the town below looked up in awe, many dropping their work to seek shelter from the impending rain. However, only a few could enter the stone and cement building, while those who could enter the canvas tent were considered lucky.

Zhou Xu's mind was completely elsewhere as he stared at Anniyao's delicate face, illuminated by the flickering lightning.

"We're not wizards, are we? Wizards also have a curiosity to explore the unknown world..."

Zhou Xu's words trailed off, unable to continue.

They were also a "Chronicle scholar".

Seeking to decipher the cursed stone stele, searching for secrets and divine power from strange and forbidden sources...

From any angle, Chronicle scholars seemed to be searching for the secrets of those outside gods, seeking their whereabouts.

Even Chronicle scholars were born from that terrifying world where gods existed."
Here is the translation of the text to English:

In Zhao Xu's mind, it was as if a torrential rain had just poured down, continuously shaking his mind to the point where he couldn't hold back a single word.

To become a scholar of ancient scrolls, one must have seen the "Ancient Stele"!

Is it possible that this profession itself comes from a divine being from another world?

"It seems you've guessed it," An Ti Noya smiled slightly. "I also realized this point many years after my teacher left Arthur, and I understood that the divine being was the 'endpoint' of our scroll scholars."

"Who is it?" Zhao Xu asked in surprise.

He even had a feeling that the existence he would mention next would be deeply connected to him!

Even before he left the divine being's dream, he had a subconscious sense that one day he would return to that terrifying world again to uncover the unknown secrets.

"This name, I told you at the beginning. Please forgive me, but I can't mention it again now. Because it's not suitable, or rather, when you hear it now, you may fall into a state of madness."

"Its true name, in Arthur's pronunciation, exceeds our understanding of the limits."

"Is that the one?" Zhao Xu guessed at this moment.

An Ti Noya mentioned another two divine beings, which left a deep impression on Zhao Xu, so he immediately guessed it.

"Yes."

"That's why you need to go find Zheng Xin Rong in July," An Ti Noya said.

"Yes?"

Zhao Xu was a bit surprised.

"Because you can find the one named Lakshmi through Zheng Xin Rong, who is also a divine being who has lost his memory."
