Chapter 599: Passing the Test of Monk's Ability

Hearing the barbarian player's words, Zhao Xu was slightly taken aback.

To be honest, the most difficult thing in the world is not to rely on others. Zhao Xu himself had mastered the divine art of healing, which included the "Light Healing" spell, the "Middle-Grade Healing" spell, the "Severe Healing" spell, and the "Life-Saving Healing" spell. He could effortlessly cast these spells to heal himself.

He could also use magical items and activate them to give himself the "Double Healing" spell, which would restore 104 HP (standard 4D8 + spell level, capped at level 20). This was equivalent to reviving a dead person, making him feel invincible.

In battle, clerics were reliable, but trying to rely on a cleric to save oneself in a situation where spellcasting was limited and divine art was scarce was unrealistic. Therefore, most players had learned to "rely on themselves" after experiencing the harsh environment of the early stages without recovering spells.

Zhao Xu, who had experienced the hardship of not having access to healing positions in his past life, had chosen to double-major in cleric because of this reason. As a result, he accidentally stumbled upon the strongest double-major combination in the game, the "Divine Art Double-Major".

Even the barbarian player in front of him, who was equivalent to a "natural-born fool", had mistakenly used the "Use Magic Device" skill, which was not part of his job. If he hadn't done so, the "Wand" would not have been able to be activated successfully at once.

In the magical item system of Arthur's magic, besides the "curious items", "rings", "weapons", "armor", and "staves" that can be freely used, other items such as "wands", "staffs", and "scrolls" that correspond to spells are only usable if the corresponding spell exists in the spell list. Therefore, a "subsequent healing wand" like this is usually used by priests to continuously heal allies after battles. Non-priests, such as druids, need to use the "Use Magic Device" skill, which requires training and investing skill points. As a result, a "healing wand" costs 750 gold coins, equivalent to 15 gold coins per healing. This is also the reason why a "healing potion" that can be used without any prerequisites is very popular. It is because it can be used without requiring anyone's help, even if one doesn't have the skills like the barbarian in front of us. "Isn't it a bit inconvenient?" The barbarian player felt a sense of empathy towards the robustly built Zhao Xu, who didn't speak up as if he was having a hard time. "No, I just thought about it," Zhao Xu said with a smile. Fortunately, Zhao Xu had already cleared the treasure chest of the six sisters before joining the wizarding association, and his resources were incredibly abundant. Although he didn't need many things, he still kept some for his family, friends, and acquaintances. Then, Zhao Xu pulled out a wide leather belt with three moonstones embedded on it from his waist pouch. "What's going on?" "Is it magic?" "How can you fit a belt into your waist pouch?" "Is it possible?" The crowd around him was shocked by Zhao Xu's actions. He pulled out the "belt" before the crowd could be shocked, and it was actually his own waist pouch that was more shocking.

Even the barbarian players on the screen couldn't help but be surprised when they saw Zhao Xu's backpack, seeming to speculate about the internal space.

"Auntie, what is that?" a little girl asked her older brother at this moment.

The little girl's older brother was also a 2nd-level poet player who had grown up in a harsh environment and had raised a family of four. However, the Chinese people's thinking is always to plan ahead, so the girl's parents had applied for jobs through official channels and were allocated to work on road construction.

Thanks to their son being a player, they were allocated to the lightest work.

In fact, even the mother who couldn't carry a burden could only come to count as "population" to get an extra allowance.

After the war, even the poet player who had not been assigned to the front line came to help the family with some work. He knew he was the family's hope, so he wouldn't dare take on some exploration tasks with high rewards.

When he heard his sister's question, the poet himself, who had seen and experienced many things, immediately recognized it and whispered, "It's probably that 'dimensional bag', right?"

When he said this, the onlookers who had been guessing nodded and exclaimed, "What's that?"

As usual, since they knew the family had a poet player, they were always polite and courteous, taking on some heavy tasks together.

As expected, only these players who had touched the game could see the inner door.
Here is the translation of the text:

The young poet shook his head, saying, "I've only seen things like this a few times. The outer layer looks like a burlap sack, but inside is a dimensional space, similar to the mythical realm of Shumy in our stories. It's divided into levels, but the highest level is estimated to be worth over 10,000 gold coins and can hold objects of up to 7-8 cubic meters in size, with a weight capacity of over a ton."

As soon as he said this, the people around him were shocked, staring at Zhao Xiu, their eyes wide with amazement, unable to believe that a casual player like him had such a powerful item.

"I'm telling you, this means that anyone can carry a small cargo truck with them, as long as they have enough supplies," said a logistics driver who had crossed over from the previous life. "If we had this on Earth, we could transport goods so much faster."

"This isn't a big deal," joked a construction supervisor who had also crossed over. "You're just thinking about using the Golden Sickle, but these strong players don't care about such things."

The poet realized that everyone was treating the "dimensional bag" on the table as the highest level, but he didn't explain.

Even the lowest-level dimensional bag was not something he could afford.

The commoners who had missed out on this game, including the poets, were envious of his player identity, while he was equally envious of the high-level players.

At this moment, the students who were struggling to master the skills below them were all staring at the belt around Zhao Xiu's waist. "Is this...?"

The barbarian player, Iron Man, had his gaze locked onto the belt, muttering to himself and thinking about the belt's name. The players who had seen some things, including Arthur, couldn't help but be fascinated by this belt.
The great majority of players' lives are characterized by being unable to afford and unable to see [something]. "This is a belt of healing," Zhao Xu said. Instantly, the players below looked up in surprise. Meanwhile, the barbarian iron man's eyes shone with a fierce light, fixed intently on the "belt of healing" in Zhao Xu's hand. When it comes to treating problems, it's only natural that players would pay close attention to magical items that can treat diseases. The belt of healing is also the same magical item that was once worn by Wang Qingwei. Zhao Xu didn't take it from the other person; he bought it through a channel. "I heard about this belt on the forum before, and I never thought I'd actually see it today," he said. The barbarian iron man shook his head, "For us melee players who need to use our bodies to fight monsters, this belt is indeed a small treasure." He sighed meaningfully, "Even a high-level warrior would still use this belt." "It's just a belt, after all," Zhao Xu said.

The belt of healing can automatically replenish three times a day, consuming one use to treat moderate injuries (2D8). In emergency situations during battle, it can be used to treat severe injuries (3D8) or critical injuries (4D8) by consuming two or three uses. More importantly, it only costs 750 gold coins, the same as the "lesser revitalize" and "treat minor injuries" wands, and doesn't require the "magic device use" skill. After introducing the belt's details to the barbarian player, the eyes of the players below shone with admiration.
Here is the translation of the text:

Although everyone knows that the belt costs 750 gold coins and is unaffordable, not to mention that they don't even have 750 gold coins altogether, these people still fantasize about this belt.

To put it exaggeratedly, even a 1st-level priest may not be stronger than the belt's restorative power.

"Thanks for opening my eyes to these students," said Wild Iron, respectfully returning the belt to Zhao Xu.

However, he looked at Zhao Xu without putting on the belt and wondered, "Could it be that you're wearing an even stronger belt?"

"Or is it the +6 strength belt? Or the Red Gemstone Belt?"

"Not any of those, it's just the Monk Belt," Zhao Xu said with a wave of his hand.

As the wielder of the Four Ring Godly Art, which provides a +6 strength bonus, the belt's significance is limited. It can only absorb the effects of shape-shifting, petrification, separation, and conversion spells, and its utility is also limited.

However, it can add the senses' sharpness to defense, which is a characteristic of Fighters and Nine Swords Swordsmen (Wise Old Men).

"I see, you're a bare-handed warrior, or are you a Monk Master?" Wild Iron asked, nodding slightly.

From his perspective, Zhao Xu was not wearing the Monk Belt for the sake of defensive awareness, but rather to enhance his bare-handed damage as a Monk.

Zhao Xu also scratched his head in embarrassment.

As a 20th-level Monk with 19 profession skills, Zhao Xu relied on the belt to obtain defensive awareness and bare-handed attack bonuses.
Here is the translation of the text:

The remaining 13 abilities include reflection evasion, quick movement, mental clarity, combat skills, disease resistance, healing, light body, flight, immune to toxins, teleportation, mental shield, language skills, and a superhuman physique. His magical abilities or professional skills can be further enhanced. He can also temporarily mimic the "Penetrating Qi" ability with some effort. However, he cannot reverse the "Immortal Body" ability, which will not age but will eventually die.

As he pulls out items from his backpack, he reveals a collection of healing wands and potions, including a "Light Injury Healing Wand" for 750 gold coins, a "Medium Injury Healing Wand" for 4,500 gold coins, a "Severe Injury Healing Wand" for 11,250 gold coins, and a "Fatal Injury Healing Wand" for 21,000 gold coins.

He also pulls out a "Secondary Regeneration Wand" for 750 gold coins, a "Three-Ring Regeneration Wand" for 11,250 gold coins, and a "Secondary Group Regeneration Wand" for 11,250 gold coins.

The "Medical Law Wand" can be used to use secondary regeneration, heal severe injuries, remove diseases, and remove visual and auditory impairments for 27,750 gold coins. The "Medical Authority" is similar, and can be used once a day for 20,000 gold coins.

The "Regeneration Ring" can automatically restore 90,000 gold coins of life per hour.

The "Six-Ring Medical Wand" and "Seven-Ring Revival Wand" can be used for 155,750 gold coins.

As Zhao Xu rummages through his backpack, he starts to feel a bit awkward. He decides to put the items back in the treasury of the Wangu Kingdom and register them with Wang Qingwei.

As he puts away the items, everyone's mouths are agape in amazement at the sheer quantity of healing magic items he has.
Is this the thief who just robbed the treasury of the Yanna country?
