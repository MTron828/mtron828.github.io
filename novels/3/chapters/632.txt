Chapter 633: The Earth's Past, Who Am I?
"Are you me?"
Zhao Xu couldn't help but smile slightly, "Even if it's a true body, would you dare to claim it as yourself?"
"I don't remember splitting my consciousness or something like that."
Arthur's extraordinary abilities did not lack the means to split his consciousness, and his psychic powers were among the best. Even occult and divine arts had similar methods in the physical world.
It's not uncommon for Arthur to encounter an identical duplicate of himself in his world, such as the "clone technique" in the Eight Rings of Magic, which can create a lifeless duplicate of a living being. If the duplicate is injured, the soul will immediately transfer to the duplicate, a type of "transmigration" technique.
Similarly, the "Illusion Technique" in the Seven Rings of Magic requires a large amount of life energy and precious red gemstones, allowing the creation of a duplicate illusion of any living being, formed from ice and snow, half-real, but with half the level of the original being.

Therefore, even if Zhao Xu is holding the "Treasure of True Knowledge" and really encounters an existence identical to himself, he will not feel the slightest surprise.

"You guys' history and development are very interesting, and the phrase 'empty hole brings wind, but there may be no reason' is truly touching my heart."
Suddenly, the witch who was crouching on the ground, tied to the ground like a dog, opened and closed her skull-like head, emitting similar sounds.
Here is the translation of the text:

It's a pity that Zhao Xu has seen such methods before, and his surprise and alarm have been suppressed. However, he couldn't help but sigh slightly.

Before players crossed over, they had "Divine Protection" and were unaware of the risk of having their consciousness invaded. After crossing over, all humans on Earth were in a state of chaos, with no one able to cross the border.

This suggests that the opponent had already accessed the player's memories and even understood and used them. Naturally, the entire human civilization on Earth was not a secret to these strong beings. This is also the reason why Earth was suppressed in the past.

For these strong beings who can manipulate memories and dominate consciousness, the concept of secrets is meaningless. If gunpowder really works and nitroglycerin can be manufactured and formed into explosives, then the opposing Arthur's forces can quickly replicate it.

The weakness of Earth lies in the inability to defend secrets. "If I am you, and you are not, should you not obediently hand over your body and let me control it?"

The voice in the void, with a certain kind of mesmerizing power, made Zhao Xu feel that the other person was speaking with great reason, and not listening was too absurd.

Both magical and non-magical influences, as well as pure skill, were at work. Zhao Xu immediately drew this conclusion.

"Give it to me."

"I know you have many things to do, but don't you feel tired?"

"Integrating and rising of the Earth's forces, involving so many people, do you think you can handle it well with your personality?"
Here is the translation of the text:

"Just thinking about the 1,000 people below, you would have to deal with their trivial matters every day, don't you think it's frustrating?"

The voice in the void gradually increased in volume and magnetism, with a piercing power that seemed to penetrate one's heartstrings.

"But if you hand it over to me, it would be different. As the former ruler, I can handle these matters for you. Once the entire empire is well-organized, I'll transfer the throne to you, and you can enjoy the fruits of your labor. Isn't that good?"

Instantly, a strange red glow began to emanate from Zhao Xu's surroundings, with pulsing veins that seemed to beat like a living heart or the malevolent eyes of a monster, staring straight at him.

"Look at them, they've all entrusted their bodies to me, and they're all in their own dream worlds, enjoying the ideal paradise without facing the harsh reality."

"No need to wake up every day to worry about feeding the family, no need to open your eyes to think about how to escape this abyss. Just sleep and let the dream unfold."

However, the players below were all sporting sweet, innocent-looking expressions, as if they were reliving their first love in the school courtyard.

They seemed to have been under the spell of the top-tier mind control spell, with every one of them completely under the control of their consciousness and physical form.

But Zhao Xu noticed that the smiles on these players' faces were just too radiant, almost as if they had forgotten their past experiences.

That sweet memory even made people hesitate, as if they were unsure if they had ever had a happier memory.

The sweet memory was so vivid that it made people wonder if they had forgotten their past, and they might just drift off to sleep without realizing it.

Gradually, the infection spread, and the self-talk began to echo in Zhao Xu's mind, as if it were being broadcast from his inner self.
Here is the translation of the text:

Just as Zhao Xu's expression became rigid, his eyelids began to droop, and he seemed to be falling asleep. Even for a minute more, and Zhao Xu would be flying in the air, emitting a faint snore.

"Mr. Zhong Xia, before you pass away, can you please hand me over to Miss An Ti Nuo Ya first?" he said.

Suddenly, Zhao Xu's magical item, the "Dream" cloak behind him, emitted a cold and detached voice.

Instantly, Zhao Xu's drowsiness subsided, and he regained his spirits. He couldn't help but think to himself: What kind of trick is this? I've already reached nearly 40 levels of mental fortitude.

It's impossible for something of this difficulty level to affect me. Even if I'm under the influence of an exemption check, I can still cast magic to counter it.

"Mr. Zhong Xia, this is beyond my understanding range," the magical item, Dream, continued to say coldly. "I'm just a simple cloak that doesn't want to become a shroud. If you need me to cast a spell, please let me know. Otherwise, I'll remain silent."

Zhao Xu also felt a sense of fatigue, as if he had just woken up from a long sleep.

He also realized that this kind of sleep-inducing technique could allow someone to sneak into his consciousness and take control of his mind, but the consequences would be obvious - he would be easily "awakened".

Even if he had a "companion" who hadn't been affected by the magic, he could still wake up.

After a moment of thought, Zhao Xu had grasped the general outline of his opponent's plan.

At the same time, he revealed a determined look in his eyes, gazing at the empty space ahead.
Here is the translation of the text:

As the flames burning below illuminated the cave's interior structure, supported by spells such as Daybreak, Dance of Light, and Radiance, it was clear to see the construction of the cave's interior.

"What's the difference between what you just said and simply getting drunk to numb yourself?" he asked.

"Every day, you wake up and think about escaping reality, refusing to face the hardships of the past, and instead choose to dull your thoughts with alcohol and sleep, so you won't realize the pain of reality."

"This kind of life built on lies is not what I want!"

Zhao Xu suddenly let out a loud shout, like a tenor's powerful voice after a vocal exercise, resonating in his chest. The cave's plaza suddenly felt like it was experiencing a "shocking" sensation.

"The War Spellâ€”Dawn Break!"

A spell Zhao Xu used to awaken his companions controlled by the Old Witch, now in its war version, instantly expanded the spell's range from its original 4 meters to 100 meters, easily covering the players in a radial formation.

This spell, originally used to wake up companions who had fallen asleep, was usually used to wake up everyone at night when they were ambushed, or to dispel the "Sleep Spell".

Of course, Zhao Xu could have woken them up one by one, but this was the most efficient way.

The players below suddenly felt a pressing sense of urgency, as if they had been woken up by a sudden urge to pee, and wanted to continue snuggling in the warm bed, but were forced to get up by the cold outside air.

However, the pressure in their lower body forced them to wake up and quickly solve the problem.

Just as Zhao Xu was looking at the crowd, who were stuck between confusion and clarity, his face suddenly changed color.

"Quick Release!"
Here is the translation of the text:

As soon as Zhao Xu cast a spell on himself. He borrowed time from the fabric of time and reached into the future to gather fragments of his destiny. In the blink of an eye, Zhao Xu had gained an additional dimension of time. At the same time, his celestial cloak "Dream" was also activated, preparing to cast a "Micro-Injury Healing" spell on him. The "Zero-Ring Spell" was also a skill that Zhao Xu, as a 10-level mage, had awakened and mastered. With this "Micro-Injury Healing" spell, he could awaken Zhao Xu's delayed "Medical Knowledge" spell.

By activating the "Incantation System (Medical)" spell, he could automatically remove the "Dizziness" effect and avoid the subsequent punishment for his rapid progress. Zhao Xu had prepared an emergency plan after descending into the dungeon, but unexpectedly, he only activated it now.

In the precious few seconds of time, Zhao Xu had gained a priceless "thinking time" for himself. Because he had realized that after casting the "Breakfast" spell, he had been overwhelmed by endless fatigue, and his consciousness had been flooded with exhaustion. He was like a statue that had been hit by countless water balloons, with not even a single scratch, but utterly soaked.

The "Demon King Device" - Dreamland Heaven! Zhao Xu had finally reacted, realizing that he was under the influence of this Demon King Device. However, he didn't expect that this Demon King Device was secretly controlled by a powerful being that could manipulate the undead.

So, what was going on? Zhao Xu couldn't help but shout in his heart. As a 10-level mage, he was faced with an opponent who didn't dare to face him directly, but instead, was circling around him, using the power of the Demon King Device to torment him.
Here is the translation of the text:

Even if he was afraid he wouldn't fit in, he deliberately concealed the first "sleep" ability, making him aware that "awakening" could break someone else's sleep state.

Unbeknownst to him, this was the effect of the "Dream Realm Heaven".

"Sleep Equilibrium"!

Whoever stopped someone else's dream, would have to bear the corresponding dream punishment.

At this point, Zhao Xuan, although his resistance was extremely high, could not resist the influence of the thousand-person dream and was dragged into the dream, his consciousness restrained.

This was also the reason Zhao Xuan was in such a hurry to activate his "Quick Release" ability.

He needed to keep his own consciousness clear in this moment and prepare for what was to come.

"Flexibility Ball!"

However, time would not stand still. He took away the youth's carefree years, leaving only wrinkles on his face, and took away the girl's youthful beauty, leaving only a mirror with a white face.

Leaving Zhao Xuan with no time, he could only do this.

Calm down, set up a big defense, and then talk about it.

...

Zhao Xuan opened his eyes, familiar yet unfamiliar. It was not the highest level of Yan Ning, with the commander's mark engraved, and the luxurious suite.

It was Earth, his home.

Zhao Xuan suddenly lifted the blanket and sat up, looking around.

The desk, which had been used for over ten years, had not been sat at every day since entering university. The scratches on the desk were clear. And the soft, 1.5-meter bed below, with the warm feeling of just having been sun-dried.

Zhao Xuan silently grasped his pants pocket and felt the familiar shape. He directly pulled it out from inside.

His finger slid across the screen, and the familiar background emerged. Suddenly, a deep-seated sense of time flashed through Zhao Xuan's eyes - August!
Here is the translation of the text into English:

According to the past when God was not present in July, at the moment when August came, the entire human beings on Earth had already crossed over to Arthur. Is this not a timeline without crossing?

Zhao Xu was puzzled and perplexed, and he subtly felt that he had forgotten something.

He quietly got out of bed, pushed open the door, and saw that the breakfast left over from the previous day was still warm on the rock table. The buns, oil sticks, yogurt, and a note underneath told him that his parents had already left, and he should eat breakfast by himself and not forget the appointment with the psychologist in the afternoon.

Zhao Xu quietly picked up a bun, tore off the bottom paper, and took a bite. The fatty meat juice squirted out of his mouth, and he felt a sense of familiarity and clarity.

He began to suspect that something was real.

He had a magical item called "Hidden Eye" that could shield and detect thoughts and memories, and no one could read his inner thoughts and memories.

Except for God.

Only God could transcend the boundaries of magic and break through the impossible.

But everything was too real, and he felt like he was reliving yesterday.

The next moment, Zhao Xu quietly put on his coat, feeling slightly uncomfortable, as if he was not wearing the same clothes he usually wore.

He didn't think much and directly took the elevator to the underground parking lot.

According to his memory, after he returned from his July trip, his parents gave him a car worth tens of thousands of yuan to drive around every day.

Constructing a dream room is easy, but calculating the entire world is a non-trivial task.
So he needs to go out and take a look at this big world.

Zhou Xu pulled open the safety belt buckle, ready to start, but suddenly froze in shock.

Who am I?
