In the 316th chapter, Stop Mining

In the mining area of Starfall Town, two warriors stood beside the stone monument at the only entrance to the town, gazing at the miners who had just arrived from the underground mine. Most of them were local civilians from the nearby Starfall Town, covered in dust after a long period of excavation.

Three monitors from Starfall Town, mostly warriors with a vocation, were standing beside the two warriors. They were responsible for inspecting each miner who arrived, checking for any hidden silver or secret silver.

Although most of the minerals extracted from the underground mine were of high quality, there were still some direct natural finds. The extracted minerals needed further processing, but if it was secret silver, even a small piece was valuable.

After the Alliance defeated Starfall Town, the original mine owners were arrested and taken to Winter City for trial. At the same time, the town's political and economic system was overhauled, with players appointed to key positions.

As a result, the few warrior players in the mining area also became monitors, receiving a certain reward every month.

Just then, a tall and thin man who had just come on duty turned to his bored companion and asked, "Do you know whose this largest mine is?"

The other warrior player, a bit plumper, sighed and said, "I don't know. The other mines were either re-divided among the nobles of Winter City or taken by large guilds. But this largest mine is still a mystery."

If I could have a stake in these mines, I'd really be lying in gold, watching my money grow by itself.
At this moment, a warrior who looked very cunning beside them suddenly whispered, "I've heard it's the Goddess Church."

"That's reasonable, but why is it so mysterious?" a tall and thin man replied, taking a step forward. "After all, the church's contribution in the war is undeniable, and no one will say a word about it."

"Hmm, strange," a plump player suddenly shouted.

"What's going on?" the tall and thin man was about to ask, but his words were interrupted because he realized his body was becoming hazy.

In the entire Starfall Town, countless online players were busy doing various things. Some were negotiating with others, some were attending development meetings at the city hall, some were packing to go hunting, and some were hammering away at their blacksmithing.

At this moment, they all simultaneously discovered that their bodies were becoming hazy, and countless doubts flooded their minds, but they couldn't communicate with others.

This situation was unfolding simultaneously in countless cities and wilderness areas of the Arthurian world.

All players received a message:

【Adventurer XX, your connection to the Arthurian world has been disconnected. Reconnection cooldown: pending.】

Zhou Xuyu removed his helmet, looking puzzled. He had just felt no impact and his body hadn't experienced any intense emotions, yet he had been disconnected directly. He tried reconnecting again, but the reconnection cooldown displayed was pending.

Zhou Xuyu had logged in countless times before, but the countdown timer had always been 20 minutes. This was the first time he had encountered such a strange phenomenon.

Zhou Xuyu took a deep breath and looked out the window, where the leaves were already starting to fall. He got out of bed and walked downstairs.
Here is the translation of the text:

However, when he opened his phone, he found that the entire forum was filled with posts asking about the outage.

【Is the line down?】
【Server maintenance?】
【How come I wasn't notified? I thought it was always maintenance-free】
【Ah, is my character still fighting monsters? It can't be a forced disconnection?】
【Weakly asking, is there compensation for players affected by the unexpected server outage?】
It turns out that the entire server has crashed?

Arthur is not just an ordinary VR game; it's related to the future of humanity on Earth.

Especially after knowing that the Earth may be destroyed in a few years, Zhao Xuan became even more aware of the importance of the opportunity to travel through time after one year.

Even if there are many people who will sacrifice themselves in the future.

Zhao Xuan couldn't imagine what unexpected event caused the entire Arthur to shut down all human projections on Earth.

Because in his previous life, he had never heard of Arthur being shut down.

If it stops working from now on, it would be ridiculous.

The only unusual thing today is that he got to observe closely the ritual of the portal to the Earth universe.

It can't be that it's because of the Earth's people that it affected that ritual?

He shouldn't have died without a word, right?

Especially since it looks like that research was self-contained, he also got to touch it today, and the last time he touched it was when Anniya told him the secrets of meteor showers.

At this moment, Zhao Xuan was directly connected to QQ and the forum, constantly observing the movements of others.

At this moment, he also saw that the QQ group of himself, Wang Qingwei, and Esvee had responded.
Here's the translation of the text:

He last time came from the other side of the god of death, and after reviving, he explained his future plans to the group. However, he hasn't been chatting much since then, and there's been a sense of unfamiliarity.

Eschw: Have you gone offline?

Cond: Yeah, yeah.

Zhongxia: By the way, are the two of you still stuck in the game?

Eschw: No way, you're obsessed, and your QQ is only online for half an hour for meals. I thought you were cut off from the world.

Zhongxia: ...

Cond: Hey, Eschw is also very concerned about his friends.

Eschw: I'm afraid he's gone forever. Anyway, what's the reason for going offline this time?

All three of them are not fools, and they're clear that there's no notification for the disconnection. There must be a deep and mysterious reason behind it.

Eschw: Won't it be permanent? I feel like something is off about this game. Especially after completing that high-level quest, my sense of unease has become even stronger.

Cond: It's not just off, it's really off. There are too many details that are too realistic, so Eschw, you should play more games and try to uncover the secrets of this game.

Eschw: Cond, do you know something?

Cond: No way.

Zhongxia: Yeah, play more and try to get a high score. You won't regret it.

However, just as Zhao Xu finished typing, he knew he was talking nonsense. Cond is now famous among players, not just limited to the wizard in Floating City.

On the other hand, Eschw, who has reached level 3, is extremely secretive.
Here is the translation of the text:

Eswi: I don't know, but after the God of Death appeared in half, it seemed that some force within the association was assessing me, with people coming to observe me multiple times a day.

Zhong Xia: You know, it's probably just to make you aware of something. Initially, everyone gets the "Steel Will" expertise after entering the assessment phase.

Eswi: You're saying that King Arthur is a real world, aren't you?

Qing Wei: If it's true, that would be very interesting.

Zhong Xia: Don't get carried away, focus on leveling up.

After finishing typing, Zhao Xu's attention returned to the forum, and many people have been wondering if King Arthur is a real world.

The civilization involved is simply too rich, and it's no wonder that every player who enters believes it's real, even if they face setbacks in the game and refuse to give up.

Subsequently, Zhao Xu cleared the entire list of friend applications on the forum.

Since posting about King Arthur's confinement and soul destruction methods, the number of people who have added him as a friend has reached a peak.

In the past, most people who added him were asking for experience and even worshiped him. However, now, at least half of the new players asking to add him are asking about how to destroy their souls.

Some players have even provided vivid descriptions to Zhao Xu of how they were deceived in the game, and then begged him to teach them the secrets, so they can exact revenge on the cheaters.

In such cases, Zhao Xu usually types out the incantation for the "Nine Rings of Soul Binding" spell.

He can even draw a simple diagram of the spell structure if needed.

These days, there are just too many people who want to take shortcuts and get ahead quickly.
Here is the translation of the text:

Suddenly, a post was pinned to the top of the forum, directly above all other posts. The post read:

"Respected players, I apologize, but Arthur will be taken offline for 48 hours, during which all login behavior will be disabled."

The person who posted the message was the same one who published the previous post about the "Creation Palace" ID. Seeing this notice made Zhao Xiu also feel like he had hit a rock bottom in his heart.

If he joined the show out of curiosity, causing humans to be unable to connect to Arthur, he would really have to apologize to the whole world.

The 48-hour period, which ends at dawn the next day, coincides with the evening concert, so it won't interfere with his actions. This can be considered a decent holiday.

Thinking about this, Zhao Xiu felt that he had nothing to do today, so he directly opened his computer keyboard and published a question using the forum coins he received from numerous forum players as a reward:

"What should you do if you find yourself as a commoner who has crossed over to Arthur tomorrow?"
