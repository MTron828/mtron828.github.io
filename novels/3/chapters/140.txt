Chapter 141: My Choice

"'Your mysterious knowledge skill has a value of only 4 points less than mine,' Image said quietly to Zhao Xu.

'I have a skill value of 19 points, and with the 8-point feedback from my innate ability, it's a total of 27 points that didn't pass,' Zhao Xu replied.

Generally, a player's skill value is calculated by adding their level to the corresponding attribute adjustment, such as knowledge corresponding to intelligence.

Zhao Xu's knowledge (mysterious) level is one level lower than Image's, and his intelligence adjustment is 3 points less, so his knowledge (mysterious) value is 4 points less than Image's, only 7 points.

After Image stacked his skills, he reached a peak of 19 points, but failed. This is also the reason why he is full of doubts about trying to fill Zhao Xu.

'I have a spell called "Scholar's Song" that can give my skills a +5 bonus,' Zhao Xu explained.

Suddenly, Image took a step closer to Zhao Xu, speaking in a hasty tone: 'Is it for all skills?'

She had reached the core of the question.

Zhao Xu nodded, acknowledging this point.

Facing the player who would later become a high-level mage, lying no longer had any meaning, as everyone was not ordinary.

'I knew it, I knew it,' Image, who was usually extremely confident and arrogant, couldn't help but tap his leg impatiently.

'I almost pored over all the spellbooks at the beginning, trying to find a powerful spell in the skill aspect, but I didn't find any. I even thought it was a mistake in that mage novel,' Zhao Xu said.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

As Soon as the image finished speaking, she couldn't help but gaze at Zhao Xu. However, a sentence like "Little brother, can you teach me this spell?" couldn't come out of her mouth due to her character.

After taking a deep breath to calm down her emotions, the image asked tentatively, "After the effectiveness of the spell, how much additional value can it add?"

Zhao Xu looked at her with a sense of excitement after seeing the spell, and said, "Initially 4 points, and each time the spell is cast, the level of the caster increases by 1 point."

If Zhao Xu had a 10th-level spellcaster, this spell would be able to increase the skill level by almost 9 points, which would crush the image's advantage over Zhao Xu.

At this moment, Luo suddenly spoke up, "Mr. Feng, after we go out, you can evaluate the value of this spell with the person who taught it to you. If you all negotiate and agree, I can lend you the copying fee. I'll just cover the cost with my own money."

The image was about to express her gratitude, but Luo waved her hand to stop her, "Don't worry, the gold coins in that paper bag are enough. I'll just cover it for now."

Zhao Xu was taken aback by Luo's words and couldn't help but think, "How come a rich and beautiful lady would take care of me like this?"

However, after Zhao Xu seemed to have no doubt, the image still handed him the "Intelligence Headband" she had been carrying.

As soon as Zhao Xu put on the "Intelligence Headband", he was indeed moved. Wearing this for 24 hours would activate the attributes provided by the equipment, which would also save his intelligence.

As soon as Zhao Xu put on the "Intelligence Headband", he began to cast the "Song of Knowledge".

The casting time of the "Song of Knowledge" is a few minutes, not as long as the previous identification technique, which took over an hour.
Here is the translation of the text:

So Zhao Xu looked at the long spells in his mind, reciting them word by word.

Finally, at the moment when the spell was completed.

In his mind, a new feeling of clarity emerged.

It wasn't just a bonus from good luck or environmental advantages. For Zhao Xu, it meant a tremendous boost to his personal performance.

He even felt an intense sense of confidence, feeling that he would pass this assessment perfectly.

Zhao Xu focused all his attention on the stone tablet. At this point, his knowledge (mysterious) skills had increased to 15 points.

However, Zhao Xu knew he wasn't enough.

He needed stronger power to help him overcome the obstacles before him.

Suddenly, Zhao Xu's character panel showed that he had reached level 2 and gained the potential points starting to surge.

Each level could only gain 5 potential points, and they would expire and become invalid after that. But for Zhao Xu, it was like an empty promise.

However, the last remaining potential point began to transform into his assistance, following Zhao Xu's will.

Potential points, also known as hero's power.

Any heroes who roam the world can unleash powers beyond ordinary people's reach, all relying on their extraordinary potential.

In an instant, Zhao Xu noticed that his knowledge (mysterious) skills had increased from 15 points to 19 points under the influence of potential points!

"Judgment!"

Zhao Xu exclaimed in his heart.

In an instant, his consciousness began to connect with the source of knowledge.

A 20-sided die appeared in Zhao Xu's consciousness, spinning rapidly.

The final number that fell would be the assistance Zhao Xu could receive from the source of knowledge.
Here is the translation of the text:

The dice suddenly stopped moving, and the spinning steps came to a halt. A cruel "1" was facing upwards.

Zhaoxu's mysterious knowledge skills added up to 19 points, plus an additional 1 point of power from the source, making it nearly 20 points.

However, this was far from enough to overcome the cognitive barrier of the stone monument and successfully communicate with the source.

Zhaoxu's face fell, and the final communication result was still unknown.

But in this critical moment, he knew he had basically failed.

With an additional 19 points from the shadow, plus 8 points from the dice, totaling 27 points, he still couldn't pass. It was obvious that his 20 points were unnecessary.

In this instant, Zhaoxu gazed at the originally static dice, which had already stopped moving and were no longer changeable.

Mages can turn fate around.

Strictly speaking, it is the spell that can turn fate around.

"Let's cooperate immediately!"

Zhaoxu suddenly released the mysterious spell again.

This first-level spell only required an intuitive reaction, and Zhaoxu, as a multi-talented spellcaster, consumed two zero-level spell slots in an instant and successfully released the spell.

The originally static dice began to spin again.

【Adventurer Xiangxia re-ran the knowledge (mysterious test) = 19 + 1D20 = 19 + 11 = 30 points, passing the DC30 difficulty test.】

The dice fell again, but this time the value on top was 11 points.

Zhaoxu's knowledge (mysterious) test result was 30 points, exceeding the 30-layer cognitive barrier and directly communicating with the source.

Suddenly, mysterious symbols on the stone monument began to form in front of him, gradually transforming into content he could understand.

"This is a spell that can be used three times,"

"It can either protect oneself once, save a life once, or reach the other shore once."
Here is the translation of the text to English:

After Zhao Xu finished saying those words, a mysterious glow circle suddenly appeared on his body.

He couldn't help but show a puzzled expression, and he seemed to be using his powers again.

Suddenly, the cracks on the stone tablet spread out in all directions, becoming increasingly dense, and an endless stream of deathly auras began to burst out from within.

Zhao Xu immediately wanted to get the two girls to safety.

But after the stone tablet exploded, a dark and evil force surged out from the depths of hell, mixed with the destruction of death and terror, and suddenly erupted into a massive explosion.

The destruction covered an area of over 100 meters.

Until the darkness dissipated, Zhao Xu's vision returned.

He looked up and saw that the originally desolate and barren cliffside was now deathly still.

The ground seemed to have been plowed with countless furrows.

The thorny vines closest to them were covered with darkness, and the outermost vines were completely decomposed and fell to the ground.

As for Zhao Xu, the two girls had already fallen to the ground, their bodies slightly visible, indicating that they were about to head to the Holy Creation Temple.

Zhao Xu rushed over to them, and after the two girls fell to the ground, their faces were revealed.

But Zhao Xu gazed at the scene before him, as if recalling his past experiences.

His fists were tightly clenched.

"Rescue one and move forward," he said.

"Life is originally meant to be chosen. This is the cruel world of a mage."

The familiar voice of Lei An echoed again, but this time it was different, echoing throughout the entire space.

"Of course, you can also choose to leave behind the one-time revival opportunity and continue on your own. This way, you will have an additional revival opportunity in the future."

"This is the true reward for this trial."

"Act now, and the next decision will determine your true fate."

Note: Lei An is likely a character from the original story, but I did not recognize the name, so I did not translate it.
After the sound of Lei An disappeared, the entire precipice fell silent again, with only Zhao Xu's heavy breathing sound. Zhao Xu turned around, gazing at the endless, profound darkness of the blood moon opposite him.

In front of him, the stone stele that had been shattered by the explosion was already showing a faint, ghostly bridge above the deep abyss.

According to the content of the stele's last words and Lei An's words, the curse had granted him three opportunities. He had already used one to protect himself. One would be used to activate the bridge to obtain true strength. And the remaining one could be used to revive one of the two girls between them. He could even give up and leave the curse as an extra revival opportunity for the future.

Zhao Xu took a deep breath. He gazed at the blood-red sky and sneered, "Screw it, kids make choices, I'm going to save them all!" After saying that, he activated the curse twice in succession.

Two sacred lights shot out directly from the mark on his arm, penetrating the bodies of the two girls.

The two girls, who were about to dissipate, suddenly reformed into solid bodies. Later, Rou and Ying slowly woke up, still in a dark red world, but they had finally taken a breath of the air.

"Get up, the mission has failed, we have to go back," Zhao Xu said with a smile as he sat down, surveying the two girls who were lying in a ridiculous pose.

It was then that Rou and Ying noticed that their hoods had fallen off, completely revealing Zhao Xu's true appearance to him. Ying gazed at Zhao Xu with an unnatural look, then stood up and walked to the spot where the stone stele had exploded, leaving half of it behind.

After Zhao Xu obtained the curse, the true text had already appeared on the stele.

"You should go yourself," Ying whispered.
Here is the translation of the text:

Although we were in a coma, we still vaguely knew what happened just before we died, oh well. I didn't expect Mr. Feng to be so kind, though. Lu bowed slightly and thanked Zhāo Xù with a humble expression.

Zhāo Xù hadn't planned to tell the two girls what happened, but their intelligence was already sufficient for them to figure out the truth on their own.

"However, it's already too late. The task should be considered a failure." Zhāo Xù said clearly, aware of Li ān's style and not leaving any loopholes for them to exploit.

"Maybe not," Lu said with a faint smile.

"Nope," the shadow replied, gazing at the faint floating bridge ahead.

"However, before the past, we might need to go through another self-introduction."

Lu walked over and pulled the shadow to stand beside her in front of Zhāo Xù, introducing herself: "Wáng Cóng Wēi, 2nd-level mage."

The shadow raised an eyebrow, saying, "Ēsī Wēi Xī, 2nd-level mage."

Zhāo Xù scratched his head, saying, "Zhòng Xià, 2... um? 3rd-level mage?"
