Chapter 251: Legendary Staff

Frank's expression turned wistful as he clenched his teeth, causing Zhao Xuan and Lark to subconsciously feel a sense of expectation they shouldn't have.

"Master, I suddenly feel like I want to get something from the other party that's worth crying over," Lark said, her voice trembling with excitement.

"Stay calm," Zhao Xuan quickly soothed Lark. "We don't have that spell."

However, he was also curious. The "Secret Crystal of Silver", worth millions of gold coins, was taken out by Frank without any hesitation. However, it was not easy to convert it into currency, and it was more suitable as a long-term inheritance for future generations. In reality, it was only worth a few hundred thousand gold coins.

As the saying goes: "Only the gold coins that clink in one's hand are true gold."

Zhao Xuan and Lark's attention was captured by Frank's silver-white hands, which were stretching into the dimensional bag. "Master, Lark's heart rate is accelerating."

"Lark, you're a godly artifact, right? Even if the other party is dead, they can still take out a godly artifact," Zhao Xuan said.

"Just take it out and I'll devour it," Lark replied, revealing her true intentions.

But before Zhao Xuan could be shocked by the implications of this sentence, he saw Frank take out a staff that Zhao Xuan recognized - the Higher Magic Instant Release Staff!

"Sending beggars off, ha!" Lark immediately drew a conclusion.

Zhao Xuan gazed at the staff, over a meter long, made of metal, and said coldly: "I don't lack instant release techniques."
Here is the translation of the text to English:

It's said that this staff can be used three times a day to cast instant-cast spells 1-9. In reality, it's equivalent to a mage's divine instrument. It can allow Zhao Xu to avoid the high-four-circle spell slot cost required for instant-casting. This is particularly significant in the intense time-sensitive battles of magic warfare.

Originally, Zhao Xu could only cast one "buff" spell per round, and then had to recover and adjust his own state. If he had this "staff" or learned the "instant-casting" specialization, he could cast an additional "instant-cast" spell in the same round within the time limit.

In the past, Zhao Xu had relied on burning his internal potential points to cast a spell, "Ice Ray", and then instant-cast another spell immediately after, which allowed him to "successfully" hit Annyia. However, after he advanced to level 6 and became a "Super Mage", this staff was no longer meaningful to him. He could now cast spells without any cost, and holding it felt awkward and took up hand space.

"Don't worry, master," Frank, the mage, hurriedly explained. "This is just an accessory."

Then, a staff worth 170,000 gold coins was carelessly tossed aside by Frank, rolling onto the 20,000 gold coins just prayed out by Zhao Xu.

"It seems that the treasure owner didn't expect that the two intruders would take out something more valuable than the items on the shelf," Lacis' voice also rose in pitch.

Perhaps the treasure owner didn't expect that the two intruders would take out something more valuable than the items on the shelf.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Legendary Death Spellstaff, it has four evil spells, and I can say that they are spells that the master wouldn't want to cast easily." Laksis explained.

"That's the evil or death element spell? But the goddess has a part of the death deity, right?" Zhao Xu said.

"It's because the goddess has this deity that he dares to give you this staff, otherwise it would be ridiculing him in his face." Laksis said. "It's because you can simulate those spells with miracle spells, and it may shock the Fiendish God, and possibly even interrupt the synchronization. But with this staff, you can avoid that."

"The main thing is that this staff, the master, you can use it in the future too."

Zhao Xu heard this and remained expressionless, looking at Frankie.

At this time, Frankie also let out a proud tone, as if the king was showcasing his territory's border.

He took out a silk handkerchief and lightly wrapped it around the staff made from the finger bones, as if he felt that the fingerprint was a kind of pollution, and his eyes showed a reluctant expression.

"This legendary death spellstaff is what I dug up from a half-witch's tomb. At that time, it still had over thirty spells left, but I didn't dare to use it, and it's still like that to this day."

As Frankie said this, he couldn't help but grip the long finger bone staff tightly, "It has four spells on it, respectively, the Death Arrangement (six circles), Summoning Higher Ghosts (eight circles), Death Finger (seven circles), and Binding Soul Spell (nine circles), do you understand its significance?"

"The master thinks you're a devout pastor and will offer this thing to the church, haha, I guess it's because of this that he deliberately chose this one."
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu couldn't help but whisper to Luxion, "It feels like it's targeted at the next battle, but I can't convert my necromantic spell into that giant scythe." Luxion looked up and replied, "No, master, it's possible." Luxion's expression turned serious, "You're using the divine magic of the Fiendish Servant, so it's not allowed. However, the master of this necromantic staff, the half-witch, is a believer in the god of the dead, so it might be possible to convert it to some extent."

"What extent?" Zhao Xu listened attentively, his eyes narrowing slightly.

"Death Array" is a spell that kills all living creatures in a certain area and then summons them as undead. "Summoning a Higher Undead" can also summon a level 11 "Prisoner Spirit".

All these spells can help him cause massive destruction on the battlefield. "I'm not sure if the efficiency of the conversion will be higher than my own attacks with the giant scythe."

Frank, who was standing nearby, asked with a humble tone, "Do you think these two staffs are worth it?"

Frank knew that if he lost these two staffs, his strength would weaken. However, if he acquired the ability to cast spells through intuition, he wouldn't need to stay here anymore.

"Luxion, it's getting tricky," Zhao Xu said, pretending to think deeply.

"Master, there are more ways to cast spells through intuition besides this one," Luxion said. "You just used the trigger spell, but he can't recognize it."

Zhao Xu gritted his teeth and said, "It's just that I know some ways."

"What?! You're more knowledgeable than me?! Unbelievable!" Luxion exclaimed.

"That's the 'Original Force Scholar' for you," Zhao Xu said. "They have the ability to achieve it, but they just can't develop their potential."

"That's not our problem," Zhao Xu added.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

"Lucy, if we keep going like this, we'll eventually join the 'chaos' faction," Zhao Xu said with a sigh.

"Heh heh, don't worry, the chaos faction also has a good side, and we're not taking anything from him, so we won't become evil," Lucy defended herself. "We're not taking anything from him, but if he's willing to tell us his secrets, we'll tell him to take the Mystic Route."

Zhao Xu had previously met a Seven in the Morlin Stone and had been recommended the profession of "Force Scholar" by the other party.

However, his latent potential points belonged to the enhanced version of the latent potential points, which even covered some of the professional abilities of the original "Force Scholar" profession, so it was not adopted as his advancement.

However, it could not be denied that the "Force Scholar" profession had the ability to cast "Intuitive Casting" spells, which was incredibly powerful and tyrannical.

Any spell could be cast in front of others before they could react.

Compared to casting "Quick Explosion", it was even more convenient to withstand the dizzying effect of "Quick Explosion".

Zhao Xu thought about giving up, and then he turned to Frank and said, "I have a way to advance."

Just as Zhao Xu finished speaking, Frank suddenly slumped back into his original chair, as if all his energy had been drained.

His outer shell, which was once shining, became dull and lifeless.

He shook his head in despair, "It's just that I've reached my own limit."

"It's just that he's cut off the legendary path," Lucy added in time.

"Why do you have to find a way to do this?" Zhao Xu suddenly realized that things were not as simple as he thought.

At this moment, Frank, the nine-ring mage, suddenly buried his face in his hands and curled up in the shadows.

"I want to restore my wife's soul."
Here is the translation:

"I was once a talented mage. My progress in magic was extremely fast, and by the age of 30, I had become a four-circle mage. However, I knew that my lifespan was not enough to continue on this path."

"So I made a deal with the devil and obtained the 'Emerald Star Master' title, which grants eternal life."

"But the devil twisted the agreement and took away my wife's soul. After that, I realized that some things are more valuable than magic."

"In the end, the devil told me three conditions. One of them was that I could recover my wife's soul if I fulfilled one of them."

"After hearing these words, Zhao Xu suddenly fell silent.

On the brink of despair, he begged the devil, and in the end, he was taken away by the devil to grasp something even more important.

It seemed that these people who made deals with the devil were stuck in a repetitive tragedy.

"What are the other two conditions?" Zhao Xu asked.

"To become a legendary mage," Frank hesitated to say.

"Not that simple," Zhao Xu immediately pierced through the point.

This was clearly what the devil needed a powerful mage for.

Frank, on the other hand, looked like a gambler who had lost everything, and he didn't even have the strength to lift his head.

"Not wrong, after fulfilling one of the conditions, I'll serve them for three years and be done," Frank said.

Zhao Xu mocked, "Are you sure you can take back your wife's soul after serving for three years? Now that you're a nine-circle mage, you don't even have the courage to go to the ninth hell to retrieve that soul, and the other party is probably the lord of the underworld."

Frank shook his head in despair, "It's a disguised lord of the underworld, and it's been using a fake name to communicate with me, so I don't even know how to contact it in the underworld."

"Master, let him contact that devil, and we'll give it a try. Who knows, maybe I'll become the Book of All Laws," Lark said in anger.

"Are you overextending yourself?"
Here is the translation:

"Oh, I've got some energy after being driven by this coward Frank, I'll just lie down for 14 more days and that's it."

"I'm just going to specialize in 'Iron Will' and beat 'Deep Dungeon Labyrinth', and now I have to beat the embodiment of the Lord of the Nine Hells?"

Zhao Xu thought he was getting a bit carried away.

Just as he was thinking this, he suddenly spoke up to Frank, saying: "You go talk to the devil, I'll go have a chat with him."
