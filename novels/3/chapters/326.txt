Chapter 327: Landing Game

Zhao Xu had faced the scenario of monsters charging towards him countless times, and his heart remained unflappable. He had once interacted with half-refined hell creatures, and his mind began to recall the detailed data and various weaknesses of the opponents.

In front of Zhao Xu, in a dimension that no one could see, the undead creature "Ji Hun Mo" - which he controlled - had already begun to lurk in the spirit realm, hiding in plain sight like a ghostly presence.

Unless one possessed the "True Knowledge" or was a spirit itself, it was impossible to detect their existence. Half-refined hell creatures, like ghosts, could enhance their own abilities by "templates".

Generally speaking, becoming a half-refined hell creature would grant a significant boost to one's attributes, with a 2-4 point increase in six attributes. They would also gain magic defense, multiple elemental resistances, and a strengthened 1st-tier natural defense armor.

Additionally, they could acquire the "Break the Good" sword skill and various spell abilities as their life dice increased.

As a result, most monsters would become 1-3 levels stronger after transforming into a half-refined hell creature. The more life dice, the higher the level.

However, just as Peter was about to rush into Zhao Xu's threat range, Zhao Xu had already raised his staff, preparing to activate his daily 3-second instant ability.

But in the blink of an eye, Peter, now a half-refined hell creature, suddenly kicked his legs backwards.
Here is the translation of the text:

He forced his legs to stop the car abruptly in front of Zhao Xu, and the extraordinary strength of his leg muscles, which had become abnormal, suddenly propelled him towards the window in front of him.

After his strength increased by 4 points, even though Peter was originally an ordinary person, he could now be considered strong and powerful.

The thin wooden board on the window suddenly became a barrier to prevent light from passing through, and Peter's body crashed into it, causing the window frame to distort and warp.

Peter then burst out a huge hole and tried to squeeze out of the window.

Just as Peter was about to emerge from the window, Zhao Xu released his control spell.

As the main attacking force was the demonic soul, Zhao Xu's spell was naturally inclined towards control.

Peter, who had become a half-forged demonic being, had just climbed over half of his body when he suddenly felt a slow and stagnant force emanating from behind him, spreading from his feet to the top of his head.

As Peter just emerged from the window, he suddenly fell heavily to the ground, feeling a sense of discord throughout his body.

He was like a clock that had been slowed down.

Original Peter, who had just climbed out of the window, was about to continue his escape, grasping at the fleeting moment.

When he heard the sound of the clock striking, he didn't think much of it.

But when he saw the two people entering from behind him, he suddenly recognized that it was his classmate, Elliot, who was easily torn apart by him.

However, the man standing in front of him gave him a huge sense of pressure.

This was a feeling of direct life or death urgency that he had experienced before, which made him decisively give up his seat on the throne of the law and awaken as a wizard.

Peter also made up his mind to retreat immediately.

However, at this moment, although he was not controlled, he was even more troublesome than being controlled.
Here is the translation of the text:

At this moment, Peter struggled to stand up, looking back at Zhao Xu, who had turned around and walked out the door, "What have you done to me?"

His voice was coarse, like a burning piece of charcoal was stuck in his throat.

As soon as Peter finished speaking, his entire body shook, and he immediately rolled over and continued to roll towards the front, without even looking back.

At this moment, a sudden and intense "whooshing" sound echoed through the empty space, as the ghost soul demon suddenly appeared and extended its pale and deformed bone claws towards the front.

Although the bone claws looked weak, they had enough power to strip the skin off an ordinary person.

"Eliot exclaimed, 'He's running away!'"

After Peter dodged the ghost soul demon's attack by rolling over, he quickly rolled forward again, trying to create enough distance.

However, his entire body was already affected by Zhao Xu's "Slow Down" spell, making him extremely slow.

Each time Peter moved, he felt like he was being pulled back by an invisible rope, as if he were a wooden puppet trying to escape.

Watching this scene, Zhao Xu's expression remained calm.

In the instant Peter failed to resist the "Slow Down" spell, his fate was already sealed.

If the spell couldn't be resisted, then it was pointless for the mage to die.

Peter could only rely on his teleportation magic to escape, otherwise, he would be unable to escape under the dual attacks of the ghost soul demon and the "Slow Down" spell.

Under the effect of the "Slow Down" spell, all actions related to movement, such as attacking, defending, or dodging, would be weakened by one level.

Furthermore, on average, Peter could only perform a limited number of actions per round, equivalent to half of what he could do before.

Originally, an ordinary person could make a dash and then launch another attack.
After being afflicted with the "Slowdown" status, Peter launched a sudden sprint attack, but had to pause and couldn't immediately catch up to attack again. This is the powerful effect of "Control Magic".

Even undead creatures can develop immunity to many negative states, and the Slowdown status still takes effect. At this point, Peter, who had lost his way in the half-refined prison, came back to his senses and directly changed his target, spreading his wings and rushing towards Elliot.

Compared to other monsters with low intelligence, Peter strengthened his intelligence by 4 points. His thoughts became incredibly clear, and in an instant, he realized that Elliot was his only chance to escape.

As long as he distracted everyone's attention to Elliot, he could continue to forcibly retreat and fly outside the estate.

Mistress Rizla, who possessed a mysterious seal, was concerned about the existence of the floating city, implying that no one dared to trespass. However, in his slow state, Peter's actions were half as far as others. His ghostly soul behind him immediately pounced on him, pinning him down, and used its grasp ability to immobilize Peter, rendering him unable to move.

At this time, Peter's face grew even more sinister, and his black, crimson scales began to tremble.

"Heart Dark Arts," he immediately activated this type of magical ability.

Suddenly, a dark aura began to spread, shrouding them.

"Ah, we can't see anything now," Elliot exclaimed.

"Daytime darkness is useless. Only deep, dark arts are effective," Zhao Xiu explained.

As expected, despite it not being noon, the light still instantly dispelled Peter's "Heart Dark Arts" ability.

Zhao Xiu saw this scene and realized the situation was hopeless.
Here is the translation:

The others had thrown out their useless dark arts, and everything was reset to zero.

"Sir, I've heard that these biological beings can master many types of magical abilities without needing any further protection," Eriton asked.

Zhao Xu shook his head, "The magical abilities obtained by half-demon biological beings are upgraded as their life dice increase. For example, a half-demon biological being with a life dice value of one will possess dark arts. With each subsequent increase of two life dice, they can acquire sacrilegious arts, shadow attacks, poison attacks, and plague arts, all the way up to the seventh ring's gray smoke god art. However, these abilities are ineffective against undead beings."

The magical abilities obtained by half-demon biological beings, regardless of which one, are deadly against humans who are good.

However, when they encounter a soul demon, a being with no life force, who is also part of the evil camp, they lose all possibility of resistance.

At this point, he handed over the inspection badge to Eriton and ordered him to go find the patrol and notify the Rose Cross personnel.

Later, Zhao Xu silently watched the house, thinking about Peter's just-jumped-out-of-the-window escape and the reason he became a half-demon biological being in this house.

...

"Thank you, Qi Qi," Zheng Xin allowed, directly taking the package and opening it with the paper cutter on the coffee table.

At this moment, Qi Qi looked somewhat stunned, "What's going on, Xin Xin? You've changed!"

Because at this moment, there was a "brain domain helmet" that matched the game on her gaze.
Here is the translation of the text:

Ordinarily, people without such needs won't deliberately go to that configuration, except that it will make the device even more cumbersome and generate more heat.

"You played games? Which game do you want to play?" Qi Qi seemed to have discovered a new continent.

"And you're just like Arthur," Zheng Xin'an seemed to have noticed nothing out of the ordinary, happily admiring the game helmet he had just obtained.

"Your parents didn't let you play games in your spare time, so how did you suddenly change your mind? I kept urging you to play games in the past, but you never listened to my advice, humph!" Qi Qi suddenly complained.

Zheng Xin'an then also stuck out his tongue, looking embarrassed.

At that moment, he also showed a nostalgic expression, "I met a strange and interesting person before, and that's why I felt this urge."

As for the gift of a game code given by the other person, Zheng Xin'an thought it was better to keep it a secret.

Otherwise, Qi Qi would definitely make a big fuss and plot a romantic storyline for her novel, "Youth Memories".

"That's it, you need to do your homework first, this game is too hardcore. I'm only level 1 now and can only cling to my classmates, asking them to help me level up."

Qi Qi then also looked worried, "Have you chosen your profession yet? Do you want to be like me and let me guide you?"

"I've thought about it," Zheng Xin'an said calmly, his gaze seeming to pierce through everything, fixed on the paper note tightly clutched in his hand.

"Paladin."
