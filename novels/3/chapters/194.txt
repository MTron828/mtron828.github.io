Chapter 195: Random Divine Tool

When Zhao Xu heard such explosive news, his mind remained calm.

In fact, there were many rumors about the Earth's power in the previous life, and many people thought it was related to the Seventh Prophecy. However, no one knew the details of the Seventh Prophecy, and all speculations were just superficial.

However, considering that the Seventh Prophecy pointed to a future supreme god, Zhao Xu suddenly felt a sense of melancholy towards Wang Qingwei. The reason was that Wang Qingwei had jumped out too early, even with the powerful backing of the Mage Association. If there were only two players on the chessboard, it was natural to take the initiative and gradually put pressure on the opponent. However, when there are multiple players, sometimes the best strategy is to make a bold move and take risks.

Revealing oneself too early would only allow the remaining forces to adjust their targets and focus on the opponent. After all, everyone wants their chosen Earth candidate to become the final supreme god, and at the very least, cannot be an enemy force.

In this case, Wang Qingwei's previous achievements made her a thorn in the side of those who knew the Zero Prophecy and tried to intervene and appoint a proxy force. It was obvious that Zhao Xu was a potential candidate in the First Prophecy, and if he could keep a low profile, he might be able to survive for a long time. Even if he was exceptional, he would have to abandon the suspicion that he was a candidate for the Seventh Prophecy.

As Zhao Xu thought about this, he had already returned to the original intersection where he had set up the "Magic Alert" earlier. Zhao Xu had originally set up this alert, tightly attaching it to the other three intersections. Since then, this alert had remained motionless.
Here is the translation:

Although the "Deep Infernal Furnace" has spell resistance, the "Magic Alert" is unaffected by spell resistance and cannot be avoided. Anyone who enters the alert area without preparation will trigger it.

The "Deep Infernal Furnace" is located right in the middle of the road, hiding behind the altar to perform its ritual. These demons from the material plane are very unimaginative, always thinking about how to create a portal to another dimension, but never considering whether they have the ability to do so.

Laxus looked at Zhao Xuan with his mind-reading ability and said, "I'll only trigger your transformation artifact if I walk to the altar."

Zhao Xuan had previously used his "Mind Link" ability to communicate with Anni and Ray, and this process was like second nature to him.

"That's right," Laxus said. "It's a requirement of the ritual."

Zhao Xuan suddenly felt a headache. For mages, the most unbearable thing is unpredictability, which means they have to establish a battle plan based on many unknowns.

However, Laxus suddenly smiled and said, "But you have six chances, though."

Six chances?

Zhao Xuan immediately reacted, "I'm not going to resurrect in Mistral, am I?"

The resurrective stone naturally returns to the city, and if anything unexpected happens, it will resurrect near the temple in the city.

Laxus smiled smugly and said, "You can resurrect nearby the temple. Then, as the master, you just need to wait for a week for my ability to recover, and you can continue the second experiment."

"Can I not go out for a week?" Zhao Xuan asked.

"No, you can't," Laxus said. "The ritual itself refuses any external interference. If new power intervenes, you may need to challenge the lord of the underworld to complete the ritual."
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu suddenly felt like he had gone too far.
According to Laxus' hint, after his death, he revived at the moment of creation in the Holy Sacrament, and it was possible to choose to revive in the God's domain of the fallen god, relying on the still struggling altar.
"Three to five attempts will be enough, and if the fifth revival stone fails, I'll head back to Mistral," Zhao Xu said.
It's not easy to get to this point, and he was hesitant to bet on "Eternal Sacred Art" and become one of the candidates for the "Divine Being" prophesied in the prophecy. He would cut his losses in time.
Actually, it's not necessary to use the fifth revival stone. After using the third revival stone, Zhao Xu would make a decision based on the details of the challenge. If the situation was less than 20% win rate, he wouldn't need to gamble with the last two revival stones.
"Don't worry, Master," Laxus said, self-promoting himself, "the artifact of my incarnation is still very strong, you know."
"Because, as the will of the artifact, I can determine all uncertain things," Laxus said.
Uncertainty?
Zhao Xu suddenly became sensitive to this term and remembered the card he had seen in the first storage room of the Itreya's inheritance.

"Can you change into the card 'Tao of Constant Change' and allow me to draw a certain number of cards?" Zhao Xu asked.
"Can't," Laxus interrupted Zhao Xu's fantasy immediately, "because the 'Tao of Constant Change' itself is certain, with all 22 cards, and it's not the card itself but you who is uncertain. So I can't change your uncertainty."
After listening to the somewhat convoluted explanation, Zhao Xu decided to give up on his idea of drilling into the transformed artifact.

"Lady, I suggest you choose random transformation for the first time and try to make the artifact's duration as long as possible," Lark suggested.

"Do you mean to bet on a blind cat crossing the road?" Zhao Xu asked.

"Oh, master, it feels like you're finally showing some semblance of a mage's style," Lark continued to flatter him, but it sounded a bit annoying.

At this point, Zhao Xu also started to think deeply.

He only knew the standard data of the "Deep Furnace Refining" and had no idea whether the other party had a part-time job or not.

So, the target "Deep Furnace Refining" might be stronger than he imagined.

Even if the other party had a part-time job as a 20th-level mage, Zhao Xu could completely give up the quest after using up the first resurrection stone.

Lark's transformation focus was 30% possible, with the cost being a very short duration. Even if the transformed artifact's result was not what he wanted, he still had to bear the short-term cost.

However, as long as Zhao Xu experienced the same type of artifact transformation three times, the probability of getting the target artifact he wanted was already 90%, which was sufficient.

So, Zhao Xu could arrange the second to fourth transformations as short-duration focused transformations.

The first time would be random transformation, simply relying on the long-term effect of the artifact to explore the situation of the Deep Furnace Refining.

As Lark said, it was a matter of taking a chance.
Here is the translation of the text:

Even if the first round of transformation had led to obtaining the divine tool that Zhao Xu wanted, facing the possibility of other evil methods, his winning rate would not be high.

This is also the reason why Lux did not suggest him to continuously use the transformation technique four times in a row.

After all, it's a try, and a direct try at a long duration, and who knows if there's still a possibility of winning.

After thinking clearly about this point, Zhao Xu walked straight to the road ahead, and walked all the way to the dark and black stone door.

At this time, Zhao Xu gently pressed his hand on the Nether Saint Seal pattern in the middle of the stone door, which was a massive scythe symbolizing the harvesting of life.

"I am the master of death," Zhao Xu muttered the password that Lux told him.

The altar was set up with too many shielding rituals, even if he used the "Spatial Gate" to pass through, he would still be attacked by the altar.

The only safe way was to touch the Nether Saint Seal and recite the password.

Originally, the dark and black saint seal suddenly burst out with a bright red glow, as if the scythe had been tempered red-hot, and a transmission power flowed through the saint seal into Zhao Xu's body.

The next moment, Zhao Xu appeared in a massive, dome-shaped ritual hall, surrounded by a row of stone statues of fallen Nether Saint, each with a different shape, symbolizing the various forms of Nether Saint at different times. The scythe was always by his side.

In the middle, there was a altar emitting a faint red glow, and in front of the altar stood a demon from the depths of hell, about 4 meters tall, with scales all over his body, with flames burning on top, and massive wings wrapping around half of his body.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

The mouth of the deep-forged demon was fully open, with all its sharp fangs emitting a foul odor. Two of the most protruding venomous fangs had already touched the bottom of the jaw, with greenish liquid dripping down continuously. Meanwhile, its large nostrils kept emitting thick black smoke, as if its internal organs were filled with rolling molten lava.

At this moment, the deep-forged demon also noticed Zhao Xun's arrival, staring at him with a ruthless gaze.

"Transform!" Zhao Xun immediately commanded Lakshmi.

Instantly, Zhao Xun's entire "inner shell" disappeared, transforming into a mysterious blue glow that shot up to the sky.

The energy then condensed and transformed into a flash of lightning, illuminating the entire ritual hall with its deep and cold arc light.

After the blue lightning struck in front of Zhao Xun, it suddenly took shape.

As a stream of information flooded into his body, Zhao Xun suddenly understood what it was.

One was a magical artifact that could allow an ordinary person without magical abilities to perform the magic recorded above - the Tome of All Laws!
