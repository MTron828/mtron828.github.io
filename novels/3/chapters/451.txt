Chapter 452: The Exposed Risk

"What does this mean?" As the first player, Zhao Xu not only possesses an unparalleled aura but also pays attention to the growth of the player team.

"It means that this route will project you onto Arthur's channel, and it's possible to terminate it at any time."

"Even tomorrow?" Zhao Xu exclaimed on the spot.

"Do you hope so?" An Ti Noya smiled. "If so, I can try my best in my personal capacity to help you."

"No, no," Zhao Xu quickly waved his hand. Besides his own exceptional magical items, Zhao Xu's true strength lies in his ability to almost use "Spell Extreme" and "Spell Twin" without any cost, and then combine them with powerful spells.

He is equivalent to using high-level spells, such as those with over 10 rings, to fight against players with only a few rings.

However, he still faces the problem of "sustainability" in terms of his own abilities.

This kind of all-around growth through unlimited resources has not yet allowed him to freely exercise his will in Arthur's journey.

As for the vast majority of players, many of whom have just escaped the difficulties of the initial training period, some have undergone training in several professions and have only just found their suitable path.

For them, Arthur's journey has just begun.

It's only the new player that's suffered from the premature termination.

"What's the problem with that material energy channel?" Zhao Xu asked.
Here is the translation of the text:

After getting close to the energy-activating devices, Zhao Xu almost caused a malfunction in the energy channel, resulting in a nearly one-day-long disconnection of the entire network. Later, he specially studied the principles of transmission and projection magic with An Ti Nuo Ya, who explained it to him in a rough way, and he could understand it completely.

An Ti Nuo Ya lightly brushed her hair aside, revealing her delicate face, while Nan Xiao Wei had already fallen asleep beside her, with a faint smile on her face, as if she had encountered a sweet dream.

As Zhao Xu watched, he saw that An Ti Nuo Ya was lightly raising her fingertips, and suddenly, a series of magical structures began to appear in the air. She began to explain the internal principles of this unusual magic to Zhao Xu.

Zhao Xu looked at her as if an invisible fluorescent pen was writing and drawing in the airflow, and he couldn't help but glance back at the "camera" in the living room, which had been installed to prevent theft.

He was almost certain that his dad would open the camera tonight, under the "guidance" of his mom, to take a look at the "An Ti Nuo Ya" who visited today.

Even this might become a topic for their chat for the next few months.

"Not to worry," An Ti Nuo Ya smiled. "I noticed the camera as soon as I came in, so I've already cast a spell to prevent anyone from reviewing it. They will only find that we've been having a normal conversation."

Zhao Xu reacted quickly.

"Are there magic spells that target highly advanced technological worlds?"

"Yes, of course," An Ti Nuo Ya simply replied before explaining the specific magical structures to Zhao Xu.

"The reason for the channel's anomaly is that the power of exploring the Earth's forces has exceeded its own load."

"The channel itself is a path, whether it's on a higher level or a lower level, and it's taking advantage of it to stretch out and try to place its pawns in this future major change."
Here is the translation of the text:

"The road was being crushed by various heavy carts, and it would eventually collapse. Suddenly, Zhao Xu's eyes lit up, 'Including us players?' 'No mistake,' Anzhiyao nodded, 'But the players' strength is too weak. It's as if ordinary people walking on a asphalt road outside wouldn't have a significant impact, unless...' 'Unless what?' 'Unless a massive crowd surges into Arthur at once, which might cause a road congestion. Then, under such conditions, it might lead to the 'blocking' of the material energy channel.' Anzhiyao looked at Zhao Xu's eyes as if she had already understood his inner thoughts.

However, Zhao Xu quickly changed the subject, 'Teacher, according to what you just said, it means that there are players in Arthur's hidden areas who have obtained extreme enhancements, just like me?' 'Theoretically, that's what it says. But I have to remind you that for these "pawns", the strength of the seven major tribes except for the strength of the seven major tribes is unable to expose themselves in the "jump-out" clause you observed.'

Anzhiyao spoke calmly, but deeply implied that she had a firm grasp of everything that was happening on Earth.

"That is to say, there may be players who have a status like 'Vivian's'?" Zhao Xu asked in surprise.

"No mistake,' Anzhiyao replied.

Despite sitting in his own home, which was the safest place for him, Zhao Xu still felt a slight sense of 'caution' in his heart.

Vivian's challenge level was as high as level 7, and adding the 3rd level Saint Warrior, it would be level 10 in strength."
Here is the translation of the text:

In reality, even a perfectly normal 10th-level Saint Warrior would not be as powerful as her. If Vivian were to be included in the statistics, she would be calculated as a "3rd-level player" at best.

In fact, her current 3rd level is equivalent to a 7th-level challenge. In other words, there may be some "players" who, through the "rite" or "spell", have transformed into powerful species.

Most of these people probably have no profession or only a weak level or two. They cannot be observed by other players through the "jump clause" and seem to be hiding in the shadows.

"It seems I'm not the most abnormal one yet, with my continuous resource allocation," Zhao Xu comforted himself.

"You're being too optimistic. Conversion of ordinary species can be achieved by paying the price of 'life energy'. I can help you convert into a powerful being like Barlo, almost legendary," said the mentor.

"It's just a high-priced wish," Zhao Xu said.

Just then, Annyonja looked at Zhao Xu with a hopeful expression. "Do you know what, Zhongxia?"

"Humanity, for mages, is the ultimate choice. Even if it's a high-level elf who has made a significant contribution to magic, it can't compare to this," said Annyonja.

"So, in the end, it was Ernest who defeated the Elf Empire and became the sole ruler. Even the successive Mage Goddesses were all human," Annyonja added.

Zhao Xu listened carefully, his eyes narrowed in thought.

"Teacher, wouldn't you tell me this tomorrow too?"
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xuanye's intention is that An Tiya doesn't need to visit in person. The risk is too great, and it's possible that she would have to modify the memories of each individual involved. However, with the numerous surveillance cameras on Earth, if she fails to modify the footage, it could be exposed through the internet's fast dissemination speed, and she might have to face the memories of all humans on Earth.

"How is that?" An Tiya said. "After communicating with May once, she reminded me."

"What do you mean?" someone asked.

"Every time you encounter divine power, there's a possibility of contracting a spiritual essence. Within Arthur's natural barrier, there's no problem, and the stronger the supernatural power, the more it will be suppressed, and your contaminated essence will become invisible."

"But on Earth, a powerful being who is unknown to humans might appear if you're targeted. If that happens, you might really die in your dreams."

"So, this time I came to observe whether there are any 'special' traces in your school and home."

"Especially, the divine agreement to prevent excessive use of power, which directly exposed your 'name', making your situation even more dangerous."

Zhao Xuanye's eyes widened in shock.

He couldn't have imagined that he would be targeted directly by a "superior being" who transcended the network.

Originally, he had planned to reveal his true identity to his nearby friends, such as his classmates, after the "Zhong Xia" incident. However, that thought was instantly dismissed.

Secrecy is the key to survival.

However, he planned to develop his influence using the name of the president of the "Starfall Association" and relying on the power of the government, which would not be affected by this incident.
Here is the translation of the text:

Indeed, when Arthur is a true world behind him, he cannot just consider it from a game perspective.

"That mentor, are we still going to cross over in four months?" Zhao Xu asked again.

In the next four months, he will have to be extremely cautious.

"Not wrong, but I suggest you prepare mentally to face various unexpected situations."

"Alright, I should leave now."

Antoinette stood up directly, "I have set up warning spells in your dorm room and your home, and for the short term, it's not a big problem."

Zhao Xu also realized that this was the reason Antoinette needed to visit him personally.

Just before reaching the door, Antoinette suddenly stopped and looked back at Zhao Xu, extending her hand.

"What?" Zhao Xu was puzzled.

At that moment, Antoinette was standing in front of the shoe rack at the entrance, looking back at Zhao Xu in surprise: "May said that when I first visited, your mother should give me a 'red envelope', saying that this is a normal custom here. Since she just left in a hurry, it should be you who gives it to me."

Zhao Xu could only smile awkwardly and didn't dare to say that this was a custom for the first formal visit to the parents with a girlfriend.

He could only say with a slight embarrassment, "Teacher, I suggest you and May go get this 'red envelope'."

"Okay."

Antoinette also nodded slightly, as she didn't want to be impolite and had mentioned this to Zhao Xu.

At this time, she pushed open the security door.

However, when Antoinette stepped onto the "peaceful entrance" red mat, it seemed that she suddenly remembered something and turned back to Zhao Xu, urging him.

"Zhao, really, don't give up, okay?"

"What?"

"Remember, the gods are not in July."
