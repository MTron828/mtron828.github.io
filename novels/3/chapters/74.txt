Chapter 075 Summoning Thunderstorm
The druid glanced at Roya and said, "The last person who destroyed nature and tried to bribe me, Ootmar Esi, I have to remember."
Following Roya, Lak almost lost his balance and fell off the horse.
The faces of the surrounding attendants turned pale when they heard about the destruction of nature.
Looking at the tree people around him, no one could resist the anger of the great druid in front of them.
After taking a deep breath, Roya gripped the handle of his knife and, as if drawing courage from it, said seriously, "Druid Ootmar Esi, where do we start with the destruction of nature? We were just transporting some supplies to the border."
The druid Ootmar Esi looked down at Roya and sneered, "I don't care about your tricks behind the scenes. I only know that your convoy cannot pass through here."
"The last time you sent things, it destroyed almost half of the Southern Forest. We have agreed that from now on, any involvement in the supplies between Kaso City and Butan City will not be allowed to pass through the Northern Forest."
Upon hearing this, Roya's face turned pale, and he quickly said, "Sir, you know we have always been very careful to protect the forest, even every timeâ€”"
"Get lost. If it weren't for the sake of your leader, Iss, the people appearing here would be from the Tianbei Business Alliance."
After speaking, the druid Ootmar Esi looked at Roya, who was still not giving up, and began to chant a spell directly.
Here is the translation of the text:

The adventurer rolled a 7+D20=7+19=26 on the identification of the druid's spell, exceeding the DC20, and successfully identified it as a 5th-level divine summoning spell, "Call Lightning Storm".

Zhao Xu saw this dynamic flash by and was stunned for a moment.

This druid is really saying it and doing it?

The highest consecutive 15 times 5D6 (5-30) damage fall of lightning, no one's life value can withstand such destruction.

Facing such a high-level spellcaster chanting incantations, the maple leaves quartet were completely stunned, not knowing what the next plot would be.

Only everyone dared not to move rashly, not daring to make any actions that might mislead others.

Because these oak tree people can destroy them.

The knife had not yet struck the body when everyone was hoping for a change.

Zhao Xu looked at the druid casting the spell and the lightning storm gathering above.

He had no single level 1 arcane or divine spell that could solve the current predicament.

If it were a 3rd-level summoning spell, he would calculate it and run 70 meters to avoid it.

However, this 5th-level summoning lightning storm, with a range of 300 meters, Zhao Xu could not open up this distance within 6 seconds.

This is the tragedy of a 1st-level mage like Arthur, with a shortage of blood and legs, and his spells are crushed.

If lucky, maybe 12 HP warrior Maple Leaf could withstand it, but Zhao Xu with 8 points of HP basically had little hope.

The damage curve is basically a normal distribution, with the highest probability of 15-16 points of damage in the middle.

Only hitting 5-7 points of damage, it's not just the goddess of magic who favors him, but also the goddess of good fortune who favors him.

Not daring to think such nonsense, Zhao Xu directly took out the assassin's dagger given to him by Anzhiya from his backpack.

He still couldn't bear to activate the assassin's dagger engraved on his back.
Zhao Xu's Howard convenience bag allowed him to directly take out what he wanted, without a second's delay, and he felt the courage brought by the items in his hand.
However, at this moment, accompanied by a roaring sound, beyond Zhao Xu's estimation, the druid's spell was completed even faster.
A shocking thunderbolt directly struck three meters away from them.
The lightning strike trail, nearly 10 meters high, reflected on Zhao Xu's face, making it pale for a moment, but his inner self remained calm, and he directly put back the thing he was about to take out.
The people around had never seen such a thick lightning bolt, and their faces turned pale with fear.
After the lightning disappeared, only the light smoke rising from the ground indicated the remaining power of the spell.
No one knew that there were at least 10 more to come.
At this time, the earth began to tremble, and the oak tree people around them began to move, marching towards them.
"Retreat, turn around," Roya quickly understood that the druid meant business, and quickly shouted, and the servants blew the agreed-upon whistle.
Zhao Xu, who had seen through the druid's plan, was not too worried, but he looked around and moved closer to the four players.
These people were not afraid of death, but it was uncertain about the surrounding servants. He did not want to be knocked down and trampled on innocently later.
The team in front of him consisted of Roya's handpicked followers, as well as brothers who had been through life and death with him. They relied on these core members to barely rally the remaining convoy to retreat.
"Stay close, it's okay, we won't be hit," Zhao Xu said to the four people who were somewhat nervous but still dutiful.
As he spoke, another lightning bolt struck from the sky.
But this time, it still did not hit anyone, and the oak tree people around them maintained their steady pace as they approached.
Here is the translation of the text:

At this moment, the four of them finally began to understand that Drui's magic was just a way to force them to leave without arguing. "It's extravagant to use such magic to chase people," said Warrior Maple Leaf, looking at Drui's expression with a tinge of longing.

Zhao Xu smiled, recalling his past life when he watched the wizard flying in the sky, using a plethora of magic to strike the enemy troops who were fleeing in disarray. He also remembered himself gazing up at the wizard with admiration, lamenting that he had missed his chance to learn magic.

The five of them ran for over a kilometer away from where Drui was standing before slowing down. The originally neat formation of the caravan had become disorganized, with fewer horses. Grey-headed and dirt-faced Luo Ya could only busy himself counting the people and didn't have time to care about Zhao Xu and the others.

"What's in this wagon?" Rainbow asked, her face flushing red after recovering from her exhaustion, as she began to inspect the goods on the wagon.

"Arms and materials for making arms," Zhao Xu whispered.

"Kasos and Buttan are planning to secede from the Northern Trade Alliance and engage in a fierce competition to strengthen their military," Zhao Xu quoted from a forum he had seen.

It wasn't to fight, but to arm themselves to the point where the alliance would find it unprofitable to fight.

"Magic master, how did we offend these Drui people by transporting arms?" Priest Maple Leaf asked, panting slightly, speaking slowly.

Zhao Xu was actually thinking of asking, but what's with the greeting style now?
Here is the translation:

However, he still restrained himself and answered patiently: "The main reason is that the two cities are producing military supplies, cutting down forests on a large scale to collect stone and wood, and slaughtering animals to collect their fur, which has enraged the druids. Therefore, the support for their actions is definitely cut off."

"It turns out that they're smuggling to Kasos and Buthan, and I thought I was heading to Mistra." Warrior Maple Leaf patted his own head and laughed loudly.

Zhou Xu looked at the cargo wagon and, at first, he deliberately created a fake watercourse with deep furrows, and from the recent situation, he guessed that this was a military supply. He also guessed that the destination of these materials was Kasos and Buthan.

Can Mistra itself produce various high-powered cannons and also transport military supplies to a town that has been destroyed by magic?
