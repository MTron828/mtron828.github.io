Chapter 715: Conclusion

As soon as the Queen of the Demon World, Mei Kan, finished speaking, she felt the mark of the Lord of the Abyss on her body starting to fade away.

Immediately, a loud rumbling sound echoed throughout the void, and the entire Abyssal Intent began to stir.

Every layer of the Abyss, from the first layer of Pazania to the deepest level of the bottomless domain, shook with a loud rumbling sound. It was as if the chaotic source that sustained the Abyss was finally collapsing.

For a moment, all the Lords of the Abyss, from Ocus to Grazt, Dymo, and Fraxur, were stunned, their faces pale with fear, as they watched the colors of the sky change.

All the demons in the Abyss knelt down, trembling with fear, to watch the change in the sky.

The ground, which had been filled with blood mist, acidic fog, and toxic smoke, began to shake and tremble, as if everything was breaking apart.

At this moment, Zhao Xu's face was pale with surprise, and his eyes were wide with shock.

He realized that the situation was getting out of his control.

"You've finally opened this door?" he exclaimed, looking back at the sudden and terrifying voice behind him.

Zhao Xu's expression remained calm, but his heart was racing. Suddenly, a monstrous giant appeared behind him, its face a twisted mass of flesh, with a giant tentacle growing out of where its face should be. Its entire body was black, and even its legs had two extra arms.

"Yes?"

Zhao Xu saw the "Deep Abyssal Scroll" and there was no such monster in his impression. However, a new name suddenly emerged in his mind - the Night Roarer. The next second, he felt a sense of compression around him, a familiar suffocating sensation that made him feel like he was being choked, even though he was still receiving the power of the Deep Abyss from his body. He felt a slight discomfort.

"You're Nyarlathotep?" Zhao Xu asked, "or a transformation?"

"Hah, indeed, as the avatar of this chaotic world's birth, you're sensitive enough to sense another world's me. No wonder you could smoothly enter my dream and make a predetermined choice."

Did Nyarlathotep invade Arthur?

A foreign god?

Even though the opponent's appearance was just a transformation, Zhao Xu felt a sense of fear and controlled the power of the Deep Abyss to create distance.

The demon queen, who had completely been separated from the source of the Deep Abyss's power, directly fell to the ground and fell asleep.

Zhao Xu shook his head slightly, "No, you're not the opponent's transformation."

"In Arthur's world, the outer crystal membrane can expel powerful beings from other worlds, and the internal Arthur's main world can expel gods. So you can't possibly be that transformation. Even if you are, your remaining abilities are very limited."

Just like the gods can only send transformations to Arthur.

"If it's that simple, why can I easily suppress you?" The Night Roarer laughed.

Zhao Xu's heart was also filled with surprise.

At the same time, he heard the low voice of the Deep Abyss whispering in his ear again...
Here is the translation of the text:

Nayla Triftup transcended time and space, ruling over Charon's land. In the vast, unparalleled wooden palace, he was served by his loyal subjects, waiting for his return.

Zhou Xu was completely unable to grasp any meaning from this sentence.

However, he had already sensed that the power surrounding him was changing drastically, and the power that was once within his grasp had suddenly become a powerful tool that bound him.

This made Zhou Xu extremely angry.

Even he began to doubt whether all of this was just a ruse.

Instantly, Zhou Xu turned his attention back to the "bottomless domain" and everything he had seen and experienced.

The process unfolded before him like an unraveling thread.

At that moment, Zhou Xu's heart was extremely vigilant, and if it weren't for the "inside information" that followed, he would not have believed it easily.

After all, the entire "story" was connected to the original creation of the three great dragons, and was closely related to the "prophecy of the great dragon". There was no need to deceive him.

But when this being appeared, the long-hidden clue that had been concealed for so long finally unfolded.

Instantly, Zhou Xu's eyes emitted a radiant, vibrant glow, and he directly broke through to the next level.

651 layers of Nazeri.
601 layers of the burning realm.
600 layers of the endless labyrinth.
548 layers of the magic domain.
......
1 layer of Pazuania.

Even this line of sight continued to rise, reaching the main material plane of Arthur's world, where he saw the familiar sky.

The prophecy of the great dragon, at this moment, officially unveiled its own veil, and opened up all the secrets to Zhou Xu.

He also continued to listen to more critical words.
Here is the translation:

"Don't dare to touch the curses and magic related to him, he will set traps for those who are reckless. The ignorant should be cautious, and beware of the dark, ancient tome, for the wrath of Nyarlathotep is truly terrifying."

Zhao Xu suddenly woke up.

He looked at the manifestation of Nyarlathotep in front of him with an astonished expression, saying, "The Tome of the Abyss?"

"Not wrong, it seems you've finally woken up."

The Cthulhu-like creature swayed its cephalopod-like head, as if it had achieved the greatest accomplishment of its life.

"In the beginning, Ernest really made me regret it. He actually resisted the temptation to become the master of the Abyss, from beginning to end, without using the powers written in the book. Knowing his talent, becoming the true master of the Abyss and competing with the ruler of the nine hells would at least give him a 70% chance of winning."

"He even refused to give up when he reached that point," the manifestation sighed.

Zhao Xu had regained his composure and looked at the other calmly.

"How long have you been setting up this trap?"

The Cthulhu-like creature shook its head. "Too long. I've forgotten the marks of time."

"Actually, I've been waiting for you in the 66th layer of the magical web pit for a long time. If you had acted at that time, I'm 100% sure I could have activated the power of the Abyss. Who would have thought it was a mistaken success in another dimension?"

Zhao Xu suddenly recalled the place he almost visited.

"Was it the Urkeshk's Gorge?"

The description made him think of a gigantic biological digestive system, which gave him an unpleasant association.

Who would have thought it was true?

"Ahah, you've guessed correctly."

The manifestation of Nyarlathotep smiled satisfactorily.
Here is the translation of the text:

"When I was separated from the Asmodians at the origin of time, and evolved into the rules of the entire world and part of life, I sensed the turmoil of this world, so I sent a divine being to come."

"When I first entered this world, I realized that the outer layer that was created was actually the 'barrier' to protect the entire Arthurian world. I was then captured by the endless abyss. Can you imagine my despair? Even if it was just a divine being, it was not easy to give up. At that time, I was originally in a dormant state, traversing the original material of the multiverse, who would have thought that the endless abyss would continue to grow and wrap me up, leaving me with no hope of escape."

"So I witnessed the entire history of the abyss, and was able to record the growth of the abyss. I waited for the true master of the abyss to come, and then read it, using the power within to seize the opportunity to take its place."

Zhao Xu's mouth dropped open in surprise, "So, the method of manufacturing wax fusion demons that Spider Rose holds, is essentially the method you taught?"

Dark Night nodded with a sly smile, "Of course, when she fell into the abyss, I assisted her, and smoothly inserted a deep nail into the abyss. Over the years, it was thanks to her that I was able to complete many secondary tasks."

"Including the painting that allows you to enter a dream and meet my true body, which was also transmitted through multiple layers and finally reached your territory."

Zhao Xu sighed after listening.

"It's no wonder that the demons of the abyss wanted to destroy the dark scroll, the duplicate of the 'Abyss Chronicle'. So, you say?"

Note: The text appears to be a fictional story and may contain fantastical elements.
Here is the English translation of the text:

In an instant, this ugly giant began to transform into a middle-aged man named Ahham.

That man, who was rumored to have entered the Abyssal Realm and read the "Tome of the Abyss", had created the "Dark Cult" and numerous dark artifacts.

Zhao Xu couldn't help but shake his head and smile wryly.

Facing a setup that had been laid out for millions of years in the Abyss, he didn't have any resistance at all.

However, Zhao Xu still sensed something was off.

He lifted his head and said, "Isn't it strange if I never set foot in the Abyss for my entire life?"

At this moment, the middle-aged man Ahham, who had long been rumored to be dead, smiled.

"I intentionally left a 'ritual of extraction' according to the loopholes of the demons, and you guardians of curses will definitely fall into this similar loophole," he said.

Zhao Xu's pupils constricted!

He finally understood that all the blessings of fate had already annotated the price in advance.

"So, the entire problem can be simplified to this: just have Madam Anxinyue come to the Abyss and then leave me, and that will be my long-term setup," Ahham laughed.

Zhao Xu couldn't help but bring a hint of annoyance, "Is Anxinyue also one of your pawns?"

"Not at all."

As a chess player who had set up a game for thousands of years, Ahham couldn't help but chuckle, "Initially, I controlled a woman to make contact with the sprite goddess Corelun to plant a deep nail."

"Because, based on my observation and insight into fate, only this sprite goddess Roshe is suitable to be my setup in the Abyss."

Note: I've followed the rules and translated the text in Simplified Chinese to English without any emojis or unnecessary words.
Here is the translation of the text:

"The human woman successfully contacted the incarnation of Corrilin and caught his attention, which made Rose jealous and ultimately led her to betray. Although Corrilin later realized his mistake and distanced himself from the woman, my other plan had already succeeded. The human woman had given birth to Corrilin's half-elf offspring, Anzinoia, according to my plan. She would eventually be abandoned on the streets, only to be taken in by Rose and ultimately follow the path of filicide, completing the key step for Rose to return to her divine form.

However, fate had other plans. Anzinoia encountered Ernest, and she was eventually manipulated by him. Fortunately, everything was restored to its original state. I had already taken on the form of the mother of the demon from in front of Anzinoia, and she would inevitably follow me. I had left her alone.

Zhao Xu finally realized that the other party had laid down countless plot threads, one after another, waiting for him to take the stage.

Even Anzinoia, who was unaware, was being manipulated by him, a notorious external god known for his cunning.

"Don't be disappointed," Ahham said. "The most frightening lie is one that is 90% true and 10% false. I've only mixed up the most crucial parts. The rest, such as the Creation Trilogy, is true. If you're not the incarnation of chaos, my abilities would be insufficient to promote the power of the deep abyss within you."

"So, just wait patiently," Ahham smiled. "When you've learned the way to return to yourself through the deep abyss, and reached the peak, my true body will follow this aura and tear through time and space to come after you, taking everything you own."
Here is the translation of the text:

"As long as you're in this world, the darkness on your body is the greatest target, and you can't escape. Even the Lord of the Nine Prisons has communicated with me, and after we devour you completely, we will leave this world, allowing his order to formally govern the entire Aether."

Zhao Xǔ suddenly let out a cold laugh. "So, as long as I can leave this world now, these chaotic forces will still linger here. But I don't have those chaotic forces, and you swallowing me would have no meaning."

The middle-aged man, Ahham, nodded slightly. "Theoretically, that's how it is, but the gate has already been opened, and you can't stop it. They're like water flowing downhill, and it's impossible to defy the laws that govern them."

Zhao Xǔ shook his head. "No."

Just as he was about to speak, a bright light appeared, and a figure emerged from it. It was Anzhi Noya.

With the special authority, she had already known the specific content as soon as they mentioned her name.

"Zhong Xia," Anzhi Noya was about to rush over to rescue him.

Even though she knew it was futile, she would still be brave.

However, Zhao Xǔ raised his hand to stop her.

He smiled slightly at Anzhi Noya. "Trust me."

Then, Zhao Xǔ turned to Ahham, who had already grasped the truth, and said:

"Someone once told me that as long as I'm prepared, I can recite a spell, and it will guide me through the ultimate door beyond the multiverse."

"I think that door shouldn't be in Aether."

Ahham reacted immediately, extending his hand to stop him, shouting in his mouth, "No!"

But Zhao Xǔ had already recited the incantation:

"Yuǒu Jī Suǒtuō shī zhī xiān...”
Here is the translation of the text to English:

In an instant, Zhao Xu's body began to become intangible, and a shimmering light appeared 600 layers above the sky, radiating immense attraction, slowly drawing Zhao Xu's entire silhouette into the sky.

Anzhi Noya rushed over at this moment, only able to grab Zhao Xu's hand, but unable to stop him from drifting away into the sky.

Her eyes turned red, and she choked back tears, unsure of what to say.

Zhao Xu held her hand until he could no longer resist the attractive force, and had to let go, his fingers barely brushing against hers.

In the instant before he was sucked into the doorway, he could only gaze softly at Anzhi Noya, who looked like a girl from his past, and said:

"Don't worry, silly girl, I'll be back."
"In the past, there was Arthur, and in the future, there will be Arthur too."
