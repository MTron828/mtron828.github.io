Chapter 631: Battlefield Command, Unlimited Buff Machine
"Is that the person with the long sword?"
"No mistake, it's that guy surrounded by a group of alpha players."
"Your face is big enough, have you secretly detected anything?"
"Ah, I've tried, and I'd say there are at least ten fools like me who get nothing, and I think he's added a detection-blocking spell, wasting my spell slot."
"Not that cautious, right?"
Players who followed Zhao Xu's hint arrived at a vast plaza underground.
The powerful undead creatures seemed to have sunk to the deepest part of the cave, with not a single one showing its head.
Occasionally, skeletal warriors and zombies would quickly be taken care of by the players.
At this point, numerous players followed, and this was their first chance to observe the rumors of "Midsummer".
Even the most cautious players were gazing at him with a calculating look.
However, the most curious thing about him was the equipment he wore.
Although detection magic couldn't scan his information, he wore a golden hourglass pendant, a starry cloak, a gemstone headband, a floating crystal on his forehead, a crimson red inner robe, and four colored Aethers on his head, as well as two shining rings on his fingers. The value of his external appearance alone was considerable.
Among the 12 magical equipment, only the armguard and outer armor were missing, leaving many people wondering what the items were.
After passing through, everyone had witnessed Zhongxia using magic multiple times, with all the items on his body being magical. "The headband with gems should be a thinking cap, but I'm not sure if it's level 2, 4, or 6," someone said. "The belt like a rope is probably a warrior's belt. It's strange that Zhongxia, a mage, wouldn't feel the magic and wouldn't be able to increase his defense level much even if he wore it."

At this moment, most of the strong existing players were standing in the square. Although these high-level players were gathered together, they couldn't detect how many magical items Zhongxia had on him.

Zhongxia was silently standing in the front, reviewing the contents of his mind about the "Devil's Device." He was planning to take the initiative to gather everyone here before activating the device, which might cause chaos in the entire underground cave. He was mentally counting down the time difference of the device's oscillation.

Just then, a cleric player asked, "Mr. Zhongxia, are we supposed to cooperate on something?"

The cleric player, standing behind Zhongxia, asked politely, but it still drew the attention of the people around Zhongxia, who seemed to be annoyed that Zhongxia was interrupted while thinking. The cleric player felt helpless.

Originally, he had planned to come and go quickly, but now he had wasted a day or two. Who knew what was happening outside? Especially in this underground cave, he felt a sense of suffocation and prayed for guidance. His divine magic was also weaker than usual. If he delayed any further, he didn't know what consequences he would face.
After hearing these words, Zhao X큰 directly activated his flight ability and floated up. The robe on his back was fluttering wildly in the wind blowing through the cave. "Everyone, gather together and form a radiation-style defense array!" he shouted from his lofty position, which required people to look up to see him.

Most of the players who could rush to the scene had already gathered here, while those who were farther away were temporarily unable to join. Although no one knew what Zhong Xia meant, the players instinctively rearranged their formation based on his intention.

Initially, the players who played as Arthur wanted to fight against powerful monsters, relying more on their formation advantages. They tried to take the least amount of damage while dealing the strongest blows.

As a result, various formations were gradually developed and continuously evolved. At this time, they were using the most widely spread radiation formation to counter the enemies coming from all directions.

"Now, our top priority is to find the exit 'teleport' door," Zhao X큰 said. "So, I will use the mysterious knowledge I obtained in this cave to activate a special skill. Then, the aura I release will attract undead creatures from the direction of the teleport door to attack us."

"So, we just need to advance in the direction of the undead creatures to slowly find the location of the exit teleport door," Zhao X큰 explained.

Zhao X큰 used magic to amplify his voice, covering the sound to reach the thousands of people around him.

"Therefore, in the process that follows, undead creatures will continuously attack us, and we need to work together to block their attacks and prevent them from breaking our formation."
Here is the translation of the text:

As Zhao Xu spoke with a resolute tone, "As long as I can hold out for the first few rounds, give me enough time to counterattack, and I'll wipe out the strongest monsters, so no one needs to worry about being worn out."

"I'll take the lead and stand at the forefront."

Zhao Xu's eyes were fixed on the group of players behind him, and he stood tall, as if defying the heavens.

"Good!"

"Let's follow your lead!" several players exclaimed in unison, their voices filled with excitement and enthusiasm, echoing Zhao Xu's words.

Suddenly, everyone started to murmur in agreement, with some nodding their heads and others following Zhao Xu's lead. Zhao Xu nodded in satisfaction.

Secrets cannot be shared with others, unless it's through voting. If a complex matter is discussed by many people, it will only lead to a waste of time and resources, making it difficult to achieve success.

So Zhao Xu didn't bother to consult with anyone, making his decision quickly.

As someone who has watched lectures on success, he knew that having a good plan is one thing, but what's more important is having a good team to execute it.

When he was silent, he had already used his "mind control" on a few players who were already standing by him, making them loudly support him when the plan was announced.

However, he didn't expect that only a third of the people he had "controlled" would actually follow him, and the rest would naturally agree with him.

His "reputation" had also been established.

"That's it, let's move out!"

As Zhao Xu spoke, his eyes turned solemn, and he slowly flew to the center of the team, where the players had already formed a tight formation, greatly reducing their original occupation of space.

And he was in the best position to respond to any situation.

"Light Dance!"
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu then deployed this zero-ring spell, and the four lantern-like light circles floated above the ground, following his will, hovering in front of him, guiding the team's direction.

Meanwhile, the thousands of players below also pulled out their weapons and held up their shields. The mages, priests, and druids, who were all skilled in magic, had also cast their spells to boost their own abilities before the battle.

According to Zhongxia's words, the upcoming battle was inevitable.

As Zhao Xu's spells had a long-lasting effect, his spells were all 24 hours long. For a 33-level mage like him, the 10-minute spell would last for 330 minutes. With the delay, it would be 660 minutes, or 11 hours. This meant that he could cast his spells twice a day, fully covering the entire day.

"Surveillance Net!"
A round of unparalleled surveillance magic, a forest spirit's blessing!

Zhao Xu had once used this spell during his collaboration with the "Watchers' Guild" outside Mistral City. At the time, his 2-level water magic had lifted the entire 40-person adventure team's surveillance value by 80 levels.

On the spot, they had crushed all the monsters in the surrounding forest area, achieving an unbeatable position.

This time, within a 6.5-meter radius, Zhao Xu effortlessly boosted the entire team's surveillance value by hundreds of levels.

The players suddenly exclaimed, gazing at their dynamic information panel and looking up at Zhongxia.

"This is amazing! The original forum post about boosting surveillance by 80 levels is true?"
"Is the big boss really the source?"

Zhongxia didn't even pause to explain, continuing to cast his divination spells - one-ring "Ominous Omen", two-ring "Divination", and four-ring "Prophecy" - to reveal the developments that would follow.
Here is the translation of the text:

These spells can all feedback with an accuracy rate of around 90% in the current level of the caster. When combined, the errors are even smaller, on the order of one in a thousand. However, the feedback is instantaneous, like a "prelude to a great battle" in terms of its sense of urgency.

The ominous signs indicate that "danger" is looming, and in the next hour, the caster will face a typical challenge in their adventure: moderately challenging monsters, treacherous traps, and other risks.

Zhou Xu is still a bit worried.

As for others, if they attempt to cast the spell, it will be a "greater crisis".

This means that players will face a serious threat, powerful enemy monsters, and potentially deadly traps.

The "Divination" feedback is a "good or evil" omen, which can bring both good and bad results. It looks like some people will die, but they will eventually find a way out.

The "Prophecy" will provide useful advice on the caster's actions, goals, or activities for the next week.

The general answers may be a simple phrase, a cryptic poem, or a prophecy.

At this moment, the feedback is a verse:

"A fearful spirit descends from the sky, an indestructible undead creature will emerge from the tomb, its burning red light fixed on the world through its dual pupils."

Zhou Xu's eyebrows slightly furrowed, but he quickly understood what the verse was referring to, without needing to ask for help from the "on-site audience".

Arthur didn't have any monsters that were truly indestructible, so this verse is pointing to the opponent's ability to revive themselves, with typical examples including ghosts and vampires.
Here is the translation:

The flames burning in the pupils refer to the soul fire of a skull-based being, which can also release a "fear aura", making it an immortal being - a warlock. The warlock's abilities are extremely high, with an unknown upper limit. However, the key is still "them". It's a bit nauseating.

One of the seven leaders of the wizarding association is a warlock who is not evil. The warlock's abilities are not something Zhao Xu takes seriously, and the opponent's ability to cast spells makes it a battle of magical prowess.

After half a minute, they still hadn't encountered a large group of immortal beings, while the team leaders of each small team were reminding their members to remain vigilant. Zhao Xu had completed the detailed battle plan for fighting the warlock during this time, thinking about whether to brief the others.

It was similar to when he went to fight the old witch. Zhao Xu had countered the opponent's various abilities and thought of various responses, so he was confident when he charged in.

He had ensured that his own side would not be killed by the first blow.

A complete battle plan is the fundamental reason why every fighting wizard can survive.

As they continued to move forward into the dark ahead, they began to feel that the road ahead was widening, and the formation had not changed significantly.

However, people's vigilance had not relaxed, and the larger the area, the more monstrous creatures would appear. They wouldn't believe that there were no giant insects or night shadows.

"There are monsters in the cave at 9 o'clock in the front!"

Suddenly, a player in the central area, supported by the "surveillance network", shouted loudly, drawing everyone's attention to that direction.
Here is the translation of the text:

In the dark void, suddenly countless "skeletons" burst forth, overflowing like a torrent, accompanied by an unstoppable momentum. Skeletons are essentially templates, but their strength depends solely on the number of life dice of the monster in front of them, and they can only reach a strength of around level 8. After seeing the skeletons, people feel slightly more at ease. Although everyone realizes that the team is still surrounded by monsters like the "Giant Skeleton" and the "Cloud Giant Skeleton", which are deadly, these skeletons are still just a group of skeletons, unlike the terrifying, unbeatable undead creatures that players have encountered before. The skeletons in front of the players immediately engage in close combat, and although they have only a few ribs, they wield steel shields and curved swords, and a single careless move can cause an arm to be dislocated. This kind of close combat is even more intense than street fighting. Because each skeleton is fearless and willing to sacrifice itself, it fills the role of a consumable item. Most players have not experienced this kind of battle, and even if they have, they have not had to fight with swords. A careless move could cause one's intestines to spill out. This is also the reason why the earth will suffer a huge loss during the initial outbreak of the undead tide. Zhao Xu also saw this scene and finally decided to make a solitary stand. Fortunately, players who have seen blood are now even more ruthless and fierce, and they immediately held their ground, preventing these skeletons from advancing to the rear. As a commander, one must consider not only the content of the battle, but also the entire logistical support and preparation before the battle.
If there's no preparation, we'll just have to make do when the time comes. Zhao Xu looked at the nearly thousand players gathering together, with many of them not having dark vision and relying on torches to barely illuminate the surroundings. However, as the vast number of skeletons surrounded them, slowly seeping into the formation of the players. The originally raised torches were pushed down to the ground, and the densely packed players had little room to maneuver.

Some players had already been mistakenly injured by not being able to see clearly and becoming disoriented. "Fatso, you chopped me!" "What's wrong with you, can't you see I'm retreating?" "Wait until we're done with this round, then I'll show you!"

In an instant, a few players' tempers flared up, and they began to curse loudly, even using key words and obscene language. Zhao Xu could only shake his head, wondering how these people couldn't learn to keep quiet and fight.

As the players began to get flustered, the sky above them suddenly echoed with Zhao Xu's loud voice again.

"War spell."
"Visual aid."
The war spell, as its name suggests, is suitable for war.

Even though Zhao Xu had to use his hidden potential to simulate the expertise of a war spell, he couldn't help but sigh in frustration.

The players who had been shouting and cursing just moments before suddenly returned to their original order. All players were surrounded by a "green light" designated by Zhao Xu during the spell, allowing each player to see the green light emanating from their teammates, even through the darkness and fog. This avoided mistakenly harming friends.

However, in reality, there was only the faint light of the torches below.

These green lights were just each person's illusion, allowing them to distinguish between friend and foe.
Here is the translation of the text:

Just like a fetter, some people are born with their hearts locked. Zhao Xu looked down at the intense scene below, but he didn't take the initiative to solve the skeletons, and instead thought about supporting the team.

If you want to manage, you have to train the team well.

Unconsciously, Zhao Xu had already taken the personnel below as his "subordinates" in the future.

"War Magic - Frenzied Combat." - Human Frenzied Battle Magic.
"War Magic - Revival." - Human Rapid Medical Treatment.
"War Magic - Light Wound Healing." - Human Status Recovery.
"War Magic - Magic Weaponization." - Human Magic Weapon.

...... As the glow of magic spells gradually fell on the land below, the thousands of players suddenly discovered.

How did they get stronger and stronger? When did these skeletons become as weak as chickens?
