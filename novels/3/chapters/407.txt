Chapter 408: The Secret of the Final Scroll

Mistra, Floating City.

The Truth Hall, the Highest Council Chamber.

Association President Os was sitting with his head bowed, deep in thought. He had just learned of everything that had happened outside the city.

He had sent Summer Sage to take over, and Summer Sage was conveniently nearby.

Queen Qingwei was silently sitting at the other end of the table, gazing at the tea cup with a faint haze in front of her, without making a sound.

From the moment she received the notification to come here, she had been waiting patiently.

Patience was a virtue that was never lacking in her.

Queen Qingwei was an outstanding representative of the Floating City's mage players.

In addition, she was charming and beautiful, and was always a popular figure.

However, even she, entering the Truth Hall, the highest authority institution of the Association, was an unprecedented event.

It was said that the seven members of the Council of the Association, who made most of the decisions for the Association, discussed and decided everything in this secret room.

"Madam Qingwei."

After a long time, President Os finally lifted his head and looked at the outstanding woman in front of him, regardless of her appearance or her innate talent.

Unfortunately, it was not meant to be. Someone had intervened in the fate lines of Mistra.

Normally, he should have arranged for the woman in front of him to take the mantle of Anniya, and then Anniya would hand over the lost heritage of the Itel Kingdom to her.

Subsequently, Queen Qingwei would use the power of this treasure to lead humanity on Earth to establish its own influence.

A ripple effect emerged in Wang Congwei's heart, causing her to feel surprised. She had not expected that Ous would not be the leader. Zhongxia said that Ous was a master of the secret arts, and Anzhi Noya was the successor. But did that mean that there were still roles that were not yet revealed? Wang Congwei's thoughts turned rapidly, and she soon revealed a gentle smile, looking at Ous and saying, "This is an honor."

"Very well, Lady Wang," Ous replied, nodding in satisfaction.

At this moment, he could tell that the woman before him was sincere and genuine without needing to use any magic.

"Perhaps you already know your unique abilities?" Ous said, suddenly changing the topic.

"Yes, leadership," Wang Congwei replied.

"That's correct," Ous said. "I hope you will use this ability well. Or, rather, I have the ability and I can occupy this position, and it has nothing to do with it."

Ous smiled and handed Wang Congwei a thick book. "You already have the training methods, and I won't elaborate further. As for this, it's my experience and understanding over the years. You can refer to it when you have the time."

Wang Congwei thanked Ous politely and accepted the gift.

"Oh, by the way, we have a rule for the final scroll," Ous said, smiling as if he had thought of something amusing.

He looked at Wang Congwei, who seemed puzzled, and laughed, his wrinkles deepening.

"Don't be puzzled," he said, "Zhongxia doesn't know this because he would definitely waste the opportunity. But you're different."

"Only the members who have signed the contract can break the seal of secrecy," Ous said, speaking in a complex manner, trusting that Wang Congwei would understand.
As he had expected, at this moment, Wang Ningwei's eyes were slowly shining as if they were glowing.

Instantly, she raised her head and said, "The secret to becoming a god is in the final scroll. It's actually a move that puts the legendary mages who are closest to becoming gods in charge of guarding it. Isn't that inviting trouble?"

"Yes, you've noticed it too."

At this point, Os also stood up and walked to the mysterious golem that had been standing silently in the secret room. "Jacques, I am now breaking the protection order of Article 16 based on the exemption limit of the Final Scroll Convention. Take note of it."

The golem, already inspired with intelligence, immediately responded, "Received, Jacques has taken note."

"Then I will start reviewing the segment that was just noted. Requesting interpretation," President Os suddenly added another circle.

At this point, the golem Jacques hesitated for a moment, then immediately accessed his memory and said, "Members who join the final scroll are backup candidates for reading the final scroll. And once they reach the legendary mage stage, they can leave the virtual space and read the text of the scroll directly."

"Once they read it, they may come across the secret to becoming a god."

"Or, it could be said that every member of the final scroll organization is a candidate for the chief god of magic, able to fill the position in a timely manner when the three generations of magic goddesses fall."

Even Wang Ningwei, who was usually very calm, couldn't help but open her mouth slightly in surprise at this secret.

The Final Scroll organization actually aimed to become the chief god of magic, even though it would require the fall of the powerful goddess Siservina.

But the previous two magic goddesses were both unbelievably powerful, completely beyond comparison.

At this moment, Os suddenly said a witty remark, "The magic main god is doomed to fall. This is also the reason why Ernest didn't let Annyia take on this position back then."

"However, Madam Wang Qingwei, I must seriously tell you and request that you not reveal the final content to Summer the wizard."
"Because this will lead to unpredictable results."
"Okay." Madam Wang Qingwei nodded seriously at Os, even though she didn't seem to care that he had addressed her by her full name.

"Then, Madam Wang Qingwei," Os suddenly seemed curious, turning his head to look at Madam Wang Qingwei, "Did you ever find a statue of wizards and priests on the stairs, and simultaneously receive letters of recommendation from both wizards and priests?"

"But when you arrived in Mistral, you realized that with both letters of recommendation, you directly obtained the promotion to the hidden foundation profession, 'Tome Scholar'."

"Just as you were leaving, Summer the wizard arrived shortly after. So, I'd like to ask, why did you give up on being a Tome Scholar afterwards?"

At this point, Madam Wang Qingwei looked puzzled, "Chairman Os, I think the background of Tome Scholar is like a horror world type, and I didn't feel it was suitable for a girl like me."

"Good." Chairman Os suddenly seemed enlightened, and couldn't help but burst out laughing.

After a while, he regained his composure, looked at Madam Wang Qingwei with a benevolent expression, and said, "Madam Wang Qingwei, your 'Super Curse' upgrade has been approved."

"Although you don't have Summer's dual elite profession, your self-awakened 'potential points' ability in the game, combined with this upgrade, will cause massive destruction to Arthur's balance."

"I hope you can use this profession ability wisely."
