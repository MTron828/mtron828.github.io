Chapter 264: Returning to the Church

The "Larx" that had attached itself to Zhao Xu's hand suddenly felt the changes in Zhao Xu's leveling up.

This sudden breakthrough, even for a being with millions of years of experience like Larx, was difficult to understand.

If Zhao Xu had leveled up to level 5 when he touched the portal, that would not be surprising.

But he had leveled up directly and quietly, with a sense of absolute confidence.

Larx couldn't help but take a look at this old, dilapidated house, but it didn't seem to have any extraordinary features, not even the cobwebs in the corners or the cracked blue bricks on the floor.

Even if it weren't for the portal appearing here, Larx would never have paid attention to this ordinary, old, and dilapidated house.

At this moment, Zhao Xu was clear about how he had leveled up.

After the first time he used the "Unbridled Hero's Aura" spell, he gained 1 point of automatic recovery potential per round.

This extraordinary ability had begun to affect his reality, giving him some similar characteristics.

That night, after touching the bronze mirror and encountering one of the deep-sea monarchs, the demon Gralt, Zhao Xu felt the "Deep-sea Divine Power" emanating from him and began to synchronize his attributes in the real world.

This also gave him real intelligence corresponding to his in-game attributes.

With the ability of a wise and learned mage, Zhao Xu was constantly reviewing the spell structures he had learned.

The foundation of a 4th-level mage was being solidified constantly.
So when Zhao Xu gazed upon the house he had lived in before, he suddenly felt the intense vitality he had experienced as a 5th-level warrior. With his foundation solidified and his skills honed over the past few days, he instantly broke through the 4th-level barrier and reached the 5th level.

At this moment, Zhao Xu closed his eyes and began to survey the abilities he could acquire as a 5th-level character. He naturally obtained enhancements to his life value, immunity, and skill points. In particular, his intelligence-based skills gained a significant boost, with his 22 intelligence increasing to 6 points.

His occupational line, the mage profession, would formally become a 5th-level mage after mastering the three-ring spell. As a 5th-level mage, he would also acquire an additional "super specialty" ability.

As for his occupational line two, Zhao Xu would become a 1st-level pastor/4th-level scroll scholar. This would grant him the 4th-level ability "Heart Like a Still Pond" from the scroll scholar profession, allowing him to gain a 2-level enhancement in dodging against control-type spells.

However, these were not the most crucial aspects. The most critical thing was that Zhao Xu, as a 5th-level mage, had obtained the three-ring spell. From this point on, he could learn a series of powerful spells.

These spells included "Debuff Removal", which could dispel an opponent's buffs; "Shadow Steed", which could summon a faster mount; "Miasmic Cloud", a group debuff spell; "Eagle Eye" and "Sharp Ear", scouting spells; "Suggestion", a control spell; "Wind Wall", a counter to remote attacks; "Acceleration", a comprehensive enhancement spell; "Flight", which could open up a third-dimensional battlefield; and "Transmutation", an escape technique.
Even the renowned "Fireball" spell, which is considered one of the strongest spells in the three rings, cannot be said to be the strongest spell in the three rings. This is because warriors can also output damage. However, warriors cannot achieve the same effect as the vast majority of three-ring spells.

"Let's head back to the battlefield and take a look?" Lark asked.

Zhao Xu shook his head, saying, "With the blessings of the gods, if we can't even win, let alone the players, then we can't even withstand the pressure of Winter City in the future."

In the past, he had to make vague judgments based on his experience. However, with his non-ordinary memory and thinking abilities, he instantly grasped the entire political landscape of the Northern Alliance.

So, he just waited silently as the players fought to break through the town's defenses around the Star Lake. By now, that was no longer a difficult task.

"That's it, master," Lark exclaimed, "Let's hurry back to Mistral and learn three-ring spells, then launch an attack on the god of death's monument!"

At this moment, she seemed to have seen the shadow of Zhao Xu's ascension to godhood.

"Lark, we still have to tidy up some loose ends," Zhao Xu smiled and comforted himself.

As he spoke, he directly simulated the "Teleportation" spell and instantly disappeared from view, reappearing in front of the "Magic Goddess" temple in Winter City.

Zhao Xu raised his head, looking at the temple that had been renovated after the "Archbishop of Sos" took office.

Then he smiled silently and walked straight into the temple, bypassing the crowd in front of him.

"How is it that there are so many people in Xylivia's temple in the Northern Alliance?" Lark asked curiously.

Compared to the developed magical civilization in the south, this barren and cold land on the northern continent was more inclined to worship war gods and gods of justice.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

The divine being with courage and integrity is more likely to receive recognition from the spirits of this land. "Hello, please go to the left-hand church for today's prayer ceremony," he said, and then a nun saw him walking towards the back of the church and hurriedly approached him to stop him. Zhaoxu took out the sacred emblem from his chest and said, "I'm looking for the bishop, please pass on the message."

The nun, who was from the Arthur family and had just entered the church due to her family connection, was taken aback by the emblem. "The holy emblem of the goddess indicates that I am a pastor," Zhaoxu said, seeing that the other party didn't react. Suddenly, the emblem in his hand emitted a warm holy light that directly illuminated the nun's face.

"You're being a bit too extravagant, master," Lark said. "I don't have the leisure for this," Zhaoxu replied. "It seems to be a special feeling in the goddess's church."

Generally speaking, pastors prove their identity by using their inner light and activating the emblem with the "dispelling of undead creatures" ability.

Zhaoxu had done the same thing in the past in front of "Rayan" and "Sosis".

At this moment, a novice pastor saw the scene and hurried over to rebuke the nun: "This one is also a pastor of the goddess. Why didn't you invite him to sit down first instead of letting others waste their energy activating the emblem?"

The middle-aged novice pastor turned to Zhaoxu and asked, "Goddess above, I am Somaqi. What do you need us to cooperate with?"

"I'd like to see the bishop of Sosis," Zhaoxu said.
Here is the translation of the text:

At this moment, the novice pastor responsible for receiving guests in the hall frowned and said, "The Archbishop of Sos has been busy receiving dignitaries from Winter City and the Northern Alliance in recent days, and it's unlikely that he will have the time to see us now."

As he spoke, he awkwardly looked at Zhao Xu. As a rule, any pastor who visits Winter City is familiar with the Archbishop's schedule.

In this situation, it would be difficult for the Archbishop to see us quickly.

"You can show him this holy badge and pass on the message," Zhao Xu said.

At this moment, the Archbishop's holy badge, which was worn by the novice pastor, was far more effective than Zhao Xu's certificate of pastoral care.

"Okay," the middle-aged pastor, Soma Qi, took the badge from Zhao Xu and suddenly widened his eyes, almost dropping it. The badge was made of an ancient material, which left a deep impression on Soma Qi.

The badge had undergone a complete transformation, with a new emblem of a bishop's level, represented by a purple flower cluster.

Soma Qi immediately closed his mouth, retracting all his suspicious words. He hastily turned around and rushed towards the back of the hall, towards the sanctuary.

He knew that the Archbishop of Sos was currently holding a meeting with the lord of Winter City and the Northern Alliance had sent a special envoy. The sudden appearance of the goddess in the Star Lake, which provided a revival temple for players, had caused a stir among the high-ranking officials of Winter City.

It was believed that the goddess and her high-ranking officials, including the goddess herself, had a special understanding of the "Star Lake," which is why such a big wave had arrived today.
At this moment, the nun wanted to ask Zhao Xu to sit down first because it would take some time for the transmission to complete, at least until the ceremony was finished.

However, just as the nun finished speaking, she saw the middle-aged deacon hurrying towards Zhao Xu with his head bowed.

At this point, the deacon stopped in front of Zhao Xu and assumed a humble posture, just like during morning prayer.

The deacon was about to say something, but he noticed the many people present and quickly swallowed the words back.

The deacon bowed respectfully to Zhao Xu and said, "May I trouble you to move to the VIP room at the back, where the Grand Master of the Cathedral is waiting for your arrival."

The middle-aged man was still recalling the recent events.

According to the deacon's previous statement, it was the "Fallen Angel" who had come.

Just then, a newsboy burst into the church, half-panting and said, "Suddenly, a large number of Frost Giants, their wolves, giant demons, and mountain giants, as well as fire giants, have appeared in front of Star Lake, but they were all defeated by the players."

For a moment, the people in the church looked at each other in disbelief, about to scold the child who dared to lie in the Goddess Church.

The noble merchants who had come to perform the prayer ceremony knew the difference between the players and the Frost Giants.

The newsboy glanced at the people present and quickly explained, "It's because the players on the plain suddenly received the blessing of the Goddess's 15 divine arts!"
