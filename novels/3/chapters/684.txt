Chapter 685: The City with Intelligent Infrastructure

The group of wizards is likely to be the most fond of feinting and then striking. In general, wizards participating in battles, especially those in a dueling arena, usually shout out "spell names" that are not actually related to the spells they are casting. They often shout "Fireball" but are actually using it to escape by transforming their bodies into a state of spiritual clarity.

There are very few people who can honestly shout out the names of their spells, making it difficult for their enemies to identify the spells. However, people who do this usually do not live long. However, Zhao Xu is a strong warrior who can strike with a sword. However, in this instant, he first casts a one-ring spell called "Outmaneuvering the Enemy"!

Zhao Xu's "Super Magical Control" ability allows him to disrupt the entire "Super Magical System". However, there is one thing that is difficult to make up for, and that is that this ability requires more time than usual. Therefore, he cannot activate his "Super Magical Control" to truly cast a spell in an instant. Most of the time, he relies on the "High-Ranking Super Magical Staff" in his hand.

However, at this moment, Zhao Xu still has enough energy to cast a one-ring spell, "Outmaneuvering the Enemy", and successfully cast it. This is also one of the few times he has used a high-ring spell to cast a low-ring spell.

In an instant, a flash of insight that is difficult to perceive appears in Zhao Xu's eyes, and he gains a profound and unparalleled level of intuition. He is able to sense the perfect timing for a perfect attack.

Within the next 6 seconds, his attack power increases by 20 levels!

The kind of advantage brought by the enemy-destroying law, even for a dual-attribute wielder, is that it can deal significant damage. However, the attack duration is too short, making it difficult to maintain a full-ranged attack. Therefore, its value for money is not high. Even if it can be instant-cast, it would require a low-level instant-casting wand and consideration of switching weapons. As a result, this spell has always been like a beautiful moon in the water, attracting followers who strive to perfect it. However, only a few can truly master it.

Zhao Xu's actions did not pause for a moment, and even after the spell was completed, he unleashed all his luck points without hesitation. Therefore, his sword attack was silent, but its power had already exceeded 70 levels! It's not just about defeating an opponent, but also preventing physical damage. If the opponent is truly strong, he would activate his defensive ability without hesitation and unleash the fully charged seven-cut attack in an instant.

However, as Zhao Xu's sword struck, he suddenly heard a sound in his ear, and it disappeared in an instant! Has he been deceived by his own trick and ended up blinded by his own trap? He had stabbed empty air.

The illusionary skill "phantom sound" of a zero-ring mage can create a loud and piercing sound. It can be strong or weak, near or far, and can be used to lure away a tiger from a mountain. Even when the skill is leveled up, it can create a sound that resembles a conversation or singing among nearly 20 people. This skill is deeply loved by bards.

Therefore, Zhao Xu never ignores the existence of "illusion" when facing an ordinary mage. However, it's rare to see a monster using illusionary skills. Is it a monster with a part-time job?
Here is the translation of the text:

In Zhao Xu's mind, he had brushed over the common monster groups in the wilderness, but no matter how many times he thought about it, he couldn't find any matching ones, and he couldn't help but wonder quietly to himself.

"I said, I can fulfill your wish," the mysterious low voice suddenly switched to his left ear, and his voice rose a few decibels, full of pride.

"Whoosh!"

In an instant, Zhao Xu was like a flash of lightning, his sword flashing so fast that even a thunderbolt would be cut off!

There was no one!

He didn't even play around?

Not even a dwarf illusionist would be able to withstand his attack!

Zhao Xu slightly smiled coldly and then used the "Voting" law, the Five-Ring "True Knowledge" art.

One breath broke a thousand laws.

All kinds of illusions were defeated by Zhao Xu's "True Knowledge" art.

"Don't get excited."

The next second, the voice came from in front of Zhao Xu's forehead, as if there was an invisible horn hidden there, mocking him directly.

Hehe.

If the opponent was still hiding in the shadows and using angles to conceal himself, he would certainly continue to speculate, but by suddenly jumping out, he had actually revealed his biggest trump card.

At this moment, Zhao Xu silently turned his head, as if observing a celestial wonder, and gazed at the vast and lofty "Black Stone Hall".

"Revitalize the city?"

Zhao Xu spat out the name of a mysterious spell.

In an instant, a loud explosion erupted in the air, as if the air around him was already filled with high-concentration gas, and then suddenly ignited.

Zhao Xu flashed and jumped to the wall edge, his long sword trembling slightly, looking contemptuously at the front.

"Has it been exposed? Get angry then?"

At the same time, he searched for knowledge about "Revitalizing the City" in his mind, reorganizing it bit by bit, and condensing it into a single point.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Not, you're wrong,"

At this moment, the distant voice became somewhat cold and detached.

"The great me, how could I be constructed by a mere nine-ring spell?"

"Or, I'm far more terrifying and unpredictable than you imagined."

As Zhao Xu spoke, he noticed that the wall behind him began to hum, and the path he had just taken and the path he was about to take had suddenly disappeared, already sealed off.

 Zhao Xu's attention was divided, and he became trapped in this enclosed space.

"Activate the city" is not an arcane art, but rather a nine-ring spell in the city domain.

Therefore, unless a pastor has chosen the "city" domain, it is impossible to cast this spell.

This spell may seem ordinary, but it can activate buildings and urban structures within a range of several dozen meters to attack enemies.

It's like a giant, self-propelled, activated city.

Moreover, the damage caused by an activated city is generally insignificant, but it can ignore any form of concealment.

What's more, an activated city is indestructible and cannot be dispelled.

But Zhao Xu had never heard of the "Activate the City" spell, and he could also manipulate the walls manually.

Zhao Xu brought a hint of confusion and sarcastic tone, but it didn't stop, "You think there's no door, you can block a wizard's departure?"

"You can try it."

As soon as the voice fell silent, the walls on both sides of the corridor began to compress towards Zhao Xu's direction.

Listening to the rumbling sound of the walls moving, it was as if the prey trapped inside would soon be crushed into a meat paste, with a gruesome death.
Here is the translation of the text:

However, Zhao Xū is definitely not worried at all.

He might be accompanied by two young girls, but he would first need to avoid the enemy's attack.

But now that he's alone and single, he's not without the means to transform into a ghostly body. He still has the "Spectral Transformation" spellbook with seven rings, and he can still get it out.

Not to mention, he can even transform into a gas.

As Zhao Xū's magical abilities increase, his techniques multiply exponentially.

He can easily push his limits to the very end.

Zhao Xū also has a moment of excitement. If he were to directly teleport away, that would be a sign of cowardice.

He doesn't need to use the "Destroy" technique to forcefully carve out a small path here.

He likes to use the same technique as others to counter them.

Is he really over 50 points of strength? The mythical strongman's strength is probably only half of his.

At this time, Zhao Xū is only about 1.8 meters tall, but he can easily bear the weight of dozens of tons.

Zhao Xū sneers and then directly unleashes all his strength with a loud shout!

However, just as Zhao Xū is about to unleash his strength, his face suddenly turns pale!

This is not even in the same league!
It's not the other side, but him!

Zhao Xū easily reacts to this, and there's a gap of at least 50 points of strength difference!

"Ha ha, do you know how scary I am now? You really think that as a city created by Ernest, I wouldn't have any cards up my sleeve?"
