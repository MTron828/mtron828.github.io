Chapter 584: Evil Dragon Burns the City

At this moment, Zhao Xu heard An Ti Noya's words, "What kind of man are you?", and his entire being was still in a state of shock. His consciousness was suddenly drawn into the powerful gravitational vortex, and his thoughts and spiritual soul became sluggish.

The script is wrong!

Zhao Xu suddenly realized this and felt as if he was being controlled by An Ti Noya's consciousness, reading memories like a puppet on strings.

This inverted sense of disorientation made it impossible for him to come up with any effective plan.

The next moment, he fainted.

Just as Zhao Xu fell to the ground, a woman with a pointed hat, once familiar to him, emerged from the shadows behind the high tower. She opened her arms and supported him.

This was May, the first pastor of Ernest and a woman with whom Zhao Xu had a past connection. May was followed by Saint Warrior Viola, who slightly lowered her noble head, hiding her modest and lovely face.

"An Ti Noya, I told you not to take risks before the true opportunity arrives," May said with a hint of annoyance.

As she spoke, the high tower seemed to produce a thunderous sound.

"You know why you represent the Mage Association?" May said, looking at An Ti Noya with a stern expression.

"You are representing the continuation of Arthur's magical civilization. Before becoming a legendary mage, your impulsive opening of memories will lead to unpredictable consequences, unknown to anyone!"

"The master entrusted you with the final scroll, as if it had been absorbed into your memories!"

At this moment, May is also a significant time, the first time May has shown such anger towards Anniya.

"This time involves something crucial!"

"May, I know," Anniya said calmly, without a hint of excitement or the intention to defend herself.

"My memories are not just memories; they may connect the present to the real history, allowing us to change the past. I think it's worth it, and I can bear this risk."

"Because I know more about how he disappeared than you do."

Suddenly, thunder echoed again, and a rainstorm began to pour down from the sky.

May frowned slightly as he watched this scene unfold: "This change is already happening. What stage has he reached in your memories?"

Anniya also looked confused, muttering to herself, "Can't be..."

"...Run, the evil dragon is coming, disaster is coming!"

A frantic-looking person shouted as he ran into the originally peaceful fields.

It was raining lightly in the sky.

The fields, filled with hope, were filled with farmers who had been cultivating the golden wheat for half a year. They were all waving their sickles, harvesting the wheat beneath their feet.

Although a well-crafted sickle costs 6 gold coins at the blacksmith's shop, it plays a crucial role in farming and can be used to defend against thieves when necessary. Therefore, every household in this rural area has one.
Here is the translation of the text:

As the sound of someone's loud shouting could be heard, the faces of these farmers turned pale, and the rusted tools in their hands seemed to tremble. Even the sickle that had been passed down through generations couldn't be grasped tightly and fell to the ground.

Just as one of the farmers bent down to pick up the sickle, he heard a distant, mournful dragon's cry!

The farmer's silhouette was far away, and fear had already reached its peak.

Suddenly, a massive black shadow swooped down from above, and most of the farmers fell to the ground unconscious.

The messenger who had come to report the news kept shouting and ran towards the town gate with his legs pumping furiously. Just as he was about to reach the gate, he finally let out his last sentence of his life: "Run, the evil giant dragon is coming!"

In the next instant, his body was lifted up by claws and swallowed by the dragon's stomach.

"Cut the bridge rope!" The town guards, who had been celebrating the summer harvest, finally reacted with terror.

The urgent alarm sounded, shattering the joyous atmosphere and igniting the fear in everyone's heart.

In an instant, the town, which had been preparing for the possible arrival of orcs and goblins, sprang into action. Archers drew out their makeshift bows made of birch wood, and warriors took out their giant swords from their homes, ready to face the enemy.

However, as the dragon's wings beat the air, accompanied by thunderous roars and the sounds of screams and wailing children, and amidst the lonely old people's prayer rituals...

The evil red dragon easily crossed the town's moat and the ripples on the surface. It spread its massive wings, which could block out the sun, and faced a hail of arrows that had originally been aimed at distant orc neighbors.
Here is the translation of the text:

The red dragon that has descended upon this small town is not a freshly hatched young dragon, but rather a dragon with scales that have turned a deep red with age and have become as hard as metal. Its neck and wing edges have been worn smooth and have turned a purple-gray color. The dragon's eyes seem like a glowing ball of molten lava, radiating fiery light.

As the arrow rain approaches, the dragon opens its massive jaws and spews out flames, as if it has been storing up a vast amount of fuel inside. The flames shoot out!

The dragon's emblem, representing its fire-breathing abilities, suddenly sets the area in front of it ablaze, and the arrows shot at the dragon's scales are shattered and destroyed. The flames then spread out and become a firestorm, scattering sparks and embers everywhere.

The people defending against the dragon are enraged and feel a sense of despair. They realize that their arrows are no match for the dragon's scales, which are as unyielding as rock. Even the bravest warriors are shaken and fall to the ground.

In the face of this mythical creature, ancient humans reveal their vulnerable side.

However, the enraged red dragon does not relent. It unleashes its fire-breathing abilities, imbuing the area with fiery energy and conjuring up a rain of sparks. The wooden buildings and stone towers on the ground begin to rise up as golden, fiery pillars.
Here is the translation of the text:

Countless people wailed in the flames, but those who were thinking of defending against the beastmen were not prepared with water buckets to put out the fire. They relied on the water brought by hand to extinguish the spreading fire in the town, but it was of no use.

The houses in the town were burning in the high-temperature fire, one by one collapsing, as if celebrating the harvest festival with the heavenly flames. The people began to run out of the houses with dirty faces, as if the moat surrounding the town was the only way to survive. The crying and wailing echoed along the crowded escape route.

The town, which had taken a century to build, finally became a ruin.

Standing hundreds of meters outside, Zhao Xu was silently watching all this. He had just been suspected of being a spy by the town and refused entry a moment ago. But he didn't care. He didn't even bother to use his shape-shifting or hypnotic powers to manipulate time. He was just about to adjust the time observation again.

In this memory of Ansilvund, he always had a sense of unexpected calmness, although he didn't understand why he had entered Ansilvund's memory as if he had really entered a world.

The only mark he left behind was the wristwatch tied to his wrist.

He lightly adjusted the century-representing pointer on the watch face.

In an instant, he saw the desolate land that had been cultivated by generations of people, eventually forming a small town with some bottom. However, the town was suddenly destroyed by a malevolent dragon that had suddenly appeared.

The world is unpredictable.

This made Zhao Xu, who had once felt the same pain, sigh with a hint of sadness.

Perhaps when the town was destroyed by the malevolent black dragon, it was the same scene.

"Dad, Mom..."
Suddenly, a faint, childish, and painful cry echoed from behind Zhao Xu.
He turned his head in surprise, only to find a petite girl with a refined and adorable appearance standing behind him. She was accompanied by a servant holding a bouquet of fresh flowers, clearly a young lady from a wealthy family who had just returned from a picnic. Zhao Xu's heart, which had just begun to lift, sank again.

This was not Anniya.

The two servants who had been guarding him were staring blankly at the small town that had been reduced to ashes, their legs trembling with fear.

"Dad, Mom!" the girl exclaimed, and then ran towards the ruins of the small town that had been burned to ashes, her eyes wide with disbelief.

At this moment, the giant dragon was using its fire magic to slowly kill the people who had jumped into the river.

But Zhao Xu just shook his head. With the "Secret Eye" magic he had just used, he had observed that the rich district in the town center had been attacked, and it was impossible for anyone to reach the riverbank.

He knew that this was all part of the established reality, just a memory from Anniya's past that he could not change.

He watched as the girl ran towards the city moat, her small legs moving rapidly.

"Roar!"

The giant dragon turned its gaze towards the girl, its eyes blazing with a ruthless glint.

The dragon's fiery breath, which had cooled down earlier, began to build up again, and the dragon's mouth started to accumulate a terrifying and high-temperature fire energy. The deadly breath was about to descend upon the earth once more, drying up the river.

Zhao Xu watched as the girl continued to run, unaware that death was closing in on her.

Although he knew that he could not change the history of this scene, he shook his head again.

"I swear, this is the last time I'll interfere."
