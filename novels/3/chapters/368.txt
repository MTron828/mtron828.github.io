Chapter 369: Decree

As Zhao Xiu saw these cavalrymen approaching, he barely nodded slightly and responded with a faint hum, without saying another word, and directly rode his horse straight into the mansion surrounded by flames.

The entire town was in an abnormal state at that moment, but the streets were eerily quiet. Occasionally, a window would quietly open and shut, with someone peeking out and then quickly closing it again.

This had clearly divided the town into two worlds.

Or, to put it another way, the residents of the town had grown accustomed to such "special" treatment.

Just a few steps later, Zhao Xiu approached the mansion surrounded by flames, but what surprised him was that a large number of wooden crates were neatly arranged on the empty lot, being packed and prepared to be loaded onto carts.

Meanwhile, there was no one fleeing the fire in the area, only the cavalrymen, who were brandishing their swords with frosty glint, forcing the laborers to work.

Zhao Xiu couldn't believe how quickly everything had unfolded.

The auction house hadn't even had a chance to organize any effective countermeasures before it was completely packed and prepared.

"Just what I expected," a man in his mid-years said to Zhao Xiu, standing beside him. "These residents have been so intimidated by that monster that they've taken it to this extreme. It's saved us the trouble of sealing off the surrounding area."

The man's appearance was similar to Zhao Xiu's current appearance, but with a more aged look, and he was accompanied by two or three wizards behind him.

It was clear what was going on - the man was likely the brother of the young noble from the capital and the mastermind behind this operation.
Here is the translation of the text:

"It's not a mistake." Zhao Xu guessed that their usual relationship was not close, but from the way this old man could start talking from a distance, he judged that it wouldn't be too bad and probably wouldn't involve something ridiculous like a dispute over inheritance.

"Hmph, that lucky guy, he just got hold of the 'treasure' left behind by that imperishable being, and the entire Floating City is now keeping a safe distance from him, not daring to stir up trouble. In my opinion, it's really ridiculous." The old man sneered.

Just then, the butler who was following them hurriedly spoke up, saying, "Young master, please be careful with your words."

As the butler glanced around nervously, he leaned in and whispered lowly, "The late Emperor left behind a legacy that even gods have been secretly plotting to destroy. Therefore, before we can determine whether this is a coincidence or fate's arrangement, the Floating City's attitude towards that person is to keep a respectful distance."

The two other magicians who were following behind them overheard this and couldn't help but listen intently. It was only in this situation that they could touch on the intricate web of intrigue in the Mistral region and understand how the big shots operate.

At this point, Zhao Xu had roughly understood the situation.

"Hmph, I think that if we can get our hands on that treasure, nothing big will happen, but as for that kind of person, they're just turning some hopeless women who died with hatred into vengeful spirits, which is really petty and annoying from head to toe."

After hearing this, Zhao Xu combined it with the legend of "Old Witch" from Frosty Town and had a rough understanding.

The multiple "Old Witches" that emerged in Frosty Town were clearly artificially created.

He also reacted to the meaning of the nursery rhyme "Red Bride" that he had heard before.

Just then, the old soldier in the tavern mentioned that in this place, there is no tradition of wearing red wedding clothes, unlike on Earth.
Here is the translation of the text:

This implies that the red-clothed person is actually stained with blood, and the high mountains and lakes may be where someone was stoned to death and their bodies were thrown into the lake.

The sentence about wearing white and following footsteps is actually describing a story about a girl who died and became a vengeful spirit, which is why there are mentions of being taken away and having dreams, all of which fit with the vengeful spirit's ability to invade people's dreams.

So, before he arrived in Mistral, he saw the lamb tied up, which was actually a gesture of "pleading for mercy" to a certain vengeful spirit.

The vengeful spirits in Snowfall Town are all created by someone who has obtained a "mysterious treasure".

However, Floating City is hesitant to intervene in Snowfall Town due to the origin of the "treasure".

Zhao Xu immediately decided to advise the middle-aged woman to stay in Mistral.

The vengeful spirits in Snowfall Town are powerful enough, and it's not something a 6th-level mage like him can intervene in.

It's like a certain legend where most behind-the-scenes monsters were slightly punished and then recruited back to heaven, and those without connections were beaten to death.

It's obvious that these "vengeful spirits" have such connections.

At this time, the beams in the house were burning fiercely, and the sound of collapse began to echo, and even bursts of flames shot up into the sky, illuminating the peaceful night sky of Snowfall Town.

As the young man in the traditional Chinese dress gazed at the scene before him, he suddenly turned to Zhao Xu and said, "You just said you were going to the bar to unwind, but don't forget that Mr. Carly is like our clan uncle, and he's a five-ring wizard, so you can't treat him like a common person."

Just then, a horse-drawn carriage, which was not properly secured, suddenly lost a wheel when it started moving, and the carriage rolled towards the crowd.

At the same time, the carriage, which had already taken a beating, collapsed under the weight, causing the roughly packed goods to tumble out.

The person in charge of the team looked at the elderly man with a stern expression and exclaimed, "How could you let us set off without doing a pre-departure inspection?"

The driver of the carriage remained unmoved, and the person in charge became even more agitated, saying, "What are you waiting for? Don't just stand there, hurry up and collect the goods! Are you responsible for delaying important matters?"

However, the dignitaries mentioned earlier did not seem to be paying attention to the scattered goods at all, let alone the impressive performance of the wizard.

But Zhao Xu gazed at the scattered goods and couldn't help but smile quietly.

The wizard family, who had earned the reputation of being able to silence numerous adventurers in the surrounding areas, was indeed formidable.

Zhao Xu, however, had already realized that there was no longer an opportunity for him to fish in troubled waters.

Looking at the flames that represented the evening's reorganization of the power of the town of Frosty Ridge, he suddenly said, "Let the wizard who was auctioned off tonight as the family's ancestor pretend to be the family's ancestor. Is there any problem with that?"

For a moment, the people who heard his words all stiffened their faces.
Here is the translation of the text:

After a long time, the middle-aged man finally took a close look at Zhao Xü and said, "As the saying goes, one must first deceive oneself before deceiving others. Therefore, except for a few people, everyone else is unaware of our connection to the law wizard who is selling the tombsite artifacts. Until just now, when you left the tavern, I thought this deception was a success."

"But when the town is reduced to ashes tomorrow, those who know about our 'backstage' will be powerless to deny it, while those who don't know will be unable to participate. After all, there is a distance between Glimmerhaven and Mistral, and this matter will likely be forgotten. But I didn't expect you to actually uncover it at the last minute."

"The leader of the Kel tribe might have guessed some of it, but I think he won't tell you. Your expression is too obvious. You don't pay attention to family honors and seals, and the only possible explanation is that you saw something suspicious in the horse-drawn carriage that just fell over, but I glanced at it too and didn't notice anything unusual."

"So, dear brother, can you tell me how you figured it out?"

The middle-aged man spoke with a smile, but his expression became more serious.

The effect of the "transformation magic" was natural and obvious.

As for some "non-verbal communication" skills, the middle-aged man was an expert in this area, especially since Zhao Xü himself had not invested much in "deception" skills.

The middle-aged man was involved in family affairs and had always trained in "non-verbal communication", "deception", and "negotiation" skills. He even bought magical items to enhance his skills in this area.

At this point, the middle-aged man couldn't help but look back at the tavern, which was now somewhat restored to its former noise.

Zhao Xü, on the other hand, was looking at the raging inferno of the burning tomb.

The adventurers who looted the tomb would not have thought that they could survive the traps in the tomb, but instead, they had been caught off guard.
Here is the translation of the text:

However, it's not entirely without fault. The Law Firm wouldn't simply give up a family heirloom for a mere grave good. It's not something as trivial as a "+6 Intelligence headband" that's not even worthy of a legendary's attention. Rather, it's the accumulated wealth of the Merchants' Guild that caught the Law Firm's attention.

It's like a fruit tree that's been nurtured for years, and then suddenly harvested with a scythe. "Friend? Don't you have anything to say?" the middle-aged man's face changed expression as he continued to speak.

However, Zhao Xu had already dispelled the disguise.

But Zhao Xu didn't respond again.

Because in the corner of his eye, a familiar figure had appeared, as if from yesterday.

"It's an inconvenience, but according to the Winter Chronicle of the Association, dated January 11, 1043, I am hereby summoned by our side."

Anzhiya's clear and calm voice echoed through the room, carrying a hint of laziness, yet also commanding the entire scene to fall silent.
