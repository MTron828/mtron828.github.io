Chapter 136: The True Test

As Zhao Xu and the other two people entered the scenario, Lei An was about to continue explaining the details of Zhao Xu's subsequent actions and how he would behave later.

He suddenly discovered that someone was standing behind him.

Now that Lei An possessed the core of the true fantasy world, it was impossible for an ordinary person to stand behind him. He only just realized this.

Lei An immediately entered a state of extreme vigilance, and the true fantasy world's power also reached a high level of concentration.

"It's me," a hoarse and thick voice echoed.

Lei An finally relaxed, and turned around to see that it was the vice president of the Association, Feng Ao.

Lei An clearly saw that this vice president, Feng Ao, was a member of the Restoration Faction, which had always sought to follow in the footsteps of King Eustace of Orenstein and make the Association rule over the entire Arthurian realm.

"Vice President," Lei An respectfully bowed his head.

Although they belonged to different factions, Lei An did not worry because Feng Ao was known for being the most protective of the Association and adhering to the concept of mutual assistance among wizards.

Even if Feng Ao were not in office, Leif would not have been trapped in the mine for so long and unable to return.

"May I ask what task you want me to execute?" Lei An inquired.

"Raise the reality of the fantasy world to 100%," Feng Ao coldly instructed.

"What? Vice President, this is just a small test to unite the three of them," Lei An explained.

Just now, he had threatened Zhao Xu, saying that if he didn't perform well, it would affect the two other female wizards. This was just a bluff against Feng Ao.

All three of these sent-off students were people he couldn't offend.
Once the realism reaches 100%, it's no longer just an illusion, it's the kind that can really kill someone. This is also the reason why this level is called a true illusion.

"Even if we die, we can revive," Vice-President Feng said angrily, "I need to re-examine some things." 

Rayan could only silently nod to show he was listening.

Feng was willing to explain it to him again, which was already enough to save his face.

As for the revival method, Rayan didn't want to say anything. Even Rayan had explained it that way in the past, but Feng hadn't listened.

Thinking about this, Rayan could only silently disconnect his mental link with Zhao Xu.

He looked at the three people in the distance, surrounded by withered trees, and couldn't help but reveal a sympathetic expression.

He had basically understood Feng's intentions.

The two women's task was to retrieve the things he had entrusted to them.

As for Zhao Xu's task, it had been upgraded to ensure that the two women completed their task.

The "Illusion Concealment" ability would be available to all three of them.

But only when they achieved their goal would they receive the true reward.

The reward that would make Feng personally come to observe and decide would not be a legendary item, let alone a mythical one.

As Rayan thought about it, he couldn't help but feel a little envious.

Feng, on the other hand, was silently gazing at them with a cold expression.

Zhao Xu, if he wanted to advance to the level of a super magician, could show off his choices here.

...

Zhao Xu looked at the two female magicians, Lu and Ying, and they also looked at Zhao Xu.

However, everyone was wearing masks, and they couldn't see each other's faces or expressions, shrouded in darkness. Originally, this style was to avoid others' observation abilities, but now it had become a barrier between them.
On the forum, people have been boasting or waiting for someone to become the first 2nd-level mage. Given the low graduation rate of mages, it's impressive that someone can advance to 2nd-level in just a month. It's not much of a difference compared to the first 2nd-level player. Private betting pools have even been set up, with many players wagering forum coins on the hot favorites.

Who would have thought that three people would end up standing here together? Not even Zhao Xu expected that Floating City was hiding two 2nd-level mages who were just as cunning as him.

2nd-level mages can only cast one-ring magic, which is not very significant. However, once they reach 3rd level, they can master two-ring magic and gain some combat strength.

"We should share our information first," the female mage said with a gentle tone, her attitude the most relaxed among the three.

"I've received an order to go to the 101st classroom on the 8th floor, complete the test, and then I'll be granted a technique ability," she said.

"I agree," the other female mage chimed in, her tone slightly colder.

Then she began to analyze, "From the entrance of the alchemy ladder to the wall of the 101st classroom that disappeared, I walked about 225 steps, which is approximately 120 meters."

The female mage nodded, "I estimate I walked about 237 steps, which is also around 120 meters."

The two women exchanged a glance through their cloaks.

It seems that everyone walked the same distance from the ladder entrance to the disappeared classroom.

They might have really been walking in this vast empty space.

The two women didn't ask Zhao Xu about it, nor did they intentionally ask him to speak.
Here is the translation of the text:

"I sat down in front of the bonfire after walking around in the darkness. At that time, three people had already sat down facing the bonfire, and I was the fourth one."

"The fifth one is me, and the wind is the sixth one. However, now we need to verify something."

"Are we in the 8th floor of the library of ancient knowledge?" Zhao Xu asked.

Luo smiled and shook her head, saying, "Strictly speaking, what we need to verify is the current moment. Before we approached the wall with the number 101, we were definitely on the 8th floor. I waited at the elevator for the doors to open and close twice."

"When I went out of the elevator, I set a magical mark before the door closed. I looked back at the slowly closing door, and my magical mark was still there. So I was definitely not teleported."

At this point, Luo's shadow nodded, saying, "That's right. The only question is whether we were teleported when we walked into the dark corridor and saw the bonfire."

Zhao Xu could only shrug, feeling that these two cautious female wizards seemed to have covered all the possibilities.

"I was walking in the corridor when I opened a classroom door and observed the surroundings. At that moment, I secretly buried a metal spike at the bottom of the door, about 20 meters away from us to the left rear."

Luo's shadow said, "If it's still there, it means that the absolute space hasn't changed. We can then deduce that we are still on the 8th floor of the library of ancient knowledge."

After she finished speaking, the three of them nodded and directly went to verify the existence of the metal spike.

The entire strange forest was filled with withered and dead trees, and all the branches were bare. The only proof of the forest's former lushness was the fallen leaves on the ground.
Here is the translation of the text:

The 20-meter distance wasn't far from Zhao Xu and the three others, and they soon arrived. However, after the female wizard searched in that direction for a while, she shook her head. "Maybe there's some kind of space transformation?" Zhao Xu proposed his speculation.

When they were in the underground mine before, Zhao Xu had foolishly spoken the incantation and caused a magical explosion, and then Lian had used his illusions to show him the results. At the same time, the opponent had changed the space, moving the trap set by others to the tunnel they had to pass through.

"All possible," the female wizard, Luo, said. "Or maybe the iron sand is still hidden away by the opponent," she added, "but I've lost some fine sand, and it's hard to find."

At this point, they were all looking in the direction of the elevator exit, but it had already become an impassable cliff. "Let's go find that target first," Zhao Xu suggested, feeling that they couldn't stay here any longer. "It's not good to be late for those three."

Zhao Xu was also worried about having led these two 2nd-level wizards astray.

"Not," the female wizard, Luo, shook her head. "The three people sitting across from us, facing us, are probably illusions."

Zhao Xu suddenly felt a sense of unease. When he sat down, the three people across from him all nodded at him.

Now that he thinks about it, it seems like the rhythm is similar.

"Have you noticed?" the female wizard, Yao, said, looking at the female wizard, Luo, with admiration.

"They're moving with a uniform tempo, from their actions to their escape movements, and it looks like they're following a template. And I think, there can't be six 2nd-level players in the Floating Sky City, right?"
Here is the translation of the text:

"Mistress Lu just explained, 'When I first came in, I greeted them as well. Their reaction made me feel like it wasn't a real person.'"

"So, when you saw me come in and greet you, was it for this reason?" Mistress Lu's shadow suddenly understood.

Mistress Lu thought about it and couldn't help but look at Lu deeply.

She knew that the three people across from her were all fake illusions, but they could still maintain such a calm demeanor when chatting with her. This mental quality was indeed not ordinary.

After the three of them added some details, they continued to venture deeper into the forest, searching for the target assigned by Lei An.

The three of them communicated their prepared spells and then Zhao Xu took the lead, with the two women behind him.

As Zhao Xu walked ahead, he had a faint sense of unease.

Lei An had been disconnected from him from the beginning.

This unusual behavior made him feel that everything was not as simple as it seemed.

The sky of the Mysterious Forest was a dry, crimson color, reflecting the ground in an unusual way.

The three of them took slow steps, leaving footprints in the dry leaves until they were out of sight, at which point the footprints disappeared.

Zhao Xu's field of vision was extremely limited, and he could only barely rely on his limited and weak vision to move forward.

Just then, they had just applied the "Illumination Spell" to a stone, waiting for an attack to unleash it.

However, before they could clarify the situation in the Mysterious Forest, they dared not to activate the illumination suddenly.

Zhao Xu was at a loss, not knowing the meaning of Lei An's setting up this illusion.

However, he had just tried to use a small knife to cut a branch, and the sensation from the scratch was very realistic, exceeding the level of ordinary illusions.

"I wish I hadn't seen you all in the Floating City," Mistress Lu suddenly said.
Here is the translation of the text:

"I didn't participate in the new mage training," the female mage explained with a smile.
"I also didn't," Zhao Xu responded.
"That's the legend of the missing new mage, right?" the female mage continued.

"That's the one who sat on the throne of the Emperor of Magic and suddenly disappeared for a moment," the female mage said, knowing a few players from the other side, who had told her about this incident.

"Apparently, they spent a few more days fixing it, causing all the apprentices to graduate five days late," the female mage said.

"Are you not one of them?" the female mage suddenly asked.

"I, haha," the female mage smiled, but didn't explain.

Suddenly, Zhao Xu felt something under his feet.

Immediately afterwards, his shoulder was struck with a violent impact, causing him to fall to the ground.

The two mages, Ru and Ying, immediately shielded themselves in front of him, ready to release their spells at any moment.

After a while, Zhao Xu slowly regained consciousness, biting his teeth and pulling out the arrow shaft from his shoulder.

This arrow, this arrow, had reduced his HP by 6 points.

Is this the illusion magic that Li An promised?
