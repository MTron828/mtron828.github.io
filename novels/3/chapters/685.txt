Chapter 686: Ernest's Secret?

The maximum weight for a 10-point strength lift is around 100 pounds.
Each subsequent increase of 10 points corresponds to a 4-fold scale.
According to Olympic records of over 400 pounds, those powerful weightlifters are truly terrifying entities with over 20 points of strength.

Zhao Xun, with 53 points of strength, is undoubtedly equivalent to a 20-ton weight scale.
It's not an exaggeration to say that his casual punch can reach the level of "moving mountains and shaking the sea" and "splitting stones and separating gold".
Just a slight touch could make his arm extremely painful, as if it's about to fracture.
The opponent is at least 800 tons in strength, equivalent to some luxury cruise ships.
If he hadn't dodged in time, he might have been sent flying and crashed into the wall.

However, in Zhao Xun's mind, he has already fully comprehended the opponent's last sentence:
"As a city created by Ernest?"
It's really a city.
Any ordinary thing that comes into contact with Ernest will transform into an endless horror, difficult to imagine.

Recalling the "Nyalaratip" from his dream, that magnificent and terrifying world.
Ernest's abilities may have been learned in that mysterious world.

Zhao Xun's heart is filled with caution.
"City? Not a living fossil?"
Zhao Xun says aloud his guesses, causing turmoil in the opponent's mind.
Here is the translation of the text:

As the incantation "Swift Explosion" reached the corner of his mouth, he muttered, "Revive?"

At that moment, the mysterious voice from the void suddenly paused and couldn't help but ask, "Have you seen it, Old Master? Is it really going to be this low-level trash?"

"Not quite, I think I sense a familiar aura on you," he said.

But before Zhao Xu could continue, the void voice became extremely angry, "If there's no corresponding bloodline, it's definitely a thief!"

"It's no wonder I recognize the cloak on your body!"

【Adventurer Zhong Xia, you have successfully resisted the "Restraining Technique" influence.】
【Adventurer Zhong Xia, you have successfully resisted the "Restraining Technique" influence.】
......
In an instant, Zhao Xu saw his dynamic panel flash with over a dozen lines.

Fortunately, his willpower was incredibly sturdy, and he quickly distributed his luck points evenly, constantly boosting his defensive line.

Seeing this, Zhao Xu couldn't help but swear loudly.

Is this kind of cheating allowed?
He smashed over a dozen "Restraining Techniques" in an instant, acting like a child throwing mud at someone's house?
And what about the magical resistance provided by his Sage's Robe?

Why did it disappear?
Zhao Xu had become so calm and composed that he wouldn't flinch at the thought of anything, let alone this kind of absurd creature that defied logic.

Although the "Restraining Technique" is a defensive spell, it's also a restraining spell, ranked at the peak of the Nine Rings.
Once the resistance fails, it will trigger a fake death state, and then be buried in a small ball far from the surface.

Until one day, someone passes by the location where the "Restraining Technique" was cast and performs the "Unbinding Technique" from the Nine Rings.
Here is the translation of the text:

Even if wishing spells cannot rescue the hostages, they can only determine the location of the hostages.

That giant who previously tried to steal the notebook from Zhao Xu is still buried in the depths of the earth near the Star Lake, unseen by the world.

According to legend, the beings with existence above 96HD possess the ability to "imprison" and can release the "imprisonment spell" twice a day.

It's like this now, turning a flying saucer competition into a stormy rain of needles. However, Zhao Xu's thoughts are still clear, and he immediately grasped the key point.

Breath!
Cloak!
"Wait, my star cloak was given to me by someone," Zhao Xu said hastily.

"Gifts are not theft."
He had previously suspected that the guardian of the lost treasure of the Itel Kingdom, which Anniya brought him to, was a living fossil.

Living fossils, challenge level 33, legendary super-giant constructs.

They were created by extremely powerful wizards and are used to store and protect their treasures for many years.

The first-grade protection unit, once formed, has a space of over 100 cubic meters.

Moreover, it is extremely difficult to kill, and can use the energy of isolation and interdimensional transmission to make itself invisible, avoiding various visual and magical effects, and can also transmit to a random location in the star system.
From the day of its birth, various hardships were endured to prevent the theft of the law wizard. It wasn't until later that a vulnerability in the cloning technique was discovered. Just as Zhao Xu was analyzing the details of this seemingly living, breathing creature, the other party began to mock him.

"Who do you think you are? Where do you get the nerve?"

"Are you actually daring to get close to my family friend, Anxi Noya?"

"She gave it to you, so why don't you say she's your little wife?"

"You're pretty, but don't think you're smart."

As the party spoke, the city's constructs seemed to regain their strength, and they sneered at Zhao Xu for three minutes, their words dripping with malice.

Zhao Xu had initially maintained a calm and composed demeanor, waiting for the other party to finish speaking before intervening. However, he didn't expect to encounter a chatterbox who didn't reveal any useful information.

Was this an enemy or a friend? Zhao Xu's mind spun with thoughts.

In his hand, the four-ring technique "Human Nature" was ready to be cast, but he hesitated.

The constructs were difficult to handle, mainly because this being had a heap of immunities. The "Human Nature" technique, as its name suggested, allowed constructs to accept medical sub-discipline techniques. However, the cost was that they would lose their immunity to effects such as knockback, sneak attacks, non-lethal damage, stun, attribute damage, attribute absorption, instant death, and death magic.

Thus, Zhao Xu had many options to counterattack.

"Indeed, Anxi Noya gave it to me," Zhao Xu said lightly, shaking his head and tossing his backpack over his shoulder. "Do you think someone can steal something from a teacher?"

As he spoke, Zhao Xu let out a loud shout, and the ripples of his voice seemed to echo through the air, causing the surrounding stones to shake off a layer of dust.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Constructing life corresponds to mysterious knowledge.
Zhao Xu is not a careless person who suddenly snaps his fingers; he actually used the "scroll scholar's" dark knowledge: tactical ability, revealing the secret of constructing a life body that inspires fear.
This can bring him a "battle advantage".
If the other party really has a close relationship with Anniya, they will naturally know about the "dark knowledge" of the scroll, and will also think of Anniya, who is also a scroll scholar.
As a small organization, Zhao Xu believes that this speculation is valid.
If the other party can't even think of it, it can only be said that the relationship is not deep.
"Oh?" At this moment, the constructed city emitted a puzzled voice.
"Are you really the young lady who took a cloak from my fragmented body?"
"Impossible? My life is about to collapse."
"Ah, it's really you, wearing that robe, which was worn by the young lady before. It seems that the relationship is quite deep, what a shame."
As the constructed city continued to mutter to himself, it was as if he had entered a linguistic dead end, unable to get out of it for a while.
"Fragmented body?" Zhao Xu noticed this point of difference.
He brought a hint of playfulness, "Are you going to tell me that you are the true body of Ernest's secret?"
"Your body contains the treasure that was once searched by King Arthur."
"Oh, that's right, but unfortunately, there was no reward."
