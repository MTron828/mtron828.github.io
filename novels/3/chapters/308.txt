Chapter 309 Supplementing Energy
The next day when Zhao Xu logged in, the members of the Guardian Union looked at him differently.
Some players who were busy last night and didn't go on the forum now understood what had happened through the low conversations of the guild members.
At that time, they were less than a hundred meters away from the center of the vortex.
A few curious players were sizing up the "Soul Imprisoning Demon" next to Zhao Xu, which had annihilated the souls of players.
However, the Soul Imprisoning Demon was huge, with its own remaining power, so few brave ones dared to approach it recklessly.
Undead creatures themselves belong to the evil camp, and if they are attacked by the "Imprisoning Entity" without being careful, there is really no place to reason.
The "Starry Reflection" appeared in the Northern Alliance area, so most of the players in that area had bet on the "Starry Reflection" in the current top ten players on the forum.
On the other hand, Mistral was basically in support of "Dongcheng Ling." After the opponent's votes surpassed hers last night, the players who had spent a lot of money betting on her were all happy, and the number of people queuing at Mistral's rooftop had decreased significantly for a while.
As for Zhao Xu, who had only posted with the Dongcheng Ling account yesterday, he naturally understood what everyone's looks meant. Fortunately, he explained in his post, letting the players know the ins and outs of the situation. Otherwise, now everyone would not be looking at him as a strong player, but with awe and avoidance.
After two months of gaming experience, the players began to understand the value of attributes.
Here is the translation of the text:

It's clear that the 28-day blessing is a precious thing, and those who can register and log in to the creation hall with 32-day blessings are truly precious. Therefore, players who want to play the game well are generally advised to have at least 28-day blessings, and those who have the opportunity to get 22-day blessings twice will choose to give up. Yesterday, Zhao Xu casually deleted the accounts of four players and made all their equipment disappear, wasting two months of effort. After everyone gathered, the Guardian's Guild set off again, heading towards the "Moon Lake" at the foot of the Sunset Valley. Today, we need to search the lake bed for the wizard tower. Zhao Xu was cautious and only used the "Summon Ride" spell to ride the summoned small horse. Suddenly, he felt his field of vision had narrowed.

"Crazy Wind, I never thought that this 'Soul Prison' would be so powerful, able to extinguish a soul," said the guild's chief wanderer, Po Li, flattering Zhao Xu.

Yesterday's post by East City's Xiao Qian only mentioned that the "Higher Summoned Soul" spell could create a level 11 "Soul Prison" challenge. The post was followed by a detailed introduction to the Soul Prison, but there was no detailed description of the spell.

Thanks to the short information, everyone's gaze was fixed on Zhao Xu's legendary soul-bound scepter for over five seconds.

Everyone has realized that the "Stinging Gaze" detected by the wizard Chen Nu using "Detection Magic" represents a legendary or divine item, which might be referring to this scepter.

"Right, Crazy Wind, this undead creature will be with you forever?" Po Li gazed at the Soul Prison, his eyes filled with longing.
Here is the translation of the text:

Each spellcaster can control undead creatures four times the level of their spellcasting ability. Zhao Xu simply explained this rule.

The poet immediately reacted, saying that this crazy wind mage himself is a 5th-level spellcaster, so he can control undead creatures with 20HD, which means he has already taken up half of the capacity of the 12HD wraith soul demon.

For a moment, everyone's sense of awe was alleviated, as the stronger the undead creatures controlled, the higher the cost. However, people still couldn't help but wonder, as Zhao Xu's spellcasting ability level was 27, which meant he could control 108HD undead creatures, equivalent to nine wraith soul demons.

At this point, Zhao Xu's eyes flashed with a fierce determination, and with his nine permanently controlled wraith soul demons, he could slaughter an entire village.

Just as everyone was about to ask more questions, Frost Sword intervened to stop them.

Subsequently, everyone hastened their pace and finally traversed half a day's journey over a hill.

Suddenly, everyone's eyes widened as they gazed upon the breathtaking scenery.

The entire evening valley was vast, with towering trees and misty gray rocks in the foreground, forming an imposing landscape painting. The valley was also filled with lush and verdant trees, and under the sun's rays, they all took on a subtle glow.

What attracted even more attention was the nearby Mirror Lake, still reflecting the winter's waves, located beneath the vast blue sky, harmonizing with the serene and peaceful atmosphere of the wilderness, extinguishing everyone's original sense of adventure. At this moment, everyone was immersed in the mountain and water scenery.

"This scene is quite beautiful," Snow said in admiration. "If it weren't for these tasks and battles, this would be a VR tourist destination worthy of Arthur."

"Ah, unfortunately, without leveling up, not even a qualification to come here," Frost Sword lamented.
At the beginning of their journey out of the city, they could still see the silhouettes of many villagers from Mistralla, and they even passed through some villages to restock their supplies. However, as they continued moving in a direction that was not towards other towns, the frequency of encountering people decreased. Since yesterday, they had not seen many players at all. Once they left the densely populated city and entered the lair of the monsters, they accelerated their pace towards the Mirror Lake, which was not far away.

Willow's sword remained vigilant, still reminding everyone: "Be careful, the grass is quite tall here, and there are many large rocks that can block our view. And there are many giant stones around us."

Zhao Xu was driving a small, summoned horse, avoiding the scattered stones around him.

Suddenly, the front runner exclaimed: "Bear, it's huge!"

This sudden cry shattered the tranquility of the moment.

Immediately, the sound of "zhang" and "zhang" echoed through the air as the guild players drew their weapons or raised their longbows, looking towards the direction of the cry.

As they looked up, they saw a brown-yellow bear standing about four meters tall, its enormous body towering over the players.

"A ferocious bear," a guild member who reacted first shouted.

Hearing this, even the most carefree players became serious. While players may venture into underground cities or mysterious places, they usually encounter these ferocious animals while exploring around cities.

The skin and meat of these ferocious animals are often sold to players for a profit. Zhao Xu had previously encountered a ferocious mouse in the watchtower.
Here is the translation of the text:

The ferocious bear, which can be said to be one of the most formidable existence among ferocious animals, with a challenge level of 7 and over 100 HP of life value. When it saw dozens of players, it suddenly let out a loud roar.

With its three to four ton body weight, comparable to the weight of two cars combined, it stood tall, full of vitality and a fierce aura.

However, after just one roar, the ferocious bear turned around, lifted its leg, and took a step forward, fleeing towards the lake in front.

Although the ferocious bear itself had only 2 points of intelligence, it felt a sense of danger when facing dozens of adventurers in armor.

"Chase, defensive tactics, net formation!" exclaimed the willow sword.

"Chase, this bear can swim!" said the poet who had seen many things.

The Mirror Lake was in front of them, and the ferocious bear would only become a threat in the future, especially after the guild leaders went underwater.

At the command of the willow sword, several warriors suddenly charged forward at full speed, trying to grab the ferocious bear and prevent it from running away.

However, their physique and weight, not to mention their own strength, were unable to grasp the powerful ferocious bear, which had a strength of 31.

At that moment, even some barbarians were knocked to the ground.

Just then, several wizards who were present quickly cast the "Transformation" spell, instantly making the barbarians and warriors' bodies grow to twice their original size, with their weight increasing to eight times that of their original weight, and their attributes also increasing by 2 points due to their new physique.

The situation on the hillside suddenly reversed, and with the combined efforts of seven or eight warriors and barbarians, they barely managed to drag the fleeing ferocious bear to a halt.

Meanwhile, the wanderer and forest rangers who were walking by took turns attacking the ferocious bear, and it began to swing its own arms in retaliation.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

At that moment, even though the warriors were wearing armor, they had already heard the dull sound of impact. Many of those who did not have the ability to transform into giants were even knocked flying on the spot.

In reality, if it was just a group of 1st-level beginners, the ferocious bear would have killed them all with just one blow. However, the warriors who were wearing full armor and had sufficient defense were barely able to withstand the attack.

Zhou Xu saw that the warriors had barely managed to control the ferocious bear and did not want to waste too much energy here. He directly ordered the "prison soul demon" to move forward.

The ferocious bear saw the prison soul demon approaching and let out a fierce roar, as if it sensed a crisis.

The prison soul demon, with a strength of 28, directly confronted the ferocious bear in a fierce battle.

"My prison soul demon needs the ferocious bear's soul energy," Zhou Xu said at this time.

The warriors who were battling the ferocious bear heard this and naturally retreated. In reality, they had just narrowly escaped danger, and if they were hit by the ferocious bear's attack, even the healers might not be able to save them.

Zhou Xu had consumed the soul energy of the other four people the day before, which meant that his prison soul demon had no energy to cast its "similar magic" at this time.

However, the prison soul demon's "similar magic" was still very important to Zhou Xu, so he directly chose the ferocious bear as the fuel for his prison soul demon.

However, the ferocious bear was extremely powerful, with a constitution of 19 and a toughness of 12. With the prison soul demon's "prison body" ability, which had a difficulty of 19, it was very difficult to achieve a direct hit.

However, most spells that could weaken the opponent's constitution had to go through the opponent's toughness first, forming an insoluble cycle.

Zhou Xu thought for a moment and then gave up his original plan.

Weakening wasn't working, so he would control instead.
Here is the translation of the text:

As long as the ferocious bear is unable to move, its soul magic will naturally continue to try, requiring a 12-layer strong willpower to overcome the 19-layer strong willpower, with still a one-third probability of failure.

Because Zhao Xu had reached the three-ring circle, he had acquired a very powerful attribute damage spell!

This spell, due to its own extremely high damage value, had been rarely known by people and was even kept secret.

However, Zhao Xu gazed at the ferocious bear ahead, and at that moment, he chanted the incantation and cast the 2-ring necromancy spell---Ghost Hand.
