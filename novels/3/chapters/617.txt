Chapter 618: Awakening Consciousness, Counterattack

"Father? Father?"

Zhou Xu hadn't thought that there would be such a coincidence in the world. He had been searching for a secret underground and had actually found the father of Ana Noya here.

Although Zhou Xu had thought countless times and recalled every detail of his time with Ana Noya, he still accepted this "hard-to-believe" fact.

At this moment, he could see the outline of Ana Noya's eyebrows from the face of the middle-aged man, Weng Bu.

Moreover, he was certain that the most realistic lie was the one that was both true and false. If Weng Bu wanted to deceive him, he would not take such a big detour.

Not to mention, he could easily expose it later.

Therefore, Zhou Xu deliberately exaggerated his "deception" skills and tried to keep a stiff expression. However, in his heart, he had accepted this point.

Luckily, he and Ana Noya had no relationship, otherwise, this would be like courting disaster.

"Oh?"

Weng Bu paused, looking hesitant, "You may be trying to keep calm, but you've also revealed another point - you don't doubt my words."

At this moment, Weng Bu, with his middle-aged appearance, took a few steps forward, lost in thought.

"This means you've seen my daughter's true appearance, and it's not strange that way."

As soon as he heard these words, Zhou Xu's thoughts relaxed, and he didn't think too much.

He had realized that the other party might not have "seen through" him, and it was possible that he relied on "magic" instead.
Here is the translation:

Zhou Xu just has the domain of honesty with a ring of truth, and the method of weaving lies with a ring of three. Not to mention the direct mind-reading method. And the middle-aged man, Yīn Bù Bǎi, is even more profound and unfathomable, making it impossible to gauge.

"'It's interesting,' Yīn Bù Bǎi said to himself, his eyes shining with a newfound love for life. 'You haven't asked a single question from start to finish. It seems that you and my daughter have a deep connection.'"

As he spoke, he cast a sidelong glance at Zhou Xu. "I can be certain that she will not mention my past to anyone. But you have no respect for me at all?"

"'Or are you saying you already know I'm an unfit father?'"

Instantly, Zhou Xu's expression changed, and he became stern and serious.

His face stiffened, with a hint of coldness, he shook his head. "There are many ways to understand history."

"I've seen her memories, and I've seen her struggling to survive as a child. You, at the time, must have become a legendary mage, yet you still abandoned her."

Each word Zhou Xu spoke was laced with sharp intent.

"Some people are not worthy of being a father, yet they coincidentally become one."

Instantly, Zhou Xu threw a punch, aiming directly at the other's face.

However, before he could land the punch, Yīn Bù Bǎi sidestepped and blocked the punch with his right palm, holding it firm.

"Although I'm unable to grasp the abilities of the nine swords now, my physical combat instincts still exist."

Yīn Bù Bǎi did not reveal a mocking smile, but rather lectured Zhou Xu seriously.

But just the next moment, he released his hand and subconsciously stepped back three steps, then cautiously gazed at Zhou Xu.
Here is the translation of the text:

"The new generation of wizards has become so cunning to this extent," said Wén Bù Fǎ with a serious expression. "What made you realize that this space is unusual?"

"It started from the change in your footsteps," said Zhào Xù.

"Although you seem to have combined your thoughts and movements, making them reasonable. However, I also realize that this space is definitely warped."

"Ah, I see," said Wén Bù Fǎ, nodding his head.

With a reason to be angry with An Ni Na, Wén Bù Fǎ threw a punch to measure the actual distance between him and Zhào Xù.

"Ah, you've really calculated it," Wén Bù Fǎ said with a rare expression of admiration. "It seems that my daughter has inherited my talent in this area."

As soon as Wén Bù Fǎ finished speaking, he suddenly transformed into a shadow and pounced at Zhào Xù.

It was as if an eagle was swooping down on a rabbit, making it impossible for anyone to react.

Zhào Xù, who had lost his magic, could only rely on his instincts to stretch out his hand to block the attack, adopting the standard stance for blocking.

However, the next moment, the middle-aged Wén Bù Fǎ, with his hands transformed into eagle claws, grasped the gap between Zhào Xù's arms and tightened his fist.

Zhào Xù immediately felt the intense and fierce attack, as if his chest was about to burst. It was as if his lungs were being tightly grasped, making it difficult for him to catch his breath.

However, Wén Bù Fǎ's whip-like kick had already been swung over, facing the massive wave that was as sharp as gold and jade. Zhào Xù hastily bent his knees to block the attack, barely managing to deflect the opponent's attack.
Here is the translation of the text:

As soon as he touched him, the third consecutive punch landed on Zhao Xu's back, which was slightly bent. He suddenly fell to the ground like a plummeting object, directly hitting the ground with a thud.

"It seems that my four consecutive punches' final blow is unnecessary," he said with a shake of his head.

Win Without Losing shook his head, "If I had known you were so incompetent, I wouldn't have wasted so much expression on you."

The four consecutive punches, a legendary martial art in close combat, could be mastered when the foundation attack broke through to the 6th level of battle. By the 11th level, the third punch could be derived, and up to the 16th level, the four consecutive punches could be mastered.

This all-out output of four consecutive punches was the final pride of close combat.

Zhao Xu was now lying on the ground, looking at Win Without Losing with a face that showed no hint of disappointment.

"I'm still curious about how you discovered this anomaly," Win Without Losing said. "Your previous reasoning was not sufficient. If you explain it to me, I won't torture you."

"It's simple," Zhao Xu said, his mouth bleeding, as he lifted his pant leg to reveal a faint, almost imperceptible wound on his right calf.

It was as if a sharp, fine line had cut through his calf, all the way to the bone. Even though the wound was too fine, not a single drop of blood had seeped out. Zhao Xu's right calf had already lost all feeling.

"Ah, I see," Win Without Losing said, suddenly realizing, "You've lost all magical support, but you still managed to bite your teeth shut and didn't reveal anything. Your willpower is probably stronger than some legendary mages I've seen."

"Is that punch you just threw meant to hide the fact that you've already lost the ability to stand?" Win Without Losing shook his head. "But what's the point of that?"
Here is the translation of the text:

"Can't you just come back earlier and die, so that's it?"

The next moment, he took out a dagger from his chest and said, "You said I used the dagger to pin your limbs to the ground, so you can't move. How long can you hold on to the cutting force in this space? This is the reason why I only caused you to lose your fighting power, otherwise you would have died after four consecutive attacks."

"Unfortunately, you're out of luck." Zhao Xu smiled, his whole body and limbs scattered, but with no hint of disappointment.

He had already achieved what he wanted.

He fell down reasonably.

"How can you still be so confident?" Wén Bǎi shook his head and smiled. "Don't you think that just now, I forced you to attack me repeatedly, which would make the other soul in my body wake up? Unfortunately, it's still one step short."

Zhao Xu closed his eyes and muttered a phrase he had obtained from the "Truth Fragment" in the final scroll - the content of the Iron Heart technique!

"No!"

Wén Bǎi, full of confidence, revealed an incredulous expression, and was about to grab Zhao Xu's hand to stop him from speaking again.

However, he suddenly realized that the opponent was lying down in a position that had already been filled with space-cutting arrays, which was the initial trap he had left for the opponent.
At this moment, Zhao Xu lay down, perfectly avoiding the space-cutting array and also blocked Wén Bǎi's momentum.
Immediately, Wén Bǎi clutched his head and shouted, "Don't say it! I can make a deal with you—"

The voice suddenly stopped.
Qin Shi Huang, having sat up again, had already turned white-haired, and in an instant, all the spatial boundaries around him were crushed, returning to nothingness.

Only this vast expanse of heaven and earth remained, with fragmented rocks scattered all over, bearing the scars of time.

"What's the point of studying now, young one?"
