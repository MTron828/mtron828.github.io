Chapter 378: Player Invitation

Before Zhao Xu arrived, he had already learned about this misty area and had even traversed it with his friends in his previous life.

However, the North Alliance and the Western Kingdom could only cooperate smoothly because this devastated land had been developed over the years through trade and exploration, with several safe passage routes established.

Otherwise, the residents of Luca City, who were not intentionally seeking death, would not knowingly venture into a treacherous area. With a dense crowd of people moving forward, there was a psychological sense of mutual self-preservation.

Some powerful families, although they could only rely on their own legs to move forward on this road, had at least employed mercenaries who were also seeking refuge, and together they headed towards the North Alliance.

For mercenaries, the scale of combat with tens of thousands of soldiers was like being crushed by a meat grinder, with no room for them to operate smoothly.

Without a sense of belonging to the Western Kingdom, they naturally took advantage of the opportunity to leave and head towards the stronger North Alliance.

Over the centuries, the people of Arthur's era had developed a fixed logic of thought, knowing when to take action.

As the sun shone down, the secret silver armor worn by Viola slightly reflected the light, causing Zhao Xu's eyes to sting, as if they were being reflected in a mirror.

Ordinary silver metal would not have this mirror-like effect unless polished, and only the legendary secret silver could easily achieve this effect.

This is the secret silver armor!
Here is the translation of the text:

The secret silver armor itself makes the armor lighter, which naturally limits the magic user's own movements even further. This also reminded Zhao Xu of the time when he used the alias "Stellar Reflection" and disguised himself as the goddess of wind to help the miners in the Starfall Town. Later, through the channel of the Winter City Goddess Church, he obtained a "High-Quality Silver Mine".

The Starfall Town only produces medium to high-quality silver ore, which can produce secret silver. When Zhao Xu inserted the "Secret Silver Crystal", it means that the mine's production of secret silver has increased.

Zhao Xu seemed to see a set of "Secret Silver Armor" shining before his eyes.

"Are we almost there?" Vivian anxiously asked, looking worried.

Crowds often mean a large target.
Like goblins, they wouldn't dare to disturb us.
But it also means that those who dare to attack our team must have absolute confidence.
"Almost, right?" Zhao Xu replied, looking back at the retreating Saint Warrior by his side. The Saint Warrior's iron helmet was intimidating, and no one dared to approach within a radius of at least three meters.

Although Vivian wore a helmet, her hair was not tied back, and people could still see her golden hair peeking out from the seams of her armor. Naturally, many fellow travelers envied Zhao Xu's good fortune, being able to enjoy the comforts of a night's rest while also having guards on duty during the day.

"Vivian, have you mastered your third-level Saint Warrior abilities?" Zhao Xu asked, looking at the approaching mist ahead.
Here is the translation of the text:

Vivian nodded seriously, "Don't worry, Master. I'm a standard 3rd-level Saint Warrior. I possess the abilities of a 1st-level Saintly Virtue, Evil Detection, and Demon-Slaying Sword. I also have the 2nd-level Divine Blessing and Healing, and the 3rd-level Courageous Radiance and Divine Protection."

Her face turned slightly red as she spoke, "Even as a shapeshifter, I haven't given up on my abilities. Shapeshifters can use their abilities without time limits, which means they can maintain a fixed form for their entire life."

Zhao Xu saw the shapeshifter in front of him, who was also a player, and felt relieved that they hadn't fallen behind in their abilities.

To be honest, Saint Warriors are naturally prone to causing trouble and meeting their demise, so their abilities are quite diverse in the early stages of the game. Although they haven't yet reached the 4th level of spellcasting, their abilities are still above average.

In particular, Demon-Slaying Sword is a formidable skill.

After the Great Calamity, the gods strengthened the Saint Warrior profession, including increasing the frequency of Demon-Slaying Sword from once a day to each time it is used.

As a result, even if Saint Warriors use up their Demon-Slaying Sword abilities, they can restore them by praying silently to their gods or deities.

As a 3rd-level Saint Warrior, Vivian can only use her abilities once per encounter.

Although she may seem weak, once she uses her abilities against "evil beings," they will add her own charisma adjustment value to her attack power and her Saint Warrior level to her damage output.
Here is the translation of the text:

As of now, with 26 days of being under the influence of the Charm, it's equivalent to an 8-level attack boost, which is indeed formidable. Adding the "Knowledge and Piety" and "Dark Knowledge" of Zhao Xu as well as the "Praise" spell that has been cast on them, it's equivalent to an attack boost of 16 levels or above. It's safe to say that ordinary monsters would be cut down one by one.

Suddenly, Zhao Xu turned around and looked at Vi Vi An with a serious expression.

"What's wrong, Commander?" he asked.

Vi Vi An knew that the Commander would not harm her, but as a righteous and just Saint Warrior, she couldn't do anything inappropriate either.

"I just suddenly remembered your ability to invoke divine power," Zhao Xu finally reacted.

As a Saint Warrior, it's already difficult to begin with, considering the multiple attribute requirements. Strength, Constitution, and Intelligence are key attributes for melee professions, and Saint Warriors also need Sense attributes to cast spells. Various profession abilities are also linked to Charisma attributes.

The 2nd-level profession ability, "Divine Favor", allows Saint Warriors to stack their three major immunities with "Charisma Adjustment".

"Yeah," Vi Vi An said proudly, "my three immunities have increased from 6/6/7 to 14/14/15."

Upon hearing this, Zhao Xu couldn't help but be taken aback, comparing it to the 3rd-level ability that can immunize all diseases and the "Divine Protection" ability that boosts morale by 4 levels, which seemed relatively weak.

However, after obtaining the 2nd-level ability "Healing" , Vi Vi An has also gained a limited healing ability, allowing her to heal a life value equal to her profession level multiplied by her Charisma Adjustment, equivalent to 24 HP per day.
Here is the translation of the text:

After being affected by the permanent revival spell "Death Contract" and losing two types of physical attributes, Zhao Xu's life value had dropped to around 20-something, barely enough to survive a wave of attacks. Currently, their team is equivalent to two healing units, making it a luxurious configuration on this road.

Zhao Xu is stroking his smooth chin, with ViVi, who has a demon's inherent detective ability exceeding 19th level, suddenly turning her head to look back at the approaching person. At this moment, she is tightly gripping the Holy Avenger in her hand, with her palm lightly pressing on the shield-like mirror on her arm, ready to activate it.

Zhao Xu is also looking down at the opponent, with a spell of enduring cast on himself, and a stack of three "Higher Mage Shields" that directly increases the defense value of his shield by 10 levels. Adding the 3-level bonus from the "Praise" spell, it is almost impossible for most people on this road to break through his defense.

"What's the intention?" ViVi looks at the approaching person with caution, her originally charming posture now as cautious as a lioness.

At this moment, a barbarian player, who is over 1.9 meters tall, walks up to the two, holding up his hands and saying, "Hey, no need to be like that. I'm just here to invite you to join our team and travel together."

As he speaks, he points to the carriage train behind him, which is Zhao Xu's strongest team, comprising five carriages connected in a row. Except for the first carriage, which carries people, the other four carriages are stacked with wooden boxes filled to the brim.
Here's the translation:

"We are employed by the El'asi family, and they are planning to flee to the Northern Alliance this time. They have made enemies in the past due to their business dealings, and they are worried that someone might harm them on the road, so they are asking us to escort them."

"The El'asi family's leader wants to invite us to join them at an additional cost of 30% above our usual escort fee. However, the barbarian himself is not a skilled negotiator."

"But the barbarian player is actually quite eloquent, so he came to negotiate instead. As he was speaking, the barbarian player couldn't help but glance at Vivian's body, which was still under her armor. In reality, her body was still fiery and passionate, but it couldn't be seen under her armor."

"However, the silver-like glow kept flashing, and the barbarian player immediately recognized it as the legendary Silver. He couldn't help but think about the treasure in the carriage behind him, which belonged to the El'asi family."

"Vivian immediately asked, 'What kind of business does the El'asi family engage in?'"

"This is also a limitation of the Saint Warrior due to their faction. They usually only act according to the will of the temple. To accept other people's employment, they need to do a basic employer investigation."

"That's why the Saint Warrior either doesn't join an adventure team or becomes the team leader. If they don't, they will often clash with the team."

"So Zhao Xu was puzzled. How could the lady from May and Anniya be so sure that Vivian wouldn't conflict with their faction's faith and ignore his instructions, and even eventually abandon him?"
