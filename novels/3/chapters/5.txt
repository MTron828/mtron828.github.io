Chapter 6: The Peak of the Ladder?

Zhao Xu, who had lived two lives as a human, didn't dwell on it for too long before reacting quickly.

He could try to filter out the statues by answering a large number of ambiguous questions, leaving only the wizard and cleric statues. For someone with his dual elite professions, perhaps only two statues would remain, and the defect system would trigger.

If he guessed incorrectly, it wouldn't matter, and he could continue answering questions to eliminate the cleric statue.

This operation would be more challenging, but he didn't feel any pressure.

Compared to fighting monsters, this was child's play.

The profession selection question allowed for multiple choices, although it would slow down the results, but it was an opportunity for Zhao Xu to simultaneously choose between the wizard and cleric options.

Zhao Xu took a step forward to answer the question.

He wasn't a wizard, but he had seen wizards before.

He was also the only person in the world who had touched both wizards and clerics before the game started.

Except for those naturally suited to their professions, few people could have Zhao Xu's keen sense of profession.

In reality, after the game, players who had trained more would understand what profession suited them.

The profession recommendation stage was often skipped by many people, and it didn't affect their future development.

As Zhao Xu had expected, the wizard and cleric statues continued to brighten, while the light of other professions gradually faded away. Even Zhao Xu's warrior profession from his past life had completely extinguished its light.

As he continued answering questions, he had vaguely grasped the concept of the question bank.

Understanding this, Zhao Xu felt confident and at ease.
Here is the translation of the text:

As he walked past the 500th step, he had already successfully extinguished half of the statues.

Extinguished, not eliminated. Once his answer revealed a certain bias, the originally extinguished statues would still shine again.

Zhao Xu was like a chef responsible for cutting vegetables, repeatedly cutting slice by slice.

Although it seemed like a mechanical pattern, only he knew where the key point was.

Ordinary people would have a few outstanding statues to choose from after 30 questions.

Even more cautious, after 100 questions, most would be relatively dim, and the remaining brightness would be comparable to a lamp.

Unfortunately, the defect system only recognized the state of complete extinction, not the state of faintness approaching darkness.

Otherwise, Zhao Xu could have done it in 200 questions.

Complete extinction was considered unsuitable by the system, not recommended at all, and would only be extinguished.

This was also one of the reasons why few players opened the defect system.

Up to the 900th question, Zhao Xu's statues were almost completely extinguished.

The statues of the two floating wizards and the priest had already reached the end of their light, but the druid still had a faint glow, which could not be extinguished.

Just after Zhao Xu answered at least 50 questions, he had not affected any changes in the light on the scene.

He knew that AI would not intentionally target him, but this completely ineffective redundant information question had already stirred up some anxiety in him.

The druid had a level 9 spell, and his faction required him to maintain neutrality between order and chaos, or good and evil, on the dual axis.

To some extent, his ideology was consistent with his ideals.
Here is the translation of the text:

Unless there are obvious issues, such as hatred towards nature or animals, he didn't really want to extinguish the Druid profession's final sparkle. However, it's even more troublesome that Zhao Xu underestimated the number of questions and didn't expect so many irrelevant questions to appear, and he might have to eliminate the Paladin as well.

This ladder has only 2000 steps.

After answering 2000 questions, he would even think of stopping, but the system won't refresh the questions.

Normally, people who answer honestly won't drag it to 2000 questions, even if the requirements are high, and they will stop at around 1000 questions, and the system won't refresh the questions then.

Players who are dissatisfied with the profession recommendation can still choose to extinguish the Druid's sparkle.

Zhao Xu can only start filtering out at 1500 questions, so he decided to eliminate the Druid first, and then the Paladin.

To ensure that only the Wizard is left at the end, he needs to maintain a buffer of 500 questions.

Zhao Xu continued to answer questions.

The number of questions started to rise slowly - 1000, 1100, 1200, 1300, 1400.

All the way until the 1500th question, the Druid's sparkle had almost been extinguished several times.

However, Zhao Xu didn't grasp the rhythm and re-lit some of the sparks twice.

Otherwise, he would have eliminated it at 1300.

Looking at the 1500th step, Zhao Xu sighed and then executed the plan, changing the direction of his answers to eliminate the Paladin's sparkle.

Ordinary people might think, "Why bother? Let's just try a few more questions and see if we can eliminate the Druid's sparkle."

But Zhao Xu has never had such a reckless attitude.
Here is the translation of the text:

He went to the casino, bought 1000 chips, and if he lost, he would definitely leave and wouldn't think about making a comeback. The questions continued, 1510 questions, 1520 questions, 1530 questions. Until almost 1550, Zhao Xu finally discovered that the glow of the pastor's statue had become slightly visible to the naked eye. Just then, Zhao Xu answered a question similar to a train stuck in a dilemma, a question about whether to save one rule-abiding child or five unruly children. He gave his answer from the perspective of a wizard.
Unbeknownst to him, this time the pastor's glow did not fade, but instead, the last bit of druid statue glow completely faded away.
"The player's dual elite profession is confirmed, and the answer system will automatically close."
"Defect system activated, please choose whether to load the defect."
Zhao Xu's heart suddenly jolted, and he couldn't help but feel joyful.
He had gambled correctly.
