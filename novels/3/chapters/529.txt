Chapter 530: Give me an explanation!

For the next half-month, Zhao Xu also boarded the train back to school, with the rotating wheels like the shadow of the setting sun, stretching far away from his hometown.

Before leaving, he glanced at the city's last sunset, then turned around and entered the carriage without looking back.

Sometimes, the last glance often occurs unintentionally, and no one knows that it's goodbye.

In the carriage, Zhao Xu gazed at the students who were also heading back to school, everyone except for the initial reluctance to leave home also felt excitement at the prospect of returning to familiar classmates.

However, he remained silent, lost in thought, gazing out the window like a solitary traveler, passing through this fleeting moment.

On the other hand, as time flew by, the progress of the Azeroth players also accelerated, with the places they explored expanding from the town's outskirts to some mysterious caves deep in the wilderness, a formidable and treacherous terrain.

Azeroth's grandeur and majesty also unfolded before the eyes of the people, as these brave adventurers explored and expanded their territory.

The "Spring Outing Tour" group, which allowed ordinary leisure players to participate for a fee, also became a hot and lucrative business for Azeroth.

As the area surrounding the town was largely demolished after the closure, the foundation of the guild's residence was also rebuilt.

Countless large-scale cargo vehicles went back and forth between the town gate and the enclosed area.

Players and town residents also began to adapt to the fact that the "Mage Association" would become part of their lives.
Here is the translation of the text:

At this time, the players gradually got to know the charm of "Wang Congwei", a renowned figure in the Mistral player community. No one knew why, but it seemed that anyone could become friends with her. Even the high-ranking officials who were originally extremely cautious around Zhao Xu began to relax their guard due to Wang Congwei's influence, and they started to make contact with each other. The "Anti-Jacking Alliance" that had initially arrived in the town also started to make contact with Wang Congwei's side. This also allowed Zhao Xu to stop using his old account "Starlight Reflection" to suppress others on the forum.

This also made Zhao Xu more curious about the mysterious nature of Wang Congwei's leadership ability. The sound of hammering and drilling, accompanied by the crowing of roosters at dawn, became another alarm clock that woke people up from their slumber. Moreover, because Zhao Xu and Wang Congwei required rapid construction to meet their demands, a large number of workers summoned from outside the mine also turned this area into another bustling spot. Many civilians came to set up small stalls along the outskirts.

As for Zhao Xu, he maintained his mysterious demeanor, becoming a formidable sword that loomed over the town. Except for the few times he revealed his face after the explosion at the room he had burgled, he mostly spent his time hiding in a temporary wooden tower, reading books, and appreciating the peaceful scenery of the town.

Anjali's whereabouts were unpredictable, appearing and disappearing like a ghost. Zhao Xu had seen her a few times, and every time she seemed to be in a hurry. Sometimes, after pointing out some academic difficulties to Zhao Xu, Anjali would activate higher-level teleportation or interdimensional teleportation to leave the area. As for Zhao Xu, he continued to accumulate his strength.
Here is the translation:

Excluding the fact that he had solidified his various knowledge and skills, he began to feel that the 9th level was not far away. He just needed to wait for an opportunity to feel confident enough to directly read the fourth "notebook". Suddenly, Zhao Xu discovered that he had already flipped to the last page of the "Simplified Atlas of Arthur's Map", and he felt a sense of satisfaction with his geography skills.

He lightly activated his invisible technique, quietly leaving the high tower. Meanwhile, the "eyes" monitoring the area didn't notice anything unusual.

After walking a few streets, Zhao Xu finally removed his disguise and revealed his original appearance in a shady alley. However, his entire body was already covered in a simple disguise, making it difficult for passersby to determine whether he was a mage or not. Zhao Xu adjusted his hood to cover more of his forehead before walking around the bustling market.

"Come quickly, I just caught a very rare dragon skin material that can greatly enhance defensive abilities when added to armor!"

"An ancient scroll excavated from the mysterious underground might be just one step away from you and the noble mage."

"Double-handed swords, innocent and trustworthy, the newly forged weapons from the renowned North City workshop are limited to three sets, don't miss out...!"

"Adventure sets, sold in bulk."

His loud voice echoed from the streethead to the streettail, reminding Zhao Xu of his distant memories. However, when he first came to this place, he was more focused on collecting taxes from these stalls.

As for his current situation, he had already received a substantial sum from taxation every month as the lord's right.
Suddenly, Zhao Xu's gaze swept across an old man's stall, noticing that the table was filled with various bottles and jars that looked like medicinal liquids.

His curiosity piqued, he quickly walked over to take a closer look.

In Arthurian legend, "medicine" implies a high value.

Players who want to enjoy the convenience of magic can do so by either seeking the help of a mage or relying on magical items. These items include scrolls, rings, strange objects, wands, staffs, authority rods, weapons, armor, and medicine.

Among these items, scrolls have the highest usage requirements, while medicine is the lowest and requires only that you can drink water.

Magic potions and divine oil are both one-time use items that can replicate the effects of a spell that takes less than a minute to cast and has a maximum level of three.

Arthur consumes the most and has the most varieties of "medicine".

Although high-end players might consider drinking a mouthful of medicine in desperate situations to urgently recover their health.

For example, light wound medicine would cost 50 gold coins, while severe wound medicine would require a staggering 750 gold coins.

It's no longer a matter of drinking medicine, but rather drinking a concentrated liquid of pure gold.

So, Zhao Xu was deeply curious about why this ordinary stall was selling medicine.

As he looked at these bottles that had clearly been cleaned beforehand but still had remnants of grime stuck to the glass mouths, Zhao Xu realized he had stumbled upon another group of tomb raiders.

These were clearly grave goods that had been excavated.

"Are these medicines still usable?" Zhao Xu couldn't help but ask.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

If it's a medicine that's been developed in recent years, then it's obvious that it won't expire even after decades of storage. However, these medicines that have been buried for hundreds or even thousands of years are a different story.

This old man, with a sly grin on his face, said, "I'm just a small-time trader, relying on my own wits to sell my goods. I won't refund or exchange them once they're sold." Zhao Xun tried probing him, "Can I take a look?"

Even without using his detection magic or putting on his mage's goggles, Zhao Xun sensed that some of the scattered bottles and jars on the shelves seemed to contain unusual substances. The old man smiled, as if he had caught his prey, and said, "Of course, you can take a look, but you can't taste it."

In reality, a more reliable approach would be to take a sip. However, who knows what consequences might arise from taking a sip of these ancient medicines that have been buried for unknown numbers of years.

Zhao Xun, who had already anticipated the outcome, silently observed the medicines, putting on his mage's goggles and pretending to analyze the liquid's concentration. After a while, Zhao Xun put down the pale blue medicine he had been playing with and reached for another pure red medicine.

After wasting a detection spell slot, he had analyzed the blue medicine, which turned out to be just a bottle of dyed blue water.

Zhao Xun carefully observed the shallow red medicine in the glass bottle, which sparkled under the sunlight. Its luster was identical to the legendary healing medicine.

Zhao Xun used his detection spell again to investigate. However, his face suddenly changed slightly.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

Because the conclusion drawn from the magical art is completely consistent with the strength of the bull's elixir just now.

This is just a worthless elixir with no effect.

Zhao Xu, who couldn't help but be curious, directly opened the bottle and gently swirled the liquid inside, as if to sense the inner breath.

The old man who saw this scene also smiled, his teeth bared, as if he was very satisfied.

Zhao Xu also smiled.

The bitter almond taste.

The flavor and color of this elixir are the same as the treatment elixir, but it has no effect at all.

Zhao Xu already understood what had happened, and immediately took out a copper coin from his sleeve, as if to wipe off the dirt from the bottle mouth.

However, the copper coin "ding" sounded as it floated up and fell back into his palm.

He sensed the old man's surface thoughts.

As expected.

He had encountered a team of scammers who intentionally sold fake elixirs.

If the elixir had really lost its effect due to time, it should have also lost its aroma or color.

But the taste, color, and everything were all right, and it just didn't work.

If an adventurer really used this elixir to save their life, they would indeed be swindled.

At this time, Zhao Xu's face also darkened.

In his previous life, he had also dealt with a team that sold fake elixirs.

But he had caught the entire team and they had obtained a guarantee from a powerful person, and then they were released from prison with a swagger.

At this time, Zhao Xu quietly put down the elixir and shook his head, saying, "These elixirs are all fake, useless."
Here is the translation of the text:

The old man's face suddenly turned pale, and he scowled at the distance, saying, "Young man, you're not even willing to buy it. Saying this kind of thing about me is unacceptable!"

"We Northerners won't take any nonsense," the old man's voice rose in anger.

The surrounding customers and vendors turned their attention to the scene.

However, Zhao Xun remained calm and said, "I believe I'm not the first one to see through your fake medicines. But before, people who knew about this would just walk away when they saw it was fake medicine."

"But I'm different," Zhao Xun smiled playfully.

Just then, two burly men towered over Zhao Xun, their faces menacing.

"What's going on?" one of them asked.

At this point, two patrol officers who maintained the order on the street walked over, one of whom had a piece of grass in his mouth, looking bored.

The old man who sold fake medicine also took the opportunity to recount what had just happened.

As the crowd gathered, they began to understand what was going on.

"This medicine isn't too easy to prove," said the patrol team leader with a smile.

"It's simple," Zhao Xun said. "Just take a sip and you can try it out."

"How do you say that?" the patrol officer turned to the old man.

But the old man was taken aback, saying, "I'm selling genuine medicines passed down in my family. As a stranger, you can't sully our family honor. I agree to have the team leader verify this. But if everyone has to try a small sip to verify, I won't be able to bear the loss."

Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu was a straightforward man, "As long as it's true, there's a bottle of the same kind that I bought one bottle here."

"Good," the old man smiled, his eyes shining with satisfaction.

He began to examine Zhao Xu's attire, as if pondering something.

At the same time, he handed Zhao Xu the blue-colored medicine that he had just observed, covering the label on the bottle: "Sir, this is the fake medicine he said it was. To avoid your psychological suggestion, you drink a sip first and then talk."

The patrol officer looked puzzled, but still nodded, and with the old man's help, took a sip.

Suddenly, the patrol officer's face changed, "I feel like my strength has increased slightly."

The old man smiled with satisfaction and released his grip on the bottle cap.

The audience around them looked at Zhao Xu with evil eyes.

In reality, from the moment the word "outsider" was spoken, Zhao Xu realized the existence of the "script".
When the scene was fully staged before him, he couldn't help but shake his head and laugh.

"This is what you said, there's a bottle of true medicine here, you buy one bottle," the old man with yellow teeth grinned, "The one in my hand is already 300 gold coins, and this price is the standard sale price."

At this time, Zhao Xu seemed like a young man who couldn't believe what was happening before him. He casually picked up the blue-colored bottle from the other side, carefully examining the composition of the medicine inside.

Then, he lightly tapped the bottle body, making it sway.

"Young man, willing to bet and lose, this is how we people from the north do things."
Here is the translation:

"There's no mistake. Even if it means taking on a debt that will last for many years, it's worth it."

"If you're a coward, then don't start boasting from the beginning."

The people around him looked at his actions, unable to help but mock him.

Just then, Zhao Xu took out three vouchers from his pocket and handed them over, saying, "These are commercial goddess vouchers, each one worth 100 gold coins, exactly matching the 300 gold coin price of this bottle of 'Bull's Strength' potion."

The old man was overjoyed, took a look, and then realized that the vouchers were genuine.

However, he still refused to give up, saying, "But just now you said there was a real one, and you bought one."

Zhao Xu just smiled and said, "Wait."

He then lightly waved his hand in a mysterious gesture and chanted a simple incantation.

This seemingly ordinary action, which a child could learn, sent a shiver down the spines of the onlookers.

Especially, the last faint glow on Zhao Xu's palm lit up and then disappeared into the potion.

"I just cast the two-ring spell 'Transmute Potion', which can convert magical potions into explosive materials, which can be used as explosive remote ammunition."

"The blast radius is 3 meters, causing 2-12 points of damage, enough to leave civilians seriously injured."

As Zhao Xu finished speaking, he released his hand, and the bottle fell to the ground with a "pfft".

The bottle shattered.

"Ahh!" The onlookers, who had been watching with excitement, were startled and jumped back instinctively.

However, nothing happened.

At this moment, Zhao Xu was looking at the old man and the patrol officer with great amusement, their faces still stiff with shock.
Here's the translation:

"Originally, when I just saw this scene, I felt like if I were a stranger, I would feel so helpless."
"However, who says Arthur is someone who has the qualification to change the script of the world just because he's strong?"
"For this point, I still quite like it."
"Now, it's your turn to explain it to me."
