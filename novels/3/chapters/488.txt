Chapter 489: The Lord of the Abyss

Knowledge is power, and Arthur has never spoken without substance. Many secrets have been lost in the tumultuous history of Arthur, and some of these secrets can even allow a mortal to become a god on the spot. This is also part of the skill system in Arthur, where there are over ten types of "knowledge skills" that can be obtained simply by connecting to the source of knowledge, allowing countless mages to invest a large number of skill points.

Now, one of the three great demon lords who have witnessed the rise and fall of gods, is willing to reveal a piece of history to him. This is an opportunity that countless people have dreamed of but cannot attain.

Even with the evil curse cast by this demon lord, mages will still risk their lives to pursue this opportunity.

Only mages who have experienced hardship know that some "knowledge" is priceless.

At this moment, the demon lord Gralt, who is standing behind Zhao Xu, felt Zhao Xu's default attitude.

He couldn't help but laugh with satisfaction, like the rumbling sound of magma about to erupt.

"When we first met, you stood up for the mage Frank and wanted to retrieve a soul. At that time, you guaranteed the 'promise effect' and immediately summoned the power of the magic goddess Sisilvia."

"That divine power, through the nine-ring divine art 'miracle skill', no, it should be said that it is 'miraculous skill', formed an impenetrable cage, and blocked my abyssal power's invasion."

"Can you imagine that scene? For a lord of the abyss, what humiliation is that?"
Here is the translation of the text:

The demon lord Glazt spoke with a rising tone, infusing his words with a hint of regret.

Zhao Xu finally understood what he was saying.

He still underestimated the cost of provoking a demon lord.

If it weren't for that ninth circle mage Frank, who gave him the "Secret Silver Crystal" and "Legendary Death Spell Staff" and "Instant Summoning Staff", which could bring in over a million gold coins in subsequent income, this deal would have been a loss.

"The gods scatter their divine light, allowing devout and persevering believers to become pastors and perform miracles. However, this also involves the issue of costs and divine power limits. Otherwise, directly turning all believers into legendary pastors would allow Arthur to be completely controlled by a deity overnight, so you didn't know the value of your 'miracle arts' at the time."

"Although I sensed it, you were relying on the ability to possess the Holy Spirit to perform powerful divine arts. However, each miracle art is only possible after being inspected by the gods or having the endorsement of the gods themselves."

"A righteous pastor who uses divine arts to slaughter the innocent is guilty. However, using miracle arts to exterminate the souls of a city will only manifest the will of the gods like a prison, and the Church of Good God will not utter a word, but instead crown you as a saint."

Zhao Xu merely raised an eyebrow in disdain.

This demon lord Glazt deliberately kept quiet about the ancient history, just tossing out random things, and even instilled in him the concept of "doctrinal collapse". He looked down on Zhao Xu, who had been influenced by the soil of the homeland for ten years.

To put it bluntly, no one on earth can betray their own social class.
Here is the translation of the text:

Arthur, too, has no existence that can betray his true allegiance. The benevolent spirits of the benevolent camp will only depart from the benevolent camp and will not use cunning tactics to do something that betrays the camp. This is also the reason why mortals have an unparalleled faith in the spirits and respect the priests.

"So at that time, I was very curious as to why the magic goddess Sylvina favored you so. Especially Sylvina's temperament, which is different from some magic goddesses in the universe, who tend to descend from heaven and mingle with ordinary people, having children with them."

"As I paid attention, I discovered more wondrous elements. You are just an ordinary 1st-level priest, and a player at that. With various factors piling up, I believe you must have a very special place."

At this point, the voice of the demon lord Gralt became more excited and turbulent, and even began to tremble.

"In the end, my followers in the floating city of Mistral learned something. A mysterious player mage sat on the throne once occupied by the king of Faerie. When he performed the awakening ritual, a rainbow-colored glow poured down, and even..."

"Various speculations led me to focus my attention on your destiny."

"Mistral's floating city, which rejects the divine power of most spirits, will not stop the divine power of the magic goddess. This is also one of her few 'exclusive territories.' Therefore, with the power of destiny, she has already pre-selected me."

"This is the beginning of our entire story, about Arthur's origin and the creation myth of the twin snakes of order."

Just as the words fell silent, Zhao Xu seemed to feel the air around him moving at an incredible speed.

Mixed with the smell of sulfur and gunpowder, smoke billowed from the altar in front of him, continuously shooting out.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Genesis?" Zhao Xu spoke with a hint of surprise.

"Not wrong. This is a legend about the creation of the world and the prediction of its destruction. However, those who were fortunate enough to hear it initially mostly only heard a part of it. This includes the primordial gods, including me, the lord of the abyss, as well as the gods who ascended to the throne of the future. As for this, I only have a vague understanding."

"What is this legend and prediction about?" Zhao Xu's heart began to beat rapidly as he noticed.

Ernst immediately followed up with a question, "Ernst?"

The legend referred to past events, while the prediction was about the possibility of the future.

As for the destruction of the world, he had only just learned about it from Anniya, who had taken him to visit the elemental god Mosezelin just recently.

"Ah, ah. To know the full story, you need to ask Ernst to retell it from scratch. As for the prediction, I've only heard a part of it," Grazzt said with a hint of gritted teeth.

"Have you eaten your loss?" Zhao Xu counter-questioned.

"If Ernst had not intervened and deliberately induced such a prediction, how could my great Grazzt not unify the abyss until now?"

"Not even becoming the nominal 'overlord' or 'main ruler'?" Grazzt's anger intensified at this point.

Despite his immense power of control, he was still unable to suppress the anger in his chest, still recalling the past.

"What did he predict?" Zhao Xu asked, despite knowing it was not good, but he couldn't help but be curious.
Here is the translation of the text:

At first, no one could hear the "legend", and even after the "prophecy", it was just decent. "Hmm." Glazet's expression turned gloomy, as if the years of pent-up emotions had finally been unleashed.

"An ancient and eternal existence brings with it the consciousness of the world's birth, and the depths will welcome its true master. When that time comes, the river of the underworld will flow backwards, and a new bloodbath will spread across the world, determining the ultimate fate of destruction or rebirth."

"This doesn't make sense at all?" Zhao Xu thought for a moment, flipping through the original text, but couldn't find anything out of place.

How did Glazet, who was supposed to become the "master", get blocked?

Hearing the prophecy of the world's destruction, the demons would probably be ecstatic.

Chaos and evil have no moral principles.

Moreover, if this prophecy is inevitable, it's a miserable fate.

Glazet's tone of voice began to weaken, and Zhao Xu even saw the shadow in front of him sway.

"But it would wipe out all the leaders who have never witnessed the consciousness of the world's birth, including me.

With just one prophecy, I, who was about to become the 'co-master' through cunning and ambition, was pulled down from my horse."

"Those older demon lords, on the other hand, became more ambitious, thinking they would be the master of the underworld in the future, and immediately refused to submit to my rule."

"The originally converging forces, which went against the chaotic nature of the underworld, were directly torn apart by this prophecy."

"...".
Here is the translation of the text to English:

When Zhao Xu heard this, he didn't know whether it was a good omen or a bad one.

Witnessing the creation of the world, there was or there wasn't.

Last time, Ernest used prophecy to make Moszelein witness the ancient god of the world's birth. However, this renowned monarch - Glazet, known for his strength, has no connection to the "ancient" era.

The most ancient demon, if it really had the ability, would have unified most of the underworlds long ago, and wouldn't have let this upstart Glazet emerge.

"What did you find strange?" Zhao Xu asked, and at this moment, Glazet had the intention of becoming the "monarch", clearly the situation had changed.

"Because, the lord who heard this 'prophecy' initially misheard it. At that time, Ernest spoke out this prophecy in ancient hellish language, and the young lord misheard it, mistaking 'hell' for 'underworld'."

Suddenly, Zhao Xu felt as if a flock of crows flew past his ear.

Is this just a joke?
