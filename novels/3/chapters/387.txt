Chapter 388: Elite Force

After dinner with his high school classmates, Zhao Xu returned home, only to be scolded by Nán Xiǎo Wěi for leaving abruptly. Zhao Xu smiled calmly, but he carefully put the brooch An Ní Ní gave him into his wallet.

As he always carried his wallet, phone, and keys, Zhao Xu would instinctively pat his pocket to confirm their presence whenever he left a place.

After taking a bath, Zhao Xu returned to his bed and directly logged into the game. With a flash of light, he reappeared in the quiet mountain valley at night.

Salvia, his bodyguard, also appeared with a dazzling light, using advanced teleportation.

However, Zhao Xu's heart was still heavy.

Because he had just been told by An Ní Ní that the entire human civilization would be transported four months earlier than expected.

This meant that players' average level would be lower than before, and their accumulation would be less. This would undoubtedly lead to players' power being weaker at the beginning of the new timeline.

Even this news didn't surprise Zhao Xu as much, as he could understand why An Ní Ní could appear on Earth.

As a result, Arthur's external propaganda began to strengthen, trying to attract more players to the game to compensate for the original lack of ability.

Additionally, during these four months, Zhao Xu used the account "Dōng Chéng Ruì" to preach and proselytize on the forum, benefiting a large number of players.
Here is the translation of the text:

The average player level will definitely increase by one level. However, excluding him, the time it takes for players to reach a new level will definitely be shorter than before, and the number of high-level players will likely be more numerous as well. Therefore, when comparing the two, the advantage of saving four months of time will be barely offset.

However, this will undoubtedly bring about tremendous changes. For example, some players who normally spend a year to consume all their revives and start anew may now directly enter the game as a high-level player. On the other hand, players who entered the game eight months later in the previous life will miss this opportunity.

If an unexpected event had occurred in the previous life, causing players to have only eight months of gaming experience, then for him, it would be like directly crossing into a new life. If he had braved through the Black Dragon's attack, he would have lived a carefree life.

In the darkness of the night, ViVi stood with her sword still in hand, standing beside him. Zhao Xu could only sigh, "If the other party is a 'magical familiar', then my abilities can only target myself, such as the 'Ghost Strike' spell that ignores armor, and the 'Rhino Charge' spell that doubles the damage. These spells can not only benefit myself but also ViVi.

Magical familiars automatically share the mage's spells, so they can fight better than mages, and this is not a joke. This is also a rare but powerful school of magic in the mage's circles, known as the 'Magical Familiar' school.

"ViVi, what if we players were to truly enter this world?" Zhao Xu stood on a massive stone, gazing out at the valley's night scenery, feeling a sense of longing.
Here is the translation of the text:

Vivian is considered to be a May person, and he believes that the other party understands what he is saying. "This is great!" Vivian stood straight up, "Cut off all the past and start anew in a new world, isn't that the wish of many people?"

Zhao Xu reacted and asked, "What if time was accelerated, causing everyone's abilities to decline?"

The players lost not only their registered accounts but also their "resurrection stones", which would disappear four months earlier, meaning they missed out on four months of death experience.

"We are a part of the historical tide of the Arthurian legend, and we have our own radiant brilliance like the waves of the sea. Even the great demon lord 'Diemo Goren' was once blocked by a small group of Arthurian adventurers in the main material plane."

"The deterrent effect on the abyss is even greater than a large-scale war between the main material plane and the abyss. With our racial and professional abilities, we can exert an influence that is no longer ordinary."

Vivian stood behind Zhao Xu, looking at him. Zhao Xu was suddenly moved, having been educated since childhood to believe in collectivism. Even in the Battle of Star Lake, he still believed in the tidal wave-like assault of players. However, individual strength has always been something that Arthur cannot erase. Even with the buffs he has stacked, ordinary players cannot break through his defense. Not to mention that with his increasing ring numbers, these effects will continue to skyrocket.

At this moment, Zhao Xiu's gaze had become increasingly radiant.

In the distance, there were still groups of fleeing people who had set up camp and lit fires, as if the ground itself was bursting with starlight.

As long as he was strong enough.

What about the players who were weak?

As long as there was a sharp sword in the world that could easily kill the leaders of the West and North Alliance, even if Zhao Xiu had a group of a hundred million weak and powerless people behind him, these powerful forces would not dare to take action easily.

It's only high-end forces that are Arthur's greatest deterrent.

"That's right, Vivian, you're right," Zhao Xiu nodded.

His previous 12-month goal of level 9 had already fallen short of his expectations.

Even if he thought of accelerating time to 8 months, he would only reach level 10.

At level 10, he could begin to use the "Revival of the Dead" skill.

"That will do, let's take a break," Vivian said, pulling out a pile of tent-making tools, steel stakes, and a fabric frame from her dimensional bag.

Her intention was naturally to create a resting place for Zhao Xiu.

Zhao Xiu looked at the tent, feeling a sense of nostalgia.

The players below in the valley, when they went to sleep, would directly switch to offline mode and leave the misty fog of the abandoned ruins behind, freeing themselves from the limitation of unable to log off safely.

Therefore, the players were a group that did not need to worry about bugs like night raids.

Only during the entire people's crossing, would everyone start to worry, and in that wilderness, countless people could only sit on the ground to sleep, and it was only then that the players could escape from the tent.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

As soon as Zhao Xu sat inside the tent, he lit the oil lamp on the top of the tent and continued to read an occult textbook, holding it in his hands.

On the tea table in front of him, a scroll made of sheepskin was spread out, and the "automatic recording feather pen" he possessed was jumping up and down on it, infusing it with magical energy and writing spells. When he stopped writing, it became a valuable scroll worth hundreds of gold coins containing the Three-Ring Magic spell.

Once Zhao Xu reached level 9 and obtained unlimited potential points, he could freely restore his previous spells. These scrolls would continue to be a valuable source of magical energy for him.

Meanwhile, Wei Wei'an was slowly removing her armor, although her full-body silver armor was relatively lightweight. However, its intricate components made it difficult for ordinary people to put it on or take it off.

"Have you ever fought in a battle?" Zhao Xu suddenly asked Wei'an with curiosity.

"No," Wei'an replied with a decisive shake of her head. "We're like the gift prepared by Lady Night. She wouldn't let her gift be damaged."

"That's why I think you should start with a full-power strike, leaving no room for retreat," Zhao Xu said.

Wei'an wrinkled her brow slightly at this, "This is what Lady Night taught me. She said I should quickly master the use of 'Break the Curse' so that I can strike first and eliminate any chance of retreat."

"Is Lady Night planning something for you?" Zhao Xu was astonished.

Wei'an nodded, "Yes, Lady Night suggested that I gain the ability to dispel, and then use it to obtain 'God's Gift' and strengthen my 'Break the Curse' spell."

"'God's Gift'?" Zhao Xu, although not a saint warrior, was still curious about how saint warriors strengthened themselves.
Here is the translation of the text:

"This is a specialty, it can consume the number of dispel times to allow my attack damage to stack with charm adjustments."

Zhao Xu couldn't help but gaze at Viola's "Holy Avenger" in her hand, and indeed, Viola's 8 charm adjustments had paired well with this skill, showing no small amount of power.

Even combining his strengthened weapon's spell with his own thoughts, he had already thought of an unbeatable strategy.

If Viola's attack power was sufficient, wouldn't it be a legendary feat to kill with a single stroke?

At this point, she continued to say, "With the ability to dispel and 1st-level divine magic, the May Lady said that if I was calm and collected, I could advance to a mysterious profession - the Skeletal Knight."

"It's also a mysterious advancement from the Multi-Dimensional Universe, and can be considered the strongest advancement for a War Cleric profession."

Zhao Xu himself had 1st-level Cleric ability, and War Cleric was considered a relatively strong school of thought, so he was curious, "What are the characteristics of this advancement?"

Viola then slightly tilted her head, "It mainly allows for the acquisition of a vast amount of immunity status, as well as special abilities such as stunning, bleeding, crushing, sleep-inducing, poisonous, paralyzing, instant death, fatigue, and physical attribute damage, attribute absorption, energy absorption, etc."

As Viola was listing the abilities of this advancement, Zhao Xu silently began to think about his own 9th-level divine magic advancements.

Having these immunities would undoubtedly make him a war beast on the battlefield.

Just as Zhao Xu was trying to ask, he suddenly felt a violent tremor coming from the ground.

Immediately, a loud rumbling sound followed.
