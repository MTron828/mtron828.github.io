Chapter 555: Who is the Midsummer?

"Ah?"

"What's happening?"

Slowly, the patrons of the entire bar gazed up at the stars in the sky, wondering, "When did we find out there would be a meteor shower tonight?"

However, these questions were met with no response.

The "Warning Alert" sounded, and the long, drawn-out sound filled the night sky across the entire city.

At the same time, all the news apps synchronized and broadcast the mysterious event of the falling stars.

The singer below suddenly stopped singing, and the noise from the bar patrons above was misinterpreted as poor singing.

"Ahhh!"

"It's a global meteor shower of enormous magnitude." One patron saw the latest news and almost fainted on the spot.

At that moment, countless patrons who had received the news were frozen with their phones, paralyzed by the ominous title on the screen.

The sound of sirens from outside police cars had already begun, and all the emergency vehicles were rushing to the scene.

Some believers even began to pray on the spot.

All the emergency plans and defense mechanisms had failed, as the meteor shower was about to hit the Earth in just a few minutes.

"Don't be afraid," Zhao Xu comforted the two people who were getting anxious.

At that moment, he calmly sat down, held up his cup of wine, and said to Wang Qingwei and Zheng Xin'an, "Next time we meet, it will be in Avalon."

"Yes, see you tomorrow." Wang Qingwei quickly regained her composure and lightly touched cups with Zhao Xu.

However, Zhao Xu's heart was still tense. He knew that "God is not in July" was not as simple as it sounded.
Here is the translation of the text:

The entire period of time spent traveling for a month has undoubtedly meant that Arthur is facing a tremendous change at this moment.

Although he has traveled to many places during this month, visiting many old friends and witnessing many grand mountains, he has ultimately missed a crucial month.

However, Zhao Xu, who is never flustered, has sufficient confidence to cope with everything that has happened to Arthur.

He nodded silently, continuing to gaze at the meteorite that is growing larger and larger above.

At this moment, some hotel guests have gone mad, screaming hysterically and crying out, "I don't want to die! What are we going to do?"

As they cry, the sound spreads and more people try to call their loved ones back home. However, at this moment, not only the densely populated city of Magadha, but the entire Chinese nation and even the entire Earth, are occupied by excessive communication applications, causing a temporary signal overload.

Even X-signal communication tools are displaying disconnections on the spot.

"Run!" someone suddenly shouts, looking up at the increasingly large meteorite.

As people look around, they frantically search for a place to hide.

"Go to the air raid shelter! It's essentially a shelter from the air!" someone yells, and soon a few bar customers rush towards the stairs. However, they find that it's already blocked and can only push and shove to get through.

Meanwhile, more customers are hiding under the tables, as if hiding from the meteorite attack.

As for the rare trio, they just smile at each other, saying, "If we really die..."

"That's that," they say, looking at each other.

However, now it seems that the chaotic crowd is even more dangerous.
Here is the translation:

Zhao Xu jokingly said, "Won't happen." He had already felt a familiar power stirring within him.

"Restore potential node magic position."
"Force ball!"

As soon as Zhao Xu finished speaking, a translucent, intangible energy sphere appeared around him, just large enough to encompass the three of them.

This way, the original customers who had been rushing to escape, now found themselves blocked by this force ball, unable to enter the small wooden table area.

"The path has been opened, and I feel energy constantly flowing into my body," Zhao Xu concluded.

"I'm the same," Wang Qingwei said slowly, about six seconds after Zhao Xu.

At this time, Zhao Xu's body also began to synchronize with his previous magical equipment.

The "Stellar Cloak" that could resist weak attacks, the "Great Sage's Robe" with multiple effects, and various wands, staffs, and intelligence headpieces all appeared on his body, one by one.

"A god, save us!" someone suddenly exclaimed, noticing the strange changes on Zhao Xu's side.

A forty-year-old man rushed over, but was blocked by the force ball's protective barrier. He frantically waved his hands and feet, shouting to Zhao Xu as he gestured.

"Mind control."

Zhao Xu looked at the other person, then lightly waved his hand, saying, "Don't you think sitting quietly would be more effective?"

As soon as Zhao Xu finished speaking, the man who had cried out for help nodded unintentionally and quietly sat back down, looking somewhat dazed.

"It seems that the heart of the gods' protection has dissipated."

Zhao Xu sighed.

After crossing over, everyone appeared before the gods, and it was truly as clear as a blank sheet of paper.
Here is the translation:

"As the meteorite continued to descend, Zheng Xin'an gazed at it in awe. 'Don't look up at the sky, take another look at this world,' Zhao Xu joked. 'Ah, I knew I should have invited Tao tonight,' Zheng Xin'an also regretted.

Just as they were lost in thought, the meteorite suddenly burst into a dazzling light. The streets, which had been empty moments before, were now congested with cars, and the fire spread slowly across the city, illuminated by the original streetlights.

The chaotic street scene was filled with people who had been petrified by the divine light. They stood still, their eyes gradually losing their luster. The pedestrians found they had no strength to move their bodies, as if they were puppets controlled by someone else.

It was as if their souls were trapped in their bodies, with only their consciousness flowing. 'According to the will of the gods, open the portal to the sky and the earth, and transport all earthlings to the land of Arthur's descent,' someone said.

'After receiving the blessing of the gods, we will take responsibility for life and death,' someone else added.

The meteorite, as if frozen in mid-air, suddenly emitted an icy voice. Although most people were bewildered, no one knew what 'Arthur' meant.

However, those who had seen the 'Arthur's departure' news a month ago suddenly recalled the 'time-travel' rumors. But no one thought that a myth could become reality.

The once-ridiculed myth was now verified, and those who missed the opportunity could only regret their decision."
At this moment, all souls are confined within human bodies on earth, and everyone is eager to ask the question: What kind of world is Arthur? Only players who have previously entered the game can maintain the slightest composure, quietly recalling the game content that has been isolated for a month.

Even the slowest players understand that their future life will be different.

"Notice: All players who have entered the Arthur's Earth, from the highest-level adventurer 'Summer' to the last one, will retain their final in-game state, and all remaining revival stones will be recovered."

"Hey, Summer, are you scared?" Suddenly, a voice dialogue from the heavenly kingdom above, unlike the original icy tone, suddenly echoed.

Deeply penetrating every human being's heart.

 Ding!

The next moment, all souls vanished from their bodies.

However, the last lingering memory left behind still retained one question.

Who is Summer?
