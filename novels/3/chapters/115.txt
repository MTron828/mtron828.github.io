Chapter 116: The Abyss

As he looked back, he saw a blue-eyed forest ranger wearing chain armor, riding a horse with a furious expression, chasing after him. The arrow that had just been shot was from the opponent's hand-held longbow.

Looking at that face, Zhao Xu already understood that the guard who had just been shot and removed his helmet was likely to have a deep connection with the person in front of him.

But Zhao Xu was helpless. This kind of thing was clearly a case of mistaken identity, and yet the opponent was still chasing after him.

In the blink of an eye, the opponent controlled the warhorse with his legs and lifted his hands to draw the bow and arrow again.

Zhao Xu saw this and could only lift his hand to prepare to release a spell.

He had only used two first-level spells today, and the one called "Summon Mount" was released through the efforts of a multi-talented spellcaster.

However, Zhao Xu was not on flat ground, and the intense jolting of the mount was extremely affecting his spellcasting. It was like someone sitting in a jump machine, trying to maintain their composure while taking photos.

The horse's hooves continued to gallop on the muddy grass, but Zhao Xu was unable to keep up with the opponent.

Suddenly, the second arrow flew towards him with a breaking sound.

Zhao Xu was in the middle of casting a spell when he heard the sound and quickly performed a defensive dodge. However, he found that the arrow was not targeting him, but had fallen straight onto the summoned mount he was riding.

The horse let out a cry of pain and fell sideways, and Zhao Xu was exposed without any chance of recovery.

Even though Zhao Xu was tightly grasping the reins and clutching the saddle, he was still unable to slow down his fall.
Here is the translation of the text:

The adventurer, Zhao Xū, focused his attention and cast a spell, rolling a 12 on his dice roll, exceeding the difficulty of 11 and successfully casting the spell. Just as Zhao Xū fell off his horse, his focus skill kicked in, forcing him to maintain the spellcasting pose.

Zhao Xū's mind cleared instantly, and he recited the incantation of the "Oil Slipping" spell: "Oil Slipping!" The spell's glow directly fell on the opponent's path.

The opponent, a ranger, was chasing after Zhao Xū on horseback, unaware of the three-meter-by-three-meter oil slick that had appeared in front of the horse's hooves. The ranger continued to charge towards Zhao Xū, looking as if he was going to trample him under the horse's hooves.

However, when the horse's hooves entered the oil slick, it lost its balance and stumbled to the side, as if dancing on ice without non-slip shoes. The ranger, also wearing chain armor, fell off his horse and rolled around twice.

Zhao Xū, who had fallen off his horse earlier, was slower to get up due to his lower physical attributes. He struggled to stand up, bearing the pain in his body. However, he did not cast another spell. Instead, he took out an Aether Stone from his backpack and released it into the air.

Zhao Xū had realized that the Aether Stone, worth 36,000 gold coins, was a burden. He usually didn't carry it, as it didn't match his 2nd-level equipment. He thought it would be more convenient to use an amulet with a built-in blessing ritual instead of waiting until the last minute to release the Aether Stone.

As Zhao Xū held the Aether Stone above his head, he felt the stone's power coursing through him, increasing his spellcaster level by 1 level.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu looked down at the forest ranger who had fallen to the ground, trying to struggle back up several times. He smiled coldly and immediately cast the first-tier spell "Shield" on himself.

He was well aware that these six seconds were a precious opportunity for him, but a first-tier spell was not enough to kill these high-potential players who had started the game.

Other players with 15-20 points of talent would often have to make sacrifices, such as sacrificing their physical attributes.

However, Zhao Xu's magic missile or crossbow attack was no match for the forest ranger's D8 life die. Facing someone with such a high life die, 8-12 HP was not easily resolved.

So he chose to cast the same first-tier spell "Shield" that could increase his defense by 4 levels.

For the past few days, he had been learning spells in his spare time and had already reached the level of a novice mage.

Long ago, Luo Ya had given him a Tower Shield, which was almost as tall as a person and could increase his defense by almost 4 levels.

On the other hand, "Shield" could create a completely hidden and Tower Shield-sized force shield that rotated around the caster's face.

With the combination of these two spells, Zhao Xu's defense ability reached 18 levels or more, making it impossible for ordinary people to penetrate his defense.

Just as the forest ranger had finally managed to get back up with his own strength, Zhao Xu looked at him with a mixture of disdain and confidence.

He had already recognized that Zhao Xu had cast "Mage Armor" and "Oil Slip" to knock his horse down.

Now, Zhao Xu was left with only zero-level tricks that he could use.

"You're going to die!" the forest ranger roared. "Snap!" The bowstring snapped, and the arrow flew straight towards Zhao Xu.
Here is the translation:

After the tumultuous journey on horseback, not only did Zhao Xu's magical skills become easier, but so did the skills of the hunter who accompanied him. However, just as the arrow shot by the hunter was about to hit Zhao Xu, it suddenly let out a dull thud and broke off, falling to the ground like a bird that had flown into a plane without realizing its own strength. The hunter looked at the broken arrow and realized that something was amiss. "How is this possible? How can you still cast the shield spell?" he exclaimed. "Who are you? You're definitely not an ordinary player!"

Zhao Xu was taken aback, realizing that the hunter was also a player. It was natural for players to kill other players, and the hunter's relentless pursuit was a testament to his bravery. "You can ask the creator of the Holy Temple about this," Zhao Xu said with a smile, lifting his crossbow to aim at the hunter.

As a dual-class character with both mage and cleric professions, Zhao Xu possessed three first-level spells as a 2nd-level mage with intelligence and three first-level spells as a cleric. He could also convert zero-level spells into first-level spells, earning him three more first-level spell slots. Therefore, Zhao Xu could cast nine first-level spells, far surpassing the abilities of ordinary 1st-level mages.

"Ha ha, although you have cast the shield spell and worn the mage's armor, I know that your shield spell can only last for one minute. After one minute, I can definitely kill you," Zhao Xu said.
Here is the translation of the text:

After realizing there was no hope, the wandering guest immediately drew his curved sword from his waist, gazing at Zhao Xu like a hunter stalking prey. He had already prepared himself, ready to chase Zhao Xu no matter which direction he fled. "Foolishness," Zhao Xu said, releasing the trigger of his finger.

In that instant, the magical power imbued him with the ability to sense the world, akin to a god's blessing. Meanwhile, the wanderer raised his other hand, holding a small round shield, and dodged to the side.

Facing an incompetent mage who couldn't attack, the wanderer wasn't worried that he would be hit. However, the arrow shot by Zhao Xu flew straight at the wanderer's heart, as if it had a life of its own.

Just as Zhao Xu had shot the arrow, the wanderer had already cast the spell "Quicken" and successfully hit the target, dealing 8 points of damage, putting Zhao Xu in a state of near-death.

Unfortunately, the crossbow needed to be reloaded, unlike a handgun, which could be quickly reloaded.

When the wanderer shot at Zhao Xu again, he had already completed another spell, "Quicken". This spell allowed him to gain an extraordinary level of insight into his next attack.

With this state of affairs, Zhao Xu's random attack would be as powerful as a 20th-level warrior's attack.

In a world where most defense relied on armor, this spell was powerful enough to make mages arrogant and allow them to fight anyone they pleased.

This was the first time this spell had been used in physical attacks.

If a 1st-level mage had unlimited 1st-level spell slots, they would be able to become a perfect marksman, hitting their target twice in two rounds.
Here is the translation of the text:

As the patron of the forest, who had lost consciousness, Zhao Xu didn't show much mercy and sent him back to the creation temple directly. The player characters, who had been killed by their own projection, were not truly dead, just like the summoned creatures of the curse system. Therefore, the degree of Zhao Xu's tilt didn't seem high, let alone the fact that the other party had a deep hostility towards him from the beginning. After completing these tasks, Zhao Xu didn't feel happy.

As he watched the thick smoke rising from the distant signal, he realized that he had appeared at the perfect moment, and was considered to be one of the shockwave teams. If he dared to take another step forward, he would definitely be hit with a combination of iron fists, without any explanation.

...Over the next two days, Zhao Xu had no choice but to start learning the strategy of nocturnal wandering.

During this period, he had an experience of being chased by a violent bear that had been hunting at night, and he was miserable all night long. However, after spending two days, Zhao Xu finally approached the North Castle.

The North Castle was far from the cities of Kaso and Butan, and to him, it was like a powder keg, and he didn't dare to get close again.

Although Zhao Xu had not invested in survival skills and could not rely on survival skills to obtain food, he did not have too much pressure in his daily life, just like a wild man living on the edge of the South Island Forest. After extinguishing the fire in the cave, Zhao Xu prepared to set out again.

For the past few days, the whole South Island Forest had been experiencing non-stop torrential rains, and even his own magic tricks couldn't dry his clothes, which was exhausting.
Here is the translation of the text:

This time, Zhao Xu still gathered some firewood and put it in a convenient bag. As soon as it rained heavily, he would start a fire to dry off and wait for the rain to stop before continuing on his journey.

However, as he approached the cave exit, the sky remained dark and gloomy, as if a even bigger storm was brewing.

Zhao Xu hesitated, wondering whether to wait or continue on. But thinking about the nearby Northern City and the possibility of returning to the Floating City to learn about the legendary scholars, he couldn't help but feel excited and his legs quickened his pace as he stepped out of the cave.

However, as soon as Zhao Xu took a step out of the cave, his face darkened, as if he had been struck by ice.

The original landmark of the South Island Forest was the towering ancient trees, but what Zhao Xu saw now was the main force of the Heavenly Union of the North - over two hundred heavily armed cavalrymen, standing proudly and loudly.

No one would have thought that a cavalry unit could quietly surround the cave entrance without making too much noise.

However, what really made Zhao Xu's heart sink was the sight of his companions from the past, now dressed in prisoner's clothing, with their faces looking dejected. The entire caravan, including over 50 people, was kneeling on the ground, facing him. The leader of the group, a young man wearing luxurious clothing, was standing beside a few sorcerers dressed in robes, looking down at Zhao Xu with a condescending gaze.
Zhao Xiu knew that the person approaching him was not well-intentioned, but the other party did not hesitate to surround him, indicating that they could still talk. He immediately pulled out a certification document issued by the Moon Tooth Federation of Mages from his backpack.

"Boom!" A loud thunderclap echoed through the sky, foreshadowing the true and long-awaited heavy rain that had been delayed for several days, as if it was about to arrive.

"Hello, Mr. Zhongxia, I'd like to introduce myself. I'm Taik, a member of the Heavenly Alliance, and soon to be the ninth elder," said the young man in a luxurious robe, with an air of arrogance and no wonder he was proud.

The other elders of the Heavenly Alliance were now all his uncle's age.

"What do you want to ask?" Zhao Xiu said, originally intending to hand over the blue-sealed certification document in his hand, but was suddenly stopped.

"There's nothing to ask, I just heard from your former comrades that you obtained something from a mage in that mine," Taik said with a proud smile.

Zhao Xiu's heart sank.

At that time, he had not hidden the fact that Lyra, the mage, had given him a book. He couldn't be sure that no one else had seen Lyra give him something.

The transparent force field of the prison made Zhao Xiu think that since no one knew about the secret, he had to pretend it was a book on magic techniques in the end.

"Ha ha, don't worry about it," Taik said, as if he had seen Zhao Xiu's expression, and comforted him with a wide smile: "This leader of Luo Ya is indeed remarkable, he has endured many cruel tortures and has not revealed his experiences in the mine."
Here is the translation:

"All his companions, including Rock, lacked the determination, and everything was revealed. So, I want you to give me that small booklet, and I'll return these people to you, but the goods can only be considered as a token of my good faith."

"You say that's enough to be benevolent enough?" Tak, the young man in the Chinese traditional dress, showed a triumphant smile.

"That's a beautiful thought," Zhao Xu smiled.
