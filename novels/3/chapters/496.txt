Chapter 497: Becoming the Lord of the Manor

At this moment, the person reporting to the leader, Tang De, looked nervous and hesitant, and the leader himself seemed to react with surprise, asking, "What are their demands? They managed to secretly infiltrate the leader's office, and their skills are indeed impressive."

Tang De gritted his teeth and spoke, but everyone could sense the impending explosion of anger.

"'She, they,'" the guard who had come to report trembled as he spoke, "The six sisters are demanding that we release the hostages we captured earlier, which includes their younger brother, who was recently captured. If not, they threaten to... and even go so far as to..."

The guests around the table, who knew the details, changed color upon hearing the names of the six sisters. Even a few noble maidens couldn't help but shudder, as if recalling the sisters' previous heinous crimes.

It was said that after the hostages were rescued, they were left in a state of "walking dead," barely alive.

Among the guests were people who had been wronged by the six sisters, and they all wore expressions of gritted teeth.

Tang De scanned the crowd, noticing one of his trusted subordinates signaling to him to ask privately, without revealing the embarrassing truth in public.

However, Tang De seemed to be stimulated, his face flushing red, and he shouted, "Tell me, what kind of threats did they make against us?"

At the same time, his hand tightened around the hilt of his sword, his wrist veins bulging, revealing an expression of great concern and anger.
The reporting guard paused, his voice trembling as he replied, "The six sisters said that if we have any other intentions, we should expect to receive parts of their bodies every two hours."

Upon hearing this, several girls who had recently become close to Frey, as well as guests who had quietly placed bets on both sides, couldn't help but exclaim in shock.

Upon hearing this, Zhao Xu's face also darkened.

Some ruthless bandits and thieves, even when sending "kidnapping letters," would include a piece of the victim's thumb in the letter.

Many times, this would immediately destroy the psychological defenses of the entire family, ultimately allowing the bandits to do as they pleased.

Even if Frey and Lady Ellie were rescued and could use the "regeneration spell" of the seventh ring to restore their bodies, the physical and mental trauma could not be undone.

"And, the six sisters also made a very special request. They specified that a player must personally carry the hostage and drive a carriage to the designated location in the Icefield Mountains. Then, they will come out at the designated time and go offline on the spot."

"They will have people observing the area, and if they see anyone else, they will immediately tear up the ticket. After Miss Frey and Lady Ellie are safe, they will tell us where to retrieve them from."

"And they have threatened us not to play any tricks. At some point on the road, they will leave a mark in a conspicuous place. If the escort cannot answer or prove that they are a player, they will also tear up the ticket."

Upon hearing this, everyone present's face changed drastically.

At that moment, Tang De's confidant, a middle-aged aide with a mustache, whispered, "It's very likely that the location they disclosed is just the first one, and we will only find out the second location when we get there. They might even have set up a means to block mental communication there."
Here is the translation of the text:

"Isn't it a clever plan? Just wait for us to take the bait. Even after we release the hostages, it's up to the six sisters' mood whether we can go back or not, and it's really good, really very good." At this moment, Tang De's anger suddenly turned into a sarcastic laugh, and he praised the others.

"Go call Nash, the great wizard, here and ask him to come and discuss the matter," Tang De said, his expression suddenly changing.

Zhao Xu also thought deeply about this.

It has to be said that this group of six sisters with magical support is indeed formidable.

They demanded that the players escort them, and then suppressed the possibility of Tang De's side selecting strong candidates.

They also required the players to log off, and opponents would be unable to log back on for 20 minutes.

Even if the opponent had extraordinary abilities, they wouldn't be able to break through.

Zhao Xu suddenly felt that, apart from the lamp lights shining on him in the banquet hall, everyone's gaze was slowly focusing on him.

With anticipation and estimation.

Freel, who was standing beside him, was originally hopeless about his own sister, but now a glimmer of hope had appeared.

"Tang De, sir," Zhao Xu said, "Let's go to the inner hall to discuss the matter."

The guards also knew their limits and didn't reveal the location and time of the hostage exchange.

"Okay," Zhao Xu nodded slightly, following the high-ranking officials of the Northern Alliance, including himself, out of the banquet hall.

At this moment, Zhao Xu's pace slowed down, and he disappeared from the sight of the banquet hall guests.

However, no one in the scene dared to oppose this, especially the edge players who looked on with pride.

If there was anyone who could overcome the notorious six sisters at this moment, it was only this wizard, Zhao Xu.

If Zhao Xu couldn't defeat the six sisters with ease, no other player could.
When Vice President Nash, the head of the Northern Alliance Mage Association branch, arrived, everyone present bowed slightly to greet him, except Tangde, who just nodded and maintained his composure.

Immediately, the guard on the side explained the whole process to Nash in detail.

Upon hearing this, the elderly but still agile and spirited old mage shook his head, "The other party's request is actually to prevent the intervention of spellcasters."

Regardless of the requirements of the other party, a mage can disguise themselves through shapeshifting and other means, and even communicate without being exposed due to their strong knowledge system. 

However, players, due to the differences in the knowledge systems of the two worlds, have inherent obstacles and are difficult to disguise. 

And the players, who are mostly low-level, can easily be killed by any of the Six Sisters if they are deployed.

They just need to focus on the most critical pursuers.

"But the Six Sisters never expected that the current number one player, Mr. Zhongxia, happened to arrive in Oru City," Freyr couldn't help but speak up.

The commanders and ministers of various key departments of the Alliance have all received urgent orders and have come here to discuss this matter.

Nash, who has become a wise man, also followed the gaze and looked at Zhao Xu in front of him, "I didn't expect that there would really be a Fourth Ring Mage among the players. According to our previous speculation, reaching the Third Ring already requires an understanding of the component structure of spells."

"If there is no such intelligence and experience, even with the blessing of the gods, it is impossible to break through the barrier of the Third Ring."

In just a few words, everyone realized the extraordinary nature of Zhongxia, and their expressions became more serious as they looked at him.
Mage Nash's words are very simple.
Even in midsummer, even if he is not a player, he can still reach the current height with his ability.
As for Zhao Xu, he knows how he managed to reach level 7, but he just smiled and did not deny it.
Although he actually relies on his intelligence to synchronize and understand the extremely complex spell models.
"Nice to meet you, young man," Mage Nash unexpectedly placed his one-meter-long black jade staff on the ground, making a crisp sound.
"Vice President of the Northern Branch of the Mage Association in the Northern Alliance City of Oru, Nine-Ring Mage, Nash."
With this self-introduction, even the few remaining arrogant nobles who were still looking at Zhao Xu couldn't help but frown, and their evaluation of his importance increased.
Even they couldn't remember the last time Mage Nash introduced himself to another low-level mage.
At this moment, even Freyr, excited, knew that everyone had forgotten the time when this midsummer mage first started playing the game.
It was only over four months ago!
As for Zhao Xu, he also put down his "Super Magic Instantaneous Staff" made of all metal and placed it on the ground with the same courtesy.
He nodded and said, "Mister La, President of the Fallen Star Town Branch of the Mage Association, Midsummer, a Fourth-Ring Mage."
A stone stirred a thousand waves!
Even though he had already thought he had shown enough respect and humility towards the new mage, Mage Nash's face changed several times when he heard the title "President".
He had not been unaware of any news.
Previously, he had already known that the headquarters would soon send a mage to serve as vice president.
Just suddenly, it's already at this level?
President!
Even in the internal council of this alliance, those who heard the position with "amazed" eyes, looking at these midsummer high-level officials, still cannot imagine what the position of "president" really means.
Even if it's just a "president of the Mage Association" at the level of a small town, it means that, in the ranks of the Mage Association in midsummer, he has entered the "core training sequence".
It can even match the level of a vice president of a town.
As long as this midsummer mage can take root in the Northern Alliance for ten years and successfully promote to the seventh circle, then there is no need to doubt the successor of Mage Nash in the future.
If Nash successfully takes over the position of president, it is not impossible to see Zhao Xu as his deputy one day.
Reaching the top in one step, nothing more than this.
At this moment, Mage Nash couldn't help but feel a little dazed, thinking about how old he was when he became the president of the association in a small town.
"Mr. Midsummer, it really exceeds everyone's expectations to have such talent," Lord Tand said with a big laugh at this time.
As he spoke, his gaze towards Zhao Xu became extremely gentle, and even with anticipation.
"So, our alliance cannot fall behind others."
"So, Mr. Midsummer, I also implore you here to be the player chosen for this 'escort hostage' mission."
"As long as Frey and Ellie can return safely, I will grant you the jurisdiction of the territory of 'Falling Star Town', which happens to be under my name, afterwards."
As soon as these words came out, the members of the alliance's high-level personnel were all in an uproar, but under the accumulated power of the Mage Association for many years, no one actively refuted.
At this moment, Zhao Xu couldn't help but feel a little dazed too.
Among the players, the opportunity to be the first to enter the territory and become an official "lord" was actually placed in front of him.
At that time, the three major powers of territory rights, divine rights, and spell rights in the world of Arthur will all be held by a player named Midsummer in this remote town of Fallen Star.
