Chapter 656: Mysterious Sea

As the three-colored blood moon hung high in the sky, Zhao Xu had already grasped the unusual "Fiery Angel Painting" in the high tower, waiting for An Ti Noya to arrive.

After experiencing the perilous underground tunnel, Zhao Xu, who had grasped the Iron Heart Power and the Silver Fire, was still cautious. The deep abyss, to him, was still a forbidden place.

Although Zhao Xu had not detected any remnants of the six-armed snake demon from the mysterious painting, the mysterious portal glowing with blue light, like the abyss's call, still made him wary.

Zhao Xu added another "Identification Technique" to the painting, but the result showed that it was just a normal painting.

At first glance, the "Mysterious Portal" suspended in the painting seemed like a deceptive optical illusion.

"Dong... dong..."
As the morning bell rang, announcing the start of the "Curfew" that prohibited roaming, the originally bustling city slowly returned to its former quietness.

A familiar footsteps sound echoed behind Zhao Xu, and he turned around to see An Ti Noya reappear.

"Looks like you've gained something," An Ti Noya asked with a strange gaze.

"Just ask your teacher to identify it," Zhao Xu said, handing her the painting.

"Interesting," An Ti Noya said, wearing a white wool coat with a hint of pink, with some rainwater dripping from her hem.

"It has deeper secrets?"
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu couldn't help but ask, "Is it really just a coincidence that my luck is so good? I just casually mentioned the Abyssal Tome, and you're already connecting it to something?"

Annie looked at him with her sparkling eyes, her gaze fixed on him.

"In fact, I'm also surprised. I just casually mentioned the Abyssal Tome, and I didn't expect you to connect it to something so quickly."

"This has made me somewhat suspicious - is it fate or arrangement?"

This sentence almost made Zhao Xu's hair stand on end, and he even felt an instinctive urge to "release the explosive" and abandon the oil painting.

It was as if the mysterious carvings on the wooden frame were exuding an evil curse, spreading a fierce roar from the depths of the abyss.

"The Abyssal Tome?"

Zhao Xu was shocked, but he quickly regained his composure.

"No, it's just a copy of the Abyssal Tome mentioned by our teacher, Ahham's Dark Tome?"

As he said this, he examined the oil painting from multiple angles, but couldn't detect any aura of a holy artifact.

"It seems that you really remember every word I said, but unfortunately, we've been apart for some time, so you haven't had a chance to go back to the library to browse the relevant materials."

As he spoke, Annie placed the oil painting on the stone table at the top of the tower, gazing at it for a moment before explaining.

"Ahham is indeed one of the most outstanding individuals who have studied the Abyss since the time of King Arthur, and one of the few who have read the Abyssal Tome without being corrupted."

"Eventually, he rewrote the contents of the Abyssal Tome and became 'Ahham's Dark Tome'."
Here is the translation of the text:

For centuries, although Ahham, the wise explorer who delved into the depths, had disappeared, his intention was still being carried out by the "Black Sect", which had been passed down. This organization continued to expand and record the knowledge of demonology in "scrolls". Over time, these mysterious scrolls became imbued with the power of the depths and became divine or quasi-divine artifacts. Therefore, the term "Ahham's Dark Scroll" referred to this series of artifacts derived from the "Deep Scroll".

Asa Niyoga's expression turned puzzled, "Generally, these artifacts are stored in the sect's branch bases or held by prominent members of the organization. Few are leaked outside, and it's a rare occurrence for someone to obtain one."

Zhao Xu finally understood that their casual imitation had inadvertently revealed such a profound secret.

"So, I'm holding a quasi-divine artifact," Zhao Xu sighed. Neither the wandering soul nor Liu Aunt would have thought that they had unknowingly come into contact with a quasi-divine artifact.

"It's true," Asa Niyoga replied, "You do have a connection with the artifact, and you've encountered it multiple times, but it's rare for someone to actually possess one."

Just as Asa Niyoga was about to continue, she straightened her expression.

"Summer solstice."

"Although Ahham's Dark Scroll is diverse, with chapters numbering in the hundreds, some are simply a single sheet of paper, while others can be bound into books. Don't underestimate them."

"According to current recognized research, Ahham's Dark Scroll is the only path to the 'Deep Scroll', which records knowledge of the depths, demons, and related subjects."

Zhao Xu nodded and intently memorized the style of the oil painting at that moment.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Teacher, besides recording knowledge, what are the special effects or costs of these dark scrolls?"

"Of course."

Annie confirmed, "These artifacts can grant skills and even special powers to the owner, divided into secondary and advanced levels."

"However, every time you use the power of the dark scrolls, there will be a cumulative probability of summoning creatures from the underworld, with a 1% chance for secondary-level and around 5% for high-level. Once summoned, these creatures will go berserk and attack the user until they are destroyed and the scroll is obtained."

"One can only reset the summoning probability by destroying the underworld creatures."

Zhao Xiu couldn't help but carefully look at the oil painting on the stone table - "Dark Scrolls".

Is it possible that the "Interdimensional Gate" in the painting is a secondary or high-level power? If he uses it, he might end up facing a creature from the underworld?

It's worth noting that each use is like rolling a dice to determine the probability.

Moreover, if the probability reaches 100%, it will be extremely difficult, and if it exceeds 50%, each use will be equivalent to walking on thin ice.

However, Zhao Xiu was still uncertain, especially when there are many dark scrolls.

"Teacher, I'm not too worried, but can other owners really avoid these underworld creatures? And if they die and the dark scrolls are taken by the underworld creatures, what will happen?"

"Of course."

Annie glanced at the triple moon in the night sky, rumored to be the incarnation of gods.
"When creating the Scroll of Darkness, the cult took this into consideration, so they added magic to each scroll to repel demons. As long as there is any demon born from the abyss within 10 meters, it will automatically accumulate a 10% chance each round to trigger teleportation or interdimensional transfer to leave the current location."

"If this escape ability is activated, the probability of summoning a hell creature will also be reset to 0%."

"What if a hell creature gets hold of the Scroll of Darkness?" Zhao Xu asked.

"As long as a creature from the abyss gains ownership of the Scroll of Darkness, it will lose some teleportation abilities and other powers. Any demon who obtains the Scroll of Darkness of Ahham will immediately carry it back to the abyss."

Zhao Xu's heart was filled with mixed emotions.

This means that the six-armed snake demon is not possessed within this painting, otherwise the other party would have already discovered the secret.

Even the other party did not trigger the teleportation effect of the painting as the Scroll of Darkness, probably because it was a virtual body possession.

The six-armed snake demon actually passed by them in pursuit of the Scroll of Darkness.

At this moment, Antinoya also smiled and said, "Any demon who regains the Scroll of Darkness and brings it back to the abyss will honestly present it to their superior, such as the six-armed snake demon or the Baloyan demon. If the presenter's rank is high enough, it might even be a demon prince."

"The Scroll of Darkness has always been a thorn in the eyes of demons because it records too many secrets of the abyss. They will persistently destroy this artifact whenever they have the chance."

"But even if the Scroll of Darkness of Ahham is fragile, it is almost indestructible because of its status as an artifact," Zhao Xu said. "Is there another way?"

"Of course, there is a well-known method in the abyss that never fails. Just throw it into the abyss's Dark Well, and the internal chaotic evil liquid will completely destroy the Scroll of Darkness after an hour," Antinoya said, as her gaze fell back on the painting in front of her.
Here is the translation of the text:

"I currently have a dark tome in my hand, titled 'Dark Tome: Abyssal Geography'. Initially, Turcotte Noel Ahham used the records from 'The Abyssal Tome' to explore the abyss, and then created a guide that corresponds to the ever-changing layers. This guide contains geographical information about the abyss, including dangerous and relatively safe locations."

As Ahntriya said, "Because encountering demons will automatically trigger teleportation, I usually have to seal it away."

Only to see that the Abyssal Geography is a large and cumbersome book, looking like a sailor's navigation chart. With Ahntriya's unfolding, Zhao Xu noticed that the pages are at least 2 meters long and over 1 meter wide, and emitting a very strong moldy smell.

"Reading this dark tome is a difficult task, and the process will be urgently suppressed. If you can't persevere, you may become paranoid and refuse to touch this dark tome, or even be in a state of fear when you approach it."

"However, if you can persevere, you will gain a detailed understanding of the abyss."

"The knowledge of the abyss and demons (plane) and survival skills in the abyss will have a +10 environmental bonus. This effect can last for a year after reading."

Zhao Xu understood that this is the typical skill bonus of the dark tome, and continued to ask, "What about the secondary, advanced powers?"

"One secondary power allows for limited interdimensional teleportation, returning at a specified time. Another is daily high-level teleportation. The last is a weekly summoning of demons through the portal."

After hearing this, Zhao Xu shook his head directly, "This effect seems ordinary."
Antinoya couldn't help but laugh, "Your standards have been raised. But I really don't recommend using it, because every time you use the power, it will attract 2-5 judgment demons. Once the probability is reached, it will also cause the summoned demons to rebel, and summon an additional six-armed snake demon and 1-4 berserk demons to retrieve the artifact."
"At the same time, these demons are summoned, they have a physical form, so they can continue to summon, making you face a demon reinforcement army."
Hearing this, Zhao Xu shook his head silently, "Just listening to it gives me a headache."
"I feel that these so-called artifacts are somewhat overrated, more like wanting the indestructible properties of artifacts."
At this point, his evaluation of the "oil painting" had already lowered significantly.
Then Antinoya retrieved her "Abyssal Geography Chronicle". From her perspective, the seemingly fragile body of Antinoya concealed a terrifying power.
"As for this oil painting, I really can't guess which Ahham Dark Scroll it is. After all, I only joined that cult for a few years, and didn't have much contact with it."
Saying this, Antinoya frowned and thought deeply.
"But from my perspective, this painting looks more like a teleportation key."
"A key?"
Zhao Xu couldn't help but remember that when he had to go to the Death God's semi-plane, the "giant scythe" he held was the key, and what he was looking for was the hidden "portal."
"Generally speaking, if mages don't pay attention to their semi-planes, they can easily lose their specific coordinates in the star realm due to plane storms."
"So most mages who can create a semi-plane with the legendary spell 'Genesis' will fix the entrance coordinates of the semi-plane in the painting, and then apply the power of 'teleportation' spells to the oil painting."
"So, the painting in my hand is very likely to point to a certain level of the abyss?" Zhao Xu muttered to himself.
Here is the translation:

"It's not wrong, generally, when we arrive at the abyss, we usually choose the fourth layer of the Myriad Plains, where there are many teleportation gates to the abyss, making it well-known and one of the most frequent routes to the bottomless abyss, as well as a common destination for many travelers hoping to explore the infinite layers."

"If I were you, I would also recommend choosing this layer for teleportation. At least when we land, it's safer than other layers."

As Anniya said that, she raised the painting in her hand, "However, since we have this painting now, let's use it to enter the scene, and also allow you to experience the atmosphere of the 'Dark Scroll', which will make it easier for you to recognize it later."

Instantly, Anniya activated the power of the painting.

The portal in the painting, which was vividly depicted, suddenly burst forth with a strong light, pulling her into it.

Just as the light fell on Zhao Xiu, the blue light suddenly turned black.

Zhao Xiu disappeared directly.

After experiencing a dizzying and nauseating sensation, Zhao Xiu suddenly discovered that he was standing on a turbulent sea surface. He immediately used his "Flight Technique" to control his body.

Anniya was no longer by his side.

At the same time, a mysterious cry echoed behind him - "Rahleah".
