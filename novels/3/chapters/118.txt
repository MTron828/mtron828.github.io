Chapter 119: The Road to the Heavenly Emperor

The next day, Zhao Xu again met her in the office of the tower, where he had first met her.

At this point, Zhao Xu's emotions had recovered a lot, and his entire person had completely calmed down.

After being killed by the Black Dragon's spew and crossing back to ten years ago, Zhao Xu's mind was both uncertain and drifting aimlessly. Even in the deepest part of his mind, he could not determine whether this was not a dream.

He might have suffered for ten years and then crossed back to the day when the game was opened, forever trapped in this cycle of ten years. It wasn't until yesterday that he had experienced those things and began to realize that he had started to drift along with the flow.

There are some things in life that are worth striving for, no matter the cost.

"It seems that your gains this time are quite significant," An Ti Noyah said, sitting on the sofa with her legs crossed, looking at the newspaper with a very good mood.

Zhao Xu noticed that the other person's hat had changed, and the shadow below was not as deep as before, allowing him to see the outline of An Ti Noyah's white face.

"Oh, I have something to give you first," Zhao Xu said, pulling out the "small booklet" from his bag that Lyen the Mage had given him.

"This small booklet is a mysterious mine in the forest near the Middle Isle, where I met a mage who claimed to be Lyen. He asked me to give it to you."

"The meaning is that you have the power to choose first," Zhao Xu said, slowly recalling Lyen's words.

"Self-deception," An Ti Noyah waved her hand lightly.
Here is the translation of the text:

The power of "The Mage's Hand" suddenly grabbed the small booklet and flew it into the corner of the incense burner in the guest room. Within a short while, the booklet began to unroll and emit smoke, turning black as it was subjected to the intense heat of the flames. Zhao Xu was completely unprepared for this outcome.

The booklet that Tak had sacrificed his life to obtain was now in Anzhi Nia's eyes, and it was worth more than all the incense in the world. "Is this not the thing that the Leyen Mage refused to accept from you?" she asked.

Zhao Xu had already begun to suspect that Leyen was not just slighting Anzhi Nia, but something far more sinister. The "Heritage of the Etzel Empire" had been obtained by the people of the former Earth, but it ultimately failed to save the Etzel Empire and was only left as a legacy for future generations.

But the secret of the Oath-bound King Ernest, which was rumored to be coveted by even the gods, was a different story altogether. The gods, aside from a few powerful deities, did not possess personal emotions and had become abstract symbols combined with their divine nature and duties. Becoming a god was a process of stripping away humanity.

This thought alone could stir up greed in anyone's heart, and the value of this treasure was incalculable.

Anzhi Nia extended her index finger, pointing at Zhao Xu. This sudden movement sent Zhao Xu's heart racing.

It wasn't that he was attracted to her green-colored finger, but rather this action was the standard opening move of the 7th-level spell "Death's Finger". This spell was so well-known that even children in the world of Arthur would play with it, pretending to point at each other. However, Anzhi Nia's finger was not just a playful gesture - it was possible that it could also cast the 9th-level spell "Decree of Death".

However, a few seconds passed, and Zhao Xu's entire body showed no change.

"Teacher?"

Zhao Xu sighed in frustration, suddenly feeling that it had been over a week since he last saw An Ti Nuo Ya, who now looked like the girl he had first met, with a playful and mischievous demeanor.

"Ah?" An Ti Nuo Ya finally spoke up, "Oh, I just saw this report and was still analyzing how a certain death spell broke through a mage's defense barrier and successfully killed the opponent."

"It's really strange," Zhao Xu said, "Arthur's ordinary mage level has dropped so much since before the calamity era. Even the death spell can kill people now."

Listening to An Ti Nuo Ya's ridicule, Zhao Xu also felt like responding with a counter-ridicule, but the Seven Rings Mage was no longer ordinary.

"Teacher, I just asked you if you reject that Leyn Mage's gift?"

Zhao Xu knew that repeating the question wasn't good, but this important booklet was just burned, and he felt strange.

"You think the thing you went to great lengths to bring back was burned by me, and it's hard to accept, isn't it?" Suddenly, An Ti Nuo Ya directly manipulated a thick tome of magic and held it in her hand.

"Not toilsome." Zhao Xu, following traditional etiquette, said.

"This isn't toilsome, I've even seen you use shape-shifting magic," An Ti Nuo Ya teased.

"Teacher, that's not my toil, it's theirs," Zhao Xu said.

Looking back, he had directly used the ninth-level magic "Shape-shifting" attached to his back for a breath's worth of effort.

Meanwhile, he was still engaging in intense, fist-to-fist combat throughout.

It's great, but it's just too expensive.
Here is the translation of the text:

Nine-level spell scroll can be obtained for 3800 gold coins, but ordinary people need to use the "Magic Device" skill to cast it. One can imagine how much effort Anniya has put into this spell.

Zhou Xu's heart swelled with emotion as he thought about this. "Ah, that fool Lyra is too optimistic."

Anniya turned the book in her hand and finally recalled her detailed evaluation of Lyra.

Zhou Xu was stimulated by Anniya's words and didn't have too many emotional fluctuations. "Fool?" 

"Yes, he thought he was the only smart one in Floating City and that he could see through the world's affairs. Back then, he thought we nobles held the highest authority in the Mage Association, and he looked down on us. But the goddess didn't even look up at him, and he lost his path as a priest."

"So I said he was a fool, from the beginning to now, he's made a mistake."

Anniya's voice was clear and resonated in Zhou Xu's ear.

Zhou Xu had a vague understanding, but he was also surprised to discover that Anniya called him a noble and an old aristocrat. He couldn't help but ask curiously, "Teacher, are you also from the Mage Family?"

Magicians are looked down upon because their power comes from bloodline, not learning.

However, after magicians occupy high positions, they also play the same game, not convenient to accept their own family members as apprentices, and instead exchange apprentices with another magician who has family members.

As a result, magicians from the Mage Family have become a traditional custom, just like the collapse of the Orenstein Empire.

"Oh, that extremely gossipy Lyra didn't tell you my full name."
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu's interest suddenly surged, and he began to recall the surnames of the giant figures in the Mage Association.

"Alright, I'll tell you - Ittier Anniya," he said.

Suddenly, Zhao Xu's mind flashed with countless electric shocks, and he finally understood why Rayne had asked him to give the little booklet to Anniya.

According to legend, the inheritance of the Ittier Kingdom was in the hands of the Ittier family, which was also in Anniya's hands. The ancestors of the Earth's human beings could barely survive in the initial resource-poor situation, and they could say they had received the blessings of the Ittier family.

Zhao Xu, however, had not expected that he had become a descendant of the Ittier family on his first day in the game.

"Teacher, it turns out you're the last princess?" Zhao Xu couldn't help but tease.

"Who told you I'm the last princess?" Anniya replied calmly. "However, I burned that booklet because I knew it was a trap."

"If you want to participate in this, at least you need to be 5-level or higher," Anniya said. "Then you'll have the qualifications to listen, but only to listen."

Anniya's words had just fallen, but then her gaze shifted to Rayne.

"Rayne is also foolish to throw medicine at the patient," Anniya said. "He thought that Ernst could retrieve his soul from Astimos' hands, so he felt that the other party's secrets would also have such means. He didn't think that it was just someone who could do this with just a face, the problem is that he has this face."

At this point, Anniya didn't continue the topic, but stood up and put the book back on the shelf. "Tell me about your adventure experiences over this period," she said.
After hearing this sentence, Zhao Xu also recounted everything from leaving the Stormwind City to meeting the Druid, entering the mine, and transforming into a shape-shifter to kill enemies in the rain.

"Well, even though you're relying on three different methods, you're always taking risks and venturing into dangerous territories. However, since you can change your shape, you should take a break and have some fun. But since you're contacting creatures of a lower level, if you had dared to attack at least an 8-ring Leylin when you had the chance, I would give you a bonus."

Zhao Xu's eyes lit up with excitement as he thought about the abilities he could gain if he could transform into a being and acquire corresponding spellcasting abilities.

However, he couldn't help but feel a sense of emptiness after the transformation. It was as if he had lost something.

Anzhen Niya said with a smile, "Oh, that's not a big deal. The temporary spellcasting ability can allow a spellcaster to imbue willing creatures with spells. Right now, as a 2nd-level character with 2 HD, you can simultaneously imbue two creatures with spells."

Zhao Xu whispered, "Don't you need to pay?"

Anzhen Niya replied calmly, "Yes, you do. The spellcasting ability level multiplied by the spellcaster level is approximately 100 gold coins. This is the market price."

Note: The story seems to be a fantasy setting with magical concepts and terminology, but I've translated it to the best of my abilities.
Here is the translation of the text:

After calculating the formula 9x25x100=22500GP, Zhao Xu suddenly felt a pang of sadness.

He finally understood the true cost of his sudden burst of strength.

"Not bad?" Suddenly, An Ti Noya noticed Zhao Xu's face filled with sorrow and asked curiously.

"Yes," Zhao Xu replied.

"What's wrong? You're worried about something?" An Ti Noya tilted her head slightly and looked at Zhao Xu, feeling a bit puzzled.

As for her, she didn't even bother to count how many piles of gold coins she had. Not to mention that she could create gold coins using her blessing magic, but she couldn't be too reckless.

"Besides, if you want, I can give you two more chances. I have over thirty of them on me," An Ti Noya boasted proudly.

It turned out that An Ti Noya was a 30-something level legendary mage.

As soon as Zhao Xu discovered An Ti Noya's true level, he was also taken aback.

"However, since you're now at level 2, I can arrange a curriculum for you to learn new skills. You'll basically have it covered," Zhao Xu said.

"However, don't leave Mistral until you're at least level 5. I'll lose face if you do."

"That's not necessary," An Ti Noya said lightly.

"Isn't that what you're going to do to get specialized training?"

"What are you thinking?" An Ti Noya exclaimed, her eyes under the cloak staring at Zhao Xu.

"From the beginning, I told you I'm a mage who can specialize in both magic and the curriculum," An Ti Noya said with a serious tone.
