Chapter 027 Mage Progress
Once this "Mindful Spellcaster" in his hand is spread, the number of professional mages will definitely experience a surge.
It was the process of transcribing that blocked the majority of people, otherwise his classmates would definitely have let him try it at the time.
In the world of Arthur, there is nothing that is unique to the indigenous people and cannot be mastered by players. Especially after the mass crossover, basically everyone is on the same level. What you can do, I can do too.
If Antinoya can pass on the "Mindful Spellcaster" to him, he can also pass on this ability to others.
This is equivalent to Zhao Xu holding a key to the spread of combat power.
Zhao Xu can hardly imagine that the indigenous people of Arthur would trust him, a player, so much.
Arthur is a place that the people of Arthur want to protect, not something that players want to protect.
If it were placed on other players, who knows, in the future, this matter of crossing over might be sold for a few hundred or a thousand.
"Teacher, why do you trust me so much?" Zhao Xu asked slowly.
"No reason."
Zhao Xu was slightly surprised when he heard this.
"Just kidding, your ability is not complete, so you can't spread it," Antinoya suddenly smiled.
Zhao Xu then realized that when Antinoya said he hadn't fully mastered it at first, that was the reason.
However, a year later, he would eventually truly master it because of the crossover, and then he would become a hidden danger.
"In fact, you don't need to worry, there are plenty of things that disrupt the balance." With that, Antinoya looked at him and directly raised the arm under the robe, pointing directly at Zhao Xu.
It's completely different from other mages - no spells, no gestures.
She just pointed at him and cast the spell.
A flash of golden light directly passed through.
Zhao Xu didn't even have time to dodge, and he saw it in front of his desk.
Rows of shiny gold coins piled up in front of Zhao Xu.
The image of the goddess of business and wealth is faintly visible on the coins, proving that these are real gold coins.
"Wish spell, twenty-five thousand gold coins," Antinoya said softly.
In his previous life, Zhao Xu had never seen so many gold coins at once, and he suddenly stopped breathing.
"This is the true ability to disrupt balance, understand?" 
Zhao Xu looked up at Antinoya. Casting a wish spell requires a price - it will consume experience, and using it too much will cause the character to downgrade.
But he didn't expect Antinoya to create these gold coins out of thin air.
"No cost?" After thinking about the possibility, Zhao Xu found it hard to believe.
"Of course not. I wouldn't risk downgrading just to show off to a little kid like you by casting a wish spell."
"This is too much," Zhao Xu almost shouted. Countless people work day and night and it's difficult to earn 225kg of gold, and it's just placed in front of him like that.
This is a quarter of a ton, not 4 grams.
On Earth, it's equivalent to a ninth-level spell creating 80 million worth of gold out of thin air.
Being able to cast it without cost could destroy the financial system directly.
"Don't think too much, there aren't many mages who possess this ability," Antinoya looked deeply into Zhao Xu's eyes.
The gold coins on the table were suddenly gone, taken into Antinoya's dimensional bag.
Here is the translation:

"I shouldn't have told you all this so early, but I saw a different fate behind you. I think you can be trusted."

Zhou Xu sat quietly.

These legendary wizards said they could see fate, not just reciting lines, but really seeing it.

Perhaps, Anniya had already realized that all the Earth people, including Zhou Xu, would eventually end up in Aetheria.

Zhou Xu knew that his questioning was futile, and the words he had said were the maximum limit.

No other player could get a more clear prophecy than this.

Zhou Xu lowered his head, "Teacher, what should I learn next?"

Having seen the incredible abilities of the wizard, Zhou Xu's entire heart was manipulated by it.

"Uh?" Anniya suddenly let out a soft sigh, with some confusion.

"Some things need to be settled first, and you should rest too. We'll learn again tomorrow."

Saying this, Anniya's body flashed out of sight, as if she had never stayed here from the beginning.

Zhou Xu didn't expect his teacher to leave suddenly. He could only pick up the "First Level Spell Overview" on the side and take a look at the spell introductions.

He still needed to choose some first-level spells from here, which was the true strength he would take with him after leaving the Floating City.

Without Anniya's supervision, no one would provide him with specific spell records to copy, so Zhou Xu could only look at the introductions and understand them briefly.

After looking at it for about two hours, all the lectures of the night were over, and Zhou Xu could only log off and wait for tomorrow to tell Anniya his choice.

"Brother Xu, what did you do today? You're not even playing the game."
Here is the translation of the text:

After spending time with his girlfriend downstairs, Zhang Qi returned to the dormitory and found that Zhao Xu was not online, but was quietly reading a book in the room, which surprised him greatly.

"Let's take a rest," he said, which lifted the weight off his mind. Zhao Xu, who was afraid of not being able to become a mage, started to do something boring to pass the time.

"Hey, Xu Ge, do you want to join our class union?" Zhang Qi quickly approached him and said.

"Have you raised the guarantee fee?" Zhao Xu asked in surprise.

Arthur's union does not require any union certificate, but only needs to pay a guarantee fee to the local BOSS. Then, they can recruit members and publish job postings.

But now, no player can afford to pay this fee.

"I didn't expect you to be so well-informed, Xu Ge," Zhang Qi said in surprise. "Of course, we can't afford it, but we can still form a union by ourselves, even if we can't publish tasks."

"The union was founded by Huang Daqiang, who wanted to attract our class's attention," Zhang Qi explained.

Huang Daqiang is a tyrant in their class, known for his wealth and influence in the school. He once served as the union chairman, but did some outrageous things that lost him the hearts of his classmates. He was eventually dismissed and has been opposing the class union ever since.

Zhao Xu had a bad experience with Huang Daqiang in his previous life and deliberately went to "Arthur" to prepare for the union war. However, he is currently preoccupied with his studies at the Mage Academy and has no interest in finding Huang Daqiang.

He is too busy to care about it, and besides, the class union is still under the control of Huang Daqiang.
Here is the translation:

"Ah, Xugu, you should listen to me, change your profession early, because more than half of the mages on the forum have given up training and switched to something else."

"Li Tianshang, that university champion, heard that Lao Lao Goddess was complaining that mages are hard to play, so he deliberately played a mage game, but it's not today that he felt he couldn't record zero-level magic, and he gave up. To this day, no one in the school has successfully recorded zero-level magic."

Zhao Xugu was surprised, not expecting such inside information at the time of the server opening, and Li Tianshang was one of the top students in their grade.

It seems that he still underestimated the difficulty of mages at the time of the server opening.

"Xugu, how far have you gotten?"
