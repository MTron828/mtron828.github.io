Chapter 297: Mysterious Magic Light

The next morning, Zhao Xiu had already prepared his magic earlier than usual.

Before shutting down the previous night, he had found a secluded spot and released the three-ring magic "Leo's Hidden Cottage".

As a mage, one has a series of temporary residential magic spells.

Wandering and setting up tents are common experiences for ordinary adventurers.

Since Zhao Xiu would recover his magic position the next day, he didn't hesitate to release this magic.

Starting from the second ring, mages can obtain the "Magical Rope" spell, which allows them to enter a mysterious space to sleep without any sleep quality.

After reaching the fifth level, the magic to create temporary residences becomes more abundant. The three-ring "Leo's Hidden Cottage", four-ring "Leo's Protection", five-ring "Leo's Hidden Cottage" and "Leo's Secret Hall", and seven-ring "Leo's Mage's Mansion".

Currently, Zhao Xiu can only cast the most basic "Hidden Cottage" magic.

The "Hidden Cottage" is actually a spell that creates an impermeable and unmovable spherical body with a diameter of about 6 meters, which can accommodate 10 people inside to shelter from the wind and rain, unless it is hit by a typhoon-level severe weather. The spell's duration is 2 hours per level, allowing Zhao Xiu to enjoy the benefits the next day.

It is only when Zhao Xiu can cast the four-ring "Leo's Protection" that he can create a decent-looking room.

However, when the guardians' union members logged in, they were shocked to see the mysterious, semi-transparent ball-like object appearing out of nowhere. Everyone suspected that someone must have done it. Due to their cautious attitude towards magic, no one dared to approach it.

Everyone looked towards the team's chief magician, Chen Nu, waiting for his explanation.

After some thought, Chen Nu took out the magical textbook from his backpack and flipped through its pages, finally concluding that it was probably the "Leeomon's Refuge" spell from the "Three-Ring Magic" series.

The union president, Shuang Jian, was taken aback by this revelation and almost rubbed his eyes in disbelief.

As soon as everyone learned that there was a magician who had crushed them by two levels, the discussion forum on magicians had never been hotter.

Even players who didn't care much about the profession of magicians knew that magicians needed to prepare their spells in advance and couldn't change them once prepared.

Moreover, magicians could only cast the highest-level spells within a limited number each day, usually around two. Although the spell slots would refresh every day, it meant that the "crazy wind" magician, who had gone out yesterday, had prepared the "Leeomon's Refuge" and "Shadow Steed" spells.

It was as if the magician had used spells like "Water Breathing" and "Fireball" without preparing them.

"Food, clothing, shelter - this guy has solved everything, and he's also enjoying himself," said the sister of Shuang Jian, who was also known as the famous traveler Snowy Cold in the post-epoch era.

Everyone has their own choices, but in her opinion, magicians themselves cannot freely use their spells, preparing them in a place with no battle utility, which is simply too "hedonistic".

Magicians who know the limitations of their spells will not choose to master such spells.

This also made the players who were accustomed to gusts and breezes look down upon it, a wizard who didn't have the key three-ring spell prepared, and a two-ring wizard was no different. "Ah, maybe this spell itself has sufficient safety, the wind wizard probably also considered the risks around Mistral, and today is also the day when the spell slots were restored." Frost Sword, the decision-maker for hiring the wind wizard, chuckled to himself. However, the guild members in attendance had witnessed the many indigenous people of Mistral. They were just like the earth, nourishing a hundred people with a single grain of rice, from kind and honest to cunning and treacherous. If the wind wizard in front of them was the kind of person who used their spell slots to enjoy life, then the task that concerned their guild's future was probably uncertain. It seemed a bit hesitant, Frost Sword turned his head and asked Chen: "Is the safety of this spell good?" Chen shook his head, saying, "It's basically zero, and arrows and weapons can pierce this barrier, but the creatures inside can obtain full concealment." "Full concealment" means there is a possibility of losing attack opportunities, but it also means that the emergency shelter is no different from a normal tent. It can block the wind and rain, but that's all. Hearing this, the guild members' faces turned gloomy. Think about it, if a real battle occurred, the team's main force wizard would first cast a one-ring "slip away" spell to create a safe distance of about 70-80 meters in 6 seconds. Or they would directly cast a two-ring "invisibility" spell to ensure their safety, which would be a devastating blow to the team's morale.

Just then, Zhao Xu also walked out from behind the barrier, only to find that there were already several members of the labor union gathered around the sphere, looking puzzled. He asked, "What's going on?"

At this time, as the chairperson of the labor union, Shuang Jian, walked up to Zhao Xu and said, "Mr. Kuang Feng, it's not a big deal. The main thing is that the three of us, as circle mages, have limited magical abilities. I think we should prepare some necessary combat spells by the time we reach our destination. Tonight, we can also set up tents here to ensure the safety of Mr. Law Mage."

Zhao Xu's mind was clear, and he immediately understood Shuang Jian's concerns. His opponent had paid a heavy price to ask him to take on this task, and he himself was expected to contribute his abilities.

However, Zhao Xu didn't dare to explain himself, as he had the abilities of "Precognition" and "Multitasking Mage", and he didn't prepare any life-saving spells. Moreover, his three-circle magical abilities were not limited to just two.

Zhao Xu thought for a moment and pointed directly at the mage Chen Nuo in front of him, saying, "Let me take a detection spell from you."

Chen Nuo was taken aback for a moment, but after looking at Shuang Jian, he still followed Zhao Xu's request and cast the zero-circle spell "Detection Magic".

As the lowest-level spell, it would not greatly affect Chen Nuo's combat strength.

As the secret energy spread around, the first round of information about whether there were any magical phenomena in the area began to feedback into Chen Nuo's mind.

Without a doubt, his teammates, most of whom did not have any magical items, seemed to disappear under the effect of the "Detection Magic".

It wasn't until the second round that Chen Nuo began to gain knowledge of the number and intensity of the magical phenomena, and his eyes gradually widened in astonishment, as if he had witnessed an unbelievable scene.
Here is the translation of the text:

As the third round arrived, those incredibly powerful magical auras all converged in front of Chen No's eyes and eventually landed on a single person, overlapping with the silhouette of that "Crazy Wind" mage.

"How is this?" observed Will of Frost, who had never seen Chen No look so dazed and confused.

Although they were in Mistral, they had not participated in the Star Lake Battle and missed the massive influx of magical equipment.

However, the entire guild still had a few magical items. It was as if Chen No had never seen the world before.

Everyone's gaze fell on Chen No, and they saw him start muttering to himself: "One, two, three, four..."

Chen No continued counting all the way to eleven before stopping.

The onlookers couldn't help but chuckle at the absurdity of it all. There were no more than eleven magical items in the entire guild.

Unless this Crazy Wind mage had gone crazy and cast a continuous spell on himself, it would be difficult for him to exhaust the opponent's spell slots with eleven continuous buffs.

"Hey, Chen No, what's going on?" Snow asked, her tone slightly puzzled.

As Chen No explained the magical auras, Will of Frost suddenly understood what was happening. He thought to himself that the Crazy Wind mage had gone crazy today, using all his spells to buff himself, leaving no spell slots unused.

He also reacted quickly, just realizing what the Crazy Wind mage meant.

This meant that all his spells today had been used to buff himself, with no waste on horseback or lodging.

Will of Frost quietly approached Chen No and whispered, "Are they all spells?"

In the end, he still hoped that the Crazy Wind mage had some other magical items.
As the opponent becomes stronger, their chances of success increase.

Just as Chen Nuo was about to doubt himself, he shook his head, saying, "All of them are above average, with some being strong and others being intense, even piercing."

"What does it mean?" someone asked, and the members of the guild immediately sensed that there was more to it. The carefree wanderer, who was notorious for his big mouth, quickly asked the question.

The magic priestess, Qing Kong, then explained: "There are four levels of magical aura: dim, average, strong, and piercing. Magical spells and items that can maintain their effects can display magical auras."

"For example, spells with a rank of one to three and magical items with a level of five or below will only emit a dim aura."

As soon as he heard this, everyone understood that this crazy wind mage was a three-rank mage!

The magical aura on the opponent's body was the lowest level of "average", not "dim", indicating that none of them were spells.

They were all magical items!

At this moment, everyone's mouth was slightly open, as it was hard to imagine what they had just heard.

"Did Chen Nuo just say there were eleven auras?" the warrior beside him asked, and the oldest warrior in the group sighed.

As he spoke, he also looked down at the " +1" two-handed giant sword he had bought with great difficulty. This originally precious sword now looked so ordinary.

When they heard this number, everyone felt their teeth ache.

Arthas's magical items are extremely valuable, and many families treat them as family heirlooms, passing them down from generation to generation.
Here is the translation:

So, the player who possesses magical equipment is inherently superior. This is also the harvest of the Starfall War, which has left countless players envious.

"This is the Arthur family, isn't it?"

"It must be a family like that to have such accomplishments."

"What is the level of the magic item's caster?"

"Magic items are evaluated based on the lowest level of the caster, such as the 5th-level mage who can cast the Fireball spell. Therefore, the caster level of the Fireball wand is 5th, and the higher the caster level, the more powerful the spell will be."

The poet in the corner spoke up, having worked at the Mistral Magic Item Shop. "By the way, what is the level of the Eye of Insight?"

"Is it above level 21?"

"What does that mean?"

"It means legendary or divine."

At this point, Chen Nu instinctively reacted, saying, "Oh my god, even the native Arthurian mage has the habit of dressing up and sneaking in to visit."

A barbarian couldn't help but exclaim in plain language, "Thank goodness it's not a player, or I would have blown up the designer's building and opened the back door to this extent."

At this moment, no one dared to question Zhao Xu's magical equipment again.

With this equipment, it's not just a matter of shouting, but hiring a team to escort them and it's not a problem.

Suddenly, a warrior let out a blood-curdling scream, startling everyone who had been lost in their dream of magical equipment.

The warrior's body was pierced by a sharp arrow that had passed through his chest.

"Enemy attack, alert, defensive formation!"

Glacier saw this scene and shouted urgently, "Scout the enemy's direction and distance!"
In an instant, the second spear shot forth with great force, directly heading towards Zhao Xu in the field.
