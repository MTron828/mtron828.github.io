Chapter 385: Passengers on Earth

South Xiaoyi's gathering was scheduled for around 3:30 pm, while Zhao Xu's high school classmate dinner was planned for the evening, and fortunately, he could take the subway to get there.

However, by noon, Zhao Xu had already ridden an electric shared bike and was touring the city where he had grown up.

He walked past each school gate, from elementary school to high school, looking at the familiar yet slightly different facades, and his heart was filled with reminiscences.

Every year during the summer or winter break, he would return to his hometown and walk around these areas, but this time, it was during the summer break, so he wouldn't be able to run into his old teachers.

This time, he felt a stronger sense of nostalgia because half a year from now, these buildings would only remain in his memory.

He also noticed that some office buildings had giant posters of the game "Arthur" stuck on them, with diverse designs.

When he saw one of the posters, Zhao Xu couldn't help but freeze.

A knight in shining armor with a helmet and a long sword, gazing straight ahead, caught his eye.

This knight's appearance was none other than Vivian.

The armor and long sword emitted a dazzling glow.

In theory, his influence should only affect the development of "Arthur" on the game side and had no connection to the operation of the game on Earth.

He couldn't help but feel a headache about it, and later, players would definitely exclaim in surprise when they saw Vivian, as she had become the official spokesperson of the game.

After taking note of this, Zhao Xu didn't stop walking and directly entered a comic book store on the pedestrian street.
Here is the translation of the text:

The storefront selling console games and figurines was once numerous during Zhao Xun's childhood, but with the development of online channels and transparent pricing, these physical stores gradually struggled to survive.

Zhao Xun's visit to the anime city can be said to be one of the last few remaining.

The storefronts are filled with packages of various sizes and sealed Taobao packages, and ordinary customers can only squeeze through the narrow passage.

At this time, Zhao Xun walked into the game store he had visited before, where he had bought his VR simulation helmet.

The store owner, Lao Ge, who was restocking the shelves, immediately greeted him with a local dialect: "Hey, Xiao Xun, what's up? How come you didn't come until just before the New Year? I left some good stuff for you, but it's almost gone."

"By the way, do you want to play the game 'Arthur'? It's really popular lately."

He handed Zhao Xun a plastic-sealed game disk, which featured Arthur's 11 main characters, each wearing different adventurer costumes.

In reality, this game disk only contained a single card with an activation code, accompanied by a simple booklet introducing the professions and attributes.

Wrapped in this way, it became a collectible edition, with a price hike from the luxurious edition's 599 to 799.

As Zhao Xun watched this scene, he suddenly felt a sense of historical bifurcation, only to converge back to the same line.

In the past, during the New Year's holiday before, when he passed by Lao Ge's storefront, he was also told the same thing by the other party.

However, he had laughed and refused at the time, saying he was too busy and didn't have time to play games.

He thus missed out on four precious months.

"Ah, Lao Ge, do you play games?" Zhao Xun asked softly.
Here is the translation of the text:

"It's true, every day I close my shop, and I'm always on time. Ah, it's just that my skills are too limited, I want everything but everything is lacking."

Light Brother spoke as if he was very interested, "It seems you play too, Xiaoxu, I'll tell you, you have to be careful with your skills. My Spirit Archer is now planning to delete my account and restart, I just can't bear to give up my 32 bonus points at the start."

As Light Brother said this, he couldn't help but show a hint of envy. He believed that the person opposite him, Xiaoxu, could understand the game.

A code can only be registered once for 28 high-end bonus points, three times for 22 middle-end bonus points, and countless times for 15 low-end bonus points.

And only on the first day of opening can you get an additional 4 bonus points as a reward.

This is the most direct reward given by the gods to lucky players.

Light Brother has been able to start with 32 bonus points, which means he has never died and never regrets changing his profession.

Just as Xiaoxu was about to reveal some inside information to Light Brother, he suddenly glanced over and saw a girl on the other side of the elevator, wearing a wizard's robe with a design similar to the floating city, and a high-collared cloak outside, holding a "Higher Super Magic Instant Release Wand" similar to the one in his hand.

Until the elevator doors were completely closed, the other party disappeared from Xiaoxu's line of sight.

For a moment, the sense of temporal reversal was so absurd that Xiaoxu felt a little unbelievable.

He glanced at the downward arrow on the elevator, then looked at the "3F" sign on this floor, and immediately rushed towards the "Escape Stairway" on the other side.

There are 48 floors of stairs between the third floor and the first floor.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu personally verified how many seconds it would take him to run, even at the stairs' corners, where he would grab the railing and turn sharply. Finally, when he ran out of the staircase, he noticed the woman dressed in an Arthurian-style robe, who was around the same height and build as An Jia, slowly walking out of the front door.

Zhao Xu quickly rushed up to her, shouting, "Hey, wait!"

However, the woman turned around, and under her hat, she had an ordinary-looking face.

"Sorry, I must have mistaken you," Zhao Xu apologized immediately.

"Never seen cosplay?" the woman thought he was flirting with her and gave him a disdainful look before continuing to walk away.

Zhao Xu couldn't help but feel embarrassed and slapped his own forehead in frustration.

He had been stuck in the university for a few months and had not gone out at all, so he didn't react quickly.

Or maybe he didn't realize that Arthur was already showing signs of going offline.

In general, Zhao Xu was mostly confined to the technical forums, where he spent most of his time browsing, and rarely paid attention to the live shows of professional players.

Or, after the last time when all players suddenly disconnected for half a day, Zhao Xu felt a sense of unease, thinking that the interaction between the two worlds was deeper than in previous lives.

After this incident, Zhao Xu lost his enthusiasm for browsing.

He glanced at his watch, realizing that he was already late for his appointment with Xiaoyi, so he directly rode a shared bike to the nearby KTV.

Just as he disappeared from view around the corner of the intersection.

In the original anime city, two people slowly emerged from the crowd.

They were both wearing the same golden wine-colored robe, with cloaks that shone like starlight.
Here is the translation of the text:

The two women seemed to be radiating a mysterious aura, making everyone around them indifferent to their presence. "This world is really strange, isn't it? We can actually project ourselves onto Arthur through this small box and gaming account."

A mature-looking woman with a charming smile was excitedly looking at the VR headset and "Arthur" game disk in her hand. "May, stop messing around, you used your suggestion technique to get this thing, what's the point?" the young woman next to her, who was known for causing trouble, shook her head helplessly.

"Hey, don't be mad, Xiaoniya," May laughed, covering her mouth with her hand.

However, the mysterious charm emanating from the woman was something that no one could understand, not even with any special abilities. Just her subtle smile was enough to captivate people's hearts.

As the scorching noon sun shone down on them, it seemed as if they were being gently twisted and distorted, as if they were being drawn by a mysterious force.

"I didn't expect to run into him here," Xiaoniya thought back to her prediction made using the legendary art of divination, pondering the mistake in her fate's trajectory.

"What's the point of running into him?" May said coldly, looking at Xiaoniya with a skeptical expression.

"Should be," Xiaoniya nodded slightly.

"Was it a mistake?" May jeered, having opposed the player's decision to log in a year ahead of time from the start.

"Yes," Xiaoniya nodded again.

"Because of the resonance of the transmission channel, the energy channel constructed by the gods may not last for a year," Xiaoniya said.

At this moment, the two women were discussing something on this land, completely unaware that everything they said would leak out.
Here is the translation of the text:

The two of them were surrounded by an unknown, mysterious energy that swirled and danced around them. "Is that the 'Earth Rebirth' plan that's been accelerated due to the meteorite's early descent?" May asked coldly, evaluating the gods' plan.

"No, it's the 'Earth Rebirth' plan," Anzhenya corrected her, her tone calm and serene.

"Hmph."

May directly brought her hands together and looked at everything in front of her with a detached expression.

"So you sent me to investigate the situation beforehand? Or is it that these huge banners hanging from the rooftops are also a means to accelerate the progress of the players?" Anzhenya nodded lightly, "Yes."

May couldn't help but smile at the thought of the other person's surprise, as if it was a pleasant thing to see.

"If that's the case, I'll tell him next time we meet," Anzhenya said.

This was just as it should be.

"How much time is left until the revised schedule?"

As for this plan, the gods have been executing it through the Association of Mages and numerous churches, but May had refused to participate from the start.

She had quietly laid out her plans, waiting for the true turning point to arrive.

Many knew about this, but there were also forces that didn't have enough leverage to participate, quietly waiting just the same.

They were selecting suitable players and waiting for the day when 7 billion souls would come.

"It'll be about 4 months," Anzhenya said, her gaze already looking beyond the asphalt road and towards the blue sky.

There, a meteorite was about to break through the sky.
