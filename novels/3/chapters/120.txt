Chapter 121: The Ones Left Behind

After hearing the words of the elusive mage, the vast lecture hall erupted into a commotion.

Even though the mage, Noctis, was a legendary master with an aura that commanded respect, his lecture was still not enough to deter the countless aspiring mages who had eagerly squeezed in just to catch a glimpse of him.

Typically, lectures by legendary mages were invitation-only and restricted to a select few. Even high-level lectures were often difficult for new mages to attend, and only those with connections to the lecturing mage would receive an invitation.

However, Noctis's lecture on transformation was different. The entire event was open to the public, and anyone could purchase a ticket.

For new mages in Floating City, such an open lecture was a rare opportunity. It was a chance to learn from a master and gain valuable experience. Only through such a lecture could one truly gain the most value, as they would not only learn from the lecturing mage but also receive feedback from other high-level mages in attendance.

As a result, since the announcement on the dormitory bulletin board last night, many noble-born new mages had been secretly working hard to try and get their hands on a ticket.

This was also the reason why the lecture drew so few players. The ticket supply had been devoured by the underground network from the very beginning. Only a few players who had gained the favor of the lecturing mage were able to obtain the ticket directly from them.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhang Xiaoxu had always taken the tickets given by An Ti Nu Ya, including the lecture schedule in his hand, which was the entire lecture schedule of the Floating City.

The Floating City's administrative department's schedule was not necessarily complete.

As a result, Zhang Xiaoxu had a feeling that the administrative department of the Floating City would distribute free tickets.

This discrepancy left him stunned, unable to react to everyone's excitement.

It's just a lecture, isn't it?

However, even the elite novice mages who were born with exceptional abilities dared not to utter a word.

No one had the courage to insult a nine-ring mage in front of him.

In general, no one with an IQ of less than 17 could muster the courage to do so.

The materials they had prepared for a whole night were of no use as they hastily left the lecture hall.

The tickets that had cost a small fortune were rendered invalid by the nine-ring mage's words.

This was the eternal truth of the Floating City.

At that moment, Zhang Xiaoxu was scratching his head.

He had 17 attributes, but unfortunately, they were all virtual.

To truly realize these abilities would take 11 months, until the extinction of humanity.

Zhang Xiaoxu was about to leave when he hesitated.

After that, he transformed into a divine servant and killed the cavalrymen who had participated in the battle and Tak and his followers.

More so, it was due to his anger at his own helplessness.

He could go on an adventure according to An Ti Nu Ya's intentions, and he had the "Shape-Shifting" technique as a trump card, even if he couldn't take it seriously.

"Shape-Shifting" was truly powerful because it could transform into any living being, over a thousand different species, which was the greatest trump card of this technique.

However, Zhang Xiaoxu, who possessed this technique, was still not a nine-ring mage.
Here is the translation:

He couldn't even stop the opponent from moving, as even if he transformed, he couldn't immediately stop the opponent's sword.

So after returning to the Floating City, Zhao Xu decided to become a powerful mage.

When he transformed into the Fiery Heavenly Servant, he took on the style of a warrior who harvested life, which was the final separation from his own warrior soul in his previous life.

That's why he was so resolute, not using candles but instead using the expensive "transformation technique" to become a killing machine on the battlefield.

At the moment when the transformation ended, it was as if the warrior Zhao Xu had died.

The reborn mage Zhao Xu sat back down, thinking about this point.

Even if he wanted to become a battle mage, it only meant that his magic had to cover a wide range, have various pre-emptive measures, and be prepared for dynamic and static defense, as well as various magical techniques to control the enemy.

A sufficient mastery of magic was still a condition he needed to meet.

"Is your brother's IQ a problem?" Lin Qi, who was standing beside him, quickly noticed Zhao Xu's unusual behavior and whispered quietly.

Zhao Xu felt like this was an insult, but he could only swallow his pride and respond: "No, it's just a hard cushion."

And that fat guy was astonished as he looked at the soft cushion behind Zhao Xu, which he had sat on before. It was the most suitable for his body type, so how could it be hard?

As he thought about this, he turned around and looked at his wooden folding chair, feeling a bit sore in his buttocks.

At this point, nearly a third of the people in the hall had already left, which was beyond Zhao Xu's expectations.

He didn't expect there to be so many people with IQs of 17 to 18.
Here is the translation:

It seems that looking at the data, it's like a one-point increase is a one-point attribute, a linear increase, but in reality, it's an exponential increase.

In the strength attribute, every five points increase can roughly double the weight capacity.

So, 17 and 18 intelligence are already at the peak of people who have never been upgraded.

"Little brother, it's not surprising, Mr. Strala has gathered the most intelligent wizards from King Arthur's court, and the average quality is definitely high. Moreover, the tuition fee for coming here is a significant burden for the nobility and royal family. So, only the most talented ones can come."

Lawrence, the wizard, appeared at the right moment to answer Zhao Xu's question.

Even he, who thought himself to be the most intelligent, was struck by the harsh reality. Who could have predicted that Mr. Strala would lack the most in talent?

Zhao Xu nodded in gratitude, finding the familiar and familiar Lawrence less annoying than he expected.

As for Noch, the wizard, he nodded slightly, satisfied.

In reality, there were fewer people left than he expected, and he understood that the new wizards who managed to squeeze in here all came from humble backgrounds.

Even in the wizarding community, the coveted "Intelligence Headgear" that could increase intelligence was not uncommon.

With 15 points of innate intelligence and a "+2" Intelligence Headgear, he could easily meet his requirements.

However, Noch, the wizard, smiled coldly, and the new wizards in the audience all felt a chill in their hearts.

Intelligence Headgear can be passed down through generations, but innate magical talent is not guaranteed.
Here is the translation of the text:

Even mages who have never used the "Core Four Transformation" technique are leaving, and this course has nothing to do with you. Notorious Mage, with his hands behind his back, looked at the audience waiting for the lecture to begin.

At this moment, even with fewer people, the audience erupted in a louder commotion. The novice mages who had been left behind were gloating over their intelligence, feeling less competitive, and were taken aback when they heard these words.

The "Core Four Transformation" refers to the second-level transformation technique, the fourth-level shape-shifting technique, the eighth-level transformation of all things, and the ninth-level bodily transformation.

This sentence means that all novice mages at the first and second levels will be expelled.

"What nonsense!" a mage who was sitting behind Zhao Xu and not far away stood up, his face filled with anger and walked out.

Zhao Xu noticed that the other person was wearing a four-ring mage's robe.

He didn't expect that a 7th-level mage would not have mastered the "Core Four Transformation".

The other person still hadn't mastered the fourth-level "shape-shifting technique", which was understandable. But he hadn't even mastered the second-level "transformation technique"?!

The transformation technique can transform into the same species as the same body, such as Zhao Xu can use this technique to transform into a sprite, and there are various creative uses for it, so the "transformation technique" is absolutely a hot technique.

When it comes to shape-shifting, it can also transform into more species, and the limit of HD (life dice) is less, which is similar to the traditional concept of shape-shifting.

Zhao Xu thought to himself that shape-shifting techniques must have some unknown barriers.

"Hey, it's just to learn the powerful shape-shifting technique, isn't it?" Fat Lin Qi sighed, feeling sorry for the middle-level mages who had left the scene.

Middle-level mages who can cast spells from the fourth to the sixth level are already the backbone of King Arthur's power, and even the high-level mages who are frequently in contact with Zhao Xu are relatively insignificant.
Here is the translation of the text:

The entire hall suddenly emptied, with the number of people dwindling from three-quarters to nearly one-quarter. Only a few high-level magicians remained seated, completely unaffected by the conditions that followed. However, Zhao Xu discovered that Lin Qi, a fat man, was also packing up his chair, and he couldn't help but ask curiously, "Why are you leaving too? Can't you?"

Lin Qi, however, looked at Zhao Xu with a surprised expression.

He lowered his voice and said, "It's you who should ask me, why are you still staying?"

"Don't you see that the middle-level magicians are all hiding and leaving? Those who don't have the second-level shape-shifting technique are also leaving. By staying, you're just challenging the nine-ring high-level magicians."

As Lin Qi spoke, he couldn't help but reveal a hint of fear.

"I'm advising you to leave quickly, your one-ring magician's uniform is too conspicuous. Even if you have the Shining Silver, it won't work. The eyes of the Nochi magicians are like the Sahara Desert."

Lin Qi urged Zhao Xu, thinking that the other should recognize the situation and leave quickly. However, Zhao Xu remained unmoved.

Lin Qi waited for a while, but Zhao Xu didn't get up or give up his seat. He could only awkwardly reopen his chair and sit down.

"Uh, aren't you leaving?"

Zhao Xu's words pierced Lin Qi's heart like a knife.

"Oh, I forgot that I just mastered the four-level 'Shape-shifting Technique' at noon. Ah, it's just that people's memories decline with age."

Lin Qi clenched his teeth and growled in anger.

At this point, the number of people in the hall had dwindled to nearly one-quarter, and Nochi's eyes even nodded in satisfaction.

Another round or two, and it would be almost down to one-tenth.

He sneered to himself, thinking that even these brainless, mud-brained magicians couldn't master shape-shifting techniques?
Here is the translation:

"However, his gaze had always been fixed on the back row, constantly lingering, and only returned to find a man dressed in a Level One Mage robe sitting in the corner of the front row."

"The mage in the corner of the front row, have you used any of the spells from the Core Four Transformations?"
