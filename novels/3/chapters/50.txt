Chapter 5: Divine Favor

Lian heard these words and almost lost his composure, thinking that his magical techniques had malfunctioned and connected to someone else's body.

Even though he had his magical techniques on, he turned his head around to confirm that there were only the two of them present.

Lian quickly used his mental connection technique to continue speaking, saying, "You're being a bit excessive."

For the first time, Zhao Xiu, who was usually calm and composed, felt a slight sense of unease and explained, "It's just luck."

"What luck is this? This is divine favor. I think I should write a report and make you a pastor. What's the use of being a scholar of the ancient arts? It's not like you're getting divine favor. You're just being pampered by the gods. You can even get something by just waving your hand."

"You know that I brought these things to help you accelerate your awakening in the realm. None of these things are something to be borrowed. For example, this magical notebook written by the goddess herself is only privately circulated among the elite. If it weren't for the goddess's intervention as the third-generation descendant, I would have thought you were the goddess's own..."

Just as Lian finished speaking, he felt his hair standing on end.

He quickly bowed his head and said, "Goddess, forgive me. I've spoken out of turn. I'll donate a pen as a penance and apologize."

He couldn't help but feel fear. Zhao Xiu, who had just received divine favor and directly entered the realm, didn't know if the goddess's gaze was still fixed on him.

Lian's mental connection technique was no different from holding a trumpet in front of the goddess's divine power.

In the second generation of magical goddesses, mages would perform magic by relying on the magical network.
Here is the translation of the text:

The Goddess can easily break the mage's web, making it impossible for the mage to absorb mana.

After the third-generation Goddess became a goddess, she directly dispersed the magical web, turning it into a natural attribute of all planes.

This means that the vast majority of mages will no longer have to worry about their webs being broken.

This is also the reason why the third-generation Magical Goddess is revered by the vast majority of mages.

Other gods may not have abandoned this tool for controlling a group of mages.

Zhao Xu looked at Lei An with a face full of discontent, and Lei An, who was notorious for his boldness even in the church headquarters, was able to live till today thanks to the powerful mage profession.

"Lei An, where are we going next?" Zhao Xu asked.

"Yeah, have you prepared your divine magic?" Lei An stroked his chin, pretending to be deep in thought.

Zhao Xu nodded, "I finished preparing it yesterday."

"So you're quite clever, knowing when to pray at the right time. Let's go, I'll take you to see a high-ranking bishop."

Zhao Xu didn't explain that he had successfully prepared his divine magic at noon the previous day, and hurried to catch up with Lei An's figure, asking, "High-ranking bishop?"

He didn't expect to be related to a high-ranking bishop.

"This bishop can teach you how to cast spells freely. This ability can convert any prepared divine magic into a healing spell."

"It's also thanks to this ability that priests can sustain the healing plane. Otherwise, mages like us would be overwhelmed by various spellbooks."

Lei An said, and suddenly felt Zhao Xu's footsteps stop.

He turned back to look at Zhao Xu, with a guess that suddenly popped into his mind.

"Are you telling me that you can also learn the ability to cast spells freely?"

Zhao Xu nodded directly.
Here is the translation of the text:

"I... you dare to say you're not...?" Rai An thought carefully before deciding not to say this sentence out loud.

He was still dependent on the goddess and had no intention of rebelling.

"Ah, too bad. You're the chosen inheritor of the scroll and the one who will continue the path of God's dual cultivation. Without you, it's uncertain whether you can become the head of the church."

Zhao Xu thought for a moment before deciding not to reveal the truth about the goddess to Anziniya without her consent.

"That's where we'll go next?" Zhao Xu changed the subject.

"We'll have to go find Bishop Sojer. He was just promoted yesterday and will be taking over the entire church in the North District. He can teach you other abilities and give you a private lesson, so you won't have to attend regular classes and scare other people."

When Zhao Xu heard the name Sojer, he stopped in his tracks, then continued walking.

The owner of this name was someone he knew.

Bishop Sojer was going to take up his new post in the city of Winter City, which was also the place where he spent his previous life.

In his previous life, this bishop had distinguished himself in the Seal of Magic War and was promoted to become the youngest cardinal in history, responsible for the entire North District of the Goddess Church.

This was a goal that was too lofty for him to achieve, and even the town's chief of police had to bow down to him. Moreover, he had come to give Zhao Xu, a novice pastor, a lesson at the request of Rai An.

This identity reversal made Zhao Xu feel a sense of absurdity.

After all, some people were born with a sense of destiny.

He had been unable to reach those high-ranking figures in the church who were out of his league.
Now it is only possible to see the existence that others can arrange with just a guide.
At that time, Zhao Xu's classmates could only perform the "resurrection of the dead" if the body was intact, which was only a fifth-level resurrection spell.
If he could have contacted the higher levels of the church at that time, perhaps he could have begged them to perform the ninth-level divine spell "complete resurrection" that does not require a body for resurrection.
In this way, he might not have pursued the path of revenge so hard.
Maybe he wouldn't have crossed over either.
Zhao Xu followed Lei An through the stone tower of the church, layer by layer, as if there was no end.
During this time, he encountered many priests, all of whom nodded to Lei An.
This slightly elevated Zhao Xu's assessment of Lei An's actual position.
Observing the passing formal priests, Zhao Xu slowly realized that the proportion of women was not small.
At first, the ratio of men and women in the church's staff and morning prayers he encountered made him think that most of the priests at the church headquarters were male.
Finally, Zhao Xu and Lei An arrived at their destination.
At the end of the corridor, the embroidered golden-edged mahogany door closed lightly, emitting a faint scent of incense from inside.
Without saying a word, Lei An knocked twice and then pushed the door open.
Zhao Xu followed Lei An's figure directly into the room, only to find that it was not an office as he had imagined, but a relatively large meeting room.
The decoration of the meeting room was quite luxurious, and the carpet alone was quite valuable.
When Zhao Xu sat on the soft and thick sofa in the palace style, he almost didn't react, sinking into the soft sofa.
Here is the translation:

"So, this young man is the new recruit, Zong Xia, who has already mastered three fields. You can just teach him something else directly," Lei An said, sitting down with a swagger, almost kicking his legs up.

Looking at the Archbishop So Shi pouring red tea, Zhao Xu still stood up straight.

So Shi's eyes sparkled, and he lifted his head to gaze at Zhao Xu, speaking in a rich, mellow tone:

"Are you the priest chosen by the Goddess?"

"Priest?" Zhao Xu asked in surprise.
