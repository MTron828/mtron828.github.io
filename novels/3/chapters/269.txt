Chapter 270: The Nine Sword System
Anti-Magic Field!
This six-ring arcane is also a priest's eight-ring divine magic.
As a result, the mage group ends up using it less, and more jobs use it to counter mages.
To engage in combat with mages, warriors must first resolve the issue of mobility.
Mages with three to four rings have inherent mobility advantages, including flight, teleportation, and interdimensional jumping, which are further enhanced by abilities like "Instant Explosion" possessed by wealthy individuals like Zhao Xu.
Warriors lack a means of instantaneous teleportation, making it difficult for them to approach them.
In the early stages, everyone believes that distance is the greatest defense.
By the time they reach the six-ring level, even mediocre mages can learn core triggering techniques.
Mages at this level are basically unkillable and can be killed by warriors up close, making it difficult to comprehend.
Alternatively, a mage who has exhausted their spell slots must still hold on to the fight, but they will not survive to reach this level.
The "Anti-Magic Field" with a range of only three meters is a warrior's ultimate technique against high-level mages.
However, many warriors lack the ability to instantly activate the "Anti-Magic Field".
As Zhao Xu knows, the "Higher Storage Ring" worth 90,000 gold coins can store up to 10 rings of magic, allowing the wearer to release the stored magic.
However, the wearer must find a spellcaster to re-store the magic, which is a tedious process.
Therefore, even if Zhao Xu becomes a legendary mage, he will always be wary of "Anti-Magic Field" and "Mage Disintegration" techniques, which are particularly effective against mages.
Here is the translation:

In the future, he will also need to focus on these spells, building his own defensive engineering to the point where he can automatically dodge and counterattack.

Relying solely on his own strength to fight is the most unreliable approach.

A true mage is one who can respond to the appearance of a target spell by automatically combining his own spells to solve the problem.

Zhao Xu's various response methods, including his "Stellar Cloak" and the "Reflective Shield" ability he obtained later, are all built upon spells.

A "Reverse Magic Zone" can penetrate his heavy defense.

Moreover, he cannot cast spells within the Reverse Magic Zone, even with his extraordinary abilities, unless he escapes the three-meter radius range.

The current "Iron Will" can allow him to escape this state and other negative effects related to spellcasting.

It is a powerful ability to forcibly remove negative effects.

However, there is no free lunch in the world.

The prerequisite for advancing a profession has locked out countless people.

Even Zhao Xu, who can simulate specialization, is still limited by the prerequisite.

He could simulate the "Soothing Slash" skill using "Potential Points" when he obtained the additional warrior specialization "Furious Attack" through the two-ringed spell "Soul Attachment".

The "Martial Arts Learning" skill allows him to demonstrate a selected technique in a short time.

The skill itself is not a secret.

What's valuable is that this skill is linked to the "Iron Will" technique behind it, which is a top-secret technique of the Dongtou Empire's nine-star sword.

This is what Zhao Xu has been dreaming of.

However, Zhao Xu is now feeling overwhelmed by the prerequisite conditions of this skill.
Here is the translation of the text:

"The stronger you are, the more complex the setup becomes." Anxinyue smiled slightly as she looked at Zhao Xu's face.

It was clear that she also understood the setup of "Iron Heart's Power".

"Teacher, do you also have this ability?" Zhao Xu asked.

"Of course," Anxinyue smiled lightly. "As your teacher, I wouldn't let you learn and not learn."

Zhao Xu immediately thought of the inconsistent places. "Are the contents of these fragments of truth consistent?"

However, Anxinyue just shook her head. "Not necessarily. Some are not specialized, but rather other resources. You're wondering how I learned the method of 'Iron Heart's Power'?"

"When the Eastern Empire was founded, I also contributed a part of my strength. Naturally, I have mastered their system. However, I made a vow not to disclose their heritage to outsiders."

"Do you think I just got crushed by the anti-magic field?"

Looking at Zhao Xu's astonished expression, Anxinyue continued. "After I unleashed Iron Heart's Power, my latent potential automatically recovered. At that time, I could directly recover my spellcasting position, not to mention the series of techniques I have."

"Hey, hey, not that I didn't move my hands," Lakshmi said at this time, knowing that she had just scolded Zhao Xu for not taking the initiative to make a move.

The Eastern Nine Swords System, in fact, got its name from its nine major martial arts styles: Iron Heart, Stone Dragon, White Crow, Desert Wind, Steel Soul, Sunset, Devoted Heart, Tiger Claw, and Shadow Hand.
Here is the translation:

Within the nine-sword system, there are three major martial arts foundations: the "Military Way Sword" (War Bringer), the "Heavenly Punishment Sword" (Crusader), and the "Sage's Sword" (Martial Artist), each with its own unique styles and ways of using techniques and stances.

"Iron Heart Strength" is actually a "Iron Heart Flow" technique, but it's only at a low level, only three levels in total.

However, in order to learn and use it, you need to master an additional "Iron Heart Flow" technique first.

As a result, Zhao Xu wants to directly use this technique, but he needs to spend his martial arts expertise to master another Iron Heart Flow technique. This means he's essentially using two specialties to get one "Iron Heart Strength".

After that, Zhao Xu is planning to go to the "Half-Devil's Domain" to kill or be killed, and he'll also get a "Steel Will" specialty, which provides a guarantee.

Thinking about this, Zhao Xu couldn't help but look at Anita: "Teacher, how did you do it?"
"I have a part-time martial arts profession," Anita said.

Zhao Xu couldn't help but sigh in secret.

As expected, Anita had just easily flipped over to the mysterious magical image's cabin, not by chance, but because she had received martial arts training.

However, Zhao Xu quickly noticed something was off.

Arthur is not just part-time, and his profession will not have any penalties.

However, if the foundation profession differs by more than one level, it will receive a penalty and increase the difficulty of leveling up. It's estimated that each additional profession will slow down leveling up by about 20%.

For example, a 5th-level warrior who is part-time 1st-level cleric will receive this penalty, unless the opponent is 1st-level warrior or 2nd-level cleric.

However, humans have a natural racial talent that allows them to waive the penalty of part-time professions.

Therefore, Zhao Xu's 1st-level cleric part-time 4th-level scripture scholar has been exempted from his 4th-level scripture due to his human racial talent.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

While Anxiya might be the same, the opponent is definitely a 1-star pastor, and they also have other martial arts professions, as long as they are only 1-2 stars, and they won't be punished. However, if it's that simple, the mages would have already taken on part-time jobs.

The part-time job that is one level lower has no effect on increasing magical abilities.

So, Zhao Xu is now a 5-star person, but because he took on a 1-star pastor part-time job, his studies have lagged behind by one level.

"Teacher, shouldn't mages take on part-time jobs?" Zhao Xu asked.

If he wasn't a dual genius, he probably wouldn't take on a 1-star pastor part-time job.

"Yes, it would affect the progress of getting high-level spells. Mainly, I took on the part-time job after becoming a legendary, and I can freely use the nine-ring skills from both sides of the divine, so it didn't affect anything," Anxiya said.

"Ah, so it's a legendary mage who is taking advantage of the situation," Lakis said, interrupting with a sarcastic tone.

However, Zhao Xu didn't say a word, but instead thought about the pros and cons.

Everything is about making a choice. Anxiya waited until she became a legendary before getting the Ironheart Power, and by then, the growth rate of her magical abilities had slowed down a lot. Compared to taking on a part-time job as a martial artist, she got a much greater return.

But Zhao Xu couldn't wait that long.

Compared to Anxiya, he needs to face the issue of part-time jobs earlier.

Because in the route designed for his future, "Red Jade Guard" is the advanced profession of the Nine Swords, and he needs to master the "Devoted Flow" and "Devoted Flow" stance. The Devoted Flow is also the unique style of the "Heavenly Executioner's Sword", and if he doesn't take on a 1-star Heavenly Executioner part-time job, he won't be able to progress smoothly, which would disrupt the balance of the world.
Here is the translation of the text:

While "Ironheart's Power" is located in "Ironheart Stream", it is also an exclusive school of "Military Sword" and requires a 1st-level military sword technique to be mastered before using "Martial Arts Learning" to grasp the 3rd-level technique "Ironheart Power".

Zhao Xu felt his head ache and directly glanced at the 3rd expertise "Arcane Mastery".

Upon a rough glance, Zhao Xu found that this expertise was somewhat mediocre.

When casting spells, mages need to overcome the "Antimagic Resistance" unique to certain biological beings.

It was just like Zhao Xu's previous battle against "Deep Infernal Forge". He had to weaken the opponent's antimagic resistance before he could successfully cast "Public Justice Hammer" on him.

The penetration of antimagic resistance is determined by the caster's level and the performance evaluation of the previous casting, which is a scale of 1-20. If the result exceeds the antimagic resistance, the spell can take effect; otherwise, it will be blocked.

"Arcane Mastery" can allow Zhao Xu to stabilize his performance to the level of 10.

From then on, he would know whether his spellcasting would penetrate the opponent before casting, and he would no longer rely on luck or chance.

Mages, after all, prefer things with certainty.

Zhao Xu did not necessarily need to spend expertise to master it. He could use "Potential Point" simulation at any time.

Unlike "Ironheart Power", which requires a long time to use, "Potential Point" simulation can be used immediately, but he would face the problem of no temporary potential point.

So, he had to choose between "Simulation of Supernatural Ability" and "Ironheart Power".

"Teacher, do I have all the options?" Zhao Xu asked casually.

"Yes," Anzhiya replied casually as well.
