Chapter 154: No Compensation

Zhao Xu had once watched an ancient fantasy film "The Matrix" that explored the theme of hackers.

One scene that many people remembered was when the main character was facing a hail of bullets and time seemed to slow down, allowing him to dodge the bullets with ease. This phenomenon was later referred to as "bullet time".

The swift release series of spells was similar to this. However, it was different from the time-stop spell in one crucial aspect.

The time-stop spell had the effect that time around it was frozen, and it couldn't affect the external world in a substantial way. On the other hand, in the state of swift release, time was still flowing, so Zhao Xu could still cast spells like the fireball spell to kill people.

Once he could avoid the aftereffects of the spell, which would make him dizzy, it meant that Pandora's box had been opened. Now, Zhao Xu was no longer the same naive young man he used to be. He immediately thought of various possibilities that could disrupt the balance.

"Is triggering cancellation an option?" Zhao Xu said.

When he cast the "Revival" spell on Aisveri, allowing her to re-roll a saving throw. If Zhao Xu had been at level 3 at the time, he could have cast the level 2 divine spell "Ring of Honor" to directly remove Aisveri's fear state, sparing her the need to roll again.

Therefore, as long as someone could cast a spell that could remove the dizziness effect on him after he fell into a dizzy state, it would work.

"That's your plan?" Annyon asked Zhao Xu, who was finally thinking logically like a mage.

"Like casting the 'Universal Remedy' spell?" Zhao Xu provided a thought process.
Here is the translation of the text:

The "Wan Ling Yao" is a four-level divine art that can remove 13 kinds of negative states from the practitioner, including dizziness. "Don't you think it's too expensive to find someone to cast a four-level divine art for you?" Anzhiya asked. "Even a pet can't keep up with you like this." Zhao Xun's heart suddenly cleared up.

The plan is feasible, but it needs to be further optimized.

As the pet's level increases, it will obtain the ability to cast spells, such as zero-level spells, but only to that extent. Even if there is a spell that can grant the pet the ability to cast spells, it is still limited.

Zhao Xun's direction needs to be thought out at a lower cost.

It's not just the "Wan Ling Yao" spell that can remove negative states.

Zhao Xun began to think about the spells in his mind, and his eyes gradually brightened up.

"Medical Knowledge" is a second-level divine art for priests, but also a first-level divine art for rangers, so Zhao Xun has already mastered this spell.

After casting this spell, as long as Zhao Xun has a 5-level medical skill level, he can cast a level 1 spell like "Minor Wound Healing" to add an effect to remove negative states.

This includes the "dizziness" state.

The pet and its owner share the spell state, and they can both enjoy the effect of "Medical Knowledge".

So, Zhao Xun's pet can cast a zero-level spell "Minor Wound Healing" once when it's dizzy to trigger the effect of "Medical Knowledge" and remove the "dizziness" state.

The 1 HP healing amount of "Minor Wound Healing" is negligible, as long as it belongs to the "Curative Magic" spell.

"However, letting someone else or the pet treat yourself is ultimately passive." Zhao Xun thought with a low head.
As the number of involved parties increases, the likelihood of problems arising also increases. It's indeed very risky to entrust matters of life and death to multiple parties. After he lost his balance, things were no longer under his control. This was not a risk that a rational wizard should take.

"Indeed," Anzola nodded slightly.

After being with Anzola for a long time, Zhao Xu had already understood her intentions. If this path could only lead to this point, Anzola would likely have told him it was unrealistic from the start, rather than continuing to guide him to think about it.

Zhao Xu continued to recall the spells he had cast.

The few days he spent in the scroll space were the most extravagant in his life in terms of spellcasting.

His impression of magic was also extremely deep.

Even spells above the 3rd level were not within his known repertoire, and he could only recall them through memory.

Suddenly, Zhao Xu's entire body froze.

He thought of a spell that left him with some difficulty to believe.

Anzola looked at him with an expectant gaze.

Zhao Xu whispered, "Is it the Spell of Energy Flow Therapy?"

The Spell of Energy Flow Therapy was a 5th-level divine magic.

During the spellcasting process, within a 6-meter range around Zhao Xu, anyone casting a spell would automatically absorb energy from the flow of magic, receiving treatment effects of the spellcasting system. Zhao Xu would also trigger this effect when he cast the spell himself.

Therefore, every time Zhao Xu cast the "Swift Burst" series of spells, he would essentially release a healing spell for himself.

This healing effect would then trigger the effect of the 1st-level spell "Medical Knowledge," removing the effect of "dizziness" from him.
Here is the translation:

After going through this logical process, Zhao Xu has already felt that when the level of magic reaches a certain extent, many seemingly costly spells can be avoided through the use of spell chains.

This is a lesson taught by Anxinyue to him. Magic indeed has strengths and weaknesses, but each spell has its own strengths and weaknesses that need to be excavated.

The library has many materials about magic, but most of them are limited to core magic series. For example, the "Lightning Flash" spell might not have existed in Zhao Xu's lifetime if he hadn't encountered it in the "Final Scroll" space. Some nine-ring mages may not even know of its existence.

"Alright, don't daydream anymore. Your first thought validation has passed, now let's talk about the second one," Anxinyue asked.

This time, Zhao Xu didn't even think twice before saying, "The second thought is immunity."

The strongest defense is indeed immunity, as embodied by the name "Immunity."

By continuously stacking defense levels, Zhao Xu's "Ghostly Strike" spell could potentially render the stacked values meaningless.

Only spells like Zhao Xu's "Starlight Cloak," which can repel non-magical attacks and deflect magical attacks with a successful reflexive dodge, can be considered true defenses.

The same applies to dizzying effects.

"What's the implementation?" Anxinyue asked.

"Merciful Protection?"

Zhao Xu slowly spoke out the unique four-level divine skill of the Saint Warrior, which he could release at level 8, while the Saint Warrior could only learn it at level 13.
Here is the translation of the text:

"This spell only occupies a single slot in the spellbook, yet it can immunize against various negative states such as dizziness, exhaustion, and fatigue, and even maintain consciousness even when HP falls to 0 or below. The only regret is that it cannot be combined with healing magic or medical knowledge to prolong its effect.

"Well, you already have a general understanding of the spell list, so I won't say much more," Anzhi replied after listening to Zhao Xu's response. She lightly nodded and continued, "Have you found the loophole?"

"No limit?"

Zhao Xu finally brought a slightly uncertain tone into his voice.

In the context of combat games, "no limit" means to continuously attack an opponent until they are defeated. In this spell, however, "no limit" means that Zhao Xu can continuously cast this spell to sustain his speed and agility.

Especially if he casts the higher-level "Higher-Speed Burst" spell, he will gain an additional 6 seconds of time. During this time, he can continuously cast this spell and any other spells he has. As long as his spell slots are not exhausted, he can maintain this state.

In this state, any spells he casts will affect anyone, and others will be unable to move. He can keep casting spells until his slots are exhausted.

A person who can do this is basically unbeatable.

Even if Zhao Xu can only cast the lower-level "Secondary-Speed Burst" spell, which only allows for a single move, he can still perform various tactics. Even if someone attacks him, he can forcefully cast this spell to create distance.

"So this spell was eventually corrected by the World's Will after it was abused," Anzhi interjected at this point."
Here is the translation of the text:

"In a multiverse, there's a rule that you can't gain an advantage without sacrificing something. If you get an extra action, you'll inevitably get dizzy if you try to do it again. But if you're immune, you can't cast this spell again."

"As for Arthur, it's a definite cost-based rule. You can only cast this spell again after the cost takes effect."

Anzhi explained.

When Zhao Xu heard this, he finally understood.

He could enjoy the first swift explosion, and after that, he wouldn't get dizzy again. However, when he tried to cast the spell again, he had to accept the aftereffects of the previous dizziness, which allowed him to continue casting the spell.

As a result, this also made it impossible for him to continuously cast the "swift explosion" series of spells, making it so that others could only watch him play alone.

At this point, Zhao Xu also began to notice that most of the methods he thought of were related to divine magic.

Ordinary mages didn't have divine magic and had to go through a lot of trouble, naturally without the convenience of dual cultivation like him.

But Zhao Xu quickly realized that he had thought too much.

Ordinary mages, where did they learn such spells?

"Okay, let's do a test now," Anzhi suddenly said with a playful smile as she pulled out a pair of deep red high-top boots from the dimensional bag. The boot soles were bright copper.

"Considering you used the secondary swift explosion spell, the time available for movement is very limited. So, these instant step boots will be used as the prize for the next test."

"It only needs to trigger the use of movement, and you can use it five times a day, each time allowing for a short-distance teleportation of 6 meters."

Zhao Xu looked at the boots, his eyes shining with excitement.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Ordinarily, he can also use these boots for short-distance teleportation. Moreover, since the startup time is short, he can fully release a "mark" spell and then start the teleportation boots within one round. At the moment of death, even if someone slashes at him with a sword, he can calmly release the "sub-level burst" spell and then use the extreme time to start the teleportation boots. This is the most original kite warfare tactic. "Why not try it?" Zao Xun said with a confident smile to An Ti Nuo Ya."
