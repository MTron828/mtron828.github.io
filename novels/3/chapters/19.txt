Chapter 20: Dragon Language and Spellcasting

Zhao Xu couldn't tell what was going on under Anniya's helmet. However, her subsequent actions made it clear that she was still quite pleased.

"Well done, you've made your choice. But I also hope you won't regret it in the future," she said.

"Compared to those wizards who are researching in the floating city, as a battle wizard, you may face various dangers and near-death experiences," she added.

Zhao Xu laughed carelessly at Anniya's words. In those days of seeking revenge, he had often bitten his tongue and honed himself.

"If I wasn't certain that you couldn't greatly modify your face and age, I would have thought you were a middle-aged man," he said with a bitter smile.

"Alright, then take a look at this book. First, convert your language, and you should still have some language credits left," she said.

A thick book flew straight into Zhao Xu's hand from the bookshelf.

He knew this was Anniya's level-zero arcane magic. What was strange was that Anniya had not made any magical gestures throughout.

It was as if she was speaking and the book was responding automatically.

Zhao Xu weighed the book in his hand and gently touched the cover of the book, which had the title "Dragon Language Secret Manual".

He looked up at Anniya with a puzzled expression.

"Am I supposed to learn the language now? Do I no longer need to read those magic theory books?" he asked.

Anniya sat carelessly on the soft sofa in the room, which was her first time sitting down in three days.

"I originally wanted you to read it so that you could identify some content automatically in the future. This was just a way to hone your character," she said.

Zhao Xu didn't expect that An Ti Nuo Ya meant this, and he looked at her with curiosity.

"Magic is such a mysterious power. As soon as you start using it, you're already rushing to cast spells. If you don't show reverence for magic, you're just a craftsman of magic, no different from those cannons mounted on city walls."

"Even when you're researching, lacking this sense of reverence will only bring disaster."

As An Ti Nuo Ya spoke these words, her tone was slightly melancholic.

"Actually, by the time you return to your dormitory the next day, you'll realize that you and the other players have received a different kind of mage training."

"Basically, every mage will undergo identification. Some people will have the same experience as you, starting from reading ancient texts. You are the chosen ones."

"What's different is that those who actively read the classics are making their own choices. But you are being forced by me. The advantage is that you will definitely follow the right path and receive true guidance. The disadvantage is that I'll decide when this stage ends."

Zhao Xu couldn't believe that within a few sentences, An Ti Nuo Ya had revealed a top-level secret to him.

He asked why the mages of the past wanted to learn advanced and powerful skills, but found it difficult.

It turned out that there was an additional hurdle - learning the fundamental principles and concepts first, which would naturally lead to a smooth arrangement.

But before learning the magic models, they had to slowly and painstakingly practice casting spells.

What was the best time to prove one's character and when to start interacting with the colorful mage society.

This was a point that no one had ever mentioned on the forum in the past.
Here is the translation of the text:

Some high-level mages in the game may advise new players to read the magical texts inside. However, Zhao Xu still finds it a bit difficult to understand. "Isn't this filtering method too rigid?" "You were just praised for being mature. In this society with many organizations, the Mage Association can only arrange a few initial specialties and possible advancements for you. After reaching level 5, it's up to each individual to find their own opportunities. Those who are mistaken will also rely on their own strength to rise up." Zhao Xu took a deep breath, recalling the difficulties of novice mages in the past. The association must bear some responsibility for this.

Just like him, humans are born with one innate specialty and two defects, and one initial specialty for a 1st-level character, which adds up to four. Four powerful specialties and four useless ones are like heaven and earth apart.

Zhao Xu could only say that he had a natural sense of reverence towards Arthur due to his past experiences. This allowed him to pass the initial test set by Anniya.

Zhao Xu's attention was drawn back to the book given to him by Anniya.

"Many ancient texts are written in Draconic script, so there is an item in the mage's profession requirements that involves Draconic. You can try to convert this language after reading it through," Anniya said.

Zhao Xu knew that this conversion was actually activating their Draconic translation function.

Everyone is born with the ability to speak the common language and their native language, and can also learn an additional language equal to their intelligence adjustment value. He had a +3 intelligence adjustment value, which was just enough to learn three additional languages.

He lacked the opportunity to activate his mastery of Draconic before.
Here is the translation of the text:

It seems to me now that the secret manual in my hand is the legendary key to awakening the Dragon Language that players have been talking about, allowing them to convert it into a real Dragon Language.

But what I didn't expect was that they have things like dragon bones, dragon skin, and dragon blood, and I'm actually holding a real book.

Before I knew it, Zhao Xu finished reading and found that his personal panel had also been updated.

Zhao Xu finally learned about his identity as a Secret Keeper, probably the lowest level in the organization.

However, Anzhiya didn't seem to relax at all, and the books on the bookshelf flew over one by one and were placed on his desk.

"You first read the first book, 'Basic Model of Magic', and then the second book, 'Incantation and Posture - On the Composition of Magic', and then the last book, 'Zero-Level Magic Manual', and that's it."
"Once you've read these three books, I'll come back and confirm your choice of first expertise."

Hearing these words, Zhao Xu's eyes almost welled up with tears. He finally took the first step, starting to learn magic.

Immediately, Zhao Xu's entire being became calm, and he entered a learning state.
Here's the translation:

Just like every novice mage, Arthur couldn't understand and memorized the various magical models by rote. He simply looked at the magical theories without any practical application. However, these few books represented his progress bar, which was only 1% complete. As a result, his enthusiasm was completely different.

Annie listened to his page-turning sounds, as if she had a sixth sense, and clearly knew what content he was looking at and what doubts he had in his heart. She gradually explained the content to him.

As for the other mage academies on the mainland, countless apprentices were copying out the models and memorizing them, only to be qualified to move on to the next stage by reciting them word-for-word.

According to the instructors, even simple books couldn't be memorized, so what qualifications did they have to become mages?
