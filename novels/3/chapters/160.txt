Chapter 161: Oath of Origin

Zhao Xu was still reeling from the bizarre suicide of the legendary mage when he heard the voice from above. He almost jumped out of his skin.

"Respectful elder brother, it's time to settle the rewards. Hurry up and choose two upgrades."

"This is just too ridiculous?"

Zhao Xu was confused. He wouldn't be foolish enough to think that the legendary mage was real; it was just an illusion created by the monument's consciousness.

He was simply being used as a pawn to give him a show and reward him.

"This isn't ridiculous at all," the voice said. "It's mainly because the aura of the strong on your body is too intense. Even the legendary mage summoned from history would be ashamed to die on the spot after seeing you. Ah, this is just unavoidable. A genius like you, with a radiant aura, is naturally going to shine through."

As the consciousness in the void sighed, "If I didn't have a powerful Qi, this space wouldn't be able to withstand your invincible pressure, and it would collapse immediately."

Zhao Xu shrugged his shoulders and shook his head.

Just then, his legs felt a bit numb, and he lifted his heel slightly before shaking it out.

Suddenly, the entire ground shook violently, with Zhao Xu's heel as the center, sending a massive seismic wave radiating upwards.

The originally calm lake surface suddenly erupted like a water bomb at the bottom of the lake, producing a massive roar, and a whirlpool-like water curtain shot up towards the sky, transforming into a fine rain.

Immediately after, the duck that was still swimming peacefully was struck by the shockwave and flew up, plummeting to the ground in front of Zhao Xu, and fell into a coma.
Here is the translation:

As the mountain ranges farther away began to shudder and break apart, directly under the seismic waves, and slowly sink to the ground. The original afternoon scenery suddenly turned into a chaotic mess, with weeds growing wildly everywhere.

Zhao Xu cocked his head and glanced at his own heel.

If this were the real world, this wouldn't be a display of strength, but a burden.

He felt that the so-called "Seven Seven" stone tablet was a bit clumsy in its intention.

However, this stone tablet couldn't be explained by ordinary logic, and Zhao Xu suddenly changed his line of thought and decided to exchange some other topics with the other party.

As Zhao Xu turned back, he noticed that the stone bench behind him had already disappeared the moment he stood up.

Just as he was about to turn back, the originally green grass suddenly erupted into a mound of earth.

Then tree branches burst out of the ground, becoming thick and robust, like a tree that had grown for a hundred years. The tree trunk then twisted and straightened, taking the shape of a natural wooden chair.

Zhao Xu nodded and patted his thigh, saying that the service level was quite good.

He sat down on the chair, gazing at the blue sky and asked, "When did you become conscious?"

This allowed Zhao Xu to clarify whether the stone tablet he had encountered in the ancient era before the dawn of time had consciousness, or if the mysterious projection he had seen was just a trick by the other party.

"The older brother's question is a straightforward one. Unlike those cunning wizards who came to test me earlier, I don't know where to start, and the few who can speak and act well just make me feel disgusted. It's indeed the older brother's candid and sincere attitude that is the most authentic, and I'm really moved to tears, wah wah wah."

The voice from the void spoke, growing increasingly choked with emotion.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Uh, what's my question again?" Zhao Xu suddenly realized that the topic had taken a tangent, and he couldn't help but ask further.

"Oh, oh, that's it," the voice suddenly returned to normal, as if the previous scene was just a recording, "Mainly, it's my grandfather Ernest, who one day passed through the Miraculous Forest and saw that I had a peculiar skeleton, and thought I could bring him eternal good luck. Then, he used a spell that could awaken one's innate abilities, and he was stimulated."

The voice was no longer as excited as before, and had a slightly melancholic tone.

"Miraculous Forest?" Zhao Xu immediately paid attention to the name.

"That's the area below the floating city of Mistral," he said. "In those days, during the Dark Age era that mages refer to, Mistral was a ruined forest."

Zhao Xu suddenly reacted.

Annyoja had made him travel back in time to the Dark Age era, but in reality, he had never left Mistral.

Mistral, as the birthplace of the third-generation magic goddess, possessed an extraordinary significance.

And this stone monument, which Ernest had inscribed with a magical symbol, appeared in ancient times.

Perhaps there were deeper secrets behind it.

"Did Ernest take you away?" Zhao Xu continued to ask.

This was related to Ernest's secrets and the heritage of the Itel kingdom, and Zhao Xu was curious.

"Of course, Ernest grandfather gave me a name with seven characters, and then he transformed and miniaturized me and brought me along with him."

After hearing this, Zhao Xu also realized that when he traveled back in time, Ernest had not yet inscribed the stone monument, and it was even possible that Ernest had not been born yet.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Why did you call me 'Qī Qī'?" Zhao Xu asked, and generally, magical items and divine artifacts all have names that are quite impressive.

"Because he met me on the seventh day of the seventh month," the voice in the void said with a hint of melancholy. "He said that this day is very meaningful to him."

"Why do you call me 'Dà Gē'?" Zhao Xu said with a nonchalant tone.

His eyes also revealed a serious expression, gazing at the boundless sky.

"Because I can see that someone can control this world," the voice in the void said with a hint of pride.

"Now, let me reintroduce myself," the voice in the void said with growing arrogance. "My other name is 'Mìng Yùn zhī Shí', the Stone of Destiny."

"I also have fragments of the divine essence of the god of fate on my body," the voice in the void said with increasing arrogance.

Zhao Xu's face was filled with questions.

Even though Zhao Xu had just started to touch the world of magic, he still clearly understood one thing.

When gods obtain divine essence fragments, they will either consolidate or obtain corresponding divine positions.

So, a solidified divine essence fragment is equivalent to a guilty conscience.

According to reason, the one who should come to collect this fragment is not the magic goddess Sylvana, but...

"Oh, I forgot, you're the pastor of the little Sylvana," the voice in the void said with a hint of embarrassment.

Zhao Xu felt that the other party was calling Sylvana "little Sylvana", and he had to correct him.

Even though Zhao Xu could return to his pastoral duties, his curiosity was sparked by the other party's words and he couldn't help but suppress his thoughts.

"Because Sylvana has those divine essence fragments on her body, which were cut off from me," the voice in the void said with a hint of bitterness. "If she hadn't sworn an oath to Arthur to ensure the end of the war, I wouldn't have bothered to talk to her."
Here is the translation of the text:

At this time, the stone monument finally got to call the name of the magic goddess, although it wasn't very respectful to be honest.

However, after hearing about the War of the End, Zhao Xu knew that his curiosity was best left at this point.

This information concerning the end of the world was something that a novice like him shouldn't know too much about, as it was easy to suffer unforeseen consequences.

Zhao Xu turned to ask another question: "Do you think I'm suitable for advancement?"

Just then, the topic of the Empty Will and the Heartache came up, and the person suddenly got excited: "Ah, yes, oh yes. Just now, when you sat down, Anzhi Noya sent me a note. And that ignorant child, Os, also sent me a note. Let me take a look at what it says."

Even though Zhao Xu was waiting to be arranged, hearing the other person mention Anzhi Noya and Os, the head of the Mage Association, with such disdain, he couldn't help but ask: "Do you call them that? Are you not afraid of being struck by them one day?"

"Haha, Anzhi Noya has never been on my good side, that's another story. Os, that young one, was a 5th-level novice when he became a mage, and he cried and complained about the difficulties of being a mage. Later, I felt sorry for him and told him about the awakening method for leadership, and after that, he woke up to his special talent and became 6th-level. From then on, everything went smoothly."

The voice in the Empty Will spoke calmly.

After Zhao Xu heard this, he felt that it would be better to forget this conversation. The immature history of these big shots was too embarrassing.

"Oh, respected elder, they recommended that you advance to 'Sorcerer of the Higher Plane' or 'Curse Text Guardian'. Ah, Os can't do anything, but his gaze on advancement is not bad."

Note: The translation is in Simplified Chinese characters, as per your request.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu narrowed his eyes, and the guardian of the curse text heard Anniya mention that the other party could use the ability of their profession to cast the "wish spell" without any cost, which originally required a huge sacrifice. It's not surprising that he would advance along this path.

However, the super magician, he didn't seem to have any impression, but he should be strong enough.

"Big brother, I'll simulate it for you first, so you can feel the abilities of the two advanced levels in advance. That way, there's no threshold for you." "Wait until you reach level 5, and then I'll impart my knowledge to you. You'll need to prepare accordingly. Then, when fate is kind to you and you reach level 6, you can directly advance to the two advanced levels, and it will be seamless." The voice from the void said with a hint of embarrassment.

Zhao Xu listened and understood the logic. It was the same as when he obtained those spells in the final scroll space.

He nodded and said, "Then let's start?"

"Yes, we need to go through a program first," the voice from the void said awkwardly. "As a dual-professional like you, you can only advance along one career path, and the other path can only advance to the original foundation profession."

Zhao Xu understood immediately.

That is, he could only choose one profession to advance, and the other path could only advance the original foundation profession.

"What's the solution?" Zhao Xu asked.

"There is, big brother. Take an oath and have the magic source agree, and it will be done. For example, some warriors will take a vow of poverty, so they can't get any wealth, but they'll get additional abilities at each level," the voice from the void explained.

"What kind of oath?" Zhao Xu asked.
Here is the translation:

"You swear to defend magic until death, that's fine." Seven Seven briefly said on the stone monument.

"I swear, I will defend magic until death?" Zhao Xu repeated, thinking this phrase was a bit too melodramatic.

【The adventurer Zhong Xia swore an oath, "I will defend magic until death", and the oath took effect.】
