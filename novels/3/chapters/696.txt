Chapter 697: Balroth's Fury

The "Devastating Slash" technique, rumored to be one of the most crucial skills of the Holy Warrior, has been passed down through generations. The technique increases the attacker's charm value and damage output, and even in the late game, its effectiveness remains significant. With Zhao Xu's current strength, holding the +5 Holy Heaven Sword, he can execute the "Devastating Slash" and increase his attack and damage by 10 points.

This time, Zhao Xu's original damage curve, which was near 90 points, suddenly surged to nearly 100 HP, entering a terrifying realm. At this level, most players, including monsters below 10 HD, would be unable to withstand such a brutal attack.

A creature with nearly 115 HP, level 9, with the appearance of a half-human, half-eagle hybrid, felt the "Devastating Slash" and let out a painful cry, calling for help from his teammates.

However, it was already too late. The creature's white feathers began to spread, and a massive wound opened up, as if its entire wing had been slashed. The black-red devil's blood scattered, fell onto the rock-like terrain, and emitted a scorching sound, similar to water boiling on an iron pot. The blood soon evaporated, leaving a black pattern behind.

The creature lost consciousness and fell into the abyssal tunnel. Zhao Xu muttered to himself, then noticed that at least 10 more devil creatures had surrounded him.

Although they feared the distant Heavenly Army, they would not show mercy to a lone Heavenly being like Zhao Xu.

Even in a place as deep as this, it's not easy to encounter celestial beings, and most of the time, what you see is just a summoned projection. If you can actually catch one, it would be a great accomplishment.

It's hard to say whether the demon general above will pardon their escape and even reward them instead. As for Zhao Xu, his physique is average, but compared to these giant demons, it's like a chick compared to an eagle, with a huge psychological advantage.

The few Flamos in front of him quickly exchanged a few sentences in Infernal language and began to close in on him.

As the three Flamos closest to Zhao Xu approached, they were affected by his disease aura.

This is when Zhao Xu felt his power, and he started to wildly sing and chant the name of the demon lord he belonged to, while stretching his limbs and dancing wildly.

Is Zhao Xu talking about the Flamos' ability? But the Flamos behind him suddenly rushed up and surrounded him, without pausing to entangle him, and released a large amount of spores that flew towards him.

These spores, created by the special ability, will cause 1-8 damage once they come into contact with the skin. If they pierce the skin and start to grow, the victim will receive 1-4 damage each turn.

After 10 turns, the victim's body will be covered with a vine-like substance.

Zhao Xu has seen the victims of these spores in the past, during the sealing war. At the time, they were saved by the priest's healing art and managed to survive the continuous damage. Although the vines themselves don't cause harm, they will wither and fall off a few days later.

However, Zhao Xu dislikes these disgusting spores.
Here is the translation of the text:

He directly summoned the Cyclone Technique and instantly created a whirlwind around him, which howled as it blew towards those Flomagos. A few flying Flomagos, who didn't notice, almost lost control of their bodies due to the wind.

The spore attack failed, and other Flomagos launched their "Ear-Piercing Scream" supernatural ability. This attack, which reached an extreme decibel level, could render those with a lower physical condition into a state of shock, making them vulnerable to slaughter.

However, Zhao Xu's robust constitution allowed him to easily ignore this negative attack. He just felt a slight itch in his ear, like a small insect crawling on it, which he brushed off with a gentle scratch.

He was more concerned about the disgusting attacks, such as a snot bomb coming his way, which would not cause him any harm but would definitely make him feel half-dead.

At this time, the heavenly army from the Heavenly Mountain also noticed the battle and sent a team of angels and saints flying towards him.

Zhao Xu also raised his longsword, sneering at the Flomagos who had finally approached him.

The "Spirit Attachment" technique of the Double Ring Art allowed Zhao Xu to naturally acquire the expertise of a warrior, which he had largely selected as "Fierce Attack".

This prerequisite was a 13-point strength warrior expertise, which could weaken his close-range attacks by X levels and increase his damage by 2X, making it a crucial and essential damage increase method for warriors.

This was also the most important output method for warriors when fighting against low-defense, high-life monsters.

Moreover, Zhao Xu now possessed the ability to ignore the innate defense of the Flomagos, which had lost their 11th-level innate defense after this, leaving them with only the basic 10th-level defense and making them as vulnerable as ordinary civilians.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu, with an attack strength close to 50 levels, naturally sacrificed 40 levels and added 80 points of damage to himself, making his sword's damage curve skyrocket to 180 HP.

At this time, he didn't even need to simulate the "Jumping Slash" ability, as his brute force attack would increase the damage threefold to 220 HP, enough to cover the stronger demon.

So even facing the demon Floramo, a hero among demons, he could defeat him with a single sword strike, cutting him in half like a chicken.

At the third round, the originally dancing three Floramos finally completed the "Destruction Dance" prelude.

A gust of evil wind arose!

The three Floramos around them released a massive destruction ability, engulfing all living beings within a 30-meter radius, except demons, with enormous damage.

20D6! This was the combined power of two level 10 fireballs or four level 3 wizards simultaneously casting fireballs.

Luckily, Zhao Xu dodged in time and used his agility to avoid half the damage from the explosion.

His reflexive dodge ability also activated, perfectly dodging the remaining half of the damage.

However, the arriving Saint did not have such good luck, and several of them didn't notice and were blown away, with nearby celestial beings scrambling to rescue them.

Seeing this, Zhao Xu showed no mercy and charged forward with a swift thrust, forcing his way towards another wave of Floramos dancing the "Destruction Dance".

He drew his sword.

In an instant, this Floramo was blown apart by the massive sword force, leaving no bones or flesh behind and disappearing in smoke.

This near-range output also stunned the surrounding angels.
Here is the translation of the text:

"They couldn't help but mutter to themselves, 'Is this the divine servant of the Heavenly Lord? It's unlikely that even the Heavenly Lord himself could accomplish this.' Zhao Xu Ye's killing intent surged, and he directly used his latent ability to simulate a warrior's specialty, 'Flowing Current Slash'.

As he struck down the demon, the residual energy turned back into his body, allowing Zhao Xu Ye to recharge.

With a fierce cry, he launched a powerful attack!

He struck towards another Florem demon, and it dissipated into a blood mist that exploded.

Unfortunately, Zhao Xu Ye couldn't simulate the Flowing Current Slash again, or he would have executed a legendary feat of cutting down seven demons with one sword.

Zhao Xu Ye's wild assault also intimidated the Florem demons, who were unable to use their protective mirror image or telepathic control. Instead, they hastily deployed their ultimate technique, "Higher Transmission," and fled.

It was as if throwing a stone into a forest, causing countless birds to take flight in alarm.

"Don't run!" Zhao Xu Ye exclaimed in frustration.

But alas, he was still unable to cast the "Dimension Lock" spell, which would have allowed him to leave no demon behind.

At this moment, Zhao Xu Ye felt an inexplicable sense of satisfaction, as if each attack had increased his own spiritual energy.

"Uh-uh..."

Just then, the main rift tunnel of the Heavenly Lord's army, flying above the deep abyss, let out a battle cry, and high-ranking angels began to command lower-ranking angels and saints to launch a counterattack.

In an instant, countless demons who had yet to escape or lacked transmission techniques were forced to turn around and face the Heavenly Lord's army."
On the battlefield, a series of teleportation gates began to emerge, including those from the heavenly realm and other layers of the underworld. The deep underworld itself had its own teleportation gates, which were constantly transporting the demonic army back to the underworld like ants moving their homes. Zhao Xu followed a group of heavenly creatures led by an otherworldly god, roaming around and capturing the scattered demons.

As the output of damage was insufficient, even the powerful demons would kneel down when they received enough damage from the group. Many demons were gathered and Zhao Xu could barely keep up with them, and they were all instantly incinerated.

"Ahhh!"

Suddenly, a cry filled with the destructive aura of the underworld echoed through the air. At the same time, several small apostate gods were knocked flying and fell into the ravine, causing many stones to tumble down.

Who was it?

Zhao Xu couldn't help but stop and look around. He saw a dark spiritual light enveloping a giant bat-winged red demon, with flames dancing on its skin. The demon's two claws held a long sword sharp enough to kill souls and a long whip that looked like a fiery tongue.

It was a Balrogoth!

And there were at least two more!

In the underworld or dark world, countless creatures whispered to each other that this was the most powerful and terrifying species. They were like generals, ruling over the demonic army and serving as the most trusted advisors to the demonic lords. They were skilled at plotting and killing innocent people.

Even within the demonic group, they were revered for spreading terror and pain among their own kind. Zhao Xu's eyebrows furrowed as he remembered that Balrogoths were known for using teleportation gates to transport themselves to other locations before launching a battle.
Here is the translation of the text:

It's hard to believe that today is a day when a group of demons is launching a fierce assault, surrounded by angels. It seems that this time, the angels' siege has really pushed these deep-dwelling demons to the brink.

However, before the battle, Barolos, the demon, had already activated its "Evil Spirit Light" ability, a mystical power that can suppress nearby angels and saints. It wasn't until the high-ranking angels unleashed their holy spirit light that they could barely hold their own against Barolos.

Zhao Xu, curious about Barolos' battle style, flew to the side and found a secluded spot to observe.

Barolos is a high-ranking demon that can directly communicate with the demon lord. It is not a joke; it is a real and powerful being that can lead the demon army into battle. As a member of the demon management layer, it is the pinnacle of the demon evolution chain.

Each time Barolos is killed, it will inevitably attract the attention of the demon lord behind it. It's even possible that it will be added to the black list.

Barolos is holding a +1 long sword that looks like a burning flame, switching between a fiery and electrical appearance. However, its first wave of attack is actually an internal explosion spell!

As a daily ability, Barolos can only use this internal explosion spell once, which is a 9-ring pastor's magic. Barolos directly targeted a living being and caused destructive resonance within its body, causing the unfortunate saint to start disintegrating from the inside out, as if drinking a poisonous potion. The saint watched in agony as it died.

In each round, Barolos selects a new target on the battlefield. This level ability is equivalent to providing a one-hit kill effect every round.
Here is the translation of the text:

Another Balroth mage is capable of unleashing the same ability every day, which is the eight-ring "Inferno Storm"! Instantly, a vast space was engulfed by the roaring flames, with an area of effect much larger than fireball magic, causing all living beings within to suffer 20D6 damage, with some even being wiped out. The low-ranking heavenly creatures were immediately cleared out.

In the next round, the Balroth mage that didn't use its hand was targeting the strongest angel in the arena. It directly activated the "Command: Intimidate" ability, which is exceptionally useful when the mage's life force is low, and this is also the reason why it's the mage's first choice for dealing damage.

Even the strongest monsters that are intimidated will lose their ability to act and are certain to die.

Immediately after, the Balroth mage approached the angel and struck it with its long whip, which was binding the opponent like a fishing net. The whip also transmitted at least 35 levels of the Balroth mage's power, instantly completing the binding.

After getting the upper hand, the Balroth mage activated its flying or teleportation ability, dragging the opponent away and transporting it to another battlefield!

This is the most ruthless high-level battle, where even the lowest-level monsters don't even have time to catch their breath before dying, and high-level creatures will be caught off guard too.
