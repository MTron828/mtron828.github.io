Chapter 689: The Method to Solve the Stone Statue

If Zhao Xu had just stabbed this sword, it would have bounced back to him directly, skipping the "Stellar Cloak" reduction effect, and he would have definitely turned around and left immediately, not thinking about breaking the two stone statues with harm.

Because he couldn't determine the source of the damage to his body.

It's possible that the "living furnace" master had used a powerful effect like "Invitation" on him.

He naturally didn't need to be played with by the other party.

However, now, his "Stellar Cloak" has taken effect, indicating that he has suffered "near-combat physical" damage.

This point is extremely critical!

At this moment, Zhao Xu continued to gaze at the two stone statues, and just as he took a breath, the wall lamp above him suddenly emitted three green light beams, which fell directly on the three main targets in the secret room.

As the light faded, the cracks in the stone statue's abdomen, which Zhao Xu had stabbed, began to automatically repair themselves, as if a skilled goldsmith was meticulously maintaining them.

Meanwhile, Zhao Xu glanced at the dynamic bar's hint effect.

This is a direct repair light for biological constructs, so it won't have any effect on him.

This means that others who enter later may have to face two stone statues that can restore to their original state every turn.

Zhao Xu, however, was gazing at the stone wall with a profound expression, as if the "living furnace" behind him was watching him.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

The first method to break through the stone statue's reflection damage is to cause a massive amount of damage to the statue, just sufficient to kill it, but not exceeding one's own life limit. This is something that anyone can easily come up with. However, at this point, Zhao Xu has no idea where the life line of the stone statue is located. This is also the cunning aspect of this "living cave". If the opponent really puts up a "mud monster", they would definitely guess it correctly, and then they can respond accordingly. The "mystery" is the biggest protective measure. Now, Zhao Xu is even wondering if the two stone statues might have a life limit exceeding his own.

As for the second method, it is the consumption method. After outputting controlled damage, one should immediately heal oneself and create a time gap. However, this method is rendered useless after the "repair light" appears, and the gap is naturally blocked. In theory, except for priests, most mages will not have many healing methods. Mages would rather invest their resources in other areas. A mage's value lies in being able to output more than a warrior, set traps better than a thief, and survive longer than a hunter. This is the meaning of a mage's resource investment.

However, healing is a weak point of mages, belonging to a ratio of 2:1. This is also the reason why An Ti Nuo Ya arranged the first healer, "Volume Scholar", for Zhao Xu, to perfectly fill the gap. This is also the significance of the Big Sage's robe and silver fire that can heal. However, the opponent knew that Zhao Xu had mastered dual cultivation, and immediately shut down this method.
Thinking of this, Zhao Xu directly raised his hand and cast a targeted spell at the wall lamp - "Sonic Shatter"! Sonic spells have always had excellent effects on solid objects. At this time, this second-level spell, after being highly effective and twin-cast, caused an instant damage of 120 points (normally 10D6). Even if the object survived the strong resilience check, it would still suffer half the damage, enough to shatter most small objects. Even diamonds were no exception. However, after the sound wave shattered the wall lamp, the fragments reassembled in place and restored to their original state. What's even more exaggerated is that from the original one, it turned into two wall lamps. There really are no obvious "loopholes," Zhao Xu secretly complained. To punish his loophole-seeking behavior, the repair light doubled instantly. Even if the two stone statues had not suffered any damage, the repair light descended again. Increasing the frequency of restoring the stone statues by twice meant that the difficulty of his decryption had increased significantly. Zhao Xu shook his head. This shows that the "Activation Cellar" does not like sly and tricky methods? It wants to force a direct confrontation? But? Zhao Xu was still puzzled. Because the appearance of the "wall lamp" had actually indicated the method to solve this secret room. While deliberately closing the door, it also left a window, indicating to future generations that they could come through. That's why Zhao Xu had just tried to shatter the wall lamp so cleverly. In a subtle way, Zhao Xu seemed to have grasped a thread of this "trial." At this moment, like playing chess, Zhao Xu was making meaningless "checks," but essentially, through these moves, he was buying time to think.
Here is the translation of the text:

After he realized that the method was a refraction of near combat damage, he had already reacted to it. Moreover, it was because of this that he thought the "wall lamp" was too obvious, including destroying the "wall lamp" to test it. His focus was already in the second secret room, and everything now was for preparation for what was to come. He was writing an "exam paper", so he needed to figure out the "thought process" of the problem solver.

Thus, after the repair light on the wall lamp had fallen several times.

Zhao Xu let out a soft sigh and gave up his troubled thoughts. Forget it.

He directly looked at the two large stone statues in front of him, gently raised his hand, and cast a spell, with the incantation and hand gestures coming together.

Magic had developed over thousands of years, and the types of spells had also expanded comprehensively, so there were many scenes that would have specialized "spells". Including the "human-like essence" of the "constructed biological" living in the pit, although it was ineffective.

However, this stone statue could reflect "same-type damage" and also had magical immunity, so Zhao Xu initially chose "near combat damage".

But, unfortunately, there was a spell in this world that could ignore magical resistance and break through magical immunity, and the damage itself would not affect humans - "Dissolve Ray!"

In an instant, a dark ray of interfering magic shot out of Zhao Xu's hand and directly hit one of the stone statues.

The four-ring spell, "Dissolve Ray", targeted the "constructed biological" and could cause 1-6 levels of damage (up to level 15) as long as it hit. Zhao Xu then released a twin beam of extreme damage, causing 180 points of damage on the spot, which was within his tolerance range.
Here is the translation of the text:

In an instant, the statue's shape trembled, and the outer layer of stone seemed to dissolve, as if it had been erased. Suddenly, half of it disappeared, revealing the internal operating core.

Isn't the damage enough?

Just as Zhao Xu was hesitating, the repair light from the wall lamp fell on the "statue", directly repairing the damage caused by Zhao Xu's previous attack.

Zhao Xu couldn't help but furrow his brow.

Is the damage really not enough?

Moreover, the repair light seemed to be able to completely repair all the damage, so if he couldn't kill the statue smoothly within 6 seconds, he would have to face a brand new statue!

What's more, after each round, he could only release one more dispel spell, unable to release another dispel spell.

It seems that the difficulty of this question is not so easy to solve.

Let's take a gamble.

He took a deep breath and released another dispel spell on the spot!

At the same time, Zhao Xu fiercely thrust his long sword out, this time calculating the entire range of damage and unleashing his shield ability with all his might, striking multiple sword attacks!

In addition to the 180-point damage from the dispel spell, he added physical damage!

As long as the reflected damage from the statue was below 300 points, he would not fall into a death state.

However, this meant that he had dealt 780 points of damage to the statue (180 points from the dispel spell + 600 points from physical damage)!

As Zhao Xu's lightning-fast sword attacks struck the statue, it began to shake and tremble, with several giant holes appearing on its body.

At the same time, Zhao Xu's body also had several obvious wounds, with blood starting to seep out.
Here is the translation:

The damage reflection of nearly 300 points was overwhelming, and even though Zhao Xu's physical strength exceeded 20 points, he still felt overwhelmed. His entire body began to sway, and his footsteps became loose and unsteady. The pain transmitted from his body was unbearable, and his soul felt the agony of pain.

However, the statue was even more severe.

It was as if the "castle" on the sand was being swallowed by the surging waves, directly collapsing and losing all vitality.

Finally, Zhao Xu succeeded.

Zhao Xu looked at the remaining two-digit vitality and shook his head in dismay. He had never seen such a desperate situation in his life.

After Zhao Xu applied the treatment to himself, he found that even with the highest-potency twin potions, he could only recover a few tens of points, and it was not effective at all.

It was no wonder that the six-ring "Healing Art" could heal up to 150 HP. The one-ring "Light Wound Healing" and the four-ring "Severe Wound Healing" spell would start to show signs of being unable to keep up with the situation.

Unless a priest with a special talent for healing and advanced level, even with special abilities and skills, could still make a difference.

Just as Zhao Xu was about to cast his second "Severe Wound Healing" spell, the repair light suddenly fell from the ceiling again.

This time, Zhao Xu's eyes widened as he gazed at everything before him.

The statue that he had just shattered, as if it had been reassembled by an invisible hand, was being pieced together piece by piece.

Fine lines appeared between the stone blocks, and the cracks were being sewn together.

Too much!

This was the true difficulty of this secret room, wasn't it?

Zhao Xu almost wanted to slap his thighs in frustration.

This meant that he had to kill two statues at the same time in one round.

Zhao Xu felt a surge of anger in his heart.

His close combat output was unable to lock onto another monster within the extreme time limit.
Here is the translation of the text:

It's not to mention that the ability to destroy only works on the same living being. A clever woman can't cook without rice. More importantly, his 300-point life force is already at its limit. No matter what method he uses, any additional damage would be enough to kill him. Zhao Xu took a deep breath, his body swaying slightly. This means that all his options must return to the starting point - he must use the "dissolving beam" to cause damage to both stone statues without being affected himself. He needs to activate his latent ability to simulate "chain casting". The problem is that the beam after chain casting will only deal half damage, 90 points, to the second target. Zhao Xu thought to himself. Suddenly, his eyes lit up and he took out two scrolls of Eight Rings, "Return to Chaos" and "Abandon Chaos". This allows him to change his approach, no matter when, to play a crucial role. But he had originally intended to take the imaginative route, choosing "magic concealment" to hide the effects of his magic and achieve an unexpected outcome. Who would have thought that the final series of skills would circle back to the "artillery route". Is there still a part of him that deep down desires magical output? He let out a sigh and then cast "Chaos Double Wash" on himself, allowing the power of chaos to invade his body and then stripping him of everything afterwards. Zhao Xu also completed his goal, washing away the 2nd-level reward "Magic Concealment" of the "Super Mage" skill and replacing it with "Chain Casting". The next second. Chain Casting! Magic Twin Birth!
Here is the translation of the text:

"The spell is extremely effective! The spell is delayed (5 turns)! The four-ring annihilation ray! Zhao Xu's mouth is wide open as he reveals all his expertise cards at once. As a level 10 mage, he would normally need to use up all his expertise cards to combine these four super-magical expertise cards, but Zhao Xu has already mastered a much larger number of them!

4+3+3+3=13, and Zhao Xu has increased his ring by 13 levels.

Without super-magical control, he would need a 17-level spell to accommodate so many super-magical expertise cards.

Instantly, two annihilation rays locked onto two stone statues.

One dealt 180 damage, and the other 90 damage. After 5 turns, they began to take effect.

Then, Zhao Xu immediately cast the same method again, repeating the same pattern, but this time choosing a 4-turn delay for the annihilation rays.

The main and secondary damage were swapped.

It was only then that Zhao Xu realized he had used up all his potential points to the limit.

He didn't even have enough room to recover his spell slots.

If he didn't have enough spell slots, this trick wouldn't have worked.

The two ice-cold stone statues stood firm as Zhao Xu chanted and cast five consecutive spell gestures.

But each time, no spell appeared.

Until the 30-second mark arrived.

It was as if the clock of doom had finally struck.

Five "annihilation rays" burst forth simultaneously.

The flowers withered, and the leaves turned yellow.

The stone chamber was instantly filled with the ominous atmosphere of destruction.

180+90+180+90+180=720 damage!

90+180+90+180+90=630 damage!"
Here is the translation of the text:

"Simultaneously, Zhao Xu stood before the stone statue that had suffered 90 points of damage, gently and lightly handing over a sword!
He swore that this was absolutely the last time he would stab himself today.
Suddenly, the five lights converged, and the sword went west.
The two stone statues finally reached the end of the road, collapsing and crumbling into dust!
Ahead, a massive door with a glossy black glow suddenly swung open!"
