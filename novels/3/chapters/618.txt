Chapter 619: The Secret of the Nine Swords, System Unveiled

"Unbelievable, I can return so quickly," said the old man Wú Fēi, with a hint of incredulity, looking at Zhao Xu Dao.

"The final scroll, indeed, it's worthy of its reputation as the strongest divine artifact. I just got close to it, and all my skills were mastered by it."

The old man Wú Fēi lifted his head, continuing to gaze at the distant starry sky.

"The result is that you've just obtained the secret of 'Iron Heart Force' from it. It's all fate. Since it's like that, you should cherish the time and tell me what you want to learn."

At this moment, the old man Wú Fēi seemed more melancholic than his initial demeanor.

"I can't guarantee when I'll wake up again, but I'll be replaced by someone else."

"Why, sir, when you woke up, there were no problems, but when he woke up, this space became extremely chaotic, with hidden dangers everywhere."

In truth, Zhao Xu Dao almost got chopped into five pieces by these slicing forces without anticipation.

He only just realized why the suspended corpses above looked as if they were wrapped in spider silk. If not for this method, they would have been torn apart like dried meat.

"Because this place is targeted at another me, not the current me, naturally, everything was fine when I was alive."

As Wú Fēi said this, he pushed Zhao Xu Dao, who was still thinking, "Come on, kid, get a move on, what's the truth or not? You're saying Wú Fēi taught you, and Aurora will verify it again with you. What's the point of all this hassle?"

As he spoke, he seemed to be on the verge of exploding in anger like a fire about to burst forth.

Zhao Xu hastily bowed and was taken aback to realize that he too had a day when he would be forced to take a step back.

"Come on, tell me about your initial plans," Wàn Bù Fǎi pulled out the ancient artifact "Transmission" and planted it in the ground, leaning against it as a backrest.

Zhao Xu understood that time was of the essence, and that next time Wàn Bù Fǎi woke up, he might not be able to forcefully awaken the "Nine Sword Master" Wàn Ér Gōu.

The more Zhao Xu understood the Nine Swords, the more confidence he would have when facing the future.

Zhao Xu then elaborated on his future career plans on the spot.

Older Wàn Bù Fǎi stroked his disheveled beard and nodded, saying, "It seems that the 'Red Jade Guard' has indeed become a greedy dog. It's no wonder that the divine leg is as hard as a rock."

As he spoke, Wàn Bù Fǎi pointed and said, "In essence, you're studying the Nine Swords to compensate for the lack of 'action' compared to 'heart-soul' practitioners. The divine system of the Scroll of Unity is also unable to compensate for you. So, it seems that you have indeed chosen the right path."

As he spoke, he seemed somewhat conflicted, saying, "But the question is, who can match you now? Even if the true gods send down a divine being, they might not be able to capture you."

"Oh well, even if the sky falls, it won't be my turn to worry about it," Wàn Bù Fǎi entered a teaching mode, with his eyes shining brighter.

"So, your current question is to choose which direction to take."

After the topic returned to the Nine Swords, Wàn Bù Fǎi's entire body seemed to radiate golden light, including the ancient artifact behind him, emitting pulses.

Zhao Xu said, then knelt down. Wēn Bù Fǎi gently stroked his beard and said, "It seems simple. To promote to Red Jade Guard, you must first become 'Heavenly Executioner' (Cross-Warrior), and master the Iron Heart Power to smoothly escape this trap. First, become 'Martial Way Sword' (Warrior's Edge)."

Zhao Xu shook his head and said, "I know this, but I've always only known the tip of the iceberg. I'm hoping to rely on this opportunity to learn from you."

It seemed like a textbook or a collection of notes left by predecessors, summarizing various techniques. However, the Nine Swords system still maintained the traditional one-on-one apprenticeship, adhering to the rule that the master does not transmit the secrets to more than one person.

Unless one can forcefully grasp a "Nine Swords" practitioner, it is impossible to learn easily.

This closed-off nature also led to the various schools of thought within the Nine Swords system, each with its own distinct characteristics, making it difficult to integrate and fuse them.

Without investigative authority, there is no right to speak. Therefore, no matter who Zhao Xu seeks to learn from, he can only see the framework of the other person's "Nine Swords System" and cannot see the whole picture, let alone integrate it.

However, Wēn Bù Fǎi, who claimed to be the "founder of Nine Swords," was the most suitable person to provide a "comprehensive overview" of this teaching.

When Zhao Xu made his request, Wēn Bù Fǎi laughed and said, "Really, you're still taking baby steps, and you're thinking of flying."

As the old man raised his finger in the air, a few tiny, flashing people suddenly appeared, dancing and performing in front of Zhao Xu. The tiny people's movements, however, didn't seem to be random.

Zhao Xu quickly put his own practical intelligence to use, trying to remember the dance moves.

"Let me tell you, there are levels to martial arts as well," he said. "The level of a martial artist determines the highest level of technique you can learn, like the White Falcon Fist at the eighth level. However, you don't need to worry, our Nine Swords style is not as rigid as the mages."

"Theoretically, the foundation and advancement of the Nine Swords style are both level 1, while non-Nine Swords styles are level 2. So, as a 10th-level mage, your martial arts level is level 5, allowing you to learn techniques and skills of the third level."

Zhao Xu was taken aback, "Then after I become legendary, I can directly advance to the foundation profession of the Nine Swords style and learn nine-level techniques."

"There's no problem with that, but the issue is that most of them require mastery of three to four techniques within the same system, so you're still stuck."

"What about the three major foundation professions, the Cross Swordsmen, the Battle Blade, and the Swordsmanship Master?" Zhao Xu asked.

"What are the strengths and weaknesses of the Nine Swords style's advanced professions, such as the Jade Phoenix, the Eternal Blade, the Shadow Assassin, the Blood Claw Master, the Nine Swords Master, the Red Jade Guard, the Violent Blade, and the Deep Stone Sentinel?"

"Just listen to me, and I'll tell you one by one," the old man said with a smile.

Just as he was about to continue, he pulled out a cigarette from nowhere and took a deep drag, looking utterly disheveled and unlike his dignified self just moments before.

"However, before that, I have to ask you one thing," the old man said.

"What kind of weapon do you want to use?"
