Chapter 579: Perfect Template

"Mr. Wizard, this is all the information about the opponent."

In a hidden forest, a team of four people slightly bent their knees and stood at attention, with their hands clasped behind their backs. Zhao Xu was explaining the feedback information with great respect.

As the influence of Yana spread, the original Earthcrossers, although they had no combat power, seamlessly integrated into the Yana force with their knowledge and background.

Especially to allocate food, the Yana force quickly dispatched personnel to the surrounding areas.

On one hand, they absorbed outstanding talents on the spot; on the other hand, they organized personnel to defend and distribute food, which became the initial form of the power organization.

At this time, Zhao Xu arrived at the "Southern Cross Secret Star", a hidden intelligence organization within the darkness, which corresponded to the stellar map that would appear in the autumn sky.

The four-person team responsible for reporting did not know the true identity of the man in front of them, except for the information about his arrival time and location, as well as the agreed-upon secret code.

This was the most mysterious case they had received since they started taking on tasks.

However, the few people who had worked in the intelligence agency did not dare to say too much, as they knew that in this chaotic world, human life was the most worthless thing. As long as the higher-ups did not speak up, they silently listened.

Zhao Xu was also aware of this point, and he could even use his mind-reading skills to see the thoughts in the brains of the four people.

Some had genuinely joined Yana, hoping to get rich quickly, while others were waiting for the right moment to repay their debts.

However, Zhao Xu didn't care, and a newly established organization will inevitably absorb a large amount of "sand" when it rapidly expands. He has the time to slowly sift through them.

The truly secret information cannot be revealed to just a few people, and even only a select few law enforcement officers can safely receive it. Any careless remark can make everything clear.

"Got it, you can leave now," Zhao Xu said, then unfolded the paper in his hand and began to read. This record was about the key targets that he had entrusted Wang Qingwei to pay attention to in the past.

As expected, the opponent quickly emerged from the shadows just like in their past life. Unfortunately, to Zhao Xu and others, he was a thorn in their side, similar to the role he played in his past life.

According to his past impressions, Wang Qingwei did not have the same level of influence at that time, so the Earth's forces were spread out like a scattered fire, forming a powerful momentum.

It was known that Wang Qingwei's forces would eventually rise up, slowly spreading and consuming all the surrounding forces.

Although Wang Qingwei had received the support of Anzhi's treasure trove after getting the blessing from the heavens, he would crush all the Earth's forces like a father beating his son.

However, the problem was that there were too many sons, and it was hard to take a firm stance, so Wang Qingwei used an entire year to consolidate his power.

Among the targets Zhao Xu wanted to visit this time was Du Ya, who was one of the last few leaders of the forces to be incorporated.

Fate often likes to play tricks, and Du Ya, who was not a player, was the strongest among the current players. He was a successful businessman on Earth before he crossed over and suddenly had an unbeatable streak of luck. He was one of the few chosen beings with a "perfect template".
Here is the translation of the text:

A template that is as powerful as a legend. Even in the legendary library's "Bestiary of Legendary Creatures," there is hardly any information about this "template." Zhao Xu, who has mastered over 40 levels of knowledge and skills, can only find a few scattered words about it after searching. The "template" has no apparent physical changes or supernatural abilities. It is not like a template that can change one's appearance or gain supernatural powers, such as the "Specter" template, which can transform into a spiritual body and possess multiple supernatural abilities. Instead, the "template" is a mysterious and unknown entity. This is also the reason why many people have suspected that "DuPont" is a master who is extremely skilled and has hidden his true identity. Some even speculate that he may be a player who has been possessed by a powerful warrior. Even though it has only been a week since the earth was traversed, even the strongest players cannot integrate their own forces and pursue independence. Most players who can declare their independence and exist independently are those who rely on their original guild organization. However, DuPont, who is single-handedly, has managed to make all the troops in his camp surrender to him. This is not only due to his impressive martial arts skills but also because of his personal charm.
Here is the translation:

Zhaoyu, who was once strange, but after returning to the floating city of Mistral and flipping through the book "Monster Compendium" in Anniya's office, everything became clear.

After obtaining these abilities, Du Ya, who was rumored to be nearly half-human and half-saint, had already reached level 18 in the challenge system, posing as an ordinary civilian. After advancing to a professional level, he became even more terrifying.

This is the true power of the perfect template.

Honestly, when Du Ya actually exhibited the characteristics of his current physique, people would treat him like a semi-divine being just by standing there.

Looking at the entire Arthurian world, Du Ya's "Double Elite" feature can compete with one of the two elite forces.

However, Zhao Xu's "External Hang" is still a late-game external hang, and it becomes more advantageous only after reaching level 20.

Regardless, Zhao Xu is envious of the perfect template and feels fortunate to have been blessed by heaven. There are not only a few individuals who have been favored by heaven.

Therefore, Zhao Xu rushed to support several camps after crossing over and spent almost a week in the morning, infiltrating the "Luminous Camp" where Du Ya was located.

The name "Luminous" comes from a former player guild called the "Luminous Temple", and now they are also under Du Ya's control, completely submissive to him.

Although Zhao Xu had psychological preparation, he was still surprised when he first entered the entire camp, finding that the Luminous Camp had become well-organized after receiving food supplies from the Temple of the Faithful.

Although there are factors such as the high average quality of Earth-crossing individuals, like the high-quality residential areas where some internet workers live, which directly led to a surge in high school entrance exam scores and a high average quality. However, Du Ya was able to complete the integration in just one week, which is quite impressive.

As expected, the extra 15 points of intelligence and 15 points of charm are not for nothing.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

If the opponent is a woman with no magical powers, relying solely on her natural charm of around 30 points, she would be comparable to a ravishing beauty in the apocalyptic era who could bewitch the king and make him utterly captivated. However, Zhao Xu stopped in his tracks, gazing at a magnificent clay sculpture of Du Ya's likeness, lingering in front of it.

The sculpture was indeed a faithful depiction of Du Ya, which was more vivid than what Zhao Xu had seen in his intelligence reports. Even ordinary people would find the angular and sharp features of the sculpture captivating.

If Zhao Xu possessed the same level of charm, he would not be constantly bullied and insulted. Nearby, a few people stood still, praying and reciting prayers of gratitude to Du Ya, acknowledging his provision of food and leadership that guided them through the chaotic environment.

Afterward, the small children in the corner sang hymns of gratitude to the gods, and then they received small loaves of bread from the adults. These loaves may not have been exceptional, but in the era of scarce resources, they were considered a delicacy, far superior to the bland porridge.

The barren wasteland was like a prison that confined all the interdimensional travelers. Food rations were like the regular meals served in prison.

At this time, except for a few individuals, ordinary civilians were unable to obtain nutritious food, and those who advocated for a healthy lifestyle suddenly regressed to their previous habits. Without the opportunity to indulge in savory dishes, the "pig fat" that was once worthless but now became a valuable commodity on the black market, even more expensive than pork ribs.
Here is the translation:

At this moment, a man dressed in all black approached Zhao Xu's side, sighed, and said, "The flag of freedom, which humans took over a century to raise, has collapsed just a week after its establishment, and has bowed to the forces of food and power, returning to the imperial system of feudal monarchies."

"It's really too pitiful," he said.

As he spoke, the mysterious man looked up at Zhao Xu, noticed his silence, and began to joke, "Mr. Wizard, you can't be thinking of reporting me to the city authorities for opposing Du Ya's leadership, can you? I've heard that wizards are the most free and independent, even the goddess of magic considers them guides."

Zhao Xu didn't explain, but instead spoke a series of unrelated words, like a poem.

"In all biological groups, there are extremely weak existences, such as the dragon clan, which produces weak and disabled dragon eggs, just like the ordinary biological groups."

"But in contrast, there are also individuals in the group that are similar to perfection: they have the strongest bodies, the fastest speed, the most brilliant intelligence, and the most charisma, and are also the luckiest and strongest individuals."

"Perhaps perfect beings are mythical creatures created by immortal gods, or perhaps they are the result of a species' gradual evolution over millions of years. Sometimes, perfect beings are accidental, the result of genetic factors coinciding."

As Zhao Xu finished speaking, he turned his head to face the mysterious man and extended his hand, saying, "It's great to meet you, Mr. Du Ya."

"I am Zhong Xia, a ordinary wizard."
