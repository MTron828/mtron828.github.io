Chapter 484: The Unexplainable Secret

Due to the existence of magic, the defense system of a building must inevitably take it into consideration many times. The headquarters of the Northern Alliance, also known as the Inner City, occupies a vast area within the city of Olu. The Inner City has another name - the Inner City. The main gate of the Inner City occupies nearly an entire street, and the outer walls are dug with a moat about 5-6 meters wide. Not to mention the various watchtowers scattered throughout the city, the arrow towers along the walls are set up in hundreds of steps. If the Inner City is breached one day, it can still hold out for a while.

The Inner City is divided into the front courtyard and the back courtyard. The front courtyard is naturally the residence of various official departments of the alliance, while the back courtyard is the office and residence of the commander Tangde.

When designing the headquarters building, the "Transference" magic, a five-ring spell, was taken into consideration from the beginning. Not to mention the "Flying" magic from the sky, "Stone Movement" magic from underground, and various "Detection" magic, "Eagle Eye" magic, and "Sharp Ear" magic, which are all countermeasures against espionage.

However, the defense against magic must face the contradictions between the duration, range, and maintenance difficulty of the spell. It is like the wooden floor of a house, where sometimes due to cost considerations, only the bedrooms and main bedroom are installed.

The Northern Alliance has operated for many years, and it is not that they cannot achieve their goals, but rather due to purely economic considerations, each department of the headquarters has its own emphasis. The most critical first-level defense area, such as the office area of key departments and the commander's residence, is naturally set up with measures to prevent transmission and detection.
Here is the translation of the text:

As for some outdoor courtyards and ordinary corridors, they are simply equipped with detection transmission means.

Once someone is transported in and triggers the "magical monitoring network", the permanent wizards stationed at the headquarters will then coordinate with the guards to surround and capture them.

Zhou Xiu had participated in the defense system of the headquarters through Flare's recommendation in his past life.

At that time, Wang Qingwei brought the Earthquake Team to attend a meeting, and Zhou Xiu was serving as a security personnel, watching from beneath the stage as the crowd gasped in amazement.

Naturally, Zhou Xiu was also aware of the weaknesses and flaws of this enormous "magical monitoring network".

The first point is the network's periodic reboot "intermittent period", which he doesn't need to worry about now.

The second point is the system's inherent flaws. The "magical monitoring network" itself has a huge range of influence, involving mutual interference and impact issues.

Therefore, there are a few unknown key blind spots.

Even the Northern Alliance's Wizard's Association branch, with all its might, would be unable to test every nook and cranny individually, leaving the seemingly watertight headquarters with a "weak point".

Zhou Xiu remembers that when he first arrived at the headquarters in his past life, a critical "vulnerability" suddenly emerged.

So, they stationed personnel to monitor that area around the clock until the wizards fixed the issue.

Now, at this moment before it has been exposed, Zhou Xiu is perfectly positioned to take advantage of it.

He easily transports himself to the underground room of the watchtower he had guarded for three whole days in his past life.

However.

Just as Zhou Xiu completed the transmission, he suddenly heard a voice filled with shock and surprise, his entire body tensing up like a cat with its fur standing on end.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

Although the sound seemed familiar, Zhao Xu's field of vision had not recovered due to the transmission, and everything in front of him was black.

Zhao Xu raised the momentary release staff in his hand, turned his body, and aimed the tip of the staff at the direction of the sound.

However, the action he took, as if he was about to cast a spell at the opponent, was actually a different spell coming out of his mouth.

"Swift Burst."

In this extremely critical moment, Zhao Xu thought for a moment before deciding to cast this spell.

He wanted to get the "first move" and avoid being attacked in the next few seconds.

In his past life, he had experienced being paralyzed by being called out by name, and his sword had already been stabbed near his waist.

Zhao Xu's thoughts were already clear, and after a brief pause, he waited for the opponent to appear in front of him.

If it was someone he knew, there would be no problems.

If it wasn't, it meant he had exposed himself this time. He could then cast the spell "Frosty Touch" to subdue the opponent, or if there were many people, he could cast the transmission spell to escape again.

However...

Zhao Xu's intuition suddenly burst into his mind: how could this be possible?

He had cast this spell instinctively!

Normally, a mage would only cast a spell in response to an opponent's spell, unless they gave up all other actions and focused on preparing a counter spell.

Otherwise, by the time they cast the spell, it would be too late.

But how did the opponent know he had transmitted, and how did they prepare a counter spell in advance?
Here is the translation of the text:

Slowly, Zhao Xiu's eyelids also gradually opened in the extremely dark underground room, where he relied on the faint light of the oil lamp to barely make out the appearance of the person in front of him.

"Hmm."

Zhao Xiu's heart felt a sense of relief as the weight on his chest was finally lifted.

"Teacher An Ti Nuo Ya."

Zhao Xiu couldn't help but ask, "Shouldn't we be familiar enough not to be startled by my presence?"

At this moment, the person standing in front of Zhao Xiu was none other than An Ti Nuo Ya, dressed in a woven silk robe with a dark gold cloak draped over her shoulders. It was clear that her skills had improved significantly recently, with intricate patterns adorning the fabric.

An Ti Nuo Ya gazed softly at Zhao Xiu.

"I was thinking that since we've reunited, I should show some surprise," An Ti Nuo Ya said.

But Zhao Xiu thought to himself, but his mouth still spoke the truth, "I'm really touched by your words, teacher."

"Ah, but you did well this time. Even when you heard a familiar voice, you didn't hesitate to take action. You're showing some quick thinking, and I won't have to go collect your corpse in the chaotic city of Oulu."

"That's not the case, since you countered my spell with your own," Zhao Xiu said, feeling a bit awkward.

"That's not what I am," An Ti Nuo Ya whispered with a hint of scorn.

"What was the spell you used just now, teacher?" Zhao Xiu couldn't help but ask.

The "Inspection War" spell, which could last for 10 minutes per level, was one of the three-ring spells that Zhao Xiu currently possessed, combined with the "Spell Delay" specialization. With his current spellcasting level, it was effortless to break through 7-8 hours. As long as he had the time and resources, he could easily use the spell as a constant companion.
The text describes a conversation between Zhao Xu and An Ti Nuo Ya, two powerful wizards. Zhao Xu has mastered a technique called "Inspection Warfare" that allows him to automatically detect and recognize spells within a certain range, and even choose to dispel the remaining duration to counter the opponent's spell without needing to prepare.

However, this technique is not foolproof, and the conversation reveals that the two wizards engage in a series of rapid-fire exchanges, with each side countering the other's spells. Zhao Xu's technique allows him to recognize and counter the opponent's spell, but the opponent can also recognize and counter his own spell.

An Ti Nuo Ya explains that Zhao Xu's technique is not complex enough to require backup measures, but she is willing to offer guidance on his development as a wizard. She suggests that Zhao Xu's current level of skill is still quite elementary, and that he has a long way to go before reaching the level of a true master.

The conversation also reveals that each wizard can only counter one spell per round, making the exchange of spells a high-stakes game of strategy and quick reflexes.
Here is the translation of the text:

"So, if there's another wizard nearby who gives up casting spells and focuses on preparing an 'anti-magic' move, that's also a very awkward situation.

"'Summer solstice, you can only counter one spell per turn because you can only 'prepare' once to counter the opponent's next spell,'"

"'Once the opponent doesn't cast a spell, your countermeasure will also be ineffective, although the spell won't be wasted, but your body's synchronization and coordination will make it impossible for you to cast another spell.'"

Zhao Xu nodded slightly after listening, and he understood that this anti-magic move was not commonly seen in their low-end region.

"'And besides, you also need to prepare the same spell to counter it, unless it's a very common mainstream spell that everyone prepares, in which case it's generally difficult to achieve an effective countermeasure,'"

Zhao Xu said.

However, he was also aware that anti-magic was useless in any case, but it was another method for resolving the "law of magic" spell.

It was equivalent to the wizard's "omnipotent anti-magic" spell.

"'Ah, is there any special bonus for advancing anti-magic?'"

At this time, Zhao Xu also couldn't help but think about it.

Later, if someone tried to cast a spell in front of him, he would immediately use anti-magic without hesitation.

No one could cast a spell without his permission.

This was the true meaning of "pretending to be powerful without showing it."

Especially, Zhao Xu had unlimited magic slots and could counter spells without preparing with his "multiple spellcasting" and "precognition" abilities.

"'Heh heh,'" Anzhi Noya smiled smugly.

"'Specialization?'"

Zhao Xu was surprised.

He now had at least four or five specialization slots, which was a lot more than ordinary people.

"'Strictly speaking, it's a chain of specializations,'" Anzhi Noya explained.
Here is the translation of the text:

"For example, 'Master of Countermeasures' specializes in using higher-tier spells to counterattack without being limited to the same spells. Again, 'Passive Countermeasures' specializes in being able to counterattack without preparing in advance, as long as you notice the opponent's spellcasting. And then there's the legendary specialization 'Legendary Countermeasures', which allows unlimited counterattacks per round.

As for the three I mentioned earlier, they are all progressive relationships, and you must master the previous specialization before moving on to the next one. Even the legendary specialization requires you to fulfill the prerequisites of 'Master of First Strike', 'Combat Reflexes', and 'Instant Spell Release'.

Anzuel listened to this and was taken aback. This legendary countermeasures specialization directly requires five ordinary specializations as prerequisites, although Anzuel already possessed 'Combat Reflexes' and 'Instant Spell Release'.

Under the premise of maintaining absolute suppression over low-tier mages, the implementation cost of this specialization is enormous.

It's worth noting that relying on level specializations, from level 1 to level 20, only requires seven specializations in total.

However, Anzuel was secretly preparing mentally.

He also thought to himself that he had determined his own specialization path.

As he thought, he suddenly snapped back to reality, returning to the initial question, 'Teacher, how did you end up here?'

He didn't have the 'Mind Shield' spell, so he couldn't avoid detection by those surveillance spells. He could only rely on 'Black Points' to sneak in.

But for Anzuel, even facing the gods' realm, he still had the courage to barge in, unlike Anzuel, who was searching for a way in."

Zhao Xu's reaction was immediate: "So, you're saying that the magical monitoring network in this area has some anomalies, with traces of Grazt's influence?"

"Not wrong," he replied. "Otherwise, how could I dare to conclude that Tang De and Grazt have a relationship? Although it's not obvious, I have a hunch that these defensive detection spells have been infused with some of Grazt's deep-seated divine power. That's why I was able to uncover the underlying reason."

"The magical energy on the monitoring network is incredibly weak and can't provide any defense, so the priests of Oracle City didn't notice this point," he continued. "But this is enough to remind us that Grazt has some kind of power that has entered this place."

"If a mage with a 'mind shield' casts a spell and uses the immunity effect to teleport to a non-critical point, although the monitoring network won't detect it, Grazt in the background can still sense the network's movement."

Zhao Xu nodded as he listened, and Anniya didn't want Grazt to discover her actions, so she also secretly infiltrated the black point and then took action.

It seemed that he had stumbled upon the monitoring network's black point by mistake.

"In reality, I'm also quite curious," Anniya said. "What kind of secret could make Grazt want to monitor this area, even to the extent that I suspect it has turned the 'Tang De' alliance leader into its disciple, all for this reason."

"Generally speaking, these deep-seated lords who develop disciples aim for secrecy. Such powerful individuals are difficult to subdue, not to mention breaking through their spiritual weaknesses. Even if they succeed, they're likely to expose themselves easily."

"Or, to avoid exposure, Grazt would need to spend more resources, which is not cost-effective."

Zhao Xu nodded in agreement, also thinking about the underlying reasons.
Here is the translation of the text:

"In my mind, I gradually guided the thought to the "Seal of the Magic War" that took place in the entire ice mountain range north of the influence of all powers.

The war was triggered by the "Transmission Gate" between the abyss and the hell, which was the initial cause.

The strong ones in hell did not have the ability to transmit interdimensionally, so they had to rely on the "Wish" technique to simulate interdimensional transmission once a year.

Afterwards, they had to wait for the "Wish" technique to cool down before they could return.

For lower-level demons and devils, coming to the beautiful and prosperous "Arthas" was a longed-for but impossible thing.

"'I'll make you explode at that point, as a reward for being the 'Howard' and 'Asmon' of the cross,' but I still need to lay the groundwork here first,' I said.

'I don't want my soul to be swallowed by the abyss, and then I'll come knocking on the door to ask for my soul back. That would be really embarrassing,' I said.

Zhao Xuguang's mouth was slightly open, and he didn't expect An Tianya to disappear suddenly, but she had actually set up a rear hand for him.

An Tianya raised an eyebrow slightly, 'It's my turn to ask you, Zhongxia.'

'I directly found the "Defense Chart" of the headquarters, and then I calculated it and found a few weaknesses, and found this infiltration point,' I said.

"What about you?' An Tianya looked at Zhao Xuguang with great interest.

"How did you know that you wouldn't be discovered when you transmitted to the underground room of this tower?'"
