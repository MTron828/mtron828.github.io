Chapter 114: Solo Ride

As Zhao Xu's figure disappeared around the corner of the small shop, Cui Lu finally snapped out of her daze and muttered to herself, "How did he know I just registered a new account and chose the Hunter class?"

Many students in Cui Lu's class were deeply engaged in the game, but after experiencing it for almost a month, some had already used up their revive stones and had to restart from scratch. Cui Lu still had two revive stones left, but she had come to realize that the wandering poet was not her true path.

That's why she decided to delete her account and start fresh, even if it meant starting from scratch. However, she was still puzzled by Zhao Xu's suggestion.

Currently, although there were few Hunter players who had reached level 2, the debate over the choice of combat style for the Hunter class 2-level ability "Combat Style" had already begun. The question was whether "Archery" or "Dual-Weapon Fighting" was the true master. This topic was hotly debated among Hunter players.

However, the true strength of each style could only be experienced by the players themselves.

When Zhao Xu logged back into the game the next day, the Golden Dragon Camp had disappeared without a trace. His makeshift shelter created using magic to avoid the rain had also vanished.

However, Zhao Xu had learned the true name of the ancient Golden Dragon, which had brought them closer together in some way.

At that moment, the entire Southern Forest was still cloudy, but the heavy rain from the previous day had stopped, leaving only occasional short and intense rain showers. Looking up, the dark clouds still blocked out the sun, hinting that a bigger storm could strike at any moment.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu didn't bother too much, unless it was a fierce storm or blizzard, and even then, he wouldn't get wet. He was 14 years old, and his physical condition was already comparable to that of ordinary athletes who had received some training.

However, Zhao Xu still found a tree stump to sit down and began to meditate to prepare for his magic.

Later, after mastering the 2nd-level magic spell "Magical Rope" and reaching the 3rd level, he finally acquired the basic ability to hide and avoid attacks from wild animals.

Zhao Xu thought he wouldn't reach the 3rd level for at least two or three months, but after just over 10 days of adventuring, he easily reached the 2nd level standard, which made him raise the goal of becoming a 2nd-level mage.

Recalling his past life, he had cut down countless swords to successfully understand the 2nd-level attack power, and the current 2nd-level mage was like a dream.

After preparing his magic, Zhao Xu stood up and clapped his buttocks, only to find that the entire southern forest of Nan'er Island looked like it had been copied and pasted, almost making him doubt whether he was being illusioned.

Yesterday, he relied on his inner breath to feel carefree, with a vast sky and a sense of belonging to the world.

After waking up and clearing his mind, he still needed to find the main road of the merchant team.

Zhao Xu couldn't help but complain that the Golden Dragon Kampa had said he would provide excellent service, but when he asked him to use a teleportation spell, the originally dignified Golden Dragon suddenly became miserly and demanded 450 gold coins, including 50 gold coins for the 5th-level magic base and 9 levels of caster level.
During that time, Kampas, who was acting like a friendly salesman, was offering a discount on his services, indicating that he wasn't calculating the price according to his actual level of over 19. This was equivalent to a 50% discount, which was already sufficient for Zhao Xu to consider.

However, before his brain was burned out, Zhao Xu still refused this proposal outright.

As of now, 450GP is a huge fortune in the player community.

If Zhao Xu couldn't sit at the mage association's teleportation portal, he would naturally pay the cost.

Currently, Zhao Xu only needs to spend a day and a half to get to the capital city, and the 450 gold coin carriage fee is too luxurious.

So Zhao Xu could only sigh and take out a map of the northern, central, and southern islands in the forest from his backpack.

After careful examination, he roughly estimated a direction.

Arthur is not like the Earth with magnetic poles, so he couldn't pull out a compass to determine direction. He could only rely on the sun's position in the sky, the density of the forest, and some obvious signs to assist in analysis.

Thanks to Anni's gift of this map, Zhao Xu saved a lot of effort.

For outdoor training, the "survival" skill is a very practical skill. However, Zhao Xu didn't invest a single point in it.

If the survival skill had reached level 5, it would automatically allow people to determine clear directions.

Zhao Xu's current investment is more focused on later-stage combat, with many early-stage skills that are not useful in the long run or can be replaced by spells. Zhao Xu prefers to save skill points and invest in knowledge skills, focus skills, and spell recognition skills.

However, Zhao Xu still couldn't save up the spell slot.

Given the current shortage of spell slots in the mage community, it's not just that these spells can't be cast, even learning them requires a significant investment.
Here is the translation:

After being influenced by the mystical aura of the floating city for a month, Zhao Xu had already accepted the idea that if his magic couldn't bring him joy, he was a useless mage. In the "mobility magic" category, the duration of the "floating disc" spell was one hour per caster level, while the "summon mount" spell was two hours per caster level. Considering that he still had a long way to go, Zhao Xu decided to cast the "summon mount" spell.

As he rode along, he occasionally checked his map and spent about three hours before reaching the main road near the South Forest. Compared to the muddy road in the South Forest, the well-maintained road, maintained by the Heaven's North Trade Union, was slightly affected by yesterday's rain, but the water accumulation was not too significant, and it only slightly affected the speed of the lightweight horse he had summoned.

As a magical skill, "riding" could assist characters in mounted combat, but Zhao Xu simply used it for transportation, which was not a problem. Zhao Xu patted his summoned lightweight horse and it suddenly accelerated a few steps. "It's so convenient to summon," Zhao Xu couldn't help but exclaim.

When he was crossing the gorge earlier, he was on high alert, and he didn't feel too much. Now, riding alone in the rain, he breathed in the fragrance of the forest, surrounded by the lush green landscape, and his heart was filled with the pleasant memories of his outdoor adventures in the wilderness seven or eight years ago. Therefore, he was able to feel the lightness of the horse beneath him.

As a warrior in his past life, Zhao Xu had spent a lot of money to buy a warhorse, which was like a luxury car on Earth, a symbol of masculinity. Zhao Xu had spent a lot of money on various horse saddles and horse armor for that warhorse.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Just one spell can summon a horse, although it cannot be used in battle, but it has saved him a lot of time for taking care of it. Suddenly, while Zhao Xu was estimating the distance from himself to North Carolina by looking at the map, he noticed that the horse beneath him had stopped abruptly and refused to move forward. He raised his head and saw, about 50 meters away, a barrier stretching across the entire road, as well as several armored knights drawing their bows at him. More lightly armored infantrymen were holding long spears, fixed intently on him, a common traveler. He had encountered a checkpoint."
