Chapter 18: Higher Transmission

Zhao Xu realized that this player was in a lot of trouble after seeing this post. In the player's eyes, it was just a simple matter of killing an NPC, no big deal. However, the NPCs in Arthuria were actually living people, unknown to the player. Many people from Earth had crossed over to Arthuria and married locals directly. These NPCs were all flesh and blood, each with their own family background and not just a simple NPC. The player thought he had killed only a revivable data and could only pray that he was the starting point, hoping the NPC would revive, thinking it was just a simple mistake.

As a result, the other party gave up their current account and could retrieve their team, but if they didn't, no matter how many times they changed accounts, the evil team label would still emerge. Even when they crossed over, the evil aura on their body would be as elusive as a ghost.

Zhao Xu knew that the best thing for the player to do was to apologize and compensate, and then be detained for a period of time. In fact, they could simply log off without being detained. However, if they didn't, the superficial conflict would only be temporarily suppressed, and the player who thought it was just a simple matter of killing an NPC would eventually suffer the consequences.

"Detection" abilities, as long as they are level one, are no different from zero-level magic. More importantly, the "Detection of Evil" ability is a professional skill of the Saint Warrior, which sometimes becomes a habitual gesture for Saint Warriors when they encounter groups of players.

Low-level evil players in Arthuria were completely helpless.
The text describes a game player named Zhao Xu who creates a guide for new players, titled "The Ten Commandments for New Players" on the first night of the game. The guide emphasizes the importance of avoiding evil and not repeating the same mistakes that other players have made. However, the post receives many negative comments from other players who criticize Zhao Xu's unconventional advice and suggest that he should gain more experience before offering guidance. Despite this, Zhao Xu decides to continue playing the game, determined to prove himself. The text also mentions that many players are using up all their revival stones to restart their accounts, a behavior that Zhao Xu hopes to change.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

His body will turn into a flash of light and disappear in the world of Arthur after 10 rounds (1 minute). If you're in a hurry, you can also log out without waiting for the 10 rounds. If you encounter an attack during these 10 rounds, you can only use the revive stone. Initially, most players don't pay attention to the system's warnings. It's only when they reach a higher level that they start to appreciate the value of their account. Even in a safe town area, they will wait patiently for their body to disappear.

However, sometimes unexpected situations arise, such as being woken up by someone in the real world or receiving a phone call. In such cases, forced logout is also possible, but the drawback is that the body will not disappear and will remain in a lost consciousness state in the world of Arthur.

Regardless of the method, relogging into the game requires a 20-minute cooling-off period. This has been criticized by numerous players, who felt that it was inconvenient for the game's communication system. However, Arthur has maintained this policy until the day of the great migration, when Zhao Xiu allocated 20 minutes for himself to eat and rest.

However, frequent login and logout, receiving messages in the game, and then logging off to send messages to others through the network, has become a common practice. Even Arthur's native players occasionally recruit players to use this method for emergency communication. However, excessive use of this method has led to the organization being penalized.

As a result, players have started to directly log in with their passwords. After passing through a white light, Zhao Xiu suddenly appeared in his bedroom in the floating castle above Mistral.
Here is the translation of the text:

There, where it disappears, it appears again, regardless of the situation, it is always the case. A player had previously logged out beside the volcano's mouth, and later, after logging back in, he found that the volcano had erupted, and his body had been crushed by the cooled lava.

After that, Anezia's body suddenly appeared in a flash of light, still wearing the same robe as before.

After three days of fighting, Zhao Xu had learned that the entire Floating City was quite large.

Anezia had set up a magical alarm in his room, which would alert her if he appeared. It wouldn't be wrong, even though the Floating City was large, and Anezia was not far from his dormitory, she still wanted to use a 7th-level high-level teleportation spell to come over.

As for not using the 5th-level "Interdimensional Door" spell, it was because this spell had a mistake. Zhao Xu also tried asking why they didn't use the "Interdimensional Door" spell directly.

The response was that Mistral and the Floating City had used a legendary spell to shield against teleportation methods, and only those with a mark like Anezia could be exempt. However, even with exemption, the "Interdimensional Door" spell was still sensitive and would be monitored.

Anezia didn't want to be asked why she was going from one place to another every day, so she gave up.

At that time, Zhao Xu still naively asked why the high-level teleportation spell wouldn't be detected.

The response was that those on the monitoring list were all subject to investigation, and high-level teleportation spells were unable to cross-dimensional teleportation, and the prerequisite condition was that the user was familiar with the place, and the spell was also the same origin. With too many users, it was not listed for review. In other words, it was better not to permit teleportation at all.

Zhao Xu finally realized why his mage friend had mastered a 3rd-level spell at the 5th level and never walked on two feet again.
The laziness of emotional therapists is hereditary.
