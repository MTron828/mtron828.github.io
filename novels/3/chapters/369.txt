Chapter 370: The Lucky One
"What's this?" The burly man was about to speak up in rebuttal, but he stopped when he saw the person behind him. He was speechless.

The other few people were also crouching down, as if they were afraid to look at the other person.

In the thousands of years of Arther's history, the concept of "respecting the strong" had deeply ingrained itself in people's minds. Those who didn't understand this concept usually didn't live to see adulthood, let alone go on adventures.

The burly man couldn't tell that Anzhiya's outfit was expensive, just like the man standing in front of him, who was pretending to be his brother. Both of them wore the same cloak.

However, Anzhiya had a completely different "Mage's Badge" on her body.

When Mage apprentices advanced to become official Mages, they would receive a Mage's Badge with a "Unity Circle" symbol. This badge was a proof of one's Mage identity, including their credits and accumulated contributions within the association, which were all recorded on the badge. If it was lost, they would have to apply to the headquarters for remote backup restoration, which was quite a hassle.

However, the greatest significance of the badge was that it could allow non-magicians to recognize the level of the Mage in front of them at a glance, and understand whether they should show respect or kneel down in awe.

As Mages advanced to a new level, the badge would automatically sense and release a new ring.

Until they reached the legendary level, all the rings would automatically merge.

At present, the burly man was facing Anzhiya, who was wearing the legendary Mage's Badge.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

The old man had rubbed shoulders with countless ancestors' relics, and had dreamed of wearing the same badge one day. Therefore, he immediately judged that this was an absolutely genuine mage badge, and his heart was both trembling with fear and exhilarated with excitement.

He hesitated, wondering how to approach the other party.

"Let's go," Anzhiya suddenly emerged from the shadows, approaching Zhao Xu's side, and even glanced at Zhao Xu's height, as if he was used to it.

"Special Envoy," Zhao Xu suddenly exclaimed.

The old man realized that he couldn't bribe this legendary mage.

However, the other party seemed to be concerned about the man who had disguised himself as his brother.

Before intervening in Frosty Town, he had reviewed the list of outstanding young adventurers in Frosty Town, and this man was not on it.

It seemed that the other party was also a foreigner who had come for the auction, so he instantly thought of the most valuable item at the auction, the "+6 Intelligence Headband".

Although the market price could sell for more than 50,000 gold coins, it was nothing in front of a legendary mage's friendship or appreciation.

The old man immediately took out a simple magic item from his pocket, looking very plain, with a gemstone in the middle of a thread.

The mage who invented this magic item had no intention of even designing it, and there was no craftsmanship at all.

"I just met this gentleman and was about to give him this '+6 Intelligence Headband' as a gift, please accept it," the old man exclaimed loudly, his heart beating with excitement.

He knew that this was probably the most profitable deal he had made in recent years.

Even if he lost contact with the two of them, he would not receive any pressure from his family.
Here is the translation of the text:

The legendary mage owed a debt of gratitude to someone by accident, which was impossible to estimate. Moreover, the mature man who deeply understood human nature gave a "Headgear of +6 Intelligence" to a legendary mage, even as a gift for a grand celebration, which was truly extravagant, even beyond the reach of some royal families. However, he suddenly gave it to the other party, who would only reject it, as he was not qualified to give gifts.

Only by catering to the other party's preferences and giving the gift to someone who pays attention to them could the gift be successfully given.

However, the mature man did not receive the warm smile of An Tiya, despite him not being able to see her face under her hat.

"I won't give it to someone who can't even give it to themselves?" An Tiya said indifferently.

"I'm wearing a headgear dug up from a tomb. I'm afraid I'll have nightmares if I wear it at night."

Zhao Xu was also surprised to see An Tiya scold him in front of him, and could only suppress his smile.

After An Tiya jeered at him, she directly took Zhao Xu's hand, and the two of them disappeared into thin air.

Leaving behind a few people in disarray in the wind...

It wasn't until a white light scattered that Zhao Xu realized he and An Tiya had transported to a desolate wilderness, where the silence was eerie and there was no human sound, only the occasional howling of the cold wind from the mountains.

Meanwhile, the sky in the distance had lost all light, indicating that they were no longer near the Frosty Town.

In fact, Zhao Xu also didn't expect An Tiya to appear in front of him like this.

At this point, he took a good look at the lone girl who had appeared, but unfortunately, her combat power was too strong, and Zhao Xu began to doubt whether he had developed some kind of functional disability.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Teacher, what's the meaning of that order just now?" asked Zhao Xu.

In reality, almost everyone was intimidated by An Niya's legendary mage identity and didn't realize what she was saying.

This order with a serial number, categorized by level, can summon different levels of power participation.

As for the previous time, it's unnecessary to mention. The second-level order has already required all the mages present to cooperate unconditionally, and the association will provide corresponding compensation afterwards.

Even a legendary mage like An Niya would have to give in to some face-saving gestures.

Thinking about it, Zhao Xu was worried that he had just stumbled into some big storm, involving this level of order.

"Oh, I was just afraid that there were a few old fossils inside, who would nitpick some trivial things. I didn't want to waste words, so I just made up an order, but I didn't expect them to be so soft and intimidated by my identity."

An Niya smiled lightly, not bothering to explain.

Although it's not a spectacular event, forging a high-level order from the Mage Association is indeed a big deal.

An Niya's expression, showing concern for Zhao Xu but unable to speak, was very satisfying.

Suddenly, she gave up on telling Zhao Xu the truth and actually had a permanent "233" order in her hand.

She could modify the previous header time whenever she needed to use it. This order was also absolute and could be checked by the association. So, after the order was published as "233", it would directly jump to "234".
Here is the translation:

"Don't worry, I'm here for a reason. Tonight, I'll take you to meet someone and persuade them to hand over something."

At this point, Anastasia finally regained her normal composure and looked serious for a moment.

"Yes?"

"Just tonight, I'll mainly take you to meet someone and persuade them to hand it over."

Although Anastasia didn't elaborate on what it was, Zhao Xiu's mind suddenly flashed back to the middle-aged man who had mentioned the mysterious existence that could be transformed from the "Old Witch" by possessing the "treasure".

It was an extraordinary intuitive reaction.

"Looks like the people from the Gust family have already told you about the 'Old Witch' of Frost Town, which is abnormal?" Anastasia said.

Zhao Xiu nodded, "Really?"

But he didn't think that the other party's level was so high that Anastasia had to take personal action.

According to what he said, wasn't it someone who had obtained the treasure by chance?

Zhao Xiu suddenly understood the other party's information and estimated that it was second-hand.

"Is that a legend?" Zhao Xiu asked tentatively.

At this point, Anastasia's expression changed, as if she was tired and exhausted, "If it's a legend, it would be even easier to resolve."

Zhao Xiu immediately recounted the information he had received from the other party to Anastasia.

Anastasia shook her head and sighed, "The Gust family has really fallen quickly, no wonder they've fallen to the point of coveting ordinary people's meager assets."

Zhao Xiu didn't bother to point out that the guild had assets that couldn't be counted in hundreds of thousands, but he didn't expect Anastasia to know that the other party was impersonating someone, and he couldn't help but ask, "Teacher, doesn't the other party have any consequences for doing this?"
Here is the translation of the text:

Anastasia knit her eyebrows slightly, "Consequences?" It seemed she had never thought of this word before, "In my memory, the master of that tomb was also a person with many enemies, and it was as if their lives had been extinguished like a lamp. Now that the Tust family has acknowledged this ancestor, they will naturally have to bear the consequences of this."

"Let's go, the nearest territory is just ahead," Anastasia said, pulling up her lace-trimmed priestess robe as she walked lightly through the mountain stream.

"What's the background of the other party?" Zhao Xu looked at Anastasia with a hint of curiosity, not daring to directly ask the question.

"Speak slowly," Anastasia suddenly seemed to be as gloomy as Zhao Xu.

"One ordinary shepherdess, and at the same time, an unparalleled lucky child."

"When King Orpheus first appeared in Arthur's time, this girl was grazing sheep in that grassland. At that time, she was staring blankly at the mysterious Orpheus, thinking he was a divine being descending from heaven. Then she knelt down to the future king and kissed the tip of his shoes."

"So she became the first believer of that existence."

As Anastasia turned back to Zhao Xu, a playful glint appeared in her eyes.

"If she weren't disgusted by the exhaustion of learning magic and decided to take a shortcut to become a mage, she would have been the second Goddess of Magic from the beginning."
