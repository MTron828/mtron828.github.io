Chapter 416: Desperate Counterattack

As May finally got to the end of her sentence, she suddenly felt an unusual sense of gravity. The magical energy seemed to be gathering from all around, even warping the light around them. She quickly finished her sentence: "I'll go find him a thousand miles away."

"This isn't our usual trip together?" someone asked.

"Just this one time?" May pointed out. "Last time, you and I went to Earth together, and it was like we'd been there before. So, I find it hard to believe it's our first time here."

Annie didn't respond to these questions.

With a calm expression, she said, "Monitoring the dynamics of Earth has been my responsibility for a long time. Going there isn't unusual."

"It is unusual, but there are only four months left. Can that kid still develop his self-defense abilities?" May furrowed her brow.

"It all depends on how you define self-defense."

"Isn't it what we arranged?" May asked.

"When you reach level 9, the magical path is just right for casting the five-ring art, relying on the 'Unbridled Hero's Spirit' technique. From then on, you'll have a small amount of potential each round, and the spell will recover once used, or you can simulate a nonexistent special skill."

"Additionally, at that level, you can cast the 'Diversion Healing Curse' that would counter the dizzying aftereffects of 'Sudden Explosion'."

"The magical path, although only four-ring, has satisfied the most critical ability of the 4th-level Curse Guardian, allowing you to cast spells without cost."

"With all these conditions added up, even if he's as useless as a pig's leg, he could still take down someone."

May's voice trailed off, and her tone became somewhat flat.
Here is the translation of the text:

"When there's no heart in calculation, monsters under the legend are limitless and have the power to fight in one battle."

"So I'm puzzled, why don't you hurry to level up for him?"

Anis Nova slightly raised her head, "This is a matter between us wizards."

In a word, you don't understand this spell.

May listened to this and said, "Yes, I'm talking too much."

"However, there's one thing I find strange."

Anis Nova took out a notebook and slowly walked towards the window, feeling the warmth of the cold winter, "What's that?"

"That demon giant was searched by the notebook by Zuko, I know that. At that time, he sealed the demon giant in the underworld and didn't dare to go to the opponent's lair to steal. Later, he used the 'mental barrier' spell to block his own and the notebook's sensing location, so the remaining demon giant couldn't find him."

"However, at that time, he had the spirit of Altoria attached to him, allowing him to cast the nine-ring magic. Now he's just a three-ring novice, and before he went to the Northern Alliance, he didn't think about himself carrying the notebook and approaching the ice mountain while being found by the demon giant."

May's words were laced with sarcasm.

Zuko didn't understand the various causes and consequences, so he forgot about it later.

She believed that Anis Nova would never forget this.

Because she was clear that for the day of Earth crossing, Anis Nova had silently laid out a plan for the wizard's association thousands of years ago.

"Before he left Mistral, I released the 'death contract' spell on him. Its response level is faster than the revival stone."

"So as long as Zuko has an accident, I can know immediately and fly back."

After listening, May finally realized she had miscalculated.
Here is the translation of the text:

When Anitonoja took Zhao Xu to visit her, she refused to see him.

Otherwise, one should be able to sense the magical arts possessed by the other party.

"Not true, since that's the case, why did you come to question me?"

Anitonoja smiled lightly and said, "Because I need to predict something from you."

"Some things you've been hiding for thousands of years and refuse to tell me."

"Anitonoja."

May had already figured it out, realizing that he had been probed with some inside information. "Do you know why he said Arthur was the last barrier?"

"What?"

"Hmph, I won't tell you."

After releasing the "Energy Protection" spell, Zhao Xu directly avoided fatigue, exhaustion, and property damage and absorption effects for the next 14 minutes, regardless of their source.

Just as he finished casting the spell, a sudden, murky, and greenish-black substance like a virus spread all over his body.

It was disgusting and unpleasant.

Fortunately, he had already taken a step back with Vivi before casting the spell.

The iron golem's spewing weapon, with a range of about half the size of a giant dragon, was not close enough to him.

As for the iron golems that had just mysteriously appeared, they also surrounded him, swinging their swords at Zhao Xu, but most of them were blocked by his "Sancroft" spell.

However, it did not affect the opponent's spewing attack, and suddenly another 20 waves of toxin came pouring down.

Even though Zhao Xu had immunity to property damage, he was almost turned into a little green man by the continuous 6-second toxin attack.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu didn't immediately unleash his magical tricks to clean himself up; he was instead gazing at these pesky iron golems. There were already over 20 of them, added together from the two waves. These iron golems were all above level 8, requiring over 80,000 gold coins and a considerable amount of life energy to create. Even on the market, a single one would sell for over 150,000 gold coins. They could only cause slow damage with their electric attacks, and their corrosion spells were barely passable. What worried Zhao Xu even more was that each of these iron golems weighed over 5 tons, and together they weighed hundreds of tons, pressing down on the stone bridge, causing it to start creaking. If the other side made another move or two, Zhao Xu would suspect that the bridge would break off the spot.

In an instant, a thought flashed through Zhao Xu's mind: "Vivian, transform into a miniature version and get into my pocket." Zhao Xu said this while running towards the other side.

As he finished transforming Vivian into a super-microscopic version, Zhao Xu directly led the iron golems behind him, running alongside him towards the bright path ahead.

The iron golems behind him were also taking steps, following Zhao Xu.

Every time they took a step, it caused a violent tremor on the ground, stirring up dust and debris.

As Zhao Xu rushed forward, he also saw more and more "iron golems" ahead. Instantly, they also turned around to chase after Zhao Xu.

But Zhao Xu, relying on the "Swift Acceleration Spell" he had mastered after combining his abilities with magic, surpassed his normal speed, not to mention the already slow iron golems.

Slowly, Zhao Xu's domain magic also exceeded the time limit.

In reality, among the second wave of over 10 iron golems that had arrived, a few had successfully resisted his domain magic and dodged through.
Here is the translation of the text:

Just then, the iron golem in front of him blocked his way, making it impossible for him to attack him.

This is also one of the weaknesses of King Arthur in close combat, as he is often surrounded by fewer people and cannot attack unless he has a physical advantage or is in a disadvantaged position.

As Zhao Xu clenched his teeth and made a full-power charge, he began to see the appearance of the flesh golem, stone golem, and clay golem, as well as the initial appearance of the mud golem.

At this time, the four major golems that are most commonly seen in the golem family had been fully equipped on this bridge.

The flesh golem (7th level), mud golem (10th level), stone golem (11th level), and iron golem (13th level) formed a large army behind Zhao Xu, with the number increasing.

The vibration of the bridge also increased, and Zhao Xu could even feel the rapid movement of his running process, with the bridge starting to oscillate.

In the end, when he finally reached the endpoint with the bright light, there were already hundreds of golems accumulated behind him.

Even under conditions where flight is not possible, even high-level mages would be shocked by this sight.

Not being able to beat them, one would naturally flee. This is, in essence, the lifestyle of a mage.

Many novice mages who go on wild adventures and die in the process often prepare for "Shadow Technique".

When encountering unfavorable situations, they release the technique and then flee in place, which is sometimes more effective than a three-ring technique.

Zhao Xu was still thinking about another approach, which was to try to eat a dead spider or use the "Simulation Magic" to avoid material loss.

Then he cast the "Spider Technique" and crawled to the endpoint under the bridge.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

The demons that could only walk on the bridge, were also helpless at the bottom of the bridge. Although the mage couldn't fly, he still possessed multiple means of transportation. However, he was worried that the twenty iron demons staring at him from below the bridge would cause the bridge to collapse. At that time, he was unable to even lift a finger and could only succumb to the scorching magma below. Nevertheless, he managed to run to the end and it made no difference. As he approached, he could clearly see everything ahead. On the stone bridge above the magma, the end was a smooth, dead wall, but embedded in the wall was a suspended portal emitting a radiant beam of hope. The three-meter-high stone portal was ancient-looking, with a doorframe resonating with transmission energy, giving off a strong sense of history, as if waiting for him for a long time.

Zhao Xun suddenly kicked with all his might and rushed towards the portal emitting flashes of white light. However, he soon discovered that something was not as he had expected. A sharp pain shot through his body, making him feel as if all his bones had been dislodged. He directly passed through the portal's light circle, but did not enter a new world, instead crashing into the stone wall at the end of the bridge. He hit the wall without warning, causing his head to bleed.

The demon army behind him, although slower than Zhao Xun, was slowly closing in. Even if Zhao Xun used his sacred domain spell, he would not last for more than an hour or two. However, Zhao Xun did not panic, but instead began to inspect the portal's doorframe, thinking about where the problem lay. Suddenly, he noticed the four symbols on the doorframe, each corresponding to the forms of four different demons.
Here is the translation:

Zhao Xu, the clay golem, slightly revealed a faint glow at the bottom half of his body, as if he had been filled with something.

At this time, Vi Vi also quietly poked her head out of his pocket bag: "It's just like those clay golems we killed."

"That's right, I'm afraid we have to kill all the golems behind us, fill them with light, and this teleportation gate will officially open," Zhao Xu added.

He looked at the army of golems that had already arrived from behind him.

They were taking heavy steps, but this stone bridge was still holding up, despite the repeated shocks.

As Zhao Xu's eyes sparkled, he began to chant an unusual incantation.

The designer of this stone bridge must have taken into account the impact of these golems when designing it.

Although it won't be too high, it should be enough for the golems to move together.

But what if he adds a little more?

"Shatter the ground!"
As Zhao Xu finished chanting his cold incantation, a devastating sonic energy burst forth, and the bridge beneath him suddenly began to crack.

Like being hit by a shockwave, one blow after another, pounding the ground.

Zhao Xu had once used this technique to extract a notebook from under a stone slab in a muddy cave.

At this moment, the golem army, without intelligence, did not realize the danger of death and did not know that the bridge's other end had already appeared with a massive crack.

They continued to take heavy steps, striding confidently towards the destination.

"Slap."
Here is the translation of the text:

Just like the sound of an avalanche before it crashes, the entire stone bridge, which was as thick and massive as a giant, spanning the two cliffs, suddenly became as fragile as glass. The surface of the bridge was covered in intricate patterns like a spider's web. "Dong!"

The first stone fell, striking the magma below and producing a scorching sound. The entire bridge collapsed into the magma sea, breaking into countless fragments with no remaining attachment. The magma erupted in a fiery explosion.

As for Zhao Xu, who had just completed the "Wall-Crawling" spell, he used the bonus from the 30-level enhancement granted by the spell, which he had acquired after leveling up his magic to above level 9. With ease, he grasped the edge of the transmission portal with his bare hands.

Just then, the portal began to malfunction, and the four demon marks on its surface started to glow slowly. This indicated that the portal was ready for use. However, Zhao Xu's gaze was captivated by the magma below.

The demons that had fallen into the magma began to emit a mysterious glow, and the symbols engraved on them started to shine like golden lights, bursting out of the surface of the magma. The lights then charged towards Zhao Xu.

Zhao Xu hastily pulled out a golden copper box from his backpack with his other hand. The golden symbols on the box, like tiny energy swords, stabbed into the box, causing Zhao Xu to almost lose his grip on the box as it fell into the magma.

In the end, the numerous golden lights finally completed the entire pattern on the golden copper box in Zhao Xu's hand.
The seemingly ordinary bronze treasure box suddenly emitted a dazzling flash of light that was blindingly intense.

Its shape began to change.
