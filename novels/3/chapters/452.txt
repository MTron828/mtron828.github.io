Chapter 453: Unexpected Visit from a Legend

On the second day, Zhao Xu followed the family tradition and ate a traditional vegetarian meal for breakfast. He then feigned exhaustion and stayed at home, not venturing out.

Meanwhile, his parents had prepared a pile of gifts and were planning to visit their relatives and friends, as well as business associates.

After listening to his parents' reminders, Zhao Xu pretended to go back to bed, putting on his helmet.

Since discovering that he was the "Summer" of Arthur's legend, Nan Xiaoyi had been treating him with immense enthusiasm and respect, almost to the point of idolizing him. This made Zhao Xu unable to resist knocking on the opposite side of his head.

As the simulated helmet connected to Arthur's network, Zhao Xu's vision gradually cleared up, and he suddenly found himself facing a vast expanse of white.

The sudden snowstorm brought on by the cold winter air struck him like a slap in the face. Despite being dressed warmly in the game, Zhao Xu still felt the biting cold of winter.

In his previous life, he had experienced the harsh winter, when many people who were struggling to survive had to endure the freezing temperatures.

"You've finally arrived?" At that moment, An Ti Noya was looking at him from inside the carriage, gazing at him through the curtains.

"This snow is really quite big," Zhao Xu sighed. "It's only been a day since we went online, and the entire Star Lake has become a sea of white snow."

"Not because of you," An Ti Noya teased lightly.

"Uh?"
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu's astonished voice was just about to fade away when he suddenly remembered something.

During the Battle of Star Lake, he had used the "Fimbulfly's Winter" magic to prevent the spread of the plague caused by the heat. In an instant, the cold wind brought winter to the world.

At that moment, he had turned the vast plain in front of Star Lake into a white battlefield. It was the first time that Arthur's players realized that the power of magic could be terrifying.

"It's not my fault," Zhao Xu sighed. His gaze pierced through the city wall of Star Lake, and he had a sense of understanding in his heart.

He had used the magic to prevent the players and villagers from dying from the plague. However, it was also because of the magic that many poor people would die in this harsh winter without coal or firewood to keep warm.

Zhao Xu's eyes became deep and profound.

Perhaps, in the future, he would be more cautious when using magic that could have a long-term impact on the environment.

"Let's go, don't dwell on it," said Anniya. "Have you realized that 'Fimbulfly's Winter' is easy to cast, but hard to undo?"

As she spoke, her eyes also became somewhat dim. "Each time we cast a spell, we are carrying the weight of life. Magic itself is a mark we leave on this world."

"It's a matter of whether you create a magnificent miracle or destroy the source of life, leaving everything barren."

Zhao Xu remained silent after listening. However, when he turned back, he found that the "carriage" that was originally there was no longer there.

"Where's the horse?"
Here is the translation of the text:

"What's left of the horse?"

It's unlikely that An Tiya would make such a promise, only to have it backfire just a day later.

"What are you thinking? No one can steal a horse from me in front of me," An Tiya scolded. "I would have let that ordinary horse stay here, but I'm worried it won't be able to survive, so I sent it back early."

"Okay."

Zhou Xu repeated the old routine of "Arraying the Art of Magic" and then continued to cast the spell.

"Shadow Steed!"

As of today, Zhou Xu has mastered the Three-Ring Spell without any hesitation.

In an instant, a large, half-real horse-like creature took shape in the misty cloud, with its oil-black, glossy head and body, accompanied by gray fur and tail, looking no different from a normal warhorse, except that its limbs were made of misty smoke, revealing the summoned creature's true nature.

Under the blessing of Zhou Xu's over 20th-level magic, the Shadow Steed's speed directly reached the limit, with a sprint speed of 50 meters per second.

It can also carry weights exceeding that of a normal human body, making it suitable for labor.

At this time, the Shadow Steed, which had obtained "Flight Ability" due to Zhou Xu's over 13th-level magic, saw Zhou Xu pointing at the carriage in front of him, and slumped his head, honestly going to tie up the carriage.

Zhou Xu jumped onto the driver's seat of the carriage, sighing, "Summoning a Shadow Steed is indeed more cost-effective than raising a warhorse."

Especially from the perspective of maintenance costs, it's even more so.
Here is the translation of the text:

Arthur, once the warhorses of the players have died, the feeling of sorrow is no different from the reality of a new car being totaled in a direct collision.

"Teacher, I think I can cast a levitation spell on the carriage, and we'll be able to fly," said Anniya, a curtain inside, with a faint tone.

"Levitation is not a sustainable minute-level spell, and if you're willing to give up these spell slots, I won't mind," said Anniya.

Zhao Xu immediately began to consider it.

Anniya said this, making it seem difficult to achieve, but he had the condition for "spell delay" and a two-ring spell that could last nearly an hour.

He could really achieve this.

"Hey, look," said a hunter who had secretly buried a trap on the mountain slope during a big snowstorm, shaking his head in disbelief at his companion.

"What's wrong? Be quiet, don't disturb the nearby snow foxes. The nobles in the city are willing to pay a high price for a snow fox fur."

The hunter beside him didn't care, and continued to study the trap in his hand.

When the snow fell again, this trap would become extremely secret.

"It's not that, look, it's a supernatural phenomenon!" the hunter exclaimed, pulling his companion along.

At a distance from their line of sight.

On the vast, spotless snowfield without a single stain, a warhorse was running at top speed, pulling the carriage behind it.

It was as if it was a high-speed train on the snowfield.

Only, no matter how hard they rubbed their eyes, they couldn't see the hoof prints and tire marks behind the fast-moving horse carriage.

As if the horse was flying.

"Really exhilarating," Zhao Xu exclaimed, holding onto the fast-moving carriage.
Here is the translation of the text:

At this moment, the vehicle's speed was too fast, and the intense cold wind suddenly hit his face, pouring into his mouth. If it weren't for Zhao Xu's own shield provided by his mage armor, most of the icy wind and snow had been blocked, otherwise his face would have been frozen by now.

"You're really having a great time!" An Ti Nuo Ya noticed that the vehicle was floating after losing traction with the ground, and its speed on the snowy terrain was comparable to a high-speed sedan.

"This is the joy of a man," Zhao Xu couldn't help but shout loudly, otherwise the howling of the wind and snow would have covered it up.

Just like many girls couldn't understand why a 30-year-old man could play games so enthusiastically.

Zhao Xu couldn't help but joke, "Without desire, men would definitely tend to play with men together, this is the romance of men."

"Zhou Xia, I didn't know when you became a man," An Ti Nuo Ya said and directly pulled up the car curtain, just as she poked her head out, the cold wind blew her face red.

Suddenly, Zhao Xu jerked the reins of the horse.

In front of him, a white figure suddenly appeared, covered in ice and snow.

Zhao Xu was absolutely certain that the other party had just not been there.

Otherwise, he would have been able to dodge and pass by the other party's side.

However, the other party suddenly appeared, and with the vehicle's intense speed of over 100 kilometers per hour, it was impossible to brake in time.

In the next second, he would inevitably collide with the other party!

With the vehicle's force, he didn't even need to consider that the other party would be shattered into pieces.

This was a tragic accident that even the most skilled driver would find difficult to avoid!
Here is the translation of the text:

Time was already running out for him to cast a spell, and Anzuyo inside the carriage heard his cry of surprise and was already about to collide with the opponent.

In this moment of great suspense, Zhao Xu's eyes turned as dull as a stone, as if the high-and-mighty god was looking down on humanity.

"Swift explosion!"
Four-ring magic!
This spell was the key four-ring magic that Zhao Xu had touched upon.
After he cast it, he could use a "standard action time" spell even if the opponent was less than half a centimeter away from his throat.
In this moment, a thin, delicate snowflake was about to fall on Zhao Xu's nose, but it couldn't fall down.
The sandglass time was frozen in this instant, like a paused animation.
"Biggie's Strong Rush Fist!"
Zhao Xu immediately decided to cast this spell that could knock down people!
Strong Rush Fist was not exceptional in Biggie's fist series, but it was just right for the current situation.
If the person who suddenly appeared fell to the ground, their floating carriage could go through without a hitch, and because it was suspended, it wouldn't crush the opponent.

However.
Just as Zhao Xu saw the "Strong Rush Fist" he had cast, saw the fist with a flowing glow, which grew as large as a human torso, and took shape in front of the opponent.
Then it was swung out with great force.
But.
The force was suddenly released, and it floated away.
Even the carriage was directly pulled by a massive force, and suddenly stopped in its tracks, without seeing any sparks or hearing the dull sound of the brakes.
As a result, the Phantom Steed and the carriage stopped just before colliding with this mysterious person.
The opponent took off his mask-like headgear and bent down slightly.
"May I introduce myself? Legendary Mage ---"

(Note: This is a common way to introduce oneself in a formal or professional setting, and the "Legendary Mage" part is likely to be a humorous or ironic title.)
