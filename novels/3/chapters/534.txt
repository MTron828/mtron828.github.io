Chapter 535: This Defense is Not Enough

"By the way, I'm assigning a task to all players. Whoever can find the lair of the Chimera will be able to come to me and choose a manual that boosts their internal attributes by 5 points."

Zhao Xu then dropped another explosive shell.

"Oh!"

"This is a waste of money!"

"How much does it cost?"

"It's said that in Auror City, there's a wealthy player who has asked about the price of a standard manual that boosts internal attributes by 5 points, and it's around tens of thousands of gold coins. If you don't spend over 200,000 gold coins, don't even think about it."

"I'm going, and I can use it to exchange for four pieces of +6 magical equipment."

As soon as he said this, the players who were initially hesitant looked at Zhao Xu's eyes with longing, as if he were a treasure trove of gold.

Everyone noticed that Zhong Xia was saying "any one" of the manuals!

Carrying a massive amount of gold coins?

"Remember, remind them that as long as they can find the location of the lair, they can come and receive the reward. If they can't find it, they can exchange the result of searching for other lairs for some rewards and wait for me to arrange it later."

Zhao Xu finished giving his orders and then drove away on his shadow stallion.

The White Dragon Serus also transformed into his original form, spreading his massive wings and flying away, leaving a lasting impression on everyone...

"...Old Big Shot," the White Dragon Serus said, licking his face, "You should give me that manual. I'll use my powerful allies to ensure that we can find the lair before today."
As Serus spoke, a sorrowful look appeared on his face, saying, "That's a manual worth a king's ransom." 

At this time, Zhao Xu controlled the heavens and soared into the sky. 

Despite the howling wind in the high altitude, he could still hear the deliberate roar of the White Dragon. 

Zhao Xu just smiled, but didn't explain. 

As he participated in the "Starfall Town" war, the snowball kept growing and even felt some existential crisis. 

In reality, adding up the ransom for the hostages taken today, it was still far from the zeroth part of the attribute manual he had promised. 

However, Zhao Xu needed to use "bounty" to identify the brave warriors among the players. 

By filtering out these unknown strong ones, it would also facilitate the recruitment of new team members in the future. 

The key point was that Zhao Xu, who had returned to Starfall Town, knew everything thoroughly, including the development trajectory of the next few years.

The White Dragon Serus didn't know that Zhao Xu was driving the phantom horse in the direction of the Chimeria Nest at this moment. 

Historically, it would take another month for the town to appear in the case of the town residents being attacked. 

At that time, the strong warriors from Winter City would only solve the sudden appearance of over ten Chimeria. 

On the other hand, as Zhao Xu gave out this "bounty". 

Immediately, players went offline to spread the news, and those watching the show on the forum were sorry to miss it, feeling that it was too far away to grasp.

However, nearby towns, including Winter City's famous player team, had already begun to pack their bags and head towards Starfall Town.

The attribute manual was 6 internal attributes in Zhao Xu's eyes. 

However, in the eyes of these bounties players, it was an opportunity for sudden wealth.

After flying for about an hour, Zhao Xu and the Phantom Steed began to descend, slowing down and landing near a cave entrance. White Dragon Serus also followed suit, looking around at the ordinary cave entrance with a mixture of surprise and curiosity. There were at least two or three dozen cave entrances overlapping each other, making it impossible for Chimera to transform. Zhao Xu was about to point out the target to White Dragon Serus when suddenly, White Dragon Serus let out a loud roar, "Who's there?" The dragon's roar shook the air, causing Zhao Xu's eardrums to vibrate. The surrounding forest seemed to be rustling in the wind. Suddenly, a girl with a tremulous voice appeared behind a giant oak tree, bowing deeply and saying, "Mr. Zhong Xia, Mr. Bai Long." "So, you're the priestess who came to the village with the mage, Jing Wei?" White Dragon Serus raised an eyebrow, silently removing her from the dinner menu. He also avoided becoming a skeleton dragon's fate. In his opinion, Jing Wei, the mage, was clearly shielding this priestess. Although the latter always smiled warmly, she would unconsciously want to follow the former every time they interacted. White Dragon Serus was sure this wasn't magic's influence, and it warned itself to keep a safe distance from the priestess to avoid making her a legendary knight. The priestess, of course, was also unable to move. "Hello, Pastor Zheng Xin'er," Zhao Xu said, greeting her. Zhao Xu didn't expect Zheng Xin'er to be so close to him that he hadn't noticed. It seemed that his body had been overworked recently, and his sensitivity to the fragments of the God of Death's power had decreased significantly.

"Little girl, this place is very dangerous, don't go running around," Sergeant Cerus warned with a menacing grin, showing off his sharp teeth.

Zhao Xu saw Cerus's fierce expression and made up his mind on the spot, deciding to use his "Malicious Metamorphosis" spell on the white dragon when he became a five-ring mage. He planned to transform the white dragon into a "Husky".

Just then, Zheng Xin'an couldn't help but burst out laughing. Realizing her mistake, she blushed and explained, "I've been spreading the divine teachings and have taken on a disciple. The disciple happened to go to the militia training this morning."

"I was just gathering herbs nearby and suddenly heard my disciple's 'call' in my mind, so I came to take a look and saw that you all appeared out of nowhere."

The white dragon Cerus widened his eyes in surprise, saying, "We were just about to stop and happened to find a suitable location, it's really a blessing from the goddess of fortune."

Zhao Xu, on the other hand, gave Cerus a sidelong glance, which made Cerus feel a bit uneasy. Since Cerus had sworn to kill Tyamath, he had been involuntarily mentioning various goddesses in his speech.

It seemed like he was eyeing a new leg to hug.

As for Zheng Xin'an, she had already confirmed that Lakshmi had given her at least some "permissions".

"What do you think the call might be from?" Zhao Xu asked.

The white dragon Cerus was taken aback and wanted to argue with Zhao Xu, but after Zhao Xu gave him a stern look, he quietly moved to the side, staring at Zhao Xu with a strange expression.

As for the woman Vivian, who was accompanying them, her physique was still visible even with the silver armor covering her. It was clear that she was still developing.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Isn't it strange that this older brother, Summer, has such a special hobby that players talk about?

Zheng Xin'an didn't quite understand the situation, so he pointed to one of the suspicious holes.

"Congratulations, Xin'an the Pastor, as the first player to find the nest, you can choose a +5 attribute manual."

Zhao Xu suddenly clapped his hands and then, in the astonished gaze of Zheng Xin'an, recounted the entire story.

"Oh, I was just lucky, and now it's too late to verify, so I can't take this reward," Zheng Xin'an shook his head to refuse.

But Zhao Xu just joked, "Pastor Xin'an, this is an arrangement by the organization."

From Zheng Xin'an's perspective, Summer's "organization" referred to the town of Starfall. However, Zhao Xu was clear that "organization" referred to their secret church.

As an aside, he handed out the reward and completed a gesture of "buying bones with gold."

The next time he published a task, the responders would be endless.

"Shall we go in?" asked Bian Longseru.

Zhao Xu looked at Zheng Xin'an, who wore a +4 chain armor and a small round shield, and said in a calm tone, "Mages have to be 100% prepared. We're not adventuring, but seeking certain victory."

"Secret Eye."

Instantly, Zhao Xu cast the four-ring spell without distance limitations, and in his line of sight, a hidden magical sensor appeared.

It looked like a person looking ahead.

As a minute-long spell, Zhao Xu controlled this secret eye to infiltrate the cave."
Here is the translation of the text:

It's like a mini drone equipped with a real-time camera, helping Zhao Xu and others to explore the details of the mysterious cave.

Since he wants to be safe, he needs to explore inside and find out what's going on.

"Isn't it likely that those hostages will die?" Bai Long suggested.

Zhao Xu also nodded, "Looks like I'll have to follow you for a while, and you can also become a benevolent dragon like me."

"Don't worry, I've already used the transmission spell of the Four Rings to confirm that they are all being detained, and there is no immediate danger."

Twenty minutes later, Zhao Xu nodded, "Okay, I've basically got the situation under control."

"Okay, watch me dismantle this group of Chimera," Bai Long exclaimed.

"No, I need to cast a protective spell on Lady Zheng Xin first, her defense is not sufficient."

Zheng Xin heard these words and turned red in the face.

In the online game, weakness is the original sin.

Bai Long furrowed his brow, thinking to himself that he shouldn't be bothered with this little girl, but he didn't dare to contradict Zhao Xu, "Then hurry up."

A few spells won't take too long, Bai Long thought.

Zhao Xu nodded and turned around to look at Zheng Xin, raising his staff.

Ten protective spells should be enough, right?
