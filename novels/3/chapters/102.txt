Chapter 103: The Might of the Giant Dragon

[Adventurer Summer, your "Fierce Aura" ability fails, and you fall into a state of panic for 4D6 (4-24) rounds = 7 rounds (42 seconds).]

As soon as Zhao Xu saw this state, his heart sank.

Dragons are divided into 12 age stages, from hatchlings to the strongest ancient dragons. At least, a young dragon at the 5th stage will possess the "Fierce Aura" ability, also known as Dragon Will!

Although Zhao Xu has the blessings of the gods, his "panic state" is not as intense as that of his protectors. However, he still feels a deep sense of oppression within.

After overcoming his discomfort, Zhao Xu struggled to lift his headâ€”

A giant golden dragon with a body covered in a layer of orange light appeared above them, flying continuously without being very agile but with incredible speed.

As the sun set, the dragon's body was illuminated by an orange glow. As it flew away, its body gradually merged into the orange-red sunset, like a vast area of light, transforming into a patch of the sky.

Zhao Xu realized that the golden dragon, which had suddenly let out a mighty roar and was flying away, was not targeting them.

It was simply flying aimlessly, exhausted, and letting out a roar to shake the surrounding area.

After a while, the golden dragon disappeared from their line of sight, hiding in the sky above the sunset.

However, this brief episode of the golden dragon had a profound impact on the entire merchant caravan of Luo Ya.
Here is the translation of the text:

Not mentioning those horses that have collapsed on the ground, even those that had fought bravely alongside warriors, many of the guards are now trembling, unable to hold their weapons steady. Some are even hugging their heads, covered in cold sweat, with no thought of resistance. More of them are kneeling on the ground, bowing down in reverence towards the golden dragon, as if it were a divine being. If the golden dragon were to stay here, the entire merchant team would likely flee without leaving a single person behind. The state of panic has thoroughly dominated everyone. Zhao Xu, who had previously sworn to slay dragons, now finds himself under the control of panic, but he remains the calmest among the group. "This is the golden dragon," he said to the few players, "metal dragons are benevolent creatures, unlike the evil five-colored dragons." In fact, Zhao Xu had already relaxed his guard the moment he saw the golden dragon, knowing that the benevolent creature would not attack them without reason. If it were a malevolent old black dragon, it would certainly let out a deafening roar, followed by a spewing of acid that would deal 16-64 points of damage, killing anyone in its path. At this moment, everyone was still trapped in a state of panic, as if they had experienced a real-life horror movie scene. Even Luoya was powerless to rally the team. Unless there was a five-level or above player present, anyone who failed to resist the dragon's aura would either flee or cower together in a group. "What kind of negative state is this? It's so strong!" complained Maple Leaf, who as a player did not have the same level of native understanding as Arthur.

But when he saw that the guards who had fought bravely alongside him had become like this, he couldn't help but feel curious about their fearful thoughts.

"Have you noticed your status bar?" Zhao Xu explained.

At this time, a few people also approached, and in this state, they could warm each other up and encourage each other.

"There is, but it only shows a negative status, and at least 40 seconds," Rainbow replied.

Zhao Xu nodded, and the information panel wouldn't be able to display their knowledge and skills like Rainbow didn't know about this ability, so it could only show a state of panic.

"That is the 'Fierce Aura' ability of the dragon tribe, and those with 5HD or below will usually fall into a state of panic if they don't succeed, and those with 5HD or above will fall into a state of trembling," Zhao Xu explained.

For players, 1 level is equivalent to 1 HD life die, and 5HD means having 5 life dice, which is equivalent to a 5-level player.

When talking about "trembling," the memories of the few people, including Maple Leaf, came to mind, and this thing could suppress their various checks, equivalent to a 10% disadvantage.

Who would have thought that the state of panic above trembling would actually scare people away.

"Really, the dragon tribe is unbeatable."

Maple Leaf saw that the golden dragon was only showing a negative status, and it knocked them all down, suddenly realizing that his dream of slaying the dragon was shattered.

Zhao Xu just shook his head and silently gazed at the distant horizon, not knowing what reason the golden dragon had just used to suppress them.

Even the animals outside the merchant team, in the nearby valley, were also frightened and ran wildly.

The sounds of animals running and trampling continued to echo.

Those with 5HD or below would fail and fall into a state of panic, effectively eliminating the tactic of slaying the dragon.

So, Zhao Xu had also practiced to the 5th level before joining the dragon-slaying team. The dragon race itself is not an easy problem for mages, as they have inherent magical resistance that can resist the effects of magic, and they are even themselves mages, just like the same group of grandpas who practice magic.

It took nearly a minute for everyone to calm down from the "panic" state, and the entire team slowly began to regroup, with a few who had fled returning.

"Mr. Zhongxiao, do you have any ideas?" Luo Ya came over and asked for his opinion.

Zhao Xu looked at the staff in his hand and wondered what he could do. The "Protective Barrier" could only prevent him from being attacked by the dragon's close-range attacks.

"All sorts of spitting or magic are useless against them."

"Let's keep going, we can't cancel this operation," Zhao Xu said.

Luo Ya smiled brightly.

He knew that the Golden Dragon, being a benevolent dragon, would not harm them.

However, it was possible that a giant dragon would leave the Tianduan Mountain range and risk being detected by stronger enemies while wandering between towns. It was unlikely that the road ahead would be smooth.

Or, he might need Zhao Xu to give him some psychological comfort.

"What's wrong, Uncle Zhongxiao?" Luo Ya asked when he left.

Zhao Xu let out a sigh, "The Golden Dragon has the ability to change its form. When they walk in human cities, they often transform into humans to avoid directly taking the form of a giant dragon. So, Luo Ya is afraid of unexpected dangers ahead."

After they passed through this gorge, they began to enter a human town. From then on, they had to switch to a pattern of day resting and night traveling to avoid daytime reconnaissance.
Here is the translation of the text:

"What's to be afraid of? It's no big deal if we have to fight again." After being kicked by a horse and barely recovering from near-death, Rainbow, the wanderer, spoke with a tone of confidence.

As the team slowly reorganized and continued on, they eventually made their way through the gorge and emerged onto the plain.

It wasn't until night was about to fall that Zhao Xu and his companions finally reached the first human settlement, Moonlight Town, marking the end of their seven or eight-day journey as wild people.

After Moonlight Town, they still had three days of travel before they could reach the foot of the Tian Duan Mountains, where Kaso and Butan City were located.

It was there that Zhao Xu could finally find a wizard's guild to send him back home.

If he delayed any further, he'd have to take three levels.

If the scroll scholar didn't advance, he'd go bad."
