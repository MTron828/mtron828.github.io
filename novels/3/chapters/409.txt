Chapter 410: This place prohibits flight

Vivianna had just used her "Detection of Malice" skill on all the stone doors with the same result: no abnormalities were detected.

According to the divination, Zhao Xu and Vivianna decided to enter the door with the result "Ji" (auspicious).

As Zhao Xu walked in, he clearly saw that the stone pillars were carved with several coffins, which made him suspicious that there might be a challenge involving undead creatures inside.

However, Zhao Xu, who had dealt with undead creatures the most, was not worried at all. He held the strongest spirit slave rod, which was also designed to counter undead creatures.

The stone door in front of him was completely sealed, with no gaps or cracks. The ground was covered with a deep green stone slab, which was different from the surrounding yellow soil and seemed out of place.

Ordinarily, narrow corridors would have stone slabs like this, which would trigger a trap when stepped on. However, this seemed different.

"I'll go first," Zhao Xu said.

"Will you be okay, Will-Long?" Vivianna cautioned. "You have more vitality, so shouldn't you be the one standing on top?"

Vivianna's expression was stern, and even if she had to sacrifice Zhao Xu, she would do it.

"Don't just stand there," Zhao Xu laughed. "If it's a trap, I'll just call out a phantom servant to step on the stone slab and weigh it down. However, I'm worried that the previous maze testing didn't allow the servant to detect special features, so I'll try it myself."

Holding the "Secondary Turbo" and "Teleportation Boots", he had the absolute guarantee of escape. Only someone who could also turbo-boost could defeat him, not some lifeless mechanical thing. Therefore, it was only natural that this kind of wizard would set up such a trap, with a saintly warrior looking on from behind, watching the thrilling scene unfold.

Just thinking about it, Zhao Xu was still directing Vivi to stand a little farther away. Generally, he believed that Vivi would not get into trouble. However, this was a high-level trap, and there was a divine corpse inside, so Zhao Xu did not dare to be certain.

Holding the ultra-magical scepter, Zhao Xu prepared to cast a spell and then stepped onto the deep blue stone plate. Suddenly, the originally quiet and serene circular hall, where the sound of footsteps was echoed, was filled with the sound of mechanical gears and chains.

As the ground began to vibrate slightly, Zhao Xu saw the door in front of him start to turn. The rotating door! Zhao Xu immediately reacted, urging Vivi to come running over from a distance and stand beside him on the green stone slab.

After the door had turned 180 degrees, Zhao Xu, who was originally standing outside, was also pulled into the room.

"This door design is a bit too deliberate," Zhao Xu commented.

The entire process from opening to closing took two minutes.

In other words, the speed was extremely slow. By the time the door had turned out, it had taken at least half a minute. "It's a bit like our style," Vivi also commented.

The rotating door meant that they wanted to escape, and they had to wait for the door to open slowly. If they encountered danger and were being chased inside, they would have no time to wait for the door to open.
Here is the translation of the text:

To ensure that they have no obstacles to enter, but also to delay their escape time. Meanwhile, the design of the door cannot block the enemy from opening it.

Zhou Xu at this time took out a non-extinguishing torch and gave one to Vivi and each other. Like Zhou Xu, he directly inserted it into the back of his body.

The non-extinguishing torch is not a real torch, so he didn't need to hold it mechanically in his hand.

Only when the torch illuminated in front of him did everyone take a deep breath, and it was no wonder that he felt a slight burning sensation when he entered just now.

They stood on a small platform above a cliffside precipice, where more than ten people could stand.

There was also a stone bridge wide enough for people to lie down in the middle, connecting from their side to the other side. However, the opposite side was too dark and deep, making it impossible to see.

In short, they had to cross the bridge without handrails to get to the other side.

What's even more terrifying is that below the cliffside precipice, there was a constantly boiling and rolling magma, with an unbearable temperature. Even if they threw a head of beef down, it would be impossible to see more than a few bones.

"Really a grand gesture, these spatial layers overlapping, but I didn't feel any discomfort entering this door," Zhou Xu sighed.

Vivi also nodded in agreement after observing.

Just the empty space in front of them had already occupied the space of the two side doors.

It meant that the other two doors would also automatically reconfigure the space.

"However, are we really going to walk across?" Vivi asked with a hint of reluctance.

As she wore armor, if she fell down, she would definitely not be able to be pulled back.

Zhou Xu understood the intention.

Both of them could fly, and they didn't need to walk across the bridge to get to the other side.
When the mage reached the third ring and mastered the flying spell, some adventures that were blocked by cliffs or complex terrain became jokes.

Or in other words, having the courage to enter this mysterious building without even having the ability to fly is quite embarrassing.

The problem is, could it really be that simple?

"I'll go check it out first." When Zhao Xu saw that there was an obviously easy path, he became worried instead.

He directly recited an incantation, took out an unlit candle from his bag, and began to make casting gestures.

Compared to the usual "standard action" spell casting time, this time Zhao Xu's chanting and casting time was almost a full round.

During these 6 seconds, he was completely passive and stiff in his casting.

In a one-on-one battle, the opponent would never give him such comfortable time.

In usual mage battles, everyone seizes the opportunity to release "standard action" spells, and if suppressed, there are also "swift action" spells.

Some even use their own spell specialization to turn standard actions into swift ones.

Therefore, this is a completely different type of spellâ€”first level monster summoning!

The first time An Tinoya exchanged blows with Zhao Xu, she used similar spells in this regard.

Monster summoning is a series of spells, from first ring to ninth ring, each ring has a summoning list from which monsters can be chosen and summoned.

They are usually creatures from other planes, typically from otherworldly beings, elemental creatures, or magical beasts from other planes.

At the same time, the duration of the monster summoning spell is very short, it is a round-level spell, but it can be dispelled at any time.

The monsters summoned are not real creatures, but projections similar to Zhao Xu and his companions.
Here is the translation of the text:

At this moment, a majestic bird of prey with a full body covered in pure white feathers stands before Zhao Xu, its eyes proudly gazing ahead. This owl species from King Arthur's realm is capable of participating in battles. With a body length of nearly 20 centimeters and wingspan of over 2 meters when stretched out, this owl is endowed with the "Divine Template" and "Infernal Template" that Zhao Xu has seen before. The abilities of divine beings also change with their life force.

The owl before us has no damage reduction, but it has 5 points of resistance to acid, cold, and electricity, as well as one daily use of a holy slash. However, its challenge level is only one-fourth of what is expected. This is because the owl is a summoned creature created through a one-ring spell, and its combat power is nearly zero.

Furthermore, the owl's summoning requires a full round of spellcasting, and the duration is short. As a result, the summoning spell is of little use, unless optimized specifically. Even Zhao Xu, who has summoned the owl, only uses it to explore the flying route. The owl spreads its snow-white wings and flies forward.

The divine being has built-in dark vision, unaffected by darkness, allowing it to see clearly in the dark. However, the owl only flies about 3 meters before suddenly being struck down by a bolt of lightning as thick as a bucket, which falls from the sky above. In an instant, the owl disappears without a trace.

Zhao Xu could only shrug his shoulders and say, "Three-ring spell, lightning bolt." The owl did not teleport away, but was instantly killed by the lightning bolt. As the summoned creature belongs to an energy projection, its corpse does not remain.
Even the miserable scream couldn't come out in time, it was faster than Zhao Xu's expectations. He had once used the lightning beam, a spell with damage power similar to the fireball spell, to clear a large number of mutated scorpions blocking the road in the underground nest.

"This is a no-fly zone." Vivian added.

Zhao Xu's face became slightly serious and he nodded. Not being able to fly was one thing, but he didn't know what other punishment rules there were.

"Then follow me, we'll walk diagonally and side by side, you look ahead and I'll look behind." Zhao Xu ordered.

"Okay." Vivian nodded seriously.

In a short while, Zhao Xu and Vivian had walked about 20 meters ahead, and they still couldn't see the other side with their torches.

"That's strange," Zhao Xu couldn't help but mutter to himself.

Suddenly, Vivian abruptly stopped and turned her body as if dancing, shielding Zhao Xu in front of her.

In front of them, a large and tall clay golem was swinging its arm heavily towards Zhao Xu.

Clay golem!
Magic immune!
