Chapter 359: Magical Upgrade

As they continued on the road, the carriage itself was in good condition, and the horses were moving steadily. Zhao Xu and his companions were sitting inside the carriage, and the cold wind and snow outside were blocked by the windows. Occasionally, the sound of horse hooves could be heard in the distance, following the cavalry.

As they approached the town of Shuang Lu, the carriage suddenly lurched to a stop. The sudden change caught everyone inside the carriage off guard, and they quickly grabbed their weapons in preparation for an emergency.

"What's going on?" Zhao Xu whispered urgently.

"There's a tree stump in front of us, and it looks like some wild wolves are circling around it," the coachman replied quietly. "But when we got closer, the wolves ran away, and the horses got startled too."

The coachman paused, looking uncertain. "It looks like there's a body tied to the tree stump, but it looks like a sheep's carcass."

"Let's go take a look," Zhao Xu said, sensing something was off.

Eliot turned his head, looking thoughtful. He didn't usually get involved in trivial matters, and this incident seemed suspicious. Just then, they heard a shout from outside.

Zheng Xin Yu, who had received pastor training, thought carefully. "It's unlikely that wolves would catch and tie up a sheep's carcass on the tree stump. And this place isn't mountainous terrain, it's strange to see a sheep's carcass here."

"What does it have to do with anything?" Eliot asked.

Zheng Xin Yu lowered her head, her eyes serious. "Some kind of sacrifice?"

At that moment, Betty, who was holding her child and didn't want to move, suddenly changed color.
Here is the translation of the text:

She directly touched the partition on the carriage and felt the coolness of her fingers, understanding that additional steel plating had been installed above. She gently put down the child she was holding in her arms, revealing a gentle expression, and then got down from the carriage together with everyone.

Immediately, she indicated to the knights who had just arrived that they should take a good look at the carriage. After her reorganization, in addition to the nine original bodyguards, she deliberately added three knights skilled in defense to accompany them. The other knights were assigned to other places.

After getting off the carriage, Zhao Xuan noticed that this temporary stop on the road was near a cemetery, where the residents of Frost and Dew Town would bury their relatives. After death, most people would choose to be buried in the earth, rather than cremated. However, the "Control of Corpses" spell, which had a reputation for being extremely powerful, allowed Zhao Xuan to directly convert the skeletons or corpses of the deceased into skeletons or zombies, and even accept his commands.

This was also the key spell for building an undead army. Zhao Xuan's "Summoning of High-Rank Undead" spell was actually only capable of creating powerful undead creatures. He could only control them by combining the fragments of divine artifacts with his staff.

Therefore, most people would consider the risk of their corpses being converted into undead creatures and choose to be buried in designated areas designated by the church.

At this time, Zhao Xuan walked in front of the already dismembered and devoured sheep corpse, observing it carefully. Soon, the others also approached and observed it together.
Here is the translation of the text:

Other cavalrymen were responsible for guarding the perimeter and protecting the carriage, while experienced bodyguards like Chuck, responsible for Mrs. Betty's safety, also approached and observed the scene.

Zhao Xu initially paid attention to this bearded warrior with a face full of stubble, but didn't seem too concerned.

"Can you see?" Zhao Xu asked, standing beside the decaying sheep carcass with flies buzzing around it.

Mrs. Betty saw this and felt dizzy, taking a moment to steady herself before quickly covering her mouth and nose with her sleeve.

Elliott, who had experienced great trauma, approached Zhao Xu without hesitation, even pulling out a glove and putting it on before examining the gaping wound on the sheep's body.

Zheng Xin had spent most of the past few days in the church, and this was the first time she saw such a bloody scene. Although she didn't feel like she was going to faint, her head was still a bit fuzzy.

After taking a deep breath, she also knelt down beside Zhao Xu to observe the scene.

Zhao Xu nodded silently in approval at their behavior.

As for the true nature of Arthur, players would feel uneasy when encountering corpses, especially human ones, for the first time. Even medical students would need to adjust to the psychological impact. Some players would hesitate when engaging in combat, only to be killed, and it's not uncommon.

"Looks like it's been injured twice," Elliott said after examining the different shapes of the wounds.

It just so happened that in his mentor's course, he had studied human anatomy and wasn't unfamiliar with it.

"It's correct," Zhao Xu confirmed.
Here is the translation of the text:

"It should be that someone tied this lamb to this stake." Elton pointed to the rough hemp rope tied around the lamb's neck, which was deliberately knotted to become tighter as it struggled. The other end of the rope was tied to a withered tree trunk about half a person's height.

"The deliberate knot indicates that it was not a temporary fix, but rather a deliberate plan to keep this lamb here and let it be slaughtered." Zhao Xu supplemented his analysis.

"So this lamb was immediately slaughtered and eaten, and we just saw the wolf pack leaving the lamb's corpse, which was actually the second time it was eaten." Zheng Xin'an also reacted, "Is it because of a sacrifice? So they chose to tie it around the graveyard?"

At this moment, she was fully awake and alert.

Even though she was just starting to play, she understood that Arthur's involvement in ritual sacrifices was never a trivial matter.

"Exactly the opposite," Zhao Xu stood up, his gaze sweeping over the gravestones inserted into the small mounds, and then moving further to the quiet valley in the distance.

"The cemetery itself is blessed by divine magic. It's like the 'Blessing of the Circle', which uses positive energy to bless a specific area, making it impossible for undead creatures to emerge, but it has a drawback of only lasting two hours and has a limited range."

"And the 'Five-Ring Holy Residence' also has the ability to solidify spells like 'Detection Magic', 'Assistance Spell', 'Undead-Repelling Barrier', and so on. It can also prevent undead creatures from emerging in a specific area, which is often found in the tombs of nobles."
Here is the translation of the text:

Considering the cost and area issues, most civilian cemeteries are similar in their rituals, but with the disadvantage that they may not be able to completely avoid transforming into immortal beings. However, the difficulty of transformation will increase significantly, and the coverage range will also be broad. Saying this, Zhao Xu turned around and looked at the others, "So, the other party doesn't want this lamb to be bitten to death in an unusual way, deliberately choosing a cemetery nearby. Otherwise, there are complete trees farther away, and it's harder for the lamb to break free."

Zhao Xu's analysis was met with nods of agreement from his teammates, while Mrs. Betty showed a stiff smile and nodded in agreement.

As Zhao Xu looked at this scene, he suddenly felt a sense of clarity.

Initially, he had used a subtle hint on Mrs. Betty to reduce her emotional backlash after hearing the term "old witch." Therefore, he had arranged for a "trigger" type of spell, which would only take effect when Mrs. Betty arrived in Frost Town. Even within the 12-hour spell duration, if they didn't arrive in Frost Town, this spell would directly become invalid.

As a result, Zhao Xu began to suspect the old witch's involvement.

"Captain, there's a dilapidated shack nearby, but we haven't searched it," the two riders who had been patrolling the area returned to report.

"Mrs. Betty, I'm afraid we need to go investigate. Your people can stay here and keep watch; just send a signal if there are any issues," Zhao Xu said calmly, though his expression was rather playful.

Mrs. Betty shook her head, saying, "No, let's go together. It's only proper for us to cooperate with the pastor and your actions."

"Then let's go together, Mrs. Betty," Zhao Xu said, needing critical information from the other party at a crucial moment, and directly inviting her.

No one in the group dared to question Zhao Xu's meddling.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

In reality, when a pastor discovers an event involving a sacrificial ritual, ignoring it is unbecoming of a true pastor.

Zhou Xu's behavior in this regard is considered absolutely reasonable, as this is no longer a simple case of a lamb being eaten.

"Let me lead the way, and you follow," Zhou Xu thought to himself before giving the order.

At this moment, he estimated the situation and realized that the distance to Shuang Lu Town was not far. He began to cast a spell on himself.

"Energy Shield!"

With a burst of brilliant light, the energy shield was activated, rendering Zhou Xu immune to the attribute damage caused by the "Super Magic Control" ability.

However, he didn't continue to cast the spell immediately. He needed to wait for a crucial skill to arrive.

He silently gazed at his character card.

When he leveled up to 6th grade, he obtained a bonus skill that was a multiple of 3. This allowed him to obtain a skill reward.

His previous 5th-grade wizard skill was "Spell Endurance" and "Steel Will", which he exchanged for "Instant Spellcasting".

This time, at 6th grade, he directly chose the lowest-difficulty skill that almost everyone could master, but at a tremendous cost - "Spell Upgrade".

After reading the skill manual on the carriage, he combined it with his previous simulation of the skill's characteristics.

As expected, Zhou Xu received a prompt in his mind before arriving at Shuang Lu Town.

【"Adventure Seeker Zhong Xia, you have obtained the 'Spell Upgrade' skill (6th-grade character skill)".】
