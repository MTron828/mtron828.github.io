Chapter 311: Intelligence Surveillance

"What if the rabbit isn't white?" someone had trouble understanding.

In reality, Zhao Xu, who had no outdoor experience, initially thought that rabbits were white by nature. It wasn't until they started hunting for food on their journey that they realized that pure white rabbits couldn't survive in the wild because they were too eye-catching.

The rabbits that Zhao Xu and others had seen on Earth were mostly white because they were domesticated rabbits.

After Zhao Xu explained this, a deep chill ran through everyone's hearts. The people in the valley where they were staying, where the average level was around 5, were not qualified to live there. Moreover, there would be no ordinary civilian settlements, let alone domesticated rabbits.

If Zhao Xu hadn't had the "True Knowledge Art" that allowed him to see through transformations and illusions, he would have thought that the rabbit was a disguised enemy.

Sword Frost immediately arranged for the team's scouts to carry warning flares and search for clues nearby. If they found anything suspicious, they would return and release the flares. Meanwhile, Zhao Xu and the others were observing the calm lake in front of them.

At this time, the lake's surface was peaceful, with only occasional ripples caused by gentle breezes. "Mr. Wind, is there a spell that can allow us to observe the conditions at the bottom of the lake?" Sword Frost had been confident in his ability to explore underwater. However, after encountering the artificially bred white rabbit and the previous ambush by the giant demon and goblin teams, his mind had been shrouded in a deep shadow.
Here is the translation:

Even he suspected that there might be a trap waiting for them at the bottom of the lake.

"The water flow's visual range can explore the specific aquatic life in the water," he said.

Zhao Xu then fell silent, unable to reveal the spell any further at the moment.

"The mage is indeed powerful, although it's only achievable with a five-ring mastery. However, I've found that most requirements have corresponding spells that can solve the issue," Frost Sword remarked.

Zhao Xu smiled, actually able to unleash the "Mystic Eye" and "Divine Eye" spells if he had a five-ring mastery, creating a "Mystic Eye" that could observe and then dispatch it to scout the surroundings.

If Zhao Xu could unleash the "Water Flow Vision" spell, he would definitely release it without hesitation.

The Guardian's Guild initially had no idea that there was a "mind-reader" observing them, and it was possible that they had exposed their target in Mistral.

Because Frost Sword had searched the city for the "Breath of Water" scroll, it was easy to deduce that they needed to find the Mage Tower underwater, and the destination was naturally the lake.

So, when a sudden biological phenomenon emerged from the bottom of the lake, Zhao Xu was not surprised.

"Brother, no signs of danger within a hundred meters," Snowy reported to Frost Sword as he walked over with another female hunter.

One of the swimmers who had finished his swimming skills also returned with no issues. At this point, only the wanderer who went to scout further away had not returned.

Frost Sword nodded slightly, saying, "Mr. Crazy Wind, shall we confirm the details before entering the water?"

The mage Chen Nu and the surrounding high-ranking members of the guild did not express any disagreement and listened intently.
After listening to Zhao Xu, he looked somewhat worried. Although Snowblade was cautious and had been influenced by the magic of Mystere, he still didn't have the awareness of forming a defense against magical eavesdropping. He thought that as long as there were no others around, it was safe.

It was no wonder that they got the address of the wizard's tower and that it leaked out.

Zhao Xu thought for a moment and then said, "Snowblade, have you thought about the possibility that we are being monitored in this area?"

Everyone's expression changed suddenly, and they looked around nervously. Zhao Xu's gaze didn't fall on his companions, and he even smiled slightly. He had to write a "Precautionary Guide" for the players, which was too extreme for wizards.

"One possibility is that someone has cast a 'transformation spell' to knock out our companions and then take their place," Zhao Xu said.

"Another possibility is that the opponent has chosen to be 'invisible' and hide here."

As soon as Zhao Xu finished speaking, everyone looked suspiciously at their companions, as if they thought Zhao Xu had already discovered something. Zhao Xu had the "True Knowledge" and had confirmed everyone's appearance, so he knew there was no fake. However, he didn't intend to say anything, preferring to let everyone have a sense of vigilance. Because after he went in, no one on the lake surface would have the effect of True Knowledge, and everyone would have to guess.
Here is the translation of the text:

As soon as he lightly tapped the interface of his invisible ring, his entire body suddenly vanished like a special effect, disappearing from view in front of everyone.

It turned out that "Invisibility" was a renowned second-grade spell, and everyone was not surprised, but rather realized that they had been careless at the beginning.

Zhao Xu immediately cancelled the invisibility effect and reappeared in front of everyone.

"Crazy Wind, you could have told us beforehand, no need to waste spell slots," Sheng Jian said with a hint of annoyance.

"This is an automatic activation, derived from the invisible ring on my middle finger," Zhao Xu said calmly.

At this point, everyone finally realized that Zhao Xu had not chanted a spell to become invisible, but rather used a magical item to do so.

"Crazy Wind, how much is this ring worth in gold coins?" the Wanderer asked, his eyes widening in surprise as he gazed at Zhao Xu's palm, as if a woman was gazing at a dazzling diamond ring.

"Twenty thousand gold coins," Zhao Xu said awkwardly.

Zhao Xu's words almost made everyone in the scene gasp in shock.

"This is enough to buy ten magical weapons!" Sheng Jian exclaimed.

All the ordinary equipment on the forty people present, including expensive armor, did not add up to the value of Zhao Xu's ring.

Originally, the Wanderer had been thinking of getting an invisible ring to greatly improve his stealth abilities, but when he heard the price, his eyes almost popped out.

Although he was the main force in this operation, he couldn't possibly get an invisible ring from the Mage Tower.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu noticed that everyone's attention had wandered off, and he quickly changed the subject, saying, "The third possibility is that of surveillance magic. Who knows, maybe everything we're saying now has already been known to others."

Zhao Xu had once used the "interrogation coin" of the "Spy Master" to create a coin that would trigger excitement, using the "Alarm Circle" to notify him when someone approached, and then activating the coin.

After mastering the three-ring magic, he could deploy the "sharp ear" or "eagle eye" spell at a distance, setting up a magical sensing field to monitor and listen in.

Later, he also learned the three-ring poetry magic "Surveillance Coin" and the five-ring "Perception" spell, which allowed for remote exploration.

Suddenly, a flash of inspiration struck Zhao Xu's mind, illuminating all his thoughts.

To himself, he thought: "It's really dark under the lamp."

As he spoke, he walked over to the rabbit that was already suspended from its legs.

Just then, he looked at the rabbit with his "True Knowledge" spell, but was distracted by the fact that the rabbit was not a wild one, and forgot something else.

At this moment, everyone was watching Zhao Xu, looking at the rabbit, and knew that something was amiss. They all widened their eyes, scrutinizing his actions.

Zhao Xu, on the other hand, directly deployed the zero-ring "Detection Magic", and suddenly, the rabbit's body began to glow with a magical aura, but the effect only lasted for a brief moment before disappearing.

Zhao Xu thought to himself: "As expected, but unfortunately, the spell will still leave a residual glow for 1-6 rounds after it ends, which also gave him a last chance to grab hold of something."

"There is a two-ring magic called 'Shared Body' from the Druid, which allows the caster to gain the sensory observations of the animal they touch, seeing through its eyes and hearing through its ears."
Here is the translation of the text into English:

All eyes were suddenly focused on the white rabbit that Zhao Xu was holding at that moment.

"Just, isn't the other party choosing the white rabbit to jump into the net by themselves?" Cui Lu, the poet, asked in astonishment.

"No, it's to let this rabbit be caught by us, so that it can hear our conversation up close," Zhao Xu said, looking at the rabbit's bright red eyes with a calm tone.

"Because ordinary wild rabbits dare not venture into the range of adventurers and might be killed and eaten on the spot. Only this strange white rabbit is willing to be spared and can stay to listen."

"But isn't this a bit forced?" the poet asked.

Zhao Xu shook his head, "This spell is a minute-long duration spell, so the other party is trying to get as much value out of it as possible. And since they're doing this, they might also have other methods nearby."

Everyone was silenced by this scene, while Zhao Xu raised an eyebrow and began to respond to the dimensional law battle.

"Shall we communicate in Earth's language? This way, the other party won't be able to figure it out," Ji Xue suggested.

"What about the Crazy Wind Master?" the thief frowned and said, "He won't understand Earth's language."

"Can't we use the Zero-Ring Communication Spell?" the mage standing in the corner exclaimed, "This spell allows the caster to whisper to the target creature without being heard by others. Then Chen Nu can cast the spell and directly communicate with the Crazy Wind Master."

However, Chen Nu shook his head directly, "The Zero-Ring Communication Spell only makes the sound inaudible, but the target can still read lips if they see us. If the other party can see us, they can decipher what we're saying."
After hearing this, Zhao Xu couldn't help but smile. It turned out that his magical skill, which was known as the three-ring magical formula, was not well understood by many. "The three-ring magical formula is a skill that allows the caster to understand and speak any language, including your Earth language," Zhao Xu corrected the initial mistake.

However, Chen Nu quickly intervened, saying, "Even the one-ring magical formula can make people understand the literal meaning of written words." Suddenly, everyone fell silent, implying that even without communicating with the Crazy Wind Mage, their internal communication would still be exposed.

Zhao Xu was aware that if they converted their spoken words into Pinyin and mixed in some English phrases, it was possible that the enemy might not be able to decipher it. However, these words could not come from the mouth of the "pretended" Arthur Mage.

Just then, Zhao Xu took out a copper wire from his backpack and began to chant a spell. The copper wire felt the magical energy and started making a humming noise. "What kind of magic is this?" Shuang Jian wondered. However, he was soon stunned, covering his mouth in disbelief. Even the members of the Guardian's Guild were astonished, looking at Shuang Jian in surprise.

Because Shuang Jian had not spoken a word. However, his voice was clearly transmitted to everyone's heart.
