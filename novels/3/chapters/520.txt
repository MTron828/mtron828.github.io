Chapter 521: Dreamlike Ritual, Shortwave Signal

In reality, no matter how the audience had just been fooled, they still couldn't have imagined that just one "sub-secondary strong acid ball" would deal 80 points of full-damage harm.
The three-ring fireball technique was only half as effective, and even more would be dodged by half.
To say the least, the entire process was a bit unexpected for Zhao Xu.
Compared to these sorcerers who increased their vitality adjustment by 1-4, the undead bloodsuckers, without vitality adjustment, increased their vitality by 1-12 points (D12) per level.
However, the opponent was still too weak and couldn't withstand Zhao Xu's 80-point damage test.
With a single " spell mastery" he could turn the "sub-secondary strong acid ball" damage into 40 points, and combined with "spell duplication", it would be 80 points.
Generally, most players can't withstand Zhao Xu's 80-point damage "sub-secondary ball".
Not to mention the various elemental attacks, such as sound waves, fire, and cold, in this series of spells.
Furthermore, Zhao Xu could also cast the four-ring "strong acid ball", which would deal 15D6 damage and have a nausea effect.
After accounting for Zhao Xu's extraordinary magical expertise, the direct damage would be 180 points, without any discount.
However, the only price to pay was that Zhao Xu would have to pay a temporary attribute damage cost of 6 points due to his "extraordinary magical control" ability.
Here is the translation:

Zhou Xu's current attributes add up to 115 points, and even without using the "Energy Shield" spell to resist attribute damage, the problem isn't major. After returning to his room, Zhou Xu had Wei Wei prepare a temporary defensive spell for himself.

He then reconnected to the legendary library of Floating Sky City and searched for the "Dream Ritual" with the help of the mysterious flower. He spent hours searching until nearly 3 am, and after completing the search, Zhou Xu successfully obtained the data he needed and logged off.

After regaining consciousness, Zhou Xu woke up on his familiar and soft bed. He had a recurring thought about the ritual he had seen in the legendary library.

Zhou Xu tried to connect to the innermost treasure, "Lakis", but there was no response, just like before. This meant that he would have to rely on himself from now on.

Throughout history, the "Divine Revelation" method has included a effective and safe way of using dreams. This method not only provides spatial isolation for the revealer but also allows them to transcend spatial distances.

Even the most stubborn person would eventually succumb to the repetitive dream content and the subconscious influence, causing their thoughts and vigilance to decrease significantly.

In the world of Arther, Zhou Xu had actually mastered the art of invading dreams - the four-ring "Dream Wandering" spell, which is similar to the "Interdimensional Transmission" spell, allowing the caster to send someone into someone else's dream.

There is even the five-ring "Dream Puppetry" spell, which allows the caster to control someone's body in their dream state, similar to the "Monster Domination" spell. However, since the Earth and Arther are in different universes, Zhou Xu was unable to use the four-ring spell to connect to the material energy channel.
Here is the translation of the text:

If the opponent is sleeping in "Arthas" and doesn't have any spiritual protection, even if he can succeed, Zheng Xin'an will only think that it's just a game content. It might be interesting, but he won't take it seriously.

So he needs to use the "dream invasion" method in "Earth". Zhao Xu is unable to use magic, but Arthas has another method - ritual. This is also a method that Zhao Xu found in the library.

After understanding the ritual, he quietly walked to the storage room next to the living room, flashlight in hand, and searched for the items he needed.

Candle, paper, red oily pen, essential oil of incense, and mirror...

The essence of a ritual is similar to magic, but it's different in that it can be performed by non-magicians.

To perform a ritual, it's like cooking a dish. Zhao Xu first found the recipe (ritual content), then prepared the materials (ritual ingredients), and then processed them through "processing" (setting up the ritual). By combining it with "cooking" (incantation gestures), he can perform it.

After preparing the ritual and materials, Zhao Xu returned to his room and locked it. However, he chose a location that was not his usual spot.

At this time, it took over an hour for the sun to rise, and the moon was about to be eclipsed. Only at this moment, when the moonlight was cool and smooth, flowing like water, and illuminating his face, was the best time.

Zhao Xu took a deep breath and began to quietly set up the paper on the balcony.
Here is the translation of the text:

Just like the ritual of "transferring to the Garden of Joseph" by Hrolosa's journey, which requires building a grass hut in the forest and is only effective during the winter solstice. Similarly, Zhao Xu's "dream ritual" can only be performed during the nearly full moon period around the Lantern Festival. If he delays it by a few days, he will not meet the conditions for the ritual.

Zhao Xu, with his 12th-level mental focus, relies on his powerful intelligence to clearly remember the entire process of the ritual, which is also the prerequisite for him to perform the "dream ritual" with confidence.

The setup and performance of the ritual are both complex, and even a small mistake can lead to a failure of the ritual, which may have unpredictable consequences.

The key factor determining the success of the ritual is the mysterious knowledge level, which Zhao Xu has been diligently studying and upgrading. Moreover, Anniya, who had previously visited this place, left behind a "protection" for the house.

At the same time, Zhao Xu's target for the ritual is Zheng Xin, and he knows every detail about him. Additionally, he has acquired an indirect "disciple" role.

After completing the final version of the ritual, Zhao Xu maintains a mysterious breathing frequency according to the requirements of the ritual. Meanwhile, he lights the central candle.

As the city's power outage becomes more frequent, the candle's light slowly disappears from people's eyes. At this moment, the flame floats above the candle, and Zhao Xu's low-pitched incantation and repeated hand gestures begin to perform a seal. The flame also accelerates its jumping, as if it was affected by the wind.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu sang for nearly ten minutes, and throughout the process, there was no extraordinary phenomenon. Only Zhao Xu knew what stage he had reached. Suddenly, he applied a small amount of menthol oil to his forehead, drew a talismanic circle, and then gently raised his head. The icy sensation gradually seeped into his skin, and after half a minute, it dissipated. Zhao Xu then picked up a golden pendant that his father had purchased at a high price and placed it on the candle flame. He then gently dropped the incense ash. At the same time, he placed the golden plate, which he had flattened into a thin sheet using iron tongs, on top of the candle flame. The shape of the Snubian figure on the plate had already lost its form.

Suddenly, Zhao Xu felt a surge of mysterious power rising from within his body. In an instant, the golden plate, which would normally only be stained black by the candle flame, miraculously melted away. The gold that could not be melted at a thousand degrees Celsius suddenly melted before Zhao Xu's eyes and then disappeared. Burning money was also a characteristic of the ritual.

However, Zhao Xu clenched his teeth and continued to silently recite the mysterious incantation that he had been reciting without interruption. In an instant, the candle that could have burned for half an hour suddenly burned out. Zhao Xu slowly fell back, losing consciousness.

... ... ... ... ... 

"What's going on?" a man who couldn't sleep was suddenly startled by a strange signal while tuning into a shortwave radio in the middle of the night. He had just taken a glance at the frequency of around 5,000 Hz and was about to record it when the sound suddenly disappeared.
Here is the translation:

"This should be an international frequency, and yet the power is so strong, with not even a hint of noise, and I can even receive it here. "

The man thought quietly to himself, but after listening for a while, he put down the earphones without finding anything. Just then, the radio inside was broadcasting a faint, almost imperceptible, low-pitched sound that seemed to be calling out someone's name.
