Chapter 129: Promotion Requirements

The next day, Zhao Xu logged back into the game and found himself in his dormitory. After he returned to the 7th floor and found An Ti Nu Ya, he realized that his logout method in the divine artifact space had failed completely - his physical body had remained there.

Zhao Xu had originally planned to be polite and express his gratitude to An Ti Nu Ya, considering that she had carried him back to his dormitory, which was not an easy task. However, An Ti Nu Ya simply replied that she was too lazy to move, let alone carry him again.

As a result, Zhao Xu was left wondering who had moved his physical body to the dormitory of the Octagonal Pavilion.

When An Ti Nu Ya finally saw that Zhao Xu had completed all the first-level spells, she seemed slightly satisfied with him.

At this point, Zhao Xu's only remaining task was to master the Dark Arts (Tactics). After that, he would become a Scroll Scholar.

This process seemed like building with blocks, making it hard for Zhao Xu to believe.

However, as a master of both occult and divine arts, Zhao Xu had some foundation in magic theory, at least he didn't need to start from scratch with spellcasting.

This was the reason why many players could level up quickly in the game. Without this, it would be impossible for a warrior to reach level 10 in just a year.

As for Zhao Xu, who had mastered both occult and divine arts, he was even more exceptional.

After hearing the description of the Dark Arts (Tactics), Zhao Xu was puzzled.

The Dark Arts were a series of abilities, a type of ability aimed at monsters, with the first ability - Tactics - usable three times a day.
Here is the translation of the text:

This ability doesn't require him to do anything, it just needs him to conduct a knowledge verification once and he can obtain an advantage against the corresponding monster.

As people say, knowledge is power, and in Aria, knowledge and skills can also be used to defeat monsters.

However, using this ability is quite complex, such as when facing magical beasts, he needs to use his knowledge (mysterious) skill to activate it. When facing undead creatures, he needs to use his knowledge (religious) to activate it.

But after Zhao Xu finished reading the introduction, he found there was no awakening method?

After thinking for nearly half an hour, Zhao Xu couldn't help but ask An Ti Noya for guidance.

An Ti Noya, who was a dual elite, couldn't help but question Zhao Xu, "Do you know?" "Actually, no one knows who the first Scroll Scholar was. Just like no one knows who the first warrior was."

The first mage doesn't need to be mentioned, it's just the first magic goddess.

But what does this have to do with awakening as a Scroll Scholar?

Suddenly, Zhao Xu caught a thread.

When he went to the Floating Sky City, that black-robed mage said that another girl was also a Scroll Scholar, sitting on another teleportation portal.

Doesn't this mean that Scroll Scholars may have a cultivation site?

But it's because he has An Ti Noya, so he doesn't need to take courses from those small classes.

An Ti Noya never hides anything from him.

This can only be attributed to one reason.
Here is the translation of the text:

"The mentor, does that mean that all scholars of the ancient tome rely on their abilities to describe and understand it on their own?"

"It's not entirely wrong," Anzhiya said, sitting at her desk, flipping through a book, as if reading was the only thing she loved to do. No, wasting magic should also be considered one of her hobbies.

Just as Zhao Xu was thinking about this, he felt a headache coming on. Originally, he thought that the difficulty of the ancient tome was similar to that of a mage, getting stuck at the stage of copying spells.

From Li Tian Ge to countless mage apprentices online, and even to the ID owners of "Is it easy to be a mage today?", everyone was struggling to copy spells with that kind of spiritual resonance.

But the ancient tome was exactly the opposite, getting stuck at the stage of grasping abilities. This was definitely strange.

Especially when considering that the strongest aspect of ancient tome scholars is the comprehensive knowledge of all spells, it only added to Zhao Xu's confusion.

Suddenly, Zhao Xu stood up directly.

"Mentor, I'm going to the library to learn."

The dark knowledge (tactics) of ancient tome scholars corresponds to magical beasts, underground cities, religious beliefs, and elemental forces. Maybe his answer is in these areas of knowledge.

If you don't understand, just look it up. This phrase hasn't deceived anyone yet.

As Zhao Xu disappeared into the distance, Anzhiya, with her hat pulled over her face, hummed a familiar tune.

...

For three consecutive days, Zhao Xu used up all his skill points in the knowledge field, upgrading his skills several times, but still received no hint about the dark knowledge.

This was reasonable, after all.
Here is the translation of the text:

If one could easily awaken special abilities, there would probably be many people with such abilities on the streets. Therefore, like specialized skills or professional abilities, various complex procedures and rituals are required. Not even magic practitioners who emphasize learning need to go through an awakening ritual, let alone those who acquire specialized skills beforehand.

Zhao Xu took a deep breath and quietly closed the book "Uncommon, Farewell" in his hand. In the morning, he had deliberately gone to borrow the book "Monster Compendium" from An Ti Noya again, and had highlighted five types of monsters to read carefully, but unfortunately, it was of no use. So in the afternoon, he went to the Archeological Museum of Monsters to supplement his knowledge of these five types of monsters, but still gained nothing.

Zhao Xu felt that the abilities of the manuscript scholar could be connected to these monsters, and that there must be a deep connection.

The Archeological Museum of Monsters is generally a favorite spot for wizards who like to venture into battles and adventurers who seek information. Even those who study the core four transformations of magic are often here.

Zhao Xu was about to become dazed and confused, but still found no key to awakening the manuscript scholar.

"Ah, Summer Little Brother, it's been a long time since we last met," suddenly a familiar voice echoed behind Zhao Xu.

Zhao Xu turned his head to look, and it was the chubby Xue Qi, a wizard he had met at a transformation lecture.

Xue Qi was holding a book in his hand, using his chubby hand to cover half of the cover, but Zhao Xu could still recognize the devil from his eyes.

Thinking of this, Zhao Xu felt uneasy and moved the chair slightly away from the other, keeping a safe distance.

"Ha ha, Little Brother, have you also started studying transformation recently?"
Here is the translation of the text:

Lin Qi sat down next to Zhao Xu, waiting until his stomach settled before continuing to say, "Do you have any troubles?"

Zhao Xu looked at Lin Qi, who was a bit overweight, and thought that his opponent might have some ideas. He then asked, "Do you know how to detect the weaknesses of monsters?"

"What weaknesses?" Lin Qi replied.

"It seems I've heard of it," Lin Qi said, suddenly falling into thought.

"Oh, I remember now," Lin Qi said, standing up and running to the end of a row of bookshelves.

After five whole minutes, Zhao Xu was about to look for another book when Lin Qi reappeared, placing a thick book on his desk.

Zhao Xu saw that the book was covered in dust and had Lin Qi's fingerprints on it. He felt a sense of gratitude and didn't know how many things Lin Qi had searched through to find the book.

He thanked Lin Qi, saying, "Thanks for helping me find this book."

"No, it's right behind you, about three or four meters away," Lin Qi said, patting his stomach.

"..."

Zhao Xu, who was feeling a bit tired from the conversation, decided to stick to reading the classics.

He opened the book that Lin Qi had given him and found that it was actually a religious text called "Knowledge and Spiritual Power, the Virtuous Path."

The book described abilities that were similar to the dark knowledge of a scholar of the occult arts, but with a smaller scope. It described a type of ability that allows one to give up a field and specialize in another.

There are many books in this series, and this one is specifically about giving up knowledge and specializing in "knowledge virtue."
Here is the translation of the text:

When facing monsters, he can also obtain rewards in terms of attack and damage.
It's as if he can more accurately detect his opponent's weaknesses.
It's similar to his black magic, but not exactly the same.

Thinking about this, Zhao Xu also couldn't help but thank Fat Lin Qi for his kindness, and then lightly closed the book.

"You're not after this ability, are you?" Fat Lin Qi asked.

"It's a good ability, but I'll have the chance to research it further later," Zhao Xu said, this time not being too verbose.

"That's definitely it, this book can appear here for everyone to read because you couldn't pass the test."

Zhao Xu heard these words and suddenly laughed, and what he had been stuck on was not the priest, but everyone else.

"Heh heh, I said you shouldn't doubt it, the virtuous series is your specialty, you can't grasp it without being virtuous to a certain extent, like my cousin, she really wants this ability, but—"

Fat Lin Qi suddenly felt that the Zhao Xu in front of him seemed to shine a little brighter, but all the magic on his body was telling him that this was just an illusion, nothing had really happened.

Thinking about this, Fat Lin Qi turned his head and put his attention back on the female mages who rarely appeared in the library.

Meanwhile, Zhao Xu was slightly astonished as he looked at his prompt.

【Adventurer Zhong Xia, will you awaken the "Knowledge Virtue" ability by sacrificing your "Knowledge Domain" as a trade-off?】
It's as if he's being favored without fear.

When will his black magic ability be able to rest quietly in his skill bar like this?

Zhao Xu sighed and didn't bother to choose, and then walked back.
Here is the translation:

Originally, he had intended to return to his own room, but for some reason, he ended up at Anniya's office. Anniya looked at Zhao Xu, who had been troubled for several days, and realized that he was starting to doubt himself.

"Why not awaken, and then change your profession and continue to improve as a priest? You're not one who's favored by the goddess, are you?"

Since the physical transformation, Zhao Xu had lost many of his carefree thoughts.

He looked at Anniya and said, "I'm indeed feeling a bit hopeless."

Although it had only been three days, Zhao Xu was clear that he had gone through longer periods of time in the past. However, he was completely at a loss for three days.

Time won't make one hopeless, it's the lack of achievement that does.

"However, life is inherently climbing on the road of despair."

Zhao Xu silently added a sentence from his past mindset.

"That's something to remember," Anniya suddenly smiled lightly.

"What—"

Zhao Xu hadn't even finished speaking when a stone tablet appeared in front of him, accompanied by a hint.
