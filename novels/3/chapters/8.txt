Chapter 9: The Elite Route

The number of players who logged in today is not the peak of the game. The true peak will come in half a year, when the topic will become more popular and players will achieve new milestones in the game, which will make it to the hot search list on social media. By then, players will be able to view various game data details in the game, including character cards. However, players will not be able to use remote chat tools or search engines during gameplay. Therefore, if players encounter any special questions, they will have to rely on their own knowledge and skills to search for answers.

In fact, some guilds are still using the old method of communicating by logging off and logging back on, even though it takes a long time. Many players who are new to the game are confused and have no idea where to go for training. Some players don't even ask for directions and haven't found a specific training location after two days.

Zhao Xu is likely the first player in the game to understand the meaning of the map marks on the paper map and how to get to them. As a beginner, Zhao Xu first chose to go to the Guild of Mages in the city of Mistral, which is the headquarters of the Guild of Mages. The Guild of Mages is not the only one in the game. The one in Mistral is the largest and has the most mages, with branches in every city on the continent. The influence of other mage organizations is negligible, with the exception of the Red Robe Mages, who have a guild that is limited to a single country.
Here is the translation of the text:

At the threshold of the law, where the law wizards are located, it is natural for them not to require any prefix. The law wizards, referring to the wizard association, is none other than the wizard association of Misterla.

After Zhao Xu submitted the materials at the reception hall of the threshold of the law, the apprentices responsible for receiving guests used their magical skills to identify the key to the recommendation letter and confirmed it without any doubt.

It's not that there aren't players who dare to use "fabricated documents" to deceive the wizard association headquarters, but the fastest players in the current player group are still not proficient in these skills, let alone using their low-level skills to deceive others.

For Arthur's indigenous people, these players are not just randomly fallen from the sky, nor will they say that all NPCs have been brainwashed to believe they are Arthur's indigenous people.

In reality, the players later discovered that the entire world is logically coherent.

These Arthur's indigenous people have known from the promotion of the temple in previous years that they are projections from another world, which is the Earth.

For Arthur's indigenous people, or the vast majority of adventurers, the other world is not unfamiliar. In fact, the domains of the gods are all considered other worlds.

Law wizards often summon other-worldly beings and project them to participate in battles on the main plane of Arthur.

The players who went online and offline due to their unique characteristics and the five resurrection stones, which are more than the indigenous people of Arthur, are also considered another projection.

At most, they will not be blocked or dispelled by the anti-magic field.

Zhao Xu also heard that top-level wizards will not personally go on an adventure. Most of them will directly dispatch projections with the same strength as themselves.
Here is the translation of the text:

One year later, all Earthlings have become native inhabitants of Arthur's homeland, transforming from projections to real people.

Zhao Xu waited in the hall for less than half a minute before a black-robed wizard came out and led him to the inner part of the Ophir Gate.

He warned Zhao Xu not to run wild and trigger traps again, and to remain silent throughout the entire process.

All the people who had passed through the Ophir Gate were silent, rushing to and fro.

Less than 10 minutes later, the wizard led Zhao Xu into a vast hall.

He pointed to the glowing door in front of him and said, "This door is for apprentice wizards like you, don't think too much, just walk straight ahead."

"What's a teleportation gate?" Zhao Xu looked at the 3-meter-high glowing door in wonder.

He had not expected that the training location of these people would not be on the surface of Mistral, but would pass through this teleportation gate instead?

The teleportation gate, excluding size limitations, can only point to one location, with the exception of a few special cases. Players can pass through it in 6 seconds, reaching their destination without any assistance or spell activation.

The one-key destination gate, priced at 100,000 gold coins, has long been the dream of countless adventurers, as the outdoors is too dangerous.

Players can log off without risk of death for 5 minutes, eliminating the need for outdoor accommodation.

However, novice players' revival stones are mostly consumed by unexpected outdoor events.

Even native inhabitants of Arthur's homeland do not need to rashly leave the city and venture into the wilderness.

"You've seen it before?" The black-robed wizard looked up at Zhao Xu for a moment, his hooded face expression ambiguous.
Here is the translation of the text:

He finally reacted, and his opponent might not be those clueless novice mages guarding the gate outside.

Most mages here are aware that they are from Earth, "adventurers".

Logically, players who have just started playing Arthur would only know a limited amount.

However, Zhao Xu was clear that his best approach was not to explain, but to continue asking.

"What's above?"

As he spoke, Zhao Xu pointed upwards, although there was no actual ceiling above them, but it was implied.

"The reaction is indeed swift."

The black-robed mage gazed deeply at Zhao Xu.

However, Zhao Xu noticed that the other's gaze had fallen squarely on the two badges on his chest.

"It's indeed interesting. No wonder I brought you here."

The black-robed mage said something that left Zhao Xu scratching his head.

"What do you mean?"

Zhao Xu's keen sense of intuition told him that he might have just triggered a critical point.

In Arthur, the native inhabitants are all living beings, so there's no situation where they only talk to you when you trigger a quest.

Generally, high-level mages are relatively cold and won't waste their time on novice players like these 1-star mages.

Even Zhao Xu, who was studying at the highest-level mage academy, was like that.

The mage's somewhat murky eyes locked onto Zhao Xu's.

Zhao Xu felt a moment of disorientation, as if he was staring at an elderly sage.

Despite this, the mage's skin did not appear old.

However, this did not stop Zhao Xu from slightly lowering his head.

He wasn't like other players, who came and went without a care, thinking they could always delete their account and come back or just quit playing the game.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

"All Earthlings have to eat and live in Arthur, and it's not a suicidal behavior to be so arrogant."

"If I were you, I would first put away the cleric badge. It can reduce your attention to some extent."

The cleric suggested an idea without hesitation.

"How about it, isn't it allowed for players to participate in two professions at the same time?"

Zhao Xu asked quickly, even though players didn't know they could do this, but he knew it, and he was absolutely certain.

Some players like him, when they were left with a few profession tokens, would release multiple badges for players to participate in training.

Others would have to choose which badge to represent the association to train.

But he, being a dual-intelligent, could take them all.

The black-robed cleric didn't respond directly, instead whispering, "Just ten minutes ago, there was a female player who, like you, had two badges, but she was sent to the adjacent teleportation gate."

After a year had passed in reality, Zhao Xu's intelligence value had not taken effect on his character panel yet.

He was still relying on his original intelligence to decipher the meaning behind the opponent's words.

Zhao Xu had completely calmed down, thinking about whether there was a hidden task or some underlying mechanism.

The opponent's words indicated that he should, like the female player, go to the adjacent teleportation gate?

To train at the wizard academy, he would have to build two gates, not one.

The wizard association didn't burn money like this; they built two adjacent halls leading to the same place.

In other words, they led to different places.

If it were in another city, they might add another teleportation gate to send top students to Mistral.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

But the door of Ofa's Gate has already reached the top level of the wizard academy, with legendary wizards among the instructors. Is it really necessary to strive for even higher levels? Is it not ridiculous to send oneself to the goddess's side?

The priest training in the next-door temple also doesn't need to bother with this. Suddenly, Zhao Xu realized that he had brought two proof badges intentionally to show off to the people at Ofa's Gate and to invest in his own potential.

Emotions had actually emerged with a little difference.

Perhaps it's not necessary to wear them, and it's like this from the moment he stepped into the headquarters' main entrance.

But what's the connection between the two teleportation gates?

Suddenly, Zhao Xu had a reaction in his mind.

Hidden foundation profession!

Those who wear two badges can take up professions outside of wizard and priest, including hidden foundation professions.

However, which of the two gates is the entrance to the hidden foundation profession?

Zhao Xu was about to ask the other person to confirm when he saw the other person's gaze and stopped.

The answer is self-evident.

If it's a hidden profession, it won't be said before entering the teleportation gate.

The next-door gate is the entrance to the hidden profession.

The question is: why do you wear two badges, and I take this wizard path?

"You seem to have thought of it?"

The wizard is respected, after all, it's the foundation profession of this continent.

"Think about what you have that's special?"

Zhao Xu lowered his head and thought for a moment. What's special about himself?

Although his intelligence is 16, there are many with 17 and 18 intelligence points ahead of him.

Double elite!

Zhao Xu suddenly realized that it was only natural that the other person couldn't see through it.
Here is the translation of the text:

"They're not ignoring various mind-control magic spells, are they? The mage suddenly looked up, gazing into the distance as if he could see through the portal.

"Don't worry, these adventurers from Earth are immune to many special effects. And I'll give you a phrase: besides magic, wisdom and knowledge are also abilities." Zhao Xu understood what this meant, and if NPCs could directly read players' minds or do even more extreme things, it would cause chaos.

So this immunity is actually the gods' protection for the player group, effective for a year. This is also protection for Zhao Xu. Otherwise, he would be embarrassed in front of those legendary figures if he didn't have this protection.

Is the opponent's operation relying on wisdom and strategy? Zhao Xu almost slapped his forehead, forgetting that he had the "Observe and React" skill. His expression was too straightforward, and he could only wait until he raised his "Deception" skill to counter.

Zhao Xu understood and nodded, then walked towards the light portal. Just as he was about to step in, he suddenly stopped and asked:

"After completing my 1st-level mage training, I'll go to the adjacent portal?"

He didn't say he was a dual-specialized player, but he believed the other side understood.

He wouldn't think he would become a 1st-level mage and then join a hidden profession at 2nd level.

"Not."

"Your mage path will continue to unfold."

"However, your other path is to become a 1st-level priest and then a scroll scholar."

Occupation line 1: 2nd-level mage
Occupation line 2: 1st-level priest/1st-level scroll scholar."
Here is the translation:

Zhao Xu's mind suddenly flashed with the route the other person had mentioned, and he heard the name of the hidden basic profession.

He suddenly turned around and asked, "Why?"

"This is the will of the goddess," he said.
