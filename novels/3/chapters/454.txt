Chapter 455: The Legacy of the Nine Swords

As soon as he saw the invitation, Zhao Xu seemed to see an opportunity that countless people had spent their entire lives striving for. He pushed it forward as if it were nothing.

After hearing about the "Anti-Demon Zone" explosion area in the Back Forest, Zhao Xu knew that even if he was "strong", he would still be at risk of being killed by the opponent's "Anti-Demon Zone" if he faced a five-ring pastor and a six-ring wizard.

Under the suppression of the Anti-Demon Zone, even super natural abilities would become meaningless.

Therefore, one of the ways to resist the Anti-Demon Zone is the "Iron Heart Power", which has been one of Zhao Xu's goals. This specialized skill requires the support of the Nine Swords foundation, and without it, the cost of relying solely on martial arts learning would be too great.

The 7th level ability of the "Red Jade Guard" can be obtained by consuming "Dispersion Times" and gaining multiple "Quick Cast" abilities in a single turn.

This means that in the future, Zhao Xu will be able to instantly cast up to ten spells. He will no longer be limited by the current restrictions of one standard action spell and one quick action spell per turn, with a maximum of two spells.

At that time, he will be the strongest wizard in the world, with the support of "Potential Points" recovery spells and the ability to dispel. He will be able to output 4-5 thousand HP of damage without worrying about it, and his attacks will be as swift as lightning.

Zhao Xu was thinking about the "Eastern Empire" and how it would develop in the future, especially after he reached level 9. He would need to consider his next career path.

Suddenly, Zhao Xu's face fell.

He thought about the invasion of the underworld in a few years, when the entire Northern Alliance, including the entire Ice Mountain Range north of it, would be devastated. At that time, major organizations and kingdoms would only be able to focus on their own territory and would not be able to unite to resist the underworld.

Zhao Xu had heard that the students of the "Star Academy" had once tried to form an alliance among their respective families, but ultimately failed mysteriously.

However, when Zhang Feng sent an invitation, An Niya did not respond.

"Exchange life?" she sneered. "I thought you were sending a job offer instead."

At this time, Yin Er Gou revealed an awkward expression. "You know why. Because the composition of the student body is not strong enough, and it's hard to keep them under control."

"Oh?" An Niya stretched out her voice at this time.

"That's for you to introduce yourself," Yin Er Gou said, gesturing to the person beside Zhao Xu.

"Next is your turn to introduce yourself," An Niya had already poked her head out and gently poked Zhao Xu with her hand.

Zhao Xu remained calm and composed, without the slightest fluctuation. He gazed straight at the legendary wizard, Yin Er Gou.

"Mister, Ring Wizard of the Wizard Association, President of the Starfall Wizard Association, Goddess of Magic, and the ultimate keeper of the secret scroll of the Summer Solstice," Zhao Xu's voice was steady and gentle, with a slight pause between sentences.

At this time, the legendary wizard, Yin Er Gou, looked at Zhao Xu with a formal gaze.

As each title emerged, the veins on his forehead would subtly twitch.
Here is the translation:

Until the moment he was conferred the title of the secret transmission, he only widened his eyes and took a deep breath, as if he couldn't believe it. The cultivation he had spent thousands of years on was suddenly broken, and his identity as the secret transmission holder was of great significance. He had realized that his intelligence work on the floating city had a gaping hole.

"Ah, I see," said Yin Er Gou with a smile, but his tone was free of any slyness. "I thought you were someone rare when I saw you, but it seems you're actually the true heir of the ultimate scroll."

As he spoke, his expression turned comforting. "If it weren't for family matters getting in the way, we might still be allies today."

"Don't try to spin this," interrupted An Ti Nuo Ya. "You've applied to enter the ultimate scroll multiple times, but I've always refused. Don't think I don't know that you and Arxus are close."

Arxus, the legendary mage who had become a god from godly power, had spent thousands of years becoming a legend.

"Ha ha, old news," said Yin Er Gou, patting his head. "How did you remember it so clearly, An Ti Nuo Ya?"

"However, since it's like that, I'll give you, Summer Brother, an invitation to become a teacher," he said, smiling.

"I don't know what your intentions are," said An Ti Nuo Ya, getting down from the carriage and staring directly at Yin Er Gou. "You know what I mean."

Here is the translation of the text:

Suddenly, in the East Land Empire, legendary mage Yin Zhi Gou, who could calm the cries of children just by his reputation, heard An Ti Nuo Ya's words and couldn't help but change his expression slightly. "Miss An Ti Nuo Ya, you were granted the entire Nine Swords system because of your achievements in founding a country, and the Thirteen Clans specially allowed you to pass it down."

As for this young brother, I really dare not make any promises about this. Especially since you know that the Nine Swords White Crow, Iron Heart, and other systems all have profound implications, and it's not something I can easily transmit."

Yin Zhi Gou thought to himself that An Ti Nuo Ya must be after the most valuable "Iron Heart" among the Nine Swords, which could be exchanged for two specializations.

Zhao Xu had already understood this. Perhaps An Ti Nuo Ya and Yin Zhi Gou had some agreement, and he was just introducing himself to guarantee that he could enter the academy and obtain the entire Nine Swords system.

As for White Crow, he knew it was one of the Nine Swords' styles, but he didn't know its true essence.

Yin Zhi Gou then explained patiently, "White Crow is the core of the Nine Swords' Charge style. Some of its techniques can enhance your charging ability. If you obtain An Ti Nuo Ya's unconditional inheritance, you can combine it with our system."

"One stroke can cause tens of thousands of damage. That's child's play," he said, lightly tapping his waist-length sword.

The meaning was clear.

Zhao Xu, who had previously outputted over a hundred points of damage with his own ghostly attack, heard tens of thousands of points of damage. It was hard to imagine.

It's unlikely that he could casually say a sentence and take down an ancient dragon, and actually achieve it, right?

As Zhao Xu thought about it, he realized that "spell output" and "physical output" both needed to be strong.

An Ti Nuo Ya's cultivation was a comprehensive strengthening path, rather than focusing on a single aspect of strength, following the path of "one move flowing".
Here is the translation:

"Compared to others, he excels in being all-around, able to take out any means. 'Some key things, of course, don't need to be taught by you, such as the Iron Heart Force,' Anxinyue explained. 'Even the "Martial Arts Learning" that can exchange techniques through mastery of the "Channel" doesn't require it. As for leading the vanguard of the White Crow, it's not too sensitive either.'"

Wujinggou heard these words and couldn't help but relax his expression slightly.

Zhao Xu, on the other hand, kept his head bowed in silence.

As for the Iron Heart Force and Martial Arts Learning, they had both been obtained by Zhao Xu in the "Truth Fragment" section of the final scroll. Of course, he didn't need to be taught by others.

"Besides, I'm not old enough to decide everything," Zhao Xu said.

"For example, the Perfect Order Qi also matches," Anxinyue said carelessly.

"This can't be matched—"
Legendary Mage Wujinggou was about to continue speaking when he saw Anxinyue's sharp gaze and suddenly stopped.

"Alright then, Anxinyue, list out what he needs to learn for me. As long as it's not too much, I'll agree," Wujinggou said with a sigh.

However, Anxinyue suddenly handed Wujinggou a piece of parchment. "It's all written down there."

Wujinggou felt as if he had been lured in, waiting for the trap to spring shut.

He took the parchment from Anxinyue and glanced at the contents. His brow furrowed.

"The White Crow Tactics are really impossible to grasp, and giving them to outsiders will cause them to explode. This is our key advantage. Unless this young one is willing to join the Wujing family, the old ancient artifacts won't agree to pass on the teachings."
As he was speaking, a sudden flash of inspiration struck him, "However, Anzhi noya, it just so happens that the Eastern Empire has a princess of marrying age, and if——"
