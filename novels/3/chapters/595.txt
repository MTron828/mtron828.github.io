Chapter 596: Heavenly War, Eternal Requiem

For ordinary people, clearing the snow in front of their own door is already an act of great kindness. Especially in the face of a crisis of "apocalyptic" proportions, being able to fend for oneself is an extraordinary achievement.

Just like the Earth, self-preservation is the greatest dream of a small country in a world war.

However, there is no perfect egg under a broken nest.

Therefore, after Zhao Xu summoned over a hundred "giants" to aid Aian, even the most hopeless person couldn't help but feel a glimmer of hope for survival, realizing that they finally had a glimmer of life.

This is what these "giants" can bring, accompanied by myths and legends.

Several hundred giants combined with Aian's original powers were enough to maintain a stalemate.

However, compared to the external threat of over 100,000 undead creatures, even the strength of these giants was unable to focus on every single camp, killing four directions.

Moreover, the undead army itself had sharp forces within, and when combined, they could counter the giants.

Therefore, after traversing over a hundred camps scattered across the land, at that time, he had already realized or seen through something. He strengthened the original Earth's forces, but the dark hand from the shadows would stir the scales of balance, making the originally thriving Earth a more dire environment.

It was as if there was a mysterious force trying to tell Zhao Xu - no matter how hard he tried, he would only lead all Earthlings to a more perilous slope.
Here is the translation of the text:

Even among the evil gods, there are many who would rejoice at the sight of this spectacle.

Despair and suffering are the fertile soil in which the evil gods can grow strong, and the warm bed in which they can ferment their dark rituals.

The goddess Mistra, relying on her initial "miracles," has already created a profound impression on the people of the barren wasteland.

Her divine name has also spread to the deepest recesses of everyone's heart, occupying a crucial position ahead of time.

When people choose to believe, they know that they must make a great sacrifice.

This time, the "Wraith Tides" is a crucial move to reshape one's faith.

Therefore, Zhao Xu thought about this point and suddenly discarded half of his chips.

He consumed all the divine wax candles on his body, used up the summoning beads he obtained from the Northern Alliance, and paid the price of the broken-down Book of Laws created by Lakissa.

He consumed the second barrier that existed before he became an "elect."

In this way, he was determined to unleash this ultimate blow!

He aimed to create a bridge that traverses heaven and earth, connecting Arthur and the goddess nation.

For the gods, Arthur is like a hive with countless paths created by ants, with seemingly intricate webs and cracks, but also unbreakable.

The gods' power projected onto Arthur is through these initial "paths" that allow them to infiltrate.

The existence of "magic" that has forged the position of a pastor and achieved the eternal fame of the gods also relies on the "net" channel.

However, other power channels such as granting divine blessings and creating pastors are dependent on the railway network and land transportation.
Here is the translation of the text:

The gods' incarnation and the manifestation of divine miracles, which are as extravagant and expensive as "empty transportation", are the most luxurious and costly. In theory, with Zhao Xiu and the magical goddess, their relationship is akin to a "symbiotic alliance". He even dares to pray for a divine favor, and the goddess may descend and incarnate. However, this time, Zhao Xiu has exhausted all these resources to forge a channel to expand the divine energy. He built a huge platform for the goddess to drop her power and lock it down. The prayer candle is essentially establishing an external anchor for the gods to shine a small light in the dark, allowing the gods to smoothly channel their power. The faithful must determine the gods' location, and the gods must also determine the faithful's location. Once this anchor is fixed, it becomes the pastor. This is also the reason why the faithful must recite their own name when praying to the gods. At this moment, he has set the stage for the goddess and is waiting for her to resolve this "wave of spirits". From the initial "magician's association" that established a communication channel between the earth and Yarsa's material energy, Zhao Xiu has already suspected that this time's earth-crossing event is the "forbidden object" of the strongest gods in the gods' realm, which cannot be meddled with by other forces. The original natural phenomenon of the "barren wasteland" has suddenly amplified its power. It is essentially a population reduction measure that absorbs extreme believers. This is not too detrimental to some evil gods, whose basic plate is already there, but it is a crushing blow to the gods who can encompass and absorb great power. This is also the reason why Zhao Xiu is filled with confidence and decides to unleash this decisive blow.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

At this moment, he is staring at the increasingly vast gate of heaven, as if this gate has already connected to another dimension. On the land of Asia, where the goddess Sylvia granted the legend of the summer solstice. Those stubborn individuals who refused to kneel, even when praying, finally felt their knees weaken and they knelt down in reverence to the summer solstice. Together, they were bowing to the sky above.

At this moment, the gate of heaven is like a chorus of countless singers singing hymns behind the scenes, and the gate is constantly radiating sacred energy waves. This overwhelming pressure made people unable to think of anything else, and they could only kneel down in worship.

Only Zhao Xu remained standing alone behind the gate, untouched by the energy circle that seemed to spread out behind him, with no intention of obstruction or entanglement. At the same time, Zhao Xu's identity as a 1st-level priest and his connection to the gate of heaven, which connected to the goddess's realm, resonated with him.

At this moment, he was also wondering what kind of being would emerge from the gate next, to tread on this barren land of the world! It was like the incantation of the nine-ring curse, summoning the heavenly legion, which would shoot down a holy light from the sky, followed by a slow-forming giant ball of energy. The summoned beings would then emerge from the light ball - 2 to 8 holy messengers (2nd level), 1 to 4 canine messengers (4th level). Although they were all strengthened, their power was limited, and they could only last for 10 minutes per level. This was the pitiful aspect of the high-level summoning spell, as the summoned beings were no match for the combat power of that time, and could only barely hold on.
Here is the translation of the text:

At this moment, countless civilians who have gathered at Yanan have raised their heads, eagerly gazing at the sky, eagerly looking back at the bio-beings that are about to descend.

The names of numerous powerful bio-beings are being described by some players, with a hopeful expression.

If the power is comparable to that of a giant dragon, one hundred, one thousand, or ten thousand of them represent three different meanings.

To suppress the tide of undead creatures, it is necessary to use a wave of monster-like creatures with a similar scale of power to counterbalance.

"Boom!" Suddenly, a bell tolls, echoing through the hearts of everyone.

"Boom!" The bell tolls again, this time accompanied by the cacophony of a thousand galloping horses.

"Boom!" The third bell tolls, and the drums of war begin to beat.

In an instant, the gate of heaven opens, releasing countless "heavenly sacred lights" that not only shine on the present-day Yanan but also on distant camps.

All earthly civilians are reminded once again of the night when stars fell from the sky.

At that time, they were controlled, frozen in body, soul, and thought.

Then, their entire body was completely transferred to Arthur.

Suddenly, the star-like lights that had pierced the sky began to dissipate, and the original sacred light sphere began to mutateâ€”

Hunters!

Zhao Xiu's heart could not help but surge with excitement as he saw over a thousand hunters before him, although this was not a scale compared to the countless undead creatures amassed around Yanan.

However, there was no exception to the hunters, a level 15, large-scale, chaotic, and formidable bio-being designed to kill anyone who resisted natural death. Anyone who used non-natural means to prolong their life would become a target for the hunters.
Here is the translation of the text:

Those who use unconventional methods to escape death will be considered criminals by the hunters. Although using magic to revive the dead will not attract the attention of the hunters, if the frequency or scale of the revivals is too high, it will still incur their punishment.

Chain lightning! Force wall technique! Earthquake technique! Electric flash fist!

As the hunters gaze out at the vast expanse, these immortal beings who have escaped death, even if it's just once a week, will unleash their abilities without hesitation.

In an instant, the entire area becomes a sea of lightning, with no place to step.

Just as the giants who had just cleared the area looked down at the countless six-ring magic flashes, the powerful electric arcs made the dragons who relied on magical resistance tremble with fear.

It's truly too terrifying.

However, the hunters did not stop their pursuit. They continued to unleash their "arbitrary gates" and wildly chased down every "immortal being" that had managed to escape the electric flashes.

"Boom!"

This time, the heavenly gate shot out a "shadow" towards the distance, followed by countless "heavenly gates" projecting upward in the entire wasteland of death.

Zhou Xu saw this scene and smiled slightly.

The goddess's intention was also clear: these believers did not want to give up.

The gods sat idly by as the tide of spirits, partly due to being unprepared and partly due to not reacting in time, partly due to sitting back and watching the new opportunities arise in the changing situation.

For the goddess Sylvina, this changing situation was also an opportunity to prove her immortality to all the interdimensional travelers.

In an instant, Zhou Xu saw that the heavenly gate had expanded to over a hundred meters in width, and the "shadow" with a glow of light began to emerge from within.
Here is the translation of the text:

The heavenly attendants, with their strong martial arts, are warriors who are as powerful as the strongest demonic creatures. Only the strongest demonic creatures dare to face their might.

This being, with the name of the strongest angel, has walked out of the realm of the 36 heavens, forming an unbeatable formation that can shatter mountains and flatten armies.

At the same time, hundreds of high-level heavenly attendants (16th level) follow them, each one a 9th-level priest.

Behind them, there are also numerous "Star Apostles" (14th level), "Gale Angels" (13th level), "Trumpet Angels" (14th level), and "Throne Angels" (15th level), each forming a massive team.

Just when everyone thought that was all, the curtain of heaven's gate suddenly seemed to be like the raging waves of the sea, intensifying with each passing moment.

The triangular formation of the heavenly attendants, with countless "Saint Light Angels" (2nd level), "Bearded Angels" (4th level), "Guardian Angels" (8th level), and "Penghu Angels" (9th level) emerging from the gates of heaven, each with a scale of thousands.

Taking into account the countless heavenly creatures scattered across the gates of heaven, it's as if all the angels and heavenly attendants from the entire war in the heavenly realm have been summoned. Xiaoyu is not doubtful about this.

This scale of war is only comparable to the "plane war" that takes place when the heavenly realm and the abyss engage in a divine war of this level.

The mere sound of the "Hum" of the flying heavenly attendants is enough to create a storm that shakes the heavens.

If hundreds of giant dragons were previously covering the sky and blocking out the sun, like a dark cloud pressing down on the city.

Then, at this moment, the gathering of heavenly beings in the land of Aiyun is a legend of the war that changes the stars and the world!

This force that can easily destroy any nation's power will be sung by bards until the end of the world.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Kill!"

Standing at the forefront was "Arthoria", a former partner of Zhao Xu, wielding the "Battle Flag" that concentrated her divine energy. She swung it towards the undead biological army below.

"Boom! Boom!"

In an instant, the powerful celestial beings from the sky descended onto the battlefield, unleashing a torrent of divine energy that was like an unstoppable "tidal wave" that slammed into the undead biological army.

The intelligent undead biological beings, such as vampires, night shadows, and spirits, all let out a shocked cry and fled in disarray.

They had previously been holding human corpses, but they abandoned their looting and fled in terror, not even bothering to look back at the skeletal corpses being trampled beneath their feet.

However, the 36 Heavenly Generals themselves were the supreme commanders of the battlefield, and they did not pause in their stride. They led the troops behind them, charging headfirst into the weak points of the undead biological army.

The "Nine-Ring Revenge Storm", the "Nine-Ring Elemental Cluster", the "Eight-Ring Fire Storm", and the "Seven-Ring Holy Word" all rained down on the undead biological army like free gifts.

Not to mention that angels were born with "Protective Spiritual Energy", possessing the effect of invalidating evil spells and secondary magical barriers.

"All Nethers, listen to my command! Let us march forward and annihilate the undead!"

As the war scales tipped in their favor, Zhao Xu also spread his voice to the masses, transmitting it to the crowd still lingering below.

Since he had to walk this road to the end.

Since the chaotic hands that lurked in the darkness were coming for him, he would flip this world upside down.
Here is the translation:

"He pushed Yangnan's combat abilities to the extreme, allowing these followers to transcend the peak of their past. With millions of undead creatures and heavenly beings, Yangnan, who had eaten his fill of meat, was also able to grow together. This time, the 'Spectral Wave' is the first official collision between the Earth Crossers and the Arthurian Monsters!"
