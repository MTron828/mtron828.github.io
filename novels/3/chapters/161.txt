Chapter 162: Curse Guardian

Zhao Xu looked at the dynamic information reminder and almost rubbed his eyes. It's just that Arthus is a brain-computer interface game, and it's impossible for him to see flowers.

Even illusions can't fake these dynamic panels. "Did I just swear an oath?" Zhao Xu couldn't help but ask.

This is a bit too childish, even a child would pull it up. He can only recite questions?

"Ah, big brother, this feeling is indeed a bit too fast. This shows that you are very close to the source of magic, which is why you have such a fluid reaction. You truly deserve to be my most respected big brother."

The voice of the seven in the void spoke again, "Generally speaking, when a nine-ring mage makes such an oath, the source of magic is lazy and doesn't bother to respond. Only legendary mages can barely use it. Big brother, although your fate has intersected with the fate lines of countless people, you are still in the growth period and should be promoted by me. I'll give you a push."

Zhao Xu finally understood that the other party was boasting about being able to control the world by deducing the intersection of fate lines.

"Ah, big brother, you are the priest of Sylvanas, and the prerequisite for advancing to the 'Curse Guardian' is to have a magic domain. So, big brother, you must have this domain, which naturally leads to the establishment of the oath, but the firepower should be insufficient."

Magic domain?
Progress requirements?
Zhao Xu finally realized that he had forgotten why Lyra, the mage, wanted to become a priest so desperately. It turned out that the key was here.

Only priests can have domains.
Other methods are much harder than becoming a 1st-level priest.
Zhao Xu knew that those who specialized in secret methods could obtain domain magic, but it was not truly a magical domain.

This meant that, in essence, all curse protectors would also have a secondary job as a level 1 priest.

Zhao Xu suddenly thought deeply and sighed in disappointment.

When he entered the floating city, the goddess told him to become a scripture scholar, but he was also required to retain his level 1 priest title.

It turned out that this was the reason.

He felt as if he was destined to become a curse protector from birth.

"Brother, have you touched the 'Final Scroll'?" Seven asked after a moment of thought.

Zhao Xu didn't expect that this would be discovered, and nodded slightly.

However, he wasn't too concerned, as the Mo Lin Stone and the Final Scroll were both products of the same era and had some connection.

"That's it, I'm not surprised. You've taken on a form of the magic source and can quickly connect the oath. You're indeed a worthy brother."

After hearing this answer, Zhao Xu had already overestimated the Final Scroll.

Little did he know, he would eventually underestimate it.

After the three generations of magic goddesses ended the magical network's form, the entire network automatically shrunk and evolved into one of the fundamental laws of each plane.

On one hand, the number of accomplished mages decreased, which was also the reason why high-level mages were harder to come by in recent years.

No one could feel the magical network's rhythm as they once did.

After the network self-imploded, it also gained another name - the magic source.

Thinking about this, Zhao Xu began to feel that perhaps something was not under the goddess's control.

Rather, was it the original intent's inclination towards him?

Zhao Xu felt that his reborn identity was not as prominent as he thought.
Here is the translation of the text:

However, the ultimate reason may only be clear when he becomes a high-level mage in the future.

"Big brother, let's take advantage of the heat and hurry to simulate the progress," Seven Seven said in the void.

At this time, Zhao Xu had already figured out how to react and nodded directly.

【Adventurer Zhongxia, you have temporarily acquired the advanced profession "Cursekeeper" and the profession ability】

【Adventurer Zhongxia, you have temporarily acquired the advanced profession "Super Magical Sculptor" and the profession ability】

Zhao Xu looked at the prompt and suddenly a stack of abilities appeared on his panel.

Immediately, his dynamic panel continued to refresh:

【Adventurer Zhongxia, you have temporarily acquired the super magical specialty: instant casting, silent casting, static casting, extreme casting, strong casting, upgrading casting, twin casting, chain casting, and shaping casting】

"Now you can try using those abilities," Seven Seven reminded him.

Zhao Xu also observed his future advanced profession abilities at the same time.

As a Cursekeeper, he had a basic understanding of it, but the most mysterious one was the "Super Natural Ability" that could be obtained at level 4.

This ability could turn any spell into a super natural ability without paying the spell cost.

Thinking about this, Zhao Xu activated this ability and directly cast the "Identification Spell" on his own cloak.

The entire process did not require chanting or spellcasting gestures, but only used a single super natural ability, which was frighteningly simple.

Suddenly, the light of the "Identification Spell" fell on Zhao Xu's entire star cloak, and various ability data about the cloak appeared in his mind.

After verifying his idea, Zhao Xu was shocked in his heart.
Here is the translation of the text:

He can now cast spells without any cost, which means he can cast free spells and various high-cost spells. Originally, identification spells required a one-hour incantation time. Zhao Xun once took nearly an hour to recite a nearly one-hour incantation. However, he can now cast identification spells instantly with his "supernatural spellcasting" ability. This means he can cast spells that originally required more than one hour of incantation time in just a single "instant" time. As a result, many spells that previously required 10 minutes or an hour to cast have become more convenient. These spells were originally only used in battles, unless one could maintain a spell for an entire day. However, after Zhao Xun mastered the "supernatural spellcasting" ability, the frequency of using these spells will undoubtedly increase. Zhao Xun then turned his attention to the "Super Magic Master", taking a deep breath as if to say "Ah, this is amazing!" and even took a second breath without panting. With just a single level of the "Supernatural Manipulation" ability, Zhao Xun shattered all his previous notions about professional abilities. This ability, which is said to be divine, allows him to sacrifice his own attributes to combine with the Super Magic specialty. This way, he does not need to prepare higher spell levels. Normal mages need to use high-level spells to cast spells with the "Spell Endurance" specialty, equivalent to releasing a simple spell with a level 7 spell level. It's like a sledgehammer crushing an ant. However, with this ability, he can cast spells with a cost of 2 points of attribute enhancement.
Here is the translation:

Zhou Xu only needs to pay 12 attribute points to lose 12 attribute points and gain the ability to cast a perpetual spell ring. This requires upgrading the six-ring spell slot and using 12 attribute points to replace it, which looks fairly fair. However, Zhou Xu can use the spell to recover attributes and even immunity to attribute damage after using it. Although he hasn't tested it yet, he needs to verify it specifically.

Even so, the intensity of this ability is unacceptable. Zhou Xu can only acquire this ability at level 6, and by then he will be almost invincible. If he reaches level 9, he will gain the potential point and the ability "Super Natural Spell" along with the curse protection level, which is truly unbeatable.

"Brother, does it feel okay?" Qiqi in the void asked.

Zhou Xu nodded, "It's indeed very strong."

Unfortunately, he is currently just a 3rd-level wizard, although he has gained inspiration from the two new professions, and he still needs to master it.

Suddenly, Zhou Xu felt the energy of the Super Magic Shaper dissipating, which was unbelievable.

"Oh, brother, don't worry. The ability of the Super Magic Shaper is too difficult and too strong. So the simulated effect is like this, but it's still enough for you to get this profession in the future, so don't worry." Qiqi explained hastily.

"What about someone who has advanced?" Zhou Xu suddenly became curious.

"There isn't." Qiqi replied briefly.

"What do you mean?" Zhou Xu was amazed.

"It means that there is no one in this world who has advanced to the level of the Super Magic Shaper."

Note: The translation is in Simplified Chinese.
After hearing this answer, Zhao Xu suddenly felt a sense of pressure emanating from the surrounding air.

"Because this profession is from an unofficial, multiverse pink country," Seven explained. "The things in that world are too powerful, and we even suspect that it's a projection of a universe's will rather than an actual existence. So that multiverse world has never been officially recorded or registered."

"However, the 'Super Magical Sculptor' skill has still spread to various multiverses. But since it can influence the will of the world, once someone has advanced, it's basically cut off the path for others."

Zhao Xu couldn't help but examine himself, "So, when I advance in this profession, basically no one else will be able to advance?"

"Yes, congratulations, you've advanced in the unique hidden profession," Seven's voice became flattering again.

Zhao Xu clearly knew that Arthur was not a traditional online game he played, and there was no such thing as a single, hidden profession throughout the entire server.

However, this absurd concept, which no one would believe, actually happened to him, leaving Zhao Xu feeling as if he was dreaming.

This also meant that in the next period of time, he needed to desperately climb to level 6, taking the lead to obtain this skill.

Once someone else obtained this skill, it would mean that Zhao Xu's path would be cut off.

Especially since Zhao Xu now felt that the level 1 ability of the "Super Magical Sculptor" skill was so powerful that it could overturn many rules, he went from being reverent to longing.

Only when he possessed both skills could he truly begin to dominate his own destiny.
Here is the translation:

"Oh, big brother, those mages haven't eaten enough, and my strength is about to be drained by them. I estimate that even you won't be able to stay here for too long. Why don't we just take a few packs of special products back? After all, your progress will only be enough to support you until level 9, anyway..."

Suddenly, Zhao Xu's field of vision was filled with the screen flashing up with the message: "【Adventurer Zhong Xia, you have temporarily acquired the advanced profession 'XXX' profession ability】".

Guardian of Magic, Red Jade Guard, Devout Pray, Elite Demon Warrior, Elite Apostle, Super Curse Master, Rainbow Apprentice...
He raised an eyebrow slightly, wondering when these advanced professions had been acquired?
