Chapter 610: Dragon Crystal Vein

500 pages, which can be transcribed using the One-Ring Spell, can record 500 formulas, Two-Ring Spell 250 formulas, Three-Ring Spell 166 formulas, and Four-Ring Spell 125 formulas.

In general, most ordinary wizards cannot complete the transcription of the "Olympian Crystal" with their entire life. Not to mention Zhao Xu's "Olympian Crystal", which is just over half a catty and the size of two ordinary apples, while five ordinary 100-page spellbooks weigh 15 catties.

If there is no dimensional bag space item, ordinary wizards will find it cumbersome to carry their spellbooks on their backs, let alone prepare various spellbooks and flip through them.

It's so convenient to hold an Olympian Crystal!

Moreover, this involves deeper benefits!

Transcribing spells can cause the loss of spellbooks and formulas, so wizards often pray to the goddess, offering 50 gold coins per page, similar to "buying insurance".

Otherwise, the imprint of the spellbook will be erased, and re-transcribing it will cost 100 gold coins per page.

This is also the reason for the hindrance to the entire magical system's "spell flow" and even suppresses the progress of the magical civilization.

Assuming that borrowing and transcribing spells does not consume the original spellbook's magical residue, then borrowing and transcribing spellbooks is essentially a "cost-free" affair.

Although ordinary wizards may not always lend out spellbooks for transcription due to the preparation of spells.
Here is the translation of the text:

However, it is possible to create a backup "magical book" that costs a significant amount of time. Even if the rental fee is still 50 gold coins per page, it will be returned twice.

A "magical book" is equivalent to a permanent "rental property" that can be rented out.

Zhao Xu also saw through everyone's thoughts and directly laughed, "The production cost of the Olin crystal is the pre-paid fee for copying. So, after copying 500 pages, if the rental fee is worn out to be blank, it will still be 100 gold coins per page for copying. It's like scattering silver powder to engrave it. Don't think you can make a fortune by renting out an Olin crystal without limit."

Although this is the case, the light in people's eyes has not dimmed at all.

No matter what, the cost of one Olin crystal is 6250 gold coins, which is equivalent to compressing one page of 100 gold coins to 12.5 gold coins per page. Even if the masters sleep, they can laugh out loud.

The market will automatically flatten the space for profiteering, so the Olin crystal, which is priced at 3125 gold coins in the guild, will be sold outside for nearly 50,000 gold coins.

"The Goddess's Blessing Book has 1000 pages, and the guild price is 12500 gold coins per page, so the Olin crystal is essentially half of the Blessing Book in nature." Zhao Xu explained.

"However, without the Goddess's blessing, the Blessing Book is useless." The female mage, Qingli, shook her head, "So, even with the expertise in 'manufacturing strange things' and the recipe for the Blessing Book, it is still impossible to achieve this."

"No, it's the advantage of not needing the Goddess's blessing for the Olin crystal," Zhao Xu said.

At this time, Nalira sighed and shook her head, "It seems that it's just a waste of effort now."
Here is the translation of the passage:

As the lone star opposite pointed out this point, it was as if it had shattered all illusions. "Who would have thought it would end like this?" the female wizard, Liú Ruì, said with a sense of incredulity, her voice tinged with disappointment. "Using two Olin crystals to engrave on ordinary skull cannons, that's a bold move."

"It's possible that these skulls were from a warlock's lair," Zhao Xu joked. "At that time, stepping on it wouldn't be unreasonable."

For "Nalü Luòyà" team, which had already established a commercial organization, the 10,000 gold coins were like a death sentence. Therefore, it's natural that they wouldn't find it worth it.

"Don't blame you for getting it wrong," Zhao Xu said, pulling out a similar-looking "Dragon Crystal" from his pocket. The crystal still shimmered with a faint, dark red vortex.

"This Dragon Crystal is an ordinary spell crystal, which is the precursor to the Olin crystal," he explained.

However, compared to the Olin crystal, this spell crystal could only record 20 pages, and it would still require 100 gold coins' worth of silver powder for each page.

"No, we've also seen this type of spell crystal in those skulls," Nalü Luòyà suddenly exclaimed, her eyes filled with incredulity.

"How many?" Zhao Xu couldn't help but ask.

"Many," Nalü Luòyà said, her eyes shining with a hint of light.

"It's lucky that our first identification was the Olin crystal. If it wasn't for identifying it as an ordinary spell crystal at the time, we would have missed these Olin crystals."
Here is the translation:

Because these magical crystals are identified as ordinary magical books after being refined, they have no practical value, so we didn't pay much attention to them, thinking that these Olympian crystals are special products of these magical crystals. In short, they are similar to the silver ore in the silver mine.

Just looking at it, is there really a "magical crystal" vein? Or are these "magical crystals" also processed products?

Zhao Xu silently lowered his head, his mind already unable to hold back the shock.

Magical crystals, in essence, are "Arthurian crystals", a type of hard, semi-transparent stone similar to precious gems.

Arthur's surface has also extracted many "dragon crystals", but they are usually used as additives for storing magical materials, usually in the form of powder.

Therefore, it is understandable that the opposite wizards did not recognize the magical crystals as they were, in fact, a magical material.

However, the key question is that most of the "dragon crystals" discovered by Arthur are of low-grade quality, used for grinding or as alternative gemstones, or embedded in jewelry.

According to legend, wearing such jewelry can bring good luck.

But this large dragon crystal can only be used as a "magical crystal" for recording magic. Even so, it's like 20 pages of empty magical books can't compare to a single copy of a 100-page book.

The crucial point is that the blessing of the goddess is lacking.

Zhao Xu couldn't bear to waste the goddess's blessing, so he had to ensure that his blessing book would definitely succeed.

However, others cannot replicate this.

As for the magical crystals, through craftsmanship, they can be processed into "Olympian crystals".

That is, as long as he finds this "vein", Arthur's magical process may change for the better.
