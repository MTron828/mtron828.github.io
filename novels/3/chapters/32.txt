Chapter 33: True Advancement

As the chairman of the Mage Association, Osso possesses secrets that far exceed what's known to those present. Even the oldest among them, who has witnessed the gods, can't compare to him. Osso recalls a solemn oath made by another monarch and hesitates, taking his time to speak.

"'It's not that he goes to see the goddess, but the goddess goes to him.'"

This statement sends shockwaves through the assembly of powerful mages, who take a deep breath, unable to suppress their emotions. This sentence may signal the onset of a new catastrophe and the beginning of another divine war.

"It's impossible," says Naser, who has spent decades researching the mysteries of fate and time. His eyes, once empty, now burn with an intense soulfire, a characteristic of the few remaining great wizards in the realm of the dead. Naser's words leave no doubt among the assembled giants.

The goddess wants to see someone, despite the gods being unable to physically visit the mortal realm. However, it's possible to send a divine avatar. Saintly beings, like the seven giants present, have the ability to manifest themselves in various forms. They reside in hidden, extremely secret locations, and their true forms are summoned through legendary magic. As they traverse the world, they use this magic to create projections of themselves, which possess the consciousness and abilities of the original being.

Mages who have reached level 5 have developed several emergency escape routes, while those who have reached level 21 or above in the realm of legends have even more formidable abilities.
Here is the translation of the text:

Just leaving aside the seven giants, a high-level mage's skills can be over ten. Even if the seven giants' projections are shattered, the real body hiding in the shadows can be killed, and the resurrection sequence triggered by death can be repeated up to ten times. But the goddess is currently taking a different approach, using Zhao Xu's sitting on the throne of the Oracle King as a trigger to summon him to the moment when she was not yet a god in the River of History and meet with him.

"The threads of the divine are bound by their own hands, so no one can go back in time to kill the gods when they were still fledglings."

"The Magic Goddess, who possesses part of the divine aura, is even more exceptional in this regard."

Oz simply repeated this twice, which is not a secret to the legendary mage. However, the other six people, relying on their knowledge, skills, and intelligence, are very clear about what Oz is trying to convey.

The gods of the fate system do not have an advantage over gods of the same level, and their divine power cannot influence the fate of the gods. However, they can kill or spare mortals.

Because the gods of the fate system can see potential threats to their existence, they have the power to intervene in the timeline to eliminate them.

In addition to her immense magical power, the goddess who possesses part of the divine aura also has a temporal aura that is almost taboo.

This goddess can find the most suitable timeline from among countless timelines and even if none of them fit, she can reverse the flow of time, sever the timeline, and start anew from a certain point.

This is also the reason why this third Magic Goddess does not fall like the previous two.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Just what level of crisis is needed to force a divine being to intervene and meet their past self? If there's a possibility that Zhao Xun poses a threat to the goddess, it's not worth killing him now. Even if Zhao Xun grows up to become a legendary mage, the goddess still has the ability to go back in time and kill his weak past self, gradually weakening his powerful future self. She wants to use Zhao Xun's power, and that's something that can be done in the future world line. It's not necessary for Zhao Xun to intervene in her extremely private world line.

"That's the only explanation. The Earth Adventurer, Mr. Summer, is the breaker of the goddess's deadlocked situation. He is the only possible one among all impossible ones. The goddess needs him as an anchor to change the direction of her world line."

Oscar said, "This content will be recorded in the 9th level of the secret archives and sealed."

"Received, Jacques has recorded it," said a golem standing silently at the door, who had undergone intelligence enhancement and was even more intelligent than ordinary people.

Seeing that everyone had accepted Oscar's explanation, Oscar continued, "Before we discuss the interrupted topic, I'd like to propose an application."

"It's about the Earth Adventurer, Summer, 5-level advancement arrangements."
"Previously, we had planned to assign him the 'Spell Guardian' as his divine magic side's advancement."
"Originally, we didn't plan to advance his arcane side, but now it seems that's no longer sufficient. So I propose——"
"'Super Curse Master'? This way, no one will be able to stop him in the future."

As he raised his somewhat grayish eyebrows, Oscar's expression turned cold.
Here is the translation:

Therefore, he and the association's representative, Os, do not have a consistent view on the ultimate scroll system.

"'Guardian of Magic' I agree to grant him promotion, it's within your authority. However, the grant of 'Master of Curse' has always been reserved for association wizards who have made outstanding contributions. I don't object to giving it to Zhongxiao, but at least wait until he has accumulated enough merits before doing so," said Ang.

Magical abilities of wizards have a certain duration, ranging from a few seconds to several hours, or even days.

However, once an ability can last for an entire day, its strategic significance is completely different.

One day is exactly the period for a wizard's magical abilities to recover.

This wizard will no longer need to hastily apply various defensive buffs in response to sudden crises, only to counterattack later.

Various additive buffs can become permanent, allowing the wizard to directly boost their combat power to the extreme, transforming them into a war behemoth.

After being bolstered by various magical abilities, wizards can even surpass warriors in terms of physical damage output, which is no exaggeration.

The "Permanence of Magic" specialization is the key to reaching 24 hours.

However, the cost of this specialization is enormous, and through some stacking mechanism, the Master of Curse can suppress this cost to near zero.

Therefore, the association has always been cautious when granting the Master of Curse promotion.

Any Master of Curse is stronger than a wizard of the same level, and nearly unbeatable.

Among the 11-20 level wizard choices, there are only two Master of Curse specializations.

However, the 11-20 level wizard choosing to become a Master of Curse has four specializations and six powerful abilities.

Extremely one-sided.

"No, I plan to grant a different promotion."
Osprey gazed at the crowd's eyes, speaking slowly and distinctly: "It's a lower-cost...- Super Magic Sculpting Method!"

Super Magic Sculpting Method, the first step in Osprey's magic!
