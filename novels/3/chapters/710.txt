Chapter 711: Mysterious Cave

Maze?

Zhao Xu was surprised to find that this was not what he expected - a magical web deep pit outside the boundary of the mystical realm. This was troublesome.

Zhao Xu raised an eyebrow slightly, and the will of the spider-like Roselle was deeply connected to this mystical web, just like the Trinity.

This was also the reason why Roselle was expanding the area of the mystical web, allowing herself to continue to enhance her strength.

However, this also meant that Roselle's control over the entire level was far beyond that of a typical abyssal lord. And since this level was under her control, it was almost impossible for Zhao Xu to use transportation magic in the mystical web.

The only way for ordinary people to escape was to find the weak point of the suppression and use "interdimensional teleportation" to leave. However, using "teleportation" or "arbitrary gates" to traverse thousands of miles was basically impossible.

Only some of Roselle's extremely favored subordinates possessed the extremely evil "Mysterious Geometric Sculptures" that allowed them to teleport between specified locations in the mystical web.

Zhao Xu remembered the specific shapes of the sculptures, including the iron pyramid, silver ball, copper octagonal star, and cyan crystal cube. He thought to himself that he could take one of them if he wanted to.

Thinking of this, Zhao Xu began his daily routine again.

According to logic, he had now upgraded to a level 9 mage, with 1st-level rituals, 1st-level Eien stones, 1st-level tattoos, 5th-level physical sacrifices, and 2nd-level hymns of the sacred. After combining these, he had reached a total of 19 levels.

According to logic, this was Zhao Xu's final level as a mage.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

However, he possesses the "Domain of Decline", which can additionally boost his spellcasting level by half. Therefore, some one-time boosting methods can also be activated and inserted into the "Domain of Decline" to produce a 50% boost effect.

Instantly, "Mana Crystal" (4), Arsenic Cross (4), Spellcasting Enhancement (2), Holy Symbol (1), and Proficient Spellcaster (latent ability, 2) are all activated and used by Zhao Xu one after another.

Therefore, his spellcasting level after activating the "Domain of Decline" is 19 + 13 = 32, which is equivalent to a 16-level boost.

As a result, Zhao Xu's spellcasting level remains fixed at 19 + 32/2 = 35 for the entire day.

However!

In this dark web pit, all spells with chaotic or evil properties will have their effects doubled based on the spellcaster's level!

The spider web spells will also automatically spread and cover a region twice the size, with a 3-level increase in difficulty, and the duration of the Spider Web and Venomous Bug spells will be doubled.

Even the natural recovery speed of evil creatures will be doubled, making this a natural evil and chaotic place.

In other words, when Zhao Xu casts the "Domain of Decline", his 32-level spellcasting will be treated as 64.

That is, the 50% boost effect from the "Domain of Decline" is also equivalent to 32 levels.

Finally, after completing the spell within the dark web pit, Zhao Xu will have a spellcasting level of 19 + 32 = 51, and this effect will persist even after he leaves the pit, until the spell's duration of 24 hours ends.

Moreover, during this period, Zhao Xu's "chaotic" and "evil" element spells will be treated as having a spellcasting level of 52 * 2 = 104!
Here is the translation of the text:

He couldn't help but shake his head at the eerie atmosphere of this magical web, which felt overwhelmingly intense. If there was a quick way to traverse this place, he felt that the time spent preparing magic every day would need to be elevated to a new level.

This would mean that his "hammer of justice" magic could deal 54D8 damage, combined with the effects of "twin souls" and "strong effect", making it a whopping 1300 HP damage!

As Zhao Xu thought about this, he couldn't help but walk forward with determination.

Ahead of him lay a maze, which looked like a seemingly endless series of interconnected stone platforms. He tentatively tapped on these stone platforms, which were at least 1 meter thick.

At the same time, Zhao Xu subtly observed that the natural patterns on these stones all had some subtle changes, as if those fallen souls were twisted and bound in eternal torment, constantly wailing in sorrow.

He also noticed that the maze's pathways were occasionally interrupted by sticky spider webs, which made him feel a deep sense of discomfort just by looking at them. It was not a place where one could feel at ease.

"Fireball!"

A blazing fireball shot out, directly entering the spider web ahead.

However, the intense heat had no effect on the spider web. After the flames dissipated, the maze walls were left with scorch marks, but the sticky spider web remained unaffected.

Zhao Xu realized that these spider webs were just like the ones recorded, immune to fire, cold, and electric damage.

In the distance, the spider web tunnel was shrouded in a thick haze of smoke, filled with the stench of decay, which enveloped the entire space in darkness, like a giant wave crashing in the depths of the ocean.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

As soon as he recognized it, he realized that once he entered this sealed cloud cluster, he would be exempt from failure and would be sucked into the eternal abyss of chaos.

This scenario was similar to the description of the demon web pit, and he was sure that he was in the "demon web pit". He also knew that the demon web pit was said to be lying at the bottom of countless dark source springs, and it was not an idle rumor.

Compared to the initial "deep abyss" layer, the risk of the demon web pit far exceeded his imagination!

However, this also meant that Zhao Xu could not use the "forced destruction" thought to break through this labyrinth, because one careless move would send him plummeting into these cloud clusters.

After taking a deep breath, Zhao Xu also psyched himself up, clearly realizing that he couldn't afford to be careless.

He quietly mobilized his spatial knowledge to search for key information and eventually obtained the critical information, understanding the key elements of his departure.

Generally, demon web pits often have various metal doors that stand in front of various mysterious passages. Most of these doors lead to foggy areas, but some also lead to half-planes, and even the grand campaign of the Rose's conquest plan, which includes key nodes of the main material plane world.

These areas had already been thoroughly conquered by Rose's slaves, filled with dark spirits, demons, and other slaves. At any moment, they would rush out from the dark regions at Rose's command, launching a death charge against the entire main material plane to open up new territories for their gods and devour more planes.

In general, when exploring the demon web pit, one needs to avoid those clear roads patrolled by the El'gor patrols and the demons and spider-like monsters executing Rose's orders.

Therefore, Zhao Xu was not too worried about this.
Here is the translation of the text:

As he took a few steps, he noticed that some mutated spiders would occasionally crawl out, and they seemed to have an extremely malicious intent, charging towards Zhao Xu.

Zhao Xu took the initiative to kill a few of them, but soon grew impatient.

He directly activated the "Fire Shield" spell from his book, enveloping himself with a 24-hour duration spell "Spell Endurance".

At this moment, a thin layer of flames surrounded his entire body, appearing to be self-immolating at first glance, but in reality, the flames were extremely thin and purple-colored.

As long as any monster attempted to attack him, it would receive 1D6 + level damage from the "Fire Shield".

With Zhao Xu's current abilities, the 1D6 damage was insignificant, like a gentle drizzle.

The key point was the additional level damage, which exceeded 50 points. Generally, weaker monsters would be burned to death on the spot.

After the warm flames appeared, Zhao Xu suddenly felt a malicious intent emanating from the shadows.

But he remained completely unmoved, only gazing intently.

Slowly, a giant deformed spider emerged from the darkness. Its claws were extremely long, and its blue body resembled a super-sized mosquito. Its front claws also had a fearsome hook, with a sharp jaw edge oozing with evil mucus.

It was a Hunting Spider!

Zhao Xu was slightly surprised, not expecting to encounter a Hunting Spider instead of the "Molten Wax Demon" that Rose had sat upon.

The Hunting Spider's body was roughly the size of a horse, and its legs could stretch to three or four meters when spread apart, weighing over 2 tons.

As a creature of its nature, it instinctively attacked all living beings, including other demons, which were its prey. It also devoured a wide variety of species, welcoming all comers.
Here is the translation of the text:

The demonic spider suddenly shot out a spew of web, a vast canopy that covered the sky and earth, blocking all visual lines of sight before Zhao Xu's eyes. Zhao Xu had already deployed the "Free Action" spell, which allowed him to move and attack normally despite being affected by the magical restraint. From paralyzing to slowing down, and even to entangling him, he could automatically escape.

As a demon of only 10 levels, Zhao Xu didn't hesitate at all, quietly freezing in place, observing his surroundings to see if any more demons appeared.

However, he was disappointed to find that there was only one demonic spider. Compared to the mindless variant spiders, this intelligent demonic spider, with an IQ of 11, may not be able to speak, but it could still communicate through telepathy.

Zhao Xu immediately condensed the "Justice Hammer" spell, gathering his strength and only aiming at this demonic spider.

Even without unleashing the spell directly, the intelligent demonic spider felt the terror of the "Justice Hammer", which was almost a thousand times more powerful than any ordinary attack.
It immediately went weak in the legs and knelt down.

Huh? Zhao Xu was slightly taken aback.
He hadn't even attacked yet, and the demonic spider had already surrendered?
Well, the Abyss is a place where betrayal is abundant, and these demons are not known for their loyalty.
Zhao Xu let out a faint sigh and said, "Where am I?"
The demonic spider, which could understand the Abyssal language, immediately understood Zhao Xu's intention and replied telepathically, "Greetings, great wizard."
Here is the translation of the text:

"This is the 'Spider Labyrinth' in the depths of the 'Magic Web', a labyrinth that can confuse and disorient people. It is a place where the great spider goddess cultivates new breeds of evil spirits and monstrous spiders. Occasionally, the goddess's servants will release prisoners deep in the labyrinth to quench the hunger of the spider-like inhabitants."

"In general, creatures from the main material plane cannot reach this place. I don't know how you managed to get here."

Zhao Xu was taken aback, never expecting to find himself in such a place.

He looked around curiously, trying to gather more information. "What are you in charge of here?"

The Hunter Spider replied, "I'm responsible for eradicating failed spider species."

"What notable landmarks are there nearby?" Zhao Xu asked, stamping his foot on the solid floor, as he suspected that famous locations might hold clues.

The Hunter Spider, looking nervous, explained, "There are two notable places nearby. One is the Prison of Roses, where some unkillable existences, either due to their regenerative abilities or charm, are exiled. These beings are said to be the enemies of the Rose Goddess."

"It's a world with a diameter of 600 meters, flat and small, with five small suns shining brightly in the dark starry sky. I once escorted prisoners into this place, where a giant bone statue guards some imprisoned prisoners."

Zhao Xu's curiosity was piqued. "What's the other one?"
Here is the translation of the text:

"It is the entrance to the Ulgarshak, a massive stone building that sits near the main path. Rumor has it that strange noises can be heard coming from inside, and that anything placed on top of it will be consumed and digested. Since its birth, I have heard of its terrifying reputation."

"All of these materials will eventually be transported to the Ulgarshak, a strange and bottomless abyssal layer. Some claim it is the 92nd layer, and that it is a living layer."

Zhao Xu's eyes widened slightly as he heard the story.

He had heard rumors about the Ulgarshak before.

According to legend, the layer was composed of the internal organs of gigantic, unimaginable creatures. Blood vessels flowed like rivers, transporting organic matter, while organs hung like fruit in the distance, constantly secreting corrosive liquids onto the living floor.

Just looking at the description was like gazing into the abdominal region of a massive monster.

The main points were similar to the characteristics of a terrifying world, leaving a deep impression on him.

The arachnid hunter continued to say, "The followers of the goddess Roshe often use it as a high-efficiency waste disposal site, or a place of execution for prisoners."

Zhao Xu urged, "Take me there."

However, the arachnid hunter shook his head and said, "I have a seal imposed by the goddess on my body and dare not leave this place on my own."

Zhao Xu shook his head and said, "Don't worry, just take me to the transmission point with the lowest pressure in the labyrinth."

A faint intuition told him that the Ulgarshak entrance was full of strange and mysterious things.
