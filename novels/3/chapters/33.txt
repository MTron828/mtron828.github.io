Chapter 34: Character Card
"You're now a 1st-level mage," Anniya said, looking at Zhao Xü with a smile.
Zhao Xü had been waiting for this moment for a long time, and he felt a sense of excitement and nervousness. He had been thinking about the ceremony all day and wondering if it would be successful.

Zhao Xü's plan was going smoothly, and he felt relieved. He took a deep breath and looked at Anniya, waiting for her next instruction.

"You can now focus your attention, and you will see a character card appear in your mind," Anniya explained.

Zhao Xü already knew this. The reason why Arthur said it was a quantifiable world was that once someone succeeded in their 1st-level job, they could see their character card.

In this world, everyone had a numerical system, like having a number of fingers. This was why players could still use their skills even after a year of crossing over.

When a person was born, they were equivalent to a 1st-level civilian, and civilians couldn't see their character card. However, players had the special ability to see their character card before reaching level 1 and could freely distribute their attributes.

Anniya began to explain the basics of character cards to Zhao Xü, who listened intently, his mind focused.

"After you level up, you should be able to see your life value," Anniya said.

Zhao Xü directly scanned his brain for the character card.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Life: Current HP 6/6
Basic life value 6 = 4 (profession) + 2 (constitution)
Life dice type: D4 wizard"
He currently has 6 life points, with 2 points coming from his constitution adjustment value and 4 points coming from his wizard life dice.

First-level professionals can directly add life dice, without rolling.
However, when leveling up later, you can only add the value of the D4 dice, which is a random number between 1 and 4, or 1-12 for D12.
However, constitution adjustment values can be stacked once per level, which is also the reason why Zhao Xu spent 6 points to upgrade his attribute to 14 points.
If a player does not spend points, the starting attribute will be -1, and the life value will be reduced by 1 point.
Compared to other professions with D12, D10, and D8 dice types, wizards and mages with D4 dice types are naturally weaker at the beginning, making them more vulnerable to death.
Zhao Xu, the Earth player, was initially confused and thought that life value referred to the concept of blood volume, but after recovering from his mistake, he realized that his understanding was incorrect.
Annie did not scold him, but instead shook her head lightly, saying, "Life value is not a measure of how strong or weak someone is. Even if you die and become a skeleton, your life value will still be calculated according to the skeleton's life value, regardless of your past life as a legendary warrior."
"Remember, life value is the ability of each person to withstand damage."
Here is the translation:

"One fireball can wipe out a group of civilians, but a high-level warrior can withstand it because he has enough life points to absorb that damage."

"Additionally, we truly die not when our life points reach zero, but when they reach -10. Between 0 and -10, we will be paralyzed and can only wait for our allies to rescue us."

As Anzio explained, Zhao Xu nodded his head in agreement.

Zhao Xu continued to look at his character panel, where he noticed the "immunity" data, which appeared after he became a mage.

Tenacity: 2 = 0 (profession) + 2 (physical strength)
Reaction: 1 = 0 (profession) + 1 (agility)
Willpower: 4 = 2 (profession) + 2 (perception)

Tenacity immunity assesses one's ability to resist physical challenges, such as poison or toxin.
Reaction immunity assesses one's ability to dodge certain attacks, such as fireballs.
Willpower immunity assesses one's mental resistance to certain mental attacks, such as charms.

As a 1st-level mage, Zhao Xu's willpower only had a 2-point profession bonus.

Normally, once these three values reach a certain level, they can resist most attacks.

Arthur usually assigns a difficulty level to any ability that can be checked by immunity. These three immunities can be added to a difficulty level of 1-20, as long as the result exceeds the difficulty level, they can pass smoothly. Once immunity values exceed difficulty levels, they will basically not fail.

"Just give you a preliminary explanation of these two concepts, and then we'll discuss specialties," Anzio said at the end.

As soon as Zhao Xu heard these words, he suddenly looked up, knowing that the previous content was important.
Here is the translation of the text:

"First of all, what is expertise?" asked Zhao Xu.

Zhao Xu's pupils constricted. "Personality ability."

"Strictly speaking, it's linked to each person's spiritual ability."

"In reality, you can acquire expertise through training, but this will consume your spiritual energy. Each person's spiritual energy is fixed and can be upgraded at 1 level and its multiples."

"Meanwhile, as humans, we are naturally endowed with a compensatory spiritual energy that corresponds to one type of expertise."

As Zhao Xu heard these words, he finally understood the truth about expertise. He realized that the origin and purpose of expertise were unknown to them, and that only upgrading could unlock its true potential.

The forum also had different opinions on this topic.

"If you start with the 'Copy Scroll' expertise and then awaken as a 'Wise Heart' and become a mage, the 'Copy Scroll' expertise will occupy 1 level of your spiritual energy."

"Teacher, didn't you say it would be forgotten?" Zhao Xu suddenly remembered what Anzephyr had explained to him earlier.

"I finally believe you don't have 16 points of intelligence, 'Copy Scroll' is only possible for 1-level mages, and forgetting is only possible if you become a mage later."

As Anzephyr sneered, Zhao Xu's face turned bright red.

"How many unallocated expertise do you have?" Anzephyr continued.

Zhao Xu didn't even bother to look at his character panel and proudly replied, "Four."
Here is the translation of the text:

"Hmm? Do you have additional spiritual compensation?" Anshen Yao's divination magic could see Zhao Xu's state abilities, but since he hadn't chosen it yet, it was definitely invisible.

"I have two defects, and I can choose two more specialties," Zhao Xu replied.

Earlier, he thought that defecting to specialties was quite magical, but now that he knew it was corresponding to spiritual abilities, it made a lot more sense.

"Good luck, kid, many people have defects, but it's not necessarily guaranteed to have spiritual compensation."

"However, that's fine now, you have four specialties, so I'll ask you, do you want to freely cast spells without the daily preparation limit?"

As he heard this, Zhao Xu's heart began to race, and he could do this? Freely casting spells? He wouldn't even need to prepare talismans.

This isn't a mage, but a god of magic, right?
