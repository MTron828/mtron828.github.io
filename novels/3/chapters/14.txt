Chapter 15: Hidden Potential

"Can your mentor's magic still be effective?" Zhao Xu asked delicately, secretly asking about the other person's age.

He had already subconsciously suspected something.

The temporary beauty spell, as seen in Western ancient legends, didn't seem like a benevolent spell.

"Age is a secret of magic," Anisya laughed lightly, "but I've never used a temporary beauty spell."

Hearing this, Zhao Xu chuckled, pretending to be joking like a three-year-old.

If there was a non-magical way to keep one's youth, all women would go crazy.

"Time has no mark," Anisya said.

Zhao Xu didn't understand what Anisya was saying.

"A ninth-level spell, using an artifact as a medium, allows the receiver to permanently fix their physical state and age. My mentor cast this spell on me before I turned 20, so I've remained the same age and appearance ever since."

"However, the price is that this body cannot grow old, and the mind will also be locked. If a child is cast with this spell, they will remain a child in mind unless they remove the artifact. So, I've been thinking of taking off the necklace for a few years, allowing myself to grow up a few years, otherwise, this face will indeed look childish."

Zhao Xu swallowed hard after listening to the other person's words.

He couldn't believe that without legendary magic, a ninth-level spell could already have a way to achieve immortality with almost no side effects.

And it was a method that was strong in operation, almost without any side effects.

It seemed that the legendary mage was indeed unreasonable.
Here is the translation of the text:

As Zhao Xu thought about it, his desire to become a high-level mage intensified. His parents and future partner all needed this kind of magic. "Now is the time for an opportunity," he said, "I can cast this spell on you."

Suddenly, An Ti Nuo Ya's tone became solemn. Zhao Xu also became more solemn.

The other party's words were actually saying: an almost zero-sequela eternal life opportunity is being placed before you.

"Don't know what price I'll have to pay for it?" Zhao Xu said.

There's no free lunch in the world, and since his dual-elite identity was exposed, he seemed to be pulled into a whirlpool.

He was being silently watched.

Some players who were similar to him might think this was part of the game's storyline. But Arthur was a real existence. Even the gods were paying attention to them, let alone the various powers in Arthur's world. So, the investment in players has never stopped.

The native Arthrurians didn't care about the fairness of other players. But to An Ti Nuo Ya's price tag - eternal life in the game - might seem ridiculous to other players. Wasn't it just a meaningless reward?

However, Zhao Xu was clear about what this meant. If this world was real, then his eternal life was also real.

"Join our organization. When we need you, you'll act in line with our ideals," An Ti Nuo Ya said.

Zhao Xu was perplexed. "What organization is this?"

"The Mage Association headquarters?" he said, only to reject himself.

In general, the vast majority of mages would join the Mage Association, paying membership fees to facilitate the exchange and recording of spells and the purchase of magic materials.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

When Zhao Xu becomes a 1st-level mage, he will automatically become a member and be exempt from paying membership fees for three years. This way, you won't need to go through all the trouble.

To cast a 9th-level spell, the cost of the service fee is 1,500 gold coins, and for cold magic, you'll need to add more money. This eternal magic is estimated to be quite expensive, and it's unlikely that it can be done for less than 10,000 gold coins.

However, most people are stopped by the barrier of recognizing the "sage who has no trace of time" and being willing to spend money on magic.

The Mage Association also has many factions, and our organization is called "The Final Scroll".

Zhao Xu's face suddenly changed color, and he quickly flipped through the books in his hand, re-reading the records on the first few pages.

It is said that the secrets of magic were first recorded on a scroll.

The first owner of this scroll was Sisilvina, the Goddess of Magic.

The scroll automatically records all magic in the world, including legendary spells.

Those who master it will automatically master all magic in the world and can even research legendary magic through it.

However, the reason why everyone is so eager for this scroll is that once someone reads the final secret of the scroll, they can replace the Goddess of Magic and become the true God of Magic.

The name of this scroll is "The Final Scroll".

The organization of The Final Scroll was established to protect this scroll.

Since the scroll involves secrets that transcend divinity, it cannot be taken away from the main plane of existence or sealed in the Goddess of Magic's domain.

Zhao Xu suddenly felt his shoulder weight increasing.

He actually just wanted to level up well and protect his family in the future turmoil.
Here is the translation of the text:

Who would have thought that I would suddenly become involved with such an extraordinary organization.

The Magic Goddess is renowned as the most powerful and influential deity, with the highest level of divine power and the largest following among all gods. This is undoubtedly a major league.

Zhao Xu noticed the goddess's attention towards him and without hesitation, he switched his allegiance from a mortal to a divine being, also because of this reason.

However, he didn't dare to join the forces of good or evil, nor did he dare to attempt to obtain the "Ultimate Scroll". For behind every plot to obtain the scroll, there is bound to be a deity or an underworld force.

Zhao Xu was only thinking of shouting from the sidelines and stirring up some trouble, but he didn't expect to suddenly reach the core.

Suddenly, he realized why that black-robed wizard told him he would become a priest.

God is not all-powerful, but a priest is the embodiment of God's will.

The connection between a priest and God is the strongest.

Every priest, no matter where they are in the world, can precisely locate their deity.

Even if they are shielded by magic, this connection is above magic.

Therefore, the goddess needs him to be a priest.

However, a premise has been raised again: "Why me?"

Zhao Xu had become very rational at this moment.

He wasn't even a 1st-level mage.

Investing in a high-potential stock is something that big powers may do.

However, the Ultimate Scroll is a special force that doesn't require expanding its scope.

In fact, many small matters can be handled by the Mage Association headquarters or the goddess's church.

What they need is top-notch mages, even legendary mages who can fight.

The outstanding students in elementary school may be chosen, but those in middle school won't be considered, let alone those in high school.
Here is the translation of the text:

"My twin geniuses will undoubtedly make me more powerful, but for organizations like yours that are already at the pinnacle, it's probably just that much. My twin geniuses, Zhao Xu, can achieve the ultimate dual cultivation at an extremely low cost. For many organizations, it's a treasure to cultivate one person, and the return on investment is twice the cost. But it also depends on who you are. In the end, an organization like this is equivalent to the last reliance of the goddess of magic in this world. Not to mention the nine-level legends, legendary mages and legendary priests are all lacking. 'Potential point.'" Anniya suddenly said.
