Chapter 419: The Double Demon Statue

Zhao Xu's attack was successful, but the damage was too low and was immediately nullified by the opponent's damage reduction ability.

He rubbed his head, looking a bit too optimistic.

Although it was just a two-fold increase, he didn't try to stack it again.

Because, in his intuition, the 25 HP damage was already a top-tier damage output for a player adventurer.

It means that even with thousands of ordinary troops, it's impossible to take down this golden demon statue.

As for the silver demon statue, it also swung its magical silver giant sword, but it encountered the same problem.

Every time it poked open the golden demon statue's body, the severed part would immediately heal, like a novice's reckless behavior.

He shook his head, signaling the silver demon statue to hand over the sword.

At this moment, the enormous giant sword was pointed at Zhao Xu, less than half a meter from his head.

Zhao Xu took out a piece of rabbit skin and blocked the sword point, then cast the spell "Self-Enhance Weapon".

He had used this spell before, directly adding a minute-level special ability to his talismanic staff.

As long as the bonus value did not exceed "+1" or 5000 gold coins, he had paired it with the "Frenzied Damage Multiplier" ability.

Instantly, the silver demon statue's giant sword emitted a golden glow, coated with a lubricating oil-like substance.

It's like a priest's spell "Magic Weapon" or "Camp Weapon" that is often used to add to weapons to break through damage reduction weaknesses.
Here is the translation of the text:

As a demon, Veve has the ability to reduce damage by 10 points with a cold iron or benevolent weapon.

Others need to use a cold iron or benevolent weapon to break through Veve's 10-point damage reduction.

The secret silver puppet in Zhao Xuan's hand transforms into a golden puppet, and then instantly cuts off the golden puppet's head, as sharp as cutting vegetables.

After several rounds, accompanied by countless sparks and deafening iron sounds.

The golden puppet's body is directly disassembled into unrecognizable pieces by someone's eyes.

The mysterious symbols inside the golden puppet's body also begin to scatter out, slowly spreading out, and Zhao Xuan quickly pulls out his own "yellow copper ball".

As the symbols' power converges on it, it slowly changes shape.

Finally, with a clear and crisp sound, the golden puppet statue falls to the ground, and Zhao Xuan bends down to pick it up.

The secret silver puppet also shrinks under Zhao Xuan's command, slowly transforming into a small metal figurine that can be held in the palm of the hand.

At this moment, Zhao Xuan gently holds the two metal figurines.

These two legendary creatures respectively represent the pinnacle of magical technology.

Zhao Xuan holds the two figurines with one hand, and suddenly the two figurines merge into a single, compact form.

However, what about transmission? The area where Zhao Xuan stands is the weakest part of the dense fog area.

He has already defeated the big BOSS, but he still hasn't sent him out to the next stage.

Just now, during the process of passing through the dense fog, he found that the fog carried a disease, which would cause physical harm if inhaled.

Zhao Xuan relied on his "energy protection" spell to avoid damage. Veve, on the other hand, relied on divine protection to absorb and endure the damage.

The will long, here," Vivian whispered suddenly.

She was standing at the initial position of the golden statue.

Below her standing position, there was a hidden stone plate that was difficult to see.

Thanks to her excellent search skills, she finally discovered it.

"Let me try to get up?" Vivian asked.

"Okay."

Zhao Xu nodded, and he had plenty of tricks up his sleeve. He was confident that he could still save Vivian.

Most adventurers would think carefully and summon something or find an alternative in such a situation. But Zhao Xu and Vivian were bold and confident.

As the stone platform was pressed, it suddenly sank about half a foot.

Immediately, the hidden ventilation shaft in the mysterious space opened, slowly sucking out the toxic gases.

The restricted view also cleared up instantly.

At the same time, a living door in front of them was opened, and a teleportation portal gradually rose.

Zhao Xu's eyes narrowed as he noticed a special key hanging on the doorframe.

He remembered that the key was similar to the one on the stone slab behind the stone tablet in the original entrance.

The key was actually hanging on the teleportation portal, not on his statue. However, this also meant that he had already opened the first door.

After bringing a golden treasure box, Zhao Xu relied on defeating the monsters to evolve into a silver and golden statue each.

In fact, the rewards from these legendary statues exceeded any previous achievement.

Now, Zhao Xu could easily defeat enemies with a single blow, whether they were surrounded by a large army or were a giant monster.

The problem was...

What is the relationship between those five copper treasure boxes and this Aizhu Palace? Especially, why are the curses given by May on Earth similar to the inscriptions on these copper treasure boxes? Are they from the same source?

As the broadcast ended, adventurers began to arrive one by one, their bodies showing no significant signs of damage, but all were coughing from the thick smoke in the explosion area. "What's going on?" one of them asked.

If they hadn't seen it with their own eyes, this team would have been hard-pressed to imagine that a massive, over a thousand meters wide and deep pit would suddenly appear before them.

Even a devout pastor knelt down, praying to the divine. In the center of the pit, smoke billowed, and occasional sounds of molten rock bubbling underground could be heard.

One of the adventurers tried to drop a stone, and after a few seconds, the sound of it hitting the ground reached his ears. He shook his head, saying, "At least 10 meters deep."

"So, the 'Aizhu Palace' where higher-order divine artifacts are hidden, is actually located in the midst of this thick fog?" the team leader pointed forward, drawing everyone's attention to the distance.

This team was the infamous Scarlet Team, an unofficial paramilitary group affiliated with the nearby town, responsible for eliminating monsters in the wild and receiving rewards according to their mission. In their free time, they would execute their own missions.

As players joined the team, the Scarlet Team also began to accept ordinary players as team members.

This time, due to the urgency of their arrival, only a few Earth players who happened to be present joined the team.

Who knows that after the warning in that area, all the warhorses were terrified and unable to advance even a single step towards the center of the explosive crater.

So the team leader had to let some people lead the warhorses back, while the remaining main force of the team rushed to this location.

"It's tough, how do we get through, the edge of this crater is still hot, and it must be even hotter inside," said a professional expert in the auxiliary profession, while starting to assess the situation and think about what could be built.

The team leader also furrowed his brow deeply, and if there was no anti-magic field, they wouldn't be so troubled. They wanted to avoid the boiling magma that had already erupted from the stone heap and safely enter the explosive center, which seemed difficult.

"This damn anti-magic field!" exclaimed a team member, unable to contain his frustration.

"No problem," the team leader said, looking at the team members who had arrived here and were somewhat fatigued, and quickly rallied them.

"If there was no anti-magic field, with an explosion of this scale, this place would have been sealed off by mages and others long ago. Where would we have gotten the chance to drink this bitter soup?" he said.

As he spoke, it seemed as if they had been stimulated by a higher-order artifact, and the eyes of each person shone with a brilliant light.

The higher-order artifact, establishing a territory, seemed to be equivalent to a done deal.

"Who?" suddenly shouted the scout who had been guarding the perimeter, pulling out the dagger on his belt.

At this moment, about ten adventurers slowly emerged from a thick cloud of smoke.

They were all dressed in intricately embroidered leather armor, but were generally badly damaged, with fragments held together by thin threads. Even the red streaks on their faces were unclear whether they were from dye or fresh blood, indicating that they had been through a fierce battle.

"What's the Iron Hand Brotherhood?" the leader of the Red Squad exclaimed in surprise as he looked at the group of people in front of him.

The reason for his surprise was that all the people in front of him had their left hands chopped off at the wrist and replaced with iron hooks.

He knew that the Iron Hand Brotherhood, an organization that trained orphaned children to become assassins, was not to be trifled with. Even with his own squad numbers doubled, he felt like he was facing an enemy.

"There's nothing to it, we just suffered heavy losses and want to borrow some equipment and supplies from you," said the leader of the Iron Hand Brotherhood, a cold and calculating man in his mid-40s with a patch over his right eye.

After the massive explosion that had devastated nearly the entire Twilight Forest, only these ruthless individuals dared to venture into the area.

"You think it's possible?" the Red Squad's leader flatly refused.

Originally, magical items were the first line of defense, but now, in this anti-magic zone, their armor was their greatest asset.

"I can prove to you just how sharp our iron hands are. You who have lost hands are not worth much," said the middle-aged man from the Iron Hand Brotherhood, knowing that without replenishing their equipment, they would be doomed to die.

"That's for you to try," he said, and the two teams on either side of him seemed to be on the verge of combat.

"Someone's climbing up there, it looks like they're heading towards the entrance," someone suddenly shouted loudly.

Just then, a strong gust of wind blew through, dispersing the thick smoke and revealing the full view of the central area.
Here is the translation of the text:

In an instant, the two sides that were about to engage in combat both looked towards that direction, implying that there might be countless adventure teams like theirs within a two-kilometer radius of the deep pit's edge.

Just as the man was about to smile and flex his muscles, ready to climb up, this region within a 50-kilometer radius heard the same heavenly divine sound again.

"'The first tier seal of the Aido Castle: the secret of the demon's seal, unsealed.'"
"'The remaining seals of the Aido Castle: five.'"
"'The personnel who unsealed the seals: Summer (Mage), Vivian (Holy Warrior).'"

The man's eyes widened in shock, and he suddenly lost his grip and slid down from this smooth fortress, falling into the molten lava, and a blood-curdling scream echoed throughout the land.

This sound also lingered in the hearts of every adventurer who participated in the event, resonating for a long time.
