Chapter 609: The Mysterious Knowledge of the 86th Step

"'Olympus Crystal'?" said Naomi, looking around at the team of over 50 people, all of whom were staring at her with a mixture of curiosity and skepticism.

Only Zhao Xu's brow furrowed slightly, indicating that he had grasped the gravity of the situation.

Naomi continued, "At the time, we encountered those skeletons with mysterious crystals on their bodies. After identification, we found out that they were 'Olympus Crystals'."

"It's possible that the skeletons, who were unaware and unconscious, simply passed by a certain area and brought these crystals back with them."

Naomi's tone turned serious, and her expression was stern, making it clear that this matter involved more than just a trivial issue.

Zhao Xu was also slightly surprised, as he had never heard of Naomi and "Olympus Crystals" having any connection to each other.

The only variable left was the 10th-level mage, Zhong Xia, who had just appeared.

Zhao Xu's "butterfly effect" caused by his time travel was becoming increasingly apparent.

However, Naomi's words still left everyone with a sense of mystery and curiosity.

The young mage who had just wanted to exchange spells shook his head, saying, "My knowledge and skills are a mess. I couldn't find any information on this."

The female mage, Qing Li, also shook her head, saying, "As someone who focuses on logistics and likes to read, my main knowledge and skills are not applicable. Even with over 10 levels of knowledge, I haven't gained any new insights."

This revelation only added to everyone's amazement.

It was known that 10th-level skills could break through 30-level mysteries.

Suddenly, a curious old man who loved to wander around opened his mouth and asked, "What is this Olympian crystal thing? How much is it worth?"

Arthur's magical items numbered in the thousands, and in the entire magical creation system, they possessed "repeatability" and "uniformity".

Regardless of whether it was Anniya or Zhāo Xuérén using "manufacturing wonders", unless they had other skills that could reduce the cost, the official price of materials in the Association's system would require at least 1750 gold coins to purchase the "invisible powder" material, and then it could be used to manufacture it.

The resale price of the finished product was 3500 gold coins.

Therefore, everyone would ask about the "system price" in the wizard's association, although they might not be able to buy it at this price, it was a good reference point and would not fluctuate due to region or season.

Nalurüya, however, made a cryptic remark, "We've mobilized personnel, including myself, to investigate because the value of the Olympian crystal has exceeded everyone's imagination. We suspect that there may be a natural crystal mine below."

"You, Star Wizard, seem to be aware of the details. Why don't you explain how it works?" Zhāo Xuérén was taken aback by this sudden rebuttal.

Zhāo Xuérén had indeed heard Anniya mention the Olympian crystal a few times before, but had never delved deeper into it.

The main reason was that Zhāo Xuérén didn't really need this thing.

However, at this moment, Zhāo Xuérén was someone else entirely.

In the real fantasy world, he had once gone to the True Fantasy Realm with Wang Kèngwēi and Aixuǐxī, and with just a few dozen levels of knowledge, he had been able to level up his knowledge to the 20-30th level, ultimately unlocking his potential and breaking through the bottleneck.
Here is the translation of the text:

As a master of all knowledge and skills, Zhao Xu is equivalent to being born with the abilities of "Baidu" and "KnowNet". The Olympian crystal belongs to the category of "mysterious knowledge".

At this moment, Zhao Xu's knowledge (mysterious) has reached the maximum level of 13 (personality level + 3), combined with a 9-point intelligence adjustment, the skills of his mysterious knowledge have a level of 22.

He also has the "Divine Knowledge" spell, which adds 10 levels to all knowledge skills.

As a result, his daily mysterious knowledge skills have exceeded 30 levels. When facing general questions, he can easily communicate by linking the knowledge domain.

Now, Zhao Xu is also excited to face this question.

The Olympian crystal subtly involves "dragon crystal", which is a product left behind by the creative giant dragon "Arthur", even involving the ancient secret "Dragon Prophecy".

The secrets born from the earth are terrifying. Even he has to put in all his effort to explore the secrets.

Zhao Xu also directly displays his spell in front of everyone, confidently and without hesitation.

However, he shamelessly uses his "supernatural" ability to save the incantation and posture, making it impossible for the few spellcasters present, even with the "Spell Identification" skill, to understand what spell he has cast.

【Adventurer Zhong Xia, you have cast a one-ring spell "Skill Enhancement" on the "Intelligence Headpiece" and specified the mysterious knowledge skill, gaining an 18-level environmental bonus (2+level/2), lasting 10 minutes per level】
After the spellcasting, the Intelligence Headpiece suddenly fed Zhao Xu with an endless amount of mysterious knowledge, and in an instant, he felt that his head was about to be compressed by the influx of knowledge to the point of explosion.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

However, Zhao Xu continued to suppress his emotions and used his latent ability to recover his super natural magic usage frequency. Then, he cast the spell.

【Adventure Summer, you cast the "Knowledge Song" spell on yourself, specifying the "Mystery" skill, and gain a 20-level performance bonus (4 + level / 2), lasting for 24 hours (spell duration).]

At the same time, Zhao Xu had a permanent spell, "Improvisation", on his body, which allowed him to use lucky points to enhance his attack, evasion, and skill in three major directions. Each time, he could increase the spell level by half (16-level lucky bonus).

Among the total lucky points, there were twice the caster's level (66 points).

Therefore, when Zhao Xu made a knowledge check, his knowledge (Mystery) reached 13 (profession) + 9 (intelligence) + 10 (perception) + 18 (environment) + 20 (performance) + 16 (luck) = 86 levels.

In an instant, everyone saw the lonely star wizard's eyes flash with intricate arcane characters, carrying infinite magical power, as if it were a boundless ocean of knowledge, stretching out to the horizon.

The 86-level knowledge (Mystery) level allowed him to search for knowledge about ancient ring, twelve-ring spells, and even ancient knowledge, although it lacked specific incantation models.

In an instant, a paper on the origin and development of "Olin Crystal" was placed in front of Zhao Xu, with a length of over 3000 words.

He slightly lowered his head and adjusted his non-existent glasses.

This seemingly adjusting posture action, facilitated by 29 points of supernatural intelligence, allowed him to read the entire paper from start to finish without any gaps.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

If he could master the surge of divine power, he could immediately cast the two spells he had just learned, and seamlessly connect them, answering questions in an instant like a sage who has grasped infinite mysterious knowledge. However, at present, he seems to be thinking carefully before recalling something.

Zhao Xu gazed at "Naluria" and her entourage behind her, sighed, and said, "I'm afraid you'll be disappointed." Although the opposing side had a consultant who was equally skilled as a first-rate wizard, this could only ensure that Naluria would not make mistakes in basic magical items. When it came to secrets of this world, the opposing side would definitely be in the dark.

This was a mysterious knowledge worth 100 levels! "Olin Crystal is essentially something you can understand as a magical item," Zhao Xu said, waving his hand. "You know that most magical items are created by wizards with their own hands, and there are no natural mineral deposits that produce them."

When he said this, including Naluria, everyone on the opposing side was shocked, unable to believe this. It's worth noting that facing the aftermath of the big shockwave, ordinary people on Earth would face a catastrophic crisis, and the upper-class elite would lose everything they had. However, players like Naluria, who were born with accumulated experience, were essentially "predestined nobles" without a doubt.

As long as they didn't act recklessly, they were destined for a luxurious life. But they still had to venture into this mysterious cave, and the "Olin Crystal" represented an irresistible temptation.
Here is the translation of the text:

At present, they are like those who have just been informed that the gold mine just excavated from the mine is actually a set of lost jewelry left behind by someone. And that mine is not a gold mine.

"Ah?" Naliru also couldn't help but turn pale.

She took out this secret with a big smile, naturally realizing the enormity of this cave, thinking of using this "lure" to keep everyone united and going out together, and also borrowing the help of these strong individuals to develop it.

Who would have thought that just as she opened her mouth, she became like a fleeting flower and the moon in the water.

"Alone, you can explain it to me, right?" the female mage, Feiyu, quickly stepped forward to support Naliru, "I'm also a mage who specializes in knowledge and skills, and I only knew the effect of the Olympian crystal through the 'identification technique', so I don't know how you, Lone Star Mage, know about it?"

Instantly, everyone's gaze shifted back to Zhao Xu, awaiting his explanation.

Zhao Xu smiled and began to explain: "First, let me explain the effect of the Olympian crystal."

"It is essentially a dragon crystal or a magic item made from a dragon crystal. Then, mages can use the 'seal technique' to imprint magic on it."

"Therefore, it can essentially serve as a blank magic book, with approximately 500 pages if converted to pages."

Compared to the opponent's narration, Zhao Xu took out a "mysterious dragon crystal" with a deep red spiral pattern, about the size of a fist.

"This is the 'Olympian crystal' I'm holding, and using this Olympian crystal to imprint magic requires 24 hours of simultaneous use, without consuming recording materials."
Here is the translation:

"Recording a page of magic, even if you don't consider the cost of borrowing through book rental, it's estimated that the average cost of ink, specially designed goose quill pens, and stimulation ointment per page is around 100 gold coins.
500 pages, which is equivalent to saving 50,000 gold coins!
"Ah, I don't know how much this magic book is worth," a player from the same merchant family asked with a trembling voice.
Everyone realized this point!
"6250 gold coins," Zhao Xu replied.
As soon as he spoke, the entire hall was shocked!"
