Chapter 131: Combat Power Test

After reaching the legendary level, knowledgeable individuals of the ancient tomes can also master legendary spells. However, this does not make Zhao Xu powerful at present.

But it does make him realize one thing: only legendary individuals of the ancient tomes can pass on this powerful profession to others.

It's just like how every priest has a divine being standing on their head. Similarly, every individual of the ancient tomes, regardless of whether they have a background or not, represents their inevitable interaction with legendary individuals of the ancient tomes and their experience of watching them summon "Ancient Slate" with legendary spells.

After becoming a formal scholar of the ancient tomes, Zhao Xu woke up the next morning in the pagoda, and he had already acquired the spellcasting position of the ancient tomes.

Scholars of the ancient tomes do not have domain spells like priests, but their spellcasting positions will not be few.

For example, after becoming a 1st-level scholar of the ancient tomes, Zhao Xu had acquired 3 zero-level spellcasting positions and 3 1st-level spellcasting positions from the ancient tomes.

When combined with the spellcasting positions of mages and priests, he essentially had 10 zero-level spellcasting positions and 9 1st-level spellcasting positions.

With the ability to merge zero-level spells into 1st-level spells, Zhao Xu could cast as many as 14 1st-level spells.

Compared to the 1st-level mages of the present day, Zhao Xu's combat power had increased by 5-7 times.

Zhao Xu did not intentionally improve his knowledge (mysterious) skills or use reading magic spells during these two days, and he did not use the spellcasting positions of mages and priests either.

So, he only spent 1 hour in the morning preparing the spellcasting positions of the ancient tomes.
Here is the translation of the text:

After obtaining his profession, Zhao Xu's primary goal is to enhance his mage skills, while his secondary goal is to enhance his scroll skills. In essence, he has almost reached the maximum level of a priest. When he becomes more advanced, he estimates that he will start to abandon preparing priest spells and focus only on mage and scroll skills.

As a priest, he has already acquired strong skills in skills such as healing, area of effect, and spontaneous casting. He thinks that even the high-level mage, Rayne, would not be able to look down on him.

Zhao Xu originally planned to conduct a strength test at the research facility in the Tower of the Morning Sun. Previously, after becoming a formal mage and priest, Anaestria sent him outside to train, allowing him to directly practice spellcasting to test his skills.

However, until he reaches level 5, he is not allowed to leave Mistral, and he is no longer a novice who needs Anaestria's guidance to practice spellcasting. Zhao Xu can now go directly to the strength testing room in the Floating City or the Tower of the Morning Sun to test his spellcasting abilities.

However, Anaestria has not yet appeared, and Zhao Xu dare not enter the testing room by himself, as it is guarded by legendary creatures. Zhao Xu carefully studied the map of the Floating City and noticed that the reception hall for testing is not far from the Tower of the Morning Sun.

This time, Zhao Xu was more cautious and carefully checked the manual, which indicated that entering the testing hall requires a testing certificate. Each test consumes various materials and energy, so the Floating City provides a limited number of testing certificates to each resident mage every month as a small benefit.
Here is the translation of the text:

The testing facility is a place where even theoretical researchers can use. Especially, the experimental labs of renowned scholars are equipped according to the research topics. Sometimes, it's just to verify a small theoretical concept, and they borrow equipment from other researchers. It's more convenient to directly spend a testing coupon to conduct the experiment at the strength testing facility.

However, An Tiya didn't consider purchasing the necessary equipment when she set up her facility. She naturally wouldn't give Zhao Xu a testing coupon.

Thinking about this, Zhao Xu couldn't help but ponder. Last time, he didn't know why the ninth-grade scholar, Nochi, retreated from him, but Zhao Xu still honestly stored his secret silver chip after the lecture.

In his opinion, flaunting the badge of "I'm awesome, step aside" is actually quite foolish. Zhao Xu didn't want to exercise his privileges in the floating city.

As a result, he and An Tiya discussed it occasionally, and almost every day, the lecture tickets would be sent to An Tiya's office.

Suddenly, Zhao Xu remembered that the disposal box in the waiting room needed to be emptied daily, waiting for the automatic destruction. This explained that An Tiya, the legendary scholar, would receive regular batches of testing coupons, which would then be discarded.

Thinking about yesterday when An Tiya asked him to throw away a bunch of things, Zhao Xu hurried to the corner of the room where the disposal box was located. After opening the lid, the spell lock device automatically started, and the entire magical box lost its power.

This box, which was normally able to manipulate the separation of documents, could sever all the data inside. It was a very expensive and powerful paper shredder.
Here is the translation of the text:

As Zhao Xuan looked at the pile of junk papers in the box, he quickly started searching through them. "Is this an invitation to the Punk family banquet?" he muttered to himself, recognizing the familiar logo. He glanced at it briefly and then tossed it aside.

"Internal newsletter of the Association, level 9 clearance," he read, his eyes scanning the document before tossing it into the corner. After flipping through seven or eight documents, he finally found what he was looking for.

It wasn't that he was sharp-eyed, but rather that it was a thick stack of "Combat Test Vouchers" that caught his attention. The only notation on the voucher was that it allowed access to the legendary-level combat testing room.

Zhao Xuan didn't think too much about it and simply ripped off the top sheet, preparing to use it.

The combat testing room was one of the largest buildings in Floating City, only slightly shorter than the bell tower. According to the manual, the room had 13 floors, with each floor having undergone spatial modifications.

The first nine floors were designated for one-ring to nine-ring mages, while floors 10 to 13 were reserved for legendary mages.

Compared to the lecture hall, more mages came to the combat testing room, with new mages making up the majority.

For these new mages, there was no problem doing so, as they could test out their spells and see the effects. However, new mages' spell slots were extremely limited, with most of them using up their spells and having to leave.

As Zhao Xuan gazed at the crowd in front of him and the security personnel at the entrance, he felt a sense of disorientation.

He almost thought he had arrived at an Earthly landmark, wondering if these mages were trying to fish for trouble, which was why Floating City had deliberately set up such a system.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu waited in line until he reached the front, then handed his testing ticket to the staff member in front of him. Who knew that the staff member's expression changed directly after taking the ticket, and he glanced at Zhao Xu's robe again. It was indeed a wizard of the first circle without a doubt.

"This wizard, please wait for a moment, I'll go consult with my superior," the staff member said before hurrying to the office area.

Although Zhao Xu had taken off his badge when he went out this morning, he still wore the robe of the first circle wizard intentionally, not wanting to be misunderstood.

However, it seemed that there would be no misunderstanding now.

After a while, a stout-looking young apprentice with a round belly followed the staff member to where Zhao Xu was sitting.

"Does the honorable sir need to take a test in a specific area?" the superior asked in a low voice, looking at Zhao Xu.

Zhao Xu nodded slightly, trying to give a friendly smile. He understood that the staff member was being courteous because of his relationship with the legendary wizard, given that the ticket was for testing in an area of legendary level.

However, Zhao Xu didn't think too much about it. He was just an ordinary wizard of the first circle.

Zhao Xu said directly, "Let's try it!"

The area of the first circle wizard was not familiar to him, and he also meant to tell the staff member not to follow him.

"That's it, sir. Please go through this passage," the superior said, bowing slightly.

Zhao Xu nodded, then walked towards the unmarked passage that seemed to lead nowhere. Meanwhile, on the other side of the corner, the entrance to the first floor was still being reviewed for entry.
Here is the translation of the text:

Only one person came out from inside, and one person was allowed to enter from outside, ensuring that the testing area for the first-level ring wizard had sufficient buffer.

As Zhao Xu entered the channel, the apprentice-turned-branch manager hurried back to his reception room, directly taking the "Short-Distance Communication Tube" produced by the floating city's new refining product on the wall and connecting it to the 10th floor's service hall.

"Li Stein, start the 10th to 13th floors immediately, all testing equipment!" the manager said, panting beside the tube.

"You're crazy? The legendary wizard won't come to this level of commotion," a voice replied, filled with excitement.

"That testing coupon number, I've checked it, is the one belonging to that young lady," the manager knew that saying this would be enough.

Regardless of who or what, there was no need to elaborate; everyone knew that the floating city only had one young lady.

Indeed, Li Stein on the other side of the tube fell silent, looking a bit incredulous: "No way, the young lady's place is much more luxurious than ours, why would she come here?"

"It's not her, but rather her servant or something I estimate, probably just to come ahead and arrange for those devices to start up first. You know, the young lady doesn't like to wait, and who knows, she might just teleport over. You'd better hurry up, you've always wanted to get to know each other, right?" the manager said anxiously, "And besides, you'd better get it all started, do you understand?"

"Alright, thanks for the reminder, I almost messed things up big time. I've been stuck in the floating city for so many years, I've gone crazy. You can rest assured, I'll definitely arrange everything."

As usual, Li Stein was in charge of managing the 10th to 13th floors of the entire testing hall, and even the legendary wizard wouldn't dare offend him.

But at this moment, he was like a spring that had been unleashed, overflowing with excitement.
Here is the translation:

"Start all the blast experiment rooms, summoning constraint rooms, detection rooms, energy interface rooms, alchemy working rooms, and trap testing rooms on the 10th floor, according to the highest level mode. At the same time, notify the 9-ring wizard to come over and start the remaining 11 to 13th floor testing equipment."

Li Stan's eyes gleamed with authority as he issued the command.

At this moment, his usually most trusted subordinate couldn't help but furrow his brow and say, "Sir, isn't the 10th floor enough already? Do we need to start the upper three layers as well? That would consume an enormous amount of energy and cost a fortune of 100 million gold coins."

"It's as I said, it's a direct order," he replied.
