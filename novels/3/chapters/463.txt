Chapter 464: The Ancient Dragon Blocking the Road

At this moment, the wind and snow outside the carriage window were pounding against the glass, as if trying to squeeze into the inner layer.

Frell was observing Zhao Xu all the time, trying to catch any information from his words.

Zhao Xu was not going to take out a divine artifact to help find the perpetrator, in Frell's opinion, which had no meaning at all.

His every intention was to help his sister rise to power.

Before returning to the capital city of Auror, he had suddenly been attacked by a pack of winter wolves, which had made him extremely vigilant.

Recalling that the current leader of the Northern Alliance, Tang De, had only one illegitimate daughter, and many high-ranking officials in the alliance were eager to shift the balance of power in her direction, his sister's usual busy schedule of visits had become sparse.

Two months ago, he had learned that the wizarding association and its branches had sent people to contact that illegitimate daughter, Freya, which had made him feel the pressure of time.

The system of the Northern Alliance was not a feudal empire, and the position of "Grand Leader" was more of an elective system, with each term lasting for ten years, and no more than three terms. Once elected, the Grand Leader would have immense influence over the entire Northern Alliance, including the appointment of many town and city mayors.

Therefore, every time a new Grand Leader was needed, it was the darkest and most bloody struggle within the city of Auror.

The current Grand Leader, Tang De, had only been in office for two years and had no worries about this aspect, or perhaps he was aware of his own circumstances, which led him to publicly reveal his illegitimate daughter.
Here is the translation of the text:

For the past century, the position of "Dà Tóng Lǐng" has generally been held by the noble families of Oulu City, with the seat rotating among them.

Regardless of how Freyr guesses, he has no idea that the person sitting across from him, Zhao Xu, is thinking about the relationship between Tang De and the five copper boxes, or the specific connection he has with his nephew's father.

After a while, Zhao Xu finally spoke up: "It's a pity. If I had a divine artifact, I would definitely use it to help Leader Tang De."

Freyr also smiled awkwardly and was about to use his plan to smoothly bring up the topic of the divine artifact and create a rift.

After all, as the chairman of the Association of Wizards, anyone who covets a divine artifact must consider the Association's perspective.

This is where the "chairman's shield" is located.

Any attempt to assassinate the chairman of the Association of Wizards would inevitably lead to pursuit by the Association.

Freyr remembered clearly that over a hundred years ago, a small-town chairman was poisoned to death in the Northern Alliance, and a legendary wizard suddenly appeared, using his prophetic magic to identify the killer and directly destroy the entire organization.

At the time, even the Alliance's branch offices had not yet reacted.

Unbeknownst to Freyr, Zhao Xu continued to say: "After all, the major forces have already entered the investigation, and in the end, they can infer that the divine artifact has accompanied the ascension of the Ai Zhu Palace."

Freyr felt a slight shock, but Zhao Xu's expression was incredibly serious.

This made him unable to help but sigh: "It's a pity."

The person sitting in front of him, Zhao Xu, could be said to be one of the few people in the Alliance who could grasp the divine artifact.
Here is the translation:

Just now, the summer wizard, if he acknowledges possessing a divine artifact, he would probably have pulled out his heart and lungs to explain it to the other party, explaining the distribution of power in the Northern Alliance, which would allow this outsider summer wizard to bump into fewer walls.

"Don't know who these people are?" Fréel finally came to his senses, and as one of the prominent figures in the city of Auru, he was extremely polite in his interactions with others.

"Anzephyr."

Zhao Xu's mentor, the only heir to the ancient magic empire, the owner of the secret law of Ernest, one of the oldest founders of the wizard association, directly introduced himself by saying his name.

Fréel couldn't help but recall something, but there was no impression at all.

As a popular figure in the Tang Dynasty, Fréel was also assigned to handle the wizard association's liaison work.

Although he was not a single wizard, he had heard enough gossip about the association. Even the composition of the high-level officials and the distribution of power in the Mistral Association, as well as the identities of the individuals involved, were clearer to him than the local players in Mistral.

The name Anzephyr had never appeared in his memory.

As Fréel waited for the other party to introduce themselves, he didn't notice that this female wizard had finished speaking and was looking for someone to chat with. He turned to the female knight on the other side.

Vivian said, "Bodyguard."

The same was answered by White Dragon Serus, who was still hesitant to say the three words "of the mount" afterwards.

After listening to this conversation, Fréel, who was not yet thirty years old, had experienced a lot of hardships since childhood and had honed his ability to the present.

He laughed on the spot: "It seems that Miss Anzephyr is the lover of the summer wizard?"
Here is the translation:

It seems that bringing one's family to work is a normal thing, and the fact that the other party is a player has been ignored by Freyr.

Even he knows that a few Earth players have become close to the leader of the Tangde, and they have received extensive cultivation. Tangde has invested numerous resources in them.

"Not so," Zhao Xu immediately corrected.

He can't afford to do something so out of line at present.

"How did you draw that conclusion?"

At this moment, Anzhi Noya was asking with a hint of curiosity.

Freyr looked at both of them with some unusual answers, and was taken aback for a moment before quickly recovering.

This might be the current romantic interest of the young couple, he immediately praised: "Because Miss Anzhi Noya's gaze just now was all focused on Mr. Zhongxue, and it's completely consistent with the two bodyguards. And you're not a bodyguard, so you must be a romantic partner."

Anzhi Noya nodded slightly, as if she had learned something, "Well, I'm also a bodyguard now."

"...". Freyr suddenly felt that the other party seemed to be teasing him, but he suppressed it.

However, at this moment, Anzhi Noya's cloak lightly fluttered, and he caught a glimpse of a subtle hint from her inner self.

Freyr's entire body was unable to stop beating, and his heart was racing wildly.

As a renowned figure in Olor City, Freyr has seen countless beauty, and even his sister was one of them. Otherwise, it would be impossible to subdue the leader of the alliance, Tangde.

However, he couldn't imagine that there were women as beautiful as this in the world, and he felt a sense of blasphemy.

Freyr's face turned red and white alternately.

As for Zhao Xu, he silently watched the scene unfold.
Here is the translation of the text:

Including the state of Fréel that had been covered by Anzhiya's concealed appearance, he was taken aback. However, Zhao Xu didn't bother to remind the other person of this.

All he hoped was that Fréel could maintain his composure until he finished his conversation with Tangde, and then make a foolish move. If he treated Anzhiya with the same manner as he treated the noble ladies in the noble circle of Aurora City, he would definitely die a miserable death.

White Dragon Selsius also noticed this point and couldn't help but despise him, thinking that this man was indeed an animal that thought with his lower body.

Just like Selsius, who had transformed and was about to leave, it was natural for him to leave without hesitation.

The dragon's spirit was vast and boundless; how could it be troubled by petty personal feelings?

Especially since the person he had his eyes on was none other than the legendary mage who was rumored to be able to conjure legendary magic at will.

Just thinking about facing such a ruthless and merciless woman who could take his life with ease made Selsius feel as if he had lost his desire.

Suddenly, the carriage, which had been moving forward, suddenly jolted to a stop, and the sliding wheels on the snow-covered road locked, causing the carriage to slide out of the tracks.

"What's going on?" Fréel muttered to himself, as if his thoughts had been revealed to someone, and he was extremely annoyed.

"Sir," the guard outside the door said with a slightly trembling voice, "there are dragons..."

"Is that the white dragon that just escaped?" Fréel thought for a moment before realizing that he had forgotten to ask about the whereabouts of the fleeing white dragon due to his excitement.

"It's not just one; there are a group of them, including one that's extremely huge..."

At this moment, Zhao Xu's eyes widened in surprise, and he glanced at Selsius's body.

Is it a rescue team?
As Serus had his head hung low, his massive body was about to shrink completely, hidden away tightly. Just then, a mighty roar of a dragon echoed from outside.

The sound was extremely grand and far-reaching, resonating across the sky.

"Serus, you dragon tribe shame, come out and show yourself, come out and show yourself!" someone shouted.

Zhao Xiu immediately couldn't help but glance at Serus, saying, "You've got yourself into this mess, now get yourself out of it."

Serus, on the other hand, looked at him with a humble expression, complaining, "That's just an ancient dragon outside, I'm not worthy of facing it."

Zhao Xiu couldn't help but sigh.

He said, "You're not worthy of facing it, but I, Zhao Xiu, am worthy of facing it?"

Just then, he glanced at Serus, who looked at him with a mixture of embarrassment and resentment. Serus seemed to be begging for mercy.

"Give back your treasure," Zhao Xiu said with a tone of "threat."

"You can kill but not humiliate," Serus said, citing his principles.

"That's it, then go out."

"I'll give in to a little humiliation," Serus said, already at his wit's end.

"You go out."

"Damn it, how can we be more greedy than the ancient dragons?" Serus exclaimed, on the verge of collapse.

"I didn't offend any ancient dragons," Zhao Xiu said, his tone cold and detached.

"That's not what the employer should do," Zhao Xiu said immediately, his voice firm.

Just then, Serus's face turned bright red, as if his face had been flushed, and he panted heavily, saying, "Fine, I'll give in completely, you can help me chase the other party away."

However, Zhao Xiu and Serus's conversation was not only overheard by Freyr, but also by the guards sitting in the driver's position.
They all seem to be at a loss, pulling along "The Legendary Mage" this time? Has the ancient dragon become so insignificant that it's not even worth mentioning?
