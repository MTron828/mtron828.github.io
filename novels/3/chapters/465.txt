Chapter 466: The Ancient Dragon's Plea for Mercy

The ancient dragon lifted its head, carefully scrutinizing Zhao Xu and the others. Even the dragon's nostrils flared out a white smoke, indicating its intense anger. The ancient white dragon, which possessed the secret law of visual insight, could see through the true nature of most people in the room. Zhao Xu's aura, which included the four-ring arcane and three-ring divine arts, raised the dragon's caution. The difficulty of mastering both arcane and divine arts meant that the opponent might be a secret art master beyond the tenth level.

As for Anzhen Noya, the dragon sensed no breath emanating from her, implying that she might have used a hidden defensive detection method. The dragon's gaze lingered on Anzhen Noya, and it discovered the loathsome "enslavement aura" that made the dragon's instincts recoil in disgust. This aura could only be attributed to the opponent having touched or used the "Dragon Jewel", which imbued them with the loathsome aura that repelled dragons.

As a dragon over a thousand years old, who had witnessed the great catastrophes of the past, the ancient dragon understood many things. If the dragons ignored the "Dragon Jewel", which could enslave them to death, it would lead to another consequence: the mass production of the "Dragon Jewel".

In Arthurian legend, the king of Avalon, King Uther Pendragon, produced the most "Dragon Jewels". However, the opponent was the man who had destroyed the entire Dragon Empire of Enser, and the latter's descendants were naturally powerless against them.

But after Ernest, most manufacturers of dragon balls, even those who have used dragon balls, have been relentlessly pursued with no end in sight, which is the final pride of the dragon tribe.

As for Zhao Xu, he couldn't help but turn around, looking at Anniya with some astonishment.

He had touched the dragon ball, and Gold Kampas, the dragon's intuition, had identified him, which was not surprising.

However, it was surprising that this powerful legendary mage, Anniya, could be identified, and the aura of the dragon ball, which was imbued with a curse, was too intense.

At this moment, the ancient white dragon continued to reveal its hesitant expression, "Are you not one of the dragon ball owners? Who are you?"

This question suddenly made the white dragons following behind them fix their gaze on the group, as if they could hardly accept this point.

Touching more than one dragon ball was already beyond explanation and could be said to be a betrayal of the dragon tribe's grave.

Looking at Zhao Xu's astonished eyes and the nervous gaze of the white dragon, Serus, Anniya couldn't help but laugh and explain, "There's a topic recently, and I've been re-examining it, so there are too many. I couldn't hold back."

"The dragon balls of the five-colored dragons are all complete."

The ancient white dragon's tone became a bit unnatural.

Because this was already five divine tools.

Ordinary people would be able to enslave these five giant dragons, establish a territory, and build a powerful force. But this ancient white dragon's voice did not stop.

"Gold dragon, silver dragon, copper dragon, bronze dragon, and red copper dragon. The dragon balls of these five metal dragons also have an aura!"

"Oh no!"

"Legend-born power dragons, rainbow dragons, are they also there?"

The ancient white dragon's tone was no longer just angry, but even began to show surprise.
Here is the translation of the text:

Upon hearing this, not to mention the group of young dragons behind him, even those standing on the same side as "Sirus" felt their legs weak and trembling.

The ancient dragon had already sensed more information than it had previously been aware of.

It couldn't possibly have really encountered the legendary "Mysterious Dragon Slayer Organization" from ancient times?

"What?"

At this moment, the ancient dragon's emotions were unimaginable: "Dragons like the Scroll Dragon and Time Dragon, which are just myths, actually exist?"

"Who are you, what kind of divine being are you?"

For the first time, the ancient dragon's tone was no longer angry, but deeply suspicious and troubled.

"Well, if you've already recognized me, what's the point of pretending to be innocent?"

Anny said.

"Escape!"

The ancient dragon immediately shouted, ordering the numerous young dragons behind him to flee.

These dragons, who had originally come to exact punishment, were also perplexed and sensed the "danger" emanating from Anny.

However, they still didn't expect their "ancestors" to directly issue an order to flee, not even to retreat.

"Hurry!"

At this moment, the ancient dragon continued to roar, its gaze fixed intently on Anny as if it feared her sudden outburst.

Following the ancient dragon's roar, the accumulated pressure over many years finally triggered a response from these dragons, who hastily flapped their wings to try and fly away from this land.

"Will you annihilate the entire population of white dragons on the Ice Mountain Range?"

However, at this moment, Anny said something like this.

Her voice was like the beating of a great bell, resonating heavily in the ears of each dragon, as if it had pierced their eardrums with an endless sonic shockwave.
Here is the translation of the text:

In an instant, a few white dragons that had just unfolded their wings collapsed, lost their footing, and fell to the ground. Those who had not yet had the chance to get up heard this sentence and didn't dare to move a muscle. They didn't know why, but they felt a sense of foreboding, as if they had received a prophecy. "Miss Anziti, our Not family from the Ice Mountain Range has never invaded the Mage Association, so how can we negotiate for our lives?" the ancient white dragon suddenly spoke in a softer tone, even hinting at seeking mercy.

"None of the giant dragons have ever flown over my head and lived to leave," Anziti said with a cold tone.

This made the white dragons, who were already immune to cold damage, feel a sense of "psychological coldness".

If it weren't for the ground guards still in a state of terror due to the "dragon's might", they would have been surprised to discover that these white dragons were shaking along with them.

At this point, the ancient white dragon was thinking about which mountain in the dragon clan could be used to establish a connection with humans.

However, as a species that could be bullied by the giants in the Ice Mountain Range, the white dragons were already low in status in the dragon clan. If it weren't for the correspondence with the Five-Metal Dragons, they would have been expelled from the Five-Colored Dragon Sequence by the Red Dragons long ago.

The woman in front of him was an "existence" that even the evil dragon god Tiama could not block. The ancient white dragon could only seethe in silence, and indeed, was spoiled as a child.
Here's the translation:

"If it had to fly over our heads, it would have been killed thousands of times by now. However, the person who once protected this woman has a reputation that has spanned the entire ancient era, from the dark era to the present day.

"'Don't think I'm bullying you,' Anny said, 'according to the ancient covenant, you dragons are not allowed to fly over the subjects of our magical empire without permission. Otherwise, we have the right to retaliate.' Although the magical empire is no longer around, I'm still a remnant, and the treaty remains in effect.

"In the end, after some thought, the ancient dragon, considering the future of its descendants, could only say with a bitter face: 'I don't know how Miss Anny can forgive us?'"
