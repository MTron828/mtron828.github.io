Chapter 621: The Path of Battle and Technique

"What is Battle-Sharp?"

Hearing this question, Zhao Xu was also somewhat taken aback and immediately wanted to describe this profession based on his knowledge. However, before he could even get the words out, he realized that his brain was still a blank slate and couldn't find a single clue.

The Nine Swords system is extremely powerful and can stand out among the 11 major professions in the Battle Law, naturally having its own extraordinary aspects.

Zhao Xu had previously encountered several Nine Swords professionals who had traveled together during his adventures. They were all born on Earth and came to the East China Empire after undergoing rigorous training.

At that time, a "Vampire" that could easily defeat Zhao Xu was killed by a "Crusader" (Heavenly Executioner) in just two moves, leaving no trace behind. The players were directly punished to that extent.

It was then that Zhao Xu learned from their descriptions that, compared to warriors who gained a warrior specialization every two levels, they had a different path.

The three major professions of the Nine Swords may not have a specialization every two levels, but they also have professional abilities that are not significantly inferior to those of barbarians.

Moreover, they have nine levels of "techniques" and "steps".

Steps refer to a type of "posture" that can be maintained at any moment, such as the stance maintained by that Crusader, which can enhance the attacking ability of teammates.

As for techniques, they are a series of "attack skills" that can be combined into various attack moves or even quick and agile combat techniques.
Here is the translation:

This nine-joint martial arts system directly shattered the last shred of pride in the warriors' hearts, and they were thoroughly defeated on all fronts.

It also allowed warriors to achieve the highest job level, with two skills and two specializations.

This is also the reason why Zhao Xu recommended "nine-joint" to Zhang Qi, because Zhang Qi's heart is set on accompanying Feng Ge and does not want to leave the Northern Alliance, so he put it aside.

But now, Wang Fubai asked him what a "battle blade" is, and Zhao Xu was actually unsure.

The opponent slightly shook his head, looking like an ancient Confucian scholar reciting the Four Books and Five Classics, saying, "To understand what a battle blade is, we must first clarify the entire nine-joint martial arts system."

Instantly, Wang Fubai's eyes flashed with golden light, "The techniques in martial arts, like your magical arts, require preparation, consumption, restoration, and learning, and are limited in their scope. The three main professions have different ways of preparing martial techniques and restoring them, and the styles they can learn are different."

"The Swordsmen (Wise Swordsmen), can learn six major styles: Murong, Steel Soul, Sunset, Shadow Hand, Stone Dragon, and Tiger Claw. They have the most techniques, but are also recognized as the weakest profession."

"The Cross Knights (Heaven's Judgment), can learn three major styles: Devotion, Stone Dragon, and White Crow. Stone Dragon is a style that everyone can learn, while Devotion is unique to the Red Jade Guard, and becoming a level 1 Cross Knight is the easiest way to become a Red Jade Guard."

"The Battle Blade (Warrior's Sword), can learn five major styles: Steel Soul, Iron Heart, Stone Dragon, Tiger Claw, and White Crow. Iron Heart is unique to the Battle Blade, and Steel Soul, Iron Heart, and White Crow are considered the strongest styles in the nine-joint system."

As Wang Fubai finished speaking, he suddenly became excited, "Remember this, young one!"
Here is the translation of the text:

"We fight with our lives, and our existence is for battle. We possess the heart of a lion, the speed of an eagle, and the power of a dragon! After completing the battle, the glory of victory is so magnificent that even the gods would envy it!"

As Soon Ba said this oath, his whole body suddenly changed, as if he was surrounded by sword shadows and his voice was like a flash of knives.

"Now do you understand?" Soon Ba shouted loudly.

As Soon Ba's oath entered Zhao Xu's mind, he seemed to see a warrior standing in front of him, practicing the three major martial arts schools with each movement, and various footwork techniques interweaving.

"A warrior is born to fight. Swift, mighty, and enduring, with absolute confidence in their combat skills, that is what it means to be a warrior!"

"So we warriors will seek out worthy opponents to test ourselves, and for us, fighting is the moment when life blooms beautifully. In that instant, when life hangs suspended on the edge of the sword, everything is perfect."

Soon Ba's expression became serious, as if he was a strict teacher. "To become a warrior, you need to master comprehensive combat skills and rigorous training in your chosen weapon. Only by persevering and fearless, without considering the consequences, can you understand the glory of being a warrior and the joy of battle."

"Therefore, warriors are often referred to as the Lord of Swords."

As Soon Ba finished speaking, he stood up, "Warriors can choose any faction, but we tend towards chaos, because we seek challenges to win honor, rather than submitting to freedom. Generally, good warriors are protectors of the weak and those who are bullied, while evil warriors are leaders of war, who will stop at nothing to defeat their enemies, causing chaos and destruction."
Here is the translation of the text:

"If I ask you to position yourself in three major careers, how would you do it?" Wén Bùbài asked. "This is very important. If you can't come up with an answer, it's like we're playing a game of chess for the rest of our lives, because you simply don't have the understanding."

Although the opponent had just mentioned the "qi" of the "jīng" and didn't have a direct connection to specific abilities, Zhao Xū had seen "jīng", "shí zú jūn", and "jiàn dào jiā" - the three major foundation careers of the "jīng" profession.

At that moment, he had a faint understanding of them in his heart. He directly answered, "The 'jiàn dào jiā' is a lightweight warrior, a mobile-type character. The 'shí zú jūn' is a typical control-type tank, while I think the 'jīng' is all-around, capable of both dealing damage and defense, and even sneaking up on the enemy to limit its movements."

Zhao Xū answered quickly, without even taking a moment to think.

"That's how you see it?" Wén Bùbài continued to press him.

"I learned from my master." Zhao Xū replied just as quickly.

"Good." Wén Bùbài finally nodded in satisfaction.

From then on, his gaze and demeanor changed, as if a second-rate student who had been slacking off suddenly woke up and decided to study hard.

"As for techniques, a 1st-level 'jīng' can choose three techniques from the five major schools that meet the conditions to learn. Before each battle, it can prepare three techniques. A 2nd-level 'jīng' can learn four techniques and prepare three. All the way up to 20th-level 'jīng', it can learn 13 techniques and prepare six. During the upgrading process, even-numbered levels can change the known techniques."

Hearing this, Zhao Xū finally understood.

The difference between 1st-level and 20th-level 'jīng' was not as big as the difference between 1st-level and 20th-level mages.

Looking at it this way, he had almost directly occupied the essence of the 'jīng' profession as a 1st-level 'jīng'."
Here is the translation of the text:

"As for the techniques you're preparing, they will remain fixed and you can change them at any time, taking about five minutes. By the way, my tone also becomes more boastful from now on.

"In terms of magic consumption, each technique we prepare for battle can only be used once in combat. However, you don't need to worry, because after you attack, you can quickly perform a swift action, such as drawing a sword, to recover all the consumed techniques.

"The Crusaders, on the other hand, slowly unlock techniques one by one during battle until they've unlocked all of them, at which point they will automatically recover all techniques. As for the Way of the Sword, it requires one minute of meditation to recover one technique. In terms of martial arts, it can be said that the recovery of techniques by the Way of the Sword is the most flexible and quickest.

"For footwork, you can learn a new footwork at levels 1, 4, 10, and 16, but you can only have one footwork at a time. Compared to techniques, footwork does not consume energy and is a labor-saving skill.

"Zhao Xū listened and nodded in understanding.

"Occupational skills, at level 1, we have two: one is to analyze battles, which allows you to add your intelligence adjustment to your reflexes (up to the highest level of Battle Warrior)."

Zhao Xū initially thought he was crazy, but it turned out that his intelligence adjustment was only one level higher than the Battle Warrior's, which was just a slight improvement.

"The other skill is to adapt to weapons, although we Battle Warriors are proficient in all military weapons, this skill is even stronger."
Here is the translation:

"We master various weapons' training and tactics, making us more proficient in handling specific weapons. While you may not use it to satisfy the specialization of a warrior, it can be flexibly adjusted to train your ability in handling weapons."

"Every morning, you can transform your expertise in a weapon you've chosen to adapt to other weapons, such as converting a specialization in long swords to one in heavy swords."

"Remember, the power of this ability far exceeds your imagination."
