Chapter 568: The Earth That Cannot Be Returned

As a powerful nine-ring art, the Prayer of Wishes is inherently limited by the caster's own imagination.

However, if someone wishes to become the master of the world, they may ultimately be misinterpreted and exiled to a half-plane called the "world", where they will become the ruler of that place.

It is also possible that it is a half-plane disconnected from other planes, becoming a prison forever.

Over the years, mages have summarized the nine common "safe use" methods of Prayer of Wishes.

These methods include duplicating spells, removing harmful spell effects, creating improved magical items, creating non-magical items worth no more than 25,000 gold coins, enhancing internal attributes, driving out injured or helpless individuals, reviving the dead, transporting people, and canceling disasters.

Once the power of the spell exceeds these nine conditions, it is likely to bring unpredictable results.

The Prayer of Wishes itself requires a vast amount of "life energy", with a quantified result of around 5,000 units, exceeding the transmission range of the permanent one-way transmission array achieved by using the Magic Constant Spell.

Even a 17th-level mage may not be able to pay the price.

Therefore, the Prayer of Wishes is a ultimate technique that can only be used when all hope is lost and the situation is irretrievable.

More nine-ring mages have the opportunity to enjoy Prayer of Wishes by spending a large sum of money to purchase a pre-recorded Prayer of Wishes scroll, thus saving the trouble of waiting for level-ups.
In general situations, when players want to exceed the limits of magic and change their fate, they often use the "Limited Wish" spell, which costs around 300 life points. However, Zhao Xu believes that a safer method is to use the spell to increase the opponent's innate intelligence by one point.

Although increasing intelligence by one point may seem insignificant compared to the opponent's six points of intelligence, it is still effective. Players who choose to use this method will need to cast the spell multiple times to achieve the desired result.

For players who choose to play as a sprite, half-sprite, or other similar species, the game is relatively easy, and they can progress smoothly. However, players who choose to play as a halfling, half-elf, or other similar species will likely regret their decision, as they will struggle to progress in the game.

As a result, Zhao Xu directly changes the opponent's species, converting them into a stone statue. Although the player still has 8 points of intelligence, they will not be punished as a half-elf. However, changing one's species through the "Wish" spell has its risks and can lead to unpredictable consequences.

Therefore, Zhao Xu does not recommend using the "Wish" spell to change one's species, as it is the most risky method. Instead, players can use the "Final Breath" spell to repeatedly kill themselves and wait for their species to regenerate. This method has a 12.5% chance of resulting in a powerful, unknown species, exceeding the limits of the original human, dwarf, and other species. However, after using the "Final Breath" spell once, Zhao Xu still chose to use the "Wish" spell.
Here is the translation:

After many years of experimentation by the mages, the techniques of "transmutation" and "final breath" followed by "wish" can safely restore an opponent's race to its original form. The player initially had a "half-orc" race, but had also experienced life as a human. Therefore, Zhao Xiu tested it out.

At this time, the player, who was originally short and stunted, like someone lacking growth hormones, was not much taller than his younger sister. With Zhao Xiu's "wish", the world's willpower suddenly converged, as if a translucent curtain opened up, enveloping the half-orc and reversing the newly formed body.

The onlookers, who were still confused about the situation, stared in amazement as the half-orc slowly grew taller. The "transmutation" technique, which had already caused the onlookers to wonder, had allowed the Earth to traverse the two realms.

Zhao Xiu showcased his skills again, instantly creating a huge wave. The people who had been standing far away, including the soy sauce group, couldn't help but rush over to hear the news.

"Master Mage, save me!"
"Please, can you let us return to Earth?"
"I can donate half of Earth's treasure to you."
"Master Mage, I'm a manager of a bank on Earth. If you can let us go back, we can facilitate the exchange of wealth between Earth and the Arthur realm——"
As Zhao Xiu, who had demonstrated extraordinary power, was swayed by the crowd, it was as if they had grasped a crucial rope, like a floating board in the sea. No one dared to leave.

Everyone rushed over, as if they wanted to merge with him. Zhao Xiu, who was surrounded by the crowd, raised his hand slightly, and in an instant, he completed the spell——" Elastic Ball of Force!"
Here is the translation of the text:

Inside this circle, which is similar to an impregnable fortress, a barrier suddenly appeared to block the crowd that was rushing towards it. The half-transparent, sphere-shaped barrier divided the area into two parts.

"Are you people thinking that the wizard is a kind and benevolent old man who always grants wishes?" Suddenly, Zhao Xu's tone became slightly playful.

The benevolent priest who had just arrived would certainly not do anything outrageous, but the wizards were a different story. Some people naturally had a tendency to make others feel uneasy, and they wouldn't even think it was a bother to disturb others. They would only think that you weren't helping him, and that you were the one who was wrong.

Zhao Xu didn't care about this, and these people would naturally get what was coming to them. However, he didn't want others to think that the wizards were easy-going, which would be bad. He didn't plan to use the "fear spell" that would affect people's minds, or else the people trapped by the barrier would have nightmares tonight.

With his magical abilities, it was unlikely that many people could resist the spell, so it would basically create an extremely terrifying feeling from the bottom of their hearts and directly attack their minds.

Zhao Xu thought for a moment before lightly waving his hand to release another spell.

Suddenly, a figure of a maiden appeared before him, her hair disheveled and her limbs flailing as she moved in a distorted manner, and she let out a hoarse, eerie scream. "Ah!"

Zhao Xu replaced the original spell with the "Strong Illusion" spell from the three-ring level, which was an upgraded version of the one-ring level "Silent Illusion" spell.

Even if he canceled the maintenance of the spell, the illusion of the maiden would still continue for three rounds, and it could also produce sound and transmit tactile sensations, making it extremely terrifying to the crowd.
Here is the translation of the text:

As soon as Zhao Xu finished speaking, the few people who were frightened by him took a step back. Then, he continued to say, "Don't fantasize about returning to Earth."

As soon as he said this, some of the people who were startled by him spoke up, saying, "Why?"

At that moment, more and more people from Earth were approaching from the distance. Although everyone had gradually accepted the fact of interstellar travel over the past day, their faces were still filled with shock and numbness.

Some people had eliminated all their debts and responsibilities on Earth and could start anew. Others were lamenting the fact that their accumulated wealth and resources had vanished overnight and were forced to start from scratch.

Although most people were gritting their teeth and looking up, inwardly they were still filled with sadness or gratitude, and only they knew the truth.

One student standing at the bottom loudly shouted, "We will recreate the technology of Arthur, recreate the Industrial Revolution, the Electric Revolution, and the Information Revolution!"

Having been cultivated in science for over ten years, he couldn't say he had no faith, but rather that he was devoted to science itself.

"Don't think that Arthur has never been to Earth," Zhao Xu said, shaking his head. "However, the technology of Earth has not yet spread to Arthur. Are the gods indifferent to believers? Or do legendary wizards think their wealth is too great?"

As he spoke, Zhao Xu shook his head again. "It's not what you're saying. It's impossible to discuss toxicity without considering the dosage. Steam engines are barely working, but without oil, Arthur and Faraday's electromagnetic induction law don't match on electrical and internal combustion engines. You might have to give up."

Instantly, the warrior standing in front of him, Zhang Yao Yu, awkwardly touched his head, saying, "Are you from Earth or are we from Earth? How do you feel like you're more familiar with us?"
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu only smiled and didn't explain much. It's true that Arthur's technological tree was heavily influenced by "divine power" and "magic". However, if the Earth and Arthur's universes are the same, then the physical laws would take effect simultaneously on both sides. In that case, the engineers on Earth would be able to create a sloping river, and then manufacture gears, iron cores, and synchronize generators, directly achieving the technological path of the Earth.

Half a month later, he didn't doubt it.

"Besides, you should give up, the universe where Earth exists is actually in a state of destruction, but it's just outside the observable range," he said.

"This time, the meteorite that fell from the sky is, in essence, a thousand-year plan of salvation prepared by the gods."

It's a plan to save both Earth and Arthur.

The remaining half-sentence was muttered by Zhao Xu in his heart.

"You think it's just an invitation for a trip?" he said.

"Just for this transmission channel, the gods have slept for at least ten times, and they just recovered recently."

"Earth will cross into Arthur's world, the players will be the vanguard to stabilize the situation, and the gods' clergy and the kingdom's forces will enter to rescue the refugees. These are all part of the plan."

The people in the scene immediately started making a commotion, and many couldn't accept this point. However, under the mysterious and charming voice of Zhao Xu, the crowd felt powerless against him.

"So, if I were you, I would seize the opportunity while the players are still nostalgic about Earth, and quickly absorb their knowledge and profession training, and strive to become a professional as early as possible," he said ruthlessly.

"Because, the true chaotic era has not yet arrived."
