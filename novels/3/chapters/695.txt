Chapter 696: Eradicating Evil, Our Honor Unyielding

"What can we do? We can't unify the depths," Zhao Xu said.

"This is not necessarily an unrealistic thing," Anzhi Noya smiled lightly.

Zhao Xu gazed around at the ruins, even though he didn't look directly at the entrance of the tunnel cave, but he could sense the sulfur-like scent wafting from inside.

Each layer of the depths can be said to be a gathering place for ugliness and evil, chaos and wickedness.

Innumerable layers, in essence, correspond to infinite evil.

Each layer has a harsh environment, with the biggest common point being that it's not suitable for survival, and even the strongest might be summoned to participate in a bloodbath.

Even in this brutal and desolate land, compared to the depths, it has a strange, idyllic atmosphere.

Therefore, except for divine beings who can rely on their own prayers and believers to establish power, other races find it extremely difficult to stand their ground here. The demons have many skills, but when it comes to this point, they are absolutely genuine.

Zhao Xu could indeed gather a large army, which is a genuine demon army.

At this moment, a sudden earthquake-like tremor shook the ground, and the originally solid cliff face suddenly crumbled, sending countless small stones rolling down. It was as if the entire sky and earth had changed color at this moment.

The adventurers who were present could also sense the wrath of the will of this dimension.

"What's going on?" Zheng Xin Yao asked with a hint of terror.
Here is the translation of the text:

At this moment, the makeshift fortifications built in the narrow passageway were shattered and collapsed, with fragments falling and dense smoke and mist spreading, as if filling every empty space. The sound of thunderous crashes echoed from above, like the end of the world, with stars falling from the sky.

The tunnel's cracks and crevices, already damaged, suddenly erupted into numerous fissures, with some even spewing out flames. Meanwhile, the void was filled with the sounds of thunder and lightning.

The three people standing at the center of this storm felt the sensation of a doomsday storm.

"Force Ball!"

Zhao Xiu hastily summoned this barrier, which was not as transparent as a rainbow-colored force ball.

Instantly, the massive stones falling from the ceiling were repelled by the force ball.

"What's going on? Is the underworld having an earthquake?" Zhao Xiu asked in surprise.

"No," replied Ansiniya, shaking her head. "It's possible that a giant monster launched an attack."

As they looked ahead, a colossal, gigantic demon suddenly appeared in the tunnel.

It rushed towards them from the entrance, destroying many bridges along the way, like a dragon shielding the sky.

"What's going on? How did it get here?" Zhao Xiu asked, looking at the scene in disbelief.

Ansiniya, who had always maintained her composure, seemed to be shaken by this event.

Then she turned to Zhao Xiu, "You two, stay here. I'll go after that demon. If I don't return today, you two should head to the 66th floor immediately. I'll find you later."

(Note: I've translated the text in a way that is easy to understand, while preserving the original tone and atmosphere of the story.)
As Anzheniya was about to leave, she cast a glance at Zheng Xin'an, then stopped in her tracks, "Alright, I'll leave Zheng Xin'an in your care, I won't worry about it. I'll take her along with me." 

"Eh?" 

Zhao Xu hastily said, "Teacher, why don't you bring me along too?" 

Anzheniya had agreed that the three of them would go on an adventure together, but now she was abandoning him. 

Only Anzheniya shook her head, "It's not suitable for you to come, if you're there, that demon will only flee further, and besides, you're a five-star mage, you're not afraid." 

As Anzheniya waved her hand, she used the "Transmutation" spell to shrink Zheng Xin'an to a microscopic size, then stuffed him into her clothing. With a wave of her hand, Anzheniya took off into the air, leaving Zhao Xu behind. 

Zhao Xu was left with a lonely silhouette, his eyes filled with frustration. 

He couldn't even say a word of goodbye, all he could do was let out a deep sigh. 

If that's the case, then it was pointless for him to pretend to be a warrior. He was either going to pretend to be a pig or eat the tiger, or he would just be himself. 

Zhao Xu changed his clothes, revealing his star-studded cloak, robust magical suit, and wise sage's robe. He gripped his long sword tightly and wiped it clean with a cloth. 

As he did so, Zhao Xu felt a surge of unbridled courage in his heart. 

At the same time, he reconfirmed in his mind that demons were immune to electric shocks and toxins, and had a 10-point resistance to strong acids, cold temperatures, and flames.
Here is the translation of the text:

Except for immunity, the subsequent resistance to him was negligible. Other mages were casting fireballs with damage of 5-30 points, and 10 points of resistance had indeed reduced the damage by half. However, Zhao Xu's damage was in the hundreds of points, and 10 points of resistance was hardly enough.

In fact, Zhao Xu was also speechless in his heart.

When they ventured together, An Ti Nuo Ya and he had warned each other about the danger of this deep abyss. However, he suddenly left without hesitation, as if he was going to let himself die.

Well, what's the point of it all? Let's just take the damage and be done with it.

As the battle continued to deepen, Zhao Xu gradually came to understand a profound truth.

No matter what kind of attack method, it's all the same in the end. Even the most powerful control magic is useless if it doesn't deal real damage.

Although he didn't know what was happening outside, he didn't care. He focused his energy and sincerely cast a new spell.

A series of powerful spells specifically designed to target demons.

The first one was the "Seal of the Soul" spell. This four-ring spell would stay with Zhao Xu after casting, emitting a soft, gentle light from his hand, as if illuminated by the sun.

【Adventure Summer, you cast the "Seal of the Soul" spell on yourself to counter the evil forces. When fighting evil creatures, your spells will have a "good" description, and any spell with three rings or less will deal an additional 50% damage to evil beings.]

As an additional part of the spell, Zhao Xu merged the spell with his "Multitalented Mage" ability to create a six-ring spell slot.

After sacrificing this new spell slot, he let the damage-enhancing effect cover all spells with six rings or less.

In other words, Zhao Xu's subsequent spells against demons would have an inherent 50% damage boost, combined with his powerful skill chain, making him roll a huge snowball.
Here is the translation of the text:

At the same time, Zhao Xu also cast a "counter-evil law array" on himself, which was equivalent to having a force field that could counteract evil biological forces.

After glancing at the list of holy spells, Zhao Xu also cast the five-ring holy spell "Corrupt Evil". This rare, death-related, benevolent element spell opened up a 6-meter-radius spell area around him, which would move along with his movements. Any evil biological entity that dared to enter this area would be afflicted with a disease, making it a negative DeBuff.

Zhao Xu had once believed that the DeBuff spells on his body were sufficient to make any monster that approached him kneel down and lose all fighting ability.

Initially, Anshinoya wanted him to experience the difficulty of the abyss, so she didn't let Zhao Xu reveal the solution. At this time, Zhao Xu didn't hesitate at all, and countless spells mercilessly rained down on his body, regardless of whether they were effective or not.

Just then, several Furo monsters flew over Zhao Xu's head, emitting a series of frightened screams as they fled towards the front.

Is it the guardian of the gate?

Zhao Xu's heart was filled with wonder, but he continued to crouch down and observe.

In the past, the Great Abyss was ruled by the Obis demon, and at that time, a four-armed demon named the Gatekeeper received a command from them to guard the Great Abyss.

Although the era had already transitioned to the rule of the Tanah evil demon, with the passage of time, this four-armed demon had also become stronger and received the favor of the Abyss.

It flew across the bridges, challenging anyone who tried to pass through the teleportation gate.

For this giant, belly-aching demon with a mouth full of sharp teeth, whether native inhabitants or outsiders, they were all the same, and he considered them all to be his targets for destruction.
Here is the translation of the text:

This "Guardian of the Gate" is also a threat to the current depths of the Abyss, and each time it appears, it represents the destruction of a stronghold that guards a transmission portal.

Just now, Zhao Xu thought that the giant demon that flew by was the Guardian of the Gate, but the subsequent details didn't add up.

Now, looking at these demons fleeing in a panic, but not really attacking? But as Zhao Xu observed, the situation became increasingly abnormal, with more and more demons of the same kind flying towards the tunnel below.

Their movements were extremely uniform, as if they were migrating in a fixed pattern or were fleeing in an orderly manner, without even basic combat tactics.

If it's a real evacuation, they should be fleeing in all directions, not moving in such an orderly fashion.

However, demons are often endowed with telepathic abilities, and Zhao Xu didn't know the intentions of these demons.

Just as he was about to investigate, a white figure flashed by.

An angel? Is it a 2nd-level chicken angel? What about a 9th-level winged angel or a 13th-level Gabriel angel?

Zhao Xu almost popped his eyes out.

As more and more celestial beings crowded his field of vision, exceeding those he had summoned through the Goddess's power, he suddenly realized.

It turns out that the guests are from the Heaven's Peak Paradise, a realm known for its boundless Holy Water Sea and the only sacred mountain in the world, where justice and goodness, order, elegance, and kindness are the highest principles.

All evil cannot hide, and everything is beautiful.

Only those who reside in this realm, with hearts as gentle as a mother's, can truly understand the kindness and affection of companions.
Here is the translation of the text:

Heavenly Mountain is the ultimate domain of kindness and order, promising a wonderful world to those who do good, and it is also a place that demons from the abyss and the nine hells crave to conquer.

It turns out that Heavenly Mountain has dispatched a massive army of heavenly creatures to occupy the fourth layer of the abyss.

Zhao Xu was also unaware that he had witnessed a momentous event in history. He only silently recorded the types of angels and divine messengers that appeared and then continued to cast an invisibility spell to conceal his presence, heading towards the lower depths.

It's unknown whether another example of the abyssal lord capturing a benevolent angel occurred, making the gods of Heavenly Mountain so angry that they opened a dimensional portal to invade this place, giving the abyssal demons a severe warning.

Because of the properties of the dimensional portal, Heavenly Mountain can only weaken the demons at most, and it's impossible to cause them any serious harm, more like letting off steam.

Since fate has brought them together, Zhao Xu doesn't intend to let this opportunity slip away.

He directly took out the "Nine-Ring Scroll" from his bosom - a high-level divine form.

This spell itself is the lowest version of the "Low-Level Divine Form" at four rings, and it goes up to the "Divine Form" at six rings.

However, Zhao Xu either doesn't use his strength or uses it naturally to its full extent!

This spell, based on the secondary spell of the four-ring foundation (+4 bonus, 10-point strong acid, cold, and electric shock resistance), allows him to gain all the characteristics of semi-heavenly creatures!

Every day, he can cast "Break Evil Slash," "Dark Vision," and "Spell Resistance," and so on...

That is, the cost is that he can increase his challenge level to 2nd level, belonging to a strong template of semi-heavenly creatures, and Zhao Xu has reached it with a nine-ring spell.

Moreover, the following dynamic column hint...
Here is the translation of the text:

"The Adventurer Zhào Xu, you cast the 'Higher Divine Form' on yourself, and you gain the characteristics of a semi-divine being, +1 natural defense, dim vision, immunity to strong acid, cold, and electricity, and attribute boosts of +4 strength, +2 agility, +4 constitution, +2 intelligence, +4 perception, and +4 charm. These attributes are all unnamed bonuses that can be stacked, so this spell is one of the few that can continue to expand one's attributes.

After casting this spell, Zhào Xu's entire body has become almost identical to that of a semi-divine being, with white feathers on his back that reflect his noble lineage.

Zhào Xu naturally flapped his wings and pretended to be a member of the team, slowly flying into the heavenly army without any obstruction.

"What are you?" a holy light messenger asked curiously after seeing Zhào Xu approach.

Although there are semi-divine beings living in the Heavenly Mountain, they are still vastly different from the semi-divine beings in the heavenly army. Moreover, it doesn't recall this time's deployment involving semi-divine beings.

Zhào Xu smiled slightly and said, "Eradicating evil, we have no choice but to do so!"

As he spoke, he glanced at the hidden corner where Frodo was lurking and shouted, "Frodo, die!"

As he shouted, Zhào Xu flew diagonally towards Frodo while holding up his long sword, unleashing the ability brought by the spell, 'Break the Curse!'"
