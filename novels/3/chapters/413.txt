Chapter 414: Prescribing Treatment

In this crucial moment, Zhao Xu had realized that his entire defense system had been breached by various intangible armor values.

As the sword touched his cloak and entered his skin, he saw his stardust cloak suddenly burst forth with a brilliant starlight, hardening to resist the massive long sword that was almost as tall as he was.

The force was reduced by half.

However, the remaining half of the sword's sharp edge had already injected its killing intent into Zhao Xu's body.

【Adventurer Zhong Xia, you have been attacked by an iron golem and suffered 17 HP (2D10+7) in damage. The stardust cloak has reduced the damage to 9 HP.】
Magical Weapons!

Zhao Xu didn't expect that these iron golems would be wielding luxurious magical weapons.

Otherwise, the non-magical weapon would have been shattered by the cloak the moment it touched him.

This would have directly reduced his 27 life points to just 18.

At this pace, he would collapse after two more sword strokes.

At this moment, Zhao Xu turned around to look at his back, only to see another "iron golem" appear out of nowhere!

What's even more infuriating is that the opponent had two iron golems of the same height and size behind him, each wielding a long sword.

The entire situation took a sudden turn for the worse.

Four iron golems, each with special enhancements, had already reached a challenge level of over 13.

Even without any additional abilities, these four iron golems combined would be equivalent to a 17-level challenge.

Unfortunately, Zhao Xu had no time to think.

The four swords converged, forming a sword net that sealed off all his escape routes, and his attack power increased by a third.

Zhao Xu's thoughts were in a whirlwind.
Here is the translation of the text:

Time reversal talisman?
Secondary explosive?
The Iron Demon has already proven that it can break through its defense, and it's just delaying its own death.

Zhao Xu directly reflects on himself and activates another ability.

Knowledge (Mysterious) check - search for Iron Demon!
In the brief moment before Zhao Xu's spell, "Divine Knowledge", had a lasting effect, he boosted all his knowledge checks by 10 levels with the blessing of insight.

He basically isn't about ancient secrets anymore; he can roughly understand most of it.

And since he had read the book "Monster Compendium" written by Anzhi Noya, he can get extra bonuses when searching for monster knowledge and obtain more data.

After scanning the knowledge he had obtained, Zhao Xu suddenly released his grip on the "Power Battle Staff" in his hand and simultaneously activated another glove.

The "Super Demon Instant Activation Staff" hidden in the glove immediately appeared in his hand, and a heavy feeling came from his palm.

Only someone with a spatial storage glove could do this kind of seamless switching; otherwise, ordinary people would be killed by the sword's arrival in just a few seconds.

At this moment, Zhao Xu grasped the metal-made staff and transmitted his confidence to it, activating his "Instant Spell" ability - "Sacred Domain".

As a clear silver spiritual energy covered Zhao Xu's entire body, the four Iron Demons that had been about to stab him with their swords all froze in place.

Several long swords pointed at Zhao Xu from a distance of less than a few fists away, but they did not pierce again.

At this moment, Vivian also realized what was going on.

Zhao Xu also hurriedly said, "Don't move, I'll handle it."
Here is the translation of the text:

As he held the staff and lightly touched Vivian, a burst of identical magical energy was transferred to the past in an instant. After finishing these actions, he only lightly panted.

Just moments ago, he had suddenly performed a normal spell to catch up on time, and he had managed to cast two "Sacred Domain" spells.

The Sacred Domain, also known as the "Peaceful Domain", can ensure the safety of one person.

The spell ignores resistance and is applied to oneself. As long as the caster does not move, the enemy can only pass a willpower check to officially complete the attack.

However, in general battlefield situations, if a priest prepares this spell, the consequences are often that the priest survives alone, but their teammates perish.

This single-person Sacred Domain is a single-cast spell, while the group Sacred Domain is a five-cast spell.

Although this spell is excellent, it is also commonly criticized. Zhao Xu, who only had one teammate, struggled to combine it with another spell.

However, the four iron golems before him, regardless of their attack power, defense power, or magical immunity, were all exceptional existences.

Only their three willpower resistances were relatively low, as they could ignore most spells and attribute values under normal circumstances. It was extremely difficult to resist the threat under Zhao Xu's divine spell, which was extremely difficult to resist.

At this moment, Vivian rushed over and pressed her hand on Zhao Xu's chest.

"[Adventurer Zhao Xu, you have received Saint Vivian's holy healing ability and recovered 9 HP.]"
In an instant, Zhao Xu's life value, which had just been consumed by being stabbed, was directly restored to full value by Vivian's holy healing ability. The wound on his back, which had just been inflicted, also perfectly healed, leaving no trace, with only a splatter of blood on his robe.
Here is the translation of the text:

With 8 points of charm, combined with the 3rd level Holy Warrior's skills, Vivian's holy healing can restore 24 HP of life. Although the quantity is limited, it is still precious.

Zhao Xiu is not unable to cast his healing spell at this moment, but they are all racing against time. Within the 14-turn time limit of the Holy Domain spell, Zhao Xiu and Vivian will not take any aggressive actions unless they are attacked. However, as a single-target spell, the Holy Domain spell can only block attacks and single-target spells, and is ineffective against area-of-effect spells.

The fireball attack can still cause damage to them. The Iron Golem, similarly, has a spitting attack.

This Iron Golem, having lost its attack ability, can only move according to its instincts and remains stationary. However, in the next turn, Zhao Xiu will once again face the "spitting attack" once more.

At this point, Vivian also thinks about this, looking at Zhao Xiu.

Although she is a Holy Warrior of the Demon World, she has no abilities that can solve the current problem. The only ability she can use is summoning a demon, but she will not use it again.

"What spell can suppress the spitting attack?" Vivian asked.

On the vast stone bridge, where the Iron Golem had stopped, only the two people's heartbeats were trembling.

"Yes, there is the three-ring spell 'Suppression of Spitting Attack'."
Zhao Xiu sighed, "This silly spell is a single-target spell."

This three-ring spell was originally designed to counter the dragon's spitting attack.

However, in this situation, Zhao Xiu cannot afford to release four three-ring spells one after another. He is not just going to finish this task and then leave, nor can he afford to waste the time it takes to release four single-target spells in a row.

Zhao Xiu has a full spellbook, and in general, he can always pull out a spell to respond to any situation.
Here is the translation:

The problem is that his resources are not unlimited.

At that moment, the three iron golems that had just launched a surprise attack on Zhao Xu were now starting to vibrate as if their engines had been turned on.

It was clear that the remaining three golems could unleash a toxic "spit attack" that could damage their bodies, and the energy was building up.

In this instant, Zhao Xu continued to think about his next move.

Should he increase his and Vivi's resilience to let them just barely survive the 19-layer resilience test of the spit attack? Vivi, due to her Saint Warrior's blessing, could adjust her charm by 8 points and basically bypass the question.

This was making Zhao Xu's head ache as a low-strength mage.

Should he summon a spell to call in some help? Or use an attacking spell to counterattack the golems? Or even take advantage of the situation to escape and reposition himself on the battlefield?

In the brief span of a second or less, Zhao Xu's mind generated over a dozen battle plans.

It wasn't that the plans were bad or that the risks were too great. It was that Zhao Xu realized he needed to use the smallest amount of resources to achieve victory.

He had already used up a bunch of two-ring and three-ring spell slots, and he didn't even need to explore anymore.

Just as Zhao Xu was about to cast a spell, the ground suddenly shook.

Again.

Repeatedly, more than ten times.

Zhao Xu's eyes almost popped out in shock.

In front of him, a massive army of iron golems was advancing, numbering in the dozens.

Zhao Xu didn't dare hesitate, and quickly cast the three-ring spell "Energy Shield"!

Immune to attribute damage, take whatever spit you want.
