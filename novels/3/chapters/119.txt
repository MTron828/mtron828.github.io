Chapter 120: Shapeshifting Lecture

The next day, Zhao Xu prepared some reading magic spells and headed to the academic lecture hall in the floating city to listen to a lecture.

In general, after graduating from the floating city, many novice mages, whether they are Arthurian residents or players, will seek out a mentor to conduct research together.

The mentor provides learning resources to the novice mages, and the novice mages act as research labor, helping the mentor with the branch content of the research topic. This mutually beneficial relationship has always been the norm in the floating city.

It's only when a mage has reached the middle-level core level that they can apply to become a research mentor in the floating city, and the number of assistant positions is limited.

Once those 1st-level mages who have just graduated cannot find a way or lack the assistant qualification, they are basically forced to leave within three months, and the same is true for player groups.

Zhao Xu was also able to see many players coming and going during the first month, but after three more months, the number of players decreased by at least half, including new additions.

This situation where senior mages drive middle-level core mages, and middle-level core mages drive novice mages, has also formed a pyramid structure in the floating city, with the invisible influence of the mage family behind the scenes.

Only Zhao Xu, who had a mentor who automatically came to train him from the very beginning, was able to complete his training without worrying about what path to take, what topic to research, and how to recommend himself.

The academic lecture hall is a welfare provided by the association headquarters to all permanent residents of the floating city.
The association generally arranges high-level or legendary mages to give lectures on their research at academic forums, which also serves as a way to verify their ideas. Anzhi gave Zhao Xu a private lesson, which usually takes place in the afternoon or evening, leaving the morning for self-study.

Zhao Xu discovered that today's academic forum schedule has a lecture on "Shape-Shifting Magic" and arrived early. Although he had experienced a level 9 shape-shifting magic "Body Transformation" two days ago, he still has many details he wants to understand.

Zhao Xu has always been curious about his state at that time. When he transformed into a Fiendish Servant, he regained his former warrior's mentality, as if he were on a battlefield, eager to slaughter all enemies with his weapons. Zhao Xu felt like he was controlling a max-level character.

This extraordinary ability has left Zhao Xu somewhat bewildered. Especially since he will be touching on level 2 transformation magic at level 3.

Although he is not a specialist mage but a jack-of-all-trades mage, he needs to understand the high-level magic to distinguish between major and minor points.

Anzhi rarely makes decisions on the selection of magic and usually lets him develop naturally.

As Zhao Xu approached the door, he asked the attendant, "Ticket?"

Compared to those still in their apprenticeship, Zhao Xu, who has already advanced to level 1 mage, has already entered the power hierarchy, albeit at the lowest level.

Zhao Xu felt embarrassed, having forgotten this. Academic forums often involve discussions and many high-level mages dislike rowdy gatherings. Sometimes, popular lectures will adopt a ticket-distribution model.
Here is the translation of the text:

Before Zhao Xu was an apprentice, Anniya gave him a list of lectures to attend, which included some tickets that needed to be reserved. When he heard someone asking a question, Zhao Xu suddenly remembered that the lecture was quite popular and required tickets.

However, he had forgotten to apply for the tickets, which would take at least half an hour to do. "Sorry, sir, please come in," said a middle-aged apprentice dressed in a robe, noticing that Zhao Xu was being stopped by someone wearing a silver-framed badge.

Zhao Xu saw the badge on the chest of the middle-aged apprentice, which was marked with a silver plaque indicating that he was responsible for logistics management. He understood that the other person was the organizer of the lecture.

Since the other person had let him in, Zhao Xu didn't say much, but he felt that the other person was hinting at something. The middle-aged apprentice looked at Zhao Xu with a sly smile, pretending not to notice the badge on his chest, and said enthusiastically, "Welcome, Zong Xiaoshi! The seats without numbers are available for anyone to sit, and I'll take you in."

Zhao Xu wasn't used to being treated so warmly and hastily waved his hand. It was like he was going to a hot pot restaurant and the service staff just wanted him to sit quietly.

The middle-aged apprentice continued to look at Zhao Xu with a stern expression until Zhao Xu's figure disappeared into the crowd. He then turned around and scolded two waiters who had stopped Zhao Xu: "I instructed you to let anyone with a badge wear a plaque pass, and those seats without numbers are reserved for them. It's better to leave them empty than to distribute tickets randomly."
Here is the translation of the text:

At this time, a young waitress who was being reprimanded whispered in a low voice, "Manager, you said that the badge with a golden edge chip cannot be blocked, but this wizard is clearly wearing a silver edge, shouldn't it be lower?"

"You dare to defy me, wide-eyed, look there! That's a secret silver! Worth more than gold! It represents a higher level than a golden edge badge. Your distant uncle's wizard just got promoted to the position of airship guide last month, and his badge has a silver edge chip, do you understand?"

...

The academic forum at the Floating City has many seats, mainly arranged according to the theme of the lecture. Some academic forums even have a table placed in front of a furnace, making it convenient for everyone to experiment together.

The layout of this academic forum is similar to the Awakening Hall, with seats rising from the back to the front. The podium is equipped with a wide whiteboard.

Most of the seats in the forum are already filled with people, and a ninth-ring wizard is about to give a lecture. Many novice wizards who have just reached the first level are also present, eager to get a glimpse of the ninth-ring wizard.

Naturally, they dare not hope to be accepted as apprentices by the ninth-ring wizard, but they cannot resist the many apprentices and disciples of the ninth-ring wizards, who will come to recognize and recruit one-level wizards as assistants with just one glance.

Zhao Xu didn't pay much attention, walked up to the empty seats in the front row, and sat down.

As time passed, the entire hall gradually filled up to full capacity.

At this moment, a sweaty and out-of-breath fat wizard rushed into the hall, still panting heavily and found that the entire hall was almost fully seated, and the ordinary seats were too cramped for him to fit.
Here is the translation:

He hastily turned his gaze towards the unmarked seats, where some novice mages might mistakenly sit, but these seats were already overcrowded, so the likelihood of mistakes was low.

The pompous mage scanned the entire row, his eyes lingering on a group of mages who could easily take him on. Feeling threatened, he decided to lump them into the "do not mess with" category.

He continued scanning until he reached Zhao Xu, who looked like he had just changed into his wizard's robes. The mage's eyes widened as he noticed the emblem of a one-ring mage on the inside of Zhao Xu's robes.

Many first-level mages would rather make their own robes than wear the standardized robes provided by the Floating City. But the pompous mage was overjoyed, thinking that a descendant of a powerful mage should yield to a higher-ranking mage. After all, he had the credentials to belong to the Floating City's hundred-strong mage family.

As he approached Zhao Xu, the pompous mage's words trailed off. He saw the mage badge with a silver core on Zhao Xu's chest.

A cold sweat dripped down his back.

"Yeah, is something going on?" he asked, just as the lecture was about to begin.

Zhao Xu noticed a fat mage blocking his path and couldn't help but ask curiously.

"Oh, nothing, Mr. Zhong Xia, I suddenly feel a strong affinity for you, and I don't mind sitting next to you to feel your grandeur?"

The pompous mage, Lin Qi, smiled obsequiously and pulled out a collapsible stool from his storage bag.
Here is the translation of the text:

It wasn't that the fat wizard couldn't create a comfortable chair, but rather that the high-level wizards were gathered, and even Zhao Xū's two positions were far apart, each sitting with two powerful wizards of curse and transformation.

Fat Lin Qi naturally dared not to make a fool of himself, and waited for the chance to be pointed out, and then he would have to submit a report.

Zhao Xū thought to himself that he hadn't even nodded yet, but this fat wizard had already sat down.

"Mr. Zhong Xia, nice to meet you, my name is Lin Qi, and I'm a five-ring wizard," the fat wizard introduced himself, flashing his bright white teeth.

As he spoke, he couldn't help but shake his chest, causing his already somewhat oily badge to move, making the five rings start to interlock and entwine.

Zhao Xū could only turn his body and nod in greeting: "Mr. Zhong Xia, one-star wizard."

"Don't know where this young brother got his skills from, is it possible that he's the No. Qi wizard who's going to give a lecture today? I heard he created a low-level imitation magic spell last month, and with low-level magic, he can replicate an extremely realistic person?"

The fat wizard, Lin Qi, saw that Zhao Xū wasn't opposed to exchanging words with him, and immediately started asking questions, his face beaming with joy.

Zhao Xū, who was young and wore a badge with a secret silver chip, was extremely curious about this.

When he heard this, he slightly furrowed his brow and asked, "Why do all the male wizards I've met seem to be as optimistic as you?"

"Ah, researching magic spells is very tiring, and if you're not cheerful, it's easy to become withdrawn," the fat wizard laughed, his face creasing with laughter.

Just then, the lecturer, No. Qi, walked into the lecture hall from the main door.

The originally noisy hall became quiet.
Here is the translation of the text:

Noci's appearance looked like he was under fifty years old, with a fierce brow and a completely unbearable demeanor.

At this time, he walked to the podium, slightly adjusting the microphone in front of the lectern, while the mage and invisible servants, including the waitstaff, had already taken their positions beside him.

"Yesterday, the association notified me to come and give this lecture at the last minute, and I was in a hurry. I forgot to tell the association, but now it's not too late. Trouble for those with an IQ below 17 to leave, as you are wasting your time here."
