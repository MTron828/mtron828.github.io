Chapter 366: The Red-Bedded Bride

The "soul- binding staff" worth millions of gold coins was placed in Zhao Xu's backpack, although the half-human, half-beast creature had opened the side pocket where he kept his spellcasting materials.

However, this still made Zhao Xu feel annoyed, so he had to warn the player who was trying to "multi-task" slightly.

Even in Mistral, he might have called the police to take these players away and punish them.

However, Zhao Xu quickly put this matter aside and devoted himself to browsing the market.

As he wandered around, he managed to find a few items with minor damage that could be repaired and sold for a few hundred gold coins.

After walking around, it was already night, and Zhao Xu decided to enter a pub near the auction house to relax and gather information.

As he stepped into the pub, he pushed open the half-open door and noticed that near the nearby willow tree, some children were playing games under the light of the pub, with one of them being chosen as the "ghost".

Another group of people were clapping and singing a nursery rhyme:

"The bride wears a red dress, la la la, she enters the mountain and lake."
"The bride wears a white dress, la la la, she follows your footsteps."
"Lala la, who fell down, lala la, who was dragged away."
"You will all dream of her, you will all belong to her."

The clear and sweet children's voices slowly transmitted this nursery rhyme into Zhao Xu's ears, but he had already entered the pub, where the noisy laughter and shouts had drowned out the outside sounds.

However, Zhao Xu did not plan to go back and listen again, for some reason, according to Zhao Xu's knowledge, some local folk songs were very sinister, even directly hiding local legends.

At this time, two giants in the wine tavern were vigorously twisting their wrists, their faces already slightly flushed from drinking barley wine, and now their faces were completely red after a burst of strength.

As an 8-power chicken, Zhao Xu naturally sat quietly in a corner and watched the show. If he attached a minute-level "Bull Power" to himself, he could suddenly muster 4 points of strength and barely qualify to participate in the wrist-twisting game.

However, he had lost the carefree attitude of drinking and chatting with friends in his previous life.

Now, looking at the villagers of Arthur, he felt a subtle, intangible distance.

At this moment, one of the giants suddenly exerted a powerful force, pinning his opponent's thick arm down. He burst out laughing, and the atmosphere in the wine tavern reached a climax, with people continuously raising their cups and cheering.

Zhao Xu also felt the "tentacle" behind him subtly move.

The attack level of the tentacle was determined by combining Zhao Xu's basic attack with his strength attribute, and the impact damage was 1-8 points, with adjustments made to strength.

So, as long as Zhao Xu could improve his "strength attribute", he could easily make his tentacle unleash extremely powerful attacks, with the damage increasing gradually.

"Wow, it's the Sword Swift Team." Suddenly, the atmosphere in the wine tavern, which had just calmed down, became lively again.

Everyone's gaze turned to a team of seven people who had just entered the wine tavern, covering a wide range of occupations, including a mage.
Here is the translation of the text:

The elderly warrior with a tiger-like tattoo on his chest, holding a pair of giant swords, suddenly emitted a mysterious magical glow. Even magic weapons, after being produced, only have a 30% chance of bearing such an effect.

"What's going on? Did you guys finish the task and come back? Or didn't you even fight at all?"

"Shh, even if they really couldn't beat that red-robed bride, it's still easy to educate you and me."

The people who were quietly discussing noticed the gaze of the members of the "Sword Rush Team" and immediately fell silent.

Zhao Xu listened for a while before understanding that this "Sword Rush Team" was a renowned adventurer team in the Mistral region.

For the wizards in Floating City, most of them were conducting research on the suspended island. Many low-level wizards who graduated from other cities' forces would return directly, while those without forces would be absorbed into the research team. Only those with insufficient talent would drift out, giving these forces an opportunity to reap the benefits. This led to Mistral having a high proportion of "wizards" and "clerics", but the number of these two professions participating in adventures was still very small.

Therefore, the "Sword Rush Team" rose to fame under these conditions. They first completed several bounty missions for the Wizard's Association, earning many magical items and gradually accepting higher-level tasks. Eventually, they evolved into the current team with an average level of over 6-7. If it weren't for being in Mistral, a dragon's lair, they would have already become the honored guests of the local ruler in other small towns.
Here is the translation of the text:

Even though they are a group of low-level adventurers, the sword team is still the target that these rowdy tavern-goers admire, and even those who are afraid of chaos in the world are not bold enough to whistle at the female ranger, who is similarly dressed in revealing clothing.

"Last time, I don't think there were this many people," said the female ranger, Lauren, looking astonished at the packed tavern.

"I estimate it's all because of tonight's auction, and there are indeed many people," said the team leader, Morlo, wearing a high-collared emerald cloak and holding a slender magical staff. After scanning the crowd in the tavern, he seemed uninterested.

At this point, the tavern owner came over to greet them, leading the team to an empty half-open room.

Zhao Xu then approached an elderly mercenary who had already had too much to drink, looking at the intricately plated armor on his body. Zhao Xu knew that this was an old hand.

With his age, it meant that he had rich experience and broad knowledge.

Zhao Xu whispered, "What task did the sword team receive a few days ago? Why do they seem so strange when they come back?"

The elderly mercenary glanced at Zhao Xu and immediately recognized that he was not a local. He muttered, "They went to catch the red-haired bride, of course."

Zhao Xu thought back to the children's song he had heard when he first entered the tavern and asked, "What's that?"

As he spoke, he handed over the whole bottle of unmixed barley wine he had not drunk.

To be honest, Zhao Xu was not very interested in the ordinary brewing techniques of Arthur, as he was used to drinking Coronal, a type of beer. He had not indulged in the luxury of consuming the beer with magical brewing techniques.
Here is the translation of the text:

Originally, I was planning to ask Zhao Xu about his appetite, and then subtly hint that the old soldier wanted to share some wine with him. Seeing Zhao Xu being so courteous, the old soldier turned around to look around, noticing that the center of the tavern had already shifted towards the newly arrived Jin Ji team, with many adventurers who thought they were capable of handling themselves coming over to socialize.

Even a team of adventurers from outside, who had met the Jin Ji team before, came over to join them and start drinking. Compared to the usual scene of people clinking glasses and chatting at a banquet, the tavern was filled with excitement under the dim light of the lanterns.

The old soldier, understanding that no one was paying attention to them, relaxed and continued to pour another bottle of macao wine onto the table, saying, "Set it aside, and the inside information is worth two bottles of wine."

As he spoke, the old soldier lowered his voice, saying, "The Red-Clothed Bride is a terrifying existence in our Frosty Town."

"Recently, it has abducted a girl, so the family has commissioned the Jin Ji team to search for her. Ah, most of the people here are just pretending to be knowledgeable."

"The Jin Ji team was initially invited to serve as security for tonight's auction, but since they are high-level, they only need to make an appearance during the formal auction. At this time, the others naturally came over to socialize and gather information beforehand. Look, a group of people are coming over to share information."

Zhao Xu didn't expect that asking about the two bottles of macao wine would lead to such crucial information. Indeed, relying solely on knowledge, skills, and rumors to gather information can make it difficult to obtain the latest information.

"Why is the terrifying existence called the Red-Clothed Bride?" Zhao Xu bit his tongue, not daring to say the word "monster."
Here is the translated text:

From his perspective, this kind of wicked thing is either evil or just a mindless monster, and with one strike, it's all over.

"Ah, Mister, there's no tradition of the bride wearing red in this region around you," an old mercenary said.

At this moment, he took out a pipe and lit it with the nearby coal oil lamp, took a deep puff, and then let out a relaxed sigh before slowly opening his mouth to say "Itâ€”".

Suddenly, there was a loud "bang" as someone kicked open the door of the tavern.

Instantly, there were several loud "whoosh" sounds as several adventurers who were responsible for guarding the tavern quickly drew their weapons and glared at the person who had burst in.

They didn't mind giving this arrogant drunk a lifetime lesson they would never forget.

However, after several people rushed in, the warriors who had initially reacted by drawing their swords mostly sat down quietly.

The reason was that a young man with no concern on his face, accompanied by a hint of arrogance, had just walked in. At this moment, the winter snowstorm outside was raging, and the cold wind was blowing against passersby's faces.

However, the young man himself was not affected by the cold, as his ordinary-looking robe had been imbued with a spell that could resist the cold.

The reason why all the adventurers who wanted to scold him or educate him about the importance of being modest sat down quietly was because a low-voiced wizard was following the young man from behind.

Although the opponent had covered the rings on his hands that could cast spells, the strong aura of a powerful wizard still made everyone in the tavern feel uneasy, even causing their voices to be muffled.
Here is the translation:

At this moment, Zhao Xiu finally noticed that the young man who had just entered was followed by four guards. The atmosphere was normal this time. However, the retinue's equipment was not only complete but also luxurious, with even their weapons directly emitting magical light.

"Trouble's coming," the old mercenary said with a serious expression. "You owe me this time, young man. I suggest you leave immediately."

Without waiting for Zhao Xiu to respond, the old mercenary quickly left, not even bothering to finish his drink. He didn't dare to leave through the main door and instead slipped away through the back door of the tavern.

Zhao Xiu immediately pulled out his several magic wands, preparing to face the unexpected changes. The young man in traditional clothing then walked directly to the original sword team and sat down with a swagger.

He looked down at the team with disdain and said, "Your physique is quite impressive, and with your usual training, your physical fitness must be excellent."

Although the young man's words didn't have any special tone, combining his attire and the tavern's atmosphere, everyone in the room could sense the young man's intentions.

"What do you mean?" Morlo, the team leader, shouted loudly.

Appearing extremely charming, he looked like he was surrounded by a halo. "That's what I mean."

The young man then pulled out a small knife from his pocket and began to file his nails with a bored expression, as if he didn't care about the people in front of him.

In an instant, the entire sword team was in a state of high alert, with each person's hand resting on their weapon, their eyes filled with a killing intent towards the young man in traditional clothing.
Here is the translation:

However, his gaze couldn't help but glance at the extraordinary-looking mage and his four guards who were no weaker than them. Suddenly, the young man in a traditional Chinese garment paused, his expression unchanging, and slammed his knife on the table with force. "Didn't you receive a normal magical item as a reward when you were commissioned to participate in that auction a few days ago?"

"That's right," Captain Morlo said, his voice filled with subtle suspicion.

"That's my family heirloom," the young man in a traditional Chinese garment growled, his teeth clenched. "Do you think it has any connection to me?"

As soon as he spoke, the entire tavern fell silent, with everyone calculating the ripple effect of his words. Originally, Captain Morlo was about to scold the opponent, but he suddenly thought of several possibilities and his face turned pale. "If that's the case, we can return the magical item that belongs to my family's ancestor and withdraw from Snowy Town. We will apologize to the authorities afterwards."

The mage family!
The mage who followed from behind him had some guesses, and it wasn't until now that he realized that the seemingly abandoned tomb was actually inhabited by a powerful force.

The Hundred Mage Family is always united when facing outsiders.

This small team may seem prosperous, but they can't withstand the slightest impact from the waves. Therefore, Captain Morlo made a swift decision to abandon all tasks and rewards. If the young man in a traditional Chinese garment just relaxed his grip, he would even apologize on the spot, creating a harmonious atmosphere.
Here is the translation of the text:

As soon as the young man in traditional Chinese clothing burst out laughing, his eyes blazing with fervor, he gazed at Rael, the woman in a revealing outfit, who was sitting next to him, and said, "Well, let's just get this over with, then. You can join me for the night, and we'll settle this once and for all."

The entire tavern fell silent, and everyone listened intently as the leader of the Swordsmen Squad spoke. The name "Mistra Fafnir", which was enough to strike fear into the hearts of those around them, suddenly flashed through everyone's minds, even those who were drunk or half-asleep.

However, even the most reckless adventurers would not dare to refuse such a request from someone who was so bold as to make such a demand.

They knew that tonight's auction would likely be interrupted, and that the wizard who had taken the law into his own hands was extremely formidable.

Digging up an ancient tomb would inevitably lead to a situation where they would never be able to leave the place. This meant that no matter how brutally the opponent acted, it would all be justified.

A wizard with a legitimate license to kill was a scenario that was difficult for them to imagine.

At this moment, everyone held their breath as the auction organizer fell silent for half a minute, as if they were reflecting on the accumulation of fear that had been building up over the years.

"Friends, some things don't need to be made so complicated," the squad leader, Molo, said, although he didn't know why the young man in traditional Chinese clothing hadn't tried to settle the score at the auction first, but had instead come to them to clear the air.

Just as Zhao Xu was about to get up, his back suddenly felt numb, and he was about to change his position.

But to his surprise, the stool he was sitting on made no sound at all.

Instantly, a loud bang echoed through the tavern, shattering the peace. In the next moment, everyone's eyes were fixed on Zhao Xu, with expressions ranging from admiration to awe.
I am deeply impressed that he was the first to stand out boldly.

"Ah, help has arrived?" the young man in traditional Chinese clothing sneered, leaning his entire body against the sofa behind him, looking at Zhao Xu with a leisurely gaze.
