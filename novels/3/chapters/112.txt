Chapter 113 Chance Encounter
After Zhao Xu's three roommates Zhang Qi, Chen Sinan, and Liu Hanqiang finished their evening elective classes, they returned to the dormitory to find Zhao Xu already eating curry chicken rice.
Zhang Qi spoke up when he saw the situation, "Xu Shao, are you secretly eating supper here alone?"
After saying this, he sat directly on the stool next to Zhao Xu and glanced at Zhao Xu's notebook, which was open to the official forum of "Arthur."
At the top was a long list of player names, including some skilled gamers and even famous live streamers, protesting that the difficulty level for mages in "Arthur" was set too high.
The streamers also made an additional request for "Arthur" to open a live streaming interface so they could broadcast game content.
Although "Arthur's" professional training had frustrated countless players, many people had noticed that the game's online player numbers had not decreased, causing some players who had originally given up on the game to come back and join again.
Many times, people play games just to have a common topic with friends.
"You're overthinking it," Zhang Qi chuckled after looking at the top post.
As a graduate of the successful warrior program, he naturally hoped that mage players would be stuck in training courses forever, so that the group of warrior players could take the lead.
"So they all deleted their accounts," Zhao Xu said softly, looking at the long list of bright red names with some regret.
"Oh, it's those players who can't learn spells and decided to protest together by quitting?" Zhang Qi immediately realized.
Here is the translation of the text:

However, after taking a look at the list, he felt curious. "I saw that there were at least hundreds of people responding in the group chat, and someone even said they would organize a thousand-person protest. But now, it seems there are only a few hundred people willing to take action."

At this point, Chen Siren had just finished washing his face and came out. He was putting his towel on the bed while saying, "Because someone had counted the numbers yesterday, and it turned out that most of the players who had completed the mage training had a relatively high IQ."

Hearing this, Zhang Qi couldn't help but laugh, "So now those who are still willing to sign the petition must be acknowledging their own low IQ. It's no wonder the response is not enthusiastic."

Zhao Xu stood silently to the side, smiling. He had actually used his old account to post that statistical chart, with the intention of encouraging these quitters to persevere.

After a month of fermentation, his article "Newbie Tenets" had become a hot topic, and the forum moderator had even recommended it as a must-read for newbies.

So he posted again, despite some people questioning the authenticity of the data, but more players who had completed the mage training came forward to verify this point.

"Just that 'Dong Cheng Liu' ID is really impressive," he said, "I don't know which girl can play games so well, and write out such a strategy on the first day."

At this moment, Zhang Qi opened his phone and took a look at the group chat, and then he began to understand what was going on.

Hearing this, Zhao Xu could only take a sip of water to calm down, not wanting to be suspected by others. He directly used the name of the heroine from an old comic.

"It's no use, I'll register a new account called 'Wu Ke Liu' and write a new article on newbie tenets," Zhang Qi said with a laugh.

However, Zhao Xu was already too lazy to bother with him, and he turned back to look at Liu Hanqiang, who was preparing to take the exam and was the only one in their dormitory who didn't play games.

"Are you going out, Hanqiang?" Zhao Xu asked.
Here is the translation of the text:

At this time, Liu Hanqiang was using hair gel to style his hair.

"Hey, someone's sweetheart has an appointment, and Xiaoyu from the next-door school will come over to visit him. I bet he won't come back tonight," Zhang Qi said with a smile.

"Hey, hey, don't sully someone's good name," Liu Hanqiang confidently retorted, "But Xiaoyu wants to come to our house, and she'll have to ask my parents for permission."

Zhao Xu's expression was somewhat lost, as Xiaoyu, who had played the same game as Liu Hanqiang in their previous life, didn't continue playing with him.

The disparity between the original pursuit and abandonment also caused Liu Hanqiang to feel lost for a period of time.

"Hanqiang, Xiaoyu is also playing this game. You can actually register a character with us and game together. Then you can arrange a meeting in the game," Zhao Xu thought aloud, his back facing the others. However, no one could see his expression.

Liu Hanqiang burst out laughing, "Xiaoyu told me about it, but I've only glanced at the content. This game is too easy for me to play, and there's no challenge at all. It would be humiliating for you all."

After that, he picked up his dress shirt from the closet, and walked out.

"Wow, so awesome," Zhang Qi said with a smirk, looking at Liu Hanqiang's disappearing back.

Meanwhile, Chen Sannan silently opened a book he had written himself and began reading it, as if he didn't care about the turbulence outside.

Zhao Xu unintentionally caused a commotion in the dorm room and could only knock on the door.

At this time, he opened the cabinet and found that the few bottles of vitamin C tea that had been left on top were gone. He looked at Zhang Qi with a bad temper and then left the dorm room to buy a box.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Hey, Xiao Shao, can you help me buy some stuff?" Zhang Qi said behind him, accompanied by the sound of Zhao Xiao's phone ringing.

The small shop in the northern district was far from Zhao Xiao's dormitory, and it was late at night, so there were fewer people running errands. Instead, many couples were hugging each other under the tree shades in front of the dormitory, cherishing the 11 o'clock bell.

Zhao Xiao was thinking about the knowledge about shape-shifting that Jin Long had told him, and analyzing the route ahead.

Shape-shifting was a crucial spell in the world of magic, and without it, the eight major factions of magic would lose their balance. Shape-shifting was not just one spell, but a series of spells, with the most important ones being the core four transformations: second-level shape-shifting, fourth-level shape-shifting, eighth-level shape-shifting, and ninth-level body transformation.

Because Jin Long had the ability to change his form, he could transform into a human. This was similar to the second-level spell of shape-shifting.

Jin Long didn't tell Zhao Xiao the secrets of the second-level spell of shape-shifting, which was something that An Tiya taught. There was no need for anyone else to learn from him.

Zhao Xiao had learned about the powerful spell of shape-shifting from An Tiya and knew that it was one of the causes of chaos in the era of disaster. He also knew that it was a way for the weak to fight back.

"Shape-shifting..." Zhao Xiao sighed deeply in his heart.

"Zhao Xiao?"

A female voice called out, making Zhao Xiao stop just as he was about to lift a box of vitamin C tea.
Here is the translation of the text:

He turned around in surprise, and it was his classmate, Cui Lu, a girl from his same grade. Compared to their last meeting, she was now alone this time. "I heard you're also a high-achiever, and you're interested in joining our class union, which is really strong, you know," Cui Lu said with her usual cheerful and lively personality, the kind that would make her confident enough to take the stage.

"No, it's not the right time," Zhao Xu smiled lightly and then picked up the box of lemon tea and headed towards the cashier.

Only after Zhao Xu finished paying with his card did he suddenly turn back and look at Cui Lu, who looked almost identical to how she did ten years ago.

After becoming a patroller and then taking over as the president of the class union, Cui Lu eventually led the entire university alliance, relying on her influence. However, in their previous life, their class was able to transcend time and still be united, and Zhao Xu could get help from his classmates, which was partly due to the Cui Lu in front of him.

He felt a sense of nostalgia and said, "Lu Lu, I have a suggestion for you, don't use dual-wielding combat, just go for archery skills."
