Chapter 418: Legendary Weakness

Zhao Xu saw the golden statue in front of him, almost stunned.

How could this ordinary statue in front of the door suddenly become a legendary-level golden statue?

This leveling up was a bit exaggerated, and it had doubled instantly.

Not to mention that there were already over a hundred of the four types of statues, which had already driven them to the brink of death.

As he was still walking through the door, Zhao Xu felt that by the time he finished, he would definitely be a 7-level player.

But as he looked at the legendary golden statue in front of him, Zhao Xu felt a sense of nostalgia.

He thought back to the time when he was at the experimental site of An Tiya, where he had seen those legendary statues.

"Teacher, these legendary statues are quite expensive, aren't they?" Zhao Xu speculated.

The statues looked similar to iron statues, but had an extra layer of golden luster.

"It's reasonable, like this golden statue. The original material cost is 40 tons of pure iron, and then use the blessing spell to transform the golden surface. The main requirement is for the caster to be at least 30 levels, and the total cost is estimated to be 500,000 gold coins."

"This is too expensive!" Zhao Xu said, looking at the nearly perfect streamline design, which made him feel a sense of unease.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Yes, this thing is enormous in size and can give people a sense of safety. The special ability of this golden statue is 'treading attack', and as long as it steps on something smaller, it can deal around 38 to 110 points of damage (8D10+30)."

"The silver statue is around level 21, but this golden statue is around level 25 and is quite sturdy."

...At this moment, Zhao Xu saw the golden statue lifting its extremely thick leg and was about to stomp towards them.

Luckily, the silver statue, which was slightly smaller but still enormous in size, directly blocked the golden statue's attack.

"Vivian, be careful," Zhao Xu shouted. "The attack power of this golden statue is over 60 levels."

He looked at the golden statue wielding a giant sword, his heart racing with fear.

Not to mention being stepped on solidly, even just being struck by the sword would deal around 26-80 (6D10+20) points of damage.

The sword's blade emitted a cold, icy glare, and it was almost certain to be a magical weapon.

Even with Zhao Xu's Starlight Cloak, he wouldn't be able to withstand the damage and would likely die from the attack.

Vivian, who had added her 3rd-level Saint Warrior level, would also not be able to withstand the golden statue's devastating blow, with her life points barely reaching 50.

The golden statue before them was an existence that lacked group attacks but had single-target attacks and impressive self-defense capabilities.

Even Zhao Xu had to be extremely careful, lest he be crushed to a pulp.

"Bang!"

With a loud crash, the two statues, each weighing almost a hundred tons, collided, sending sparks flying everywhere.
Here is the translation:

The Golden Magic Statue only needed to take one step towards the ground to cause a vibration that could be felt within a hundred meters. As Zhao Xu issued the command, the two legendary magic statues began to clash with each other in the empty hall surrounded by mist.

In an instant, Zhao Xu also discovered the weaknesses of the two legendary magic statues. They were like two nearly unbeatable warriors, possessing sufficient strength, but could only attack one enemy at a time.

The Golden Magic Statue's attack crushed the opponent's defense, and each attack was like a direct blow to the flesh, causing a loud explosion-like sound to echo throughout the square.

However, Zhao Xu soon noticed that the Silver Magic Statue suffered more severe injuries after each attack.

Although the Golden Magic Statue's defense was broken, its injuries were quickly healed to some extent.

Vivia frowned in concern.

"The Golden Magic Statue's damage reduction ability is effective, but the Silver Magic Statue's is ineffective."
This was equivalent to the Silver Magic Statue's damage being discounted each time, and its overall life value was already lower than the Golden Magic Statue's, causing less damage.

If the Silver Magic Statue had not activated its "Agility" ability each time, allowing it to attack multiple times in the same situation, the gap between the two would have widened even further.

"It seems a bit strange," Zhao Xu concluded, looking puzzled.

"What's strange?" Vivia asked, holding up her sword and shield, having moved to Zhao Xu's side. Although only one Golden Magic Statue was visible, who knew what else was hidden in the thick fog.
Here is the translation of the text:

"The damage caused has a slight gap," Zhao Xu analyzed.

"Their ability to reduce damage, I'm afraid, is not just 20 points. Could it be that these ancient demons have even stronger self-healing abilities?"

In reality, Zhao Xu's luck had been good so far.

The monsters he encountered were mostly basic versions, and he rarely faced those that had undergone enhancements, so the difficulty was not high.

But the ones with professional abilities, even those that had obtained extraordinary abilities through mutations, were the most infuriating.

For example, Vivian had acquired the 3rd-level Saint Warrior ability and stacked multiple abilities, making her extremely formidable.

"The Silver Demon is almost unable to withstand it," Vivian said anxiously.

At this moment, the Silver Demon was taking a punch from the Golden Demon and was already shaking, with many parts of its armor cracked and broken.

"That's enough testing," Zhao Xu nodded, having roughly seen the true gap in strength between the two.

Originally, the balance was not so unbalanced, but after the damage reduction ability was greatly enhanced, it naturally tilted towards the Golden Demon.

"Ah? Do you have a plan?"

"I'll leave it to you," Zhao Xu smiled and replied.

Although the two legendary demons were not like ordinary demons and could not be countered with corresponding spells, they were almost completely immune to magic.

"However, we can't really break through the Golden Demon's defense. After all, it relies on its inherent defense shield with more than 30 levels of natural defense."

Vivian understood Zhao Xu's meaning.

When Zhao Xu had the "Ghost Strike" that lasted only one round but could ignore all armor and magic, he could ignore all armor and magic.
Here is the translation:

He can make all the monsters that rely on high defense to survive kneel down and call him "daddy".

"Ghost Strike" is the key ability that Zhao Xu, as a mage, can output.

Compared to other mages, Zhao Xu's melee output is even more exaggerated and terrifying.

This is because other mages, even if they master "Ghost Strike", still need to use a six-ring spell to instantaneously cast this spell or directly delay the spell.

Only in this way can they launch a critical hit on the monster within a short duration of one or two rounds.

But he, with every strike, has "Ghost Strike" built-in.

Arthur once said, "When an ability can last for 24 hours, it's a fixed ability. What's the point of having it?" Vivi asked curiously.

After a few rounds of intense battle, the silver golem-like monster looked exhausted and helpless. They would be too late to intervene in the battle again.

"Can you block the 'Tread Attack' of the golden golem?" Zhao Xu asked in surprise.

"No," Saint Warrior Vivi replied honestly, shaking her head. She wouldn't lie even if she had full confidence.

After all, it's a legendary-level monster, and Arthur would be able to calculate the exact number of its strength.

"That's it," Zhao Xu said.

"We have a saying on Earth: A gentleman does not stand in a dangerous place. So, there's no need to go up and exchange lives with the golden golem."

After saying this, Zhao Xu directly lifted the staff in his hand and lightly tapped the area in front of him, as if a bird was flying over the water.

"Ghost Hand."

Instantly, a small, translucent hand appeared behind the golden golem.

As long as this ghost hand can successfully attack the opponent, he can cast a low-rank touch spell on the opponent.

Zhao Xu felt sorry in his heart.
Here is the translation of the text:

The touch of the spell also ignores armor, and the defense of the gold golem is entirely based on armor. Similarly, the spell that ignores resistances also ignores magical immunity. At the same time, the bio-constructed creature is not immune to attribute damage. The answer is obvious.

"The Secondary Chill of Touch."
Super Magical Control—"Spell Extreme Effect" stacks with "Spell Twin Birth"!
The instant one-ring spell "Secondary Chill of Touch" can only deal 1-6 points of agility damage. However, after Zhao Xun's two expertise skills upgrade, this spell that originally required a one-ring spell slot can now be released using an eight-ring spell slot.
But Zhao Xun uses his Super Magical Control ability to release the spell, consuming only one ring spell slot.
With the two effects combined, the agility damage suddenly becomes 12 points, causing the 9-point agility gold golem to be directly knocked into a helpless state.
The massive body, which was originally about to unleash a swift and powerful punch, lost all its strength.
Although the gold golem had more than 51 points of strength.
However, after Zhao Xun obtained almost complete information about the opponent, he discovered that the gold golem only had 9 points of agility.
Even difficult questions are not questions.
"Boom."
Another massive explosion came, this time causing the gold golem to fall to the ground, creating a huge whirlwind that blew away a considerable amount of fog.
Zhao Xun walked slowly towards the gold golem, which was lying on the ground, not much shorter than him, and let out a gentle sigh.
Indeed, the monster that leaked information is an easy target for a spellcaster like him who has a comprehensive grasp of magic.

In actual combat, the battle had already ended as soon as Zhao Xun searched for the gold golem's agility attribute.
Here is the translation of the text:

Even though he could cause 3-18 (3D6) points of chill to touch with just a ring, he refused to do so and directly used a lower-level spell "Secondary Chill Touch" instead.

Zhao Xuzhen was about to cast Chill Touch, but he stacked two expertise skills and dealt a total of 36 points of agility damage.

At this moment, Zhao Xuzhen directly pulled out another copper ball from his hand.

As long as he had 11 points of intelligence, he should have reacted by now.

The copper ball just dispelled corresponded to a silver mirror demon, and the remaining one corresponded to a gold demon.

However.

The thick fog just scattered again, and everything seemed normal again.

"Executive, shouldn't we eliminate these demons first? The mysterious symbols on those demons were also released after being eliminated."

Vivian, with her 16 points of intelligence, proposed a suggestion to Zhao Xuzhen.

"Yes, Vivian, you're right."

At this moment, Zhao Xuzhen's task was almost complete, and he felt relieved in his heart. He directly raised his hand to indicate an attack on the silver mirror demon behind him.

He also held up the power scroll in his hand.

After activating the double attack of the staff, he directly struck the gold demon.

Normally, he wouldn't even leave a scratch, but his ghostly technique could penetrate the damage and make it penetrate.

【Adventurer Zhong Xia, you have dealt 25 HP damage to the gold demon, and the damage is reduced due to the demon's damage reduction ability, resulting in 0 damage.]
