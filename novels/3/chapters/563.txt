Chapter 564: Obtaining the Divine Artifact, the Book of Ten Thousand Laws

"Look at this," Zhao Xu said, holding out a black-bound notebook to the crowd.

"This notebook can help you advance to the next level forcibly," he said.

Hearing this, Lei An's eyes widened in shock, and his face contorted with a mixture of confusion and hesitation.

"I'm really...," Lei An's voice trailed off as he looked at the notebook with a mixture of pain and reluctance.

"Can't you use it? Or do you want to use the identification technique first?" Zhao Xu asked, looking puzzled.

Zhao Xu could say that he had invested blood and tears in a legendary strongman who had yet to fulfill his promise.

Because he had not yet thought of a plan for the 10th level of divine arts, he did not rush to read this notebook.

Otherwise, in the five-ring law, such as the revival technique, is still quite useful.

"I've taken too many advantages, and I'm not afraid to take more," Lei An sighed. "Do you believe that after I finish reading this book, I'll become a 21-level mage, but I won't master legendary magic?"

"What's the point of breaking through to legendary if I still have to struggle?" Lei An said with a tone of a veteran.

"Magic identification, knowledge (mystery) skills, and the accumulation of knowledge are difficult to imagine in the later stages," Lei An said with a tone of a veteran.
Here is the translation of the text:

"I used to take advantage of every situation, as if I had transcended the boundaries of the mortal world. Although I looked the same as you, my mental age was actually the same as my physical age. It's not like those ancient beings like Vilanelle, who have lived for thousands of years and still look like teenagers. Or maybe you're like Anziti, my mentor..."

As soon as he finished speaking, he realized he had just offended Vilanelle, who was the only non-human among the seven giants and couldn't hear him anyway.

But the person in front of him was Anziti's legitimate disciple, and he didn't know if this nine-ring mage would become a corpse on the street tomorrow.

"So, let's get back to the topic. The apprentices who entered the Floating Sky City at the same time as me may still be three-ring mages now."

"Your foundation is even looser than mine?" Zhao Xue raised an eyebrow.

As an eight-month, nine-level mage, he was already an exemplary case of a shaky foundation, and he was too afraid to upgrade.

But the other person suddenly revealed that he was also a nine-ring mage who had been studying in the "Time Secret Realm" for over a hundred years.

"What's this 'Time Secret Realm'?" Zhao Xue suddenly heard the unfamiliar name.

"This...," Rean hesitated.

But thinking about the other person's identity, he continued, "It's a place that's extremely mysterious. In that place, one year is equivalent to a hundred years outside."

"In that process, you feel no change in your body or mind at all. You know that if you're in a half-plane with slower time flow, your body will age, and your mind will also become more intelligent. But the Time Secret Realm is incredibly magical, as if everything has been frozen in time."
Here is the translation of the text:

"In addition, what's crucial is that in the temporal realm, you can acquire sufficient knowledge and accumulate it. Whatever questions you have, mysterious figures will provide answers within a short while. Therefore, the accumulation I lacked was supplemented by spending nearly a century in the temporal realm.

As for when I emerged, Arthur had already passed away less than a hundred days later," said Rayan, revealing a hint of unease.

"Isn't it unlikely to affect one's mental state?" Zhao Xuan reacted quickly.

He was aware that the temporal flow was extremely slow in the intermediate dimension, where he spent a hundred years, while Arthur might have only spent a year.

Former players, lacking the ability to traverse dimensions, failed to notice that Arthur was a real world.

However, slowing down the pace for a hundred years was of no use, as it only brought about the same aging effect, and most intermediate dimensions were barren. Staying there for a hundred years and being imprisoned for the same period were equally irrelevant.

Mages must broaden their knowledge by reading various classics, exploring mysteries, researching, and even conducting magical experiments.

It's not just a casual remark for a poor warrior to claim to be a rich mage.

Rayan could still accumulate knowledge, indicating that the "Arcane Realm" could provide sufficient "knowledge volume" like the floating city's legendary library.

Moreover, considering Rayan's personality, it was impossible for him to be content with reading for a hundred years.

It was as if every day was the first day. The feeling of fatigue was non-existent.

In the world of martial arts, falling off a cliff and gaining divine abilities was nothing compared to this treatment.

"Don't fantasize about this. Even if you have the qualifications to enter, you'll only have one chance to enter before the legend. Therefore, mages with ambitions will all delay their breakthrough to the legendary realm, wanting to rely on the extra century of accumulation to complete the crucial leap."
Here is the translation of the text:

As Lei An furrowed his brow, saying "I went too fast before, the association wanted me to quickly advance to the ninth circle, so they arranged for me to complete the training ahead of time. As a result, the accumulation of experience supported me all the way to the edge of becoming a legend."

Zhao Xu also understood the opponent's intentions, which meant that he was probably arranged to break through to become a legend before that.

At that time, to outsiders, he would have become a legend overnight, almost mythical.

However, due to the huge gap between Lei An's accumulation and the number of circles, he needed to pull out all the stops to accelerate the process, which ultimately wasted this opportunity.

But looking at Lei An's expression, there was no sign of regret.

It seemed that he had relied on his own accumulation, and it would probably take a hundred years for him to become an eighth circle mage.

"Alright, let me take a look at what you're holding there."

Lei An said, and began to use his defensive magic to compress the time it took to cast the "Identification" spell to a single round, starting to identify the notebook provided by Zhao Xu.

"What is this thing? Is it a book that can enhance knowledge and insight, like the notes of a legendary mage, or a secret manuscript that simulates the web of magic, or is it a handwritten notebook by the goddess of magic, Sylvana?"

As Lei An's identification spell had already scanned the notebook, a bright light fell on it.

"It's not any of those things, it's just a forced upgrade," Zhao Xu said.

"What kind of joke is this? A real upgrade is called a legendary artifact, like the Holy Scripture or the Dark Scripture, which can produce such an effect."

Lei An nodded slightly and said, his eyes widening in surprise.

"Wow! This is a real upgrade, do you know what it's called?"

As he spoke, Lei An directly pointed to the book in Zhao Xu's hand, his fingers trembling.

The girls nearby, who were recording the text, were shocked and turned their gaze towards the scene, curious about what would happen next.
Here is the translation of the text:

"This thing is good enough to be considered a divine artifact, and yet it has no side effects whatsoever," he said, his face trembling as he spoke. "If I really rely on this thing, I'm not sure if I can really break through to the legendary level! Become a legendary mage."

Looking at Zhao Xu with an unusual gaze, Lei An asked, "Are you really willing to give me such a precious thing?"

"If you really can take care of Yang Nan and lead him astray for me, then I won't hesitate to give you this thing," Zhao Xu said, his expression changing as he thought about the two opportunities he had wasted earlier.

"It's okay," Lei An said, his tone growing more determined. "If I can really enter the legendary level, let Yang Nan drive me for fifty years, and that's more valuable than accumulating wealth for a hundred years."

As Lei An approached the legendary level, he realized how far he was from it.

"I'll go and prepare myself for a while," he said, and his figure disappeared in an instant, as if he was afraid Zhao Xu would change his mind.

"Master, I'll enter some of my divine energy into this notebook, and maybe it can really become your familiar," Lark said, suddenly appearing.

"Ah, I thought you'd been consumed by the divine power," Zhao Xu replied.

"Haha, no way," Lark said, excitedly.

"Master, there are now over 600 million people, and it's a waste to ignore them. So I want to discuss something with you."

"Uh?" Zhao Xu asked.
Here is the translation:

Zhao Xu said, "I want to shift my focus to Miss Xu, otherwise her strength is too weak, and it's a waste of this preaching opportunity, accumulating for several months, and it's amazing that no pastor has been developed."

"Rakshas, I'm starting to feel that you're destined to become a god," Zhao Xu said.

"Hehe, that's not the point," Rakshas said proudly, "after all, according to the prophecy, we are one."

"Master, think about it, you are a god, how can you make me, who is destined to become your sacred vessel, warm your bed?" Rakshas said, becoming more agitated.

"The main thing is that we missed this opportunity too much. Especially since the 'Saintly Catastrophe' is about to arrive, I must adjust the original plan, or we won't be able to grasp the greatest benefits in this chaotic crisis."

Zhao Xu slightly furrowed his brow, "The plan is not as flexible as change."

In reality, he also realized that if he could grasp a force of faith that belonged to himself, the entire Nian would be easier to grasp.

The countless believers were his eyes and ears.

With supernatural abilities, various magical powers, and miracles, the number of believers was definitely more than tens of thousands on Earth.

"Well, then go, remember to be safe, and bring those two legendary demons along," Zhao Xu instructed.

"Hehe, Master, you're being so generous, if it weren't for your gaze without any special desires, I would have doubted that you have strange thoughts about Pastor Xu," Rakshas said.

"Just get on with it," Zhao Xu almost didn't bother to respond to this god who loved to gossip.

However, Master, this time I'm leaving just my spirit, and my body is still yours."

"Thanks," Zhao Xu didn't show any abnormal reaction.
Here is the translation of the given text:

"So, this time, I will take on a form that can be used as a certain kind of divine artifact, leaving it for you to use. You can be considered to have obtained a new divine artifact before I return, essentially."

"This way, when you're searching for the wizard seeds for Miss Anniya's sake, you'll be able to disguise yourself as a high-ranking wizard and won't attract too much attention to yourself."

"That means, isn't it the same as before when you transformed?"

"Yes, and this time, I've left behind the power of the divine fragments, which will allow it to maintain its form..."

"The Book of All Laws."

"Lakshmi, I feel like I've become stronger since you left, but you've actually left?"

Note: Lakshmi is likely a character's name in the context of the story.
