Chapter 030: The Female Lawmaker

Zhao Xu heard these words and turned his head to look at the nearby An Tiya, who was still wearing a mysterious expression, showing no signs of opposition.

Zhao Xu felt that the old law teacher was acting strangely, but he didn't hesitate for long and took a step forward towards the front.

At this moment, all the apprentice lawyers in the audience were sitting quietly, gazing at the first person to take the initiative, Zhao Xu.

Even the most arrogant players, who had been beaten by Arthur's law training for two weeks, would not have been able to bear it, and many would have deleted their accounts and left. However, these remaining players who could persevere were never lacking in patience.

But many players couldn't help but whisper to each other, saying that Arthur's game would not have any in-game purchases, and everything would depend on individual abilities.

Why did Zhao Xu, who looked completely unremarkable and showed no signs of talent, have special treatment and could go straight to the stage without saying a word?

Arthur's native apprentices were secretly analyzing the young man's background.

Two weeks ago, a group of adventurers from another world had projected themselves into Arthur's message, and many law apprentice students from noble families had received the message.

They didn't leave the floating city and had private internal channels.

Furthermore, after interacting with each other for ten days, they had realized the existence of these players who claimed to be players and how they had achieved rapid law training, reaching the level of their year-long or even decade-long efforts.

Under the gaze of many, Zhao Xu's face turned red, and he finally felt like he was in the scenario from the Harry Potter movie where the sorting hat is placed on the head.

In the end, Zhao Xu slowly walked up to the stage.
Here is the translation of the text:

He focused his gaze directly on the existence known as the "Secret Throne". The platform on the stage was not flat, and the stone platform was not covered with a carpet. Various intricate carvings on the platform were filled with the marks of time.

Mistral, numerous novice mages had completed their studies after years of hardship and stood on this stage, starting their own journey of adventure.

When Zhao Xu walked up to the throne, he found that it was already covered with dense scratches. He couldn't help but wonder if it had been affected by some kind of magical shock.

Suddenly, his eyes revealed a hint of incredulity. The throne, which was over two meters tall and made of secret silver, was at least one tonne in weight. It was worth at least 2 million gold coins. It could even be worth more.

Zhao Xu laughed, finally gaining an understanding. He had finally touched a million-gold-coin item.

As for the +12 legendary intelligence headband worn by Ana Noya, it was hidden under her cloak and mask, just like her face was impossible to see.

"Don't bother calculating the value of this thing," he said. "Hurry up and sit down. I'll take you to see the mage's battle later."

Zhao Xu's body suddenly went numb, and his mind directly emitted Ana Noya's voice.

His mental stability was still good, and he didn't turn back to look at Ana Noya.

Although he had never touched her, Zhao Xu focused his attention on the light circle on his character panel, muttering to himself like a madman: "Teacher, can you hear my voice?"

"What's the point? This is a five-level mind link. It must be able to communicate in both directions."
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu slowly turned around and sat directly on the "secret throne". He exchanged glances with the new law enforcement officers below, giving him a sense of looking down on himself.

Feeling the cold metal of the throne, Zhao Xu tried to reach out and touch the armrest.

"This is the throne of the ancient king Oberon, who ruled in the distant past," he said. "Later, we excavated it and used it as a medium for the awakening ritual. With its power, the success rate of the ritual can be increased to over 80%."

"Teacher, isn't the success rate 100%?" Zhao Xu asked.

"What have you seen that's 100%?" he replied.

Hearing this, Zhao Xu couldn't help but curse the second-hand information that had killed people.

In his past life, he had never heard anyone mention such a thing.

It's not 100%, that's not deceiving people?!

Why hasn't anyone mentioned this on the forum these few days?!

Just as Zhao Xu was about to think more.

A beam of light poured down from above his head, bathing him in a warm, multicolored glow. The light flowed down to the ground, following the patterns of the runes.

The people below couldn't help but stare, their mouths agape.

Even the old, aged law enforcement officer's hands were trembling slightly.

He kept thinking about the past hundred years, wondering if anyone had ever seen such a phenomenon.

Zhao Xu didn't notice any of this, and the scene in front of him suddenly transformed into a massive, circular library, with countless books stacked to the sky.

In front of the book piles was a female law enforcement officer, wearing a golden silk robe with a wine-red outer garment. She seemed to be bathed in the long river of time, both the beginning and the end.
Here is the translation:

Zhao Xu's thoughts were filled with a sense of wonder as he gazed at the woman slowly approaching him, as if she were about to materialize and serve him. Suddenly, Zhao Xu closed his eyes tightly.

He remembered that he had come to accept a ritual with a failure rate. The wizard's awakening also had a demon from the depths of the abyss, not to mention the demon's temptation.

Zhao Xu was afraid that this might be a test. He clenched his eyes shut and muttered a prayer to himself, repeatedly reciting the first-level spell "Protect Against Evil" he had copied down.

At the same time, he mumbled to himself, "Don't kiss me, don't kiss me." Although he couldn't actually cast a spell, he could only pretend to be a hero.

Zhao Xu had participated in battles against the abyss and hell, and he was clear that demons like the one before him could change their forms to deceive men. He had a friend who was lured by the demon and had his level reduced from 5 to 0, and his body had directly decayed.

"Really interesting. I'm waiting for you in the future."

The voice was like a sacred chant.

Zhao Xu didn't flinch, and slowly, he felt the cold sensation in his buttocks.

"Open your eyes, the ritual is complete."

Zhao Xu, who had been about to listen, suddenly shuddered all over his body, muttering to himself, "What a fool I am."

It was clear that the demon's projection was incredibly powerful, and it could even mimic the voice of Anna Noel. However, Zhao Xu didn't have the courage to laugh at his opponent.

He continued to guard his heart, instilling in himself various unyielding convictions.

"Got it, you idiot."
Here is the translation of the text to English:

This time, Anshenya's voice suddenly appeared in his mind.

Immediately, Zhao Xu felt his hand being grabbed, and he felt the warmth of a palm touching his skin.

The familiar sensation of transmission came to his mind, and he directly chose to accept.

It wasn't until the transmission delay sensation disappeared that Zhao Xu finally opened his eyes slightly.

Outside his field of vision was an endless expanse of sky.

"'The Fangjian Tower.'"
"'This is the highest place in this floating city.'"
Anshenya said, standing in front of him.

"Before going to battle, let's talk about what you just saw."
