Chapter 322: Student Background

After exchanging with the dean of the Administrative College, Zhao Xu followed the secretary to the class he was responsible for. This time, Zhao Xu was appointed as a teacher, but his role was more like a "nanny" who had to take care of everything, without any specific teaching responsibilities.

The Administrative College had a unique teaching position that did not have a fixed schedule, so Zhao Xu had to rely on his sense of responsibility to manage his workload.

Initially, he was puzzled by the fact that five players had entered the Administrative College. It wasn't until he saw the class list that he realized that all five players were apprentices of the Thaumaturgy Guild.

Arthur, apart from the eleven core occupations, also had many extended occupations, such as the "Crusader" system in the Nine Swords system, including "Warrior" and "Master of the Sword".

However, these extended occupations were not initially available to players to choose from and could only be obtained through post-employment or accidental promotion.

But there were five auxiliary occupations in Arthur's system, namely "Warrior", "Guide", "Expert", "Noble", and "Commoner", which far outnumbered the eleven core occupations.

These auxiliary occupations were generally weaker than the core occupations of warriors and mages, and could not awaken the "Character Card" system, so only those who could not advance smoothly or could not afford to join the Professional Association would choose them.

Zhao Xu, who had previously impersonated a "Guide", was the only occupation in the system that could cast spells.

The mentor profession is a unique profession that allows individuals to acquire magical powers. Most people who do not have a natural talent for magic or divinity will choose to become a mentor. Mentor Zhao's class is primarily composed of mentor professionals, with a few sorcerers remaining. The course arrangement is mainly focused on accepting specialized training in magic and introducing basic magical knowledge.

The class has 30 people, with only 8 sorcerers, including 5 earth players and 3 Arthur residents, and the remaining 22 people are all Arthur residents with a mentor profession. This is due to the special nature of the sorcerer profession.

Generally speaking, a sorcerer's magical power comes from their own bloodline. Sorcerers typically begin to exhibit their original magical abilities during their teenage years. Many novice sorcerers have unintentionally displayed magical powers, often losing control. As a result, novice sorcerers often find themselves surrounded by strange noises and lights in their own homes, leading others to believe that they are haunted by supernatural forces.

In the magical civilization of Mistral, many families of wizards have produced sorcerers over the generations, with some even marrying into mysterious families and producing sorcerers. Therefore, local sorcerers in Mistral are often raised at home by older sorcerers, who guide them in using their innate powers.

However, players who do not have family backgrounds naturally do not have guidance. Similarly, ordinary people who suddenly awaken to sorcerer powers also face the same predicament.

As a result, Mistral has set up a specialized "class" at the Ministry of Education, inviting relevant professionals to cultivate these "sorcerers" who lack family roots.

As for some secluded areas of the Arthurian knights, they may be feared and misunderstood by their friends and family due to their magical power, and they may have been relatively isolated since childhood.

There are also individuals who were born into families of mages, but their magical abilities and methods are different from those of the mages, and they require specialized training, which can only be provided by the Mistral.

After considering these factors, Zhao Xu couldn't help but glance at the secretary beside him, who was also a member of the "mentor" profession.

"What about their previous mentor?" he asked.

The secretary's face immediately turned pale, with a hint of embarrassment, but he had to confess, "They are still at the 'Mistral's Hospital' for treatment."

Any injury treated by a priest's divine magic, even if the patient was on the verge of death just yesterday, will recover significantly as long as the life force is restored. The process of treatment itself will also accelerate the healing of wounds to their original state.

This is the miraculous aspect of treatment magic.

Unless a limb or leg is severely damaged and requires the "regeneration" spell to recover, most severe injuries can be treated with a single "treatment" spell.

However, the priest's magical abilities are limited, and ordinary people who do not contribute enough will not be allocated.

Therefore, most injuries will seek treatment at the "Hospital," where medical doctors with "medical" skills will diagnose and treat them.

At first glance, the fact that the secretary who lives at the hospital seems reasonable.

However, it is necessary to find a way to get Zhao Xu, an outsider, to take over the class. Can a normal person even treat a minor injury?

The secretary, who is also a "mentor," has limited magical abilities and a daily magical quota.

Still, the secretary is able to treat minor injuries.

"Why doesn't he want to teach?" Zhao Xu asked. "Is there a problem with the class?"
Here is the translation of the text:

"Don't want to work, but can't give up the benefits of the job, so 'playing sick' is indeed the first choice for many people.

The female secretary didn't expect that the scholar-looking person in front of her, who seemed refined and comfortable to be around, would suddenly notice this point.

Thinking that the dean hadn't directly revealed the situation, fearing that this scholar would know the difficulty and retreat.

The female secretary was immediately perplexed, only able to awkwardly say: "Actually, the original female class director got pregnant and went to give birth, and that scholar took over. The new class director is too strict, unable to accept students not coming to class, so he went to visit the students' homes to force them to come to class."

"The result was that all the students in the class became a nuisance, and the scholar was brutally treated. Later, he felt he couldn't accept such humiliation and stayed in the hospital."

"What's 'brutally treated'?"
Zhao Xu didn't understand, what era was this?

Even on Earth, there are few cases of an entire class of students deliberately bullying and retaliating against their teachers, even in schools with chaotic management, it would never come to this. Such things usually only appear in movie and TV scenarios.

After the female secretary revealed the truth, it seemed that the rest wasn't so hard to talk about, and she continued to reveal that "many students in this class are descendants of the Mistralth family, but without the talent to become wizards, they had to become 'guides' under family arrangements."
Here is the translation of the text into English:

"They didn't come to school regularly, and some of them even cut classes. As a result, they were forced to come to school and started causing trouble, leading to the events that followed. Zhao Xu didn't expect that half of the trouble was caused by their players.

Those players were bored and had nothing to do, so they thought the storyline on TV was interesting and saw an opportunity to take advantage of the situation. They started acting like dogs trying to curry favor.

Zhao Xu finally understood the headache the school principal was going through.

In some remote towns, the other party, as a three-ring wizard, could become a mid-level or high-level official in the local wizarding association.

For example, in a town like Zhuanxing, with better luck and being younger, the deputy chairman is always qualified. However, in a place like Mistralla with many nine-ring wizards, a three-ring wizard is still someone nobody wants to mess with.

Confronted with a wizarding family that has seven- to nine-ring wizards, even talking to them is intimidating.

The female secretary finished speaking, but then saw Zhao Xu's expression remained calm and normal, with no hint of annoyance or disappointment, as if what she had just heard was just a minor issue that could be easily brushed off.

The female secretary couldn't help but wonder how strange this was. Although this scholar had initially noticed something suspicious, he now seemed to be ignoring it.

Did he not know that Mistralla was under the joint rule of a goddess and a wizard?

A wizarding family with many connections through years of intermarriage could possibly be linked to a legendary wizard. The power of a legendary wizard was enough to flip over two or three ordinary small towns."
Here is the translation of the text into English:

Zhao Xu's former mentor, with deliberate intent, paid a visit to the opponent's home, which was actually a way to take advantage of the situation and to show off in front of the wizarding family, equivalent to seeking recognition through flattery. However, he was eventually overwhelmed by the reality of education and had to feign illness to escape.

Zhao Xu was still holding his cane and walking slowly, taking one step at a time, measuring the small path lined with maple trees.

He looked calm and peaceful, occasionally lowering his head to gaze at the frosty red leaves scattered on the ground, appreciating the tranquility of the autumn scene.

The female secretary, who had been watching Zhao Xu's indifferent expression, finally couldn't help but speak up as she was about to leave the floor: "Mr. Zhongxia, you should prepare some gold coins and try to bribe those wizards. They may not have much money, but they are your only option to buy them off."

"It's likely that they will help you clear the way for your future teaching career, which will definitely be smoother."

Zhao Xu was taken aback by the unexpected consideration from the woman he had just met.

However, just then, he suddenly stopped, holding his cane on the ground, causing a crisp sound to echo from the stone pavement, "Let's see if it's my cane or their background that's strong!"
