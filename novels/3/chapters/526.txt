Chapter 527: Difficult to Hit, Group Suffocation

[PS: The previous chapter should have ended with the "Nine Rings' Soul Binding Spell", not the "Eight Rings' Soul Binding Spell".]

Each resurrection stone is an automatic trigger for the "Nine Rings' Complete Resurrection Spell".

It can be said that the resurrection stone has become the strongest resurrection method under the "Kill and Give Life" supernatural power wielded by the gods.

However, its premise is that the soul is willing to revive.

Just as a sailboat must first be allowed to enter the sea.

As the sneak attacker who had been shouting and trying to steal a sneak attack was about to throw the poison dagger in his hand and display his new special move, he was suddenly enveloped by a mysterious green light emitted by the palm-sized bone wand held by Zhong Xia.

The light spread out like smoke, and when it got closer, it looked like ink splashing, and it completely wrapped the sneak attacker's body.

The next second, all the scenes began to rewind.

A death energy burst out of the sneak attacker's body, sucking out a faint blue soul energy and transforming into a small whirlwind-like energy that slowly absorbed into the emerald-green gemstone at the tip of the wand.

However, no one noticed.

At the moment Zhong Xia released the mysterious spell, the sneak attacker had already quietly and silently died.

The Soul Binding Spell had simply extracted the lingering soul from his body.

Using the wand did not require any additional action, and Zhao Xu's action was essentially a silent and invisible spellcasting routine, hiding the action and sound.
Here is the translation of the text:

With the expertise in "Far-Range Magic", he cast the three-touch spell "Vampire's Touch" on the wandering soul from a distance of several meters away. Under the premise of extreme effectiveness, the 60-point damage instantly killed the wandering soul and also granted Zhao Xu a temporary increase of nearly 30 points in life value.

"Ah!"
"What's going on?"
"Is it a death spell?"
"How can that be? The death curse is only level 7."
"This effect is really eerie?"
"It's no surprise that the first player can do this with a single spell."
"It might not be a low-level damage spell."
"Don't be silly, do you think this kind of situation is possible for a low-level spell?"
The discussion among the crowd was chaotic and noisy for a while.

However, as long as you don't act foolishly, everyone knows that the bone staff in Zhao Xu's hand is absolutely extraordinary.

But at this moment, no one had guessed.

The wandering soul did not choose to revive and disappear. Instead, his soul was trapped in the topaz at the tip of the staff.

"What's wrong with that kid? Why hasn't he chosen to revive and disappear?" At this moment, the other wandering souls who had come to investigate also looked on in shock at the scene unfolding before them.

The first player, Xia, did not obtain the divine artifact in the Hall of Aeolo, and the crowd also recently learned about it.

So they had been lying in ambush for several days, waiting for the right moment to strike.

And Zhao Xu lightly picked up the legendary staff, blew off the light smoke and dust on the topaz, and slowly walked towards the corpse.

"Soul Binding" is a level 9 necromancy spell that is permanently effective.
Here is the translation of the text:

The spell extracts the soul of a just-deceased being and confines it within a deep blue gemstone. Once confined, the soul cannot be revived through cloning, resurrection, rebirth, or even miraculous means. The only way to release the soul is to destroy or dispel the magic on the gemstone. However, the being remains in a state of death.

Suddenly, a group of wanderers emerged, led by a diminutive leader who glared at Zhao Xu with anger. "You killed our comrade?" he growled. "According to the code of our brotherhood, we take revenge with blood for blood and tooth for tooth."

To test Zhao Xu's resolve, they equipped him with their finest weapons, including a pair of daggers with saw-like edges, worth over 8,000 gold coins, known as the "Poisonous Knife."

Zhao Xu couldn't help but laugh at the absurdity of the situation. "Didn't we already agree to take responsibility for life and death?" he asked.

The fountain square, previously bustling with activity, was now filled with laughter as players gathered to watch the commotion.

The leader of the wanderers' face turned white as he gazed at Zhao Xu's feet, where the corpse was still lying. He turned to his companions and instructed, "Hurry up and revive the corpse and send it back."

One of the companions whispered, "At least 20 minutes of cooling time, the corpse is still too fresh."

The wanderer player looked furious and exclaimed, "What a moron! You'd better get online and remind him to choose direct revival, that idiot!"
Here is the translation of the text:

According to the rules of battle, even the equipment on the corpses can be taken away, and it will be considered war spoils, irretrievable. The magical weapon "Poison Dagger" worth 8,000 gold coins is already the value of four to five warhorses, and if it's lost, anyone will feel a sense of loss.

"Is there no challenge left?"

Zhou Xu turned his head to look at the crowd gathered around the fountain, like the scene after the star-studded night in the ancient city.

Thanks to the silver mines produced locally, most players have basic equipment that meets their needs, and they no longer rely on simple weapons like iron clubs, wooden sticks, and spears from the poor era.

As long as you master the "Military Weapon" skill characteristic, carrying a dual-hand sword worth 50 gold coins, the melee profession player is no longer rare.

Some wandering adventurers even carry a composite longbow worth 100 gold coins.

As for armor, unless a mage's spellcasting is affected by wearing armor, which may lead to a failed spell, or a druid who cannot wear metal armor by birth, others can choose from lightweight armor categories, such as the 1st-level armor with 5 gold coins, the 2nd-level armor with 10 gold coins, or the 3rd-level armor with 25 gold coins.

Even a 1st-level player can wear a 3rd-level armor with 25 gold coins.

For players with levels 2 and 3 or higher, they can wear 4th-level armor with 100 gold coins.

Perhaps players haven't thought about it in that direction, but as long as these fully equipped players are willing, for the unarmed civilians, such as farmers with wooden sticks and hoes, they have already formed a elite team.
Here is the translation of the text:

As the players who had once been formidable foes now formed an alliance, they managed to protect the many civilians who had no combat abilities.

"If there's no challenger, let's clear the way," Zhao Xu said.

As soon as he finished speaking, the players in front of him, including the half-orc, instinctively stepped aside to let him pass. Even the arrogant half-orc was forced to lower his head.

"Up!" Suddenly, the rogue who had just shouted about seeking revenge against Zhao Xu cried out, "He said we can surround him, and we're avenging ourselves."

The remaining players who had trained together at the thieves' guild suddenly reacted and pulled out their daggers to charge towards Zhao Xu.

The other two players pulled out their shortbows and drew the strings, aiming directly at Zhao Xu.

"We'll definitely get at least tens of thousands of gold coins' worth of equipment," one of the players exclaimed. "We'll be rich in an instant!"

Realizing that they couldn't exhaust the Summer's magic, the rogue leader also shouted, trying to stir up the situation.

"Not wrong, we've never had such a high drop rate even after defeating many BOSSes!"

At the same time, a half-orc warrior in the corner also let out a loud shout, holding up his massive axe to charge towards Zhao Xu.

Meanwhile, Zhang Qi, behind Zhao Xu, was caught off guard by the sudden shift in the situation.

The Summer, no longer the original first player, seemed to be radiating a treasure-like aura, with a glow of wealth emanating from him.

Zhao Xu quickly called out to his classmates, "Let's block them together."

As Zhao Xu stood at the center of the whirlwind, he lightly waved his hand to stop his classmates from taking action.
Here is the translation of the text:

After that, the legendary staff of the Necromancer in his hand was switched to the "Instant Mage Staff" through the "Storage Glove".

"High-Image Illusion Technique [Enduring]." 

Zhao Xu wielded his staff with a gentle motion, accompanied by a rapid incantation, and instantly released this four-ring technique, which was an evolved version of the two-ring image technique.

Instantly, eight mirror images of himself appeared around him, all performing the same actions as him. These images not only mimicked his movements but also occasionally intersected with him, making it impossible for anyone to determine who was the true original.

Moreover, this four-ring High-Image Illusion Technique could generate a new image every round, unlike the two-ring version.

This was still a "Intuitive Technique" that could be released before it was triggered, even if attacked by surprise.

In an instant, the players who had attempted to attack Zhao Xu were left stunned.

They found it impossible to aim at a single target with their weapons.

"What about nine of them?" the players who had been besieging him exclaimed.

"Ah, it's the two-ring image technique, don't worry, let's all work together, and these illusions will shatter with one hit." A player who knew this technique shouted.

The players who had been besieging him, trying to steal from him, all became clear.

Those who wanted to sneak away needed to hurry, as the crowd and even the patrol team would arrive soon, restoring order to the area.

When someone heard this, a patroller immediately relaxed his bowstring and shot an arrow at a random target.

"Bang!" The sound echoed through the air, and among the images, the one who had been hit by the arrow looked unscathed.

"It's him, he's the original!" A few quick-witted people exclaimed instantly.
Here is the translation of the text:

Just as another arrow shot out simultaneously, it also hit another "Midsummer" on the other side, which quickly dodged out of the way.

"What the devil?"

"Two bodies?"

As the others looked on in confusion, the player head of the wandering group also shouted loudly, "Don't be silly, the mirror image also has a defense level, but it's quite low, almost the same as a civilian."

"So let's not worry about who's real and who's fake, let's just attack together and get it over with. I think he can still cast a few more mirror images."

Zhao Xu smiled silently to himself.

The mirror image's defense is 10 levels of basic defense, plus adjustments to body type and agility.

Zhao Xu's agility has been stacked to 18 points, while ordinary mages only have 12 points of agility, which is not bad.

His "mirror image" naturally has a higher ability to withstand attacks.

Just as a fierce barbarian finally managed to chop off one of the mirror images, he suddenly found that another "mirror image" had regenerated.

The regenerated mirror image meant that they would always have a 1/9 chance of hitting the nine Midsummers.

"How can this be?"

"This is too weird? Still resetting?"

This scene made the adventurers who had just managed to chop off one of the mirror images feel frustrated.

"No way? Now it's my turn?"

At this time, the nine Midsummers in white robes spoke up, their mouths opening and closing in unison, looking mechanical but also conveying a hint of strangeness, further increasing the psychological pressure on the crowd.

"Ah, what a relief!" Zhang Qi exclaimed. "With a mage's skills, we have a way to escape death. We still have a chance to survive."

As Zhao Xu's reaction was met with a sudden shout from a player, "I have a plan! Just close your eyes and pretend he's invisible, and we'll attack as if we're blind!"

"Good!"
Here is the translation of the text:

When they heard this, the group of players who were attacking immediately burst into cheers, realizing that this was also a viable strategy.

They just treated Zhao Xu as an invisible being, and no matter how many images the opponent had, it would be meaningless.

"Really confident," Cradle Lu said, shaking her head. "This is equivalent to complete concealment for Zhong Xia. It's only 50% successful in attacks."

"One half is better than one ninth," said Ban Chang Fang Xi Yue, nodding. "Originally, the image technique could be broken, but after the image was generated, it was complemented by the continuation of the ring. However, as long as it's fast enough, the image can be broken by restoring the speed. It's just that these people are panicked."

"The image duration is a ring-level spell, according to Mr. Zhong Xia's spell level. In fact, if we wait a few more rounds, these images will disappear," Feng Ge added.

"Yeah, so it's fine to drag it out," Cradle Lu said, looking worried at the scene unfolding before him.

However, no one knew that Zhao Xu had used the "Spell Persistence" expertise, and even if these people spent a day here, these images would not disappear.

Zhao Xu, who was being completely ignored by the others, couldn't help but laugh out loud when he saw how they were treating him as an invisible being.

There are too many chicken players, and even without the "Flash Dust" two-ring variant spell, they are basically just waving their hands with flour, not quite right.

Zhao Xu didn't even need to cast a spell, and he let these people fall into a complete state of blindness.

However, can they really hit him so easily?

Zhao Xu continued to move his staff, stirring up the mysterious energy in the air, and the torrent of occult flowed forth.

"Flash Technique."
Here is the translation of the text:

In the next second, Zhao Xu's true body began to switch between the physical plane and the ethereal plane, constantly switching.

"Ah, it's flashing!" "How can we hit it?"

As the crowd's eyes snapped open, they watched in awe as Xiaoyue, on the other side, rapidly and disorderly flashed in and out of this real world. His mirror image disappeared and reappeared at the same time.

This meant that when they launched a physical attack on Zhao Xu, the opponent might have switched to the spiritual plane.

Therefore, in addition to the original 50% loss of attack due to the "eye punishment" of being blinded, they would also have to endure a 50% chance of failure brought about by flashing.

25%!

This was the cruel probability that Zhao Xu, the person in front of them, had.

At this point, the crowd had not yet reached the calculation of Zhao Xu's defense and damage reduction.

The crowd, who had been foolishly eager to attack, suddenly stopped in their tracks.

Zhao Xu, with a hint of a smile, said, "So, it's my turn now?"

"We surrender!" a player exclaimed hastily, as he only had one last revive stone left and didn't want his entire character to be deleted.

"You can't kill us in broad daylight, and the guards won't let you get away with it," the half-human poet said, his words lacking conviction.

"If you use 'Fireball' magic, you'll definitely harm innocent players or civilians," he warned.

For the past few rounds of time, Xiaoyue had been playing it cool, looking like he was just waiting for them to attack.

Given the power of the Fireball spell of the three-ring wizard, those three to four-level players felt they could withstand it, but one- and two-level players were starting to get anxious.

"Ah..."
Here is the translation:

Zhao Xu looked at the over 20 enemies he had just attacked and smiled, saying, "Mages don't just kill with fireballs alone."

He then mercilessly swung his super magical staff again.

"Extreme Magic: Group Suffocation."

【Adventurer XX, you have been hit by the four-ring spell "Group Suffocation", you are the "suffocation" target, you take 60 points of non-fatal damage (10D6), and you fall into a coma.]

In an instant.

All the players who had just attacked Zhao Xu instantly turned into corpses and fell to the ground.

This caused a loud scream of terror from the audience in the scene.
