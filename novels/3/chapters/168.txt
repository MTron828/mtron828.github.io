Chapter 169: Steel Will

After hearing Anzhi's words, Zhao Xu knew that the legendary organization's special abilities had finally opened up to him.

Compared to the skills and professions he learned at the beginning, these abilities were fundamentally equal for everyone, and it was impossible to acquire skills or upgrade without a connection. Even Zhao Xu could teach others advanced skills and abilities once he had mastered them.

However, abilities obtained at the start of the game, such as "Potential Points" and "Dual Elite," were unique and could not be replicated or passed on to others.

Just like each person, after the first level, each level-up would grant one fixed ability that could not be changed.

Unless the account had a special feature, the total number of skills was fixed and could only be increased through profession abilities.

According to Anzhi's words, it meant that in that "cave of the flesh-eating beast," they could obtain extra spiritual abilities and gain a designated skill.

The "Steel Will" skill ability allowed the owner to upgrade their willpower by 2 levels.

When Zhao Xu first used the "Protection from Evil" spell, he also gained a 2-level boost to his willpower.

This skill could be used in countering magic and some supernatural abilities.

When they encountered the yin soul that night, the Maple Leaf Squad had this skill and would not be easily defeated by the yin soul's "Seven-Colored Spray." At that time, Zhao Xu also relied on his wizard profession's innate willpower to successfully defend against the yin soul. If he had not, the group would have been defeated, and they would have had to queue up to revive in the city.

As his willpower immunity level increases with his profession level, a 20th-level mage has a 12-level willpower immunity bonus. When Zhao Xu was at level 1, he already had a 2-level willpower immunity due to his profession. Now that he has reached level 3, his willpower immunity has increased to 3 levels.

Adding his +1 bonus to perception, his willpower immunity has increased by another level.

So, Zhao Xu's current willpower immunity is 4 levels. For him, ordinary low-level challenges to his willpower are not a big deal.

The "Steel Will" skill, which can be further increased by 2 levels, is not worth learning for Zhao Xu, but it's a different story for those who are not as strong as him.

Moreover, this skill is also a prerequisite for the "Sorcerer's Curse" advancement, making it even more meaningful.

However, there's a condition," Anzhiya reminded Zhao Xu. "The two of you, 'Zhilin' and 'Eswi', who worked together with you to complete the task in the 'Witch's Secret Box', will be considered dead if you die during the clearing of the robbers. In that case, the three of you will no longer need to go to the 'Cave of the Flesh-Eating Beast'."

Zhao Xu thought for a moment before nodding to indicate that he had understood.

This meant that he, Zhilin, and Eswi had formed a binding contract.

Zhao Xu, who was in the dark, while his opponents were in the light, had the upper hand. However, this was the second time he and the two women had formed an alliance.

The challenge to obtain the "Steel Will" skill would likely require them to work together.

This made Zhao Xu think about their future relationships and positions within the group.

It was undeniable that Zhao Xu and the two women had a good initial impression of each other. Even Eswi's occasional caustic remarks were just a manifestation of her sharp wit.

It seems that there's something peculiar about this, the starting point of this matter, what exactly is the source of it?

"Teacher, who is benefiting from whose light?" Zhao Xu asked.

This experience of facing a challenge can enable all three of them to acquire the "Steel Will" specialized skill.

Even if they spread it out, even high-level mages would be blown away by it. This has already broken through the existing barriers.

So Zhao Xu doesn't think it's just a coincidence that they were arranged like this.

"This is probably because you're benefiting from their light. You're going to advance to 'Super Magical Sculptor' in the future, and your abilities will cover most of the abilities of 'Super Cursed Sorcerer', so you don't need to consider 'Super Cursed Sorcerer' before level 13.

"But the two of them are both potential candidates for this advancement, waiting to be tested. So this time, acquiring the 'Steel Will' specialized skill is a crucial task for them."

"If they fail, it doesn't mean they'll never have the opportunity to become 'Super Cursed Sorcerer', but it will at least affect their growth pace in the Floating City. So, if you want to help them, you'll have to make a good effort."

"As for why you were also included, it's probably because their evaluation scores in the task review were all higher than the other one, and currently, your strength level is the highest among all the players in the Floating City. So, naturally, you became the target candidate. Otherwise, you would be arranged to the 'Carrion Beast's Den' trial at level 15, after all, many high-level mages in the Floating City are queuing up for this opportunity."

Zhao Xu heard these words and almost felt like crying.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

As for Aswich, he had a sense of gratitude towards his opponent. After all, he had used a "spell" to save them both, rather than choosing to leave them to die.

He finally received his reward for that day's task.

However, later on, Zhao Xu also discovered that the "spell" was quite a trap.

This "spell" could indeed revive, but it could only be used within the "True Fantasy World". Once Zhao Xu left the 8th layer of the Knowledge Pavilion, the spell became useless.

If someone really coveted the opportunity to revive twice without knowing the truth and didn't save their teammates in secret, they would indeed spit out their blood in disgust.

"When can I get a card at level 15?" Zhao Xu asked Anita Noja.

"No mistake, you're now a mage with a clear thought process," Anita Noja praised.

Zhao Xu smiled to himself, not surprised that senior mages would also want to master this skill.

At level 15, he could learn the two 8-ring spells, "Abandon Chaos" and "Embrace Chaos".

Then he could use "Embrace Chaos" to exchange the ordinary skill "Steel Will" for a chaotic skill.

Next, he could use the "Abandon Chaos" spell to exchange the chaotic skill for the skill he wanted.

Combining the two, he could essentially exchange "Steel Will" for the skill he wanted.

Zhao Xu had essentially acquired an additional skill ability.

This was the legendary "Skill Washing".

Many mages may not be able to learn this spell, but they wouldn't mind seeking out a mage who could and pay a sufficient price to acquire the spell.

This also meant that after Zhao Xu obtained the "Steel Will" skill, he could also seek out Anita Noja to wash his skill.
Here is the translation of the text:

After this period of time, Zhao Xu had realized that even if he had obtained two flaws in exchange for his expertise, his expertise chain was still extremely urgent.

Because he had the "Super Magical Sculpting" ability, which allowed him to nearly cost-free cast various super magical spells.

Each additional super magical expertise meant that his own strength increased by one level.

Unlike others, he had to constantly take away and add.

The "Curse Guardian" and "Super Curse Master" level 10 ultimate profession ability was actually reducing the enhancement circle of magical spells.

For example, he could use a high 5-circle spell without needing a high 6-circle spell.

This was indeed a remarkable ability.

However, even with this ability, the reduction in circles was itself equivalent to the same-named "Legendary Expertise".

So, the "Super Magical Sculpting" ability was invaluable.

"Teacher, is there a similar place like the 'Floating City'?" Zhao Xu asked again.

"Ha ha, Xunxia, you're so confident that I'll help you with the 'Mental Twin Wash'?" An Ti Noya jeered.

"Teacher, there's a saying on Earth: 'Look to the distant mountains and not the near hills'." Zhao Xu laughed.

At this point, An Ti Noya stood up, her skirt slightly longer, only able to drag on the ground.

Finally, An Ti Noya put a stack of discarded documents into the dimensional box and looked at Zhao Xu, saying, "I hope you remember what was said today."

Next, An Ti Noya found a low-level mage for Zhao Xu, and they successfully performed a spell counterattack in a spell duel.

Then Zhao Xu took matters into his own hands and started drawing the spell array on the ground according to the "Ritual Requirements" recorded in the magical tome.
To ensure the success rate of the ceremony, Zhao Xù deliberately searched for some gemstone fragments in the discarded waste left by An Ti Niya, and re-grinded them into powder.

Especially for the "Emerald" and "Jade" gemstones, which had only minor imperfections, An Ti Niya carelessly discarded them.

Zhao Xù sighed as he processed the gemstones, lamenting the unpredictable fate of wizards.

The emerald, as a gemstone with magical properties, is often found in high-stakes spells such as resurrection. Therefore, a single emerald costs 5,000 gold coins.

Zhao Xù assessed the minor cracks on the emerald, concluding that they did not affect the potency of the spell, but to An Ti Niya, it was a frivolous waste.

Finally, Zhao Xù lit a specially designed incense at the center of the ceremony and sat down to meditate.

Slowly, as Zhao Xù's thoughts became vacant, the original pattern of the ritual array began to appear faintly.

Mysterious energy from the void began to flow in, slowly activating the entire ceremony.

An Ti Niya sat on a high-legged stool, silently watching Zhao Xù.

The ritual spell, requiring a long time and complex symbols and incantations, is usually only feasible for those with cultural background or scholars.

However, in history, many unfortunate individuals have suffered misfortunes as a result of conducting the ceremony, often summoning powerful demons from the depths of hell.

Similarly, attempting to perform a teleportation ritual, only to end up at the wrong destination.

Therefore, An Ti Niya had specifically hung a "Time Reversal Amulet" around her chest.

If Zhao Xù encountered any problems, she would immediately activate the amulet, causing the time in the room to retroactively revert to 6 seconds prior.

In this case, everything that had occurred within this time would be cancelled.
Annie Yu is somewhat nervous about Zhao Xu's behavior causing trouble at the ceremony.
