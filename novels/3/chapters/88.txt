Chapter 089: Incantation Cannon

As the summer solstice approached, Poet Qingwa asked Zhao Xu, "Have you heard of any strong traps that the spellcasters are familiar with?"

Zhao Xu, who was inspecting his surroundings with his half-bucket water detection skill, replied, "Traps? Half-traps and half-contraption?"

Poet Qingwa then asked, "Tell me more?"

Zhao Xu's words made everyone in the group realize that his knowledge level was not on the same level as theirs.

The majority of the gossip and rumors they had heard were from this kind of unintentional adventure, and then spread through word of mouth.

"Incantation Cannon?" Zhao Xu said.

"Incantation? Cannon?" Yu Yu was taken aback by the two unrelated things being connected.

"Incantation Cannon is usually used in places where no one wants to enter. It can identify specific targets. If someone not on the target list enters, it will activate the spellcasting mechanism," Zhao Xu recalled.

"It's just like the cursed trap we encountered earlier, isn't it?" Warrior Maple Leaf, who was cautiously holding his sword beside Luo Ya, spoke up after a moment.

Zhao Xu smiled, recalling the time he saw the Incantation Cannon in the floating city.
Here is the translation:

Just now, a cursed spell almost killed Maple Leaf. If four spells were cast without mercy, they would have already been able to collect Maple Leaf's body. "How far away?" The seasoned Luo Ya quickly grasped the core of the question.

If it's like the cursed trap just now, with a trigger distance of only one to two meters, it would still be manageable, and it's still possible to dodge.

"This is the terrifying aspect of the curse cannon. It has a detection trigger distance of nearly 40 meters. Moreover, it usually hides itself, only appearing when it recognizes an unknown target."

Zhou Xun explained.

"Can't the spellcaster use a hiding spell?" Rock, an expert on the side, remained silent for a while before speaking up.

Zhou Xun only noticed Rock after he had spoken, guessing that Rock was Luo Ya's academic mentor, and that the team had both a mage and a priest, which made it impossible for him to speak up earlier.

"The cannon has true knowledge effects," Zhou Xun said calmly.

The group fell silent immediately.

"What is true knowledge?" Rainbow, a wanderer, asked after a while.

Zhou Xun finally reacted, saying he had gone off-topic.

"True knowledge is a six-level spell that can see through all illusions, including hiding spells," Zhou Xun explained directly.

Heaven knows why a broken cannon could obtain true knowledge effects at a low cost.

When Zhou Xun explained, the group suddenly realized.

Illusions are unfamiliar to many, but the most typical "hiding spell" among illusions is still well-known.

Even in a small town where magic hasn't spread widely, many people have heard of the "hiding spell", a second-level spell mastered by mages.

After mastering this spell, mages gained a bit more insurance for their lives.

Therefore, how to deal with mages who use hiding spells has become common knowledge among various combat professions.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Hey, what a trap, but once you've got a magic spell up your sleeve, everything becomes incredibly tricky!" exclaimed the wanderer Shil, complaining.

The entire tunnel was narrow, but they had walked all the way down without any unusual occurrences, and suddenly their hearts felt a bit more at ease.

Zhao Xu, who had also wandered through the tunnel, nodded in agreement.

When he first ascended to the floating city, that black-robed mage reminded him not to run around carelessly, lest he trigger the city's countless curses.

At the time, he had just handed over his recommendation letter, and the city hadn't even had a chance to record his name yet.

The city's cannons were all connected to the mysterious locks, making them even more complex. Sometimes, even people on the list would enter at the wrong time and receive merciless bombardment.

Not to mention the magic shields and the treatment of the magic guards.

He didn't know about the other things, but at least the final boss's stronghold tower had hundreds of level 9 magic cannons surrounding it.

Anyone who dared to trespass would be pummeled with spells like absorbent magic, binding magic, dimensional vortex, and level 9 summoning magic.

"Wait a minute," said Rainbow, suddenly raising her hand to signal everyone to stop.

"Scared to death, thank goodness we didn't step on it," Rainbow said, her face slightly red and tense.

"It's definitely a bit off," said Shil, who was crouching down beside Rainbow, confirming her judgment.

Everyone stopped walking, and the warrior Feng, who had been silent all along, turned around and backed away from them.

The two wanderers knelt down to inspect the ground in front of them, while the others guarded them.

"There's nothing strange," said Yu, who was standing at the front of the group and looking ahead.

The entire tunnel's floor was flat and smooth, with no unusual occurrences whatsoever.

"Maybe it's a living trap," said Zhao Xu, who had also wandered through underground cities before.
Here is the translation of the text:

In the wilderness, traps usually have some sort of spikes or thorns at the bottom. Even adventurers will likely die if they fall into one. However, people are not stupid and won't knowingly walk into a trap. So, the wilderness usually covers the traps with leaves and grass, making them look like a single-layered trap.

In contrast, underground cities often use more complex traps, such as self-restoring pressure plates. If you step on one, the floor will suddenly open up, and you'll fall down. Rainbow, being a seasoned adventurer, knows that this kind of trap is not triggered by arrows or something, but rather by stepping on the pressure plate.

When they approach the suspicious pressure plate, Rainbow's eyes widen in surprise. The original floor suddenly opens up like stepping on an empty box, and the two 2-3 meter long pressure plates fall down. Everyone's heart skips a beat.

However, after losing their footing, the pressure plates quickly return to their original state due to the device's action, with only a faint creaking sound. Zhao Xu looks puzzled, wondering why the trap was made so long. It seems intentional, as if they want to prevent them from jumping over.

But since they've been discovered, they naturally find a way to get past it. Rainbow jokes, "This trap has been around for a long time, it's quite durable."

"It's hard to deal with, let's just climb the wall," says Ruo Ya, realizing that this trap is similar to the curse trap, something that two 1st-level adventurers can't disassemble.
Here is the translation of the text:

After making a plan, Hili, with his high climbing skills, began to install climbing iron hooks on the wall. Everyone stepped on the hooks one by one and climbed over. Those who were climbing were tied with ropes, and if anyone slipped, the others would desperately pull them back.

After spending over ten minutes, everyone finally crossed over, leaving the iron hooks on the wall.

"Let's move on," Luo Ya said, looking at everyone after they had adjusted their gear.

The explorers in front of us hadn't checked yet, and we didn't dare to take another step, staying at the entrance of the living door about a meter and a half away.

Everyone nodded in agreement, and if the underground city was as difficult as this, victory was within reach.

Rainbow, the explorer, continued to lead the way, searching and investigating as he went. After discovering the trap, his confidence increased greatly.

At this point, we were only a few meters away from the end of the corridor. However, just as we took a few more steps, he suddenly found that the originally smooth wall suddenly turned out to be a head with two horns, with a halo of light coming out of its mouth.

"That won't be... the Cursed Tower's Curse?"

Everyone noticed this at the same time and looked at Zhao Xu with a mixture of shock and concern.
