Chapter 428: Attack Bonus

Facing this problem, Zhao Xu had already fully understood the subsequent actions.

The occupation of a character, whether it's Arthur or not, will have corresponding progress, specialization, and resources to choose from to enhance their abilities.

For mages, the diversity of spells can lead to a significant boost.

The 8th-grade reflex defense bonus is, for ordinary players, an insurmountable peak, a daunting task, and has already reached 40% success rate.

Even 3-4 level players may not have this level of reflex defense ability.

However, for Zhao Xu, it was just that.

Not eight, but just eight.

"Progressive Enhancement of Resistance (Sixth Circle)!" Zhao Xu immediately recalled the content of the spell and, relying on the mysterious symbols on the last scroll, cast the spell on himself.

The "Progressive Enhancement of Resistance" spell, corresponding to what Zhao Xu had already mastered, is a "Resistance Enhancement" spell, a version of a bird's shot.

The "Resistance Enhancement" spell in the zero circle can only enhance the three major resistances by 1 level of resistance value and lasts for only one minute, which ordinary players consider trivial.

However, the "Higher Resistance Enhancement" in the four-circle can enhance the resistance by 3 levels.

The sixth-circle "Progressive Enhancement of Resistance" can even enhance the resistance by a full 6 levels, and its duration can last up to 24 hours, successfully entering the wake-up Buff of many mages.
After the spell takes effect, Zhao Xū did not stop there and continued to cast another spell that provides 2 levels of inherent bonus to defense and reflection. This spell instantly pushed Zhao Xū's reflection to level 15, making it almost impossible for him to fail a 15-level difficulty check in the Starlight Cloak system, unless he deliberately tries to act poorly. However, this spell has a unique drawback - it can only be sustained for a certain duration.

It is one of the few spells that can be re-cast again, making it exceptional among the "Swift Burst" series. During the spell's duration, Zhao Xū can cancel it at any time to gain an additional "free action" time. This is similar to the "Slow Time" effect, but with the added benefit of being able to cast a standard action.

As Zhao Xū continues to use the spell to enhance himself, the duration of the spell gradually comes to an end. At this point, time begins to flow at an extremely slow pace. This is because the High-Speed Burst spell granted by the Eight-Ring artifact allows Zhao Xū to gain an additional 1.6 seconds of time. After using the spell to stop time, he still has some time left over, enough to cast another quick spell or even move a short distance. This is one of the reasons why high-level mages and other professionals find it extremely challenging to contend with each other.
Here is the translation of the given text into English:

Just like a chess player who takes a step forward, suddenly notices that the black side has taken another step and can take another step, relying on various triggering mechanisms to become a solo performance. Any red side with a hint of arrogance will definitely lose the game and abandon the game. But at this time, Zhao Xu, who is rich in trump cards, did not try to take action against the opponent. He was also planning to observe the true strength of the legendary monster when he possessed the ultimate artifact.

Otherwise, with his possession of instantaneous spellcasting, he could still cast a five-ring spell without using his super magical control ability, relying on the nine-ring spellcasting position. Time returned to normal speed.

In an instant, the earth element leader felt himself become heavy and powerful, and his crushing fist was swung in vain. The originally expected enemy to die suddenly retreated about five or six meters and directly withdrew from its attack range.

At this time, Lark and Vivian, who controlled the golems, also followed up, each stretching out a thick arm to try to grab the earth element leader and prevent him from getting close to Zhao Xu.

However, the earth element leader was indeed caught, but suddenly three colored lights flashed out of his body, striking Zhao Xu's position. The light touched the ground and suddenly grew rapidly, eventually becoming another three large element leaders, each radiating their powers in this vast area.

This sudden and extraordinary attack was directly utilized by the element leaders with strong attributes and reaction abilities.

Zhao Xu didn't even blink his eyes before realizing that three heavy punches were synchronized. The first to attack was the wind element punch that could destroy everything! At this time, Zhao Xu even relied on the ability of "Divine Eye" to vaguely sense the trajectory and power of the wind element leader's punch.

However, this perceptive power was completely useless.
Here is the translation of the text:

He was like a target that had been forewarned to be shot by a gun, knowing that the trigger would be pulled, knowing that the bullet's trajectory was heading straight for him. But when facing the 60-level elemental attack's massive attack power, even if he was given a few seconds of buffer time, he remained as static as a wooden post.

"Boom!" The sound echoed through the air, and Zhao Xu was like being hit by a massive air cannon head-on, accompanied by a rumbling sound that made it seem like he was being blown away. He sprang up from the spot, hovering in mid-air.

At that moment, Zhao Xu felt the scent of death looming before him.

His accumulated reflex ability directly released all the energy in his body, causing him to leap backward suddenly.

As Zhao Xu's entire body was enveloped by the starry cloak, it seemed weak and fragile. However, it suddenly burst out with infinite light, like a meteor shower falling to the earth, weaving a network of silver lines in the space before him.

These silver lines immediately formed a massive shield to protect Zhao Xu.

The instant Zhao Xu had just opened up a small space around himself, a loud, turbulent noise like the tearing of empty space echoed through the air.

["Adventurer, you have activated the 'Starry Cloak' ability to reflect and dodge the attack, reducing damage by 100%."]

Zhao Xu had also felt the threat of magical weaponry just a few times before.

This was also one of the few times he had felt the "reflex evasion" challenge of 15 levels of difficulty from the cloak.

His response might be a slight evasion of the body's angle or a simple step backward.

Under the natural stability provided by his own 15-level reflex ability, he naturally passed the test.

At this moment, Zhao Xu also felt the same two intense sonic booms echoing in his mind.

Flaming Fist of Eight Directions.
Here is the translation of the text:

The torrential fist of justness and softness. The main fist of the two elements of fire and water also lags slightly behind the element of wind, and descends upon Zhao Xu, invading his body.

However, for Zhao Xu, this is just a repetition.

Although he cannot yet achieve the legendary state of being invincible, he remains unmoving, allowing the wind and rain to blow and beat against him. If he does not notice or give up evading, he will definitely be struck and consumed by the attack.

Therefore, this physical immunity is more a subjective physical immunity, rather than a true defense that is piled up to infinity.

However, this is enough.

Zhao Xu smiled lightly and continued to move forward, avoiding the residual impact of the star-studded cloak that had just been struck. This is a test of 15th-level reflexive immunity.

Unfortunately, Arthur is not a simple electronic game, where he can glance at the panel and not need to move at all.

Zhao Xu, relying on his 28 intelligence, can slowly think through the situation and come up with a plan in the face of urgent and critical circumstances.

Suddenly, he heard a low "boom" sound behind him, knowing that this attack could easily destroy his defense. He relied on the star-studded cloak to dodge the attack successfully.

Suddenly, Zhao Xu was startled, and suddenly, he was set on fire.

However, the fire suddenly went out.

At this time, Zhao Xu only noticed the latest message on the dynamic panel.

【Adventurer Zhong Xia, you have been hit by the fire element main fist and failed to dodge (difficulty level 67), and have been affected by the fire element's burning ability, and are now on fire.]
Here is the translation:

When he saw the enormous sentence, Zhao Xu's mind whirled around, calculating the pros and cons nearly a hundred times.

As if he had been ignited, he was in a state of high alert, just like a fire that had been set ablaze.

The fire element mainstay, once it attacks and hits, can cause the opponent to enter a state of being on fire. It's a matter of life and death for ordinary living beings, but for him, it's no big deal.

However, the fire that had just started to spread was extinguished by the water element mainstay's ability to douse it with water.

This unexpected event woke Zhao Xu up to the current situation.

When he faced various undead beings in the past, once they attacked and hit, they would unleash negative abilities.

If he failed to dodge or parry, he would enter a corresponding negative state.

At that time, he ignored these attacks because he didn't consider them as magical attacks, and therefore, he was also immune to the corresponding negative states.

However, when facing element mainstays like these, their attacks are considered magical attacks, and he can't ignore them.

This means that even if he can dodge 100% of the damage, he still needs to endure the additional negative states that come with it.

After the fire element mainstay attacked and hit Zhao Xu, it brought with it the "burning" ability.

Zhao Xu also had a backup plan to pass the 15th difficulty level and activate the 35th difficulty level's reflex dodge.

However, the attacks from the element mainstays are like a giant wave crashing down on him, making it impossible for him to dodge.

Fortunately, the attacks from the element mainstays do not come with any extremely negative effects, even the fire element mainstay that nearly burned him to death. Unlike the undead beings, which can weaken his physical attributes and absorb energy.
Zhao Xu suddenly realized that his defensive abilities were still far from being put aside. Even with over 100 levels of defensive skills, he could only barely claim to have a passive "physical immunity".
