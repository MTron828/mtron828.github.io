Chapter 230: Bodyguard

It's inevitable to say that under Arthur's thousand-year management.

When an adventurer declares his priest identity, he has already gained a great deal of recognition.

The camp is both a symbol and a proof of each individual's historical behavior and current state.

However, it has also become a reliable proof of good or evil.

Good and evil have become a clear "stigma" subtly covering each person's head.

As the bearer of the priestly badge of the magic goddess, Zhao Xu has proven that he is absolutely impossible to be an evil priest.

Since the camp of priests and gods is inclined, it is impossible to exceed two levels.

Therefore, the goddess's priests can only choose from the four camps of law-abiding good, neutral good, chaotic good, and absolute neutral.

After communicating with Fang Xi Yue, Zhao Xu expressed that he would basically follow the opponent's itinerary.

Everyone decided to return to gather their belongings and depart before sunset, then set up camp in the wilderness and discuss their strategy for the next day.

Except for a few players who had personal matters to attend to, the entire group consisted of tens to hundreds of people.

There were also tens of such forces, but they did not have a deep connection and did not coordinate with each other.

After deciding on their course of action, Zhao Xu had nothing much to do and simply waited at the city gate, which everyone had to pass through.

This time, Zhao Xu decided to follow Zhang Qi and his classmates, which was also a preparation for the year-end crossing. According to his current leveling progress, he would definitely have some self-defense ability by then.
Even now, he can be said to have a surplus of power and a lack of persistence, and he won't be conspicuous, but those rich means will gradually make him a threat. And ten months later, when he has advanced to around the 9th level after getting the job advancement, he will need to face the issue of how to coordinate with low-level players.

He will need to play the role of someone who doesn't intervene too much in the battle, but can save the situation at any time. This is not just asking Zhao Xu to fight, but he also needs to be able to rescue others. Luckily, he is a mage and a scholar of ancient texts, and he has various skills and methods to intervene in the battle, as well as the ability to revive the dead. Therefore, he needs to practice in advance.

As he thought about this, Zhao Xu suddenly felt a sense of melancholy. In his past life, he could only work hard to protect his own small piece of land. But in this life, at the moment when he has 20-level priest abilities, he is already thinking about how to lead his teammates. Slowly, as the sunset appeared in the sky, stretching the shadows of each person, Zhao Xu noticed that there were some unfamiliar faces in the team.

This time, it was Cui Lu who introduced herself to Zhao Xu, smiling and saying, "Hello, Priest. I have some things to attend to tomorrow, so I'll catch up with you tomorrow. Tonight, we'll go with these people." The class monitor, Fang Xi Yue, had some matters to attend to, and Zhao Xu was aware of this. However, his gaze fell on someone else.

"Oh, let me introduce you," Cui Lu said, pointing to a mage standing beside her. "This is Mu Tong, a mage who has just been resurrected from the 'Star-Falling Lake' front-line investigation team. This time, he wants to continue following us."
Zhao Xu also greeted the other party, and Mu Tong saw his goddess's priest also showing the corresponding etiquette.

In fact, Zhao Xu was quite strange. Mu Tong didn't follow the group from the Mage Academy, but instead followed their small team.

"As for this lady, she is Miss Flei. She is an experienced adventurer. She is also indignant about this slave trading incident, so she wants to go with us." Cui Lu pointed to a tall and hot-tempered woman and said.

Zhao Xu took a look at the slowly approaching female wanderer Flei. She was wearing an obviously well-crafted inlaid leather armor, barely covering the low-cut top inside. She had a well-crafted rapier at her waist and a compound longbow on her back.

Her adventurous outfit was more professional than Cui Lu's team, and that was probably why everyone was happy to have her join.

This was also the reason why Zhao Xu, as a priest, could easily integrate into the team without anyone asking him anything.

In Arthur, strength is always a more powerful weapon than looks.

The first-level spell "Charm Humans" is enough to influence the mind and make the other person friendly towards oneself.

The third-level spell "Suggestion" can make the other person follow his suggestions as long as he can come up with a somewhat reasonable request.

And the more extreme fifth-level spell "Dominate Humans" can force the other person to act according to simple commands.

It's a good thing that Arthur's male players don't have tools for committing crimes, and the mages generally have low levels. Otherwise, they would have to turn this game into a mess.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Oh, Mr. Wind, you all seem very serious today," the female adventurer, Floria, whispered with a low laugh, combining it with the wavy curls of her long hair and the curved eyelashes attached to her face, which was so alluring that it was hard to resist. This made Zhao Xun and his classmates from the same class all take a breath, each thinking to himself that this was just a game character, while Zhang Qi and others looked at each other with a glance. "Hello," Zhao Xun replied with a pause, not saying much more.

Next, Cui Lu introduced another middle-aged man with a low and pale face, who was also a resident of Arthus, and his son had also gone missing. This time, he wanted to follow them. Zhao Xun saw this person, and his eyes lit up slightly before he didn't say anything.

After this meeting, everyone originally planned to have Woodbine, the mage, as their leader, but he declined due to his unfamiliarity with the personnel, so Cui Lu ultimately became the leader and led them forward.

Then, everyone went out of the city through the city gates after verifying with the city guards.

It was as if Floria had found a kindred spirit, and she walked ahead, chatting with Cui Lu the whole time.

Although Floria and Cui Lu were from different planets, Floria was indeed dressed in a fiery outfit, with her long, white legs exposed, making her look like a lively girl from Earth, which caught the attention of Zhao Xun and his classmates.

Zhao Xun kept a certain distance from the team while his eyes were half-focused on Floria.

He knew this woman.

Floria was actually around the same age as them, having grown up with a female thief as her mentor and eventually making a name for herself through her intelligence and beauty.

But what's even more surprising is that Floria is the illegitimate daughter of Tang De, the leader of the Northern Alliance, and they only recently discovered each other's existence, with the news not yet spreading.
Here is the translation of the text:

However, Tang De is also just a descendant of the same bloodline, so he has no difference with his own daughter. If Zhao Xu hadn't traversed to the Floating Sky City, he would have relied on his rebirth experience to gather a group of future affluent people. However, Zhao Xu could recognize this young lady because the opponent had been digging a secret underground tomb in the town he managed after traversing, which contained a mysterious great tomb.

This caused a commotion in the town, and he didn't know how many times he had to wipe his butt for the opponent. Later, Floria found it too troublesome for him and recommended him to the forefront alliance's headquarters to serve as a "guardian" to accumulate capital and experience. It was reasonable for Floria to assign a personal bodyguard at her current identity.

However, Zhao Xu had obtained the "Surveillance" skill granted by the God of the Sky, so unless Tang De, a legendary strongman, came near, the bodyguard wouldn't be able to track him without being discovered.

Moreover, Zhao Xu had already possessed "True Knowledge" and "Detection Magic" skills, and some magical techniques could not hide from him.

Suddenly, Zhao Xu realized that something was off.

He had a bit of a past with Floria in his previous life, and they had almost forgotten about it.

Floria had always suspected that there was a mysterious tomb at the bottom of the Floating Sky Lake, and she had just read some secret documents to come to this place, which was normal.

However, her equipment did not match her identity.

Her fine sword and the armor with embedded leather were both exquisite products, costing 300 gold coins more than normal, and the enhancement effect was almost equivalent to a "+1" magical weapon and armor.
However, a leader of an alliance that controls dozens of large cities and countless small towns, his own power is no less than that of some lords and kings. His only descendant does not have many magical equipment, which is indeed a bit unacceptable. At this time, Zhao Xu continued to use his "True Knowledge" to scan Fulei's body again. The first-level illusion spell "Magic Light" can indeed cover up the "light" emitted by magical items. But this spell itself is an illusion, and will be seen through by Zhao Xu's "True Knowledge". So the thin sword and leather armor on the other side are really just very ordinary equipment worth only a few hundred gold coins. In his previous life, the young lady carried a magical weapon "Backstab Sword" that could enhance her assassination ability, and the basic version of that thing cost as much as twenty thousand gold coins, not to mention the one the young lady had. Suddenly, Fulei seemed to feel Zhao Xu's gaze was strange. She turned her head, smiled at Zhao Xu, whispered something to Cui Lu, then slowed down her pace and waited for Zhao Xu to walk up to her. At this time, a few curious classmates in Zhao Xu's class also looked over, but when they saw Zhao Xu's sharp gaze, they unconsciously turned their heads back. "Are you the bodyguard sent by my father?" Fulei asked Zhao Xu in a low voice. When Zhao Xu heard this, he hesitated slightly, and then instantly realized his appropriate identity. In his previous life, it was the other party who recommended him to go to the main city, which allowed him to just escape the black dragon attack, and then Zhao Xu also got caught up in the tide of the sealing magic campaign. It wasn't until later that he re-joined the dragon-slaying team, and then met his end in the acidic breath of the black dragon. With a nostalgic look, Zhao Xu said, "That's right, Miss, it was Chief Tangde who sent me."
Here is the translation of the text:

When the other person mentioned her father, Freya also put her mind at ease, as she had previously seen a note saying that an adventurer with a gigantic scythe would protect her.

"Although I knew Lady Ruoxue beforehand, how did you know for sure that I would join this team to cover for me?"
"Moreover, you're being too reckless, pretending to be a priest, I wouldn't dare do that when I used to lie to people."

Freya slightly leaned in closer to Zhao Xu and spoke in a low voice.

Zhao Xu's face lit up with a confident smile: "Miss, I'm a genuine priest. Come to my room tonight after we set up camp, I have something to discuss with you."
