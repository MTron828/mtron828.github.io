Chapter 681: Evil Summoning, Ideal Summoning Scene!

"Come with us, Little Deer Sister," Allow said to the pitiful-looking idol girl, looking at her with a compassionate expression.

After two days of excruciating torture, she had completely forgotten her former halo. For these celebrities who rely on their capital and fame, even in a strict film set, they are treated like precious children. Even if they have to perform a terrible play, they will still ensure the water quality is clean by pouring multiple buckets of water to dilute it. Even if they take a wrong turn, they will still ensure basic cleanliness and human rights.

She couldn't imagine that the world after crossing would have such a terrible environment, with only filth and stench everywhere. These demons would not even think of feeding food to people. Even if a rat appears, it would only be seen as a delicacy.

If Zhao Xiu and others were to arrive a day or two later, the remaining would only be the corpses of the dead. Or, it would be like a replay of the later part of "The Teenage Years".

"But what about them?" Allow asked, looking at the invitation from Little Deer.

Little Deer heard Allow's invitation, although her heart had already agreed, but looking at the group of companions who had started to protect her, they had all lost consciousness and fallen in the cell. She hesitated to leave, feeling a pang of guilt.

Allow also looked at Zhao Xiu with difficulty. It would be easy to take someone with the ability to act like Little Deer, but these prisoners who couldn't follow would only become a burden when encountering enemies. Not to mention the prisoners who had been imprisoned for so long, the number of which would hardly decrease.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

Zhao Xu glanced silently at the "Tong Guo No. 1," "Tong Guo No. 2," and "Tong Guo No. 3" in front of him.

Through his observation of the memory of hua yu being imprisoned, he had already understood why hua yu, who was not even a 1st-level bard, would leave the safe camp.

In essence, it was these group of "tong guo" who had caused hua yu to leave the camp.

Before the heavy rain came, these people had decided to show off their strength by leveling up with hua yu in the wild, but they ended up failing miserably.

Therefore, Zhao Xu didn't bother to look at these three male players who had passed out.

If they had not brought hua yu along when they fled in the chaotic situation, they might have been able to escape one or two.

But instead, they were all caught and lay on the ground like dead dogs.

As a straightforward man, Zhao Xu felt a strong sense of disdain towards these "tong guo".

"Let's go," Zhao Xu said.

"There were a few demon beasts that were caught alive, and those cavalry teams will follow the demon beasts to this lair."

Yiren asked softly, "Captain, won't they refuse to talk because of their faith?"

Zhao Xu smiled and replied, "The demon beasts that are truly loyal and unwavering in their faith are the ones that have already died. They won't be easily captured."

After hearing Zhao Xu's words, hua yu seemed to have found a reason to comfort herself and quietly followed Zhao Xu's footsteps. She also feared that if she talked too much, Zhao Xu would change his mind.

However, she had only taken two steps when she winced in pain, her body slightly leaning forward like a gentle breeze.
Here is the translation of the text:

After being brought into the cell, these prisoners were left with nothing but a tattered piece of clothing and a pair of rough-soled shoes. She was forced to walk barefoot on the rough terrain, causing her to cry out in pain. "Ah?" she exclaimed.

Allowing, who had been watching this scene unfold, quickly rushed over and said, "Kelu, I'll find you a pair of shoes." However, she soon hesitated, realizing that she had left her luggage at home.

Allowing looked at Zhao Xu with a pitiful expression, and Zhao Xu was unable to withstand her gaze. He quickly rummaged through his bag, but to his surprise, he didn't find a single pair of ordinary shoes. He could only find a few "magic items" that he had obtained during his adventures.

Zhao Xu, however, didn't hesitate and used his magic to create a rubber ball. As he manipulated the rubber, it slowly took the shape of a pair of women's high heels. After a few seconds, Zhao Xu finally pulled out a new pair of shoes from his bag and handed them to Kelu.

As a mage who was not skilled in crafting, Zhao Xu used the "Efficient Creation Technique" to create temporary items. With this technique, he could create items made of plant, mineral, or precious metal components, including gold. Although the duration of the item was reduced to 20 minutes, it was still possible to create a temporary gold bar.
Here is the translation of the text:

Because "Strong Creation Technique" is a creation technique in the "Spellcasting System", not an illusion or transformation technique.

The only weakness is the magical aura, and the True Knowledge technique can't detect it.

After that, Rain Deer put on the shoes and found they fit perfectly.

Originally, she would have had to bite her teeth and force them onto her feet, even if it meant getting blisters. But now, they fit perfectly.

If she didn't put them on, she would have been left with severe injuries.

Rain Deer had a very luxurious life before her family, and she had never experienced life as a member of a girl group. Therefore, she had an abundance of resources and didn't know what it meant to struggle.

After experiencing the plunder by the monster, she finally understood the hardships of Arthur's life and what it meant to reach a certain level.

Rain Deer hurriedly bowed deeply, expressing her gratitude to Zhao Xun, saying, "This pair of shoes you gave me is truly comfortable."

"It's comfortable, that's good," Zhao Xun heard and was delighted. Otherwise, she would have considered exchanging them for a new pair.

Zhao Xun took the shoes out of his backpack, so Rain Deer didn't find it strange that they fit perfectly.

All Zhao Xun could do was sigh at Rain Deer's good luck.

However, Zhao Xun's face turned red when he heard this, and he looked at his outstretched palm, as if he had just found the perfect "arc" on it.

At the same time, he caught a whiff of the stench Rain Deer had acquired from being confined for too long, and Zhao Xun's heart ached. He lightly tapped his fingers, and the magic trick was performed.

Instantly, all the filth on Rain Deer's body disappeared, as if she had just taken a bath and washed away the dust and dirt.
Here is the translation of the text:

She tied her hair into a ponytail and suddenly her hair turned black and wavy, with a few strands framing her forehead. The air around her was clear and crisp, and she looked like a princess. If she wore a bubble skirt, she would be the epitome of elegance.

"Aha, this is the image of my sister-in-law that I had in mind," Zheng Xin'an exclaimed, as if her mother had just appeared, and excitedly hugged Lao Yu. She then leaned in and kissed her on the cheek.

Zhao Xu was taken aback by this scene and slowly said, "Alright, Little Panda, stop acting like that, or she'll be suffocated by you."

"Hey, Commander, you're just jealous of me," Zheng Xin'an retorted, looking pleased with herself.

Zhao Xu couldn't help but feel a sense of nostalgia when he saw his former wife so happy. He couldn't help but mutter to himself, "I've never been able to hold her in my arms like this before."

As for Lao Yu, she was shocked and stunned by the changes happening to her body. She felt like she had been reborn, and no matter how much hot water was poured over her, it wouldn't be enough to wash away the stench of the prison.

Like countless people, even those living in clean and tidy homes would unknowingly wear slippers. This was the only chance she had to go barefoot, whether it was in her bedroom or on the beach.

But after crossing over, facing the harsh environment of the outside world, countless city residents could only silently go barefoot, stepping on the rough stones, just like an old farmer who had spent his entire life working in the fields. Otherwise, it was not uncommon for their feet to bleed after walking a few steps.

Lao Yu, despite being pampered by those around her, was experiencing the power of magic being displayed on her body for the first time, and couldn't help but gaze at Zhao Xu with a look of reverence and admiration.
Zhao Xu, who had seen this familiar gaze for the third time, initially resisted, but the second time he was alone and lost his composure. Now, for the third time, he saw it and his heart was still firm, but he was busy talking to his team members. "Alright, allow, hurry up and take the lead in front of the explosive package, do you really think we're safe?"

Allow nodded and put away his grappling hook, holding his long sword tightly in his hand, preparing to clear the way for Zhao Xu and Lü Yǔ.

As they walked, they saw many prisoners on both sides of the jail cells, most of whom were in a coma-like state, as if they had no energy left to even try to escape. In reality, Zhao Xu was also using his observation skill to scan the figures of these survivors.

Fortunately, the prisoners were not yet aware of their surroundings, so they were only semi-conscious, barely clinging to life. There were a few who had heard the noise and wanted to come over to ask for help, but Zhao Xu thought for a moment and then used his "sleeping technique" to let them rest again. This was more convenient than explaining the situation.

If it weren't for Lü Yǔ, who had a connection with him, he wouldn't even bother to bring them along, waiting instead for the main rescue team to arrive. He didn't think he could save them all.

As a person who was used to helping others, Zhao Xu was very clear about this, just like saving someone who was drowning. If he didn't have experience or methods, he would likely be dragged down by the other party to the bottom.

"It smells like the scent of blood in the air, getting thicker and thicker,"

As a sensitive priest, Allow also detected the killing intent that permeated the air.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Are those leftover old and weak demons eating humans gone crazy?" Allow asked Zhao Xuv with a innocent heart.

Most of the demons they saw on the battlefield were strong and powerful, and it was natural for them to hide in this nest as a breeding ground for the next generation.

"It's not necessarily a demon, it's possible that it's one of the captives who were taken away and killed, forming a blood pool like that," Zhao Xuv said.

"A blood pool?" Allow and Laku Yü looked at each other with a bad omen.

"Yeah, you know how in that game 'Dark Souls' they stack up countless skeletons as an altar for evil creatures to worship their primitive gods?" Zhao Xuv said with a sinister tone, looking at the shadowy area with a raised eyebrow.

The two of them suddenly turned pale, clearly not expecting the sudden change in atmosphere from "The Legend of Zelda" to "Escape II" with such a heavy theme.

Suddenly, a black figure emerged from the shadows, holding a massive axe with a gleaming red blade, charging towards them.

It was a young demon, still holding onto the massive axe despite its clumsiness.

Although it was awkwardly holding the axe, the blade was already heading straight for Allow.

She seemed to have forgotten even the basic defensive techniques, just staring blankly, waiting for the death knell to ring.

This is too pathetic!

Zhao Xuv thought to himself.

How could someone who was previously pregnant for three years suddenly become forgetful for three years?

Allow and Laku Yü couldn't react, and as the leader of the team, Zhao Xuv was responsible for the team's safety.
Here is the translation of the text:

At this moment of hesitation, Zhao Xu still couldn't bear to let Allow to suffer the slaying of this "punishment".

Therefore, in the instant just before Zhao Xu's spell was about to hit Allow's forehead, Zhao Xu's hands also completed the incantation of the spell— "Control Art!"

A three-ring poem's mystical control art, without any ambiguity or hidden meaning.

It's no wonder that the evil poet could use his high-level skills to manipulate people's hearts, confuse the audience, and collect offerings, pretending to be a "sorcerer".

Look at the "modification memories", "Control Art", and other unique arts possessed by the poet, which are full of deep meanings and sinister intentions.

As the effect of the spell, this young demon boy, still in his childish state, stiffened his body, and the giant axe that was about to split him open was stuck, unable to move.

Zhao Xu's "Control Art" could control the opponent's movements like a puppet, and it was unparalleled.

At this moment, he remained motionless, and naturally, the young demon boy could only remain motionless as well.

Allow took a gasping breath, and a feeling of relief washed over her, as if she had just experienced the sensation of pressure changes like those felt during a plane's takeoff and landing.

"Allow, kill it," Zhao Xu said.

"I... "
Allow had just killed those demon boys outside without any psychological pressure.

But looking at the demon boy's fierce, savage eyes, she hesitated.

On the battlefield, slaughtering women and children was a crime against humanity.

But the opponent was a monster, or a giant, wasn't it?

At this moment, Allow gazed at the demon boy's unyielding eyes, and suddenly clenched her teeth, tightening her grip on the long sword in her hand.
Here is the translation of the text:

Standing behind the deer rain, she suddenly stood up, her eyes fixed firmly and said, "I'm here!"

As she spoke, she quickly grabbed the "Heavenly Realm" from Allow's hand and charged towards the demon boy with the long sword.

"Zhi..."
However, she saw that the long sword had awkwardly stopped at the demon boy's leather armor, not piercing through.

The deer rain's power was not enough.

This scene was like an actor pouring all their emotions into the highest climax, but just as the peak was about to arrive, a fart sound came from the sound effects.

Zhao Xu, who saw this embarrassing scene, almost burst out laughing.

But the next second, he suddenly heard a low and eerie whisper in his ear!

Zhao Xu's face changed in an instant, and he grasped the demon boy puppet in front of him and used his own strength to break it apart with a giant axe!

The instant blood splattered all over Allow and the deer rain, causing them to be stunned.

And Zhao Xu's focus shifted to the front where the evil whisper came from!

He realized that it was the incantation to summon companions by the demon!

Even he started to see black shadows emerging from under his feet!

"Summoning scene!"

Zhao Xu's incantation was about to be spoken at this moment.

Sorry, I can only trouble you to summon my teammates, Zhao Xu thought to himself.
