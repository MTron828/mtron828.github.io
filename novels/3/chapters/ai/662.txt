Chapter 663: The Combination of Elastic Ball and Anti-Magic Field!

As soon as Zhao Xu became a player, he had already perfectly immunized himself against old age, diseases, separation, and toxic substances.

As a result, within the six-ring system, he was extremely resistant to damage, and his separation technique was extremely powerful, with a damage curve that was tyrannical, ranging from 40 to 240 (40D6) points.

However, Zhao Xu was cautious and still opened his "Protective Wings" on his first move.

Unexpectedly, the opponent was using a genuine and unpretentious separation technique that perfectly countered Zhao Xu's defensive magic.

Zhao Xu was anxious and could only comfort himself by thinking that his secret of immunization separation had not been leaked, and that the opponent would be unable to use it again.

But, in the blink of an eye...

Even if Zhao Xu was bold and cautious, he had never expected that this deformed man could do such a "burning jade" of a powerful spell.

Live and unbroken, he shattered a staff priced over 20,000 gold coins in value?

The user could intentionally break the staff, causing the remaining power to explode and convert into a complete explosion, releasing it into the surrounding space.

At this moment, Zhao Xu and the opponent were only a few meters apart, facing each other and bearing the most severe damage.

A single energy point of 8 points, and if there were more than 40 remaining shots inside the staff, it would at least be 320 points of damage.

Already exceeding the general magic damage curve!

This technique had a 50% chance of teleporting the target man, and a 50% chance of destroying the man's body and causing death.

At this moment, Zhao Xu glanced at his character panel's life value.
Here is the translation of the text:

He, except for 1st level because he is a monk, has a D6 life die. Then, at 10th level because of the military sword, he has a D12 life die. The intermediate levels 2-9 are the weakest D4 life die. Therefore, his life value brought by profession is 1D6 + 8D4 + 1D12 = 30 HP.

As for his constitution, it is 27 points, which brings an additional 80 HP.

In theory, if Zhao Xu is an ordinary 10-constitution mage, his life value would be no more than 30 points, and he would have to rely on his luck to survive a 10th-level mage's fireball spell.

However, with his constitution of 27 points, he directly increases his life value to 110 HP.

Even a 20-constitution 10th-level warrior would only have 115 HP.

But on Zhao Xu's life panel, it's not just that.

Because he has spells!

Zhao Xu's spell level is currently 33, but in the morning, when he buffs, he doesn't just stop at that. At that time, he also has additional skills, reaching a level of 39.

The divine power is 39 HP (1 HP per level).

The extreme false life is 20 HP (1D10 + 10).

The extreme relic treasure hunter is 42 HP (4D8 + charisma adjustment).

The extreme domain of decline is 120 HP (15D8 per life).

So, Zhao Xu's final life value is 331 HP, plus or minus 9 to 1 HP, which allows him to rely on the blessing of the martyr to avoid fainting, totaling 341 HP.

He is exactly at the edge of the 43-attribute energy wand that can kill him.

Facing this scene, Zhao Xu also realizes that the opponent, a chemist, is equally anxious.
Here is the translation of the text:

Because all explosive magic, such as fireball, can be dodged properly during the explosion process, it is possible to halve the damage. The difficulty of dodging is around 17 levels, which is unbearable for ordinary mages, but a breeze for Zhao Xu. Meanwhile, the opposing mage has made up his mind to use the "Pyroclastic Flow" technique, which deals over 300 points of damage, even if Zhao Xu dodges successfully. However, Zhao Xu will still be in a precarious state. Although the opposing mage is smiling and taking the cumulative damage of over 1,000 "Justice's Hammer", he is still anxious. Suddenly, he unleashes a deadly attack on Zhao Xu.

Zhao Xu reflexively dodges the attack, which is a feat that only top-notch reflexes can accomplish. He takes a small step back, while leaning his body to the side, perfectly avoiding the explosion's giant wave of destruction. After stabilizing his stance, Zhao Xu finds himself unscathed, except for some smoke and dust from the explosion. However, the distorted man who triggered the explosion is now covered in blood, his entire body turned red, with no intact skin visible.

According to the records of the thousand ways of death in the mages' books, there was once a mage who chose the fireball spell's explosion point poorly and ended up covering himself in the explosion, resulting in his death. The strange rock formations surrounding the Giant Boulder Cave were also blown to pieces in this explosion, with thick smoke lingering in the air for a long time.

"Even I wouldn't give up on such a powerful technique," Zhao Xu said, looking at the opposing mage who had lost his human form.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu decided to amplify the ability of "Starlight Cloak" to avoid 50% of magical weapon damage, and bestowed upon himself the fortune of the relic-seeker, gaining the ability to reflect magic damage. With this, he could avoid any damage type that could be negated by 50% as long as he succeeded in dodging. Therefore, the opponent's plan to strike with a one-hit kill technique failed. At this moment, Zhao Xu's figure quietly stepped forward. "Although I'm not clear about the specific method you used, I'm guessing it's probably one of a few ways." "Either it's that your life value falls below 0HP, but you still won't fall into a dying state and can maintain consciousness, the cost being that your movement is restricted, and you can only use one standard action per round." "Or it's that you have enough triggering methods, and once you receive fatal damage, you can completely recover your life." In reality, Zhao Xu could see very clearly that the opponent had indeed been affected by his damage, and these physical wounds could be clearly seen. Similarly, Zhao Xu could now cast the "Life Guard" spell, which was a minute-level spell that could not be sustained but had extremely powerful effects. The spell's energy could lock the target's life value at 1HP and sustain it for a certain period of time. Then the spell's energy would dissipate. Another spell was "Heaven Won't Neglect Man", which was a 10-minute-level spell. After casting the spell, his fingers would emit a golden ring to protect the target. When the target died, the spell would take effect at the moment their life value fell below -10.
Here is the translation:

The spell will trigger immediately, and a six-ring "healing spell" will descend, treating the injured party. However, if the death effect is not something that can be blocked by the healing spell, then this spell will be of no use.

Just a moment ago, the opponent had taken three consecutive blows that could be lethal, and even Zhao Xu knew that the opponent was about to use these moves. Zhao Xu had already tried to steal them and use them for himself.

"You're very clever," the distorted man said, coughing up blood as he looked at Zhao Xu.

His words were slurred due to his severe internal injuries.

"However, knowing too much can only lead to unbearable suffering," the man laughed loudly.

"Many strong beings have entered this place, but they have all ultimately met their doom at my hands. You insignificant insects will never be able to imagine the power of the master I serve."

The opposite alchemist's eyes widened, the only non-blood-stained part of his body. His eyes shone with pride and admiration.

"That being, is that a reward from your patron that's left you in this state?" Zhao Xu said coldly.

"You're talking nonsense!"

The distorted man's expression turned crazed, "This is just the great immortal testing me. If it weren't for its blessings, I would not have become a alchemist."

"It's also the will of the great immortal that we should know and then die. This is also the will of the great immortal towards us."

The alchemist said, his hands starting to emit a strange, crimson fire. "It seems that conventional spellcasting methods are also unable to kill you."

"So I can only use the methods bestowed by my lord to kill you, absorb your blood and brain, and make your suffering unbearable. Who told you to be stubborn?"
As the other person's eyes gleamed with an unparalleled sense of cruelty and arrogance, they spoke with a haughty tone, saying: "Accept your death quietly. Within this space, you are unable to kill me. This space has forbidden the use of teleportation magic, and you are also unable to drive me away."

"This has created a cycle of death, and I am nearly invincible here."

"I hope your death can hasten the footsteps of our master's revival. This will be an eternal honor for you."

Zhao Xu couldn't help but smile, saying: "Look at how full of yourself you are."

As he said this, he gently drew out the long sword in his hand, which was also known as the "+5 Unyielding Flowing Shadow Sword".

"We have a saying in our world: villains die from talking too much."

"You just made a declaration of unparalleled arrogance, revealing two pieces of information. One is that the master you serve has not awakened yet, so it's impossible for him to observe you in real-time and grant divine favor."

"The other point is that your method of not dying is based on this place."

"Adding my just-mentioned thievery, I've filtered all the buffs on your body and found no such instant revival or invincibility spells."

Zhao Xu's gaze gradually became sharper and more piercing.

"In other words, your method is likely similar to my 'Shield of Protection', only able to take effect momentarily to block your death, and still relies on the power of this space."

"Since that's the case."

As he said this, Zhao Xu swung his hand, as if he was about to chop at the other person, but instead he only parted the air in front of him.

In an instant, a faintly glowing ball-shaped force field enveloped the two of them.

The Elastic Force Ball! It is the strongest tool for binding an enemy or protecting oneself.
Here is the translation of the text:

Compared to the force field wall, its sealed nature is even more solid, able to block anything from penetrating this magical barrier.

Zhao Xu's original spell range could spread to 10 meters, but now he intentionally controls it to only extend 3 meters.

Just now, Zhao Xu's slash was a fusion of his spell stance into a casual sword draw.

It won't actually increase the damage, but it's enough to be stylish.

"Aren't you disappointed after a long-winded speech and expecting some new and exciting thing?"

The deformed man shook his head in disappointment.

"Do you think this force sphere can block my power in this area? You're being too naive, stranger."

"No," Zhao Xu simply shook his head.

"The true effect of this spell is to momentarily block you. As long as it's just for a moment, it's enough."

At this moment, Zhao Xu's eyes were incredibly serene, as if he had already found the fatal Lankin's arrow.

His attention had already fallen on the reward spell list of the talent ability.

Reward spell, sixth circle - "Anti-Magic Force Field".

"Anti-Magic Field!"

In an instant, Zhao Xu's second sword strike.

This type of spell ability doesn't require language, posture, or material components, nor does it require concentration or life energy expenditure, so he can still cast this type of spell ability even if he's bound with five ropes.

So he doesn't need to scatter iron powder as a spell material.

The effect of this type of spell ability is the same as the spell, consistent and reliable.

Instantly, a 3-meter radius, slightly smaller than the force sphere just now, invisible barrier surrounded Zhao Xu, moving with him.

This short 3-meter range, immediately covers the opponent.

However, within a 30-meter diameter circular area, wind and rain can enter, and even a small child with no strength can enter.
Here is the translation:

Only the effects of magic, pseudo-magic, and supernatural abilities cannot enter here!
Including all previously used magic items and spells, they are all unable to continue, and are completely suppressed.

This abnormal man immediately sensed the unusual situation in this space.
His face turned deathly pale, and any mage would lose confidence, feeling utterly helpless in the face of the anti-magic zone.

He hastily turned around and fled, and as long as he maintained a distance of three meters from the other party, he could escape to another dimension.

However, he only realized that, outside the three-meter critical distance, a "force sphere" was enveloping him, forming a perfect nesting pattern.

If he could cast a spell, he could break through this barrier, but his magical ability was currently sealed by the anti-magic zone, making it impossible to cast a spell.

The alchemist grew angry and turned around, saying, "You're just tying yourself up in knots. I can't cast a spell, and neither can you. We're just starting from the same starting line."

"Moreover, if you take a single step forward, the anti-magic zone will cover the force sphere, and I can easily walk out. Unfortunately, you're not holding a long gun."
"I apologize, but my second sword just now was a restorative action."
At this moment, his martial arts skills had fully recovered.

"Steel heart's power!"
In an instant, the flow of magic was fully restored on Zhao Xu's body.

"Besides, who says a long sword can't become a three-meter-long gun?" Zhao Xu lightly waved his sword, and in an instant, it transformed into a cold, frost-covered long gun, straight at the opposing man.

It was impossible to block.

"I hope your immortal ability is a special ability."
Zhao Xu judged.
