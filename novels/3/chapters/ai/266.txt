Chapter 267: Mysterious Illusion

For the second time, Zhao Xu entered the projection space of the "Final Scroll" through the "Spatial Gate", where he experienced time-space displacement in a mysterious room.

Through the mysterious room's trials, he finally entered the "Final Scroll's" vast projection space. This was also the reason why he had not met anyone inside.

As he was in a space created by the scroll, he was the only one present.

"Teacher, shall we not take the 'Spatial Gate' this time?" Zhao Xu asked behind An Ti Noya, who was holding a book titled "Divine Half-Face".

"Yeah, because that space hasn't appeared for two days," An Ti Noya replied, still holding the book but not putting it down.

Zhao Xu felt a sense of heaviness in his heart.

It's possible that the other party took a long time to look at the book, and yet couldn't solve the problem.

At this point, An Ti Noya led Zhao Xu into the private laboratory area of the seventh floor, "The Gate of Truth", where the environment was quiet and serene.

Zhao Xu also recognized many devices, such as the "Stabilization Device for Energy Channel" and the "Buffering Reverse Locking Well", which were specifically designed for research on positive and negative energy planes and magic devices.

Finally, An Ti Noya took Zhao Xu to a unique "Alchemical Ascension Elevator" and they descended more than ten layers in a vertical distance.

"Is this still the seventh floor?" Zhao Xu judged, despite feeling familiar with the sense of weightlessness as he rode the elevator.
Here is the translation of the text:

"It's not a mistake, my 'Truth Gate' laboratory only occupies one floor of space. However, the magic experiment is very likely to cause a massive explosion, even destroying the entire floating city. Therefore, many times, buildings need to be equipped with large amounts of energy-absorbing buffers to absorb the shock. Otherwise, the entire floating city won't be enough for me to accommodate."

"Ah, this is the most expensive one," Anzhiya complained.

As a sense of buffering deceleration came, the elevator door opened quickly, and Zhao Xu followed Anzhiya out.

He subtly judged that the product of "Alchemy Elevator" here was more advanced than other buildings in the floating city.

At this time, Zhao Xu observed the details along the way and continuously reconstructed the three-dimensional graph of this space in his mind.

The time it took to descend and his step speed and total steps all became Zhao Xu's own standard.

"Don't look, I'll replace this space every three months," Anzhiya suddenly understood Zhao Xu's consistent step speed and explained to him. "The saying goes, even the strongest thief cannot outdo the diligent wizard."

Zhao Xu was still thinking about the meaning of these words when he found that Anzhiya had already led him to a large door.

The metal-studded iron door stood directly in front of the two, almost making Zhao Xu feel like he had returned to modern society.

"This is what I wanted to make into a golem, but it's difficult to inject shape, so I used it as a door here. It's a magnificent door, worth 10 million gold coins," Anzhiya smiled with joy.

Zhao Xu secretly convinced himself not to embarrass Anzhiya and nodded slightly.

At this time, he noticed that the two sides of the giant stone doors had a half-spherical platform with a palm-print location on it.

"Is this intentionally set up?" Zhao Xu noticed this point.

It turned out that the door was set up to only open when two people came.
Here is the translation of the text:

Although the mage's transformation spell also has a way to solve this point, the painting style is a bit too strange. "Yes, go to the left edge and stretch out your hand," Anniya said after, and then she walked to the opposite right edge.

At this moment, Zhao Xu was looking at the palm print above, and directly put it into his left hand, with the residual mark of "Lakshmi" transformed on the back of his hand.

Unknown to anyone, from the moment she entered the laboratory, the whole person had been in a state of silence, without actively seeking to talk to Zhao Xu.

After Zhao Xu put down the palm print, he suddenly felt a mysterious attraction from the stone plate.

However, he did not resist and directly opened his heart.

In an instant, Zhao Xu's second ring magic position directly disappeared.

Immediately after, another second ring magic position disappeared.

It was as if a string of beads was being pulled apart, and in an instant, Zhao Xu's mental magic was sucked dry.

In just one moment, he had lost all his magic positions and the sense of security that came with them.

However, Zhao Xu did not panic, and he looked at Anniya with a curious expression: "Can't you use magic when you have magic positions?"

"That's right," Anniya explained, and for the first time, her tone showed a hint of softness.

At this moment, when the magic positions of both people were completely exhausted.

【Adventure, you are currently under the effect of the "Anti-Demon" field.】
Zhao Xu was suddenly startled, and then turned to look at the other person. However, the dark under Anniya's cloak hat was still present. He couldn't see her face.

It turned out that it was a "darkness" created by the artifact.

At the beginning, he could use the knowledge of breaking through the darkness, but now the entire environment was trapped in the "Anti-Demon" field, and the dark under Anniya's cloak hat was still shrouded.
Here is the translation:

There has never been a time when he failed to see through her.

It's just that, after everyone has exhausted all their spell slots and fallen into the "Anti-Magic Zone".

At this moment, Anzhiya is the weakest she has ever been since becoming a legendary mage.

She has no spells left.

As a result, she is unable to use magic to bypass the limitations of the "Anti-Magic Zone", and all magical equipment, including the "necklace" she is wearing, which can temporarily halt her physical state, has lost its effectiveness.

The gap between Zhao Xu and Anzhiya is also the smallest it has ever been since he recognized her.

She can only rely on divine artifacts.

Zhao Xu also has divine artifacts.

Just as the silence had lasted for a while, Larksa suddenly jumped out, shouting, "Master, let's go and crush her and achieve a great feat!"

Zhao Xu frowned, listening to the advice in his mind, which was already leaning towards "evil", and thought to himself, "Don't mess around."

"No, Master, you've at least gained half the power of the Floating City, and there are more than three magic tomes on the shelf that can increase your level by one, and you can even dream of being a legend tomorrow," Larksa began to outline a new plan for Zhao Xu's future.

"I've seen a row of divine artifacts in Anzhiya's treasure room," Zhao Xu couldn't help but ask Larksa, "Can you do it alone?"

Not surprisingly, Larksa immediately ceased speaking.

"Yes, go in."

Anzhiya did not notice the strange behavior of Zhao Xu.
Here is the translation:

At this moment, the high-hardness steel door that was originally tightly sealed and closely fitted began to rotate under the mechanical gear's action, slowly opening the gap and revealing the two mysterious giant golems inside.

Zhao Xun did not rush to enter the space with five sides made entirely of steel.

He noticed that each side was carved with fixed ritual magic arrays, similar to the magical arrays on the ground that he had sat on before.

Transmission? Invocation? Covenant?

Zhao Xun instantly read out several thought patterns from these inscribed ritual symbols.

He also hastened to record all the mysterious symbols carved out in his mind.

"Let's go sit inside those golems," Anzheniya said.

The two mysterious golems stood 6 meters tall, made of extremely high-hardness mysterious steel materials that were not used in ordinary iron, clay, stone, or flesh golems.

The golems slowly opened their chest compartments, revealing an interior space capable of accommodating a person's seat.

How tall?

Zhao Xun couldn't help but think this.

Golems were constructed using magical power and were automatic devices. The process of creating golems typically involved the use of powerful magic and elemental forces.

Creating golems was essentially injecting the unwilling soul of the earth element into the "golem".

However, Zhao Xun was looking at this mysterious "High-G" golem, but the other party showed no soul-related fluctuations, completely lifeless.

"What, we're going to sit in and start the ritual to summon us to the 'Final Scroll' space?" Zhao Xun asked.

"That's right," Anzheniya replied lightly.

At this time, the "High-G" golem knelt down and also extended both hands, allowing Anzheniya to climb up.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu's previous mimic made the same movements.
Zhao Xu looked at Anniya and didn't need him to support or cushion him, and he calmly arranged himself in the cabin.
He also followed the mysterious mimic's movements and entered the cabin.
"Teacher, when can we go out through the main door?" Zhao Xu asked, forcing himself to ask after crawling inside.
"Just wait until you become a legendary mage," Anniya's voice fell, and the cabin door closed immediately.
The interior of this mysterious mimic had automatic lighting, and a mirror-like surface in front of it, directly reflecting the external situation.
There was really something similar to it?
Or is it a future war equipment of the floating city?

Suddenly, Zhao Xu felt the ground shaking all around.
"Lord, we can recreate the summoning ritual we just saw, and in the future, we can reach the 'scroll' space on our own," Lark said.

"What do you know about the typical ability of this mimic, Lark?" Zhao Xu couldn't help but correct him.

"Magemind."

"That's why we're getting into this mysterious mimic, because there will be a huge astral flood coming from the outside, and we need the magemind ability to resist it."

Zhao Xu didn't have the patience to explain it to Lark.

As soon as he entered, he immediately realized the function of this mimic.
If he, himself, tried to recreate the ritual array, he would only be blown up by astral energy.

"Only, why did you set up this back door?" Lark suddenly asked the question that Zhao Xu had been thinking about.

"Sequential problem?" Zhao Xu suddenly guessed, as if inspired by his heart.
