Chapter 285: To This Point

Zhao Xu, who was freely falling from the cliff, used the "Feather Drop" technique and controlled his descent speed, transforming the accelerating fall into a steady descent.

Until he was almost about to crash into the endless tide of undead creatures below, Zhao Xu had his eyes fixed on the distance.

In the sky above the "Sleeping Land", a beam of light rose into the air.

It seemed as if Zhao Xu had always known that there would be flying undead creatures appearing there.

"These are legendary undead creatures," Lark said, echoing.

Zhao Xu also nodded slightly, but in reality, he didn't know what kind of undead creatures they were and had no idea what was going on.

This was because he had just used the "Sense of Death" superpower for the first time, and opened his "right eye", seeing himself standing on the cliff, surrounded by dozens of legendary undead creatures.

Without any magical items or just three-ring spells, Zhao Xu was directly killed by the undead creatures that had surrounded him.

Not even giving him a chance to explain.

These legendary undead creatures were so intelligent, with wisdom in the tens or twenties, and even surpassing the level of the wizard in human society.

They were not the kind of low-level undead creatures that only knew how to mindlessly slaughter living creatures.

So at that moment, Zhao Xu quickly exhausted his willpower, using the "Sense of Death" to simulate seven or eight different "future selves".

However, in the simulated scenario, no matter how he tried to explain, pull out evidence, or cast spells, he was always directly killed without a word.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu didn't even give him the time to practice, and directly read the file again. Until Zhao Xu's strength was almost exhausted, his right eye closed again, and he finally saw his only chance to survive. That was to escape! Therefore, Zhao Xu made a decisive move, directly fleeing before the legendary immortal objects took to the air. At this time, Zhao Xu was almost falling onto the wave of undead creatures below, and he hastily pulled out a "feather" from his pocket, a tool for his spell, and cast his second spell, "Flight".

Instantly, wings sprouted from Zhao Xu's back, giving him the ability to fly instantly.

It wasn't Zhao Xu's first time flying; he had previously shape-shifted and used the "Sync" spell to fly. This time, it was the first time he had mastered the power of flight using his own abilities.

Zhao Xu's body load was not heavy, and his normal flying speed was around 3 meters per second. If he accelerated to his maximum speed, he could reach 12 meters per second, equivalent to a speed of over 40 kilometers per hour, faster than a city bus.

However, if he wanted to fly even faster, he would need to continue to enhance his speed spell.

At this point, Zhao Xu was flying above the undead creatures below, and similar creatures in the air were also flying away from the cliff, as if a big battle was about to erupt.
Here is the translation of the text:

Compared to the need to flap one's wings repeatedly, Zhao Xu relied on his "flight technique" to make it seem like he was walking on the ground, very stable. Moreover, in previous instances, Zhao Xu's flight was not the main objective, but was mixed with other complex tasks, and he had never really experienced what it was like to fly.

This time, Zhao Xu's flight was an attempt to try various acceleration and deceleration maneuvers to avoid colliding with the undead creatures ahead.

He was also starting to understand why players who had been buffed with "group flight technique" by him would get excited and directly lead to an increase in the number of players choosing mage and priest classes.

Moreover, the fact that he was able to showcase this himself, rather than relying on temporary external forces, gave Zhao Xu a sense of excitement.

It's only natural for humans to have a desire to conquer the sky. Even Zhao Xu was no exception.

As Zhao Xu approached the buildings in the city of Anta, he began to see more varieties of undead creatures, many of which he had never seen before.

From the start of his adventure to obtain the "steel will" Zhao Xu had seen more than 99% of the undead creatures that adventurers had seen.

Zhao Xu also noticed that most undead creatures that could fly were basically spectral bodies.

In no time, Zhao Xu flew to the edge of the city's low-rise buildings and directly landed on an open "balcony". His flight technique was usually limited to 5 minutes per level, which made it difficult for him to travel too far.

In fact, during this disturbance, it was the best opportunity to sneak into the temple.

Undead creatures did not need to eat or drink, nor did they need to sleep. It was only this unexpected disturbance that could lure them away.
Here is the translation of the text:

However, Zhao Xu is not currently near that temple, and who knows if he'll be directly confronted by those legendary undead creatures when he gets there.

Zhao Xu's whole person was extremely vigilant, and just a few legendary undead creatures had emerged, refreshing his imagination of the city's foundation. It wasn't just the "demon's atrophy" and "half-god mummy" he had seen at first. Just thinking about it, these undead creatures might have been living here since the time of the dead god.

After all, undead creatures themselves are born with eternal life, so it's not strange for them to become legendary after experiencing thousands of years of history.

So Zhao Xu thought it over and decided to hide in one or two rooms, waiting for the "god's mark" to activate and the "god's image" to split into two swords, creating a disturbance that would pass before he slowly advanced. Otherwise, in this chaotic situation, he would likely be swallowed by the undead creature's tide.

As Zhao Xu glanced at the balcony door, he didn't think much and slipped in, only to find that it was empty, with no furniture or miscellaneous items, as if it had never been used.

Zhao Xu knelt down slightly, preparing for any movement at the staircase and observing his own state.

"Sense of Death" and "Spectral Feature" are extremely powerful effects, so strong that he needed to thoroughly familiarize himself with them in order to use them well.

"Master, how did you suddenly jump down? Did you see something unusual?" Lakis asked.

Zhao Xu's whole person was still in a state of revenge after hearing Lakis' question, but he still recounted what he had seen in detail.

"What's strange is that they just killed each other without saying a word?" Lakis was clearly not expecting such a scene.
Here is the translation of the text:

"It's possible that these legendary undead creatures knew about the strange power of the godlike statue from the start, but they couldn't obtain the energy within it and could only limit their entry. Therefore, this can explain why the revenants didn't climb up the cliff. It's possible that it's because of the existence of the 'Soul Lord' power.

"So, did they issue an order to 'kill on sight, regardless of species, if any living being approaches the statue'?" Larks added.

This is the only explanation for why Zhao Xiu didn't even get to finish speaking before being killed by the dozen or so undead creatures. Because the others suspected he might have that ability, they naturally had no intention of letting him go.

With a "better to miss the target than to let it slip away" mindset, they directly surrounded and attacked him.

Zhao Xiu could only control a weakened version of the "Soul Lord" supernatural ability when facing the dozen or so undead creatures coming at him together, and he was powerless to react.

At this moment, Zhao Xiu perked up his ears and listened to the vibrations around him. The ground was still trembling with a moderate vibration, indicating that many undead creatures were being startled and running around. However, he didn't hear any strange sounds coming from below the stairs.

After thinking for a moment, Zhao Xiu quietly tiptoed and activated his "Stealth" skill, slowly making his way to the wooden staircase.

"Master, look," Larks suddenly said.

At this moment, Zhao Xiu almost flipped over to avoid the attack that might come from behind.

However, he quickly sensed that Larks' tone didn't contain any sense of urgency, and he slightly relaxed his breath, turning back to look at Larks as if asking what he wanted to show him.

On the wall just beside the door he had just entered, the pale wall surface was dimly lit, but it was clear that a row of small characters had been carved into it with a small knife."
Here is the translation of the text:

"Edmund, a nameless soldier, has arrived at this place."

Below that, there is an additional line in a similar font style:

"Returning to the site where Edmund's unyielding existence lies."

At this moment, Zhao Xiu's thoughts were even drifting back to a thousand years ago.

Edmund, who had just escaped from prison, convinced himself to believe in the words of the priest in the prison, and using the methods and incantations given to him, he endured countless hardships to find the location of the "Sleeping City" in the astral plane.

At this time, the other party was probably also looking at the countless undead creatures in the city, and directly climbed over the wall and entered the second floor of the house on the edge of the city.

The other party did not know how long they had hidden in this room, leaving behind their mark.

Zhao Xiu then quietly walked over, drew out the dagger tied to his own calf, and on it, inscribed another sentence:

"Scholar 'Zhong Xia' has arrived at this place."
