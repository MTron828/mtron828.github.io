Chapter 545: Safe Passage Quota

"Zhong Xia Master."

Karl Master, who was squatting in front of the stone transmission portal, operating the communication device in his hand, looked up as Zhao Xu walked over and quickly closed the box with not a single seam, then stood up and greeted him with a bow.

Karl Master's robe was adorned with the insignia of the transmission portal strategic team, and his resume listed a series of awards for completed transmission portal projects, demonstrating his rich experience.

In many cities, when it comes to building transmission portals, these team members need to personally go to the site to connect.

Even if the president of the local association is a nine-ring master, it would be of no use.

So, despite being only a five-ring master, Karl Master, who may seem impressive to outsiders, is still considered middle-level within the organization and receives great respect and hospitality when visiting cities.

Let alone the fact that he is only in his early forties and can still break through to a higher level before entering old age.

Karl Master may be proud, but he would not look down on the "Zhong Xia Master" in front of him, who is only in his early twenties.

Even though the other is just an "Earth player."

At twenty years old, a five-ring master is already a legendary strong warrior, or "determined" in other words.

Before coming, he had been greeted by not fewer than three high-ranking officials of the organization, including his direct supervisor.

As long as Zhong Xia does not make unreasonable demands, Karl will try to satisfy him as much as possible.

However, this "satisfaction" definitely does not include the "communication device" in front of him.
Here is the translation of the text:

Only through this set of equipment can the portal seamlessly connect to the current network, otherwise it would be like an isolated island disconnected from the network.

If he doesn't make it a two-way portal, he would only be able to send people to a specific location and then lose them.

If he wants to make it a two-way portal, he would need to build another portal at the designated location and station personnel there, otherwise, anyone who enters the portal on the other side could directly reach the portal on this side, which is the core area of the association's residence.

"You all keep working, I've been curious about the 'portation technique' and came here to take a look," Zhao Xu said.

Meanwhile, his eyes were constantly scanning the area, including the dozen or so alchemists and Karl, a wizard.

When Zhao Xu finished speaking, Karl didn't say much, only re-scanning the box containing the eye-link device and sealing the secret inside, before continuing to calculate on the board.

Karl, who had worked for many years, was confident in handling the curiosity of these wizards.

Zhao Xu also smiled wryly, knowing that the secret was well-protected.

In reality, the majority of the work on the portal network had been completed in Mistral, and Karl was only setting up an "interface" here.

In general, building a one-way portal costs 50,000 gold coins in materials and requires a sufficient life energy, and the market price is 100,000 gold coins.

However, Zhao Xu's portal, which only connects to the network, costs only half the price, 25,000 gold coins in materials, and the market price is 50,000 gold coins.

Usually, the association pays for this expense, and Zhao Xu has waived it this time.
Here is the translation:

Essentially, the construction progress of a portal is around 1,000 gold coins per day, according to the market price of 50,000 gold coins, and it takes approximately 50 days to complete. However, Zhao Xu's destination this time is not just one, and adding an extra destination requires an additional 25% gold coins, so it will take around 60 days to complete, which coincides with the planetary crossing node.

In reality, the standard portal material usage is not mainstream. Most organizations use portals at a low frequency, and many things are limited by price, such as daily usage limits or requiring multiple days to use once, making them even more affordable.

"Mr. Zhongxia, have you set multiple destinations for this portal, and will you activate it with a password when the time comes?"

"Yes," Zhao Xu nodded.

"That means you don't need to set a passwordless transmission to other locations, such as the Abyssal Furnace," said the other party.

"No need," Zhao Xu politely declined.

However, his gaze was fixed on the box under Carl's wizardry.

The wizard's association has a login point that limits the selection of transmission targets to the current town with a portal. Therefore, Zhao Xu cannot choose the "Descent Site" as the transmission target, and the association will not agree.

Because this is a risk of exposing the entire transmission network to the Descent Site.

However, if he rebuilds a standard 100,000-gold-coin portal, it will take 100 days to complete.

So Zhao Xu must obtain the key to the "Communication Device" in Carl's possession to control the 50-day manufacturing period of the 50,000-gold-coin portal.
Here is the translation of the text:

When the time comes, and he doesn't join the Mystera, the portal to "Fallen Town" and "Descent Land" will be a secret two-way passage, and won't disturb the Magic Capital. The problem is that Carlus looks at that device as more important than his life.

For ordinary people, the operating principle of the portal is extremely mysterious and complex, and cannot be deciphered. However, for a five-ring mage like Zhao Xiu, who has 29 intelligence and potential points, it's not a problem. He can do better than Carlus with those devices.

After taking a deep breath, Zhao Xiu's gaze continued to fall on Carlus. Now, Zhao Xiu is no longer Wu Xiaoming; he has always been one who considers victory beforehand and loses afterwards.

If he fails this time, he'll have to figure out a way to cast the nine-ring "Portal Array" in "Descent Land".

As Zhao Xiu thought this, he smiled slightly.

He glanced at his current dynamic bar.

【Adventurer Zhongxia, you cast the four-ring Holy Warrior spell, "Merciful Descent".】
【Adventurer Zhongxia, "Merciful Descent" takes effect, granting you immunity to injuries, charms, and intimidation effects, as well as immunity to dizziness, exhaustion, nausea, and confusion. Duration: 60/64 minutes (spell delay)】

The sound of a strange resonance suddenly echoed at the door, as if someone was peeking in from there.

Carlus, whose spirit was already tense, suddenly turned his head and shouted, "Who?"

In that instant, Zhao Xiu let out a barely audible voice from his throat - "Instant Explosion!"

Instantly, the four-ring spell turned Zhao Xiu's entire body into slow-motion time, as if he had borrowed time from the future. Everything around him seemed to freeze.

A magnifying glass thrown by an alchemist to his apprentice hovered in mid-air.
Zhao Xu's gaze swept across the entire scene, undoubtedly drawing in most of the crowd's attention with the recent unusual phenomenon. At this moment, he was standing beside Karal, a mysterious box with a portal key, which was also being ignored by Karal for the first time.

Only for a fleeting instant.

But Zhao Xu stretched the moment to the length of a standard action time.

Long enough for Zhao Xu to cast another spell.

However, Zhao Xu simply knelt down, opening the box with an air of nonchalance, and scanned its contents.

It wasn't until several seconds later that he closed the box and stood up again.

By the time Karal was working, Zhao Xu had already opened the box without arousing suspicion.

Otherwise, Karal would definitely prepare various notes before sleeping, and Zhao Xu's momentary lapse would have exposed him.

Through the simulation of his latent abilities, Zhao Xu browsed through the contents of the box, feeling no unfamiliar sensations whatsoever.

Knowledge is the driving force behind a mage's every action.

The time borrowed from the future also came to an end, and the flow of time resumed its normal course.

The telescope, which had been tossed, landed steadily in the apprentice's hand.

After being distracted, no one noticed what had just happened here.

Even Zhao Xu, who was still strong, could directly cast a spell to stop time and observe the box for five rotations.

At that time, even if everyone was staring at the box, it would have been useless.

Meanwhile, Karal turned his head, only to find nothing unusual, and immediately turned back to look at his "communication device".

This wooden box remained steadily in the same position, still tightly closed.

It was impossible for it to have been opened in an instant.
Here is the translation of the text:

Karl, the magician, let out a sigh of relief and felt a bit embarrassed, thinking that he was too paranoid.

Just then, Zhao Xu spoke up directly, "I'll go take a look outside and send some more guards to patrol."

With that, Zhao Xu smiled and left.

"...Did you get it?" Wang Congwei looked at Zhao Xu as he reappeared in the wooden plank room, curious.

"That's a definite yes," Zhao Xu nodded and handed over the "secret content" he had just obtained.

Wang Congwei was also impressed, "Karl, the magician, is being too cautious again."

"Each time he uses that box, he uses a true vision gemstone, although this high-level gemstone costing 75,000 gold coins can only be used continuously for 30 minutes. It's enough to cover it," Zhao Xu agreed, "Otherwise, I could have discovered it with my secret eye behind him."

"Moreover, he uses 10 minutes every day to cast a five-ring spell, 'Magician's Secret Room', to prevent divination spells from being discovered."

"Even that treasure box doesn't allow other craftsmen to see it. Otherwise, I would have obtained it through memory reading early on."

Zhao Xu couldn't help but rub his forehead, feeling that the magician had enough means to obtain secrets.

However, when facing another magician, he would easily hit a dead end.

Unless he himself is a stronger magician.

"However, it's good that we didn't use the control spell to obtain information. Otherwise, when Karl returns, these secrets would be hard to hide, and we wouldn't have to worry about the other side discovering the modified key at any time."

Zhao Xu said, looking at the paper he had copied out, "So, Xun, have you thought it through?"
Suddenly, Wang Ningwei spoke in a low tone, saying, "Who will go through that portal first and arrive at the safest star town?"

Wang Ningwei's voice was clear, but it also revealed a hint of cruelty.
