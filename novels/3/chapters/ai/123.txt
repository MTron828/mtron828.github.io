Chapter 124: Record

Ansenio laid down the "automatic recording quill" and simply explained how to use it before leaving.

Zhao Xu picked up the magical quill, which looked similar to a ordinary quill, but was worth 1750 gold coins.

According to Ansenio's explanation, as long as he awakened the "scroll of recording" ability and used dragon language, he could activate the quill to start writing text as he wanted.

Although it could only be activated once a day, it was strong in that it could work without being monitored.

As long as Zhao Xu activated it before falling asleep, it would work until the recording was complete.

However, there was a condition for Zhao Xu to have this quill.

He had to be able to activate it before the illusion projection ended.

The condition was that he had already mastered the "scroll of recording".

The forum post about recording with a goose quill had become a daily post.

Zhao Xu took a deep breath, focused his attention on the illusion projection, and began to think about the secrets of the "scroll of recording".

Since he had awakened as a wise sage, recording the spell had become as easy as eating for him.

Those spell models were like ancient stone tablets in a deep mountain forest. Others would struggle to climb up, take a glance, and then painstakingly copy what they saw.

This was also the reason why ordinary wizards spent a whole day studying the recording spell and understanding it.
The consumption of spells, transcribing them into scrolls, is part of the manufacturing process, starting from half an hour at level zero, all the way to three days for level nine spells.

Since the game started, most mages have spent their time understanding the process of transcribing spells, unable to fight monsters, simply acting as carriers of spell incantations.

Otherwise, the mage account deletion incident wouldn't have been so easily brewing.

At the beginning, Zhao Xu relied on his ability as a "wise spellcaster" to transcribe spells into his mind, similar to taking a cable car up the mountain with a camera and naturally not experiencing the hardships of ordinary mage players.

The residents of Arthur need several years, or even a decade, to complete mage training, which is not just an empty phrase.

Slowly, Zhao Xu took hold of his pen, dipped it in special ink, and began to write on the already flattened parchment according to the spell model in his mind.

The object Zhao Xu chose to transcribe was the "Reading Magic" on the illusion projection, which was playing the key points of the transcription.

This spell is the simplest and most familiar to the majority of mages.

As Zhao Xu's pen began to sketch and wander, his inner calm gradually settled.

Many mage apprentices in the square were scratching their heads in frustration.

It's easy to imitate, but making the transcribed scroll magical is not so simple.

After the spell transcription is complete, the entire casting process, including the consumption of various spell materials and experience, has already been integrated into that scroll.

This is also the reason why ordinary people who have not studied magic, as long as they have received training in the ability to "use magic devices," can use scrolls to cast spells.

The mage apprentices present have not yet obtained spell slots, so they learn the ability to transcribe scrolls in order to transcribe spells into spell books first.
Here is the translation:

Each person has already mastered the "reading magic" spell, which is the only spell that can be memorized without writing it down. For aspiring wizards who have just started their training, this is not just a training session to copy scrolls, but also a competition. Most of the wizards who were selected to participate in this training session are those who have just started their course and are eager to compare with each other.

To motivate these apprentices, the Floating City also promised that the first one to successfully awaken the ability to copy scrolls within the three-hour training period will receive an "automatic note-taking feather pen." This pen can automatically record the "reading magic" spell that they have memorized in their minds and write it down in their spellbooks.

Because they no longer need to spend half a day learning and understanding magic, as soon as they obtain this ability, copying becomes a matter of seconds. This nearly 2000 GP incentive has caused a commotion among the apprentices.

Many novice wizards from ordinary families have made up their minds to use this feather pen as a bribe to persuade their teachers to grant them assistant qualifications. Novice wizards from magic families, on the other hand, know that if they can successfully emerge from the top, they will have the opportunity to enter the family's key cultivation sequence.

As for the player community, many are more interested in selling this feather pen for gold coins to exchange for more practical items. These players are not just taking the prize to save time copying? They're not that lazy. One female wizard player, Luna, clutched her feather pen tightly, her hands trembling as she gazed at the illusory projection model being explained on the screen, feeling as if she couldn't breathe.
She was not originally on the list for this selection, but it was arranged for her by a warm player she knew in the floating city, Miss "Aisvixi". Luna is a professional studio player, playing games to make money. Her studio often appears in various popular online games, starting with the initial layout, rolling the snowball, from gold farming to selling, and then to boosting bosses, and so on. This time, the studio boss believed that the game "Arthur" would definitely become popular, so they discounted and sold the accounts of other popular online games, and devoted all their energy to Arthur. However, up to now, their studio has not graduated a single focus on the profession of spellcaster. But everyone is helpless, as within a month of the game's launch, Arthur has already ruined countless studios, and professional players, as high-level players, cannot understand why they are struggling like ordinary players. Finally, the studio boss made Luna delete her account as a ranger and switch to playing as a mage. Who knew that Luna was lucky, or rather, her path as a mage was very suitable, as her starting point was the magical floating city. However, after entering the floating city, she faced nothing but setbacks. The game NPCs were more arrogant than the mentors in other towns' mage academies and paid little attention to the players. In the player community, aside from a few exceptionally talented individuals, many were competing with each other. It wasn't until Luna met Aisvixi that her heart felt a little warmth. However, she didn't know through what means this person had fought for her opportunity, which she might end up wasting. At this point, Luna turned around and looked around the entire square, where many people were just as lost as she was. Among the player community, the fastest to master the ability to transcribe scrolls was half a day.
Here is the translation:

Three hours, or perhaps it's just a joke from the start. It's just a floating city dangling them with bait.

Thinking of this, Luna let out a deep sigh. Compared to other squares surrounded by walls, this square resembles a castle wall, with rows of rooms behind the second and third floors, all shrouded in darkness and impossible to see through.

Even Luna suspected that the high-level NPCs of the floating city were watching them from there.

"I can't take it anymore. How can we possibly finish in three hours? If I'm going to be delayed, I might as well not have graduated yet," a player who had finally managed to sneak in exclaimed, directly throwing down his pen and leaving.

Compared to studying on their own after class, everyone was competing with each other on this square, where unknown numbers of eyes were watching them. Some people had even raised their pens, preparing to take a shot.

These heavy disparities directly crushed people's spirits.

Even that player didn't understand why this broken game could drive him to the brink of mental collapse.

Meanwhile, the original mage Arthur, who had undergone years of training, was completely focused on mastering the "reading magic" spell they had thoroughly memorized.

They also faced enormous pressure, knowing that this was not just a simple "automatic note-taking brush" but a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

Arthur had developed for countless years.

The gods' existence meant that Arthur's development had not been greatly affected by external factors, but this was also the beginning of the slow solidification of social classes.

Everyone knew that mages were powerful, which made it even harder for someone to become a mage.
Here is the translation of the text:

These native-born mages didn't have the same privilege as those Earth adventurers, who came effortlessly without any trials. Even fewer mages from prominent families were able to enter the Floating City by defeating their siblings and cousins. Others could only attend the nearby city's association wizard school. Under such immense pressure, they dared not release their emotions.

Luna saw someone collapse and knew she shouldn't rejoice at someone's misfortune, but she couldn't help but let out a sigh.

Many times, it's not necessary to excel above others; knowing that others are equally struggling can bring comfort.

The man player had had enough and was about to leave, and Luna had already made up her mind to gather her things and go back to her grandfather, saying she couldn't take it anymore.

Suddenly, the lights on the square lit up.

Everyone was startled and turned to look around. Then, everyone's gaze was fixed on the projection in front, which seemed to be in a trance-like state.

The projection displayed a message:

"The Earth adventurer has successfully awakened the 'Copy Scroll' specialization and copied the 'Reading Magic' scroll in 22 minutes. The competition is over, and the winner will receive the 'Automatic Recording Quill'."
"A look back!" a novice exclaimed.

Everyone turned around, looking at the originally invisible second-floor room, where a window had become transparent. They could faintly see a man in a robe pushing open the door and leaving.

"How is this possible?"
This was the question that echoed in everyone's heart.
The apprentices who are familiar with the strict rules of the Floating City know that the person who can appear on the second floor must not have transcribed scrolls before, otherwise they would not compete with them. However, what is the fastest record of awakening "transcribing scrolls" in the Floating City? "But how can anyone transcribe a level zero spell so quickly?" a faint voice spoke up. At this point, the apprentice mages present couldn't help but gasp, as the person transcribed a scroll that usually takes half an hour in just a few minutes, as opposed to their own spells that only take a few minutes. "If you subtract the initial explanation time, doesn't that mean the other person only took six minutes?" At this point, the group of apprentice mages who knew the truth were at a loss for words. How could that be possible? "Before the Great Cataclysm, when the rules of the magic network had not yet changed, transcribing a level zero spell scroll did indeed take six minutes," said a pale-faced mage apprentice.
