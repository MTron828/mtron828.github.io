Chapter 32: Aftermath

In the great hall, many apprentice mages sitting at the bottom were stunned by the scene before them, not knowing what was happening.

Some people with innate talent for specific elements, such as the Eight Major Styles, would suddenly shine when sitting on the throne. For example, someone with a transformation talent might see their accessories transform. Those with defensive talents might suddenly don a "mage shield" spell. Even without special effects, they might find a suitable path forward by thinking about their intentions.

This is also the reason why Mistral arranged the schedule for the apprentices to learn after awakening. However, these apprentices had never heard of someone disappearing into thin air.

What was even stranger was that the young man who disappeared for a while and then reappeared. Even the cloaked woman mage who transported someone away couldn't help but be stunned. "This privilege is too obvious, isn't it?" a thin, tall man in the corner of the player's area said. "Look at those NPC mages over there, they're about to blow their top. Someone's actually doing this kind of thing, and they're so nonchalant about it."

"Got it, just got to the throne, which is not even a player, this is internal strife within another player's faction," a fat man sitting next to him said, mocking.

"However, you didn't notice that he's also a Dongfang Shengjun, and it's even possible that he's a player too," someone said.

"If he's a player, I'll jump off the floating city and challenge the Continuous Falling Technique," another person said.

"You're really willing to bet," someone else replied.

"My older brother is part of the preparation team for this game. Before the promotional video was released, he didn't even know what kind of game this was. The entire process was a top-down decision made by the company's high-level executives, with no regard for cost. The only requirement was to have an account with a balance of at least 299 yuan. As for the game's content, nobody knows who made the decisions, and some even speculate that most of it was generated by AI.

The fat man spoke with excitement, his words pouring out in a continuous stream. "To be honest, there are precedents for game generation, but I've never seen a game as highly detailed as this one. I almost felt like I was under hypnosis. There are 19 zero-level magical models, and I really felt like I was casting spells. When I have the time, I'll write it all down in a book and have someone authenticate it. This game is so explosive, you're saying there's a back door? If so, I'll be the first to leave."

"So, the identity and treatment of that person I'm sure is a descendant of a powerful sorcerer. Otherwise, Mokal wouldn't be treating him with such respect. He wouldn't be bowing down to the princess of the Eastern Empire like that."

"In reality, I've given special treatment to others. Who would have thought that in this game, these NPCs would teach me a lesson."

The two men in front of him didn't say anything meaningful, and Wang Cengwei didn't care at all. Her gaze was fixed on the nine mysterious people standing in front of the stage.

Seven of them were of high social status, standing in the middle of the stage, while the other two were in a bodyguard position, each standing at an angle, circling around.

"How did you get here?" the old wizard, who was leading the ritual, asked with a bow.

"It's nothing, Anniya took someone away," the president of the Sorcerer's Association, Oswald, said as he paced back and forth beside the throne.

"Yes, after that novice appeared again," the old wizard replied."

The leader, Oss, paid no attention to it, waved his hand to cast a spell, and then half-kneeling, he observed the status of the throne. The remaining three people of the six-member team also came up one by one to take a look. The two guards remained standing at the corners, unmoving.

After silently exploring for five minutes, they finally stood up.

"Just leave some mess for us to clean up. Let's go," Oss said, waving his hand. The seven people followed him, with the middle-aged man who had been watching from the beginning also casting a spell.

"As for Mokar, interrupt the ritual, and tell the apprentices to come back in five days," he said.

"Okay, Leader," Mokar replied, though he knew that he had underestimated the impact of that young man.

The many apprentices below didn't know when their teachers had awakened, and unintentionally, they had been delayed by someone. Only a few who had received a recommendation had come to visit the high-level officials of Mistral, knowing the true identities of the mysterious people. They were hard to believe that a simple awakening ritual could attract the attention of giants.

However, he didn't know that the seven giants from Mistral were all present on the stage.

The seven people gathered, even if the gods had taken human form and appeared in the world, would not be able to escape the encirclement of the seven giants.

Until the curtain of illusion fell, the apprentices finally knew that the group of mysterious people had left. Most of them were still excited, looking at the old wizard Mokar, waiting for him to announce the start of the awakening ritual.

In the meeting room, the seven giants who had just gone through the portal from the other world had just emerged.

This small meeting room looked bare, with only a simple cypress wood circular table and twelve chairs.

However, all the instructions from the headquarters of the Mage Association were issued after being discussed in this conference room. Countless people in the association who tried to climb the ranks dreamed of getting a dedicated seat in this conference room.

"It's just convenient that we're having a meeting and something like this happens," said Ren, one of the Seven Giants, who had just sat down.

"When was the last time the throne of the King of Magic caused such a commotion?" asked Viren, the only female and only elf among the Seven Giants. She was lost in thought, standing by the window with a cigar in her mouth.

"It was over a hundred years ago, when that young Coroll was present," said Ren, one of the Seven Giants. "He became a legendary mage in just 35 years, which is the fastest record in the association's history. At that time, he even summoned a dragon of the Time Dragon level."

"If I hadn't intervened quickly, you would have seen two Time Dragons and one Scroll Dragon descending on Floating City," said Feng, with a hint of annoyance.

"That adventurer from the summer solstice was not simple," said Ren. "The impact of the shockwave on the throne of the King of Magic took more than three or four days to repair. When Coroll brought the disturbance, we handled it in just two hours and didn't delay the batch of apprentices."

"It's not that he's not simple, but the people he sees are not simple," corrected Feng.

The people present already knew the approximate information from Anniya, the third-generation magic goddess who had walked the path of magic before becoming a goddess, and had met the legendary mage Sislevina at the end of the magic path.
