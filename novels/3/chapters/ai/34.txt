Chapter 35: The Mysterious Prophecy
"This is too divine, isn't it?" Zhao Xu seemed to be having a hard time believing it.
"Not too miraculous, just that it's a trade-off between two specialties," Anzhi Noah explained.
Zhao Xu nodded, and Arthur had a strong specialty that required pre-requisites and job levels.
This is also the reason why many players are helpless in the later stages, unless they deliberately customize, or nobody knows what these requirements are.
Most players who can meet the specialization requirements usually coincidentally have this pre-requisite, which satisfies it.
Free spell selection is even more significant.
With many spells, wizards can prepare reports before tasks, and their spell arrangements for the day can basically cover most situations.
However, one must be cautious, as not having a spell that can solve the problem often makes it difficult for many wizards.
Preparing scrolls is expensive.
Unlike spell slots, which can be replenished daily, remaining spells cannot be converted.
Once Zhao Xu can freely cast spells, he will basically be unstoppable.
Like wizards, they can spontaneously cast spells and release their own mastered spells, but the cost is that they can only learn a few spells at each level, and it's very difficult to learn more.
Each level of spell is tens or hundreds, and it's impossible to cover all of them. This is also the reason why Arthur often praises wizards more than charming wizards.
"Master, I'm willing to learn," Zhao Xu didn't even ask for specific details, and directly expressed his expectations.
"Don't rush, let me explain it to you first."
Here is the translation:

The specialty that allows for free casting is called "Prescience", but the prerequisite is the specialty "Familiarity with Spells". Subsequently, Anzino began to elaborate on the two specialties.

The specialty content also appears directly on Zhao Xu's character panel, making it convenient for him to browse.

This is also one of the advantages of becoming a 1st-level occupation.

[SPECIALTY: Familiarity with Spells
Prerequisite: 1st-level Mage
Effect: When choosing this specialty, you can select a number of known spells equal to your Intelligence modifier. After that, you do not need a spellbook to prepare these spells.]

This specialty is quite mediocre, equivalent to having some spells that can be prepared without a spellbook and memorized in one's heart.

However, as a mage with a wise heart, he was naturally able to prepare spells without a spellbook.

Thinking of this, Zhao Xu could only shake his head and say it was mediocre.

[SPECIALTY: Prescience
Prerequisite: Intelligence 17, Familiarity with Spells
Effect: When preparing daily spells, you can reserve a number of spell slots equal to your Intelligence modifier.

1. With a standard action, you can use a reserved spell slot to cast any familiar spell that is not higher than the spell level.
2. With a full-round action, you can use a reserved spell slot to cast any spell you know that is not higher than the spell level, but the caster's level is reduced by 2.]

Looking at this specialty, Zhao Xu secretly felt a shock, but the restrictions were all within acceptable limits.

He could reserve 3 spell slots, equivalent to having 3 free casting opportunities.
This specialty is suitable for responding to sudden situations in the early stages.

The only limitation of this specialty is the casting time.
Here is the translation of the text:

Those who are proficient in magic can cast spells quickly (standard action). Those who are not proficient in magic need to take 6 seconds to cast a spell (full round action). After half a month of training, Zhao Xu had a clear understanding of various basic magical knowledge.

The casting time of general magic spells is fixed to be: instantaneous (swift action), standard action, or full round action (6 seconds). The rest are longer.

Arthas uses the "wheel" (6 seconds) to represent time.

This is because of various factors, including the fact that a caster can only release one "standard" + one "swift" spell, or directly one "full round" spell per round.

Previously, Anniya released the sea mirage spell, which is estimated to be done using this abnormal foresight ability.

In one round, Anniya spent the full 6 seconds casting the spell.

It's unlikely that Anniya would take the trouble to prepare such a spell just for fun.

Even if you're as skilled as a god, you still need to follow this rule.

Generally, a mage can only release one to two spells within 6 seconds. This is a well-known fact among mages.

It's impossible for a mage to suddenly release dozens of spells with swift action.

If that were the case, there would be no need to fight, and one would kneel down and beg for mercy instead.

The casting time for "standard action" depends on individual skill levels, with a general difference of a few seconds. With familiarity, one can further compress the time.

On the other hand, the casting time for "swift action" is instantaneous, but it usually comes at a great cost.

Therefore, low-level mages often only release one "standard" spell per round.

These are just side notes.
Here is the translation of the text:

The real question is that Zhao Xu does not have 17 intelligence points.
He has saved 3 points and put them in other attributes, leaving him with only 16 intelligence points.
At that time, Zhao Xu could only awkwardly look at An Ti Nuo Ya, with a pleading expression, as if begging for help.

An Ti Nuo Ya also knew that Zhao Xu did not have 17 intelligence points, and the fantasy of getting the apprentice badge he had earlier was already proven to be futile.

"Now I know that 17 intelligence points are useful too," he said. "Although it won't increase the number of spell slots or reduce the difficulty of avoidance, it can still become a roadblock."

Listening to An Ti Nuo Ya's sarcastic remarks, Zhao Xu, who was as old as a 30-year-old uncle in his past life, still begged for help with a sheepish expression.

Although that old wizard referred to An Ti Nuo Ya as his teacher, An Ti Nuo Ya had said earlier that she had mastered the "Timeless" 9th-level spell, and her mental and physical appearance had remained the same as when she was younger.

It was not a case of reverse aging, but rather a state she had locked in at that time.

Over the years, she had gained experience, but her mind was still young and had no signs of aging.

If that were the case, he wouldn't be able to maintain this face.

"You now have two options," An Ti Nuo Ya said.

Zhao Xu shook his head, thinking that he had always been given two options, but in reality, there was only one option.

"That one option is to wait for 4th-level intelligence boost and then master a new skill at 6th level," An Ti Nuo Ya continued.

Listening to her words, Zhao Xu shook his head again, feeling that the 5-year gap in his leveling up was too long.

He wasn't a main character in a novel, where adventures were arranged by the author, so he had to prepare his spells in advance.

Watching Zhao Xu's reaction, An Ti Nuo Ya continued to speak directly.
Here is the translation:

"Another option, I suppose, I'll take a loss. I previously agreed to give you a one-time 'Immortal's Unblemished Years' skill as a reward for joining our organization.

Now you can use it to exchange for a 'Wish' skill, and I'll help you increase your internal value of intelligence by 1 point."
