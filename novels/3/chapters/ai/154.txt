Chapter 155 Back to the Past
"Okay. Put on these shoes first," An Tinoya said.
Advance reward?
Zhao Xu couldn't help but guess the difficulty of this test.
But he was still very quick, and immediately put on the pair of deep red leather high-top teleportation boots. They were indeed very comfortable, fitting directly to his feet.
Now he also had three pieces of magical equipment.
With over a dozen equipment slots on his body, Zhao Xu equipped himself with magical equipment, at least a cloak and boots.
Compared to most players now, he could be considered extremely wealthy.
"Teacher, what is the test about?" Zhao Xu patted the dust off his body and asked.
"Find the Morin Stone Tablet, remember the contents on it, and come back and tell me," An Tinoya said softly.
Morin Stone Tablet?
Zhao Xu wondered if there was a Morin Stone Tablet near Mysteriousra.
He immediately tried to use his knowledge skill to check, but found that it completely failed.
"Where is it?" Zhao Xu asked.
"You'll find out when you cross to the vicinity of the stone tablet," An Tinoya said with a smile.
"Cross?"
"Yes, cross back to the Dark Age."
Zhao Xu's heart sank instantly.
The Dark Age, in the Mage Association, only referred to the period before the establishment of magical civilization.
Was he going to cross the river of history and go back tens of millions of years?
"Yes, next I will use legendary magic to send you back to that era," An Tinoya said, "Don't worry, at that time, official mages had not yet appeared, so the second-level spells you now master would be considered invincible back then."
"No, mentor, is it really that easy to travel back in time?" Zhao Xu already had a bad feeling about it.

Doesn't that mean legendary mages can go back in time and change history?

"It's not easy, and it requires very high requirements. Like me, I can't easily go back because the time channel can't bear my power. Only a few creatures like the time dragon can go back," An Tinoya said.

"But don't think you can easily change the past. As for why, you'll know after you become a legend," An Tinoya said.

"Alright then," Zhao Xu asked with some doubt, "How do I come back?"

"Just shout my name," An Tinoya said.

Although Zhao Xu felt it was not very reliable, he still nodded obediently.

If it really was that magic still in the ignorant age, then going back in time with the equipment he had wouldn't be too much of a worry.

"Mentor, shouldn't you give me a few more pieces of equipment?" Zhao Xu directly asked for more.

"Heh, even if I give you artifacts, you might not be able to bring them back," An Tinoya said.

Suddenly, a huge magic ritual array emerged on the ground in the entire spell battle room, and the countless arcane symbols outlined on the ground were directly activated, spreading out in a star-shaped pattern to the edge.

An Tinoya began to chant a spell, and with each syllable that fell, it sounded like a thunderclap in Zhao Xu's ears.

In an instant, the magic array on the ground began to emit purple lightning, constantly shooting into the air, slowly condensing into a spherical lightning.

The center of the sphere was already so hot that it was emitting light smoke, and the outer ring began to shimmer with a deep blue halo.
Suddenly, the spherical lightning seemed to be torn apart forcibly, revealing a gap in the center. 
"Quick, go in." Antinoya's tone was still calm, but slightly urgent. 
Zhao Xu hurriedly ran towards the spherical lightning, and as he approached, a strong gravitational force emerged at the boundary of time and space, distorting Zhao Xu's entire body and slowly shrinking until it disappeared. 
Zhao Xu looked at the cracked ground beneath his feet, lost in thought. 
The hot waves in the air continued to gush out, as if there was a huge furnace buried underground, constantly roasting the pedestrians on the ground. 
Looking up, Zhao Xu saw that the distant trees had also been dried up by the hot waves, and the entire elm forest had completely withered and died. 
"Endure the environment." Zhao Xu cast a first-level spell on himself. 
This spell allowed him to maintain normalcy in environments ranging from -45 to 60 degrees Celsius, preventing him from frostbite or heat wave damage. 
The originally scorching hot waves were instantly dispersed, and Zhao Xu's surroundings seemed to have a constant temperature environment. The scorching air he breathed in became more tolerable. 
Looking at the land in front of him, Zhao Xu couldn't help but feel a headache. 
Where was he going to find the stone tablet that Antinoya wanted? 
"Adventurer Zhongxia, you are under long-range attack, activating the Star Cape effect." 
Zhao Xu felt a weight on his shoulders, as if a force was coming at him. 
He turned around and saw three soldiers in leather armor holding makeshift bows and arrows aimed at him. 
But they all had looks of disbelief on their faces, as if they couldn't believe what was happening. 
In front of Zhao Xu, there was an arrow that had been broken into two pieces, clearly destroyed by his cape. 
Was he being ambushed?
Zhao Xu didn't expect to relax his guard to this extent and didn't react to being attacked. Perhaps when he first teleported here, these three people had already been lurking around, waiting to attack him as soon as he cast a spell. "Who are you?" Zhao Xu asked. The leader just shouted, "Run, this wizard is very powerful." Then the three of them hurriedly fled into the depths of the forest. Zhao Xu watched them disappear and didn't attempt to chase after them. In the era of the emergence of magical civilization, spells were a feared taboo, to the point where people would try to attack him as soon as they saw him. Faced with this situation, Zhao Xu didn't think much and directly cast the first-level divine spell "Earth Vein Detection." After three rounds, Zhao Xu put down the small magnetic artifact in his hand. A green aura emanated from his fingertips and then drilled into the ground. Gradually, a map began to form in his mind, depicting the surrounding area from the village to the ruins. Zhao Xu looked at the map, which covered a radius of nearly a hundred kilometers, and was grateful for the detailed information he could obtain in this unfamiliar place, thanks to the fourth-level divine spell of the druid. Thinking about the village not far from here, Zhao Xu decided to go there and ask the villagers, even if they were afraid of wizards. After all, he couldn't find any place with a stone monument on the entire map. Considering the proximity of the village, he decided to go there honestly, not wanting to waste any more spell slots.
Just walking on the road, he increasingly felt that the land was as dead as could be. There was absolutely no sign of any vitality. The scorching heat, which seemed to come from nowhere, had already destroyed all the life that had not yet grown. It was so dry that even a bowl of water poured on the ground would instantly evaporate. After walking for over half an hour, Zhao Xu slowly approached the nearest village. Out of caution, he cast a first-level spell on himself, the "disguise spell." This simple illusion could change his clothing, body shape, and even his appearance, making him taller or shorter. Zhao Xu's original mage outfit was indeed quite eye-catching, so he transformed into the appearance of a traveler. However, as Zhao Xu approached the village, he found that there was not a single sound to be heard. He walked in cautiously, readying his spells. Just a few days ago, he wouldn't have dared to come in alone without fully charged spells. As the saying goes, "poverty breeds bandits." Just encountering three people, they immediately wanted to shoot him without a second thought, even though he was a spellcaster, which was a bit excessive. But now, Zhao Xu had a starry cloak that was immune to ordinary weapons. In a situation where he had to fight, he still had some combat power, surely not to the extent that magic weapons were still common in this magical era, right? However, the village in front of him was eerily quiet, as if no one had ever existed there, let alone any sound of chickens or dogs. Even the few wooden houses near the village entrance had their doors wide open.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu tried to enter a deserted room, only to find that some movable household items had been taken away, leaving only heavy wooden furniture behind. It was as if he was fleeing from something.

"Is anyone here?" Zhao Xu called out loudly.

He was prepared to use his "hidden technique" at any moment. If anything was amiss, he would immediately cast a spell and take advantage of the chaos to escape the battle. As long as the villagers couldn't react quickly enough to find something like paint or flour to smear him, he wouldn't be able to see him again.

After searching several houses, Zhao Xu basically confirmed that everyone in the village had fled.

Zhao Xu held a letter in his hand, written by a father to his son, telling him that their whole family would flee to the Morin Stone Monument in the mountains.

The gods told the villagers that only by performing a sacrifice there could they obtain the forgiveness of the Fire God. This was the only way to lift the curse that had been cast on the land.

Zhao Xu couldn't help but sink into thought as he clutched the letter.

In later eras, elemental spirits had almost disappeared. Even high-ranking fire element kings were afraid to come out of their elements. They only responded to the summoning of wizards, appearing and disappearing at their beck and call.

In this dark age, elemental spirits still wielded great power.

Zhao Xu finished reading the letter and put it back on the table, waiting for the true owner to arrive.

He then turned around and headed towards the mountains behind the village.

However, a heavy burden was weighing on his heart, as the letter also contained a prophecy from the Fire God: "Kill all wizards."
