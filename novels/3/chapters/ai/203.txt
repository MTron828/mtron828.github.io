Chapter 204: Concealing the Truth

However, Zhao Xu still walked to the pile of "deep hellfire" that was almost completely corroded. The remnants seemed to be constantly self-corroding, but under the acceleration effect of Zhao Xu's "hammer of justice", they could not be eliminated instantly.

"Laksis, can I continue to apply the spell with a 'good' attribute to this pile of remnants?" Zhao Xu asked.

"If that's the case, I can just wait for you to kill it and then eliminate the traces," Laksis replied.

After some thought, Zhao Xu decided to take care of the remnants himself.

" Invisible servant," he immediately used this spell to summon an invisible and formless power.

Then, he took out a bag and a shovel from his backpack and handed it to the invisible servant, instructing it to collect and load the pile of remnants.

It wasn't that Zhao Xu was lazy, but rather that the remnants themselves possessed mysterious and polluting powers, and he didn't want to touch them rashly.

"Laksis, do you think you should put this bag containing the remnants in your backpack?" the servant reminded him. "However, that bag may not be able to hold all the remnants."

"What if it seeps through? Then all the things in your backpack will be contaminated," Laksis warned.

Zhao Xu smiled lightly and said, "Laksis, a mage still has some skills."

He had learned hundreds of spells and had also gained a significant increase in his adaptability.

Later, the servant followed Zhao Xu's instructions and loaded all the remaining remnants, then handed them to him.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu briefly glanced at the "Deep Furnace Refining Demon" that had just died in the corner, and indeed, there was no remaining residue.

He directly took out the magical materials he had intentionally searched for: a golden needle and a piece of high-quality fabric.

He then began to chant the incantation to release the two-ring magical spell, "Monster Pet Bag".

Suddenly, a golden light flashed on Zhao Xu's hand, and he quickly attached the energy bundle that needed to be touched to his robe.

The piece of fabric he had just taken out immediately adhered to his robe and turned into a magical pouch.

It looked like the pouches specially sewn onto robes to store magical materials.

However, if it were that simple, Zhao Xu wouldn't have needed to cast the two-ring magical spell.

"Monster Pet Bag" is a spell that allows wizards to temporarily store their monster pets in a pouch.

This means that the temporary pouch that seemed to be simply attached to his robe had actually become a subspace, with a capacity roughly equivalent to a bucket of water, perfectly capable of containing a monster.

After completing the spell, Zhao Xu directly put the bag containing the debris into the "Monster Pet Bag".

"Is this okay?" Lakshmi hesitated for a moment.

She naturally recognized this magical spell.

However, this magical spell was not specifically designed for storing monster pets?

"This spell is specifically designed for 'monster pets', with air inside for the monster to survive, and it can also use supernatural abilities. However, this does not mean it cannot store things. Otherwise, the monster would not be able to take off its clothes to get in."

Zhao Xu explained.

Moreover, at this time, the pouch on his robe still looked flat and plain, which was the result of this spell.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Clunk!"

Suddenly, a dull thud echoed from the front.

"Clunk!"

The second thud was even more deafening, as if a massive hammer had struck the stone door.

Is this the level of a Nine-Ring Mage?

Can they really just barge in without a problem?

Zhao Xu felt the entire altar hall shaking, "Lakshmi, are they really not going to cause any trouble?"

"It should be okay. We can just use a spell to restore it if needed," Lakshmi said, looking around.

Zhao Xu couldn't help but glance at his own two-ring magic and two-ring divine magic.

He suddenly felt a sense of inadequacy.

It seemed that the strength of two-ring magic was still too low, and it wouldn't be able to handle daily life until reaching five or six rings.

Just as Zhao Xu was wondering how Le An would use his method to break through the door, the stone door that had brought him in suddenly turned into nothingness.

Unlike brute force, the stone door seemed to be swallowed and digested like a piece of food, with no visible fragments.

"Separation spell," Zhao Xu couldn't help but silently recommend this no-return, eco-friendly decomposition spell to Lakshmi.

"Uh, master, I still know this. And besides, the opponent's position and timing were quite clever, and this altar's power was just interrupted. Otherwise, the external powers of this altar would have been linked together. If it were to be broken by brute force or an unauthorized biological transmission, it would trigger a self-destruct program."

Zhao Xu listened to this analysis and nodded slightly.

He knew more about the surface-level content, but to reach the level of understanding the inner workings, he would need to cultivate for a long time.
Here is the translation of the text:

Even if he had led the charge and broken through the door this time, he might have seen that the sacrificial altar's power had dissipated and thought he was just as strong.

At this moment, Rayan's figure emerged from behind the stone door.

He caught a glimpse of Zhao Xu's momentary expression, and his heart relaxed slightly.

Although Zhao Xu's group had a revive stone, it wouldn't be a big deal if something happened.

However, Rayan dared not let a group of low-level novice mages go searching for the entrance of the sacrificial altar without a care, naturally due to his identity as a ninth-ring mage, thinking that he could rescue the opponent with ease.

If he had just come in and seen that Zhao Xu had already died, he would have to make Anzueli laugh for a year and a half.

Thanks to the goddess's blessing.

"What about the 'Deep Hell Refiner'?" Rayan walked into the sacrificial altar without hesitation, his enhanced intuition already telling him that Zhao Xu was not transformed by the demon.

Behind him were a group of mages wearing the Mystic Star's Guardian uniform, each with a vigilant expression, scanning the entire sacrificial hall.

Following closely behind were the two priests who had seen Zhao Xu the night before, their faces filled with disdain, gazing at the various hellish statues and the sacrificial altar in the hall.

"I don't know, I came in and found that everything was gone," Zhao Xu said.

"Don't you dare think that your player's revive stone is 100% effective?" Rayan said.

"You shouldn't assume that the revive stone will work smoothly after the player's death. The prerequisite for using the revive stone is that the soul has drifted back to the 'Creation Holy Temple' in the highest place in the sky."
Here is the translation of the text:

"If there are powerful beings like you, Uncle Lei'an, who can disrupt things, you can only cry in front of the revival stone."

Zhao Xu immediately reacted with: "The Eight Ring Sealing Soul Technique?"

This technique can bind the target's body and life force, permanently preserving it in a gemstone, and only allowing the opponent's physical form to reassemble when the gemstone is shattered.

"That technique is even more tyrannical, directly binding your entire body, so you don't even count as having died, let alone revived."

Lei'an explained, without saying much about his methods.

"You also know what kind of enemies you're facing."

Hearing this, Zhao Xu also indicated that he had learned a lesson, nodding his head sincerely.

It's roughly around the 30th of the month when a big event will appear on the forum, where an adventure team will receive a task to retrieve an item from a certain location.

If it were just that simple, the high-ranking mage would naturally have a way to retrieve it. However, those players took the item and traded it for a pile of gold before fleeing.

At the time, the players thought they had found a bug, exploiting the system loophole of not completing the task after taking the task item, and proudly posted a thread on the forum.

In reality, they had already been noticed by the mage, who would soon come knocking on their door and demand the revival stone. Since they had already hidden all their equipment beforehand.

As a result, the group of players was subsequently hunted down and captured one by one, bound and sealed.

Binding is not death, so they couldn't come out of the Creation Holy Temple. This forced the players to cancel their accounts and re-register their characters.

This is also the most tyrannical method of killing, directly killing off the opponent, forcing them to cancel their account.
Here is the translation of the given text:

After the second advice "Respect the gods" in Zhao Xu's post "Ten Commandments for Newbies", the third one he left was "Don't provoke high-level mages". As for demons and devils, the two major races, souls are considered the most exquisite delicacy to them, especially for humans.

Even they use the most valuable currency, a gemstone that has imprisoned the soul. If one dies in the hands of a devil, there is a certain possibility that a high-level demon will intervene, and then there is a 1 in 5 chance. Or, he might wake up and find himself reborn as a low-ranking demon in hell, at which point he would truly want to die.

The only solution is to find a nine-ring mage and use "Wishcraft" and "Miracles" to rescue him.

Next, Lei An watched as his subordinates searched and checked the entire altar, including nearly ten priests who came to perform a purification ritual. Everyone was generally quiet, even avoiding eye contact with Zhao Xu.

Finally, after the altar was transformed into the "Green Jade" by Lei An, he whispered to Zhao Xu, "Uncle Zhong, let's connect." At this point, Zhao Xu finally realized that he had been focusing on the altar's details the whole time, worried that someone would discover his tracks, so he hadn't noticed Lei An's request for a heart-to-heart connection.

Zhao Xu immediately controlled his mental link, "What's weird, I should have accepted your heart-to-heart link." Otherwise, earlier in the mysterious forest, Lei An had communicated with him directly through mental telepathy.

This is also the reason why Lei An's voice appeared after the two women died, instead of directly linking with Zhao Xu, which made him suspicious.
Here is the translation of the text:

"You used the eight-ring spell 'Mental Barrier' to definitely block my kind of mental influence from affecting me, right?"

Zhao Xu only just noticed the problem here.

He had intentionally used the spell from the "All-Magic Book" to cast this mental barrier spell that could block any mental influence, as he was preparing to resist the "Group Petrification" spell from the "Deep Furnace Hell" summoned by the "Group Monster".

Moreover, the spell had a duration of one hour per caster level, so it was essentially a basic buff for any eight-ring mage who went on an adventure.

"Ah, don't explain, I know, the blessings of the goddess, ah, why didn't I have such luck?" Le'an continued to mutter to himself.

Zhao Xu relaxed a bit when he heard this.

He deliberately didn't cancel the eight-ring spell and thought about how to subtly hint to Le'an that he also had the seven-ring "Energy Immunity" and eight-ring "Higher Magic Immunity" spells on him.

As long as he could guide Le'an to think about the goddess's intervention, it seemed that Le'an would say nothing more than a few words, regardless of what happened here. He didn't even dare to ask the goddess of magic for verification.

Zhao Xu had obtained the divine artifact, and this would be concealed.

"The 'Higher Magic Immunity' on your body is too conspicuous, and you need to tone it down next time," Le'an warned.

Even a high-level mage with an eight-ring spell didn't need to run errands for the "Rose Cross" organization, not even the Church of the Holy See.

Someone at this level could even be a bishop.

"Hey, Grandpa Zhang, how do you want to write it?" Le'an whispered, even using his mental link.

"Just say it was a suicide?"
Here is the translation of the text:

"Isn't this a bit excessive? Can you give me a more reasonable explanation?" Lei An hesitated, not daring to continue asking.

"That's up to you to fill in," Zhao Xu said, and indeed he had no experience in this area.

At this point, Lei An heard Zhao Xu's response and felt relieved. He had been hoping for this response.

Well, in this day and age, even helping someone wipe their butt requires being extremely careful, which is already tough enough for him.
