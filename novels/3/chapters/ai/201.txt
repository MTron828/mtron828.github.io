Chapter 202: Forum Explosion

"Zhang Qi, let's go eat," said.

After washing his face, Chen Sǐnán walked back to his dormitory balcony and saw Zhang Qi still sitting in front of his computer, motionless, with a puzzled expression.

Just now, Zhang Qi had urged him to go out to eat. Today is Zhang Qi's girlfriend Lili's birthday, and he needs to accompany her to the mall to buy a birthday gift. Zhang Qi had deliberately said he would take him to eat at the new Old Zhang Fast Food near the road corner at noon, with roast duck leg and eggplant for just 10 yuan, which is very affordable.

"Eat, eat," Zhang Qi muttered to himself, his whole body frozen in a daze.

Chen Sǐnán looked over and glanced at Zhang Qi's laptop screen, where there were dozens of groups with countless "99+" information.

This doesn't seem right. Zhang Qi usually only plays games or chats in groups. His group messages can reach 99+, but only one possibility is that he is currently in the middle of a guild war in Azeroth.

Zhang Qi is still typing on his laptop, producing so many messages. The only possibility is...

Chen Sǐnán couldn't help but smile. Azeroth has been stable lately, and the number of players has started to rise this month. It's unlikely that there would be an explosion. Especially since he, as a paladin, has more inside information than players do.

So he is clear that there hasn't been any major incident in Azeroth recently. Zhang Qi has been paying attention to the Starfall Lake area lately, although some signs of trouble are emerging. However, the major guild leaders are still maintaining order, and it hasn't reached the stage of a true explosion.

"What's going on?" Chen Siren couldn't help but ask again.

At this moment, Zhang Qi suddenly let out a sigh and fell into a low-spirited atmosphere, "It's like comparing people to the dead."

"Uh?"

"You should look at the forum," Zhang Qi said, shaking his head. "The forum has blown up, along with all the QQ groups. Everyone is discussing and asking who that person is."

Zhang Qi said, shaking his head, "How is it possible to top this? Those high-level players from the big guilds play for 10 to 20 hours, and I can maintain at least 12 hours of playtime."

"You're saying something that's confusing me," Chen Siren looked at Zhang Qi's notebook, which was blocked by various QQ group information on the forum browser.

He directly grabbed Zhang Qi's mouse and gently moved the chat window aside.

"Jump clause activation?" Chen Siren noticed this information first, but didn't understand what it meant.

"That means if there are players above the second rank, this game clause will activate and announce the number of players at that rank," Zhang Qi explained directly.

"That's not written in white ink," Chen Siren laughed immediately.

If the "jump clause" is established based on the difference in level between players of different professions, it's indeed possible. For example, looking at the current situation, mage players are stuck at level 2, while warrior players may reach level 3 by the end of the month.

So, the biggest gamble on the forum right now is when warriors are at level 3, and mages can't even reach level 2, with many billions of forum coins being lost. This has become the largest collective bet on the forum since it was opened half a month ago.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

It's said that in three days, when things get settled, the official announcement will be made. If Chen Sīnán weren't being influenced by games, he would require himself to abide by the rules of Saint Warrior and stay away from gambling. Otherwise, he would have followed Zhang Qí and lost all his money.

Some big shots have even offered rewards, giving the first 2-level mage 100 GP in the game as a prize, although the amount is not large. However, after a while, when the administrator got involved, it's said that the chips have reached tens of thousands of gold coins.

On the other hand, there's another reward for the first 3-level warrior, which is not uncommon to hear, because it also represents the honor of being the first 3-level player in the entire server.

It can be said that if such a player appears, he would definitely be a one-in-a-thousand person.

Even if they wanted to establish a guild, people would flock to join, and the forum would be flooded with messages.

As Chen Sīnán finished speaking, Zhang Qí couldn't help but mutter to himself, "Ah, I've lost everything, including my accumulated savings of almost two years!"

"The rooftop of the forum is already crowded with warriors," Chen Sīnán finally understood what had happened. As a fan of warrior profession, Zhang Qí was the one who had bet on the warrior side in that big gamble on the forum.

He was suddenly shocked, and his breathing quickened. Didn't this mean that the first 3-level warrior, or the first 3-level player, had appeared?

Zhang Qí was still crying his eyes out.

Other professions, such as assassins and rangers, do have 2-level characters, but they are all recent upgrades. In contrast, those 2-level warriors have already accumulated almost half a month's worth of experience.

Moreover, the 2-level warriors have already reached two digits, so how could they be related to the "jump clause"?
Here is the translation of the text:

At this time, Chen Sīnán pushed his way between Zhang Qí and got closer, watching Zhang Qí open another tab——

"Forum News: 'The first 4th-level player appears, activates the "Jumping Rule", creates a holy temple and sends a list of all 4th- and 2nd-level personnel to the TC planning committee.'"

Chen Sīnán saw this information and suddenly looked a bit dazed, unable to react for a moment, and directly scrolled down to the next section.

Personnel List:

4th level: 1 person (details: 4th-level mage)
3rd level: 0 people (details: none)

...

Chen Sīnán didn't care about the numbers of warriors, barbarians, and holy warriors in the 2nd-level personnel list.

His throat felt dry and he wanted to swallow, but didn't dare to do so with force.

4th-level mage.

Currently, half of the players who entered the game for the first time are still stuck in the training process.

But now, someone is telling him that there are 4th-level mages?

As a holy warrior, Chen Sīnán didn't have much to say, he was just thinking that it was indeed true that some classmates who couldn't pass the mage training had deleted their accounts.

Sometimes, people can't be compared.

"Playing dumb is fine, but it has its limits, don't you think? If the other party is actually a 2nd-level mage, I can accept that."

At this time, Zhang Qí finally recovered from his forum bankruptcy, having lost his capital and unable to seek resources on the forum.

"Just as this post appeared, the forum has already had over thirty new player posts saying they want to switch to mage professions."

In the past, warriors relied on their high-level player ranks and advantages in battle strength during the first level, and were able to dominate the forum, saying they were warriors and could speak their minds.
Here is the translation of the text:

As for myself being a mage, even if I have gone through hardships and finally graduated, someone can still make a one-sentence comment that leaves me speechless.

Who could have thought that reality would be so convoluted and unexpected?

Everyone is still walking towards the second floor, and then someone has already arrived at the fourth floor, preparing to take the elevator down to take a look at them.

"What's going on?" Chen Sīnán finally regained his composure and asked.

"I don't know, all the QQ groups are blowing up, the TC customer service is being bombarded with calls, and countless players are asking who that person is," Zhang Qí explained.

Chen Sīnán was also slightly stunned, and then sat back down in his original position, pulled out his phone to read the post just posted.

"I thought this activation clause would never see the light of day, and I was thinking about whether it was the Three March Winds or Xiao Jian who would be the first to reach level 3. Who would have thought that we are all like frogs at the bottom of a well."

"Same level, I'm really having a hard time believing it, feeling like you've been working hard all the time, only to be knocked down by someone, and then someone tells you that you've wasted your energy, like you were born in Rome."

"You're not describing it correctly? Someone else has actually reached level 4, don't act like it was just luck,"

"I just wish the big brothers would show up and give us a target to lick. Mages can't play anymore, can you give us a strategy?"

"Ah! Ah! Level 4! Did I get it wrong? How is this possible?"

Chen Sīnán rarely posts on the forum, but he couldn't help but respond, admiring the level 4 player and wondering how they achieved it.
Here is the translation:

"Hey, quickly take a look at the latest hot thread, there's a big shot analyzing a post!" Suddenly, Zhang Qi's eyes lit up like he'd been electrified, and he excitedly turned to Chen Sishan and said, "Hey, let's take a look."

Chen Sishan finally opened the module as Zhang Qi instructed him to - "The poster of 'The Road to Mage' is actually a level 4 player! Everyone's eyes are on the level 4 player, but no one noticed that there are also 4 level 2 players in the mage group. The mage profession is really too ridiculous, with so many high-ranking players who can manipulate the game. If there's no bug, who knows the inside story?"

"Ah, forget it, let's go eat," Zhang Qi said, feeling too bored to continue reading.

As he walked by Zhao Xu's bed, he saw Zhao Xu still wearing a VR headset, with flashing lights indicating that he was still in the midst of a battle.

"Xu Sheng, you'd better try harder, look at everyone else is already level 4," Zhang Qi whispered lowly.

...

In the female dormitory, Cui Lu went to a tennis elective course in the morning and played until lunchtime. After a shower, she went to look for Fang Xi Yue and a few others to eat.

As she noticed, Fang Xi Yue was suddenly very quiet, staring at the computer screen without the usual noise of typing.

"What's wrong with Xi Yue?" Cui Lu asked, wiping her hair with a towel.

Hearing this, Fang Xi Yue suddenly came to life, exclaiming, "Lu Lu, quickly take a look, someone has already reached level 4, and it's a mage player! Others are guessing it's the same poster as 'East City Rong' that you liked before. Ah, it's so great! We girls have finally got our revenge!"

Cui Lu's towel suddenly fell to the ground, and she quickly picked it up. Is it a level 4 mage?
Cui Lu suddenly revealed a bewildered expression on her face, and a person's face flashed in her mind before she shook her head vigorously.

In that instant, countless Arthur forums were intensely debating whether such a person existed or not.

Or, to put it another way, they were all asking.

Who is this person?
