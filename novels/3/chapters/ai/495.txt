Chapter 496: Plunder

The alliance leader from the north, a man in his early 40s with a mature and dignified appearance, had a few strands of beard that added a touch of charm to his face. He wore a lightweight armor set and a custom-made sword at his waist, symbolizing his position as commander-in-chief of the alliance army. As he attended the banquet, he made sure to emphasize his strength and determination to defend the icy mountain range.

However, no one questioned his behavior. When Zhao Xu looked at the alliance leader, Tang De, he felt an unfamiliar urge to cast a spell at his face for the first time. It was as if he had suddenly become someone he used to dislike.

Tang De must have possessed some kind of mental shield to remain calm and composed despite knowing that the other party was the mastermind behind the scenes. The "Hidden Eye", a valuable item worth over 100,000 gold coins, was one such example of a basic magical item that could achieve this. It was also a standard equipment for the leaders of major organizations.

"Miristra, Mage Association, Four-Ring Mage, Zhongxia," Zhao Xu introduced himself.

As he spoke, his voice was not loud, but it was as if a red-hot iron was being poured onto the lake, causing it to boil and foam, and the atmosphere reached its peak. "Is it him?" "The one who possesses the divine artifact?"
Here is the translation of the text:

"What is it?"

"It's not a mistake, it's the one who repelled hundreds of people who attacked him that night, I remember his name is Zhongxia."

The gasps of surprise suddenly erupted, like waves crashing one after another, and all eyes in the room were fixed intensely on Zhao Xu.

It's no wonder that these distinguished guests, who had already gained some reputation, let out a collective gasp of surprise.

After all, the name "Zhongxia" is a hot topic in the current alliance.

Not to mention the remarkable achievements he has accomplished since then, which have raised expectations about the legendary artifact's power.

Zhao Xu was taken aback, noticing that Tang De was staring at him with an unusual gaze, as if a golden light had burst forth, and his original shadow disappeared.

It turned out that everyone was unaware.

"Wow, isn't that incredibly strong?"

"This young man is already a four-ring mage at such an age, and I have no idea which family he belongs to."

"You're slow on the uptake, he's a player, and currently the first one. You can't compete with this level of thinking."

As this comment spread, the gazes of the noble girls in the banquet hall gradually returned to normal.

For these unattached girls, tonight was supposed to be an initial "scouting" round.

In the upper echelons of the Orus city alliance, numerous outstanding young people had gathered here.

But for Zhao Xu, who had repelled hundreds of attackers that night, his reputation as a powerful mage was proven, and this kind of strength was unmatched.

This was what had captivated countless noble girls' hearts.
Here is the translation of the text:

As for the possibility of following him and wandering the world, it might be a plus for a girl with a hero complex. However, after hearing about this player's identity, many noble maidens who were previously filled with romantic fantasies suddenly lost their interest.

Some excellent young men who had been looking at Zhao Xu with a resentful gaze also softened their expressions. Only the guests who had secretly sent someone to act on their behalf and had planned a scheme were silently observing Zhao Xu, thinking about their next move.

Zhao Xu had already realized why everyone's gaze was so astonished, as if they were hearing about his appearance for the first time. He couldn't help but glance at the person beside him, who was still smiling with satisfaction and had introduced him earlier.

It was clear that Zhao Xu and his companions had not received any search or attention from the law enforcement or the city guards since last night. This was likely due to the efforts of Frère, who had taken great pains to conceal the information and delayed the release of the news for a whole day.

This made Zhao Xu reevaluate Frère's abilities. In the past, Frère's sister had died in childbirth next to Tang De, and he had been quickly ostracized from the noble circle. Now, it seemed that he could maintain his position in the upper echelons for a while and make a name for himself. Therefore, his methods would not be simple.

"Ah, it seems that this is a person of such caliber. I must admit that I was wrong."

Tang De walked up to Zhao Xu and, with a strong scent of incense filling the air, grasped Zhao Xu's hand with a joyful and humble expression. At the same time, he turned to face the guests in the grand hall and loudly declared, "Everyone, I have some news to announce."
Here is the translation of the text:

"Before, the palace of Eidozi descended from the sky and exploded in the forest, causing a massive explosion. At that time, a message was sent from the center of the explosion, saying that it contained a divine artifact."

"'Even numerous adventurers on the scene all agreed that it was Mr. Zhongxia who obtained the ultimate divine artifact.'"

"At this time, Tangde was simply holding Zhao Xu's arm and shoulder, as if he were a nephew. Following Tangde's reminder, the speculation about the 'divine artifact' that was swirling in everyone's mind was torn apart and spread out on the table."

"The players responsible for patrolling the banquet hall also couldn't help but relax their vigilance and look towards the high platform in front of them."

"One of the warrior players couldn't help but mutter to himself, 'Is our leader going to be so silly as to force us to hand over the divine artifact on the spot?'"

"As he spoke, he couldn't help but press his hand on the standard longsword beside him."

"Instantly, the team leader on his side quickly covered his hand, stared at the impulsive player, and said, 'What are you doing? Are you planning a rebellion?'"

"Having stared at each other, the warrior player finally retracted his hand and explained, 'No, I was just being cautious.'"

"The warrior player who was about to make a move, but then hesitated, was a half-professional in the game. He thought for a moment before giving up."

"Seeing that the other side had retracted, the team leader who was in charge of the escort team also let out a sigh of relief."

"These fearless players were indeed useful, but they also had their own personalities, and some were prone to drawing their swords at the slightest provocation, which made him feel uneasy."

"In the end, the players who were able to smoothly enter the high-level banquet hall were also selected by the official alliance and intentionally cultivated. So the other side finally retracted. However, he also became vigilant and gave a subtle nod to the team leader from the Arthurian homeland as a warning."
Here is the translation of the text:

He seemed to underestimate the prestige of the "Summer Solstice" player, who could attract other players' support just by his name.

Zhao Xu was suddenly put on the grill by Tang De, which also surprised him. He couldn't help but think that Tang De was not the kind of person who was greedy and couldn't distinguish between right and wrong, otherwise he wouldn't have risen to such a high position today.

The devil had taken his faith and his soul after death, but wouldn't take his brain.

He publicly declared that Zhao Xu had obtained the divine artifact, and it was certain that he had his own intentions, not necessarily to surrender the artifact publicly and take on a heavy responsibility.

"When I first entered the divine artifact, the team of about 20 people from the initial explosion period was basically killed when they were thrown out of the palace of Ai Zhu. Even those who were hiding were unable to escape the explosion damage in that instant."

"Without internal witnesses, the originally arranged schedule was broken, and only two days passed before the team ascended into the sky. At that time, I also believed that Mr. Summer Solstice was the ultimate winner, who had obtained the divine artifact, otherwise it would be impossible to explain why only Mr. Summer Solstice survived and ascended first."

As soon as he finished speaking, the guests in the banquet hall were all intrigued by Tang De's words, and they all looked at the two people on the stage.

They had already unconsciously sensed that there must be some secrets hidden internally.

In the current alliance, many people were searching for Zhao Xu, not for revenge against the hundreds of people who had been attacked that night. Instead, they were trying to find Zhao Xu as the friends of the expedition team that had entered the palace in the past six hours, to ask him what had happened inside and why all the adventurers had died, except for him.

Sometimes, not dying together means it's a mistake.
Here is the translation of the text:

When Zhao Xu heard Tang De's words, his mind also relaxed, and he had already understood Tang De's intention.

It turned out that Tang De was trying to save face in a roundabout way.

"However, just as this, the 'Joint Investigation Team' composed of officials from the Alliance, numerous temples, and the Association of Mages, which was formed to investigate, has already reached a final conclusion."

"This investigation result is guaranteed by many benevolent churches within the current city of Oro Valley."

"The divine artifact 'Sacred Breath' has followed the ascension of the palace of El'goroth, and we want to truly obtain it. We will have to wait until the next time it descends."

As soon as Tang De finished speaking, he couldn't suppress the murmurs of everyone in the room.

The waves of sound rose and fell, one wave after another, and no one could accept this shocking news. Even those who deal in news, they wanted to leave immediately and spread the news.

It turned out that no one had obtained the "Sacred Breath"!
It's no wonder that next time it descends, it will attract many legendary strong characters.

Even in the next few decades, the Alliance will likely set up watchtowers in the vicinity of the explosion region to monitor any unusual movements and report back.

"I'm going, it's really like that?" said a warrior player standing at the edge of the hall, his shining bald head glistening with oil in the light of the hall.

"So, this fellow, Zhong Xia, is just like that, without the artifact, he can't be scary at all." said another warrior player.

"You're an idiot." retorted another person.
Here is the translation of the text:

"I didn't say anything wrong, he didn't have a divine artifact, nor did he have such a super equipment, nor was he like us with two eyes and a nose, nor did he have five revival stones."

The warrior player scowled and said, "So, you're saying you're wrong, right? You forgot about the summer festival god who killed hundreds of enemies and broke through the siege?"

"I'll give you a sword and let you slaughter five hundred pigs across the mountains and valleys, until your sword becomes dull, and you still can't complete a three-digit number."

"And don't even mention those who went on a night raid, they're all ruthless people who lick blood with their knives."

At this moment, the players who were standing together suddenly realized something.

The summer wizard in front of them did not have any divine artifacts, but he had achieved feats that no one else could match.

He had single-handedly defeated an entire team of raiders.

This kind of powerful individual could not be tolerated in the alliance.

At first, everyone thought it was due to a divine artifact, but now that they knew it was a single player, they would probably blow up the forum and the game's design.

"This kind of strength is too exaggerated, right? Arthur really can't balance things like this?"

One player couldn't help but sigh and look at Zhao Xu with a helpless expression.

"In general, a PVP game can only take on one or two people, and that's already strong enough. But he can take on hundreds of people?"

As the players reacted, Tang De patted Zhao Xu's shoulder with a big smile, "And now, I'll announce something else."

As he spoke, his voice rose, "Seeing the summer wizard perform so well, my heart's love just can't calm down."
Here is the translation of the text:

"I declare that as long as I remain in this position for a day, our alliance will spare no effort to help Mr. Zhongyue, who is about to descend to the world of Eid, obtain the divine artifact 'Sacred Breath'."

As Tangde spoke, he forcefully lifted Zhao Xu's hand.

Instantly, the guests in attendance, regardless of whether they were high-ranking officials or ordinary guards, applauded with gusto, as if they were infected by Tangde's personal charm at that moment.

Zhao Xu also revealed a joyful smile, as if he was very pleased with this arrangement.

However, he couldn't help but grumble inwardly, and indeed, Tangde was someone who couldn't be trifled with.

Devotees of the evil god Grazt, each one was incredibly cunning.

As a result, Tangde bound Zhao Xu, who knew the most about the artifact and had the most information, and kept him captive.

However, Zhao Xu didn't have a single moment of psychological burden.

He was also helpless, as if Freire had protected his information too well.

He had even kept his position as the head of the Wizard Association's Starfall Branch a secret.

If he were to "cooperate" to obtain the artifact, who could surpass the Wizard Association? Even Zhao Xu's intuition sensed Freire's subtle change in expression.

Deeply familiar with how to package an item, he smoothly sent his sister into Tangde's harem.

Tonight, Zhao Xu was a renowned figure, so he wanted to achieve something remarkable and let Zhao Xu experience his capabilities, which is why he sealed everything up.

As a result, Tangde's sudden move was immediately suppressed by an unpublished message.

At that moment, Freire's throat twitched, and he was about to leave to announce another identity of Zhao Xu.

Suddenly, a guard rushed in from behind, looking anxious, with sweat dripping from his forehead, wanting to approach Tangde privately.
Here is the translation of the text:

However, this sudden appearance was blocked by the personal bodyguards of the leader, Tang De.

"Tell me, what's going on?" Tang De waved his hand and said.

Just moments ago, Freyr had recommended coming to Zhong Xia, making Tang De's mood extremely upbeat, especially since he needed to get insider information on the interior of the Ai Zhu Palace from Zhao Xu.

This would allow him to smoothly complete his master's task.

"Ai Li's lady and Miss Fu Lei...,"

"What's going on?" Tang De suddenly raised an eyebrow, shouting loudly.

"They were originally staying in Ai Li's residence, waiting for the lady to help Miss Fu Lei put on a new makeup that had just arrived. But the lady and Miss Fu Lei suddenly disappeared, and it wasn't until our people outside discovered something amiss that we found out they were all gone."

"The servants and personal bodyguards inside the residence were all dead, with a row of bloodstains on the wall, saying it was the work of the notorious bandits, the Six Sisters."

As he spoke, he looked at Tang De, who was shocked and pale, with many people around him also turning white, even Freyr almost fainted.

Zhao Xu was also silent, unable to confirm whether Lady Ai Li and Miss Fu Lei had secretly endured such a calamity in their past.

If they didn't move quickly, this would become an indelible stain on Tang De's reputation.

The Six Sisters, known for being the most notorious thieves in the alliance, were six sisters who had joined forces to steal young girls.

Even after stealing them, their methods were extremely brutal, forcing them to engage in prostitution or slavery.

It was unclear what would happen if they were caught late, as even two people could be driven mad by torture.

At this moment, Zhao Xu also gripped the magical staff in his hand tightly.

The Six Sisters, what a cursed fate.
At that moment, a multitude of memories from the past suddenly flooded his mind. Unfortunately, Zhao Xu, who possessed a past-life memory, just so happened to know the location of the opponent's hidden lair.
