Chapter 100 Battle
Zhao Xu thought about it, but still moved behind the maple leaf honestly, with the maple leaf holding a shield in front of him, he could increase his concealment to some extent.
Before learning defensive spells such as arrow defense, he was still somewhat afraid of arrows on the battlefield.
"Ironstone, what do you mean?" At this time, Roya had already noticed the leader of the ambush here.
Ironstone was wearing heavy armor that was much more luxurious than theirs, riding a fine war horse and looking down on them from a distance.
Zhao Xu secretly thought that he knew him, no wonder the ambush was so unskilled, they didn't even plan to ambush the wanderers, it was almost like telling them with a flag.
"Roya, we fought together, put your things on the ground and leave. I'll consider you escaped," the warrior named Ironstone shouted loudly.
Although Zhao Xu thought the warrior was a rookie, the commander of the combat team, only those who had experienced the bloody life of a warrior could take on the role, and only they could command respect.
"Ironstone, do you think it's possible? How about this, I'll give you some supplies as a toll for passing through?" Roya looked at the surrounding circle of a hundred people that had slowly emerged, and already understood that this matter was unlikely to end well.
"Roya, I won't beat around the bush with you. Think about why we specifically came to this remote canyon to intercept you?" Ironstone said loudly, "This morning, the Merchant Alliance has already issued orders for the distribution of the position of the ninth elder and the positions of the lords of Caso and Butan, according to the merits of the siege! Give up."
Upon hearing these words, the entire merchant convoy knew that things were in trouble.
Here is the translation of the text:

Casso and Buntan, two cities, are situated at the foot of the Heavenly Ridge Mountains, and were once a crucial passage to Mistral. However, they have always been insignificant in the entire Northern Commercial Alliance.

The allocation of resources has also been unfair, which has become a catalyst for the two cities to secede. Unexpectedly, the Northern Commercial Alliance has not yet reached a disadvantaged position, and has instead given up greater benefits.

If the Northern Commercial Alliance had initially given the two cities a long-standing position, it's possible that the situation wouldn't have escalated to this point.

It's no wonder that the smugglers who have been secretly transporting goods to Casso and Buntan have become the sweet treats of the high-ranking officials within the Northern Commercial Alliance.

Luo Ya, the leader of the smugglers, had previously arranged for things to be taken care of within the alliance. Zhao Xu was unwilling to believe it.

However, the interests of the Northern Commercial Alliance and those of some high-ranking officials within the alliance are not entirely consistent. The alliance's high-stakes gamble has already turned the entire board over.

Can Isi still manipulate the situation and ascend to a higher position? Not to mention this time, three positions have been given up, and there's no fear of causing trouble.

As Luo Ya and Iron Stone continued to argue, Zhao Xu got off his horse and said, "Go back and kill Iron Stone first."

Maple Leaf looked at Iron Stone's full-body armor and shook his head, saying, "This iron shell is something we can't pierce through."
Iron Stone's full-body armor had a defensive power of 8 levels, while Zhao Xu's own mage armor spell was only 4 levels.
Here is the translation of the text:

This fully armored knight riding a horse, covered from head to toe in armor, has always been a formidable force in the era of cold weapons. Without special tactics or the intervention of powerful warriors or mages, ordinary people would find it difficult to handle.

"Don't worry, I'm a spellcaster, and I can handle it," Zhao Xu said, arranging the matter.

Arthur, who valued personal bravery, was someone who would not back down even if he was outmatched, but his own combat power was not high, making it difficult for him to take the position of commander-in-chief.

In battle, these leaders were also the most vulnerable targets. As long as they could be quickly eliminated, the psychological pressure on the team would be immense.

Including themselves, once Li Ao died, no one would step forward to take charge, and the entire escort team of about 50 people would be defeated.

At this time, Li Ao seemed to have already lost his composure, and the enemy suddenly let out a loud shout and began to charge towards them.

At the same time, many warriors hiding in the depths of the valley, armed with simple weapons, charged towards them. Only a few held bows and arrows, firing from a distance.

"Look out for yourself," Maple Leaf said, handing a round shield to You You, while he himself held a tower shield in front of them.

The poet began to sing a war song in a hurry, while the wandering rainbow, carrying a dagger, patrolled around them, prepared to fend off any approaching enemies.

At this moment, You You, as a kind priest, also raised his hand bow and began to fire at the enemy from a distance.

In the distance, Li Ao and his few loyal followers charged towards the enemy.

Although they had charged forward, it seemed that Iron Stone and his armor, as well as the shield, were not very effective. Zhao Xu's team was at a disadvantage, and before long, four or five warriors wearing leather armor had already broken into the defensive circle, holding swords and charging towards them.

Warrior Maple Leaf let out a loud shout and held up his shield, trying to deflect the opponent.
Here is the translation of the text:

Yu Yu shot at the monster but not at living people, and then bit her teeth and pulled the trigger, aiming at several people and shooting away. However, she didn't have any magical assistance and her agility wasn't high enough, so the arrow directly brushed against the warriors' shoulders, drawing their attention to Yu Yu and causing them to change direction and charge towards her.

Shan Ye, the sword-wielding warrior, hastily abandoned his shield and drew his sword, attempting to pursue the several warriors.

Zhao Xu was holding a colorful powder in his hand and shouted at Shan Ye, "Scram!" Then he threw the powder in the air and chanted a spell, "Seven-colored shower."

A seven-colored rainbow shot out, covering a 5-meter radius and enveloping the warriors who were charging forward. The warriors who were hit by the rainbow were paralyzed and fell to the ground, unconscious.

The warriors who were slower in running saw their comrades' tragic fate and were shocked, stumbling and falling to the ground. However, one of them still managed to shout, "Run, there's a mage here!"

Zhao Xu's teammates were taken aback by his sudden display of power. "Don't be stunned, quickly take care of these few," Zhao Xu yelled.

Just then, the mobile support team, the wandering warrior, rushed over and asked, "How do you plan to take care of them?"

Zhao Xu looked at the rainbow and said, "Knock them out, and then tie them up."

His magical abilities could only control these 1st-level warriors for a few rounds, just like the night demon used a seven-colored shower to knock down a group of warriors.
Here is the translation of the text:

Hearing that it's not a one-hit solution, the rainbow relaxed its breath, quickly pairing up with the poet who had just arrived. Meanwhile, Zhao Xu continued to gaze at the battlefield ahead.

These top-tier warriors, none of whom had passed the "Will Immunity" test through magic, were all knocked down by a single "Seven-Colored Spraying" attack. Zhao Xu wasn't surprised.

As warriors, they didn't have the same level of will immunity as mages, let alone those without innate talent to become warriors, whose physical attributes were already quite average, equivalent to a starting point with only 8 talent points. Only by killing many monsters could they begin to feel the gap between ordinary civilians or warriors and themselves, who were standard adventurers.

First-level mages are weak, but that's only relative to other ten core professions.
