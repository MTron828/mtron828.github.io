Chapter 511: Meeting a Stranger on the Road, Descending into the Secret Silver Mine

As Serus had transformed into a complete, gigantic white dragon, he was still caught off guard by Zhao Xu's sudden shoulder throw, and he collapsed to the ground like a limp snake.

Annie also shook her head, saying, "What kind of confidence do you have, a 27-power white dragon, compared to an adventurer with over 40 points of strength?"

Despite this, Serus still retained the pride of the dragon clan.

This time, after being knocked to the ground by Zhao Xu, Serus felt his face burning with shame, and he simply lay there, not even bothering to lift his head.

It wasn't until Zhao Xu's group was ready to set off again that Serus slowly got up, licking his face as if nothing was wrong.

He pretended to be nonchalant and walked to the driver's position in front of the carriage, but was soon forced by Annie to sign a 10-year service contract.

After a night of rest and repair, the wind and snow had subsided significantly, and soon Zhao Xu's group arrived at the gate of the Star-Falling Town.

In contrast to the last time they arrived at the city gate, which was met with difficulties, today Zhao Xu could see that the gate was guarded by more robust and spirited guards, and he also spotted an old acquaintance of his.

"Did you notify the teacher?" Zhao Xu turned to ask.

"I'm not as stupid as you are," Annie replied. "It's like a fly without a head, just crashing into a big vat of dye."

Annie lectured, "Although you now possess power and resources, you still need to face the relationship between the 'strong dragons' and the 'head of the snake'."

"With the help of this bishop, many things will be different,"

As An Xin Yao spoke, he couldn't help but knock on Zhao Xu's head, but by the second time, his strength had dwindled to almost nothing, and it was like he was caressing him. "Never underestimate the significance of faith for the people of Arthur, especially."

"When the Star Lake Battle occurred, if it weren't for the magic goddess's will, bestowing powerful magic, do you think the miners who came to ask for help from the Frost Giant Army would have given up so easily?"

"For players, faith may be a prerequisite for the priest profession, and for the people of Arthur, it's the ultimate destination after death."

Zhao Xu finally realized that he had underestimated himself.

Sometimes, some coincidences that happen may not be discovered until later.

However, he got off the carriage and came to the city gate to greet the Archbishop of the Order of the Holy Cross, shaking his hand and offering his respects.

"Archbishop of the Order of the Holy Cross, it's been a long time since we've met. I was thinking of visiting you as soon as I finished this task," Zhao Xu said enthusiastically.

The Archbishop of the Order of the Holy Cross chuckled and said, "But I dare not, though, since you're a priest, you do need to register at my church."

Zhao Xu slapped his forehead, feeling embarrassed. He almost forgot that he was still a level 1 priest.

"Sorry," Zhao Xu apologized.

"Please, don't apologize," the Archbishop replied with a smile. "The goddess won't mind."

After that, Zhao Xu noticed that, aside from the players who had gathered to watch the commotion, there were several people standing behind the Archbishop, including people he recognized.

"Long time no see," Zhao Xu said, seeing Wang Qing Wei, whom he had spoken to over the phone just last night, and couldn't help but extend his hand.

"How did you also come to join in on the fun?"

As it turned out, the place where they were staying wasn't even finished yet, and since you're coming, why not come take a look? At that moment, the two of them couldn't help but laugh about the phone call they had yesterday.

Wang Congwei pointed to the girl behind her, saying, "This is Yu'er, a player I met on the road. She came to Starfall Town because of a prophecy and got stuck here. But after she got here, the clues disappeared, so I let her follow me."

Wang Congwei's smile was sweet and genuine, clearly happy to help Zheng Xin'ao and making her extremely delighted.

"Xiaoyue," Zheng Xin'ao said, covering her mouth in surprise.

"Wow, it's really this big shot," she said.

"You're crazy, it's definitely him," Wang Congwei added.

"The Pope of Winter Cathedral, appointed by the Goddess, is like the Goddess's will in this region."

"It'll be lively in Starfall Town," she said.

When the players standing near the entrance heard this, they finally confirmed the identity of the man in front of them.

But the real excitement and curiosity was still about whether Xiaoyue was as powerful as the legend claimed, and what kind of impact he would have on the town.

Just then, Xiaoyue, the game's number one player, also looked familiar, having met Wang Congwei during his time at the Goddess's Church.

"If we've met before, there's no harm in coming along," he said.

Big Chief Sozi saw that there were already a few people gathered around and suggested, "Let's go to the central area, not far from the village entrance, where there are numerous mines."

After Xiaoyue agreed, the group set off together.
Here is the translation of the text:

It was winter, but the miners were still working tirelessly at the mine entrance. The pay was generous, just like in the past, and the workers' wages were rising. However, Zhao Xiu's gaze fell upon the bishop, and he couldn't help but turn back to look at him. "No mistake, these rough-looking people are just like you, fellow players," the bishop said, sighing. "Although I don't know where you players truly belong, it's clear that the mine is giving out too much." "It's crushing the players' last straw," he added. Zhao Xiu felt a sense of empathy.

Clearly, these players must have been digging a hole all day and would be embarrassed to admit it, and might even be ridiculed by others. "Summer, this is your mine, and the person in charge is here. Let's go down together," the bishop said. "Wow?" White Dragon Sirel, who had been drooling in the corner, finally couldn't help but exclaim, "Is it the pure silver mine?" Meanwhile, the person in charge of the mine area, who had been quiet until then, nodded at the group. At the same time, the bishop handed over a document, saying, "This is a mine that was previously managed by the church and belongs to the Association of Mages. Now, it's being transferred to you, and you can go down with the person in charge to take a look." Zhao Xiu immediately took the two sheepskin papers, which were sealed with a golden stamp, with clear and neat handwriting detailing the ownership rights of the mine.
Here is the translation of the text:

At this moment, Zhao Xu also remembered the mine that belonged to the Wizard Association, which produced four-fifths of its own products, and the rest was handed over. "I've never been to the secret silver mine before," he said.

King Wei, who was standing beside him, couldn't help but look forward to it, and Zheng Xin'an's eyes also lit up for this journey.

Zhao Xu suddenly realized that he was like taking a group of friends to see a gold mine on Earth, and others would definitely be full of expectations.

He glanced back at the group, his gaze sweeping over Anniya, King Wei, Zheng Xin'an, and Veve, and suddenly felt a headache.

At this moment, the manager of the mine area couldn't help but say, "Well, shall we go together?"
"Yes," Zhao Xu nodded, and also asked, "Has anything strange happened recently?"
"Strange?" The mine area manager muttered to himself, "There are no big problems generally."
"However, something strange has indeed happened in the mine area recently."
