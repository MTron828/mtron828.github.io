Chapter 501: The Sword Points to the Lair

"Are you?" Suddenly, one of the two sisters, who had just taken a closer look, recognized him through Zhao Xu's voice as to who he was.

"A sister, do you recognize me?" Saint Warrior didn't connect the dropped carriage in the deep pit and the man in front of him yet, and he was equally stunned.

"It seems you've recognized me, Miss Ran Nu," Zhao Xu said with a wide smile, although he hadn't thought it would be so coincidental.

The siblings standing in front of him were, surprisingly, Shen Nian and Shen Ze, who he had known in his past life. Before the Star-Falling Lake War, he had met Shen Nian, who was a mage, at a street stall in Winter City.

At that time, Zhao Xu had effortlessly identified a bronze lion statue worth over 10,000 gold coins on the stall and gave it to Shen Nian to keep for her brother.

"Brother, that's the mage who helped us choose the bronze mount for you," Shen Nian exclaimed, shaking her brother's arm excitedly.

Shen Ze, who had been looking at Zhao Xu with a puzzled expression, suddenly opened his eyes wide. "So it's you," he said.

He then stretched out his strong and powerful arm and tightly gripped Zhao Xu's hand. "According to the market's rules, you helped us choose this magical item, so we should compensate you. However, my sister didn't understand the situation at the time and didn't get in touch with you."

Zhao Xu directly waved his hand, saying, "No, it's just a coincidence."

Shen Nian saw her brother looking a bit dazed and quickly interrupted, "Let me introduce you to my brother. He's a 4th-level Saint Warrior, Winter City's Public Defender and Punisher, and a member of the Holy Guardian Knights."
Here is the translation of the text:

"I, Ran Yi, a winter city mage, am also a 4th-level mage," Shen Nian said with a smile, very radiant.

Zhao Xu at this time couldn't help but take a moment to observe Shen Nian closely. As the Shen family siblings, who are famous throughout the winter city, their current level is far above average. It's not surprising.

However, Zhao Xu didn't expect that Shen Nian, a mage among mages, would actually reach the 4th level so smoothly.

However, it's worth noting that mages have a hidden difficulty.

They can only cast high-level spells when they reach a certain level. For example, a 3rd-level mage can cast a 2-ring spell, but a mage has to wait until they reach the 4th level to cast it, which is a significant delay.

"Ah, that good-hearted sir, who are you?" Shen Nian asked.

"I'm Zhong Xia," Zhao Xu replied simply.

At present, he has already become a master of only saying one name in the game.

Even poets can use "Idle Knowledge" to search for this ID and obtain some information.

Instantly, Shen Nian and his siblings, who are considered high-level players in the winter city, all stared at Zhao Xu with their mouths agape.

It's as if they couldn't believe that the good-hearted person from before had become a hidden BOSS.

The ID "Zhong Xia" may be just an ordinary name outside the game.

But within the game, this short name has accumulated an endless storm of energy in just a short time.

Even a pedestrian player, let alone a player who just wants to play the game and enjoy the scenery, will know that "Zhong Xia" is currently the number one player in the game.

A player who has left the second-place player two levels behind.

Even on Baidu and some online forums, the analysis of this name has reached an unimaginable number.
Here is the translation of the text:

Some people directly search for users with the same ID on other websites, trying to find the true identity of the player named Zhong Xia, also known as Zhong Xia.

Sometimes, not being in the same circle, it's like a blade of grass that's easily overlooked.

However, among the top-notch individuals in the same circle, there is a sense of "shocking" that is like a thunderbolt.

Zhao Xu, who has always felt inferior and was often bullied by An Niya, was embarrassed to see his familiar gaze. Shen Ze held his hand tightly, as if he was moved to excitement.

However, Zhao Xu, who has relied on the power of the "Decline Domain" to increase his magic level and strength, is now invincible against Shen Ze's attacks.

As the current top-ranked player, Zhao Xu is also a little ashamed that he couldn't play as a melee player.

"I'm sorry," Shen Ze finally reacted, releasing his grip on Zhao Xu's hand.

The Shen siblings, curious about Zhao Xu, asked him many questions. In reality, they didn't want to touch on Zhao Xu's level secrets, but asked about other aspects instead.

However, Zhao Xu's secrets were too many to explain, and his level grew wildly without revealing too many secrets.

Zhao Xu also learned that Shen Ze had risked his life to investigate the series of disappearances, traveling from the Winter City to the Aurora City, following the clues.
Here is the translation:

Zhao Xu couldn't help but wonder, "The Holy Guardian Knights wouldn't let you come here alone, would they?" Shen Ze, however, looked somewhat dejected, "It's mainly because there's no lead, and the priority hasn't been determined yet. So, our team was assigned to take charge of this investigation, and we've been divided to expedite the process."

Zhao Xu finally realized and remembered that Shen Ze had also gone to investigate the slave trade in the town of Starfall before. "Have you found any leads?" he asked.

"I've heard that there's a secret base on the Ice Mountain Range," Shen Ze said hesitantly, "I suspect it's located there."

"Who?" Zhao Xu asked.

"The Six Sisters," Shen Ze said, looking troubled. "Our knights have been tracking the Six Sisters for many years, but they've always managed to evade capture. My sister suspects that they're hiding in the Ice Mountain Range, but the main routes are heavily guarded, and it's impossible for them to transport a large number of slaves without being detected."

"So, our small team will split up to monitor several difficult-to-traverse paths to observe whether the Six Sisters have any special climbing methods," Shen Ze added.

Zhao Xu suddenly understood and realized that Shen Ze's seemingly accidental discovery was actually a critical find.

Even according to the opponent's given time nodes, the Six Sisters' raid on Furee and Elric's wives was shorter than expected.

It seemed like an urgent order, as if they were suddenly given a command.

Zhao Xu's entire being became calm, and he thought to himself about the new information provided by the Shen siblings.

In theory, they should have reported this information to the alliance immediately. This person should have received this firsthand information.
Here is the translation of the text:

But he didn't receive it, as if someone had forcibly interrupted a crucial part of the message.

Just as Zhao Xu had passed through the city of Orlo, he realized that he needed to "take advantage of the situation" to escape.

He feigned death and fled.

He then got on a horse-drawn carriage, and in truth, he saw the bright lights in the black night, attracting the attention of various powers.

"Yes, I'm also going to look for the Six Sisters now," Zhao Xu said, casually revealing this rescue event to the two of them.

At this moment, Shen Nian and Shen Ze both frowned, clearly realizing the enormous crisis hidden behind the scene.

"I need your help," Zhao Xu said in a low voice.

Reacting to the possibility that the Six Sisters might have a secret base on the Ice Mountain Range, where they were detaining many hostages and even slaves, Zhao Xu had realized that this was not just a matter of personal heroism, where he could simply rescue Fuli and Lady Aili on his own.

Without external help, the people who had been kidnapped would all be frozen to death on their way down the mountain.

"However, Uncle Zhongxiao," Shen Nian asked, "doesn't it make more sense to seek help from the official authorities?"

Zhao Xu smiled and shook his head, but Shen Nian was still naive and believed in the official storyline from the game.

"I'm actually trying to avoid them," Zhao Xu said. "It's not just a matter of high-ranking officials; the entire information network is compromised, and there are even forces that oppose me rescuing people, hoping that Fuli and Lady Aili will die in their hands."
Here is the translation:

As he spoke, he gazed at Shen Ze, "If the Northern Alliance has something most reliable, I think it's the knight order under the patronage of the God of Justice, and I'm sure it's among the top three."

Suddenly, Shen Ze's face turned red as if a surge of hot blood had risen to his heart. He immediately placed the hilt of his long sword against his chest, saying, "Honor is my life, justice is my soul."

Zhao Xu nodded silently and drew a rough map of the Ice Mountain Range on the ice beneath him. He then entrusted Shen Ze and Shen Nian to take care of the matter.

The Saint Warrior's greatest strength is their independence from government agencies, similar to the existence of "prosecutorial offices" and "courts." Each Saint Warrior is like an independent prosecutor, with enough power to mobilize the entire knight order's strength.

It was only a suspicion stage before, but after Zhao Xu provided conclusive evidence, many things became clear.

"Brother, how did you know the hideout of the Six Sisters?" Shen Nian asked, her eyes filled with bewilderment, as if Zhao Xu was one of the Six Sisters.

At that moment, Zhao Xu let out a small breath and gazed at the ice sculpture door without speaking.

However, his thoughts had already drifted back to his past life.

He recalled the time he followed a woman to the Ice Mountain Range and discovered the truth, only to part ways with her afterwards.

"Ah, yes," Zhao Xu suddenly remembered something he had always wanted to ask but was afraid to ask, fearing that Shen Ze would kill him on the spot.

Shen Ze slapped his chest, eagerly awaiting Zhao Xu's question.

Zhao Xu flashed a white smile, his eyes gleaming with mischievous intent as he asked, "Are you a sister complex?"
