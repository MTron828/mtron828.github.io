Chapter 534: The Lord's Promise

In the end, Anniya still refused to accept the advice of the former coach, Old Master Matthias, and decided to leave as usual.

This also cast a subtle shadow over Zhao Xu's mind.

He realized that the abilities he had obtained so far were impressive, but were still far from being truly invincible in the eyes of a true strong person.

Even he, who wanted to reach the "bottomless abyss" or "Bart's Hell", had no spells to utilize.

Therefore, Zhao Xu continued to stay in the wooden tower after attending the "Union Meeting", the highest authority in the small town, and spent his time reading books on spell theories and constantly thinking about the secrets of the Five Rings.

Using the experience from the previous patrol, he combined with the actions of the scoundrels who conspired against him.

As someone without "administrative power" but with the title of Lord, Zhao Xu made a breakthrough in the power hierarchy of the small town for the first time, turning the entire patrol into the Zhao family army.

This also made people who wanted to take the easy route start to get excited and occasionally visit the area to pay their respects.

Many people who had initially come to watch the spectacle were prepared to laugh at Zhao Xu's lack of talent.

After all, players cannot be online 24/7, and sometimes they are busy and cannot guarantee being online for an hour a day.

Before the national university entrance examination month, many players left the game, and the memory of it is still vivid.

However, Zhao Xu may be unfamiliar with other departments, but for the patrol team that has been fighting and struggling since the cross-time era, he is completely familiar.
Here is the translation of the text:

Who is being oppressed, who is in conflict with whom, and who is unable to take the lead - he is well aware of all this.

Therefore, after he reappointed the magistrate and handed over a new list to the opponent,

the whole town of Zhuan Xing was pacified, with not even a ripple on the surface.

Zhao Xu continued to focus on enhancing his strength, as usual.

As far as mages are concerned, each ring corresponds to a floor, and mages are like those who have been blindfolded, relying on their own strength to feel their way up the stairs.

Some people may stumble upon the corresponding stairs directly.

Those with bad luck may have to explore half the floors before finding the entrance.

Zhao Xu is one of those lucky ones who can take the elevator straight to the fourth floor.

However, he is now afraid that if he continues to slack off, he will be overwhelmed by the more challenging floors ahead.

Therefore, he is more cautious in his approach to these magical principles, thinking carefully about each step.

Just then, the city gate's beacon tower suddenly rang out with a rapid drumbeat.

The rhythm made Zhao Xu realize that it was a signal indicating a large number of deaths.

Zhao Xu sprang up from the wooden tower, gazing out at the city gate. He saw that the area had already been set ablaze.

This is a signal indicating a siege.

Realizing the gravity of the situation, Zhao Xu quickly stuffed the magical manual into his backpack and leaped down from the tower, triggering the "Feather Falling" technique to ensure a safe landing.

Onlookers were left agog.

"Vivian, you're here, watching; Serus, come with me to see what's going on," Zhao Xu shouted.

He then cast the "Shadow Steed" technique, which consists of three rings of magic.
Here is the translation of the text:

A massive, half-realistic horse-like creature suddenly appears beneath him, with four horse hooves that are as elusive as smoke. Zhao Xiaoyu holds the reins and pulls them, and the phantom horse also activates the "flight" ability brought by the 14th-level spellcaster, reaching a speed of 8 times that of a human, like a mad dash away.

Since White Dragon Serus had once helped Zhao Xiaoyu in the Starfall Town, a legend spread that the town leader could tame giant dragons. Although White Dragon Serus, who had grown to adulthood, had already possessed the ability to exert "dragon power" and was connected to the giant dragon, he, as a law enforcement officer, would not show mercy.

However, Zhao Xiaoyu being able to tame a giant dragon means more. Even the law enforcement officers should have magical pets, but none have been seen in Zhao Xiaoyu's case. This has made people suspect the possibility of White Dragon Serus.

Many people immediately reevaluated their relationship with Zhao Xiaoyu, which also facilitated the smooth progress of his personal reforms.

Satisfied with the effect, Zhao Xiaoyu did not hesitate to give White Dragon Serus a "salary" and let him work harder.

After a while, Zhao Xiaoyu and White Dragon Serus arrived at the city gate, where they saw a militiaman in simple armor crying loudly.

Zhao Xiaoyu immediately realized what was happening.

The recent snow and ice had melted and were slowly disappearing, and spring planting was about to begin. Therefore, the newly appointed town chief, Lu Qi, had asked him for advice and organized a group of outstanding young men in the town to go through a training session before spring planting, which was a form of labor tax. Alternatively, these militiamen who were not part of the police department's roster would also organize two training sessions before spring planting and after harvest, to maintain their basic combat effectiveness.
Here is the translation of the text:

They are also the "reserve force" of King Arthur's version.

The daily town security, city defense, and mine security don't need this batch of people.

They are ordinary farmers and craftsmen, but when crisis strikes, they become the last line of defense when winter arrives and timely help from the city is unavailable.

The militia training process is also a selection of talents.

In the past, the Black Dragon attack on Star Town, except for killing Zhao Xun's family, it also exhausted the militia team set up by the town temporarily. Within a month, there were over a hundred households that held funerals.

At this time, looking at the militiaman with a somewhat haggard face and worn-out clothes, Zhao Xun suddenly realized something was off.

Something had happened, and it was just him.

At this moment, many big shots in the town had already arrived.

"What's going on?" the town chief asked urgently, and his grandson had also joined the militia.

However, the militiaman who had just been drafted into the team looked at these big shots who would normally come to his home for a feast, and his heart became even more tense. He burst into tears on the spot.

"Why are you crying?" the accountant with a beard like a goat asked angrily, his daughter was about to marry the town chief's grandson, and he never thought that something like this would happen.

However, his questioning only elicited even louder and more intense crying.

Thinking about the urgency of the situation, the blacksmith who had just arrived saw the angry eyes of the big shots and almost raised his hand with the hammer to hit himself.
Here is the translation of the text:

Only the mother of the young boy, wrapped in a thick layer of animal hide to prevent burns from the furnace, tightly hugged her crying child, trying to comfort him, but couldn't hold back her own emotions.

"Stay calm and composed!"

Zhao Xu shook his head and waved his staff, casting the second-ring spell.

Instantly, the people within a six-meter radius of him, including the boy, felt a calming and soothing power emanating from him. The turbulent emotions inside them began to subside, and the thoughts of rebuking the boy and the sound of his crying slowly weakened.

"This is indeed the magic of the gods?" someone exclaimed. "How can it be so miraculous?"

"Not surprisingly, it's the leader, or rather, the elder," someone else said.

"I've never felt so at ease and relaxed inside myself," someone else sighed, even closing their eyes as if savoring the feeling.

Zhao Xu's ears automatically filtered out most of the chatter.

The "Stay calm and composed" spell was originally intended to suppress the emotional state, such as negating blessings, poetical incantations, and barbarian outbursts.

The unintended side effect was the calm and peaceful atmosphere.

The boy, who was still crying, began to say, "Today, Commander Lu Qi led us to go to the wilderness for training, to verify our physical abilities and teamwork. We were on the way to the Mawang Gorge when..."

As he spoke, the boy's eyes widened in terror, and he choked back a sob, "And then, suddenly, a group of monsters appeared. They looked a bit like dragons, flapping their wings, but with three heads and spewing out various mysterious energies, including toxic gas and lightning and fire."
Here is the translation of the text:

"Protecting our Lu Qi's officers and the six or seven coaches, they all fainted suddenly, and then these monsters took away my companions. At that time, I was caught and almost got killed by the pit trap set by Lu Qi's officer, but I managed to escape by hiding in the pit."

"...three heads?" The officials of the small town suddenly turned pale.

"Chimera, a level 7 monster," Zhao Xu explained.

"What are we going to do?" one of the parents of a missing militiaman exclaimed, wailing.

Zhao Xu recognized the other as a clerk from the Political Bureau, but didn't expect that he had secretly inserted his own child into the militiaman team.

It seemed that everyone was certain that he would soon launch a large-scale purge of the town's power structure.

After all, filling the position would certainly require someone, and at that time, he would naturally choose someone from his own family's militiamen system.

These more informed families had already begun to exert their own influence.

This was the helpless situation for those who were single-handedly ruling the town.

Because no matter how they tried to replace personnel, they would all find that anyone they promoted would have various relatives connected to them.

However, with the backup of the Earth-crossing people in the future, Zhao Xu didn't care about this.

But as the one who dominated the entire public security system, he didn't expect that the officer he had just promoted, Lu Qi, would suddenly go missing.

Even among the missing militiamen, those who could be listed on the roster were all of some influence.

If they all died, it would be enough to shake the town of Starfall, and would directly affect his prestige.

It was equivalent to slapping him in the face.

"Leader, please save my child," the secretary of the town leader suddenly rushed over, bowing and begging, "My wife is waiting for my son to get married, and I'm just holding on to hope. If he gets hurt, our whole family will be ruined."
Here is the translation of the text:

"Yes, noble leader, please," another mother said, even kneeling down directly in front of him.

Zhao Xuan also hastily signaled for someone to help lift the other party up.

It's undeniable that, with him in charge of the entire public security department, the public security team has basically become his direct subordinate, and he can give orders with just one word, without needing to go through the public security officer to achieve his goals.

After all, he is the "final boss" who holds the fate of these people in his hands.

"How did you run so far on the first day?" Zhao Xuan asked.

At this point, Kasi, who was responsible for the public security team's documentation, looked embarrassed and said, "It's because Vice Director Qingchou suggested we adopt their 'Breaking the Ice' training method, using teamwork to eliminate everyone's sense of alienation, so we arranged a trial run."

"Who would have thought that this relatively short distance would suddenly encounter such a powerful monster like Chimera?" Kasi said, his face twisted in distress. One of the militiamen was also his nephew, and at this point, he didn't know how to face his sister.

Zhao Xuan's face also turned red with embarrassment, as Lin Qingchou, who was his direct subordinate in his previous life, was also a powerful warrior.

Although the other party's upgrade speed was quite fast, they had unfortunately used up the five revival stones within the past few months and had to start anew, so although their level was not much different from Zhao Xuan's, their background was not strong enough, so they were still subordinate to him.

This time, Zhao Xuan knew that the other party was a reliable person, so he gave him the position of vice director of public security. However, he didn't expect things to turn out this way.

"Where is he?" Zhao Xuan asked.

"He has already gone out to look for him," Kasi replied.

Zhao Xuan nodded, and then decided to go out alone to confront the group of single-body creatures, each with a level of 7, which was indeed brave. He also managed to protect the other party.
Here is the translation of the text:

However, after Zhao Xu appeared, everyone was basically just looking at him, waiting for him to take the lead.

Power and responsibility corresponded, and he could summon a group of underlings. Naturally, when something happened, these underlings would have to look at his face.

"Qiasi, first send a batch of brothers who are quick to react and have experience in tracking, to the Tiger Valley."

"Lord, these Chimera will fly, and it's probably hard to track them," Qiasi said, wringing his hands. "Not to mention that we've never heard of any Chimera nests nearby."

When the group heard this, they all had a moment of realization, and to some extent, they became aware that the militiamen who had been taken away were in a precarious situation.

The flying creatures would leave no trace on the ground that could be tracked.

"This is like a murder on snow, leaving no footprints," he said.

"I'm not asking them to find the Chimera, but rather to see if there are any similar cases where children have been taken away and are still alive," Zhao Xu said.

As soon as he finished speaking, a mother burst into tears: "Lord, what about our children?"

These are your children, not ours.

Zhao Xu corrected himself silently.

"Don't worry, I'll personally go find the Chimera's nest," he said.

However, Qiasi was worried that Zhao Xu was wasting his time, wringing his hands and saying, "There's no record of Chimera appearing in our town before."

He had been reviewing the records since he took office yesterday, so he was very clear about it.

However, Zhao Xu just shook his head. "Think about why they took away these militiamen. Is it just to raise them as livestock?"

Qiasi shook his head in response.

"It's because they have a nest, so they need to take them back and raise them as livestock," Zhao Xu explained.

As soon as he finished speaking, the parents of several militiamen burst into tears.
"Don't cry, I'll bring them back home."
Zhou Xu said that and tugged on the reins of the demon steed, "As long as they're alive, none will be left out."
"This is a lord's promise."
