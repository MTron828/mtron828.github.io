Chapter 547: Instant Teleportation, Death Wave

At this moment, Zhao Xu was about to cast those designated spells on himself, followed by the "Magic Stabilization Spell". Suddenly, he felt a bit awkward.

He shook his head, saying, "This is indeed a bit excessive."

This made Wang Qingwei laugh and push him away, saying, "Don't pretend, Zhongxia Wizard, hurry up and cast the spell so I can see the effect."

"Okay, here it goes."

Zhao Xu's expression became more resolute, and he looked down at his hands, with the memories of innate spellcasting skills emerging.

Detection Magic! (Level 0, 9th level, detects 20-meter radius magical aura)
Understand Language! (Level 1, 9th level, understands and reads text information)
Dark Vision! (Level 2, 10th level, gains 20-meter radius dark vision)
Uncover Concealment! (Level 2, 10th level, uncovers hidden creatures within a 20-meter radius)
Secret Vision! (Level 3, 11th level, gains 40-meter radius magical vision)
Cunning Speech! (Level 3, 11th level, understands and converses with any intelligent being)

As the spellcaster's level exceeded 30, the magical aura condensed into Zhao Xu's entire body, forming a six-ring aura.

After casting the first type of spell that could only be cast on himself, Zhao Xu used the remaining five empty spell slots to recast these spells in order, followed by the "Magic Stabilization Spell".

Simultaneously, Zhao Xu activated his "Supernatural Spellcasting" ability, and suddenly the complex spellcasting actions, including "incantations", "postures", and "materials", were no longer required.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu lifted his hand lightly and activated the "Mystic Silence" and "Mystic Fixation" spells, without any hindrance. Instantly, he noticed that the "Detection Magic" spell, which had a 3-level duration, had changed to "permanent" in the next second.

Although these spells were just ordinary auxiliary spells, without any significant meaning like "Quick Explosion" or "Chilling Touch", Zhao Xu, who already possessed the professional skill "Secret Vision", felt that the permanent duration was a significant gain.

However, Zhao Xu didn't seem to be satisfied with the gain. He thought to himself that as long as he didn't let others dispel these "Constant" spells, it would be fine.

But Zhao Xu wasn't worried about it. If others dispelled the spells, he would only waste a few seconds of his life force.

After a moment, Zhao Xu used his residual energy to recover his five-ring magical ability and his daily limit of supernatural magical ability.

Suddenly, everything on his body was restored to its original state, perfect and new.

King Qingwei smiled slightly and said, "I'm starting to feel the terror of your unlimited endurance."

"Originally, warrior players who rely on long-term battles would use up all their magical abilities to chase down a powerful mage after controlling the spell transmission escape."

"Even using a fatigue battle to make the opponent unable to rest, and eventually unable to recover their magical abilities for the next day."

King Qingwei shook her head and said, "But now, you've also plugged this shortcoming."

"Right," Zhao Xu replied.

Zhao Xu was also a little sentimental at this moment.
Here is the translation:

In the past, many people on the forum criticized the position of using magic spells, saying that those who couldn't even prepare spells didn't deserve to be called mages. Even if they had combat strength, it was still a worthless concept that was often heard. Players who were poisoned by this kind of talk were not a minority. As a result, the number of mage players, especially those who reached the 5th level of spellcasting, decreased significantly.

Zhou Xiu, a powerful mage, didn't come out to challenge this situation. That's why Zhao Xu decided to create an account called "Dong Cheng Yi" to come out and challenge the situation.

The next moment, Zhao Xu turned back and looked at the second type of spell that could be cast on companions, and suddenly felt a bit exhausted.

He also didn't expect that mechanically giving himself permanent buffs was a mentally exhausting task.

Higher Magic Fang! (Three-ring, 11th level, +5 attack and damage increase when selecting the fist)

Enhance Resistance! (Zero-ring, 9th level, increase resistance by 1 level)

This time, Zhao Xu's choices were limited, especially since his big sage robe had already covered his resistance.

As for the two spells, "Human Shrinking" and "Human Enlargement", Zhao Xu didn't need to use them temporarily.

However, he found another option to cast on someone else, "Mind Link", which he thought was quite impressive, equivalent to real-time voice communication.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

As for the third type, which is a spell that is cast on an object or area, such as a magic alarm, object activation, dance light spell, illusion sound spell, wind spell, invisibility spell, mage's secret room, magical mouth, dimensional portal, rainbow magic ball, rainbow magic wall, size reduction spell, fog spell, stench spell, death mark, fear mark, madness mark, pain mark, persuasion mark, sleep mark, intimidation mark, weakness mark, and teleportation magic array.

Zhao Xiu then selected "mage's secret room" and a few mark spells to add to his increasingly secret room.

Even recently, Vivian and White Dragon Serus were arranged by Zhao Xiu to take turns staying here, 24 hours a day, to monitor it.

At this time, Wang Qianwei looked at Zhao Xiu's smile and couldn't help but wonder, "Zhao Xiu, what are you laughing about?"

"I'm just looking at these constant spells and thinking about how to arrange my underground labyrinth in the future," he replied.

"It will be very interesting to put these constant spells in place, and I can make the adventurers who break in have a good time."

Wang Qianwei looked at Zhao Xiu's serious face and said, "What time is it now? Are you still thinking about playing, Mr. Zhao?"

Originally, Wang Qianwei and Zhao Xiu were on good terms, and Wang Qianwei began to show a hint of anxiety at this critical moment.

Ultimately, her one mistake in decision-making could lead to the death of countless people.

Zhao Xiu also noticed Wang Qianwei's inner tension.

It was because he had experienced past-life reincarnation that he could maintain his composure.

Because he would not be worse than in his past life.

Now, every effort he makes is to rescue a life.

"Qianwei, we'll discuss the remaining things privately before I go to bed tonight. I'll leave for half a day, and I'll leave the town to you," Zhao Xiu said.

As he spoke, Zhao Xiu's whole body began to fade away, and the transmission light gradually brightened.

...The five-ring transmission spell is limited in its transmission distance compared to the seven-ring high-level transmission, and it can reach every corner of the Arthurian material plane.

However, in Zhao Xu's hands, the coverage range of 5,000 kilometers is just a trivial matter in the vast territory of King Arthur. But Zhao Xu's unlimited recovery spellcasting ability and the ability to transmit information instantly make any information that reaches him no longer a secret. Instantly traversing the heavens and the earth, this is the romance of mages.

Before becoming a "Magic Guardian", Zhao Xu underwent a "exam" under the name of the goddess of magic, Silviana, in a nominal sense.

After that, he became a member of the Mistral Magic Guardian Organization.

Although a Magic Guardian at the 1st level has the ability to perform "boundary synchronization" and "marking" identity marks, these identity marks do not have actual abilities. However, Zhao Xu, who is not on duty in Mistral, theoretically becomes a former Magic Guardian.

He will not lose his professional abilities, but will lose the identity marks and the privileges within the city. These things do not apply to Zhao Xu.

Moreover, former Magic Guardians have a crucial restriction: they cannot be promoted to a higher level.

Therefore, Zhao Xu had to stay in the organization until he reached the 5th level (13th level in terms of Magic Guardian levels) before he could apply for exemption from the duty rotation every 10 days, replacing it with a "distant duty assignment" issued by the organization.

Progressing to a higher level also means taking on new responsibilities. Even "Scroll Scholars" and "Incantation Guardians" are like this. In fact, their goals are even more vague, and it will be even harder for Zhao Xu to complete them in the future.

At this moment, Zhao Xuan is flying in a place with a vast blue sky below, controlling the invisible double wings behind him, resisting the onslaught of the fierce winds.

He has already cast the "Invisibility Technique" to hide his physical form, and has also cast the "Eagle Eye Technique" and "Sharp Ear Technique", to monitor the gathering of a large army of beastmen on the ground.

The leader of the beastmen, holding a bone staff, is making a final mobilization to the beastmen soldiers below.

These beastmen, each with gray-white skin, hunched backs, and low forehead, are like primitive people with wild boar-like faces and teeth.

Zhao Xuan slightly descended and noticed that the beastmen's wolf-like ears moved slightly, as if they were carefully listening.

At the same time, their blood-red eyes constantly scanned the surroundings, and the leather armor they wore was also dirty and dirty.

Although Zhao Xuan didn't know why he was assigned to eliminate this thousand-man beastman army below.
However, as a guardian, he had seen the evil beastmen's cruel deeds in the past, and he wouldn't hesitate to take action.

"The great god of beastmen, Gouzh, teaches us!"
"All things in the world belong to our tribe of beastmen, and now they are being stolen by those shameless thieves!"
Suddenly, the shaman in the lead of the army shouted, his face painted with red lacquer, and jumped up to perform a ritual dance, as if summoning the ancestral spirits of the beastmen.

"Eu!" (a loud shout)
Immediately, the beastmen below echoed this call, shouting back in unison.

"So what do we do?" the shaman shouted.

"Take back what belongs to us!"

Immediately, the countless beastmen below, like they had taken a stimulant, repeatedly waved their arms, as if they could only release their desires by doing so.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhang Xu shook his head, thinking to himself, "It's no wonder he's been suppressed to death with such a mindset."

Oh well, let's just hurry up and finish work and leave.

Zhang Xu lifted his hand, silently gazing at the crowd of beastmen below, muttering to himself, "Death Cloud Technique."
