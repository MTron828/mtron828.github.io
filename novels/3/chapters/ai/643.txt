Chapter 644: Heading North

As Zhao Xu introduced himself with a single sentence, the people sitting in the courtyard all looked at each other with a hint of contemplation. Although it was rare for someone to introduce themselves with a place name, everyone thought it was an honor to be addressed by such a title, as if they were an official of high rank.

However, the people seemed to have forgotten the tone of "Zhao Xu" mentioned by Zheng Mother, and they all stared at Zhao Xu standing by the door. "What are you still standing there for?" Zheng Xin's grandfather scolded the two young relatives who were serving as doorkeepers.

They only just came to their senses and hurriedly ushered Zhao Xu inside.

At this time, the mage could be said to be one of the noble professions in Artesia. Especially in the current wilderness, wherever there were players, they were all engaged in vocational training. However, due to the difficulty of the mage profession, it had not been developed as much. Or, to put it another way, this was also the case in Artesia.

As a result, the profession of mage in the wilderness was originally an equal choice for players, without any distinction. However, after crossing over, the evaluations were different, and they began to be treated with more respect.

A mage's visit was different from a warrior's visit. Zhao Xu also didn't show the same external coldness and self-importance as before. Looking at the familiar face of Zheng Father and Mother, who looked like they were from ten years ago, he felt even more sentimental and nostalgic.

From Zheng Xin's family background, if it wasn't for Artesia, the two would have been like parallel lines, with no chance of interaction. Even Zhao Xu's parents, who were considered to have some assets, would not have sought each other out. This was also the reason why Zhao Xu did not search for the other person during the game.
Here is the translation of the text:

It's a distance that's hard to approach, even just looking at it. Even seeing the Zheng family and their friends, including Allow's good friends. Even if some people are struggling and down on their luck, the confidence bred by their family background still lingers. Of course, after the first week of hunger, even the upper-class people who think they're above the law have been woken up by reality. Even those who hold onto the hope of returning to Earth are aware that only their own strength is real and can sustain their existence.

As for the previous glories and assets, they're already gone, like the flowers that bloom in the mirror. The upper-class people are extremely sensitive to the wind direction and never hesitate to adopt the right attitude. At this moment, the barren wasteland is more like a doomsday scenario. The original power and wealth no longer exist; only strength is eternal and the new ruler here.

"You're Allow's old friend? I've heard of you from her, and it's rare for you to come here with such nostalgia. Thank you."

At this moment, Zheng Mother stood up, holding Zhao Xun's hand to express her gratitude. She had an instinctive good feeling towards this young man who was both handsome and charming.

As Zhao Xun walked in, the crowd was shocked not only by his incredible charm but also by the four Aen stones suspended above his head. Each stone was different in color and shape, from spindles to prisms, and they continuously rotated above his head. At that moment, players who knew the secrets of the Aen stones couldn't help but fall silent and stare intently at the strange object that had broken free from gravitational constraints.
Here is the translation of the text:

As everyone carefully examined Zhao Xu's attire, they found that although his cloak looked simple, it was hiding a luxurious crimson robe underneath. His gloves, ring, boots, and the crystal headband on his forehead all seemed to be magical items.

"What's the first team got to do with Zhao Xu?" some players were whispering to each other about Zhao Xu's identity.

"However, the first team only has one or two magical items, and four Aien stones are equivalent to four magical items. It's unlikely that players who have passed the previous hundred levels can't handle it."

"It's possible that he's one of the top-tier players."

At this moment, the young people from the Zheng family introduced Zhao Xu to their elders, who finally realized the value of the four Aien stones on his head.

Even with Aien stones, it's hard to believe that he doesn't have many magical items on him.

It's like buying a super-luxury car on Earth. Many entrepreneurs can afford it, but the real cost is the subsequent maintenance and repair fees.

"Allow is my closest friend," Zhao Xu said, his voice growing low and husky, and his charisma was so captivating that people felt his inner sadness.

As Zheng Mother thought back to Allow's daily routine, she was suddenly overcome with grief.

"Are you Allow's friend from the game?" Zheng Xing's girlfriend, Qi Qi, suddenly asked, "I've never heard of you before."

A hungry-looking man who had been waiting in line for food wanted to join Zhao Xu, but since he looked like an extraordinary person, he asked for clarification.

"Auntie just said that name just now, didn't she, Qi Qi? You forgot?"

Another poetess quickly explained Zhao Xu's identity to the crowd.

From the moment Zhao Xu arrived, she had been looking at him with a favorable impression and was inclined to explain his situation.
Here is the translation of the text:

"I know, but the secrets that Lin'er was involved with during her lifetime are too big, so I think it's better to be cautious," said Zhao Xu.

"When I knew her, she was training to be a pastor at Mistral," said Zhao Xu, looking at his ex-parents-in-law.

However, Zhao Xu didn't intend to lie to them about his past.

"But some things are too complicated to explain, so it's better to keep it simple," said Zhao Xu with a smile.

"No, that's not right," muttered Qi Qi to herself. "Although there are also wizards who have received training at Mistral, wizards and pastors are not the same thing."

"I was in charge of a lecture, similar to a guide," explained Zhao Xu with a smile.

"Are you kidding me?" Qi Qi retorted, her expression incredulous, and the surrounding players also looked suspicious.

"Lin'er joined the game just two months late, and at that time, players hadn't developed to the point of taking on roles like guides," Qi Qi said coldly.

"I have a nickname in the game."

At first, Zhao Xu naturally introduced himself with his real name to his ex-parents-in-law, as Lin'er had introduced him that way about 90% of the time.

Since he had introduced himself by his real name, it was unnecessary to keep his identity a secret from his relatives.

Just then, a commotion of noise came from outside, and it seemed that a large number of people were approaching.

Before anyone could transmit the message, a group of people burst in from outside.

The first one was a middle-aged man with a long white beard, with a face that seemed completely indifferent. His light and carefree gait suggested that he was not a professional. However, the seven or eight people following him were mostly warriors and mercenaries.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zeng's father, the head of the household, quickly walked up to the visitors and stretched out his hand, saying politely, "Liu, what is it that you've come to tell us? What's the hurry?"

The other party, who was from another planet, didn't even bother to glance at him.

However, circumstances have changed, and now the one with the power is the other party.

Liu, a middle-aged man, nodded politely and said, "Zeng, I've just heard about the matter. Please don't blame me for showing up uninvited at this time."

"What is it?" he asked, but the other party didn't bother to say another word.

Zeng's father realized that the visit was not a good omen.

"It's like this," Liu said, pulling out a stack of leather papers from his pocket, which recorded the latest allocation of residences. "Zeng, you know that when your daughter-in-law, because of the pastor's identity, signed a cooperation agreement with the camp to provide daily spiritual support."

"So, after receiving the support from the camp, the first batch of houses built were allocated to your family. Even the top-level players who are level 5 or 6 have not been allocated yet, not to mention the non-player high-level officials."

Liu asked rhetorically, "Don't you agree?"

Zeng's father nodded, his face grave, "That's true, we are indeed very grateful to the camp."

"But now, the situation is that the pastor has passed away. In the midst of housing shortages, many high-level players have not even been allocated a small room, and the situation has become very tense. Soâ€”"

As Liu spoke, he gazed deeply at the other party.

At that moment, the Zeng family's friends and relatives all started to make a commotion, looking very indignant.

Not to mention that the person who had just left, the sky was about to pour down a heavy rain, and the family would have to go out in the rain again without the pastor's spiritual support, which would be a matter of life and death.
Here is the translation:

"A few old people may not be able to make it through the night, it's hard to say. 'What do you mean by this? You've already come to collect the rent in less than half a day?' 'Is that so? Who dares to sacrifice for Nan?' 'Is this the attitude towards a martyr who sacrificed for Nan?' Suddenly, Nan's friends all shouted loudly.

The people from the Zheng family are under the eaves and must bow their heads, but these players are actually members of the power elite. At this moment, all their words are thunderous. Liu, the middle-aged man, naturally has a place to rely on, and even more so with the big players behind him.

He immediately showed a stiff smile and said, 'Don't rush, everyone, let me tell my story.' The people from the Zheng family, he wasn't worried about them, but the players he needed to handle well, so he started explaining.

'If the Pastor allowed died in the previous spiritual wave, according to the regulations, this house cannot be recovered. However, the problem is that Pastor allowed did not execute an official task, but was killed unexpectedly in the wild.' 'And the original camp allocated this house to Pastor allowed, not only to utilize her magic, but also to balance power and responsibility. Now that Pastor allowed has unfortunately passed away and cannot fulfill her task, is it not reasonable to recover this special power?'

When he heard this, Zheng's father's face also turned stiff, but he could only calm his inner emotions and explained, 'That Liu brother, you also know that we Chinese have this funeral custom, can't we tolerate it for a few days, let us finish arranging Pastor allowed's funeral first and then move?'"

Here is the translation:

As we're talking, my father Zheng looked back at our family members. Originally, we all lived in different parts of the city, each with our own luxurious apartments or villas. However, due to this unexpected situation, our entire family has had to gather here, with my father becoming the core of our family. Although we're now crowded into a single room, it's a sense of glory that I've never experienced before.

But now, it's all turned into a heavy burden.

"Sorry, Zheng brother, this is the reason I came here intentionally," Liu said, looking at the seven or eight warriors and mercenaries behind him.

They are the ones who have come to help with the relocation team.

"I'm apologizing for the intrusion, and it's also because a heavy rainstorm is about to arrive. You know that this base is equivalent to the capital of the Earth, and those who are able to settle here are not just ordinary people. Even the 5th and 6th level players are still waiting for a house, and they're worried about the safety of their families."

Liu continued to maintain his formulaic smile.

It was the high-level players in the base who requested this room, and he was speaking on their behalf. This is not something that the 3rd level players in the room could change.

"I'll go up and complain," Qi Qi stood up to protest. "In the past, so many high-ranking officials and nobles in the city arrived first, even before the players. How can you not collect their houses? This is just finding fault with someone, isn't it?"
Here is the translation of the text:

Liu, a middle-aged man, said with a smile, "Qi Qian, please don't worry. As the news spreads, everyone knows that the Earth is irretrievable, or to say, the fate of the universe is to be destroyed in two years. So, these houses that were once distributed to the upper class are now being recalled in this round."

As he spoke, he turned to Zheng's father, "Zheng, you don't need to worry, many friends of the Pastor will take care of you and your wife, providing accommodation."

As soon as he finished speaking, the relatives of Zheng's family, who were behind him, were shocked, with many of them looking half-dead.

Players who can now be allocated housing are all crowded in their homes, and even Zheng's father and mother had to make room for them. As for them, it's not worth mentioning.

Even the players who are currently visiting are not many, and most of them are just temporary tent dwellers.

"You're talking like that? You're saying that my cousin sacrificed herself for you, and you're treating her family like this?" Zheng's young adult son shouted in protest.

"Now, times have changed," Liu said with a stroke of his beard.

"It's not like the old days when you young masters would block the road with your sports cars and flaunt your VIP passes to get away with anything."

"Oh, sorry, I forgot that your family hasn't reached that level yet," Liu said with a hint of a smile.

"Hmm."

Suddenly, a sigh echoed through the room.

Everyone looked at Zhao Xu, who had let out the sigh. Liu, who had started to notice the other person's reaction, also didn't seem too worried.

After all, he was surrounded by the entire player group and the entire Ailian force.

As for Zhao Xu, who had just been locked onto by everyone's gaze, he was now sighing with his hands behind his back, looking at a wooden beam on the ceiling.
Here is the translation of the text:

This luxurious house, which all high-level players want to fight for, is, in essence, a simple mud hovel, only larger in scale. At this point, building a mud hovel outside the city walls is not a difficult task, but the key issue is safety.

Everyone knows that the house at the center of the camp is the safest. The land here is strictly planned, and building a large house requires sufficient resources.

As for Zhao Xu's sigh, it is the first time he has felt that he has been too neglectful of his son-in-law. In his previous life, when he was with his son-in-law, he would often run to his father-in-law's house, even faster than his own home.

At that time, Zheng Xin, the son-in-law, was about to become a pastor, and even if he had been introduced by a matchmaker, he would not have been interested because he had already reached a higher level.

Looking at this hastily built and crumbling house, Zhao Xu can only feel regret. "If you give us the opportunity to go to Yannan City, will you stay or leave?" Zhao Xu asked.

"Naturally, we will stay here," Zheng Mother said decisively. "My daughter was born and died here. I will never leave this place. What if her spirit cannot find its way back home after her death?"

As soon as Zheng Mother finished speaking, several middle-aged women around her began to cry. Others looked at Zhao Xu with hope, wondering if this master of magic would have a solution.

"That's it," Zhao Xu nodded.

He then pressed his hand against the completely bare and unadorned wall, which had not been painted or plastered.

Instantly, the wall became hard to the naked eye, and the muddy earth beneath it turned into a muddy paste, slowly crawling up the wall to form a second layer of architecture.
Here is the translation:

In the next second, numerous half-transparent invisible servants burst forth, each one picking up mud and carrying water, just like diligent servants repairing and renovating this humble house.

Then, Zhao Xu took out a five-ring magical scroll and began to cast a spell.

"It's the Holy Residence Technique!"

Instantly, a player who was a cleric recognized it.

"What is it? I've never heard of it?"

"That's the Five-Ring Technique. From now on, this area will forever be covered by a Three-Ring Anti-Evil Law Array, and any corpse within the range will not be transformed into an undead creature. Only sacred places like temples can cast such spells."

The cleric's eyes widened as he watched Zhao Xu's movements.

"He's adding the Endure Environmental Technique to the Holy Residence. This is a special effect of the Holy Residence, and the added spell can last for a year. From now on, this area will be warm in winter and cool in summer."

"Wow, there's also a barrier of death, blessing, removal of fear, and elimination of stealth..."

"What's going on?" The people heard the cleric's astonishment.

"This spellcasting is worth tens of thousands of gold coins just in materials alone."

At that moment, everyone stared at Zhao Xu, including the middle-aged man.

This was no longer a level of competition.

Thousands of gold coins were tossed out, and everyone knew that the man's identity was absolutely unusual, even for a non-human.

"You go tell them to report to me, and say that I've bestowed this land on the Liu family, forever and ever."

Zhao Xu looked at Liu, who then revealed a stiff expression.

"Master Cleric, I must admit that I'm impressed by your just-cast abilities."

"However, the land of Asia belongs to our lord, Zhongxia, as ordained by the original goddess."

Zhao Xu then consoled him, saying...
The translation of the text is: "Nothing's wrong, I'm just Zhong Xia."
