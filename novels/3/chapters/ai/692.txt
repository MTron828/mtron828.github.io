Chapter 693: Falling into the Abyss

Feeling that Anzhiya was in a good mood at this moment, Zhao Xu hastily asked, "Teacher, is this thing real?"

"What thing? What thing?" Anzhiya scolded him on the spot, "You're still thinking about the treasure, aren't you?"

"Hehe." Zhao Xu smiled coyly, clearly showing that Anzhiya had caught his intentions.

"However, Zhongxia, you're also quite resilient, and you accidentally stumbled upon this place."

Anzhiya appreciated the sight before her, nodded her head slightly, and said, "In the second before the magic spells arrive, I thought you wouldn't make it, Teacher. But it turns out you're still so powerful and arrived just in time."

"Haha." Zhao Xu hastily flattered her.

Anzhiya smiled slightly and said, "You call me Sister, and I'll definitely go to the lost treasure first and then search for the remaining places. Where's the hurry?"

"This is just my good luck, and I found two and got lucky," Zhao Xu said, and Anzhiya immediately sensed that he had caught on to something.

Anzhiya could follow the "Lost Treasure of the Itterian Empire" and find her way here, which basically meant that this place was also part of Ernest's secret stash, and it was almost a certainty.

How did you come to this conclusion? There are many more places like this, right?

"Are you kidding me?" Anzhiya said with an expression that came from someone who knew.

"Who told you that the secret stash exists in the form of 'one'?" she said, with a hint of crystalline color in her eyes.

"Theoretically, Ernest's secret stash has ten entrances. What you see now is just one of them."
Here is the translation of the text:

"Don't pry too much, these things are not something you can touch now."
"If you stay for too long, your aura is recorded later, and it's not easy to come in afterwards."
As An Ti Noya spoke, she lightly raised her finger and drew it forward.
Suddenly, countless multicolored rainbow lights shot out and formed a flower-like pattern. These rainbow lights then penetrated and enveloped the two of them tightly.
The next second, Zhao Xu and An Ti Noya disappeared from this space.
Until Zhao Xu returned to familiar yellow soil, looking up at the dark clouds above, he only felt puzzled, "Is that it?"
Zhao Xu's heart was filled with countless sarcastic phrases.
Just now, An Ti Noya wasn't supposed to demonstrate how to subdue that stubborn activation pit, was she?
Unbeknownst to Zhao Xu, An Ti Noya let out a soft laugh. "Well, what about it? They're all bound by oaths, and wherever I appear, they won't appear. That's why we've been staying in this empty room. Unlessâ€”"
"Unless what?"
Zhao Xu felt that there was a deep secret inside, and he asked curiously.
"Don't you think I'll tell you?" An Ti Noya patted Zhao Xu's broad shoulder with no good temper.
"I sense that you're too easy to get into trouble when you're alone outside. One of the entrances, which randomly moves throughout the Northern Domain, can make you encounter it. It's already impossible to explain by coincidence, so hurry and follow me."

"Yes."
Zhao Xu touched his forehead, feeling that his recent luck had been off.
Only after Zhao Xu lowered his head did An Ti Noya gaze at the direction where they had just transmitted away, her eyes filled with immense surprise.
She couldn't help but mutter to herself, "How could it be?"
Here is the translation of the text:

"Is it possible that time has accelerated?"

...

After handing over responsibilities to Wang Qingwei, who was in charge of all matters related to Asia, Zhao Xu and Zheng Xin'an set off lightly armed and followed Anniya to the depths. During this process, he discovered that the current lineup of Asia had become increasingly large, with the number of people eating public food exceeding his imagination.

Especially in the official system, with his exceptional memory, he almost couldn't recognize the name list. Not to mention the officials under the official system, those who dominated a region, he might only have a conceptual understanding of their names.

At this moment, the Earth-crossing camp in the lawless wilderness was still focused on resisting the impending catastrophic rainstorm.

Many experts began to estimate that after this storm, the population scale of the Earth-crossing people would likely decrease by one-fifth.

As this news spread, many people began to seek opportunities in the shadows, and private transactions were rampant.

As a result, the status of Arthur players rose again, and many former Earth players who had previously fallen into despair were able to solve their lifetime problems and rise to a level they had never been able to reach before.

Meanwhile, the clergy of the gods continued to work hard to soothe the masses, proclaiming the will of their respective deities while distributing limited emergency supplies. At this time, fanatics were able to prioritize distribution.

At the same time, many Arthur forces also began to gather a certain group of people in this lawless wilderness.

A massive storm was about to hit, and all Earth-crossing people were trapped in a huge vortex.
Here is the translation of the text:

Except for Zhao Xu's branch of Yana, which stands out among the many small forces, the rest of the numerous small forces are still struggling in the vast and desolate land. Zhao Xu, who has a more critical mission, is accompanied by An Ti Nuo Ya and Zheng Xin Yuan, and with the help of the mysterious powers of the interdimensional portal, they successfully reached the fourth layer of the deep abyss, the Great Deep Abyss.

He finally accomplished something and no longer encountered various strange phenomena.

The Great Deep Abyss is theoretically the fourth layer of the deep abyss.

In the ancient era of the demon, most demons lived in the Plain of the Endless Abyss, quietly investigating the transmission portal to the lower layer of the abyss.

As demons have limited transmission abilities, including interdimensional transmission, most demons in the deep abyss want to reach other layers of the abyss, relying on "transmission portals" as well.

However, during the construction of a massive tunnel project to reach the surface of the bottomless abyss, a subtle calculation error may have been caused by the demons' chaotic nature or the devil's conspiracy.

As a result of this massive excavation project, a huge disaster occurred, and many ancient leaders of the deep abyss lost their lives.

It wasn't until the dust settled that the demons realized that beneath their feet, a seemingly endless vertical fissure had appeared, resembling a cave.

Moreover, it was filled with numerous transmission portals!

Each stopping point on the cliffside represents a transmission portal to other layers of the deep abyss.

This vertical fissure tunnel, which originates from the location of the Plain of the Endless Abyss, is considered to be infinite and extends to the first layer of the deep abyss, Pazania.

Due to the consideration of its infinite extension, this fissure tunnel was later classified as an independent layer of the deep abyss, now known as the Great Deep Abyss.
Here is the translation of the text:

However, due to the existence of the portal, countless small paths have been used for countless years, and the other side of the portal is often heavily guarded, with numerous powerful demons and guardian creatures lurking.

Consequently, exploring the abyss is considered one of the most dangerous behaviors in the abyss.

Moreover, many lords claim that the majority of the abyss belongs to their jurisdiction due to their proximity to the fissure tunnel.

Although the infinite space of the abyss makes such claims impossible to implement, it is still difficult to prevent the lords of the abyss from dispatching troops to guard specific portals.

It is precisely because the abyss has numerous well-known portals that this layer has become one of the most frequently used routes in the abyss.

Many adventurers have their foothold here, and after arriving here, they often transfer to other destinations in the abyss.

At this time, Ainon and the others were enveloped in simple cloaks, descending to this layer like ordinary travelers, even going to great lengths to avoid "notice".

"Teacher, are you being that cautious?" Zhao Xu asked.

Zheng Xin, standing beside him, felt a chilly wind blowing from around him, despite being warmed by magic, he still tightly wrapped himself in his woolen cloak.

"The power of the abyss is too great, and the lords of the abyss are numerous as the hairs on an ox's back. Even the floating city's nine-ring mage can't compare to the lords of the abyss."

"You can never count the number of spirits and spirit beings residing in the abyss, although they focus on the food of mortal believers and the mundane problems of individuals, they won't delve deep into the key areas of the abyss."

"However, once a suitable prey appears, these powers won't hesitate to display their true strength in this unrestricted battlefield in the abyss."
Here is the translation of the given text:

As Anzhi Noya cautioned Zhao Xu, "Including those you've befriended in the past, the abyssal lords, even though they're under immense pressure in the material plane, they still have a chance to defeat an ordinary mortal."

"But in this abyss, they're the genuine 'abyssal powers,' or else these demonic lords would have been ruled by the gods long ago."

As Anzhi Noya spoke, Zhao Xu instinctively tightened his tail.

It turned out that his abyssal lord enemies were not a small number.

Most mages, even when they're about to die, would only summon a few demonic lords, who would focus on the mage's nemesis for centuries, and vengeance would only be sought by the next generation.

But he had summoned demonic lords from countless numbers of demons, belonging to the category of human-demon hybrids.

These were the most troublesome enemies among the Arthurian forces.

"What abyssal deities are there?" Zhao Xu asked.

"Oh? You still want to fish in troubled waters?" Anzhi Noya retorted. "For example, there's Lady Rosa, the Eye God, the Wild God, and the God of Greed, among others."

"However, I advise you to give up this notion. Those deities' powers are limited to their respective divine realms, and their devotees are equally unable to leave their realms. Only a few external free-worshippers, including those in the Church, will be mercilessly destroyed if they rise to the surface in the abyss."

As Anzhi Noya spoke, he sighed, "Someone once said that if the abyss weren't due to its chaotic nature, it would have long since broken free from the abyssal realm and ruled the entire Arthurian world."

"And the abyssal demons and hellish demons have been engaged in a blood feud since the ancient times, which is their best way to consume their strength, and the gods also cannot tolerate anyone disrupting this."

At first, Zheng Xin Yu thought she was just continuing her adventure experience, but when she heard Zhao Xu and An Ti Nuo Ya's shocking conversation, her mind was buzzing with questions.

What kind of terrifying existence had she encountered?

The topic of discussion was at this level?

For a moment, Zheng Xin Yu felt that the demon souls she had faced before, which numbered in the tens or dozens, were somehow cute.

"Zhong Xia, allow me," An Ti Nuo Ya reminded, "my advice to you, from the depths of the underworld, is never to underestimate the abilities of those lords."

"The entire demonic hierarchy is in their hands, so they know what they can affect, which is beyond your imagination."

"In the depths of the underworld, combat is not our first choice."

"Remember, our priority is to find the lingering soul of Laksis, not to execute our justice here, so I hope you will not be impulsive when you see something unbearable."

"Even, you may think you are saving someone, but in reality, the other party is actually an accomplice. This point is clearly explained by the corpses of the holy warriors hanging on the high walls."

Zhao Xu suddenly seized the key point of the issue.

He asked sharply, "Teacher, do you mean that if we touch a demon, these lords in the underworld will know?"

An Ti Nuo Ya shook her head, "Strictly speaking, it is their superiors. It is easy to kill a demon, but these lords can sense the death of demons they are concerned about, and once they detect the existence of something more important to them, you'd better pray you can quickly execute a portal to a different dimension."

At this moment, Zhao Xu's face turned pale.

From the moment they entered the first layer of the deep underworld, An Ti Nuo Ya's warning was the first time she had spoken so sternly.
Here is the translation of the text:

"She shrugged and said, 'Go ahead and have fun, and don't worry about anything else. What lies ahead, I'll give you everything.' What kind of abyss lord comes alone to kill one, and comes with two to kill one pair. It's true that when people are under the eaves, they have to bow their heads. The material plane is the best protective barrier. This is not just empty talk.'

'I understand,' said Zhao Xu, who didn't like doing this kind of thing recently.

'Yes, I know too,' said the concubine Noya, with a sincere expression.

At this moment, Noya's smile also bloomed. 'I think this little friend of yours has the temperament of a saintly warrior.'

'Heh heh, Noya sister, do you think so too?' Zheng Xin'an suddenly felt joyful, 'I remember that everyone thought I could become a saintly warrior. But I don't know why, I suddenly became a priest instead.'

Noya's eyes narrowed slightly at Zhao Xu, with a face saying 'You did a good job'.

Zhao Xu automatically filtered out.

Zheng Xin'an, the priest, was enough to make his head ache.

If he were that kind of saintly warrior who upholds justice, he wouldn't be able to get away from following behind him every day.

'Next, we will go to a designated teleportation portal,' said Noya. 'After passing through there, we will have officially used our identities.'"
