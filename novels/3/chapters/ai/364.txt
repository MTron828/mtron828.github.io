Chapter 365: Silent Warning

After confirming his ability to survive for 24 hours, Zhao Xu continued to pull out a squid-like tentacle and tightly grasped the sticky and smooth part. At the same time, he began to chant a spell.

"Evil Intent Tentacle!"

Instantly, two black tentacles emerged from his shoulder bones and wrapped around his shoulder. They were controlled by Zhao Xu's thoughts and flailed wildly within a three-meter radius.

The speed and ferocity of the attack were not far from those of an ordinary two-star warrior.

This tier-2 spell had become a permanent part of Zhao Xu after his spellcasting endurance test. It was as if Zhao Xu had gained two additional tentacles that could attack enemies within the next 24 hours.

From then on, he could cast spells while controlling his two tentacles to attack enemies.

Zhao Xu slightly furrowed his brow, finding the scene unappealing. He immediately recalled his tentacles and covered himself with his cloak.

Unbeknownst to him, he had become a peculiar tentacle monster.

Zhao Xu didn't stop moving. He immediately pulled out a dagger from his backpack and cast another tier-2 spell - "Cloud of Sharp Edges".

As he gripped the dagger with all his might, the entire dagger instantly shattered into nothingness and transformed into a cloud-like mist that surrounded Zhao Xu's body.

It seemed as if an invisible, cloud-like blade was hovering in front of Zhao Xu's line of sight.

Zhao Xu's eyes directly fixed on a sparrow perched on the corner of the courtyard wall, which was conveniently within a 9-meter range.
Here is the translation of the text:

As soon as Zhao Xu's mind moved, his sword energy surged forth, and suddenly, the sparrow that had ventured out to forage for food in the severe cold froze in place, falling to the ground with a thud.

Even in death, it would never know that it had just endured 18 brutal attacks.

The sword energy cloud was also a type of circular magic.

After Zhao Xu's prolonged use of his abilities, he could condense his sword energy to unleash a single, extremely sharp attack that could pierce through anything.

Moreover, the attack power of the condensed sword energy was determined by the level of the caster (Level 12) and his intelligence score (6).

As both a top player in the game, Zhao Xu's stats were unparalleled, allowing him to stack 18 attacks, making it impossible for ordinary people to withstand.

If an ordinary person were hit by his sword energy, they would be knocked out instantly, as if they had been stabbed through the heart.

After using the next two magic spells, Zhao Xu essentially gained two major attack methods.

Even if he depleted his magic slots, he could still rely on his twice-daily touch and once-daily sword energy attacks to survive in low-level battles.

He used a level 2 spell and a level 3 spell to acquire a 24-hour special attack ability, compensating for the time he spent on the battlefield.

After understanding this point, Zhao Xu jumped up and began to walk out of Mrs. Betty's estate, re-entering the bustling streets of Frosty Town.

Recently, Frosty Town had become like its name, with frost-covered trees producing frost flowers. However, the town's market was still bustling with civilians, wrapped in thin cotton robes, selling mountain goods or handmade crafts.
Here is the translation of the text:

Everyone is scrambling to sell off the remaining items before the cold night arrives, shouting loudly at the twilight hour.

Frosthaven is not the hometown of a player, and Zhao Xu had just met a few players who had come to complete their tasks on the road.

"This weather is too cold!" said a white-haired warrior, shivering as he stood before a luxurious shop door.

"You're so cold, with 16 physical attributes like that?" a nearby dwarf poet mocked, his dark brown skin and golden hair making him look somewhat comical.

"It's because I'm wearing so little due to my 16 physical attributes," the white-haired warrior retorted. "You're the one who looks like you've wrapped yourself in a hedgehog."

"Hey, when can we, players, enter this auction honestly and openly?" a half-elf wanderer complained, his eyes constantly scanning the street for prey.

"Don't even think about it," the dwarf poet said. "I've heard that some well-known player guilds have secretly sent people to come over, but I haven't seen anyone, and I don't know if it's true or not."

The four-person team was discussing this topic, with Zhao Xu not expecting it to be so coincidental that the four players were all escorting their employers to attend tonight's auction.

Especially among the seven playable races at the beginning, including the three short races "half-elf", "dwarf", and "dwarf", he couldn't help but slow down his pace to observe.
Here is the translation of the text:

Compared to humans living in disarray without a fixed residence, most other species have fixed habitats, and even elves and dwarves have established vast nations, with their own vocational training systems. Therefore, Zhao Xiu and his companions rarely see other species' creatures in human cities.

Zhao Xiu could only rely on the opponent's brief sentences to judge the number of attendees at tonight's auction, which might exceed his imagination. However, he didn't dwell on it and put on his "mechanical eye glasses" and went to the temporary stall to "search for treasures".

The half-human wanderer stood in the shadow, looking at Zhao Xiu as he walked by, and continued to gaze at him as he walked into the nearby stall. "Hey, don't cause trouble, the boss is still inside," the white-haired warrior warned his half-human teammates, who looked eager to cause trouble.

Fights caused by players abusing their "hand skills" occurred almost daily, but after the Mistral Guard Hall arrested a group of wanderer players, the situation slowly improved.

"Don't worry, it'll be quick," said the wanderer who had some experience with hand skills and alchemy. "Although he looks simple in his robe, that golden copper spectacles I'm sure aren't ordinary items."

"I'll be back soon, and you can think about how even the most insignificant glasses could be magical items. As for the real magical equipment, it's hard to imagine what it would be like," he said, his eyes gleaming with excitement.

When he finished speaking, the dwarf poet, who had the skill of "appraisal", also thought deeply, recalling the fleeting figure of the opponent who had just walked by.
Here is the translation of the text:

Ordinary people can use "detection magic" or "identification art" to determine whether the object in their hand is a magical item. However, when it comes to identifying whether a suspicious "antique treasure" is a valuable art piece or a mere decorative item, most people will seek the opinion of a poet or a wanderer who has honed their skills in appraisal.

The dwarf poet thought for a moment and said, "That priest's robe may not be ordinary. The density of the stitching is even surpassing current craftsmanship levels."

The half-elf wanderer beside him was thrilled, "Wearing a priest's robe without armor, it looks like a fat sheep. It's likely that it belongs to a noble family and was sent to serve as a priest."

"Don't get too excited," said the white-haired warrior, feeling that the priest had an intangible aura of danger, and quickly warned the half-elf wanderer. "If I'm caught, I'll just get scolded a few times."

The half-elf wanderer smiled, recalling his previous experiences of stealing from priestesses of the goddess. "I've got the 'hand skills' ability, but I'm not using it properly. What kind of player am I?"

As he spoke, he lowered his footstep and silently crept forward. The half-elf wanderer, due to his short stature, was naturally agile and had a strong sense of balance, making him well-suited for stealth. He had a 2nd-level skill in "sneaking" and could move almost silently.

At this moment, Zhao Xu was holding a bronze statue and admiring it. He had previously found a half-damaged bronze lion statue at his friend Shen Nian's stall and had given it to him as a gift.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

However, as he approached Mistral's Frosthaven, Zhao Xu roughly scanned the surroundings and thought he could give up on his idea of stealing. He would rather go to the nearby shop to prepare for tonight's guarantee.

Although the market price of the +6 intelligence headgear was only 36,000 gold coins, he still pulled out 3,600 gold coins to bid on it. However, he couldn't be sure of the final price.

Suddenly, the hidden tentacle on the back of Zhao Xu's neck twitched.

He turned his head directly and saw a halfling standing in front of him, with a red face and brown eyes, and a long beard. The halfling was wearing only the weakest armor and had a thin sword and dagger at his waist.

"Ah, Reverend, I've been wondering about the teachings of the goddess," the halfling said with a smile, "and I was just about to come ask you for some guidance."

As he spoke, he couldn't help but glance at his dagger, thinking about how to respond to any conflicts that might arise. However, this was the worst-case scenario, and he was confident that the Reverend would not overreact.

Goodness knows, Zhao Xu had already grasped this point.

Just then, the halfling stood up from the shadows, so Zhao Xu just glanced over and passed by. However, he didn't expect to become the other party's prey.

Zhao Xu chuckled lightly and patted the halfling's shoulder, saying, "The goddess has a teaching that prohibits theft."
He then lightly pulled up the zipper of his backpack's side pocket and stood up to walk to another store.

The three people in the distance were still watching the scene unfold, and when they saw the Reverend suddenly stand up, they thought a battle was about to break out. They gripped their weapons tightly, only to discover that the other party had left directly.
Here is the translation of the text:

Only their half-elf teammate stood still, not moving at all.

"Strange, let's go take a look," said the white-haired warrior, feeling a bit uneasy, and directly carrying his massive sword and walking away with the other two teammates.

"What's wrong, Matdang?" the white-haired warrior mocked, looking at the half-elf wanderer who was still standing still.

The half-elf wanderer suddenly turned around, his face pale, "Just now, he looked at me with a glance that made me shiver, it's the kind of killing aura that makes people shiver, I'm going to die, could it be the evil priest?"

"That's why I didn't move just now," the dwarf poet said with a scowl, "I thought you were dead."

"That's terrifying, you know," the half-elf wanderer said anxiously, "Just now, two tentacles suddenly wrapped around my legs, scaring me to death."

At this moment, the half-elf wanderer's face suddenly broke out with a small, less than half-finger-long, fine wound, with blood oozing out.

At this moment, the three of them couldn't help but shiver, and the white-haired warrior said with gritted teeth, "Idiot, quickly wipe your face."

The half-elf wanderer touched his face and finally realized that his face had been quietly cut.

It was just a small warning from the opponent.

"Wow, this is dangerous," the half-elf wanderer said with a trembling heart, "And there's also the unformed sword energy, if I'm not careful, I'll be beheaded."

"Yeah, if you had succeeded just now, I would have come to collect your corpse," said the white-haired warrior, "The priest is kind and deceiving, who knows if it's the evil priest, and we four might become zombies following behind him, jumping and jumping."
Here is the translation:

"These few days, don't you dare jump, this broken town is full of tigers hiding among the cattails. I estimate that the other party is at least 10 levels above, and can educate you silently without using magic. At this moment, the half-elf ranger, Patrol Guest, who had remained silent until then, spoke up."

"After listening, the four people all looked towards the direction where the priest had disappeared, but everyone's thoughts were different."
