Chapter 406: Destroying Everything

"As playing a game is also a very interesting thing," a warrior said, looking up at the sky as it was about to dawn. He directly kicked over the bonfire he had built the night before.

Behind him was the tent that his group had set up with great effort, with several steel stakes still wobbly and twisted into the ground.

Near the tent was a low and flat hill, surrounded by weeds and farther away, the village was already lit up, with many villagers starting to prepare for the next day.

When players went out to play at night, if they didn't set up a tent and build a bonfire, they would often have to log off to stay safe.

Compared to exhaustion, the fear and danger of night outdoor activities were actually a more effective time-limited system.

In recent months, with the encouragement of the forum's East Dragon and the post "17 Questions for Outdoor Camping", outdoor camping has become a "novelty" for many players to prove their courage.

It's as if not camping outdoors would be a betrayal of the title of adventurer, and it also made players' survival skills even higher.

Additionally, it promoted the circulation of revival stones.

The warrior players, who were camping for the first time, thought it was better to choose a nearby village with some safety guarantees. In Arthur, everything is fake, but only villages that can prove their survival can demonstrate the surrounding danger level.

At this moment, the warrior player stood up, planning to practice some sword techniques to quickly accumulate some sword experience.
Here is the translation of the text:

It is said that they, the four great warriors, have surpassed level 6 and mastered the legendary "chain strike" technique, extremely profound.

As the warrior player suddenly felt a sense of resonance with the dawn when the last sword was thrust out, he suddenly felt a surge of energy and struck out a few more swords.

Suddenly, he felt a strange sensation, as if the sword he struck out had opened up the arrival of dawn.

A red glow?

The man suddenly lifted his head to gaze at the sky.

Only to see a comet growing larger and larger in his pupil, slowly occupying the entire field of vision.

However, this unexpected comet was responsible for breaking through the air in front of it, which was completely black, as if a rift had appeared in the void and swallowed everything.

Only the long tail of the comet was still emitting fiery flames, illuminating the entire sky.

The warrior's mouth was only able to open wider and wider, like the comet drawing closer and closer.

In an instant, a blinding flash of light dispersed the darkness on the mountain.

Accompanied by the deafening roar, a massive fireball gradually expanded and covered the mountain, and a giant mushroom cloud suddenly rose into the air under the impact of the massive air pressure.

【Adventurer XX, you are affected by the disintegration effect (difficulty level 40), taking 40-240 (40d6) disintegration damage, 40-240 (40d6) fire damage, and 40-240 (40d6) sonic damage (reflective difficulty level 40).】

In an instant, all players within a radius of one to two kilometers who woke up from the shock saw this dynamic prompt.

The total damage is 120-720. For players at the current level, it is essentially a one-hit kill.

As soon as the player finished reading, he was instantly turned into dust and returned to the temple.
As a massive mushroom cloud rose to the sky, stretching over 30 kilometers, the shockwaves on the ground spread rapidly in all directions. The area within 2-10 kilometers of the blast center was devastated, with the force of the explosion equivalent to a tornado, causing catastrophic damage. Even animals with over 100 HP would be reduced to ashes.

The blast radius extended to 10-30 kilometers, where the intensity was reduced to that of a typhoon. Beyond that, it was a level 1-6 HP blast. The entire hillside north of the town was wiped out, as if a black ink had been poured onto a map.

As Zhao Xu gazed out the window, he felt a massive gust of wind blowing towards him, causing his balcony windows to rattle loudly. The thunderous explosions echoed through the sky, accompanied by the fiery red clouds.

This scene was a harbinger of a massive explosion that would change the course of the Northern Alliance. Zhao Xu, who had underestimated the scale of the disaster, was shocked to find that it was a level that would wipe out everything.

As the town's residents emerged from their homes, they were met with the sight of mushroom clouds engulfing the southern region and the fiery red sky. Children cried, and families lit lamps and opened doors to gaze out at the devastation.
Here is the translation of the text:

Countless aftershocks lingered, and the survivors who had managed to survive were now left staring blankly at the devastation. Even the city guards who were known for their quick response time were now gazing blankly at the scene, too tired to even put on their armor. It was as if time had stood still, and only when the sun had truly risen would the main force head towards the epicenter of the explosion. At that moment, countless people would be scrambling to survive.

Zhao Xun gently pushed open the window and said, his voice filled with magnetism, "Vivi, let's go."

Vivi had already put on her full-body armor and had undergone maintenance during the day. Her armor had now recovered to its original state, shining brightly like silver diamonds.

Zhao Xun received a confirmed answer and directly grasped a pendant necklace in his hand. The largest "Wind-Running Pendant" was held in the palm of his hand.

【Adventure Summer, you have activated the "Wind-Running Pendant" and obtained the sixth-level spell "Wind-Running" with a duration of 17 hours.】

As the energy transmitted from Zhao Xun's side entered his body, Vivi felt herself starting to become light.

The two, originally humanoid in shape, began to subtly change their bodies.

Slowly, their bodies began to turn transparent, with their stable skin and flesh transforming into a suspension of cloud-like mist.

At this moment, Zhao Xun still maintained his own consciousness, but he also noticed that his body had completely turned into a cloud-like mist. He seemed to have been imbued with the legendary three-ring spell "Gasification of the Body" or, to put it another way, they looked like gas elements. If someone with strong abilities could pierce through their essence and launch an attack on this cloud-like mist, it would still cause damage.
Here is the translation of the text:

However, the physical entity armor has lost its effectiveness, but the form-based defense still exists. Whether it's agility-based or force-based magic armor, it still protects Zhao's intangible body.

But the "gasification" speed of the three-ring magic is limited to about 30% of a normal person's. However, "Wind Rider" as a six-ring magic has a more powerful effect in itself.

A mysterious magical wind suddenly summoned by Zhao and Vivian lifts them up.

Their speed is like that of a high-speed car, reaching an extreme level. They cover a distance of five to six kilometers in less than half an hour, with the magical wind supporting them.

During the flight, Zhao and Vivian constantly reposition and adjust their forward progress, relying on the densest smoke in front of them to judge the impact point of the meteorite.

This also means that after the smoke disperses, adventurers will have to spend more time finding the center of the explosion within a radius of at least 50 kilometers.

Finally, Zhao and Vivian came to a stop.

As long as the two of them are not blind, they can see a crater with a diameter of nearly two kilometers in front of them, with a depth of over several hundred meters.

Zhao's mind flashes back to the map of the Northern Alliance's territory, and he quickly matches the location. Originally, this area should be a bustling town. However, it no longer exists, having been erased from existence.

The crater's walls are steep and covered with various explosive products that have solidified. The crater is irregularly shaped, and the rock surface is extremely hot, with a hissing sound audible from the bottom.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

"It's not safe for ordinary people to approach the surface of these rocks that have just been melted and splashed with molten lava, as they would immediately suffer injuries similar to those inflicted by fireballs. Although the temperature will continue to drop over time, this place will still be a deadly disaster zone for a few hours.

"Let's go down," Zhao Xu said, looking up and confirming that he and Wei Wei'an should be the first adventurers to arrive here.

If this "Divine Breath" is truly being manipulated by someone with malicious intentions to drop down, then the manipulator would certainly not dare to take the risk of waiting at the center of this area, and may not even be able to predict the landing point.

This leaves a huge grey area for Zhao Xu and Wei Wei'an.

Even at this moment, the thick smoke is rolling in, completely obscuring the misty figures of the two.

"Good," Wei Wei'an's voice remained calm.

At the same time, several small teams equipped with full gear were approaching the area that had been reduced to a barren wasteland."
