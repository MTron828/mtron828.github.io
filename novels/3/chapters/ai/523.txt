Chapter 524 The Most Powerful Mage
Suddenly, a surge of energy, filled with the will of the earth, gushed out from Zhao Xu's palm and penetrated into the giant rock.
"Soft Stone Technique" is essentially a second-level druid and earth domain spell, which can soften all exposed natural soil and rocks in the area.
Wet soil turns into marsh, dry soil turns into dust, and rocks turn into soft and malleable clay, such is the power of this spell.
Suddenly, in the area of three square meters in front, the originally huge natural stone melted away, as if it had turned into a candle made of tears.
"I go, could this be the legendary turning fossils into mud?"
Waiting for the first player to show off his skills, the players couldn't help but open their mouths.
The reputation of "turning fossils into mud" and "turning mud into stone" is too great, and even the method of first turning stones into mud, and then solidifying the mud into stone, is widely spread.
Of course, a trap that can be easily escaped with a successful reflection naturally has a low success rate, but it can't resist the coolness of this spell, which naturally attracts attention.
So when they saw Zhao Xu's move, almost everyone thought he had used a five-ring spell, and astonished voices immediately filled the air.
Zhao Xu, who easily achieved this, naturally couldn't be bothered to explain. He casually instructed Rota to send some of the rocks to his hotel room, and after a quick look, he prepared to leave.
For a "big shot" like him, basic chores no longer require his involvement, and it's more about coordinating the scene and handling any difficulties encountered by the construction team.
"Ah!"
Here is the translation of the text:

In an instant, before Zhao Xu had fully turned around, he heard the terrifying screams behind him, followed by the sound of shattered stones.

A worker, holding a heavy hammer, stood nearby, pointing at the front with his finger, as if savoring the taste of something, and exclaimed, "It's a monster, a monster!"

Zhao Xu was taken aback and turned around to look.

He saw three stone statues with wings standing on the giant stone he had just melted, their eyes gleaming with a fierce light. The one in the middle, with its wings spread wide, seemed to be searching for evidence.

"It's a stone goblin?" Zhao Xu asked hesitantly.

At this moment, the civilians working on the construction site, although they were brandishing hammers and shouting, were actually the ones who could live a long life. The players, who had been hiding in the shadows, were now rushing to get away, their movements so swift that their shadows could no longer be seen.

Zhao Xu was taken aback by the sight of the three terrifying, flying hunters. He had never thought that the giant stone he had touched for over ten years would actually contain three "stone goblins".

It turned out that these creatures didn't need food, air, or water to survive. Zhao Xu had already encountered stone goblins before, and he had no good feelings towards them. These creatures would eat their enemies, enjoying the sight of their suffering.

Panic and evil had already entered his mind, and he was ready to take action. "Run! It's a stone goblin!" "This is a demon that eats people, run!" "Save me!"
Zhao Xu is a level four mage, just showing off to everyone. However, when facing real death, everyone relies more on their own legs. Even this extremely ordinary stone ghost is only challenging a level 4 monster. "Is it you who rescued us?" At this moment, the three liberated stone ghosts all spoke to Zhao Xu at the same time. The awkward common language showed that they had indeed been imprisoned for many years. "That's right," Zhao Xu smiled broadly, as the nearby construction workers also ran away. Zhao Xu then walked step by step towards the target. "How do you want us to repay you?" The stone ghost in the middle grinned, its whole body a grayish white, its claws reaching down to below its feet, like a bat whose body had expanded several times. "Well?" Zhao Xu walked forward, as if really considering it. Suddenly, one of the stone ghosts screamed, "Then I'll give you a torment!" In the blink of an eye, it shot towards Zhao Xu like a bullet. "Bang." It was a crisp and lonely sound. The stone ghost that had attacked Zhao Xu was deeply embedded in the ground, as if subjected to tremendous gravity. Integrated with the earth, it was now in an uncertain state of life and death, its entire body even appeared to be broken and severely deformed. "What just happened?" A player who had come as a temporary worker, holding a hammer, stared blankly at the scene. "You didn't see wrong, that Zhongxia god, just conjured an invisible wooden stick in his hand, and then used it to dismantle the flying stone ghost." "Could it be the incarnation of a war god?" "No, it just shows that the rumors on the forum are true, mages can fight in close combat better than warriors."
The other two gargoyle statues that witnessed this scene, although each had only 6 points of intelligence, which was not particularly high, realized that they had gone from the cage to the fire pit and immediately began to flap their wings, attempting to fly away from this place.

However, Zhao Xu would not let them have their way.

Secondary chill touch!

Through the power of the spell, which could be cast from a distance without contact, as well as the power of twin spells and extreme spell effectiveness, one of the gargoyles attempting to fly away instantly lost all ability to move.

It fell to the ground as if struck by an invisible arrow.

Zhao Xu waved to the crowd, "The ghoul has lost its ability to move, so take it apart."

At the same time, Zhao Xu also activated his own flying ability and flew towards the last gargoyle that was trying to sneak away.

The representative of the patrol team who had arrived early in the morning was left behind to assist with the security situation at the scene, having been given a series of proofs by Zhao Xu, leaving him with no choice but to comply.

He had thought that these mages were more conservative and detached from the world, providing an opportunity to make some money.

Who would have thought that after seeing Zhao Xu's extremely powerful attack, even the bravest member of the team gave up that choice.

As they continued to pursue the fleeing gargoyle, Zhao Xu couldn't help but be amazed at its endurance and impressive burst of speed, as it had managed to avoid being caught for two or three rounds.

In the end, as the gargoyle flew past, the newest real players also realized that something was amiss, and many players quickly gathered around.

Initially, Zhao Xu had been slowly closing the distance, but he was considering using a spell to resolve the battle at any time.

He had a vague feeling that there might be more to these sealed gargoyles than met the eye.

And just as Zhao Xu was lost in thought, the gargoyle seemed to realize that it was unable to escape its fate of being captured.

It suddenly gritted its teeth and charged towards a group of players who had gathered together.
Zhao Xu also stared at the other person dumbly, secretly thinking that it was such a coincidence that the stone ghost had actually chosen Zhang Qi and his group.

Zhang Qi also noticed the huge black shadow coming at them from all directions and immediately shouted, "Oh my God."

However, he did not expect such an attack to occur in a safe town. In a moment of panic, the steel shield at his waist fell to the ground without being raised, causing Zhang Qi's face to turn pale.

Seeing this, Zhao Xu couldn't help but shake his head and shouted, "Portal!"

In a flash, Zhao Xu, who was still a hundred meters away, disappeared without a trace.

The next moment, he appeared out of thin air in front of the stone ghost's charging route, standing in front of Zhang Qi.

The stone ghost, realizing what had happened, hurriedly slowed down to prevent falling into Zhao Xu's arms. But it was too late.

Amid the gaze of dozens or even hundreds of players, the stone ghost, despite its efforts to slow down, slowly flew and rolled to a stop in front of Zhao Xu.

In that moment, he effortlessly grabbed the stone ghost's wrist and, with a burst of strength, slammed it to the ground like a meteor hammer.

The earth cracked, and the stone ghost shattered.

All the players who witnessed this scene were in disbelief.

"Excuse me, Mr. Zhongxia, how much strength do you possess?" Zhang Qi couldn't help but ask.
