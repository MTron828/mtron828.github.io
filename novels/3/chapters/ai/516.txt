Chapter 517: 8th-Level Ability, New Wave

It was late at night when Zhao Xu and Bai Longserus couldn't take it anymore and secretly cleaned up the room where they had just interrogated the vampire. They washed away the dust that had turned into flying ash and then went back to their hotel room to sleep.

At this point, Zhao Xu's eyes looked a bit puffy. However, he still managed to splash some clear water on his face, regained his spirits, and sat back down in the hotel room that would be his living space for a while.

After getting the "Howard's Luxury Bedspread" from Anzola, Zhao Xu could take a one-hour nap every two days and get the equivalent of eight hours of rest. However, since they hadn't crossed over yet, his physical body couldn't truly recover, so he could only rely on the game's mechanics to recover his magic.
At this moment, Zhao Xu was sitting in front of a desk, with a blank, smooth sheepskin paper spread out in front of him. A bottle of ink and a goose quill pen were hanging on the right side of the desk.

The oil lamp on the desk was slowly casting a warm, golden glow, dyeing the desk's contents, including the alchemy tools set, magic materials package, and thick stack of magic books, with a warm yellow hue.

In this late-night hour, aside from the occasional snoring sound and the chirping of insects outside the window, the only sound was the occasional "drip-drip-drip" sound coming from Zhao Xu's automatic recording pen, which was using the remaining magic points to record magic formulas on the scroll.

Zhao Xu had returned to the Star-Falling Town, and basically, he just needed to slightly consolidate his 8th-level ability and grasp the remaining skill points.
After choosing the optimal advanced profession, he can read the notebook and then ascend to the invincible 9th level. At this time, Zhao Xu gazed at the parchment on the desk, which shone with a new and radiant light. He lightly wrote "Super Magic Mastery" on it in Dragon Language.

This is the 3rd level of his Super Magic Mastery, which is also the final level of his ability. Unlike other advanced professions, which have 5th and 10th levels, Super Magic Mastery has reached its peak at the 3rd level and will not have a 4th level.

Therefore, as a mage, he can continue to advance to the 4th level of the Incantation Guardian, while on the Arcane side, he needs to consider new advancements.

As for the "Super Magic Mastery" ability, it once again allows Zhao Xu to experience the abnormality of this advanced profession.

Compared to the 2nd level ability of this advanced profession, Super Magic Mastery is extremely powerful, but it is slightly inferior to the 1st level ability "Super Magic Control". However, it can reduce the super magic cost by one tier.

There is a legendary specialization in the mage specialization that is completely consistent with this ability, which is the legendary specialization "Improve Super Magic". Therefore, Zhao Xu obtained an ability at the legendary specialization level when he was at level 8.

Later, he can combine it with the Instant Spellcasting spell and only need to upgrade 3 more times to upgrade the Super Magic Control ability, reducing the attribute damage by 1 point.

Similar to the 10th level ability of Super Magic Mastery and Incantation Guardian, this ability is also similar. However, for Zhao Xu, who is already immune to attribute damage and can cast spells, the significance of this ability has diminished.

However, Zhao Xu is also trying to empty his mind and body, slowly feeling the rhythm of this ability, and attempting to master it.
Here is the translation of the text:

As for the 3rd-level ability of the Curse Guardian, it is the same as the 1st-level "Extend Specified Magic". He can choose another spell and later convert a higher-level spell prepared by him into this specified spell, which is almost as good as nothing.

Zhao Xu's massive ability system, combined with his expertise, has made him well-rounded in all aspects. Abilities like "Extend Specified Magic", which are not insignificant for other mages, are almost negligible for Zhao Xu.

As Zhao Xu was thinking, his gaze suddenly fell on the four-level spell "Transform" that he had prepared.

The first transformation is the two-level "Transmutation", and the second transformation is the four-level "Transform".

It can be said that the appearance of "Transform" has opened the door for many mages to become strong.

According to Anniya's words, the strongest spell in the core spell is the nine-level "Body Transformation".

The strength of this spell depends solely on his understanding of the monster in this world.

After separating from the smuggling team, Zhao Xu met the Golden Dragon Kampas, who was entrusted by Anniya.

At that time, the Golden Dragon Kampas told Zhao Xu how to use the nine-level body transformation spell, and even demonstrated how to become a few extremely powerful biological beings.

Although the Golden Dragon Kampas' own body was stronger, it was still.

Among them, the ancient Golden Dragon Kampas deliberately handed over some content related to the four-level Transform spell to Zhao Xu.

Perhaps in his eyes, this is the key spell that Zhao Xu obtained first.

The Transform spell is a touch spell with a duration of minutes.
Zhao Xu can use his shape-shifting technique to transform a willing biological organism into another living being's form, excluding its original species. The categories of cross-species organisms are limited to: monstrous creatures, animals, dragons, spirits, giants, humanoid beings, magical beasts, humanoid monsters, mud-like monsters, plants, or insects.

The new form's life force is determined by the lower level of the caster and the recipient. The upper limit is 15HD.

It is not possible to transform into a non-corporeal or gaseous life form. However, the recipient can obtain new attributes of strength, agility, and physicality, as well as master special attacks.

However, the recipient will not acquire special abilities, class-level abilities, or supernatural abilities, except for the "super natural ability" that can be broken through with a 9-ringed body transformation.

Zhao Xu is aware of this, but he believes it is sufficient.

In some special crisis situations, Zhao Xu can transform into a mud-like monster to acquire its racial abilities, such as immunity to poison, paralysis, stun, and transformation.

For example, if he wants to acquire fire-type immunity, he can transform into a corresponding fire-type subspecies.

Zhao Xu can also transform into a mount and companion to engage in aerial combat.

As a being from Earth who has entered an alien world, Zhao Xu can still transform into an alien being after transformation.

Environmental factors are no longer a hindrance to his progress.

As Zhao Xu was lost in thought, contemplating the scenarios in which he would apply his shape-shifting technique, a sudden, mournful cry echoed through the night sky, sharp and piercing, as if carrying an unbelievable lament.

The doors of the adjacent houses suddenly burst open with a loud bang.

It was clear that his companions were also startled by the cry and were quickly preparing for battle.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu took a deep breath, looked at the note-taking quill pen still being recorded, and then put on the star-studded cloak next to him. At this moment, he was wearing the robe of the Great Sage, which he couldn't take off for a moment.

When he walked out to the corridor, Vivianna and Bai Long had already put on their basic equipment, and Anniya was also fully dressed, using magic to put on her clothes.

"What's going on?" Zhao Xu asked.

"Go ahead," Anniya replied.

Anniya nodded and said, "There's an unexpected situation at the inn where you're staying, and you have to resolve it no matter what."

The group soon pushed through the crowd and finally saw a dead body lying on the ground, with a woman crying and wailing next to it.

As he gazed at the corpse for a long time, Zhao Xu realized that it was a resident of the Star Town who had met with an accident.

Just as he was thinking about it, he slowly stood in front of the body, which belonged to a man in his early thirties with rough hands and a bushy beard.

Zhao Xu quickly noticed the two tooth marks on the man's neck.

Anniya also glanced at it and sent a message to his mind, saying, "Deal with your own problems. I'm going to sleep. Waking up every night like this will ruin my skin."

It was another vampire's accomplice who had seen his companion die and then followed him here?

In an instant, Zhao Xu's mind was racing like Sherlock Holmes, scanning the surrounding crowd with incredible agility.

The sound of that scream had just passed, and the crowd had just gathered around. Even for the possible service staff, it was too short.

If he was a vampire who had just launched an attack, then he was fully capable of still being here, watching them with a mocking gaze.
Here is the translation of the text:

In an instant, Zhao Xu performed a simple hand gesture, subtly completing the incantation action and activating the Silent Spell ring combination to cast a spell.

He, without form, cast out a ring spell "Detecting the Spirit" suddenly.

Instantly, Zhao Xu's eyes flashed with brilliance, and he swept a glance over the scene in front of him.

As the pale dawn light truly killed him off, he could only grit his teeth and attack, uprooting everything in Starfall Town.
