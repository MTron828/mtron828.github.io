Chapter 668: The Waiting for the Ultimate Gate

Zhao Xu walked alone on the streets of Yanan, his expression carrying a hint of indifference and doubt. After separating from An Ti Noya on the high tower, he followed her instructions to execute the next actions.

At this moment, his mind was crystal clear.

Initially, An Ti Noya had mentioned the three-columned god "Yug Sotos" in her dream. Its characteristic was "the fog without a name."

However, he had never thought that this would be the ultimate source of their clan's knowledge.

The name of the external god from the terrifying world was impossible to accurately describe using any syllables, even in An Ti Noya's dream, which was only similar in sound.

In the Arthurian world, he had to be cautious to avoid too many entanglements.

With every step he took, Zhao Xu skillfully controlled his mind, deliberately not recalling the "content" related to it.

Suddenly, his eyes blurred.

The people looking up at the sky on the rough, primitive street surface in front of him seemed to fade into a blur, as if consumed by darkness.

In his mind, a cluster of rainbow-colored light balls suddenly burst forth, constantly aggregating and dividing, appearing to have tendrils but with no fixed shape.

He felt a sense of shock.

Because the last time he saw this scene, it was during his awakening as a mage in the floating city, sitting on the throne of the ancient magic empire's ruler, Emperor Enerest.

At that time, Zhao Xu's mind also had a similar beam of light.
When the ritual was taking place, all the apprentices participating in the ritual saw a seven-colored Luminous Orb descending from the depths of the virtual space above Zhao Xu's head.

Gradually, the Rainbow Light Ball seemed to start speaking in a dreamy tone.

Unstoppable streams of new vocabulary burst forth in Zhao Xu's mind - "The King of Endless Space", "The Key to the Gate", "The Medium of Chaos", "The Transcender", "The Gate of Space", "The Regulator of All Existence", "The One Who Returns All to Unity"... and many other titles reverberated in Zhao Xu's mind, but he didn't dare reveal a single word.

As if doing so would bring about "calamity".

At this moment, Zhao Xu took a deep breath and suddenly felt a scorching pain on his arm.

He swiftly opened his arm, and a line of text seemed to be seared onto his skin, resembling a branding iron - "In the foundation stone of the first silver gate after the cosmic terminal abyss, wait and guide you to the ultimate gate beyond the multiverse.

â€”Umul Yat Tavi"

In an instant, these branded words disappeared, and Zhao Xu's skin returned to its original state, as smooth as a newborn baby's skin.

At the same time, Zhao Xu's other arm suddenly felt a burning sensation.

Zhao Xu reacted quickly and intensely, biting his teeth and flipping open the sleeve of his robe. He immediately caught sight of the burned text residue.

This time, the text was smaller and appeared letter by letter - "Yog Sothoth knows where the gate is located.

Yog Sothoth is the gate, Yog Sothoth is the key, Yog Sothoth is the doorkeeper.

Past, present, and future, all exist in Yog Sothoth.

All things are in Yog Sothoth.

He knows where the old ruler once broke through; he also knows where the old ruler will break through again."
Here is the translation of the text:

He knows which lands have been ravaged by his footsteps and which lands still bear the weight of his presence; he also knows why no one can see his face when he is treading on difficult terrain.

Yggdrasil is the key to the gate, and countless spaces converge here through this gate."

When you are ready, recite this passage silently.

---Umar Yahya Tawil

As Zhao Xu looked at this passage, he initially thought that his heart would be shocked, but now he was surprisingly calm.

It was not long ago that he met Annalise in Mistral and received the attention of the magical goddess Sisirvelin after that, and Zhao Xu became aware of his extraordinary nature.

As he slowly exhaled the stale air in his chest, Zhao Xu put down his sleeve and continued to gaze steadfastly ahead.

He didn't know if this meant that he had been noticed by the external god Nyarlathotep, who represented "chaos", or by another external god, Yggdrasil, who was similar in rank and also at the pinnacle.

Regardless, this meant that he had been swept into the tide of fate and could no longer think of being alone.

The thought of returning home and saying goodbye suddenly disappeared.

The teleportation technique was activated, and Zhao Xu's silhouette disappeared on the spot...

According to Annalise's words, the "Larx" spirit that had possessed him was, in essence, an external god who had been exiled in Arthur's world.

As for his true name, she didn't know it.

Only after completing the designated mission could Larx restore its original consciousness.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu and Larkspur were together, which had a significant advantage. Although Larkspur was just a mere "external deity" who was not as powerful as he seemed, he could shield Zhao Xu from the gaze of other external deities, and Zhao Xu would no longer be easily trapped in a dream. The next time Zhao Xu entered a dream, it was possible that he would be trapped for thousands of years. The reason why Zhao Xu encountered the external deity Nalatarotip this time was also related to the fact that Larkspur had disappeared for a while. As for where Larkspur's true body was, even Anniya had no idea. Larkspur was also unable to use any magic or divine power to track her down. However, Larkspur eventually died together with Zheng Xin'an, and the one who killed them was a "humanized god of death". Therefore, according to Anniya's instruction, Zhao Xu had to make sure to take good care of Zheng Xin'an in the next adventure, especially since they were going to the "abyss". It was possible that Larkspur would lose her consciousness and float away in that direction. Therefore, Zhao Xu had to make sure to increase Zheng Xin'an's knowledge about "adventure" as much as possible. Although Anniya would accompany them, the abyss was a dangerous place where one wrong move could lead to death. It was not like the time when Arthur was trapped in the ant's nest. After a flash of transmission light, Zhao Xu's figure appeared in Zheng Xin'an's residence. At this time, the area was crowded with people due to the heavy rain and dark clouds in the sky, and Zheng's residence was filled with the busy figures of civilians and adventurers.
Here is the translation of the text:

However, after everyone knew that Zheng Xin'an was the master of the Yang family, and suspected that she was a certain kind of friend, the high-ranking officials in the camp immediately sent a strong protective force to guard this house.

Zheng Xin'an was lying on a bed made of ancient peach wood, with soft bedding and a layer of delicate flowers that could calm the mind.

She gazed out the window with a hint of melancholy, saying nothing.

As for the two maids who were waiting nearby, they suddenly saw Zhao Xu's figure appear and were about to shout and call the guards outside.

However, their speed was still unable to keep up with Zhao Xu's spellcasting speed.

Illusion magic!
In an instant, Zhao Xu had cast an illusion spell, mesmerizing the two maids' minds and making them look slightly dazed, as if they had lost interest in their surroundings.

After Zheng Xin'an was revived, she was strictly protected by her family in this house, and not a single wave of wind could reach her.

When Zhao Xu appeared that day, along with the goddess of magic, Sylvia, it caused a profound impact on everyone's hearts.

At that time, everyone in the room realized that "Xin'an" was undoubtedly their most crucial "key moment" in this life. They were so afraid to let her out of their sight, let alone send her on an adventure.

Therefore, the violent rainstorm that was approaching made it even more unthinkable to let her go outside. This also made Zheng Xin'an feel restless and eager to go out into the world, but she couldn't satisfy her desire.

"What are you? The summer gentleman from that day?" Zheng Xin'an asked with a puzzled expression.

Zhao Xu's heart skipped a beat.

In reality, after Xin'an revived, she had lost almost all her memories, including her level, which was reduced to 1.

Even Zhao Xu's identity was something that the people around her had implanted in her.
Here is the translation of the text:

But forgetting the pain of death that had once occurred was not a bad thing. Zhao Xu felt sentimental.

"Looks like you're recovering well, Allow," Zhao Xu said with a smile.

As he spoke, he pulled out a cup of elixir from his bosom and handed it to Allow.

Visiting the sick, one couldn't go empty-handed.

Although Allow had lost most of her memories, Zhao Xu still had a vague impression of her, like a parent or a close relative. She had a hazy recollection of him.

Zhao Xu wasn't a bad person, Zheng Xin Allow happily accepted the cup of elixir, which tasted like milk, and took a sip.

"Woah, I don't know why, but I feel happy after drinking this," Zheng Xin Allow said.

Zhao Xu just smiled slightly, "If you like it, that's fine."

The elixir was a product of the "Extracted Joy" spell, which was refined to extract happiness. It could be used to make good magic items, spellcasting materials, or even as a beverage and would not lead to addiction.

According to rumors, many celestial beings survived by consuming the elixir.

Drinking the elixir could soothe turbulent emotions and erase non-life-threatening pain, alleviate grief and sadness, and treat minor injuries. These positive feelings and emotions would last for 2-5 hours.

So Zhao Xu would often drink two cups when he had nothing to do to calm his inner emotions.

"Mr. Zhong, please rescue me, I'm going to be crushed to death every day," Zheng Xin Allow said.

Although Zheng Xin Allow had just recovered and her memories were fragmented, she realized that this person was the one who could be trusted.

"Uh-huh," Zhao Xu looked at Allow with a gentle gaze and continued to speak.
Here's the translation:

"Allow me, I need to find an old companion through you. This means you'll have to be with me on this adventure for a while, which may involve risks. Are you willing?"
