Chapter 041: The True Magic

Ansit Noya remained completely unresponsive, as if she hadn't seen Zhao Xu's arm movement at all.

Zhao Xu knew something was off.

Ansit Noya failed to make even the most basic evasive movements.

Refusing to move didn't mean her defense level would drop to zero; it would still have the armor value and bias value. However, if she didn't move, her agility would be considered 0, and the adjustment value would become -5.

No one could underestimate the impact of 5 points on her defense level.

Zhao Xu was like a gambler who had reached the last card; it was already impossible for him to retract his punch.

Just as he was about to hit Ansit Noya, he had a look of astonishment on his face.

A giant, semi-transparent pair of wings unfolded behind Ansit Noya, and at this moment, she looked like a half-human, half-dragon.

Zhao Xu could only ignore everything and continue to throw his punch, even if Ansit Noya had completely transformed into a dragon at this moment.

The warrior's spirit was always unstoppable.

Facing Zhao Xu's punch that had exhausted all his strength, Ansit Noya's semi-transparent wings, which had not been set up, directly formed a shapeless force field around her.

Zhao Xu suddenly found that his punch had dispersed like a cow entering the ocean, and his strength had dissipated into nothingness.

The blue light on the palm of his hand, which represented fatigue, also disappeared into thin air.

His attack had been neutralized, and the magic spell had ended.

"You're using the 2nd-grade magic 'Wing of Protection', which can resist one special attack. I'll give up this magic, and you can continue," Ansit Noya said to Zhao Xu as he struggled to stand up, speaking slowly.
Here is the translation of the text:

It was too difficult, even with Zhao Xu's unyielding determination, it felt like they had reached a dead end.

Everywhere was a wall, and no matter how many times he cleared them, there seemed to be no end.

Although this spell could naturally resist an attack, it was only a second-level spell and had a great appeal to him.

However, Zhao Xu was not angry at all at this moment.

His eyes were filled with fighting spirit, gazing at An Xi Nuo Ya as if she were a whetstone.

Zhao Xu was clear that he could only cast one spell per round, which was too slow.

He also wanted to cast two spells at once.

This way, An Xi Nuo Ya would have to work hard to respond, and it wouldn't be as easy for her.

But he had no choice, because most of the spells were "standard actions" that required a certain amount of time.

The "rapid action" spells that could be released instantly were rare and not within his current range.

So Zhao Xu could only cast one spell per round, while An Xi Nuo Ya would respond with one spell per round like a game of chess.

At this point, he had only one zero-level spell left.

It was impossible to cast two spells at once.

"Unless you move, you've lost," An Xi Nuo Ya said with a smile.

Zhao Xu was not the type of person who would give up easily, but when it came to mocking him in battle, he was very patient.

In past battles, he had seen too many people who couldn't resist the temptation to charge forward.

As a result, they didn't even get close to the monster's lair and were knocked out by a single blow.

In the casino, those who lost big and went crazy, betting more and more, were all like that.

At this moment, Zhao Xu wouldn't go crazy and just cast his last spell.
Here is the translation of the text:

Just then, he turned back without achieving anything, and that's when he was really mocked to death by Anzhiya.

Zhao Xu continued to pace around Anzhiya.

He didn't like gambling.

But now, he had no choice.

Anzhiya had said that her effective magic would not be used again.

The mages were researching magic, and it's unlikely that they would repeat their research.

If that's the case, then maybe Anzhiya wouldn't have a way to counterattack with her radiation.

Zhao Xu's eyes were firm and unwavering as he began to chant the incantation.

This time, his spellcasting time was slightly longer than before.

Finally, Zhao Xu's robe began to flutter in the wind.

Ice beam!
A beam of frost and ice shards shot out from Zhao Xu's hand, straight at Anzhiya.

It was similar to the acid spray, except it would cause cold damage instead.

However, Anzhiya laughed out loud the moment Zhao Xu cast his spell.

Hearing that laugh, Zhao Xu knew he had failed again.

But his last spell was gone.

His mind suddenly entered a state of clarity.

The entire universe seemed to fade away, and everything was distant.

Zhao Xu's remaining consciousness told him that he needed to hurry.

He still needed to cast another spell, but there was no way to combine two spells to break through Anzhiya's barrier.

But he couldn't.

He had no fast-casting spells.

He had no more spell slots.

Unless he could compress his standard actions into fast actions.

Unless he could recover his used spell slots.

Zhao Xu's eyes turned grayish-white, like a noble god looking down on the world.
Here is the translation of the text:

At this moment, the icy beam created by his "frosty beam" had just reached AnTiNoYa's front.

Tragedies in the world are always similar.

AnTiNoYa was like a giant magnet, and the cold air hadn't even brushed against her clothes when it was suddenly repelled back.

The intangible force enveloped AnTiNoYa's entire body, shielding her.

"'Fourth-grade magic, benevolent fire, can——'"

AnTiNoYa's words were cut off.

The frosty beam reappeared!

An unknown time had passed, and the second frosty beam, composed of cold air and snow, was already approaching AnTiNoYa's body.

Zhao Xu had successively cast two frosty beams in a row!

Zhao Xu had just felt something surging in his mind, but he hadn't even noticed it.

On his character panel, a line of text appeared:

【Potential Point: 5】

Zhao Xu had originally been unable to compress his movements to achieve "swift action" with his frosty beam, but he somehow managed to cast it instantly without any explanation.

The second frosty beam struck AnTiNoYa's body.

Instantly, a few droplets of water fell to the ground.

AnTiNoYa's defense had blocked this beam.

However, she was also hit by Zhao Xu's magic.

Zhao Xu had succeeded.

Everything was so contrary to common sense!

Zhao Xu had no more magic slots!
He couldn't possibly have mastered the "swift action" magic.

The second frosty beam could reach its target simultaneously because it had been cast instantly.

"After casting instant magic," standard action magic could also become "swift action" magic.

This was the value of "instant magic" strategy.

So even if "instant magic" required a high fourth-grade magic slot, people would still strive for it.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

"However, Zhao Xu's 'Frost Ray' is a zero-level spell, and if he wants to instant-cast it, he needs to sacrifice a four-level spell slot. Even if he has a full set of spell slots, he can only cast a one-level spell at most, let alone instantly cast a spell three levels higher. Not to mention, he doesn't even possess the expertise in 'Instant Spellcasting'.
"What did he do?"
In the shadows of the competition arena, a black-robed mage emerged from the darkness, looking at Zhao Xu, but speaking to Anaïs Noel instead.
Why did Zhao Xu defy the laws of logic like this?
What's the reason?"
