Chapter 673: Threat

Zhao Xu naturally didn't believe that the other party was a true deity after listening to their explanation.

If he really encountered a true deity, he would immediately turn around and go back to the earth. However, faith is a powerful force that can even move countless people who have crossed over from other planets. If they can calmly face the existence of the gods of Arthur and maintain their original faith, they will be able to persevere and accumulate faith over time.

Through the construction of temples and the creation of statues, they will solidify their faith and make it a tangible force. They will be able to recreate the gods of the earth in the barren wasteland, just like the gods that humans once imagined.

Moreover, the gods are a reflection of the inner hearts of all people. This is the eternal aspect of "faith power".

Except for the main god of the entire pantheon, the powers of the lower-ranking gods are determined by faith. This is also the reason why the "tribal gods" of Arthur have been born and have continued to thrive.

The tribal gods are naturally endowed with the greatest basic power, and they must maintain this basic power for themselves. As a result, the tribe also receives the protection of the gods.

Both parties can be said to be mutually beneficial.

Once "earthly faith" appears, it is likely to sweep across the entire earth in an instant due to its native reason. Zhao Xu also realized this after constantly thinking about the statue of the goddess for a month.

Letting all people on earth descend upon the "barren wasteland" filled with disasters and death is, in essence, a form of suppression.
Here is the translation of the text:

In the face of life-and-death trials, one side is the ability to immediately deploy divine power and bestow divine blessings, while the other side is the desperate plea for help that has never received a response, with even the existence of the gods uncertain. At this time, only the most ardent believers will continue to stand firm in their original camp. Others will gradually shift their faith towards the "Arthur gods." Even saying it bluntly, in a world where Zhao Xu did not rise, the Earth-crossers were still struggling to survive, relying fundamentally on the "pastor team" and various Arthur forces.

Perhaps the gods are clear that only absolute faith is the easiest to reap. It's true that only when the Earthlings are scattered throughout Arthur's other camps can they be accommodated. However, such a life of ease will only leave fertile soil for the birth of Earth spirits. Therefore, countless disaster victims died of hunger and poverty, which is a cold calculation. The gods themselves will be mired in their own interests, and the same is true for humanity; the harsh environment can accelerate this entanglement. The gods are all playing a time difference. This time difference, combined with centralized management, also enables the pastor team to destroy the original faith of the Earth.

A martial arts master who understands magic can deceive many prominent figures. The true miracle is direct worship-worthy. Even the "new Earthlings" who can leave the wilderness and enter inland areas are mostly "naturalized" tribes or have already assimilated into "Arthur residents." Only Zhao Xu, who initially thought about this point, could only grip his hands tightly but was powerless. Because this is the will of the gods, which has been playing out for thousands of years, and even Anniya cannot reverse it!
Here is the translation of the text:

The vastness of the wilderness has its own divine radiance that is difficult to illuminate. It can be said that it is a place of tacit understanding. Within this wilderness, there are regions that are extremely perilous, such as the "barren lands of death". Many primitive tribes have taken root here, and some have even given birth to "natural spirits" or "evil gods" through blood sacrifices and killing.

Therefore, when Zhao Xu heard the cannibal sorcerer chanting the "sacred object", he was taken aback. If this were in another place, the deity revered by the other party would likely be a "weak divine power" or "medium divine power". However, under the control of the beastman war god, there are still many divine powers. It's not surprising that a wild god of the wilderness has appeared.

But it won't appear here. This place is the territory where the gods banish "Earth-crossers". This plan has been in place for thousands of years and cannot be disturbed by any divine power.

Zhao Xu's gaze swept across the distant figure of the "cannibal sorcerer" army and the flock of "winged dragons" that were pressing down on the land like locusts. It seemed that this was a natural spirit born from the wilderness.

Because there was no successful ignition of divine power, let alone weak divine power, not to mention half-divine power. However, relying on "faith", they had accumulated a considerable amount of strength, and from these large-scale teams, one could see that the enemy had already reached a certain level of proficiency.

"What are you saying? We've never taken anything from you so-called sacred objects." A wanderer suddenly interjected, "Ah!" The sound of the earth shook.
As the crowd was still unclear about the situation, the blue-skinned sorcerer's hand was already casting a giant wooden staff into the air.

In an instant, a dull thud was heard as the staff hit the "wanderer" who was arguing with the sorcerer. The wanderer, before losing consciousness, seemed to be struggling to understand.

Why did he dodge to one side, only to have the staff come crashing down on the back of his head? The next moment, the staff, which had struck true, flew back along the trajectory it had taken, as if the sorcerer had thrown not a staff, but a boomerang.

It was then that Zhao Xiu recognized the remote attack magic. This giant staff was larger than human size, made of a raw material that resembled the leg bone of a large animal, making it highly unlikely to have been looted from ordinary merchants. Or, it could be said that merchants who ventured deep into the wilderness were probably crazy.

The sorcerer, however, was not a true mage and did not possess the ability to craft such magical weapons. The most likely explanation was that the "god" behind the scenes was involved.

Zhao Xiu gazed out into the distance, his expression profound. He felt that the other party might be observing them.

The sudden fall of a new companion also shocked the nerves of the crowd. They had not expected these demonic fiends to kill so quickly.

As one warrior was about to draw his sword, he was immediately grabbed by someone beside him.

Everyone realized that these demonic fiends could communicate, and the scariest possibility was that they would kill them without a word.
Here is the translation of the text:

At that time, it would be too late to produce flowers, as it would be of no use. Meanwhile, on the information panel in Zhao Xu's right eye, the "wandering soul" who had fallen to the ground was still displaying the character "injured". The character "death" next to it was still dim.

Zhao Xu was still in a moment of extreme urgency, using a spell to lift up the opponent's hand. If he didn't, the opponent would not only be injured in the head, but also have their brain splattered out.

He was also quietly grinning.

It was clear that he was speaking in the attic, so he didn't know how to choose his words carefully.

Ordinary people wanted to have a good exchange with the superior being, and Zhao Xu recalled the poem "Touching the Dragon" that he had learned in school.

As for these monsters, trying to reason with them would only lead to self-destruction, and they would be beaten up by the opponent's iron fist.

"You don't care about us at all, do you?" the sorcerer sneered, his intelligence score at least 14 points, and he ridiculed, "You are as worthless as those outsiders and thieves. You are the ones who should die!"

As the sorcerer spoke, he made a complex gesture with his hands, and continued to utter mysterious characters in a low tone.

Zhao Xu, who was skilled in rhetoric, couldn't understand a word of it, which was similar to some kind of Druidic secret language, only comprehensible to members of the organization.

Suddenly, the many demons and two-legged dragons that had arrived on the scene all let out a loud cry, like a battle cry, which converged together and shook the mountains. The surrounding air was suddenly stagnant.

Facing this tidal wave of cries, the crowd of people who had been standing still were all pale-faced, and the stench from the demons' bodies made the air feel suffocating.
Here is the translation of the text:

"It's really too terrifying!" Zheng Xin Yu is also confused after losing her memory and encountering this scene for the first time.

But she didn't show the slightest pale face, instead, she had a flushed look, as if she had merged with this ritual.

As for Zhao Xu, who had always remained calm, he had to admit that this time's difficulty had increased by several levels.

The logic is that it's the same as talking to someone who talks about logic.

"For the mistakes of our tribe, I feel deeply regretful. However, we are indeed just passing by this place by chance and have no intention of offending the noble family," Zhao Xu said.

He had already understood.

The "adventure team" that had successfully explored this place yesterday was doing something extraordinary.

Although they had given the Earth humans a chance to breathe, Arthur was not just a pure game scenario. It's not just killing the final BOSS and then refreshing the game, waiting for the next player to arrive.

Every action taken by each person will deeply affect this world.

A cunning merchant deceived a dwarf in a trade, and it's possible that the dwarf tribe would refuse to trade with humans from then on.

A multi-talented adventurer shot a shadow in the forest at random, and it could lead to the destruction of his own town, turning it into ruins.

Similarly, the adventurers stole the "sacred object" and paid the price, losing this group of players in the process.

Zhao Xu also began to understand that, despite not being the first to set out, they were not the only team that knew about this information. How could they not have encountered any other teams on the road?

The emotions were all wiped out by the "cannibal tribe" in front of them.

When Zhao Xu finished speaking, several timid people in the team couldn't help but look at Zhao Xu with sympathetic eyes.
Here is the translation of the text:

It's obvious that the situation is a trap, and whoever speaks up will die. They seemed to be able to imagine the wooden club falling down again, crushing the scholar who had just finished explaining some monstrous knowledge to them.

After all, the "wisdom" Zhao Xu said was too ordinary.

However, the obvious intelligent devouring witch doctor restrained his furious temperament, and his nostrils didn't emit smoke.

"Stranger, is this team under your command?" he asked.

Ah?

Not fighting?

How can he suddenly negotiate like this?

Just now, he said that even sacrificing a heap of offerings couldn't extinguish the anger fire?

The witch doctor's words left the people in the small team in a daze.

Zhao Xu just smiled slightly.

He didn't want to draw too much attention, so he still played a trick on the people, making him look more "ordinary".

However, facing this devouring witch doctor, he was indeed "real" 30% charming!

Even under the four-ring beauty spell of the beautiful soul, these devouring witches would automatically correct their aesthetic sense, considering Zhao Xu's appearance to be worthy of being a handsome man in their tribe.

Humans are visual animals, and even intelligent devouring witches are no exception.

Zhao Xu's level of charm was so high that he could even make a wild dragon with two legs become his mount by negotiating with it directly.

He had finally reached the level where he could "brush faces".

After showing a slightly embarrassed expression to the team leader, Ku Ku, Zhao Xu turned to the devouring witch doctor and said, "No mistake."

"That's good."

At this time, the witch doctor looked at the distant camp with a hint of caution.
Here is the translation of the text:

He silently waved the giant club in his hand, as if shooing away the flies buzzing around his armor like a swarm of mosquitoes.

Before the undead tide, these camps had just exploded with power not long ago. At that time, they had fled to the depths of the cave to avoid the undead tide. Then, he had joked with the savage man-eater next to him, wondering how these ignorant humans could not think that no intelligent species had dared to occupy this region for a thousand years, nor had they built any impressive structures.

It was because this land belonged to the undead, who had always slept beneath the earth.

But he never expected that a massive undead extermination war would break out, with the divine powers of the heavenly tribes making him shudder to this day.

So he still dared not approach the camp.

But it was different for those humans who had left the camp.

"Good," the sorcerer said with a nod.

"You go, and leave your companions here to be hostages."

The sorcerer revealed a cruel gaze, "Go back and tell the leader of the camp to return the sacred artifacts stolen by those cowardly outsiders yesterday, along with an offering."

"Otherwise, your friends will become our food, one by one."

As he spoke, he gazed at Zheng Xinyu with a cruel gaze, "We will eat one leg each day, and everyone will take turns."

Note: Zheng Xinyu is a character in the story, likely a female protagonist.
