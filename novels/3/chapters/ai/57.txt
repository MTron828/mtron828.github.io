Chapter 58: Knowledge and Skills

Many magical items are highly valued and have a market price, but it's difficult to obtain them even if you're willing to pay a premium. Adventurers generally prefer to take on missions from the Mage's Association and the gods' church, not only because of the rewards but also because it allows them to accumulate contribution points and eventually qualify to purchase certain magical items.

Zhao Xu had never been able to buy a dimensional bag or some other rare items in his previous life, even if he was willing to pay a high price. Sometimes, even offering to pay twice the market price wouldn't get him the item.

When Zhao Xu first laid eyes on a magical item with a dimensional space, he felt a surge of excitement.

In the year that followed, players who had a dimensional bag were extremely rare, and it was even more difficult to obtain one within the first half month of the game.

"Isn't this a bit expensive?" Zhao Xu said politely.

"It's only 2000 GP," Anzhiya replied. "And I only spent 1000 GP to make it."

"Make it?" Zhao Xu asked hastily.

"Are you interested?" Anzhiya asked, sensing the urgency in Zhao Xu's tone.

"Curious, curious," Zhao Xu said, rubbing his head.

He definitely wanted to.

Even if he wore all the magical items on his body, he still had family and friends. If he could manufacture these magical items himself, he would definitely be the strongest player, but he would also be the richest player.

"You've mastered the 'Manufacturing of Curious Items' and 'Liou Meng's Secret Box' spell, which means you can make this convenience bag."

"However, it's not necessary. It takes time to create something, and it also consumes your own abilities."

"So, abilities?" Zhao Xu had never heard of this before.

In the forum of the previous life, high-level mages who knew about creating magical items would never reveal their secrets, and they would never let others get a glimpse of their techniques.

"Slow down the leveling process. Maybe you can create more items, and even downgrade."

When Zhao Xu heard this, he almost choked on his blood.

It seemed that he would have to deduct experience points, which was like playing with fire.

But then he thought about it, and he realized that the bag in his hand, which was filled with the experience points of An Ti Nuo Ya, was also a kind of experience points.

"Don't look at me with that expression, or you will regret it."

"Some specialized skills can reduce the consumption, and cooperative creation can also distribute the consumption."

"But more importantly, creation is about interest. Even if I create a legendary item worth a million gold coins, I won't downgrade. Do you think this 2000 gold coin item will affect me?"

When Zhao Xu heard this, he knew that An Ti Nuo Ya was thinking too much.

The depth of a legendary mage like An Ti Nuo Ya was far beyond what he could imagine.

"And if you want to create something in the future, you don't have to be so troublesome. You can take the shortcut of prayer magic to create gold coins, and you can also use it to create magical items."

Zhao Xu's eyes widened when he thought about the time An Ti Nuo Ya had casually demonstrated prayer magic to create gold coins.

It seemed that An Ti Nuo Ya had created the bag of his own abilities, which was only for his own entertainment.

"Pack some supplies for you in the bag. You can take a look at them later. Let's not waste time. Let's get started with the skills."

An Ti Nuo Ya said.

Upon hearing these words, Zhao Xu was about to burst into tears, having finally reached the last step. He had endured half a month of training and had finally reached the last hurdle of skills.

"How many skill points do you have?" Anzhenya asked.

Zhao Xu glanced at the information panel.

[Skill points: 40 = [6 (Monk) + 3 (Intelligence adjustment) + 1 (Human)] * 4]
"40 points," he replied.

"That's enough," Anzhenya nodded in satisfaction.

Each time Arthur leveled up, he could gain rewards from his profession, intelligence adjustment, and race. As a 1st-level player, his skills were multiplied by 4. After that, each level-up would reacquire skills in these three areas.

Zhao Xu's mage profession had only 2 points.

However, he was a high-achieving member of the dual-elite group, and he could use either the mage or monk profession as needed. The remaining 1 point was from the human racial bonus.

"What do you think of your skill points?" Anzhenya asked, turning back. "There's a reward, you know."

Zhao Xu was about to answer, but after hearing the second half of the sentence, he froze.

Ordinary players would directly answer the question, revealing their skill points and strengthening their abilities. However, Zhao Xu, with over ten years of experience, was well aware of the causal relationship and didn't want to reveal the answer directly.

Zhao Xu took a deep breath, calming himself down.

Many players didn't understand the current usage and significance of skill points, and some even left them untouched. Others were confused about how to use them. It wasn't until players got stuck at level 2 that they would come back to handle these skill points.

Zhao Xu knew the answer, but couldn't reveal it so straightforwardly.

The official statement has not been released yet, so Anzhiya wouldn't have asked him about it. He seemed to feel that all 35 skills were swirling in his mind. He organized his thoughts and said, "Skills can be exchanged for innate abilities."

"What? Go on," Anzhiya showed interest.

"Just like our innate abilities, which are originally fixed and cannot be changed. Some people are good at long jumping, while others are good at martial arts. However, after becoming a professional player and obtaining the character card system, we can allocate skills to gain innate abilities and reach a certain level."

"That's right. From what I know, players like you haven't reacted yet. You indeed have some kind of terrifying intuition."

Hao Xu sighed slightly and relaxed his expression, feeling relieved.

In his past life, he was warned by everyone to distribute his skills properly when he started playing the game. This decision affected various aspects of his life, so he remembered it clearly.

"Strictly speaking, skills are used to exchange for innate abilities through hard work."

"The level of skills determines the level of that ability. For example, craftsmanship, performance, and animal training are all different."

"Through continuous training, you can successfully consume skills and expand your innate abilities, allowing you to reach a deeper level."

Hao Xu nodded, indicating that skills cannot be set by himself, such as wanting to allocate skills to "forgery documents". He could only determine the direction first and then constantly forge documents to accumulate proficiency, and only then would the skill points successfully consume and become his true ability.
Here is the translation:

"After that, you just need to exhaust your 40 skill points, and you can graduate."

Zhao Xu took a deep breath after hearing this.

"Teacher, which skills should I practice?"

"Start with Perception, Concentration, and Knowledge. Just level them up to 1 before moving on."

"Teacher, what kind of Knowledge is this?" Zhao Xu had a bad feeling.

"Mainly, it's Magic, Religions, Geography, History, Local, Nature, Planes, Underground Cities, Architecture and Engineering, and Nobility and Royal Courts. And don't forget the obscure ones."

Zhao Xu suppressed his urge to complain, realizing this was 13 skills, not 3.

"Teacher, how can I cultivate these Knowledge skills?"

"Come on, just read a book."
