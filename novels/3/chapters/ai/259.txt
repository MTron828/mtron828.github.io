Chapter 260: Combat Plan

The colors of "Winter City's Falling Star Town" and "Player's Falling Star Town" clashed, striking every player's mind.

"Can we really do it?" A representative of the "Counterattack Alliance" responded to Zhao Xu's statement.

The Counterattack Alliance was comprised of individuals with various motivations, including those seeking to seize advantageous positions, those driven by righteous indignation, and those influenced by external forces.

There were also spies from Winter City, internal traitors from the Falling Star Mine Association, scouts from other towns, and observers from various organizations.

As a result, the Counterattack Alliance took on a complex and multifaceted form.

Zhao Xu, however, was well aware that he didn't need to worry about who was who.

He only needed to declare his goals, aligning them with the initial purpose of forming the Counterattack Alliance.

The entire force would then crush those who tried to resist.

Many people sensed that if the Counterattack succeeded, they would reap significant rewards.

Especially the "Mysterious Treasure Vault" in Falling Star Town, which sparked the imagination of every player who had heard the legend.

However, when Zhao Xu declared, "We can take their place."

It was as if the door to a new era had been opened for many players who were still uncertain.

He lifted the morale of players who had been demoralized.

We are not only saving humanity.
We are also swearing allegiance to Arthur.
What is more meaningful than controlling a small town to commemorate this battle?

Many people with similar initial intentions couldn't help but respond to Zhao Xu's words.
Here is the translation of the text:

"It's not that we can't, but that we can't tighten up together. A small town, with leaders no higher than 4 or 5 stars, we may not be able to meet the requirements of the leaders of Winter City within a year, but actually, it's enough for a small town like us."

Zhao Xu immediately pointed out the question that everyone was worried about - whether we have the qualifications.

Many players are still unclear about the ecological map of the town, while Zhao Xu, having served as a law enforcement officer, is naturally familiar with the leadership of a small town. He used to be a 3-star warrior and was considered a powerful force in the town.

"'The Wanderer' is estimated to be able to accumulate and become a 3-star warrior by tomorrow, so we actually have enough high-level warriors."

Winter City currently has the largest faction, the "Northern Banner", led by the "Ten Swordsman". Originally, he wanted to announce the good news in the battlefield tomorrow to boost morale.

As Zhao Xu spoke, he also revealed the news in advance.

From Zhao Xu's level, after being pushed through the forum by the planning committee after being born in the Arthurian Temple, 3-star warriors appeared in the next two days.

They can quickly regain their previous battle experience and only need to accumulate experience without having to go through the warrior's path again.

Later, the Northern Alliance also began to appear 3-star players.

Until tomorrow, Winter City will also have its own 3-star warriors.

This means that 3-star characters will start to emerge in various large towns, making the level hierarchy more clear.

However, the 3-star warrior, "The Wanderer", who is about to appear, might feel a bit unsatisfying.

When 2-star mages also appear, it will no longer cause a big commotion. The player who has jumped a level above everyone else is looking down at the crowd in the group.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu said, "I've reviewed your strategic plan." But then he continued, "However, I think it's just average, after all."

"What do you have to say?" a well-known online tactical simulation master retorted. He had studied military strategy and was confident in his knowledge of the subject.

"You're a big shot, level up quickly," he said. "You have your own opinions on magic, and we respect that. However, this kind of operational planning is not your forte. You're an outsider who can't even draw a battle map. Are you going to respect the profession?"

The people who saw the ID of this tactical master were all silent, as he was also a well-known figure in the online community.

However, Zhao Xu was no longer the same as he was yesterday.

As the former commander who had participated in the "Seal of Magic War" mission, Zhao Xu knew the simple drawing method of a battle map, but he had not deeply understood it.

At this time, he was slowly becoming familiar with the concepts he had learned earlier, which were still swirling in his mind.

A few employees in the studio were staring at their boss's screen, which showed the content of the "War Flag Master" who had just been slapped by a 4-star player, "Starfall Reverse".

Everyone couldn't help but laugh out loud.

The studio had decided from the beginning to take the mage route, but who knew they would all graduate and now only have one level.

They had been ridiculed by their own boss many times, and it was hard to bear.

The main point was that there was a 4-star mage, which was like telling them that they were not good enough.

Zhao Xu also had his shortcomings, and the team felt a kind of balance.

Many players still stood up to defend themselves, and some even criticized the "Tactical Master".
The text is about a group of high-end players in a game who are tasked with opening up new battle lines. However, one of the players, Zhao Xu, is accused of fabricating his work by another player who is also knowledgeable about tactics. The accused player produces a video showing him creating a series of mushroom-shaped diagrams using a simple drawing software, without any templates or assistants. The video is met with skepticism by the other players, who are unsure of how to react.
Here is the translation of the text:

Looking at the hollowed-out waist shape above, there are over ten of them. He gently placed the ruler against the opened video image and directly aligned it with the screen. They all match perfectly, one by one, sticking together. It's as if the other party had directly copied the waist ruler according to this common waist scale.

Even to the extent that it can be used to make a blueprint. Then, the player who is a master of counter-attack tactics directly took a picture of the pattern of his own waist ruler.

There's no need to explain anything. This represents that Zhao Xu's hand control has reached the peak. He can freely control his wrist and draw any size or pattern he wants.

Many people have quietly taken note of this point - the flexibility and controllability of his hands are beneficial for copying magic and becoming a powerful mage. Unbeknownst to Zhao Xu, he has just felt that his "hand skills" have made some progress and have become stronger.

Zhao Xu looked at the other person, who did not make another sound, knowing that he had been defeated. It's not that the other party lacks strength. Rather, it's that the other party is not a time-traveling warrior who has knowledge of past battles and is a heavenly angel who has commanded countless soldiers to fight in heaven.

Zhao Xu directly sent another updated battle plan. Many players quickly downloaded the Word document uploaded by Zhao Xu, but when they looked at the creation time at the bottom, they couldn't help but wrinkle their brows.

Half an hour ago? And considering that the other party had just joined the group, it means that they knew they were going to hold this meeting. From the time they went offline to the minute before they joined the group, they had rushed to write this article in a hurry.

This "starry sky reflection" master is not as sloppy as this.
With a skeptical expression, everyone opened the entire battle plan to take a look.

At this time, the leaders of the "Counterattack Alliance" and the pioneers of the players were all silently looking at the new battle plan.

One by one, they couldn't help but shake their heads.

Then, they deleted the initial plan created by the tactical master and only left Zhao Xu's final plan.

"This plan, when did you fill in the various forces of the Counterattack Alliance?" someone asked. "After all, we're not even sure about the distribution of our own forces."

Zhao Xu replied, "I just reviewed the list of all members and redistributed them."

"Your meaning is that you just glanced at us and directly categorized and arranged us into our corresponding roles in just a few minutes?" someone asked sarcastically.

"Have any questions?"

Zhao Xu knew that this point was difficult to understand, but he had a glance at the group list and the distribution list was already familiar to him.

The rest of the work was just mechanically filling in the names of the team forces.

"I agree with this plan."

"Seconded, the first big shot has this level of ability, I'm also impressed."

"Don't talk nonsense upstairs, the big shot has this talent, it's really too strong."

"This is the gap between us and the top-level mage."

The entire reply content was accompanied by hundreds of irrelevant comments.

Zhao Xu saw this scene and knew that his proof had not been in vain, and he knocked down his last sentence for today.

"Then, everything will be carried out according to the plan."
