Chapter 398: Reaching the New City

In an instant, before Zhao Xu and others could explain, the archers on the hilltop began to shoot arrows at the two of them. The whole process was seamless.

Perhaps Zhao Xu had already realized that this situation was hopeless when he saw the yellow copper treasure boxes scattered at the feet of several people. As for the professional adventurers, besides using adventurers to counterbalance each other, the remaining forces were mostly reliant on cavalry arrays and archery arrays. Ordinary civilians and mercenaries, after going through armor training, were equipped with long guns and would generally be difficult for ordinary adventurer teams to withstand.

However, Zhao Xu was not an ordinary adventurer team. When the first wave of arrows shot by the archers landed on Zhao Xu without any magical enhancement, most of them were blocked by his high-level mage's shield ability. Unconsciously, he had filtered out the first wave of attacks.

The remaining arrows that had penetrated the force field shield and landed on his body were directly destroyed by his cloak. This scene shocked the young cavalry commander, who was momentarily convinced that the other party was using dark magic.

At the same time, the cavalrymen wielding long guns also rushed towards Zhao Xu, with sharp gun barrels pointing straight at him.

In an instant, Zhao Xu and Vivian both activated their abilities and flew towards the sky. "Is this... flight ability?" The young man with a stern face frowned, thinking that he might have kicked a stone. However, he soon became even more resolute in his beliefs.

Looking at the two of them, he would never be able to safely let the other party return.

This is also the reason why they quickly dispatched cavalry to the nest to investigate after hearing about the giant mutated scorpion's appearance. They wanted to recover the things that were originally placed here.

At this time, Zhao Xufei flew to a high altitude, looking down at the people below like ants.

After having the ability to fly, most terrain obstacles are no longer a problem. To capture the wizard, they also need to bring enough airborne troops.

He just let out a slight hum, thinking about how to deal with the cavalry below.

He didn't seem to be in a good mood, so he immediately rode up to confront them.

"Commander,"

At this moment, Vevean's expression was solemn. Her wings, which were previously hidden, had become spotless and pure, like the wings of an angel.

She exuded a sacred and awe-inspiring aura, no longer the innocent and charming state she had before.

"What's going on?"

"I suspect that the nest is a setup for an evil ritual," Vevean said.

"During our journey, we found many human bones scattered on the ground. It's clear that these bones were not left there before. They must have been transported by the giant scorpions."

Zhao Xufei also recalled this.

The warrior from the Northern Country had told him that the bodies in the nest were suspended from the ceiling, some even in cages.

But when they just entered, they only saw the hooks on the ceiling and nothing else.

Thinking about this, his face also darkened.

"Are the corpses in the nest something you caused?"

Zhao Xufei suddenly accelerated, swooping down to ask the two young men.

The two men's faces immediately turned gloomy.

"Did you see?"

"Do you know how much?"

Here is the translation of the text:

The young man with unyielding determination suddenly shouted at the surrounding mutated scorpions: "Kill them!"

As he said this, the pendant on his hand emitted a mysterious glow.

In an instant, the mutated scorpions that had been hiding earlier all rushed towards Zhao Xu at once.

Zhao Xu silently closed his eyes, knowing that there was no more room for negotiation.

The night sky was instantly dyed red with blood.

...

Morning dawned.

"Come on, come on! Move quickly!" A middle-aged man dressed in a uniform, sitting on a horse, urged the horsemen behind him.

However, his voice had no effect.

The team of armored warriors, all dressed in silver armor, sat on powerful warhorses, their eyes gleaming with a fierce spirit. Even after riding for thousands of miles, they remained steady and unyielding.

"Please, sir, don't hurry," another burly leader urged.

A scar on his forehead extended to his chin, but it did not affect his intense and fierce aura, which was a testament to his many battles.

The horsemen behind him all looked at him with admiration, maintaining a consistent pace.

"Ah, it's really annoying. The old mistress has been worried sick because the young master hasn't come back yet. She's been begging me to hurry over to see what's going on," the middle-aged man explained.

"I wouldn't have mobilized the border troops to come over and help if I didn't have to," he added.

At this moment, it was still early morning, with the rooster having just crowed once. Most people were still huddled in their warm beds.

However, the border cavalry was already fully alert, with an air of cohesion and unity.

"I guess they saw the beautiful women among the refugees and went overboard," the burly leader of the horsemen sneered.
Here is the translation:

"Don't look down on the young master like that. He has undergone rigorous training in the army and has become much more composed."

"As a loaned patrol cavalry officer, he is accompanied by his daily friends, and I think his nature is hard to change."

The cavalry commander said, "It's not clear if you'll arrive on time, but they're probably having a good time setting up camp."

Suddenly, the cavalry commander grasped the reins.

"Not right, the smell of blood is too strong."

Hearing these words, the butler seemed to feel his blood pressure rise again in his mind.

He quickly urged his horse to gallop faster.

It wasn't until they rounded a large stone in front that he almost fainted, almost falling off the horse.

The entire mountain slope, where the patrol cavalry had been deployed yesterday, was now dead, with the bodies scattered like chess pieces on the mountain.

The bodies of the cavalrymen were all lying neatly on the ground, with no reaction or consciousness.

There were no injuries on their bodies, not even a single scratch. Even the armor they wore was intact, with no signs of damage.

"Who did it?" Even though the patrol cavalry was not the strongest force of our army, seeing this scene made his head spin and made it hard to understand.

At this moment, he glanced up and saw that the originally peaceful mountain was like a giant stone that had pressed down on the ground, with countless armor and weapons scattered on the ground.

The butler's mind was constantly thinking and guessing whether the enemy from the neighboring country had crossed the border.

"Where is the young master?" The butler was worried about the young master's safety when he saw that the cavalrymen he had brought back last night had all become like this.

"There he is." At this moment, the cavalry commander's tone was cold and icy.

He was looking at the distant treetops, where two young men with tattered clothes were hanging, their armor broken and scattered on the ground.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

The pale and bloodless face of the deceased person, who had been dead for a long time, revealed the shocking truth. The butler was unable to believe his eyes and burst into tears. The strong man, who was in charge, was also mentally cursing the situation, fearing that the alliance might descend into chaos.

The town of Zhenyuan is the closest alliance city to the Western Luo Kingdom in the north. At this moment, the other party is at a critical juncture where they may fall into a state of internal turmoil. Many outdoor travelers and former citizens of the kingdom are rushing to arrive in Zhenyuan City, the closest alliance city to the Western Luo Kingdom in the north.

Even in this sensitive moment, the city gates, which were usually bustling with activity, were congested. Not even the most arrogant adventurers dared to make a move, and they were patiently waiting in line, occasionally glancing at the things in their baskets, their faces filled with anxiety.

"This is getting out of hand!" a player team that had just returned from the wilderness complained, having been waiting in line since the beginning. "What's going on? Today's inspection is so thorough!"

A warrior who had participated in the defense of this period exclaimed in surprise, "You just got back, didn't you? And you didn't hear the news on the road?"

Just then, a fisherman who had been drinking a small amount of liquor pointed at the player team in front of him. "Hey, old fellow, what do you know?"

The player warrior who was a member of the alliance's inner circle scowled and said, "Look at the notice board over there."

The old man looked at his expression with impatience, and his boasting spirit was extinguished. At this moment, a few players couldn't help but glance at the giant notice board stuck on the city gate wall.

"What's going on? Who is this dragon who has just killed the head of the snake?"
Here is the translation of the text:

The soldier player's eyesight is good, and he was the first to notice the announcement board. He immediately changed color and began to explain to his companions nearby.

"This is a big deal, one of the victims is the nephew of the current alliance leader, Tang De. This murder case is a slap in the face."

At this time, everyone started chatting about the deceased's personal life, with most people cursing and condemning. However, there were also people who were happy that someone was able to take down the arrogant young master.

As they chatted, the topic of conversation shifted to the mysterious killer, and instant guesses and speculations sprouted up.

"Identity?"

As time passed, the team slowly moved forward. At this time, the patrolling soldiers looked at the two men and women in front of them, whispering to each other while also quietly preparing for battle.
