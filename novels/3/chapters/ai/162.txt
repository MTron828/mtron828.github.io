Chapter 163: The Final Harvest

Zhou Xu looked at the almost overwhelming array of advanced professions that were "brushing" onto his character panel, almost to the point of eye strain.

He had just discovered that the advanced profession "Super Magic Craftsman" was only available at level 3.

Therefore, after reaching level 9, Zhou Xu still had to choose new advanced professions for his mage route, otherwise he could only continue to promote his original mage level.

Similarly, the scroll route was also the same, and Zhou Xu had obtained the most precious ability "Super Natural Magic" at level 4 of the "Curse Text Guardian".

After that, he would only continue to promote the level of the Curse Text Guardian, and the real change would not be significant.

At level 10, he naturally had to choose another strong advanced profession to obtain new abilities.

This was also the most coveted way for many players in previous lives - to accumulate multiple advanced professions.

They would choose strong advanced professions, obtain the most crucial core abilities, and then seek out another powerful advanced profession.

However, this approach was extremely difficult to achieve.

Most advanced professions were basically the secrets of large organizations, and most adventurers had to fight for decades to obtain only one or two advanced professions.

Therefore, many adventurers would not choose advanced professions, but rather follow their original foundation profession and promote it level by level.

Zhou Xu was now using his temporary specialization and advanced profession abilities to consume his magic slots.

As the magician's energy was depleted to the last moment, the original greenish glow of the afternoon sunlight began to transform into a crystalline structure, with cracks appearing one by one.

The power that sustained this world, which had been supporting the simulation of the "Advanced Profession" experience, finally gave out after a single injection of power to Zhao Xu. The cracks began to spread.

"Big brother, remember, come back after completing the upgrade and I'll tell you a big secret——"

The voice of the empty space, "Qi Qi", suddenly stopped.

Zhao Xu's line of sight returned to normal.

The Morlin Stone Monument, which had stood tall for thousands of years, remained unchanged, with no signs of erosion or damage, except for an internal icy crack running from the top to the base.

Zhao Xu took a deep breath.

The exchange with the Stone Monument had indeed revealed a massive amount of information, as if hiding a huge main storyline behind it.

However, Zhao Xu had also gained a clear short-term goal.

Although it was unlikely that anyone else would be able to obtain the "Super Magical Shaper" profession, which was unique in its level of advancement, the transmission of the profession was not limited to this location.

It was possible that someone in the Mage Association had already obtained this transmission, but had not yet succeeded in advancing to the next level.

Therefore, Zhao Xu needed to advance to level 6 as soon as possible. This was no longer a simple upgrade, but a crucial step.

The ability he sought would allow him to freely combine spells without any cost. Once he obtained the "Super Magical Control" ability, he would be the most powerful mage in his level.

At this point, Zhao Xu felt that the magical abilities he had previously mastered were disappearing, and he could no longer use them at will. However, he understood that the will of the Morlin Stone Monument, "Qi Qi", had allowed him to experience these abilities beforehand.
Here is the translation of the text:

Representing those extraordinary magical specialties, day after day for Zhao Xu, they are all without any barriers.

So, this stone monument is actually imparting special abilities.

Before Zhao Xu set out from the storm city, he had been studying the "Law of Endurance" special talent booklet given to him by Anniya the entire way.

However, he had never awakened to it. It was only later, when he reached level 1 as a mage, that his special talent "Combat Spellcasting" awakened.

Now, Zhao Xu has a clear understanding of his special talent path.

At level 5 of his mage profession, he will gain a professional ability called "Extraordinary Magical Specialties". At that time, he will choose "Law of Endurance".

Combining it with the "Control of Extraordinary Magic" ability, those enduring spells will be all-day buffs for him.

Just then, Hilrel approached him and asked, "How are you, Mr. Zhongxia?"

His tone was polite, but his heart was filled with deep doubts.

After this mage brought by Anniya sat down on the stone seat, the energy supply for the entire awakening ceremony was unstable the whole time.

The base of the Morlin stone monument was connected to a supply ritual array.

Each time the ritual started, it required seven high-level mages who had received the blessing of the stone monument to sit in key positions and supply one seven-level spell each.

Generally speaking, the seven-ring mages who rotate through the stone monument are mostly those who have been blessed by the stone monument and have successfully advanced here.

The entire ritual process had become a routine, but this time it was completely unexpected for Hilrel.

Just five minutes after Zhao Xu sat down, the energy of the seven seven-ring spell slots providing the ritual had been depleted. Hilrel quickly arranged for the seven spellcasters to supply backup spell slots, barely managing to continue.
Here is the translation of the text:

Until Zhao Xū woke up, Hil had already used up seven-level magical power to revive the pearl, allowing the six mages to recover. Seven-level magical arts slots were enough to complete the entire process.

The mage in front of them, who looked unimpressive, had actually consumed a staggering 49 seven-level magical arts slots.

If it weren't for the fact that Hil had a large stockpile of seven-level magical power pearls in her dimension bag, she would have had to contact the True Knowledge Hall in Float City to urgently dispatch supplies.

Hil had been stationed here for over a decade and had never thought that the "seven-level magical power revival pearls" would one day be needed.

She had never thought that the 21 "seven-level magical power revival pearls" would one day run out.

As Zhao Xū's physical restraints slowly dissipated, he began to feel his entire body's blood circulation recovering and regaining control over his entire body.

This was different from the feeling he had when he projected the world into the stone slab at the beginning.

At the same time, Zhao Xū also felt mysterious energies constantly flooding into his brain.

Zhao Xū's heart tightened, but he didn't resist.

He knew that these were the "simulated experiences" of advanced professions and specialties.

As he looked at Hil's eyes, which were half curious and half concerned, Zhao Xū nodded and said, "Good."

After hearing Zhao Xū's response, Hil's heart, which had been tense, relaxed. She quietly signaled to the mages in the corner who had prepared various recovery and healing spells that everything was fine.

In general, every time someone came to perform the awakening ritual, they would be struck by the most unbearable scene within their hearts.

Even if they hadn't done anything bad, it would still be difficult to avoid having this stone slab dig up their past and put it on display.

Hil was also filled with trepidation about this point.
Here is the translation of the text:

"That monument didn't do anything to you, did it?" Hel thought of Anis Noir's authority and couldn't help but whisper to ask again.

"No, just being polite," Zhao Xu immediately replied.

The Morlin monument was still quite friendly towards him, but couldn't be misunderstood.

Only after hearing this sentence, Hel suddenly widened his eyes and carefully scanned Zhao Xu's expression, thinking that something was wrong.

He gestured with his hand for the priest who was standing nearby to come over and examine Zhao Xu, while using his skills to analyze Zhao Xu's expression.

However, Hel's dynamic panel continued to provide him with normal feedback, and he couldn't detect whether Zhao Xu was lying or not.

Unless he used a deception-detecting spell like "Truth Discernment" or "Domain of Honesty" to counter deception, his skills could only go this far.

"Okay," Anis Noir suddenly spoke up from the corner.

Seeing her move, the priest who was about to come over to examine Zhao Xu stopped in his tracks.

Hel didn't say much, just gazing at Zhao Xu with a sympathetic look.

When he was a child, he had urinated in a stream where others were swimming. As a result, his trial by stone was in a sewer filled with urine, and to this day, Hel would still experience the shadow of that memory when he went to the bathroom.

...

Zhao Xu followed Anis Noir on the alchemy ascension and descent ladder and left the Truth Hall half a minute later.

Anis Noir didn't say much to him throughout the process.

It wasn't until Anis Noir brought him back to the Apex Tower later that Zhao Xu finally asked, "Teacher, did you know that monument beforehand?"

In the Floating City, everyone he met was extremely respectful towards Anis Noir.
Those who could speak their minds were extremely rare.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Ah, that monument once tried to play tricks on me, but I threatened it and it didn't dare to bother me again," Anniya said faintly.

The fate-arranging monument?
Zhao Xu suddenly thought of the identity claimed by the monument of Morlin.

"What did you do to arrange your fate?" he asked.

"I simply dragged it to the doorstep of Asmodeus' house and told it to apologize, or I thought the Lord of the Nine Hells would lack a stepping stone for his throne," Anniya replied.

"Asmodeus?" Zhao Xu was surprised to hear the name of the Lord of the Nine Hells.

The demons of the Abyss are chaotic evil forces. However, the number of layers in the Abyss is still unclear, and most mages only know a few well-known Abyssal lords.

The demons of Hell, on the other hand, are lawful evil forces. Although Hell has only nine layers, there is only one ultimate ruler - Asmodeus.

Zhao Xu didn't expect that Anniya would have to mention the existence of Asmodeus to threaten the monument of Morlin.

"What did that monument want to play tricks on you for?" Zhao Xu couldn't help but ask curiously.

"It wanted me to address it as 'Seven Grandpa'? It's not worthy of it," Anniya said.
