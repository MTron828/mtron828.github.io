Chapter 290: The Eve of Battle

Facing this scene, Zhao Xu immediately realized that his entire plan would have to be rewritten.

According to Wang Qingwei and Esveier's account, they started in a maze, and suddenly one day they were unable to use magical items with a spell level above 5th grade. Later, after the time-space transformation, they ended up here, and even most of their magical items were destroyed.

After barely escaping various undead creatures' pursuit, they finally entered this tower with a teleportation portal. However, this tower was like a restricted area, and few undead creatures dared to approach.

Ironically, the tower still had undead creatures inside, with the upper floors being the same. Those skeletons and zombies, although not very powerful, were far beyond what these novice mages without a firm grasp of the second circle of magic could defeat. The main reason was that their spellbooks had been exhausted in previous battles.

On one hand, skeletons and zombies, lacking any intelligence, could only execute their plans rigidly, regardless of any trading or negotiating proposals Wang Qingwei and Esveier might put forward. They were like cold machines.

"If it's just skeletons and zombies without intelligence, I have a third-circle 'Invisibility Sphere' that can help us push through," Zhao Xu said.

However, Esveier shook his head. "Each level above has a true sight effect, and it won't work."
Here is the translation of the text:

According to the message I received three hours ago, we will wait for three more hours, and the association will organize a strong attack led by the legendary mage. At that time, if we can reach the top-level teleporter and teleport to the outside of the city, it's definitely 100% sure we can escape. But if we stay in this city, the battle will be intense, and the legendary mages may not be able to pay attention to us; the probability of escape is estimated to be 50%.

Wang Qingwei said, revealing the information she obtained through private channels.

Esveigh thought Zhao Xu hadn't understood, so he directly explained: "Because the association knows that the 'Ferocious Beast Mine' and the 'Land of the Sleepers' have merged. The importance and urgency of this event have both been upgraded."

Zhao Xu nodded, finally making sense.

Now that the "Land of the Sleepers" has appeared, the mage association's initial plan to remain calm and wait has become outdated.

This means that in two hours, a decisive battle will take place, and Zhao Xu is not emotionally prepared.

He could only bring a hint of regret.

The mysterious buildings outside the city, the true secrets of the city established by the God of Death, can only be explored later.

Zhao Xu didn't expect that he had come to this tower for a broader perspective, only to encounter Wang Qingwei and Esveigh, and to find a teleporter here, which is equivalent to finding a shortcut.

He can naturally use his "Soul Attribute" to effortlessly reach the top level, but they don't have this divine power.

Even if Zhao Xu pretended to be a messenger, the skeletons wouldn't recognize this and would blindly attack everything they saw as living beings.

After thinking about it, Zhao Xu directly unfolded his backpack and took out some blank scrolls, magic ink, and goose quill pens.

He can't bring magic scrolls, but he can bring tools for producing magic scrolls.

Zhao Xu took a deep breath and unfolded the scroll, then began to scribble down spells on it.

Wang Qingwei and Esveigh watched Zhao Xu's behavior at this moment, both of them unable to help but stare, momentarily unable to understand his actions.
Here is the translation:

"Can we still copy the scroll now?" Eschwisch asked, "Are you going to copy a spell that can only be used by yourself for us?"

For a moment, Wang Qingwei and Eschwisch looked at Zhao Xu, who was completely focused on copying the scroll. They probably understood what was going on.

It was clear that Zhao Xu had a way to deal with this situation, but the spell might be one that could only be used by himself. Because copying the scroll also consumed spell slots, it would be better to cast the spell directly.

So Zhao Xu could only copy the scroll and let each of them cast the spell on themselves. Meanwhile, Zhao Xu was completely absorbed in copying the scroll, even forgetting that he was in a world of immortal beings.

The sounds from the outside world were filtered out, and everything became silent. However, the feather pen in his hand was moving slowly, guiding the magic energy in his mind to the 30-centimeter-long scroll.

Even if Wang Qingwei didn't have the detection magic and didn't possess the "Secret Vision" skill, she could feel that the pen in Zhao Xu's hand was glowing like it was emitting light.

Time passed slowly, and when it was almost an hour later, Zhao Xu's pen completed the final stroke, and the magic energy was suddenly absorbed, stabilizing the spell flow. A second-grade scroll worth 150 gold coins was directly produced.

With only one first-grade spell slot and 75 gold coins' worth of materials, mages could convert it into a second-grade scroll worth 150 gold coins. The scroll is one of the most affordable ways to cast spells, and as long as you master the practical magic device skill, you can cast spells with the scroll at any time.
Here is the translation:

The practitioners used scrolls, which made it even more convenient. At this time, Zhao Xu directly handed the completed scroll to Wang Qingwei and quickly began transcribing the second scroll.

"Is this the non-death shroud?" Wang Qingwei couldn't help but exclaim, holding the scroll in her hand.

She then told Eswi about the effect of the spell she had identified using her own magic.

Eswi listened attentively and nodded, his eyes shining with excitement. "It's been a few days since we last met. You're actually more like a mage now. You can react immediately and use the 'Dead Soul' spell after hearing 'Invisible Technique' is useless. The true knowledge can break the 'Illusion' spell, but it can't break the 'Dead Soul' spell. It's really clever. Because we're just wrapped in a layer of negative energy."

When Zhao Xu finished transcribing the second scroll, he wiped the sweat from his forehead with a piece of cloth. He had spent exactly two hours and forty minutes to transcribe these two "Non-Death Shroud" scrolls.

However, throughout the transcription process, he had mastered the details of countless spells, using them to relearn and re-master the spells.

Now, Zhao Xu was unable to come up with a plan to deduce the structure of this spell on his own.

After a brief explanation, Wang Qingwei and Eswi also took turns demonstrating the "Non-Death Shroud" spell using the scrolls.

Suddenly, their faces turned pale, as if they had lost all color.

Feeling the urgency of time, everyone quickly set off to climb the tower.

The "Non-Death Shroud" spell had been tested by Zhao Xu at the "Corpse Plaza", and it was basically impossible for unintelligent non-death beings to break through this spell.
Here is the translation:

Every floor of the tower is guarded by skeletons and zombies, and even on the fifth floor, Zhao Xü saw a skeleton dragon, and it was still a five-colored dragon. However, since they had become skeletons, they had lost their brains and therefore lacked intelligence, so they couldn't distinguish Zhao Xü and his companions from the undead creatures, thinking they were the same kind of immortal beings.

As a result, the tower, which had previously been thought to be a formidable challenge that even a ten-member team couldn't overcome, was easily deceived by Zhao Xü's "undying shroud" magic and encountered no obstacles from start to finish.

When they finally reached the top of the tower, which was the roof of the entire clock tower, Ai Xī exclaimed, "The whole process was a bit unbelievable, wasn't it? I didn't think that the tower that had shut us down for half a day would be so easily cleared with just one 'second-ring' spell.

"In fact, if we were five-ring mages, we could have used the teleportation spell to leave, and even four-ring mages could have used the arbitrary door spell to reach the top. Even three-ring mages could have used the flight spell to venture outside. So, the tower either doesn't have a teleportation door or the creatures on the floor are too weak to be of any significance."

Arthur, the strong one, would not intentionally set up a boss-level obstacle for unknown adventurers. It's enough to arrange some brainless skeletons to block off most of the possible intruders.

At this point, Zhao Xü stood before the teleportation door, unable to help but gaze deeply at the doorframe in front of him.

According to the new information obtained by Wang Kēng Wēi, this doorframe could teleport to ten locations in the city, and one of them was definitely outside the city.
Here is the translation of the text:

As soon as they arrived, they returned to the original jurisdiction of the "Carrion Beast Mine" in the half-plane. At that time, the legendary mage who had been killed by Death itself, the controller of the half-plane's will, would smoothly arrange for them to leave. They might even encounter other legendary mages who had broken into the half-plane.

"Yeah, according to the association's requirements, we'll wait here for another ten minutes," said Wang Congwei, looking at the two people behind her and asking for their opinions.

Zhao Xiu and Aesvi both nodded to confirm that there were no problems.

"After all, both of these planes will probably be sealed off," Aesvi suddenly showed a sorrowful expression, looking back at the city beneath the high tower, and the wind howling in the air.

"Anyway, we can automatically gain the specialty 'Steel Will' outside, so it doesn't matter," Zhao Xiu consoled.

As time was running out, Wang Congwei also took out the mechanical wristwatch from her pocket, which was the only thing that could continue to work without any magical items.

"3."
"2."
"1."

As Wang Congwei counted down, she directly walked into the teleportation gate, shouting "Outside the city" at the same time.

Aesvi followed closely behind, shouting "Outside the city" as well.

Meanwhile, Zhao Xiu, who was trailing behind, smiled lightly, stretched out his hand to touch the constantly oscillating and glowing mirror surface of the teleportation gate, and shouted - "Temple."
