Chapter 705: Root Source

Beware of the Lord of the Nine Hells!
This sentence echoed in Zhao Xun's mind once again.

It's no wonder that he kept hearing this warning from the beginning.

It's also no surprise that Anzhiya, who had personally gone to the Nine Hells of Baratto, had to be extremely cautious, carrying the legendary "Cyan Justice".

The Nine Hells of Despair were not as complex as the Abyss, with its numerous powerful entities and the Lord of the Abyss. The Nine Hells of Despair, excluding the Lord of the Nine Hells, Azmos, had only a few powerful entities, with the number of strong entities barely reaching two digits.

Even the Lord of the Nine Hells did not choose this place as a sacred site, not even the evil forces that followed the chaotic laws. Not even the researchers of the Abyss could criticize the Lord of the Nine Hells for choosing this place, which was advantageous. If he was reincarnated in the Abyss, he would have controlled one of the layers.

However, comparing the Nine Hells of Despair to the scattered sand of the Abyss, the Nine Hells of Despair could be said to be completely under the control of Azmos.

Even the lords of the Nine Hells of Despair were decided by his single word.

Not even if the "Lord of the Abyss" existed in the future could he rival Azmos's control over the entire realm.

One of the creation dragons, the embodiment of order, the Lord of the Nine Hells of Despair.

When these factors were combined, Azmos's authority seemed to have become a natural phenomenon.

In an instant, Zhao Xu's eyes sank into a state of confusion, with swirling vortexes surrounding him, carrying his gaze and soul away to the sky.

Slowly, he seemed to have traveled back to the entire Arthurian world, still in a state of chaos.

At that moment, everything around him was shrouded in mist, although the outline of the entire world was visible, with the framework of the outer layer also faintly appearing.

However, everything was devoid of vital signs.

And, of course, there was no death.

Voidness was the greatest will of this world.

It seemed like a massive ship sailing towards destruction on the vast ocean, with the ship's lights extinguished, maintaining a state of silence, as if dead, until it collided with the iceberg, completing its final mission.

Here, there was no divine decree, allowing the world to have light.

Nor was there life and reproduction, making the world colorful and diverse.

Zhao Xu suddenly widened his eyes.

Straight ahead, he stared at the void, as if unable to separate the chaotic mist - the creation giant dragon!

Order and chaos!

They took the form of a dragon with a long tail, with another dragon holding its tail, also having its tail held by another.

This formed the ring of fate.

The ring of conclusion.

The ring of origin.

Suddenly, the sky and earth changed color, mountains and rivers collapsed, as if the mist suddenly dissipated, revealing all hidden existences in the bright blue sky.

Zhao Xu saw it.

The dragon representing order let out a furious roar, filled with anger, gazing at its identical twin.

Instantly.

The good and evil of heaven and earth were also clarified in this instant, simultaneously undergoing differentiation.

And order and chaos continued to plummet towards the deepest layer of the plane, gradually expanding the range of the Arthurian sky.

The plane's giant wheel also took its first step towards formation.

Until...
Here is the translation of the text:

The ordered and majestic dragon serpent struck the ground, and the limitless power of the dimension condensed instantly, transforming into the nine circles of hell---

The first circle is Abaddon, the second is Dis, the third is Mambolo, the fourth is Phlegyas, the fifth is Steggia, the sixth is Marbogi, the seventh is Maladomi, the eighth is Caronia, and the ninth is Nessus.

The nine layers of Barath's hell are arranged in a funnel shape, with the largest Abaddon at the top and the smallest Nessus at the bottom.

Zhao Xu gazed upon the existence of pure law and evil thoughts that filled each layer, formed through the process of pouring out fresh blood. These thoughts hovered in the dark and obscure shadows beneath the gray sky and the barren ground.

At the same time, the demons scattered blood everywhere, gradually emerging from the depths of hell. They had bewildered eyes, angry eyes, and eyes of devotion, kneeling uniformly towards the ninth circle of Nessus, kneeling towards the land of birth, and kneeling towards the will and camp.

Meanwhile, a loud roar echoed through the heavens and the earth---

You have entered this place, and must abandon all hope!

A vortex-like red void appeared, with Nessus's cursed plain, and the evil order of law and power, like a prison, confined this world, and all chaotic forces retreated.

The outline of the dimension resembled an egg shape, with serrated edges, and the absolute flat ground allowed people to easily see the surrounding scenery.

At the same time, the impact caused the formation of intersecting mountain ranges and valleys, like a net, on the entire dry rock layer, drawing out a heavenly and earthly net. And at the bottom of these crevices, a limitless space was opened up.
Here is the translation of the text:

As the guardian dragon, who had fallen into the pit of chaos, slowly crawled out of the deep pit where he had torn his flesh and blood, he stood up again in the place where he had stopped falling - the Pit of Barath. The pit, which had been left by the impact, became an eternal landmark of Nergal, a swirling vortex on the surface, resembling a chasm.

At the same time, every drop of blood that splashed here became a deep-jail refining demon with full life, raging and loyal, constantly howling and singing the greatness of creation in the Serpent Coil Valley.

Asmoriel, who had stood up, still had the fresh blood splattered all over his body due to the impact that had opened a portal to another dimension.

The wounds on his body had not healed, as if time had been cursed to forever accompany him.

The former creator dragon had died.

Asmoriel woke up, with a red-colored skin, a haughty and elegant demeanor, and horns. His cold gaze pierced through the void, directly fixing on Zhao Xun.

Slowly, Zhao Xun's appearance began to change...

He became a powerful demon with black skin and hair, standing four meters tall. His handsome face was filled with danger, and his red eyes emitted an evil glow. He had a pair of sharp horns on his forehead, and he wore a luxurious robe with black diamonds and red gems. In his hand, he held a red gemstone scepter symbolizing the highest authority of hell.

The other party raised his scepter, letting out a menacing laugh.

Zhao Xun suddenly felt a daze, waking up from his deep sleep, returning from the void of history.

He looked at the old man before him with a bewildered expression, who was the embodiment of the deepest layer of the abyss.

This was the scene where they had parted ways before.

Finally, the old man kneeled down before Zhao Xun.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu stood with a faint look of bewilderment in his eyes, his hands behind his back, silently walking through the empty space. It was as if he had felt the profundity of the abyss at this moment.

He felt the resonance of the abyss's intention, as if he was being called out by it, and it was trying to reunite with him. But what about him?

Zhao Xu saw the scene of Asmodius's rebirth, but he didn't see his own. It was as if he had been reassembled into an unbreakable enigma.

"What should I do next?" Zhao Xu asked in despair.

Facing this situation, he sank deeply into confusion and bewilderment.

Numerous powers from the abyss gathered around him, like a whirlwind that wouldn't subside, as if they were trying to transform his entire body into the essence of the abyss.

Zhao Xu heard the resonance, felt the vibration, and even sensed the collective call of the heavens and earth.

He saw the arrangement of his character cards on the battlefield, with the line between the fixed position and the chaotic camp, unable to be blocked as it marched towards chaos.

If he were to transform into chaos, he would be the greatest common divisor of this world.

In an instant, Zhao Xu took a deep breath and turned to look at the old man kneeling on the ground.

"Uh?"

At this moment, he seemed to carry an aura of ancient, profound, and boundless air, without the need for imitation, as if it was naturally spread.

"What do you want me to do?" the old man bent his head further and further down.

"Master, the only thing you need to do is to open the 'Tome of the Abyss' that you left behind. This is the highest and most supreme artifact that contains all the secrets of the abyss, and it is also the key to your return."

(The text is from a novel, and the translation is based on the Chinese text provided.)
Here is the translation of the text:

As long as you open it, you can instantly possess all the power in the world, which is both a foreshadowing and a crucial link in the fate. Zhao Xu shook his head in disbelief.

"But didn't the ancient tome have someone else reading it before?"

"Yes, indeed," the old man said, bowing his head lower, as if he was about to press his forehead to the ground, not daring to lift it up even slightly.

"Since the fate has changed, no matter how hard you try, the owner cannot touch it at all. All the world lines have been observed by Asmordis, who woke up first, and are being killed off one by one."

"Therefore, when the scholar of the abyss appeared, I let him browse the 'Abyssal Tome' and he left this layer after that. Later, he wrote the 'Dark Scroll' outside, which contains the countless divine artifacts of the abyss."

This realization suddenly dawned on Zhao Xu.

He touched the mysterious painting?

"You didn't say that when I arrived at the abyss, as soon as I touched the portal, I would be transmitted here precisely and accurately?"

The old man smiled bitterly, "That's what I said, but if you take another step back, you will be killed by the Lord of the Abyss first."

"He will extinguish you completely in the entire world, even from that moment on, and he will delete everything related to you, including your territory and all the people you know."

"So everything needs a hidden plan."

"The Dark Scroll is the key to this plan. As long as it has a breath, all the Dark Scrolls of the Abyss will be disordered, as if countless substitutes."
Even if the Lord of the Nine Hells were to become aware of the situation at that moment, it would be too late, because he wouldn't know which one of them was the true master. Moreover, if he were to rashly enter the abyss, he would be subject to the pressure of the dimensional forces, making it impossible for him to transform into a thousand or ten thousand, and capture them one by one.

What's most crucial here is that you must come into contact with a "Dark Scroll", and fortunately, you have indeed accomplished that.

As Zhao Xu listened to this, he let out a deep sigh.

Who could have thought that everything would boil down to a single oil painting?

No, it should be said to be a sacred treasure.

Ahahm's Dark Scroll!

Unexpectedly, the scroll recording the knowledge of demons also contained information about the hellish creatures and the abyss, and it could provide the user with mysterious powers. Moreover, it secretly harbored a profound "situation" waiting for him to return.

Zhao Xu couldn't help but recall what Anzhenya had described on the spot - that Ahahm's Dark Scroll was composed of hundreds of independent chapters.

Those secondary divine treasures were not unique - chapters appeared in almost every dimension in the form of books, scrolls, and copies.

This series of divine treasures had been imbued with an unparalleled sense of secrecy from the moment they appeared.

It was indeed the blessing of the abyss that had enabled them to become divine treasures.

A divine treasure that leaked the secrets of the abyss could survive in the abyss for a long time, but how could it be possible without the permission of the will of the abyss?

It was ridiculous for those demons who desperately wanted to retrieve and destroy it to be unwittingly helping the Lord of the Nine Hells.

Zhao Xu suddenly thought of an incongruous place.

"But didn't the original Ernest not come to this place?"
Here is the translation of the text:

According to his speculation, he traveled back in time to the ancient era of King Arthur and met May, who became his first disciple. Later, he encountered a young girl named Anny and took her as his adopted disciple, even sacrificing the entire magical empire for her safety. He left the present-day King Arthur and returned to the historical King Arthur, experiencing something during this process that led to the extraordinary event at that time. He didn't think the current world could cultivate someone who could destroy everything in ancient times like Ernest. This is also the version Zhao Xu thought was closest to the truth.

However, if this were the case, Ernest might have already touched the "Infernal Scroll" by then? At that time, he should have immediately become the master of the abyss. Zhao Xu immediately regained his vigilance.

Although he absorbed the power of the abyss around him, he could still hear the cheers and applause ringing in his ears. However, these recent messages were all based on the single-sided testimony of an old man. He knew everything because the other party had shown him. It was like he had stumbled upon an ancient stone and deciphered the astonishing story through it. All of these were isolated cases, lacking corresponding auxiliary evidence and incomplete chain of evidence. Even this level of abyss, whether it was the true bottomless realm, was still unknown.
