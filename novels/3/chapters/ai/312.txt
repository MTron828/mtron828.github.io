Chapter 313: The Truth of a Century

As soon as Zhao Xu heard the voice, he cautiously asked some private information to confirm that the voice he heard was indeed Anniya.

According to his understanding, the other party would never observe his actions carelessly.

From Anniya's perspective, as long as Zhao Xu didn't use up the five Revival Stones, he was equivalent to being in a state of full energy and didn't need to worry.

Finally, under Anniya's suggestion, Zhao Xu paid a bag of gold coins he obtained from his half-hearted demon task as a fee for buying the secret.

Shi Jian and others also swore not to leak the secrets of this region to him. He also handed over the notebook to Zhao Xu.

For such a one-time buyout, Zhao Xu was very decisive in setting the price and didn't bother to negotiate.

In reality, the Guardian's Guild members were taken aback by the gold coins Zhao Xu offered, as they were in a weak position. They didn't expect this crazy wind mage to be so generous.

Shi Jian nodded in gratitude and hinted that he could help Zhao Xu with some tasks he didn't want to do himself, or even run errands for him.

At this point, the Guardian's Guild members basically treated Zhao Xu as a strong NPC who could be approached and asked for help.

Zhao Xu left a "contact method" for Shi Jian and others before leaving.

Subsequently, the players of the Guardian's Guild returned to Mistral overnight and did not have any second thoughts.

After the buyout, it was time for them to leave discreetly and get closer to the Sunset Valley, which posed a greater risk for them.

After everyone had evacuated, Zhao Xu then stepped onto the stone steps, standing on the high platform beside the Moon Lake.

"Teacher, you wouldn't be following me from the time I left, would you?" Zhao Xu asked with a hint of knowledge.

"You're thinking too much," An Ti Nuo Ya said with a calm and gentle tone. "You've entered this region, and that's when I focused my attention on you. Who would have thought that I would run into an old acquaintance?"

"Entered?" Zhao Xu asked with a hint of curiosity.

"This territory, the Valley of the Setting Sun, is my domain, and you've caused some disturbance. Naturally, I would know about it," An Ti Nuo Ya said.

The word "domain" is sacred and represents the concept of the Arthurian nobility. It immediately seized Zhao Xu's heart.

The domain itself means that one has all the legal rights to the territory, but the Arthurian domain is extremely strict because it requires the approval of the gods.

Zhao Xu was taken aback that An Ti Nuo Ya had such capital, and a sudden flash of gold light flashed in his mind.

So, the ferocious bear that was killed was actually An Ti Nuo Ya's pet. Zhao Xu also vaguely understood that if the wizard tower really sank to the bottom of the Moon Lake, An Ti Nuo Ya would not have been unaware.

If An Ti Nuo Ya had known that the wizard tower was within a three- to four-day range from Mistral at the beginning, he would have suspected it.

The wizards of Mistral a hundred years ago really could have ignored the wizard tower that fell beneath their noses.

An Ti Nuo Ya's appearance at this moment finally cleared up Zhao Xu's doubts.

"Teacher, did you dig up that wizard tower before?" Zhao Xu asked.

At this moment, he felt relieved.

Even the enemies lurking around, they're just like chicken and dogs. Moreover, with Anzhenya's intervention, the next notebook will then be merged with him.

"That wizard tower is still at the bottom of the lake, and I didn't dig it up," Anzhenya said calmly.

At this moment, the slightly intoxicated night wind blew against Zhao Xun's face, bringing him a faint chill and making him feel slightly clear-headed.

"What's the point of having so many layers underneath?" Zhao Xun asked.

It's been only a night since they searched, and they've consumed 60 hours of magical energy without finding anything.

"That wizard tower was crushed into the lake bottom by the dying Ero law wizard himself. Ah, these nine-ring wizards are quite ordinary, and calculating the legendary wizard is a set of rules."

"I'm not impressed by his wizard tower, and I'm afraid that other wizards might covet it. So, I'll just crush it into my territory and ask you to store it for free for several hundred years. When a wizard with innate talent appears in his descendants, I'll dig it up again."

"What a ridiculous transaction. This wizard tower has fallen from the sky to the bottom of the lake, about 30 kilometers down. I'll double the work by digging another 30 kilometers underground."

Anzhenya said proudly, as if he was very satisfied with his actions.

Zhao Xun listened and could only mutter to himself that this "retaliation" method was indeed childish.

Moreover, the opponent had fallen from 30 kilometers in the air. Anzhenya had forcefully pushed the rocky barriers on the lake bottom, making it extremely difficult.

It seemed that the "Ageless" technique did not increase one's mental age, but it did come with a price. After Zhao Xu thought about it, he felt even more relaxed and wasn't worried about the mage tower leaking out information. The distance between the mage tower and the surrounding area was about 30 kilometers. So, even if Shao Jian and others knew the location of the mage tower, it was of little significance.

The real value was the encrypted part at the back of the notebook in his hand. Zhao Xu had paid a hefty price for it, which was equivalent to severing the causal relationship.

"Ah? Do you want to dig up that mage tower?"

Suddenly, Anaïs's shadowy figure appeared beside Zhao Xu, standing shoulder to shoulder with him. Zhao Xu could only see Anaïs's shadowy figure through his "True Knowledge" technique, but he couldn't sense her presence through his senses, indicating that Anaïs was using a higher-level concealment technique.

After Anaïs appeared, she looked straight ahead at the territory she owned. "Teacher, logically speaking, that thing is also a treasure without an owner. I won't be violating any rules if I dig it up, right?"

"That's natural," Anaïs said with a smile. "Those players who saved Erool's descendants got permission from the other side and naturally obtained ownership of the mage tower. You just bought the theoretical ownership from the other side. As long as you dig up the mage tower, you'll naturally become its owner."

"Actually, Erool intentionally destroyed the tower and let time take its course, allowing the territory owner to have partial ownership. But I don't mind, so feel free to dig it up."

The mage tower, in the end, is a matter of great importance.

So, Zhao Xuan did not want to leave any flaws in the process, and when he heard Anni's words, he felt relieved.

If a group of adventurers were to break into the tower and plunder its contents, it would also be logical to claim ownership. After all, the tower had been abandoned for a long time and was considered unclaimed property.

However, if those adventurers wanted to claim that they owned the mage tower, they would have to go through a lot of trouble.

This was also why Xiao Jian had given up all claims to the tower from the beginning, because only the Mage Association could take it.

However, there was a precondition: "digging" it out.

Thirty kilometers, Zhao Xuan and his team walked in the wilderness for a day, and even if they were exhausted, it would only be this distance.

The Earth's crust is about 30 kilometers thick, with granite on the outside and basalt on the inside. Arthur's estimate of the Earth's surface is similar.

This means that the mage tower was hidden 30 kilometers deep in the rocks.

Zhao Xuan couldn't help but furrow his brows, "Teacher, the mage tower hasn't been flattened by the movement of the Earth's crust?"

Earthquakes mostly propagate through the Earth's crust. He didn't want to find out that he had finally descended 30 kilometers underground only to discover a ruined mage tower that had been crushed and torn apart.

"You think it's possible?" Anni's tone was cheerful.

No, it's just a legendary mage, Zhao Xuan thought grumpily.

At this time, Anni turned her head to look at Zhao Xuan, her eyes shining brightly in the night like stars.
Here is the translation of the text:

"As soon as you have a way to dive into the bottom of the earth 30 kilometers deep, you can go in and search for treasures. As soon as you have a way to dig it out, you will have the qualification to own such a wizard tower."

Zhao Xu's brow furrowed as he listened to An Ti Niya's words, which divided into "findable" and "diggable" steps. The first step alone was not so easy to achieve. The current technology of humans on Earth could only drill to a depth of 12 kilometers at most.

Zhao Xu immediately reviewed all the spells he knew. To directly reach the bottom of the earth 30 kilometers deep, he would probably have to rely on the "Teleportation Spell" and also cast the "Soul Stone Path Spell" immediately, or he would be crushed by the rocks.

However, the five-ring "Teleportation Spell" scroll was not difficult for Zhao Xu to obtain. He just needed to prepare thoroughly and make himself extremely familiar with the target location, or he might teleport to a similar area and even meet with disaster.

"What treasures are there in the wizard tower?" Zhao Xu asked, needing to confirm his strength.

If there was nothing inside, he would be wasting two five-ring scrolls by going in.

"At least, there are no lack of high-ring spell scrolls," An Ti Niya replied.

After listening, Zhao Xu thought to himself that this was indeed worth trying.

"Yes, since you want to use the five-ring teleportation spell to take a shortcut, you need to go back to Mistral and do your homework again to research the details of the wizard tower," An Ti Niya said.

An Ti Niya immediately understood Zhao Xu's intentions, "Well, why don't you accumulate some experience in Mistral and successfully level up before going to the wizard tower? I'll arrange a teaching job for you in the meantime, since you're already level 5."

"What does leveling up mean?" Zhao Xu asked in surprise.
You're not already got that notebook, have you?

Anniya's gaze fell on the lead box in Zhao Xu's hand at this moment.
