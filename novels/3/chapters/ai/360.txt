Chapter 361: The White World

At this moment, Zhao Xu walked up to the dilapidated building, about 20 meters from it. He began to take out a divine scripture from his backpack.

The people behind him thought he was going to flip through the scripture, clear his thoughts, and possibly ward off evil spirits. They didn't ask any questions, but instead let out a few sarcastic remarks.

However, Zhao Xu took off his sacred badge and tightly attached it to the scripture. Then, he used the heavenly language to recite a sacred oath.

Although Zheng Xin and Eliot could understand the content of Zhao Xu's oath, the others felt a sense of harmony and relaxation as the oath was recited in the heavenly language, with its rhythmic and balanced tone. It was as if they could feel Zhao Xu's aura more strongly.

After Zhao Xu finished reciting the oath, the curse in the oath was simultaneously activated.

A holy energy wave burst forth directly from the scripture and was amplified by the worn-out sacred badge, spreading outwards.

Everyone in the scene suddenly felt as if they were receiving a gentle whisper from the goddess in their ear, making their ears feel relaxed.

【Adventurer X, you have cast the "Praise" spell ("Spell Duration: 24 hours, originally 1 round/level"). Your attack, defense, and saving throws have been increased by +3 luck, effective for 24 hours.]

"Ah?" The people in the scene suddenly couldn't help but exclaim in surprise.

The non-warrior knights, although unaware of the buff state, still felt the enhancement to their abilities.
Here is the translation:

While the warrior-born guard captain, Chuck, also saw a message on his panel, he didn't understand the magic content, so he could only see the specific numerical values.

"Nothing, I just cast the 'Praise' spell on everyone just now," Zhao Xu explained, and he also briefly explained the basic abilities of the blessing.

The other knights listened with blank expressions, except for Betty, the commander of the squad, and Chuck, who had a keen gaze, deeply looking at the Summer Mage, Zhao Xu.

"How is that?" Zheng Xin'an didn't fully understand the numerical concepts, and he saw Elton's incredulous expression.

Elton stayed silent for a moment before whispering, "The attack has been strengthened by 3 levels, equivalent to carrying a +3 magic weapon, except that there is no additional damage. And the defense has also been increased by 3 levels, equivalent to a 9,000-gold cloak of resistance."

"And there is also a 3-level defense, can't you understand? Your previous scale mail shirt was only 3 levels, after all."

"What's more important is that this can be stacked. There is an added bonus from fortune, and an increase in the power of fate. However, without the shared faith of the goddess, it is only increased by 2 levels. Only with the shared faith of the goddess is it increased by 3 levels."

"So, 'Praise' is a very good missionary spell, but I won't dare to say that out loud."

As Elton had been interacting with Zhao Xu for a few days, he had also realized that Zhao Xu might actually have a special channel to cast arcane arts.

And he suddenly thought about the fact that Zhao Xu could make him a mage.

The Mage Association cannot make an ordinary person a mage, but the goddess of magic can.

This speculation made him's heart palpitate, and he was even more determined to follow Zhao Xu's orders.
Here is the translation of the text:

At this time, Zhao Xu turned around to take a glance, confirming that everyone had received his blessing before nodding slightly.

The blessing was a spell with a range of 18 meters centered on himself, a type of spell that fixed the distance around himself. This spell was coincidentally suitable for "Spell Duration Extension".

Furthermore, enemies within the spell's range would receive the same punishment in three aspects, making attacks and defense in two aspects, and repeating this process six times.

In reality, the people behind were unable to imagine that the three-ring "Blessing" provided by Zhao Xu would not only increase the duration of the spell, but also prolong it to 24 hours.

The duration was generally around 30 seconds.

Now, Zhao Xu used "Spell Duration Extension" to stretch the time to 24 hours, making the intensity directly explosive.

However, the remaining exclamations had to wait until they returned to Mistral and talked to people to react.

At this moment, Zhao Xu did not stop his footsteps, directly casting another spell.

【Adventurer Zhongxia, you cast the three-ring "Dragon Skin" (Spell Duration Extension) on yourself, gaining a 5-level innate defense enhancement bonus, gaining fire resistance 20, and a duration of 24 hours (originally 10 minutes per level).】

Suddenly, his entire body was covered by the cloak, and a "Dragon Scale" layer was directly presented.

This spell, mimicking the scales of a dragon's skin, had already increased Zhao Xu's defense value to 26 levels.

4-level armor bonus (Magic Armor).
4-level shield bonus (Shield Spell).
3-level holy bonus (Blessing).
5-level innate defense bonus (Dragon Skin).
Here is the translation of the text:

With four spells that last almost a day stacked, Zhao Xu is essentially at the top of the defensive ability among current players in this day. Even after upgrading to higher-level spells, Zhao Xu can continue to stack up in agility, evasion, perception, awareness, and avoidance from various aspects. Just for the sake of entering this mysterious old house, Zhao Xu has made multiple preparations. However, in reality, a mage battle is like this - before the battle, the mage is already in a state of full buffs, and the actual battle is just a fleeting moment. Therefore, with Zhao Xu's defense stacked to 26 levels, paired with the Starlight Cloak and a damage-reducing outer skin, facing a level 9 demon granny is indeed very difficult. Currently, Zhao Xu also has the means to enhance his defense, allowing it to surpass the demon granny's attack by a full 20 levels, making it possible for the opponent to only attack him with perfect timing. However, Zhao Xu has not yet reached his full potential, and using the "Dragon Skin" spell from the third ring, he is already a bit torn, and can only give up other enhancements that are not significantly improved. At this time, Zhao Xu turned back to look at Chuck, who was holding a giant sword in his hand, and said, "Try to stab me with your sword." "Sir?" Chuck's guardian looked back at Zhao Xu with some confusion. "Is this alright?" Mrs. Betty, who was standing beside him, also expressed concern. Although Zhongxu had just given everyone a blessing, Chuck's attack had also been enhanced, and the luck brought by the spell would affect him, making it easier for him to attack Zhao Xu's weak points.
Eilton furrowed his brows and said, "Go ahead, Chuck, lead the way. You can actually pierce through Mr. Zhao's defense, but he's just checking the actual effect of his spell beforehand."

He knew that Zhongxue had just stacked up mage armor and shield magic on them.

When he heard this and saw Zhongxue's gaze, Chuck clenched his teeth and tightly gripped the thick, massive sword in his hand.

Attack ability was said to be mysterious, but in reality, it was an evaluation of each person's attacking ability. It was the kind of ability that could see the bottom line, even if one swung a sword wildly.

Like Chuck, who had a foundation similar to that, he could only see specific performance (1-20 levels). Even if he didn't perform well, he could still crush ordinary people's defenses.

Having received warrior training, Chuck's own attack power was only 1 level, but his arm strength was not bad, and after adding 14 points of strength, his attack was worthy of being a top-notch guardian.

As soon as the sword was unsheathed, a loud "whooshing" sound echoed through the empty land, and nearby birds flew away in fright.

Even Mrs. Betty was surprised that Chuck was actually using this sword, and she could see that the opponent's swordplay was not bad.

Just like a ram with horns, he could bring some subtle angles to the attack, directly targeting Zhao's ribcage.

Ordinary people couldn't resist, and they could only rely on dodging and taking a chance.

However, Zhao remained still, unaffected by the attack.

This powerful attack, which had just shocked Zhongxue's mage knights, was now met with Chuck's astonished expression, who exclaimed, "Is this the power of magic?"
Here is the translation of the text:

As soon as he heard this sentence, everyone noticed that Chuck's arms were tense, his massive sword trembling as he tried to push it forward, but to no avail. The sword's quivering revealed the extent of his effort and frustration.

"It's fine," said Zhao Xiu.

At this moment, Chuck's massive sword suddenly dropped to the ground, his arms still shaking with tension, indicating that he had used too much force and couldn't control it.

Chuck had heard about the incredible powers of wizards, even witnessing the impressive abilities of the members of the Purple Bamboo Guild. However, in his opinion, wizards were only able to achieve greater feats by reaching beyond their limits.

But he couldn't have imagined that a wizard, without any armor, in a simple robe, would be able to stop his massive sword from advancing.

After a brief pause, Chuck picked up his long sword and finally understood why his wife had secretly obtained the recommendation letter from the wizard family to send his son to the Floating City to learn magic.

It was only when he defeated his opponent in their own domain that a wizard's true power was revealed.

After verifying the effectiveness of his own defensive magic, Zhao Xiu turned around and entered the old, dilapidated cottage.

The wooden door, half-burned and leaning on the doorframe, was about to collapse at any moment.

Chuck followed him in and, according to Zhao Xiu's instructions, lifted his massive sword and struck it against the doorframe with a loud creak, causing the door to break off and fall to the ground.

The muffled sound did not elicit any response from within the room.

Zhao Xiu led the way forward, while those behind him, carrying their shortbows, continuously scanned their surroundings, alert for any potential threats.
Here is the translation:

Unexpectedly, there were no windows opened inside, and the light did not shine through. Suddenly, darkness enveloped the team.

Zhao Xu lightly tapped the one-meter-long staff on the top.

Under the zero-ring spell "Luminous" effect, his super-magical staff seemed to have turned into a torch, emitting a soft and gentle light that spread out, illuminating the surrounding area within a range of about 6-7 meters.

Slowly, the others behind him also pushed their way in, each holding a torch and looking at the already desolate interior of the house.

The sofas and chairs in the living room were mostly reduced to their frames, scattered on the floor, and the handcrafted wooden cabinets were burned beyond recognition.

"It looks like a fire-bombed abandoned house," Chuck said.

But just as he finished speaking, all the torches in everyone's hands suddenly lost their light, as if an invisible and deep darkness had swallowed them whole.

"Ah, welcome to visit," a raspy and ear-piercing voice came from the darkness, like fingernails scratching on a blackboard.

"Ah, it's that old witch!" one of the riders suddenly shouted, recalling the local legend.

"However," Zhao Xu chuckled and shouted out a mysterious password.

All the companions in the scene heard it, although they couldn't understand it. However, they all felt like they had suddenly grasped the old witch's weakness.

【Adventure, you use "Dark Knowledge (Tactic)" (Level 1 ability), Knowledge (Plane) check through. You and your companions gain a +3 attack bonus, dealing 3 points of damage, lasting 1 minute.】

Based on the previous 3rd-level praise spell, Chuck and others exclaimed, "Another 3rd-level attack boost!"
Here is the translation of the text into English:

At this moment, everyone's mind was filled with the thought that, although they had never seen a creature like Old Witch before, they somehow knew how to attack their opponent's weaknesses. Meanwhile, the 6th-grade upgrade had already created a significant gap in basic combat ability between a 6th-grade warrior and a civilian.

However, Zhao Xu had just activated another ability within himself.

[Adventurer Zhongxia, you use your knowledge virtue (knowledge domain replacement) to make a knowledge (plane) check, and you gain a +2 attack bonus, increasing your damage by 2 points.]

In an instant, Zhao Xu relied on this professional skill to elevate himself to the next level.

Adding it all up, he had effectively gained an 8-level attack upgrade, equivalent to wielding a +5 magic weapon.

While wizards rarely need to use physical attacks, they do possess various line-of-sight spells that require aiming at enemies. As such, attack power also has some value for Zhao Xu.

Old Witch, lurking in the shadows, let out a cold snort. With her dark vision, she was unaffected by the darkness. It was as if she had already sensed the greatest threat in the area was Zhao Xu, and she directly pointed at him and released a spell.

"Sleep spell!"

A very ordinary spell, it could only put a person to sleep for 1 minute per level, with a 2-3-meter radius of residual magic. At this moment, the teammates were gathered around Zhao Xu, as if he had found safety here, but unfortunately, they were all covered by the limited range of the "Sleep spell".

In an instant, the sound of people falling to the ground came from behind Zhao Xu. However, since Zhao Xu was a 6th-grade character, he was above the 4-life die limit that a spell could affect, and he was not affected at all.
Here is the translation of the text:

But others, especially those ordinary soldiers, were basically knocked down by this tactic. At this moment, Zhao Xu was completely calm and knew that the old witch was not just a simple template, but had also evolved beyond that. Therefore, the enemy's "sleep spell" had such great power, directly knocking out most of our troops.

Everyone seemed to be sleeping, and all it would take to break this spell was to shake them awake one by one. However, at this moment, they had no time to do that. This made Elton very anxious. He didn't know whether to attack the enemy with the team or wake up the sleeping soldiers.

Zhao Xu was completely unfazed. Suddenly, he let out a soft crowing sound like a rooster announcing dawn. The sound wave lingered, triggering a sense of unease in people, and shattered their dreams, directly waking up everyone in a sleeping state.

Deerui's zero-ring divine art "Break of Dawn"!

At the same time, Zhao Xu had already prepared his second spell and waved his hand to touch the still-standing "Zheng Xin Yu". "Second-ring sacred magic - Luminous Shield".

Zheng Xin Yu's original intangible armor was directly loaded with a more powerful luminous armor. A team of protective light spirits flashed with a protective aura, directly shielding her. Meanwhile, the armor itself also suddenly released the power of the three-ring spell "Daybreak Art".
The instant the entire dilapidated room was illuminated like a bright day, the intense and sudden light burst forth, spreading to every corner, banishing the darkness that had once engulfed the space. Cock-a-doodle-doo, the rooster's loud cry echoed throughout the land.
