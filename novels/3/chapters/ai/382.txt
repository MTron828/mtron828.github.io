Chapter 383: Vivian's Output

As others in the scene were still pondering the specific meaning of the diagram, Zhao Xu had already begun analyzing various possibilities in his mind.

In the past, the seven people who had obtained seven notebooks from the cemetery had returned to Mistral, with three families - Yasa, Andre, and Erol - being the respective heads of the three families.

During this time, Zhao Xu had also obtained the notebooks of the three families in an orderly manner, effortlessly leveling up twice.

However, the other four adventurers had no idea about this.

It was only known that the current leader of the Northern Alliance, Tang De, had a notebook in his possession, which was obtained through his daughter.

The giant sorcerer also had a notebook in his possession, which was being held captive in the underground of the Star Lake.

At present, both notebooks seemed difficult to resolve, so Zhao Xu did not spend too much time thinking about it.

Who would have thought that he would suddenly encounter the whereabouts of the mysterious notebooks in this desolate wasteland, where the undead were attacking?

He immediately cleared the obstacles to his current leveling up, just like his "poetic acting" style.

The mage's acting style was also simple: reading ancient books, browsing through moldy ancient scrolls, and arguing with others about magical theories.

Magic is not innate, but rather a skill learned through hard work - a group of natural mages would say.

This is also the reason why the pioneers of the pre-war warrior troops could reach level 10, while the mage could only reach level 5.

The broad player model of playing as a mage is not the true style of a mage.

Therefore, Zhao Xu also relied on the "notebook" to break through.
Here is the translation of the text:

Even later, he felt that he could only rely on this path to maintain his advantage over the current player.

He gazed at the corpses that he had awakened with magic, lost in thought.

How was the demon tied to the notebook?

And besides, considering the notebook in the northern alliance, it's three books, which is equal to Mistral.

He knew that there must be a secret here.

It had gone beyond coincidence.

But he didn't know where to start.

After Zhao Xu stepped down from his position, other adventurers also rushed over to surround the corpse, asking their own questions.

The "Dead Man's Conversation" spell lasted for minutes, summoning the imprint of the deceased's soul left in the body.

It could be known through the spell all the knowledge of the deceased's life, but it was impossible to know any new information.

So, the dead had no secrets.

"Chief, have you got a lead?" Velian whispered to Zhao Xu, secretly communicating with him through their mental link.

The two of them stood at the edge of the tent, avoiding the crowd in front of them, while Velian held her longsword at the ready, prepared to strike at any sudden movement.

At any moment, she might strike with her "Slaying Cut".

Zhao Xu, on the other hand, was looking at the corpse surrounded by people, muttering to himself: "I'm thinking, why is it this bard?"

"Or maybe because he's the least like an escapee," Velian said. "Although the opponent's muscles are frozen in a state of shock, you can still see that they were very happy in life."

"It's just that death came too quickly for them to switch to a state of complete shock."

Zhao Xu suddenly burst forward, pushing his way through the crowd.
Here is the translation of the text:

Among the white flowers of the day, Vivian killed someone, and in the evening, Zhao Xiu performed a ritual and passed down the poet's upgraded secret. Wherever he went, everyone else would step aside.

After taking a deep breath, Zhao Xiu asked the poet's corpse, "What did you dream about?"

Dreams are a mysterious existence. Once you become aware that you are dreaming, you will wake up. However, if you are aware that you are dreaming but cannot wake up, you can become the creator of the dream world, which is the origin of the "Qingming Dream" method.

The poet's corpse smiled silently a few times before speaking up: "I dreamed that I went back to my hometown and proposed to someone I love. Because I went through this desolate land, I can meet her. So I put on my most beautiful dress to show her."

This topic seemed to strike a chord in the corpse, and he continued to talk about it nonstop.

Until another question from someone else interrupted.

"It seems to be joy or a dream that makes him a target," Zhao Xiu thought to himself and then told Vivian.

He slowly presented his arguments, and Vivian listened attentively and nodded in agreement.

"Ah——"

Suddenly, a loud scream came from outside the tent.

In an instant, all the adventurers in the tent, numbering two or three levels, rushed out to see what was happening.

They saw an middle-aged woman in tattered clothing kneeling beside a corpse of similar age, wailing loudly and cursing, "Why did you abandon our family? And why did you sleep through such a dangerous time?"
Here is the translation:

The old couple who ran a tofu stall in Lugou Bridge was planning to move to a bigger city this time, so they set off when the storm blew in. The old man was feeling a bit tired, dozed off for a moment, and then died suddenly with the same symptoms.

As the truth dawned on everyone, a terrifying thought crept into every mind: they couldn't sleep. Some children who had played too much during the day were now sitting on the ground, struggling to keep their eyes open and suddenly being shaken awake by their parents.

As the next autopsy began, everyone received the same conclusion as the first corpse. But the bonfire still burned fiercely, casting a warm glow over everyone's faces, revealing their weariness and fatigue. Everyone had been exhausted from the day's tedium, and it was even worse at night.

What was originally supposed to be a simple overnight watch had turned into an all-night battle. With no idea how to counterattack, everyone could only continue to huddle together, yet dared not venture out into the desolate wasteland at night.

Zhao Xu followed several others to give the widow a condolence offering and then returned to their tent entrance. Viennese leaned against the ground, her eyes fixed on Zhao Xu with a gentle gaze, never leaving his side for a moment.

"Viennese, do you feel happy now?" Zhao Xu asked.
As Saint Warrior Vivian, she had a thought process that was racing through her mind, "Since Lady May led me to understand the grand and eternal truth of God, I have undergone a profound change in my camp and have been in a state of unparalleled peace of mind."

"From that moment on until now, I have been able to feel that every pore on my body is rejoicing, that kind of feeling that is filled with tears of joy due to the beauty of life, and it often lingers in my body."

"It's just that I don't know if this feeling is consistent with the joy you mentioned."

Vivian hesitated slightly and asked.

Suddenly, with a hint of a smile, Zhao Xiu came over to Vivian's side, "So you don't mind if I do a simple and harmless experiment to confirm that you are indeed in a state of joy?"

Although her task was to solely protect Mr. Zhong Xia, she couldn't help but think about cooperating with Zhao Xiu. Vivian nodded seriously and then followed Zhao Xiu's instructions, closing her eyes.

However, she didn't expect to receive a gentle touch on her forehead instead of an opening of her clothes. The Three-ring technique. Refining joy!

"It's done, you are indeed in a state of happiness," Zhao Xiu said.

At this moment, Vivian opened her eyes, looking puzzled, and saw Zhao Xiu holding a glass bottle filled with transparent liquid.

"What is this? Samael's food?" Vivian whispered, looking at the liquid that had been extracted from her body, knowing it was normal but still feeling a little shy.

Zhao Xiu sighed and explained, "I've tasted this kind of thing before. During the war with the heavenly realm, Lady Nightfall obtained this batch of materials, so I've tried it too."

The liquid in Zhao Xiu's bottle was the exhausted happiness extracted from Vivian's body using magic.
Only on their bodies, happiness, joy, and happiness will overflow and be collected through magic.

"If the opponent's goal is happiness, then this vial of happiness in my hand is the bait."
Zhao Xu explained to Wei Wei, gently placing the glass bottle on the ground, then standing up.
Just then, a hand suddenly poked out of the void.
