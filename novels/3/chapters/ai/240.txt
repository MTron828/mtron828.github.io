Chapter 241: Magical Notes

After Zhao Xu thought through his plan for the night, he directly began to use the class skill "Transformation" granted by Artesia.
Instantly, he transformed into a pastor-like figure wearing a board-armor.
Under Zhao Xu's deliberate arrangement, he assigned his reputation as a 4th-level mage to the account "Starlight Reflection".
As for his new transformed appearance, it was that of a magic goddess pastor born from King Arthur.
In the end, it's still a pastor who is good at talking, so even if he goes to the Mineral Association, he can still receive VIP treatment.
For tonight's infiltration plan, Zhao Xu thought about it and decided to use the "Wind" identity. He planned to basically use various high-level divine magic spells.
When those spells appeared on the 4th-level mage's body, they would be quite incongruous.
After thinking about it, Zhao Xu stood up and prepared to extinguish the fire ahead.
Just as he was looking at the flames, he suddenly thought of Zhang Qi and others.
He had originally planned to take care of them, but was interrupted by the discomfort of his real body.
However, since it was so, Zhao Xu decided to ask about Zhang Qi's progress.
After breaking through the "Falling Star Lake" town, he would definitely collect the first batch of valuable items as the most agile player at that time.
As for the remaining armor and weapons, he thought they took up too much space.
So, he arranged for Zhang Qi to rush into the treasure room first and collect those weapons and equipment.
As the top-level mage, Zhao Xu thought about what he could do without any difficulty.
It was just like the night he and Lei An went to find Andy's whereabouts.
Here is the translation:

One method is the four-ring spell "Biological Positioning", but it has the disadvantage of being detectable and can be deceived by illusions. Another method is the eight-ring "Sense Positioning", which has fewer restrictions on its accuracy. However, unless the opponent has the eight-ring "Mind Shield" or a magical artifact, it will not work.

Zhao Xu ultimately used the illusionary spell to simulate a high-level spell. After completing the "Sense Positioning" spell, a flood of information surged into Zhao Xu's mind, allowing him to immediately determine the exact location of Zhang Qi.

Zhao Xu had already walked the terrain around "Falling Star Lake" and even brought people to search for the bodies of murder victims on the lake's surface near where Zhang Qi and others were located. However, Zhao Xu did not recklessly teleport there to take a look.

A well-prepared mage is a long-lived mage. He directly took out a bowl from his backpack, and without hesitation, poured in a bottle of 25 gold coins' holy water, just enough to cover the surface with a thin layer.

"Advanced Perception".

After completing a simple spellcasting action, a sacred glow emerged from Zhao Xu's fingertips, similar to a waterfall slowly pouring into the bowl.

He was casting the seven-ring "Advanced Perception" spell, which is not significantly different from the five-ring "Perception" spell. However, the seven-ring spell can ensure that certain "detection" type spells can be cast through this bowl. The seven-ring spell only requires one standard action, unlike the five-ring spell which takes an entire hour, and has no peer in terms of convenience.

As long as the target does not succeed in resisting the spell through a saving throw, the person casting the spell will be able to see the target through water or a mirror from a distance, but the field of view is limited to a 3-meter radius around the target.
Here is the translation of the text:

Many unscrupulous wizards took great pleasure in using this technique to spy on others, so corresponding shielding spells and counterfeit spells also came into being.

As the water's surface began to ripple and change, reflecting the night sky, a new scene unfolded - Zhang Qi lay on the ground, his entire body covered in blood, and his girlfriend, the priestess Feng Ge, was frantically trying to resuscitate him.

Zhao Xu's face also contorted in concern as he saw Zhang Qi's uncertain state.

Zhao Xu thought for a moment before directly re-casting a limited-duration spell on himself, then simulated the "Higher Teleportation" spell and teleported himself to Zhang Qi's location.

From then on, he was posing as a high-ranking priest of the Goddess Church.

..."Hurry up and escape!" a blood-stained paladin weakly cried out to his comrades.

But he was lying on the ground, just recovering from a near-death state, with a massive gash on his entire suit of armor and his heavy warhorse nearby, looking like he was on the verge of collapse.

"We can't escape," another male priest standing behind him shook his head and said.

He was also exhausted after multiple battles, his arms barely able to hold onto his staff, and his "+1" heavy steel shield had a significant crack.

The priestess of the Goddess was gasping for breath, feeling the searing heat in her chest.

Behind him, only a few players were still standing, including his classmates, such as Cui Lu.

However, the number of people had decreased by more than half compared to what Zhao Xu saw the day before, and it was clear that those who had disappeared were the ones who had returned to the Creation Temple to report.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Robin the priest, we've put you all in a difficult situation," said Liu Lu, who was also exhausted, having taken on the remote shooting position to ensure their survival.

Robin the priest shook his head, saying, "I have dedicated myself to the glory of the goddess, and it is our honor to do so."

He had used most of his magic to aid fallen players and his companion, a level 5 paladin named Aet, who was also a 5-level paladin.

In reality, they were unable to inflict significant damage on the giant ahead.

The giant's overwhelming power caused most of their team members to fall in just one or two rounds.

The giant, which resembled a giant human with pale purple skin and mysterious symbols etched all over its body, was now approaching them. Its massive size, over 7-8 meters tall, and weight of over 6 tons, caused the ground to shake with each step it took.

Moreover, the giant's sword, almost 3 meters long, was terrifying, and if it landed a hit without any defense, it would be easy to cut someone in half.

Robin and his team had just finished fighting off a group of assassins who had snuck up on them, and just as they were about to catch their breath, they unexpectedly encountered the mysterious giant.

Without saying a word, the giant swung its massive sword and performed the "Big Flowing Slash" technique, knocking out the entire first wave of their teammates.
Here is the translation of the text:

Immediately after that, the giant launched a powerful magic missile that directly targeted five players with extremely high life values, putting them on the brink of death.

After confirming that the small team was unable to retaliate, the giant suddenly teleported to another location to annihilate another small team. This giant was an opponent that they couldn't possibly match.

As the giant approached Robin's position, even from a distance of several meters, its massive body and armor already exerted a tremendous psychological pressure on Robin.

"Hand over your arcane notebook, and maybe I'll spare your lives," the giant said.

"I'm a priest," Robin replied with a bad temper. "Where did I get a magical notebook?"

"As a priest of the goddess of magic, don't you even know the secrets of magic?" the giant asked, shaking its head. "Then you can join them in reporting for duty."

As the giant said this, it raised its massive sword, which still emitted a cold aura. The sword suddenly descended.

The players on the side had already cried out in shock, but it was too late to avoid the impending tragedy. The holy warrior in the distance could only grit his teeth and watch in horror.

Suddenly, Robin disappeared instantly, as if he had never existed.

The giant's heavy sword struck the ground with tremendous force, creating a crater in the stone.

Or rather, it wasn't just Robin.

The entire team was mysteriously transported to a location about 30 meters behind them, as if they had been moved like chess pieces. The giant also maintained a safe distance from the front.

However, the giant showed no surprise. Its gaze fell on the priest who had just appeared.

The giant's profound magical knowledge made it clear that this priest had used a five-ring arcane spell "Dimensional Teleportation" to forcibly relocate the team members about 30 meters away.
Here is the translation of the text:

As it turned out, the mysterious pastor standing closest to him was the one who had suddenly appeared. "Mr. Feng, is that you?" Just as Cui Lu had stood up, she recognized that the pastor standing in front of her was none other than the mysterious Feng who had disappeared mysteriously last night. She had not expected him to appear at such a critical moment and save them.

Robin, who had met Cui Lu's team just today, was also looking curiously at the pastor in front of him, who shared his faith.

Not bothering to express his gratitude for being saved, he shouted loudly, "This giant is very dangerous, with the ability to manipulate portals and nullify magic boundaries."

After hearing the pastor's hint from behind him, Zhao Xu just smiled faintly. In reality, he had already known what was in front of him through his knowledge and skills that exceeded level 30.

"Magic Goddess Pastor Feng," Zhao Xu introduced himself, looking at the giant in front of him.

"That's Taliar," the giant in front of him said, as if he was very interested in Zhao Xu.

"What kind of 'arcane knowledge' can the mine owners bring out to ask you to come here?" Zhao Xu couldn't help but ask.

The giant in front of him, with a challenge level of over 15, was still not satisfied and was still pursuing the power of magic. Except for the wind giant, few of them would fight with other races.

Just now, he had hastily cast "Dimensional Pull" to pull away the Magic Goddess Pastor Feng. In reality, it was because the giant's attack power, which was only one sword, exceeded 30 levels and directly crushed everyone in the scene.

Adding to the fact that he was holding a genuine super-large sword, there were hardly anyone in the scene who could withstand the damage.
Here is the translation:

"My research has led me to predict that the priest of the magical goddess appearing here will have an extremely important occult notebook on their person," the wicked giant said with a hint of detachment.

He then swung the heavy sword in his hand, brandishing it with an unprecedented fierce atmosphere, charging at Zhao Xu.

Zhao Xu is also a priestess of the goddess, making her his target of attack.
