Chapter 118: Shape-Shifting

Several wizards standing around Tak were initially indifferent, thinking that Tak was like a bull knife cutting through a chicken. However, when they saw Zhao Xu begin to unleash powerful magical energy, the lead 5th-level wizard's jaw dropped in shock, completely stunned.

"What's going on with my spell recognition?" the 4th-level wizard whispered behind him.

"Shut up, we're done for," the 5th-level wizard gritted his teeth, unsure of what to do.

Even offending the head of the North Castle Wizards' Association wouldn't be enough to make him this anxious.

Because, after all, this was a 9th-level spell.

Without using a scroll or the "Magic Device" skill, he could still cast this spell, a feat he had never seen in his lifetime.

No matter how he questioned the Magic Goddess about why she was so fond of the person in front of him, he couldn't hide his inner fear.

At this moment, he also couldn't help but glance at Tak, who was still gritting his teeth beside him, his face ashen as if he had already figured it out.

For centuries, countless noble families had thrived and produced offspring, with the first rule being to remember not to offend someone who shouldn't be offended.

As the center of the storm, Zhao Xu was drenched in rain, but it was impossible to bring down his temperature.

This 9th-level spell, Shape-Shifting, was only second to the ultimate transformation spell of the Shepherd, allowing him to transform into any non-unique creature with a maximum HD (life die) of 25.

Additionally, he could also acquire the special abilities and supernatural abilities of the creatures he transformed into.
Zhao Xu's physique had become enormous, almost three meters tall, and his weight had increased to over half a ton. However, the massive and snow-white angel-like wings behind him seemed to have limitless power, and after just a few flaps, he was lifted into the air. Meanwhile, a gigantic sword hovering in mid-air appeared in front of him, and a composite longbow also appeared in his hand. Zhao Xu was filled with a sense of sacredness. Even more remarkable was the mysterious and powerful aura surrounding his entire body.

As he stood there, even some devout knights of the heavy armor would kneel down before him, as if he had become the embodiment of a divine messenger.

"Could it be that he's the Divine Servant of the Fiery Heaven?" muttered the 5th-level mage to himself.

The Divine Servant of the Fiery Heaven is the most powerful angel.

Anastasia, the former owner of the book, had once given Zhao Xu the ability to transform into a being of the corresponding species. This transformation would allow him to acquire various static data of the corresponding species. Although it was seen as useless by many mages, it was extremely suitable for Zhao Xu. At this moment, even without using special abilities, he was stronger than a 20th-level warrior.

With his wings spread, Zhao Xu directly targeted Tak as his target and took off in a flash. For the first time, he felt the thrill of flying, which he had only watched 5th-level mages do before. Although his agility was not yet perfect and he couldn't perform extreme and difficult actions, Zhao Xu's speed was five times that of an ordinary person, allowing him to kill Tak in an instant.

"Kill him quickly!" Tak shouted in shock and despair.
At the beginning, a few wizards nearby, led by a 5th-level wizard, had already fled when Zhao Xu made a sudden dash towards them. They were even too afraid to cast a basic protective spell to avoid drawing Zhao Xu's attention. However, Zhao Xu didn't care about this, as his powerful stats as a heavenly servant made him invulnerable. His magical defense was as high as 31 points, and even a 12th-level wizard couldn't affect him with magic.

But Zhao Xu didn't need to rely on his magical defense, because the moment he transformed into an angel, his entire body was surrounded by a protective aura. The aura directly became a barrier that repelled evil and was ineffective against secondary magic. The barrier also moved with him.

No wizard below 7th level could pose a threat to him. Suddenly, an arrow shot towards Zhao Xu, but it was blocked by his skin, leaving no mark. His skin was like a natural armor, just like a dragon's scales.

Zhao Xu turned around and looked at the archer who had shot the arrow, who had already fled into the crowd. Zhao Xu had previously cast two level 1 spells to raise his defense level by 8 levels, but now that he had transformed into a heavenly servant, he was invulnerable to ordinary attacks. His innate defense, which was 21 levels high, could intimidate anyone, unless there were a few high-level warriors with magical weapons present. Otherwise, no one could breach his defense.

Zhao Xu's eyes immediately noticed the archer who had tried to attack him, and he raised his hand, shooting an arrow directly at the opponent.
The thunderous sound of the arrow shattered the air, as if it had pierced a vacuum. Even with the layers of rain curtains in front, it seemed to have created a trail. Zhao Xu didn't even glance at them, his attacks of 20-30 levels above, rendering even the armored knights as fragile as paper. The damage caused by the arrows was so devastating that even if an opponent could withstand it, they would still have to endure the instant kill effect of the arrow itself. In general, these low-level knights couldn't withstand this effect.

Each time Zhao Xu drew his bow, he was tolling the death knell for each knight. The knights, seeing Zhao Xu's arrow piercing the sky and breaking through armor, would have heart attacks after being struck, and no one dared to continue fighting. This was a world that believed in the divine.

At this time, the young man in the robe, Taku, had also woken up to his senses and began to flee frantically. However, no matter how fast he rode his horse, he couldn't catch up to Zhao Xu, who was directly closing the distance with one leap.

At this time, the loyal servant of the Taku family, who had been trained from a young age, stood up with courage, raised his shield, and tried to shield Taku from Zhao Xu's attack.

Zhao Xu, whose heart was completely dominated by a sense of indifference, directly controlled the giant sword flying through the air, aiming at the loyal servant. This sword, which was the top-level +5 Dance Giant Sword, had gained the ability to attack independently after being activated by Zhao Xu, and within 24 seconds, it was equivalent to Zhao Xu holding an attack.

Zhao Xu, freeing his hands, held the +2 composite longbow in his hands, began to shoot arrows one by one, using the instant kill effect of the killing arrows to mercilessly slaughter the knights who had taken on the role of executioners.
Here is the translation:

Just as they would pierce the heart of a merchant's escort with a single sword stroke, the giant sword danced in the air, instantly piercing the shield of the dead servant and killing him on the spot.

At that moment, the divine servant's specialty, which Zhao Xuan had not mastered in his previous life, was triggered. The giant sword seemed to gain immense spirituality, and under the immense gravitational force, it slashed towards another heavy-armed knight who was approaching.

The opponent's entire armor was unable to withstand Zhao Xuan's almost 35-level close combat attack power, and it was directly broken open and killed on the spot. After successfully killing another person with the giant sword, the specialty "Powerful Stroke" was triggered again.

In just a few seconds, a normal soldier could only manage to strike at one person once, but the giant sword could kill ten people in a row.

Zhao Xuan's arrow, which had almost 20-level difficulty, shot at the horse's back, causing the horse to collapse and die on the spot. Taku, who had spent half a day meticulously modifying his appearance, was now disheveled, with his hair scattered everywhere. He looked at Zhao Xuan with a pleading expression and begged, "Mercy, I don't know your secrets, it was my mistake."

Having seen countless people beg for mercy and countless people kneel and cry in despair, Taku, who was not lacking in learning examples, had already realized that Zhao Xuan was not some ordinary knight who had been possessed by a divine being. Instead, he had actually cast the ninth-level spell "Body Transformation".

No one knew why this spell could be cast on a normal low-level mage.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

Because no one knows how to attach this technique to ordinary people, it takes 23 days to do so.

As he looked down at the fallen Turk, Zhao Xu's expression was indifferent as he said, "Is there a sword that doesn't see blood?"

"So, go die," he said.

Zhao Xu directly drew his composite longbow, pulled the arrow back, and shot it.

He knew that the instant death effect made the "Revival of the Dead" five-level divine art no longer effective.

No matter how Turk struggled and pulled out the magical items given by his family ancestors, it was still of no use.

The instant death effect is a fair thing for every person.

Live and die.

As Zhao Xu exhaled the breath he had been holding in his chest, he gazed up at the deep sky, where the rain was still falling.

Killing is a very uninteresting thing.

...

The Gate of Ofa.

Twenty days after the game opened, the first batch of players who floated to the sky, including the 1st-level mage players, began to obtain the right to leave the floating city.

The Gate of Ofa, located in Mystera, is the headquarters of the Mage Association, and many players' silhouettes appeared in the usual flow of people.

Without possessing the teleportation spell or being qualified to teleport from the floating city, everyone had to walk through the teleportation gate from the floating city to the Gate of Ofa, and then register to obtain the qualification to enter the floating city.

Therefore, even if many mages have the teleportation spell, they can only teleport to the entrance of the Gate of Ofa and then walk in to register and obtain the qualification to enter the floating city.
Here is the translation of the text:

"What's going on? This person is all wet and soggy, isn't Mr. Strala controlling the weather? It's already impossible for a big storm to occur."

A novice wizard exclaimed in surprise.

As he looked around, he noticed that the person being referred to was walking towards the front desk.

"How can someone look so disheveled? Won't he be kicked out?"

"Because it's not that bad. Look at the wizard's badge on his chest."

"Oh dear, he looks really messy. Why not use some magic to dry off?"

"Heh heh, maybe he hasn't mastered it yet."

Many wizards standing in the corner were whispering and pointing at the wet man.

The man, who was still dripping wet, had already caught the attention of many people. Some wizards with a keen sense of cleanliness looked at the man's wet trail on the floor and shook their heads.

However, the man didn't seem to care about the commotion around him. His expression was cold and unyielding, with rainwater dripping down his face and onto his robes.

As he walked, his footsteps seemed to create a heavy, resonant sound, as if each step was echoing throughout the entire hall.

Slowly but surely, more and more people's gazes fell upon the man, as if he was meant to be this way from birth.

When a staff member sensed someone approaching, he didn't lift his head, but continued to whisper, "Name?"

"Zhong Xia."
