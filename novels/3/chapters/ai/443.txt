Chapter 444, 27th Level Mage

As Zhao Xu came out, he fought a fierce battle all night outside the crater, killing countless enemies before finally taking a short nap. Then, he rushed to meet Anniya, without even taking the time to rest and recover his magic.

Anniya told him to go in and rest, and it would take him more than ten hours to prepare his magic. By the time he finished, it would be dark outside.

"Teacher, this is not good," Zhao Xu said. "Even though Arthur doesn't have the prehistoric concept of men and women, I've been sleeping in the carriage, and it's still not good."

Just then, Anniya's voice came from inside, cold and icy. "Zhong Xia, what are you thinking? Just go in and you'll see."

Despite his confusion, Zhao Xu followed Anniya's advice and stopped the carriage. Then, he crawled inside.

Vivian let out a seat for him to pass through. In the spacious carriage, there was a luxurious bed with a thick mattress and intricate needlework. The deep green fabric was wrapped around a yellow lining, emitting a faint scent of campfire and duck meat, making it feel comforting.

"Go to bed," Anniya instructed simply.

Zhao Xu followed the instruction and suddenly felt a strange sleepiness emanating from the bed. His breathing slowed down gradually.

Zhao Xu had attended a medical lecture and wanted to fall asleep quickly. He adjusted his breathing to match his normal sleeping rhythm, and his slow breathing naturally induced sleepiness.
Here is the translation:

As soon as I lay down like this, I feel this kind of strange effect, almost as if I've been hypnotized. "This is Howard's strengthened bedding, and your backpack is also one of the magical items invented by the great wizard Howard," said someone.

"Once you climb into this bedding, it will activate its magic, and you can experience the effect once a day. You can enjoy a complete hour of sleep and feel the restful effects of eight hours of sleep. Although it can only be activated once a day, you can still feel the effect for 48 hours. "

Zhao Xu couldn't help but touch the smooth surface of his bedding, thinking that this lack of prolonged rest, which is extremely influential in holding back the effects of prolonged battles, can be easily compensated for by this bedding.

Although it's not a big deal for someone like him who has mastered the way to restore "magic points" without limit, it's still useful in changing the overall magic points. For other wizards, it's also a valuable emergency item.

"Don't think too much, sleep," said someone.

Slowly, Anniel nodded and began to sing the lament of King Arthur in a soft, gentle voice, her sorrowful tone like a lullaby.

Vivian also joined in, singing in a heavenly language, and the two harmonious female voices slowly lulled Zhao Xu into a dreamlike state...

One hour of sleep.

One hour of preparation for magic.

One hour of preparation for divine magic.

Even with the "Howard's Strengthened Bedding", it took Zhao Xu three hours to fully restore all his magic.

At this point, he looked at his magic list.

【Magic (Wizard):
Zero Circle: 4 = 4 (Profession)
First Circle: 7 = 4 (Profession) + 3 (Intelligence)
Second Circle: 5 = 3 (Profession) + 2 (Intelligence)
Here is the translation of the text:

The three-ringed: 4 = 2 (profession) + 2 (intelligence)
The four-ringed: 3 = 1 (profession) + 2 (intelligence)

【Divine Magic (Tome)】
Zero-ring: 4 = 4 (profession)
One-ring: 5 = 4 (profession) + 1 (perception)
Two-ring: 5 = 4 (profession) + 1 (perception)
Three-ring: 3 = 3 (profession)

【Divine Magic (Priest)】
Zero-ring: 3 = 3 (profession)
One-ring: 2 + 1 (domain) = 1 (profession) + 1 (perception) + 1 (domain)

With 28 points of intelligence, Zhao Xu's magical abilities are now quite abundant.

With three professions combined, he has a total of 11 zero-ring spells, 15 one-ring spells, 10 two-ring spells, 7 three-ring spells, and 3 four-ring spells.

With the ability to merge low-ring spells into a high-ring spell, he can also combine two low-ring spells into a high-ring spell.

"Well, then, let's go on an adventure in the underground, and I need your participation to give you a sense of existence," Anniya smiled and said to Zhao Xu.

"I don't like eating soft food, but I think I can tolerate adventures like this," Zhao Xu said helplessly.

Anniya was so serious that she was willing to wait for him to recover his magical abilities for three hours, which had already given him an ominous feeling.

"That means you have to eat tough food," Anniya said slowly, "Come, let's level up your mage level first, and then we'll see your magical abilities."

"Coming!" Zhao Xu felt Anniya's invisible wave, even though the air in the carriage was not stuffy at all. He still felt the "invisible" pressure, and even the vampire Lilith, who was sitting upright, looked nervous.
Here is the translation:

Zhao Xun glanced at his spellcaster level, 6th grade, and combined with the magic tattoo of Ayn Stone, ritual, and continuous magic for two days, which had reached 9th grade.

He then took out the necklace with the beads from his backpack and turned to the two magic beads.

【Adventurer Zhongxia, you have activated the magic bead, increasing your spellcaster level by 4 to 13. Lasts for 10 minutes.】

【Adventurer Zhongxia, you have cast the 2nd-grade spell "Physical Sacrifice" (persistent spell), reducing your physical condition by 10 points, and increasing your spellcaster level by 5 to 17. Lasts for 24 hours.】

After observing Zhao Xun's actions, An Niya also immediately cast the "Restoration" spell to restore the 10-point physical damage caused by "Physical Sacrifice" and the attribute damage caused by "Super Magic Control".

After finishing, she also cast the "Energy Protection" spell, which would make Zhao Xun immune to attribute damage. However, because "Physical Sacrifice" requires actual physical damage, it is impossible to cast "Energy Protection" in advance.

At 17th grade, even a superior priest in the 6th grade would not be able to stack it so high.

After the 10-minute magic bead effect expires, Zhao Xun's spellcaster level will return to 13.

At this point, An Niya lightly pressed Zhao Xun's hand, which was about to take out a variant spider from the dimensional bag, saying "Take this holy seal."

Zhao Xun finally noticed that this was a holy seal of the magic goddess Sylphrena, carved from red gemstones in the shape of a skull with a stretched-out face, and imbued with magic to twist it.

The skull's empty eye sockets continued to gaze at Zhao Xun.

"Through this holy seal, you can cast necromancy spells, increasing your spellcaster level by 1."
Here is the translation:

At the same time, Anzinoja suddenly cast three spells: "Harmonious Melody" (two rings), "Sacred Poem" (two rings), and "Mana Enhancement" (four rings). The dynamic prompts displayed one after another, telling Zhao Xu that he could increase his spellcaster level by 2 levels within the duration of each spell.

As a result, Zhao Xu now has a spellcaster level of 23 (17 + 6). However, Anzinoja did not stop moving and directly hung a cross pendant made of rough wood and hemp rope around Zhao Xu's neck, instructing him to say: "Combine two three-ring spell slots into one four-ring spell slot and use it as a sacrifice to activate the next spell."

Zhao Xu, who had realized the significance of the situation, immediately followed the instructions.

[Adventurer Xun, you have activated the "Arson Cross" emblem, consuming a four-ring spell slot. The next spell of yours that is no higher than four rings will be considered to have a spellcaster level +4, reaching level 27.]

At this moment, Zhao Xu saw the number and was somewhat stunned. He directly controlled his holy emblem, conjuring a row of miniature variant spiders and quickly held up his staff, casting the decisive spell for himself.

[Adventurer Xun, through your staff, you have cast "Domain of Decay" (lasting spell), your spellcaster level (28, holy emblem +1) has increased by 14 levels to 42, your strength has increased by 28 points, and your temporary life value has increased by 63 HP (14D8).]

However, the 42nd level of the spellcaster was only an instant illusion.

After casting the spell, the Arson Cross and Mana Enhancement, these one-time abilities, directly lost their effects. Even various temporary measures gradually lost their effectiveness.

It was not until 10 minutes later that Zhao Xu was left with only the effects of spells that could last for 24 hours.
Here is the translation of the text:

His skill level, which had reached a final determination of 13 (initial) + 14 (Necromantic Domain) = 27 levels. The 27 levels obtained were already more than four times his original level of 6.

"It seems that the law god's world is so explosive," Zhao Xu said with a sigh.

Excluding the magical energy in his rosary necklace, which added 4 levels, the three spells added by Anzhi Noya (6 levels), Arsen's Cross (4 levels), and the Holy Seal (1 level) were all intended to convert his temporary 15-level skill level into the Necromantic Domain.

As soon as he activated the Necromantic Domain, he had an additional 15 levels of skill level. Therefore, he could convert it into a fixed 8-level (half) skill level that lasted for 24 hours using the Necromantic Domain.

This meant that even if Zhao Xu lost the temporary effects and returned to his original form, he would still retain a 27-level skill level.

As for the three spells added by Anzhi Noya, he could naturally use them, which was equivalent to a level 1 skill level.

So, Zhao Xu could replicate these abilities without Anzhi Noya, but it would consume more spell slots.

If he didn't use the methods added by Anzhi Noya in the future, he could still have a 22-level skill level using his magical energy and Holy Seal.

"Ah, the 27-level skill level is quite impressive," Anzhi Noya said with a smile.

At this time, Zhao Xu looked at his hands and nodded, saying, "Indeed, it feels a bit unbeatable."

However, he immediately looked at Anzhi Noya, who seemed to be bluffing when she said her skill level exceeded 70 levels, which was not impressive at all.
