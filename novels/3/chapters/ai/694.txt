Chapter 695: Dissecting the Cowardly Demon

This world still doesn't have love without a reason, demons exist because of the abyss, and the abyss uses the demons. What was the reason for the first creator dragon, Arthur, to abandon his own accomplishments and create this world?

Zhao Xu couldn't help but let out a deep sigh at this thought. As he delved deeper into the abyss, the fear of the abyss he had learned about became more and more profound, like a strange painting that became increasingly terrifying, filled with countless secret symbols and religious markings.

"We'll just wait and not take any risks," Zhao Xu said.

In a place where the strong prevail, even if Anzhi Noya was by his side, he felt it was unnecessary to take excessive risks due to confidentiality requirements.

However, both Anzhi Noya and Ru'er looked at the cowardly demon's corpse with a faint look of disdain. Zhao Xu could only express his helplessness towards the cowardly demon.

We're all demons, tall and powerful. Why do you look so pathetic?

No wonder the cowardly demon was nicknamed "small demon" in the abyss, and the casualties and cannon fodder mentioned in the battle reports were all small demons.

The cowardly demon was about 1.2 meters tall, weighing only 60 kilograms, with a gray-green complexion, pale skin, and no hair. Its body was flabby and low-lying, with long, narrow hands that almost touched the ground. Its mouth was relaxed and had an unnatural shape, with small, sharp teeth.

Looking at this small, pathetic demon, Zhao Xu felt a sense of unfamiliarity. Since he couldn't leave, he simply squatted down and used his staff to scrape at the cowardly demon's corpse.
Here is the translation of the text:

"In the face of Arthur, these demons do not return to the abyss immediately after death, nor do they decay instantly, and I don't have the chance to research this kind of corpse."

For those wizards who specialize in the undead, they can say that every one of them is a master of manipulating corpses, and they wouldn't feel guilty about turning themselves into a pale and purple-faced mess.

Zhou Xiu has also received education on this aspect, just like shape-shifting or summoning, and sometimes you can't understand a biological creature thoroughly, making it impossible to perfect a spell.

Although this low-level demon is not bad, it's still a rare research opportunity.

Annie also noticed Zhou Xiu's thoughts.

She pulled Allow together and knelt down beside the demon corpse, wrinkling her nose slightly at the stench it emitted, and said, "According to the theory of the abyssal scholar Ahm, the abyss creates demons' bodies to complete specific tasks, giving them consistency in creation. However, this scholar has not had enough evidence, and one of the reasons is that it's difficult to obtain enough living demons as evidence."

"In chaos, there is still a glimmer of hope, and it's just right to seize this opportunity to study the demon's corpse."

"I'll tell you about the demon's physiology, which is especially important when walking in the abyss."

Annie's gaze flickered slightly towards the two of them before continuing.

"From humans to giants, dragons, mind thieves, elves, and orcs, all need to eat and breathe, which is a basic commonality. What about demons?"

Zhou Xiu was still clear on this basis, and immediately responded, "Demons don't need to eat or breathe."
Here is the translation of the text:

"It's true, but demons can devour a large quantity of food of any kind. Sometimes, we can even see this in some rituals involving demon sacrifices, but this is just a form of entertainment, only appreciating the bloody spectacle."

Zhao Xu asked, "Even if you eat a ton of food, it's of no use?"

"That's true," Anzhiya explained.

This demon is truly terrifying.

Zhao Xu suddenly remembered the demon-slaying battle from his past life, where those evil demons consumed live humans. He felt a surge of anger at the time. He thought those demons had excellent digestive abilities.

However, animals kill to survive, while demons kill for the sake of killing, only for the pleasure of it.

People with destructive personalities, who are similar to these demons, also have no significant differences.

Zheng Xin'an asked, "Where do the food that's consumed by demons and enters their stomach go?"

"Who knows?" Anzhiya shrugged. "Perhaps it enters the abyss, who knows?"

After a brief explanation of demon physiology, the two of them gained a deeper understanding of demons.

For example, demons don't need sleep, unless they are forced into a state similar to sleep by a powerful entity.

Demons don't have digestive systems, so they don't excrete anything. However, demons can choose to expel food before it disappears by vomiting or secreting a muddy substance through their pores. However, this has no meaning and only pollutes the environment.

As for reproduction, demons need to have the necessary "capital" to reproduce.

However, true demons are created by the abyss, so their behavior can only create "half-refined hell creatures." Of course, these can be created through magic or curses, so it's not a major life problem.

At first glance, demons seem to have solved the majority of low-level, trivial problems.
Here is the translation of the text:

"After knowing these basics, it's up to you now." As she said, Anniya handed over a short sword to them, saying, "Your tool, Nor."

"What?" Zheng Xin allowed was puzzled.

"Dissect it," Zhao Xu pointed out, smiling and looking at Xin'er beside him, "You take the lead, and I'll assist."

"Ah?" Xin'er's whole body shook.

She didn't expect this "heavy responsibility" to fall on her shoulders, and immediately scowled her face, saying, "Zhongxia, Anniya, students of the Medical College, even dissecting frogs and rabbits, you're asking me to do something simple first."

Do you think it's true that you're here to travel?

Zhao Xu thought with a wicked grin, but he didn't stop handing over the short sword to Xin'er, saying, "No problem, take it. This demon is the lowest in the evil demon series, and you're more interested in the judgment demon from that day? It's not impossible."

"Mainly, when we face such demons, you'll be in a bloody battlefield. Just get used to it."

Xin'er's eyes widened, and she was about to swallow, but couldn't, looking at the demon corpse in front of her, feeling a bit helpless.

"I might..."
"Don't worry, I'll give you a bunch of skills (dissection) right now," Zhao Xu quickly plugged the gap and directly lifted his hand to tap the short sword in Xin'er's hand.

Skill enhanced!
Instantly, this spell provided the corresponding skills of the 18th level for the owner of the short sword.

Seeing that Xin'er didn't have any excuse, Zheng Xin also took a deep breath and then held up the sword, cutting open the demon corpse in front of her.

It's a real experience to dissect a demon corpse, an experience that many nine-ring wizards may not have had.
Here is the translation of the text:

In the depths of the abyss, capturing a demon with no teleportation ability is almost impossible. It's like smuggling high-value goods through customs. Even if a demon lord from the abyss were to use their teleportation ability, they would not waste it on a low-ranking demon. Most people who can see "demons" are actually just projections summoned to appear, and they disappear immediately after death. Even if a real demon were to be summoned to the abyss, its corpse would not decompose easily. This complete demon corpse is not easily found in the abyss, which is why Zhao Xu is so precious about this opportunity.

Allowing shook her head in surprise as she sliced open the demon's muscle tissue. The demon's arm was surprisingly thin and delicate, like a human's. "I've seen demons' grip strength, crushing trees like they're twigs. It's ridiculous that this demon's muscles are so mismatched. It seems that demons' abilities come not only from their physical structure, but also from supernatural factors."

Just then, allowing continued to slice along the demon's forearm muscles, but when she tapped her fingers, she found that the bone had shattered directly. This was in stark contrast to the demon's hard, rock-like skeleton when it was alive.

"Have you noticed?" Anny asked.

"Yes," Zhao Xu nodded.

"Human bones become harder after death, and this demon's bones are also too brittle. This is because the abyssal power is gradually being stripped from its body."

Zhao Xu seemed to have grasped a crucial clue to the abyssal creature's composition.
Here is the translation of the text:

As Zheng Xin'an and An Ti Nuo Ya were exchanging opinions, Zheng Xin'an's forehead was slightly beaded with sweat. At this moment, he happened to cut open the belly of the demon, revealing its internal organs.

Instantly, the demon's abdominal cavity erupted with a extremely foul-smelling, black liquid that was so repulsive it could drive a person mad. These liquids initially had vitality and immediately splashed towards Xin'an.

"Protective Wings!"

However, Zhao Xu reacted faster and directly activated the protective magic, with the transparent dragon wings solidly blocking the attack.

Meanwhile, An Ti Nuo Ya instinctively covered Xin'an's mouth with her hand to prevent her from screaming and drawing attention.

After the black liquid emerged, it quickly lost its vitality and immediately evaporated, losing most of its water content and condensing into a type of asphalt residue, even containing some impurities.

"Imagine a stomach connecting to the esophagus without any intestines or digestive organs," Xin'an looked at the strange bodily structure and couldn't help but fall into deep thought.

"Too bad, it tastes like processed pig intestines," Zhao Xu recalled Xin'an's previous fondness and said intentionally.

At that moment, Xin'an almost covered her mouth, only remembering that her hands might splash with the demon's blood. She glared at Zhao Xu, "Zhong Xia, I'll never eat that kind of food again."

That was exactly what Zhao Xu had intended to achieve.

Subsequently, the brain dissection continued to surprise everyone, looking more similar to that of humans or other mammals, but with a darker and purplish hue. Especially after the dissection, the smell within the skull cavity seemed to be a deep pool of regurgitated matter that had been left to sit for several days.
Here is the translation of the text:

Finally, Zhao Xü and Yu'er silently pulled out their notebooks, recording every detail of their dissection as evidence for the next time. Even Yu'er, who had a talent for drawing, spent a whole sheet of paper on the composition.

"Brother, do you think these demons have a rebirth?" Yu'er asked, seemingly out of nowhere. Despite knowing that the demons before them were evil, Yu'er still felt a sense of emptiness after finishing the dissection.

"Oh? You're talking about the reincarnation of evil demons?" Zhao Xü said.

"But I've read many religious scriptures that say evil beings will be punished by gods after death and will receive eternal torment. These evil souls will then accept the command of dark powers and undergo eternal torture."

Yu'er looked at Zhao Xü with a puzzled expression. "Our teacher once taught us that some souls can, in extremely rare cases, be promoted to become demons or devil's servants. Is that true?"

"Not necessarily," Zhao Xü replied. "According to the perspective we just learned, the possibility of a soul becoming a demon is extremely low."

"But not impossible," Anzhiya suddenly added.

"For example, some undead creatures are formed from the souls of evil people who died and were transformed. Some demon scriptures record a viewpoint that lists several types of evil souls that were transformed into demons."

"Even according to what I know, there was a contract signed between a mage and Di Mu Gou to exchange loyalty for life in exchange for becoming a powerful demon after death."

Zhao Xü could only sigh and say, "It seems like someone's brain has gone soft, abandoning the good life of King Arthur and choosing to live in a hellish place instead."
Here is the translation of the given text:

"Even if I had to become a demon, it's better than becoming a lich. As a lich, aside from the weakness of being an immortal being, I would also get a large number of immunities and the ability to revive from a soulstone."

As Zhao Xu gazed at the disassembled corpse of the coward demon with disgust, he said, "Demons don't make promises, and if I were to become a lowly demon like this, I would really cry myself to death."

Zhao Xu also thought back to the fact that the original demon was said to be born from the soul of an evil being, and they were the lowest-ranking demons in the abyss, like raw materials.

"Summer Solstice," An Ti Nuo Ya suddenly said with great interest, gazing at Zhao Xu. "Theoretically, all demons who die on the outer plane will return to the blood pool, waiting for strength to continue, and then be reborn as demons."

"Only the Demon Prince can transcend this order, which is also why they can serve as rulers."

"It's no wonder that these deep-sea lords all think of Arthur as their hometown, always wanting to come back." Zhao Xu shook his head silently, his emotions like iron, unable to revive the loss.

"Summer Solstice, if you had the opportunity, how would you mobilize an army in the abyss?" An Ti Nuo Ya suddenly asked.

(Note: Summer Solstice is likely a nickname or title of An Ti Nuo Ya, rather than an actual date or time.)
