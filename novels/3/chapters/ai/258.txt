Chapter 259: Powerful Derivation

As Zhao Xukun answered everyone's questions, most people had already lost their curiosity about his identity. The miracle technique was something that only a few priests had heard of. However, no one knew what extent this technique could achieve.

At this time, the QQ group of the Anti-Hero Alliance did not have any restrictions on speaking, and many people immediately threw out their questions, seizing this rare opportunity. Especially those who were about to level up to 2nd level wizards, including the self-proclaimed first wizard in Winter City, Mu Nan.

At this moment, they couldn't help but knock out their questions, asking Zhao Xukun some of their confusions. Because the upgrade route of NPC wizards and player wizards actually had a significant difference.

They asked questions that NPC wizards could answer, but it was difficult for them to answer using a basis that players could understand.

The rapid development system and steady progress system had differences in the amount of knowledge of magic. It was like someone with a high school math background trying to solve a calculus problem, while players were only familiar with basic algebra.

Of course, players could handle simple questions, but when it came to complex concepts and the use of certain rules, there would be a gap. This was also the reason why players found it difficult to learn magic.

At this time, they met Zhao Xukun, the first player, and naturally, they threw out all their questions to ask him.

Meanwhile, Zhao Xukun's intelligence had already reached a new level and dimension. Yesterday, he could only be confused by everyone's explanations.
Here is the translation of the text:

When he heard the name of the spell, he suddenly recalled the incantations that were engraved in his mind. This was the unresolvable aspect of his expertise as a "sage" - his magic had already taken shape in his mind. He didn't need to record it to recall the structure of the incantations. Even when faced with questions, he had no hesitation or thought, and his mind immediately responded with the answers.

Zhao Xu's 22 intelligence also shone in this moment, highlighting his own strength.

Zhao Xu's eyes fluttered slightly, and his left hand automatically began to draw the answer on the graphic software. However, his line of sight was not focused on the graphic software.

It was as if everything was allowing his hands to move on their own, and even covering the graphic software with a black cloth would not affect the smoothness of his movements.

"The armor structure of the reverse embedding in the mage's shield is actually a very common pattern. If you have seen the 'Higher Mage's Shield' and 'Group Mage's Shield' of the Trinity Ring, you can easily find the most common part. Although there are still differences, these are things to consider after the Trinity Ring."

Zhao Xu replied while screenshotting his graphic results, which showed the "reverse embedding structure" he had mentioned.

When Zhao Xu's response was seen by the group, several mages couldn't help but burst out laughing, and were about to ask Zhao Xu more questions.

Even outsiders thought Zhao Xu was just being polite, as they didn't understand the content of the magic model.

However, when the screenshot followed closely after, the group suddenly fell silent.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

Several high-level players quietly deleted their responses, rendering the value of copying and saving worthless. On the clear screenshot, all doubts were turned into a joke. Even those who unintentionally asked simple questions pointed out that they had retracted their words. The group's original lively discussion suddenly came to a standstill, leaving only Zhao Xu's last image and a few pieces of information that had been retracted.

Zhao Xu thought his answer was problematic and hurriedly asked again: "This is just my opinion, and those with different opinions can refute it." However, the subsequent discussion remained lukewarm. Even those who had spent a long time researching and finally proposed the question were staring at the screen with difficulty. Many details were unclear to them, even without referencing a spellbook. But they also had doubts, under the same conditions. How did this "Star Shadow" gentleman achieve this? Did the opponent really have the same spellbook in reality? Without using compressed arcane language, the content would become extremely complex.

After a while, the 1st-level mage who asked the question finally typed out a few words: "I was just asking for a thought, but I didn't expect you to directly create a wheel for me." "And, big shot, you can even recite the spell model?" The time gap between the two sentences was not short, revealing the opponent's emotional ups and downs. When the opponent pointed out this point, even non-mages in the group fell silent. Among these people, there were high-ranking officials and even studio personnel who were more familiar with the difficulty of being a mage compared to players who only played a few jobs. If they didn't know that the two parties couldn't be playing a duet, they would all have to laugh at the awkwardness of this performance.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

"It's not possible that this game is only accessible to geniuses who can memorize dynamic models. The scene in the screenshot is too convincing. At this moment, Zhao Xu is not just "smart" - his memory also matches his intelligence. Combining his previous skills, he instantly revealed the enormous gap between him and the others in the QQ group.

After a while, even Wang Lian, who is considered the most gifted in Winter City, also nodded in agreement. "It's true, in this game, only those with extremely high intelligence can choose to become wizards."

Another wizard also expressed his agreement. " @Xing Kong, I've taken a screenshot. I'll paste the part you just answered on the forum later. Let them see how proficient you are in magic, and then no one will dare to question it again."

Zhao Xu's fans immediately added a "like" to his comment. "Not wrong, not wrong... I suddenly feel that if I, a worthless person like me, can become a wizard, it would be a sacrilegious act towards this profession."

The entire group was constantly flattering him after he drew the magic model.

Zhao Xu was also a bit embarrassed.

In fact, it was after he contacted the abyssal power last night that his memory and thinking ability had a significant upgrade.

Today, he encountered this problem, but yesterday he could only give a general direction. He couldn't directly show a diagram to tell others how to do it.

Moreover, the entire process was too fast, like two people deliberately cooperating."
At this time, there was also a stubborn player, a wizard, who directly pulled out a cold spell he had learned and asked Zhao Xiu a question.

"'Great God, I want to ask for an explanation. Among the seven exceptions mentioned in the human miniaturization spell, three of them can be clearly sensed when we use the spell. Are the other four also derived from the same source?"'

The one who asked the question was actually already aware of the answer, as he had just learned this spell by obtaining a scroll.

Therefore, he was confident that Zhao Xiu would not have learned this very general spell voluntarily.

For him, if he could expose Zhao Xiu's level, as a wise person who could see through the truth, he would naturally be able to speak his mind in the alliance in the future.

He also proved that the "starry sky" in front of him was not as divine as he thought, and he might even leave a heavy debt on the forum.

However, Zhao Xiu, the wise heart manipulator, directly displayed the model of the "human miniaturization spell" in front of him.

For the question he asked, he did not know the answer.

But at this moment, when he looked at the model of the spell, he knew that the seven unattainable exceptions came from where.

"'No, it can actually be inferred from the model,'" Zhao Xiu explained directly.

"'Oh, Great God, you're really accurate,'" the wizard saw the answer from the "starry sky" opposite him, and couldn't help but sigh inwardly, knowing that this pit had not been stepped on.

"'No need to guess,'" Zhao Xiu's reply suddenly tightened everyone's gaze.

This was followed by a hand-drawn diagram of the spell model being transmitted to the group.

When everyone saw the diagram, they almost shouted out loud.

Especially, the diagram was full of crooked and twisted strokes, which were clearly drawn on the spot and not prepared in advance.
Here is the translation:

"You look at the model content I wrote in red pen in the diagram. You continuously iterate using Takisys, and you can get the seven examples through looping. Zhang Xu's answer is simple, and he has automatically iterated the result in his mind.

Moreover, the diagram he just drew can also prove this point. At this moment, even players without a foundation in magic can notice that a part of the spell structure is deliberately drawn in red ink, which is different from the black ink used for the surrounding parts.

It's obvious that he wrote this on the spot, taking less than 12 seconds, and even with reference materials, it's barely possible to find the answer in such a short time.

"It's clear that he only saw the question for an instant and was writing non-stop to send it over quickly."

By this time, two magic players were explaining to Zhang Xu. They also told everyone how hard it is to solve this problem. Even during the process of drawing the diagram, the "Starry Night" was explaining someone else's question.

The player who asked the question, who was sitting in front of the computer and participating in the group meeting, looked pale. It was as if he had a photographic memory.

In an instant, the group suddenly erupted in great enthusiasm. These high-level players were contacting their fellow magic players to see what problem needed to be solved and were sending over the answer quickly.

Now, there was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

However, Zhang Xu, after answering about seven or eight questions, directly shifted the topic to a new one.

"How do you think we can solve that trump card?" Zhang Xu asked at this time.

The enthusiastic atmosphere in the group was immediately extinguished like a bucket of cold water. They ultimately had to face the difficult problem of "Lake of Falling Stars."
Here is the translation of the text:

The attacking speed of the previous players was not fast, and it was not until the bureaucrats of "Winter's Castle" had to step in to resolve the issue that the situation was finally settled.

Even if the opponent's trump card was strong, it would still be forced to surrender to the overall influence of Winter's Castle and could not be truly revealed.

Now that Zhao Xu has intervened, the trump card will naturally be exposed earlier.

"I think we should seek aid from Winter's Castle. Only with their help can we have a chance to turn the tide, as the battlefield situation has already changed."

A leader who initiated the anti-war alliance expressed this opinion in the group.

He believes that players can win and advocates for unity and counterattack.

However, under the new circumstances, it is impossible for players to win, and naturally, this proposal is opposed.

The group was initially filled with various opinions.

Players who had previously remained silent in this critical situation all spoke up, representing their own interests.

However, Zhao Xu was clear about the cause and effect and directly pointed out the key.

"Counting on Winter's Castle, 'Starfall Town' is Winter's Castle's 'Starfall Town'."
"Counting on us players, 'Starfall Town' is our 'Starfall Town'."

In the previous era, because of Winter's Castle's intervention, the entire Starfall Town was only influenced by the player's power after the entire population had crossed over, but ultimately, it was dominated by the Northern Alliance and could not be said to be a completely player-owned town.

Zhao Xu's repeated pushes on Starfall Town this time were naturally also aimed at making his name remembered in this battle.
