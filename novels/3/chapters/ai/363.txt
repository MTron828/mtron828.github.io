Chapter 364: The God's Pace

Most of the items on auction at this scene are from a recently excavated hidden wizard's tomb. Under the influence of the Mistralla Wizard's Association and the Goddess Church, the auction was even afraid to hold it in Mistralla, and instead arranged it to take place secretly in the dead of night in Frost Town.

As a result, the auction of tomb-exhumed magical items cannot receive official protection. The Thousand Gold Son did not dare to descend from his throne, and most of the attendees were actually representatives sent by nobles and merchants.

The composition of the team was mostly made up of stewards with pricing authority and guards, and some even directly entrusted adventurers to provide protection.

Zhao Xuan had also done similar transactions in his previous life, so he knew the depth of this auction.

Even players with an advantage in numbers could not take it. However, he was an exception.

Earlier, the "old witch" had been able to escape in front of him, relying on the heart-shaped stone she carried, which allowed her to cast the "same journey" spell. He had no choice but to wait for the next opportunity.

After arriving in Frost Town, Zhao Xuan, Zheng Xinyuan, and Elliot waited at the market street corner described by the middle-aged woman. However, they did not see the old witch dressed as a witch appear.

Later, Zhao Xuan used "suggestion" and got the rumors and inside information from Mrs. Betty. This made him realize that there were more than one "old witch" in Frost Town.
Here is the translation of the text:

It's possible that the old house in Frosty Town caused some kind of disturbance, making Zhao Xu's magic become extremely powerful. Therefore, Zhao Xu did not wait for the target to appear in Frosty Town.

As for the topic of the town itself, it's a deep and dark secret involving many families in the town. Betty's initial reaction was to hide the truth and wait for a family report.

Zheng Xin An has a gathering tonight, and will not be online later. Elton happened to have a distant relative in Frosty Town and visited him on the way.

After Zhao Xu put the invitation back in his backpack, he looked at the early sky and began to prepare for tonight's auction alone. Over the past two days, Zhao Xu reviewed his current grasp of the first to third level magic lists in his spare time.

After some thought, he realized that he had underestimated the "Super Magic Control" ability of the Super Magic Master. Combining it with "Magic Endurance", the power became extremely formidable.

In general, most magic spells have a duration and level of caster that are linked. However, some spells have a fixed duration. Time scales are mostly hourly, minute, or rotational, or fixed time.

For example, hourly magic spells can barely prepare before the battle starts. Rotational magic spells can only be used after the battle starts, but their intensity is not bad.

Once the "rotational" magic spell is combined with "Magic Endurance", it can be converted into a 24-hour ability.
Here is the translation of the text:

Mages like "Mage Shield" and "Shield Spell" can generally equip themselves with a temporary "Mage Shield" at the hour level. As for the round-level "Shield Spell", only someone like Zhao Xu can maintain it for 24 hours.

Zhao Xu casually unfolded another blueprint on his hand, which was the architectural blueprint of the auction hall he had asked Mrs. Betty to find for him.

After a glance, Zhao Xu judged the routes he could retreat from.

However, he didn't plan to stop there. He immediately shifted his gaze to "Flying Ability".

Mages generally stop walking on two legs after reaching level 5.

For long-distance travel, there are "Summon Mount" and "Illusion Mount" spells. For aerial areas, there is "Flight Spell".

Unfortunately, Flight Spell is a "contact" spell that cannot be maintained for a long time. Therefore, it is mainly used for temporary flight and escape, and cannot be used for long-distance travel.

A spell that can be maintained must be a "self" or "fixed distance" spell, which can only be used on oneself. "Contact" spells, such as "Mage Shield" and "Luminous Shield", lose their durability and cannot be maintained.

However, Zhao Xu had previously been tracked by Esveith and others while in stealth mode. At that time, he used the "Quick Flight Spell" that could only be used on himself, which had a duration of only one round.

Although he couldn't use the three-round flight spell, he relied on this "disabled" two-round spell to escape the oil spell area.

This spell had a range of self-effect, not contact effect, which exactly met the requirement for spell durability.
Here is the translation:

So, Zhao Xu could only sustain flight for about ten minutes using the Three-Ring Flying Technique. On the other hand, the "Swift Flight Technique" with a duration of 24 hours was a much more practical choice. Essentially, he could exchange one fixed two-ring spell slot every day for the coveted "flight" ability that countless warriors envied.

Currently, Zhao Xu's spell slots are as follows: zero-ring 11, one-ring 13, two-ring 9, and three-ring 5. Combining this with his ability to merge two low-ring spells into a high-ring spell, his own endurance far surpasses that of a typical 6th-level caster.

A mere two-ring spell slot would not cause Zhao Xu to feel any discomfort. However, Zhao Xu thought for a moment and did not rush to cast the spell.

At that moment, the snow from the previous day had just melted, and the air was still filled with a lingering chill. The setting sun's rays illuminated Zhao Xu's body, giving him a sense of warmth. This also made his decision clear.

In ordinary circumstances, the "Swift Flight Technique" would be sufficient. However, facing the special situation tonight, Zhao Xu turned to cast another three-ring divine technique, "God's Pace".

This technique allows the caster to acquire a new form of movement and speed. The spell itself corresponds to different gods, resulting in different movement methods, such as climbing, flying, or digging. If a non-believer chooses, the duration will be halved. However, Zhao Xu was not concerned about this. He chose the goddess of magic.

According to this technique, the corresponding "flight ability" is "normal speed 7 km/h, maximum speed 28 km/h". This three-ring technique not only has perfect flight maneuverability but also surpasses the good maneuverability of the "Flight Technique".
Here's the translation of the text:

Additionally, its speed is faster than that of an ordinary person, with a speed of around 20 km/h at full speed. The only issue is that the duration of this spell is "round/level". Many times, without the channel of the three-ring arc flying spell, clergy members can only rely on this spell to obtain flight ability. For Zhao Xu, who has a low-cost spell, this is not a problem. In fact, he chose this spell based on another extremely powerful factor. During the spell's duration, if he chooses to terminate the spell prematurely, he can gain a non-human explosive speed in one go. For every additional 1 round of remaining spell time, Zhao Xu can gain an additional 1.8 km/h (full speed 7.2 km/h) increase for the next 6 seconds. It may seem small, as car speeds on Earth are around 30 km/h in urban areas and nearly 100 km/h on highways. Even if someone consumes 10 rounds of time, it's only 25 km/h (full speed 100 km/h). Although this effect is comparable to that of high-speed vehicles, it can only last for one round. After conversion, it's equivalent to flying 166 meters in 6 seconds, which is three times the human 100-meter sprint record. In emergency situations where one needs to escape quickly, it's barely adequate. However, Zhao Xu is different; he immediately applies this spell to himself. As the spell takes effect, his entire body gradually becomes incredibly light, even without opening his wings, he can still feel the air slowly lifting him up. He wants to soar and dash towards the sky.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Adventure Seeker Summer, you cast the 'Divine Stride' spell on yourself, granting you a flying speed of 7 (full speed 28) kilometers per hour, with a duration of 24 hours/14400 rounds (originally 12 rounds)."

"When you consecutively cast the spell, the information panel displays the remaining time in 14400 rounds, which is almost blinding for Zhao Xu's eyes.

This means that if he cancels the spell, he will be able to achieve a speed of 2.5 million (full speed 10 million) kilometers per hour.

Although it's far from the speed of light, which is 30 million kilometers per second, it's still terrifying.

Even Zhao Xu, who is on Earth, can't help but think that if he flies at an incredible speed of 8000 kilometers per second, he would be able to escape the Earth.

However, Zhao Xu is not brave enough to use this speed to fly 170 kilometers in 6 seconds.

On Earth, living beings have a rotational speed of around 2000 kilometers per hour, but since they are stationary on the ground, they don't feel like they are moving.

But if Zhao Xu were to suddenly accelerate to such a speed on Arthur's Land, he would likely be turned into meat.

He can only suppress his speed and fly within the range allowed by his armor and physical condition.

If a war breaks out tonight, as long as Zhao Xu can smoothly break through to the open sky, he will be able to demonstrate the speed of a pastor."
