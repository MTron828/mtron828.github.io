Chapter 442: High-Ranking Power

Zhao Xu was unaware of what "adventure" meant to An Ti Noya, whether it referred to slaughtering a group of demons or engaging in a fierce battle against the demonic army on the battlefield.

However, An Ti Noya was not the type to indulge in idle chatter. Most of the time, she would answer Zhao Xu's questions with a single sentence.

In her eyes, the world of Arther was just like that - there was nothing remarkable about it.

As Zhao Xu and An Ti Noya were about to leave, Vivian, who was wearing gloves, didn't even notice the broken wooden door and pushed it open to create a path for them to pass through.

At this moment, Zhao Xu's gaze fell upon the carriage parked in the corner of the wall, as if it was completely unimportant and could be stolen at any moment.

Zhao Xu immediately asked, "Is there a coachman?"

"No, you can take over," An Ti Noya replied calmly, as if waiting for Zhao Xu to speak up.

Zhao Xu didn't seem to care about this. In his past life, he had played the role of bodyguard for the high-ranking officials of the alliance and had even acted as a coachman on several occasions.

However, Zhao Xu had already noticed that An Ti Noya's gaze had completely fallen on Vivian, with an expression of anticipation, as if expecting some private time together.

Zhao Xu thought to himself, "Don't cause trouble."

Just then, a group of people suddenly emerged from a quiet corner of the street, "Ah, those are them, impersonating official personnel of the Association."

At this moment, the street, which had previously been open for passage, was suddenly blocked by row upon row of heavily armed guards, all wearing impressive armor and gripping long spears and shields, ready to charge at any moment.
Here is the translation of the text:

At this time, the leader of the seven or eight people was the one who had just blocked his guards outside. "Idiot, you just told them you're coming to take up a job? Are you going to take up a job in this unfinished association office?" Anzhen laughed out loud, and upon seeing the crowd, she immediately realized what was happening.

"I didn't know it wasn't finished yet," Zhao Xu also looked puzzled. In his previous life, he had arrived in the Starlight Town when the city gate was already finished, just like the tower of the Mage Association.

Who would have thought that eight months ago, there was nothing here.

So he initially thought it was just a straightforward job.

"The association punishes those who impersonate official personnel severely, and as long as it's verified, these guards will also receive a handsome reward. So they're dead set on biting the hook," Anzhen explained.

"No wonder I've already showcased three rings of magic, and they still won't give up," Zhao Xu nodded.

He didn't stay in the old house for long, and luckily, the city gate guards of Starlight Town were able to organize a group of people to block their way.

"It seems that the Mage Association's reputation is at its peak," Vivian said, still not wearing armor, as she saw the scene before her. She still didn't feel any fear, pulling out the long sword hidden under her cloak.

"It's a matter of life and death," Zhao Xu also sighed.

They knew he was a three-ring mage, but they still wanted to bite the hook for a reward, naturally believing that their efforts would not go unrewarded by the association.

No wonder when he first entered the city, his letter was suspected, and these guards immediately shouted and attacked him, acting like they had already caught him and were saying so.

It was clear that they thought he had already deeply offended the "Mage Association".
Here is the translation:

Even if the person himself is a powerful spellcaster, the "Mage Association" above can still devour him. After the fact, even if the guards have sacrificed themselves, they can still receive sufficient compensation, which is the "reputation" accumulated by the Mage Association over the years.

"This year, there are even people who dare to impersonate us. You know that even the most reckless vagabonds would not dare to impersonate the officials of the Mage Association, not even the most ordinary town council officials."

The leader of the seven or eight people in front, an old man standing in the middle, spoke up. He was wearing a mage's robe and was also a spellcaster.

At this time, the hundreds of guards behind him were all looking at the old man, with their eyes fixed on him.

"State your lineage?" the old man continued to say.

Zhao Xu then slightly used his own "secret visual technique" that he had just mastered, and immediately saw that the old man was a three-ring mage.

In this small town, he was almost a big shot.

Although Zhao Xu did not know this old man from his previous life, the opponent's identity as a three-ring mage was like an invisible golden plaque. When he was a justice, he had to cultivate good relations with him.

The old man seemed to feel the pressure from Anatiya, looking at the silent crowd, and continued to say: "Report your name, and if you can release your magical energy, you're not a novice mage. Say your lineage, and there may be leniency in the penalty."

"That's okay, I'll explain it to them?"

Zhao Xu turned around and asked Anatiya.

Initially, he had abandoned his basic identity proof, naturally wanting to prove that no one could judge him.

Now, the three-ring mage in front of him could finally use his "employment certificate".

After all, this was the place where he would "found a new sect", and Zhao Xu did not want to go on a killing spree.

"Get in the car," Anatiya said indifferently. "I, Anatiya, never explain my actions to anyone."

And in the next moment, these guards, holding bows and arrows, looked at them with a fierce gaze, as if they had just witnessed the most magical scene of their lives.

The three young men and women didn't even notice them, and instead, they directly opened the curtains of the carriage and got in.

It was as if they were surrounded by hundreds of people, but in reality, there was no one else around.

"Really impudent," one of them said.

"Master of the law, give the order! Let us catch these impostors and take them away!"

"No, we can do it in two rounds," another one replied.

There were a few exceptional individuals in the town who could follow the old man closely, and the players were even more emotional.

The old man didn't expect that the prestigious Law Association would have a day when they wouldn't be taken seriously. The others didn't even bother to explain themselves.

As soon as he scanned the scene, he could basically tell that these three young men and women were not members of the Northern Alliance of the Law Association. It was as if there was no way to proceed.

"That's it, let's act," the old man said, and at that moment, he was ready to use the "Magic Dispel" to counter the opponent's magical moves.

Since they didn't play by the rules, even if their elders came to the door, he had an excuse for it. He didn't blame them for not being polite when they acted.

At this moment, the commander riding a war horse saw the order and shouted, "Charge!"

They were originally responsible for guarding the most valuable mines that could produce secret silver, but this time, they were ordered to apprehend a few "villains" who could cast spells. To him, it was a matter of capturing the enemy.

However, the commander shouted only to find that no one had moved. Then, he discovered that his entire body had become stiff and immobile.
Here is the translation of the text:

At this moment, the entire town's main street was eerily quiet, with nearly a hundred guardsmen standing still, as if turned to stone. They were frozen in place, their eyes fixed on something in the distance. The townspeople, hiding behind windows and curtains, dared not make a sound, fearing that the three powerful wizards might be startled.

Zhao Xu suddenly snapped his whip, urging his horse forward. The horse, although lacking intelligence, sensed the strange atmosphere emanating from the group of people ahead, tilting its head to the side.

"What's going on?" Zhao Xu asked, sitting on the carriage, his distance from An Ti Nuo Ya and Wei An just a step away, separated by a curtain.

It seemed that An Ti Nuo Ya had used the "Group Human Freeze" spell, an evolved version of the "Five-Ring Human Freeze" spell.

As long as the distance between individuals did not exceed nine meters, they would be affected by this group spell, just as if they had been frozen by a single individual's "Human Freeze" spell.

Even Zhao Xu estimated that the guards had been divided into two groups, with a distance of over ten meters between them, meaning that An Ti Nuo Ya had released at least two of these spells in an instant.

"You didn't see me freeze the opponent's warhorses, did you?" An Ti Nuo Ya said. "It's the Nine-Ring Group Freeze Spell."

"Teacher, when can I be able to freeze people like you do without fighting?" Zhao Xu sighed.

He didn't want to resort to killing, and instead, he needed to use a counterattack spell.

It was just like An Ti Nuo Ya, who had directly used the Nine-Ring Spell to make the people unable to move for a while.

"You should gradually upgrade," An Ti Nuo Ya said. "Sometimes, spells can be more effective than 'proof' in making people keep quiet. When I cast the Nine-Ring Spell, even that old man will sincerely forget everything that happened today."

"Teacher, I still need to thank you for teaching me a valuable lesson," Zhao Xu sighed.
Here is the translation:

Without a doubt, Anzhiya told him that his spell couldn't stop because his spell was too low-level. "Ah, I understand. That's fine. But what specialty do you plan to choose this time?" At this moment, Zhao Xu had already driven the horse carriage out of the city, as if he had just suddenly extracted the guardian power of the small town, and they didn't encounter any guards all the way out of the city. "Is it a long-distance spell?" Zhao Xu thought for a moment before speaking up. This specialty can extend the distance of the spell to 9 meters, transforming it into a ray spell. In this way, Zhao Xu's current "Chilling Touch" spell can start to become a ray attack, maintaining a safe distance. He could even apply the "Chain Spell" specialty, causing himself to shoot out three "Chilling Touch" spells in a row. "Okay, it'll do," Anzhiya said in a somewhat languid tone. "Oh, by the way, do you know that spell in the fourth circle that can increase the caster's level by half?"
