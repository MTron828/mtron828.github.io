Chapter 413: Unnamed Enhancement

The sound was incredibly majestic and vast, as if it was being carried by the wind, spreading from the center of the explosion to a radius of 50 kilometers.

Coincidentally, the area covered by the explosion's power was consistent with the range.

Although countless adventurers who entered the area had never experienced anything similar, rumors claimed that divine beings would whisper in the ears of mortals. Specifically, the term "higher-grade artifact" stirred the hearts of countless people.

If Arthur had something that could make adventurers' souls yearn and dream, as long as they obtained it, they could transcend the mundane. It was undoubtedly the artifact that could do so.

Among the artifacts, the higher-grade one was the most tyrannical and inescapable.

Legend has it that over ten monarchs successfully founded their kingdoms by obtaining divine artifacts.

Rural children playing together would boast about their branches being national defense warriors.

Although everyone was unaware of the "divine breath" and its specific abilities, which could not be quantified or measured. However, this news instantly ignited the desires of everyone within a 50-kilometer radius.

For a brief moment, the major organizations and teams that were originally engaged in fierce battles put down their weapons and reviewed their resource allocation, trying to find a quick way to enter the area.

Although there were only six hours left, everyone knew that the two lucky individuals reported to have obtained the artifact had the greatest chance.

Just as mages within the area attempted to use magic to rush to the center of the explosion, they noticed a notification popping up on their dynamic advice panel, saying
XX the Adventurer, you are under the influence of the Eldrid Palace and are currently in a Demonic Zone. Countdown: 6 hours.

Cruel and cold.

In an instant, a poor warrior's eyes lit up with joy, while a priestly figure, adorned in luxurious magical equipment, spat blood. Most adventurers who heard the grand fanfare, which just echoed through the air, received similar information.

This is a "Demonic Zone" with a range of 50 kilometers in diameter, directly affecting the power of legendary magic.

Adventurers who possess magical items are now staring at their items with tears in their eyes, as the Demonic Zone's constraints have almost rendered them useless. Magic has vanished, leaving no trace.

A group of excited mages, eager to rush to the center, now look terrified and hastily try to retreat from the Demonic Zone.

At this moment, they can only rely on their physical abilities, as the Demonic Zone has crushed the rest of their abilities.

Adventurers on the periphery of the scene are also looking worried.

They have realized that those who did not enter the blast center at the beginning have almost lost half of their leveling opportunities.

Without magic, the blast center itself has a suppressing effect on animals and beasts, meaning they must walk tens of kilometers on foot within 6 hours, far exceeding their normal ability limits.

This has also cut off the hope of countless adventurers from outside who arrived after hearing the news.

After a moment of thought, adventurers near the blast center are smiling and laughing, while those farther away are cursing loudly.

Other mages are anxious and can only rely on melee professions to protect themselves.

The blast center is 10 kilometers away.

A group of about twenty players, rushing along this road, ignored the scorching heat from the ground beneath their feet as they desperately hastened their pace.

Last night, they had chosen to camp, who would have thought that they had selected a valley that was sheltered from the wind, and as a result, more than half of them survived the explosion.

Although they crawled out of the ruins, covered in dust and dirt, it was not necessarily a glorious thing.

"Zhong Xia? Which road is this?" someone asked.

"It's us, the player mages, and we've entered the internal realm of this high-level artifact," someone else replied.

At this point, the group of players gathered together, and the topic naturally turned to the "Zhong Xia" at the center of the storm.

Some strangers looked on in awe.

Even Saint Warrior Vivian's birth from the depths of the earth was ignored by them.

"How much can we sell this artifact for? A hundred million?" someone asked.

"I think we can," someone replied. "Now, no player has it."

"I'll go for it, and I'll be rich overnight," someone else said, revealing a look of envy.

But the team leader, who had been leading the team, let out a cold smile.

If you can take it, you must also be able to bring it back.

He didn't even need to think about it. In six hours, a swarm of adventurers would arrive at the explosion site.

Not obtaining the artifact from the explosion site does not mean that they do not have the ability to obtain it from the players.

Especially, many adventurers knew that someone had already entered before, and they were probably waiting with a mind to kill and plunder.

When the lucky one holding the artifact came out of the site, it would undoubtedly be a bloody and chaotic scene...

Who knew that suddenly hearing such a sentence would make him want to eat his heart out. His "Zhōng Xià" nickname ID was exposed in such a way.

However, soon after, Zhao Xu quickly regained his composure. Things happened, and he naturally wouldn't dwell on it too much.

Since this sacred breath could control things so easily, it means that the strength of this divine artifact is probably beyond his imagination.

At this point, Zhao Xu continued to accompany Wei Wei as they headed towards the stone bridge. After the mud golem shattered, the magic also dissipated quickly, turning into a lump of ordinary mud. Otherwise, Zhao Xu would have to retrieve some of it.

In less than five minutes, Zhao Xu discovered that three mud golems appeared before him.

This time, Zhao Xu also suddenly raised his power symbol staff to go one by one and knock them to death.

Fortunately, the two of them didn't encounter any more trouble, and Zhao Xu, with Wei Wei's cooperation, was able to knock them apart successfully.

Even if Zhao Xu's magic could take effect on these mud golems, his stamina would still not be able to keep up with the battle.

After knocking down the three mud golems, the magical symbols on the broken mud again revealed the scorching magical patterns on the golden copper box in Zhao Xu's hand.

As they continued to rush forward towards the stone bridge, there were even four waves of mud golems, with one wave of four golems attacking Zhao Xu and his companions on the bridge.

Finally, after Wei Wei was injured, Zhao Xu also struggled to kill the remaining mud golems.

Upon reaching this point, he finally saw the dim light emanating from the stone bridge ahead, as if it was an exit.

Suddenly, a profound sense of joy welled up in Zhao Xu's heart.
Here is the translation of the text:

Just when he was about to defeat the sixth Mud Golem, he realized that the Yellow Bronze Treasure Box would no longer increase the number of talismans in his hand after defeating the Mud Golem.

He came to realize that the Mud Golem was only a part of the Yellow Bronze Treasure Box's activation process, not the whole thing.

He still needed to defeat other monsters to obtain new talismans.

Finally, when the talismans on the Yellow Bronze Treasure Box were fully deployed, Zhao Xu didn't know what he could get, but he could only wait with anticipation.

After the announcement issued by the Adept's Palace, countless adventurers poured in. Although Zhao Xu had made some progress, he continued to prepare to speed up his pace.

However, when he was about to reach his goal, he discovered a towering, unfamiliar figure blocking his path.

"This is?" Viola whispered, looking at the figure that was almost as tall as two people.

It had a special armor with intricate designs and many facial features, even clearer than the Mud Golem's exterior.

"It's an Iron Golem," Zhao Xu said, having fought many battles with similar golems in Anselm's territory.

The Iron Golem heard Zhao Xu's words and opened its eyes, accumulating an endless killing intent in an instant.

It suddenly swung its short sword and charged towards them.

As a creature that weighed five tons, every step it took could cause the ground to shake, let alone the stone bridge in front of them.

As the stone bridge shook and trembled, Zhao Xu's heart skipped a beat with fear, worried that the bridge might suddenly collapse.

Just as this was happening, the Iron Golem had already entered their threatening range. Zhao Xu was about to unleash his killing ability, but...
Here is the translation of the text:

The iron golem, whose challenge level exceeded 13, suddenly stopped in its tracks and then spat out a massive amount of toxic gas from its mouth. A green, eerie, and extremely toxic mist spread out. Zhao Xun's face turned pale as he watched the golem's toxic breath attack coming straight at him.

"Shield of Protection!"

In an instant, Zhao Xun summoned the shield of protection, calling out half-transparent dragon wings to envelop his body. The toxic mist, which could cause physical damage and continue to harm, was blocked by Zhao Xun's body, serving as a shield.

At the same time, Zhao Xun charged forward, swinging his sword. Vi Vi, standing beside him, was ready to support him.

The iron golem's defense level had already exceeded 30, and its sword attacks were extremely powerful, making it a formidable opponent on the battlefield.

However, Zhao Xun was not worried. He knew that the golem's toxic breath attack needed 2-5 rounds to recover. Therefore, he didn't need to worry about the attack's toxic effects in the short term.

If he failed to dodge the attack, he would take 1-4 (1D4) points of physical damage, followed by 3-12 (3D4) points of physical damage. Even a 6th-level Zhao Xun could be killed instantly.

Just as Zhao Xun was about to unleash his fourfold strength attack, he suddenly noticed that his battle-attribute staff had been twisted and turned to the side by some unknown force.

Asymmetrical force!

Zhao Xun immediately realized that the opponent's defense had an asymmetrical bonus.
Here is the translation:

At the beginning, he made up his mind to learn how to defeat this 30-layer defenseless gourd, just because there are 22 layers of innate defense in the opponent's 30 layers that can be broken by ghostly hitting techniques.

Who knew that it was actually special-aided!

In the past, the monsters that Zhao Xu faced were mostly basic templates, but this is the first time he has encountered a different monster.

Meanwhile, ViVianna was also swinging her sacred avenger sword forward, without an attachment, and was also blocked by the off-center defense force.

"What to do, General?" she asked, waiting for the opponent's instructions.

The ordinary iron golem is not formidable.

What's formidable is this iron golem that has been reinforced, but its ins and outs are unknown.

At the same time, another iron sword was pressed against Zhao Xu's back.
