Chapter 451: Unusual Again

"Liu Feng looked at Zhao Xiu's bewildered expression with curiosity. 'Is it possible that someone came to your doorstep during the day?'"

As a city renowned for its spatial distance, it's common for neighbors to only exchange nods. It's no big deal for classmates who have been friends for three years to not visit each other's homes. 'Could it be that your girlfriend came knocking on your door?' Hou Tiansheng couldn't help but tease Zhao Xiu, as if he could see the cold sweat forming on Zhao Xiu's forehead.

"If it were that simple, that would be great," Zhao Xiu sighed.

A legendary mage, who had no prior warning, had once again crossed over to Earth. It was unlikely that he would receive a "Happy New Year" greeting.

Especially since Zhao Xiu had just parted ways with An Xinyue yesterday.

Like the time it took for the seasons to change, they had only been apart for a day and a half, less than 12 hours.

Could it be that An Xinyue had a "life-or-death" emergency that needed to be notified to him?

As someone who possessed the "biological positioning technique," the other party could have easily found this tea shop.
Even a "telepathy technique" could have been used to communicate.

Why go through all the trouble, taking a roundabout route?

"Xiu-ge, you should just go back and take care of things first. Let's catch up another time after the New Year," Liu Feng said, as if he had seen Zhao Xiu's distress and spoke directly.

"Okay, sorry, next time," Zhao Xiu nodded and left.

He went to the counter, settled the bill, and then hopped into a Didi to head home.

As Zhao Xiu's figure disappeared, Liu Feng poured tea for the people around him and said, "Don't you think Xiu-ge seems a bit off this time?"

"Hou Tiansheng shrugged his shoulders and said, 'What else can I do? It's just a mouth and two eyes, right? Can't become a monster or anything.'

"Not that, it's just that he's become much more subdued,' Liu Feng said with a nostalgic expression.

'Before, during the summer vacation, he just kept silent, without being as introverted as he is now,' he added with a hint of skepticism and incredulity.

'As if Xu Ge had gone through a tumultuous experience and had maintained a serene state of mind, unaffected by the chaos of the world,' he continued.

'It's a sense of "wanderlust" in his mindset, even if he's trying to hide it. I can sense it.'

Just then, Hou Tiansheng couldn't help but push up his glasses perched on the bridge of his nose. 'In my opinion, it's likely that Brother Xu has started dating someone.'

'No way,' Hong Jiewei said, finding it hard to believe.

'With his ancient and unchanging personality, how could he possibly be interested in girls?'

'Get lost, you fatso,' Hou Tiansheng jokingly kicked his friend who was sitting next to him.

'And what about the proof that the starry sky reflection is not a player of the first level, but actually a different person? You still haven't given me the Remi doll,' he added.

Hong Jiewei also stopped eating and said, 'No, I still believe that the starry sky reflection and Zhong Xia are the same person. You guys can't explain it. Back then, the opponent could argue with everyone in the QQ group.'

Hou Tiansheng had already prepared his reasoning. 'Come on, the starry sky reflection that time was using various close-range combat skills, like the powerful slash. Have you ever seen a mage or warrior specializing in that?'
Here is the translation of the text:

"And, in the summer, it seemed like they were carrying a 'divine tool' away, but it was actually just extreme magical output, with various extremely effective fireballs washing over the place. It was basically a different chain of expertise, and at the time, we didn't understand it, but now it's clear that they weren't even one person from start to finish. The person in the group was just a player who was extremely skilled in strategy, and my cousin, who's a retired military officer, was also from the North Alliance, and he too knew how to draw those tactical maps."

"So, you guys didn't realize that the opponent wasn't a professional, which is why you were so easily fooled."

Hou Tiansheng looked at his friend, who was rebutting him, and Hong Qiwu, a high-level gamer, who was also from the North Alliance, naturally had participated in that battle.

From start to finish, Hong Qiwu had been unwavering in his commitment to that day's "Star Shadow" - the number one player in the game.

"You're just hard-headed, unwilling to let go of that six-to-one Leum model," Hong Qiwu said.

"Ah, monkey, that's because he's strong, so he can satisfy multiple chains of expertise," someone replied.

Meanwhile, Liu Feng was watching the two argue, his heart wondering about this game that had everyone hooked.

"...Mom, I'm back," Liu Feng said.

Zhao Xu had verified it for the first time, and after adding money, he could compress the time it took to get back to what it was.

"Little Xu, come here," his mother said, as she put a plate of freshly washed and cut fruit on the tea table.

At that moment, An Xiniao was sitting on the couch at his home.

Zhao Xu had never seen her dressed in an earthy costume before, let alone sitting so formally.

Before that, in Mistral, Zhao Xu had spent countless hours studying magical texts by lamplight, while An Xiniao was always careless and sloppy.

He never looked at her as a male.

An Xiniao was wearing high-waisted stockings and a skirt with floral patterns, and a white blouse with a pink bow tie. She looked almost like a high school girl.

Meanwhile, Nan Xiaoyi was still waiting for the evening to leave, and was still staying at Zhao Xu's home.
Here is the translation of the text:

At this moment, she saw An Ning Yao just like a child entering a children's playground for the first time, with her eyes shining brightly and sticking her face close to An Ning Yao's. Since Zhao Xu had just arrived, she kept asking about An Ning Yao's information, as if she were a little sister.

At the same time, Zhao Xu's mother was also looking at them with a satisfied expression, her mind already wandering. This was the first time she felt that her son was capable of this kind of thing.

Zhao Xu had a puzzled expression on his face. Despite seeing An Ning Yao, he still felt amazed by her appearance.

However, he didn't expect that his mother and South Little Mei had been defeated by An Ning Yao in the less than half an hour it took him to return.

"Let's chat, Mother suddenly remembered that we still haven't bought some food," Zhao Xu's mother said, taking out her wallet and keys from the table.

Then she looked at South Little Mei and instinctively wanted to adjust the Philips lamp.

However, after careful consideration, she still didn't trust her son.

To avoid making a mistake, Zhao Xu's mother assigned: "Little Mei, can you accompany Sister An Ning for me?"

"Yes, yes," South Little Mei quickly nodded.

Zhao Xu didn't bother to reveal his mother's plan.

As the refrigerator at home was already full of food to prepare for the upcoming New Year, not even a bottle of happy water could be accommodated.

"Hey, Sister An Ning, how did you get to know my brother?" South Little Mei asked.

At this moment, she had already recovered from her trance and thought that if she wanted to continue interacting with An Ning Yao, it would be best to help Zhao Xu.

"Oh, we met through an organization, and I'm his introducer," An Ning Yao said calmly.

"Oh, a university club," South Little Mei thought automatically.
Here is the translation of the text:

"I was thinking of attending a local university, but Zhao Xu's university has a sister who is as beautiful and lovely as you, so I'll definitely work hard to get in."

"No, you're very lovely too," replied An Tiya, gazing at Zhao Xu with her eyes.

"That's great! What's the name of your club? Can I get a reserved spot for new members or invite me to join your recruitment group? I'd be happy to contribute," said Nan Xiao Wei, looking at An Tiya with a fluttering heart.

In her eyes, An Tiya seemed like a character from a fairy tale. The delicate and lovely face instantly pierced her heart.

"We're not recruiting members for now. As for the club name, I can tell you - 'Final Scroll'," An Tiya replied briefly.

"Oh, it sounds like the name of a mysterious organization. Do you guys research magic?" Nan Xiao Wei thought, automatically imagining a mysterious magic ritual that wouldn't work on earth.

"No, that's right," An Tiya replied briefly.

"Wow, I was also very interested in it when I was younger. Back then, I and Zhao Xu would draw a complex magic circle with pencils at home," Nan Xiao Wei suddenly revealed her and Zhao Xu's past otaku experiences.

Zhao Xu could only hint at An Tiya to calm down with lip movements.

"Snap!"

An Tiya snapped her fingers.

At that moment, Nan Xiao Wei leaned against the sofa and fell asleep under the influence of the spell.

"I'm very interested in your childhood," An Tiya joked.

Zhao Xu looked embarrassed, who didn't pretend to be a superhero monster as a child?
Here is the translation of the text:

He couldn't help but ask, looking at Anzhiya's outfit, "Teacher, is this a disguise using 'shape-shifting magic' or 'illusion magic'?"

It's undeniable that Anzhiya has a thorough understanding of the Earth, and he couldn't find even a single inconsistency in this outfit.

"It's not that," Anzhiya said, "I just bought this outfit specifically to wear today."

"Wear it today?" Zhao Xu raised an eyebrow, "Teacher, you came to my home and still have the leisure to change clothes?"

"It was a sudden impulse," Anzhiya said, "Do you like this outfit? Anyway, I won't wear it back to Arthur's place, I can take it off and give it to you later."

"Thanks, I don't have a hobby like that right now," Zhao Xu replied politely.

"Teacher, is there something you want to notify me about?" Zhao Xu cut to the chase.

"Yes, happy summer, happy new year," Anzhiya said.

"..."

"Yes, I'm not joking. The Earth——Arthur's material energy channel has appeared abnormal again."
