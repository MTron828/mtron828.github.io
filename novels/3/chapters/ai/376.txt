Chapter 377: Border Turbulence

"These civilians are too many already,"

Zhao Xu gazed at the surging crowd before him, unable to help himself from losing his voice.

At the moment, outside the city of Luca, on the road leading to the northern alliance, a dense crowd was packed with countless people dragging their belongings, carrying heavy luggage, and struggling to move forward. A few individuals who had some means were seated in simple, modified carriages.

However, the carriages were packed to the brim, and the horses were breathing heavily, unable to move at a pace much faster than that of ordinary pedestrians.

When Zhao Xu emerged from the transmission portal at the "Magic Association Branch" within the original city of Luca, he already sensed the abnormal atmosphere among the high-ranking magicians.

After verifying his issued certification, the magicians barely even exchanged a greeting and urged him to leave quickly.

Zhao Xu, who had come from the city of Mysterra, showed no interest at all. It was evident that he was more concerned about the current situation, which was right in front of his eyes, like a fire burning in his eyebrows.

Vivian, on the other hand, was wearing a custom-made +5 silver full-body armor suit, which, based on the original 8-layer full-body armor, had received a +5 magic enhancement, directly increasing the total armor defense by 13 layers.

Not to mention the +3 activated shield mirror pendant on her waist, which provided 2 layers of defense and, when combined with the 3-layer magic bonus, resulted in a total shield defense value of 5 layers.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Simultaneously activating the ability to enhance her value (+2) can free her from her entangled hands, and the mirror-mapping ability (+5 value) can activate once a day, just like the "Spell Reversal" spell in the "Seven Rings" magic, reversing the spell. Adding her innate 9th-level shield as a devil and 1st-level agility defense bonus, Vevean's defense ability has reached 38 levels. With her 10-point damage reduction ability that can only be pierced by cold iron or holy weapons, Vevean can be considered a nearly unbeatable tank on the battlefield.

Ordinary monsters may appear weak, but once they gain professional levels or magical equipment, they will become extremely terrifying.

Vevean doesn't know whether it's due to the previous care of the Evil Mother Cygnus or the subsequent care of the May Lady, but her armor and shield are equivalent to a total value of "+10" equipment.

Far surpassing the actual "+2 value" of Zhao Xiu's "+1 Ghostly Scimitar".

These two magical equipment, priced over 200,000, are already in the legendary category.

At present, Vevean, as a 6HD ordinary devil, has upgraded her challenge level from 7 to 10 after reaching 3rd-level Saint Warrior. While she may not be able to fight, she can at least protect Zhao Xiu in front. Zhao Xiu, looking at the crowd, is also quite moved.

Or, this scene is familiar.

In the past, humans on Earth also went through a similar experience, facing the same desolate and treacherous wilderness.

70 billion people are not so easily settled, even on the vast continent of Artha, where humans are not suitable for building and agriculture, but still require manual labor to cultivate."
Here is the translation:

At this moment, Zhao Xu also feels a bit curious, although An Ti Nuo Ya and he have discussed border friction before, but this situation is still a bit exaggerated, as if the entire city wall was about to be moved. Especially, he can see many players amidst the refugee-like crowd. This indicates that this is also a disaster that they need to escape from. Although there are some passionate players, including priests and holy warriors, who are maintaining order within the group, it is still chaotic and disordered. The theme of this long snake-like refugee group is chaos, noise, numbness, and hurry. At this time, Zhao Xu gently urged his horse closer to a similarly gray-headed and dirt-faced warrior player who was trudging along the road with his head hung low.

"Hello, warrior player, can you tell me why so many people are traveling together?"

The originally somewhat black-faced warrior suddenly perked up at the title "player". After being immersed in this environment for three or four months, the residents of Camelot have begun to habitually refer to them as "players" rather than simply "Earth Adventurers" and the like. This also means that the opponent is an NPC. Looking at the wizard's dignified figure, with a majestic horse beneath him, Zhao Xu would not have dared to approach if it weren't for the presence of a knight in full armor standing guard beside him. Otherwise, Zhao Xu would have already been attacked by the unknown forces. For ordinary NPCs on this refugee road, they are just a burden. However, these high-level NPCs who can be seen at a glance are actually providing a lucrative bodyguard task.
Here is the translation:

The warrior seemed to see a shiny gold coin flying towards him and hurriedly said, "As things stand, there have been frictions between us and the Northern Alliance, and it seems like a storm is brewing. Many wealthy merchants and aristocrats have already fled the city, but as players, we're all just stuck with our mouths bleeding. Who knows, the Western Kingdom's Council of Elders has suddenly erupted into conflict, and the entire kingdom is on the verge of splitting into two factions. To make matters worse, the Northern Alliance has been frequently sending scouts to our borders."

"This scene looks like the prelude to a war breaking out. If it's just a simple war with the Northern Alliance, it might still be manageable, but right now, the Western Kingdom is on the brink of civil war, and with the Northern Alliance and the Eastern Empire intervening, it's impossible for Lukka City to remain neutral."

"As a result, many free citizens with some wealth have fled to the Northern Alliance, and the prices of real estate in the city have plummeted overnight." The young warrior player, clearly frustrated, let out a string of complaints.

Zhao Xu nodded silently.

These refugees from the war-torn areas are unlikely to jump back into the fire.

"What's the relationship with the Eastern Empire?" Zhao Xu asked, curious about the name mentioned by the other party.

The Eastern Empire, although vast in territory and population, is still far from meeting the standards of "kingdom" set by King Arthur, and is too far away from the Northern Alliance to be of any concern.

"This isn't the doing of the Eastern Empire's princess who married into the family. The Western Kingdom was originally governed by the Council of Elders, with the aristocracy and the three major families holding some influence."
Here is the translation:

"The princess who married into one of the families suddenly had her balance broken, and although she couldn't summon the eastern empire's million-strong army, the elite bodyguards accompanying her, who could be considered a significant force against the western kingdom with fewer than 20 towns, and even more so with the eastern empire's secret forces supporting them from behind the scenes."

"The warrior player may have spoken roughly, but he immediately picked out the key point.

"No mistake, especially among the major powers, at least they will lift a hand." Zhao Xu mumbled to himself before thanking the warrior.

In reality, major powers, from guilds to professional organizations, and even various churches and family forces, all know how to pull strings.

As the eastern empire, which is one of the few empires that can rival the scale of the western kingdom, the princess can receive assistance that may not be weaker than the tens of thousands of soldiers on the surface.

It is precisely because one believes that the other can succeed that the whole western kingdom can be stirred up.

If the current emperor of the eastern empire hadn't divided his attention among more than 20 princesses, the turmoil in the western kingdom might not have occurred.

Sometimes, it is precisely this awkward state that is the most troublesome.

However, according to Zhao Xu's memories from before he entered the game, everything returned to normal after he entered the game.

This turmoil will not last more than four months, and may even end within two months.

That's why he won't have much impression of it.

"'Mr. Zhongxia, they are too pitiful.' Vivia sighed as she rode her horse, her eyes unable to help but show a sympathetic expression.

She had just seen a peasant child from the western kingdom, who had fallen off a cart overloaded with goods, and the child's mother had rushed over to pick him up, but the child was already crying loudly.

Normally, the child would receive candy when crying, but now it's no longer possible."
Here is the translation of the text:

These refugees can only bring the most essential belongings with them, and in front of them, there is an unknown future waiting.

"You and I are like a drop of water in a sea, if we want to help them, we have to wait until we settle down," Zhao Xu said softly.

"I'm a bit worried," Vivian said with a slightly troubled expression, her gaze scanning the endless stream of people stretching out before her like an endless procession of ants, all the way to the ruins at the front - a ravaged wasteland.

Long shrouded in a deep mist, the ruins' existence had only become apparent, marking out a clear boundary between the two major forces.
