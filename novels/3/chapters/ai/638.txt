Chapter 639: The Formation of the Sword! The Realm of Demons!

The dimensional realm is interconnected, with the exception of a few dimensional connection points, each having its own unique natural laws.

For adventurers like Arthur, after reaching a high level, they can possess abilities such as the "Interdimensional Transport" skill, allowing them to venture into the Abyssal Deep to rescue imprisoned friends or set sail on the shining waters of the Sea God River.

They can visit the Garden of Joseph and share a cup of wine with the benevolent giant, or explore the mystical realm of the Wise Sage in the Hunyuan Sea, or visit the city of the Thousand Gates in the Harmony Domain, where they can learn about the various sects and legendary stories.

In fact, without experiencing the interdimensional world, one cannot truly experience the authentic adventure of Arthur.

Reflecting on the secrets of the Abyssal Deep and the devilish dignitaries who have fought alongside Arthur, Zhao Xu is filled with curiosity about the interdimensional world.

"Well, this precipice below is a naked dragon crystal mine, which is also the source of power for the 'Wraith Nation' and the strongest 'Devil Device' in the underground of the 'Wraith Nation'. It was personally set up by the Earth Lord Ernest with the intention of cultivating divine power."

"Years later, the God of Death, Nal, came to this place and took away my divine power. At that time, he was still too weak and needed the power of the divine artifact on my body to conceal his divine power. After he became powerful, he re-crafted me."

"What about later?" Zhao Xu exclaimed in surprise.
Here is the translation of the text:

However, I recalled the place where one's "steel will" could be awakened, which is also where the god of death was once tortured, known as the "Land of Punishment". I was once tortured there too, and I'm not someone who was born with a golden key. It's impossible to become a god without experiencing some extraordinary events.

"Ah, it seems that after the god of death was killed, my original seal contract allowed me to return to this land. Until many years later, I was brought back out by you."

"What's strange?" Xu Zhaohu was astonished. "You weren't originally the weapon of the spirit god, Korurun? How did you fall back to this place?"

At this moment, Xu Zhaohu couldn't help but recall that just like the "wooden stick" was a typical weapon of the goddess of magic, Sylvina.

The long sword was also the weapon worn by the spirit god himself, so the entire tribe of spirits were naturally skilled in wielding long swords, short swords, and longbows.

"Hah hah."

It was as if he was talking about his own private affairs, and the "Heavenly Court" let out a awkward laugh of two notes, saying, "This is a complex history. Anyway, after that, I was sealed away with these two unlucky fellows."

"However, the old man who held the 'Tao' was not doing well. He wouldn't have been able to perfect the entire Nine Swords System and spread it to the outside world if he hadn't been sealed away here."

With just one sentence, Xu Zhaohu realized that the old man, "Wu Bu", was probably several generations older than what he initially thought of as "Wu Er Gou".

It's also possible that another sealed wizard was also a contemporary of Ernest during his initial years.

"You don't need to think too much about this past history. When the time comes, someone will tell you about it." The Heavenly Court said.
Here is the translation of the text:

"When I was born, I was also born from the naked crystal mine below. These crystals, with their high purity and concentration, naturally released their abilities, which dispersed and gathered at the top of the giant sphere, where another device called the 'Energy Aggregator' was located."

Zhao Xu observed the sphere above, and if he added the starry dots, it would indeed be a natural celestial screen.

He had previously read the data on the Energy Aggregator and quickly understood. "So you're saying that once you add these dispersed energies, I can recreate you?"

"Not wrong," the mechanical sword replied, vibrating slightly. "Get ready, and I'll begin."

"Okay."

As soon as Zhao Xu finished speaking, the dark abyss in front of him suddenly transformed into a sea of light. Red-colored light rings, one layer at a time, rose to the top, illuminating the originally dark sphere-shaped screen, as if countless red-colored fish were swimming on the stone surface.

At this moment, Zhao Xu slowly flew to the central location, gazing at the "Paradise of Humanity" before him.

The Aetherite crystals, also known as "Bloodstones," were summoned by the light rings above, floating up one by one without needing to be mined. The Paradise of Humanity also shot out a golden light, like countless light threads spreading and dancing around, with mysterious characters etched on the threads.

However, Zhao Xu didn't give up and was not discouraged. He stared tightly at the "Paradise for Humans" in front of him. With his equipment enchanted, he began!

The main categories in the series of magical item production skills include eight items: transcription scrolls, potion brewing, manufacturing magical weapons or armor, manufacturing wands, manufacturing scepters, manufacturing staffs, forging rings, and creating rare items. However, even a passionate mage like Zhao Xu cannot produce all types of magical items on his own.

Zhao Xu, who had no expertise in any specific area, decided to start by transcribing a scroll. However, he could rely on the "Potential Point" to simulate the production of magical weapons or armor, which is a prerequisite for a level 5 mage.

Producing magical items is a time-consuming and labor-intensive process. According to the experience formula of mages, the final cost of producing an item is approximately 1,000 gold coins, which is equivalent to the time required for production. Zhao Xu wanted to forge a magical item with a total bonus of +10 in strength and enchantment.

At a price of 20,000 gold coins, it would take at least 200 days to produce. Fortunately, he was not starting from scratch. However, the materials and time required for general maintenance and repair would not be insignificant. The "Paradise for Humans" had brought him to this dragon crystal furnace specifically to produce magical items, which also utilized its own accelerating properties.

In this moment, Zhao Xu also calmed down and realized that the "Paradise for Humans" had discarded his past and allowed him to start anew. He also took a set of alchemy equipment worth 500 gold coins from his backpack and used the levitation spell to prevent it from falling. He would use it to assist in the production process later.

"Hidden Servant"!
Here is the translation of the text:

As soon as a few full-body invisible servants were created to serve him, they were also prepared to take on the roles of goldsmiths, woodworkers, and held some leather tools in their hands, ready to follow Zhao Xu's instructions to engrave and carve inscriptions.

Next, Zhao Xu began to activate his magical abilities.

Each "enchantment" besides its own craftsmanship, is essentially a fundamental requirement for the blacksmith to master the underlying magical principles.

School - familiarity with martial arts.

Urgent - two-ring "Feline Elegance".

Sparse - three-ring "Condensation Technique".

Shadow Pursuit - four-ring "Shadow Curse".

Transformation - five-ring "Ghost Axe God".

Fearless - five-ring "Righteous Qi Like a Rainbow".

Metamorphosis - five-ring "Ghost Axe God".

Proficient - six-ring "Tianmen Transformation Technique".

Destruction Protection - seven-ring "Limited Prayer Technique".

Some of these magical abilities, however, were still beyond Zhao Xu's capabilities at this time, and he could only rely on throwing out "scrolls" and satisfying the requirements for spellcasting, combined with the active help of "Heavenly Paradise", to forcefully overcome the limitations.

As the incantations were spoken, countless arcane characters began to take shape and disperse as starlight, floating around the "Heavenly Paradise". With the injection of each magical ability, the Heavenly Paradise continued to absorb the dragon's breath and energy from below.

It also kept emitting a loud rumbling sound.

At the same time, the surrounding space began to resonate with it.

In an instant, numerous players of mysterious caves began to notice that their long swords were emitting a sympathetic vibration, vibrating together, and many people were shocked.

"Stabilize me!" the Heavenly Paradise suddenly exclaimed.

"I still have strong divine attributes, originally requiring divine power to stabilize, but now it seems impossible."

Zhao Xu also realized that things were getting out of hand.
Here is the translation of the text:

"What's the consequence of not being suppressed?" he asked hastily.

"That means the artificial God of Death has sensed my breath and appeared here instantly, then killed you."

The method of making divine tools has long been lost in the mortal world.

He couldn't help but sigh, "If I had spent 200 days making a refined tool honestly, I wouldn't have done something like this."

As he spoke, Zhao Xun was frantically rummaging through his backpack and dimensional bag.

At this moment, he didn't care about anything and just threw the "Golden Core" into the pit, which could enhance the strength and quality of the weapon and overcome the hardness of ordinary armor.

If he didn't have more than 50 points of strength, he would have definitely fallen into the depths of the pit as soon as he pulled out the Golden Core.

However, after the Golden Core was absorbed, it continued to vibrate, and the frequency and amplitude of the vibration made it impossible to maintain the stability of the structure.

One after another, Zhao Xun threw his valuable items, including the "Mysterious Silver", which was similar to iron in hardness but lighter in weight, into the pit.

He also threw in the cold iron that was easy to forge at low temperatures and the various precious stones, including diamonds, obsidian, lapis lazuli, yellow jade, and red quartz, which had special effects.

Even with his current extravagant personality, he felt a little red-eyed and heart-aching.

"This is enough?"

"No, it's not enough! You should know that when I was forging, the two main gods each gave me a drop of blood. The noble tribe was born from a drop of divine blood given by Kerulon. What level do you think I am?"

"There's no divine blood, but human blood is available."
Here is the translation of the text:

As soon as Zhao Xu spoke, he drew out the secret silver dagger, slashed his wrist with it, and a tiny droplet of blood appeared.

He relied on his innate dragon skin technique to resist the pain, but he couldn't hold back his "Ghostly Strike" technique. With the secret silver dagger in his own hand, he slashed through his skin without any obstruction.

In an instant, Zhao Xu raised his arm and said, "You won't be able to die like Gao Congming, who sacrificed himself to become a divine weapon. I'll break you apart!"

As soon as the "Paradise for Humans" touched Zhao Xu's fresh blood, it became calm and the vibrations gradually decreased. However, it started shaking violently again, this time even more intensely.

The countless swords in the cave began to break apart on their own, including magical weapons. The sentinels near the transmission cave, who were guarding the entrance to the wilderness, also felt their long swords resonating strangely.

"What's going on? Is this blood of yours? It's even more tyrannical than the blood of the deep king I drank in the past!" the "Paradise for Humans" exclaimed. "Quickly use the reverse power to suppress me! The magical power in the blood is about to burst forth! I'll have to be torn apart!"

At this moment, Zhao Xu realized that he had reached the end of the road and had no way to retreat. He immediately pulled out the secret scroll that had been hanging from his waist, unwound it with one hand, and suddenly the arcane symbols on the surface emitted a flash of golden light.

In the next second, Zhao Xu read out the text on the scroll, which had the power to counteract magical powers:

"The Reverse Demon Domain!"

All things in heaven and earth converge to constrain the heroic spirit, and the heroic spirit is bound by the constraint.

For a mage, the Reverse Demon Domain is a true reflection of the phrase.

A transparent barrier suddenly surrounded Zhao Xu and moved with him.
Here is the translation of the text:

Inside a three-meter radius, anyone can enter, except for magic. All spells, similar spells, supernatural abilities, and all magical items and spellcasting are completely prohibited!

The "Paradise of Humanity" has returned to its peaceful state, but for a moment, it and Zhao Xu have lost the ability to fly. Both of them have become ordinary objects and are falling freely in the abyss.

"Not good, how can this mundane spell affect me, a divine artifact?" Zhao Xu struggled to speak.

"This is a magic scroll personally copied by the goddess Sylvia after she became a god, given to me after I went to the god's domain. I bled heavily this time, originally intending to leave it for the enemy of the divine artifact."

At this moment, the two are still falling, and even the slightest calm is interrupted by a turbulent airflow rushing towards them.

"How are you?" Zhao Xu struggled to speak, "I need to dispel the magic, or I'll die if I keep falling."

It has been several seconds, and they have fallen an estimated over a hundred meters. However, they have not reached the bottom yet, and the depth of the abyss is evident.

"Don't worry, I won't die from falling," the Paradise of Humanity responded, "I can be sure that I will soon break apart the suppression."

"You have nearly 300 life points, and even if you take 100 points of damage from falling, you won't die," Zhao Xu couldn't help but smile wryly, "I'm only a few dozen points now. Can I survive?"

As he spoke, he began to feel the red glow of the dragon crystal vein below him, indicating that he was close to the bottom.

"Sorry!"

In this moment, Zhao Xu could only make a quick decision.
At the very moment when the "release" command was issued.

The scroll that had been bestowed upon him suddenly shattered into "truth fragments"!

A deeply buried martial arts truth burst forth, and Zhao Xueming suddenly gained enlightenment. He immediately grasped his long sword and shouted: "Iron Heart's Power!"

Under the weight of a thousand jin, one person and one sword hung suspended in mid-air!
