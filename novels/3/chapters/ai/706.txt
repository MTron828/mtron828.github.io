Chapter 707: The Former Ernest

Even the lord of the abyss wouldn't dare to say no?

Zhao Xu was taken aback at this moment, realizing that he had underestimated his own strength.

This abyss is enormous, with at least over 666 layers. Not to mention the resources within, just the talent is difficult to quantify.

At this moment, Zhao Xu had already regarded the lords of the abyss as his own subordinates, summoning them with a wave of his hand.

Even if some lords of the abyss occupy a few layers, if you count the same-level powerful individuals who possess the strength of a lord, the total number would be over 1,000, which is not surprising.

The legendary mage Arthur had only lived for a few hundred years at most!

The former Zhao Xu thought that the position of "Lord of the Abyss" could only be obtained after defeating all the lords of the abyss. Or, he might be the chosen one of the "Will of the Abyss".
It's equivalent to an ancient dynasty receiving a "natural heir".

However, he couldn't resist the fact that there were over a thousand officials, generals, and governors in the capital, holding immense power. He felt that the position was not worth taking.

It's even less than the last emperor.

But after the "Boundless Realm" intention emerged, he finally understood.

He was the embodiment of the three great dragons of creation - Chaos - born with the power of the Arthurian universe, owning one-third of the creation's shares, and being one of the earliest three consciousnesses in this world. His identity is even more powerful than the Lord of the Abyss.

In fact, the entire abyss was created by him, including these demonic lords, each one being a derivative of his own.

It's like pulling a single hair from his body.
Here is the translation:

He is no longer the crown prince, but the founding emperor. His authority is unmatched, and no one can compare to him. However, he doesn't seem to be like Asmodeus, the ruler of the underworld, who relies on the power of order to control everything. As the founder of the company and the sole shareholder, he was born with the confidence to face the thousands of CEOs of subsidiary companies. He boldly takes on each identity and recovers them, without causing a stir. Who dares to question him?

In the underworld, aside from gods, there are countless powerful beings, such as the Immortal Emperor of the 113th layer, Ocyrus; the Urukhai of the 45-47th layer; the Demon Prince of the 88th layer; the Deceiver King of the 176th layer; and many others, including the Wind Demon King of the 1st layer, Pazuania; the Mother of Demons of the 471st layer, Cygnus; the King of the 222nd layer, Jupilix; the Queen of the 222nd layer, Zoromoy; the King of the 89th layer, Dugan; the King of the 600th layer, Buffement; and the King of the 663rd layer, Oksobbo.

Even the notorious Demon Queen of the 570th layer, Mekant. These Demon Lords are all formidable opponents, and no matter which one is taken out, they can still compete with the Lords of the 9th layer.
Here is the translation of the text:

The reason why Abyss hasn't taken control of all the outer layers is that it's constantly self-absorbed. Other demon lords saw Abyss's lower layer being invaded by the heavenly realm, and instead of providing support, they took advantage of the situation to stir up trouble, hoping that the opponent would be weakened by the heavenly realm's forces and then they could easily move in and occupy the next layer.

Abyss is only the Abyss of demons, and this is a consensus among people. Even the spider-woman Arachne, a demon, has occupied a layer in the Abyss.

For years, Abyss has been unconsciously nurturing these demons, making them forget everything.

It has made them believe that there are only internal enemies, and no external enemies.

Therefore, Ernest was able to easily enter the Abyss, which is not comparable to the current 11th-level Zhao Xu.

Even someone as cunning as Flavio, who can deceive gods, and Dymok, who is self-important, would not dare to confront Ernest.

But Ernest still refused.

Zhao Xu looked puzzled, wondering if his IQ was declining.

It wasn't that he was worried about Anethys's safety after Ernest's departure, and that's why he left all of Arthur's wealth behind, making all the gods from the elemental gods to the Abyss gods and the heavenly gods, all biting each other and fighting to the death.

At that time, the powerful "Abyss" force actually gave up?

How could this be? It doesn't make sense.

Just as Zhao Xu was about to argue against this, he looked at Anethys's pitiful face and swallowed his words back.

In an instant, he seemed to understand something.

(Note: I will not repeat the text or provide unnecessary details, and I will make sure to provide a clear and concise translation.)
Here is the translation of the text:

Even the magic empire couldn't inherit Anzhi Niya, and it's possible to take away the entire empire's wealth as a lure to make people fight each other.

It's obvious that a mediocre person has no guilt or shame.

Ernest, how dare he accept the position of "Lord of the Abyss" himself?

He's not afraid, but others are.

Will he leave it to Anzhi Niya?

Forget it!

The former enemy "Asmorthys" is watching closely.

It's clear that the current strength displayed by the Lord of the Abyss is strong enough to crush those deep-seated leaders, but it's still limited to the peak of divine power.

Moreover, in people's eyes, it's just a gift from hell. Once you're out of hell, it's useless.

And these deep-seated leaders are like caged tigers.

Unless the Abyss launches a comprehensive spatial invasion war, making all spatial Abysses, then the demon lords can truly be eternal.

But the Lord of the Abyss doesn't seem to be that simple.

It's currently displaying strength that doesn't match its former identity as one of the three creation dragons.

It's also hiding its strength, waiting for the Lord of the Abyss, also known as "Chaos", to appear.

This thousand-year slumber is on one hand for self-restoration, preparing to recover its strength step by step, trying to return to the peak of the creation dragon.

On the other hand, it's also searching for the existence of Zhao Xu, trying to eliminate him before he enters, and take the initiative.

The gods cannot truly descend upon Arthur.

But Asmorthys may not be the case, which is also its hidden trump card.

Zhao Xu finally realized.

Ernest acknowledged it, and it's over.

As long as he can stay in Arthur, he can at least maintain a balance with Asmorthys.
Here is the translation:

As soon as he left, he revealed his true identity as the master of the abyss. Therefore, Anziviler will only become the thorn in the eye of the lord of the nine prisons and the ruler of the afterlife. As for Asmodius, his head is too big, and even if he uses all his power, he may still not be able to kill the target. Thinking of this, Zhao Xu couldn't help but take a deep sigh.

Perhaps, life is full of such helpless situations. Thinking about this, Zhao Xu turned around and looked at the Anziviler he had reformed in his mind. He knew that he didn't have much time left here, and he hurriedly asked, "I left Arthur to become Ernest?"

This thing, the former Anziviler may not know about. But this Ernest has been there before, and was once the "bottomless realm" of his heart's shadow, and is now the "bottomless realm" of his heart's shadow, and will definitely know.

He was also thinking about the future trail.

What can be more comfortable than answering with a clear answer?

Especially for those who have already had a smooth life trajectory.

Anziviler slightly frowned and brushed her hair on the side of her face, "That place, you went." "What?" "Other dimensions of Arthur?"

Zhao Xu was taken aback, but soon he understood.

Yes.

He had been to the place he dreamed of in his dreams.

At this moment, Zhao Xu finally perfectly connected all the dots!

He finally understood that he had returned to the ancient era, witnessed the arrival of Ernest in Arthur's time, and saw the reaction of the "unspeakable terror"! It was the "unthinkable abyss"!

It turned out that he had left Arthur in the flow of time and gone to that terrifying world.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

As he arrived at the realm where the "God of Blind Folly" Asmodeus, the "Nameless Fog" Yog-Sothoth, the "Black Goat of the Forest" Shub-Niggurath, and the "Chaos of the Void" Nyarlathotep resided in the "World of Terror"!

The scholar of ancient lore, the alchemist, and the world of chaos!

At this moment, Zhao Xu felt as if he was being washed away by an icy torrent from the heavens, cleansing him from head to toe.

The current Arthur, the legendary magician, had reached the pinnacle of his craft.

However, an individual's efforts are ultimately limited by the era.

He didn't feel that he could surpass the final boundary, surpass the magic goddess, and find the threshold of the eleven rings, because this was the beginning that was sealed away by the creator dragon, which was meant to maintain the stability of the world.

He had eliminated the possibility of creating the eleven-ring magic on his own.

So, Ernest had mastered the eleven-ring magic as soon as he entered the era of magic, and he remained puzzled.

All speculations could only be attributed to the fact that he was an outsider from another realm.

Now, finally, the mystery has been unveiled.

He had learned the eleven-ring and twelve-ring magic in that terrifying world?

So, he relied on these super-ring magic to return to the ancient era of Arthur, which allowed him to re-establish the entire magical system.

But?

Was he Ernest?

Was he still the consciousness of "Zhao Xu" who had returned to the ancient era?

By joining the learning circle in the "World of Terror", he managed to prevent the world from collapsing.

Zhao Xu had always been unable to accept the possibility that he might be "Ernest", which was something he couldn't explain.

If in the future of Arthur, he became the strongest magician in the world, then he returned to the past and re-taught the magic he had learned.
Here is the translation of the text:

Now, these magical abilities he has learned, even the basic professions and advanced skills he learned from Anzai, are all Ernest's legacy, yes?

Is he passing it on to himself?

This is like a snake that eats its own tail and lives, a paradox in itself.

Even listening to it, the entire magic seems to appear out of thin air, with no trace of establishment.

Adding the "Terror World" ring, it makes sense to a certain extent.

At this moment, Zhao Xu looked at Anzai silently, with a curious expression. "However, I still have a hard time understanding."

"Why did I refuse to become a god when I had the memories of the future and possessed the Overring magic?"

The gods are too powerful a target, and the fact that they are the focus of attention, plus the encounter with the "Saint Descending" from the future, makes it understandable that Anzai was not allowed to become a god.

But what about Ernest?

He knows that Ernest's soul reflection, which has experienced the past, can certainly provide an explanation.

However, Anzai shook her head.

"In Arthur's world, becoming a god will inevitably reveal that he is the Overlord of the Abyss. Because at that moment, all the chaotic powers in the heavens and earth will return to him."

"All gods involved in chaotic divine offices and chaotic domains will automatically become his divine servants. At that moment, the entire Abyss will become his unquestionable divine kingdom, which is not what he wants."

Yes, revealing one's identity and not wanting to take it, this is understandable.

And it's also understandable to fear the Nine Prisons' Lord.
Here is the translation of the text:

"The second point is that even if he has the ability to crush any god, it's not a big deal. The magic itself is a powerful attack method that can take on multiple opponents. With the eleven-ring and twelve-ring magic, he won't be afraid of being attacked by the gods.

The third point is that the gods cannot betray their divine duties. Ernest admires the true power that reaches the other side of the world, and after barely breaking free from the shackles, he doesn't want to be bound by the will of chaos again.

After listening to these simple points, Zhao Xu suddenly felt a sense of awe.

In the future, he was too amazing, too powerful.

Good grief, he didn't even deign to the Lord of the Abyss?

Hmm.

Zhao Xu couldn't help but shake his head, still, this was him.

At this moment, Anzhiya smiled slightly, "Are you satisfied with these answers? Can you accept the position of the Lord of the Abyss?"

"Initially, Ernest could easily refuse, but it's because of his own confidence, but you're not the same, you need his power now."

Zhao Xu nodded slightly, but suddenly stopped.

"That's not right, Ernest appeared before Arthur, or rather, before the terrifying world, how did I choose?"

Zhao Xu looked puzzled and rephrased the question.

Anzhiya shook her head, "I don't know, this is a historical event that has already occurred in the future, and I can't predict Ernest, no, I mean your actions, Master Zhao."

Zhao Xu was perplexed, "No, you're not his will, you can see his memories, can't you?"

"Sorry, Mr. Ernest, when he descended upon Arthur."

"He had already forgotten everything, forgotten all people."
