Chapter 516: Ashen Dawn, Final Day

"Thud." The sound echoed, and the vampire suddenly fell to the ground, his body stiff like a robot whose battery had been removed.

Zhao Xuan gazed at the dragon lying beside him, snoring loudly. He threw the remaining wooden stake at it with a hint of annoyance.

With his strength exceeding 40 points, Zhao Xuan casually threw the stake, which would easily shatter even a wooden door. His strength was enough to demonstrate his prowess.

The dragon, which had been sleeping loudly, suddenly rolled over its body like a fish jumping out of the water, dodging the approaching stake with incredible agility.

Then, "thud," the stake struck the stone steps, which were serving as a pillow. The wood splintered, and the pieces mixed together, bearing witness to Zhao Xuan's effortless tossing.

"Killed the dragon!" White Dragon Selsius exclaimed, unable to help himself.

Even with his own dragon-scaled armor, which was born of natural defense, Selsius estimated that he would not be able to withstand such a powerful blow.

"Since you're asleep, don't bother coming," Zhao Xuan lectured.

"You should know that a great white dragon like me, although not afraid of these blood-sucking insects, will often come to bother someone who thinks too little of me. And it's quite annoying."

Selsius shook his head, as if explaining his recent sleeping behavior to himself.

As he spoke, he walked up to the vampire, looking down at him, "Is this thing really a vampire? It doesn't seem to have any special features except for its sharp fangs."
Here is the translation of the text:

"You touch its outer skin, and it's not ordinary skin, but a natural defense scale of the 6th grade," said Zhao Xu. "Or you can just use a mirror to reflect it, as there's no reflection in the vampire mirror."

White Dragon Selerus's eyes lit up, and he couldn't help but stretch out his hand to touch the wooden stake inserted into Zhao Xu's heart.

"You're going to pull it out, and then you'll be responsible for catching yourself back," Zhao Xu warned, seeing the look of mischief on the other's face.

White Dragon Selerus quickly withdrew his hand, looking embarrassed. "I remember that the vampires that were staked died, didn't they?"

"Although this vampire is powerful, this species still has some resilience, otherwise it wouldn't be able to transform into a vampire and level up to level 8," Zhao Xu said.

"Vampires themselves have the ability to quickly heal, recovering 5 points of life each round."

As Zhao Xu spoke, he was also organizing materials for his future post, saying, "Even if you kill the vampire, when its life force falls below zero, it will transform into its gaseous form at that moment, and it will be completely immune to damage."

White Dragon Selerus, who was usually calm, couldn't help but feel astonished, "So this vampire is unbeatable? No way, I'll go try to become a blood-drinking dragon too."

"You've seen a non-human vampire?" Zhao Xu corrected. "Only humans or human-like monsters can do that. Your dragon tribe doesn't have a connection to that. If you want to try, there are opportunities with undead dragons or skeleton dragons. If you have such thoughts, I have a wand that can help you achieve your wish."

"Okay, okay, just kidding, you don't understand our dragon tribe's humor," White Dragon Selerus apologized, as if recalling the undead dragons he had seen flying with skeletal remains, which were a shame to the dragon tribe.

As Sirius listened intently, Zhao Xu continued to explain, "However, their abilities are not so invincible. After their life force is depleted, they must return to their coffins within 2 hours, or they will be destroyed."

"That's how you subdue vampires," he said. "If I had just used my fireball spell, even with maximum damage, I could kill the vampire instantly. But in the instant their life force drops to zero, they will automatically transform into a gas and escape."

"To completely kill a vampire, there are several methods. One is to stake them, which will directly cause their death. However, once the stake is removed, the vampire will revive."

"The other methods are to expose them to sunlight or wash them with water," Zhao Xu explained.

Just then, Sirius suddenly nodded, "I seem to remember that sunlight will disorient vampires, and if they can't escape the sunlight, they will be destroyed."

"As for washing them with water?" Sirius suddenly realized that the future employer in front of him was Zhao Xu.

In terms of knowledge, Zhao Xu was always profound and insightful, and he quickly learned.

Zhao Xu was naturally happy to teach and immediately explained, "Vampires cannot pass through water unless they are on a boat or in a coffin being carried by someone. Therefore, if you put them in water, they will lose one-third of their life force each time, until they are completely destroyed."

As Zhao Xu finished speaking, he reminded, "Bind them up and book a water treatment package for them."

"Not to mention that life force below zero will transform?" Sirius was amazed.

"Soaking in water will cause them to lose one-third of their life force each time, until they are just about dead," Zhao Xu explained.

"Come, tie them up and carry them back to the room, then hang them up," Zhao Xu ordered.

"Ah?"

White Dragon Serus thought that he would be going to the nearest river next, but what a situation he found himself in?

"It's fine, I'll just wait in the room and then use the Daylight spell to create a high-intensity sunlight environment, and also use the Four Rings technique 'Illusion' to create a fake stream."

"So after I pull out the wooden stake, I'll be under triple threat of death, and I won't believe he won't reveal the truth."

"Ah, what's the third option?" White Dragon Serus was astonished.

Zhao Xuan said calmly, "Cut off his head and pour holy water into his mouth."

"Mom's egg, you humans are ruthless," White Dragon Serus sighed.

... until the middle of the night, when the three-wheel blood moon reached its highest point in the sky, White Dragon Serus gasped for breath, carrying a heavy war hammer from the somewhat dilapidated room.

After transforming into a human, he was clearly exhausted, "This vampire's mouth is really tight, but it's not like the White Dragon Grandpa is going to torture him out of him."

Zhao Xuan, who had been watching from the side without moving a muscle, explained, "That vampire was created by a higher-level vampire. If we kill the higher-level vampire, all the lower-level vampires will be destroyed. Naturally, it will die to keep the secret."

"Why, it's no wonder that this foolish vampire, despite being unable to protect itself, dares to say that it will grant you eternal life. Isn't it ridiculous? It has to protect itself for a lifetime."

White Dragon Serus immediately cursed, "Damn it, to seek eternal life, I have to worship my ancestors. I won't do it."
Here is the translation:

"It's only natural," Zhao Xu said. "Unless it exceeds the target quantity of slavery, there will be no opportunity for the release of names from slavery."

Zhao Xu shook his head, "However, it's obvious that it has increased its strength by 8 levels, bringing the possibility of eternal life, and he has become confused and lost his sense of self."

Becoming an undead creature is the fastest way to achieve "alternative eternal life", but it's not something to be considered by those seeking eternal life. It's not like becoming a lich, which requires an 11th-level mage to achieve.

Compared to having various powerful abilities and eternal life, even the ability to create vassals as a "vampire" will undoubtedly give people a sense of "illusory" power.

"Hmm," White Dragon Sereus sat on the well, looking at Zhao Xu with a slightly worried expression. "Although it's not my usual level of expertise, the organization behind it is significant."

As he spoke, he finally looked at Zhao Xu with a worried expression, "This is the most mysterious organization of King Arthur, 'Pale Dawn'."

"It's estimated that the vampire is on the periphery, with no core involvement. However, regardless of the situation, this means you have entered the scope of this mysterious organization."

"Have you heard of it?" Zhao Xu asked back.

"I heard that the ancient dragon mentioned it when he was blowing his own horn, saying that the organization sent someone to visit the Ice Mountain Range. However, at the time, the ancient dragon had lost a batch of treasures and was too lazy to participate,"

As for Zhao Xu, he remained silent.

In fact, he knew the existence of this organization better than anyone else.

However, he didn't expect this organization to show its tracks so quickly, even before the player had crossed over.
Here is the translation of the text:

Like the wizard association to which Zhao Xu belongs, strictly speaking, it is mainly composed of humans living in the material plane and united together. On the other hand, "Cyan Dawn" is a massive organization that spans multiple species and planes.

This organization advocates and promotes the idea that Arthur will eventually face the "End of Days", and everything will be destroyed and empty. As for the members of the organization, their mission is to prepare to fight against this "End of Days" or to preserve their strength to ensure their safety until the "End of Days". It is unknown whether they will achieve this goal.

Zhao Xu knows this because his past life, Cui Lu, joined this organization, and people even suspected that her strength could rapidly increase due to the organization's help. It is likely that Cui Lu was also noticed by the organization when they intervened in the Starfall Town. As for this life, Zhao Xu gained a deeper understanding of the organization after browsing books in the Floating City.

This is an organization backed by many legendary strong individuals, and even those with divine powers. For example, people like Cui Lu, who had a deep connection with Zhao Xu in their past life, only learned about the organization by chance.

As for the players and even the residents of Arthur's town, how many of them are secret members of this massive and mysterious organization is unknown.

Especially, not long ago, he heard from Anniya about the legend of Arthur's "End of Days". The idea of this "organization" somehow coincides with this concept!
