Chapter 298: The Power of the Overlord's Rod

The sound of the second-tier rifle was sharp and piercing, even from a distance, it was as if a cold wind was blowing, making it impossible for anyone on the scene to react in time. Not to mention dodging, even the thought of Zhao Xu's fate was not even formed.

Only the high-ranking officials standing beside Zhao Xu, who were themselves skilled players with excellent reaction times and battle experience, were able to see the instantaneous reaction to the rifle's shot.

As for the Frost Saber, he was even faster. He had already pushed his body to its limits, trying to lift the circular shield in his hand to block the rifle's shot.

As for the players on the scene trying to cast spells to intercept, it was simply impossible. Even before the standard action was complete, the wind mage would probably be dead.

After understanding Zhao Xu's magical equipment, the Frost Saber had realized that the wind mage was undoubtedly the key person for this task.

As the leader of the guild, he was clear that in times of crisis, he had to make a choice and allocate limited survival opportunities.

He had to make a decision that maximized benefits.

At this moment, the wind mage was the person who could not die.

This was also the reason why Zhao Xu didn't explain it himself, but wanted Chen Nu to use his detection magic. In an unfamiliar team, he needed to have a strong position and prestige to influence key decisions.

However, Zhao Xu wasn't worried about the rifle at all.

It wasn't that he was relying on his "Starlight Cloak".
Here is the translation of the text:

Before embarking on his adventure, Zhao Xū had set rules for himself. He decided to keep the "Starlight Cloak" as his last resort, as a final defense, rather than the first line of defense.

Zhao Xū's methods had already exceeded everyone's imagination. He was staring at the spear gun as it drew closer and closer, starting to cast a spell just as it was about to touch his body.

At this moment, Shě Jiàn's expression turned disheartened, knowing that a great opportunity had been lost due to his carelessness.

However, Zhao Xū simply waved his hand and chanted a brief incantation.

A spell that exceeded everyone's imagination, as fast as a falcon's flutter, could be completed just by thinking about it.

Instinctive action!

Preemptive strike!

A massive and shattered wing unfolded from Zhao Xū's back, like the wings of a giant dragon, overlapping together to form an impenetrable shield.

The spear gun, which had seemed like a thunderbolt, only got within an inch of the spherical force field barrier before directly falling to the ground.

This scene left the mages in attendance with a start, but they didn't know why.

This was the mages' unique two-ring spell, able to definitely block 100% of the next attack.

Zhao Xū didn't bother with everyone's gaze and urgently shouted, "The opponent has decided to wipe us out completely, quickly form a defensive array!"

A few slow-reacting players, like waking up from a dream, began to tighten up their formation, facing the direction of the spear gun's attack.

Zhao Xū knew that today's battle would be difficult to win the moment the warrior with the shield fell down.
If they are defeated, the pastor and supporting units, it is likely that Frost Sword will directly issue a retreat order.

At this moment, everyone's gaze is fixed on the dense forest ahead, where the three giant monsters have already poked their heads out. The faces of the members of the Guardian's Guild are not very good-looking.

After the Battle of Star Lake, the information about the monsters that appeared at the time was posted on the forum, and each guild has done a thorough analysis and research. Giant monsters are particularly troublesome creatures.

They can be found in extreme environments, from polar deserts to tropical grasslands. These terrifying meat-eaters often attack merchant caravans and prey on their opponents.

"The giant monsters have greedy appetites, and they eat everything from worms to human-like beings without hesitation," Po Lu, the team's poet, exclaimed, waking everyone up and reminding them not to enter the giant monsters' stomachs.

In fact, no one needed to be reminded at this moment, as everyone saw the giant monsters and felt their stomachs churn.

The three giant monsters were all over three meters tall, with rough, rubber-like skin, and a green, moss-like appearance, with a grayish-green mottled color. The tops of their heads were covered with curly, wool-like things, also gray-green. Their legs were long and thin, with three-toed, large feet that pressed firmly on the ground. Their arms were also extremely long, making their upper bodies appear hunched.

"Be careful of the giant monsters' claws, which can tear apart living beings," Frost Sword reminded loudly, pointing out the giant monsters' special abilities.

After just one round of tight formation, the shield of the first row of defenders had already been raised, struggling to withstand the giant monsters' repeated attacks with their spears.
Here is the translation:

Zhao Xu's gaze was deeply fixed on the giant demon in the middle, and his facial expression also changed accordingly. "The one in the middle might be a 'Giant Hunter', who has taken on the level of a Forest Ranger and may have a challenge level of over 10." As soon as he finished speaking, even the warriors who had already raised their shields couldn't help but feel a jolt in their hearts.

Ordinary giant demons are only 4th-level challenge, within the range of what they can handle. However, the Giant Hunter with a challenge level of over 10 has a crushing advantage over them.

As soon as the words left his mouth, the three giant demons began to rapidly throw their spears. This time, the warriors' shields didn't manage to defend in time, and another loud cry of pain echoed through the air.

Glacier noticed that the Forest Ranger in the team was still fiddling with his quiver, failing to form a pressing formation against the enemy. He hastily shouted, "Quick, fire away!"

But his younger sister, Snow, frowned, saying, "Giant demons have regenerative abilities, without fire or strong acid, they cannot cause normal damage."

"Hold on, don't shoot yet," Glacier decided on the spot. "Let's cause non-lethal damage first."

Regenerative ability is a powerful recovery ability, unless targeted with a specific attack, ordinary attacks will only cause non-lethal damage.

In general, non-lethal damage can be sufficient to exceed the opponent's life value, causing them to fall into a coma or lose consciousness. However, to kill, you still need to deal a fatal blow, which is usually achieved through fire or strong acid.

For example, giant demons have 5 points of regenerative ability, and they can recover 5 points of non-lethal damage every round.

So, even though they can use their weapons to cause non-lethal damage, putting the giant demon into a coma, and then trying to find a way to burn the opponent to death, the process of causing non-lethal damage means that each of the three giant demons can recover 5 HP every round.
Here is the translation of the text:

If they can't deal enough damage to ordinary giants with over 60 HP and giant hunters with over 130 HP, they won't be able to defeat them.

Members of the Guardian's Guild are positioning themselves according to their professions, starting to use various profession abilities, such as the bard's song, the priest's buff spell, and so on.

Even the mage is using "magic missiles" to attack the giants.

Zhao Xu doesn't care about all that and directly points at the quiver on the snowman's back and says, "Fire arrow!"

Instantly, a red glow like a burning flame falls on the quiver, and the 50-odd arrows inside immediately burst into flames.

"Arrows shot from the snowman's quiver, which I have enchanted with my three-ring spell, all have fire damage," Zhao Xu said.

At this time, Shuang Jian is also very happy and quickly distributes the 50-odd fire arrows.

The three-ring spell "Fire Arrow" can directly turn projectiles into fire-infused projectiles, saving the trouble of processing and adding an additional 1-6 HP of fire damage, which is just enough to counter the giants' regenerative abilities.

After Zhao Xu obtained information about the enemy, his spell reserve was enough for him to take aim at the enemy's weak point.

After the Guardian's Guild replaced the fire arrows, although the giants, relying on their natural armor and concealment due to distance, were not successfully hit by a few arrows.

However, the fire arrows from the Hunter's Guild, after one round of throwing, successfully ignited the hidden forest, and the surrounding flames forced the giants to stop using the throwing spear tactic to suppress the players.

At this time, the giants reacted and directly swung their arms at the arrayed players, with the central giant even wielding a battle axe.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

Frost Sword's expression remained calm and composed as he began to arrange his subordinates to face the enemy in sequence.

"Behind us, there are hundreds of goblins!" exclaimed the player responsible for scouting.

As they turned around, they saw hundreds of goblins wielding pikes and great axes, charging towards them, with the dust kicked up by their feet.

The players on the scene were taken aback by the sheer number of goblins, and Frost Sword's heart felt like it had been chilled to the bone.

No matter how many hundreds of goblins or three giant trolls there were, Frost Sword had the confidence to take them on individually. However, when they combined to launch a simultaneous attack, their damage output would be insufficient, and they would be killed off one by one by the giant trolls in the ensuing battle.

Just as everyone was guessing that there were no more spell slots left for the mad wizard, he suddenly spoke out in an icy tone.

As Frost Sword lifted his eternal staff, he spent about the same amount of time as normal to cast the spell, releasing the stored magic in the staff towards the dense group of goblins charging towards them - "Fireball."

As the fireball shot out, filled with explosive force, Frost Sword instantly lifted his "High-Speed Magic Release Wand" and drove the wand's power.

In an instant, Frost Sword's spell was boosted by the "Magic Release" ability, which originally required complex incantations, releasing the spell in less than a syllable.

In that instant, two fireballs simultaneously charged towards the goblins in front of them.
This scene, even the spellcasters present were left with their mouths agape. When can one release two "fireball" spells simultaneously within a single round of time? Currently, Arthur, there is no player who can master the "Instant Spell Release" specialization.
