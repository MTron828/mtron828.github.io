Chapter 384: Offline Gathering

As everyone else stood there in stunned silence, Viola sprang into action, swinging her sword in a swift and decisive motion. "Break the curse!"

For Viola, every strike felt like her last, and she poured all her energy into each blow. Her sacred avenger, imbued with holy power, emitted a piercing coldness, its tip aimed straight for the outstretched hand.

In the blink of an eye, the glass vial containing the elixir shattered, and the claw-like hand that had reached out to grab it suddenly fell to the ground. The hand itself began to dissolve, slowly merging with the earth.

The entire process was so swift that Zhao Xu didn't even have time to cast a spell at the outstretched hand. Even the other onlookers, who had just blinked, couldn't believe their eyes.

The mysterious creature that had attempted to snatch the elixir was repelled by Viola's sword strike.

"What's going on?" someone asked, eyes wide with terror. "That severed hand was still flailing about on the ground!"

This sword strike had also revised everyone's assessment of Viola's strength.

Zhao Xu squatted down to examine the now-muddy outline of the severed hand. He carefully picked up some of the remaining fragments, only to find that they quickly dispersed, absorbed by the earth.

Zhao Xu then retrieved the shattered glass vial and, though he looked puzzled, he couldn't shake off the feeling that he had seen something similar before.

He recalled the time he had killed the "Deep Furnace Fiend" and witnessed the opponent's corpse decomposing into a stench-filled mess.
Here is the translation of the given text:

At that time and in front of me, the scene was very similar.

Vivian, who witnessed this scene, also confirmed with Zhao Xuguang, "My Dispel Magic has taken effect, and indeed, the other party is an evil being. Furthermore, this mark is very similar to the mark left by our demonic tribe after death."

Initially, Zhao Xuguang suspected that the other party had infiltrated his dream, and soon reacted by recognizing his old acquaintance, the Old Witch.

Among the common monsters, the Old Witch is one of the few that possess the ability to infiltrate dreams.

Who would have thought that the mysterious being in front of him would also display qualities similar to those of demons and devils?

Zhao Xuguang casually handed Vivian a bottle of "Divine Cuisine," smiled and said, "Here, take it."

However, Vivian looked puzzled, saying, "It feels like something extracted from my own body, a bit strange."

"This is just an emotional byproduct," Zhao Xuguang explained, looking at the strange gazes of the people around him.

Divine Cuisine is a materialized form of "joy," which can be used to create benevolent magic items, serve as special ritual materials, and also a non-addictive beverage.

Some celestial beings rely on drinking Divine Cuisine for sustenance.

After drinking Divine Cuisine, ordinary humans like Zhao Xuguang can soothe their emotions, erase non-life-threatening injuries and pain, and alleviate sadness and melancholy, which can last for 2-5 hours.

It can also treat mild 1HP injuries.

Zhao Xuguang had wanted to try it when he learned the three-ring magic spell, but it was difficult to find a suitable target species.
Here is the translation of the text:

It is rare for those who are deeply in love, artists who are creating their life's masterpiece, or those who have experienced great joy, to achieve success easily. Such individuals are hard to find.

As the night wore on, the area gradually returned to its normal quiet state. It was as if the existence of the undead had been scared away by Vivian's sword.

As a result, everyone gradually returned to their normal sleep schedule.

The mysterious attack by the undead also became a minor episode in the journey. By the next day, the number of people discussing it had decreased significantly.

Zhou Xu had heard the mysterious seal of the tomb from the mouth of the deceased, which was connected to his notebook. Although he had not given up, he had to temporarily put it aside. He decided to wait until he had settled down in the Star Lake before returning to this place through the teleportation portal.

At that time, they would no longer have to worry about the aftereffects of the battle affecting the civilians.

After spending two days, Zhou Xu and his group finally followed the vanguard and left the desolate wasteland.

At this point, everyone had finally relaxed their heavy hearts. The Iron Fist City, the closest to the Northern Alliance, was no longer far away.

However, they did not know that.

After they left, a figure could be seen emerging from the depths of the wasteland, shrouded in thick fog. The figure was carrying a heavy burden and was limping forward.

Only his hand was missing a block, but it was still growing continuously.

After returning home, Zhou Xu was unable to play the Arthur game as fiercely as before.

After leaving the wasteland, Zhou Xu decided to separate from the main group and advance with Vivian.
Here is the translation of the text:

Vivian is a mage who possesses the ability of "Higher Teleportation" by herself. The only limitation is that she cannot carry more than 50 kilograms of weight together during teleportation, which means she cannot bring Zhao Xu along. However, she can rely on this ability to find a place to rest on her own when Zhao Xu leaves the game.

Every time Zhao Xu logs in to the game, Vivian can teleport to his location within two rounds without him notifying her. At this moment, Zhao Xu is sitting at the dining table, eating beef and blue cheese salad, and thinking about his next move. His mother is watching the soup in the kitchen, while his father has not returned home for dinner due to a business invitation.

Zhao Xu's mother feels that this dinner is full of meaning in life, while Zhao Xu is about to finish his meal, thinking that being able to eat is a blessing and that he will never have to eat again. Magicians and paladins can use their spells to recreate some of the original Earth's food, but only up to the level of a three-ring farmer. The six-ring hero's banquet, on the other hand, can create a rich and luxurious feast, even healing diseases and providing 12 hours of toxin immunity and temporary life value.

Eating at this time has become a positive buff behavior. Suddenly, a small unique asked Zhao Xu, "Hey, how about playing with your old high school friends?" Zhao Xu did not answer directly.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Ah." South Xiaoyi sucked on the chopsticks and glanced up, her attention suddenly drawn to the new batch of lamb ribs soup that had just been brought out.

Zhao Xu had also had a rich and colorful high school life, but many times, when he entered a new environment, he had to bid farewell to the past.

Former classmates had gradually become memories, and even if Zhao Xu tried to hold on tightly, they could only become nostalgic reminiscences.

Because they were no longer growing together in the same soil.

At this moment, Zhao Xu opened his phone, and the top message was an invitation from his high school classmates to gather for dinner tomorrow.

"Hey, Brother Xu," South Xiaoyi suddenly called out in a voice that made Zhao Xu's back sweat.

"Don't."

Zhao Xu quickly interrupted, "Say what you want to say, and if you want me to help you with that, I'm not unwilling..."

But before Zhao Xu could finish speaking, South Xiaoyi stretched out his hand and stopped him from saying more.

"What's this I hear, you're playing as Arthur?" Zhao Xu was astonished.

He had mentioned it to South Xiaoyi once before, but the other person had just scoffed.

"Anyway, I'm too far away from you, hundreds of kilometers, and it's not possible to take you along."

Zhao Xu said, revealing the harsh truth.

Actually, it wasn't impossible to take him along, but he was too busy.

Right now, he hadn't even joined the wizarding association yet, let alone gone through the wizarding association in Starfall Town to control the player group.

"Not true," South Xiaoyi said with a smug face, flashing a friendly smile. "The main thing is that my classmates are taking me to KTV tomorrow."

"Fake boyfriend, no way," Zhao Xu immediately refused, "Remember when you helped me in middle school and got me into trouble by posting on campus forums, making me get jeered at on the street?"

"You're saying I'm profiting from this, and that's okay. The problem is, I'm not."
Here is the translation of the text:

"What are you talking about, taking advantage of someone? At this moment, Zhao Mu couldn't help but stand up, knock on Zhao Xu's head, and then walk into the kitchen to serve the two of them with food.

"Alright, you think your appearance is enough to get me to give you some credits?"

South Xiaoyu looked down on him and said, "It's mainly because we're all playing as Arthur, so I want you to help me take the lead and make them less pretentious in front of me."

Just as Zhao Xu finished speaking, Zhao Xu looked at South Xiaoyu with a serious expression, "Hey, you guys, high school students, don't you think about preparing well for the college entrance examination?"

"Spending all day messing around, how can you compare to the vocational school?"

South Xiaoyu looked at Zhao Xu with a surprised expression, "I said, Zhao Xu, when did you last care about your life's luck?"

"I've already been accepted by a key university."

South Xiaoyu smiled smugly, as if telling Zhao Xu that reading books is for the college entrance examination, while I read books because I like reading.

"Well, what time is it tomorrow?"

Zhao Xu looked at the watch his mom gave him as a New Year's gift, a digital watch, and told him that there was still a day to go until tomorrow.

Just in time, let's finish both gatherings.

"Remember to memorize these contents," South Xiaoyu said, sending a bunch of web links to Zhao Xu through WeChat.

"What's this for?"

Zhao Xu was taken aback for the first time to receive a private chat from someone sending a collection of "East City Lin's Arthur Strategy Post" and other posts.

"I'm blowing you off as a mage high player, so you need to do your homework well, and tomorrow I'll take care of those frivolous girls for you," South Xiaoyu said with a self-satisfied tone.

As she spoke, her eyes widened in surprise, "You don't even know East City Lin, and you still dare to blow yourself off as a high player?"

Zhao Xu shook his head in embarrassment.

And he deleted all the linked posts."
This phenomenon is all in his mind, and he alone has the final say.
