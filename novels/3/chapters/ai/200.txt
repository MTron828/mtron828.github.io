Chapter 201, 4th grade

After seeing this scene, Zhao Xu was even hesitant to believe it. It was definitely not possible for the "Magic Notebook" in his hand to suddenly fall to the ground.

The saying "things born from the same source" suggests that the notebook in his hand was not the only one from the beginning.

"Lacis, is that so?" Lacis exclaimed in disbelief.

It was clear that Lacis had just said that the "Magic Notebook" in Zhao Xu's hand was fine, but it turned out that it had unlimited pages. However, just a few minutes later, it was revealed to be fake.

Zhao Xu, on the other hand, remained calm and collected, slowly walking towards the notebook and picking it up.

Just as the ghost had said earlier, this notebook was brought out by the opponent's ancestor from a mysterious tomb.

This was consistent with what Andy had said, that the opponent's ancestor had also brought out the notebook from a mysterious tomb.

"Is there a problem, Lacis?" Zhao Xu asked.

At this moment, Lacis quietly scanned the other notebook in front of her and said, "Master, just like the one you had before, it also has unlimited pages and records with spiritual energy."

So, it's just a duplicate?

Zhao Xu then used his own method to continue using the "Eye of Insight" on the notebook in front of him.

After the magic information flowed back to himself, Zhao Xu confirmed that the notebook in front of him was identical to the one he had taken from Andy.

Even if someone were to swap the notebook and copy the contents, he would not be able to detect it.

"Lacis, I've checked, and it's indeed free of curses," Lacis said.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Ah, a ghost just appeared inside, didn't you notice?" Zhao Xu said mercilessly, poking fun at Lark's words.

"No, that's because this is the Underworld's temple, so it's normal for there to be a lingering aura of ghosts," Lark explained weakly, defending her own dignity.

After the joke, Lark didn't notice the problem, and Zhao Xu just opened the notebook in front of him.

The notebook contained very little content, with many scattered sentences. Among them was the content that Zhao Xu had seen in the broken notebook before.

The ancestor of the ghost, who had realized that his own self was being possessed by a devil, dared not say much in the notebook brought back by his descendant.

The ghost's ancestor had originally recounted his experiences exploring the tomb, including how he discovered the notebook.

In reality, they had only found a magical notebook.
At that time, everyone wanted that notebook, and the magical one was indeed exactly as they had wished, with the notebook being divided into seven parts, with each of the seven tomb explorers taking one.

Perhaps it was the ancestor of the commander who recorded these words, and his descendants later leaked the contents.
This was what led to the commander's words, and his wife married him because of the existence of the notebook, which also planted a seed of betrayal for the future.

After reading it roughly, Zhao Xu had already guessed the process of the affair with about 50% accuracy, and now he was even more certain.

The ancestor of the commander did not elaborate on the details, but simply mentioned a descriptive word - ancient.
Here is the translation:

This implies that the birth of the notebook dates back to a time when the gods did not yet exist in ancient times. Zhao Xu had a puzzled expression on his face.

As for the true nature of the notebook, he might only be able to understand it after collecting seven notebooks.

However, since he now has two notebooks in his hand, the situation has become different.

Zhao Xu immediately took out his original notebook, "Magical Notebook", from the Howard bag behind him and overlapped the two notebooks with identical appearances.

"There is a powerful energy oscillation," Lacis reminded him immediately.

As the notebooks were overlapped, the binding area suddenly merged together, as if a high-energy thread was sewing them together.

A flash of white light appeared.

The two notebooks had merged into one.

It looked just like Zhao Xu's previous "Magical Notebook", even retaining the handwritten title.

It seemed as if the notebook obtained from the spirit world had disappeared, or rather, was absorbed by this notebook in his hand.

If it were another mage, they would either suppress their curiosity, pull out the "Identification Spell" scroll, and cast it for an hour to re-examine this notebook.

Or, they would simply ignore it and flip it open to research it.

However, Zhao Xu had a better approach.

At this moment, he again used his glasses to cast the "Detection Magic".

Unlike the hour-long spellcasting time for the "Identification Spell", Zhao Xu completed the spellcasting process for "Detection Magic" in just a few seconds.

The new notebook information also fed back to his mind.

This was also one of Zhao Xu's advantages, as he could confirm his gains at any time.
Here is the translation of the text:

Even if other mages have a "magical eye protector", they may not be able to cast as many "detection spells" as he can. Zhao Xu's mastery of "precognition" and the "multitalented mage" specialty has begun to manifest its power in the details of his adventure. However, after he saw the identification results of the "spellbook notes" in his hand, he hesitated.

Even more, he was hesitant to open it. As a 3rd-level player, Zhao Xu is currently ranked first in the Arthurian player ranking. Among the next several hundred 2nd-level players, the majority of those who first promoted were warriors.

Warriors are not particularly easy to become. It's just that warriors have a seamless connection in terms of attack power, experience, and consciousness, even if they die and restart. The only thing that can suppress them is the lack of experience points.

Once they have enough experience points, they won't need any further training. Just like Zhao Xu once awakened the "master of lightweight weapons" ability in the Goddess's Sacred Heart Cathedral, he can do the same with the wooden stick in his hand.

As for warriors, they also follow this principle. Mages, although they have mastered various spells, will essentially lose all their spells if they die. Without armor and weapons, a warrior is just a weak warrior, and without a spellbook, a mage is no longer a mage.

Therefore, many mages, after being revived, will grit their teeth and patiently re-record the spells they once knew. Unless they successfully retrieve their previous spellbook, even if they have a complete spellbook in front of them, they will still have to spend their own time transcribing it again.
Here is the translation:

This is also the reason why the first-tier players of the warrior class can reach level 10 within a year, while the mage class can only reach level 5. However, for a few top-level mages like Wang Qingwei, everyone is guessing that they have exceeded level 9.

Zhao Xu once thought it was just someone blowing hot air, but now that he has met Wang Qingwei, he realizes that it's not just empty talk. However, it's because of the notebook in front of him that Zhao Xu feels this way.

The notebook is the ultimate guide for spellcasters, and reading it for one minute will upgrade the profession to the next level. The current notebook completeness is 2/7.

Larxus, who has transformed into "Suppressive Skin", is also muttering to himself: "Isn't this just the effect of a divine artifact?"

It is said that the divine artifact "Holy Book" is the ultimate guide for good-aligned spellcasters, and reading it for a week will give an inner bonus of +1 attribute and level up one level. Once finished, the "Holy Book" will disappear like "The Book of All Laws".

Larxus said, "This seems even stronger. The Holy Book is not very friendly to you spellcasters. If you fail to exempt, you will drop a level, and if you deviate from the alignment, your level increase will revert. But we can still change the book to read it again."

Zhao Xu nodded in agreement, listening to Larxus' words. The divine artifact "Holy Book" is indeed powerful, but it's a one-time deal.

As for the notebook in front of him, it doesn't mention that it will disappear after reading. And if he becomes a non-spellcaster, dropping a level is a small matter.
Here is the translation of the text:

This implies that as soon as Zhao Xu opens this book, he will become the first-ranked 4th-level player among Arthur players in just one minute. Below is a blank line, followed by the top-notch 2nd-level high-players who are currently being widely praised on the forum. The question is, will he read it or not? From 3rd to 4th level, it's a 1-level difference. From 20th to 21st level, it's also a 1-level difference. The "Spell Notebook" in front of him has already sprouted two voices in his heart.

One voice is persuading him to hurry up and read it, upgrade first, and then worry about what special situations may arise later. The other voice is telling him that even if he doesn't read it, he won't lose anything, and he can just wait for 10 months to read it. When Lakis guessed Zhao Xu's thoughts, he said, "Read it. What else can I do?"

After experiencing this period of adventurous experiences, Zhao Xu realized that his level was not well-matched with his adventurous risk-taking. In fact, most players are like this, not following a set level and killing a specific monster. Who hasn't died five times and come back again? Who hasn't played a game without loading a saved file, especially action games that cannot save immediately and have to restart from the beginning? After making up his mind, Zhao Xu picked up the "Spell Notebook" and began to flip through it slowly.

In the dimension that could not be observed, the notebook began to unravel countless threads of energy, slowly spreading them out to form a vast energy network, and then enveloped Zhao Xu like a cocoon. Just one minute later...
Zhao Xu gently closed his spellbook and turned to look around, only to find that the grand hall was eerily quiet. Apart from the sound of Luxia's breathing, waiting for his response.

Zhao Xu couldn't help but let out a sigh, for life was sometimes this desolate.

In this gray-toned and dimly lit altar hall, he had become the first 4th-level player in Arthur's world.
