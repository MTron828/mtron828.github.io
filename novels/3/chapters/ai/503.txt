Chapter 504 The clouds clear and point to the treasure

"Who are you?" A woman, trembling all over and unable to hold her weapon steady due to her shaking hands, asked. Her face, once heavily made up, was now covered in blood, making her look like a madwoman from the countryside.

But no matter how curious her thoughts were, it was of no use. After a brief exchange, she was defeated and had lost all fighting ability, her life now in the hands of the other party.

At this moment, Zhao Xu unexpectedly remained silent.

In his line of sight, from the beginning of the massacre, the dynamic column continuously prompted him with "Awakening of the Reaper's Divine Fragment."

This time, with each killing, he could clearly feel the surge of life energy.

Each swing of his bat was a tribute to life.

Until just now, after some effort, he knocked down the fourth sister of the six sisters with his bat.

After the 13th level wanderer died, he directly ascended to the 8th level.

Even at the moment of leveling up, the silhouette of the Reaper's will appeared faintly behind him.

"Lux, what's going on?" Zhao Xu couldn't help but call out to the semi-silent state of the artifact's will.

"Well, master, what kind of explanation do you want to hear?" Lux whispered.

"A fair, objective, and rigorous explanation," Zhao Xu immediately closed the loophole.

"Well, you've absorbed too much energy from killing during this time," Lux explained, "You've been killing non-stop, and it's caused an overflow of energy."

"No, that's not it," Zhao Xu pointed out immediately, "I only leveled up after coming out of the Palace of Aizhu and killing a lot of people. How many days has it been?"
"If the real killing can be upgraded quickly, then there would have been an average of level 5 warriors on the battlefield."

"Well," Laxi also had a headache, understanding that Zhao Xu in front of her was no longer as easily fooled as before.

"The main reason is that you are a player, naturally easy to absorb these life energies, otherwise you players wouldn't level up so quickly. On the other hand, you also have the fragments of the death god's divine grid. It used to be one mouth here, now it's two mouths, the efficiency is definitely different."

Hearing Laxi's words, Zhao Xu also realized that something was wrong, "So you mean the aftereffects are not small?"

"Hey hey, master, how can you say that? If there were truly irreversible aftereffects, countless people would be shouting to give me a level 100, wouldn't they?" Laxi was not pleased.

"Heh," Zhao Xu said unkindly, "Don't think I don't know it's your doing."

"Hehe, okay," Laxi's voice lowered, "Miss Antinoya gave you a 'Staff of the Domain of Decay' before, so you could manage until level 8."

"As a result, you put on this death spell and your strength increased dramatically, combined with the divine grid fragments, and with me also reducing some of the consumption, so you immediately broke through."

"I guess this is also Miss Antinoya's intention, otherwise giving you a staff in advance to enjoy the fourth ring magic of the next level, what's the point of that? It's just to let you awaken the will of the death god's divine grid fragments through killing every day when you cast spells."

Zhao Xu suddenly realized.

Why did Antinoya give him a staff with 50 energy, and confidently said he could only use two energy per day, limiting him to reach level 8 within 25 days.

"Tell me earlier next time," Zhao Xu reminded.

But Laxi shook her head, "Master, it's not the same."
"Death is the inherent law of this world, just like the cycle of the four seasons, it repeats itself."
"Their essence is to return to the earth, not the deliberate result of creation."
"If simple death is useful, Miss Antinoya, why not kill all the mutant spiders in your dimensional bag and ascend to legend in the same place?"
Faced with these words, Zhao Xu also sighed.
"It looks like I need to hurry back to Fallen Star Town."
From reaching level 6 and leaving Mysterla, his foundation was not very solid, all the way fighting monsters and killing people, the whole process never stopped.
"Yes, Master, quickly settle your romantic debts, go back and hide for a while, choose the new advancement for the level 9 mage, then read your notebook, and you will smoothly reach level 9."
"All the troubles in this world, you should also put an end to them."
"Where did I get these romantic debts?" Zhao Xu complained, "I just did the right thing, where did I go wrong?"
"Yes, yes, but we spellcasters should strive to improve production and strengthen logistics."
Zhao Xu silently nodded, agreeing with Laxi's words.
His gaze also returned to the woman in front of him, who was the fifth sister among the six sisters.
"Where are the captured Frey and Lady Ely imprisoned?" Zhao Xu politely asked.
"Then you've come to the wrong place."
Although Mata in front of him was defeated by Zhao Xu in one blow, she still stubbornly said.
"Don't be silly," Zhao Xu laughed, "If your eldest sister wasn't a high-level mage, and if this place wasn't the altar of the deity worshiped by your second sister who is a priest, do you think the Alliance wouldn't be able to locate it?"
"Or is it that you really took them to exchange out of the goodness of your hearts?"
The wizards have a powerful positioning technique called "biological positioning" and "perception of location". In fact, the Nash magician who knows Flora and Lady Ellie can quickly locate the two of them. However, where there is a sword, there is a shield. Arthur also has a targeted method. Those who want to kidnap the wealthy for a big deal, if they are not prepared to shield their detection and positioning methods, they are just asking for trouble. The existence of various kidnappings and trafficking in the world of Arthur is because ordinary families simply cannot afford the hundreds or thousands of gold coins in spell fees. Especially when the wizard does not know the target location, the conditions needed are even more stringent. Zhao Xu's words are simple, either the other party brings the two of them, or they will be kept here. Because only here is protected by magic and even divine power, it will not be detected and located. "Well, then you can go and look for them," Marta looked around. Her older sister, second sister, and third sister had already left for the large-scale kidnapping targeting the alliance. The wandering fourth sister who stayed in the main base died not far from her, and the sixth sister was the first to encounter the other party and is now missing. The surrounding subordinates, these strong and loyal core members who have followed them for many years, have all been killed or injured, not even a single lament was able to be uttered alive. Her only hope is that her three sisters can sense that something is wrong here and come back immediately. "So you think they're here, go ahead and search. There are indeed the slaves we captured below, but you can see if Flora and Ellie are here." Marta couldn't help but laugh mockingly at the man in front of her, as if mocking him for his futile efforts.
"You could have made a deal with us, exchanging their location for the location of our headquarters. But now it's too late," said Marta, looking at Zhao Xu with a fierce gaze. "They must be very important to you. When my sisters return, we will go punish those two prostitutes in the secret place."

"They are unharmed now, but because of your actions, they will not want to live again," she continued. "Wait and see, a month from now, you may see them in the lowest brothel, disfigured and maimed."

Marta looked at Zhao Xu with a triumphant expression, expecting to see him in pain and worry. But Zhao Xu remained calm, as if the threat was just about plants and flowers.

There was another hiding place. Or rather, the treasure trove of the six sisters.

Suddenly, a possibility flashed through Zhao Xu's mind. He scornfully said, "I don't believe you would dare to disgrace the alliance like this."

Kidnapping was one thing, but causing disability was another.

As he spoke, Zhao Xu activated his skill of "concealing magic" and his "silencing" ring to hide his voice. To Marta, it looked like he just adjusted the position of the badge on his chest. But in reality, Zhao Xu had completed the third circle of the holy warrior and the fourth circle of the priest's spell "detect lies."

With his focused attention on Marta, who sat lifelessly on the sandy ground, Zhao Xu gained the ability to discern whether she was lying. Marta knew that her life was as fragile as a candle in the wind, ready to be extinguished at any moment.
Here is the translation of the text:

She, struggling to breathe, looked at the executioner before her with intense hatred, and suddenly burst out: "Stop pretending to be stupid! Tang De dared to send you here, and you're acting like a silly lamb that doesn't know anything?"

"It was Tang De who tore up the promise and took the first step!"

【Verification: Not a lie】

As she spoke, Zhao Xu did not show any sign of confusion, but instead smiled slightly, exuding an air of confidence, just like a trusted aide of Tang De.

The "detection of deception" spell would not reveal the truth or expose unintentional mistakes or forced excuses. As long as Mata believed she had not lied, the spell would not reveal anything.

At this moment, Zhao Xu stood on the blood-soaked yellow earth, looking at Mata, who was being tortured and humiliated because she was not very intelligent. He bent down and said, "So what's the big deal? He's just a dog under Tang De's command."

"Don't insult my father!" Mata shouted suddenly.

Her teeth were almost clenched, and if she hadn't been injured by Zhao Xu, she would have crawled up to bite him.

【Verification: Not a lie】

The dynamic meter remained cold, feeding the result of the spell to Zhao Xu.

However, Zhao Xu just stood there, staring blankly.

It turned out that before his death, Kuroze told him about the "treasure" hidden underground in the city, which was actually a "treasure" hidden by the six sisters themselves.

Their father-daughter relationship made all this irrelevant.

The goddess of commerce in the city could store wealth.

Kuroze also wanted to hide his wealth by putting it in his pants, and naturally, there were "unknown sources of wealth" and many "magical items" that needed to be secretly stored.

Even the six sisters, who occasionally sat guard, could take revenge on Zhao Xu if they encountered him.
Here is the translation of the text:

Many things are connected and make sense after being strung together by a single thread. Why did the six sisters kidnap Tang De's wife and daughter? It's because they wanted to warn him and get a response from him using their abilities. Because of Kuluoze's ability in the city of Ou Lu, many suspicious individuals were eliminated, and only Tang De could achieve a flawless "seamless" plan. This made the sisters suspect that Tang De was behind the scenes. If Tang De's explanation could prove he wasn't involved, the sisters would be satisfied. At that time, Zhao Xu couldn't help but shake his head, feeling a bit immature. Before Zhao Xu emerged from the shadows, the entire city of Ou Lu was in a state of panic, where anyone could have killed the "Kuluoze" target. After Zhao Xu jumped out at the banquet, no one had time to think about the events of that night yet. However, Tang De, who controlled all the intelligence in the city, was very clear that this was the work of an outsider. Naturally, the new Zhao Xu was the most suspicious. That's why Tang De arranged for him to escort the exchange hostages to the destination agreed upon by the six sisters. In essence, Tang De was letting Zhao Xu "enter the wolf's den", allowing the older sisters to verify whether he was the true culprit using their abilities, blood ties, or divine blessings. As a leader, he wasn't afraid of him not being involved. Once he was proven innocent, a player who could take down four directions without relying on divine artifacts would be worthy of the title "leader". Thinking it through, Zhao Xu walked in front of the fourth sister, a master of stealth assassination who had encountered the greatest threats after entering the cave.
Here is the translation of the text:

It's just a magical dagger, but it's not enough to tear apart Zhao Xu's "Star-Cloth Cloak" which has a 100% damage resistance ability.

Before the ability of Zhao Xu's cloak is released, anyone who tries to assassinate him up close will suffer a bloody lesson.

"Dead man talking."
Zhao Xu quietly extends his finger to touch the opponent's forehead and casts this spell.

It's just a natural instinct, and the soul has no influence, even if it's not present.

"Haha, naive, don't you think we haven't considered the consequences of being caught? Why does our headquarters still exist for so long? Do you think it's a blessing from heaven?"

Mata does not miss this opportunity to mock Zhao Xu.

"Yes, interesting."

Zhao Xu nods slightly.

Just then, his spell makes a corpse temporarily regain a little life and intelligence, making it possible to talk.

However, the four sisters right in front of him suddenly break out in a rash of corpse-like lesions, and their bodies undergo a rapid transformation.

"A group of wretched people."

Zhao Xu shakes his head, "She died the moment she was transformed into an undead zombie, obviously arranged by your sister, so that you won't leak any information even after death. She's pretty resourceful."

"Not wrong, so don't expect me to give you any information. I'm just waiting for this moment to make you despair, haha..."

As Mata speaks, he spits out black blood, already crushing the toxic capsule hidden in his teeth, and commits suicide on the spot.

"I know where your treasure is hidden, isn't it at the bottom of the Snowfall Valley on Black Blood Peak?"

Zhao Xu suddenly says.

Mata, who is almost unconscious, suddenly opens his eyes wide and kicks his legs hard, as if he wants to get up.

"Why do I know?"

"It's simple, I killed Kurlose."

(Note: I've translated the text as accurately as possible, but please note that the translation may not be perfect due to the nuances of the original text and the complexity of the language used.)
Here is the translation of the text:

"Tonk." Mata's legs lost their strength as she heard the last sentence, her eyes wide with terror, staring at the crumbling stones above, her face contorted in disbelief.

Zhao Xu rubbed his head, seemingly thinking that killing someone was a bit too ruthless.

However, they would send a notification to the Sacred Guardian Knights to rescue the hostages, and that would be it.

As for him, he would head to his own treasure-hunting site.

The six sisters and Kolozar, who had been operating the treasure trove for years, were waiting for him.
