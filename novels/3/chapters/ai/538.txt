Chapter 539: Divine Favor

As the oil slick player's remark was heard, the escort player standing beside him was left speechless.

After all, these top players had risen from level 5 to level 7 over the past two months, with level 8 just within reach.

The halo was slowly fading away.

As the guide, a poet, introduced the scenic spot, these spring outing group members finally realized their summer presence in the lake.

Suddenly, a chorus of gasps and regrets echoed through the air.

"It's true, the biggest killer is indeed the traffic."

"Yes, after being exposed, the East City's school poster was released, and it's been one day since the last one."

"Don't be sentimental, if you had a beautiful sister by your side, you'd be happy to row the boat on the lake."

As the guide, the poet, waved his hands and caught everyone's attention, "Look, everyone, right in front of you is 'Star Lake'!"

"It has been formed for centuries, and we are almost certain that this is similar to the 'Elder's Mansion' incident that occurred in the northern alliance a few months ago. After a meteorite fell, a massive crater formed here, which eventually became a lake."

As the poet continued to narrate, occasionally slapping his thigh with his hand and chanting the melody of the Arthurian folk song, the audience gradually gained applause.

The attention of this observation group slowly shifted back to the scenery before them.
Here is the translation of the text:

It's said that the mysterious silver meteorite that fell initially melted into the vast underground mine behind it, blending with the earth's surface and forming the present-day Starfall Mining District. Every month, more than 100,000 gold coins of pure silver can be extracted.

The poet said with a smile, his eyes sparkling with excitement.

The group of people fought to the death to escort the gold coins, all for a paltry sum of over a thousand gold coins.

Where could these mine owners, who are like carrying printing machines, compare to them?

As the poet began to introduce the history of Starfall, even the most outrageous stories couldn't erase the part played by the man from the lake.

The crowd's attention was once again drawn back to Zhao Xu.

At this point, the poet player couldn't help but joke, "As the saying goes, a thin camel is bigger than a horse. You don't have to feel that the Starfall Lord has lost his former glory."

"It's not that others can't say it, but in Starfall, he is truly the one who holds the power of the nine cauldrons. In a brutal sense, as long as he raises his finger, our team will have to retreat."

"So, you see, those guards in full armor, standing by the lake, are authorized to judge our danger and drive us away."

"So, don't bother us, tourists," the poet player said, looking at the few punk players nearby.

After feeling the weight of the crowd's gaze, the few male players who had started blowing whistles couldn't help but wave their hands and say, "Alright, we get it, you didn't remind us at the beginning."

But after they showed weakness, they couldn't help but mutter to themselves.

"This is quite a grand scene, even the richest wouldn't dare to, it's really a feudal society."

"Cut it out, it's just a game, why be so serious?"

"I would have leveled up if I didn't have other commitments, otherwise, I would have gone all out."
Here is the translation of the text into English:

The players of the observation team naturally heard the self-boasting words of the man with their left ear and responded with their right ear. There are always players who feel good about themselves in the world. If they meet someone who is guarding outside, they will definitely counterattack with a sentence like "How high is the income from this game?" Those who are blowing their own horns will definitely not be able to quickly rush into the front row, so why not take the money that has fallen from the sky?

However, as a customer, they naturally maintained a smile in silence.

"Hey, look, look, the light is shining in the center of the lake." Suddenly, a little girl in the observation team jumped up excitedly.

In the next moment, the entire team erupted in a chorus of "Wow, wow, wow!" at the same time.

At this moment, the warrior who was squatting by the lake, washing his face with water, was about to complain that the observation team was strange and few, but just a moment ago, they had also explored the nearby screaming scenic spot with them.

However, when he looked up, his eyes were equally wide open.

Because, the pillar of light was just too big.

At this moment, Zhao Xu, who was standing on the boat in the lake, suddenly realized that he had been pacing back and forth in front of the 9th gate, almost stepping on the soil.

How could he have expected that he would suddenly take half a step forward?

He had not even finished reading his "notes" yet!

In this moment, Zhao Xu's entire body seemed to be bathed in divine light, and the lake water also transformed into a seven-colored jade mirror.

The light poured down from afar, like a giant, unstoppable stream, waving this lake like a giant, unstoppable brush.

In the eyes of the people without a giant wheel face, Zhao Xu seemed to have connected the human world and the heavenly world with this pillar of light, constantly receiving blessings from above.
The stars on Zhao Xu's cloak began to shine, as if the stars in the sky were falling constantly, cutting through the void. Even the sound of heavenly music began to emerge from the air near Zhao Xu's ear, with the chanting of the choir gradually spreading across the lake.

The fishermen who had been fishing on the shore suddenly fell to their knees, even though they didn't know who the true god was. The local bodyguards who were assigned to protect Zhao Xu, despite their duties, also knelt down, tears welling up in their eyes.

The followers of the goddess of faith prayed constantly, invoking the name of the goddess Sylvana, who was the proxy of the divine. The bell tower of the church in the northern district, which overlooked the entire town, suddenly struck the bell with a loud and majestic sound.

The clock hammer was lifted by an invisible hand and fell heavily onto the bell, producing a low and resonant tone. The priests in the church, from the archbishop to the lower-ranking clergy, all gazed blankly upwards, unsure of what was happening and whether it was a divine revelation.

The only thing they could do was pray, asking for the goddess's forgiveness and guidance. In the Sacred Heart Cathedral of the Magic Goddess Church headquarters, the sound of the bell echoed back and forth, like a rainstorm pounding against the shore.

This sudden change left the devout priests with no choice but to kneel down and recite the goddess's name repeatedly, trying to feel the goddess's will. The pilgrims who had come to worship also fell to their knees, just like a small boat drifting on the vast ocean, too afraid to face the mighty will of the world.

As for the people gathered in front of the Falling Star Lake, they were completely at a loss, unsure of what was happening before their eyes.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Hey, Laya, how could you kneel down in front of the lake's center?" Suddenly, the escort team of the sightseeing group discovered that their most reliable shield, Miss Pastor, was also kneeling down by the lake's edge, reciting prayers nonstop.

"This game is really getting that intense, right?" Even the originally smooth-talking man was having a hard time believing it.

The pastor, with a beautiful face, had been teasing him nonstop on their journey, but he had never gotten a chance. Now, why was he kneeling down in the same spot as the man by the lake's center? Although this was just a game, the players were so immersed in their roles that they could even console themselves by pretending to be gods. But how could the same player, who was now kneeling down, do the same thing?

As the pastor looked on, it was as if the player who had been playing the role of King Arthur could come over and scold her next. Meanwhile, Zhao Xu was quietly bowing his head, nodding at the descending magic goddess Sylvia, saying, "Goddess, your gaze is our direction forward."

Zheng Xin Yu's mouth was agape, her pink lips unable to form a single word, and she could only stare in wonder at the divine being before her. If it weren't for the mysterious faith on Earth, she would have probably become a pastor of the magic goddess as well, which was also the reason for their connection.

But no matter how Zheng Xin Yu guessed, she would never have thought that she would get to know a divine being up close like this?

"Don't get too excited, sister," Sylvia said, stroking Zheng Xin Yu's hair with a gentle touch, expressing regret, "Good Pastor, you're always the one who takes the initiative, which is really a pity."

(Note: I've translated the text as accurately and precisely as possible, without any embellishments or creative liberties.
Here is the translation of the text:

"I'm not good enough, Goddess." Even though Zheng Xin An, who had been incredibly confident, felt embarrassed and turned red in the face after realizing that the divine spirits of Arthur were real. "How can this be? You're so lovely, Sister Pastor. Why don't you join my church and let you take care of the entire northern diocese?"

Hearing this, Zhao Xu almost couldn't help but burst out laughing.

As a bishop who has mastered a local church, he is already at the level of a high-ranking bishop. Further up, he is the bishop of the northern diocese, responsible for overseeing all the female goddess churches in the northern region. This is the second level, and only those who have reached this level can enter the papal reserve list.

The Goddess's current words are equivalent to making Zheng Xin An take a step up to become a high-ranking bishop.

"Can I also promote you to a 15th-level bishop?" Magic Goddess Sylvia placed a heavy weight on the scale.

At this moment, Zhao Xu almost wanted to say, "Goddess, I'm willing."

This is a one-step promotion to become a high-ranking bishop.

The 15th-level bishop has reached the lowest standard and will no longer have issues with mismatched positions.

Even Zhao Xu could teach Zheng Xin An the path of leveling up to a high-ranking bishop, and Zheng Xin An could directly start speaking the sacred language, which could be said to be without solution.

"Sorry, Goddess, I'm satisfied with what I have now." Zheng Xin An shook his head and said.

Facing Zheng Xin An's response, Zhao Xu couldn't help but smile.

Some devilish pastors would definitely become a former pastor if they gave such a response.

Even Zheng Xin An didn't consider avoiding angering the Goddess.

As expected, he got what he deserved.

"That's it?" The Magic Goddess turned to Zhao Xu. "How about your 9th-level wind and light? Do you want to level up again?"
