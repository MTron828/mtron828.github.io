Chapter 096: The Itre Kingdom

Zhao Xu was originally about to ask a question, but his mind was completely captivated by the mysterious term. The earth's forces had been idle for several years, and in the end, they finally managed to gather all the forces and find the legendary lost treasure of the Itre Kingdom, which was said to contain extremely abundant resources. With the treasure, they were able to equip a strong army and gain a foothold in the subsequent demon war.

At that time, Zhao Xu only heard the rumors from those around him and followed the crowd, not knowing the location of the Itre Kingdom's treasure. He didn't even think about digging it up.

This was also the reason he hadn't thought much about the kingdom's treasure. However, his level was high enough, and he would naturally be able to intervene later.

But now, a new secret from the Öfarian King Ernest had emerged. Zhao Xu suddenly remembered that the Itre Kingdom was somehow related to the Öfarian Empire of ancient times. He asked, "What is the relationship between Öfarian King Ernest and the Itre Kingdom?"

Upon hearing this, the wizard Lyen looked at him with an expression that seemed to say, "What a coincidence? You must have read about it when you were studying 'Nobility and Royal Families'? Even if you have level 4 knowledge in 'Nobility and Royal Families', you wouldn't be able to retrieve this information. Is it possible that something is destined to happen?"

After a moment, Zhao Xu's expression remained calm and unchanged. The wizard Lyen knew he couldn't read minds and couldn't detect any secrets, so he continued to explain.
Here is the translation of the text:

"This involves a very secret big secret, you don't want to cause trouble and go back, the descendants of the Itel Empire are not small in the headquarters of the Mage Association. They are very secretive about this part of history and don't want to mention it."

Looking at Zhao Xu, who had already concentrated his mind, the mage Lyen continued to say, "The founder of the Itel Empire is said to be the descendant of Ernest. As for when Ernest had descendants, who his wife was, you don't have to ask me, and I also want to ask."

"Ernest basically predicted the collapse of the entire Ophel Empire and the collapse of the entire magical civilization after his death. So he divided the national treasury of the Ophel Empire into two parts - a true treasure and a false treasure. A thousand years later, the founder of the Itel Empire got hold of that false treasure and successfully established the empire. It's called fake because the treasure inside is only one-twentieth of the true treasure. But it was enough for the Itel Empire to establish a thousand-year empire."

"As for what I've dug up this time, it's pointing to that true treasure." Lyen the mage smiled smugly, raising an eyebrow as if to say, "You see how great I am."

After listening to the long speech, Zhao Xu finally understood that the Itel Empire was established by relying on Ernest's fake treasure, and even the remaining treasure became the legendary heritage of the empire. Thinking about this, how powerful was Ernest's true treasure compared to the fake treasure? Compared to the fake treasure, Ernest's true treasure, which consumed only one-twentieth of the fake treasure, would probably leave less than one-quarter of the remaining treasure after a thousand years, and it could still support the entire Earth's force!"

"What have you discovered, Master Raven?" Zhao Xu asked, his eyes gleaming with curiosity. The inner workings of the matter were too complex for him to comprehend, and he didn't even want to get involved, but ultimately, he had some connection with the Itel Kingdom, and it was related to the future. He decided to ask the question anyway.

"This is why I was looking at you strangely just now," Master Raven replied. "I discovered that the Itel Kingdom obtained a fake treasure with a key that points to the true treasure, so whoever gets the Itel Kingdom's lost heritage might be able to find the real treasure of Ernest."

Zhao Xu's mind was suddenly filled with turbulence.

It was no wonder that the Earth Force had been hiding the Itel Kingdom's heritage all along, only to find out that it was actually leading to a much greater treasure!

Even as an Earthling, Zhao Xu couldn't help but wonder what kind of power or ability would allow them to touch such things.

If Ernest was able to live until now, he might even be the Magic God of the present.

Let alone the fact that Ernest, who was not a divine being, had once possessed the power to cause the ancient gods to fall.

This forbidden history came from the book that Anzinoja had read to him.

"Isn't it thrilling to hear this inside information?" Master Raven smiled confidently. "I've finally done justice to the energy of my staff."

"However, Master Raven, you've spent years digging up this information, but it's still not useful," Zhao Xu thought to himself, drawing out his words.

He suspected that Master Raven was definitely aware of the news about the Itel Kingdom's heritage.

Master Raven scoffed upon hearing this, "Well, I've also spent a lot of effort cultivating my core, although I'm not at your level of cultivation. However, I've also obtained enough inside information. But before I share the inside information, I want to ask you one thing: who is your mentor?"

"Ah Ni Ya!" Li Yao looked at the other person, who was clearly aware of the question. Zhao Xu replied simply, "Although you have two items made by Ah Ni Ya on you, I still need to continue examining the evidence."

"That's it," Zhao Xu said, pulling out the bishop's badge given to him by the Pope and placing it in the palm of his hand.

When Li Yao saw the badge filled with sacred energy, he was taken aback, wondering if it was an illusion. He felt that this badge was more radiant than the ones he had seen before.

What a sly kid!

Li Yao thought to himself that he mainly wanted Zhao Xu to pull out some of his specialties to show off. He had already guessed that the kid in front of him had used the abilities of a multitalented mage, but he couldn't use his own abilities freely.

However, just having this badge was enough to confirm that the kid in front of him had many talents. If he could pull out some secrets like "Temporary Magic Formula," "Unusual Aimed Magic," and "Precognition," he would be laughing all the way.

Unfortunately, the badge of the Pope's magic was enough to prove everything. Even if he hid, he wouldn't dare to question the Pope's reputation.

Li Yao could only sigh in regret, not having asked about the specialties, and instead lost some secrets. However, the person in front of him had already given him the feeling that the thing he was pursuing might have hope. He didn't hesitate to continue, saying, "The secret of Itzel's lost inheritance is in the hands of the descendants of Itzel in Floating City."

Floating City!
King Qian Wei!
Zhao Xu realized that he had already figured out the reason why the Earth's forces obtained Itzel's lost inheritance.

It was the headquarters of the Mage Association that told King Qian Wei about the secret of Itzel's lost inheritance!
Here is the translation of the text:

Apart from the charisma brought by his specialization in "leadership", the last legacy of the Itier dynasty is the reason why Wang Qingwei can balance the entire global power.

"Moreover, I'm almost certain that the giants of the Mage Association know the true clue, hidden within the fake one."
"That's why they don't go dig it up?" Zhao Xu asked.
"No one is foolish, you think about the Itier dynasty holding the key, and they couldn't find the true clue in a thousand years, so there must be a reason, otherwise the dynasty would have fallen."
"I guess digging it up requires a certain timing," said the Mage Lyin, gazing deeply at Zhao Xu.
