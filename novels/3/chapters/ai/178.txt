Chapter 179: The Magical Notes of Midsummer

After hearing Zhao Xu's request, Andy, the tall and thin man, suddenly woke up like he was emerging from a dream. He hastily searched for something on the ground, but due to his nervousness, he ended up grasping at air.

"Just let me do it," Zhao Xu saw Andy, the man, looking so nervous and decided to take matters into his own hands. He effortlessly displayed his "Hand of the Magician" and had the black leather-bound book fly into his hands.

At this moment, the few young men and women were silently watching this scene. Even though they lived in Mistral, every time they saw these magical arts, they couldn't help but recall the disappointed eyes of their parents when they discovered they were not destined to become magicians or priests.

Zhao Xu controlled the book and held it tightly in his hand, but instead of opening it hastily, he gazed at Andy with questioning eyes, as if waiting for him to provide more information.

It was as if the legendary library had a book of magic, known as the "Unknown Origin Scroll." As long as the party was compatible, reading it would grant a +5 bonus to knowledge checks.

The more time passed, the more one could gain corresponding enhancements. However, reading the scroll was also an adventure. Every hour, one might suffer from backlash from the scroll, with consequences ranging from mental derangement to being cursed or even becoming a ghost.

Therefore, Zhao Xu would not rush to open the mysterious book.
Here is the translation of the text:

Andy looked at Zhao Xu's eyes, which shone brightly, and thought about the other person's intimidating identity, and his heart skipped a beat. He quickly explained: "This book is a rare book, and I don't know its name. I found it among my family's treasures. I only know that my ancestors obtained it from a mysterious tomb a long time ago. After they returned, they were seriously injured and died soon, so the book was sealed away."

"What special effects does it have?" Zhao Xu asked again.

The ancient tomb's mysterious book recorded these primitive rituals, which sounded plausible.

At this moment, Andy sat up and began to recall: "My ancestors took it to get it appraised by the wizards, and it turned out to be a magical item. As for its effects..."

Andy's face turned pale, and he gazed at the book with a frightened expression: "It's said to have vitality."

Zhao Xu's heart skipped a beat, "Do you mean that the ritual we just summoned is something you copied down yourself?"

Andy nodded, his face growing even paler: "That ritual is one we saw at a mysterious shop on Mistral Central Street that sells ancient relics. I copied it down out of curiosity. After Lisa's accident, I wanted to actually perform this ritual, so I went back to the shop, but the stone tablet had already been bought by the wizards."

"The first requirement of the ritual is to make the copied ritual text have vitality. I also thought of this point, so I dug out this book from my family's treasures."

Zhao Xu listened to Andy's description and basically understood the logic.

As for the vitality, he also roughly understood what it meant. They copied spells, requiring the text to have vitality, which meant using special ink and quill pens designed for copying spells, and combining them with arcane letters.

He didn't expect that the book in his hand had the same effect, which was no different from another kind of "blessing book".
Here is the translation of the text:

Can't we just copy the materials instead of using magic?

This book looks like it's not going to hold up to copying, a single level 9 spell takes up nine pages, which is much lower than the legendary 1000-page "Blessing Book". It's no different from ordinary 100-page spellbooks, except that we saved on materials.

However, Zhao Xu has also made up his mind to copy some core spells from the association's open purchase and learning, and then sell the copied book.

Zhao Xu suddenly took out the "Machina Guardian's Mirror" that Anzhi gave him earlier and used the "Detective Magic" spell to cast it on the book.

Suddenly, the light of the detective magic passed through the mirror's transformation, and the spell's energy merged with the book's interior.

【Adventurer Zhongxia cast "Detective Magic" through the "Machina Guardian's Mirror" to obtain the "Identification" effect】

With a swipe, the book's effects directly displayed in front of his eyes.

Zhao Xu carefully read through the past, but couldn't help but be taken aback.

He thought to himself, "Identification is unlikely to have an upgrade, or maybe the identification itself has a certain failure rate?"

However, he suppressed his internal doubts and directly opened this book. Most of the book's pages were filled with various content.

The front part had some simple notes from the man who brought this book out from the mysterious tomb, estimated to be the content that made this book not become a sacrificial item but rather a handwritten manuscript saved by his ancestors.

The back part mostly consisted of scattered notes from the men's ancestral family, including some of their own poetry and ritual magic arrays, which Zhao Xu found were all nonsense.
Here is the translation of the text:

As Zhao Xu flipped through the ancient tome, he came to the last page with writing, and to his surprise, it was filled with a series of ritual layouts, various preparations for the ritual, and corresponding incantations.

Zhao Xu couldn't help but glance at Andy, who had managed to memorize all of this, wondering how many times he had visited that store.

The five people kneeling on the ground dared not make a sound, waiting for Zhao Xu to finish checking the ancient tome. They were nervous, fearing that Zhao Xu would discover that they were hiding a forbidden book, which would lead to further consequences, even affecting their families.

Andy, who had just explained the situation to Zhao Xu, looked even paler than the other four, who had just gone through a life-or-death crisis.

After Zhao Xu briefly scanned the book, he determined that it was a common ancient summoning ritual, randomly summoning creatures from another dimension.

However, this group of young people had unfortunately attracted an evil creature from another dimension, which wasn't a big problem.

Zhao Xu estimated that he could find the corresponding ritual in the library after returning to the Secret Library.

Initially, Zhao Xu had been about to sigh in frustration, feeling that this operation had yielded no results, but he had to do what was right.

However, just as he had finished examining the book, Zhao Xu's expression changed, and he spoke in a low voice to Andy, "So, what do you plan to do with this book?"

Andy, who had just heard Zhao Xu's words, looked shocked, as if he had been startled, and almost jumped up, shaking his head and saying, "I don't want this book, I plan to burn it in the fire pit later."

"This book feels like it's hiding some secrets," Zhao Xu nodded, saying, "Then let me handle it for you?"
After hearing Zhao Xu's words, the five people who had undergone a transformation all nodded hastily, indicating that they would follow Zhao Xu's arrangements.

At this point, Zhao Xu didn't want to talk to these group of young people anymore, so he handed them a task: after they left, they should go to the Goddess's Church to pray and purify themselves, and then they could leave.

The five people looked at Zhao Xu as if they were looking at a demon, and they quickly ran away with a "poop-your-pants" expression. Zhao Xu quickly said, "Take this bag too, and when you get back, make sure to properly bury it."

Only two of the stronger men returned to drag away the dead goat.

It wasn't until the five people disappeared from view that Zhao Xu lightly tapped the surface of the "Invisible Ring" on his finger. Suddenly, his entire person, including the book he was holding, disappeared.

Zhao Xu directly left the bonfire and walked to the location of the nearby tombstones, sitting down with a sense of relief.

He definitely didn't have the guts to do something like this on Earth.

But since he had the Sacred Badge on him, he was no longer afraid of the creatures from the underworld.

If it was actually the evil spirits that were buried underground, and the ones that were brought out were level 9 "Soulless Corpses", he would still have to be careful and avoid trouble.

Two fireballs wouldn't be enough to kill such undead creatures with 90 HP.

After doing a good deed, Zhao Xu felt a sense of satisfaction and began to flip through the book in his hand, which was his reward this time.

When he appraised it just now, he suddenly discovered that the book had an unexpected effect: it didn't just have 100 pages.

Strictly speaking, it had an infinite number of pages.
Here is the translation of the text:

This book, which has countless pages, is something Zhao Xu has seen many times. Many magical tomes have this effect. In itself, it resembles a search engine, only revealing relevant content when the key words are entered. It's unknown what Andy's ancestor found or identified, as he missed this important effect.

This book with infinite pages is undoubtedly worth a lot of money.

In the past, a mage once used a book with infinite pages as a magic tome, but this caused interference between spells, making it impossible to identify. The most famous one is the "Ancient Knowledge Scroll" created by the second-generation Magic Goddess, which is said to allow the mage who obtains it to prepare a spell they have never mastered every day. However, this book is now missing.

Even the Magic Goddess failed, and no one has tried to use a book with infinite pages as a magic tome since.

Zhao Xu is now closing the book lightly and adding a title to the cover: "Midsummer's Magic Notes".

Suddenly, the black book cover, which had been ordinary, bursts into a kaleidoscope of colors.
