Chapter 337: The Snare

After Ling'er exclaimed, the new players might still be confused. However, the original pastor, Blanch, and Matthew, including the two six-ringed wizards who had just joined forces to kill the demon, all intensely gazed at Zhao Xu's "Legendary Death Spirit Staff" in his hand.

Their eyes then shifted to Zhao Xu's face, as if trying to analyze something.

The staff itself had a death spirit style, composed of finger bones connected together, which would evoke a sense of trepidation at midnight.

Normally, Zhao Xu wouldn't need to or want to keep it beside his pillow, and he would usually carry it in his backpack. Only when going on adventures would he strap it to his waist.

If this staff had no magical properties, the goddess's pastor would think it was an evil artifact and destroy it, and most goddess pastors wouldn't carry such an evil-looking staff.

At this moment, they were not only surprised by the staff's unusual appearance but also the price and loss it entailed.

As for Zhao Xu's identity, speculation was rife, and even the powerful descendants of the wizarding association would deem such resources extravagant.

According to a secret adventurer's strategy manual, based on the oral and written records of countless adventurers over the centuries, the average reward for defeating a 20-level monster was around 80,000 gold coins.

What kind of wealth would it take to purchase this staff, which had been obtained after killing countless "Deep Dungeon Demons"?
Here is the translation of the text:

"It's not like we've never seen a player with no experience in the game, but how come these high-level priests and mages look so surprised? Is it really that outrageous that a million gold coins is the ceiling for magic equipment in this world?"

"I don't know, I've never heard of an equipment that can go up to a million gold coins. Twenty thousand gold coins is already extravagant enough."

After listening to the analysis of a few observation-skilled players, a player sitting in the center, who had just switched from a paladin to a mage, wearing an initial blue linen shirt, sighed: "A million gold coins is actually not expensive, even many magic equipment are passed down as family heirlooms."

For Arthur, thousands of gold coins' "full armor" is equivalent to a "house" on Earth, while fifty to several hundred gold coins' giant sword or refined sword is equivalent to a "car". In general, most ordinary people can fight as well as a professional warrior with basic equipment.

As for the "magic items" that significantly increase durability and power, they are extremely valuable "family heirlooms" even for Arthur. Normal families can only pass down weapons and armor.

So, after the whole nation crosses over, giving someone a magic equipment, even if it's just a few thousand gold coins, is an extremely valuable gift.

"If I had this staff, I'd be so cool, almost legendary, a demon, saying 'go away' and actually making them go away, or killing them if they don't leave," a novice mage player exclaimed when he saw Zhao Xu's staff, even though its shape was somewhat unusual, he was thrilled.

If they sell such equipment to rich players, it would really be worth millions of gold coins."
Here is the translation:

"No, you can't afford it," the initial pastor of the linen robe said, rejecting. "Even if it's just several million gold coins, those pastors would be astonished for a while, but they wouldn't stay that long. They still have this kind of mentality."

The surrounding novice pastors immediately shifted their gaze towards this player, including Zheng Xin-yuan, who wasn't too interested in gossip, but couldn't help but lean in to listen.

"Because, the staff only has 50 shots left. Except for a few staffs that are still in good condition, most staffs have exhausted their energy and are basically no different from burning firewood."

"That is, no matter how you calculate it, even at the lowest price of 100 million gold coins, 50 shots of energy means an average of 2 million gold coins per shot. If it's one that consumes two shots of energy at a time, then using a single spell would cost 4 million gold coins. Are you willing to spend 4 million gold coins on a single piece of equipment?"

As the pastor of the linen robe finished speaking, the players around him had fallen silent, and even dared not look at the staff in Zhao Xu's hand.

That kind of thing, every time it's used, if there's no return on investment, it's just an extremely extravagant waste.

At this time, Lei An also noticed the players' alternating reactions of excitement and silence, but he didn't pay too much attention to it.

Looking at the remaining few people, he whispered lowly: "If we can't find that demon within an hour, we'll have to beg for a miracle."

As a member of the Mage Association, Lei An didn't have a deep understanding of this. The pastors standing opposite him, however, all had flushed faces and shame-filled expressions.

It was clear that they had been played by a demon with a sacred artifact and abyssal power, and they all wanted revenge.

However, Zhao Xu understood that there was a reason for this. In reality, if he hadn't gone to search for Peter's whereabouts today and obtained the demon's information...
Here is the translation of the text:

So, today, the goddess church headquarters will likely experience an event similar to those in the past, where something is lost or someone goes missing, triggering an investigation that ultimately goes nowhere. Even the loophole discovered in the process can be repeated.

Years later, when the ripple effects of the initial event subside, the truth may finally come to light.

However, at least they have already plugged the hole in the original plan, including the method used by the demon to exploit the loophole. This will prevent other major churches and organizations from following suit once they receive the intel.

This is essentially like a deep-seated force, sacrificing a "loophole" indicator. Although the demon may not be able to make the most of this loophole, it will still try to use it to trade for something of sufficient value.

During the meeting between Zhao Xu and the old pastor, Zhao Xu was able to sense that the demon was actually a novice pastor in disguise.

As a result, the demon pastor suddenly transformed into its true form and attacked Zhao Xu.

In a situation where achieving the original target was impossible, the demon pastor chose to kill Zhao Xu to maximize the benefits of this loophole.

This could satisfy the requirements of "Glazet" and make the lord of the underworld happy. The demon may even gain greater benefits.

The "Desecration of the Gods" incident involving the novice pastors was merely an add-on to killing Zhao Xu.

Lian An gazed at Zhao Xu, clearly understanding the logical sequence of events.

In the midst of the entire Saint Heart Cathedral's heightened alertness, the demon's options for returning to its original form were severely limited. After all, the demon was hated by the lord of the underworld and was already weak enough to be easily defeated by the demon.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

After that, Raen has been chatting with Zhao Xu nonstop, trying to avoid tracking down that enemy. Because of his mission, his task has changed to "protection".

Just after confirming with the church, his top priority is to take Zhao Xu, who has become a time bomb, away. "Brandy, Matthew, you two stay here and take care of things. As for Xunsummer, let's go," Raen said lightly, waving at the two people following him.

Seeing Raen about to leave, the old pastor, responsible for guiding the novices, hurriedly said, "Raen, shouldn't we arrange for these novices to be taken to a safe place?"

Raen directly waved his hand, saying, "If the demon can use its shapeshifting ability without restriction, we would have asked for divine power to descend. It won't attack you again, or we leave, and you'll be truly safe, and Brandy and Matthew will stay behind to protect you."

At that moment, Zhao Xu quickly followed Raen.

The demon did not try to hide in any other way, but directly attacked Raen, indicating that the other party had made a decision.

At this time, Zhao Xu was no longer the one who lured fish, but had become the caught fish himself, and naturally had to follow Raen step by step.

However, when he left, he still glanced back at the group of novices.

They didn't know that he would have to come back to teach in a few days, which would be a bit awkward.

Due to the reason that the church's lock is easy to break, the spiritual connection can easily be cut off once far away.

Therefore, Raen this time gave Zhao Xu a new "heart-to-heart connection" that allowed internal communication.
Here is the translation of the text:

"What's the plan next?" Zhao Xu looked at Lei An as if he was wandering aimlessly, leading him to circle around the floor, and then asked.

"Can we do anything? The divine power is so tyrannical, and it's impossible to avoid it."

Lei An also felt a bit helpless at this moment.

"Or maybe I should just take you away, or bring you back to the headquarters quickly?"

Zhao Xu then gently smoothed out the creases on his black ritual robe.

"If it wants to take action against me, it will definitely come back. So, why should I stay there and entangle others?"

"What about not returning to a safe place, is it to let the demon continue to target me?" Zhao Xu analyzed.

"Not wrong, although it sounds a bit cruel, but it's indeed the current situation. As for this, the church will compensate you later."

Lei An said, "This compensation will give you an extra life, but with a small price."

Zhao Xu listened with no big objections, and in fact, he wouldn't have been able to avoid being deceived from start to finish if he didn't have this heavy responsibility.

In reality, ordinary people wouldn't know the truth and wouldn't have to worry about it.

Rights and obligations correspond to each other, and Zhao Xu had received strong support from the beginning.

Now, the church is letting him take the lead and delay the time, while preventing the demon from attacking other novice pastors, which is his responsibility to maintain.

"However, I have a question," Zhao Xu also took the opportunity to raise his doubts.

"What's wrong?"
Here is the translation:

"At the beginning, I can understand that there is no divine intervention, because it's not the master of the abyss who has come, but just a low-level demon, after all. However, as things have reached this scale, the church still insists on not seeking divine intervention, is there not some deeper reason for this?"

After Zhao Xu came out, he had already heard the commotion nearby. Now, this ruckus was not small at all.

Just then, Lei An reconfirmed, "The spiritual link" only existed directly between him and Zhao Xu.

He reconfirmed it again, then Zhao Xu was his true self before he let out a sigh, "From now on, you've got to keep this secret for me."
