Chapter 171: Powerful Restraining Ring

The next day, Zhao Xu returned to the ground of Mistral through the teleportation gate of the Floating City. This was his first time setting foot on this land in many days.

For novice mages in the Floating City, they would frequently travel back and forth between Mistral and the Floating City to complete their tasks. Zhao Xu, however, had been extremely busy in the Floating City, and his schedule was packed to the brim, so he felt a world of difference from the idle players in the Floating City.

Although Anniya had told Zhao Xu yesterday that the "Time Reversal Talisman" was not a divine artifact, it was still a valuable item that could only be crafted with great difficulty. Only an item that could rewind time across all planes could be considered a divine artifact.

Zhao Xu was still being cautious and carefully kept the talisman close to his chest. This item was related to the rules of the game and was extremely valuable. With it, Zhao Xu didn't have to worry about unexpected events caused by Wang Qingwei and the two girls, which could lead to the failure of his task.

The "Mechanical Eye Mirror" that Zhao Xu had obtained yesterday was attached to his eyes, making him look like a mechanical engineer. According to Anniya's instructions, Zhao Xu was supposed to go to the "Dream of the North Wind" magic item shop, where he would find another magic item.

However, after Zhao Xu stepped out of the Ophidian Gate, he stood on the central street, looking at the crowd ahead, and for a moment, he was lost in thought.

Zhao Xu realized that he didn't recognize the streets of Mistral very well.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

As Zhao Xu thought about it, he directly pulled out the book that he had started with from his backpack.

Haward's Convenience Bag, with a capacity of 225 liters, was equivalent to 10 buckets of water and could basically contain whatever Zhao Xu wanted to put in.

At this moment, Zhao Xu lowered his head, checking the complex map on the ground, looking for the location of "North Wind's Dream".

As the capital of magic, Mistral was famous for its shops selling various magical materials, and many mages would even intentionally come to the central street alleys to find the magical items they wanted.

Even legendary items were said to have been bought by someone in these seemingly insignificant alleys.

After looking for a few minutes, Zhao Xu had roughly found the location of his target, although it was a bit off the beaten path.

However, Zhao Xu didn't think too much about it. He had already experienced the outcome of the divination, and now he had stronger equipment. He wasn't afraid of any sudden developments.

Suddenly, a loud cry echoed through the air.

Zhao Xu was startled and turned around, only to see Youyue sitting on a galloping horse, waving at him.

The horse was moving at high speed, and Youyue couldn't get off, so he could only silently gaze at Zhao Xu as they drifted apart.

Zhao Xu looked at Youyue, and memories from the past floated up in his heart. He also waved his hand at Youyue, who disappeared from view.

Thinking that Youyue had finally arrived at the headquarters of the Magic Goddess, Zhao Xu felt a sense of relief, which meant that Youyue could continue his priest's journey.

He had been worried that Youyue and the others might give up after what happened.
Here is the translation of the text:

After walking through three or four alleys, Zhao Xu finally arrived at a secluded corner. According to legend, shops selling rare magical items were usually hidden away from public view. The signboard of "North Wind's Dream" was worn out, and the entire store looked like it was on the verge of bankruptcy. Zhao Xu touched the weapon on his body and reviewed the magical formulas in his mind before entering the store with confidence.

Inside the store, the shelves were neatly arranged with various magical materials. There were mineral balls used to release "Weak Mind" spells, crystal balls for "Mystic Eye" spells, and iron powder for "Human Shrinking" spells. Zhao Xu's extensive knowledge of first- and second-level spells allowed him to recognize the materials and recall the corresponding spells.

Behind the counter stood a plump middle-aged woman wrapped in a thick headscarf. She glanced at Zhao Xu, then returned to her accounting. "Who recommended you?" she asked.

"Anzhenoya," Zhao Xu replied simply.

The woman's expression remained calm, but her eyes narrowed slightly as she looked at Zhao Xu. "Since you were recommended by someone, tell me your name."

"Zhongxia, 3rd-level mage," Zhao Xu replied.

"Ah, that's you. Your things are here," the woman said, pulling out a package from beneath the counter and unwrapping it. She poured the contents onto the counter.

It was a stack of sheepskin papers and a plain silver ring.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu walked over, gently picking up the silver ring in his hand.

"What is this?" Zhao Xu asked.

He didn't need to use the "Detection Magic" spell, so he naturally saved his energy.

The fat woman glanced at Zhao Xu's "Mechanical Eye Mirror" and explained with a bad temper: "This is a hidden ring. Once you activate it, you can enter a hidden state, and this one has been improved in performance."

Zhao Xu suddenly picked up the ring and examined it closely, then directly put it on his own finger.

He didn't have the courage to die because of the ring he found on the road, but the person in front of him, who could be arranged by Anzhi Nia, was naturally reliable.

Each person can equip two rings, but no more.

After putting on the ring, Zhao Xu lightly rubbed the surface of the ring, giving the start command.

Suddenly, his entire body, along with the objects attached to him, began to fade away, and the light shone directly through his body to the ground.

Until the end, Zhao Xu's entire body disappeared, as if it had never existed.

Zhao Xu then lifted his own transparent hands, observing the effect of the spell.

Although he had demonstrated this spell in the final scroll space and lecture hall before, he still felt amazed by it now.

Even in the era of rapidly advancing Earth technology, this hidden effect technology had not yet been applied.

"This ring is the latest product of Floating City," said the middle-aged fat woman.

"In the past, the ring made by the wizard themselves, because the caster was only at level 3, could only sustain for 3 minutes each time."
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu nodded slightly when he heard this, and said, "The duration of the 'Invisible' spell is 1 minute per level. As a 6th-level caster, it can last for 6 minutes."

Just then, the plump woman continued to speak, saying, "Although the old ring could be started countless times in a day, it was necessary to take a break every 3 minutes to restart it, which was not very user-friendly. So, we've launched this new type of 'Invisible Ring', which only needs to be started once and can continue to work until the effect is cancelled."

Zhao Xu listened to this and didn't seem surprised.

This new type of "Invisible Ring" no longer needs to be restarted every 3 minutes, which is indeed a significant improvement. At least, he can have sufficient protection even when he's sleeping.

As he followed the 20 players who were also wizards, he didn't need to constantly remember to restart the ring.

It seems that this is also the reason why Anzhiya deliberately came here to collect this ring.

The only drawback of the second-level spell "Invisibility" is that once an enemy tries to attack, it will become visible. Only the fourth-level spell "Advanced Invisibility" can maintain invisibility while attacking.

However, "Invisibility" is a "Illusion" effect, so it can be dispelled by various true-knowing techniques.

This is also the awkwardness of the "Invisible Ring", which costs 20,000 gold coins. By the time an adventurer can afford it, the monsters they encounter will likely have true-knowing abilities.

Moreover, this spell is not very reliable, and high-level adventurers like the Ranger can detect the direction even if it's difficult to pinpoint. This spell is only visual invisibility, and some footprints and sounds made while walking are impossible to conceal.
Here is the translation of the text:

However, all this cannot conceal its function as a low-level killer. With this ring that can be started infinitely, even without using fireball magic or eternal staff, Zhao Xiu has enough to kill those 20 novice mages one by one in the forest.

"Alright, it's okay, don't waste my time doing business. The route and information about the bandits that the others will take later are all written on this sheepskin paper. You can take your time to read it yourself," said the plump woman in the shop, continuing to flip through her account book.

Zhao Xiu didn't care, cancelled the invisibility effect, and walked out the door. He soon lowered his head to read the sheepskin paper in his hand.

"...Don't look, that kid is definitely not going to be with us again," Esveir whispered to King Qingwei beside him.

"Oh, no, I'm just observing my comrades," King Qingwei smiled back at Esveir.

At this time, a male mage approached and asked, "Qingwei, are you tired? Do you want me to rent a horse for you to ride later?"

But Esveir just gave him a look that made him feel awkward and said, "No need, we have the 'Summon Mount' spell. The magic slot is just not being used."

The man couldn't help but smile awkwardly and walked back into the corner with his head down, greeted by the laughter of those around him. Seeing this scene, the man also felt regretful and looked at Esveir with a hint of disappointment.

Since Zhao Xiu and King Qingwei had been together for a few days, they had been inseparable, even synchronizing their schedules.

This made it impossible for the fans who had been clinging to King Qingwei to approach her again.
Suddenly, another male wizard "Lightning" walked over, his face set with determination, "Condor, what are your thoughts on this task?" Wang Condor smiled slightly, "Lightning, what do you mean by that?" Asvith, however, let out a sarcastic tone, "He's asking you if you have any hints to give him. I'll put it this way: this time, it's an open kill-and-kill mission, but actually it's a selection mission for Floating City, and even later on, there might be a sequel. I guarantee that Floating City will definitely send someone to tail us." Asvith then scanned the entire station with her sharp gaze, saying, "It's impossible to say whether someone is hiding here, with a wicked grin looking at us." Meanwhile, Zhao Xu, who was completely invisible in the corner, was flipping through the book "Transmission Ritual: The Journey of Herroshka" borrowed from the legendary library, and couldn't help but feel a thrill in his heart. This girl is too perceptive!
