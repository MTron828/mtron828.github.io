Chapter 225: Praying for Divine Candles

The moment the group left the room, only Zhao Xu was left sitting alone, gazing at his own reflection.

He was silently contemplating the "touch" that had just emerged in his mind.

The "Star Lake" originated from a meteorite that fell from the sky and created a massive crater, which eventually filled with water and became a lake. Initially, it was a scenic spot near Winter City, a favorite among adventurers.

However, thirty years ago, someone discovered a piece of precious silver worth thousands of gold coins at the bottom of Star Lake. This event forever changed the tranquil surface of the lake, which was once bathed in blood.

The meteorite that fell from the sky altered the mineral deposits at the bottom of Star Lake, transforming the low-grade silver mine into a precious silver mine. Before the meteorite fell, the mine had been explored, but the low-quality silver made it unprofitable to extract and refine.

However, when the precious silver mine was discovered, even if only a small amount of silver could be extracted from each ton of ore, it represented a profitable mine. As a result, Star Lake began to be occupied by various powers, and the mine owners formed a mining association. With the production of precious silver, their influence also grew.

Meanwhile, the mine owners cultivated relationships with Winter City and the Northern Alliance through second-generation marriages.
This time, the people led by Volan were chosen by the "miners" and were able to get a foothold in the player community. Zhao Xiu was clear that this kind of connection was the reason why the Winter City's actions were slow after the slave trading incident was exposed. Players were worried that by the time the program was completed, all the evidence would have disappeared into thin air.

At this time, he heard the sound of hurried footsteps outside the corridor. The players' first reaction was to go to "Star Lake" to make a statement. Generally, in the many city-states of Arthur, no matter how rough the local thugs were, when they encountered players who possessed professional skills and had resurrection stones, they would all come out to apologize.

If players gathered and went up to the door, even the city hall would have to avoid the sharp edge. However, the players did not expect that those who went to make a statement would actually meet with the head-on counterattack of the Mining Association.

The miners were clear that as long as they could keep the players' mouths shut, they could naturally use their long-term relationships to repair things. However, they still underestimated the situation.

The players in Winter City were not all individuals. There were countless people who had relationships with each other, such as classmates and teachers, due to geographical ties. Generally, the players in Winter City were all in groups of three to five people, because everyone would have their own classmates and friends.

This was also the reason why Zhao Xiu was able to take down the town mayor of Star Lake, and was able to help many classmates. Therefore, the Mining Association completely misjudged the situation, and they killed the first batch of players. The second time was when these players and their classmates and friends arrived. When this batch was killed again, the next time would be to roll a larger snowball.
Here is the translation of the text:

This is also the reason why Zhao Xu dare not take rash actions, he needs to ensure that at least dozens of players witness the evil deeds of the slave trader, so as to guarantee that this matter will not be suppressed.

At this point, Zhao Xu relies on the cries of the dormitory corridor and has slowly begun to understand.

Wu Tong, the first wizard to graduate from the Winter City, was investigating the disappearance of the population in the "Fallen Star Lake" case, and was killed by the mine owners, only to come back to life.

Wu Tong is a gentle and humble person, taking his responsibilities very seriously, and giving sincere advice to players, without any arrogance.

He is also one of the few players who have just promoted to level 1 wizard and has been selected as a teaching assistant by the Winter City Wizard Association.

Therefore, Wu Tong has a high reputation among the wizard apprentices, and his influence is far-reaching. Even a few players have successfully promoted under his guidance.

Zhao Xu recognized Wu Tong from his past life, who was the counselor of the neighboring university, a young and outstanding person.

In fact, he started playing the game to better integrate into the student group, but unexpectedly surpassed others.

Wu Tong's real name is "Suhang", and in his past life, he had even gone to his home with "Zhang Qi" as the leader.

At that time, Wu Tong was almost at level 7, and his name was well-known in the player community.

Even when interacting with people from other cities, Wu Tong was considered a dignified figure, with a sense of honor.

So this time, Wu Tong's death caused the entire academy to be in an uproar.

As for Zhao Xu, he re-examined his own strength.

He possesses the "Gem Jump" spell, and escape is not a difficult task. However, the next battle is basically a matter of bleeding to the last moment.

Simple spells cannot solve the problem.
Here is the translation of the text:

While Zhao Xu, who is skilled in the "fireball technique", can only release two fireballs at most, he needs to choose the crucial moments to unleash them.

Moreover, the entire battle in the "Battle of Star Lake" was brewing slowly on the forum, and the situation became increasingly desperate towards the end.

In reality, the mine owners initially didn't react at all. They were waiting for the investigation team to arrive in four or five days and then arrange everything according to the previous routine.

However, the players' battles with the mine owners kept escalating, causing the mine owners to finally deploy their family guards to defend against the players' attacks.

The process was like two adults wielding small knives and slashing at each other, unable to inflict fatal wounds.

It wasn't until everyone was injured that only one person could leave alive.

So, the battle that lasted for several days was basically a protracted and grueling one, and Zhao Xu couldn't afford to rush into it and then suddenly explode, as it would be completely unwise for him.

He needed to engage in a prolonged battle.

After killing the five players and four guards with his fireball technique, Zhao Xu felt a faint intuition in his mind.

He needed to use slaughter to unlock the location of the teleportation gate.

If he used the "giant scythe" in his hand, he might be able to react quickly after the slaughter.

He wouldn't have to wait until he heard the news about the Star Lake slave trade and then react.

This requires him to become a warrior.

The reason why the War Wizards were able to leave a legendary reputation in Arthur's era was mainly because they had spell support, and their attack power was not inferior to that of warriors, and they could also be self-sufficient, so their reputation was great.

Therefore, even Zhao Xu, who has the "complete spell table", can achieve similar things, and he is even stronger.
The only flaw is that some spell circles are too high for him to use.

Zhao Xu took out his backpack and the giant scythe and walked back to the quiet room, then locked the door.

Next, Zhao Xu took out the "Prayer Candle" and placed it on the table.

By now, there was nothing left to do, and all the signs pointed to the fact that the "Half-Dimensional Space" was not just a "Steel Will" ability, but something much more.

Especially since he had gone to the temple of death gods in the underworld and learned about the "Artificial Death Gods" plan, which was created by exchanging lives of priests.

So Zhao Xu was certain that he needed to enter the Half-Dimensional Space to find out what was going on, and he also had a connection with the "Star Lake" in his past life.

Zhao Xu knew that this battle was not just a sudden explosion, but a long-term process.

And the divine artifact he possessed was still in a dormant state.

So he needed to use the Prayer Candle.

However, if he just summoned the Prayer Candle, he would only be able to see the battle between the two biological entities and would not be able to reap the benefits.

Therefore, he had to do it himself.

Thinking about this, Zhao Xu took out a book from his backpack, which was as white as snow and even had a feather attached to it, making it look like an angelic book.

The title of the book was "Tuning".

Tuning is a very unfamiliar word.

However, it has a well-known spell - Tuning Heavenly Tribes.

This is a holy magic of the 7th circle, and above it is the 9th circle's "Higher Tuning Heavenly Tribes".

The main effect of this spell is that it allows him to merge with celestial beings.

After merging, he can obtain the "Spell Ability" and "Supernatural Ability" of the other party.
Here is the translation:

Zhang Xiaozhi transformed into a divine servant of the fiery heavens, and with the nine-ring spellcasting ability, he gained corresponding supernatural abilities. However, as a 19th-level priest, he couldn't access his spellcasting and spell-like abilities.

It's worth noting that Zhang Xiaozhi was cautious about the "Deep Dungeon Refining" in the underground temple, which was actually the opponent's series of spell-like abilities, such as "Group Monster Binding" and "Laws of Shaking". Spellcasting ability was everything to Arthur.

Therefore, once Zhang Xiaozhi could perform "Resonance", he would break through the limitations of "Transformation Spell" and obtain "Spellcasting Ability", and at that time, he would become the harvester of death on the battlefield. However, "Resonance with Heaven" was a seven-ring spell, which Zhang Xiaozhi couldn't use now.

However, "Resonance with Heaven" was only one of the resonance methods. There were other resonance methods beyond that.

At this time, Zhang Xiaozhi directly lit the "Incense Stick of Prayer" in front of him. Then, he waited for the gates of heaven to open.
