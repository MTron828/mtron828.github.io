Chapter 153: Starting Spell

"'Forget it,' Wang Congwei said, pulling on Aiswey's sleeve. Sometimes she still liked to call him 'Shadow'."

Aiswey had glanced at the lecture notes that Zhao Xu had revised, which were mostly consistent with what Zhao Xu had explained in his lecture. The remaining three parts were not consistent, naturally, because Zhao Xu had re-performed them based on the audience's reactions.

This also proved that the revisions on the manuscript were completed independently and could only be processed in this way.

This was also the reason for the surprise and excitement that many young wizards and apprentices felt when they saw Zhao Xu's performance.

"Are you sure you didn't secretly collude with him before? Do you know he has the ability to cast arbitrary spells?" Aiswey looked at Wang Congwei with a suspicious gaze.

Only they knew that Zhao Xu was only a 3rd-level wizard.

It's not difficult for a high-level wizard to achieve that.

But for a 3rd-level wizard, it's truly a fantasy.

"You forgot, didn't you?" Wang Congwei suddenly smiled mysteriously. "At the time, you were so afraid of failure that you weren't willing to admit it. You only called out for 'Revival' to let me help you recover, right?"

"Aiswey said directly that 'he cast the spell.'"

"'So it was,' Aiswey understood.

At that time, she was trapped in deep fear and didn't want to think about it too much.

In fact, she only shouted 'Revival' in the hope that Zhao Xu had prepared that scroll.

Generally speaking, if you're alone and fail to cast a spell, you're basically doomed."
Here is the translation of the text:

As there was still a chance to use magic to exempt oneself once more, it would mean that the negative state resulting from the trap was not severe. This paradox led the lone wanderers to have no need to prepare this spell. On that day, Zhao Xu did not know in advance that he would team up with them, let alone prepare this spell. Asciwich thought about this and couldn't help but glare at Wang Qingwei with disdain. The other party had always known this, but deliberately didn't tell her, waiting for her to get fooled.

After Zhao Xu left the academic podium, he was still filled with the aura of authority he had on the lecture stage, and no student dared to approach him presumptuously. Usually, lecturers leave the podium, indicating the end of the exchange.

Zhao Xu stood on the ground of Floating City, gazing at the distant three-blood moon in the sky, recalling his performance today. The squares in Floating City were not sealed off, allowing the natural sunlight to spread and nourish the various plants in the flowerpots. However, the mages had designed the flowerpots in Floating City according to the requirements of an indoor garden, so that even if the world lost sunlight, the plants in the city could still obtain energy and continue to grow through the arcane symbols.

On this night, Zhao Xu could even smell the fragrance of the flowers. Then he noticed Anniya standing in the shadow of the flowerpots, who had apparently been watching him for a long time.

"Have you finished playing the hero?" Anniya asked.

Zhao Xu smiled, and it was indeed the Anniya he knew who loved to make jokes.

At this moment, Zhao Xu felt his state was excellent, with the excitement from completing a lecture still stimulating his emotions.

"What happy things have you encountered over the past few days?" Anniya asked.
Zhao Xu gazed up at the starry sky, sighed, and said, "I've finally realized that I can grasp a little bit of fate, and it's a bit of a sentimental moment." Anseni Nora looked at him with a thoughtful expression and followed his gaze to the stars.

Zhao Xu had asked Zhang Qi to pay attention to Cui Lu the previous day, and later, Cui Lu indeed safely completed the day's climbing. There was no dramatic plot where Zhang Qi got a concussion while protecting Cui Lu and became unable to play.

Everything was going smoothly.

This was also Zhao Xu's first attempt to actively interfere with someone's fate, and it was a successful example.

Before his appearance, Wang Qingwei and other disciples of the law could perform the awakening ritual five days earlier. However, due to his appearance, the awakening time of the opponent was delayed by five days.

Everything returned to its original state.

So Zhao Xu had worried that some kind of catastrophic event might occur. Fortunately, everything was normal, and a butterfly effect was enough to influence the outcome.

"If you're confident now, come to the training room tomorrow morning after restoring all your spells. I'll train you in some uses of secondary spells."

"You've improved significantly from being a beginner."

The next day, Zhao Xu logged in to the game and thought to himself that he would need to spend three hours preparing his spells. He couldn't help but shake his head and smile wryly.

The price of showing off in front of others is naturally the hard work behind the scenes.

All three professions - mage, priest, and scribe - require an hour's preparation of spells. However, if Zhao Xu didn't use his spells, he wouldn't need to prepare them again.

Especially, the first-level priest would indeed waste an hour of his time.
Here is the translation of the text:

Essentially, Zhao Xu won't move those few level-one priest skills unless he has more spell slots. Anzhenya occupied most of the space on the seventh floor of the Octagonal Tower, especially the room that had never been opened before. However, this time Anzhenya arranged a spell battle room for him, with the most notable feature being the automatic repair function of the space around the room, as well as its strong positive energy therapeutic effects. Even Zhao Xu just stood in the room, his HP increased by an additional level, from the original 17 HP to over 20 HP. Anzhenya was still wearing the same golden-red robe he wore previously. "Teacher, do you need to be so solemn?" Zhao Xu asked in surprise.

Anzhenya was wearing the robe he had worn when Zhao Xu sat on the throne of the Oracle King and crossed the historical river. This robe was a significant artifact for Anzhenya, as it had been worn by the Goddess of Magic when she became a goddess. The robe's defensive capabilities were unmatched, providing twice the effect of a wizard's armor and adding a maximum of 8 levels of armor. Moreover, the robe allowed the wearer to recover three spell slots daily, even at the highest level of nine.

Zhao Xu usually saw Anzhenya wear this robe when he had special significance, such as the time he took him to the Itel King's inheritance. "Today, I'm mainly letting you get a head start on understanding the basics of a wizard's battle before the Great Disaster," Anzhenya said.

Zhao Xu couldn't help but think about this sentence when he heard it.
Here is the translation of the text:

"What's the opening move?"
According to his thinking as a 3rd-level mage, high-level mages would greet each other with the 9th-level spell "Magic Disintegration" instead of exchanging pleasantries.
This spell can destroy an opponent's entire magical defense and equipment.
It's a fatal blow to both friend and foe, and whoever gets hit is bound to be a lifelong enemy.
"You can think about which spell you learned in the final scroll space that has this kind of power?" Anzhiya continued to ask.
Zhao Xuan was taken aback and fell into deep thought, remaining silent.
The range refers to the 2nd-level spells he learned.
Moreover, it's more likely to be 2nd-level arcana, as 3rd-level divine magic is something the scroll scholars cannot put out.
"Ghost Strike?" Zhao Xuan tentatively asked.
This spell allows mages to ignore any armor, innate defense, and defensive shields, making it a top-notch assassin.
Even if Zhao Xuan's former transformed form, the Blaze God Servant, had defense levels of over 30 ranks, once without innate defense, the defense would be no higher than that of this rookie mage.
"Ah, although we mages can deal damage output, it's still a minority. The real ones who can deal damage output are divine mages, so the scroll scholars are truly the first in physical output. But I'm asking about mages now?" Anzhiya looked at Zhao Xuan with anticipation.
"Transformative Magic?" Zhao Xuan tried to ask.
"How can a 9th-level shape-shifting spell be of little use?" Anzhiya mocked.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Is it a flash of dust?" Zhao Xu continued to say, and this spell can be said to be one of the most practical spells in the second-level magic, many mages like to remember one.

"It's the last chance."

"Is it a secondary rapid burst?" Zhao Xu pondered for a moment before answering.

After hearing Zhao Xu's answer, An Ti Noya nodded slightly in satisfaction: "Ah, it seems there is hope."

The rapid burst spell, Zhao Xu had tried it in the scroll space.

It has three series, the lowest being the second-level magic - secondary rapid burst.

After casting this spell, Zhao Xu's surroundings would become extremely slow, and he would only recover after completing the corresponding actions.

This is equivalent to him gaining an extra action, and this action can have an impact on the world, unlike the time freeze spell that can only be used by himself.

The second-level magic "secondary rapid burst" only allows Zhao Xu to barely move and is not enough to cast a spell.

The fourth-level magic "rapid burst" allows him to get a standard action, which can be used to cast a standard action spell or make an attack, etc.

The eighth-level magic "high-level rapid burst" allows him to get a full round of time.

However, all three spells have extremely serious costs, that is, after the limited time obtained ends, he will fall into a coma.

In a battlefield, it's really a matter of waiting to die.

"Teacher, doesn't the rapid burst spell have a big flaw?" Zhao Xu asked.

At that time, he saw the negative costs and gave up.

Although this spell looks beautiful, it can force time to slow down and allow him to make more choices when attacked by the enemy.

"That's what I'm asking you, what is the casting action of the rapid burst spell series?" An Ti Noya asked softly.
Here is the translation:

"Instinctive action, yeah," Zhao Xu replied simply.

Instinctive action consumes the same amount of time as swift action, and both can be completed in an instant.

However, instinctive action is stronger because it's equivalent to a reaction in an instant, as long as you think about it.

For example, the swift explosion series of spells all have simple one-syllable incantations.

As long as Zhao Xu says "ah", the spell is released and completed.

"If I tell you, we actually have a way to avoid getting dizzy, don't we?" Anzhi Noya said.

Zhao Xu remained calm at this moment.

This implies that he was born with the ability to move a few more times than others.
