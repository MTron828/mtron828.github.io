Chapter 617: Truth and Falsehood, Father and Daughter

"What's wrong? Are you hesitating?" said the old man with a white beard, who had transformed into a vague, ambiguous shadow before him.

Zhao Xu could only faintly discern the subtle changes in the old man's expression, as if he was indeed communicating with him.

"In terms of magic, even with Anzhi Noya and the ultimate scroll, you won't be able to learn more from me, no matter how hard you try."

"But the 'Nine Swords' system is the 'Treasured Jewel of the Nation' that the entire Eastern Empire treasures. Only a handful of people have touched the highest level of mastery over the years."

"Not even Anzhi Noya, who should be considered your teacher, has been able to convey the deepest secrets without building a foundation for the nation."

As the old man's vague, shadowy form hesitated, his tone took on a hint of pride: "As a foreigner, you won't be able to enter the secret library, even after a hundred years of wandering in the Eastern Empire, unless you're willing to adopt the customs of our country."

"So, right now, it's indeed the best opportunity for you."

Zhao Xu had finally grasped the concept of "neurasthenia" - the joy of the mentally unstable.

Just moments ago, the old man had been shouting and threatening him, but now he seemed confident and eager to impart the "Nine Swords Unmatched" to him. The sudden change was too drastic.

Zhao Xu couldn't help but let out a sigh.

He really wanted to learn.
Here is the translation of the text:

Because he was clear, even if he went to the "Star Sky Academy" that was about to be established, he would still be unable to truly become a member of the Dong Ti Empire, unable to become one of the 12 great families. And he had no confidence at all in distinguishing between what he had learned and what was true.

He was worried that the other party would casually alter some content, and he would be stuck with it for his entire life. Or, he would be given half-true, half-false "absolute skills" to practice, and ultimately make no progress at all. Or, the other party might actually be crazy, unaware of their own consciousness, and modify the entire Nine Swords system to be chaotic.

Zhao Xu's fragile heart could not bear such stimulation. At this moment, they were in the nascent stage of creation, and each minute was incredibly precious.

Moreover, Zhao Xu had already discovered the secrets of the underground and completed this task perfectly, so there was no need to linger.

He thought to himself, wearing the "Starlight Cloak" and "Great Sage's Robes" that had lost all usefulness, and shook his head, saying, "Thank you for your kindness, but I'm afraid I cannot accept this blessing."

"Since it is so, then it is so," he said.

In an instant, the light before Zhao Xu's eyes became solidified, and a middle-aged man with a refined bearing suddenly appeared.

He was wearing a white robe with no defensive armor, and his original sturdy wooden sword had become slender and sharp. His calm and composed demeanor was like a godly being from a book.

Zhao Xu, who saw this scene, still felt his heart racing several times faster.

Because he was unable to detect even a hint of "emotion" in the eyes of the middle-aged man.

"What did we just say just now?" the middle-aged man, who resembled a humble and courteous gentleman, asked Zhao Xu with an incredibly polite tone.

The magnetic voice was so soothing that people couldn't help but listen.
Here is the translation:

The other person who shares similar qualities with him is Wang Qingwei.

However, Wang Qingwei's eyes are indeed filled with a deep love and pursuit of life, and she thinks that her ultimate destination is this world. Zhao Xu has no doubts about this.

The middle-aged man in front of him looks deceitful, and the warmth he emits is enough to make countless girls fall for him.

It's only because Zhao Xu has had contact with Wang Qingwei that he can distinguish the subtle differences and awaken to the truth.

"Just teach me the Nine Swords' Techniques, but I refuse," Zhao Xu thought to himself, but his mouth mechanically responded.

At this moment, he discovered that the magical power that had been suppressing him started to weaken.

However, this time, it didn't bring him a sense of warmth.

The feeling of being controlled just now made him feel as if he was walking barefoot on a snow-covered road in the middle of winter.

"Young man, don't be so afraid," the middle-aged man said, directly putting his hands behind his back and looking up at the sky.

At that moment, the dark void that was originally filled with a cluster of corpses seemed to transform into a giant wheel, rotating and evolving into the entire Arthurian dimension.

The entire Arthurian universe, with all the interconnected dimensional models, presented a three-dimensional appearance, rotating and intersecting in mid-air, like a complex star chart.

"Don't you feel that these dimensions are so vast and beautiful? Every time we see them, we can't help but bow down in reverence," said Yining, who had transformed into a middle-aged man.

It seemed as if he had seen the most magnificent and grand picture of life, and he was deeply moved.

However, only Zhao Xu didn't notice these things, and in his heart, he only felt a deeper sense of caution.
He had already felt that the man before him, with his unyielding and dignified appearance, was like two completely different people. Perhaps, the madness of the recent past and the story of the past with Ernest had awakened another personality, which had been slowly emerging.

Is it really a dual personality?

If Zhao Xu had not been standing here all along, he would have thought that the past and present were two completely different people.

"So, I'll take my leave, Elder Weng?" Zhao Xu asked tentatively.

At this moment, he had understood why no one or power had attempted to open up this desolate land for thousands of years.

On one hand, the land was constantly emitting evil energy, and even the strongest life force of the rice plants was unable to withstand this destruction, resulting in their death.

On the other hand, the undead waves that occasionally attacked the surface made it impossible for this land to have a peaceful day.

To solve these two problems, one had to face the hundreds of "Devil King devices" in this mysterious cave.

But to dismantle the Devil King devices, one had to solve the "Elder Weng" before him.

Especially, the Elder Weng who had just spoken was the same as the Elder Weng who had set up 99 "Legendary Mage" arrangements, and only the last one was the Elder Weng who had targeted himself as the "Nine Swords Master".

Therefore, everything had formed a vicious cycle.

Unless the "Legendary Mage" Elder Weng was resolved, it would be impossible to make this desolate land peaceful and full of life again.

Even with the power of the Magic Goddess, it could only temporarily revitalize the land of Yanan.

Zhao Xu's tomorrow was after the Legendary Mage, not now.

"Of course, I'll see you out," the middle-aged man, Elder Weng, extended his hand to Zhao Xu without any magical intention.
Here is the translation of the text:

"It's thanks to you rejecting my other consciousness, allowing him to no longer occupy this body with the remnants of the Nine Swords. As such, I naturally need to fulfill your small request."

"Senior Wén Bùbiè, you two consciousnesses, are they rotating?"

"It's roughly rotating, but not necessarily. Sometimes it's ten days, half a month, and sometimes it's a year or more. It depends on who can hold out."

Wén Bùbiè, the middle-aged man, burst out laughing, as if he had encountered something very exciting.

"Can't hold out?"

"No mistake, you can understand it as sleeping. This is the rule of this body. Whoever falls asleep, it's a turn. That is, as long as I don't sleep, I'll always be myself."

As he spoke, he revealed his sharp teeth, looking very satisfied that his opponent had finally been worn out and replaced by him.

It's amazing that he stayed awake?

Zhāo Xù heard this and couldn't help but take a closer look at the middle-aged man Wén Bùbiè.

Unless it's an immortal being or a constructed being without a physical body, even the strongest being needs sleep to regulate their entire body.

Compared to humans, a few hundred years old spirit like himself still needs to sleep four hours a night and eight hours if he wants to prepare for magic. Therefore, Zhāo Xù couldn't imagine what kind of experience it would be to stay awake for a hundred years.

"You don't want to learn the Nine Swords from him, and it's also because you're afraid that the crazy person can't pass on the way. Well, we've met for a reason. Although I'm confined here and can't leave, I'll gift you this ancient weapon 'Transmission' with my hand."

Note: "Wén Bùbiè" is the name of the character, which means "Wén Bùbiè" is the given name.
When it came to this point, the middle-aged man, Wèi Bù Bǎi, stopped in his tracks. In front of them was a circular ring, trampled out by the chaotic footsteps of the two men. It was as if Wèi Bù Bǎi had only managed to bring Zhao Xu to this location.

Wèi Bù Bǎi then threw the wooden sword in his hand, and Zhao Xu, taken aback, caught it firmly. Ancient weapons, generally corresponding to the nine styles of the sword, were not just magical weapons - they were also "inherited" weapons with a history.

To activate the ancient weapon's abilities, one had to perform the "ancient ritual," and even different abilities could be obtained at each level, with limitless power.

"Once you hold this ancient weapon and head to the East Land, you can obtain a supreme skill from the East Land Empire, which is also a rule, and I consider it a compensation to you," Wèi Bù Bǎi said.

Zhao Xu took the ancient weapon and, unable to restrain himself, asked, "What's the secret of your ancient weapon, Master Wèi?"

"It's a gift to the person of virtue, and I don't need it," Wèi Bù Bǎi replied, his expression as calm as the surface of a lake.

As he spoke, Wèi Bù Bǎi's robe fluttered in the wind, as if he were standing at the bow of a ship, advancing into the wind.

Zhao Xu, however, couldn't help but nod, then turn and take a step forward, preparing to take the next step.

Just as he was about to take his next step, Zhao Xu suddenly froze, his eyes fixed on Wèi Bù Bǎi's face. It was as if he had been splashed with a bucket of cold water.

The reason was that he saw a faint, almost imperceptible smile on Wèi Bù Bǎi's face, as if he were shining a flashlight on his lower jaw. It was a sight that sent shivers down his spine.
Here is the translation of the text:

"What's going on?" The dignified Wèi Bǎi didn't change his expression, still holding his fan and cloak, and asked Zhao Xù with a smile.

"I think it's surprising that it takes such a huge surprise to make Wèi Bǎi, your senior, show such an uncontrollable smile when he sees me about to leave the circle at this moment?"

Zhao Xù, with his 14-year-old spirit and 19-year-old perception, sensed something unusual. He realized that this was indeed earth-shaking news that couldn't be concealed.

Zhao Xù immediately stopped in his tracks and stepped back into the circle.

"Excuse me, Mr. Wèi Bǎi. As a person, I'm rather timid. When someone gives me something, I'm not excited and forget myself, but instead become extremely cautious and hesitant to take any action."

Zhao Xù showed his white teeth and said, "If you don't give me this ancient weapon, I might have unknowingly walked away."

At this moment, Zhao Xù couldn't help but express his joy.

Generally speaking, humans have their own natural reactions, such as when answering the phone, people tend to take what's offered to them.

When leaving, even if one's heart is calm, they can't help but think about the value of the gift.

Not to mention ancient weapons, which can attract people's attention and make them recall its history. This can easily lead someone to unknowingly leave.

"Ah ha."

In an instant, the middle-aged Wèi Bǎi couldn't help but burst into laughter, "You said it, humans just love to pretend to be smart, don't they?"

"Just like that, they unknowingly walk out and quietly die without any pain, which is not good, right?"

Immediately, Wèi Bǎi's expression turned cold, and he no longer showed the warmth and smile he had just displayed.
Here is the translation of the text:

"It seems I was right." Zhao Xu shook his head, "This is the first hundredth demon device, specifically designed to confine oneself. As soon as you step out, everything will be taken away from you, right?"

"Not wrong, it seems you have a natural talent for magic. You can even judge these things by feeling them. Oh? Did you just receive the detailed diagram of the demon device from me?"

Wen Bu immediately shook his head, "This is strange. So many young people have come before, and those with extraordinary talents are not rare. Why is he so fond of you?"

"Is it because you said something that touched him?"

At this moment, Wen Bu was deep in thought.

Meanwhile, he kept scanning Zhao Xu with his gaze.

Zhao Xu also quietly analyzed the situation in this short period of time.

On this land, anyone who tries to cast a spell will be subject to the constraints of the anti-magic field, and even the magic on their body will automatically disappear, as if they have entered a spell-ineffective zone.

But if the opponent wants to trick me into leaving like this, it means one thing - the opponent, a legendary mage, will also be affected by the anti-magic field.

Not wrong! As a mage, the opponent's consciousness cannot use the power of the "Nine Swords" to break the anti-magic state!

So, he can counterattack the opponent.

Thinking this, Zhao Xu quietly reached into his pocket and felt around.

No one could have imagined that a legendary mage and a five-ring mage would use their fists to settle the score.

However, fists are indeed the biggest truth in the anti-magic field.
In an instant, Zhao Xu poured all his strength into his clenched fists, preparing to unleash his thunderous punch.

"Oh, I've been asleep for too long," he said, his voice trembling with excitement.

As he spoke, Wén Bùfǎi couldn't help but burst out laughing, "Ah, the Star-Cloth of the Celestial Bodies, the Robes of the Sage, it's just as I expected!"

"So, you're saying you know my daughter, the useless An Ti Nuoya?"
