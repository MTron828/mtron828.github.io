Chapter 659: The Secret of Pollution, the Battle of the Sage!

In the past, when Zhao Xu was choosing his path forward, he had heard of "Pollution Chemists" - researchers who had discovered the same world of progression.

However, at that time, it was his mentor who had cautioned him against this path, which required a state of moderate to severe corruption.

In this rumored world, evil is a contagious and corrupting power.

Even a saintly warrior who strictly adheres to moral codes can still be corrupted by prolonged battles against evil.

Most true heroes will use magic or atone for their sins to resist the corrupting influence of evil. However, some adventurers may choose to embrace evil and accept the power of corruption.

The "Pollution Chemists" are a prime example of this.

As a researcher of ancient texts and mysterious artifacts, the "Dark Knowledge" series is a common term used to describe their profession.

Zhao Xu quietly recalled the contents of his mind about this world.

Fortunately, when he became a researcher, he had prepared himself for this.

Entering a location shrouded in evil, touching evil objects, being attacked by special monsters, and executing evil tasks will all lead to being "corrupted" by evil.

Zhao Xu was puzzled - why hadn't Arthur been corrupted by this evil, regardless of whether it was the Abyss or Hell? They were both equally pure and evil.

But now it seems clear that the "Cthulhu" in Lake of Fire, which he had heard of, was related to these creatures.

It's likely that the "evil" they spread was the source of these "corruptions".
Here is the translation of the text:

The degree of pollution in the physical sense is manifested as "physical decay", corresponding to the "decay point", with strong resilience to resist. In the spiritual sense, it is manifested as "spiritual decay", corresponding to the "decay point", with willpower to resist.

Initially, Zhao Xu did not know what world he had entered, so he couldn't search for anything. However, after receiving a hint from the other party, he realized that he had entered a world filled with terror elements, and after obtaining this key information, he began to activate his dimensional skills and continuously search for related background knowledge.

For some reason, he felt an intense sense of caution towards the abnormal man in front of him, so he decided to do his homework first. As the background knowledge popped up in his mind, Zhao Xu's sense of urgency also intensified.

The symptoms of decay and corruption are divided into five stages: "none", "mild", "moderate", "severe", and "crazy/death". The character's physical and mental qualities and perception values also determine the specific decay points of the latter stages.

For ordinary people with 10 attribute points, the decay points are 0. For mild corruption, it is 1-5 points, moderate 6-17 points, and severe 18-41 points. If it reaches 42 points, physical decay leads to death, and spiritual decay leads to madness. As for Zhao Xu's current physical and mental conditions, his physical decay is severe, with 42-98 points, and 99 points leading to death. His 17 perception corresponds to spiritual decay, with severe decay being 30-69 points, and 70 points leading to madness.

Thinking about this, Zhao Xu couldn't help but ask the old man, "Senior, please tell me how much the exposure to this space will increase the decay and decay points?"
Here is the translation:

"Exposed to evil in the outside world, it's one point every 24 hours."
"However, here it's calculated based on one point every hour, and both are contaminated at the same time."
One point every hour!
This is absolutely no exception.

Isn't it implying that after 70 hours, he will directly descend into severe mental symptoms of madness.
After 99 hours, he will directly die from severe physical decay.

The deformed man continues to gaze at Zhao Xu with great enthusiasm, at the completely pale and tender flesh of his white skin, "It seems that you can contact the 'scroll scholar' in the other world, and you won't be the easy type. You seem to know most of the secrets."

"Isn't it strange?"

"Generally, adventurers will gain a new symptom every time they enter a new polluted stage, which is the corrupting effect. Logically, I should only have a light, medium, and severe symptom now."

"How can it become so exaggerated now?"

Zhao Xu couldn't help but nod, and said that advancing to a "pollution chemist" requires mental decay, which is a psychological issue.

So, this means that the man's physical body has become so deformed because he is situated deep within this secret fortress.

The man's body currently has symptoms such as "worm nest" where parasitic worms are emerging from wounds.
His spine is curved due to "rickets" symptoms.
His skull is abnormally large due to "rebuilding the skull" symptoms.
His body is covered in mold due to "skin fungus" symptoms.
His eyes are rotten due to "wizard's eyes" symptoms.
His nose is rotten due to "rotten nose" symptoms.
With just six severe symptoms visible to the naked eye, he has become a monstrous being that is neither human nor demon.
Here is the translation of the text:

It's even more impossible to say what kind of mental state he's in, with symptoms of "recurring chaos," "extreme fear," or "murderous fury" - which one is hard to tell.

The man's expression turned cold and ruthless, saying, "You know that as long as you enter a new polluted stage, you can use some kind of magic to suppress it and go back to the original stage within 24 hours, like downgrading from intermediate to beginner."

"That's right," Zhao Xu said. "If it exceeds 24 hours, only miracles, prayers, and the like can reduce the stage pollution. Otherwise, even if you use magic, you can only reduce the current stage pollution."

At this moment, Zhao Xu's eyes flashed through the list of magic in his mind.

The five-ring magic "Redemption" is complex and requires completing tasks to reduce pollution by a certain amount, with a maximum of the caster's level.
The three-ring magic "Remove Curse" reduces one point of collapse, and the three-ring magic "Remove Disease" reduces one point of corruption.
The four-ring magic "Recovery" can reduce one point of pollution for every four levels, and Zhao Xu, as a 33rd-level caster, can reduce eight points. Moreover, he can use it within 24 hours after crossing stages to reduce pollution and go back to the original stage.
The seven-ring magic "Higher Recovery" reduces one point for every level, but he can't use it now.
The nine-ring magic "Miracle" and "Prayer" can reduce to the upper limit of the next stage, without time restrictions.
These spells can only take effect once a day, so Zhao Xu can't use "Recovery" to cover both.

Moreover, using these spells requires him not to be exposed to an evil polluted environment.
Clearly, this is not the case.

Thinking this way, Zhao Xu turned his gaze towards the stone door outside.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

As the deformed man saw this scene, he revealed a cold smile, saying, "If I were you, I wouldn't think about going out."

"Because that stone door has a curse, and the moment you go out, your brain will be directly polluted, and you'll fall into madness. This is why I've been trapped here."

Zhao Xu couldn't help but raise an eyebrow at the man in front of him, asking, "How did you survive?"

The deformed man chuckled, saying, "Very simple."

"If the pollution is so uncontrollable, then adventurers in this world should just stay at home."

Zhao Xu quickly grasped the key question. At the moment, he was clearly trying to hang on until Anshen Yao's aid arrived.

The most critical thing was to stay sane.

The deformed man laughed, saying, "Some natural items can absorb pollution for their owners. For example, a pure jade pendant, a high-quality sheepskin paper made from a full moon sheep, and a finely carved wooden statue struck by lightning."

"One such item is enough to absorb 7 points, allowing an average adventurer to sustain themselves for a week-long journey."

"Can't you carry more?" Zhao Xu asked back.

If the question was so simple, there was no reason for the man in front of him to become like this.

If he was in this world, he would definitely have enough supplies to last for a hundred years or even create things at will.

Before, he had been in the city, never having experienced the desperate situation of running out of supplies. As a powerful mage who could create things without sacrificing life energy through "supernatural magic," he was even more skilled in this regard.

A mage would never be in a predicament due to supply shortages.

Of course, the premise is that he is strong enough.
Here is the translation of the text:

The deformed man shook his head, saying, "After the object absorbs corruption, it will immediately become dark, soft, and gradually decompose. Moreover, these objects, exposed to pollution simultaneously, will mutually influence each other, eventually decomposing step by step. Therefore, having too many objects will actually have a strengthening effect on pollution, accelerating this process."

"One item can absorb 7 points, two items 12 points, and four items 16 points, which is the peak. After that, adding more items will only decrease the effect. It's not possible to keep only four items."

Zhao Xu looked directly at the other person and asked, "Can't you just keep making items appear on your body?"

The deformed man couldn't help but smile wryly and said, "It seems that the spellcasters in your world are very interested in exploiting loopholes. Unfortunately, when those items decompose and disappear, their polluted aura will cling to you, so unless you leave the polluted environment, any new items you create will be treated as the fifth item and have no effect."

"Therefore, adventurers in our world must eventually leave the polluted environment, regardless of the outcome."

"However, don't worry, I have a way to survive. As long as you continuously recite the prayer of Ra Laye, attracting new travelers, you can use someone's body as a sacrifice to obtain protection for a certain period of time."

As he spoke, the deformed man revealed a sly smile. "Since the last boat that accidentally approached this place about four months ago, there hasn't been any new people. I thought I wouldn't last for a few more days, but who knew?"

"This time, I'll offer a spellcaster, and the immortal old man will definitely protect me for a season!"

As he spoke, the deformed alchemist directly raised his staff!
