Chapter 318: Countdown to Zero

After feeling a strange sensation in his body, Zhao Xu left the concert venue early, without a second thought about the half-used ticket he had bought.

Zhao Xu didn't expect that after Zheng Xin Yun recited the prayer mantra he had given her, the resonance would suddenly amplify to a certain extent, and he would even feel a palpable connection.

The sensation was like an invisible chain connecting them, with his heartbeats in sync with hers. If Zhao Xu maintained this extraordinary connection, he might even be able to locate her position and sense her state.

Even just a fleeting moment of spiritual energy could make him feel the changes in Zheng Xin Yun's mental state.

The mystery of this spiritual energy left Zhao Xu startled, even though he had never experienced it before.

Later, Zheng Xin Yun stopped reciting the prayer mantra, and the connection gradually weakened and broke off. This was also related to her own energy deficiency.

Initially, Zhao Xu estimated that the probability of Zheng Xin Yun entering the game was only 30%.
However, after this unexpected encounter, the probability increased to at least 50%.

When Zheng Xin Yun finally recited the prayer mantra, Zhao Xu was convinced that she would eventually enter the game.

At this point, Zhao Xu stood at the entrance of the subway station, watching the train leave without him. He took a deep breath and walked calmly onto the next train, finding a quiet spot to sit and close his eyes, lost in thought.

In the instant when his spiritual energy was activated, he had a faint understanding of the energy portal.

Regrettably, he is not in the world of Arthur at this moment, and all his thoughts can only be roughly simulated in his mind.

However, Zhao Xu's goal is to achieve real communication between two worlds at a crucial juncture.

In the past, Zhao Xu could only rely on basic magical skills and had no idea about manipulating things. However, after his true intelligence increased to a sufficient level, some challenges were no longer a challenge for him.

Especially when Anniya took him to that mysterious research facility and showed him the eight large silver metal panels with intricate incantations carved on them. This had already revealed a huge secret to him, allowing him to stand directly on the shoulders of countless giants.

This enabled Zhao Xu to think from his own dimension, considering the probability of various hidden possibilities.

As long as the Association successfully opened the material channel, he could sit back and enjoy the fruits of his labor, achieving "sneak passage."

Zhao Xu's nature did not want to rely on Arthur's magical items to influence the Earth before crossing over.

He was driven by an instinctual desire to seek more secure bottom lines for himself.

This sudden disconnection has already made Zhao Xu realize the butterfly effect he could produce.

Especially, the effect is the amplification of Arthur's influence on the real world. Hundreds of millions of Arthur players in the past two days have completely changed their trajectory.

So Zhao Xu is more worried about the influence on the real world.

He is well aware that his death in Arthur is not a true death, as he has too many bottom lines to salvage.

However, his death on Earth will truly cause him to cease to exist.

Just as Zhao Xu's thoughts were racing, he suddenly heard someone nearby discussing this game, "Arthur".

"Shouldn't we be able to connect tomorrow?"

"Yeah, it's definitely possible. I've been playing this hardcore game and I've finally started to invest all my energy."

"You're just throwing your money away."

"Ah, this game, it's not worth throwing money at. Right now, I'm worried that I've spent a huge sum of money to get something, and then someone else can just get it easily. That would be devastating."

"Well, isn't it said that the strongest profession isn't mage or priest?"

"I know that, but once my equipment is strong enough, I won't be afraid of anyone."

At this point, Zhao Xu finally opened his eyes and looked at the source of the sound.

The person who wanted to buy equipment was a tall and lean man with a smug expression on his face.
A younger man standing beside him was subtly trying to reason with him, clearly they were teammates.

"Not at all, you're using mage-made magical items to counter mages, that's just ridiculous," the younger man retorted.

This sentence immediately elicited a sarcastic response from the tall and lean man, "What nonsense."

The younger man also shot back with a witty remark, and the voices gradually grew louder.
The two of them started to argue back and forth, word by word, like a debate.
Zhao Xu didn't pay attention to it after listening to a few sentences, and he automatically converted the sound into background noise and blocked it out.

In his opinion, any attempt to persuade others to change their behavior was foolish.
Especially online, he had never seen anyone succeed in persuading others through a keyboard debate, making the other person convinced and satisfied.
In any debate, there was always a self-justifying logic.
Here is the translation of the text:

However, he himself is the perspective of a young man standing there.

Arthur has a special place, which is that he is not like other online games with a "blacksmith" role, except that the basic weapons and armor are forged by the blacksmith.

All magical items are, in essence, sourced from certain spells.

Therefore, Arthur's "magical items" and "curios" are, in essence, products of the spellcaster.

As for the warriors, in the later stages, they want to get along with the spellcasters, and except for the need for strong support from advanced professions, about seven or eight parts rely on a large number of powerful magical items.

Therefore, if both sides give up magical items, the essence is that the war-based professions are weakened to a greater extent.

Just the "flight" spell with three rings is enough to defeat most warriors.

Zhao Xu initially hoped that there would be enough spellcasters among players, so that later, everyone would not be too passive when crossing into the world.

After crossing, he wanted to become a wizard, but that would require accumulating for over ten years.

From online statistics and the current adventure activities he has participated in, Arthur currently has 11 basic professions, with an average of about 9% for each profession.

However, in reality, the number of wizard players in the current player base is less than 1%.

In general, it is rare to see a wizard role in a four-person team, and even in the current high-end team of 40 people, it is only possible to have two or three wizards at best.

The current part of the warrior profession is holding onto the attitude of that high and thin man.

On the one hand, it is underestimated the difficulty of obtaining magical items, except for Zhao Xu.

On the other hand, it is overestimated its effect.
Here is the translation of the text:

The mage can be restrained in what way, and the magical items can be restrained in what way. Magical items are essentially simulations of certain spells. From this perspective, as a mage, the essence is even more direct.

The commotion between the two people made the passengers in the carriage furrow their brows, and some fellow players who were also playing as Arthur tried to intervene, but were rebuffed. Meanwhile, Zhao Xu had been editing a post on his phone throughout, titled "Practical Introduction to Magical Items".

He first quoted some sentences from their argument, organized the logical issues, and explained them one by one. Then he began to review and recommend some useful magical items from Arthur, recommending them to players.

The first time he wrote this post was like building a castle in the air, just like he is writing a post introducing his character. By now, the game has reached the early stage of the third month, and many top players have obtained magical items worth several thousand gold coins, which is the stage where this post can start to take effect.

As he arrived at his destination station, Zhao Xu let out a sigh of relief, stood up, and walked towards the slowly opening gate outside, while clicking the "send" button on the editing interface of the phone forum.

"You're being unreasonable, let's go ask the Big God," said the young man with a flushed face.

"Okay, isn't the most famous one in the forum that East City Rong? I'll post on him, let's see who's right."

The East City Rong account on the forum, although recently leaning towards mage-related posts.
Here is the translation of the text:

However, the content published by the account itself is factual and has been verified by players, so even if it's a warrior who is known for their exaggeration, this account is still considered credible. Therefore, even a young man who is slender and good at magic is not opposed to asking questions.

Just as Zhao Xu was about to cancel the post, he suddenly felt his phone slip out of his hand. He hastily tried to delete the post, but the delay had already been restored to normal.

In an instant, numerous self-media accounts and platforms linked to Zhao Xu instantly reposted his post.

Even if Zhao Xu deleted the post, it had already been disseminated to over a dozen places, and would continue to increase as time passed.

Zhao Xu could only shake his head, unable to believe that he had been so quickly caught off guard.

However, he didn't dwell on it and instead accelerated his pace to leave the subway station.

The two people who were arguing about who was right or wrong were also stunned, gazing at the latest post from Dong Chengli on the forum.

The "Q&A" section at the beginning of the post seemed to be a direct hit, making the slender man's face turn red and white.

At the same time, a few players in the car received the push notification and were also stunned, scanning the entire car to try to find out who was responsible.

Zhao Xu passed by a small eatery on his way back and picked up a takeaway dinner to bring back to his roommate.

When he returned to the dormitory, he found that Zhang Qi was already wearing a helmet and playing another game with his girlfriend, extending their meeting time after 11 pm.

This rare downtime for Arthur also restored the lively atmosphere of playing online games in the dormitory.
Here is the translation of the text:

Even some dormitories directly restored to their original state, pulling out two cards to play tractor-trailer.

All of this could only wait until tomorrow morning at 10:00 to restore to its original state.

After washing up, Zhao Xu went to bed early.

However, due to long-term habits, he still put on his helmet, preparing to enter the immersive sleep mode.

After putting on the helmet, the interface in front of Zhao Xu immediately switched back to the interface he removed the helmet from the previous day.

In front of the login countdown interface that disconnected from the network.

At this moment, most players around the world are counting down to 9:55:45.

However, Zhao Xu discovered that the countdown in front of him had changed to 00:00:00.
