Chapter 268: The Truth Fragment

"Uh?" Larkspur was taken aback by Zhao Xu's words, "Lord, are we still on the same frequency?"

"No, Larkspur." At this moment, Zhao Xu's entire consciousness was extremely clear. "This is an issue that requires the power of an organization to maintain the secrets of the 'Magic Goddess.'"

"The leader of the organization itself is still the leader of the strongest Magic Association on this continent, and among them, the legendary magicians are numbered in tens. So, the problem has already arisen - this scroll should not exist with a back door."

Zhao Xu was muttering to himself as he thought to Larkspur.

"The first two times, I entered the projection space of the scroll through that mysterious room. In fact, I was taking a shortcut, so I didn't realize the problem. But now, we have to consume all our 'magic points' to make ourselves extremely weak, and then hide in a 'magic immunity' to avoid the magical shock."

Zhao Xu's palm began to feel warm at this moment, and Larkspur was also deep in thought, "Lord, you mean that this method is not only cumbersome but also consumes magic points and enters the anti-magic field, which is too dangerous. So, this entrance method is not the original back door."

"No, it's not." At this moment, Zhao Xu's eyes seemed to be shining with a faint light, "It's possible that even the first room was a later discovery of a loophole!"
Here is the translation of the text to English:

"These vulnerabilities are the means for accessing the 'Final Scroll' space, and the organization needs to block and eliminate them. Zhao Xuankuan explained, "It's just a temporary measure to allow low-level mages to enter the scroll space as well." After Zhao Xuankuan's explanation, Lakis immediately grasped the essence of the event. However, new doubts arose, "What about the order of succession? What is the order of succession?" Zhao Xuankuan's face lit up with confidence, "It's the order of succession of the 'Final Scroll'." "Legendary mages will not do something as reckless as this. After Anniya mentioned the heir, I realized that each member of the scroll space is an heir of the 'Scroll'. However, it's not as simple as saying that whoever has a higher level is higher in succession." "So, the 'Final Scroll' is selecting the most capable people who can maintain it, which is also why we use such a laborious method to preserve it." "Only those who are clear about how to crack it can best preserve it and protect it from being infiltrated." After listening to this, Lakis finally understood Zhao Xuankuan's thought process. "So, to master the 'Final Scroll' in the future, we need to become the ones who find the most vulnerabilities?" Lakis thought to himself, and his head began to spin. "It's not just that, the one who is first in succession will be the next candidate for the God of Magic?" Lakis suddenly imagined this. "Lakis, do you know the secret of the 'Final Scroll'?" Zhao Xuankuan thought of Lakis's incredible strength and asked curiously. Who knew that Lakis immediately rejected this, "This matter should be asked of the great emperor Ernest. The only certain thing is that a few points are certain."
Here is the translation of the text:

"Recording all magical arts that have ever appeared in history is just one of the most ordinary functions of the 'Final Scroll'. Even the secrets of the 'God of Magic' at the highest level are not the greatest depth of the 'Final Scroll'."

"It is said----" suddenly Lacis fell into a state of repetition, repeating the word "It is said----" over and over again.

"Ah, Lacis!" Zhao Xu shouted loudly, suddenly waking Lacis from her trance-like state.

"Too terrifying! Even if it's over tens of thousands of years, the legacy left by the King of Ofa will still be unavoidable."

"You were just influenced?" Zhao Xu said cautiously.

"No, I wasn't," Lacis replied, her tone tinged with fear. "This technique was specifically designed for us, the Spirit Beings, to prevent someone from exploiting the 'Backdoor' and directly obtaining the 'Final Scroll'."

"I was just caught up in it," Lacis said.

As soon as Zhao Xu heard this, he couldn't help but ask for more details.

Instantly, the whole magical vibration stopped, and the door in front of Zhao Xu suddenly swung open, interrupting their conversation.

Next, Zhao Xu did the same thing as before, repeatedly recording the three-ring magic, including the three-ring divine magic he had not yet reached.

This time, Zhao Xu finally comprehended the true meaning of the magic after recording it from start to finish.

He experienced the mysteries of the magic model and transformed it into his own magic accumulation.

As Zhao Xu recorded, he began to touch on the "Expanded Magic" within the three-ring magic.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

"These three-ring spells, it's really a new world has begun." Zhao Xu looked very contemplative.

At first, Zhao Xu remembered those powerful three-ring magic spells, but most of them were actually just core spells.

Now that he has received additional support in the aspect of expansion, the possibilities he can have are several times more.

At this moment, Zhao Xu is constantly seizing every second of time to strive to grasp those spells as quickly as possible.

After he became a 5th-level mage, he possessed one three-ring spell slot from the mage school and one from the intelligence school.

Combining the two, these two three-ring spell slots will be the main force of Zhao Xu in the future.

However, at this moment, Zhao Xu still furrowed his brows.

Compared to the "same frequency" when he relied on the "unbridled hero's spirit", Zhao Xu's performance when casting spells was extravagant and rare in the world.

Some spells, he even simulated directly using the "miracle technique", skipping many preparation processes.

But now that he has returned to his original state, he has to start rebuilding his calculations.

"Hey, boss, this is the norm for mages, you know." Lakis teased Zhao Xu's thoughts, saying, "But don't worry too much about the battery life, I can help you compensate for the lack in this area."

After learning magic to a later stage, Zhao Xu knew he would soon leave, and his thoughts began to focus on the "Half-Plane of the God of Death".
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu is currently in this virtual space, where he has obtained all the simulated functions of "law" and can directly simulate the three-ring spell "Insight Battle Law". Instantly, he has set up a sensing network, covering an area of 30 meters in radius, where anyone who casts a spell will be detected instantly. He can even automatically identify the spell and judge its effects without needing to visually perceive it. Under the influence of this spell, no one can secretly cast a spell in front of him.

However, after casting this spell, Zhao Xu suddenly sensed some subtle changes in this space. He seemed to notice the discordant parts of this space. Zhao Xu immediately looked at the model of the "Insight Battle Law" spell and began to silently calculate and simulate it.

After casting this spell, he seemed to possess a spell radar. Even during the continuous process of the radar, he could automatically counter the enemy's spell in exchange for ending this spell. Throughout the 10-minute process, Zhao Xu was in a state of high calculation.

At this time, the chip in the headgear he was wearing began to work at a higher frequency, synchronizing with Zhao Xu's thinking and increasing in amplitude. Slowly, he entered the warning zone. Just as Zhao Xu's brain-computer headgear was about to reach its maximum heat capacity and might cut off the connection due to overheating, he suddenly jerked his entire body.

The simulated "Insight Battle Law" spell also disappeared synchronously. Then, Zhao Xu directly walked to a point 6 meters behind him and stretched out his hand to grab something in mid-air.

【Adventurer Zhong Xia, you have identified a "Fragments of Spell Truth" in the "Final Scroll" virtual space.】
Here is the translation of the text:

"Lakshmi, you just dug deeper into the secrets without any preparation," Zhang Xu said, looking incredulous.

"This shard can be exchanged for the harvest, just think about it in your mind," Lakshmi replied.

Zhang Xu heard this and began to manifest the fragments that appeared in his mind.

["Adventurer Zhongxia, you can decipher the secrets of the Eight Great Factions. Please select three factions to manifest first."]
"Change, Defense, Prophecy," Zhang Xu directly chose these three factions.

Instantly, three pieces of information appeared in his mind.

["Change: Expertise in 'Simulating Supernatural Abilities'"]
["Defense: Expertise in 'Iron Heart Martial Arts'"]
["Prophecy: Expertise in 'Mage Mastery'"]
["Adventurer Zhongxia, you can obtain the ability of one of the selected factions."]
"This iron heart martial arts is a mess, how can it be related to the nine sword system?" Zhang Xu frowned and said.

"Don't worry about it!" Lakshmi exclaimed, her eyes shining with excitement.

"This trio of abilities, except for the prophecy which is slightly weaker, the 'Simulating Supernatural Abilities' and 'Iron Heart' are all top-notch abilities of King Arthur!"
