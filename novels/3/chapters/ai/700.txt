Chapter 701: Power of Brushing

Just after Zhao Xu entered the opponent's anti-magic zone, he used the "Iron Heart's Power" to instantaneously dispel the zone. However, he found himself unexpectedly sucked into his own anti-magic zone.

Before he could react, he felt an immense and profound power emanating from all around him, gradually enveloping his entire body.

What's going on? Is the master of the deep abyss attacking me?

Although demons are notorious for breaking their promises, this sudden change of heart was unprecedented.

Zhao Xu was about to mock his opponent, but he suddenly discovered a familiar sensation.

He turned around with a look of surprise, his eyes fixed on a pool of grayish mud forming a circular pit at the edge of the cliff, flowing down from the peak and converging at the valley bottom.

It was the transmission portal of the deep abyss!

Zhao Xu didn't expect to fall into a transmission portal, and his anti-magic zone had failed to block the portal.

Suddenly, he felt himself being pulled into the abyss like a drowning person.

The demon lord's whirlpool-like face was also stretched across a distance, gazing at the ripples in the mud pool.

"It's a random transmission portal, what can I do?" the demon lord muttered to himself.

Saying that, the demon lord silently began to spread his awareness, gradually enveloping the transmission portal.

In the deep abyss, only another demon lord could save someone from the demon lord's grasp.

Countless adventurers who had offended the demon lord had successfully escaped or left the abyss, relying on exploiting the demon lord's contradictions.

"What's strange?" Zhao Xu wondered. "Is there another level that Ocus didn't know about?"
Here is the translation of the text:

"Is there a place like this at the bottom of the abyss?"

"That can't be the rumored place, can it?"

"...Where is this place again?"

Zhao Xu furrowed his brows as he gazed at the dark surroundings, which were as black as ink. At this moment, his True Knowledge Art was exerting its full effect, and he could even feel the warmth emanating from his eyes.

However, the darkness caused by the magic spell had not taken effect at all.

Zhao Xu continued to take out a "Non-Extinguishable Torch" from his dimensional bag, which could maintain its brightness forever.

But as soon as he took it out, the darkness around him swallowed it up, even more swiftly than a raging storm.

"Daylight Art!"

Zhao Xu didn't say another word and cast the three-ring spell.

The three-ring spell was only used for its flashlight effect, which was equivalent to daytime levels. Similarly, the "Darkness Art" with three rings could counteract it.

Magic light and magic darkness were like east wind and west wind, with whoever had the higher ring count prevailing. Therefore, they could also be used to counteract each other.

However, as the magical energy surged out of the Non-Extinguishable Torch in Zhao Xu's hand, it did not produce the brilliant light he had imagined.

The answer was already clear: there was a more powerful magic darkness surrounding him.

It had swallowed up all the low-ring magical light.

But if this dark place did exist in the rumored location, why couldn't his True Knowledge Art see through it?

Magic wouldn't deceive people.

This could only mean that this darkness had a deeper and more profound origin, one that could bend the rules of magic.

A deep doubt was thus buried in Zhao Xu's heart.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

The next second, he regained his composure and continued to retrieve the endless scroll box of magic items from his hand. As he thought about it, he pulled out a scroll he had been wanting - the radiant glory.

This was the ninth-level spell of the domain of honor and the profession of wizard. It was a massive area of effect, with a radius of 600 meters, centered on himself, and could affect an area 30 meters in diameter at each level. The spell would radiate a brilliant and dazzling light, like a shooting star, illuminating the entire area.

Moreover, as a sealed ninth-level spell, it was impossible to dispel or counter with any dark magic. The light would also cause all evil creatures within the area to become blinded, with no exception or resistance.

This was the key skill Zhao Xuan had originally used in the depths of the underworld to easily defeat those evil demons and make them become blind soldiers. However, now, the light of the spell flickered weakly, like a firefly, and then went out instantly, as if blown away by a strong gust of wind.

Zhao Xuan began to feel the helplessness of this situation.

The initial sense of accomplishment he felt when he obtained the sixth-level ring and the 3rd-level spell shield at level 11 had long since faded away. As he delved deeper into the underworld, he was constantly hit with blows to his confidence and faith in magic.

This was a horror beyond his imagination.

Even the ninth-level light spell could not dispel it, and the final result was already a foregone conclusion.

Where was he now?

Zhao Xuan thought to himself as he pulled out the Face Six-Fold Compass from his pocket, followed the instructions on the manual, and frowned as he read.
Based on the available evidence, he is still trapped in the depths.

What kind of effects does the layer of the depths have?

Zhao Xu thought back to it silently.

Like the endless labyrinth on the 600th floor, the corridors there are filled with twisted corridors and trap corners, connecting other layers of the labyrinthine area through endless corridors. The interior walls are made of ivory-white marble, granite, and slate.

The 570th floor of Shadira is ruled by the demon king Mephisto, and it looks like a heavenly paradise. Zhao Xu saw the painting of that layer, with the blue-green land divided into small blocks by mountains, and the bottom of the sea rich in treasures, dyed red by the eternal sunset, and not a single black spot.

Some areas even have the feature of time slowing down.

However, no matter how you look at it, it seems to have no connection to the current layer.

"This is where?" Zhao Xu thought to himself, muttering to himself.

"A place of prayer."

Suddenly, a cold and mechanical response came from behind the void.

Zhao Xu turned his head sharply, but there was no one there.

He tried to repeat the question, "Where?"

"A place of prayer."

The voice was still cold, and even the pause and pronunciation were consistent.

Zhao Xu even doubted that the one behind was a computer connected to a speaker, playing the sentence fixedly.

"What is a place of prayer?"

Since the puppet master wants to play with him, he will play along to the end.

"It's a place where you can fulfill any wish you propose, no matter how difficult it is to fulfill."

Is it really as it says?

Zhao Xu listened, with some ideas getting lost in his mind.

The 25,000-gold "Prayer Scroll" was just ignored?
Here is the translation of the text:

As long as I'm standing on this land, can I?

Zhao Xu scratched his head and muttered, "Give me a giant demon bull."

Suddenly, a towering figure strode across the cursed land, causing a tremor.

In front of Zhao Xu, a dark figure began to take shape, its every step causing the ground to shake. The monster's arms were thicker than ancient tree trunks, and its owner, a demonic bull-headed creature, glared at the sky with an evil grin.

The creature slowly approached Zhao Xu, moving with its limbs awkwardly, as if it were a large ape the size of a house.

This was a giant demon bull, a deep-level demon that challenged 16th-level players. It was a formidable beast that could be found on the battlefield, and it was also the favorite of the demon lords.

It was said that giant demon bulls could appear anywhere in the abyss, but Zhao Xu and Anniya had previously focused on this demon when planning their expedition to the abyss.

It was common to find these demons in the endless labyrinth at level 600 and the steel wasteland at level 23.

Was Zhao Xu lucky enough to find a giant demon bull in this "Wish-Granting Land"? Or had it been conjured up out of thin air?

Zhao Xu felt a hint of excitement.

Couldn't he use this opportunity to complete his "Extraction Ritual" plan, which he had been silent about for a while?

The first step of this project was to find a demon with the best basic attributes. In reality, the giant demon bull had a basic power of 34 points, while the Balroth demon had 35 points, a small difference.
Here is the translation of the text:

The key point is that this enormous beast, the giant bull demon, can still plan for a super-giant type. While the Balroth demon has already transcended to the super-large scale, its enhanced attributes will be counteracted.

Gazing at the giant bull demon lifting its high leg, preparing to shake the ground with all its might. If it really unleashes its power, it would definitely be the effect of the Eight-Ring Earthquake Technique.

But Zhao Xu didn't want to play along with the opponent anymore, and directly said, "Make this thing disappear." He hadn't even finished speaking when the giant bull demon suddenly turned into a faint mist and disappeared into thin air.

However, Zhao Xu's prayer rhythm didn't stop immediately, and he continued to shout, "Give me a giant bull demon of this type!"

"Boom!"

A massive sound echoed, as if the entire night had been torn apart. The ground trembled with a powerful aftershock, no less intense than before.

At this point, the giant bull demon, which had already reached a super-giant size, jumped up two levels, with each level boosting its strength by 8 points. The overall base strength directly reached 34 + 16 = 50 points.

According to the opponent's current +20 adjustment value, it has already gained 10 points of strength.

This has already surpassed the magic items on the market, and doesn't occupy any equipment slot.

However, this giant bull demon didn't look like it was going to take things lying down. It immediately let out a mighty roar, and with a flick of its hand, it picked up a giant boulder, intending to hurl it at Zhao Xu.

Zhao Xu, however, only raised an eyebrow slightly.

He sensed that originally, he should have completed the "Extraction Rite" ritual with Anzhi's help.

But looking at it now, it seemed that this prayer site had just fulfilled his wishes?
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhaoxu, who had always been like a try-out for whether he could grant wishes, gradually discovered the strength of this place and began to want to utilize it. It's like using the eight-ring high-level dimensional binding spell to enslave monsters due to the limitations of the life dice, but it didn't work naturally. But someone took over, so he didn't have to worry about it. Zhaoxu directly sneaked up and said, "Let this giant ox demon enter a state of shock." Sure enough, the giant ox demon's movements immediately became stiff and uncoordinated, like it was being controlled by force to become a rag doll.

It was extremely difficult for the giant ox demon to twist its head to look at Zhaoxu, with its eyes flashing with anger and a burning gaze, as if it wanted to tear Zhaoxu apart on the spot. But Zhaoxu didn't care about these things. He directly began to prepare the "Extraction Ritual" magic ritual. He started building two magic arrays on the ground, with one array's position exactly where the giant ox demon was standing. Relying on his experimental habits, Zhaoxu first arranged the entire scene.

When the time came, he would only need to recite a spell to extract enough demonic essence mist from the giant ox demon. No matter what, it would be able to significantly enhance his powers. The key question now is how to make the giant ox demon's attributes rise to the valley.

"Grant the giant ox demon a 6-time power boost."

Zhaoxu silently commanded the land beneath his feet, consecutively performing six wish-granting rituals to boost the internal attributes. This also counted as the opponent's job. Therefore, the giant ox demon flashed six divine lights, and its entire body's muscle strength increased significantly.

"Put a +12 cow energy belt on this giant ox demon."
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu continued to instruct, "One legendary magical item with a +12 attribute, theoretically, is the pinnacle of current technology, can be considered a real magical item, and not just Zhao Xu's nonsense. If not, he would directly ask for a waist belt with 100 strength, and take a complete step, and exaggerate it by taking away all the bull-like magical power, leaving only 1 point. The bull-like magical power also actually has a thick, rough waist belt appear in its abdominal position, making it look even more like the appearance of the Ox King. Zhao Xu smiled secretly in his heart.

Then, this place will come up with some new tricks, which is also a request from the "bull-like magical power" itself. He will use the "Extraction Ritual" to extract the true strength of the bull-like magical power, not the one given by the deep layer of the Underworld.

So, there is a debt to be repaid.

It's like a woman taking out 10,000 yuan from an ATM, but getting 20,000 yuan in return. The woman takes 10,000 yuan and leaves the rest 10,000 yuan at the scene. Later, the bank informs her that the 10,000 yuan she took is the bank's, and the 10,000 yuan left is hers.

"Put a higher divine face on the bull-like magical power," Zhao Xu continued to instruct.

Zhao Xu gave himself a blessing, according to his benevolent nature, and transformed into a semi-celestial being.

The bull-like magical power, on the other hand, continued to exhibit its internal semi-hellish form, and most importantly, provided Zhao Xu with a 4-point increase in unknown strength.

Then, Zhao Xu patted his chest and cast another spell - Three Rings, Natural Balance.

Instantly, a blue glow representing life force appeared on Zhao Xu's chest, and then directly entered the internal body of the bull-like magical power. As a trade-off, Zhao Xu suffered a 4-point reduction in strength, agility, and constitution, but the target living being will gain the same increase.
At this moment, the giant ox demon has already reached 34+16 (physical body) + 6 (inner wish) + 12 (waist belt) + 4 (natural balance) + 4 (higher god's appearance) = 76 points!
It can transfer a total of 16 points of power to him!
