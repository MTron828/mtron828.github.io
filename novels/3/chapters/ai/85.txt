Chapter 086: Curse

The entire team looked confused when they heard the name "Dī Mó Gāo Gēn". Although they had heard the name before, they couldn't help but feel a chill run down their spines.

However, none of them had any recollection of who this person was or what kind of entity he was.

The poet, Qing Wa, whispered softly, "Search failed. Perhaps this person doesn't exist. It's just a meaningless word."

Zhao Xu frowned, and his search results were the same.

He had never heard of the name "Dī Mó Gāo Gēn" even in the ancient records of the seal war.

However, he had paid special attention to the contents of magic in the floating city, including information about demons and devils.

He had seen the name "Dī Mó Gāo Gēn" before - the Lord of the Abyss, the Great King of Demons.

At the time, he had asked An Ti Niya about it, but she had lightly mocked him, calling him a split-personality monkey.

However, An Ti Niya had also given him a brief introduction to the abilities of "Dī Mó Gāo Gēn".

Thinking about this, Zhao Xu took a deep breath.

In the material plane of Arthur, "Dī Mó Gāo Gēn" had followers, and some of them even had divine powers. However, their powers came from the Abyss.

The Abyss was home to some malevolent deities, according to An Ti Niya's words. "Dī Mó Gāo Gēn", the demon king, was considered a low-ranking deity in the Abyss, but his powers were unmatched in the Abyss.

However, Anniya was very confident at the time, and Dymo Gogen dared to tread on the material plane, killing as many times as she came. As for why she died and could come back again, Zhao Xu didn't ask any further questions.

If that's the case, just mentioning the name "Dymo Gogen" might have brought attention to their small team.

It's similar to when a character in a children's fantasy novel mentions a mysterious person, and the other party becomes aware of it.

Zhao Xu wasn't worried that Dymo Gogen wouldn't be bored and summon the hidden sect in Arthur's private lesson to surround them. He was afraid that there might be some hidden tricks or something in the mine or the underground city.

As they were being watched, the team decided to go and observe the altar.

"It's the mark of evil," Yu Yu said, looking at the altar, with a split-tailed pattern on the tabletop.

When they heard this, everyone's originally relaxed mood was rekindled.

As for evil spirits, it was still a matter of mutual consent, and it was hard to shake off the feeling of fear.

"Destroy it?" Luo Ya asked, having never encountered such a thing before.

In their daily lives in the town, they would usually seek the help of clergy from the righteous gods, which would also increase their reputation.

But now, they were far away and powerless to do anything, and all they could do was report it afterwards.

"Okay." The room was filled with the name written in blood red, which made Feng Ye feel uneasy and frustrated, but he didn't release his anger.

He directly raised the giant sword in his hand, ready to strike at the altar.

"Wait," Zhao Xu said hastily, "Let's search for any traps first."

Feng Ye heard this and quickly backed away a few steps.
Here is the translation of the text:

Although he had not experienced the traps in the underground castle before, this thing had already gained a notorious reputation on the forum, with unknown numbers of players killed by it.

"Right, Hill, go take a look," said Luo Ya after hearing this sentence, knowing that he was influenced by the oppressive environment of the room and hadn't reacted quickly enough.

Hill and the player, Rainbow, approached the altar to check if there were any traps around it.

Searching is not a skill that requires training, but anyone with normal intelligence can do it. However, only those with the profession of Wanderer can search out those high-difficulty traps.

After checking, both of them shook their heads, indicating that they didn't find anything.

"That's enough, let's disperse," said Zhao Xu, who didn't say much, but added a cautious remark.

"Lisu's orders," said Luo Ya, instructing them.

The others retreated a few meters, leaving only Maple Leaf and Luo Ya in front of the altar.

Luo Ya held up his shield, ready to defend, and actually shot a few arrows from inside the altar. He could also block them.

Maple Leaf took a deep breath and directly raised his massive sword to strike the altar.

"Boom," the earth shook.

The altar, which had been abandoned for dozens or even hundreds of years, was broken open by Maple Leaf with one stroke.

"Ahh—"
Immediately after the altar broke open, a yellow light flashed, and Maple Leaf let out a tragic cry.

"What's wrong with you, Maple Leaf?" Wanderer Rainbow rushed over and pulled the already kneeling Maple Leaf to the back.

The originally strong warrior Maple Leaf was now sweating with his forehead, gasping for air, and said, "My physical attribute has been deducted by six points."
"Has he been cursed?" Zhao Xu reacted quickly.

When he heard this, everyone looked at each other in shock. Luo Ya, who was still holding his shield, took a few steps back after hearing this.
Here is the translation of the text:

It seemed as if the altar that had been shattered was smiling mockingly. "Brother Maple Leaf?" Maple Leaf's sister-in-law came over quickly to observe Maple Leaf's condition, and among the people present, only she had medical skills. When Zhao Xu heard the words "six attributes," he immediately understood what had happened.

Fortunately, Maple Leaf was only injured in terms of attributes.

"How many points of physical constitution do you have left?" Zhao Xu asked, bending down.

"I only have 8 points left. I originally had 14 points of physical constitution, but now it's been adjusted to -1," Maple Leaf said, panting.

After adjusting physical constitution, the most direct impact is on Maple Leaf's life value.

"Don't worry, Maple Leaf, these attributes will recover just like before," Yu Yu comforted.

Zhao Xu shook his head, "This should be a curse."

At this moment, everyone looked at him, and the highest-level Lu Ya suddenly had a bad association.

"A curse is a third-level divine spell of a priest and a fourth-level arcane spell of a mage. It has three effects, one of which is to reduce an attribute by six points," Zhao Xu explained, "Just now, it's likely that a magic trap was triggered when Maple Leaf struck the altar."

Everyone was shocked that the altar still had a hidden trick.

This is also the tricky part of a magic trap. Unless there's an unexpected event, it can last for hundreds of years without decaying, unlike ordinary traps that would decay over time.

Zhao Xu looked at the place where the altar had been broken, but there were no obvious signs on the back wall.

However, he was certain that there was something unusual, as ordinary people would not set up traps in an altar without a reason.

"If it's a curse, the continuous effect is permanent," Yu Yu said with a pale face.
Here is the translation:

As soon as this was said, everyone in the scene couldn't help but shudder.

It's forever reduced by 6 constitution points, which is really possible to delete and come back.

It's just the Maple Leaf Warrior profession, where the 1st-level life die can take the full 10 points of D10.

If it's a 10-constitution D4 life die mage who takes it, their life value will directly become 1 HP, and they'll collapse to the ground just from being accidentally touched.

Zhao Xu gazed at the magical trap under the altar, and it seemed that the ordinary trick he had taken out when facing the Druid earlier and then put back away was now about to be put into use – the thing he had taken out in front of the Druid earlier and then put back away.
