Chapter 706: Self-Projection

This question seemed to pierce his heart like a sharp knife, pinning down everything Zhao Xu had just heard.

"Answer me?" Zhao Xu asked, emphasizing his words.

The momentary silence was broken by the old man's voice, which was stuck in his throat, unable to utter a single word. His entire body began to melt away like wax, as if resisting Zhao Xu's slightest intention.

It was as if Zhao Xu's willpower had not even begun to stir.

Uh?

I just didn't cast the "Wishful Thinking" spell, did I?

And I didn't think about your death, either?

Zhao Xu raised his head with a deep sense of doubt.

In an instant, the sky and the void began to evolve, like a perfect oil painting, with new colors being continuously added. A new painter's brushstrokes were added, and the colors blended together, writing the final chapter of life.

Four unknowns, and then, with increasing precision, Zhao Xu saw the clue.

Stars appeared, the sun and moon appeared, mountains appeared, time appeared, and life appeared...

All of these things seemed to be created by him, as if he were the creator, with everything interwoven in the void and chaos.

I'm asking this world, or is this world asking me?

Zhao Xu saw himself and saw himself in his own eyes.

This Zhuang Zhou-like dream, where the butterfly dreams of Zhuang Zhou, was a mere illusion.

This was his innermost sentiment at this moment.

The next second, he realized that someone had appeared behind him, and his heart skipped a beat as he took a closer look, breaking the current train of thought and tranquility.

It also made him wake up from this impossible miracle of life.

Anastasia?

What is this?
Zhao Xū fell into deeper bewilderment.

She shouldn't be here now.

Or rather, except for that deep abyss lord or the nearby observer.

At this moment, anyone appearing here is unreasonable.

She shouldn't appear here.

If this layer is indeed almost time-stopped, then the time they've spent here in the outside world might not even reach a few seconds.

Even if Anxinyue wants to go back to find Zhao Xū, she would have to use the transmission technique to return to the initial disappearance point, then use the divine technique to gradually unfold the entire transmission process of Zhao Xū.

Zhao Xū's transmission time, which was previously a few hours, has now become an obstacle to rescue.

At the same time, even if Anxinyue really finds the location where Zhao Xū disappeared, she would have to analyze the transmission doors one by one.

Even legendary magic would have to be smashed out without spending a penny, and during this time, she would have to ensure that she is not disturbed.

It's not worth thinking about; the deep abyss lord who let Zhao Xū fall into his trap is definitely waiting for him outside the world, and this time scale might stretch on for thousands or even hundreds of years.

After all, an immortal deep abyss lord has plenty of time to waste.

Therefore, Anxinyue cannot find the direction of Zhao Xū's disappearance in just three or five days.

Moreover, she would need to possess a path to the "bottomless domain".

A very magical "Deep Abyss Chronicle" is placed here, and Anxinyue cannot help but wonder, but she ultimately did not reach here.

It can only be said that she cannot do it either.
Here is the translation of the text:

Including Zhao Xu, without this teleportation gate, without the identity of the Overlord of the Abyss, without the dark aura of the Black Tome, he is still a fool with his eyes wide open.

Even more seriously,

After Anzhiya completed all her tasks, in her concept, it's possible that she is in the deepest layer of the Abyss, a bottomless realm.

It has been millions of years.

This is a brutal judgment that is almost as cruel as a near-stopped time.

A comprehensive review of all the threads shows that the Anzhiya before him is not the true existence of her.

Is she another fake?

After casting a glance at his "True Knowledge" technique, Zhao Xu cursed, "Junk technique!" from the start, it never worked well.

He swiftly raised his "Symbolic Power Cudgel" in his hand, and his entire body slightly curved, ready to strike.

To the unknown strong ones, at this moment, his set of seven consecutive attacks becomes the greatest source of strength.

After all, this is a technique that can cause thousands of injuries, and effortlessly take away the life of a person-made god.

Zhao Xu raised an eyebrow.

"You're fake, which means the old man who claimed to be the embodiment of the bottomless realm is also fake?"

Zhao Xu shook his head in dismay.

Cut it.

He had just secretly smiled to himself, thinking that his origins were so great, and he had even created one of the three giants of King Arthur.

He even thought that in the future, he could casually call out to the gods, "Well done, little West, you've done a great job!" and not disappoint the three old men who had left them a great land.

But who could have thought that this sacrilegious era has not yet taken shape, and everything was destroyed.

Oh, what a waste of his dreams of fighting gods and kicking the spirits.

Zhao Xu looked at Anzhiya with dissatisfaction.
Here is the translation of the text:

"You're not needed to deceive me anymore, and I think that you, who has transformed into a being from the abyss, have deceived me, and it's fine. But now you're transforming into my mentor, which is really too much of a deception."

He's joking, it's meant to make people laugh, not get angry.

Zhao Xu's anger was simmering in silence.

The next moment, he seemed to hear the thunder of the void above, like his anger was being fueled by the constant rise and fall of his emotions, like a mountain range unfolding across the sky.

Zhao Xu's grip on his staff tightened, and his gaze grew sharper as he looked at the eye before him, Anzhi Noya.

Just now, his opponent had used a grand and complex creation myth to deceive him, and even let him watch the process of Asmodius, the lord of the nine hells, falling from the sky to hell.

The entire process was worthy of a blockbuster movie, and it was a pity it wasn't filmed.

If he hadn't asked why Ernest had never inherited the title of master of the abyss, the whole storyline would have been a perfect loop.

All the logic sounded flawless, with no loopholes.

It was just lacking one thing.

How could he still be acting now, as if these changes in the void were really born from his thoughts?

Unbeknownst to him, the opposite Anzhi Noya was smiling lightly, familiar to Zhao Xu.

As someone who had once spent countless nights and days together, Zhao Xu couldn't detect any inconsistencies.

"I'm not a real Anzhi Noya," he said.

"But I am Anzhi Noya."

At this moment, the girl quietly removed the cloak she had been wearing on her head, revealing her super-natural, lovely face, and her delicate and elegant posture, and her slightly raised ears, which were the only unusual feature of a half-elf, Anzhi Noya.
Here is the translation of the text:

Half-elves, being a combination of humans and elves, can be said to be the average of the two races. However, elves have a long lifespan, often taking hundreds of years to reach adulthood, and their learning process is extremely long. In contrast, human youths can begin training to become adventurers at the age of 8, and those starting at 16 are numerous. The pace of life is vastly different.

Half-elves, being between the two, may not have a very smooth life. From the elves' perspective, half-elves grow up too quickly, mature in just a few decades, and haven't had the time to learn the complex arts, cultures, and even grammar of the elves. As a result, half-elves who grew up in elven society tend to be out of place among their elven peers.

However, if half-elves grow up among humans, they may feel that they are developing too slowly, lacking the ambition of humans, and may become isolated. Nevertheless, many half-elves have successfully integrated into human society.

Half-elves have a lifespan of around 200 years, slightly shorter than that of elves, who live for over 500 years. Besides their physical appearance, which is closer to that of humans, they have many characteristics similar to those of humans.

Zhao Xu initially saw An Ti Noya's face and scolded himself for being stupid. This was because An Ti Noya was an elven name. In human society, half-elves tend to use elven names to emphasize their lineage. In elven society, however, they prefer to use human names.

Zhao Xu smiled slightly, saying, "Ah, I've figured out the existence of my mentor's race. Arthur doesn't have ten, and at least has a fistful."
Here is the translation of the text:

"The lord of the abyss can take me away from this place, and you can't do anything about it. If you don't have any foundation, it's just nonsense."

"This kind of thing is not strange at all. You know my teacher's race, and you can even read my inner thoughts. It's not a weird thing."

Zhaoyu looked at himself with a serious expression, and then activated his "spiritual shield" that he had obtained through his voter ability.

As he did so, he was still working hard to protect his mind, avoiding the gaze of those who might be observing him.

Anniya smiled slightly, revealing a familiar, cunning, and alluring smile.

"I said that, so there must be a deeper reason," she said, and then leaned in close to Zhaoyu, her hands resting on his shoulders.

At this moment, the two people were just inches apart, with their breaths visible.

Although Zhaoyu knew that the other person was fake, he still couldn't help but feel his heart racing.

"You're saying that your inner self is telling you the answer?" Anniya whispered, her fingers lightly pressing against Zhaoyu's chest, with a hint of seduction.

The alluring gaze, the intoxicating fragrance, and the whole scene made people's hearts melt and put aside all caution.

"You're lying," Zhaoyu said sternly, taking a step back immediately.

"Even if you're disguising yourself as my teacher, I won't take advantage of the situation like this," Zhaoyu said, his words firm and clear.

As for his thoughts, they were influenced by the Japanese teachers in movies, and it was definitely not his true self.

Unbeknownst to Zhaoyu, Anniya couldn't help but laugh out loud, her laughter like a silver bell ringing, and the atmosphere was pleasant.

The shocking charm emanating from her body again caught Zhaoyu's attention, and his mind was once again clouded.
Here is the translation of the text:

"The one who is me now is your inner projection, the one you imagined, Anniya. Anniya looked at Zhao Xu with a deep love and helplessness.

"'The deepest layer of the abyss is, in essence, the embodiment of your will. And the long scroll of the abyss is the crystallization of your final thought at that time.'"

"'At this moment, you are returning to here, and everything is yours, including that old man. He is just a projection of your subconscious, telling you everything that is true.'"

"'This time-stopped space, when converted to the outside world, is at least billions of years of waiting time. No one can bear the torture of this seal. Therefore, from the beginning, there was no arrangement for any living being to exist. Everything is running according to your will, including me.'"

Zhao Xu listened to Anniya's words, slightly opening his mouth.

"'You thought about your own existence after disassembling the entire world, and naturally, I appeared to satisfy your thoughts.'"

"'Just now, your subconscious doubted the existence of this layer, especially the prolonged absence of the master of the deep abyss. So you felt that this place might be a boundless domain. Your logic led you to automatically fill in the blanks. Even though you just thought that this place was another layer of the deep abyss, they will all project over without hindrance. However, those demons will be isolated.'"

"'Therefore, your thoughts projected a layerized embodiment to explain it to you.'"

"'Including the earlier prayer ground, after you entered here, you couldn't help but recall all your experiences. At this time, you remembered that you initially came here just to level up. So your will projected this prayer ground to satisfy your desire to level up.'"

Note: The text appears to be a conversation between two characters, Anniya and Zhao Xu, discussing the nature of reality, the protagonist's will, and the existence of a "prayer ground". The conversation is somewhat abstract and philosophical, and the translation may not fully capture the nuances of the original text.
Here is the translation of the text:

"It's fortunate that you didn't destroy the abyss just now, or you would have already reached the command level by now."

Zhao Xu's face turned pale.

He couldn't believe it. Was it really like this?

This wasn't what he had expected. Was everything like he had wished for? Was this the ultimate version of "Wish Art"?

Was the heavens and the earth all according to his will?

"And including the dirty thoughts in your mind right now." Anniya was enraged and began to undo the buttons on her robe, ready to fall to the ground at any moment.

"Hold on."

Zhao Xu quickly intervened.

Mom, I almost jumped into the Yellow River and couldn't wash away the shame.

He wasn't a real demon of desire.

"Can you explain it? Ernest, what happened in the past?" Zhao Xu shook his head and raised his voice.

He wouldn't give up until he got a clear answer.

It was like grasping the crucial point of a snake, no matter how many times the opponent tried to spin the story.

"This is the most critical point."

"It's simple, he came and went."

"He didn't even bother with this position." Anniya said, her eyes revealing a sense of helplessness and sadness, as if a real person was standing there.

As if time had stopped.

"Because Ernest knew he was just a temporary visitor in this segment of history, and couldn't stay long. Why bother disturbing this segment of history that shouldn't exist?"
