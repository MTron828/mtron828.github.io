Chapter 437: Target: Establish an Association

In reality, Zhao Xu should have gone to the capital of the Northern Alliance first, where he would report to the "branch headquarters" of the Wizards' Association that governs all cities in the Northern Alliance, and then have the documents sent over from the branch. However, Zhao Xu thought about An Ti Noya's words, "I'll be waiting for you at the Wizards' Association in Jieding," and decided to come over and take a look around first.

Inside the Ai Zhu Palace, Zhao Xu sensed that An Ti Noya had a subtle, hesitant attitude.

After the massacre outside the Meteorite pit, no one dared to approach him, and some people even went crazy from the aura of death emanating from his body.

During this process, Zhao Xu also felt the influence of the fragments of the God of Death's power on him, which had become completely different since Lakshmi had awakened.

The fragments of the God of Death's power began to exert a real influence on him.

Even in the darkness of night just before dawn, Vevean could subtly sense that Zhao Xu had the will of the God of Death gathering behind him.

This made Zhao Xu anxious.

However, he also felt the impact of it.

He was only seven levels away from becoming a 7th-level wizard.

Zhao Xu seemed to have walked a simple journey from Mistral to the Northern Alliance, but this experience far exceeded that of most players.

He had been tempered like a sword, and his abilities had already accumulated enough.

Even if An Ti Noya hadn't given him the notebook that could be used to upgrade, Zhao Xu felt that his four-ring magic and advanced profession skills were already beckoning him from not far away.

"Ah, truly, you're being incredibly bold, striking the autumn wind right at our heads!" At this point, the guards of the Starfall Town directly rebuked loudly.

As for Arthur, he either revered or was intimidated by the profession of a mage. In his daily life, the guards who usually stood at the city gate would often bow down upon seeing a mage pass by. A group of people who could cast spells with a flick of their hands were considered to be of high social status, equivalent to counting "gold coins". However, in Starfall Town, which was filled with players, these guards no longer treated "men in mage robes" as equivalent to "high-ranking officials".

The players had definitely not lowered the status of mages, but they had certainly tarnished the aura surrounding the apprentices of mages.

When Zhao Xu arrived at Starfall Town, which was filled with players, during the tense moment when the mysterious attack had just occurred, he was mentally prepared for cautious or cold treatment. However, he did not expect to be scolded like this.

The apprentices of mages in Starfall Town had already become accustomed to being treated as thieves or vagrants. In an instant, several crossbows were raised and pointed at Zhao Xu, and the arrows would soon be triggered to shoot out from the spring-loaded mechanism.

However, Zhao Xu's mood remained calm, and he spoke in a tone of surprise, "When did Starfall Town start 'anti-magic'?"
Here is the translation of the text:

The head of the town gate's guard squad looked up and sneered at Zhao Xun, saying, "The vice chairman of the association is indeed someone we can't reach, but what's the Magic Association doing in Starfall Town?"

"You guys, who are just a bunch of cheats, don't even know how to prepare properly. Do you think you can deceive us with a few tricks?" The guard squad leader pulled out his knife and said, "You want us to treat you like a VIP? Then you can enjoy the VIP treatment in the prison cell instead."

As the guard squad leader spoke, he seemed to recall a phrase his cousin from the Winter City once said: "If someone pretends to be a high-ranking official of the Magic Association, we can capture them and exchange them for a reward."

Zhao Xun suddenly thought that everything seemed a bit off. He quickly used his exceptional martial arts skills to snatch the envelope from the guard's hand and opened it to read the contents himself.

After reading it, he felt a sense of shock. It turned out that the "Starfall Town Magic Association" didn't actually exist. It seemed that Zhao Xun had to start from scratch, establishing the local branch of the Magic Association and gathering resources from the Northern Alliance's branch.

Zhao Xun suddenly felt a sense of headache coming on. As someone who was used to ordering his subordinates around, he felt an invisible pressure building up inside him.

Velvet also looked puzzled, wondering why these people were attacking them, the high-ranking officials of Starfall Town. She walked over to take a look at the letter in Zhao Xun's hand, and her brow furrowed in concern.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhou Xu was ordered to establish the Association of Wizards in the town of Starfall. After receiving the order, he asked Viola to protect him, and the entire chain of events was set in motion. Viola would also participate in the process from start to finish.

"Alright," Zhou Xu said with a wave of his hand, "I'll go ahead and take care of some formalities. I'll see you all later."

As he was about to leave, he naturally had to hand over the task to Anniya, and then head back to the capital.

Luckily, Zhou Xu had used his "Teleportation Spell" to bring him over earlier.

The town of Starfall was bustling with merchants and travelers because of its silver mine. At this time, people passing by saw the town guards staring at the two strangers from outside, and they couldn't help but stop and watch.

For adventurers, this kind of excitement was never too much.

The team leader of the guards waved his hand and said, "Why don't you come with us to the prison and have a chat?"

The surrounding guards heard the leader's words and suddenly looked more alert, as if they had understood the underlying meaning.

In their eyes, Zhou Xu had already become a walking treasure.

The guards themselves were well-equipped with silver mine resources, and their weapons and armor were excellent. For the two wizards dressed in plain clothes, they were even more confident.

Zhou Xu didn't bother explaining or persuading them. He flicked his fingers and directly cast the "Counterattack" spell.

This type of spell was notable for its ability to counterattack and cause damage to the enemy.

Zhou Xu used his "Spell Delay" specialization to call upon a pure energy force field, which suddenly appeared beside him, resembling a ghostly weapon.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu raised his legs and silently walked into the town. "Is this kind of magic trick going to deceive us?" the guard captain, who was nearly middle-aged with a long beard, exclaimed in a hasty tone, "Stop him!" Suddenly, a guard closest to Zhao Xu swung his wooden club and aimed it at Zhao Xu.

However, Zhao Xu remained motionless throughout, and the club suddenly crashed onto his shoulder. However, no scream of pain was heard from the audience, which was expecting a gruesome sight.

The club mysteriously stuck to Zhao Xu's shoulder and did not move again. Zhao Xu nodded slightly, and the guards, who were equipped with "magic weapons" with a "+1" attribute, jumped into action.

Although there were no special effects, their equipment was extremely luxurious. The club was a magic weapon, so it would not be destroyed by Zhao Xu's Star-Chen cloak.

However, this also meant that Zhao Xu couldn't help but feel sympathy for his opponent. This meant that his opponent had hit him. This also met the condition for the "Counterattack" spell to respond.

Instantly, the energy field that had accumulated on Zhao Xu's body suddenly detached itself and flew towards the guard who had just attacked him, hitting him directly. Everyone thought it was just an illusion at first, but in reality, the wooden club was extremely heavy, and the guard fell to the ground, unconscious.
Here is the translation of the text:

As the arrows shot by the archers converged on Zhao Xu's body, they were successfully deflected by the mysterious aura wood staff, which split into multiple shadows.

The archers' eyes widened in disbelief and disgust as the mysterious aura targeted each of them in turn, striking them down one by one. One of the archers, still dazed, cried out in agony, "This is real magic, not illusion!" as he clutched his head and rolled around on the ground.

" Ding, dah, drip, dah."

At the same time, some arrows were blocked by the cloak on Zhao Xu's body, as if the arrowheads had lost all their momentum upon touching him. They came to a stop and fell to the ground.

"This stone is kicked," muttered a wizard player standing nearby, who had been watching the scene unfold for some time.

Meanwhile, Zhao Xu did not pause or explain, continuing to maintain his pace and rhythm as he slowly approached the treacherous Starfall Town, filled with danger and opportunities.

The team leader of the guards felt a chill run down his spine, realizing he had made a mistake, but unsure of how to make amends. Even the "wizard" who had proven his abilities earlier did not even glance at them.

It was as if he had been bothered by a fly and then swatted it away.

"You're pretty cool, and I'll let you become a wizard later, no one will notice," someone said.

"There's a place where the wizarding guild is stationed, which is the abandoned house you passed through the transmission portal earlier. I'll be waiting for you here."

Anniya's gentle voice whispered in Zhao Xu's ear.
