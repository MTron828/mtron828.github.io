Chapter 557: Mom, That's Me

Just after crossing over, Zhao Xu, who didn't even have the "preparation time" of an ordinary mage or priest, immediately used the "latent power points" to recover all his spell slots.

There are 56 spell slots in total for the three major professions of mage, priest, and paladin, taking about 10 minutes to complete.

In comparison, the first hour of a mage player still needs to find a safe place to rest and prepare their spells.

After crossing over, Zhao Xu felt a sense of disorientation and quickly recovered. He briefly comforted his companions, Wang Qingwei and Zheng Xin'an, before heading straight to the Starfall Town.

As expected, the result was not what he had anticipated.

On the first day of the player's disappearance, the residents of Camelot were taken aback.

A week after the player's disappearance, rumors began to spread.

Half a month after the player's disappearance, some brave residents had already started to seize the player's properties and land.

It wasn't until yesterday that Zhao Xu realized that the Starfall Town had indeed had some shady dealings.

This was also the reason for his delay of several hours, and as a result, he couldn't shake off the killing intent in his body for a long time.

"A gentleman mage, don't think that just because you've crossed over to Camelot, you have superpowers and can do whatever you like. The law still applies here," a woman with a sharp face said sarcastically.

"Even if you've played this game before, violating the law will still result in punishment on this land," she added.

The two players behind her heard these words and were too angry to speak.

Neither their inner conscience nor their loved ones' words could make these players dare to act rashly.

"What level of authority can your superior reach?" Zhao Xu slightly raised his head and said.

"In this world where only alchemy tools or magic can facilitate communication, who can you consult?"

"I just flew over at low altitude, and basically, most of the people who crossed over are evenly distributed. How many miles can you walk in a few hours, see how many higher-level people, and then report back based on their responses?"

"Now, all the crossing crowds are basically autonomous in small regions. I remember that you and the nearby group of crossers are less than a kilometer away. Why don't you gather together? Or is it a contradiction?"

Zhao Xu's three words and two sentences disarmed the fake tiger skin behind the sharp-tongued woman.

It's not that the former elite class was incompetent, but that even their greatest abilities could not transcend the limitations of communication.

Orders cannot be transmitted to areas outside the territory.

Human screams can only cover a range of a few hundred meters, which is the current area that this small team can directly govern.

"Mom, Dad, let's go with me first," Zhao Xu said calmly, lightly pulling open his hoodie to reveal his real face.

Although he looked ordinary in his daily life, after possessing 18 points of true charm, anyone would find him extremely charming and memorable.

Even Zhao Xu's parents almost failed to recognize their own son's appearance.

"Little Xu?"

Seeing Zhao Xu appear, Zhao Xu's parents couldn't help but relax, quickly standing up.

Only after years of socializing, Zhao Xu's father, who had always been cautious, quickly grabbed Zhao Xu's hand and said, "Little Xu, how can you talk to leaders like that? Hurry and apologize to them!"
Here is the translation of the text:

As the merchant's son, Mr. Zhao, smiled warmly, he intended to chat with the few people in a relaxed manner. However, he was unexpectedly grabbed lightly by Zhao Xu. "Did I bully you?" Zhao Xu asked back.

"No, Mr. Zhongxiao is very friendly," this time, including the sharp-tongued woman and the several players behind her, as well as the selected managers, all said the same thing simultaneously.

Their lips moved in unison, and their eyes looked dull. These synchronized voices seemed like a group of puppets being controlled.

These people who had just crossed over felt a sense of fear deep in their hearts, as if they had recalled the moment when their souls and bodies were extracted from Arthur.

At that time, they were also dull and powerless, like being trapped in their bodies by another soul controlling their bodies.

"It's my fault," Zhao Xu responded immediately, hastily extending his hand.

However, the next moment, the managers who had seemed dull and lifeless suddenly became full of vitality, with bright eyes.

They looked at Zhao Xu with a gaze that no longer had the initial caution or loss of consciousness, completely recovering their human breath.

At this time, Mrs. Zhao finally let out a sigh of relief, feeling that her son had changed, and was still the same gentle and soft-hearted son she had known.

After that, Zhao Xu chatted with the managers in front of him.

In the end, the other party had protected Mr. Zhao's parents for several hours.

That is, Zhao Xu now had enough confidence, holding in his hand over a dozen "complete rebirth techniques" scrolls and several tens of "rebirth techniques" scrolls.
Here is the translation:

It's a bit unpleasant to say, but even if this area in front of us was attacked, he still has a way to salvage everything. However, when it comes to mobilizing resources, there's no time to spare, so Zhao Xu decided to head to Zhongxing Town first.

As Zhao Xu and his companions were chatting, the surrounding crowd looked confused, not knowing what was happening. They were about to fight, but suddenly, everything was fine again. The difference in their behavior was huge.

Only Zhao Xu knew what was going on.

He had just seen his father bending down slightly, as if he was on Earth to attend to company business, carrying gifts and liquor to visit a client, looking like a subordinate pleading for mercy. This made him feel a bit sentimental.

Therefore, Zhao Xu immediately used the Four- Ring Poet's Arcane and the Five-Ring Wizard's Arcane on the spot.

He manipulated the people in front of him, making them his puppets, following his inner instructions, speaking and acting accordingly.

A single Five-Ring Manipulation spell was enough to control a person's thoughts, completely controlling their actions.

Later, Zhao Xu's mother sensed something was off, and he stopped the manipulation effect, switching to the "Enchant Human" spell instead.

He released a five-ring "Group Enchant Human" spell, which could make humans believe he was a reliable friend or ally, with affection levels rising to friendly levels.

Even with Zhao Xu's high-level exemption conditions, even enemies with +5 levels of counterattack ability were still forced to change their minds.
Here is the translation of the text:

"This is also a 'Control' spell, which can unleash its powerful might after the player loses the protection of their mental barrier. 'Let's go, Mom and Dad, I need to find other relatives,' Zhao Xu said.

In reality, countless people were gathering in different crossover zones, trying to find their loved ones and friends. At this moment, people were forming small groups, united in their endeavors.

As Zhao Xu led his parents out of the crowded throng, the originally stern-looking woman was waving at them with a friendly smile.

According to Zhao Xu's spellcasting time, this hour-level spell still needs to be maintained for almost three days. The thought that this mysterious man is a good person can also linger for so long.

'Brother, can you give us some food?' a little girl suddenly ran out and hugged Zhao Xu's leg.

Her parents were worried that she would disturb the mysterious man and quickly pulled her away, but failed to catch up.

This precocious little girl had just overheard her parents whispering about the difficulties they would face in the next few days, knowing they would face a shortage of food.

Feeling sorry for her, Zhao Xu's mother quickly turned around, only to find that she had no food or sugar in her clothes. She then looked at Zhao Xu, but hesitated to speak, fearing she would trouble Zhao Xu.

'Will have some,' Zhao Xu said, squatting down to the little girl.

However, the little girl's face had already fallen, revealing a disappointed expression.

The next moment, Zhao Xu pointed to the distant empty land.

'War spell: Create Provisions!'
A box of packaged goods suddenly shot out of thin air!"
Here is the translation of the text:

Instantly, the four-ring pastor's war magic, under Zhao Xu's control, created an entire 3,000 rations of solo combat supplies and drinking water out of thin air.

Each package contained enough food and water to sustain one person for a day, and they were neatly arranged on the empty land.

"Although I used a delayed spell, but they can only last for two days, so the remaining 2,000 rations, let's divide them equally among the other teams," Zhao Xu instructed the management personnel in front of him.

Instantly, his voice penetrated the minds of a few people under the influence of the "Charm Human" spell, becoming an unbreakable order for them.

"Let's go, Mom and Dad."

At this point, Zhao Xu had already taken hold of his parents, but they did not know that Zhao Xu was about to use the teleportation spell.

"Ah, yeah, we heard that name 'Zhongxia' before, and it was also a name that caused a stir in the past," Zhao's father said.

"Yeah, do you know it? It's the same as your childhood nickname," Zhao's mother joked.

"That's me," Zhao Xu replied briefly and to the point.

At this time, the three of them had almost disappeared like bubbles, leaving behind a group of people in shock.
