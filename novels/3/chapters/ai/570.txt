Chapter 571: Weapon Plan, Hero's Banquet

As the rain poured down from the sky, the countless water puddles on the ground were instantly extinguished and reformed. The sound of raindrops and thunder occupied one corner of this world, becoming the main rhythm of the desolate wasteland.

Meanwhile, Zhao Xu had already taken shelter in the Liemont Secret Room that he had created.

With a flick of his wand, this five-ring spell created a small house similar to the four-ring spell "Liemont's Protection" in an instant.

The house was about six meters square, equipped with doors and windows, as well as a chimney with a brick-lined fireplace. It was as solid as stone, except for the magical alarm spell protecting it, and the main door was locked with a secret lock spell. The rest of the house was surrounded by iron bars, which were welded shut to prevent unauthorized entry.

Inside the house, there were some simple furniture: eight beds, a dining table with eight chairs, and a writing desk. All of these could be achieved with a single square stone slab, crushed limestone, a few grains of sand, a drop of water, and a few pieces of wood fragments, combined with a four-ring spell position.

The five-ring version, on the other hand, could hide the secret room in the natural environment surrounding it. It might appear as a large stone building in a rocky or mountainous area, or as a sand dune in a desert, or as a dense thicket of bushes in a forest, or as a small hill covered in grass, or even as a thick tree trunk.

More importantly, this secret room was completely undetectable outside of a six-meter radius. Only those with strong survival skills within the six-meter radius could sense the abnormal environment and discover this secret room.
After completing the spell, Zhao Xū retreated to the small house, avoiding the intense rain outside. The loud thunder and flashes of lightning illuminated the sky, causing distant, faint cries and screams to echo through the air. At this moment, Zhao Xū was sitting by the window, brewing hot tea while worrying about the torrential rain pouring down from the sky.

Even though he had cast the "Sanctuary" spell instead of the "Secret Library" spell, no one could find this house under the crushing force of the rain. With the help of a five-ring spell, Zhao Xū felt like he was carrying a car with him.

Just as Zhao Xū was pouring tea into a cup, the alarm suddenly went off. The door creaked open with a loud "knock-knock" sound. "Sir, can I take shelter from the rain?" a hasty male voice asked.

"Please come in," Zhao Xū said quietly, releasing the secret lock's restrictions.

The door swung open with a loud "click-clack" sound. However, Zhao Xū's attention remained unwavering.

Under the rain, relying on his survival skills, he had broken through 30 levels of difficulty to find this secret library. Only someone with extraordinary "magical items" or "superhuman abilities" could do so.

As the door swung open, three figures with similar builds suddenly rushed in. The first was a young man with a humble expression, his hands empty. Another male warrior entered, his half-armored body already soaked by the rain, with water dripping down his polished armor. However, the warrior was still gripping his massive sword, keeping a wary eye out for ambushes within the house.
Here is the translation of the text:

Another one was a female mage, with a toad-like familiar on her shoulder. She was wearing a raincoat with a bright red color and didn't look as disheveled as the other two. "If you don't mind, would you like to come in for a cup of hot tea?" she said.

Zhou Xun wouldn't mind receiving guests and might even ask a few people around to gather information about the nearby camp. In reality, it was the rain that blocked Zhou Xun, but it was the people he wanted to contact that were blocked.

It was as if the whole city was on a holiday during Golden Week, and companies that didn't give holidays would suddenly realize that the entire supply chain was on a holiday. "No, thank you," said the burly warrior, waving his hand in rejection. "Mr. Zhou has already shown us great hospitality. We won't impose further."

The warrior was cautious and wouldn't eat food provided by others without hesitation. The female mage, on the other hand, was full of admiration as she walked around the room, even touching the furniture to feel its authenticity. "I never thought that in this deep forest, there was such a hidden room that was completely integrated with the surrounding forest."

As she spoke, she turned her head to Zhou Xun and said, "Let me introduce myself. My name is Autumn Rain, and I'm a mage. These two are my companions. The warrior is called Bai Sha, and my other companion is called 'Bù Xiǔ'."

When introducing the young man, Autumn Rain paused slightly.

After hearing this, Zhou Xun's attention was fully focused on the young man in front of him, and it was obvious that he didn't have any professional level. Instead, he was the leader of the other two players.

As soon as he came in, he had already noticed the attitude of the two bodyguards. "Are you going to look for Nalani?" Zhou Xun asked in return.
Here is the translation of the text:

In an instant, his words ignited the emotions of the people in the confined space like a powder keg, and the warrior-player almost pulled out his sword in frustration.

"You figured it out?" The young man, Xu, showed no signs of panic, but instead had a look of surprise on his face.

If they were going to find someone, it would make sense. But what's surprising is that they were able to guess who they were going to find.

Zhao Xiu smiled at this.

Among the 19 "Detection XX" spells, because of the fixed distance, they all met the condition for "Spell Duration". However, Zhao Xiu didn't put all of them up, not because he couldn't, but because he didn't need to.

In addition to the "Detection Spell", he also added a few extra detection spells, including "Detection of Thoughts".

As soon as a few people entered, his observational skills allowed him to notice the unique mark on the sword in the young man's hand, a product of the famous city of Maka, which was known for its high-quality weapons.

As a city near the dwarf king's court, Maka was rich in mineral resources. The weapons produced by Maka were renowned for their unique craftsmanship and excellent effects. With a cost of over 100 gold coins, Maka's weapons could produce an item worth 300 gold coins, which was a 1-level upgrade in attack power.

Zhao Xiu also used his local knowledge to quickly look up the relevant information on the hidden pattern on the woman's robe.

Combining this with his "Detection of Thoughts" spell, he quickly read out the thoughts of the two people, including the young man's thoughts about his sister.

In an instant, everything became clear.

Zhao Xiu spoke up, his words leaving no room for doubt.

"It's not strange."
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xiu said, "You two have too many clues left behind in the city of Maka, which could reveal the identity of the two young people who are accompanying the two players, as well as the young people who are accompanying them, during this chaotic time. I'm guessing that 'Nalani' in Maka City is not unreasonable." 

Arthur's talented players, including encounter players, are not limited to Zhao Xiu alone, especially when many forces have already placed their bets in advance. Among them, Nalani, who had only reached the 7th level of the Ranger before crossing over, had gained a certain reputation and capital. She had received recognition from the "Dwarf King's Court" and was awarded the "Golden Hammer" medal, which allowed her to establish a merchant guild in Maka City. She had also occupied 15% of the city's shares. 

In the past, Zhao Xiu had sent someone to discuss the weapon issue, but even if he mentioned the name of Zhong Xia, Nalani at the time was only interested in making a fortune and did not care about Zhao Xiu's ulterior motives. She refused his weapon purchase plan, not wanting to get involved in the power struggle between the northern alliance.

"By coincidence, I had talked to your sister Nalani before, and at the time, she refused," said Zhao Xiu. "Now that time has passed, I think she should not refuse again."

Saying this, Zhao Xiu walked to the dining table, "I'm a guest, and I have some business to discuss with you, so let's have dinner first."

After the crossover, Zhao Xiu would not wear the Aen stone that allowed him to eat without food, so he would eat three meals a day. The question of what to eat became a daily routine for him in Arthur.

"Thank you for your kindness, but we have our own rations," Autumn Rain, the female mage, was about to politely decline.

But Zhao Xiu had already waved his staff, and a bright light flashed in front of him, disappearing in an instant.
Here is the translation of the text:

However, in the next instant, the originally empty space was suddenly filled with countless luxurious foods that once existed on Earth, from fragrant roasted pork to fish cooked to a golden yellow and abalone stew, and a savory aroma flooded towards them.

The three people, who had already eaten several meals of dry rations and had sour stomachs, found it hard to control themselves and their mouths began to water.

The players, who were extremely strong after crossing over, were unable to resist the temptation, but the warrior couldn't help but glance at Rain, the female mage, who seemed to be asking a question.

Rain, however, glared at him with a bad temper, and even if she had enough level, she wouldn't waste her magic on creating food.

At this point, Zhao Xu smiled slightly and said nothing else, but the key was that this spell could create anything he wanted to eat.

This was why he had deliberately left a six-ring key spell slot in the 32 spell slots, the "Hero's Banquet".

It was all for the sake of catering to his daily three meals.
