Chapter 591: Turmoil and Preparation, Death Begins

"All reserve militiamen are on high alert, and other reserve personnel are to immediately arrange for the elderly and children to be evacuated to the central defense zone," shouted the soldier on the platform, his voice loud and clear.

Not even the once-civilized region of Aria, which had been cultivated by the civilized species for many years, could guarantee the complete safety of the outdoors.

In a place like Mistral, where legends are as abundant as dogs, there are still countless dark and underground forces lurking in the shadows.

The "Wasteland of Death" itself is even more obvious.

Many Earth-crossing travelers who set out to explore the outside world with their own two feet were only able to make it a short distance before encountering difficulties and turning back, and even fewer were able to survive.

As for those who are well-prepared and head towards a distant target, if there are no safe havens along the way, they are basically doomed to die.

The Wasteland of Death is a place where humans are scarce and monsters are limitless, and this is the most brutal truth.

Even someone like Zhao Xu, who had previously relied on large-scale migration and the accumulation of strength by Earth-crossing travelers, would not dare to set out without preparation.

At present, the Wasteland of Death has no player protection, and it is basically a dead end.

Fortunately, during the initial two weeks of setting up the base camp, there were frequent disturbances from outside monsters, and similar "emergency drills" were all live-fire exercises. The children were not too panicked, but rather followed the nearby instructors in sequence.
And the remaining adults who returned from their rest day also ran to the nearby armory, where they found the recently made single-handed close combat weapon "short spear" made from sharpened stone and iron tools used for cutting down trees. The spear itself is the simplest weapon, and the short spear is an even simpler version. Even in the urban area, its price does not exceed one gold coin, making it popular among ordinary militia. The short spear can also be used to form a spear formation to defend against charges, so it has become the standard weapon in numerous camps at this moment. After observing the situation on the scene, Zhao Xun also silently relaxed. After two weeks of multiple practical exercises, the entire evacuation plan can be executed smoothly. However, the people in the rear can evacuate with peace of mind because there are people ahead of them making preparations. The young people who are on duty for battle each day also show some panic on their faces, and many parents are tearfully admonishing them, as if it's a farewell to life and death. This is the most realistic portrayal of the barren and dead land at this moment. The temporary wooden fences around the camp can only stop ordinary wild beasts and cannot stop the advance of the undead tide. The major camps can only shrink their personnel formations, abandon the majority of buildings, and huddle everyone together for protection, and then set up spear formations on all sides to push back the undead. Players and elite militia units roam the battlefield for targeted strikes. On the first night in Yanan City, Zhao Xun issued this plan to defend against the undead tide, so he was not worried at all about the regular outbreak of the undead tide in Yanan encountering the "barren and dead land." On the contrary, he wanted to take this opportunity to observe the formation of the undead tide up close and see if he could discover things that he, as a warrior in his previous life, had not noticed, or find the reasons for the formation of the undead tide.
He believes that people like King Ningwei in their past lives must have found the cause and eliminated it, but he was of humble status and had no way of knowing such high-level secrets at the time.
"The Undead Tide" is a phenomenon of the restlessness of undead creatures that regularly erupts in the wild dead land.
Generally speaking, the most widespread undead creatures in the dead land are "ghouls," "skeletons," and "zombie" squads.
Other undead creature sequences - specters (3), vengeful spirits (3), mummies (3), shadows (3), liches (3), vampire spawn (4), bound spirits (5), ghosts (7), bodachs (8), demon souls (8), liches (11), imprisoned spirits (11), liches (13), vengeful spirits (16), witches (17), grave demons (19), hungry spirits (19), flying night shadows (14), lurking night shadows (16), giant night shadows (18), and more, are all a matter of luck.
But when the "Undead Tide" erupts, it seems as if the negative energy core deep in the earth's veins will erupt with energy that can excite the undead creatures.
At this time, those undead creatures other than ghouls, skeletons, and zombies, which are rarely seen on ordinary days, will surge out like a tide, just like he once encountered in the wall passage of the death god's semi-plane.
Sometimes, a few powerful undead creatures can easily destroy a camp of tens of thousands of people.
Especially when they have the ability to "infect," it is even more so.
Therefore, the survival of a camp depends more on "luck."
This is also the reason why Zhao Xu and others, after thinking about it in their past lives, eventually left the wild dead land and joined other forces.
Here is the translation of the text:

Slowly, the distant noise of chaos and cries of despair began to echo through the air, accompanied by the initial disorganized retreat of the troops. "Run, monsters are coming, it's too terrifying!" "Hurry up, it's too terrifying this time!" "That's not ordinary skeletons and zombies!" Zhao Xu's skills in listening, which he had stacked up, allowed him to detect the noise from the front faster than anyone else. It was clear that the outermost defense line had collapsed immediately.

"How many soldiers are stationed at the outer patrol?" Zhao Xu asked Lu Tie, who was directing the flow of people on the platform.

At this moment, the instinct of the young man who was being disturbed in such an emergency was to swear loudly. However, he saw Zhao Xu, who had just demonstrated an attack power of over 30 levels, above the level of the "Sword Saint", and restrained his temper, explaining patiently: "There are at least five hundred patrol soldiers outside, and many of them have been promoted to 1st-level mercenaries. There are also at least several dozen players on guard duty outside."

At this time, the wilderness was basically a "ploughing" and "warring" state, just like in ancient times. Even famous singers who had crossed over from the previous era began to take the "troubadour" route.

Those with higher abilities were arranged to manage and receive professional training, while the rest were assigned to the defense department, and the remaining ones were distributed to engage in the production of necessities for daily life in the camp, to be distributed later according to "tickets". As for those who had no outstanding skills, they were distributed to clear and cultivate the land.

So, a large camp could assign hundreds of people just to guard the gate, Zhao Xu was not surprised, he was just too shocked by the speed of the collapse.
Here is the translation of the text:

In an instant, Lu Tie realized Zhao Xu's intention, and his face suddenly changed. He immediately roared, "Level one alert, level one alert, accelerate retreat, no matter the cost, abandon supplies and retreat!" When he said this, a few of the militiamen who were a bit more emotional almost cried out loud. But when everyone tightened their grip on their weapons, ready to advance, they could only swallow their tears back down.

Zhao Xu immediately inspected the buffs on his body.

The big battle was about to begin, and he needed to supplement his abilities to counter the undead tide.

After obtaining the potential points, he didn't think the buffs were that important at first, but he didn't care and started using them anyway.

Like the "Inheritance of the Ruin Explorer" skill, he used it four times in a row, respectively boosting his strength, agility, and willpower, equivalent to a charm adjustment, and also increasing his life value.

Meanwhile, there were several famous skill combinations in the Arthurian system. If one had multiple skill combinations on their body at the same time, they could produce a "synergy" effect, such as the "Unicorn Combination" and "Primitive Combination".

After checking everything, he waved his hand at Lu Tie and said, "Retreat and regroup. This attack is far beyond your imagination."

Unfortunately, their camp had the misfortune of encountering a "Powerful" level "Wraith Disaster".

However, it was fortunate that he had just arrived to participate in the negotiations.

"...I'm sorry, we cannot accept your conditions. Although we players all respect Mr. Zhong Xia, and believe that Yu An will grow up to be a mighty tree in the future, but at this moment, we believe that our own hands can create a beautiful future for ourselves."
On the long table, a poet player said, "Although you, Yangnan, have grown exponentially large, our base has also taken shape, and the number of players is not small. Your nominal federal government, in fact, has no real autonomy whatsoever." A middle-aged man responsible for organizational production, who had previously served as a vice president of a Fortune 500 company, spoke up. Despite having no professional title, he quickly gained a key position in the new organization due to his abilities.

This transformation from commerce to politics also allowed him to step into previously inaccessible doors.

Therefore, despite the harsh conditions, he has been fighting day and night during this period. At this time, it would be impossible for him to maintain his original position if he were to suddenly join in.

Even without a direct confrontation, simply by listening, he is very vigilant towards the "management team" formed by Yangnan at this moment.

"Aren't we, Yangnan, just picking cherries after we've finally stabilized the situation in our base?" another player responsible for training militiamen opposed.

At this point, the high-level players and non-players in the room had already shifted from a 5:5 ratio to a 7:3 ratio, with the gap growing larger.

Especially high-IQ and high-charisma players can easily realize they are more suitable for "management" work and can perform well.

However, the atmosphere in the room was extremely tense, as if no one would agree to join. The negotiation personnel from the Yangnan side looked gloomy, with those in charge looking particularly somber.
Here is the translation of the text:

He was clear that more than twenty negotiation teams had been dispatched by Yánán to various major bases. Simply selecting the bases had already triggered a huge controversy within Yánán, with high-ranking officials all hoping to include their hometown regions in the negotiation scope. The initial twenty bases to be negotiated had been discussed for half a day before being finalized by Wáng Kéngwē.

How could it be that "recruitment" - an act that Yánán regarded as a benevolent gesture - would be rejected one day?

However, he also understood that the smaller the base, the harder it would be to maintain self-sufficiency. A small disturbance could easily destroy a small base, and naturally, it was undesirable to merge.

But looking at the current base, it seemed that even without Yánán, it could sustain itself for a while, which was also the opponent's strength.

But wasn't this too strange?

Yánán had never acted so shamelessly before.

After a moment of thought, the negotiation leader also reacted, unable to help but smile.

The room was too stifling, and he felt a bit short of breath.

With Yánán's prestige, the opponent's top officials wouldn't dare to resist this negotiation either, or they wouldn't even dare to open the door.

Moreover, it was impossible for a high-ranking official to be a single, unified entity, with no independent voice.

The opponent's consistent performance had actually been discussed beforehand.

The heated debate on the ground was nothing more than a demand for high prices and immediate payment.

Since it was like this, Yánán's negotiation leader thought about the "list" of measures and prepared to put one out for discussion first.

Just then, a loud commotion echoed through the room.

"What's going on? Has it been attacked?" The highest leader of the base stood up and asked.
At this moment, a militiaman who was panting for breath rushed in, gasping for air, "Something big is wrong, undead creatures, many, have invaded the camp zone, and the outermost perimeter has lost over a hundred people." 

Suddenly, the high-ranking officers who were simulating a camp zone defense at night all changed color, and they were much clearer about what this meant than people outside. 

This brief period of time without normal signal transmission only meant one thing: 
this enemy is capable of wiping out the entire camp zone. 

As for Yang Nan, the chief negotiator, he just smiled slightly and closed his mouth, implying that the autonomous conditions prepared earlier were unnecessary to say.
