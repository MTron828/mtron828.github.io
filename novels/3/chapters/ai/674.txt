Chapter 675: Battlefield

"Captain, hurry and save them, they might get trampled to death!" Little Zhao exclaimed anxiously, following closely behind Zhao Xu.

In her line of sight, the captives had mostly had their weapons taken away and had lost most of their combat effectiveness. Only the spellcasters, martial artists with internal energy, and some warriors with combat experience could still fight with minimal decline in strength. The others, unless they could retrieve their weapons, could only flee in disarray.

Not to mention those who were double-bound and even had bones broken, and were nearly as good as dead.

The outermost cavalry unit and earth players were already clashing with the "cannibal demons" face-to-face, and even the silhouette of a priest group appeared.

However, these besieged people were as if abandoned, attracting hardly any attention.

Zhao Xu naturally heard Little Zhao's words, but he slightly observed and noticed that the main force of this group was not in the direction of their own, which made him somewhat perplexed.

Was it not because there was a key figure's descendant who had come to rescue people?

So, it seemed that the entire camp's efficiency was extremely high, and he was mistaken?

"Ah!"

Suddenly, a few players who had failed to escape let out a painful scream.

Although the strong cannibal demons had already ridden on their double-footed dragons to the front line, it did not mean that these captives were safe.

These cannibal demons who had not yet reached the battlefield were casually swinging their massive axes at them!
Here is the translation of the text:

Even ordinary level 3 monsters are not to be underestimated, as they have combat strength comparable to 1st and 2nd level players. Even if they are face-to-face on the battlefield, they must be taken seriously, let alone when they are currently injured.

At this moment, these hostages suddenly realized the gravity of their situation.

The backup forces on the perimeter had become a death sentence for them!

Even if there were strong heroes who descended from heaven, they wouldn't be able to save them. It wouldn't take three rotations of time before they would all be in danger of falling.

Unless someone mastered the art of flight, it was impossible to escape by flying away on the back of a dragon. Even the ability to float in mid-air, which couldn't be used to move freely, would only mean safety if they could maintain a safe distance from their pursuers.

At this moment, the players who had just glimpsed hope were all displaying despair on their faces.

They were all pressed together, rolling around on the ground, trying to avoid the deadly blows of the axe-wielding monsters. One of them, who had managed to break free from their restraints, was even helping their teammates to break free, but was instantly beheaded by a demonic monster!

The splattered blood sent the crowd into a frenzy of screaming.

This scene was like hell.

"Don't worry," said Zhao Xiu, who had also witnessed this, gently patting the shoulder of Yu Er.

"Since I'm part of the same team as Yana, I won't let them die easily."

As he spoke, Zhao Xiu quickly waved his hand and began to cast a spell.

"The dimensional teleportation spell!"

With the incantation, a five-ring spell was cast, accompanied by a faint blue glow and a faint explosion sound.

In the empty space, it seemed as if countless invisible threads were stretched out, then snapped taut!

Within a 10-meter radius from Zhao Xiu, more than ten members suddenly disappeared from their original positions, as if they had simultaneously cast ten "Portation" spells.
Here is the translation:

These people were all caught off guard and suddenly found themselves on the other side of the battlefield, having returned to the rear lines of the human army.

"What's going on?"

"Ah? How is this possible?"

Just a moment ago, Ling'er had been facing a giant axe, with her composite longbow worth a hundred gold coins lying broken on the ground. She had been preparing to withstand the blow and had even bitten her tongue in anticipation. But in the blink of an eye, she had traversed a distance of over 100 meters.

This sudden and terrifying sensation of almost certain death mixed with feelings of happiness filled her entire being, causing her to cry uncontrollably for a long time.

The term "dimensional movement" refers to a high-level magic technique with significant strategic value. It allows the caster to reorganize small-scale formations.

It's like setting up a chessboard, allowing the caster to reposition the pieces one by one.

However, Zhao Xu had always been a lone wolf, with few teammates, so he rarely used this technique.

Why would he use it to attack the enemy? He could use a single spell to take down an opponent, so why bother to exert himself to change the enemy's formation?

Therefore, this spell was only used in the moment of rescue. Dimensional movement is a close-range spell, and as the current level of the caster, Zhao Xu, it can choose a target within a 30-meter radius.

Each level allows the caster to move within a range of 10 meters, and all affected individuals will move according to the caster's will to a new range within their line of sight. Zhao Xu's team had just arrived, with fewer than 10 people, so he directly assigned the remaining 20 slots to the people between him and the next batch of hostages.

Instantly, a path cleared in front of him.

"Wow, team leader, is this magic?"
Here is the translation of the text:

At this moment, the entire battlefield was chaotic, with everyone scrambling to get out of the way. Only then did Enrui, who was closely following Zhao Xu, finally see what was happening.

"Look, look!" Enrui exclaimed, tightly grasping Zhao Xu's sleeve and pointing to the original prisoner-of-war zone.

"Don't get excited, my dear," Zhao Xu said softly, his white hands floating gently in the air.

At the same time, the few demons who were near Zhao Xu didn't notice his formidable power, and they simply went wild, their dark, fleshy skin bulging out even more.

The few crossbows also shot out a "Lingli" sound as they whizzed by.

"Let's go," Zhao Xu said, not looking back, and took Enrui's wrist, as if nothing was happening, and continued walking down the road he had cleared.

"It seems like an arrow——" Enrui, who had a keen sense of perception, felt something unusual.

However, Zhao Xu had already used his "Friendly Fire" spell, which he had mastered during his daily training, specifically to counter long-range attacks.

The only ones who could hit him were stronger mages, not ordinary crossbowmen.

Suddenly, a golden light field appeared behind Zhao Xu, and the energy waves created a massive gravitational pull, causing the crossbows to twist and turn around the two of them, and then shot towards the nearby demons.

The cries of the demons echoed through the air, but they were the ones who had been hit by the crossbow bolts.

Friendly Fire, also known as the Four-Ring Star-Shift Spell, was specifically designed to counter all forms of long-range and contact attacks.
Here is the translation of the text:

As they approached the prisoner area, satisfying the 30-meter spellcasting distance, Zhao Xu continued to draw a circle with a gourd, using "Dimensional Pull" to teleport away the dozens of prisoners.

The entire process went smoothly, and even these flesh-eating demons hadn't reacted yet, only to see the prisoners in front of them disappear, leaving their axes idle.

Seeing this scene, the compassionate Allow finally let out a sigh of relief.

Everyone could leave peacefully, and it was good.

However, Zhao Xu just lightly bumped Allow on the shoulder, saying, "It's your turn."

"Ah?" Allow was taken aback, "Then, Commander, send me away."

They had finished relocating the prisoners and completing their task, and it was indeed possible to send them away.

"Ha ha," Zhao Xu smiled slightly.

"Who said we're leaving? I mean, let you continue, and let's slaughter these flesh-eating demons."

"Ah?"

This time, Allow's eyes showed an incredulous expression, as if she couldn't believe it. Was she really going to ask her to slaughter these demons?

Even before her resurrection, Allow had mostly been a preacher. After accepting near-combat training from the priest in Floating City, she didn't have many opportunities to wield weapons.

And after her encounter with the "Death God Fragment", Allow had no habit of using weapons.

Now, was she really going to ask her to kill people with her own hands?

"You say so," Zhao Xu urged, "Hurry up and get started, and I'll be watching you from behind."

"Commander," Allow said, looking at Zhao Xu with a troubled expression.

To be honest, she really needed to overcome her psychological barrier before she could swing a weapon to kill people.

Using magic to kill or a warrior using a weapon to kill, the feedback was different.
Here is the translation of the text:

In his cultivation target system, Ren'er was not just playing the role of a "therapist" alone. "Take it," said Zhao Xu as he handed over a common "hammer" weapon used by priests.

"I'm, I'm scared," Ren'er, who was initially in observer mode, suddenly shuddered slightly in her legs.

However, Zhao Xu also understood. When executing capital punishment with a gun in the past, soldiers who gave the execution order had to undergo psychological preparation. Many soldiers who had experienced war also suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder after the war. Even when executing a death sentence, it was usually done by a team of people, and no one knew whether their own injection was the fatal one. Sharing the psychological burden.

Killing was not just a game-like action that could be done in a game. Even some players with sufficient strength in the beginning hesitated when drawing their weapons, and one moment of hesitation could lead to a counterattack.

Now, Zheng Xinren couldn't bring herself to act, which was understandable.

But Zhao Xu was determined to train Ren'er this time, and would not let her retreat. During their conversation, he had already used several types of force field techniques, including the "Tail Sweep" to knock down many demons, and the "Five Rings Protective Palm" to create a large-sized magical hand between them and the demons, which floated back and forth, blocking the demons' approach.

"Brother, can we do it again, okay?" Ren'er still looked hesitant, seeking help from Zhao Xu, who was clearly terrified by the demons' stench. Or maybe she was also afraid that a hammer blow would splash blood on her face.
Here is the translation of the text:

What's more crucial is that she's afraid of pain.

Instantly, Zhao Xu detected Li Er's thoughts and couldn't help but slap his own forehead.

"If you don't go, it's my turn to hit you," Zhao Xu said harshly, finally understanding why there was a special team for this kind of situation.

"If I accidentally get hit by those giant clubs and die, you'll have to come and collect my body, Team Leader Brother," Li Er said, looking at Zhao Xu with a difficult-to-refute determination, her voice trembling as she cried.

Honestly, who would have thought that he, Zhao Xu, would be forcing a pitiful girl to go to war to die...

Zhao Xu muttered to himself.

"Here, take it," he said, pulling out a glass bottle filled with ordinary water from his backpack, "This is a medicinal potion that can cure deadly wounds. Even if you're severely injured, drinking it will allow you to jump back to life."

At the scene, it was clear that the potion couldn't save someone who was going to die from a single blow.

"Team Leader Brother, you're lying, this is just a bottle of ordinary water," Li Er said, tearing him apart.

Zhao Xu's face turned bright red, and he almost forgot that Li Er was a priest.

Even someone who's never eaten pork but has seen a pig running around would know that you can't buy a level-one healing potion from a general store. You have to buy it from the temple.

In reality, Zhao Xu had planned from the beginning to use his "healing spell" on Li Er.

He didn't need to give Li Er a real healing potion, so she wouldn't mistake it for a sweet drink.

Although a healing potion that costs a few hundred gold coins is not expensive to Zhao Xu.

But in the warehouse of Ailan, it's a strategic material that can save lives, so Zhao Xu didn't waste any thoughts on it.
Here is the translation of the text:

However, it seemed that Zhao Xu had forgotten his identity as a priest.

At this moment, he naturally couldn't change back to the real medicine, so he continued to insist, "This is the real medicine for treatment."

As he spoke, the other two fingers gently knocked on the bottle body, completing the most critical incantation action - "Quick Medicine!"

As Zhao Xu's incantation was almost inaudible, the ordinary water in the bottle began to swirl around the clock hand, and a copper-colored flame burst out from the tip of his finger and dripped into the water. In an instant, the entire bottle became filled with a deep iron oxide color.

The next second, Zhao Xu continued to cast the spell - "Cure Mortal Wounds" four-ring divine art.

The spell, filled with positive energy, did not enter any person's body, but instead entered the entire bottle of water!

He transformed the water in the bottle, making it able to store the spell just like the original medicine.

As the spell energy dissipated, the water in the bottle became identical to the "Cure Mortal Wounds" medicine.

Finally, Ellen mustered her courage, took the medicine from Zhao Xu, who had changed the color of the medicine, and boldly walked towards the battlefield!

At this moment, Zhao Xu looked back at her with a silent smile.

"Transform Giant!"

In an instant, Ellen's original body remained in place, but her height doubled and her weight became eight times her original weight.

Most importantly, at this moment, she no longer felt small in front of these devouring demons.

"Ellen, try to feel it, a priest who can do anything, what does it feel like?" Zhao Xu looked at the buff list on his spellbook and muttered to himself.

Buffing, starting to prepare.
