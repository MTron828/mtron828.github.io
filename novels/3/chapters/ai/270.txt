Chapter 271: Compulsion Art

As soon as Zhao Xu heard the words "take it all," even though he had already mastered control over his emotions, he couldn't help but feel waves of turmoil rising up inside him.

Anzhi Noya didn't keep Zhao Xu in suspense, directly answering him: "If you don't make a decision before leaving this space, then you won't make any choices."

"That truth fragment will directly activate and envelop you in a historical scenario before you officially leave the space. At that time, you will experience a real historical scenario, and ultimately gain an ability among 0-3 options based on your requirements and evaluation, and receive a reward."

After listening to this, Zhao Xu was deep in thought, wondering whether he should take this path.

The 0-3 options implied that the scenario evaluation might be very low, and the original 1-point reward might be lost.

However, he also had the possibility of obtaining the 3-point reward.

"Teacher, what was that scenario like?" Zhao Xu continued to ask Anzhi Noya.

"Back when I was younger, I simulated a scenario where I was a princess who sought revenge for my country's downfall. In the end, I successfully avenged my country and obtained the truth fragment's reward," Anzhi Noya recalled.

However, after hearing these words, Zhao Xu's slightly furrowed brows didn't relax.

He said, "I've been estimating that I can master these 3-ring arts by today. Originally, I planned to enter the 'Half-Domain' tomorrow, but if I get sidetracked in the historical scenario, I'm afraid it will delay the progress of the 'Half-Domain'."

Zhao Xu had obtained the key for the first time, but was sent to Star Lake, where he spent only a few days before becoming exhausted.
Here is the translation of the text:

He didn't want to waste another 10 to 15 days in that scenario just to get the other two rewards. "This scenario has a time limit as well, and you'll be kicked out after 12 hours at most," Anzhenya explained. Zhao Xu's heart was racing as he calculated that even if he stayed for 12 hours, he wouldn't make it to the next morning. So, he could still make it to the middle of the day before the deadline. "Lakis, do you have any ideas?" Zhao Xu asked himself, addressing his inner Lakis. "Yeah, I think we can try," Lakis replied. "After all, it's not something we can use perfectly in the near future. It's just a big cake for later, so let's make it bigger." Zhao Xu almost laughed out loud. The biggest cake for him was Lakis herself. After communicating with Anzhenya, Zhao Xu decided to enter the historical scenario to get three rewards. Then, he poured all his energy into recording the magic spell. To be honest, this was his initial intention to enter the final chapter space. Compared to before, Zhao Xu had spent more time browsing through the process. The three-ring magic spells were recorded one by one into his inner heart. Time was slowly being consumed. It wasn't until Zhao Xu finished his recording plan for the day that he and Anzhenya together restarted the ritual to return to their original position. However, Zhao Xu's body didn't immediately return to the seventh floor of the pagoda, Anzhenya's "True Truth" laboratory.

It was as if he had just begun to say something, and then he appeared in a hotel room. At this time, Zhao Xu slowly walked to one side and looked at his reflection in the copper mirror on the desk. His appearance had completely changed into that of a middle-aged man with a pale face.

However, Zhao Xu suddenly noticed that a piece of paper had appeared in his chest, as if someone had thrown it there invisibly. He didn't think twice and unfolded the paper from his chest.

"'18 years ago, you, a farmer, were captured by a gang of robbers who had raided the village and were forced to become a slave. You spent years digging in the dark mine, and later, you used the mysterious talisman to become a powerful wizard. After killing the person in charge of the mine, you returned to your original village. However, you found that the village had been burned down by those robbers, and you swore an oath to take revenge, vowing to take revenge with tooth and claw.'

'This is the castle where the noble family who killed your family members lives. The population distribution is as follows...'

As Zhao Xu finished reading the last sentence, the paper automatically ignited and turned into ashes.

It turned out to be a revenge tale of a wizard.

Zhao Xu didn't expect to play such a role.

However, after determining his mission, Zhao Xu patted the "talisman" he had dug out and activated the "teleportation" spell, descending to the outside of the corresponding castle.

As the first station of the wizard's intelligence, Zhao Xu chose to conduct a field investigation. He immediately cast the seven-ring spell "Spectral Transformation" on himself.
Here is the translation of the text:

Suddenly, his entire body, along with the equipment on him, turned into a spirit and directly entered the spiritual realm that overlapped with the main material plane.

At this time, Zhao Xu looked towards the main material plane and found that everything in that world had turned grayish and dull. However, as a spirit, he could still see and hear everything on the main material plane. His visual and auditory range was limited to about 20 meters, and beyond that, he lost connection, as if he could only sense everything within the range of a torch.

Zhao Xu also relied on this technique to directly enter the castle. In general, the living beings within the castle could not sense Zhao Xu's existence without the "True Knowledge" technique with at least six rings.

The advantage of Zhao Xu's "Illusory Spirit Body" was that he would not be touched by the living beings within the castle, even if they saw him. Only defensive magic and force field magic could affect him.

The castle itself had many servants and hired farmers, and it was even a small town. The duration of "Illusory Spirit Body" was calculated based on the "Wheel" level, but at this moment, he was equivalent to the final volume of the "Wheel" and had unlimited magical slots.

Zhao Xu also had countless "usable super magical specialties" and directly bestowed his "Illusory Spirit Body" with magical endurance.

After exploring the castle for about an hour and a half, Zhao Xu had basically figured out the distribution of personnel.

At this time, Zhao Xu also thought about his mission.

His problem was that he was a fish out of water. He was not saying he couldn't fight, but once he started killing, if the noble family in the castle discovered him, they would not hesitate to escape.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

This would inevitably affect the completion rate of his task. He knew that this was just a simulated scenario to test himself, so he naturally didn't feel any psychological burden. The problem was that he had to figure out how to solve it quickly. Moreover, his target was only the noble family, and he wouldn't harm the innocent servants and farmers in the castle. Otherwise, he could prepare a large-scale massacre spell to destroy the castle along with it.

After a while, Zhao Xuan finally let out a sigh.

He quietly floated into a tightly closed door, his mind dark and sinister.

At this moment, a middle-aged man was lying on the bed, snoring loudly, with a maid lying next to him, both of them in disarray. This middle-aged man had molested many innocent women in the castle, and Zhao Xuan saw him as deserving of death.

Zhao Xuan decided to use the "Control Spell" on this man, instructing him to commit self-destruction. The "Control Spell" was a six-ring spell that could instruct a living being to perform a task, but it couldn't be self-destructive or a task that would certainly lead to death. If the target failed to execute the instruction, he would suffer daily harm and a sense of disgust.

However, before Zhao Xuan took action, he replaced the spell with a higher-level one, the "Family Control Spell". This eight-ring spell was an extension of the original "Control Spell", covering family members.

If the target died before completing the instruction, the effect of the "Family Control Spell" would be passed down to his closest adult relatives.
Here is the translation of the text:

At the same time, he spent a full 10 minutes casting the "Family Command" spell on the person in front of him. This way, the other person's family will continuously execute Zhao Xu's "Extermination Order" without interruption.

This is also the reason why this spell has never been seen in the light of day, as it is too cruel and tyrannical. "Master, shall we use the 'Blood Oath' again?" Lark suggested.

"Really that ruthless?" Zhao Xu raised an eyebrow.

"Well, it's just a fake scenario, and we're just doing a role-playing exercise for this mage," Lark continued to persuade Zhao Xu.

"Besides, Master, your revenge is actually beneficial for your future entry into the half-angelic realm of the God of Death."

Upon hearing this, Zhao Xu's expression changed slightly, and he didn't need to get too worked up over a fake scenario.

Thinking this, Zhao Xu directly cast the "Blood Oath" spell on the man who had been affected by the "Family Command" spell.

The "Blood Oath" is a five-ring spell that can only be cast on a target that has just received the "Command" spell.

Once the target dies before completing the task, this spell will take effect, transforming the opponent into an undead being that will continue to execute the contents of the "Command" spell to the point of not letting them rest even in death.

After completing these tasks, Zhao Xu also transformed into a "Phantom Body" state, preparing to observe the man's future actions.

"Ah, my master is really kind, won't he undo the opponent's command spell?" Lark looked at Zhao Xu, about to continue observing, and couldn't help but say.

However, Zhao Xu didn't answer, as his screen suddenly displayed a prompt...
"Hint: Adventurers who respond to the situation in the same way as the historian will receive three rewards, and the scenario will end."
