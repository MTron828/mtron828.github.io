Chapter 495: Observers at the Banquet
Orlu City, Commander-in-Chief's Mansion, Banquet Hall.

"Have you heard? The Red Lips were reduced to ashes last night?" A noblewoman with a slightly plump figure, holding a lace fan, whispered to a noblewoman beside her, her mouth covered with her hand.

At this moment, the four or five of them were standing around a dessert table, taking food and exchanging gossip about their lives.

"You haven't heard? Last night, the Lord of Chandeliers next door was in a commotion. Almost all the servants were sent out to rescue the master who was buried in the wall, and it's said that when they pulled him out, he was still attached to that shameless woman." A young noblewoman who had just shared the latest gossip smiled lightly, clearly pleased with herself for successfully inserting the topic.

The older ladies on the side also laughed lightly, covering their mouths.

Their etiquette and tradition were hardly different from those of the noblewomen in the traditional great empire, as if they were mass-produced from a mold. Or, when the Northern Alliance was established several centuries ago, even families of humble origins would not feel like they were imitating the lifestyle of the "upper class".

Each person who had managed to enter this circle was worried that they would be excluded from it because of their differences in etiquette and social standing.

"That Mrs. Chandeliers must have been furious with him." Without firsthand information, a noblewoman could only rely on her existing knowledge and experience to make inferences and respond appropriately.

"That's how it is, Duke Chandlar didn't come to the headquarters today. My husband didn't see him at the Ministry of Finance, and I went to visit him in the evening, and his face was swollen. He must have been injured by his wife and will probably be absent for a week."

The lady in the presence, who is the wife of a high-ranking official, smirks with satisfaction as she reveals the news.

Or rather, what makes her even more pleased is that she has successfully pulled her husband, who is a deputy at the League of Finance, into the conversation.

As expected, the ladies around her immediately burst into laughter, echoing the "humor" hinted at by the lady, that Duke Chandlar "wasn't hit by a wall, but was injured by his wife at home."

As for Zhao Xu, who is standing quietly a few meters away, observing the upcoming party, he is amused by the group of women who are openly discussing other people's misfortunes while dressed in meticulously prepared formal attire.

No matter when he hears these circle gossiping, he finds it fascinating, even to the point of being tedious.

For these women, this "event" is just a joke about a man who likes to play around at home. However, it has actually created a huge wave in the city of Orlus.

Even the White Dragon Sereus and Saint Warrior Vivian, who are resting at Frere's place, were questioned due to external factors.

Sereus had already transformed into his true form according to Zhao Xu's arrangement, and the search team lacked the knowledge and skills to identify shape-shifting. The inspection was quickly completed due to Frere's personal encouragement.

As for the intrusion into the bedroom below the altar, which startled the Demon Lord Glazt, it is a crucial "information" that will trigger a chain reaction in the entire Northern Alliance.
Here is the translation of the text:

However, Zhao Xū also had some strange feelings, according to his observations, the entire headquarters had no significant changes throughout the day, and even he deliberately kept a low profile, monitoring Floria's residence, and not a single extra person came to inspect.

It was not until the evening that Floria, the only daughter of the leader Tang De, returned from outside, changing into a luxurious and dazzling dress.

All the clues seemed to reveal that "Grazzetti" this evil lord had not revealed the details to Tang De.

If Tang De had known what happened during the day, he would probably be able to tolerate it. Zhao Xū had to consider the possibility of temporarily avoiding Tang De's attention.

As the leader of the alliance, "Grazzetti" was a follower of the evil lord, unless Tang De had always believed that he was a benevolent deity, or he was completely unaware of the situation. In that case, Tang De would have no way to escape the church's intervention.

Floria's residence was contaminated by the evil altar's aura, and it was necessary to frequently use 25 gold coins per bottle of holy water to wipe it clean.

It was either Floria or Tang De who could arrange for someone to do this without leaving any trace.

At this moment, Zhao Xū was free and continued to observe Tang De, who was standing at the front of the stage.

As the highest commander and leader of the entire northern alliance for the next eight years, Tang De had been surrounded by a tide of people since he entered the banquet hall, with many young people waiting for an opportunity to make an impression. Most of them were recommended by high-ranking officials of the alliance and briefly introduced to others, only to be pushed away by another wave of people waiting to be introduced.

Everyone knew that this was an opportunity that would leave a lasting impression in front of Tang De, and even the names of those who had made an impression were unknown at night.
Zhao Xu suddenly realized that Frey had personally agreed to recommend him to "Tang De", which was actually a very valuable thing, or something that only someone with his background could guarantee.

As the warm music began to play, Zhao Xu held a highball glass filled with red wine, constantly swaying the liquid's surface, as if savoring the aroma, while hiding his own observations.

Tang De's expression was calm and composed, occasionally patting the shoulders of the young people who came and went, as if he had no burden in his heart.

At this moment, Zhao Xu's gaze seemed to possess a profound and unparalleled "transparency", like a cunning old fox who had spent years in the business, making it easy for him to penetrate his opponent's mind.

If his skills were insufficient, he would rely on magic.

For tonight's observation, Zhao Xu had deliberately cast the "Sly Gaze" spell, a "Heaven-level" skill that allowed him to recognize the opponent's inner feelings and desires.

Giragos's dwarves would use any form of knowledge to ensure that they could achieve their primary goal in negotiations and social interactions. In the end, they developed this spell, using their exceptional skill to identify their opponent's inner feelings and desires, and suppress their opponent's opinions.

With the spell, Zhao Xu had obtained a 10-level enhancement in negotiation, deception, intimidation, and observation skills.

Now, with just a glance, he could see through the target's inner motives and desires.

The few ladies who had just left were also a test of his ability.

Zhao Xu seemed to be the "observer" at this lively banquet, dressed in his robe, subtly reminding everyone of his identity as a "magician".

The high-level magicians' fearsome reputation also made everyone dare not approach Zhao Xu's vicinity.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu and An Tianya noticed that Princess Freya's palace was completely quiet all day. After discussing, they decided to rely on observing the "Tang De" behind the scenes to tear apart the giant web of intrigue. Otherwise, tonight's guests would be the high-ranking officials of the benevolent gods. "Ah, Mr. Zhong Xia, it's our turn now."

Just as Freyl had disappeared for a while, he suddenly appeared beside Zhao Xu, directly grasping his hand and walking towards the center of the stage. Freyl's attendant also cleared a path for them.

"Commander, allow me to introduce this person," Freyl said, walking a few steps away from Tang De, with a warm smile. As he lifted his hand, people followed his gesture to look at Zhao Xu in the center.

For a moment, many attendees who were observing the situation silently gazed at this young wizard who seemed somewhat isolated. "I'm delighted to see that the alliance has produced such a talented young person," Tang De also smiled.

His eyes seemed to flash with another kind of soul.
