Arthur is just a part of the lives of Earth players, even the most dedicated players like Zhao Xu, who spend all their time online, are only at this level.
But for the native residents, Arthur is everything.
Zhao Xu used to have no resources, so everything had to be done on his own.
Now, even though he is a player, he is already a level 5 mage. Even if he were to cross over now, he could live very comfortably.
Even just a few ordinary third-level spells are enough to bring him sufficient wealth. So Zhao Xu has also started to have the qualifications and capital to cultivate and select his own subordinates.
The mages of the Floating City are the leaders of the Mage Association, and at best he can only meet like-minded individuals. In order to gain the support of low-level mages, he, as a mere third-level mage, would have a hard time convincing others without revealing his true abilities.
Zhao Xu took up a teaching position at the civilian college, and in a way, he got this good opportunity.
The students in the civilian college, even if they are not perfect, have one difficult-to-hide advantage, which is that they have at least gone through a public background check and at least appear to have a clean family background.
And because of the relationship with auxiliary professions, there are fewer cases of infiltration and interference from other organizations.
Eridon, in front of him, can be said to be one of the cleanest people in Zhao Xu's class, with no family or household burdens.
And he has a mission of revenge, which drives him to strive to become stronger.
Zhao Xu can also use this to his advantage and make use of him.
Here is the translation of the text:

After Zhao Xu finished casting the spell, he saw Elinton standing up, acknowledging his mistake. He would directly choose to summon Elinton for a detailed conversation. At this time, Elinton heard Zhao Xu say he could help him become a mage, but he didn't show any excitement, instead looking dazed. Although he knew it was unlikely to achieve his goal, he didn't want to waste resources. If he could become a mage just by increasing his intelligence, those top-tier mage families wouldn't need to spend so much effort on it.

This is also the reason why Elinton was so despondent after knowing he couldn't become a mage. He didn't say a word to Zhao Xu, but he was willing to do anything to get revenge. As long as he could take one step forward on the road to revenge, he would be satisfied.

Zhao Xu also had some doubts in his mind. He noticed that Elinton's outer robe was slightly worn out and asked, "Is the training for this profession worth such a huge expense?" Elinton just smiled wryly and said, "Initially, my family left behind sufficient wealth for me and my mother to live comfortably. However, I want to integrate into their group, so I have to spend some money in certain areas. I don't want to burden my mother, so I have to cut back on other expenses. Moreover, wearing ordinary clothes can make them feel the gap between us and create a contrast."
Zhao Xu listened to the other party's words in a daze. If Eliton didn't have a deep-seated grudge, he probably would have been the type to please others and be taken advantage of. This kind of role is naturally very considerate to the younger brother, but the problem is that it is easy to anger and get upset. No wonder he was the first to stand up and take the blame.

Before, his misconception was only covered up by the other party's indifferent attitude. But the other party's attempt to integrate into their circle is indeed a helpless move.

According to Eliton's current development path, he will probably be able to obtain a good position with the help of this group of classmates. As for the road ahead, once he can climb to a certain position in the Mistrala City Hall system, he might even be able to establish a good relationship with mid-level mages, after all, mages also have families to take care of. Eventually, this will allow him to find strong individuals to seek revenge for him.

Zhao Xu shook his head and decisively said, "I'll arrange for you to be a teaching assistant when we return. This position is originally part-time for students, and you can also receive a subsidy." Eliton hesitated, but seeing Zhao Xu's determination and knowing that it was entirely for his benefit, he couldn't find a polite way to refuse.

"Then go change your clothes, and let them know they can change as well. Then come with me to the administrative office at the academy to complete the procedures. As for the afternoon, you will follow me, I happen to need you to show me around."

Eliton looked at Zhao Xu with a shocked expression, "Here?"

But at this point, Zhao Xu had already lowered his head and was flipping through a mysterious book on magic, and Eliton understood that he had misunderstood. He simply turned and left.
Here is the translation of the text:

After the other person's figure disappeared, Zhao Xu finally lifted his head, but his heart felt a bit strange. If he were a player familiar with the culture of the "original friend," he might understand this reaction. However, logically speaking, people from the Arthurian realm should not be this sensitive. It's as if the other person had a shadow. Suddenly, Zhao Xu felt a creepy sensation when he thought about the other person's face and voice.

As a straightforward and unyielding person like Zhao Xu, it's difficult for him to accept such things. However, he quickly shifted his attention to the arrangement for Elliot's next move.

In the rest of the day's itinerary, he needed to carefully examine Elliot and see what kind of role he could play. After getting the divine fragments, Zhao Xu would have to build some basic frameworks. Looking at Elliot's mixed emotions, half of which were conflicted and half of which were relieved, Zhao Xu couldn't help but smile to himself.

In this world, there's no such thing as having multiple boats to sail. Within his own authority, Zhao Xu had promised Elliot a job with a subsidy, which effectively severed the connection between Elliot and their original team. Moreover, since Zhao Xu had controlled Elliot's itinerary for today, they had missed the best time for explanation.

The original team, which had been punished by Zhao Xu, naturally harbored resentment towards him. If Elliot were to be used by Zhao Xu, they would definitely not welcome him with open arms as before. Who knows if Elliot had turned into an insider?

That's why Zhao Xu deliberately used this method to force Elliot to completely turn to his side. This was also the reason why Zhao Xu had asked Elliot to notify him.

At this moment, the students in the classroom were mostly shaking with wet clothes, even those wearing waterproof jackets. They were no match for the intensity of the "rain and snow storm" spell, and the rainwater was pouring down their necks.
Here is the translation of the text:

Arthur's rules are many, but one rule remains unbroken throughout history: when someone who is stronger than you explains the rules and moral principles to you, you can only accept them with a humble attitude.

After completing the formalities with Elton, Zhao Xu led his opponent to prepare for their next destination, which was Peter's family.

In today's class, a total of five students were absent, including four who were exceptional, at least according to Zhao Xu's mental notes, he could find the voices of famous legendary wizards by tracing the bloodline of their opponents.

Many families, even those of the second generation of magic goddesses, had already begun to operate in Mistral, directly witnessing the history of the three generations of magic goddesses.

However, Zhao Xu's current goal was to find Peter, who had once been an apprentice wizard.

As a normal person, it would take ten years to complete the wizardry apprentice course, but Peter had completed it in just two years. Although he was not as talented as the true geniuses, he was among the top students in his class.

What was strange was that Peter had abandoned his opportunity to become a wizard due to mental illness before the awakening ceremony, and then floated to Mistral to pursue a career as a civil servant. The academy pitied Peter's potential and directly assigned him to the "mentor" training class for the sons of influential families.

Peter had indeed lived up to expectations, and according to the data, he would be promoted to Level 1 Mentor in this month. So, his absence from class was actually approved by the school.

Zhao Xu wanted to gather some clean-cut young men, so he naturally came to see Peter.
After reading the praise about Peter from the student's file, Zhao Xu turned to look at Elliot, who was sitting next to him in the carriage. His face had softened slightly after going through the turmoil.

"How did you feel when you interacted with him?" Zhao Xu asked directly, the carriage just having passed over a sharp stone, causing it to shake slightly.

Elliot raised an eyebrow slightly when he heard the question. "To be honest, I didn't have much interaction with him, but he got along well with everyone. It's just that when he decided not to become a wizard, everyone felt a sense of understanding."

Zhao Xu asked sharply, "Why did you frown?"

Elliot hesitated for a moment before continuing, "I'm just too close to him, and it's like those painful memories will start to resurface."

Zhao Xu nodded silently, but his heart had already crossed out Peter as an option.

At present, he would rather choose someone foolish than someone with a complicated background. If Arthur's ordinary people, educated individuals were scarce, he could only choose from the average-level academic institution in Mistral City first. He didn't have the luxury of waiting for common people to receive sufficient education, so he had to take the easy way out. This was the reason for choosing Elliot, who was sensitive and had a simple background.

However, after hearing Elliot's evaluation, Zhao Xu had already mentally given up on Peter as a candidate. Elliot had experienced a traumatic event at home, and some mysterious related feelings, and had received "mentor" training, which made him more sensitive than others.
Despite Zhao Xu's determination, he still had to visit Eliton in person to verify his judgment on the matter. As the coachman hastily reined in the horses, Zhao Xu and Eliton stepped down from the carriage one by one. After Zhao Xu exchanged a few words with the coachman responsible for driving the carriage for the academy, he allowed Eliton to leave first.

As winter had already begun in Mistral, pedestrians would often wrap themselves in their outerwear when walking on the streets. Similarly, the small two-story house with a courtyard where Peter's family lived had its doors and windows tightly shut.

Zhao Xu walked up to the iron gate, lightly knocking on the visit bell above. The bell's vibration principle would cause the bell inside to ring, informing the owner of a visitor's arrival. However, Zhao Xu could only faintly hear the sounds coming from inside the house, but no one came to open the door.

Houses with red-painted walls, similar in style to those on Earth, were very popular among the middle class and were located near the central region. As a result, most people living in such a house could afford to have servants. Even without sending a formal invitation, the owner would have already lost face after the sixth time the bell rang inside.

Having faced many turbulent situations, Zhao Xu's brow furrowed gradually.
