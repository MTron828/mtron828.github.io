Chapter 463: The Real Culprit

At this moment, the dignified Freyel, who holds the most esteemed position in the city of Auroria, carefully examines Zhao Xu and others from head to toe. He finds it hard to believe, yet he cannot help but accept the truth.

In reality, even if the mysterious young wizard claims to be the nephew of a giant from Mistral, Freyel and the others will not be surprised by this.

The reason is that the other party's age is simply too young.

Generally speaking, those who are appointed as the leader of a local chapter by the Wizarding Association may not necessarily be the strongest in the area.

However, they must be trusted by the Association and have the ability to coordinate the relationships between local wizards. Therefore, the selection of the leader of the local chapter is crucial.

This requires the leader to have sufficient prestige and power, which is why many times the Association selects candidates from deep- rooted local wizards who have spent many years building relationships.

Additionally, the local chapter leader must also bear the responsibility of training new apprentices and sending talents to Mistral.

If the leader is not up to the task, it may lead to a disruption in the wizarding talent pipeline in a whole region.

Therefore, the Wizarding Association has developed a reliable talent selection program over the centuries.

As for the town of Starfall, although it's a small town, Freyel is clear that establishing a local chapter of the Wizarding Association is crucial.

Occasionally, the Association may have one or two young and talented individuals take on the role of leader.
Here is the translation of the text:

However, instead of selecting an experienced "old patriarch" who has opened up new territories, they chose a newcomer, which is unprecedented in a thousand years.

This is already a special exception within the special exception of promotion.

No matter how the scions of the association's giants want to make an exception, they cannot withstand the pressure from above.

The association is willing to waste countless magical resources at the local level rather than compromise on the selection of the chairman.

Therefore, Mistral, the head of the association, cannot imagine the extent to which the man's talent is strong, his connections are deep, and he is able to get a green light from the association's headquarters.

"This is the same person who successfully entered the meteorite pit, also known as the 'Elder's Palace', isn't it?" a player who was sitting in the guard line exclaimed.

Suddenly, everyone's gaze was fixed on Zhao Xu.

This person, wearing a shining star-brocade cloak, seemed to have gained an endless charm, as if he was radiating light.

"Why, is he really this strong?" the reinforcements from the Orus City Guard also exclaimed in surprise.

For them, the biggest event in recent years was undoubtedly the mysterious meteorite explosion that occurred in the Twilight Forest before the big snowstorm.

Especially, the area affected by the explosion covered a radius of nearly 50 kilometers, and the explosion's most severe center region, which left a crater with a diameter of about 1-2 kilometers, was comparable in power and scale to the largest meteor shower in history.
Here is the translation of the text:

As the thick fog and haze lingered for days, unable to disperse, and the threat of the dark forces loomed, this explosion became the "hot news" in the Northern Alliance, and even the villagers who were unaware of the situation heard about it.

Moreover, various forces and organizations around them communicated with the Northern Alliance and sent personnel to the explosion site for investigation.

However, if it weren't for the sudden and mysterious ascension of the Aizhou Palace, which possessed the higher-grade artifact "Divine Breath," the team leader who was guarding it would have had to wait a few more days to rotate his duties.

Although the Aizhou Palace seemed to have left the continent and returned to the heavens, the ripples it caused were still resonating.

At this moment, when the aura of the artifact and the gaze of Zhao Xu converged, the people present suddenly felt that the "Chancellor" had no problems at all.

At the same time, the "Summer Solstice" mage, who had ascended to the Aizhou Palace that night, was also becoming increasingly rational and reasonable in the face of the many attempts to steal by the "bandits."

Only someone with such innate talent could coordinate such a feat.

The other players present were all hesitant to ask Zhao Xu, who was said to be a fellow player, about this, but dared not speak out due to the rules.

"Do not speculate about this matter," Freyr immediately interrupted the crowd's guesses and gazes. "The alliance's high-ranking officials, the wizard's association, and major churches have all sent investigation teams. We will remain silent until the final conclusion is reached."

After that, Freyr humbly invited Zhao Xu and the others onto his luxurious carriage.

Freyr had just realized the opportunity had arrived!

As for Zhao Xu, who was planning to take advantage of his relationship with Freyr, he didn't hesitate to directly invite the four-person team onto the carriage.
Here is the translation of the text:

"I didn't expect to run into 'Summer' the mage here. Your achievements in the Sunset Forest have spread throughout the Northern Alliance, and when the department directors found out, they were all surprised by the strength of the mage you are. Freydel handed a cup of freshly brewed hot tea to Zhao Xu and said with respect.

"Are you saying that Freydel, sir, had friends who participated in the event that night?" Zhao Xu asked with a smile.

"No, I'm sure not," Freyel quickly shook his head.

He was clear about it; when the name "Summer" suddenly emerged, everyone in the room was at a loss for words.

After the announcement at the "Palace of the Elders", the high-ranking officials of the alliance learned of the underground organization's plans to plunder and plunder, but they didn't know the details of this Summer mage. Therefore, they quietly withdrew the guards and sent them away.

After all, this Summer mage, as a real mage, has limited endurance. Even the strongest mage will eventually fall. So in that short time, the high-ranking officials of the alliance reacted by observing the situation.

If this Summer mage died and the artifact was stolen, then as the dominant force in the alliance, they would be the most likely to retrieve the artifact. However, no one expected that Summer the mage would suddenly take a stand, directly ending all unnecessary conversations.

"There was no right, after all, it was like a blind man in the dark, no one knew each other. I was just firing wildly, killing my way out of the encirclement," Zhao Xu pretended to be bold, constantly scanning Freyel's expression, as if trying to read the intentions of the Tangde leader at that time."
Here is the translation:

It can be said that when Zhao Xu heard the announcement, he had a clear understanding of the evil underground forces hidden in the darkness, including the thoughts of the high-ranking officials of the entire Northern Alliance.

Therefore, he was able to make a resolute decision to take action.

Because he was crystal clear that if his magical power couldn't suppress the opponent's magical strength and attack, he would be the one to lose.

"By the way, are you really the one who obtained the sacred artifact 'Divine Breath'?"

Ferrel, who was also a seasoned veteran, quickly sensed Zhao Xu's attitude through their brief conversation.

However, before the conversation went deeper, Ferrel decided to bring up this topic first, and regardless of how the other person responded, he would be prepared to counterattack.

Meanwhile, the white dragon Sylphrena, who had been transformed alongside Zhao Xu, had been staring at him with wide eyes since Zhao Xu introduced himself as "Xun Xia".

It was as if Sylphrena, who had lived for over 300 years, had finally encountered someone with a powerful "connection" like Arthur's.

Originally, Sylphrena had been feeling down and sorrowful due to his enslavement and the constant struggles with his life and death. However, he suddenly felt a surge of energy and his muscles became more robust.

This made Sylphrena unable to resist the urge to perform a few impressive muscle poses in front of everyone, just like a bodybuilder.

After all, his impression of those human strongmen was that they would often make such poses to showcase their strength. As the great white dragon, the future Duke of the Dragon Clan, Sylphrena naturally wanted to make a good impression.

It was unclear whether he could get a spot in the "Magician's Association" at this "Xun Xia's" place.

As for the white-eyed onlookers in the carriage, Sylphrena naturally ignored them.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xǔ, too, didn't bother with the foolish White Dragon posing in a fitness pose, as long as the other party didn't expose the girls by taking off their pants. He had seen this kind of thing many times before.

As for the issue of "Freyr" in front of him, Zhao Xǔ, as a seasoned expert in official dealings, directly asked: "Is it possible that Mr. Freyr wants to make a deal with me?"
"Do you have a hidden interest in the sacred breath?"
"Or do you know the significance of its value?"

Freyr quickly flashed a fake smile and said: "Not at all. You, Zhong Xiaojie, should also know my identity."

"It's mainly because my brother-in-law, Tang De, who is currently the leader of the alliance, has recently had his nephew killed by a mysterious person, and his soul has also been destroyed. So, I want to see if the divine artifact can't break through the possibility and find a way to revive him, or provide some clues about the enemy."

"So, Mr. Zhong Xiaojie, if you have this divine artifact, we're not asking you for the divine artifact, which is a priceless gift from heaven. We just hope you can lend us a hand."

"Don't worry, Mr. Zhong Xiaojie. As long as you help us with the divine artifact, no matter whether we succeed or not, we will deduct a certain proportion of the reward from the 'ransom' paid by Tang De's nephew."

Hearing these words, Zhao Xǔ's face turned awkward. Viola, who was standing beside him, also lowered her head quietly.

If Freyr hadn't brought up Tang De's nephew, Zhao Xǔ would have almost forgotten about this matter.
Here is the translation of the text:

Not long ago, when they searched for the nest of that mutated scorpion, they found the mysterious copper box of Ernest, which was actually the dowry of Annyino. At that time, Zhao Xu encountered a group of cavalry blocking the entrance to the cave, and it was obvious that the opponent was controlling those mutated scorpions. The situation escalated quickly, and naturally, it was not a good idea.

As a result, Zhao Xu and Vivian killed everyone.

As a result, the man in front of him, Fryel, asked if this "murderer" had any magic items that could help find the murderer? The reward was something he really wanted.

But it was not easy to get.

Wasn't it better to frame their enemy, Glazt, and take revenge?

No.

The leader of the Tangde tribe, who was standing behind him, was actually the devil king. Could he recognize this account?

Zhao Xu suddenly felt a headache.
