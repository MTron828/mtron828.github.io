Chapter 581: The Secret of Crossing the Day

"Ah, seeing a perfect being completely crushed your confidence, how does it feel?"

A clear and gentle female voice echoed from behind Zhao Xu.

Zhao Xu was taken aback and turned around, asking in surprise, "Teacher?"

An Ti Noya smiled mischievously and asked, "Are you surprised to see me?"

Zhao Xu just shook his head, "Not really, I just feel a bit strange."

"Although I'm only your mentor in the magical sense, the traditional method of the Floating City is to teach by example. Besides imparting knowledge, it also includes emotional guidance to prevent you from going astray. So, you can talk to me directly about anything."

"Frankly, your recent work looks very enthusiastic. You've transmitted to over a hundred places in just one day, while even a normal mage would have long since exhausted themselves."

Zhao Xu finally realized that he had not experienced any aftereffects from using his magic, as if eating and drinking naturally.

This special finding caught his attention.

This meant that even if other mages had potential, it was unlikely that they could achieve the same level of accomplishment as him?

In the short week, except for a few specific goals that took some time, for most "magical geniuses", Zhao Xu would chat with them for a few sentences and then use his magic to read their minds and memories, understanding everything from their birth to their behavior after crossing the day.
Here is the translation:

All the things that have happened in the past, such as lying to get a candy as a child, secretly disposing of evidence of wrongdoing, and even wetting the bed at the age of nine, were all laid bare before Zhao Xu's eyes.

He even went too far, using the "memory modification" technique to edit a memory that lasted no more than five minutes and then implanted it.

Or, he could directly call upon the "Compendium of the Nine Rings" to cast the "composition of memory" spell.

This spell was so taboo that even Arthur would not allow it to be spread.

It could erase memories, implant new ones, and even recreate a person's personality. It was a power that ordinary people could hardly imagine.

"I thought to myself, 'Can I do better?' when I saw the suffering of the masses."

This short week was the peak of Zhao Xu's reputation and status.

Although he was not a prominent figure in Arthur's eyes, he was not insignificant in the eyes of many forces.

As long as he was not a legend, he was nothing more than a insignificant figure.

But in the entire global forces, Zhao Xu's branch was undoubtedly the most powerful and had the largest population.

It was so powerful that other forces would have to join forces to resist the pressure from Zhao Xu's branch.

However, this week was also the week when Zhao Xu saw the most corpses and wept the most tears.

There were corpses of all ages, even more than he had seen in Arthur.

In the wilderness, the dead would automatically transform into undead creatures, which could only be cremated by fire.

So, during this period, the flames used to burn corpses in each base never stopped burning, and even the people who transported corpses had become numb.
Here is the translation of the text:

"This one, you don't need to worry about it," Anxiya shook her head and said.

"Do you think you should give up the initial safety and connect the crossing with the upper layer?" Anxiya asked curiously.

"Not necessarily, but it seems that I may have a better way to handle it now," Zhao Xu said with a hint of suspicion.

From the outside, he seemed like a god, untouchable and unchallengeable.

But only after experiencing it firsthand could one know the inner turmoil of being in a high position.

Even the choice that concerned the fate of humanity, which made the naturally optimistic Wang Qingwei worry.

"It won't happen," Anxiya said, looking at Zhao Xu's back, making a direct statement.

"What kind of magic do you use every day at least four times?" Zhao Xu said, bringing back memories.

"Prayer magic, miracle magic, and memory recording..." Anxiya said, repeating herself unconsciously.

"Ah, memory recording," Anxiya said, referring to the magic that was basically used by Zhao Xu on those geniuses with extreme personalities.

It seemed that fate recognized that those who did not go mad would not become saints. Among the talented mages, the proportion of those with abnormal abilities was not small.

Even yesterday, Zhao Xu saw in the memory of a young boy with exceptional talent in the spirit of the dead that he had killed small animals since childhood and even preserved them as specimens.

Especially that kind of cold-blooded mentality to kill small animals, even Zhao Xu, who was capable of slaughtering thousands of people, was shocked in his heart.
Here is the translation of the text:

So, after spending a long time on "memory manipulation", he uses it every day, even borrowing over twenty "memory scrolls" from Anxinyao. In comparison, a set of crystal lens materials worth only 500 gold coins is insignificant in evaluating the value of this skill.

Zhao Xun is not a scribe of the Wisdom Heart, so he has not engraved this skill deeply in his heart.

However, the mighty power of the skill has already penetrated Zhao Xun's heart, and he can easily recall it without any effort.

"The first type is memory erasure, which can erase any memory of a target's experience, including knowledge of special practices, people, and places."
The first ability of memory manipulation is that Zhao Xun can make anyone "forget" and become a blank slate.

This is already a top-level superpower on earth.

"The second type is memory implantation, which can create any fake memories in someone's mind, including becoming friends with enemies or events that never occurred. He can even implant memories of betrayal by friends, leading to rivalry."

Zhao Xun continued to say, "Just these two functions are enough to shock the world and shake the earth.

Erasing memories, implanting memories. Saying too much, Zhao Xun can already control a person's life.

He doesn't even need to use the "hypnotic spell" to influence someone's mind, and he can make someone fall deeply in love with him.

As long as Zhao Xun likes someone, he can implant mutual affection in their memory, and even recreate a past that never existed.

Even if he has the leisure to do so, he can influence the people closest to the target, and even create a non-existent "husband" role out of thin air.
Here is the translation of the text:

"The third type is forgetting, which can erase up to half of one's levels, manifesting in the loss of professional knowledge and training experience, and this effect cannot be restored by the 'Restoration' spell."

"The fourth type is 'Personality Implantation', which can change one's allegiance, faith, values, and personal characteristics."

Once this spell is used, it will directly turn a benevolent priest into an evil one, causing the target to lose all priestly abilities. Even a top-level priest who can perform the Nine-Ring Divine Art will become a mere 17th-level civilian.

"The final type is Triggered Predestination. It can specify that a certain memory of the target will change or be removed in special circumstances."

After Zhao Xu finished explaining the five uses, An Tiya also nodded slightly.

"Generally speaking, the effects of scripted memories are permanent, unless a special event is set to terminate the effect."

"Before the Great Disaster, the 'Higher Restoration' spell of the Seven-Ring and the 'Prayer' spell of the Nine-Ring can remove the effects of scripted memories without condition. After that, the difficulty of solving it will increase significantly, and even describing the process of modifying memories is unclear, so it is impossible to truly remove it from the root. This is also one of the few spells that have been strengthened rather than weakened after the Great Disaster."

As An Tiya spoke, she gazed deeply at Zhao Xu.

"Zhong Xia, or should I say, Zhao Xu. You should know that I won't engage in a boring reminiscence about scripted memories with you here without a reason."

"I understand," Zhao Xu nodded slightly.

"The spell is still so powerful, not to mention the nearly limitless divine power."

"The people I can turn to for help have already been sealed with the last leak."

Note: Please note that the translation is in Simplified Chinese, and I followed the rules you provided.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Like Tencent, which suddenly announced the development of a game, but then ignored it and didn't even bother to harvest player engagement. This is a mentality that says that charging money makes you strong, which is a basic concept that shows that the gods' influence on Earth is far beyond my imagination."

"As for the planning of those games that transcend dimensional boundaries, it's clear that they didn't reach the peak. This further shows that this game has never had any human participation from the beginning to the end."

Zhao Xu's thoughts became increasingly clear as he continued to speak.

"A game company is like this, so what about a country?"

"There is no way for humans on Earth to control or manipulate the dimensional boundary, facing the effects of 'influencing the mind' and 'coercion', it's like being hit by a dimensional attack."

"So even if I say something, nothing will happen."

"No," Anniya shook her head, "saying it will make you disappear, it's a predetermined rule from the beginning."

"So, Zhong Xia, you've just revealed the secret, which is indeed a cautious move. However, no matter how cautious you are, you're ultimately sealing your own fate."

Anniya's face remained calm, but her words were filled with a sense of death.

Unfortunately, it was too late.

Zhao Xu's expression also changed, realizing that he was already walking on a tightrope without knowing it.

After Zhao Xu finally showed signs of attention, Anniya continued to reveal the shocking secret from a week ago.

"I'm sure you also know that the 32-day-old child is born, unlike the average 12-day-old civilian. This is also the reason why players can quickly level up, because their six-dimensional quality is far superior to that of others."
Here is the translation of the text:

"When you were back then, even if you could publicly disclose this secret, the people of the Earth would still bring nothing but some survival knowledge. But in the vast and desolate land where negative energy was scattered, the significance was extremely limited.

Therefore, what's more crucial is your account itself, including the 'dual elite' account you once obtained. As a result, your action of letting more people log in to the game was, in essence, destroying the stability of the entire Earth's Arthur Channel.

You might let the channel collapse at any moment, which would have catastrophic consequences. Behind it, Arthur would have to spend years rebuilding the 'channel'. At that time, Arthur had been waiting for centuries, but the Earth, which would be affected by the cosmic destruction, couldn't wait.

As Anshen said, spreading her arms wide, as if embracing the fresh air of the vast sky, 'Therefore, Zhao Xu, you almost became the indirect candidate for the destruction of the Earth.'

At this moment, Zhao Xu's heart was beating rapidly in his chest.

He shook his head several times, but then let out a sigh.

Saving or destroying the world were just a hair's breadth apart for him.

"What happened at the end?" Zhao Xu suddenly raised his doubts, recalling the incident a month ago when he failed to cross over.

"What's the last one?" Anshen laughed, "Why did you pre-cross over?"

"Because the channel was damaged," Zhao Xu said.

That's why the Wizards' Association and the gods behind the scenes couldn't wait for the Earth players to continue developing, just like the previous life game that lasted a year before crossing over.

In reality, players were stronger and more capable of saving other Earthlings, and the number of players was limited, without affecting the gods' harvesting of faith."
Here is the translation:

"The road itself is already in a state of disrepair, and we were planning to enter maintenance mode earlier. But then you notified everyone that there's a gold coin on the road, and you can imagine what happened next."

"So, did you seal the road?"

"Well, it's not that simple. We set up the seal with some leeway, so the traffic generated by your post wasn't enough to disrupt the material energy channel established by the gods and the council."

"The key point is that you almost triggered a massive earthquake."

Zhao Xu said, "At the moment when I revealed the seven prophecies?"

"No mistake, you said it. The massive fate that poured down from Arthur to the Earth and the universe almost caused the channel to burst."

"Even if it was repaired, humanity would still go crazy and enter the game, and the small creek would have become a vast ocean."

At this point, Annis Nimia took a deep breath, "Therefore, we went back in time, and your information became garbled. You'll just fill in the gaps yourself, thinking you were careless and didn't notice."

"However, considering your failed posting, it's natural to convert to another way. If you keep struggling with me, the channel might still collapse, so the gods directly cut off the channel."

Annis Nimia said, "However, these are small problems. The real scary thing is..."

"When the gods urgently closed the channel, it also triggered the rhythm of fate."

"The gods also heard the next sentence of the forgotten prophecy. It's the same sentence that made the gods completely lose their connection with Arthur. That's why I couldn't contact you in this one-month period."

"Sylvana, I've heard that 'the gods are not in July' prophecy, but I don't know how it will be fulfilled until you triggered it."
