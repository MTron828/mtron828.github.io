Chapter 551: Arthur, True Existence

"Wow, this sunset is truly beautiful," King Qiongwei said, standing on the rooftop of the completed Association Tower, gazing out at the scenery.

As she looked out, her eyes took in the entire district of the Association's residence, with over a dozen perfectly constructed buildings, a large courtyard, and a high wall surrounding the entire area. The nearby residents were isolated from the outside world.

The Northern Alliance Association had sent a large number of alchemists to perform the final enchantment on the entire district. The warning spell on the wall was already in place.

Zhao Xu and King Qiongwei were currently standing in the highest building in the small town, which was also the headquarters of the Association of Magic in the town. All the subordinate offices would be set up in this tower.

Their location was also the best spot for stargazing and enjoying the view.

"You want to go down?" Zhao Xu suddenly asked.

"The sunset on Earth, we can see it again tomorrow," King Qiongwei replied, her black hair flowing smoothly, her eyes gazing out at the red horizon.

"Yes," Zhao Xu nodded, "I feel like there are too many things we haven't experienced on Earth, and it would be a pity if we didn't go back."

"Just thinking about being a mage and being able to create something, it feels like there's no point in making it," King Qiongwei said.

Starting from the lowest-level creation spells, such as creating food and water, the entire creation system unfolded like a chapter.

For example, with the four-ring creation spell, plants without life could be made into products. With the five-ring creation spell, minerals could also be created, but their duration was limited.
Here is the translation of the text:

Only when you have mastered the true art of creation at the eighth ring, can you create any kind of durable item, including a bottle of frozen cola.

"So, you're sure you're going to post it tonight?" Wang Congwei asked.

"More or less," Zhao Xu nodded.

"Tomorrow is a whole day, which is the time I leave for my family to register for the game account," Zhao Xu said.

Zhao Xu's eyes flashed a hint of determination at this moment. "As for how many people can achieve this, that's not something I can control."

"Won't there be more severe consequences?" Wang Congwei immediately read the uncertainty from Zhao Xu's tone.

Zhao Xu heard this and couldn't help but smile wryly. "Ah, Congwei, whoever marries you will have to hide nothing from anyone."

As for the matter of energy channels, this is a big deal, so Zhao Xu just nodded slightly without saying much.

Unexpectedly, Wang Congwei still guessed it out.

"I don't like men," Wang Congwei lightly brushed her hair, "I've already drawn pictures of all my dolls and stored them away. When I reach the high ring, I'll use the creation art to replicate them all."

"This..."

Zhao Xu finally understood that the other party had recently been studying in front of the desk for no reason.

"You can actually use the life assembly to replicate these dolls, and it's not necessary to use resin either."

"I don't like life assembly," Wang Congwei shook her head, "but life assembly is quite fascinating."

"Alright, let's not get too carried away,"

Zhao Xu sighed. "Now that it's come to this, I won't hide it from you, and I'm sure you've already guessed it."
Here is the translation of the text:

"The energy channel itself is fragile and cannot simultaneously bear the possibility of every human on Earth passing through it. In fact, according to my estimation, it can only accommodate a maximum of 1% of the total capacity. That's why Arthur's game players can only handle 60 million registrations. This is also the reason why Zhao Xu didn't make an official announcement.

"Can you really not mobilize the registration of over 60 million people?" Wang Qingwei analyzed.

"No, so on the night of July 1st, I will release the final blow. By then, most people will have obtained the brain dome headgear, and all they need to do is register an account. With a good heart, it can be solved within a few hours," Zhao Xu said, his tone becoming increasingly solemn.

"So, from 8 to 10 pm on the night of July 1st, I will release that prophecy, and everyone will feel the sensation of change. At that time, the surge of traffic will overwhelm the channel, and I won't be able to control it. Everyone will have to rely on their own luck," Zhao Xu said.

"Have you confirmed the specific time for crossing?" Wang Qingwei asked again.

"Yes, it's July 1st at the stroke of midnight," Zhao Xu replied.

"Well, I'll wait anxiously from 8-9 pm for the dawn of the meteor shower to arrive," Wang Qingwei nodded, "and by then, I won't be joining this commotion."

She could already imagine the reaction of everyone being shocked by that prophecy, how huge the response would be.

To put it bluntly, it's a must-play game. And Zhao Xu is getting anxious because time is running out, which might directly lead to chaos at the end of the world.

"'Summer solstice, we will succeed,' Wang Qingwei suddenly took a deep breath and looked at Zhao Xu.

"No, I also have no doubt about this," Zhao Xu replied with a solemn expression."
Here is the translation of the text:

"Let's go through all these together, Zhen Wei and I."

"Okay."

...and so on until midnight, when Zhao Xu took off his brain-controlled helmet and found that everyone in the dormitory was already asleep, lightly snoring.

Even Liu Hanqiang, who had just argued with him, failed to return to the dormitory this time.

Zhao Xu quietly climbed down from the bed and turned on the computer. The screen lit up, casting a faint glow on his face.

Zhao Xu directly navigated to the "forum page".

He looked at the username "East City Rui" and couldn't help but smile slightly.

Before leaving the earth, he wanted to bid farewell to everything on the forum. Zhao Xu lightly tapped the keyboard, thinking for a moment before posting the message.

"I am East City Rui, also known as Star Shadow and Summer Solstice. You can call me the Lord of the Small Town, or the President of the Association, or a fifth-ring mage.

However, please allow me to tell you that this is not an April Fool's joke.

As players began to enter the professional training system, they became aware of the unparalleled realism of this game. Moreover, the content of the game is self-contained and self-closed, with no loopholes.

Some players have analyzed the magical knowledge fragments within the game, while others believe that this is actually a deep-level government project, using the game to debug and collect data.

As a result, players have been arguing about this for a long time, and even the official response has been absent. This has made the game both fascinating and mysterious.

We even ask ourselves, is it reasonable for a network game to lack the most basic balance in the game?"
Here is the translation of the text:

Or, to put it another way, why do some people not level up, but can still soar to great heights just because of an NPC's favor?

Or, to put it even more bluntly, are these so-called NPCs too realistic, and are they actually just human customer service agents pretending to be behind the scenes?

Here, I want to tell you all a real answer that can explain all the speculations.

That is to say, Arthur, he truly exists.

And, I have to tell you all a message that is both despairing and hopeful, representing death and rebirth, the end of the world and the new world coexisting - the earth will be hit by a meteor in 24 hours, and afterwards, all citizens will transcend to the Arthur world.
