Chapter 572: The Difficult Choice, Clothing Crisis

As the savory aroma wafted through the air, even if the two players were brave and could withstand hunger, they couldn't help but sniffle. Suddenly, a beam of white light flashed through the window, announcing the impending thunderstorm.

This startled the three of them, and they hastily turned their gaze away from the table of exquisite food that Zhao Xu had conjured up using his magic.

In this room, despite the mediocre soundproofing, the cacophony of raindrops pounding against the roof and the howling wind outside was palpable. The small cottage, however, remained steadfast, resisting the external forces and becoming a rare oasis of dryness in the midst of the tempest.

In contrast, countless refugees were being ravaged by the rain outside, struggling to survive on a daily basis with barely enough food to fill their bellies. Even most of the refugee camps were frantically trying to salvage food, neglecting their own safety.

Zhao Xu didn't need to think twice; he knew that countless disaster victims would be begging to take shelter in Yanlin's house from the rain. Even if Zhao Xu had stockpiled enough tent materials, he would still be overwhelmed by the sheer scale of the refugee crisis.

Zhao Xu left Yanlin, freeing him from the burden of having to make decisions like Wang Qingwei, who would have to decide who could live and who could enter the shelter.

"You won't eat, and after an hour, it will disappear on its own, all for nothing," Zhao Xu said, shrugging his shoulders.

The simple chair had been transformed into a luxurious one by the hero banquet's magic, with invisible servants waiting at each position to provide service.
Here is the translation:

"After finishing this 'Hero's Feast', all diseases, nausea, and negative states will recover. For the next 12 hours, you will be immune to toxins and invulnerable to harm. If you drink the final cup of wine, you will also gain 11-18 temporary hit points (1D8+10). Additionally, for the next 12 hours, you will gain a +1 level bonus to morale and immunity to fear effects.

As Zhao Xu began to speak, the originally ordinary banquet, with its 17 seats, seemed to be attracting the three people, despite their initial hesitation.

"This is too extravagant. Eating all this food would be a waste for just four of us," warrior Bai Sha said apologetically.

The immunity to toxins, temporary hit points, morale bonus, and immunity to fear effects all sounded too good to be true.

At the moment, the wilderness was not without earth-crossers who attempted to hunt outside. However, only the animals that could survive in the wilderness were the "violent version" or the "skeletal version" or the "flesh-eating zombie version".

The plants on the ground were also laced with various toxins, and one wrong move could lead to instant death.

Therefore, the "hunting" tradition was temporarily only open to players.

Warrior Bai Sha spoke politely, but his heart was already yielding.

Zhao Xu remained expressionless, as the Hero's Feast was a level 1 spell, and the caster's level was 17.

After Zhao Xu took his seat, the other three people also quietly walked over and joined Zhao Xu in enjoying the feast.

"It's really delicious, who would have thought that the ingredients in Arthur's cuisine could reach this level," warrior Bai Sha said, his appetite suddenly increasing, especially after Zhao Xu told him that the food would disappear in an hour. He ate with reckless abandon, afraid of wasting the food."
Here is the translation of the text:

Strictly speaking, players who crossed over didn't need to eat, so they had no experience of Arthur's food, even if they drank something, it was as refreshing as plain water.

When they actually crossed over, everyone's initial conditions were extremely harsh, and naturally, they couldn't enjoy any delicious food.

"Aah, I should have become a mage when I was younger," the warrior said, biting into a slice of braised pork, and his heart was filled with a sense of satisfaction.

In the wilderness, players could bring non-perishable food with them, which was a terrifying amount of prepared supplies.

As they didn't need to eat, most players didn't even bring water bottles with them.

So, the warrior's dry rations over the past two days could be considered the delicacy of "the wilderness of death" now, and only those who had dry rations could enjoy it. Others couldn't even dream of it.

"Don't be silly," Autumn Rain, the female mage, said with a shake of her head. "Do you know how many levels it takes to create such a feast?"

"Moreover, if you really reach this level, you won't waste a spell slot to eat a meal like this," Autumn Rain said, lowering her head.

She had already realized that they had encountered a terrifying existence that would make anyone tremble. Without the thought of revival stones, they wouldn't dare use a six-ring spell.

Arthur's everything was now real, and players' status had indeed risen among ordinary people on Earth.

However, for Arthur's strong, they became even more humble, no longer having the bold and fearless attitude of having revival stones.

Because the mysterious mage in front of them could kill them with just a thought. Even if they had a quirk, Autumn Rain had to stay behind as a slave.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu laughed and said that his "Ten Thousand Laws Book" had a daily limit of four magical skills, and if he didn't use them, it would be a waste. Therefore, Zhao Xu would eat the four meals of "breakfast", "lunch", "dinner", and "supper" every day.

It's like having a transparent spinning top that can last 24 hours without eating, what's the difference between that and taking oral liquid food? Zhao Xu had many magical skills, so he naturally used them to enjoy life.

As Annie said, taking an extra step would make her feel exhausted, and it would be better to use a magical skill to make it easier. So, Zhao Xu's friends would find it expensive to buy a membership for a few hundred yuan, but they would feel it was worth it when eating a delicious meal.

The Hero Feast skill is essentially a way to complete a meal within an hour to experience the effects. Zhao Xu couldn't eat for four hours a day, so he would just eat a few bites at noon and night, just to appreciate the flavor.

He was one of the few people who used this skill, and he was truly using it just to eat a delicious meal.

"You're really exaggerating," a young man, Bǐ Wú, said with a sigh, "I've been feeling that my chronic asthma has been gradually subsiding, including the small skin diseases that have left my body."

"It's no wonder my sister told me that Arthur's first productivity is magic," the young man said, shaking his head, "but I was too busy taking the TOEFL to mock my sister, wasting family money on games."

As he sighed deeply.

"Don't be discouraged," the female mage, Qiǔ Yu, patted Bǐ Wú's shoulder and consoled him, "You can start again, and with your sister's help, you'll definitely become a professional soon."

"No doubt," the warrior, Bái Shā, said, looking at the two of them, before continuing to eat his food.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

After the rain subsided slightly, Zhao Xu handed over his contact information to the three people. He instructed them to contact Na Ti Luoya if necessary, and he would come over and provide assistance, such as helping Na Ti Luoya return to Maka. The three people naturally had absolute faith in Zhao Xu's promise.

Zhao Xu was also holding a small umbrella and silently left the small cottage, continuing his journey.

After the torrential rain had swept through the desolate wasteland, the originally misty sky looked much fresher, but there was still a flash of thunder in the sky, making people wonder if another massive storm was about to arrive.

Meanwhile, Zhao Xu was riding his shadow steed, relying on his magical skills, which had become master-level after amplification. He could easily control the horse with his legs, making it move according to his will.

At the same time, he was holding a bottle of iced tea in his hand. This iced tea was created by Zhao Xu using the "Four Rings" spell, which could produce items made from non-living plant components. As long as he could provide these plants as spell materials, he could create the iced tea without any processing.

Just right, the ingredients of iced tea involve caffeine, essential oils, sugar, and cola alkaloids, all of which are plant extracts. Zhao Xu used the "Super Natural" spell to bypass these spell materials, and after passing the relevant skill test, he directly created a bottle of iced tea.

The spell could originally produce 30 liters per level, and with Zhao Xu at level 33, it was equivalent to 2,800 bottles of iced tea.
Here is the translation of the text:

However, the weak effect of the creation spell could only last for an hour at each level, so Zhao Xu also didn't plan to create a functional swimming pool. When the first can of cola appeared, he cancelled the spell.

The remaining task was to use the freezing beam to complete the freezing process of the cola.

In reality, Zhao Xu had already read the minds of several people at the dining table.

This was "The fragrance of the Jia gate, the stench of the wine, and the frozen bones of the road."

Although the three people as beneficiaries did not express their views, they did not speak up.

The "removal of disease" effect that countless people had dreamed of suddenly appeared on Zhao Xu's dining table.

What they did was just knocking on the door.

This meant that at that moment, anyone who knocked on the door would receive the qualification to remove their pre-existing bodily diseases.

This gap made the young man who had been suffering from a chronic illness feel a sense of relief.

Countless people had spent their life savings to delay the onset of their illnesses, sometimes even traveling long distances to see a specialist for a clear diagnosis.

Even when their elderly relatives were severely ill, they had to spend a lot of money to have them hospitalized in a private room, or even sell everything they owned without regret.

Diseases have always been a major obstacle to human life.

They also seriously lowered the quality of life for each individual, and it was not a joke.

But in Arthur, it was easily terminated by a three-ring spell, and even an additional effect of a six-ring spell.

Zhao Xu was riding a horse, lost in thought, feeling a sense of melancholy.

At this moment, he was indeed far removed from the common people.

Within two days, he had already adopted the mentality of a superior being.

As he rode his horse, he saw that the road was filled with countless people who had failed to escape the rain and were soaked to the bone.
Here is the translation of the text:

At this moment, they only had the "hemp cloth" given by the gods, which they wore on their bodies from the beginning. After it got wet, they wanted to take it off to dry it, but since they had to expose their bodies, it was particularly embarrassing for countless women.

However, if they didn't take off the wet clothes, they had to rely on their own body heat to dry them, which was like a fantasy in the midst of the torrential rain.

This sudden rainstorm came too quickly for humans to create "hemp cloth" before it arrived. At this moment, countless women were struggling with whether to ignore their shame and take off their wet clothes.

Even if they could find a safe place, it would mean they would be exposed without clothes until their clothes were dry. A storm like this seemed to question every person's sense of shame from the very source.

"Isn't it very embarrassing? Do you want to stop all this?" Suddenly, a clear and crisp female voice came from behind Zhao Xu.
