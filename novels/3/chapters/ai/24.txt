Chapter 025 True Intelligence
As time passed, Zhao Xu finally discovered what he had been worried about.
Perhaps, he really didn't have that kind of talent.
When he wanted to play as a mage in his past life, his roommate analyzed it for him. Although mages were on the rise, it was still too difficult for a beginner like him, so he was recommended to play as a warrior.
Zhao Xu had always been unsure whether he had the talent for learning magic.
Aside from the most basic intelligence, there was some kind of talent that no one could explain.
Otherwise, in the world of Arthur, any creature with an intelligence of 11 had the qualifications to become a mage.
Even a month later, there would be over a hundred players with full 18 intelligence points who, unable to complete the beginner mage training, agreed to delete their accounts in frustration, directly reducing the number of new players choosing to be mages to rock bottom.
This time in the floating city of Mysterla, it was Zhao Xu's first time encountering mage courses.
After everyone crossed over, they all lost the privilege of deleting their accounts and starting over. Everyone had to stick with the account they had, even if it was a dead end.
So the feeling of struggling to get started made Zhao Xu feel conflicted.
It was like when the exam was almost over and he hadn't filled in the answer sheet, and he hadn't even started the last big question.
If he had to experience this bitter feeling alone, it would be fine, but Antinoya had been sitting quietly in his dorm, seemingly idle, waiting for his questions.
She didn't go anywhere, just sitting there in his dorm, teaching him like this. The feeling of someone watching you without any movement was even more uncomfortable.
If he had fully understood the structure of the spell, he might have been able to copy it, blaming his lack of success on his own "wise heart" ability. However, he had not even grasped the structure of the 19 zero-level spells. At first, Zhao Xu thought it was because the spells were not suited to his nature, but he had tried five zero-level spells and still couldn't understand them.

Anzhi Noya gave him a hint, suggesting that he feel the flow of the spellcasting process, just like calligraphy, each stroke having its own depth and subtlety. He could sense it, but still couldn't connect the dots, just like he couldn't mimic the feeling.

"Teacher, how long did you take to reach this level?" Zhao Xu finally sighed and asked Anzhi Noya about his past experiences, having already seen enough introductions from other players.

He delayed his online session by an hour to watch more strategy posts, but it was still of no use. The difference between a barrier and a path was like night and day.

"I? I was reading and copying as I went along," Zhao Xu asked.

"Understand? They are as clear as plain text to me. There's nothing to understand. It's not a first-level spell because it involves risk, so we must learn 24 hours a day to offset this risk."

"Are there no zero-level spells?" Zhao Xu continued to ask.

"There are, but they're not magic. These 19 spells are the safest and most straightforward ones we've researched, and no matter how you play them, they won't backfire."

Zhao Xu felt like he was a student who had stumbled upon a genius. He could only ask again, "So, teacher, how many years did you study magic before formally learning these zero-level spells?"

"About three years," Anzhi Noya replied.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu took a deep breath.
Others had accumulated this over three years, and he was trying to achieve this in just a week. This was also the reason why players could only use magic.
Arthur had all sorts of arcane and divine spells, and his entire life history was recorded in detail.
"Why can't I understand anything?" Zhao Xu finally asked, revealing his predicament.
Anshen smiled lightly and said, "You finally couldn't resist asking?"
"Everyone in Arthur's world can sense their character card once they reach level 1," Anshen said.
Zhao Xu nodded, and players could see their character cards even without reaching level 1.
Arthur's natives, on the other hand, could only see their character cards after reaching level 1, and only gained more modules as they leveled up.
In other words, adventurers in Arthur's world all had a character card system.
This was also the reason why they could quantize their levels, specialties, and skills.
"This has never been a secret," Anshen said.
"Your six attributes, strength, agility, constitution, charm, perception, and intelligence, can all be simulated by the system, regardless of your actual perception. So, you can simulate your attribute panel's perception value."
"However, intelligence is the only exception. The system doesn't evolve for you."
"Since your true intelligence is not 16, it's natural that you can't understand quickly."
Zhao Xu finally realized this.
Or, to put it another way, intelligence is something shared by players on both Earth and Arthur's world. Players' charm and perception are inconsistent between the two worlds, so it's understandable.
Here is the translation of the text:

But if Arthur realized that he was relatively intelligent, or that playing games made him smarter, then everything would be exposed. This is also the reason why the mage group has been stuck for so long.

It turns out that the average IQ of humans is around 10 points, with a normal distribution of 8-12 points, which is the range of most people. As for 16, 17, or 18-level intelligence, these are people who are extremely intelligent or have a photographic memory, and the number of such people is extremely rare.

Some people may never be able to learn magic, even if they set their IQ to 18 points, because the system won't help them understand unless their true IQ is above 11 points.

Currently, most people may not be able to understand this fact, but only legendary strong individuals like Noja can be clear.

"Teacher, I've accepted the fact that I'm not as smart as I thought I was, so what's the solution?" Noja smiled, as if she was very happy that Zhao Xu had acknowledged his own stupidity.

"What do you mean?" Zhao Xu asked.

"You know that when someone comes with a sword, you can just dodge it. Why do you need to be smart enough to know where it's coming from?" Zhao Xu was suddenly shocked, as if he had touched on something.

Seeing Zhao Xu's puzzled expression, Noja was clear about what he was struggling with.

"You don't have to be able to swim to navigate a river. You can sit in a boat and drift downstream."

Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu remained silent, and she could only explain it more simply, "Just follow the waves one by one, and you'll get it."

Take advantage of the situation!

Zhao Xu suddenly understood and quickly flipped to the first page of the "Compendium of Zero-Level Magic".

All additional text was forgotten by him.

His mind was only focused on those models.

Suddenly, everything became like living things, and the entire model began to change.

Zhao Xu's inner heart was dancing with his pen, writing like a dragon and snake.

"Reading Magic" was completed.
"Detection Magic" was recorded successfully.
"Dance Light" was recorded successfully as well.
...
"All Magic Tricks" were completed.

In the end, all 19 zero-level magic spells were recorded in his inner depths, like a mysterious painting flashing back and forth.

If someone was nearby, they would certainly be amazed, wondering how someone could record 19 zero-level magic spells in one breath!
