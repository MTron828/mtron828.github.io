Chapter 712: The Visitor

After receiving Zhao Xuan's instructions, the demon spider felt a shiver run down its spine as if it had been touched by its soul. It trembled slightly and said, "Okay, please follow me."

Then it deliberately moved its eight legs, actively clearing the way ahead for Zhao Xuan. However, it wasn't very good at navigation, and various spider webs entangled and sticky liquid dripped from the ceiling.

Fortunately, Zhao Xuan had the "Free Action" spell, which allowed him to ignore the entanglement effects of the spider webs, and he followed the demon spider step by step.

"You've been watching for how many years?" Zhao Xuan asked suddenly.

"About five hundred years," the demon spider replied, still moving at a brisk pace, transmitting its intentions to Zhao Xuan through its mind-reading ability.

Zhao Xuan raised an eyebrow slightly.

Immutable beings like ourselves may seem eternal, but it also means that we don't have an end to our lives or a retirement. Without any unusual disturbances, it's impossible to predict how long we'll be trapped in this way. This is a kind of permanent lifelong imprisonment.

It's the most cruel and brutal work in the world, much worse than the eternal life of the undead skeleton, which never tires.

"How many new spider species have been cultivated here?" Zhao Xuan asked again.

The demon spider replied, "There are over ten similar places like this. However, I'm not clear about the specifics. The new species here will be regularly transferred by the Wax Melting Demons."

"You're still quite talkative?" Zhao Xuan was astonished, "You really felt the power of the divine hammer in my hand at that time?"
Here's the translation:

If these deep abyssal demons are simply afraid of death, then it would be easy to deal with them. Utilizing their weaknesses and amplifying them would allow for control, which is the key strategy for mages to manipulate people's minds.

What's truly vexing is that the nature of chaos makes it difficult to grasp. Just like how a noble can deceive someone with a strategy, the orderly faction's actions can at least be predicted according to the rules. However, chaotic demons may have a hundred different solutions to the same problem.

In an instant, they can switch from being submissive to launching a fierce counterattack. There is no official correct answer.

The spider-like demon crouched down slightly and spoke slowly: "Although I can sense the power of magic, I cannot determine the specific scale. What truly makes me submit is the willpower emanating from your magic, which contains the ancient essence of the abyss. It's as if I can feel the pressure of the superior being, and I dare not resist."

Willpower?
Essence of the abyss?
Zhao Xu's gaze was icy cold.

He recalled that these abyssal demons, in their true nature, could still engage in old-fashioned bloodshed on the battlefield, more so because they were submissive to the "Lord of the Abyss".

Unless they encountered another Lord of the Abyss, they would not dare to betray. Now, it seems that the opponent is able to influence him without his realizing it, and it's as if he has absorbed the true power of the abyss.

Isn't it that he has embarked on a journey to the deepest level of the abyss, "The Bottomless Realm", and has ultimately been tainted by the true power of the abyss?

It's not just because he has a high level of charm and is handsome. Even if he unleashes the residual waves in his magic, it would make a level 10 demon spider submit. Once he truly unleashes it, wouldn't it affect the entire region?
Here is the translation of the text:

While the 11-intelligence hellhound spider is unable to react, a Baal flame demon with an IQ of nearly 20, combined with its own innate mark granted by the Abyss, may be able to react directly. They are facing a lord of the Abyss!

These Baal flame demons, however, are backed by a lord of the Abyss.

Just like a priest is backed by a deity.

This is not to say that he has been unable to cast spells on the Baal flame demons recently.

Zhao Xu couldn't help but feel the gravity of the situation.

Although the Baal flame demons from the Abyss are a high-ranking evil being, they are not always visible. However, they are not rare either!

The only consolation is that the spider queen Roselle is more inclined towards the wax-melting demon, and her status is higher than that of the Baal flame demons. Therefore, Zhao Xu is more likely to encounter special envoys from the wax-melting demon.

"Is the frequency of demonic appearances high at that location?" Zhao Xu asked cautiously.

The hellhound spider nodded, saying, "The wax-melting demon, the servant of Roselle, will periodically arrive at that location to inspect the cultivation of nearby spiders and select suitable products for offering."

It seems that this might be a bit of a problem.

Zhao Xu's eyes narrowed as he said, "The wax-melting demon is a legendary evil being I've heard of."

Before descending into the Abyss, he had thoroughly understood the detailed stats of the wax-melting demon, but he didn't delve too deeply into its background.

As he thought about this, Zhao Xu directly activated his knowledge (dimension) skill!

【Adventure Skills: Knowledge (Dimension), Search: Wax-melting Demon, Successful! Obtained the following information:】

【20th Tier Information: The wax-melting demon serves as a maid to the goddess Roselle and has received her favor and protection.】

【25th Tier Information: The wax-melting demon has the ability to transform into a green cloud-like form, a humanoid spider, a beautiful female elf, or a human, or a red-colored, tentacle-like creature.]
Here is the translation:

Information about the Wax Fusion Demon:

* Level 30: This demon has a mental shield effect that cannot be removed, making it immune to acidic, electrical, and toxic attacks. It also has resistance to cold, fire, and non-good weapon damage.
* Level 35: The Wax Fusion Demon has a vast array of magical abilities, including controlling and reading the thoughts of humans.

Zhao Xu's expression turned blank as he stared at the four search results. What's going on with the knowledge skill system, anyway? It's like it's been watered down, and it just happened to spit out the abilities of the Wax Fusion Demon. He already knew all this, of course, but it's still quite detailed. The descriptions are still unclear, though. The green mist state is probably "gasification," the human female form is "humanoid shape," and the spider-like form is "spider shape." These are all supernatural abilities of the Wax Fusion Demon.

As for the amorphous tentacle monster, this is the true nature of the Wax Fusion Demon.

The so-called "magical abilities" are actually things like detecting thoughts, controlling humans, dark magic, sacrilegious magic, advanced teleportation magic, spider magic, and stone shaping magic.

He also knows that if an opponent transforms into a humanoid form, they will be completely naked. Most will prepare armor and weapons before entering this state. On the material plane, they will tend to use this state. However, unless the Wax Fusion Demon can hide its equipment, it will not switch to other forms. Unless it is unable to use advanced teleportation magic to escape, it will only use gasification to flee, or it will use its true form to complete the kill if it feels certain of victory.

In general, Wax Fusion Demons that can control humans will usually have minions around them, and it's not difficult for them to help each other switch equipment during battles.
Here is the translation:

As Zhao Xu followed the demonic spider, he continued to gather information from it, saying, "Do you know the background of these wax fusion demons in the depths?"

The demonic spider replied, "These wax fusion demons usually appear alone in the shrines of the demonic spider, representing the demonic spider's advisors, assassins, and lovers."

"For us, or for those who worship the demonic spider, these servants are the demonic spider's proxies. Unlike us, who need to hunt for food, these wax fusion demons can obtain everything they want in most societies with a high level of civilization."

"Hmm, it's really a natural-born emperor."

"Will there be a large-scale situation?" Zhao Xu asked.

The demonic spider nodded, saying, "Yes, it is possible. At that time, they acted as guards due to the demonic spider's favoritism. They also have the ability to multitask, often holding positions such as poets, priests, or wizards. I once saw a wax fusion demon serving as a 13th-level poet, influencing King Arthur's nation on behalf of the demonic spider."

"This has really piqued my curiosity," Zhao Xu said, his thoughts slowly drifting away.

Subtly, he felt as though he sensed the mysterious implications behind the wax fusion demons, which were only 8th-level demons. It seemed that they were not natural products of the depths.

In the next instant, Zhao Xu slowly concentrated his spirit, putting his thoughts aside, as if his intangible soul was about to detach from his body.
Here is the translation of the text:

At this moment, he learned a special technique in the "Bottomless Domain" that allowed him to sense the contents of the "Tome of the Abyss" to the maximum extent, and through the exchange of consciousness, he could feel the contents of the tome.

In essence, this is also a skill evaluation, but the direction is towards the "Tome of the Abyss" rather than the "Source of Knowledge".

In an instant, a starry sky unfolded in Zhao Xu's mind, with countless stars shining brightly, forming a celestial rain that poured down, punctuating the darkness, and telling Zhao Xu—

Everything about the Wax Melt Fiend.

Zhao Xu's eyes gradually brightened.

It turns out that the Wax Melt Fiend is a special evil being from the "Bottomless Abyss" and is a typical representative of the Wax Melt Fiend species.

Or, to put it another way, they are a minority of evil beings that were created by the gods for a special purpose and were modified from the most basic "Talos" evil beings.

In the past, Lousis descended upon the Abyssal Land, captured those demons, and then gradually transformed them into the shape of Wax Melt Fiends!

Even this process remains a secret known only to the leaders of the Abyssal Land, and many of them are curious about how it was done, hoping to master this technique and create their own exclusive evil army.

Because the Wax Melt Fiend has lost all connection to the "Source" demons.

In fact, they can be considered an independent and unique evil being.

Even to some extent, they are the source themselves.

The original evil beings created by the Abyssal Land were the "Obelisk" evil beings, which even appeared before human history.

Later, during the ancient war on the Wanyuan Plains, the "Talos" evil beings replaced the current Abyssal Land's favorite children.

This history is what Zhao Xu first learned about in the "Bottomless Domain" through the whispers of the Abyss.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

Essentially, that previous war was a shadow of the struggle between chaos and order. After that, the original devil, the spider devil, and the Balroth fire devil are all evolutionary branches of the "Tathari evil devil", and as long as a deep abyss lord is willing, they can use the lord's power granted by the deep abyss to promote them. The demon that transforms into Balroth is ultimately just a thought between the deep abyss lords.

However, "Cerulian" is different.

In theory, this "Cerulian" is a new evil demon system that can continue to evolve and evolve like the "Tathari evil devil". However, it is limited by Rosie's personal abilities and has only been strengthened through part-time work.

"What level is this Cerulian that has reached this place?" Zhao Xu suddenly asked.

The spider devil replied, "It hasn't undergone any evolution, it's just the ordinary version."

"That's scary to you?"

Zhao Xu was curious, and in the deep abyss where there was no concept of hierarchy, anyone's strong arm could dominate anyone's weak arm. Once the arm weakened, it would be the time for betrayal and stabbing. But Zhao Xu somehow sensed the spider devil's extreme fear.

The spider devil continued to say, "The Cerulian enjoys dominating and cruelly torturing other living beings, even if it's facing an evil demon. The deep abyss demons deeply understand that Spider Rosie will protect her maid."

"Is that the case even on other planes?"

"No, any evil demon that dares to resist the Cerulian will be visited by the stronger subordinates of Spider Rosie, including the goddess of the abyss herself."

"Therefore, the deep abyss demons all hate and fear them."
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu's interest was even greater, as if he had discovered a new toy. "Won't there be betrayal inside the Wax Fusion Demon?" he thought to himself.

Sometimes, a team led by a Balor demon was stronger than a team led by two Balor demons. The demons oppressed their subordinates while also fearing a counterattack from their peers, as they were all obstacles to their continued ascent.

The Huntsman Spider was perplexed, saying, "It seems that there is no competitive relationship between the Wax Fusion Demons. I've seen more than one Wax Fusion Demon appear in a river-like phenomenon, and they all cooperate without complaint. For them, the company of friends is a source of joy and happiness."

But Zhao Xu's feet froze again, as his "investigation" skills, which were almost explosive, told him that there was a mysterious being lurking ahead.

Suddenly, a cold, icy laughter echoed through the air.

"It seems that I forgot to mention that in the mortal world, the Wax Fusion Demons are skilled at causing harm and using murder, conspiracy, and cunning to spread evil and chaos. They often blend in with their humanoid form and charm, making many friends. Unfortunately, demons are demons, and even their loved ones will not stop betraying each other."

Zhao Xu raised an eyebrow. "Who are you?"

The figure in the shadows was a vagrant who had fallen to the ground.
