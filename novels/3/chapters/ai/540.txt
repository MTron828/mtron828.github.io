Chapter 541: Peak of the 9th Level

"Ah?! I'm going to die!"

Zhang Qi let out a cry that shattered his soul as he sat on the bed, clutching his hair. "Oh no, my forum coins! I've worked so hard to accumulate them!"

At this moment, Chen Sannan, a fellow roommate and a saintly warrior, pointed at Zhang Qi and said, "Who let you gamble? There's no such thing as getting rich so easily!"

"Ah, I just wanted to make a profit of less than 10 points, who could have imagined?"

"Naive, so your principal has been lost."

At this moment, Zhao Xu was removing his brain dome helmet, preparing to eat dinner, and saw Zhang Qi's troubled expression. He curiously asked, "What's going on?"

Chen Sannan replied with a sigh, "It's not Zhang Qi's first time to gamble all his forum coins away. He's been relying on posting on the forum to earn high praise and attention, and has just managed to accumulate a small amount of forum coins."

"Then he gambled it all away again?" Zhao Xu seemed to understand something.

"Yes," Chen Sannan said with a smirk, "Last month, he bet on Zhongxiao's promotion to 9th level and lost everything. At the time, he wasn't even able to remember standing by the window, shouting that he would bet again like a dog."

"Then he made it to the end of the month, but still couldn't resist, and lost Zhongxiao's monthly promotion to 9th level."

"The rest is what you're seeing now, he's just been posting on the forum again."

After that, Chen Sīn spread his arms and shrugged his shoulders, looking helpless. Zhao Xù listened and felt a bit awkward.

It turned out that the mastermind behind everything was him.

So, Zhang Qí wasn't exactly a reckless gambler, but the label was unlikely to be erased from his reputation.

Whether it was the possibility of advancing to level 9 last month or the fact that he couldn't advance to level 9 by the end of the month, it was a probable event.

Zhang Qí cherished these things related to the forum's reputation and could be exchanged for real money. Therefore, the pressure on him was a probable small profit or even micro-profit.

However, Zhang Qí didn't know that the person who could bankrupt someone was actually the one who had opened twelve big bets, with the thirteenth one still to come.

"Don't gamble too much," Zhao Xù said, urging Zhang Qí to calm down. "These forum coins can't be eaten."

Zhang Qí was already numb from losing and sighed, gazing at the post with the "jumping blank" agreement.

"It's not that," Zhang Qí muttered to himself. "I've seen the grandmaster, Zhōng Xià, go fishing by the lake every day, eating and drinking, and even flirting with girls. I've never seen him put in any effort to level up."

"Even his close friends, I've investigated, who could have thought that someone would be so shameless and unreasonable, and could even level up while fishing with girls."

In other words, he had done his homework, so how could he have thought that Zhōng Xià would rise to this level.

It was as if he had done it just to shame people like them who were two-faced.
Here is the translation of the text:

However, the existence of a 4th-grade miracle creator like Zhong Xia who can't even upgrade to 9th grade, are you really willing to bet on it? 

After Chen Siren became a Saint Warrior, he strictly followed the teachings on this aspect. He wouldn't even touch it, let alone hear about it, as he considered it sacrilegious.

Even if he returned to the real world, he would deeply detest and abhor the behavior of gambling.

As for now, if his father really got involved in such a thing, he would immediately report it without hesitation.

"So I pressured him to upgrade to 9th grade last month, and who knew he would get slapped in the face?" Zhang Qi complained.

Zhao Xu remained silent, indicating that he was aware of the situation.

Zhang Qi had already become one of the closest people to Zhao Xu, and even he couldn't predict Zhao Xu's breakthrough time.

Zhao Xu glanced at the forum evaluation, and the doubts he had about him were replaced by praise.

The insults and flattery were just a sheet of paper apart.

Even the posts that were previously used to vent after losing, such as the "Has Zhong Xia reached 9th grade today?" thread, began to be dug up and used to mock him.

Someone replied on the spot: "Yeah, he's reached 9th grade."
"Xu Ge, what have you been up to lately?" Zhang Qi asked, "Zhong Xia is also a Master of Mysteries, just like you, and he's been in Starlight Town for half a year. How come you're still stuck in Mysterra and haven't appeared yet?"

"You're being too demanding," Chen Siren couldn't help but push Zhang Qi, "Zhong Xia can use the teleportation portal to save thousands of miles of travel. Not everyone can sit on it. Can you handle being on the road for a month?"

As Chen Siren spoke, he glanced at Zhao Xu, worrying that Zhang Qi's nonsense might provoke him.
Here is the translation:

As a result, Zhao Xu smiled and carried the thermos of hot water to the water faucet under the washbasin. However, his mind was still preoccupied with the game's storyline.

Zhao Xu was not a liar, and if Zhang Qi really wanted him to answer, he would have to tell him that he went to the magic god's kingdom during the day.

After filling the thermos with four-fifths of water, Zhao Xu washed his cup by hand.

It's worth noting that, apart from Zheng Xin Yin getting directions, both of his two advanced jobs as a 9th-level dual genius were stabilized on the spot.

Zhao Xu's character card also evolved to a new form:

Occupation 1: 5th-level Mage/Super Magic Sculptor/1st-level Magic Guardian
Occupation 2: 1st-level Monk/4th-level Scroll Scholar/4th-level Cursing Guardian

As for the occupation "Cursing Guardian", it requires a field of "magic" and is basically only possessed by magical spirits. It can be said that the Cursing Guardian was always a small cloak worn by the goddess Sylvina from the beginning.

This is also what made Lian, the former mage, cry. These dual-profession mages, including monks, are all potential candidates for the Cursing Guardian.

It's worth noting that the Cursing Guardian is even more bizarre than the Magic Guardian.

In the goddess's kingdom, after reaching the 4th level of the Cursing Guardian, Zhao Xu used his most critical ability, the supernatural magic, for the first time.

Zhao Xu even gazed wistfully at his palm, as if he could feel the residual magical energy emanating from it.

The supernatural magic ability enabled Zhao Xu to synchronize with the framework of magic, allowing him to perform spells almost effortlessly without expending much effort.
Here is the translation of the text:

Every day, Zhao Xu can use a standard action to cast a spell as a "supernatural ability". However, the spellcasting time cannot exceed the duration of a standard action, such as a one-hour "divination" spell that does not meet the requirement.

Once Zhao Xu activates this ability during spellcasting, he can use it without consuming any spell components and ignore the opponent's spell resistance.

From the next even-level, such as 6th, 8th, and 10th levels, Zhao Xu can obtain an additional use of the ability. However, it does not have any practical value.

Other spellcasters who aspire to reach 10th level can obtain four uses of the supernatural ability.

Zhao Xu, who possesses "latent points", can use them to restore his ability usage at any time. His latent points can also be replenished through the 5th-ring spell "Unbridled Hero's Spirit", which grants 1 latent point per round.

At the same time, Zhao Xu can use "Spell Endurance" to convert the ability from a round-based to a 24-hour duration, allowing him to use 1 latent point per round as long as he stays awake.

From this moment on, Zhao Xu's abilities are perfectly synchronized. Even from this point on, he can use latent points to restore his spell slots, as long as he has enough patience. He has finally become a powerful spellcaster who can cast spells at will and ignore the limitations of spell slots.

In the goddess's kingdom, Zhao Xu has also learned almost all the 5th-ring spells, including those that are not publicly known, such as "warfare spells".
Here is the translation of the text:

Even as the master of magical arts, Sisylvina, still on the scene, recounted some historical anecdotes about magic to Zhao Xu, gently brushing away the dust of history.

The five rings also signified that Zhao Xu's combat power had reached a new level.

Therefore, after completing the formalities tomorrow, he would return to the Starfall Town at that moment.

All players would see Zhao Xu as a "magician" who doesn't care about any magical costs, obsessed with drawing cards until the end of time.

Each round, Zhao Xu could use 1 point of innate power to recover his magical slots, except for the first time he prepares the five-ring spell. After that, he wouldn't need to prepare again.

Because his magical slots are always full.

While players spend an hour preparing magic, Zhao Xu will use that time to buff himself.

From tomorrow on, Zhao Xu would not take a step out the door with fewer than thirty buffs on him.

As a 9th-level player, he finally had the qualification to call himself the strongest under the legend.

The key question was, what legendary monster should he take down first in his first battle after reaching level 9?
Zhao Xu thought about it as he sipped the tea, a faint headache coming on.
