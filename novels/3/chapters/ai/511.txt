Chapter 512: The Moon Produces a Million Gold, Divine Material

"What's strange?" Zhao Xu couldn't help but raise his voice, looking at the mining area's responsible person, Ted.

Because the entire silver mining area is complex, many mines are not like the 36th mine that Zhao Xu has, completely single-handedly occupied.

Many mines may have hidden owners, with several families or even players involved. Moreover, many players have already entered the industry chain of mining, smelting, and sales, and have improved their skills and craftsmanship.

Although the mining area appears to have fewer than a hundred mines, tracing back the origins of each family, it's possible to draw in the entire alliance. This is the key to Lianxing Town's sudden move and Dōngyè City's hesitation to act impulsively.

Ted, the responsible person, has had some connections with Zhao Xu in his previous life.

However, Ted is also a skilled and adaptable person. When Zhao Xu joined the town management, Ted had already risen to a higher position in the city of Auror.

Now, Ted is talking to Zhao Xu, the mine owner, in front of everyone, and it's clear he has ulterior motives.

Zhao Xu didn't bother to use his magical control spell to verify Ted's identity. Before Ted could open his mouth, Zhao Xu simply nodded and said, "Let's report it step by step according to the procedure."

Ted's face turned slightly stiff, looking at Zhao Xu's companion with a restrained smile. It's also unclear.

Isn't it said that players are passionate and enthusiastic?

As long as someone mentions a problem, these players will rush forward with great enthusiasm?

"Ted, sir?"
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu lightly raised his walking stick to indicate the direction of the entrance, and if he wasn't wearing a monk's robe, he would have looked like a gentleman who strictly followed ancient customs.

The person in charge, Ted, also suddenly appeared and hurriedly bent down, waving his hand to indicate that Zhao Xu and the others should head towards the 36th mine shaft.

This caught the attention of a few players squatting near the opposite mine entrance, with grass in their mouths, and they exclaimed in surprise, "What did they just say? Did they really say that?"

One of the players, who was covered in gray dust and holding a pickaxe, said, "That Ted has been spreading rumors about some strange occurrences in the recent mining area, but this newcomer didn't seem to know what was going on, so he just reported it level by level."

"Who is this person? Ted is usually a normal person, but right now he's acting strangely, even kneeling down in front of the high-ranking officials in Winter City, and bossing us players around. He's almost touching the ground with his head."

Just then, another warrior covered in dust, carrying a pickaxe, walked over and said, "Hey, you guys have always wanted to see this person, right? This is the number one person in the entire server."

"I just heard this name, but I didn't dare confirm it, and I didn't expect it to be true," Little Six exclaimed.

"That's right, we players are getting more and more involved in this game," the warrior who just spoke said.

"What is he doing here? Shouldn't he be going to the headquarters of the Mage Association? I'm still thinking about where to get a bite to eat."

"The Mage Association has a 48th mine here, you should go to the unit and take a look at your own assets before you do anything. You see, he's got a lot of people following him, and I think they're all from the association, with many beautiful women among them."

"But they're going in the wrong direction, aren't they?"
Here is the translation of the text:

"Who knows?" said the warrior beside him, looking puzzled.

"Hmph, others come to explore the mine, while we're here to dig for minerals. It's like they're the homeowners, and we're the construction team. I'll make a fool of myself if I say this out loud. We're playing a game where we dig for minerals every day, just like a laborer."

Those big shots have invested millions in this game, and look at how they're splashing around now? This is fate, and you can't do anything about it. You can just take a sword and go kill monsters in the wild to earn money faster."

"You know what, it's not just about digging for minerals. It's not safe, and we have to worry about our equipment and health. My professional skills as a miner have actually improved a lot recently."

"Good grief, I've been digging for minerals every day. I'm going to save up enough money to buy a double-handed giant sword and then go on an adventure. It's getting so tedious digging for minerals every day."

The warrior complained, "If ordinary civilians can't defeat monsters, then digging for minerals is the only option. As players with weapons, we can't just be afraid."

This group of resting players immediately started arguing about whether digging for minerals was worth it, and the volume of their voices gradually increased.

Meanwhile, Zhao Xu, who had wandered off, didn't hear anything.

In reality, after crossing over, fewer people dared to go on adventures. Instead, they chose to focus on digging for minerals and surviving.

This is the life of an adventurer, where accumulating a certain level is a must before taking on any challenges. Every battle is a life-or-death struggle.

Therefore, after crossing over, all revival stones disappeared, and it became impossible to register a new account like in the game. Many people lost their "bravery" as a result.

On the other side, everyone followed the leader into the mine entrance, slowly walking along the track beside the cart path.
Here is the translation of the text:

Without sufficient lighting on the wall, the silhouettes of the people present became somewhat vague. Zheng Xin Yu was also leaning against Wang Qing Wei. Meanwhile, Zhao Xu was thinking about his plan for the development of the Starfall Town.

He had managed to convert a single-player game into a farming game, but it was a hard-won achievement. Therefore, when Ted, the person in charge, mentioned something "unusual", he didn't pay any attention. He was there to develop the town's economy, not to do tasks. Arthur didn't have a fixed workflow, so the "task reward" was also uncertain.

As a result, players who didn't receive their rewards would suddenly kill their employers, and a new topic would emerge every week on the forum. However, players with a reason to sympathize with these players would be chased by the city guards and either become outlaws or disband.

Therefore, before Zhao Xu would take on this "detour", he wouldn't rush into it unless he had a way to resolve it. Although the 36th mine was his and the 48th mine was the Association of Mages', there were many other mines with no connection to him.

After realizing that the "Ancient Element Temple" in the depths of Starfall Lake was not as simple as he had imagined, Zhao Xu wouldn't speak out of turn about some unusual things unless they couldn't be resolved. Only then would he, as the leader, need to intervene and take charge of the situation, which was his responsibility as the leader.

"What are all these black piles of dirt?" Zheng Xin Yu couldn't help but be astonished by what he saw in front of him.

Or, to put it another way, the only person with silver light in the room was Vivian, who was wearing full armor.
Here is the translation:

Zhao Xu couldn't help but turn his head back to look at Zheng Xin Yu, "What does your imagined secret silver mine look like?"

"It's just a silver mine where you dig out silver."

Zheng Xin Yu's answer was also simple, with his head slightly tilted and a puzzled expression on his face.

"It's actually mining, where you dig up these native minerals and then refine them to extract silver. And these are considered secret silver mines because they have a much higher concentration of silver inside," Ted explained, saying that as he greeted the person in charge of the 36th pit, "Les", who was hired by Zhao Xu.

Compared to Ted's pale complexion, Les was a burly man with a full beard and a protruding belly.

"I greet you, Archbishop Sosa," Les said, bowing to the crowd and greeting Archbishop Sosa, who was present.

It was clear that Les was a devout believer in the goddess of magic.

It was also for this reason that he was assigned to manage the mine.

Archbishop Sosa then introduced the two to Zhao Xu on the spot.

When Les first heard that Zhao Xu was the mine owner, he only nodded silently.

But when he heard that Zhongxiao was also a goddess believer, and even had divine blessings, Les became extremely enthusiastic towards Zhao Xu.

As Les walked ahead to introduce the details of the mine and the distribution of manpower each month, Archbishop Sosa whispered quietly to Zhao Xu beside him, "Les's daughter had a serious illness due to a cold and was saved by the goddess's blessing and the pastor's treatment. So they are a devout family of believers."

"From the time I took over the church, they will take a day off every month to help the church voluntarily. They are trustworthy people."
After nodding his head to indicate his understanding, he handed over the responsibility to his chosen person. At the same time, he felt a sense of introspection in his heart.

For ordinary people who have not received systematic education, they do not have the concept of prior knowledge. They will not think about what kind of faith they want to have or what kind of faith they want to believe in. It's possible that they believe in a higher power and devote themselves to it. As for doctrine, they will understand and experience it later.

In a region as tough as the north, it's even more so. At this moment, Zhao Xu couldn't help but gaze at Zheng Xinan's face.

He had realized that, compared to using wealth to manipulate people or achieving eternal fame, it's more effective to gather power through "faith". He could quickly gather a powerful force this way.

"It's amazing," Les said, his loud voice echoing through the room. "After the players occupied the Starfall town, killed the mine owners who were selling slaves and mining, and seized their shares. As for the mines previously owned by the nobles of Winter's Day and the Alliance, they are still intact."

"So, the mines that were obtained from the original mine owners have average production levels. I don't know why, after the Starfall Lake Battle, the silver production suddenly skyrocketed and became the top producer among all mines."

As he spoke, Les looked at Zhao Xu with a sense of awe, as if he was admiring this faith of the same goddess as "Summer".

"How many did we get?" White Dragon Saurus asked, while Vi Vianna was sizing up the hot-headed White Dragon, ready to strike at any moment.

Les, however, looked at Summer. "There's nothing to hide here," Zhao Xu said.
Here is the translation of the text:

At this time, there were still many miners in the mine, transporting the crushed silver ore, constantly transporting it to the surface, but they would all stop and listen intently whenever they passed by, as if they were expecting a shocking piece of gossip.

"It seems that our monthly income could be as high as 50,000 gold coins, and our production capacity may continue to increase," Les said with an incredulous tone.

The people present, those who were pushing carts, couldn't help but take a deep breath, and those who were digging for a day's worth of silver coins couldn't help but feel a sense of despair.

The asset class that controlled the production resources could earn a fortune, which was far beyond what laborers like them could ever attain.

Zheng Xin allowed himself to be surprised, "So you can make a fortune?"

He had secretly exchanged his allowance for game coins to buy equipment, and he was clear about the current exchange rate.

An income of 50,000 gold coins per month was even crushing the efforts of countless people who had spent their entire lives working.

White Dragon's eyes widened, as if he had already imagined how he would use these gold coins to set up his nest.

"So exaggerated?" Wang Qingwei couldn't help but raise an eyebrow.

"You're really going bankrupt," An Shun Yao suddenly sent a telepathic message to Zhao Xun, whispering to him behind the crowd.

"What's going on?" Zhao Xun was astonished.

"This mine can produce so much secret silver, you must have used some trick. Otherwise, with the reputation of the Star Lake, it's impossible for you to get this mine."

"Yes, I put a secret silver crystal at the bottom. Is there a problem?" Zhao Xun couldn't help but look puzzled, as if he had sensed something.

"What material has been replaced by a readily available gold coin? What do you think?"
Here is the translation of the text into English:

When he heard this, Zhao Xu couldn't help but feel a pang in his heart.

As it turned out, the legendary master of the Jade Star, Frank, was a nine-ring mage, and yet he didn't even recognize the value of the item. However, he soon calmed down.

"Yes, even though it's been a while since you put it in, but if you regret it, I can help you retrieve it," Anzhiya suggested.

"Alright," Zhao Xu shook his head.

"No one can guarantee that they won't die within a hundred years. Accidents can happen at any time, and who knows who will come first. Let's just leave this mine behind."

Zhao Xu's gaze was deep and profound as he looked at the wall of the mine, which was excavated and rough. "Even if my family can't keep it, we can exchange something for it with that contract. At least it's a fixed asset."
