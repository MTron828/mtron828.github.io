Chapter 423: Slaughter Harvest

The opponent threw the small golden ball at an extremely fast speed, and even Zhao Xu didn't have time to react before it landed at his feet.

In an instant, Zhao Xu didn't know what the small golden ball was, but his mind was racing with possibilities.

Continuous guessing, continuous refutation.

The ball was indeed close to him, but it also meant that the leader of the opponent was not far away.

In the end, Zhao Xu gave up other options.

Not knowing what the small golden ball was, he couldn't apply the right remedy.

Of course, the most mindless way would be to use the "Rainbow Ball" spell, which would isolate all harm.

The problem was, he wouldn't know how.

At this moment, the small golden ball hit the wall behind Zhao Xu and rolled onto his feet.

Looking at the momentum, it seemed to be able to roll back to the opponent's side.

However, Zhao Xu's residual light had already noticed that as soon as the ball touched the wall, it had started to transform, now resembling a bomb about to explode.

"Secondary explosive burst!"

Time seemed to be frozen in this instant, and Zhao Xu's pupils seemed to have turned white.

In this situation where time was slowed down, Zhao Xu's emotional colors also began to peel away.

He directly leaned to the side and kicked the small golden ball on the ground with all his might.

It shot off.

Time returned to normal.
Here is the translation of the text:

As the squad leader's eyes widened in shock, the small golden ball suddenly released a massive amount of energy, shooting towards the other teammates behind him.

He hadn't seen any movement from the opponent!

"Not——"

The squad leader's regretful voice was still in his throat.

Suddenly, a massive hot wave erupted behind him, engulfing the entire room with intense flames, burning everything in its path. The magic fireball struck the stone wall and ceiling, consuming everything.

Fireball spell!

Exactly six meters away!

In this room, the massive wave of devouring flames had just stopped in front of the squad leader.

Not even a thread of his clothes had been burned.

Everything had strictly followed the operating principles of this spell.

If that small golden ball had exploded with the same power on Zhao Xu and others, the blast radius would have reached the opponent's teammates, without causing any harm.

The six-meter blast radius in this room was the distance between life and death.

After listening to the opponent's teammates' painful screams amidst the flames, Zhao Xu directly closed his eyes.

The aftereffects of the sudden explosion began to invade his brain, causing a sense of dizziness that penetrated his thoughts, rendering him unable to move further.

Luckily, he still had a teammate.

This was the reason why Viola, who was weaker than him, followed him and protected him.

When Zhao Xu, who couldn't avoid the negative effects of the sudden explosion, tried to grasp the precious 6 seconds, Viola quickly reacted, her eyes scanning Zhao Xu, and then directly stabbed towards the warrior with the sacred avenger in her hand.

"Break the curse!"

The cold steel sword, accompanied by the flash of light, struck the air.

Here is the translation of the text:

The benevolent force's radiant light was subtly attached to the sword's edge, like a thousand hammers and ten thousand chisels grinding out a sword that could burn away the evil in the world.

One strike shattered the chest.

This warrior, who had just been licking his face and discussing with Zhao Xun and others, and then suddenly turned his face and became a merciless killer, was now pale with shock, unable to believe it, and was also in agony due to the chest wound.

He wanted to cough up blood and wail in despair, but his entire lung was already permeated with fresh blood, and he could no longer make a sound.

He couldn't imagine that after his comrades-in-arms had been killed by the enemy, he would be killed in cold blood without a word.

Even in his final moments, he was still thinking about why the woman in iron armor and silver helmet, with her long sword, was so sharp, and why his entire armor was pierced through with ease.

"Thud."

As the warrior lost his life and fell to the ground, Zhao Xun's entire body began to recover, and the dizziness disappeared.

Viola gently wiped the blood off the sword and put it back in its scabbard.

"This will do," Viola said, handing Zhao Xun the golden chain with a golden ball pendant.

The pendant had just turned into a fireball spell after being dropped and had killed all the enemy's comrades behind them.

If it were not for Viola alone, it would have taken her a long time to defeat over ten people.

"This is the Fireball Necklace," Zhao Xun explained. "I've heard of it before, but I never thought I'd see it in action today."

"Fireball?" Viola, who was born to the mother of darkness, was well-versed in many things, but she didn't understand this kind of thing that couldn't harm demons, and it was normal for her to not understand it.
Here is the translation:

"Yeah, this necklace has several types and specifications, with small gold balls attached, three to nine of which are unknown. The price of the necklace is also around one to nearly nine thousand gold coins."

"What's the advantage of this thing compared to the fireball spell?"

"None, so it's usually only for those who are skilled in magic," said Zhao Xu with a smile. "The basic damage of the fireball spell is 1-6 points (1D6), and each level of caster can stack an additional layer of damage. Typically, a 5th-level caster can cast a 5th-level fireball spell with 50 damage (5-30 damage, 5D6)."

"That's much more affordable than the necklace that costs a few thousand gold coins. This necklace is just enough to take them by surprise."

However, if the opponent were to pull out their wand and point it at them, Zhao Xu and his companion would definitely not hesitate to take action.

"Even if it's a 10th-level fireball wand, it's still only 22,500 gold coins (10-60 damage, 10D6). The opponent's necklace should be around 4,500 gold coins, which is the third-grade model."

Zhao Xu carefully examined the fireball necklace in his hand, estimating that the opponent had just lost a 7th-level spell (7-42 damage, 25 points), with two 5th-level spells and four 3rd-level spells remaining uncast.

"This person is too confident, thinking they can kill us with this?" said Vivi, shaking her head.

A normal 7th-level fireball spell without any extreme or high-effect spells.

Even if Vivi fails to dodge, her life force would still allow her to survive.

The strong life value is what higher-level players face lower-level players with, and their error tolerance is higher.

Zhao Xu chuckled at this.
Here is the translation:

It seems that Vivianna, although a straightforward and honest saint warrior, is still not very thorough in small details. However, he can still instantly kill the enemy in the moment he loses his ability to act. He seems to be quite satisfied with this basic instinct.

"Vivianna, the characteristic of the fireball spell is that if the wearer of this necklace is hit by magical flames, they must use force to dodge, or they may be blown up by the remaining gold balls. Of course, the holder can also give up, which would be equivalent to self-detonation."

Hearing this, Vivianna's eyes flashed with a hint of coldness, originally charming and alluring. The opponent had just lost one, naturally because he couldn't retrieve the six remaining ones.

This explanation couldn't justify why he didn't send the entire necklace over. The 7th-level fireball spell was still okay. However, if the remaining six were to explode together, it would add up to 29D6, approximately 100 points of magical fire damage.

Only Vivianna with 10 points of fire resistance and ordinary human Zhao Xu would definitely be incinerated by the high-temperature magical flames.

At this time, Vivianna also felt a sense of alarm in his heart, realizing he had just walked in front of the gates of the abyss.

"But wouldn't he also die this way?" Vivianna immediately sensed the awkwardness.

The opponent was deliberately not giving them time to react, directly throwing the metal ball behind them.

This naturally meant that the warrior and they were both within the range of the fireball spell.

"So I'll take a look," Zhao Xu walked up to the face of the team leader who Vivianna had killed with his one-handed sword strike.

At the same time, he handed the fireball necklace to Vivianna, saying, "Take good care of this necklace, preparedness is the best defense."
Here is the translation of the text:

Vivian had originally intended to refuse, saying she was unwilling to use ordinary magical items. However, she suddenly hesitated and quietly put the necklace away and put it around her neck.

"Yeah, it's weird if you do that. You can just get rid of these small golden balls. It's better than nothing. But when you throw them away, make sure to calculate the explosion distance of about six and a half meters to avoid hurting yourself."

As Zhao Xu spoke, he lifted the sleeve of the deceased warrior.

The two of them immediately looked at the small, medium-sized fire element pattern on the warrior's arm.

"Indeed," Zhao Xu sighed.

"What's going on?" Vivian felt a sense of familiarity with the mysterious pattern above, but couldn't figure out the hidden meaning.

"This is the fire element immunity ability," Zhao Xu analyzed after looking at the small pattern with some fading signs. "It's likely that if we kill these elements, we can obtain the corresponding element damage immunity ability."

"As for the small and medium-sized maps, I guess they're the same fire element immunity ability, but with different durations. And this team leader obtained fire element immunity, so he dares to hold the fireball necklace and come with us to 'share the same fate'."

Suddenly, Zhao Xu noticed that the copper box in his backpack was moving strangely.

He directly took it out, and the elemental symbols on the four corpses in the area began to glow, then floated off the corpses and slowly flew into Zhao Xu's hand.

There were eight symbols, but they only filled up half the pattern.
Zhao Xu thought to himself, "What's next? There are still giant, super, giant, elder, and legendary-grade princes in the element family. I'm getting a headache just thinking about it."

However, he also felt a bit excited. He had only deciphered two of the five treasure boxes, and the remaining three were still unknown. The current elemental symbol box was the fourth one, and he had not deciphered the password to open it.

If he could successfully evolve, he would not only receive the treasure box itself, but also the treasures inside.

At this moment, Zhao Xu suddenly stood up, saying, "Come on, Wei Wei, let's take a look first."
"Ah?"
Wei Wei was about to react, but she quickly followed Zhao Xu's gaze.

The corpses of the adventurers on the ground were not the kind that would automatically disappear and resurrect later. Instead, all their equipment belonged to Zhao Xu.

"Kill and plunder, golden belt."
This sentence was even more ruthless and profound in the weak-eat-strong world of Arthur.
Sometimes, killing a group of identical adventurers could even get you better, more suitable equipment than getting it from monsters.
