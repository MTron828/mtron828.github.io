Chapter 657: The Song of Raley, Enter the Dream

As Zhao Xu listened to the voiceless voice, it was as if a call from the dream world was echoing in his mind. He felt a subtle sense of unease, as if a long-held secret was about to be revealed.

At this moment, he was standing on the vast, dark ocean, with waves crashing against the shore. The wind was howling, and he could feel the gusts of wind on the edge of the storm.

"Swift Wings."

Zhao Xu immediately cast the spell, and two giant, semi-transparent wings unfolded from his back, beating against the wind pressure.

With the "Flying Technique" already mastered, Zhao Xu's flying speed increased by one level after casting this spell. Additionally, he refreshed his "Divine Footwork" endurance time.

However, Zhao Xu found it difficult to maintain his shape in the current storm, so he continued to gesture and chant, casting the four-ring spell - "Higher Atmosphere Wings."

After touching the transparent wings with his hand, the flying magic, his agility suddenly reached an extreme level.

Perfect level.

"Raley -"
"Hmm -"

The ethereal voice from the other side awakened Zhao Xu's thoughts, which were immersed in contemplation. This time, the low-pitched voice was mixed with the sound of waves crashing against the shore, as if someone was whispering in his ear.

In an instant, Zhao Xu charged forward, and in the process, he turned back to look at the strange phenomenon he had just witnessed.

Many years later, Zhao Xu still couldn't forget the moment he saw everything.
Here is the translation of the text:

On the vast, turbulent sea surface, where waves crashed against the shore and raging tides churned, a majestic ancient stone structure suddenly emerged. Surrounding it were numerous sea creatures, including the decaying remains of sea monsters. The structure was adorned with countless pillars of varying shapes and styles, each with its own unique features.

As the mysterious spectacle unfolded beneath the dark, starless sky, it emitted a faint, eerie green glow, as if the ancient fortress was slowly revealing itself. The statues, sculptures, and carvings on the pillars were unlike anything Zhao Xu had ever seen or heard of in the world of King Arthur.

As he approached the bizarre, twisted, and geometric shapes of the stone blocks, Zhao Xu felt a sense of disorientation, as if the boundaries between heaven and earth had blurred. He couldn't tell which way was up or down.

Despite not seeing any living creatures, Zhao Xu felt a shiver run down his spine as he sensed a strange, otherworldly atmosphere. As he listened to the whispers of the ancient secrets, he felt as if he had reached the cosmic gateway, the threshold of the unknown.

In this moment, he even felt a surge of knowledge, as if he had unlocked a mysterious skill or gained insight into the esoteric arts. The secrets of the ancient magic were laid bare before him, and the truth was no longer a secret.

The true nature of the magic was revealed, and the mysteries were laid out nakedly before him. The ancient secrets, once hidden, were now revealed, and Zhao Xu felt as if he had transcended the boundaries of human understanding.
The originally difficult-to-understand knowledge structure and spell model were broken down again, and he even felt that the barrier of the six-ring arcane to him no longer existed.
But as he listened, Zhao Xu found that the "Concealing Eye" crystal floating above his head suddenly began to crack, as if it had been smashed by a heavy hammer.
The "bright" white light that originally emanated from the center of the crystal, which had always protected Zhao Xu's radiance in the form of a protective oath, also began to disappear.
[Adventurer Zhongxia, you have lost the barrier against magic items, spells, and psychic effects that shield detection and influence thoughts. You have lost the ability to resist the effects of all spells with the "affecting the mind" and "detecting" descriptors.]
What's going on?
At this moment, the awakened Zhao Xu decisively took out his "Advanced Super Magic Instantaneous Power Wand" from his storage gloves.
"Avoid detection!"
[Adventurer Zhongxia, your third-level spell 'avoid detection' has failed.]
Originally, this spell could make Zhao Xu difficult to be detected by divination spells, and could even interfere.
But he didn't expect that, it didn't even last for a second, and this hour-level spell lost all its effects.
At this moment, the "whispering" voice in his ear had already begun to accompany the "crazy" roar, as if it came from the howl of hell.
Even an invisible claw had appeared behind Zhao Xu, reaching towards his back, and was intertwined with the mad wind blowing from the void.
Zhao Xu only controlled his invisible wings, then touched his pulsating heart, and calmly shouted, "Voter ability, spell reward, eighth ring, choose 'Mind Barrier'."
In the next second, in the voter template on his character card, within the reward spell list from first to ninth circle, the position of "Mind Barrier" appeared in the eighth circle, a spell-like ability.

It also appeared deep in Zhao Xu's mind, ready to be used at a moment's notice.

"Mind Barrier!"
Zhao Xu once again invoked this god-given spell.

The essence of "Concealed Eye" is "Mind Barrier".
And it was actually destroyed in the whisper, so Zhao Xu's most direct reaction was to choose to use this spell again.

At this moment, he was like a traveler stuck in the mud, only able to rely on instinct and grab onto any rope as much as possible.

With the completion of the spell, the eight-circle arcane of Mind Barrier, which is also the eight-circle divine art of protection, once again emitted a familiar light, enveloping Zhao Xu's body.

It blocks all magic and effects that affect the mind, including all divination spells or effects.

"[Adventurer Zhongxia, your eight-circle spell 'Mind Barrier' has expired.]"
The 24-hour spell duration was instantly extinguished.
It was so fast that Zhao Xu couldn't even blink.

The reward spells for the voters, no matter which circle, can only be activated once a day!

At this time, the whisper in his ear became more and more piercing, as if scraping the blackboard with fingernails, and even like a needle piercing Zhao Xu's eardrums.

He was starting to feel a bit weak, and his perfect flying ability to resist the strong winds was also starting to lose control, swaying back and forth in the high sky above the sea.

Zhao Xu gritted his teeth, his gaze scanning all the data on the character card.

He still had a trump card!

"Iron Heart Power!"
The power of martial arts also manifested at this moment.
As long as the power of the iron heart can support one round, he can also rely on the special characteristics of the "military sword" to use a swift action to restore all martial arts in each round, and then use them again.
[Adventurer Zhong Xia, you currently have no negative status.]
No negative status at all!
Looking at this line of text, Zhao Xu's heart became even colder.
But then he thought.
He doesn't belong to any of the six restrictive states: dizziness, prone, capture, suppression, entanglement, or intimidation.
He also doesn't belong to any of the eight helpless states: paralysis, immobilization, restraint, sleep, coma, intimidation, petrification, or paralysis.
Although he was panicking inside, his character card panel did not show any of the three major fear states: trembling, fear, or panic.
Other conditions such as dizziness, blindness, deafness, poisoning, or attribute damage were irrelevant.
"Silent spell!"
At this moment, Zhao Xu even resorted to casting this spell that isolates sound in a desperate attempt.
All the sound of the waves disappeared immediately.
As if the calls sensed in dreams and the whispers of death came back again.
It was only then that Zhao Xu realized that an invisible pair of hands had finally tightly wrapped around him after using the "iron heart power".
The flow of magic in his body also stagnated at that moment.
The next second, Zhao Xu also lost the last trace of "flight ability" in his body, and he fell freely between the boundless sea.
Like a bullet falling onto the sea.
The focal point in his eyes began to blur.
"Time reversal!"
In the end, Zhao Xu activated the "time reversal amulet" that he had never used at the last moment.
In an instant, he returned to the high altitude.
However, this only delayed the time of falling into the sea by six seconds.
This time, Zhao Xu could only use his last trump card—
"Silver Fire"!
Here is the translation:

The radiant blue and silver light that had gathered around him dissipated, and he lost his flying ability, regaining his normal body temperature. This made Zhao Xu's breathing quicken, and he finally felt a moment of weakness. However, the "silver flames" that engulfed his body continued to weaken, as if about to be extinguished by the approaching storm.

This made Zhao Xu even more anxious. He felt the silver flames inside him surging forward, but he knew they would only last for a few minutes. It was just a desperate attempt to delay his death.

Zhao Xu's eyes, deep with determination, seemed to harden even more. He had no way to escape. As the fierce winds pounded around him, Zhao Xu flapped his wings behind him and charged towards the giant stone building in front of him.

He was like a comet about to fade away, radiating his final glow. The silver flames, which had been protecting his body, continued to dwindle, slowly disappearing like a secret whispered in the depths of the abyss.

"Boom!"

With a loud crash, Zhao Xu fell into a pit filled with irregularly shaped stones. At that moment, he looked up with a bewildered expression, gazing at the massive stone door in front of him.

The door was carved with a sea creature's head, with tentacles and human limbs, and its body was made of rubber, with countless scaly plates covering it. Its back had a pair of bat-like wings made of skin. However, what truly filled people with dread was the "breath" emanating from behind the statue.
At this moment, Zhao Xu finally felt a sense of familiarity emerge.

The last time he saw it was in his memory, when he witnessed the legendary Ernest's descent.

Immediately afterwards, the stone door creaked open slowly.

The mystical and ancient whispers resonated once again, but this time they did not come from his eardrums, but from the deep stone cave in front of him—

"In the eternal mansion of R'lyeh, the sleeping Cthulhu awaits your dream."
