Chapter 415: Holy Breath
Twilight Forest.

After the explosion area was dominated by the anti-magic zone, almost everyone lost the ability to quickly reach the explosion center. It was not just that they couldn't cast magic. They couldn't even teleport from outside the area to the inside, nor could they use other planes to shortcut. 

Higher-level wizards from several major cities received the news and rushed to the explosion edge of the Twilight Forest, only to feel the anti-magic zone's power at the boundary and could only sigh in dismay. These higher-level wizards, regardless of who they were, dared not enter the area where magic was impossible. 

As for the "Iron Heart Force" that could stop all negative states in the Nine Swords System, it was a secret not to be spread. Some higher-level adventurers of King Arthur, staring at the explosion area, were muttering to themselves. 

Even with a high-level artifact, it was not worth it without the means to obtain it, especially after a sudden, unexpected event caused the explosion, followed by the appearance of various ominous signs. This time, they felt a sense of unease.

In the end, a few of the normally bold higher-level adventurers gritted their teeth and decided to venture in.

The adventurers inside the explosion area, after hearing the name of the high-level artifact, were like they had been electrified and rushed off at full speed.

For players who possessed resurrection stones, getting the artifact was a profitable deal. Whether it was using the artifact to develop their own abilities, searching for other means of manifestation, or directly selling the high-level artifact for a large sum of money, it was a good choice.

As night fell, most players who were near the forest were recruited by major guilds to venture into the forest for an expedition, causing player wages to skyrocket. Even smaller teams that had initially carried heavy loads decided to abandon their burdens and advance lightly. Meanwhile, the alliance cavalry team that had been sent to investigate was in a state of distress. Initially, they rode their horses to the blast site, having exhausted themselves.

The thick smoke and fog made it difficult for them to breathe, and even their horses were affected. After the announcement was made, the horses became even more agitated and fled back in terror. The cavalrymen tried to hold on to the reins and whip the horses, but it was no use.

As the leader of the cavalry team looked at the players rushing by, he realized that this battle might not be their battlefield. Hours passed, and after the "Eclipse" in the Twilight Forest, several teams that had been stationed nearby heard the explosions and quickly rushed to the blast site.

These teams cautiously observed their surroundings, wary of the desolate wasteland that had been scorched to the ground. Without the legendary names that told them that they were actually laggards, these adventurers would have long since turned on each other.

Compared to eliminating competitors in an unknown mysterious region, it was much more convenient to clear the way beforehand. However, "Nian Xia" and "Weilian" had already entered the area within six hours. These messages, like demons in their hearts, tormented the adventurers seeking the divine artifact.

The team leaders, breathing in the acrid smoke, shouted at the top of their lungs, urging their teammates to hurry and reach the explosion site.

The entire forest, bathed in the twilight, was like a beehive, attracting countless ants.

...Mistral, Floating City, Seventh Floor, Tower of the Pyramid.

In her usual tranquil state, Anniya pushed open the bedroom door without knocking. Inside, a mature woman with golden hair and green eyes was brushing her hair in front of the mirror, wearing a light-colored nightgown that accentuated her slender figure.

Upon seeing Anniya enter, the woman, May, didn't even turn her head, simply saying, "If you hadn't learned basic etiquette from your master, I wouldn't mind teaching you a lesson, Anniya."

But Anniya didn't seem to care about May's words.

Her face had lost its luster, as if a storm was brewing inside.

"You came back to Earth after a thousand years, broke your oath, and specifically came here to visit me, just to deceive me?"

May, however, just smiled, turned around, and revealed her face, looking far away at Anniya.

The unfinished makeup revealed a captivating beauty that would make anyone who saw her fall to their knees, willing to surrender to her skirt.

Even though Anniya, as a woman, felt her heart racing upon seeing May's true appearance.

She knew she was immune to all forms of mind control and manipulation, the only thing that could cause such an effect.

On the one hand, May's charm was so overwhelming that it directly affected people's aesthetic sense, making anyone who saw her feel like they were gazing upon a goddess.

This also made Aentiya wonder what the other person was thinking back then. Although the mage's spellcasting attribute is charm, the person in question had spent a lot of effort to add a whole 20 points of charm enhancement to their body in May. What proportion of that effort was for show, and what proportion was for the other person's strength? Aentiya wore a difficult-to-see cloak because of her own special circumstances, while May was simply too beautiful. Otherwise, it would be impossible to bring Vivian from the enemy camp over so smoothly.

May smiled sweetly, seemingly switching from being shy to being a gentle maiden. After taking a few deep breaths, Aentiya's inner emotions had calmed down. "Just now, the sacred palace of Aetheria, which contains the sacred breath, fell in the North Alliance, in the twilight forest."

"You're clearer than me," Aentiya said, "that after putting the sacred breath into the palace, he deliberately added a 50-kilometer radius anti-magic zone to it. Anyone who approaches within 10 kilometers will receive more than 1000 points of damage from the sacred energy, even without immunity or resistance. He even set a curse on God. Then he deliberately put it away in Arthur's sky, sealing it so that no one can approach. This I know better than you, because I put it there myself."

"Yes," Aentiya's expression turned cold, "I'm telling you this. He used these methods just to prevent someone from bringing the Aetheria palace down to the ground today."

May, however, turned her head directly, "It wasn't me who put it down."

It seemed as if Sophia had sensed the aura of the ancient times, and after a moment, she explained weakly, "The spell is set in mid-air, and it must be set on the axis of the ground. At that time, we designed five golden chests, but two of them were activated, causing the spell to become unbalanced, so it fell down, and the subsequent setup began."

Sophia definitely wouldn't be so naive, where would she put such a crucial thing in five golden chests on the Arthurian land.

Just then, Sophia had already bitten her lip, clearly not going to explain the reason further.

"Hmph, so you're going to let your little demon take him inside?" Sophia asked her true intention, "I knew you sent that demon to follow me, not for good intentions."

"What are you saying?" Sophia spat back, "You and I both know that the Holy Breath, this key, will ultimately descend to the mortal world."

"But it's not now," Sophia said seriously.

"Sophia,"

May suddenly raised his voice, "No one can stop the wheel of history from moving forward, as he said, and you're more clear about it."

"The spirits of Arthur have lived from the past to the present, and they have their own way of living. They don't rely on strong individuals like us to survive, so you don't need to worry too much about them."

"Who said that the prophecy of the ancient times is accurate? Based on my analysis, it's possible that the Holy Breath is the opportunity for salvation rather than the beginning of destruction."

As Sophia spoke with conviction, Sophia whispered, "But if the Holy Breath doesn't descend to the mortal world, then that prophecy will never come true, and that's also the reason for the initial sealing."

"Even the gods fear the collapse of Arthur. You know that the palace of Aedon has moved, and you can't discuss this with me first? He originally left a method for me to re-seal it. Therefore, I can completely prevent this crisis that may cause Arthur to stir up trouble before it happens."

May originally felt carefree and unruffled, but when she heard these words, she couldn't help but get annoyed and said with a sneer: "Phooey, biased!"

At that moment, she stood up, and the sunlight filtering through the floor-to-ceiling window shone on her fair skin.

"When it comes to you, I know, and so do a few gods, and now they're all dead. No one knows how to stabilize the situation."

"Even you and I suspect that the existence that the gods are wary of might have caused the apocalypse, or it might be caused by the gods themselves, so we've always avoided discussing this topic."

"However, since fate has triggered the five treasures. So, we should quietly wait for the sacred breath to appear."

But May just looked at Anne and didn't accept her words, and had to go over and hug her, just like in the old days.

"Don't worry, Anne. The Elysium Palace, after descending to the ground, is actually absorbing the earth's energy. If it absorbs the energy and no one can retrieve the sacred breath, it will prove that it's not the right time for the sacred breath to appear in the world. At that time, the Elysium Palace will rise back up to the sky on its own."

"So you're not letting Zhongxiao go in?" Anne asked.

"No, it's not for you to go in and rescue people," May said with a light laugh. "Wait for the Elysium Palace to rise again, and then you can go in and bring him out. Otherwise, the people who are still trapped inside will all be automatically killed."

"Okay..." May suddenly took out a black notebook from her bag.

"Give him this thing. We all have to become local council members, and even the 4th-level magic cannot be cast, it's quite pathetic, so let him read it quickly and level up to 7th level."

"Ah, you're concerned about him too," Anni said with a hint of mockery, but didn't refuse and continued speaking directly. She sensed the aura emanating from the notebook on the table and immediately knew it was the one handled by the giant with dark magic. However, May didn't take the bait and said straightforwardly, "I'm not like someone who is thousands of miles away——"
