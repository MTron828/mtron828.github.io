Chapter 190: The Land of the Dead

The third storage box contained a small piece of pale blue, animal-shaped outer skin. It looked ordinary, but seemed to radiate vitality. Even Zhao Xu's hands holding the crossbow became unsteady as he gazed at it.

How did this thing end up in the storage box? The undead priests didn't carry it with them? It was a complete waste of heaven's blessing.

Zhao Xu couldn't help but glance back at the "Heavy Wound" scroll in his backpack, and suddenly felt that this fixed damage spell had some logic to it.

This outer skin looked familiar to Zhao Xu, as he had seen it on Cui Lu before. As a survival ability, Cui Lu wasn't strong, but he managed to survive the Earth's passage and become a strong warrior, largely due to the initial obtained miraculous outer skin.

This miraculous outer skin!

Zhao Xu didn't hesitate to unleash his "Detection Magic" and used the "Mechanical Eye Mirror" on his eye socket to identify the outer skin.

Suddenly, the information about the pale blue outer skin appeared in Zhao Xu's mind, confirming his judgment.

Zhao Xu couldn't help but clench his fists.

The most valuable aspect of this miraculous outer skin is that it can carry items like the Aen Stone, occupying no equipment slots.

Arthur's equipment slots have strict limitations due to the reason of magical principle. If two identical equipment items are equipped at the same time, only one will take effect. Each adventurer can only equip one headgear.
Here is the translation of the text:

Below is the "eye" department, which usually consists of glasses or goggles. At this moment, Zhao Xu is equipped with the "Mechanical Person's Goggles", a device that can transform detection magic into identification techniques.

Next is the "neck" department, where one usually wears necklaces, talismans, and badges. Zhao Xu is currently wearing the "Time Reversal Talisman" borrowed from An Tiya.

Then comes the "shoulder" department, where one usually wears cloaks and capes. Zhao Xu is equipped with the "Stellar Cloak", a small divine artifact.

The "inner body" department includes robes and undershirts, while the "outer body" department includes robes and armor. Zhao Xu does not have any of these items at the moment.

The "waist" department can be equipped with belts. The "limbs" department includes gloves, arm guards, and shoes. Zhao Xu is wearing the "Transmission Shoes".

The "finger" department can also be equipped with two rings. Zhao Xu is wearing a "Stealth Ring".

In total, there are 12 positions that can be equipped with items, with the fingers counted as two. Zhao Xu has already accumulated a total of 5 items.

Even in the player community, he is far ahead of others in terms of magical equipment.

If Zhao Xu reaches level 9, he will have filled all 12 positions with items.

At that time, if he wants to upgrade again, he will have to give up some of his previous items.

Therefore, "outer shell" items that are not counted as equipment positions are not affordable for ordinary people.

However, for a future wealthy wizard like Zhao Xu, such items are definitely useful.
Here is the translation of the text:

At this time, Zhao Xu lightly put the outer skin on the back of his hand, and suddenly he felt a numbness. Then the entire outer skin directly merged with his arm, and a blue light slowly penetrated his entire body.

After flashing for a few seconds, Zhao Xu's face returned to its normal color, no longer with the previous blue tint.

The miraculous outer skin had already begun to protect his entire body, just like adding a phone case.

Zhao Xu touched his hand again and felt no unusual sensation.

The "suppression outer skin" and "Ain Stone" both appeared in his character's "equipped items" column.

At this time, Zhao Xu was still in a dangerous situation, but he didn't try to test the effect of the suppression outer skin.

This outer skin can be activated three times a day through "intuitive movements," and during that time, any damage caused by spells and abilities will be minimized.

For example, if a 5th-level mage casts a fireball that deals 5D6 (5-30 HP damage) to Zhao Xu, he will only take 5 HP damage during that round.

In general, the effect of spells on Zhao Xu has been reduced by one level in low-level situations, or he can break free from randomness.

Each time a spell is cast, he can determine the exact amount of damage.

This is a greater significance to him.

In addition, he also has the "Stellar Cloak" that provides physical damage resistance, and the two work together to enhance Zhao Xu's physical magic defense capabilities by more than one level.

After this stimulation, Zhao Xu became excited and began to continue exploring the remaining chests.
Here is the translation of the text:

As he rummaged through the storage room, he suddenly stumbled upon a "variant spider" again. However, this time the opponent was directly struck and killed, and Zhao Xu now picked up a silver coin and shot an arrow with his crossbow, which was quite impressive.

But the rest of the storage room was empty, except for two cabinets that were filled with a stack of handwritten manuscripts. Zhao Xu just picked them up, but the stack of manuscripts suddenly collapsed and scattered all over the floor.

In the end, the only valuable thing Zhao Xu found was a pile of ancient gold coins. He didn't have the skill to appraise the value and was afraid to waste money on it. So, he had to find someone to appraise the value of these ancient coins.

Unfortunately, the appraisal skill couldn't be used in this case.

After searching, Zhao Xu got up and walked towards the hallway. The "Unquenchable Flame" torch on the wall, which had been lit for 100 years, was still in good condition, and the 50 gold coins spent on the material fee for the spell were worth it.

After leaving the dining room, Zhao Xu realized that this was a residential area, with a sign above that read "Kitchen". The kitchen was equipped with an iron gate and had been locked with a horizontal beam.

Zhao Xu didn't quite understand what was going on, but after the storage room incident, he decided to search the entire room.

He quietly opened the kitchen door and was about to peek inside when he suddenly smelled a foul odor.

Reacting quickly, Zhao Xu kicked the door open with his legs and quickly retreated back to the dining room.

In the moment he just flashed back, a dark figure suddenly emerged from the kitchen and hit the ground with a loud thud.

Zhao Xu took a closer look and saw that it was a corpse with rotten skin and a stench, with a body shape that was highly irregular and with visible skeletal structures. Zhao Xu was sure that if the two women saw this scene, they would definitely start vomiting.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

"This corpse-eating demon, no matter when it looks, always seems very disgusting.

The opponent's eyes, like hot coal blocks, stared intensely, accompanied by deep-set eye sockets that exuded an unclear evil sense.

"Clack, clack" a few sounds echoed.

Immediately afterwards, the other four corpse-eating demons also jumped out together.

They glared at Zhao Xun with a ferocious expression, but dared not make a move.

The people in front of him were too calm.

"Fireball spell!"

In this instant, Zhao Xun didn't say a word, took out the Eternal Magic Staff in his hand, and released the most typical shape-shifting magic.

In an instant, the flying fireball struck the back of the corpse-eating demons.

Before they could react, the entire space was engulfed by the waves of hellfire.

The scorching flames wrapped around and consumed the corpse-eating demons one by one.

The magic fire, fierce and swift, had already disappeared from sight in less than two or three seconds.

The air was still filled with the smell of sulfur, but there was no sign of the flames.

Zhao Xun saw the scene and shook his head slightly, then stepped over the corpse-eating demons that had been killed by the fireball spell. They were all charred and fragile, and would break apart if touched.

Corpse-eating demons themselves possess a paralyzing attack, and ordinary people who are wrapped up by it may even be paralyzed to death.

As for Zhao Xun, the natural weapon of the corpse-eating demons is ineffective against him.

However, Zhao Xun also hated those corpse-eating demons and naturally didn't want them to crawl all over him."
Here is the translation of the text:

At this time, Zhao Xu also didn't have the capital to throw another fireball into the kitchen to explore, so he waited for a while and then used a wooden stick to pry open the door that had been closed again, and then he took a look inside.

At first glance, Zhao Xu's heart couldn't help but feel a chill.

The entire kitchen was still in the same classical layout as it had been hundreds of years ago, but various stoves and tables were covered in scratches, and various utensils had been overturned on the floor.

The only thing that wasn't rotten was the food.

Then Zhao Xu thought back to the recently barricaded door.

He couldn't help but reveal a faint sympathetic expression as he gazed at the several corpses of the undead that had died on the ground.

High-ranking clergy would not personally cook meals.

Even if they had divine abilities to create exquisite cuisine, they would not waste it, unless it was to create a dish that could enhance their status in battle.

This meant that these undead corpses had all been cooks and servants who had once worked for the clergy.

After the clergy of death left, they were locked in here and slowly starved to death, and those who survived even died eventually turned into undead creatures.

Zhao Xu lost his desire to explore and turned around, his eyes scanning the dry bones on the ground before leaving.

His only intention was that if he really died in the future, he would make sure to give himself a "protection against evil" before he died.

So that he wouldn't become an undead creature for the rest of his life and never find peace.

Zhao Xu continued to walk forward, bypassing the rooms on the side, including the library, bedroom, and conference room, and eventually reached the end of the corridor.

After discovering that there might be undead creatures here, Zhao Xu chose to conduct a comprehensive search first.

He walked through the corridor and passed by over ten rooms, and roughly understood the layout of this residential area.
At the end of the corridor, there was a door with no nameplate or any other markings. It was only half-closed and was not locked. Zhao Xu looked at the intricate patterns on the door and couldn't help but ponder the meaning behind them. Suddenly, Zhao Xu gently kicked the door with his foot while pointing his magic wand forward. As the flames from the immortal torch in his hand broke through the darkness ahead, Zhao Xu saw—

Thirteen stone coffins, arranged in the hall, accompanied by the dark, heavy drapes above, exuding a solemn atmosphere. Each coffin had an introduction carved on it.

Xixi, an eight-ring pastor, died on June 13th of the year of return.

Tams, a seven-ring pastor, died on June 13th of the year of return.

...Endric, a nine-ring pastor, died on June 13th of the year of return.

Zhao Xu's gaze swept the entire area, all the way to the front. On the wall of this graveyard, written in blood-like paint was a single line:

May my lord be reborn after death.
