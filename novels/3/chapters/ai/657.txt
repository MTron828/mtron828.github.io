Chapter 658: Severe Pollution, Chemical Warfare

When Zhao Xu heard these words, he felt hesitant, but still decided to step forward.

Because he had realized that approaching this mysterious giant stone building had weakened the muffled voices in his mind.

He began to take slow and heavy steps into the interior.

This was a primal drive that originated from his instincts.

At this moment, the muffled voices in the cave began to change.

These were mysterious tonal sounds that transcended the world and did not belong to any similar language.

By this time, Zhao Xu's body had already solidified the "Magic Constant" and "Art of Eloquence" through the "Five Rings" technique.

Even if it was a malevolent "Deep Language" or "Hellish Language", he could still speak without error.

However, the mysterious voices in front of him, for some reason, he couldn't help but want to imitate, but couldn't even utter a single word.

Although it was an incomprehensible and inexpressible thing, it was still able to intuitively react to what was being said.

As Zhao Xu took one step after another into the depths of the stone door, the space continued to resonate with various mysterious incantations.

"With the name of the land of Iha·Ensr and its residents, praise the ruler of all."

"With the seal of Kish and all those who submit to this seal, praise the one who seals."

"With the name of the gate of Ye and all those who use this gate - those who have gone and those who will go, praise the one who stands at the gate."

......

Compared to the caves or underground cities that he had previously entered, even ancient tomb caves, they were all neatly arranged with stairs.

Inside the building, aside from the dark and eerie atmosphere, there are no complete lines or shapes, with pillars scattered everywhere, overturning the spatial order. Meanwhile, the air is filled with an unbearable stench, reminiscent of a long-abandoned tomb, and the pungent smell is so overwhelming that it makes people want to vomit. Even Zhao Xu, who can survive without breathing, has given up on his natural instinct to breathe and is holding his breath.

Slowly, the sound of heavy footsteps echoes through the air, as if someone is about to appear in front of him. Then, the sound of dripping water can be heard, accompanied by a mysterious, pungent liquid dripping sound. Zhao Xu looks back at the stone door that has opened behind him, gazing at the horizon that seems to be a line between heaven and earth. He quietly pulls out a copper sphere-shaped astrolabe from his pocket.

Simultaneously, he operates the device, slowly synchronizing the astrolabe with the world in front of him. Initially, he thinks this is a level in some abyss, and even Arthur might appear here soon. However, the mysterious whispers tear apart his thoughts, halting his actions, and he only manages to delay his investigation until now.

One minute later, the astrolabe begins to display concrete data. But Zhao Xu's eyebrows furrow in concern as he looks at the result. The data has no connection to any of the planes in the Astral Realm. If he had seen this instantaneously, Zhao Xu would have been able to determine that this was a plane in the Arthurian Universe. Is this a half-plane? Zhao Xu silently gathers his magical energy, thinking about the current location of the Astral Realm.

"Teleportation spell!"
【Adventurer Zhong Xia, your teleportation spell has failed.]
Here is the translation of the text:

As the magical energy was depleted, the magical position in Zhao Xu's mind was directly lost. However, he quickly used his latent points to recover.

Next, Zhao Xu pulled out a "Interdimensional Transportation" scroll from the endless scroll box.

This "Interdimensional Transportation" is also an elemental magic in the Kaifeng school, and it is a five-ring divine magic, whereas in terms of occult, it is a seven-ring wizardry.

The spell can transport living beings to another plane, and at most, it can transport eight people at a time. As long as it is triggered on the main material plane, it can basically reach any other plane, with a distance error of 10 to 1000 kilometers, and it is only a one-way ticket.

As for higher-level interdimensional transportation (God 7, Wizard 8), it can transport to a precise location.

As Zhao Xu recited the incantation on the scroll, the mysterious text on the surface began to disappear, and the five-ring divine magic scroll worth 1125 gold coins also slowly turned into a blank piece of vellum worth one silver coin.

The scene around Zhao Xu became blurry for a moment before returning to its original state.

The answer is self-evident.

It's not that he can't transport here, but he has failed again.

In an instant, Zhao Xu suddenly deduced the possibility.

Either he gave the wrong "transportation destination" or he got it wrong from the start.

After thinking it over, Zhao Xu finally realized that the biggest possibility was that he was not in his Arthurian heaven.

"I didn't expect to run into a scholar of ancient scripts here!"

Just then, Zhao Xu suddenly heard a strange and hoarse voice.

At this moment, even if he was not used to it, he still quickly cast the "Turtle Vision" spell, gaining a "Panoramic Vision" to obtain a comprehensive view of the surroundings.
Here is the translation of the given text:

Suddenly, his whole body felt like it had multiple compound eyes, allowing him to see a 360-degree view around him at once. He directly lifted his head, gazing at the mysterious figure suspended above his head.

"Do you know the scholar of ancient tomes?" he asked, grateful that his opponent was using a language that, although not from King Arthur's time, he could still understand through his cunning words.

He then controlled his flight ability, resisting the downward pull of gravity, and floated up into the air. This allowed him to get a clear view of the scrawny man sitting opposite him.

But just as he was taking in the man's appearance, he almost gasped in shock from the inside.

The man who had just spoken had one eye that had completely rotted away, with only a faint green flame flickering in the empty socket. Below, his nose was covered in rotting flesh and soft tissue, leaving only a large, skull-like cavity.

Even more terrifying was the black mold that spread across the man's entire body, resembling a plague that had infected every joint, including his head, which had also deformed.

Upon first glance, he looked like someone who had crawled out of hell, having endured countless brutal tortures, or a victim of a nuclear blast who had undergone horrific mutations.

At this moment, the fine details finally awakened Zhao Xu's memories.

"Is it severe pollution?" Zhao Xu asked, his voice filled with doubt.

"Oh?"

Suddenly, the deformed man opposite him let out a shockingly strange laugh, only to start coughing up blood from his nose and ears. The black wounds on his body also continued to ooze out worms.

"Don't worry about it, or should we communicate with our minds?" Zhao Xu suggested.

He was worried that the man might collapse where he stood if he spoke a few more words.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Ah-ah." The deformed man covered his mouth and coughed, "It's nothing, because most of the visitors who come here are from other dimensions. It's rare to see a scholar of the ancient arts from our own world, so I'm just thrilled."

"So, you know the scholar of the ancient arts?" Zhao Xu asked.

The phrase "scholar of the ancient arts" has already revealed an infinite amount of information.

Annie Noir once told him that the term "scholar of the ancient arts" referred to a profession that originated from a terrifying and unknown world!

"Hey, it seems you're not an adventurer from our world."

The deformed man spoke with a tone of disappointment, clearly revealing the details.

However, he still looked somewhat puzzled. "According to logic, scholars of the ancient arts rarely leak out, because only those who have seen the ancient stone tablets can formally advance. Moreover, scholars of the ancient arts are more likely to be summoned to Asharoth, rather than the old ruler of this place, Cthulhu."

Although Zhao Xu didn't hear about Asharoth and Cthulhu, he still maintained his vigilance.

The man in front of him hadn't said a word, but his blood was still flowing, and he couldn't stop it.

"Do you need me to cast a four-ring recovery spell on you?" Zhao Xu asked.

The other person was a rare living being he had met since coming here, and if he died suddenly, it would be a problem.

The man shook his head listlessly, "It's useless."

"It's pointless to stay here. Your body will gradually decay and your spirit will fall into corruption. This is an irreversible process."

"And don't even mention the premise of becoming a scholar of the ancient arts, which requires a moderate to severe degree of corruption."

"You're only seeing my physical corruption now. When my mental state starts to deteriorate, that's when things will get complicated. I advise you to make the most of the time with me while I'm still normal."

Scholar of the ancient arts!
Zhao Xu's eyes widened in shock.

According to rumors, it was said that through the "Pollution Incantation", one could summon a terrifying existence that would increase the difficulty level by several dozen levels.
