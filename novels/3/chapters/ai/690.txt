Chapter 691: The Grand Spell of the Tower

Zhao Xu thought it was beautiful, but if these walls really had magical properties, he wondered if his three-ring spell "Dispelling Magic" would really be able to effectively dispel the corresponding magical effects. The source of the three-ring "Dispelling Magic" spell is limited to a maximum of 10th-level spellcaster, while the six-ring "High-Level Dispelling Magic" spell is limited to a maximum of 20th-level spellcaster.

It's difficult to make a silk purse out of a sow's ear. Once the gap is opened, it's not possible to break through with just one try. Ultimately, Zhao Xu still had to muster up the courage to continue to cast spells to enhance his speed, enduring and consuming his mental energy, waiting patiently.

【Adventurer Summer, you cast the one-ring "Big Steps" spell on yourself, increasing your ground speed by 0.5 meters per second, lasting 33 hours.】
【Adventurer Summer, you cast the one-ring "Sole Grease" spell on yourself, increasing your ground speed by 1.5 meters per second, lasting 33 minutes.】
【Adventurer Summer, you cast the two-ring "Lightfoot" spell on yourself, increasing your ground speed by 0.5 meters per second, lasting 12 hours.】
【Adventurer Summer, you cast the four-ring "Wind Aid" spell on yourself, increasing your speed by 100%, lasting 12 hours.】
Just by enhancing his walking speed, Zhao Xu managed to play out a bunch of speed-enhancing spells.

One is not enough, two are not too many.
Not to mention later, he also cast the two-ring "Spider's Pace" spell on himself, gaining the ability to walk on vertical walls.
Here is the translation of the text:

At the same time, Zhao Xu also simulated the "Spell of Immunity" for himself. Otherwise, he would have to swallow a drop of asphalt and a living spider to cast this spell, which was quite disgusting.

As a precaution, Zhao Xu also cast the "Stabilizing Step" spell, considering the possible changes in the terrain ahead.

For 33 minutes, he would become as steady as a mountain goat, with the magic allowing him to walk on uncertain terrain as if it were flat ground.

After suffering through 20 cycles of repeated traps, Zhao Xu finally let out a sigh of relief, as he had received information about successfully passing the first level from the vacuum above.

There was a clear endpoint, and the game was on.

Zhao Xu had also figured out the entire game rules.

In this enclosed room the size of a basketball court, he viewed all traps as inevitable and then repeated them 20 times.

It was easy to say, but even Arthur's countless souls might not be able to endure it.

According to the 13 types of traps Zhao Xu had just experienced, he had endured 260 first-level traps.

Two or three first-level traps were not a big deal, but when they came in groups of 13, even he felt a bit anxious.

Even with magic abilities, it was impossible to withstand such prolonged exhaustion.

Before Zhao Xu could let out a sigh of relief and relax, he couldn't help but laugh.

The second level was a 12-challenge level 2 trap.

This included the "Brown Fungus Trap", "Ceiling Brick Trap", "Inferno Hand Trap", "Fake Pit Trap", "Light Injury Trap", "Rifle Trap", "Net Trap", "Pit Trap", "Poison Needle Trap", "Stabbing Trap", and "Twisted Chain Trap" and "Highly Fake Pit Trap".
Here is the translation of the text:

These traps were like a grand feast, with each one targeting him in turn. Zhao Xu also saw the appearance of magical traps, and as for some level one traps that had just been upgraded from the original, he simply ignored them, thinking that it was futile to try to kill someone who couldn't be killed.

Knowing that he only needed to persevere to get through safely, Zhao Xu actually felt quite confident this time. His flying ability was restricted, and he was forced to walk on the stone floor, still moving about like a jumping sprite. Slowly but surely, the voice of the automated announcer could be heard more frequently.

Even when he reached the 10th level of traps, which was the peak of regular traps, there were only six types left. Fortunately, these traps were all inanimate objects, even if they could still deal 2-8 levels of damage. Zhao Xu still managed to dodge them using his own defense abilities.

As for the traps that triggered when touched, Zhao Xu had no way to avoid them. The entire room was completely enveloped by the haunting song of the female demon, which sounded like a demon was screaming in his ear, scratching the ground with its claws and producing a sharp, piercing sound.

Fortunately, Zhao Xu had prepared early on and had already cast the "Four Rings of Defense" spell, which allowed him to resist all death magic, magical death effects, energy absorption, and other negative energy effects. He had to bear the consequences and get through it.

It was undeniable that in the subsequent trap rooms, with the all-encompassing trap attacks, such as the "Acid Fog Trap", Zhao Xu was faced with an impossible situation, and he could only choose to fight back. He even used his life force to bear the brunt of it.
Here is the translation of the text:

Thanks to his 300 HP, a legendary adventurer's life value that not many have, he has enough tolerance to take a beating.

Even so, he gazed at the ceiling above, mercilessly crushed by the falling stone, and Zhao Xu's mind was filled with despair.

The pressure trap, a typical representative of an unbeatable trap, can instantly kill all targets in the room, dealing 16-96 (16D6) points of damage.

After all, having over 100 points of HP, saying that he can't be killed is an understatement for these adventurers. Even if he's crushed by a giant stone, with his bones broken and shattered, he won't die. This is the norm for a high-HP creature.

Zhao Xu had prepared himself, casting the "Body Transformation" spell on himself.

Arthur's air is too thick, but Zhao Xu can still find several opportunities to avoid it. He can't let himself be avoided by the spirit realm, but he didn't stop himself from changing his form.

He instantly transformed into a translucent, misty fog, with all his magical items becoming nonexistent. He waited for the stone to crush him.

His speed dropped to less than half a meter per second, and he could only fly slowly.

He also had the "Healing of Mortal Wounds" ability, which could recover up to 52 (4D8+level, MAX level) HP. He could put it on himself at any time to prevent unexpected situations from occurring.

After all, he could only use "Dispel Magic" to remove the transformation spell, but the opponent might not be able to use "Eradicating Spell". The situation was uncertain, and Zhao Xu had prepared to use the "Shape-Shifting" spell of the four rings, transforming into a microscopic life form and hiding in the wall cracks.
Here is the translation of the text:

Throughout the entire process, none of these traps had any effect on Zhao Xu. The activation pit followed Ernest's "trial" and taught the most basic "martial arts". As for the seven-level summoning monster trap, the Ha Ma demon summoned by it was smashed by Zhao Xu with a ruthless and merciless hammer blow. Finally, after going through the 10th level of magical traps, Zhao Xu regained his spirit and became extremely cautious, preparing for the unknown traps of the 11th level.

Legendary trap? Zhao Xu was full of questions. This was not recorded in any books, and he had never seen it before, so he was naturally very curious. Others might not be able to put the legendary spell into the trap, but Ernest knew that this secret chamber might be the only place where it exists. Just as the sound of drums and gongs came from the secret room, Zhao Xu had a bad premonition.

As he looked at the stone carving of a dragon's head rotating on the wall, Zhao Xu's eyes widened, and he almost shouted out in anger! Curse tower! Is he really treating him like a terrorist? Zhao Xu cursed in his heart, but his hand movements didn't stop, still casting spells.

When he first entered the mysterious underground mine, the eight-ring mage Rayn had cast a spell, creating an illusionary curse tower. It was famous for its reputation. However, it became too complicated and worried Zhao Xu, who wasn't familiar with it. Because every student of the floating city's magic school is warned at the beginning of their studies about its power and the danger of triggering it.
Here is the translation of the text:

At that time, Lightning Angel himself cast spells, consecutively casting fireball spells, touch of the undead, and other spells to bombard the area, completely deceiving Zhao Xu and his companions.

Thanks to Zhao Xu carrying the staff given by Anziano, he was able to unleash the maximum potential of the staff's internal magic, "Invalidation Barrier", during the cooldown period of the fifth round, and managed to escape the coverage range of the curse cannon tower.

Zhao Xu looked up and couldn't help but feel a sense of shock. There were over a hundred curse cannon towers!

All of them were genuine, lined up in a row, row after row.

Has the Mage Association gone bankrupt?
Has the Association President fled with his niece?
Now, curse cannon towers worth tens of thousands of yuan are being sold in bulk!

The curse cannon towers around the high tower of the floating city of Mistral, the final scroll, were about the same level.

Zhao Xu couldn't help but shake his head.

Curse cannon towers are, in essence, a highly threatening item, situated between traps and constructed bodies.

Strong mages generally prefer to use curse cannon towers to defend important areas of the Mage Tower or Association, while priests prefer to place them in the tombs of their most revered devotees.

If someone really couldn't be revived after death, Zhao Xu would, for the sake of their peace, definitely not hesitate to crush a pile of curse cannon towers and combine them with psychological defense, making it a level of "who comes, who dies".

Although he had encountered this kind of thing before, Zhao Xu still honestly searched for mysterious knowledge and relearned the details of this item.

Curse cannon towers are often placed at the end of corridors, installed on walls or ceilings.

When not activated, they are completely ordinary, blending in with the surrounding materials and having a spell-detection avoidance magic.
Here is the translation:

The key point is that these things have a 40-meter range of true knowledge, and once they get close and are recognized by the trigger, they will be directly locked in for attack.

Otherwise, Zhao Xu wants to transform into a pseudo-doppelganger on the spot to see if he can get away with it.

Typically, the shape of these incantation cannons is a water crystal pole, a tower, or a stone statue with an outstretched arm.

Just as Zhao Xu was thinking, he noticed that these incantation cannons were starting to accumulate energy simultaneously, preparing to shoot towards him.

As expected!

Zhao Xu cursed under his breath, realizing at this moment why he had suddenly received over ten untraceable binding spells.

It turned out that these incantation cannons were summoned to attack him on the spot.

The activation of these incantation cannons is quite shameless.

Incantation cannons can store up to four spells at the same time, but they must be of the same level and type, and then assigned to different schools.

Once activated, these incantation cannons will release the stored spells at a rate of one per round, until the fifth round, and then pause to repair 4D8+20 points of damage, similar to a life-saving effect.

At this moment, the one hundred incantation cannons that synchronized firing all revealed to Zhao Xu through his secret eye that they were all different types of one-ring spells.

Zhao Xu's hand suddenly shot up.

"Invalid secondary spell boundary."

This means that under the protection of this spell barrier, he had no need to worry about any spells below the three-ring level.

The eleventh barrier was a one-ring incantation cannon.

And the nineteenth barrier was a nine-ring incantation cannon?

Considering that one hundred nine-ring spells were shooting towards him at the same time, Zhao Xu, who was originally calm and collected, suddenly felt a surge of blood flowing through his body, and his facial blood vessels dilated, causing his face to turn red.

One hundred!

Nine-ring!
Here is the translation of the text to English:

"This is not something he can block at all!"
Mr. Strala is not of this level at all!
Complaining aside, Zhao Xu has already realized that the 11th to the 13th stages are not very difficult, and these three stages will be his most critical spell-casting time.
He must prepare his spells in advance to face the upcoming waves of four-ring and five-ring magic.
It's like a hundred-man mage team aiming at him.
Zhao Xu also secretly guesses that he should treat the next four waves as one wave, and repeat this for 20 waves, and he will be able to smoothly pass the 11th stage.
In this stage, he needs to withstand 1000 cannonballs, 4 waves of simultaneous firing, and 20 waves, or 8000 one-ring magic attacks.
After taking a deep breath, Zhao Xu quickly scans the entire area with his gaze and silently calculates the frequency distribution of one-ring magic.
However, after the first wave's fourth wave of simultaneous firing, his complexion has already changed slightly.
After calculating, the biggest pattern is that there is no pattern!
Whether it's the Arcane Table or the Divine Table, they're all the same!
Common spells like Summon Monster, Enchantment, Burning Hand, Seven-Colored Spray, Fear, Cold Touch, Magic Missile, Sleep, and Electric Claw are more common.
But some less common spells like Suffocation, Krugel Fire Arrow, Eternal Blade, Sonic Blast, and so on are also bombarding him, which means Zhao Xu can't even get a rough idea.
Especially those low-level monsters summoned by one-ring summoning magic, such as the sea turtles, hellish ravens, and hellish ferrets, which will disappear once they enter the barrier.
However, considering the situation afterwards, Zhao Xu still chose to launch a thorough map bombing, clearing these monsters out first. But now the question is:

After the Four Rings' intervention in the 14th level, how would he fight?
