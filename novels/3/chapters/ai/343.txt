Chapter 344, 6th Grade Level

After getting a guaranteed response from Zhao Xu, Zhang Qi also returned to his girlfriend with a satisfied expression.

Since the battle at Star Lake, the group of friends who played games in Zhao Xu's class had become more united.

Especially after joining the small town's management, everyone felt a sense of honor and invested more in the game.

At least according to Zhao Xu's knowledge, not only his classmates, but also players from the entire city's high school alliance, had improved significantly after this battle, from their levels to their equipment.

The influence of Zhao Xu's rebirth began to manifest slowly.

As for the guild, it seemed that the "Star Lake" branch would be established, but Zhao Xu didn't pay much attention to it.

In fact, he had been in "Floating City" for a relatively short time.

It was just that the memory from his previous life was like this.

He even vaguely remembered that the vice chairman position of the Star Lake branch was vacant.

This led to a few thoughts flashing through Zhao Xu's mind.

After looking at books for half an hour, Zhao Xu basically reviewed the content of the next day's exam and felt at ease, then turned his attention to the game forum.

As for other exam subjects, he would naturally wait until the first exam was over and then review. No, he should be preparing.

After the Star Lake battle, the forum was upgraded for the first time, with many sub-forums established based on the suggestions of players, divided by city.

Zhao Xu clicked on the "Mistral" sub-forum, and sure enough, it mentioned the mysterious event of the Mistral Cathedral in the early morning.
Here is the translation of the text:

After that, the demon didn't make a big splash, and was directly eliminated by the surrounding priests. The entire process was described in a very plain tone, but it also indicated that it had reached a level that the player couldn't touch.

Zhao Xu felt a sense of regret and didn't think much about it, directly flipping through the recent forum hot topics. His previous post, asking what would happen if the whole nation crossed over today, also started to attract a lot of traffic. Especially after he occasionally replied to some explosive opinions in the post, it was able to attract a lot of heat.

Time just passed quietly, until the next day Zhao Xu logged in again, and there was no exception. It seemed that everyone didn't know he had been blocked by "Glazette" before, nor did they know that "Sisilvina" had descended to rescue Zhao Xu yesterday.

From then on, Zhao Xu's days were quiet, and he restored to his normal routine. He solidified his abilities in the floating city, and read magical texts in the "Legend Library" every day. Meanwhile, he wandered around the "Civil Service Academy", "Floating City", and "Holy Heart Cathedral", slowly getting to know some novice players who had not yet taken office, and meeting a mysterious instructor named "Zhong Xia".

As winter approached, the snow began to fall, giving the city streets a layer of frost. Many pedestrians began to wear thicker coats, and those who went out were in a hurry. However, some players from the south deliberately went to the streets of Mistral, jumping and playing, feeling the first realistic "snow scene" in this virtual simulation game.
Here is the translation:

As for Zhao Xu, he had planned to return to his hometown after completing his exams. He had already booked his ticket and was waiting for the time to come. Now, he was sitting in his dorm room, leaning against a soft and thick cushioned chair, smelling the fragrance of the alchemy experiment on the workbench, and tapping his fingers to the beat while feeling a sense of accomplishment.

In the three months since the server opened, a 4th-level player had already appeared among the players. However, the "Star Sky Inversion" had not activated the "Jumping Rule" again, and there were no more notifications from the "Genesis Holy Temple" on the forum. It was as if some things had returned to normal.

Some players speculated that there might be an insurmountable obstacle between 5th and 6th levels, which made the "Star Sky Inversion" anxious. Others urged the "Star Sky Inversion" to share its difficulties and let everyone help solve them, but there was no response.

The "Star Sky Inversion" was like a shooting star, flashing and disappearing without a trace.

It wasn't until recently that new speculations emerged on the forum, suggesting that the "Star Sky Inversion" might have used up all five resurrection stones and closed its account.

The main argument of the supporters was that since the Star Lake Battle, there had been no sightings of the "Star Sky Inversion" on the forum, as if it had disappeared from the world. Zhao Xu did not respond.

He was like a diver, observing the daily hotspots on the forum, including the posting frequency of the "Star Sky Inversion" account, which had been decreasing.
Finally, Zhao Xu sat down on the stool, lightly tapping the tip of his finger on the desk to complete the last beat.

He gazed at the third notebook on the table in front of him. At the same time, the initial combination of the first and second notebooks was placed beside the test tube set.

After this period of time, he had basically copied the contents of the third notebook, even if the data on the previous page was lost. This was also the reason he didn't rush to combine the notebooks initially.

Taking a deep breath, Zhao Xu bit his teeth and directly merged the two black-covered notebooks together.

The "No. 1 + No. 2" and "No. 3" notebooks were pasted together, one on top of the other.

Suddenly, the room was shielded from all forms of divination and prophecy. It seemed to sway slightly, as if translucent.

The candle on the desk flickered dimly.

The two notebooks seemed to be attracted to each other like magnets, automatically sticking together tightly.

In the gap between them, a mysterious glow burst out, flashing and trembling continuously.

Each tremor would split off a thread of light, which would directly transform into a bookbinding, as if to pin the two notebooks together like a bound book.

Zhao Xu, who had undergone the same experience, was naturally familiar with the process.

After six seconds, he also relaxed his grip on the "Time Reversal Talisman", knowing that he had missed the last chance to restore the notebooks to their original state.

About ten minutes later, the glow on the notebook began to fade away, like the receding tide of sunset, gradually revealing the area where the notebooks were attached.
Zhao Xu directly picked up the notebook and took a look. He found that it was similar to the first edition of the augmented version, as if it had been remade. Only the large characters "Summer Solstice Magic Notes" on the cover remained clear and unchanged, just like what he had written a month ago.

Zhao Xu lightly tapped his "mechanism eye mirror" and suddenly a "detection magic" was cast. This basic zero-ring detection spell was converted through the eye mirror into a "judgment spell", allowing Zhao Xu to bypass the 100-gold pearl material.

At the same time, the notebook itself entered Zhao Xu's mind, transmitting its own information.

["Summer Solstice Magic Notes" is the ultimate treasure of the spellcaster profession. After reading this book for one minute, the spellcaster profession will be upgraded to the next level.
Current magic note completeness: 3/7.]

Every time Zhao Xu saw this sentence, he would feel ashamed of the notebook's sparse content.

However, he still spread open the first page of the notebook and began to read the contents. Suddenly, within this short minute, Zhao Xu saw content that was not recorded in the original three notebooks. It was a profound truth about magic, a feeling about life, levels, and professional abilities, which was poured into his mind.

At the same time, the advanced professional insight that Zhao Xu had obtained from the "Seven Seven" stone monument suddenly erupted like a pot of boiling water, vibrating intensely and spreading to every corner of his mind.

It turned into a more subtle and widespread "enlightenment", elevating his thinking pattern.

Even Zhao Xu felt the life energy emanating from the book.
He was like a whirlpool, constantly stirring up his own vortex, absorbing everything related to the book. However, Zhao Xu still felt that he was short of something.

In the end, he had advanced too quickly, using most of his time to accumulate experience. But Zhao Xu still underestimated the difficulty of this time.

This time, he had gained the insight of advancing his profession, and he had already entered a state of being one step ahead. He would not be like before, advancing his level first and then gradually solidifying his professional skills.

As the one with the Seven Transmissions of the Dao, as long as he could reach level 6, all his abilities would be instantly equipped. This also unconsciously increased the height of the wall he needed to overcome, and he could only grit his teeth and persevere.

Slowly, beads of sweat began to form on Zhao Xu's forehead.

He knew he had made some miscalculations.

This was due to the fact that he had never advanced in his previous life.

Arthur was never a simple leveling game, nor was it a game where players could arrange their leveling as they pleased.

In reality, most people's destinies were controlled by fate.

It was possible that one day, leveling would not go as planned, and instead, the levels of other professions would rise.

After all, nothing could be as desired as people hoped, which was the current state of most players.

They did not know the optimization methods, nor did they know which profession had strong abilities.

But everything had no choice.

Zhao Xu was also facing the same situation, unless there was a new variable. Otherwise, he would likely continue to miss his chance to advance.

He would continue to overlook this opportunity.

Thinking of this, Zhao Xu suddenly clenched his fist and pinched his thigh, trying to clear his mind.
Here is the translation of the text:

It's just that all this lacked an effect. He was lacking in foundation, so when he broke through, he was missing that spark, and couldn't jump even higher. He was like a pot of water that was about to boil, but just when it reached 95 degrees, it had already burned out the last piece of charcoal.

If only he had accumulated a bit more!

At this moment, Zhao Xu's eyes were starting to glow red, looking like he was about to make a desperate effort.

Just then, Anniya suddenly appeared behind him.

Having gone through the process of leveling up with the "Book of Knowledge" herself, she was not unfamiliar with this scene. She had even demoted herself due to going in the wrong direction, so she was well aware of Zhao Xu's current predicament.

Anniya's expression turned nostalgic as she gazed at Zhao Xu's back, saying, "Unleash your potential."

Zhao Xu didn't even think twice, and his subconscious directly drove him to take the action required by the voice.

In an instant, all the remaining potential points on Zhao Xu's body were directly activated and consumed, and the direct energy flowed through his bloodstream like a fleet of ships.

"Prayer spell." Suddenly, Anniya directly cast the spell, but the wish she had made afterwards was lost on Zhao Xu, who had already lost consciousness.
