Chapter 5: Defects and Specialties

From the moment I created my account after the server went online 8 months ago, the scene is almost the same.

Zhao Xu was thinking and taking steps towards the staircase at the same time.

The atmosphere in the entire hall was so quiet that it made Zhao Xu feel the realism of this game, Arthur.

Many players even went around the statues to explore and see if they could trigger any special storyline.

Knowing that this hall would not have any differences, Zhao Xu did not waste much time.

Or, he was not sure if the gods were watching them at this moment in the game.

"Click."

As Zhao Xu stepped onto the first step of the staircase, a white light suddenly enveloped him, like a warm light pouring down from the sky, making people feel reborn.

"A player needs to take a profession recommendation test or directly choose a profession, please choose."

The voice prompt echoed in Zhao Xu's ear, sounding like a whisper in someone's ear.

In front of him, eleven adventurer statues appeared, each about the height of an arm, forming a circle around him. These statues represented the following eleven basic professions: warrior, barbarian, monk, rogue, bard, ranger, paladin, druid, priest, mage, and wizard. The last four professions were the ones that could ultimately cast level 9 spells.
According to Arthur's average level, many mages and sorcerers have a hard time making it to the mid to late stages of the game. Their low initial HP and limited spell slots make them frequent visitors to the graveyard.

Now, let's take a step up the ladder, and either choose directly or answer questions for the system to judge our inclinations. With each step up the ladder, the system will automatically present a question.

By answering the questions, the system will naturally analyze the player's inclinations, such as preferring melee combat, and the corresponding profession icons will brighten up. Conversely, icons related to ranged combat and magic will dim.

The remaining high-lighted icons will eventually be the system's recommended professions.

It's clear that answering questions is actually the best approach.

Not only do careers like druids, priests, and paladins have behavioral and faction requirements, but even barbarians, a purely combat-focused profession, have faction requirements.

Once you violate the requirements of your profession and faction, you may not be able to level up that profession, and you may only be able to switch to a different profession.

In extreme cases, paladins may lose most of their abilities.

This is a lesson learned by countless players through their blood and tears.

Disobeying your heart's choice means you'll have to prepare for a lifetime.

Zhao Xu has no hesitation in choosing the ladder path.

Because he heard a city legend in his past life that says:

On the first day of the server opening, answering questions until only one glowing profession icon remains, and choosing it as the leveling profession will grant a one-time opportunity to exchange a flaw for a specialization.

Specialization is actually an alternative talent tree. Players can only obtain specialization at level 1, 3, 6, and so on.

After the official opening of Arthur's game, it was claimed that it would be fully AI-managed.

Initially, few people knew the value of specialization.

Some players even chose to extinguish the profession icon after obtaining the unique recommended profession, missing the flaw system.
Here is the translation:

Some players see the list of flaws and think the punishment is too severe, refusing to exchange flaws and giving up on obtaining specialties. Others are cautious, exchanging only one flaw and giving up the opportunity to exchange two flaws for two specialties. If there were no restrictions, Zhao Xun would not care if dozens of flaws came his way, as long as he could exchange them for dozens of specialties.

Zhao Xun's current predicament is that he doesn't know how to demonstrate his elite profession. He wants to keep one or two statues. If both statues glow, is the flaw system unable to be opened? Zhao Xun's lifted foot has been hovering in mid-air, refusing to take a step.

The flaw system, as rumored, is only open during the first 24 hours of the server's operation, and more strictly speaking, each player's first account has the opportunity to do so.

Some people heard about this and gave up their original account, reopened a new account, and tested it, but got nothing. They even returned to the forum to curse the scammers.

Missing this opportunity, the two invaluable specialties will close the door to him.

Zhao Xun's expression gradually turned serious.
