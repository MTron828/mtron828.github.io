Chapter 205: Half-Face

"Ah, by the way, about the arrangements for your 'Steel Will' trial," Lightning suddenly reminded Zhao Xu.

"What's changed?" Zhao Xu asked calmly.

Initially, Zhao Xu had been as cool as a cucumber, having obtained the initial god artifact. This time, he had obtained a lot of gains in the strategy for "Deep Prison Refining Demon". He had also upgraded his skills and was about to solidify his foundation.

As for the "Steel Will" trial, which would grant a free specialization upon completion, Zhao Xu didn't feel particularly urgent about it. However, if he could complete it before entering the trials, he could use the "Thousand Laws Book" to directly convert the trial to the specialization he wanted.

"There's nothing, I had planned to search for the 'Deep Prison Refining Demon' and was preparing to join the queue around here. Since the queue was short, I let the two girls go ahead and try the trial in the 'Cave of Corpse-Eating Beasts' first," Lightning said with a sly grin.

Zhao Xu knew that Lightning was being ridiculous again.

Although the two girls had seen the goblins and were afraid of the old mouse, the opponent was still a person with an unyielding spirit. It was unlikely that he would be the one to rescue the heroine.

"Hey, don't be skeptical, I'll tell you, when I was at level 12, I went to participate in the trial of the 'Cave of Corpse-Eating Beasts' and came back with a stomachache for at least two days. Otherwise, you wouldn't know how this trial refines one's will."
Here is the translation of the text:

"Some mages who failed even gave up on subsequent opportunities to retry because they left behind too deep a shadow. Lei An continued to intimidate Zhao Xu, saying, "You should be careful, Master. I think I have some impression about these additional specialties."

Just then, Lark also chimed in, "Actually, I seem to have some impression about these additional specialties."

Since Lei An appeared, Lark had been keeping silent all along. It wasn't until this moment that she spoke up.

Zhao Xu also noticed that Lei An mentioned that he was 12th level when he went for the trial. A mage who could already cast a six-ring spell would naturally have a fearful mindset, but it seemed that the floating city was not only concerned about their abilities.

"When you get there, you'll know. In fact, the lower the level, the easier it is to pass. It's just that when you're at a low level, you don't get to participate. We arranged for the three of you to participate in the trial because we wanted you to encourage and help each other. We're giving you a bit of a break."

Lei An continued to explain to Zhao Xu, "But now, because of the unexpected situation, the trial process is basically over in two days. If you don't come out within five days, you're considered to have failed. So I can guarantee that you'll meet them halfway."

Zhao Xu continued to ask Lei An, "Is it that hard?"

"It's not hard, mainly because that place is too strange and mysterious. It can replenish the spiritual energy of those who enter the trial and condense their specialties. However, because of this feature, the association cannot interfere, so they set a five-day limit: if you don't come out, they'll send someone to rescue you."

Zhao Xu thought to himself, "Is it really up to myself?"

Fortunately, he had already finished recording the final scroll in the scroll space before his 2-ring spell, so it was no longer a problem."
Here is the translation:

Tomorrow's preparation is a sorcery skill set, which can be merged with a multi-talented spellcaster to combine four ringed sorcery points and three ringed divine points to create 11 ringed sorcery points. At this moment, Zhao Xu dared to boast about his pure combat strength, and in the player community, he was considered to be among the top.

"Lord, I think that trial site is probably a half-plane, and you're only going to the entrance of that place tomorrow," Lark said, providing Zhao Xu with information.

Zhao Xu suddenly felt a little dizzy.

Half-planes are immature plane appendages, which are simply artificial small worlds. In the projection space of the final scroll, Zhao Xu saw 27 planes. The world he is currently in is the material plane of King Arthur, which is the most normal and closest to the lives of ordinary species.

Above this are the transitional planes of spirit, star, and shadow. The ghostly realm that cannot be seen is because the opponent is hiding in the spirit plane, which overlaps with the material plane, making it possible to manifest.

Then there are six inner planes, including the positive and negative energy planes and the four elemental planes. The super-large fire element that Zhao Xu saw was summoned from the fire element plane.

After that, there are 17 outer planes, and the "Deep Furnace Demon" that Zhao Xu just defeated is from the ninth layer of hell, the Barathos hell.

Except for the material plane, these planes have their own characteristics and time-space features.

The 27 main planes are generally infinite. The half-planes attached to them have a range of scales and immature plane features, and it's unclear whether the area is larger or smaller than the floating city.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhou Xu was in the legendary library, where he had read the book "Legendary Magic Compendium", which mentioned a legendary magic that could create a "half-face".

Generally speaking, for high-level wizards, the wizard's tower is their first stronghold. However, the hidden half-face is their second stronghold.

Like many legendary wizards in Floating City, many wizards would set up their stronghold, store their true bodies, and then use the "Nine Ring Magic" "Star Boundary Projection" to split their soul and reconstitute their star body. Then, they would use their star body to go on adventures.

However, Zhou Xu realized that the half-face had its own special rules, so it wouldn't be that easy.

"By the way, the members of Andy's family have been checked and released," said the psychic network to Zhou Xu, "They will basically be under surveillance from now on. Fortunately, there aren't many of them."

Zhou Xu knew that once one was tainted with the devil's influence, it meant that the opponent's family would definitely be unable to spread out in the future and would eventually fall under the invisible hand of Floating City.

"However, some of their belongings have been seized, and you can take a look when you go back. You never know if you'll need something."

The psychic network guessed that Zhou Xu might need Andy's ancestors' other heirlooms.

"Ah, thank you," Zhou Xu thought to himself, realizing the usefulness of his "Rose Cross" apprenticeship, at least allowing him to access those heirlooms openly and honestly.

However, Zhou Xu's thoughts drifted away to another family.

When he returned to Floating City, he actually wanted to visit another family.
According to the notes, seven people who went on an expedition to a mysterious tomb, including three descendants who are now living in Mistral. Andy got his hands on the notes, and the commander's notes also fell into his hands, which allowed him to merge and level up. This also gave him an expectation of a third notebook. If it's the same upgrade effect, wouldn't he be approaching the third circle? The wizard's level increases by 50% or more every time they level up, and if he reaches level 5, he can maintain an overwhelming advantage over players for at least three months.

Suddenly, Rayan's expression changed, and he didn't even bother to check his mental connection, directly saying to Zhao Xu, "I'll have someone send you to the nearby town first, and then you can participate in that trial tomorrow. Someone will arrange it. I'll take care of some issues first."

After that, Zhao Xu was escorted by someone and transported to a place where he had previously planned to rest. He then went to a small town to eliminate bandits.

Zhao Xu didn't say much, but he quietly sat in the largest inn in the town, alone.

"Rakshas? What have you done?" Zhao Xu asked softly after the escorting person left.

"Hey, you're so smart, boss, I'm a bit out of my element," Rakshas said.

"Is that you?" Zhao Xu couldn't help but wonder, and it was clear that it wouldn't be a trivial matter to make Rayan's face change.

"Boss, don't you remember the incident where you stored thirteen coffins in the land of the dead?" Rakshas said.

"I'm definitely not going to remember," Zhao Xu replied immediately, and Rakshas was the one who appeared there and communicated with him, and then they played a small game of magic.
Here is the translation of the text:

"I'm a strange master, you're so calm, don't you ask me why all those people died on the same day?" Lark said with a bad temper.

"Haha," Xu Zhi burst into laughter, "Then tell me, Lark."

"The priests committed suicide together, for their artificial resurrection plan."

"Resurrecting Death?" Xu Zhi was surprised, and he couldn't believe he was discussing divine matters.

"Not exactly," Lark said softly, her voice like a mosquito buzzing in his ear.

"It's just that the priests used their own lives to squeeze out the last bit of vitality from Death, creating a artificial life form, and finally allowing Death to return to that life form."

"That's ridiculous," Xu Zhi suddenly looked suspicious.

"Master, that's where the priests went wrong," Lark said. "After it gained sentience and the ability to think, it would inevitably be dissatisfied with its existence as a substitute."

"It then begged me, my sister, to comfort me, and I taught it a ritual. Just now, it activated the ritual, and with the mysterious power of the altar, it moved the location of the afterlife. With the secret power of the altar, it won't have any problems for a year or two."

"We can't interfere with that," Xu Zhi said, looking down.

"Yeah, Master, but it will come looking for you later."

"What do you mean, come looking for me?" Xu Zhi didn't understand.

"Who made you appear there, where there's no death? Entering that room, unless you die quickly, you'll slowly gain the effects of the ritual, which means you can't obtain the title of Death's servant," Lark said.
Here is the translation:

Zhao Xu heard a snort, his affairs had become too numerous, debts had piled up, and the artificial life form should just join the queue first.

...Zhao Xu still went online before dinner, out of cautious consideration, he still used some residual spell slots and copied some scrolls at that inn.

Tonight, Zhang Qi and his girlfriend are going to celebrate his birthday, not unexpectedly staying away from the dormitory, Zhao Xu didn't think that the other two people wouldn't be there either.

At this time, Zhao Xu opened the computer as usual, and then he saw the hot thread on the forum today.

He was stunned.

What's going on with this guy, does he want to pretend or not?
