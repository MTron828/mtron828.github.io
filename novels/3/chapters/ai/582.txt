Chapter 583: What Kind of Man Are You?

Anshen's words left Zhao Xu completely stunned.

Even with someone as close as a family member, he wouldn't allow them to enter his memories.

Because this would mean that everything from the past to the future would be known to someone else, including a long-forgotten thought that would make one's back feel hot.

This was a completely instinctual sense of shame.

Even if the other person was extremely kind to him, to the point of being willing to take out his heart and liver, Zhao Xu would still hesitate unconsciously.

But now, Anshen was actively asking him to do something he couldn't agree to.

Anshen was placing too much trust in him.

Without lowering his guard, Zhao Xu could not only investigate Anshen's memories but even modify and reshape his personality, having reached the point of being able to manipulate others.

At this moment, Anshen was like injecting an anesthetic in front of Zhao Xu, allowing him to do as he pleased.

"Distinguished Teacher, is this really necessary?" Zhao Xu shook his head, "There are many ways to investigate memories, and there's no need to use such a violent method from the start."

Although it was just a "investigation" to see if there were any signs of tampering with memories.

But "rewriting memories" is a major surgery-level exercise, and Zhao Xu couldn't help but be cautious.

"I've already opened up to you, so I won't hesitate anymore,"

Anshen was also very candid, with a gentle and innocent smile, "In the past thousand years, I've used over a hundred methods to investigate my memories."
Here is the translation of the text:

"Even for a period of time, I intentionally went to a dimension where time flows at a speed that is one-hundredth of normal, and spent exactly 20 years, meticulously recording every detail of my life from birth to the age of 20, reviewing it like rewinding a tape."

"When I was then, I had already noticed some suspicious signs, but couldn't quite form a concrete conclusion, so I could only suspect. It wasn't until this time that I embarked on the nine-layer hell journey that I finally deepened my judgment."

"So, I need you to help me organize my memories of the period before I became a legendary mage at the age of 20."

As soon as Anzhiya finished speaking, a buzzing sound resonated in Zhao Xu's mind.

The focus wasn't on memories, but on the legendary mage!

At the age of 20, a legendary mage has just graduated from college and is still in his early twenties.

That means Anzhiya had encountered Ernest at a young age and, within just ten years, had accumulated the knowledge of other mages, leapfrogging to the legendary level.

In fact, it's said that the youngest legendary mage in the Mage Association is not Kroel, right?"

Zhao Xu asked with a hint of surprise.

"Yeah, that's right. However, there's a condition: the association was indeed like that after its founding, even if Sisylvina was a year younger than the other one," Anzhiya said. "However, I'm no longer within the statistical range."

As Anzhiya spoke, she revealed a proud expression, "Becoming a legendary mage isn't particularly difficult, but it's hard to maintain a reputation even after becoming one, and gradually fade from people's minds. That's truly remarkable."

Zhao Xu also understood that Anzhiya's existence spanned the entire history of the association, with many mages believing her to be the descendant of the Itel Kingdom.

"And Anevia herself is not the kind of person who would suddenly disappear without a word, whether she's going out or casting spells. She's always been a straightforward and loud person, never knowing how to write those words 'silent wealth'. Now it seems that she's relying on this ability to gradually fade away in her memories.

This ability is so powerful that it could even take away the gods who have been sealed away, making them lose all their followers and their only chance to revive through faith.

"'Initially, he used this hidden spell to protect me, using the passage of time to shield me. My former title as a princess has already disappeared from the minds of ordinary people. Only those with a long family lineage can still remember my name.'

"'But I've always suspected that he didn't just set up this one defense. I think he also touched my memories to prevent me from taking rash actions, and intentionally sealed away my past.'

"'However, his memories are too profound, even reaching to this day. I can't even see clearly what he was thinking at the time. Not even the 'Final Scroll' created by the legendary wizard Arthur, which he casually pulled out a notebook and created, is an exception.'

"Speaking of this, Anevia lowered her head, not allowing Zhao Xu to see her expression. 'And I suspect that he set up triggers in my memories, waiting for a specific moment to appear in my mind and tell me the truth.'

"At this moment, Zhao Xu even sensed the slight tremor in Anevia's tone.

"He couldn't help but comfort her, saying, 'So, Master, isn't it better to wait patiently for that day to come?'

"Zhao Xu was clear that sometimes knowing earlier is not always a good thing. Sometimes, knowing earlier can't change the outcome, and it's not necessarily a good thing.

"This time, his encounter was just like that."

It can be said that the butterfly effect caused by Zhao Xū led to a significant improvement in the overall strength of the players, who had accumulated a large number of strategies. However, this had already reached the capacity limit of the channel, ultimately resulting in an early crossing.

Zhao Xū strengthened the average level of the players, but also reduced the overall number of players.

"Just summer," Anxunyoja suddenly lifted her head, her eyes already bearing a hint of redness. "I have been waiting for a million years."

As soon as she spoke, her words were as silent as thunder.

How could she wait any longer?

Zhao Xū's mind was suddenly set ablaze.

A bright blue mystical glow appeared in front of him, as if his vitality had been drained, and then the energy was drawn upwards to the sky.

At that moment, countless residents of the Ailian tribe looked up at the phenomenon, wondering how a mysterious flash had occurred during the day.

Suddenly, the energy hovering in mid-air suddenly transformed into a blue lightning bolt, and the deep and cold arc of light illuminated the entire tower.

This was Zhao Xū's strongest state when he unleashed the "Book of Ten Thousand Laws".

At this moment, the "Book of Ten Thousand Laws" was not like before, only occasionally displaying its power and then disappearing.

The book, adorned with countless arcane symbols, was manipulated by Zhao Xū to unleash the ultimate spell on the last page - "Record of Memories!"

Zhao Xū's entire body was suddenly enveloped in countless silver threads, heading towards Anxunyoja.

Each one seemed to possess consciousness, like threads of silk, slowly and steadily approaching Anxunyoja, as if attempting to infiltrate her mind.

Originally, the "Psychic Barrier" protected by the "Intangible Shield" was suddenly dispelled by Anxunyoja, and her clothes and hair were blown about by an unseen force, accompanied by her inner "Acceptance".
Here is the translation:

An'ei Nuoya, just like shedding all the pretenses of a girl, is about to hug Zhao Xu bare-chested.

"'Summer, if you see the memories he left in my mind, if you see his true form, then please ask him one thing for me."

"What kind of man are you."
