Chapter 664: Real or Fake Anniya

The anti-magic zone has banned all forms of magic, including pseudo-magic and supernatural abilities. It's as if even powerful monsters would be severely restricted, and only the "unique abilities" would remain effective.

For example, in the mythological sequence of the Abyssal Demon, the "Balo Flame Demon" is a high-ranking demon that possesses the unique ability to continue using its abilities, including the "Pyroclastic Flow" and "Wrapping" techniques. However, other magical and supernatural abilities such as the "Executioner's Sword," "Inferno Body," and "True Insight" would be rendered ineffective.

In general, such beings are referred to as "high-level foot soldiers" by Arthur. As for Zhao Xun, his "Nine Swords" technique is a unique ability, so it would not be affected by the anti-magic zone's restrictions. However, since it is a supernatural ability, it cannot be used within the anti-magic zone.

In an instant, the entire battlefield underwent a dramatic change.

As the long gun extended, it directly pierced the deformed man who had lost all magical protection due to the anti-magic zone.

He suddenly revealed an unbelievable expression, with his eyes wide open as if he was in a daze, and stood there stiffly, with his body twitching violently. He then fell into a stiff state.

However, Zhao Xun did not stop for a moment, twisting the gun barrel until his heart was crushed.

After the opponent had completely lost all signs of life, Zhao Xun still showed no hint of joy or celebration.

He silently pulled out the "Legendary Death Spell Staff" that he had not used for a long time.

Before Lark's return, the energy of this staff was like the "Powerful Staff" that had just been broken by the deceased chemist, with a slight decrease in power.
Here is the translation of the text:

So Zhao Xu also cherished the spell of binding the soul, no longer as reckless as before, and even looking disgusted would discard it and decide to seal off the title. However, at this moment, even if the energy cost was tens of thousands of gold coins, he would still decide without hesitation.

Zhao Xu directly lifted his staff, with the gemstone at the tip pointing directly at the corpse in front of him. If someone were to observe closely, they could even see that the gemstone, as black as ink, seemed to have small fish-like movements swimming inside it. These were the souls that Zhao Xu had once imprisoned.

Zhao Xu was currently carrying the "Death Contract" spell on his body, which would automatically reduce his physical strength by 2 points, but also brought him an automatic trigger of the "Complete Revival" spell. Therefore, the opponent's revival methods were uncertain.

Just now, Zhao Xu used the "Anti-Demon Field" to suppress the opponent, cutting off the opponent's instant "Life Binding" spell and stabbed the opponent's chest with a long spear. At this moment, he was still relying on the Anti-Demon Field to continue its effects, suppressing the opponent's possible revival methods.

As long as he did not cancel this Anti-Demon Field, even if the opponent's cultivation reached the heavens, unless divine intervention occurred, the opponent would still die straight away, with no possibility of resurrection.

As Zhao Xu's legendary staff, imbued with mystical energy, was activated, a distorted man's forehead suddenly emitted a withered, pale, and skeletal hand with a clear outline of the bone structure.

It directly slapped onto the opponent's head, and the hand suddenly pulled out a small, fine-looking person from within. The person's soul was in a black-and-white state, with only empty holes for facial features.

The "Soul Binding Claw" breathed in and out, tightly grasping the opponent's soul and returning it to the gemstone at the top of the staff.
Here is the translation of the text:

In the next second, Zhao Xu retrieved the long gun that was fixed to the opponent's corpse and lightly touched his finger to the opponent's finger.

The Five-Ring Technique for mind control.

Zhao Xu's gaze fell on the corpse at that moment, and his focused energy burst forth. The corpse immediately flew towards him.

In reality, the deformed body, which had been killed by the spell, had its original worms on its surface bursting out one after another. Even if it hadn't reached the giant's observation state, it still made people nauseous.

But Zhao Xu didn't show any signs of panic as he watched the corpse, which was getting closer and closer. He continued to take out a spell scroll with a dark and ominous design from his scroll case, and muttered the incantation silently.

Then, the entire scroll was engulfed in an uncontrollable power, as if it were a self-igniting talisman.

Zhao Xu stuck the scroll to the already-arrived corpse.

Six-Ring Technique! Feast of the Hellhound!

The scroll suddenly burst out a diamond as a spell material, which turned into flying dust as soon as it touched the air and scattered over the corpse.

This time, the corpse instantly ignited with a black and pungent flame.

It was as if it had been soaked in gasoline, and the entire corpse disintegrated within two to three seconds, leaving no bones behind.

In the void, a sigh and whisper from the person who recorded the scroll were heard:

"Leave the world now."

Until the shaking black flames and the corpse's last remnants disappeared, leaving no ash or residue behind.

Theoretically, the "Revival of the Dead" technique of the Five-Ring Technique requires a complete corpse body, and even one missing piece cannot be activated.
Here is the translation of the text:

The "Revival Technique" of the Seven Rings requires a small amount of corpse remains, including ashes. Therefore, even if the deceased has undergone the "Separation Technique", which completely incinerates the body, as long as someone with a strong will is present at the scene and can collect the scattered ashes, they can be used as the catalyst for this revival technique.

Only the "Complete Revival Technique" of the Nine Rings can transcend the corpse and revive the deceased solely through the connection of time and space and the remaining soul.

Zhao Xuan's "Feast of the Canine Demons" does not even leave behind ashes.

What's even more terrifying is that this technique can prevent the deceased from returning to the world of the living through any means of revival.

Even if you use "Miraculous Techniques" and "Prayer Techniques" to intervene, there is a 50% chance of failure, and once that happens, the corresponding biological entity will never be able to revive through normal means. It's as if all possibilities have been cut off.

"Not bad."

Just then, Anzhi Noya's gentle and soft voice echoed through time.

At this moment, she was standing in the shadow behind Zhao Xuan.

"Every high-level mage will anticipate the anti-magic field, so many have developed countermeasures, with the most common being intuition transmission and forced disconnection from the three-meter death zone."

"After the opponent approaches you within three meters, you first use the 'elastic ball technique' to reduce the opponent's caution and, because the opponent has just barely entered your 'Soul Pearl' and 'Refusal Guardian', they will not easily leave."

"In this way, when you finally reveal your true intentions and open the anti-magic field at the critical moment, the opponent, having just broken through the elastic ball technique, has lost the opportunity to respond and is directly enveloped by your anti-magic field. So, from the moment you use the Soul Pearl, you have set up this trap."

Anzhi Noya quickly guessed Zhao Xuan's thoughts, saying a few sentences.

At this moment, Zhao Xuan heard the sound of someone approaching from behind and smiled slightly.
Here is the translation:

"In reality, it's like a game of Xiangqi, where every move has countless possibilities. It's just that the opponent has walked into one of the dozens of situations I had anticipated. Meanwhile, as time passes, this idea becomes even more profound."

"Yeah," Anzhiya nodded slightly, "there's some truth to that. It seems you're almost qualified to graduate. Although the opponent is just a six-ring, with the power of the demonic god and the advantage of this domain, they're still extremely dangerous. You can still win and deserve to be praised."

"As for what's to come, you can still handle a corpse with ease, step by step, eliminating the possibility of the opponent's revival. This kind of thinking is what makes me feel relieved."

In reality, other mages can't do what Zhao Xu does.
To suppress revival, you need to use the Anti-Demon Field, but the Anti-Demon Field will also suppress those methods that can revive.
The entire process is a vicious cycle of you going down and me coming up.
It's only because I, Zhao Xu, am not suppressed by the Anti-Demon Field that I can achieve this.

Zhao Xu finally turned around, straightening his gaze at Anzhiya, who was standing behind him.

At this moment, she looked just like she did when she first left, wearing a white-pink woolen coat, with her hands inserted into the sleeve. Even though the coat was loose, it couldn't hide the extraordinary aura she exuded.

"So, Master, did you observe me from the beginning to now?"

"In reality, even earlier," Anzhiya replied with a light smile, her eyes gazing at Zhao Xu with a soft and charming gaze.

"I arrived in this world a few minutes after you did, so don't underestimate your master's abilities."
Here is the translation of the text:

Anshen Niya nasalized, "However, you can understand that only courage can overcome difficulties and directly enter the state of mind of this giant fortress. Otherwise, you would have lost consciousness and been swallowed by the deep sea at the beginning."

"Then, did you hide behind my shadow throughout the entire time, watching everything happen?" Zhao Xu couldn't help but ask.

Anshen Niya nodded slightly, "Of course."

At this moment, she was still standing in Zhao Xu's shadow, relying on the luminescent moss on the ceiling of the cave, which cast a faint green glow.

"That explosion just now?" Zhao Xu asked again.

Just now, the opponent had broken the "Force Wand" and triggered a massive explosion.

Anshen Niya could avoid him with absolute confidence, but he clearly didn't feel any magical resonance, so how could Anshen Niya quietly evade the explosion?

"Idiot, I've been controlling myself to hide in the spiritual realm from the very beginning," Anshen Niya explained. "The damage from the broken Force Wand doesn't cover the spiritual realm at all."

"Uh-huh."

At this moment, Zhao Xu lowered his head silently, looking like he was listening to a lesson.

But the next second, he looked up again, his eyes fixed on Anshen Niya with a hint of coldness.

"So how do you prove that you're my teacher, Anshen Niya?"

Regardless of how logical Anshen Niya's explanation was, it was difficult to suppress the doubts in Zhao Xu's heart.

At this moment, Anshen Niya, who was standing behind and feeling the eerie green glow from above, smiled. "Don't you have a way to prove your doubts?"

"It's with these eyes that can pierce through illusions."

Although Anshen Niya didn't directly point it out, Zhao Xu also understood the meaning behind her words.

True knowledge!
Here is the translation:

If Anzhuo is fake, then the "True Knowledge" that can see through all illusions and suppress the entire illusion system, can break through. This 5th-grade 6th-level 7th-grade magic requires 250 gold coins to purchase mushroom powder, vermilion flower, and oil-based eye ointment to apply to the eye corners as a spellcasting material. After completing this minute-level magic, the caster can grant the recipient the ability to see the true appearance of things.

From that moment on, Zhao Xu can see through ordinary and magical darkness, see hidden doors, and the true positions of objects affected by obscure or teleportation magic. All these changes will be revealed by this magic.

Even Anzhuo, who is hiding in the spiritual realm, can be seen with this magic.

At this moment, Zhao Xu has a "True Vision Gem" in his backpack. It can be activated for 30 minutes a day and can be used at any time, making it a crucial item for adventurers.

The only question is that 75,000 gold coins are too expensive, and few people can afford it.

Zhao Xu directly reached out to take the gem, but suddenly thought better of it.

Magical items can be suppressed.

As it does not belong to Zhao Xu's own part, it is not displayed in the dynamic column. Moreover, Zhao Xu may be influenced by illusion magic and mistakenly believe that the "True Vision Gem" is effective, but in fact, it is just a false vision.

At the beginning, when the fierce winds howled on the sea waves, the "Hidden Eye" with the "Mind Screen" effect on Zhao Xu's forehead suddenly opened, causing him to lose his magical effects.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

So he switched to the voter reward law "Mind Shield" afterwards.

"What's wrong? Has your precious gemstone of truth run out? Let me lend you a 'truth spell' scroll, and you can use it too," he said, as if he had noticed Zhao Xu's concern.

"It's also possible that I cast the 'truth spell', and then you cast the 'thief's law', transferring the spell from my body. As long as I agree, you can transfer the spell," said Anzhi Noya, providing a solution that seemed to understand Zhao Xu's worries.

"Thanks, I have a method for the truth spell," Zhao Xu said with a slight smile.

The opponent's confident expression made Zhao Xu feel suspicious.

But the next moment, he pulled out a scroll from the scroll case, which was actually his original scroll?

At this moment, he should be more cautious.

The voter reward law, five-ring selection - "Truth Spell".

Cast the truth spell!

Zhao Xu did not hesitate at all and completed the voter reward spell.

This was also the reason why Anzhi Noya did not help him choose, allowing him to adapt to unexpected situations himself.

Thanks to this, he was able to continuously use the voter reward spell to cast spells with five, six, and eight rings at critical moments without faltering.

As the soft, magical light fell on Zhao Xu's eyes, the spiritual world, which overlapped with the material plane, slowly appeared before him.

The world's image looked weak and unclear, with colors mixed together, and the boundaries of objects were fuzzy and distorted.

But the most important thing was that Anzhi Noya's shadow was incredibly clear before him, with an absolute beauty and purity of appearance, exactly the same as the true form he had seen in the floating city.

Zhao Xu's inner heart, which had been suspended, was unable to relax.
He couldn't help but complain, "It seems that it's due to the background green light just now, making me look a bit strange to you."
"That's why you don't suspect me, right?"
"Yes."
Zhao Xu smiled.
But the next second, his face turned stiff.
"Who are you, anyway?"
