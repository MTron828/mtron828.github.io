Chapter 427: Physical Immunity

Laxus's latest display also caught Zhao Xu off guard, but he quickly took advantage of the pause in the fire element's attack to rapidly focus his mind and immerse himself in the "Final Scroll".

The scroll, which looked like a treasure trove of gold and was as long as several kilometers, constantly emitted flashes of golden light. It seemed to be a genuine treasure trove of pure gold.

【Adventurer Zhongxia, you have obtained the Final Scroll and will be granted the ability to freely cast nine-ring magic and nine-ring divine magic, but each time you cast a spell, you will consume one of your spell slots.】

Zhao Xu was about to spit out a mouthful of blood, but he quickly suppressed his emotions.

As he had previously experimented with the magic recorded in the Final Scroll in the virtual space, he had a faint sense of nostalgia.

Before he obtained the "Book of Ten Thousand Laws", he had only possessed a limited version of the Final Scroll.

"Time Stop (Nine-Ring)" Zhao Xu exclaimed immediately.

When in doubt, just stop time, and think about how to deal with it later.

At that moment, the two fierce punches thrown by the demon image attacking the fire element's main body suddenly froze in place.

The sky and earth became silent, and all vitality was drained, with no life signs left.

However, Zhao Xu did not stop and continued to cast his spells.

"Energy Shield" - Immune to physical damage.
Here is the translation of the text:

"With the mastery of magic, I, Zhao Xu, have the ability to persistently cast spells without exhaustion——not constrained by the hero's spirit (five rings). With each rotation, I can get a little closer to breaking through to the next level.

Although using the ultimate scroll recording requires consuming one's own magical energy, I, Zhao Xu, can also rely on this spell to recover one magical energy or simulate expertise, bypassing the limitations of divine artifacts.

Next, I, Zhao Xu, will continue to unfold.

'Flowing Curse.'——Each time I cast the spell, it can automatically activate X points of healing (X being the number of magical rings).

'Medical Knowledge.'——When casting spells in the medical system, it will add the effect of canceling the "dizziness" effect.

Combining the two, I, Zhao Xu, will once again unleash a swift explosion, which will trigger a healing spell that will automatically activate medical knowledge, canceling the negative effect of dizziness.

As I finish casting the spell, time comes to a standstill.

'Pffft.'
'Pffft.'
Suddenly, the giant fist of the demon statue crashes down on the Fire Elemental, as if it barely feels any pain, and is subjected to two fierce punches.

At this moment, the Fire Elemental has noticed me, Zhao Xu, and is about to fiercely retaliate. However, it is being forcibly restrained by the two legendary demon statues, preventing it from charging towards me.

As if feeling only the force of the earth, the Fire Elemental suddenly loses all its flames.

In an instant, it transforms into a giant stone man, with crevices in its body filled with various minerals, precious metals, and jewels.

The balance is directly reversed, and the two demon statues are unable to restrain the Earth Elemental, which suddenly knocks them open.

Accompanied by two earth-shaking tremors, even I, Zhao Xu, feel my original location jump slightly."
Here is the translation of the text:

As he watched this scene, he couldn't help but mutter to himself, "How is it possible for a fifty-odd strength gold dragon to be defeated by a forty-odd strength earth elemental? It's not even possible for it to be done by a mere mortal." It's clear that he had obtained the data of the legendary monster, which was far from reality. Even the monster in front of him, which could switch between the five elements at will, could be referred to as the four elements' master. However, Zhao Xu's mind began to brighten up. He wasn't anxious at all, waiting for the elemental master to rush towards him, accompanied by a sudden and intense gust of wind.

The elemental master's eyes, like multi-faceted jewels, were filled with cruelty and coldness, and its hot blood was still hard to quench. The massive body, weighing over two hundred tons, loomed over Zhao Xu like an endless black shadow. One punch landed!

It was as if a meteorite had fallen, accompanied by a burst of intense heat and a scorching gust. Meanwhile, Zhao Xu simply lifted his hand and pointed at the elemental master. "Supernatural Palm Control - Dual Attribute, High-Efficiency, Strong-Efficiency (Potential Point Simulation)!" The touch of the Frosty Touch!

The original earth elemental master had 8 agility, so even if the data was inaccurate, it would still increase by dozens of points. Even with the attributes, it couldn't resist Zhao Xu's attributes, which ignored the opponent's dozens of points of evasion and dozens of points of magical resistance.

The combined damage from the three attributes was 41 points, which was far beyond what even the most agile monsters could withstand. With the Frosty Touch spell, Zhao Xu was equivalent to a one-hit kill, as long as the opponent couldn't resist attribute damage and could be hit by him, they would be waiting for their downfall.
At this moment, Zhao Xu had his own demonic fist technique, and his gentle punch pierced through the earth element's main body's defense, which was as solid as a mountain, without any effect. Zhao Xu was eagerly expecting the earth element to fall.

However, the earth element didn't even pause. Zhao Xu felt a massive stone arm's powerful punch coming straight at him.

In this critical moment, Zhao Xu couldn't possibly take the time to chant any spells. Even the fastest spells couldn't compare to the speed of this punch. If he was really hit, he would probably die on the spot.

Zhao Xu gritted his teeth and unleashed a tight "instinctual magic" that could be cast instantly.

"Higher Speed Release (Eight Circles)!"

【Adventurer Zhongxia, you cast the spell "Speed Release" and your "Diversion Healing" spell takes effect, restoring 4 life points. Your "Medical Knowledge" is activated due to "Diversion Healing" and removes the "Dizziness" effect.】

Along with the removal of all negative effects, Zhao Xu gained an extremely rare 6-second window of time.

"Ultimate Time Stop" - "Time Stop" spell effectiveness increased to 30 seconds (1D4+1 round).

However, while time was stopped, Zhao Xu could only cast positive effect spells on himself and couldn't directly harm the enemy. However, facing this extremely precious half-minute, Zhao Xu silently gazed at the earth element in front of him, with the punch just inches from his chest.

As long as he didn't cancel the effect, Zhao Xu would only be left with the possibility of being knocked away, and then it would depend on his luck, whether the Star Cloak could weaken this half-damage.

"Master, isn't this troublesome?"
Here is the translation of the text:

At this moment, Lux, transformed into the ultimate scroll, also entered Zhao Xu's consciousness. Just as she had just controlled the golem, she naturally had no time to spare. Now it's different, it's a time for a well-deserved rest.

"These elemental beings have somehow developed immunity to attribute damage," Zhao Xu didn't need to think twice, naturally understanding the reason why his 40-point attribute damage skill, "Frosty Touch", failed to take effect.

"That's right, master, this is the terrifying aspect of these legendary creatures. They often possess many unbelievable immune abilities, special attack abilities, and supernatural abilities."

"Really, it's like killing someone without being punished," Zhao Xu sighed, regretting his decision to choose close-range combat to cast Frosty Touch, only to be caught off guard and counterattacked.

"Well, let's just say we've learned our lesson and won't make the same mistake again," Zhao Xu had to admit.

"The persistent control spell of the ancient relic - the treasure of the relic seeker (four rings)".

As the spell's light enveloped his entire body, Zhao Xu's reflexive evasion ability, derived from the blessing of luck, was enhanced.

What's more, he gained the ability to dodge attacks.

The Starry Cloak could dodge attacks with a success rate of 15 levels of difficulty, allowing him to absorb half the damage.

The reflexive evasion ability, a profession skill, could absorb half the damage and, through additional effects, absorb all the damage.

At this moment, Zhao Xu's reflexive evasion ability had a total of 7 levels of bonus, including 2 levels of profession, 1 level of speed, 2 levels of agility, and 2 levels of luck (tome of magic).

He still had a distance of 8 levels to reach physical immunity.

Even if he lost the ultimate scroll, he was only one level away from casting the "Treasure of the Relic Seeker" spell. The door to physical immunity was just one layer away from Zhao Xu.
