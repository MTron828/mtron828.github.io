Chapter 247: Unable to Revive

When Zhao Xu returned to the vicinity of "Star Lake", the words of Anselm von Noja still echoed in his mind.

At this moment, he was completely shaken by the "Divine Fragment".

Arthur's long-form epic poem, "The Path to Divinity", tells the story of a legendary wanderer who, after the apocalypse, successfully obtained a fragment of the God of Death and became the "God of Slaughter" through a series of events.

In the early stages of "The Path to Divinity", the God of Slaughter was a tragic figure who was originally a sailor. He was falsely accused of treason by his colleagues due to jealousy and was imprisoned.

The prosecutor, who had been hiding the truth to cover up his family's mistakes, ultimately led to his imprisonment.

His fianc√©e also left him and married his enemy, and his father died of illness and poverty.

Later, the God of Slaughter became a wanderer under the guidance of the God of Death, Pastor Nal, who was also imprisoned.

He then disguised himself as the corpse of the deceased pastor and escaped to sea after being thrown overboard.

Subsequently, the wanderer, guided by the God of Death, eventually found the Divine Fragment and became the God of Slaughter.

The story of his revenge ultimately ended with the destruction of Arthur's royal dynasty, which had been passed down for thousands of years.

The latter half of the book records the story of the God of Slaughter, who was unable to control the vast divine power and was eventually eliminated by other divine powers.

Moreover, due to the content of the first half of the book, readers have come to sympathize with the protagonist, the wanderer.
So, the plot of the gods surrounding and killing each other, which could give rise to evil feelings, was deleted from the official publication by the Church. Few new readers, who do not know about the killing gods, think it's just a fictional story. Anshinoja told Zhao Xu that there is a path similar to the killing gods that can lead to divinity, a path that has been verified by predecessors. This path is like the magical goddess's divine power, which is placed in front of him, and he becomes a legendary mage, but his brain cannot bear it and he will die. This is mentioned in the book "Gods and Demigods" in the legend library.

Originally, Zhao Xu planned to quickly evolve his giant scythe and find the "teleportation gate" as soon as possible. However, it seems that everything needs to be changed now. He needs to use the five days to improve his abilities from all angles. In fact, anything related to gods and spirits will not be simple. Zhao Xu is in a state of harmonization with "Altoria", so he didn't elaborate on the eternal artifact and the seven prophecies when he met Anshinoja.

Thanks to the guidance of "prophecy art", Zhao Xu tried to use the "Divine Art" with the five rings. At this moment, with his 30-level spellcaster level, he can ask 30 questions. However, after Zhao Xu finished casting the spell, he found that the magical light did not connect to the heavenly channel. The light circled around him a few times and then directly pointed to his forehead. "Hmm? Are you looking for me?" The voice of the originally asleep Altoria came.
Here is the translation of the text:

Over the past two days, Zhao Xu has been using Artesia's 20th-level priest abilities for the first time and has felt the power of a max-level character. Suddenly, he heard the other person's voice and felt a bit strange.

"What did you just use? 'Divine Connection'? Are you asking me about the target?" Zhao Xu asked in surprise.

"Yes, this spell can connect with gods or their proxies. You wouldn't think it's possible for a goddess to answer personally, would you? Of course, the answer was finally passed on to me, combined with you," Artesia replied.

"That's not what I mean," Zhao Xu said unhappily.

"That 'Divine Connection' is really tricky," Artesia said.

"Then ask away, although I'm not all-knowing and all-powerful, but I should be able to answer your questions," Artesia said.

After hearing this, Zhao Xu immediately reviewed the entire Starfall Lake campaign, asking Artesia question by question.

At the same time, he also asked some behind-the-scenes information about the "Corrupt Beast Pit".

Since the matter involved the God of Death, it was definitely not something to be hidden. This also made him curious as to why the gods didn't intervene in the half-plane to take away the fragment of divine power.

As a high-ranking angel with such strength, Artesia existed on the battlefield as a top-level commander. Although the battlefield was not consistent, she had once been a mortal and knew the true nature of war, and directly broke down the key points of a normal campaign to explain to Zhao Xu.

Zhao Xu slowly began to feel a different kind of understanding.

He also started to feel the difference between being an outsider and an insider.

In other games, players have indeed organized thousands of guild wars. However, for them, it was just a simulation.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

It doesn't seem like this moment, where the opponent is a force that has accumulated over decades, with a background that spans billions of years of Arthurian history.

Many operations have ceased to be simple board games, and the opponent's strategy is no longer just about surrounding the area. Moreover, the players of Arthur are not equipped with real-time communication methods, and can only temporarily inject a simple flag language into the players.

However, they are facing a private army of miners who have been honed over time. In the past, even after exhausting the life force of their personal bodyguards, they would only intervene when the hired mercenaries were insufficient. It wasn't until then that the player's winning streak reversed.

After answering twenty questions about the "Star Lake Battle", Zhao Xue realized that the duration of the spell had long since passed.

"Hey, do I need to cast the spell again?" Zhao Xue asked.

"No need, the spell's power is only providing a communication channel, and I'm already aware of what's going on in your mind, so I don't need to do that," Aratorlia replied simply.

Zhao Xue nodded, following the requirements of the spell itself, and the opponent's answer was as simple as "yes" or "no".

Otherwise, the power of this "Divine Communication" would not be able to withstand even a 9th-level opponent.

At this point, Zhao Xue was equivalent to having a personal relationship, so he also gained more answers.

Aratorlia only began to elaborate on her own question.

"That's why the gods didn't intervene in the half-plane?" Zhao Xue finally asked the question he had been wanting to ask.

At that time, Anniya had already become drowsy and was planning to go to the bedroom to change clothes and sleep. It was not convenient for him to continue asking questions.

"Yes, let's go back to another question," Aratorlia said. "Do you know the 'Killer God' of the past?"
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xun nodded slightly as he listened, having read the biography of the legendary hero.

"Why do you think that during periods of great calamity, at least half of the gods fell? But the one who fell most smoothly, without any disturbances, was the god of slaughter?" he asked.

As it turned out, Zhao Xun had read a significant amount of related content for that half of the face.

He had also formed his own opinions on various pre-existing mysteries.

He was no longer passively receiving notions.

"Because this is determined by the divine nature of the god of death," Zhao Xun said.

"After the other gods fell, their divine natures would each have distinct residual characteristics, even if they took a long time to digest."

"However, the god of death, due to the special nature of death, would have some residual characteristics that would completely disappear."

Zhao Xun finally expressed his guess in one word and one sentence.

"Ah, Master, your current understanding of this aspect is indeed beyond my expectations. You have your own precise judgments about divinity," Aratoria praised Zhao Xun suddenly.

"That's what I'm going to tell you next. Are you ready?" Aratoria said suddenly, her expression serious.

At this time, Zhao Xun looked around, and the hillside was very quiet, with only insect sounds.

There were no people nearby.

However, Zhao Xun's magic did not go unused.

He used the "Miracle Art" to simulate the "Lords' Mansion" technique of the seven-ring arcane.

Instantly, a faintly glowing door appeared in front of him, roughly the same size as his single-bed dormitory.

Behind the door, however, was an empty void, still surrounded by the thicket of trees on the hillside.

Zhao Xun directly entered this gateway leading to an alternate dimension.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

After the entrance with the glowing door suddenly disappeared, and the hall expanded. The luxurious hall was filled with neatly arranged furniture, and it was connected to dozens of spacious rooms. As a 30th-level mage, Zhao Xu could create a space of approximately 2500 cubic meters.

However, Zhao Xu was not interested in the giant dining table that could accommodate 360 people, nor was he impressed by the 60 neatly dressed but almost transparent servants standing nearby.

In reality, Zhao Xu had only wanted to establish a simple, hidden space.

However, it was because of these "residential" magic that the mage's life became more convenient, and he no longer had to wander the wind and sleep under the stars.

"That's enough," Zhao Xu said to Altoira, who was tuned in.

"Yes, listen carefully," Altoira said with a serious tone, but not in a deliberate attempt to tantalize.

"The God of Death is the only deity that will not be resurrected."
