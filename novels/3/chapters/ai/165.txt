Chapter 166: The Blooms

After listening to the old wizard in front of him, who was the embodiment of the legendary library's spirit, Zhao Xuyu thought for a moment before reading someone else's collection, adhering to the agreement and not revealing anything. He had sworn to defend magic until his death.

Before figuring out the meaning of these vows, he didn't dare to stir up trouble again.

"Can't I just abandon my oath?" Zhao Xuyu tried to ask, but there was no hope in his heart.

The spirit, however, shook its head. "No way."

At this moment, Zhao Xuyu noticed that the old wizard in front of him seemed to have become more robust, with a powerful and energetic aura.

He looked directly at the other party, "In my impression, the goddess usually prefers to take on a female form when dealing with messengers or sacred artifacts. This is also due to her own reflection. How is it that your current form is so old?"

Initially, Zhao Xuyu thought the other party was the library, so the old wizard's appearance didn't quite fit. However, he recalled that the goddess had chosen more than four out of five female pontiffs, and the second-generation magic goddess had chosen only female pontiffs.

Considering that the legendary library was established under the second-generation magic goddess's hand, the spirit in front of him being an old man was suspicious.

"You wizards are too suspicious," he said.

Suddenly, the spirit of the legendary library began to transform, changing from a wizard's robe to a puffed-up skirt, and the old wizard's appearance transformed into a young girl, with rosy cheeks.

Seeing the spirit's new form, Zhao Xuyu's head began to ache, and he regretted his hasty words.

"Shall I turn back?" suggested Zhao Xu.

"Turn into a big-headed ghost, do you think it's easy for me to transform into a being like this once?" replied the spirit girl, her face full of disdain as she sat on the ground.

Zhao Xu understood that transforming back into a child would be difficult, and the difficulty would vary.

"That's self-introduction, Summer, a 3rd-level mage," Zhao Xu said.

"I am the Saint Fallen Angel, Black Cat," replied the girl slowly.

"I think you're not a divine artifact, and the Spell of Disintegration can undo your kind of spirit," Zhao Xu said, looking at the girl who was not telling the truth.

As Zhao Xu turned back around, he looked like he was planning to find a record of the ritual to undo the spell.

"Rudae," said the girl, her eyes flashing with caution, as if warning Zhao Xu.

"Oh, Rudae," nodded Zhao Xu.

Although the naming style was not like the mainstream of the current Misteria, it was impossible to say what it was like during the second generation of the Magic Goddess period.

"Why did you disguise yourself as an old man?" Zhao Xu asked.

"Hmph, it's not you guys, a bunch of low-level mages. You can't find the entrance, so you're always bothering me, asking me to explain. You're just taking advantage of my childlike appearance. You don't even think about how to address me with respect," Rudae said, her tone full of resentment.

Zhao Xu was surprised that he had heard the name of the elder, Os, twice in two days, and it was always used as a term to flatter himself.
Here is the translation:

Zhao Xu looked at the Library Spirit Luo Duo and asked, "How do you evaluate that method I just used?"

"Oh, yes, this one. Finding the legendary library's target method, there are at least ten ways to do it, and the remaining three are hidden in the lower floors. Then, according to your search method, you can corresponds to different entry frequencies and oath levels."

After saying that, Luo Duo lifted her head, and her eyes sparkled as she looked at Zhao Xu: "Although your method is not the most effective, and it takes time, it's still possible to get in. And I'll keep my oath to let you in."

"What about higher-level ones?" Zhao Xu asked.

"Of course, for example, the most intelligent person can bite my head off and say I'm the entrance to the legendary library, and they can get one-time entry and don't need to keep their oath," Luo Duo said proudly.

Zhao Xu's eyes widened in surprise, thinking that if he had seen a young girl version of Luo Duo at the beginning, he wouldn't have dared to make such a wild guess.

But he saw an old wizard, and who knows if he's a real wizard or not. He wouldn't dare to make a fool of himself.

"So, let's negotiate?" Zhao Xu suddenly knelt down and looked at Luo Duo straight on.

He sensed that the Library Spirit Luo Duo in front of him wasn't the kind of old scholar who stuck to the rules.

Since there was a way to exist without keeping an oath, it proved that this was not a hard condition.

"Negotiate?" Luo Duo looked down her nose at Zhao Xu, "Zhongshu Wizard, please pay attention. Am I the kind of spirit that doesn't follow the rules?"

Zhao Xu directly pulled out a "automatic recording feather pen" he had received from a mysterious old man because he had finished copying a scroll the fastest.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu added the automatic note-taking feather pen given to him by An Ni Nuoya to the one he already had, making it two. However, after he leveled up to level 3, his level was still unstable, so he basically didn't dare to copy scrolls, fearing that he would "drop a level" afterwards.

As a result, the two automatic note-taking feather pens were somewhat cumbersome for Zhao Xu, and he simply took out one to try to bribe the spirit of the library in front of him.

Who knew that the spirit, Lu Dou, saw the "automatic note-taking feather pen" Zhao Xu handed over and didn't have a hint of joy on her face, but instead said, "Are you thinking that after I transform into a little girl, my intelligence will be the same as a child's?"

After saying that, Lu Dou waved her hand in the air, and suddenly hundreds of "automatic note-taking feather pens" floated in the air.

"As a library spirit, it's impossible for me to copy books or do it myself. Xiǎo Huò, I'm telling you, this kind of foolish attitude won't work in the Floating City."

She then began to reveal the "Floating City's Thick Black Theory" lessons she had summarized over the years and said that she had already taught these lessons to several target individuals, with good effects. She even hinted at selling them to Zhao Xu at a low price.

Zhao Xu's teeth ached as he didn't expect that his first gift in the Floating City would be met with cold ridicule.

Just then, this spirit, Lu Dou, pulled out a "Secret Silver Flash" chip, which only earned her a bigger mocking response from the spirit.

"What do you think I should give you as a gift, Ms. Lu Dou?" Zhao Xu pretended to ask humbly.

Lu Dou directly stood up with her hands clasped behind her back, looking like an adult, and shook her head, "Well, I think that cloak of yours is quite nice."
As she spoke, her residual light couldn't help but glance at the "Stellar Cloak" on Zhao Xu's body.

When Zhao Xu heard this, he couldn't help but laugh out loud and said, "You're quite beautiful in your imagination."

"Well, that's that," Luo Duo said with a shrug.

"What's the specific promise like?" Zhao Xu asked.

Since he couldn't break through directly, he had to try to break through from the side.

"Oh, I'll show you," Luo Duo suddenly smiled with joy and snapped her fingers.

A stack of several dozen pages of sheepskin paper suddenly appeared in the air and slowly floated down into Zhao Xu's palm.

Zhao Xu took it and began to flip through the entire document, feeling a bit dazed after a few pages.

This was a complete contract in the format of the Earth's contract. It listed various ways to fulfill the promise and conditions for not leaking the contents of the legendary book.

The contract also prescribed various punishments for violating the promise and a few limited and severe exceptions.

Zhao Xu couldn't help but look at the container spirit Luo Duo in front of him, wondering if she had been studying this contract for a few hundred years.

"What about those who haven't taken the promise?" Zhao Xu, who had originally thought it was just a simple promise, couldn't help but be curious - who had such luck.

It had to be said that signing this promise was absolutely a burden.

"No one," Luo Duo replied with a happy smile.

"Not no one? Isn't it just pointing directly to the entrance of the legendary book?" Zhao Xu was astonished.

"Yes, but I assume it's because I acknowledge it. If I don't acknowledge it, I won't be correct," Luo Duo looked at Zhao Xu with a hint of condescension towards low-intelligence individuals.
Here is the translation:

As Zhao Xu thought about it, he realized that the spirit of the artifact was the one calling the shots, whether it was horizontal or vertical.

However, considering that the legend library was involved, Zhao Xu thought that the secrets it held were extraordinary, which was why there were such strict vows.

At this point, Zhao Xu also thought about the books he had seen on the bookshelf, such as "Theory of Divine Attributes". If these books that dealt with divine matters were leaked, it would undoubtedly cause a huge commotion.

Since the people who had come before him had all signed this contract honestly, Zhao Xu didn't think twice and took out a goose quill from his backpack, preparing to write his name on the parchment.

The spirit of the artifact, Luo Duo, watched with a smile as Zhao Xu dipped the quill in ink. Then, she began the process of signing her name, secretly delighted that her collection had gained another item.

However, just as Zhao Xu's quill was about to touch the ancient parchment, Luo Duo's expression suddenly changed.

"Hold on," she hurriedly shouted, stopping Zhao Xu's action.

Zhao Xu looked at Luo Duo in confusion. He had just read the entire contract, although it was restrictive, but it didn't seem to be an unfair contract.

Was she going to back out?
Add more terms?
"Yes, I suddenly feel that you're quite nice, so the vow is unnecessary," Luo Duo said, then jumped up and took the parchment from Zhao Xu's hand, putting it away directly.

"You can connect to the legend library once a day from now on. Just shout 'Luo Duo is the most beautiful' and it's okay," Luo Duo said hurriedly.

"Luo Duo is the most beautiful?" Zhao Xu reconfirmed, finding this password somewhat self-absorbed.

Immediately, his entire body began to fade away, slowly disappearing into starlight.
Here is the translation:

As Lü Dù looked on, Zhao Xù entered the tenth layer, which was also known as the "legendary library". She finally let out a sigh and knelt down.

Slowly, her entire body began to change, transforming from a child's physique to that of a mature woman. Her loose, puffed-sleeve dress also underwent a transformation.

"I almost couldn't maintain the transformation, and it was only because I was thinking about the child's appearance that I managed to deceive people," she said to herself, her gaze puzzled as she looked towards the direction where Zhao Xù had disappeared.

"Why, in the instant before you signed your name, did I feel a sense of impending doom?" she murmured to herself.
