Chapter 232: The Sale of Eight Hundred Million Gold Coins

The Mining Association has been operating the "Stellar Lake" for many years, and although there have been conflicts, they are not as strong as some of the other forces that are still trying to surpass them.

One of the key reasons for this is that the Mining Association has mastered at least six ghost souls.

After the war, the Mining Association directly promised to release all of these ghost souls.

For high-level players, these ghost souls are not particularly formidable, as even a 4th-level player like Zhao Xu has some means to counter them. However, for low-level players without magical weapons, they are a deadly threat.

This is also the reason for the heavy casualties in the "Stellar Lake War".

This time, Zhao Xu saw a ghost soul lurking in the distance, trying to observe and get closer to them. However, this is also reasonable, or else every time he goes out at night, he would be mysteriously attacked and would have to give the goddess a donation to turn his luck around.

Seeing this, Zhao Xu just smiled lightly and said, "Have you heard of the 'Spirit Realm'?"

The entire team, including Cui Lu, was taken aback by Zhao Xu's sudden outburst after being silent for a long time.

Or, after knowing the gap between Zhao Xu and themselves, Zhao Xu's image became even more majestic, no longer seen as an ordinary 1st-level priest.

"It's that 'Spirit Realm' that exists but cannot be directly faced," said Zhao Xu.

"No mistake," said the mage, Mu Tong, in response.
Thinking of these classmates in the future, basically all of them are the backbone of the guild, so Zhao Xu quickly needs to popularize some common sense for them. Otherwise, there might be some embarrassing jokes after the battle with the spirits.

"If we go to the 'spirit world', we will find that it is a misty and otherworldly dimension, coexisting with the main material plane," Zhao Xu introduced the wonderful spirit world, "Do you guys know the characteristics of the spirit world?"

"The spirit world can see the main material plane, but the reverse is not true, so ordinary people have no idea about the existence of the spirit world." This time it was not Mu Tong who answered, but the wanderer Frey standing in the corner, as if she had had contact with it before.

"Wow, that's too domineering," Zhang Qi exclaimed.

On the side, Du Nan also agreed, "So in the spirit world, can I spy on the main material plane?"

Zhao Xu grinned and added, "First, the images it sees of the main material plane are blurry. Second, it cannot hear any sound. But in any case, this plane is quite good for reconnaissance, probing, and secret operations."

"Are there residents there?" Cui Lu, who was walking in the center of the group with her longbow ready, suddenly asked.

But Zhao Xu didn't continue at this time, since Cui Lu asked, he might as well answer.

"Spirits," Zhao Xu said simply.

Upon hearing this, the faces of everyone present couldn't help but pale a bit.

Now it's not like when Zhao Xu first went out on adventures, when there weren't too many graduates. At this point, those who haven't gone to the wild to see the scenery might not even dare to say that they are the same as the locals.

There are no fewer than twenty examples on the forum of encounters with spirits, most of which end in total annihilation.

This tells everyone how big the gap is between level 1 players and spirits.
Here is the translation of the text:

As soon as everyone heard this, they couldn't help but change color, and this was indeed the case.

The pastor, Feng Ge, also seemed to understand the inner workings of this matter, having invested some knowledge. "That's correct," Zhao Xu said calmly, agreeing with this statement. "But she's almost here."

Zhao Xu's straightforward tone had shattered everyone's inner world.

The ghost was about to arrive!

As for Fuli, who was fearless on land and sea, the hand that had been placed on the hilt of the sword had slightly relaxed.

Their "stealth ability" that allowed them to survive as a "living dead" was useless against creatures without physical bodies.

Zhao Xu noticed that everyone was already showing signs of wanting to escape, so he hurriedly reassured them, "Don't panic, it's coming for me."

At this point, everyone's hearts were slightly calmed, and they were all looking at Zhao Xu with curiosity.

In reality, Zhao Xu wasn't even speaking, and the ghost would soon appear, reacting first by attacking Zhao Xu.

The ghost's true intelligence was not inferior to that of ordinary humans.

"So I need everyone to wait for a little while and protect me. As long as I don't die, you can't escape. If I die, then it's up to you," Zhao Xu said with a bewitching tone.

If everyone agreed to stay, they could alleviate his burden from one side and, on the other hand, he could also get some help. Moreover, he had the intention of training new people.

In the world, where were there so many battlefields to run to?

"This pastor, sir, is it your intention to assign a task for us to protect you?" Zhang Qi turned to Cui Lu after a nod and then walked over.

Zhao Xu smiled and said, "Yes."
Here is the translation of the text:

He could only use this condition to give everyone a sense of hope. Avoiding the appearance of the ghost, everyone scattered and fled. But he didn't notice that he hadn't killed the ghost successfully. The ghost would then take advantage of the situation and escape, and with its vengeful nature, it would definitely sneak up and kill a few people who had just escaped.

"That wind gentleman, if we can succeed in protecting you during the ghost's attack, is that okay?" Zhang Qi asked the condition, and eventually, his face turned red as he asked.

"No mistake." He deliberately took out the Unextinguishable Torch and was prepared for the scene.

"If you accept this task, you will each stake a torch in the soil in my presence," Zhao Xu said, and everyone in the scene looked puzzled.

However, considering that these words were spoken by the pastor in front of them, there was no possibility that they would believe in the ordinary torch of a copper coin.

So, starting from Cui Lu, almost everyone staked a torch in the soil.

Zhao Xu maintained a slight smile throughout.

He had deliberately taken out the Unextinguishable Torch, not just to show off.

He needed to let everyone know the value of this thing, and it could be sold. Only then could his plan be completed.

At this moment, Zhao Xu raised his hand slightly, and the Unextinguishable Torch, which was randomly displayed by the Heavenly God's law, was released in his hand.

When powerful beings use supernatural abilities and magical law, they won't be silly enough to hold a bag of powdered magical materials.
Here is the translation:

So, when Zhao Xu unleashed this ability to convert a ordinary torch that can only burn one copper coin into a "non-extinguishable torch" that can burn 110 gold coins, the cost was that he could freely use the two-ring spell "non-extinguishable flames" without restriction.

As a result, Zhao Xu's dozens of classmates, who were still looking puzzled, couldn't help but wonder what he was trying to do.

Then, they saw the first torch ignite, not burning their hands or transmitting heat, but radiating a 12-meter range of non-extinguishable flames.

This priest was casting a spell!

The torch was being converted as a reward for them!

Zhang Qi's heart was racing with excitement, but they couldn't help but think that this torch was equivalent to 110 gold coins and could be sold for a slight discount.

Is it worth swapping a revival stone for 110 gold coins?

Most players would only say one word - worth it.

Because many people have fought monsters to death without earning enough gold coins.

However, everyone was still puzzled - why did this non-extinguishable torch get distributed among them?

It seemed that Zhao Xu was not done yet. Slowly, the second torch, the third torch, and so on, all lit up in front of everyone.

"See you later," Du Nan muttered to himself, unable to help himself.

Then, he tightly grasped someone's arm, not wanting them to make a sound, fearing it would disrupt the show.

After finishing this, Zhao Xu stretched his lazy arms and said to everyone, "Alright, when I'm dead or we're alive, you can come here and take your own torch."

To be honest, this was the first time Zhao Xu had tried out this ability to disrupt the balance and make a fortune.

As long as he wanted, he could create a non-extinguishable torch that burns 110 gold coins every 6 seconds.

An hour later, he would have 66,000 gold coins.
Here is the translation of the text:

For five days and nights, Zhao Xu worked tirelessly, and he was able to produce nearly 8 million gold coins' worth of fire. From then on, he could have sold the entire continent of Artheria.

However, Zhao Xu did not do so. He knew that there must be some limit here, so he needed to test it out slowly.

It's like Anniya, who has the free "wish" technique, which allows her to exchange 25,000 gold coins for two turns. She can manufacture 8 million gold coins in an hour.

Abusing the technique to drill holes without limits will be balanced by the world's intention, which Zhao Xu is clear about.

However, in front of him, he slightly used this technique to assign tasks and reward his classmates who had helped him in his past life, without affecting anything.

Just now, he had used the free "eternal flame" technique over ten times. This was his first attempt.

Since this step was successful, the next step Zhao Xu's attempt will be even more extravagant.

"Ahh---" Suddenly, his girlfriend Feng Ge let out a loud scream, startled and pointing at the back of Zhao Xu.

Zhao Xu turned around slightly, looking at the ghost that had just appeared in front of him, with a relaxed expression just after completing the eternal flame.

"Long time no see," Zhao Xu said.

The ghost's face suddenly changed color.
