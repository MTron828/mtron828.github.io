Chapter 082: The Underground City's Beginning

The journey that followed was uneventful, with no unusual creatures manifesting on Zhao Xuan's body. This was also the reason Zhao Xuan chose to join this smuggling team, as regular trade teams might attract the attention of bandits. As for Luo Ya, the underground force that could engage in smuggling, it was not intimidating enough to deter potential threats. "Mr. Zhongxiao, is that a scroll of magic?" the poet finally couldn't help but ask Zhao Xuan a few days later.

Since Zhao Xuan first pulled out the scroll on the first day, he had been quietly counting them, and today he had pulled out over ten scrolls.

According to the scroll's price, Zhao Xuan's net worth would be several hundred gold coins, making him a wealthy player in the game.

However, the poet still underestimated Zhao Xuan by two zeros.

The poet, who was an expert in the art of magic, noticed that Zhao Xuan didn't behave like an ordinary mage, who would meticulously record the spells on the scroll. Furthermore, ordinary mages would spend a long time reading and understanding a spell before attempting to cast it, being cautious and only attempting one or two spells a day. Who could compare to Zhao Xuan, who could cast four or five spells a day?

"Yes," Zhao Xuan said, just as he had finished casting the first-level spell "Shadow Technique" using his intuition and recording it in his mind.

Before An Niya and he parted ways, she had given him a first-level spell scroll, which he had copied while traveling, so that he could practice his magic on the road.

Mages can copy spells from others' spellbooks or from scrolls.
Here is the translation of the text:

The art of copying magical books can affect the structure of others' magic, and it's possible that the magic in the copied book may disappear. This is also the reason why novice mages are cautious when borrowing magical books. The Mage Association won't provide a free replacement even if the magic in the borrowed book disappears. Once you graduate and leave the association, you'll have to pay the fee for copying and borrowing. Copying a scroll will inevitably render it blank, as if it has been used.

Zhao Xuan is too afraid to relax, and he must copy the magic down immediately. If he doesn't, he'll have to suffer the consequences when he needs to use the magic in the future. "Brother Zhongshu, are you copying magic? Where's your magical book?" the priest said with a mixture of surprise and curiosity.

Zhao Xuan replied, "I haven't mastered the skill of copying scrolls. I only memorized it in my mind. Moreover, I acquired my magic through prayer."

The surrounding people fell silent, and since the incident with the ghost, everyone has been searching for information about the profession of mentor on the forum. A mentor can research magic through prayer and is the only profession that can be praised for its ability to cast magic. The abilities of priests, mages, and other professions are like blank paper. Even a few mentor players on the forum can only acquire a few magic spells through prayer, which is quite pitiful.

"Ah, Mr. Zhongxia, you've inherited a considerable amount of your mentor's 'legacy,' haven't you?" Rainbow the Wanderer licked her lips and said with a sly smile, her eyes flashing with a golden light. "Are you considering selling some of your magical scrolls?"

"Not legacy," Zhao Xu corrected softly, not daring to curse Ansitanya.

At that moment, he was referring to Ansitanya's last goodbye, and the other players understood that it wasn't something to be taken lightly.

"Ah, Miss Priest, aren't you a high school student? Don't you need to attend school?" Zhao Xu, who didn't want to be questioned about his guild secrets, began to counterattack, asking the Priestess who was most likely to reveal a weakness.

"Ah, yeah?" Priestess Yuyue smiled lazily, "I'm sick now, so I'm taking a break at home. But it's too boring at home, so I came online to play games. By the way, I'm sneaking in some studying to avoid falling behind, and it's really frustrating to learn about these religious concepts in the game."

"Yuyue is injured," Warrior Maple Leaf whispered. "We're all her real-life friends and relatives, so we're adventuring together."

Zhao Xu was taken aback when he heard this. He noticed that only Yuyue's expression remained natural, while Rainbow the Wanderer and Poet Frog had lowered their heads.

He suddenly realized that the injury was not a simple sprain or fall, but rather a paralysis.

Zhao Xu asked himself if he was the kind of person who would rush into saving the world with one heart and soul, and he knew he couldn't be that kind of person. However, when tragedy appeared before him, he couldn't help but sympathize and extend a helping hand.

This was his style as a person - he couldn't care too much about the tragedies of the world, but if something appeared in his line of sight, even if it was just an online fundraising appeal, he would still contribute a little.
Here is the translation of the text:

"It's nothing, the things in the world, it's not worth talking about. Maybe in a year, your leg will be fine."

Zhao Xu said to Youyue, looking at her with a smile.

However, only he knew that his words were true, not just a consolation.

A year later, the players truly entered the Arthurian world, basically reshaping their bodies according to their attribute values.

This was also the reason why Zhao Xu was reluctant to show off his 8-point charm, as his real life was already tough enough, and going to the Arthurian world would mean a physical appearance of only two levels below average, which was too miserable.

"Ah, Brother Zhongshu, my leg is twisted and all, I'll rest for a week, okay?" Youyue laughed.

Zhao Xu finally snapped out of his daze and saw that the poet and rogue, who were originally quite decent, were all holding back their laughter.

They were all playing with him.

"You guys should be careful not to fall into the chaotic camp," Zhao Xu warned, his face stern.

"We were never a balanced alignment camp," the poet and rogue spoke in unison.

Zhao Xu looked at Youyue with a scowl, "And what about you, Goddess? You're supposed to be neutral and good."

"Ha ha, I'm definitely good, and falling one level won't affect me," Youyue smiled slyly.

Zhao Xu suddenly understood, realizing that the goddess in front of him was indeed aware of his intention to tease him and was cooperating, which was why she could form a team with him.

"That was just a joke," Maple Leaf laughed loudly.

The carriage was filled with the joyful laughter of the group.

"Then you just need to review the concepts in the game for a week, no need to do homework?" Zhao Xu asked immediately.

Youyue, on the other hand, looked confident and self-assured, "I've already been admitted, I just reviewed the material for a few days to prepare for the monthly exam, and I don't want my grades to be too bad."

Zhao Xu could only nod silently, acknowledging that the winner's mode was indeed not something he needed to worry about too much.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

Suddenly, the horse-drawn carriage slowed down. After going through a few days of training with Zhao Xu, the four of them immediately grasped their respective weapons, including Zhao Xu, who was ready to cast a spell at any moment. If something was amiss, they could just throw it out.

"Ah, brave adventurers, I'd like to ask for your opinions on a task," a voice came from outside the carriage.

Meanwhile, Warrior Maple Leaf turned around to look at Zhao Xu, wondering what he thought.

Zhao Xu nodded slightly.

In this desolate wilderness, there was something to ask about, and it was unlikely that there was a secret underground city nearby.
