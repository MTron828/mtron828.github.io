Chapter 578: Prescribing the Right Medicine, Perfect Humanity

The benevolent gods helped the Earth-crossing beings to spread faith within it.

However, there are also malevolent gods who will try to prevent this from happening, in order to prevent their enemies from growing stronger.

Especially, the followers of the gods are often tied to their "races". For example, the followers of the powerful god Rouss, who resides in the depths, are almost exclusively "dark elves". Other followers also exist, but their numbers are extremely small and can be ignored.

The war gods of the beastmen, the spirit gods of the elves, and the gods of the half-human tribe, as well as the wandering gods, are mostly like this.

However, among the Earth-crossing beings, there are over 6.7 billion people who are all human.

Even though there are those who say that one grain of rice can feed one hundred, they still cannot escape this category.

No matter how the groups within this category quarrel and disperse, it is all within the category of humanity. The extreme factions are few in number.

Therefore, when the gods who favor humanity lean towards the human tribe, many hidden forces and secret powers are secretly manipulating and stirring up the hearts of the ambitious, causing the power of the human tribe to disperse.

Even in the depths of hell, they are hiding, waiting to reap the souls on a large scale.

As was said in the past, many souls of humans died out because they had not had the chance to form a strong faith, and many evil souls flowed down to the underworld, supplementing the power of the depths and hell, which led to the appearance of the later "Sealing the Demons" war.

Naturally, Zhao Xiu had played a similar role to a "terrorist" in front of him, spreading the "Return of the Dead" sect's "Death Teachings" across the barren wasteland without any good impression.

This sect, which specializes in controlling the power of the dead, is actually the most suitable soil in this barren wasteland.

In this barren wasteland, even the undead creatures that cost a fortune to summon in ordinary times can be effortlessly raised by the negative energy aura around the corpses.

Then, these undead creatures can be used to harvest the lives of the living, creating a vicious cycle of harvesting and counter-harvesting.

At the same time, since this power can be easily controlled in this barren wasteland, even some traitors from the Earth's human faction will turn to the past and harvest their own lives.

This is the key factor that allows the secret sect that leans towards death in the past barren wasteland to have a huge impact.

At this moment, Zhao Xiu remembered the rumors of the Return of the Dead sect's innumerable atrocities, but he still maintained his composure.

He instantly noticed Tares' gaze shifting towards the giant worm night shadow.

In Zhao Xiu's mind, the rumors of the mystic forest flashed before his eyes, and even when he was facing the challenges in the real illusion, the mystic forest was the same as the one in front of him.

The originally fragmented network began to reveal its true face in front of Zhao Xiu.

"So, it looks like you're the master of this giant worm night shadow? Are you just summoned or created by the power of this region?"

"Now, you want to stop me? It's a bit too late," Zhao Xiu said with a hint of education.

As soon as he finished speaking, the originally calm Rasta's face suddenly changed color, despite his attempt to control his emotions.

"I'm sorry, but I'm also skilled in the art of death."

"Four Rings of Strong Acid!"

"The spell is extremely effective, born of twins, and extremely powerful (simulating potential points). Compress the ring count, calculate the attribute damage. 'Energy Shield' takes effect, canceling out attribute damage.

At this moment, Zhao Xu's entire body was like a highly precise instrument, with each ring not being executed without exception, like the waves of the sea, one after another.

In an instant, he completed the spell and, pointing at the giant bug Night Shadow, shot out a strong acid ball about 8 centimeters in diameter, approaching the length of his palm!

As each of the super-magical abilities was activated, the damage of the strong acid ball, originally 15-90 (15D6), gradually increased.

90HP (extremely effective).
180HP (born of twins).
232HP (extremely powerful)!

Just created, the giant bug Night Shadow was in the initial stage of its growth cycle. Without evolving, it still had only an average life of D12, but only 212 HP.

Appearing strong and mighty, it was just about to be covered by the 232 HP damage. Instantly, the body of this giant bug-like creature, like a bubble, melted and dissolved, with over a hundred long legs falling off, and the sharp teeth in its mouth also falling off. The main stem even broke into two sections.

The evil aura and destructive intent that had been emanating from its body suddenly disappeared without a trace.

In an instant, the giant bug Night Shadow seemed like a broken specimen, no longer possessing the slightest bit of its previous power."

As Zhao Xu saw the opponent's attachment to the target, he immediately drew his sword and struck, cutting down the opponent and cutting off any further nonsense between the two.

"No!"

Tarese, who had been acting like a high-level enigma from the start, let out a mournful cry and looked at his own reflection, which he had worked hard for over the years.

For the undead, their death is impossible to revive using the Five-Ring Revival Technique.

"It's your turn next!"

Zhao Xu, who was used to constantly fighting and counterattacking, seized the opportunity again. Before Tarese could react, he completed the spell and shot a "Strong Acid Ball" towards him, just like he had done to the giant bug Night Shadow.

However, the next moment, the Strong Acid Ball did not have the expected effect, and Tarese's entire body simply dissolved.

But it wasn't like it was replaying. Although Tarese didn't have a chance to counterattack, the "Strong Acid Ball" that had been infinitely upgraded and amplified when it touched Tarese, also dissolved into nothingness.

It was only then that Tarese revealed a sinister smile. "Do you think I would rashly rush forward?"

"This is the great power bestowed upon me by my master!" he exclaimed.

Standing opposite Zhao Xu, Tarese couldn't help but lower his head and gaze at himself. On his own body, he could see dozens of enduring spells constantly active, available 24/7.

He naturally understood the extent of this power.

However, Zhao Xu showed no signs of concern, but instead revealed a faint smile.

Magic is the interweaving of arrows and shields.

I use "Magic Missile" and you use "Shield Spell" to counter it, which is the normal way for mages to fight.
While Tarros summoned the undead creatures using the bodies of the original companions, the undead horde slowly began to advance towards the group of high school boys and girls. However, these teenagers, who had been playing games, didn't even lift a sword, as if they had lost all their fighting spirit.

This was also the reason why the undead cult could stir up a great commotion. They could transform the deceased relatives of the living into undead creatures, making it difficult for the living to muster the courage to resist, and even resulting in tragic scenes where the undead devoured the living.

However, just as Zhao Xuan had failed in his previous attempt, he suddenly realized that the key to the problem lay with Tarros. Smiling, he raised the super magical staff in his hand and unleashed another five-ring spell - Reverse Vortex!

Casting spells is a skill, and disassembling spells is also a skill. From the moment he started to dispel the three-ring spell to the moment he cast the anti-magic barrier, the curse of Ottiluke, the spell of destruction, the spell of theft, the spell of disintegration, the high-level anti-magic spell, and the spell of disintegration, it was all about disassembling spells.

The target of Zhao Xuan's spell was the one that he had carefully wrapped in a spell, making it as prickly as a hedgehog. Suddenly, Tarros, who had been smiling, discovered that the "magical energy" that had been enveloping his body was being controlled by Zhao Xuan, and he fell backwards, forming a reverse vortex.

The magical energy that had been turned around was like an internal martial arts expert moving in reverse, with the true energy reversing and accelerating towards its demise. Similarly, the precise machinery-like operation of the magic was the same principle.

In an instant, Tarros felt the magical energy that had been protecting him, and he was suddenly transformed into countless sharp blades, which were constantly being honed and sharpened.
Here is the translation of the text:

Under the influence of the "Feedback Vortex", every "X-Ring Spell" will cause 3D6 damage to the opponent, such as a high-level mage's shield. This is also the reason why Zhao Xu wants to maximize the effectiveness of this spell.

Tarese's plea for the patron deity to imbue him with as many spells as possible has resulted in a massive amount of spell damage, which has been absorbed by Tarese. The instant, massive spell damage has knocked Tarese down, making it difficult for him to recover.

Tarese, who was once easy to defeat, has now become more cautious in his approach, taking into account the development of the situation. From his vantage point, he can see the extent to which the evil forces have infiltrated, far more deeply than he had previously thought.

As a result, he quickly contacts Ailan, passing on information about the evil cults, and declares that he will not spare anyone who belongs to such cults.

Zhao Xu, who has mastered the power of the powerful forces, is no longer fighting alone. However, he does not use his revival spell to bring back the deceased members of his team with kindness. Revival is a serious matter that comes with a great cost, and Zhao Xu cannot afford to show mercy.

Therefore, instead of directly saving his teammate, who has died after being consumed, Zhao Xu tasks the remaining team members with a mission. Once the mission is complete, he will grant them a seven-ring revival spell, turning them into immortal teammates.

After completing these tasks, Zhao Xu also gives his teammate a gold coin with a primary spell, allowing them to immediately teleport away. With that, he sets off on his journey to the next destination.
Because there exists a perfect human being there.
