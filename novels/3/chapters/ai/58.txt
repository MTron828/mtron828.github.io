Chapter 59: Reading Magic

The next day, Zhao Xu woke up early, finished preparing his magic, and arrived at the "Knowledge Library" in the floating city at dawn. This library is a popular spot for wizards who want to improve their knowledge and skills. The library is divided into several sections, each corresponding to a specific category of knowledge and skills.

As a wizard, Zhao Xu was used to finding a quiet corner to study. He had been reading diligently since the day before, following Anni's advice to set his skill preferences on the character card. He was eager to see when he could upgrade his skills to level 1.

This was what Anni had said would happen. Zhao Xu couldn't help but be surprised. Even though knowledge and skills were crucial in adventures, he couldn't resist reading so much. After upgrading his skills, he could search for information on the information panel.

By passing a test, he could obtain partial information, depending on his skill level. The system was similar to the academic search engine in the Arthurian world.

However, many warriors still refused to invest in knowledge skills. Each profession has its own specialty, and knowledge is a wizard's specialty. He could exchange 1 skill point for 1 level of skill.

But for warriors, knowledge was a cross-professional skill, requiring 2 skill points to upgrade to level 1, which was a double-edged sword.

Zhao Xu released a zero-level spell "Reading Magic" and immediately opened the mysterious book he had borrowed to start reading. He cherished every second.

This is something he had complained about countless times yesterday.

Authors of popular science books on mysticism cannot use simple language to write. They must use cryptic magical script, or it won't be impressive.

Zhao Xu has zero knowledge, skills, and spell recognition skills, making it risky for him to read mysticism books. Under pressure, he could only use the "Reading Magic" spell to decode the techniques.

As a result, his reading efficiency was low, and he could only maintain a pace of about one minute per page.

The "Reading Magic" spell has a continuous duration of 10 minutes for a 10th-level spellcaster.

As a poor 1st-level mage, Zhao Xu could only maintain the spell for 10 minutes.

After using up the 2-hour reading time, he would have to use a slower reading method.

The power of many spell effects is determined by the caster's level.

If Zhao Xu waited until he became a 2nd-level mage, he could maintain the "Reading Magic" spell for 20 minutes, which would be more convenient.

The high ceiling and eternal magical lighting surrounding him made him feel sleepy. His 17-point intelligence attribute was not yet real, and he struggled to stay awake while reading these mystical books.

In comparison, the motivation to upgrade his knowledge and skills was much lower.

This is also the reason why most players and mages don't come to this library, with most of them gathering at the spellcasting guild instead.
Here is the translation of the text:

Suddenly, Zhao Xu saw An Ti Nuo Ya holding a book with mysterious symbols on the cover, sitting opposite him and reading it.

Zhao Xu was taken aback and said, "Teacher, are you also reading a book?"

Although Zhao Xu had never seen An Ti Nuo Ya's true face, he could only recognize him through the faint outline of his face under the dim light.

However, after spending time together, Zhao Xu could immediately recognize An Ti Nuo Ya even if he changed his clothes.

"I still have unused skill points at my level, so I naturally need to use them up," An Ti Nuo Ya said carelessly, flipping through the book in his hand.

The cover of the book in An Ti Nuo Ya's hand had three warning stickers attached.

Yesterday, he had been warned by the administrator not to access books with warning stickers.

The number of warning stickers on the book An Ti Nuo Ya was holding was likely to be legendary-level, which was difficult for anyone to touch.

"What don't you know?" Zhao Xu wondered, looking around to make sure no one was listening.

An Ti Nuo Ya glanced at Zhao Xu and said, "You don't know what?"

"What do you know?" Zhao Xu asked, looking around cautiously.

As a public place like the Float City, most places had already screened out divination detection methods, making it difficult to eavesdrop.

"This is not a secret," An Ti Nuo Ya said. "It's just that you want to become a legendary mage, and the requirements for this skill are determined by the number of legendary spells you can cast."

"What requirements?" Zhao Xu asked, his ears perked up.

"Can you cast a ninth-level spell?" An Ti Nuo Ya asked.

Zhao Xu shook his head. "Not yet."

"So what are you asking so many questions for?"

"Not a secret, right?" Zhao Xu asked again.

"It's not a secret for a 20th-level mage, but it is for someone like you who is a 1st-level mage."
Here is the translation:

When he heard those words, Zhao Xu directly went back to looking at his mysterious books.

However, after knowing that it was related to the legendary mage, the magical words in the book came alive.

Every time he read a sentence, he felt that the "legendary mage's progress bar" behind him was constantly displaying "experience +1".

Ten minutes later, the "reading magic" on Zhao Xu's body officially ended.

The originally gentle and kind magical words suddenly changed into a complex form, and his eyes couldn't focus.

Zhao Xu hastily closed the book and was about to pick up the transparent crystal on the table to cast the "reading magic" again.

He suddenly remembered that Enninoa had never cast a spell.

As a legendary mage, Enninoa must have over 20 levels.

Isn't it that she could cast the zero-level spell "reading magic" for 200 minutes, which is 3-4 hours?

Thinking of this, Zhao Xu quickly went over and said, "Teacher, let's discuss this."

"What is it?" Enninoa looked at Zhao Xu with a good mood while still looking at the book.

"Teacher, can you release a 'reading magic' for me?"

"Teacher, your level is definitely capable of lasting 4 hours. But I can only last 10 minutes, which is too short. Can't we compromise? It's just a zero-level spell slot."

Zhao Xu asked with a hopeful expression.

Enninoa turned her head formally and looked at Zhao Xu.

"You don't have the 'spell delay' expertise in your planned field, and you can combine it with it to last 20 minutes."

Zhao Xu could only look at the other person with a helpless expression.

"Oh, I forgot to mention it to you yesterday, and you shouldn't casually combine this expertise."

"It's fine, anyway, I'll teach you the remaining expertise later, and we can do it together then."
However, I need to tell you a few things. Anzinoja continued to say.

"I didn't prepare the 'Reading Magic' spell today at zero-level."

"That's not the case, then you don't need the ability to read magic?" Zhao Xu was stunned.

"No, I have already stabilized this spell."
