Chapter 222: Awakening Item

As soon as the news spread, the entire market erupted in a commotion, with merchants and customers alike gathering to take a look. It had been a long time since the city had seen such a lively atmosphere.

"A three-ring mage, that's impossible. Not possible at all. The locals wouldn't dare to provoke the city's mage association, which receives a monthly management fee from the market. The city's government even passes through the association. The folks from Wolan are too clever to make such a mistake."

After analyzing the situation, Shen Nian's eyes showed a hint of puzzlement. "It's strange that they would clash with a three-ring mage and then get killed. Moreover, they're hiding in the temple, clearly intending to make a move before coming out to say anything."

"Could it be that their target was actually a player, only to find out that the opponent was a three-ring mage?"

After speaking, the two of them exchanged a glance, then burst out laughing.

This is completely impossible.

It's known that the top-ranked 4th-level mage had just leveled up to 5th level. It's clear that there are no hidden rules in this game. Players can't just flip the forum.

Moreover, this "jump clause" has been triggered, and everyone knows the inside story. If the mage had indeed reached level 5, the "jump clause" would have been reactivated.

But this time, it's just a two-line jump, not a one-line jump.
Here is the translation of the text:

However, if you don't understand it that way, it's completely unreasonable.

The Wulan team itself is highly organized, with a vast network of informants on the street. Moreover, after forming an alliance with the "Zuixing Lake" mining association, their influence has expanded further.

Currently, players are still using defensive gear with a defensive strength of only 1-3 levels, such as the "Thick Armor" and "Mosaic Leather Armor", which cost only a few dozen gold coins. On the other hand, Wulan has already equipped her bodyguards with Arthurian local warriors, and the equipment provided by the bodyguards is at least "+7" level defensive gear.

It was only because they didn't have any countermeasures that they were easily wiped out. Otherwise, with the strength of those bodyguards, it would have been possible to delay the city guards from coming to their aid.

This point is clear to everyone, and there's no need to say another word.

"In reality, if it weren't for those bodyguards, Wulan's team, which relied on eating players to get fat, would have been wiped out in the wild long ago." Shen Nian continued to add.

As a mage, her key attribute is charm, not intelligence. However, in her previous life, she was able to squeeze out other intelligent mages and become a key personnel in the high-level organization "Mystic Consultant Team", with her thinking ability not being bad.

"The birds are shot, and then they're pecked by crows. It's what they deserve," the apprentice mage player said with a hint of indignation.

"Have you been harvested?" Zhao Xu asked curiously, weighing the bronze carving in his hand.
Here is the translation of the text:

"They've been bullying players way too much," Shen Nian explained. "But as a projection-based community, we're relatively self-contained, so there aren't many complaints to the Winter City authorities."

Zhao Xu nodded slightly after hearing these words.

At the beginning of the server, players would react to incidents by directly taking revenge or reporting to the city's NPC authorities. Therefore, regardless of who was right or wrong, the city guards and law enforcement were all very distressed. It wasn't until this month that the player's order improved, and the number of disturbances to local residents decreased.

"Hey, Ran Yi," the apprentice said, "if you really want to give your brother a gift, I heard that the lion cubs in Winter City are about to hatch. Many people have already started reserving them. I heard that Wulan and her team have reserved at least two."

"How much do those lion cubs cost?" Shen Nian asked, with a hint of hesitation.

The lion cubs have a life total of 7, although they can't compare to a level 7 character. However, they have a minimum of 59 HP. For one- or two-star players pairing up with a lion, it's really a ride that can fight back.

When they encounter battles, they can simply dismount and let their ride fight. It's even more so when they have the ability to fly, which is a dream come true for many players.

The Lion Rider Squadron of the Northern Alliance has made a name for itself throughout the north.

"Ah, I think it's...," the apprentice said, recalling a conversation he had heard at the Mage Academy.

"Lion cubs cost 3500 gold coins each, young lions cost 7000 gold coins, and the price of hiring a professional trainer to raise or train a giant hawk is 1500 gold coins," Zhao Xu said lightly, adjusting his monocle.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

Thanks to the stable prices of rare materials, the data he had obtained through his previous investigations could now be put to good use. He still remembered the brother of the woman, Shen Nian, Shen Ze, who had mentioned it to him during a meal. If Zhao Xu was willing to join their sacred guardian organization, he could give him a special privilege. However, Zhao Xu knew that Shen Ze's intention was not genuine, but rather to support him in his revenge and deduct it from his own share. Therefore, Zhao Xu refused the offer.

Zhao Xu knew that a lion's pride, which was impossible to help him achieve his goals. Shen Nian and her companion were taken aback when they heard Zhao Xu's offer. A "magic weapon with a +1 enhancement" was only 3000 gold coins. Having it would make him a respected figure among players. Shen Nian suddenly realized why her brother had been cheated, and she thought of a different way to achieve her goal.

"Ah, my brother must not be able to afford it," Shen Nian said softly, her head bowed. However, the holy warrior was never one to spare expenses. The apprentice magician beside him sighed, "Oh, it's tough." Zhao Xu had made up his mind, but he noticed the apprentice's sigh and couldn't help but ask, "Are you stuck at which stage?"

Although Zhao Xu had taken the shortcut, he had undergone rigorous training in the final scroll and had gained a lot of knowledge in the legendary library. Otherwise, Zhao Xu wouldn't have posted on the forum. "I've actually read the article 'The Way of the Magician' written by Dong Cheng Ling, the god of Eastern City, and I have some ideas," the apprentice magician said, sighing again.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

"Yeah, that's not so good," Shen Nian thought to herself, assuming that the other person would never be able to master the spellcasting technique and was always worried.

"That's true, it's really hard for a beginner, with only two or three spell slots, so I'm wondering whether I should choose a specialization path," the apprentice said.

Hearing this, Shen Nian fell silent.

As a mage herself, Shen Nian's path didn't quite align with that of a wizard, and at this moment, she didn't feel like giving advice.

There are eight major schools of magic, divided into "protection", "curse", "plasticity", "prophecy", "change", "mind control", "illusion", and "transmutation".

Specialized wizards, on the other hand, choose to specialize in one school and abandon another, never to learn or release spells from the abandoned school again.

Once they make this choice, specialized wizards can prepare an additional specialized spell at each level.

The upgrade from two to three spell slots is considerable.

As for giving up on a school, many players feel that it's unlikely they'll be able to learn the spells in the future, so giving up is not a waste.

"Hey, that 'path of the wizard' post from before was also vague about specialization, otherwise I wouldn't be so troubled," the apprentice said.

The cost of investing in magic is enormous, unlike warriors who can quickly regain their former level by restarting a new character. Therefore, the wizard community is very cautious.

Zhao Xu didn't expect to run into a fellow forum player who had been introduced to him by someone else.

He also put aside his initial wariness and consoled, "Actually, if you don't have a special cultivation path, just following the straightforward path of a wizard won't be a loss."
Here is the translation:

As if he were a "sorcerer" on a path of inheritance, he remembered that there should be no such region as the "North Land", not even the "Floating City" would be accessible. When he wrote that post, he was full of insight. After being influenced by recent events, his insight has reached a new level.

So he decided to wait until he reaches level 5 before updating his "Path of the Mage" 2.0.

Although he lags behind high-level mages, his height has already enabled him to look down on all novice mages, including Ashe and Wang Qingwei.

The apprentice's expression turned slightly gloomy, indicating that he didn't take Zhao Xu's words to heart.

Zhao Xu turned to Shen Nian and asked, "Do you know the effects of the Copper Lion Eagle?"

Shen Nian's eyes widened slightly, and she then smiled and said, "I know."

She pointed to the statue in Zhao Xu's hand and said, "If it's real, after saying the activation spell, this statue will come to life as a true 'Lion Eagle' magical beast. I remember that it can be used twice a week, each time lasting 6 hours."

"No mistake," Zhao Xu nodded in agreement.

Knowing the basic content, there's no fear of the treasure being dusty.

Arthur's magical items are often accompanied by specific spells, which are the fundamental principles of the items.

The "Star-studded Cloak" on Zhao Xu's body is the same spell as the name suggests, while the "Fox's Cunning" two-ring spell enhances intelligence temporarily.

The "Copper Lion Eagle" item is actually an application of the six-ring spell "Activating Items".

"This statue is real, but it's somewhat damaged. It can still be activated twice a week, but the duration is only 4 hours. I estimate it will be worth less, so take it back to your brother," he said.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu directly handed the statue back to Shen Nian. "Don't joke around," Shen Nian didn't expect that Zhao Xu, who had just reminded her that the antitoxin had a problem, would be so humorous.

After handing it over, Zhao Xu didn't say much. In his previous life, Shen hadn't talked to him about this statue, and he didn't lack the skills of a "determiner" either. He estimated that this treasure had been overlooked.

Zhao Xu also took out a receipt and wrote a password on it lightly, then handed it to Shen Nian. Then he turned around and left.

Since the newsboy could come and shout about the matter, it meant that information about his features would spread soon. He had to disguise himself as a villager at Jiao Zhuang first.

At this moment, Shen Nian lowered her head and unfolded the paper, which was indeed written in a password in plain language.

But Shen Nian was confused and looked up to ask Zhao Xu's name. However, Zhao Xu's figure had already disappeared in the bustling market.

"I'm going, he's going so fast, he can't become invisible," the apprentice thought, lowering his head and then looking up, only to find that Zhao Xu's figure was gone.

However, he quickly called out to Shen Nian, "Try it, it's not a scam."

"It might be a password for getting rich," Shen Nian thought to herself, wondering why there were so many stories about getting rich overnight.

But Shen Nian didn't know why, perhaps it was Zhao Xu's previous words that made her realize that he was definitely not an ordinary person.

Shen Nian thought for a moment and still held the statue, reading the cursive characters on the paper aloud.
Here is the translation of the text:

She was a bit strange, nowadays players could write common language so fluently, as if they had written for many years, with their own habits included.

Just as Shen Nian finished speaking, she suddenly felt the statue in her hand vibrate slightly.

With incredulous eyes, Shen Nian hastily released the bronze statue, letting it fall onto the table.

Immediately, a strong gust of wind swept across the entire market.

"What the devil, where did this wind come from at noon?" A merchant hastily put away the books blown open and rehung the sign that said "No early reading" before asking the customer in front of him, but the customer was now turning his head in another direction.

He couldn't help but lift his head and find that everyone around him was turning their bodies in the same direction, as if they were all being drawn in.

He wondered what was so exciting and good-looking, and his curiosity drove him to look in that direction.

Next, he couldn't help but turn his eyes away.

A lion-eagle with lion and eagle features, with a full-body golden glow, looked proudly at the people present.

The lion-eagle simultaneously spread its wings, with its double wings almost seven or eight meters long, towering over two floors. It was as if it had covered the entire area.

If it weren't for the vast empty space above the market, it would not have been able to accommodate such a large magical beast.

At this moment, this merchant was only thinking one thought in his mind:

Someone has found treasure, and it's going to be a windfall.
