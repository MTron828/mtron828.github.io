Chapter 420: I am Xunmia

Winter City, Temple of the Magic Goddess.

It was supposed to be a day when the faithful could visit the temple in the morning, but the clergy inside the temple were busy rushing around, their footsteps hurried.

"Archbishop Sosa."

At this moment, a nun knocked on the doorframe of the reception room, waited for a response, and then walked in, her head bowed. She immediately recognized the commander of the city guard sitting opposite Archbishop Sosa.

The others sitting nearby were the high-ranking clergy of this temple.

The nun, following etiquette, walked to the front of the Archbishop's seat and placed a sealed envelope on the table, whispering softly, "This is a letter from the diocese that was just sent."

As the highest responsible person in this Winter City temple, Archbishop Sosa quickly picked up the letter, opened it, and began to read.

The diocese that the nun mentioned is responsible for governing all the female goddess temples in the northern territories of the Ice Mountain Range. Its highest-ranking official is also Archbishop Sosa's future goal - the Red Bishop.

"What does the diocese think?" "Should we take action immediately?"

After hearing the urgent questions from the two high-ranking clergy, everyone in the reception room leaned in to listen carefully.

Many times, nothing happens suddenly.

Once the church decides to take action, it will be a thunderous storm.

Archbishop Sosa suddenly became stern, "According to the instructions from the church headquarters, we will continue to maintain the status quo."

This unexpected decision caught everyone off guard.

They didn't expect that, even in front of a secret and important high-level artifact, the church high-ranking officials were indifferent.

This sudden development left the city guard system, which had been eager to take action, feeling half-hearted.
Here is the translation:

As the scribe looked at an earlier report, he recorded that the first person to enter the "Aizhou Palace" was a wizard named Zhong Xia. The scribe was silent.

...Later, at noon, Nan Xiaoyu was astonished to see Zhao Xu, who had never been on time before, suddenly appear at the dinner table, without any delay or obstruction.

Although it was just a few days until the New Year, she couldn't help but ask, "What a coincidence, you're actually on time to eat lunch today."

Zhao Xu simply rubbed his stiff neck and ignored Nan Xiaoyu's words, directly serving himself and sitting down to eat.

In reality, he was also surprised. After installing the key on the stone tablet, he had heard the news that he had opened the first seal. This live broadcast made him feel both excited and embarrassed.

This meant that the process of opening the next six doors would be transparent, in real-time synchronization with the outside world. However, others who opened the seals would also be able to know about it in real-time.

But what bothered Zhao Xu was that he could only open one door a day. He wanted to open the second door, but had to wait for the first door to open 24 hours later. This was information unknown to the outside world.

Zhao Xu and Veve also inferred some internal information based on the information displayed on the stone tablet after inserting the key.

At this moment, Zhao Xu was browsing the forum posts of players who had entered the Aizhou Palace, and his guesses had become somewhat clear.

Most people on the forum were still in the dark, making various strange and absurd guesses. However, Zhao Xu, with his higher-level knowledge, was unable to explain the situation in a timely manner due to his vested interests.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Hey, Zhao Xu, did you see the two hottest topics on the forum today?"

Zhao Xu suddenly thought of the player, Yu Xiaoyi, who was also an Arthur player, and even gave him a face in KTV, although it was thanks to another powerful player, Wang Qingwei.

"What do you mean, Dong Chengling and that explosive news?" Yu Xiaoyi suddenly got interested.

"Yes," Zhao Xu replied calmly, "Dong Chengling is actually a student from our school, don't you know who she is? Ha ha, I don't think you know her."

As he spoke, Yu Xiaoyi's eyes were fixed on Zhao Xu, as if hoping he would reveal some key names.

In essence, the topic was that students from Zhao Xu's school, who played Arthur, had been asked about it on the forum, in the group, and in real life by players.

"You're overthinking it," Zhao Xu replied calmly, "Our school is a node in the entire region's educational system, so it's not necessarily a high school in the entire city."

Zhao Xu didn't want to stir up trouble, as he still had four months left before graduation.

"Hmph, doesn't your school happen to be in the Northern Alliance, do you have any inside information?" Yu Xiaoyi asked, frowning.

"What do you want to know?" Zhao Xu asked, taking a bite of a piece of meat and chewing it thoughtfully, looking at Yu Xiaoyi's worried face.

"This, that," Yu Xiaoyi thought Zhao Xu was serious, so he quickly asked, "And isn't the player, Zhong Xia, a mage, accompanying another NPC, Weiwei, into the city? And the adventurer team outside is also entering the city."
Here is the translation of the text:

"Just those teams that have cleared the first test have emerged from the cramped space and entered a vast hall with 12 large doors. However, they said that the stone tablet in front has six complete and intact keyholes, with no signs of one being opened. 

Zhao Xu couldn't help but laugh after hearing this, which was also the most intense point on the forum right now. "Refresh the page again, and you might be able to see the answer," Zhao Xu said.

"Ah?" South Xiaoyi looked puzzled, but she still had a habit of listening and followed Zhao Xu's advice, refreshing the page directly. She couldn't help but bite her lip.

"What's going on?" South Xiaoyi exclaimed.

It turned out that several other teams of adventurers had entered the hall earlier, but only now had someone posted about it.

"That's correct," Zhao Xu said. "The hall with the sealed stone tablet is parallel. All adventurer teams that enter will have a separate generated hall, so they won't meet each other in that hall."

Zhao Xu only realized this after reading the posts and replies.

"What about the trials inside the doors?" South Xiaoyi asked, her eyes wide with excitement, having encountered such high-level content for the first time.

"That's natural," Zhao Xu said. "Adventurer teams that choose the same door will meet each other at the same time."

Zhao Xu didn't continue talking after that.

After they broke the magic seal, the space would reset, and the previously broken bridge would be restored.

This means that the other teams would also have to complete the six seals one by one.

In other words, Zhao Xu had already surpassed all the adventurer teams that had entered, having completed one seal in advance.

In the next day's adventure, he might encounter other teams that had entered earlier."
Here is the translation of the text:

If they encountered a similar situation today, such as a broken bridge, Zhao Xu would only have the opportunity to continue through after the other party had reset the scene. However, he realized that the seemingly unsolvable magical seal barrier still left a glimmer of hope for people to pass through. The method to reach the midpoint of the bridge was actually to rely on the shattered stone bridge. As for passing through the portal afterwards, it was still possible to lure the golden golem away by sacrificing one's life, and then activate the platform to open the portal and leave. In essence, it was a worthless strategy, but it would still lead to countless people sacrificing their lives.

"Oh, it's such a pity!" Lu Xiaoyou frowned and said, "If only I could enter."

"You're going to send yourself to death?" Zhao Xu retorted.

"That's not what I meant," Lu Xiaoyou pouted and refuted, "I'm saying that I might be able to pass through."

"This place is now a battlefield where everyone kills each other, especially when encountering the same level," Zhao Xu said, "Are you sure you can beat other players with equal conditions?"

"Okay."

"Good, go level up." Zhao Xu ordered, "I'll be settled soon, and then I'll come find you in the town and take you some equipment."

As soon as he heard the word "equipment", Lu Xiaoyou's eyes lit up, but when he thought about the speaker of this sentence being the present Zhao Xu, he couldn't help but suspect, "Do you still have equipment? I've heard it's very expensive."
Here is the translation of the text:

Every little girl has a hero figure from a young age, thinking that the other person is capable of anything, but eventually, they will gradually realize that humans are limited, and the other person is not truly a superhero.

As a result, the fairy tale crumbles, and they grow up.

"Did I deceive you?" Zhao Xu had almost finished his last few mouthfuls of food.

"Hey, hey, what's your username in the game?" Nan Xiaoyu heard this and couldn't help but clear her throat, asking in a cute, loli-like tone.

Zhao Xu couldn't help but shudder, and almost opened the other person's mouth to check.

"Okay, I'm allergic to this."

At this point, he had already stood up, "I'm Xunxia, and my nickname is ZX."
Nan Xiaoyu heard this and couldn't help but be stunned.
