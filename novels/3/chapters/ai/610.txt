Chapter 611 First Attack!
The premise of creating "Olympus Crystals" is to have fist-sized "magic crystals", which are essentially "Arthurian Dragon Crystals", but with the added effect of recording spell models.
The majority of dragon crystals mined by Arthur are too small in volume, which is why "Olympus Crystals" have not been widely promoted.
Once this path is opened by Zhao Xu, it may mean that the "copying costs" for the entire Yanan region's mages can be minimized to the extreme.
"Lone Star Mage, do you have any thoughts?"
Looking at Zhao Xu's silent appearance, the surrounding members couldn't help but urge him.
This matter also made them unable to resist being excited. The mage community has always been hovering between "poverty" and "wealth". On the one hand, they need to spend a lot of gold coins for magic experiments and studying spells. On the other hand, magic is Arthur's productivity, so mages essentially control production resources. Once magic items are produced, they make a lot of money.
"Indeed, that's true. Magic crystals are essentially Arthurian Dragon Crystals," Zhao Xu said to the excited adventurers.
"So as long as we find that vein, we can mass-produce 'Olympus Crystals'?" The female mage Feixu couldn't help but clench her fists, and her whole body was in an excited state, no longer the calm image she used to have, under the temptation of money.
Nadiria also held her hand, as if they were going to share this joy with each other.
"Don't get too excited just yet."
Facing this seemingly promising situation, Zhao Xu felt that he needed to clarify the difficulties first.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Generally, dragon crystal veins are found in dimly lit, humid wetlands, such as shallow areas of marshes. Original dragon crystals are wrapped in a rocky outer shell."

At this moment, Zhao Xu was completely uninterested and continued to consume "lucky points" to add to his mysterious knowledge test.

Instantly, all knowledge related to dragon crystals was revealed at the 86th level of knowledge (mysterious).

If Arthur had knowledge of physics, Nobel laureates would have a skill value of 40+ in this area.

Especially when he combined his knowledge of geography with his skills, the search results would be even more abundant.

"The first dragon crystal vein discovered by Arthur was in the Kova wetland, where the dragon crystal was wrapped in rock. Over time, due to the erosion of warm, foamy water, the rock had already cracked and revealed the dragon crystal."

"The last villager to pass by accidentally discovered the dragon crystal through the crack, but even so, it was still extremely difficult to find dragon crystal rocks, even in the largest wetland collection area on the west bank of the Nalu River, let alone extract them."

"Only experienced explorers can find them, and the rocky wrapping around the dragon crystal is also very hard, making it impossible to extract the dragon crystal like opening an eggshell. After extraction, the internal dragon crystal often becomes pulverized."

As Zhao Xu spoke, he looked at the crowd's slowly recovering calm faces. "When collecting in waist-deep or deeper mud, the surrounding area is also fraught with danger. The local most famous Sakuru family collects about one or two rock crystals per month, and the remaining fragments are often dozens of crystal fragments."
In addition to closely following the three sisters of Zhao Xu's roses, most of the other players who dare to come down at this time are experienced players with a lot of adventure tools of all sizes on their bodies.

Zhao Xu's words are also telling them.

If the dragon crystal is really discovered in this underground area, the difficulty of mining is beyond their imagination.

"No matter whether we can mine it or not, we have to try it. This may be the hope of our human race on Earth," a warrior player named "Luli" said. He is also a powerful warrior player over level 7, showing a strong sense of justice.

Zhao Xu did not comment on this.

This mysterious cave, to exaggerate, he even suspects it is the interface of "Arthur", located at the boundary between other planes, such as the "negative energy plane", which is why there are so many undead creatures here.

But after he said this, his image as a dragon crystal expert was also established. In the future, Zhao Xu has the final say on all issues related to dragon crystals in this team.

"So, just looking for the exit of the teleportation gate here puts unimaginable pressure on us. When mining veins, if there is no teleportation gate on the spot, it is simply unimaginable," the second sister, a female priest named Qinglu, rarely spoke.

At this point, Zhao Xu slowly judged that she used to be a former priest who believed in another powerful god, "Spider Queen" Ross.

"But now the entire barbaric dead land, who has the ability to build a teleportation gate?" the young wizard was in a dilemma.

Instantly, everyone's eyes refocused on Zhao Xu.

The largest teleportation gate network in the entire Arthur world is hidden within the Mage Association, but players have only used it a few times due to "missions".
But even so, the reputation of the "portal" has spread throughout the entire gaming community.

"Didn't they say that Fallen Star Town got permission to build a 'portal'?" suddenly, the wandering guest Nadiria asked, clearly her gaze had never left Fallen Star Town.

If one were to evaluate what magical item the guilds most wanted to possess, the "portal," which could save countless escort fees and avoid crisis by reducing travel distance, would definitely be at the top of the list.

In a society with underdeveloped transportation, the cost of transportation is immeasurable in terms of the cost of a commodity. This is also the reason why during an economic crisis, farmers would rather pour milk down the drain, as after factoring in transportation costs, selling a bottle of milk at a loss is not worth it.

"No, the portal is a complex magical item. Even if an ordinary person has the expertise and formula for 'creating wonders,' they cannot create it," the female mage Qingli corrected, "And the portal cannot change its location just by moving the gate. So the original portal was still located in Fallen Star Town."

For some reason, even though the female mage Qingli was standing behind Zhao Xu and not directly facing everyone, she always felt that Nadiria had something to say, so as a subordinate of Yanan, she had to step forward to explain clearly.

"But it is undeniable that if anyone can establish a 'portal' in the found ore vein, it would definitely be Yanan," Nadiria said confidently, and the female mage Feixu beside her nodded in agreement.

It was as if at this moment, they were the spokespersons for Yanan.

Meanwhile, Zhao Xu just smiled faintly. When the goddess moved the entire Fallen Star Town Mage Association to Yanan, the coordinates were also moved.
Zhao Xu once spent a great deal of effort just to rebuild a teleportation gate, connecting "Falling Star Town" and the "Barbaric Wasteland". But ironically, they needed to run errands, just to move the goddess's mouth.

During this time, Yanan was able to support a population of over 50 million people, relying on this teleportation gate to transport goods 24 hours a day. The advantage was that Zhao Xu left behind a brand new teleportation gate, hidden in the Barbaric Wasteland. If the mineral vein could really be found, he would use special means to directly move the teleportation gate over, saving dozens of days of construction time.

He even had a "teleportation array" scroll in his pocket, combined with the "magic constant spell", which was a small-scale one-way teleportation gate with reduced carrying capacity, but it could be completed in three rounds of time.

So Nati Ruya was not accurate enough. Yanan can actually achieve it now, and there is more than one way. It was just a moment, and Zhao Xu's heart tightened. His powerful listening skills made him aware of the footsteps spreading slowly in the air.

Like dewdrops that had just dripped for a long time, dripping, but also rippling in his eardrums. No! Zhao Xu suddenly realized that it was an ambush! However, everyone's faces remained calm, without any panic. Only Zhao Xu entered the "ambush round"! After this close encounter, everyone in the team will realize that the attack is coming.

This is a master's confrontation, but enough to determine life and death in the "ambush round"!
Arthur's ambush troops are very fond of using the "Archer Corps" to ambush. After they launch a round of "arrow rain" attacks, the ambushed team is likely to suffer heavy casualties and become completely ineffective in battle.

A direct assault to the death, not giving the enemy a chance for a face-to-face confrontation.

Therefore, countless adventurer teams attach great importance to the issue of "ambush". If both sides discover each other at the same time, then both are unprepared and will directly engage in battle.

Therefore, "scouting" and "listening" are two skills that can detect the enemy, making them essential skills for adventurers and rangers!

However, there are also a few creatures like minotaurs that cannot be ambushed by Arthur's troops.

Of course, the mage's ninth ring spell "warning spell" can also ensure that they will react at the same time and not be attacked first.

At this moment, Zhao Xu shouted "enemy attack" and waited for everyone to react, then the long-range ambush of the ambush round was about to come.

In an instant, Zhao Xu decided to take action.

Generally speaking, when two enemies meet at a corner and perceive each other, without the advantage of a "time difference", it is a competition of who acts first, determined by reaction speed - "first strike"!

It involves many factors, from reaction nerves to physical control, and the key is to see who can sprint out of the runway faster without jumping the gun.

It ultimately boils down to the agility of both parties - adjusted by agility and then combined with the actual performance of that time!

If Zhao Xu's first strike is fast, he can ensure that his instant spell will blow up the enemy's head first!

Otherwise, in this situation, no matter what, he will be unscathed, but the same cannot be said for his teammates behind him. This is where Zhao Xu's skills are tested.

However, magic is an unpredictable system.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

Zhao Xu's agility adjustment reached 8 points, and his original combination of spells boosted his original instinct by 5 ranks, allowing him to react like an ancestor.

Moreover, the "attribute check" of the "agility check" is the fundamental principle of "first strike". Therefore, Zhao Xu's "improvisational spell" luck points can take effect.

At this moment, Zhao Xu casually discarded the remaining 16 luck points to his "first strike" pile.

In the next instant, Zhao Xu directly activated the "intuitive spell" - a rare spell that can automatically trigger when the player's instincts react quickly enough, known as "foreshadowing".

This directly upgraded Zhao Xu's 1-20 rank reaction performance to 20 ranks!

This means that regardless of how many times he starts, he can ensure that each time is in his most perfect state, with no error or fluctuation.

If the world's neural reflex time were infinitely small, then 20 ranks would be equivalent to infinity!

【Adventurer Zhongxiao, your first strike value is 39 = 8 (agility) + 5 (performance) + 16 (luck), and your first strike check is 39 + 1D20 = 39 + 20 (foreshadowing) = 59.】

This means that as long as the internal reflex nerves do not exceed 39, even if one's performance is the best it has ever been, it cannot compare to Zhao Xu's reaction speed!

Furthermore, relying on the power of the "foreshadowing" spell, Zhao Xu instantly knew the order of everyone's next actions!

This is the spell battle of mages, where they are dueling in every dimension that can be calculated!
