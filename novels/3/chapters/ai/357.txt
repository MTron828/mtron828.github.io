Chapter 358: Intellectual Headgear

The Association of Mages is powerless to restrict the widespread circulation of certain magical techniques, such as invisibility and flight, which have strategic value and are already well-known. As for the "Huxiao" school, which is one of the eight major schools, it involves manipulating people's minds and is extremely cautious in its transmission.

Starting from the first ring's "Enchanting Humans", it can change one's attitude.
Zhao Xu is currently unable to cast the four-ring poet's arcane art, which can forcibly control people's actions. However, he has already mastered the three-ring poet's arcane art "Secondary Compulsion", which can forcibly compel people to comply with his commands. In the final volume of the space, Zhao Xu obtained the "Fragments of Truth" and destroyed a family using the eight-ring "Family Compulsion" technique, which is stronger than the six-ring "Compulsion" technique.

However, this time, Zhao Xu is not trying to coerce Mrs. Betty into doing something against her will, nor is he trying to hypnotize her and make her completely lose her consciousness to control her. He simply wants to obtain information about "Frost Town" and has directly used the "Suggestion" technique he has been storing.

The "Suggestion" technique makes the recipient follow the suggested actions during the duration of the spell, and if the purpose is achieved earlier, the spell's effect will also terminate earlier. The only limitation is that the "requirement" of the "Suggestion" must be reasonable and rational, such as unreasonable demands that will directly cause the spell to fail.
Here is the translation:

Even if Zhao Xu wants to have this elegant Mrs. Betty as his mistress, the content of the " suggestion spell" must be rational, such as saying that having him as a mistress can help her in some way.

If the intention of the spell is invalidated and the spell's resistance also fails to take effect, the caster's intention will be influenced by the "suggestion spell", and many of the original strong wills may easily become vague and abandoned.

The "suggestion spell" is a two-ring poetic spell and also a three-ring magical art. Zhao Xu can use this spell when he becomes a four-level mage, but he has never taken action.

On the one hand, this spell is ineffective against players who have a shield in this year. On the other hand, he is also cautious about his own behavior.

Now everyone is a projection, and it's okay if they're deceiving each other. Once they become real humans, any spell can manipulate humans and dominate others.

This kind of illusion that ordinary people are unable to resist is easy to get caught up in. Zhao Xu has heard many similar examples in his past life.

Some people even resort to evil means, forcing the local church to intervene and punish the mages who have fallen into darkness. Zhao Xu has just used the "cover-up spell" technique, and Zheng Xin and Elliot were unable to detect it. They continued to chat with Mrs. Betty without noticing anything.

Slowly, Mrs. Betty began to reveal her plans. Mrs. Betty's family is located in Frostwood Town, which is a powerful clan in the town. She is here to arrange her son's return to her family and then return to Mistral with her family's power to compete with her son Harry for the ownership of the Purple Rose Business.

In just a few words, Mrs. Betty also discovered that Zhao Xu and his companions had come to Frostwood to settle a score for a believer.
Here is the translation of the text:

Mr. Zhongxia looked at the two team members and said, "I have two scrolls here that I'd like to give to them, but I'm not sure if they're suitable."

At this moment, Mrs. Beti flashed a smile at Zhao Xiu, but her gaze lingered on him.

Zhao Xiu was already spreading out a book from the legendary library he had borrowed, watching it with interest.

In reality, from the moment Mrs. Beti got on the carriage, Zhao Xiu's behavior had been quite subdued and he hadn't spoken much.

At this moment, he raised an eyebrow slightly and said, "You should ask them."

"That's perfect," Mrs. Beti said, "my sister won't need these scrolls, so I'll give them to you, and it will be more effective."

As she said this, she pulled out two magic scrolls from her pocket and handed them over one by one.

Eliot then opened the scroll and exclaimed in surprise, "This is the 'Power of the Ox' magic scroll, the second ring."

"Why didn't you use this scroll just now?" Eliot asked immediately.

If it weren't for Zhao Xiu's intervention, Mrs. Beti would have already become a prisoner by now.

As for her, she could not help but smile bitterly and say, "It's because I couldn't do it."

Zhao Xiu saw this and explained to the two of them, "The 'Power of the Ox' spell is a minute-level spell that can increase strength by 4 points. In theory, it's enough to elevate near-combat attacks to a higher level. The effect is not small. However, it's the same as not using the shield spell scroll from the beginning. It's all the same principle."

Eliot finally understood.

When using magic scrolls, either you're someone who can cast the spell on your own, like Zhao Xiu, and can use the scroll without any obstacles. If you're a non-mage who wants to use the scroll, you need to have received training in the "Magic Device Use" skill.

It's not easy to do so.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

Just like verifying knowledge, using a magical device requires going through a difficulty level to communicate with the source of magic and activate its power.

The difficulty level of simulating the use of a scroll is 20 plus the corresponding spellcaster level.

For example, if the spellcaster level is 3, the final skill usage result must be higher than 23 to successfully connect with the source of magic and trigger the effect of the scroll.

Even the second-ring divine magic requires 12 points of Perception attribute to cast, and if the person using the scroll doesn't have this attribute, they need to use the "Using a Magical Device" skill to simulate the attribute.

Although scrolls are much cheaper than "wands" and "staffs" that don't require difficulty levels, most people, including spellcasters, can only barely use them with sufficient skill points.

This highlights the value of the eternal magic staff that shoots two fireballs a day, which is always in Zhao Xu's hand.

In the second-ring magic, there are a series of spells that correspondingly enhance the six attributes, all of which can enhance 4 points of attribute value.

These are also the source of current attribute-enhancing equipment, and therefore cannot be stacked.

Compared to wearing an intelligence headband that can last 24 hours, the duration of the spell itself is actually quite short and has little practical meaning.

Ordinary people who want to experience a brief 4-point attribute boost may find that potions are a more convenient and faster route.

"However, if you're going out, even if you can't use it, it's okay to bring a 'fireball' scroll like this."

Zhao Xu didn't say anything else after that.
Here is the translation of the text:

However, what he meant was clear to everyone in the scene. Even if he cast the "Bull's Strength" spell on the strongest of the guards under the control of Mrs. Beatrix, it would still be nothing more than that. A warrior or martial artist of a similar level, facing another 50 cavalrymen, would be unable to turn the tide. Unless he could elevate his defense to an unbreakable level, there was still hope to wear down others.

"Sir, spells like the Fireball scroll are only available to purchase from the Association with an application from the wizard masters. It's not easy for ordinary people to obtain them from the Association without a suitable reason," Mrs. Beatrix explained.

The reasoning was correct, but Zhao Xu's gaze was still fixed on Mrs. Beatrix, almost making him suspect her identity.

Mrs. Beatrix was taken aback for a moment, then quickly laughed and explained, "I'm not mistaken. My trading company does have the 'Fireball' scroll, but these things are too valuable to be bought by Harry, so I only brought some of the ones I've accumulated over the years when I came out."

Zhao Xu nodded to indicate he understood when he heard this.

At this time, Mrs. Beatrix noticed Zhao Xu was again bent over studying a book, and she hesitated, not knowing how to bring up her next request.

As she felt the warmth of the infant in her arms, Mrs. Beatrix thought to herself that she absolutely had to secure this heritage for him.

She didn't bother considering the presence of Zheng Xinru and other women in the carriage, and it seemed as if she felt a sense of heat, and without hesitation, she slowly opened the fastening of her fur-lined cloak, revealing her elegant figure inside.

But soon she felt something strange, as if she had lost the charm of a mature woman, and there was no gaze directed at her.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zheng Xin Yu looked at her with a straight face, seemingly uninterested in her physical appearance, just like Elliot, the young-looking pastor, who was responsible for leading the team, and Mrs. Betty, who had somewhat recovered from her previous decline. After a moment of thought, she continued to joke around, saying, "It just so happens that there's an auction in Frosthaven in a few days, where they're auctioning off some artifacts unearthed from a wizard's tomb. It's considered sensitive, so they're not holding it in Mistral. But in two days, many people will be heading there."

"I've heard that a +6 intelligence headpiece was unearthed," she said, "but unfortunately, the clergy members won't be able to use it. Otherwise, I would definitely pay more attention to it."

The mention of the intelligence headpiece caused Zhao Xu to pause, his finger hovering over the page he was reading.

The source of the headpiece's magic was the "Fox's Cunning" spell, which corresponded to a 4-point increase in intelligence attribute.

By mastering this spell and the "Crafting of Strange Items" specialization, along with a recipe, one could easily craft such a key item for wizards, known as the "Small God's Treasure".

Despite Zhao Xu gaining a 5-point intelligence boost from the "Blessing" spell and combining it with his upgraded 1-point attribute, his intelligence score increased from 16 to 22 points.

However, wizards always welcome more intelligence.

Intelligence determines the difficulty of magic spells and also determines the additional spell slots for wizards. Even the Druids of Arthur's people need at least 11 points of intelligence to learn the first-level spell. As for the clergy, they require 11 points of perception, while the Sorcerers need 11 points of charm.
When Zhao Xu was in the 5th grade, he had already gone to investigate the market for "Intelligence Headgear", a magical item that was not openly sold on the surface. The "Intelligence Headgear" was too popular, and the demand far exceeded the supply.

In the market, you could occasionally see items like strength attribute belts and charm attribute cloaks being circulated. Most mages wanted to get their hands on "Intelligence Headgear", and there were two ways to do so.

One way was to make it yourself, but this would require a lot of time and effort, and most people wouldn't have the expertise to do so. The other way was to apply for a quota at the Guild and then wait in line.

By getting "Intelligence Headgear", you could get additional spell slots and sell them for a service, and with this you could recoup your investment within a year or so. It was like the "car lottery" in big cities on Earth - you couldn't lose, you had to win.

Zhao Xu currently had a quota to purchase the "Intelligence Headgear" priced at 4000 gold coins, and if he added the "Silver Badge", he could directly upgrade to the "Intelligence Headgear" worth 16000 gold coins. However, after seeing the "Legendary Intelligence Headgear" of Annalise, he wasted his quota on a "Intelligence Headgear" with a lower attribute value, which made him feel a little unsatisfied.

So he was waiting for an opportunity and paying attention to market news. When he heard Mrs. Betty mention the discovery of a "+6 Intelligence Headgear", he became very interested. Once he obtained the "+6 Intelligence Headgear", his intelligence directly increased to 28 points, which was far ahead of any player who had not yet reached his level.
Even Arthur, without any special route, a high-level mage would be at this level.
