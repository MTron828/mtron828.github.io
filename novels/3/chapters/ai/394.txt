Chapter 395: Searing

As Zhao Xu saw the life energy attach to himself, this completely visualized behavior made him unable to resist the urge to "clear the monster" for the first time.

"I'm going in."

Zhao Xu deliberately stacked a high amount of close-range physical damage output, ultimately to kill those giant, monstrous scorpions one by one.

"Are you using magic?"

Saint Warrior Vivian had already raised her sword, preparing to perform a flying dash on these 14-layer-protected monsters. Someone might find them tricky, but she could basically finish them off with one strike.

However, as a former demon, she had not developed much expertise in close combat. The high-end skills were useless, and she could only use the "Orderly Slash" and "Strong Orderly Slash" to bully the weak. Naturally, her efficiency in clearing monsters was not high.

The small, low-level monster scorpions in front of him, which had probably gathered in a pit earlier, suddenly appeared together after being startled, were not worth Zhao Xu using his fireball spell to clear the area.

Why use a sledgehammer to kill a chicken?

Compared to the devil clan with fire resistance, the demon clan was born with 10 points of fire resistance and was familiar with the "fireball spell". Even after being taught by the renowned sorceress, they knew that high-level sorcerers could combine the fireball spell with various holy abilities to launch a burst that could break through fire resistance.

"Wrong," Zhao Xu said, then charged forward. However, his hand movements had not stopped.

As he looked at the enemy, the small, monstrous scorpions like a gushing spring also moved towards Zhao Xu.
Here is the translation:

The small creatures, which are over a meter long, are not slower than ordinary people in terms of speed. Zhao Xu relies on his perfect agility and is about to dive down towards the scorpions, and in an instant, he utters a mysterious incantation. As he finishes speaking, a cone-shaped blaze erupts from his hand, resembling a pesticide spray, and directly engulfs all the small variant scorpions within a range of five meters.

The intense heat wave instantly sweeps everything away, wrapping them in a layer of flames like a cloak. These unutterable variant scorpions can only emit a painful shrieking cry, struggling to roll around in the flames until they curl up like roasted shrimp.

Zhao Xu's simple ring spell has killed nearly a hundred small variant scorpions.

At this moment, not far from here, in a secluded corner of the valley, a small hill with loose soil has been quietly dug into, and a few pairs of eyes are poking out from within.

"This is the legendary fireball spell? It's so powerful? It's killed all these scorpions off the bat," says a player who is a wandering adventurer.

Initially, they were following the first pair of adventurers who entered the cave, snatched a treasure box, and startled the variant scorpions. They then parted ways at a fork in the path.

After all the commotion, these two players also managed to escape here, only to find that all the cave entrances are being guarded by variant scorpions. They can only burrow into the soil, waiting for the scorpions to disperse before returning to search for treasure.

Meanwhile, the warrior player known as "Big Brother" shakes his head, saying, "This is a one-ring burning hand technique I know."

"How is this possible?" the wandering adventurer suddenly exclaims, struggling to contain his voice.
Here is the translation of the text:

The wizard's ring of magic is no secret to the vast majority of players. It's like the colorful spray or the sleep spell that's barely passable. Everyone knows about them.

However, it's difficult for them to recognize the spell just by looking at a burning flame. This warrior player was barely able to identify it with the help of his previous wizard character's experience.

"What kind of damage is this?" the player exclaimed, having seen other 1st-level wizards cast the "Burning Hand" spell before.

The damage spell can be said to be a popular choice for new players in the early stages of the game. Many new players choose the "Burning Hand" spell as their initial free spell, while others choose "Magic Missile".

However, when it comes to actual combat, the 1-4 (1D4) damage of the "Burning Hand" spell leaves many players disappointed. Not to mention that this spell also allows for a reflex save, which reduces damage by half if successful.

As a low-level wizard, the difficulty of making a save is already low.

There was once a player who cast this spell at a chicken, resulting in a fiery inferno that only slightly singed the chicken's feathers before it flew away.

This example led to the "Burning Hand" spell being added to the player's blacklist.

Therefore, the warrior player was astonished.

"This spell's damage increases with the caster's level, 1-4 (1D4) per level. It's definitely a 5th-level wizard who can deal this kind of damage," the warrior player explained.

"I see, 5th-level wizards are so powerful that they can turn this spell into a miracle."
Here is the translation of the text:

The one-ring spell can only cause a range of 1-4 damage, which is really terrible, but causing 4-20 damage is a different story, as this amount of damage can even kill a group of civilians. However, the ranger suddenly reacted, "No, this is a 5-layer 1-4 damage stacking, and the average damage will tend to the central expected damage, but this mutated scorpion didn't escape, and it's too exaggerated!" The warrior player frowned, "It means that these mutated scorpions have no immunity to damage, and the damage is real. What kind of crazy mage is this, who is so terrifying? It should be above 5th level, grandma, I should have quit playing the game earlier."

"Ah, big brother, you can still play the mage now," the ranger player consoled, as the other player had given up on playing the mage due to its poor performance at the beginning, and was feeling a bit regretful.

But at this moment, Zhao Xu was looking at the small, type-B mutated scorpions that had fallen to the ground, emitting a faint burnt smell. He frowned, unspoken.

As an insect-like being, the spell that affects mental awareness naturally fails to work.

So he used the "Hand of Burning" one-ring spell, with his 28 intelligence, making the difficulty of evasion 20 levels high (10 + 1 ring + 9 intelligence).

This way, these stupid, reflexive mutated scorpions, unless they have a special talent, won't be able to dodge half the damage.

Unfortunately, the challenge level of each individual is only one-sixth level, and there are hundreds of them, which won't give Zhao Xu's life energy a significant amount.

He couldn't help but evaluate, whether clearing this nest would give him enough life energy to reach the 7th level.

But Zhao Xu thought for a moment and then decided not to be too greedy. Just then, ViVi flew over and glanced at the dead mutated scorpions on the ground.
Here is the translation of the text:

In reality, the power of these mutated scorpions is equivalent to a team of over 50 soldiers, and even the scouts from a small town with over 10 people would suffer heavy casualties if they encountered them. It's only when Zhao Xu's output reaches the level of being able to slap someone to death that he can resolve the situation with ease.

Even if Viola, who has a challenge level over 10, comes to handle it, she would still be attacked by the mutated scorpions and killed one by one.

"Let's go," Zhao Xu ordered.

"These mutated scorpions are too sensitive," he said with a hint of surprise.

"We're flying, but there's no pressure from the wings touching the ground, so how do they manage to sense it and gather their forces in an instant?"

Insects generally have the ability to sense vibrations, which allows them to locate the position of a living being when it touches the ground. This ability allows them to easily detect the position of an enemy, even without seeing them. This is why Zhao Xu's "Vibration Sense" spell can also help him achieve this effect.

However, Viola shook her head and raised her sharp sword, pointing it at a spot where the soil was not yet disturbed. "Those mutated scorpions are here to catch these two."

Zhao Xu finally realized that there were people below and spoke coldly, "Who is it?"

The people below seemed to think it was just a pretence and didn't respond at all.

Zhao Xu smiled slightly and aimed his sights at the spot where the soil was disturbed, taking a step back.

"Boom."
The instant sound of an explosion echoed.

"Ah, hero, it's me," the two people who were hiding in the soil suddenly crawled out.

The player warrior and the ranger both held up their hands in a gesture of innocence.
Here is the translation of the text:

Apart from the intimidating magic spells earlier, the two of them just stood there, staring at the stone in front of them, which was suddenly cut open by an invisible sword energy.

This kind of power instantly terrified the two of them. If they didn't come out and surrender, they would face the fate of being beheaded.

"You're a player who escaped from Lu City and joined the Northern Alliance?" Zhao Xu looked at the two of them, dressed in tattered clothing, and asked.

The adventurer had a small shortbow with limited arrows, and the warrior wore ordinary armor and carried a cheap big sword, which was far from the dual-handed giant sword worth 50 gold coins that a true warrior would wield. After four months of playing, their equipment was indeed very poor.

"Yes, yes, you're also an escaper, oh no, I mean a migrant," the warrior player, Bei Guo, asked.

"We're just making a mess," Zhao Xu said.

As he flew in the air, he couldn't help but think, "So, you're the adventurers who stole those variant scorpion treasure boxes?"

"Ah?" the warrior widened his eyes, unable to believe it, and was instantly exposed.

However, Zhao Xu didn't bother to explain, as the treasure box containing the power symbol and staff was now in his hand.
