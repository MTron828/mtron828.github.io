Chapter 158: Lecture on the Forum

Zhao Xu gazed at the mosquito net above his bed, still reeling from the experience of crossing the temporal river. He recalled shouting out the name of Ansenia and then losing consciousness, after which the game connection was disconnected.

This kind of situation usually occurs when players become extremely excited and their heart rate increases, causing the brain's image processing system to directly disconnect the game connection for the player's safety. Regardless of whether the player chooses to log out voluntarily or is forced to disconnect, there is a 20-minute delay before they can log back in.

Thinking about this, Zhao Xu couldn't help but remove his headset and turn around to climb down from the bed.

He had spent most of his time in the dark era, mainly traveling to the village and then to the Morlin Stone, and had only taken half a day. In reality, it was only just afternoon.

As it happened, the class didn't have any classes in the afternoon, so Zhang Qi and Chen Sannan returned to their dormitory and directly logged into the game.

On the other hand, Zhao Xu was the first to disconnect from the game. After 20 minutes, he naturally had to reconnect to the game. However, he didn't want to waste this rare 20-minute break. He simply opened his laptop and began to browse the latest forum posts on QQ.

As soon as he logged in, he noticed a message addressed to him in the QQ group and directly clicked on it, quickly scrolling through hundreds of posts beforehand.

In the past few days, he had been too busy rushing through the final chapter to eat or even browse the forum.
Here is the translation of the text:

The process of frequently using magic is extremely draining on his mental faculties, and basically, Zhao Xu has withdrawn from the game, always falling asleep as soon as he lies down.

Wang Congwei: Zhan Xia, your lecture notes have been circulated on the forum.

Esvekh: It's impressive, Wang Congwei and I thought at first that you were just pretending to be a lecturer to chase away that idiot.

Wang Congwei: I'm sorry, Zhan Xia, I caused trouble for you yesterday.

Wang Congwei: But that person is really strange, he disappeared for several days and didn't bother me again.

Esvekh: Hmph, if he still bothers Wang Congwei, I'll make him pay the price.

After that, Zhao Xu roughly glanced at the chat records and then stopped scrolling.

Zhao Xu directly opened the Arthur forum homepage and looked at the lecture notes Wang Congwei mentioned, wondering what was going on.

The words "On the diversity of primary magic" suddenly flashed before his eyes.

This post, from last night to now, has received tens of thousands of replies and has caused a hot topic, with the forum moderator bolding and highlighting it on the first page.

Zhao Xu had a bad feeling in his heart, but he still clicked on it.

The entire post consists of a series of images, or rather, a photocopied version of the lecture Zhao Xu gave that night.

Then, at the end of the post, the author left a supplementary comment.

"These photos were sent to me by a friend. The sender is an apprentice of a floating city mage, who accidentally entered a lecture room without a ticket that night and listened to a course that changed his perspective on magic."
Here is the translation of the text:

"I don't know how many times my friend had to replay the game to memorize and transcribe the 50-page lecture note in the game. But I think I should share it with everyone."

"I posted this without any particular thought, just hoping that those players who are about to give up on their magician profession might be encouraged to persevere. I don't believe that a profession with over a hundred spells at the basic level, each with complex structures and models, can be considered a worthless profession."

Zhao Xu immediately understood.

Although his lecture mainly focused on the diversity of basic spells, the scope of his sharing also included secondary expanded spells, and even went so far as to be unrestrained.

Of course, players cannot learn spell structures from his description and learn spells. However, Zhao Xu had already opened the door for them.

He let many players who had only touched on the 39 core basic spells know that there were many more basic spells in the world.

Many of these basic spells are extremely powerful, such as the "Painful Decree" spell mentioned by Zhao Xu.

Players who are solo must consider how to protect themselves in a certain amount of time. However, for a team, this spell is a blood-sucking skill.

Players in the Floating City can learn about expanded spells through some spellbooks and lectures. In other places, the training systems of magician associations and local magicians are independent.

Therefore, most magician players on the forum believe that they have completed the 39 basic spells and are satisfied. So the appearance of this post, combined with the detailed content, is like throwing a lead ball into a small pond, creating countless ripples.
Here is the translation of the text:

"I suddenly feel that my warrior account is not cool anymore, can I change my profession now?"

"The total level of first-tier spells is over a hundred, and the instructor who can write this lecture note probably mastered these spells. Is this not implying that there is a way to copy spells without spending a whole day?"

"You're thinking too much, don't use your gaming experience from a month ago to evaluate the accumulation of game characters over several decades."

"But there are posts that say that the instructor looks very young. Moreover, the atmosphere he gives off also seems like that of a player."

"Do you think there are players who can reach the level of mastering hundreds of spells? He can't even finish copying them in a year."

Zhou Xu looked at the post and then laughed and closed the tab.

Fortunately, players in the game cannot record videos, otherwise, he would definitely not have been able to hide his embarrassed face when he was recognized by Zhang Qi.

However, Zhou Xu was still impressed by that player who could copy his entire manuscript without a single mistake and bring it to the real world.

It's not difficult for players with exceptional memory like Eschw, but even with good memory, ordinary players would find it very laborious to do so.

Zhou Xu looked at the time and, before he could log on, he started reading the hot threads on the forum again.

"As a player of Mistral's Floating City, I'm very happy to finally be able to express myself on this forum once."

"You instructors are awesome, saying things that sound like you're saying them, and directly pulling out a 2nd-level mage to stroll around?"

Zhou Xu shook his head as he read the post, and the subsequent replies turned into a quarrel, with both sides repeatedly asking each other, going back and forth for dozens of times.
Zhao Xu has always looked down on this kind of behavior where people directly attack each other. Apart from having a temporary thrill, it lacks any real significance. He simply searched for "Floating City" as a keyword and also took a glance at the latest Floating City news.

Just as he finished searching, Zhao Xu's gaze was caught by a post that caught his attention.

"Hidden Reporters Expose the Truth of Floating City Players' Underground!"

"The author joined several Floating City player groups because of curiosity and once discussed a strange incident. A player in their power testing hall had killed a 20 HP skeleton with one arrow, while another player had defeated a 10 HP weak demon without any magic."

"Even if you're not a mage, everyone should understand how terrifying this kind of power is. I ask everyone, can we use a crossbow to achieve this ability?"

"A post combining a 22-minute recording of a spell scroll and today's lecture. I have reason to suspect that these are all from the same person."

After seeing the analysis of this post, Zhao Xu was a bit amazed.

He really didn't think that there would be a player who could connect all the facts in such a way.

However, when many inexplicable things happen, it's reasonable to suspect that multiple people are involved.

But instead of that, Zhao Xu thought that all these inexplicable things were caused by the same person.

However, after Zhao Xu opened the post, he found that it was very cold, as if this speculation had no persuasive power. Except for a few replies from the post's owner, who seemed to be fantasizing, the post was quickly buried.

Suddenly, Zhao Xu seemed to think of something and opened a new post: "The Mage's Path".

...Zhao Xu didn't log back into the game until 20 minutes had passed.
Here is the translation of the text:

After the data transmission was complete, he was suddenly afflicted with the aftereffects of the "Secondary Swift Explosion" spell, and fell into a state of dizziness.

Although Zhao Xu was unable to move, his heart still couldn't help but let out a sigh.

At least, he was standing in front of the gate of the floating city, surrounded by familiar towers of curse words, indicating that he had returned.

It wasn't until six seconds had passed since his dizzy spell that he recovered.

Zhao Xu rushed directly to the seventh floor where Anzhiya was located.

Meanwhile, the other party was standing there, as if he had expected him to come.

"Have you seen the Morlin Stone?" Anzhiya asked softly.

Zhao Xu nodded, "The stone is blank, and after I recited the name 'Mosszelin', a projection of a supernatural being appeared on it, which should be from the Elemental Plane of Fire."

"The other party called me a space-time traveler, shouting that I'm not from that era, and then sent down countless fireballs, trying to kill me directly."

"I activated the Secondary Swift Explosion spell on the spot, shouted out your name, and then returned to this moment."

Anzhiya listened to Zhao Xu's words and nodded.

"That's the case, then let's go somewhere with me."

"Where to?"

"To see the current Morlin Stone, but it has some content inscribed on it now."
