Chapter 386: Gathering

When Zhao Xu walked into the KTV, he saw a group of young men and women singing at the top of their lungs, as if they were trying to overpower each other. It seemed that this had become a way of singing.

He glanced around and discovered Nan Xiaoyu sitting among a group of girls, holding a microphone and singing. Zhao Xu felt a bit strange. This noisy environment felt like a debate rhythm.

He walked over to the group and sat down next to Nan Xiaoyu. Her friends, who had barely recognized him, didn't say a word. Zhao Xu sat down and leaned against Nan Xiaoyu.

Looking at the tea table filled with fruit juice and other drinks, he felt his anxiety ease slightly. His impression of Nan Xiaoyu was still very good, especially since she had passed away at a young age, making her image even more noble.

If she had gathered with her friends to drink before she was of age, he would definitely feel a pang of regret for her.

At this moment, he looked at the big screen in front of him and realized it was a replay of the Star Lake Battle, which he had published previously. For a moment, he couldn't help but reminisce about the previous battles, during which players had also had similar battles and launched attacks on towns controlled by evil lords.

Although they had failed most of the time, the first Star Lake Battle was precious.

A girl next to him asked, "Are you the older brother from next door who talks to Xiaoyu?"

Zhao Xu nodded silently, "Sort of?"

"How many levels have you reached?"
Here is the translation of the text:

"Third-level," Zhao Xū hesitated for a moment and gave an answer that impressed everyone.

The fourth-level is basically the top-tier players, the crème de la crème.

As for the third-level, it's already considered high-level among players, and no one is exempt from being a top-tier player in various large-scale guilds. They are also the team leaders of various teams.

"Wow, is this true?" The women around Zhao Xū suddenly became excited.

The proximity of cities in the game means that Zhao Xū can bring them along to level up.

However, the proximity of cities in reality does not mean the same in the game, and there are spatial distortions.

It's no wonder that high-level players are so enthusiastic, as the outside world is in chaos, and there's always a chance of sudden death.

As the first killer among players, the goblin tribe has an endless supply of player blood, and their breeding speed far surpasses that of players. This has led to a direct feud between goblins and players, with no end in sight.

"What profession do you play, little brother?" a woman who was slightly more mature asked Zhao Xū.

"Warlock," Zhao Xū replied, and everyone's attention was immediately drawn to him.

Although warlocks have not yet made a significant impact on the player community, with the rise of "Dong Chengli" and "Starlight Refraction" among the top 10 high-level players, many players have begun to realize the key to the game.

"Wizards" are considered late-game, while "clerics" are early-game late-game.

These two points have gradually become a consensus among players, and are considered absolute internal information.
Here is the translation of the text:

This is also the reason why Nan Xiaoyi posted a bunch of posts on the East City forum, making Zhao Xu pretend to be a wizard, and the key is to save face.

"Wow, although it's not even half a month ago, but it's still hard to get a 3-star wizard," a girl who usually has a general relationship with Nan Xiaoyi couldn't help but mock.

This sentence also suddenly made everyone's eyes converge.

Other 3-star professions are okay, but wizards can get 3-star, which is a rare existence.

At this time, Nan Xiaoyi had already handed the microphone to someone else and let someone else continue the conversation.

"Ha, you don't know what I'm talking about, my brother is from Mistral, can you imagine that?"

Nan Xiaoyi had unconsciously created an identity for Zhao Xu.

Zhao Xu also smiled wryly at this time, and it was no wonder that he received a map of Mistral yesterday.

Since high-level wizards in the game have all been associated with Mistral, as well as various urban legends that are terrifying.

This has also made the city of magic in the hearts of players incredibly prestigious.

Some players even chose to play as wizards, but after discovering their birthplace was not Mistral, they directly deleted their accounts and spent 399 yuan to start over, only to find that they were out of luck.

"Oh, your brother is also from Mistral, Xiaoyi, and you're also a 3-star player, it's possible that you know each other," a girl said, trying to stir up trouble.

Whether it's low-level or even high-level players, they all establish cliques, and a group of people cling together for warmth.

This has also made many low-level players feel resentful and determined to work hard to level up and squeeze into the cliques of high-level players.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Oh, my brother said that he often goes to the Double-Edged Poetry Material Shop on Road Three Street to buy magic materials, and he said that high-end players all like to go there because it's affordable and convenient. Do you like it too?" Little La asked with a hint of mystery.

Zhaoxu smiled lightly. He had already noticed that Nan Xiaoyu was trying to subtly wink at him, trying to imply that something was fishy.

Nan Xiaoyu didn't expect that Little La would jump over the rationality and directly set a trap, asking: "Is it because you've been to that shop?"

At this moment, she couldn't help but want to use lip language to hint to Zhaoxu that there was no such shop. Because Little La had used the same question to expose another pretentious person on the forum.

Whenever people want to show off, many people who lack confidence will unconsciously create a strong identity for themselves.

"Oh, I usually just buy random things, I haven't gone to that shop," Zhaoxu unexpectedly gave a vague answer. He had a vague impression that the things sold on that street were all low-quality.

"Oh, which shop is it?" Little La continued to ask, seeing that the other party hadn't fallen into the trap.

"I don't remember very well," Zhaoxu wrinkled his brow, recollecting. He had indeed gone there too little, and at that time, he hadn't truly obtained intelligence enhancement, so his impression was shallow.

Just as he said this, the gazes of the other girls around him, who had been looking at him with respect, suddenly lost a few degrees of respect.

"Oh, I thought the Magic Association would send you," Little La laughed out loud.

"Yes, it will be sent now," Zhaoxu thought back to the benefits of a 5th-level mage.

"However, I mostly spend most of my time in Floating City, and rarely come down to the ground, so if you ask someone else, they might remember," Zhaoxu simply answered.

Floating City.

A word filled with mysterious magical powers, suddenly made everyone silent."
Here is the translation of the text:

Xiao La took a deep breath, "Oh, oh, I forgot that you all are from Floating City's training program. And you must know Sister Qing Wei, isn't she a big shot in Floating City?"

At this moment, Nan Xiaoyu's face turned pale.

She hadn't thought that she had overlooked another high-end female player, Wang Qingwei, who didn't conceal her identity and had interacted with players frequently. This feeling, like a gentle spring breeze, had won the appreciation and admiration of many players.

However, this reality made it even harder for Zhao Xu to arrange things.

"Of course, I know her," Zhao Xu said, taking out his phone.

"I just had a private chat with her yesterday," Zhao Xu said, but then quickly put his phone away, recalling Wang Qingwei's last sentence, which was "Please bring it".
