Chapter 702: The Lord of the Abyss

As Zhao Xu gazed at the giant bull demon whose power had increased to an unimaginable degree, he couldn't help but feel a sense of satisfaction, as if he was looking at a prized pig he had raised himself, preparing to slaughter it for the New Year.

Seventy-odd points of power, a feat even rare in the world of Arthur. He also learned, belatedly, that the legendary creature "Living Fissure" he had encountered in the cave of the flesh-eating demon was, in fact, a mythological creature modified by Emperor Ernest, with a strength of 80 points, equivalent to the legendary foundation version.

It was no wonder that the Living Fissure had pressed him against the wall, making him, a "strongman" with 50 points of strength, feel powerless.

They were 30 points weaker than him, just like he would bully a warrior with 20 points of strength.

It was an exaggeration to say he would be crushed.

At this moment, the giant bull demon with 76 points of strength was also like that.

Zhao Xu didn't dwell on it anymore, and instead, he directly took out the "Tome of Extraction" written by Anzhiya, a precautionary measure, and handed it to the five-ring "Extraction Rite" scroll.

It's not that Zhao Xu was not fierce enough; he just couldn't execute this spell on his own.

The main reason was that he was cheating a bit too much.

The "Extraction Rite" stipulated that a 4th-level mage could transfer 1 point of strength property.
Therefore, a 20th-level mage could transfer 5 points of strength, and even Zhao Xu, who had piled up to 33 levels, could only transfer 8 points of strength at most.
Thus, he instantly turned to the "Tome of Extraction" written by Anzhiya, containing the 80th-level "Extraction Rite" scrolls.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu, a 10th-level mage, used the "Domain of Decline" to roll out a snowball with a peak level of 37. Meanwhile, Anzhi Noya, over 30 years old, rolled out a snowball with a peak level of 80+. These mages all have a bright future ahead.

They achieved this by relying on this thing, which just barely covers the 20-point power scale. The level of the mage is the limit to the "Extraction Ritual".

Generally, mages who find a demonic artifact with attribute explosion don't have the endurance to transfer so many attributes. Of course, the "life energy" and "money" required for the ritual are also expensive, and it's not worth it compared to buying a magic item that enhances attributes.

So, this "Extraction Ritual" is essentially a way for Zhao Xu to save on "equipment slots".

Additionally, it can even exceed the +12 legendary magic item limit!

Instantly, Zhao Xu unfolded the scroll and directly activated two massive magic arrays between him and the giant bull demon.

As Zhao Xu chanted the incantation, the giant bull demon began to reveal a shocked expression.

However, at this moment, it was frozen in place, as if it had no constraints or abilities.

It could only stare at its surroundings with a look of extreme terror.

This giant bull demon, which had already reached super-giant size, needed a large amount of living creatures to eat each meal and could easily conquer cities and destroy camps. For the first time, it felt its own insignificance.

Or, it could be said that the mysterious place gave it a crushing sense of pressure, even more terrifying than facing the lord of the underworld.

With Anzhi Noya's scroll, Zhao Xu didn't need to worry about his spells being dispelled by the opponent.

Of course, he didn't need to consider backup plans for his spells.
Here is the translation of the text:

If some mages are unable to master the extraction ritual, they can give up some items to obtain exemptions and upgrades. For example, by offering a evil demon's tracking service, one can gain +1 exemption. Through sensing with the eyes and ears, one can gain +3. By establishing a mental connection with the recipient, one can gain +5. The most extreme option is to use a daily telepathic hint, which can grant +7 exemptions.

From Zhao Xu's perspective, all of these are worthless and will eventually be vomited back up, and he will have to repay the evil demon. A pure and unadulterated black misty essence began to seep out of the giant bull demon's body and slowly spread throughout Zhao Xu's body, forming a conduit. As the essence flowed, the giant bull demon's body began to weaken.

On the other hand, Zhao Xu was thrilled to see his strength value increase. 54, 55, 56... it jumped all the way to 69, reaching an unprecedented level.

If Arthur were to categorize attributes into a superhuman level or divine level, 60 would be a decent intermediate level. It's no wonder that strength is the easiest to increase among the six attributes, and it's indeed very fast and efficient.

Zhao Xu also knew that Arthur had many ways to replace other attributes with strength. For example, strength can replace a mage's spellcasting attribute, which means relying on strength to cast spells. Similarly, strength can replace agility for defense, or charm for other purposes.

This is equivalent to concentrating all resources on one or two attributes to maximize efficiency.
Here is the translation of the text:

In the end, the giant demon was completely drained of its 16 points of power and seemed to wilt like a withered flower, collapsing onto the ground.

"Alright, let's undo all the effects of the abilities this giant demon just gained," Zhao Xushun added.

Instantly, the wish-granting spell came with a +6 internal boost, and the legendary power belt added a +12 enhancement boost...

Each item disappeared from the giant demon's body, and its attributes were directly reduced to rock-bottom levels.

At this point, Zhao Xushun couldn't help but sigh.

The bug-like effect of this "extraction ritual" would spread like wildfire, making it a fatal flaw that would bring doom to those who possessed it.

Aside from the six major attributes, the dozens of skills that followed could be transferred permanently through this method.

This was more lasting than the daily buff spells, and it would be Zhao Xushun's only path forward.

This time, he had only come to the Abyss with Anzhi to extract properties from six demons.

In the future, he would have to come back to the Abyss to extract skills from dozens more demons.

"Let's send this giant demon away," Zhao Xushun said.

But then, the giant demon suddenly turned into a foamy substance, slowly seeping into the dark and barren ground.

It was as if it had never existed in the first place.

This giant demon was dead.

Or rather, it was the first time the prayer land had disobeyed his will, not sending it away but killing it on the spot.

Meanwhile, Zhao Xushun didn't even sense the slightest demonic stench.
Here is the translation of the text:

What's more critical is that he has witnessed a sufficient number of demon deaths during this period.

After they die, the bodies disappear in various ways. Zhao Xu has basically counted and recorded them all.

Some corpses decompose instantly after death, emitting a foul odor that makes people feel queasy. The bones are left behind, but they crumble at the slightest touch.

Or, the demon's skeletal remains might break free from the flesh and walk three steps before turning to dust.

The corpse of the "cow demon" he just caught is also a rare type, disappearing without any special effects, just like a regular corpse from the material plane.

This is the reason why they can research the essence of the corpses.

There has never been a case like this giant cow demon.

It's as if it's just garbage collection.

"It's dead?" Zhao Xu asked, not continuing with his brush attribute plan.

"No, it has returned to the depths of the Abyss," the cold voice of the Wish Land replied.

"But didn't I say it's being sent away?" Zhao Xu emphasized, his eyes growing stern.

"This is the way the Wish Land sends things away," the voice remained cold.

Indeed.

It's a bit too much.

The remaining five brush attribute methods don't dare to continue.

Zhao Xu stopped his previous actions and began to gaze warily at this dark and unseeable void.

There is no physical presence if you can't adapt to this claustrophobic space. You'll go crazy in less than a day or two.

But Zhao Xu, who lacks nothing, has the most patience.

"Can you tell me the reason?" Zhao Xu asked.

The Wish Land's magic is considered the most unrestricted, but also the most restricted.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

In ancient times, the art of wishing had no taboos, and its power was determined by the ability of the wizard. However, this led to many problems, including the destabilization of the entire universe and the collapse of magical webs. Even two wizards who wished for the same thing at the same time could have different outcomes. In some cases, the same wizard could cast two identical wishes in a row, only to have them both go awry.

In this context, "wishing" is both a delicious cake that can bring extraordinary benefits and a ticking time bomb. Without the blessing of the gods, even the most skilled wizards could not guarantee the success of their wishes. Each time a wizard cast a wish, it was like playing a high-stakes game with their life.

As a result, the goddess of magic issued a decree, establishing guidelines for the safe use of wishing. Any wishes that exceeded these guidelines were not guaranteed to be fulfilled. The goddess's divine power had already circumscribed these guidelines, preventing them from being distorted by the will of the world.

Other excessive wishes would be distorted by the will of the world. Moreover, the more detailed and restrictive the wording of a wish, the more likely it was to be misinterpreted. On the other hand, vague and ambiguous wishes were more likely to be ignored.

In this sense, the recent behavior of the wishing realm was clearly an attempt to "distort" Zhao's wishes. He wanted to send the other party away from this region.
Here is the translation of the text:

"That giant ox demon's "send-off" is actually sending it to death. It also includes another point. He wants to "send himself off" and may encounter the same situation?

"Can I ask, which layer of the abyss is this?" Zhao Xu has become cautious and no longer has his previous carefree attitude.

"This is your wish, is it?" Suddenly, this prayer site did not give a direct answer, but instead asked Zhao Xu a question, taking the conversation in a roundabout way.

Zhao Xu's forehead broke out in a cold sweat. The other party was not directly telling him that he was ready, oh, I'm about to start twisting your words.

The word "yes" was pressed down Zhao Xu's stomach like a punch.

After having an intention, even the most cunning people can be cunning.

In an instant, Zhao Xu's mind flashed with insight.

He directly said, "I want to summon Lakshmi in front of me."

Appearing in front of him is a very conservative choice, but the other party can interpret which "Lakshmi" it is.

However, through this method, Zhao Xu can gradually narrow down the scope and clarify the ability boundary of this prayer site.

Enough information is what a mage needs to stage a performance.

However, this prayer site suddenly burst out with a loud noise, as if there were countless clouds in the sky, and a thunderstorm was raging, exploding the void.

After a long time, a sentence finally came.

"I'm sorry, this wish cannot be fulfilled."
"Why?" Zhao Xu immediately blurted out, not caring about the risks he might encounter.

Because this answer is completely beyond his expectations.

This prayer site, which can interpret and fulfill, did not do so?"
Here is the translation of the text:

However, in just a few seconds, a mysterious place enveloped Zhao Xu, shrouded in a haze that was difficult to discern.

"Because the opponent has not yet condensed from the depths of the abyss."

Huh?

Unfathomable.

From the depths of the abyss.

Condensed out!

As a "Laksis" who has lost his memory, is he also a part of the abyss by nature?

Slowly, Zhao Xu's ears began to resonate with the ancient melody that he had once heard, as if it was etched on ancient stone tablets that only the oldest tomes mentioned.

Gently, Zhao Xu began to listen.

This mysterious melody was telling the history of the abyss's appearance, including the transition of different evil demon species, how the initial Obis demon became the current Tanith demon lord of the abyss.

No.

As the melody progressed, a series of secrets passed down from ancient times in the abyss began to explode in Zhao Xu's ear.

He even felt that he had heard these things, and wondered if he could leave the abyss alive.

Big brother.

He had come to the abyss to level up his attributes and take a look around to see if he could find Laksis and bring him back home.

He had no intention of getting involved in the abyss's messy affairs.

It wasn't that Tanith was controlling the abyss.

Rather, the abyss had chosen Tanith.

This is what the melody was telling him.

Moreover, it also told him that the development process of the abyss was behind the scenes, with countless factors that seemed like evil demons straining and striving.

The tracks of the abyss's will were behind the scenes.

Including why the fourth layer of the abyss appeared.

Including the origins of many abyss lords.

Including the one who was not converted into Tanith by the spirit god Coriolanus.

Rather, she was exiled and voluntarily swore allegiance to the abyss, and eventually obtained the opportunity to be favored.
Here is the translation:

"In other words, what is this game of depths ultimately for?
In the end, Zhao Xu's face gradually turned cold and indifferent.
He gazed at this land of prayer and asked,
"What is it for this time?"
"For the Lord of Depths."
