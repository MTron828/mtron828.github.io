Chapter 422: The Golden Ball

Arthur's monsters, in strict terms, consist of 15 species.

They are classified into strange beasts, animals, magical beasts, dragons, spiritual beings, giants, humanoid monsters, mud-born monsters, extraterrestrial beings, plants, undead beings, insect-like beings, and elemental beings.

Elemental beings, in addition to having common dark vision, also share the same soul and body as extraterrestrial beings. When they die, they will not release their souls.

They are also immune to toxins, magical sleep, paralysis, and concussion. Moreover, they will not be affected by attacks.

Zhao Xu and Wei Wei then gathered the two small elemental beings and directly chose to kill them with their weapons.

Although killing these small elemental beings does not pose any difficulty, Zhao Xu and Wei Wei still spent some thought on how to complete the task within one round.

Especially, if they failed to kill the elemental beings and let them escape, it was likely that eight elemental beings would reappear.

In that case, they would need to consider killing eight elemental beings simultaneously, which would be much more difficult.

Zhao Xu relied on his magical powers to dare to rush in.

However, traditional fireball magic would not be effective in this scenario, as fire elements are naturally immune to fire damage. On the other hand, water elements would receive additional half damage from fire.

In the end, Zhao Xu killed the small earth element that could escape with its burrowing ability first, and then knocked down the remaining fire elements one by one, successfully completing the task.

The two experienced fighters did not make any mistakes, and soon saw the originally closed stone door slowly rising in front of them.

Slowly, the two of them also noticed a larger stone chamber on the other side of the stone door, with a space nearly several times larger than their side.

"Let's go," Zhao Xu said.

Just as he spoke, his eyes narrowed slightly, but his tone remained calm, "Wait, this stone door will automatically lower itself. Yesterday, a team didn't make it through in time, and after the door closed, they were trapped inside."

According to the forum, the team behind them waited for the new team to arrive, and then reopened the door, but the mistake of the few rooms behind them led to their deaths at the hands of the multiplying elemental creatures.

"Good," Vivia looked at Zhao Xu's hands, nodding her head with emphasis.

As they slowly walked through the stone door together, Zhao Xu suddenly pulled Vivia's hand.

He activated his "transmission boots" on his feet, and the two of them teleported to about 7-8 meters away, right below another stone door on the other side.

In an instant, the position they were originally in was filled with the sound of arrows hitting the ground, followed by a loud roar, and a heavy axe came crashing down, hitting the stone floor with a dull thud.

Thanks to his teleportation ability, Zhao Xu, with a cold gaze, watched the ten or so hunters who had just emerged from the shadows on both sides of the stone chamber, preparing to launch a fatal attack on them.

"It seems you're really going all out," Zhao Xu sneered.

It was clear that this group of people had already entered the stone chamber before them, and after hearing them approaching, they had hidden in the corners of the walls and waited for them.
Zhao Xuan noticed that the two archers reloaded their arrows while relying on the wall, and the four elemental summoning vessels in the corner of the room were all intact, yet no new elements appeared. He had already figured it out.

These ten people had cleared the four mid-level elements in this stone room. However, it was clear that they had not passed through the stone door, and after the stone door closed, they would no longer be able to pass through. The only way was for Zhao Xuan to open the stone door again, using the unopened stone door that he had just passed through.

At this moment, the stone door he had just passed through slowly began to close, accompanied by a "ding-dong" sound, foreshadowing that the room would soon become a death trap.

"So, do you think it's better to control us, half-dead and half-alive?" Zhao Xuan asked, his palm hovering over the stone door.

The warrior player opposite him, the squad leader, hastily raised his hand and said, "Wait a minute, friend, I think there's been a misunderstanding."

As Zhao Xuan's hand hovered over the stone door, the squad leader's heart began to beat faster as he looked at Zhao Xuan's actions. If Zhao Xuan pressed down, it would mean that the four mid-level elements would soon appear, and they could indeed suppress the four mid-level elements and complete the task together.

However, with Zhao Xuan's two extra people, everything would be different. They could easily disrupt the rhythm of the scene, and even directly kill one of the elements, then refresh and kill another one, resulting in 16 elements. In that case, the squad where the warrior was stationed would have no meaning even if they successfully killed these two extra people.

The 16, 32, or even more mid-level elements would tear them apart.

"I know you're trapped here, waiting for us to open the new four elements."
Zhao Xu looked at the team in front of him and said, "It's basically a typical combination of warriors, rangers, and rovers. With the addition of a poet, their team's physical output is impressive, which is why they were so confident in their attacks from the start."

"Just a misunderstanding," the team leader on the other side held up his hands as if to prove his innocence and slowly walked towards the front. The adventurers behind him also put down their weapons, no longer aiming their arrows at them. Even the wild man carrying a giant axe quietly put away his axe, as if nothing had happened.

"So what do you mean now?" Zhao Xu asked with interest.

"It's like this," the team leader said with a smile. "We thought there was a monster attacking us, so we prepared for battle. Since we're all humans, let's sit down and talk."

He looked at Zhao Xu's back, "After all, the difficulty of this artifact is extremely high. If we work together and strive to obtain it, sharing it would be a great choice."

The warrior gazed at Zhao Xu's entire body, as if trying to guess which piece of equipment he was using. He then jumped over 20 meters in an instant, dodging all their attacks.

"But I think we have no need to cooperate," Zhao Xu said.

In reality, it was indeed the case.

"No, no, no," the team leader directly waved his hand and opened his chest, pulling out a chain with several golden balls from inside.

"I'll give you a pure gold ball as a token of my sincerity," he said, plucking off a yellow golden ball.

Even before Zhao Xu could respond, the team leader hurled the golden ball towards Zhao Xu's back with force.
