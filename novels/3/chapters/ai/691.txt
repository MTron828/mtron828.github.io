Chapter 692: The Rescue Vocabulary That Can Explain Everything

Generally speaking, the complex curse towers that are not easily created at will are extremely complicated in terms of craftsmanship and architecture.

After years of experience transmission, several outstanding curse towers have emerged, such as the "Tomb Tower" that is specifically placed in the depths of the tomb, loading four-seven rings of priestly divine laws, expulsion spells, gray smoke dispersion, and 7-level monster summoning spells, designed to kill anyone who dares to intrude.

The "Holy Forest Tower" specifically designed to protect the forest loads five-ring Druidic magic, five-level summoning of natural allies, stone skin, animal metamorphosis, and summoning thunderstorm, which essentially summons an animal first and then enhances it through the last two spells, finally adding a thunderstorm to suppress the scene, allowing for a comeback even if hit multiple times.

The "Treasure Room Tower" set up by a wizard for their own private territory loads four-ring wizardry, confusion spells, assassin's charm, fear spells, and ice storm, with the goal of blocking and suppressing the opponent before the owner returns, making it convenient for subsequent intelligence investigation.

However, most Mistral magic apprentices have encountered the "Wizard's Guild Tower" that directly loads nine-ring wizardry - absorption spells, meteor explosion, true word spells: death, and binding spells.

The meteor explosion is mainly designed to create a massive light effect to attract attention, while the other three spells are unable to kill, weaken, or bind the opponent, but instead launch an attack.

In short, these towers are all based on the specific purposes and carefully selected spells of their own.
Here is the translation of the text:

So, they played a crucial role in their designated areas, but also exposed their vulnerabilities. For example, if the entire forest was filled with such towers, as long as one was prepared with some defensive measures and lightning-resistant spells, it would be easy to counterattack.

However, the current situation is completely unpredictable and chaotic, making it impossible to pinpoint a specific target. It's like a storm of magic, and no matter what, it's hard to come up with a solution.

Even if he used the "Anti-Magic Field" spell, which is said to be able to neutralize magic, it would still be difficult to solve the current problem.

Not to mention that the physical entities created by the "Flying Sand and Rolling Stones" spell could not be contained within the Anti-Magic Field, let alone the "Great Split" spell, which could destroy the Anti-Magic Field in an instant.

The "Caster's Split" spell has a 1% chance to destroy an Anti-Magic Field with each casting.

In an instant, Zhao Xu's face turned pale.

As the hundreds of nine-ring spells rained down, even if he used various physical barriers to block the split, they would still be easily destroyed by other spells.

This meant that he would be caught off guard by the "Caster's Split" spell.

At that moment, all magical items became useless.

It was as if he had lost millions of gold coins.

Zhao Xu's eyes were filled with a hint of despair as he gazed at the situation.

The "Caster's Split" spell was a force that ignored resistance, so no matter how many spells he stacked up, he couldn't counter it.

Even the most skilled warriors would be afraid of a knife.

Zhao Xu finally realized the true power of a nine-ring mage.

In the instant that ten or so nine-ring mages cast the "Caster's Split" spell at the same time, even a legendary mage would be filled with fear or regret for the rest of their life.

What to do?

Zhao Xu continued to think, and his hand movements didn't stop.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

The Five-Ring Stone Wall Technique!
From the nearby wall, a stone wall extends out, although it is only about one finger's width thick, yet it forms various complex shapes according to Zhao Xu's will, appearing to block out the sun and sky.

The Four-Ring Salt Wall Technique!
The crystal salt walls that shine brightly continue to spread out from the wall, even connecting with the just-formed stone wall.

The Four-Ring Sand Wall Technique!
The Four-Ring Water Wall Technique!
The Five-Ring Magma Wall!
The Four-Ring Dragon Scale Wall!
And so on, regardless of whether they are effective or not, these spells in the Zhao Xu's arsenal can create tangible entities that will not be destroyed by the anti-magic field. In Zhao Xu's hands, these walls emerge one by one.

For a moment, the entire room, roughly the size of a basketball court, seems to become a labyrinthine layout.

However, after testing, Zhao Xu realizes that the impact of these one- to five-ring techniques is quite intense, directly destroying many wall surfaces.

Considering that the six-ring technique can cause massive destruction, he becomes even more headaches.

As he sees the countless spells flashing outside, Zhao Xu's heart is filled with anxiety.

At this moment, he is also thinking of a plan to counterattack.

Unfortunately, he cannot yet cast the six-ring technique, otherwise, the anti-magic field will be infinite and overlapping.

Without it, he still has the possibility of success by using the iron will to suppress the anti-magic field and then casting another anti-magic field. If combined with the twin-born, it would be equivalent to four anti-magic fields, making the mage's disintegration technique quite durable.

At that time, he only needs to focus his mind to resist the non-magical fragments.
Here is the translation of the text:

Clearly, the idea of stacking up barriers to counter curses is not a new concept, but he's just too extreme, with no margin for error.

In the end, it's just that he doesn't have enough counter-curse scrolls. If he had a thousand scrolls, what's there to fear about the hundred-odd magical cannons?

As for now, I've given up.

Zhao Xuan lowered his head and glanced at his thigh pocket.

It's time to seek help from the outside.

As for seeking help, the "Wind Information" in the second ring uses the wind to transmit information to a designated location. However, it's impossible to use it in this sealed room.

The "Mind Link" in the fifth ring, although it can maintain inner communication regardless of distance, requires a close-range spellcasting, which is also blocked.

The best choice left is the fifth-ring wizard's "Short Message" spell!

As long as the recipient is familiar with the spell and has an IQ of more than 1, they can understand the content of the short message. Moreover, it can even transmit information across planes!

Using a fifth-ring spell, he sent out the message: "Master! Help! I'm trapped in a location suspected to be Ernest's secret hideout!"
Zhao Xuan immediately cast the spell, and the magic energy carried the message out, soaring into the sky.

【Adventurer Summer, your "Short Message" spell is involved in sensitive keywords and has failed to send.】
Huh?
Really blocked the communication?
Impossible!

Zhao Xuan was taken aback.

But he quickly regained his composure and mentally reconstructed the entire spell model in his mind.

If the "Short Message" spell can be easily blocked, then it's really too tyrannical.

At this moment, he was also thinking about the entire response plan.
As the external curse tower rose to the thirteenth barrier, Zhao Xu lay on the ground, meticulously analyzing why the "short message technique" was being blocked. Alternatively, he wondered what was being blocked.

He seemed like an electrician searching for a short circuit in his home, constantly scrutinizing the diagram.

In the past, most situations were caused by another spell being suppressed, so he didn't need to delve deeper into the rules. However, looking at the dynamic bar, he realized this wasn't as simple as he thought.

As time ticked away, Zhao Xu's inner thoughts were increasingly tormented. His rational mind told him to give up and find another method, but the cost of silence was unbearable. However, his pride as a mage urged him to persevere, insisting that this was the correct action for a mage.

He was like a student on the verge of solving a difficult math problem, using old methods to struggle through, but still, the light of hope remained elusive, and the countdown continued to accelerate.

But if he gave up, it would mean abandoning all his previous efforts and starting from scratch. How could he bear that thought?

Zhao Xu's determination grew, and he discarded all distractions, focusing solely on analyzing the reasons behind the spell's failure.

In his mind, he rapidly searched for relevant background knowledge, every few seconds. Finally, just as the third-layer curse tower was about to reach its climax, Zhao Xu stood up abruptly.

He shook his head with a bitter smile.

Unexpectedly, this secret room had loaded a key word filter.

In the vast sea of spells, the "activation" didn't target individual spells but directly monitored the entire communication chain. The contents of the "library" included things like "rescue" and "treasure," which were likely crucial.
Here is the translation of the text:

So, the "short message" method has already been blocked.

However, Zhao Xu has observed a small loophole.

The three-ring art, the secret language of sand.

This art of magic allows Zhao Xu to describe the identity of the living being that hopes to communicate with him in his mind, and then he can speak, waiting for the other party to respond.

This communication method, because it uses sand as a carrier, has a certain possibility of leakage, allowing him to leak out the first word.

However, he doesn't need to say much, as this is probably his only chance.

He can only transmit a single "word" to Anniya.

What word should he use to make Anniya understand his predicament?

And how can he make her guess where he is now?

Especially, the treasures in the sensitive library, such as SOS, cannot be used.

Not even the basic filtering rules can pass through. Zhao Xu doesn't believe that there is no single common word in the vast "sensitive library" against him.

This means that the word Zhao Xu has chosen must be safe enough to avoid detection by the entire "sensitive library".

As he thought this, he furrowed his brow, looking at the third round of incantation tower approaching the final two waves.

It also means that the next moment, when the four-ring art arrives, he will be too busy to care about anything else.

What is more restrictive than not telling someone where the "danger zone" is.

The suspense has been drawn to the edge of the cliff, and everyone will naturally stop at the edge of the cliff, even some of whom will have to perform a few tricks and show off their driving skills, acting as an old driver from Mount Tai.

Even if you know you can take a few more steps without harm, you will still feel reluctant to take the risk!

The problem is that time is running out.
Here is the translation of the text:

He must hurry and come up with a crucial word to tell Anniya about his current situation! Zhao Xu gazed around, but his heart was filled with uncertainty.

He looked around and suddenly saw a strange-looking wall, which was what he had just created with his stone wall technique, but it was already broken down by the spell.

This sudden sight made Zhao Xu recall a previous moment.

He immediately knelt down, grabbed the sand that he had just condensed with the "Sand Wall Technique" and shouted, "Sister!"

As soon as he shouted, even before his first word had fully come out, the remaining half was already blocked by monitoring and the sand in his hand lost its ability to flow onto the ground.

Finally, the three-ring curse cannon completed its historical mission and slowly turned around, retreating back into the wall.

In the vacuum, the sound of congratulations and the arrival of the fourth ring continued.

However, Zhao Xu had already relaxed, looking at the many slowly emerging dragon heads of the curse cannon with a carefree expression.

At the same time, the curse cannon was slowly condensing its magical energy.

As the spell was about to be condensed and shot at him, Anniya's figure still hadn't appeared.

Zhao Xu finally sensed something was off.

Was he really being intercepted?

Can Anniya really not react in time?

Zhao Xu couldn't help but mutter to himself in his heart.

This is definitely a very obvious hint, isn't it? Zhao Xu shouted in his heart.

He couldn't help but laugh.

Cursed drive-off! Black tendrils! Force sphere! Confusion spell! Blizzard! Curse! Weakness spell! Plague spell!
Here is the translation of the text:

Through his secret vision, he had already seen a familiar Ring of Four familiar companions.

He usually used these to crush his enemies, making them suffer greatly.

But now, it's different.

Finally, the dragon-shaped magical cannon on the five walls surrounding the underground chamber erupted simultaneously, producing a thunderous boom like the naval battle of a thousand ships, as if the heavens themselves were thundering!

The entire army was stunned, and even the mighty generals turned pale when faced with this magical bombardment, and they chose to flee, dodging the sharp edge!

Zhao Xu's field of vision was suddenly plunged into a dazzling light.

"You're really bold," a voice said.

"Or are you just kidding? You still have six Ring of Reverse Magic scrolls on your body, oh."

At this moment, a soft and charming voice echoed, and the elegant figure of Anniya Noel appeared before Zhao Xu.

"Adventurer Zhong Xia, you are affected by the 'Reverse Magic' effect of the six-ring magic, and you are unable to cast magic, magical abilities, or supernatural abilities."

"Steel Heart Power!"

Zhao Xu instinctively unleashed this ability, and he was immediately freed from Anniya Noel's magical suppression.

As Zhao Xu's expression turned pale with shock, Anniya Noel, wearing a yellowish-brown robe, asked softly, "Are you sure I will definitely appear?"

Zhao Xu, recovering his composure, raised an eyebrow and said, "I called you 'sister' at the entrance to the lost treasure of the Ister, remember?"

"I think you can recall it, don't you? If I can find myself in another hidden place, it's not difficult."

"Ah," Anniya Noel slightly tilted her head, "You're quite clever."

At this moment, she hummed a soft melody.
