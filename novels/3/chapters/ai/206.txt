Chapter 207: The Land of Divine Punishment

Since Zhao Xu ascended to the legendary library of Mistral, he has been spending most of his nights there. In the room of the inn, he would follow the method taught by the spirit of the library, taking the holy water and scattering six drops at each corner of the bed. Then, he would take out a custom-made quilt from his backpack, which had ritual arrays drawn on both sides. After that, Zhao Xu would put a thin mint-flavored candy in his mouth, lean his head against three borrowed magical tomes, and sniff the faint scent of paper and ink wafting from the incense burner at the foot of the bed. He would then lie down on the bed and slowly fall asleep.

When Zhao Xu woke up, he had completed the ritual, and his soul had drifted to the legendary library of Mistral.

The "holy water" used in the ritual was scarce, mainly consisting of the specially designed thin mint-flavored candies, which could stimulate his brain's spiritual energy. Zhao Xu had only a few dozen pieces left in his hand, each piece equivalent to a ticket to the "legendary library" that allowed his soul to transmit. The ritual array on the quilt could be reused, but he had to recharge his spiritual energy every seven or eight times and record it by hand using special materials.

Therefore, each time Zhao Xu visited the legendary library, it was a costly affair. It wasn't until he had acquired the high-level magic spell that he could reach the library with just one spell.

Recently, Zhao Xu came to the library, where the girl-like Dilo was constantly pacing back and forth, taking down the magical tomes and wiping them clean, singing a tune with an air of satisfaction, as if one spell could solve everything.
Here is the translation of the text:

"It seems you're very happy?" Luo Duo asked, holding a book titled "War of Giant Dragons" and about to put it away. However, when she saw Zhao Xu's expression, she couldn't help but ask.

"No," Zhao Xu replied, walking calmly to a bookshelf he had not finished browsing earlier.

"It's just that I unintentionally sowed a seed and found that it has blossomed. Of course, I'm looking forward to it growing stronger," he said.

Initially, Zhao Xu didn't think about publishing another post after his first one on the forum. In his mind, he leaned towards allowing players to trade experience for revival stones.

He repeated this thousands of times, but it was better to die once.

This is the hard truth of Arthur, and Zhao Xu's post was just an education for some clever and ingenious people. Most of them would not fall into the trap.

However, he didn't expect that just a few posts would make him a revered figure like Lu Ci.

Before, Zhao Xu was clear that most people who admired him had ulterior motives, and they were trying to get more information from him.

However, Lu Ci was someone Zhao Xu considered knew him well, and she was not the type to pretend to be friends with someone to get ahead.

This meant that she simply appreciated Zhao Xu's sharing of a few posts.

This gave Zhao Xu a sense of satisfaction, as if his efforts had not been in vain.

After all, in this world, there were too many people who pretended to be friends and then stabbed each other in the back.

As someone who had handled several inheritance cases in the past, Zhao Xu had a deeper understanding of this.

Moreover, he needed a channel to influence Lu Ci.

This way, he could ensure that Lu Ci could play a role in the upcoming "Collapse of Star Lake" battle and reduce the accumulation of time.

Additionally, he could help Zhang Qi escape from that deadly whirlpool.
"Hey, Zhongxia, why don't you continue reading that book 'Transmission Ceremony'?"
Lu Duo saw that Zhao Xu actually put the book back on the shelf, and couldn't help but be curious. In theory, it would take at least four or five days for the other party to finish reading that magic book.
This was also the manifestation period she had set for the other party.
Zhao Xu was able to take out books from the "Legendary Library" in the Arthurian material plane.
It was by pleasing Lu Duo that he obtained the permission to manifest the magic book, allowing him to read in the Arthurian world as well.
Basically, after his soul returned and woke up, the books he chose to borrow would appear next to him, and once the deadline was reached, they would automatically disappear.
According to Lu Duo's request, Zhao Xu could borrow a maximum of three books each time. If they were not due, he still had to sleep with those books in the ceremony, bring them back, and form a destruction.
So Lu Duo was very curious as to why Zhao Xu had suddenly given up on those three books.
One of them was a book about high-level demons, which the other party had specially come to borrow last night.
Her gaze followed Zhao Xu's figure and landed on a bookshelf, finally resting on the book Zhao Xu was reaching for.
She immediately became angry and said, "Hey, hey, Zhongxia, you're cheating. How can you come and look up the answers before the test?"
"The affairs of scholars cannot be called cheating."
Zhao Xu responded casually to Lu Duo's question, taking down the book "Detailed Description of the Top 100 Arthurian Subordinate Semi-Plane Secrets," which was as thick as two fists.
After these days of getting along, he had already understood that the short and sturdy Lu Duo was someone with a tough exterior and a soft heart, and wouldn't really confront him.
The backbone of the floating city's mage class, those who serve as researchers and mentors, are mostly eager to queue up for the "Carrion Beast Pit" in the semi-plane secret realm. The free expertise that comes with it is definitely a great deal. Even with the abilities of a mage, at level 20, they only receive 4 super magic expertise, with a long wait of 5 levels in between each. However, when they accumulate enough merit to queue up, they will find that the only information available about the target is the simple name of "Carrion Beast Pit." Even this may not be the correct reference. The semi-plane can reward those who successfully challenge it with the expertise "Iron Will," which is enough to drive people crazy. This has made it a secret, with all information being blocked by the floating city. It will not be recorded in writing and even memories will slowly fade. Zhao Xu, at this moment, is reading the book "Detailed Description of the Semi-Plane Secret Realm" and feeling deeply moved by this secret. No wonder he had never heard of such a magical existence in his past life. This is because the secret itself is influenced by magic, attempting to erase it from human minds. It's not that the semi-plane holds great value or hidden treasures, but rather its characteristic - "nothing lasts more than five." If more than five people enter, the semi-plane itself will be disturbed and lose its power for a year or more. In order to prevent mages from hearing its legend and inadvertently causing the realm to lose its power, Mysteria took measures to cover up the truth of the semi-plane using the power of legendary spells. Ultimately, the forces that know of the existence of the semi-plane also receive a quota for entry every year.
Upon seeing this hint of only five, Zhao Xu also understood why only three people were allowed to enter at a time, leaving one spot for the rescue workers who went in. This semi-plane was almost beyond the control of the floating city. It was the kind of place where people could die. Or rather, if the floating city dared to intervene, the participants would naturally not receive a true trial, and thus would be unable to awaken their true abilities. Thinking of this, Zhao Xu couldn't help but sigh. After Lux came out of the temple, she fell into a deep sleep and would need at least a week to recover from the exhaustion of the battle with the "Abyssal Demon" in the "Deep Prison." He was still unable to lend a hand for the time being. He continued to squat and read the details about the semi-plane. This was also the reason why Lux had just accused him of sneaking away early. In the absence of access to the inside information of the semi-plane, Zhao Xu used his privileges to access information in the "Legendary Library." However, Zhao Xu had too many things to do. Next, he had to find the "third notebook," pay attention to the "Battle of the Falling Star Lake," and search for the relics brought back by the ancestor Andy. As a bronze-level time manager, he had to compress the adventure time in the "Carrion Beast Cave." But even so, he was much more comfortable than the novice mages, most of whom were still diligently interpreting and transcribing spells. Suddenly, Zhao Xu realized that the latter half of the scriptures was directly missing, and couldn't help but look at Lux, suspecting her of foul play. "Don't look at me," Lux said contemptuously, turning her head away. "You've already reached the limit there." Hearing this, Zhao Xu closed the book in his hand. After all, he had obtained the basic information, and at least it wasn't a waste to spend a special mint tablet to get here.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu didn't even think about arguing with Luo Duo. He was clear that this was a selection test for Wang Qingwei and Eiswich, but not for him. The association hoped he would obtain the "steel will" specialty smoothly. However, Anzino and Ray didn't tell him the details of the pit. It was known that Ray had planned to deceive him in the mysterious forest before, but was interrupted by a mysterious external force. Now, even Luo Duo was stopping him from seeing more. This showed that knowing the details of the "carnivorous beast pit" was unfavorable to his awakening. This point also made Zhao Xu constantly increase his alertness to that half-dimensional space. Whether it was the description of death risks recorded in the beginning of the classic, or the fact that the association seemed to be unable to exert too much power on that half-dimensional space, all of these could show that that half-dimensional space was not as simple as it seemed. "Summer solstice, I'll give you a hint." At this moment, Luo Duo seemed to veil the subsequent text, a bit afraid of Zhao Xu getting angry with her, and also felt a bit guilty, hurriedly explaining: "That was the 'place of punishment' before the god of death became a god." "Kong---" [Adventurer Summer, you touched the "secret of the gods", and fell into a state of deafness for 3 rounds (18 seconds)]. Suddenly, the world fell into silence.
