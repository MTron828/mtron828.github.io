Chapter 255: The Light of Heaven

"Is that a four-star mage?" The besieged player couldn't help but shout out in surprise.

"Just his wings?" someone quickly responded.

"Let's fly then?" another player chimed in.

"That's a three-ring spell, though," someone else pointed out.

Just as this question was being raised, it was drowned out by the cheers of the people behind.

Initially, everyone had given up hope and had accepted their fate, but thanks to Cradle's encouragement, they had decided to make a desperate last-ditch effort to turn the tide of battle.

No one could have anticipated the sudden turn of events, the feeling of being pulled back from the brink of death, and the joy that came with it.

Not even Zhao Xu had expected that his appearance alone would give the remaining players such confidence.

At this moment, Zhao Xu's feet were suspended in mid-air, but he seemed to be standing firmly on the ground. He then kicked off with a slight force, propelling himself forward like a bullet.

Although most of the heavy cavalry hadn't noticed Zhao Xu's movements, they discovered that the first wave of cavalry had fallen. However, they continued to charge forward, holding their long spears and forming a battle array.

Zhao Xu, wielding a massive scythe, charged straight into the spear array without hesitation.

At this moment, his entire body burst forth with a golden glow, as if he were wearing golden armor and charging into battle like a warrior.

"How is this possible?" Zhao Xu's figure moved so quickly that it was impossible to capture, leaving the players who were paying attention to him wondering.
Here is the translation of the text:

"A 'Meng Pu' ability? How is that possible?" exclaimed a druid player who had touched many animals and was familiar with this ability.

"Cast a blessing spell, but what kind of spell is it, directly acquiring a monster's unique ability?" another player asked.

"Maybe it's a two-ring spell that's a bit crazy?" someone replied.

As the topic's center, Zhao Xu suddenly closed the distance between the two, but unfortunately, he couldn't unleash the combo skill at this moment.

However, he didn't hesitate, and with the blessing of "Original Instinct" and "Premonition" spells, his reaction speed was unmatched among everyone present, allowing him to strike first.

Unless someone else used the "Quick Burst" skill, no one could block Zhao Xu's initial strike.

As Zhao Xu's massive scythe swung out, filled with killing intent, it was just like before, unable to be blocked by the death attack.

He, who struck first, would only need to worry about the counterattack from others if he successfully killed his opponent.

This was the advantage of being the first to strike.

Let alone the full-body armor, even if these knights were wearing hundreds of layers of heavy armor, including legendary armor, none could withstand the effect of Zhao Xu's "Gui Ji" skill.

Zhao Xu's scythe directly struck the heavy-armed knights, causing a fatal blow that ended their lives on the spot.

At the same time, the flames on Zhao Xu's hand also burst forth, shooting flames in all directions, as if the scythe had struck an iron plate.

The knights who were close by, still stabbing each other with their long spears, failed to notice this point.

Suddenly, the flames on the scythe exploded, producing a burst of intense light and a torrent of flames that engulfed the group of black-armored knights.

It was a five-ring spell, "Star Impact"!"
The player, who was originally affected by the pyromancy flame magic, finally had the damage spread to the Starfall Knights guarding the city.

They were immediately engulfed by the flames, similar to a fireball spell, and suffered immense pain, collapsing to the ground. The long spears in their hands also fell to the ground.

The original horses were directly incinerated, with intense heat seeping into their bodies, making their bodies like charred wood.

Just one strike cleared a circle in front of Zhao Xu.

"Ahh---" A guard infantryman, who had been charging towards Zhao Xu, was unable to bear this terrifying scene and burst into tears on the spot.

In his eyes, those invincible heavy cavalrymen were suddenly killed by the flames unleashed by a single strike.

The black armor showed no signs of damage, but the seams of the armor were continuously emitting white smoke, making it easy to imagine the terrible injuries the cavalrymen had suffered.

"Just now, was that fireball magic?" Zhang Qi looked at the scene before him, unable to help but exclaim.

He had been staring fixedly at the scene and didn't even notice the 4th-grade mage's spellcasting action.

The giant scythe then erupted with terrifying flames, directly incinerating many cavalrymen gathered together.

There was no one who could survive the scene, leaving only a sea of charred corpses.

The original player who had suffered this scene suddenly found themselves on the opposite side of the cavalrymen, giving Zhang Qi a sense of temporal dislocation.

"It's not fireball magic, but the weapon's explosion. But I've never heard of this spell," Pastor Feng Ge said with a hint of surprise.

"Could it be that my own weapon has been empowered? Wouldn't that have this effect?"

"Or is it the opponent's weapon's power?"
Here is the translation of the text:

At this moment, everyone's gaze was fixed on Zhao Xu's hand, mesmerized by the massive scythe in his grasp. If each swing could unleash a fireball technique, that would be a truly formidable artifact.

Just as Zhang Qi was saying that, his gaze was drawn to Zhao Xu's subsequent actions.

One charge was equivalent to one massacre.

Even the massive scythe could unleash a "Follow the Flow" technique, and the surrounding cavalry would be swept away like chaff. Zhang Qi had seen this "Follow the Flow" technique in the Warrior's Association's training hall.

However, the condition for unleashing this technique was to completely defeat the enemy, and the condition was extremely strict. Unless they were facing a straw man, Zhang Qi would be unable to unleash it.

Moreover, he could only do it once, unlike the eye-catching six or seven swings of the current Zhao Xu, which was reminiscent of the legendary "Great Follow the Flow" technique.

This was a specialty of warriors, but how did the current four-level mage have such a specialty? Moreover, this specialty was conditional on having "Mighty Attack" as a complementary specialty.

Most human players currently only had two specialty slots.

Zhang Qi almost thought that the person flying low over the front lines was actually a high-level warrior.

"Rakshasa, this efficiency is too low," Zhao Xu waved his hand, and his massive scythe had already broken through the encirclement.

After opening a gap for the recently besieged people, his front line stretched further and further.

Wherever he went, he was like Death itself, slowly clearing a path. The players he had rescued recognized his identity from his scythe and robe, and they began to scream at Zhao Xu on the spot.

For them, Zhao Xu's current state was a beacon of hope.

However, Zhao Xu knew that he couldn't keep this up for much longer, as the enemy's gaze was already fixed on him.
Here is the translation of the text:

As soon as they attracted a high-end force to finish off the enemy, the enemy's abilities beyond 4th grade would be exposed. "Ah, master, close-range attacks have always been like this. Even if you're stronger by a second, you can only strike a few times and kill a few people. If you want to launch a group attack, the enemy needs to come close to you," Lark said in summary.

"In reality, stacking close-range attacks in magic is to counter some special situations, so it's aimed at high single-target damage output. At that time, it's not strange for you to deal over a thousand damage in one round, master."

"One swipe can kill a ancient dragon, and two slashes can kill a Titan elder - that's what we need to do."

"Now that we're dealing with these 10-20 health points of cavalry guards, it's only natural to feel bored."

"Well, you're almost synchronized now," Zhao Xu continued to ask.

After Lark woke up, the "giant scythe" seemed like a new toy to her.

She advised Zhao Xu to let her synchronize to a certain extent and then directly absorb the giant scythe. In this way, she could replace the giant scythe's functions and directly communicate with the teleportation portal. Even if Zhao Xu had any requests in the future, she could directly transmit them to the "half-plane" through her.

"Come on, master, use this scythe to harvest another wave, and then we'll switch to a cleric identity and directly cast a purification spell to clear the battlefield," Lark exclaimed in Zhao Xu's mind.

Zhao Xu also laughed at this, as the battlefield in front of him was actually quite traditional, with at most a group of winter wolves lurking to ambush players. The heavy cavalry and infantry guards were surrounding the battlefield, followed by archers on the arrow towers and the final wave of bowmen.
Here is the translation of the text:

But Zhao Xū knew that the mine owners had not yet revealed their trump cards, and the solitary level 5 winter wolves were not even counted. He didn't reveal his strategic moves on the forum, fearing that it would scare off many players directly. Because that was the enemy he would face alone in the end.

After taking a deep breath, Zhao Xū raised his massive scythe again and charged at the enemy.

His appearance was like a stone thrown into a pool, causing waves, but it couldn't change the situation on the battlefield in front of Star Lake. Players were still decreasing in number.

Even players who had revived from Winter City and further towns couldn't organize themselves quickly.

One of the wanderers pulled out the poisoned arrow stuck in his chest and said, "How are we supposed to play this?" His face had turned completely blue, showing that the poison had already entered his body.

The level 1 priests didn't have any spells to remove the poison, and even the "Healing Light" spell had been exhausted.

The wanderer complained, "I just got here half an hour ago and I have to go back to revive again. How do we fight?"

The players around him could only wipe the blood and sweat from their faces and hold up their shields to resist the new wave of arrows.

Just as they had organized a team of over a hundred brave warriors, the local commander noticed them and sent a team of archers to launch a fierce barrage of arrows at them.

Thousands of arrows flew through the air, tracing perfect arcs before piercing deep into the already burnt and charred earth.

They also pierced the bodies of the brave warriors.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Holding my curved sword, I'm seeking revenge." The wanderer's physical properties had dropped again, and the warrior who had just lost his weapon was hastily handed the sword.

"Kill a few more for me, revenge!" The wanderer exclaimed, his mouth spitting out blood non-stop, unable to stop.

At this moment, the warrior glanced back at him, saw the wanderer's pitiful state, and his eyes turned red, about to swear an oath to the other party.

However, the warrior was suddenly knocked to the ground several meters away.

A longbow arrow pierced his heart!

The arrow, over a meter long, directly penetrated the warrior's body, killing him instantly. The armor on his body, densely stacked together, was torn apart, creating a large opening. The wound took the other party away.

The players, who had already suffered heavy losses, found it difficult to withstand the increasingly powerful weapons.

The wanderer looked on in dismay, sighing deeply.

This scene was one he had seen too many times.

When a small town could deploy the "city-bow" unique to the Northern Alliance army, which could only be fired by a catapult, it was possible that the other party's back was not just a group of wealthy gold mine owners.

At this moment, the sounds of battle and the whizzing of arrows filled the air.

As the companions around him fell one by one, the wanderer dropped his shield, raised his giant sword, and charged forward, trying to exchange his life for theirs.

However, the warrior didn't even take seven or eight steps before being struck and killed by a poison arrow that pierced through his armor, falling to the ground in front of the Birth God's Temple.

The wanderer, who had lost too much physical property, was no longer able to move.
Here is the translation of the text:

He was consumed by an intense hatred towards himself, and he had to wait another day to return here and exact his revenge.

Another day, he would finally be able to use his own teeth and his own dagger to tear apart these enemies.

If they could revive directly here, he wouldn't need to be so passive.

But these were just his fantasies.

"Lying on the ground waiting to die is not a good habit, and even if I do make it back to the main team, I'm not sure I'll be able to survive," he thought to himself.

At this moment, a strange voice broke through the wanderer's thoughts. He was astonished, his eyes, already hazy from poisoning, widening in surprise.

A man in a priest's robes, with a holy symbol in his hand, suddenly appeared in front of him.

"What kind of joke is this?" the wanderer laughed helplessly, thinking that the priest must have mistaken something.

He should be holding up a shield, not a holy symbol, or he would be shot by arrows.

The wanderer thought to himself: unfortunately, arrows won't change direction just because of your faith.

But before he could complain, another wave of arrows came.

One of the arrows, straight and true, was heading straight for the priest's forehead.

However, the next thing that happened was beyond the wanderer's imagination.

The arrow stopped just short of the priest's forehead, no more than a punch's distance away, and then suddenly changed direction and flew back in the opposite direction!

"This is the Three-Ring Spell 'Reverse Arrow', which can deflect arrows back," the man explained to the wanderer, as if he had read his astonishment.

Immediately afterwards, a "Healing Spell" was infused into the wanderer's body, also cleansing the poison from his body.
Here is the translation of the text:

The wanderer's ecstatic expression suddenly turned gloomy as he saw another player being killed. He was overcome with grief again. It was easy to save one person, but the pastor couldn't save everyone. The players were only level 1 and needed to hold their breath and strike with all their might to fight. They needed five resurrection stones to win this battle. Unfortunately, the battlefield was not near Winter City, and the distance had become the strongest barrier for the town. The wanderer couldn't help but sigh again.

However, he noticed the pastor and raised his "Holy Emblem" as if to do something. The pastor looked at the battlefield, his eyes filled with sadness and nostalgia. He whispered softly: "The glory of the Goddess should descend upon this place."

The originally blue sky was suddenly illuminated by a divine light column, as if the heavenly kingdom had slightly parted its curtain to scatter the light of hope. The heavenly chorus of angels resonated in the battlefield.

The holy light of the heavenly kingdom shone brightly on the battlefield, attracting the attention of countless people. Immediately, a faint "Temple of the Goddess" projection appeared in the air.

【Regional Prompt: The "Temple of the Goddess" has appeared in Star Lake, and players can directly resurrect at this location.]
