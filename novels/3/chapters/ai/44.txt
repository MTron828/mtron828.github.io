Chapter 45: Preparing for Divine Magic

He silently sighed at the unfairness of it all. He estimated that this kid didn't even know the layout of the inner chambers. The entire Mistral, with its numerous families of mages and old aristocratic clans, was hidden within. These powerful individuals had countless relatives and in-laws, making their relationships even more complex. Moreover, there were countless branches of relatives from outside who had come to join the family.

In order to maintain family influence, it was natural to cultivate one's own children to become mages. The path of mages was a test of innate talent, but clergy were more focused on God's will. Even ordinary people couldn't change God's perspective. You couldn't pray and praise your own relatives during prayer, hoping God would grant them a 1st-level clergy position.

Only on this sacred day could the family's true abilities be displayed, making it easy to insert people into key positions. The Goddess of Magic could hear the thoughts of her devotees, but on this day, when she descended upon the temple, all the novice clergy who appeared around her would naturally attract more attention.

Some people would say that it was only fair to give them a chance to advance their ranks. However, it just so happened that Zhao Xu stood at the entrance and directly received divine magic. Even if he didn't put in any effort, he could still become a clergyman through devotion. Who could argue with that?

But at this moment, it was clear that the Goddess of Magic had descended, and she was judging his suitability. She not only granted him divine magic but also made it impossible for those who had failed to advance in the inner chambers to feel a sense of inferiority. Rayan also didn't expect that this calm and composed young man would run into such a situation.

"This matter, don't mention it, just keep it to yourself for now. You can start training first and then reveal your newfound powers to them on the last day. After registering, you can leave."

Zhao Xu didn't expect this advice and simply nodded his head.

Zhao Xu had been fighting in Arthus for nine years and wasn't going to waste his time. His foundation was in the final scroll, and the other party naturally didn't want him to attract too much attention in the church.

At least, he didn't want to get entangled with these low-level pastors too much.

Then, Lei An went to communicate with the middle-aged pastor and arranged Zhao Xu's next move.

After their conversation, Zhao Xu followed Lei An to be led to the inner zone by the pastor.

In the end, Zhao Xu was allocated a new dormitory and a schedule by the church's arrangement.

Although the schedule was written densely, it was actually quite clear upon closer inspection.

Every day, he would attend a morning meeting for unified prayer, then study religious scriptures until noon, eat lunch, and then receive corresponding pastor training in the afternoon according to his own needs.

As for his dormitory, it was a single room with a very small area, so fat people might not be able to turn around.

The room's decorations were also very simple, except for a bed and a wooden table.

After completing the handover procedures, Lei An pointed out the location of the wizard association in the papal palace to Zhao Xu.

From then on, Lei An couldn't be with Zhao Xu 24/7.

So, he could only visit the location when Zhao Xu had a request, and the other party would naturally notify Lei An.

After completing these tasks, Lei An also left with the middle-aged pastor.

This day was not just about the descent of divine consciousness, but also had many celebratory rituals.

As the liaison officer, Lei An had to coordinate the arrival process of personnel from the wizard association.

In the end, the room was left empty with only Zhao Xu.

For the rest of the day until evening, the church wouldn't have any training sessions for the festive season. Zhao Xunyi sat on the bed, took out a religious book from the wall cabinet, and began to flip through it. However, after just half a minute, he put it back without even reading it thoroughly. These religious books were not only wordy but also cryptic, making it hard for him to understand.

Zhao Xunyi could only wonder how others managed to digest this kind of content. He then decided to dive back into his own spiritual practices. He didn't want to show off his abilities to others, but he could still use them privately.

The only thing that bothered him was that the clergy generally had fixed prayer times. The divine also issued spiritual abilities at these times. If a priest wanted to change the time, he would have to consult with the divine and get special permission.

In the past, countless people on Earth had tried to verify or even judge the existence of Arthur using their earthly knowledge. Ultimately, they all gave up and accepted that Arthur was not part of the original universe. Instead, it was a separate dimensional system.

Therefore, in Arthur's dimensional system, every place was synchronized, and everyone could see the vast expanse of the horizon as the sun rose and set. In the past, Zhao Xunyi had also struggled to accept this dimensional perspective. He then sat cross-legged, began to meditate, and tried to acquire spiritual abilities.

Just after flipping through the religious book, Zhao Xunyi had a basic grasp of the prayer formula. Luckily, spiritual abilities didn't require 8 hours of rest. Gradually, Zhao Xunyi began to notice that some sparks of light appeared in his mind. The character information in the spiritual technique manual also began to stir, as if it was about to transform from gray to radiant.

During the period of Zhao Xu's contemplation, the image of the magic goddess gradually took shape in his mind. The facial features, down to the smallest details, were meticulously constructed. The gods' appearances, as depicted in Arthurian legend, were rendered in a somewhat vague manner. The stone carvings had reached a level of resemblance to the gods. At that time, Zhao Xu sat on the throne of secret law and was summoned back to the Long River of History, where he saw a pre-god Xisilvina who was unrecognizable. If he had become a god, he would not have guessed that he was being lured by a demon's direction, even with his eyes closed.

Zhao Xu had also become one of the few who truly knew the goddess's true form. However, just as the goddess's appearance was taking shape in his mind, it suddenly dispersed into countless star points that scattered everywhere.

Zhao Xu immediately saw that numerous floating light balls had appeared in his mind, formed from the star points. He focused his attention on them and saw that they were concrete descriptions of divine spells. These light balls represented individual divine spells that he could choose from.

The bottom row, being the zero-level divine spells, and the upper row, being the larger one-level divine spells, were displayed. Zhao Xu roughly counted them and found that there were 12 zero-level divine spells and 25 one-level divine spells.

Compared to the way wizards learn spells by copying one by one, divine spells are many and are directly presented by the gods, listing all the spells you can choose from. This allowed him to suddenly have 37 options. Even though he could only prepare five or six divine spells at present. Some divine spells were similar to arcane spells, such as the zero-level detection spell, which had both arcane and divine versions.
Here is the translation of the text:

However, there are some spells that only exist in the divine version, and mages are unable to learn them. Zhao Xu was still unaware of this.

Not all 9th-level mages can cast the "Revival of the Dead" divine spell, which is a 5th-level divine spell.

There are 12 zero-level, 25 first-level spells, which is the standard set. There are more than 25 first-level spells, and some are extended spells.

It's just like his first-level teleportation spell, which is not a standard spell and cannot be learned without a special channel.

For most 1st-level mages, it is rare for them to exceed the 25 first-level spell range in the early stages. Even if they can provide 10 spells for selection, it is considered a qualified performance. Only by slowly gaining divine favor can they obtain more spell options.

Only the most devout 1st-level mages will be able to list all 25 first-level spells.
