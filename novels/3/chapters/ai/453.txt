Chapter 454: Invitation

"Divine Disintegration!" 

As soon as this clear and cold voice was heard, Zhao Xu seemed to see the mysterious man's face turn pale.

However, at the same moment, the snowflakes on the ground behind the man also rose up.

There was no wind, and the snowflakes scattered and condensed slowly, as if someone had stepped on them, forming a white "barrier".

However, the position of the snow wall was unusual, not between the two of them, but exactly behind the mysterious man.

"It's me," said Anzhi Noya, feeling the magic inside her wear off, before the mysterious man touched his forehead, where a cold sweat had formed.

Zhao Xu only began to carefully examine the other person at this time.

This mysterious man looked to be around Zhao Xu's age, with a handsome face that seemed to be smiling with spring in his eyes.

He was wearing an extravagant robe embroidered with pearls, with buttons made of dragon scales. He looked like a noble from the top of the social hierarchy.

Zhao Xu even didn't need to think about it, and he could sense the familiar air around him.

He could also infer that the other person's background was definitely related to one of the major powers, and just by looking at the man's Eastern face, Zhao Xu had a preliminary judgment in his heart.

"You're okay, what are you doing here to cause trouble?" Anzhi Noya's clear and cold voice came from behind the curtain.

"Not for nothing, I just came from Mistral and found out you were no longer there, so I guessed your schedule and coincidentally met you here," the noble man smiled warmly, bowing respectfully. "Respected Miss Anzhi Noya."

It seems they know each other.

Zhao Xu shook his head to himself.

But he still found it a bit strange. If they had known each other, why did An Ti Nuo Ya just use the "Splitting Technique" to attack him, releasing a spell that could wipe out his entire fortune?

This close-range spell had a range similar to the Fireball technique, bursting out from a central point and covering a larger area.

It was clear that An Ti Nuo Ya did this to avoid affecting Zhao Xu, who was wearing a set of armor worth tens of millions of gold coins. So she directly dropped the spell behind him, covering an area with a radius of 12 meters that just covered him and did not affect their horse-drawn carriage.

Luckily, the man reacted quickly and immediately used the terrain to his advantage, just like Zhao Xu had done to resist the nine-ring mage. He instinctively blocked the spell with a wall.

On the other hand, the opponent also used his body to shape a "snow wall" to block the incoming spell.

Otherwise, Zhao Xu wouldn't be able to maintain his composed smile.

Zhao Xu even guessed that An Ti Nuo Ya must have used the spell according to the opponent's "countermeasures" and "disengagement" strategies, and that this was the only way to get a glimmer of life.

"When you helped our family, I will never forget," the man said, trying to create a sense of camaraderie between the two parties.

"Hmph, three hundred years ago, I told you that helping you found the nation was just a one-time deal. I won't intervene in the power struggles between the Arthurian dynasty again," An Ti Nuo Ya's tone became cold.

Founding?

Zhao Xu's mind turned quickly.

Indeed.

The Eastern Empire!

The Qin Empire.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

Although "Wangshi" has no connection to the Qin Dynasty on Earth, it's just that their names and pronunciation are similar. However, after they crossed over, they found that there was still a "Dongfang Guodu" (Eastern Country) existing, and they still had a strong sense of affection towards it. Even in this world filled with mythology, they continued to use the names they had on Earth, and didn't give themselves new local names. The ID from the previous game also continued to be used as a codename.

Zhao Xu remembered that An Niya had said that she had participated in the founding of the "Dongtu Empire" (Eastern Country Empire), which was a powerful empire that had eliminated hundreds of clans and established a unified nation. She also obtained the secret of the "Ji Jian System" from the other party, but she couldn't disclose it to outsiders due to her oath.

Zhao Xu's heart was also ignited.

The Ji Jian System could be said to be the current warrior system, with only a few people able to achieve it. Although the number of people who could achieve it was small, those who did were able to make a name for themselves and were feared by others. These people were also the foundation of the Dongtu Empire's long-lasting prosperity.

However, what role was the man in front of him? Especially, the prefix he introduced himself with - "Legendary Mage".

At this moment, the tall and lean man in front of him seemed to have noticed Zhao Xu's astonished expression, and he continued to speak with an unchanged smile: "This young brother's self-introduction was interrupted, please allow me to continue."

"My name is Ying Er Gou."

Er Gou? It was as if the Chinese name corresponding to the Korean name appeared in Zhao Xu's mind, which was a somewhat unusual name.
Here is the translation of the text:

As the vice president of the association, he, who was from the East Land, was nicknamed "Furious Wind" due to his name being easy to understand.

"It's really strange, isn't it? This is the trouble of being born into a noble family - every name you choose will be subject to arrangement," said Legendary Mage Yin Zong.

Zhao Xu just smiled and nodded, pretending to understand.

"When I was studying in Mistral, I was in the same situation as you. I was fortunate to have met Miss Anniya. However, later on, there were some issues with my family, and I had to interrupt my research in Mistral and return to participate in the founding of the Thirteen Clans. If you went to our capital city that day, the statue standing in front of the palace is me," said Yin Zong.

Hearing this, Zhao Xu's eyes almost popped out.

Because he had indeed been to the capital city of the East Land Empire.

A thousand years ago, the Thirteen Clans jointly founded the East Land Empire, and the Winning Clan was crowned as the shared emperor, becoming the royal family. The other 12 clans jointly governed the empire, and this continued to the present day.

The Winning Clan was able to rise to prominence, not only due to their own strength, but also because of their connection to the legendary mage.

A legendary mage who was from the Winning Clan, but whose true identity was unknown to everyone.

This person was someone who could take the strong at their word and engage in unlimited sneak attacks.

Meanwhile, the opponent's greatest defense was to keep their identity secret, and they had managed to keep it hidden even from the ordinary citizens of the East Land Empire.

Zhao Xu had finally understood that Lei An's words were just a show. As for the "noble" in front of him, he was none other than the legendary "War Strategist" or "Shadowy Figure" that people on the forum were talking about.
It seems that Anziano hasn't stopped boasting about me in front of you, and I can see the kind of admiration in your eyes. Wujing noticed Zhao Xu's delay and suddenly burst into a satisfied laugh, causing his clothing to shine with flashes.

Zhao Xu didn't refute this. Because the man in front of him, Anziano, had heard enough rumors about him. The person in front of him was someone who had partnered with the goddess of magic to go on an adventure, belonging to the most dangerous group of legendary mages in the world. Even Zhao Xu began to doubt whether the exchange he saw between the two was really as simple as a "one-attack-one-defense" collision.

"Cut the chatter, Wujing," Anziano said impatiently. "On average, you have to bother me once every 100 years. I'm warning you, if you come to disturb me again before the next era, today's greeting won't be just the 'Maledicta' spell. You can bet on it. I've mastered the legendary version of the 'Maledicta' spell. You can set up seven layers of 'Star Boundary Projection' to block my brute force."

After Anziano's "threat", Wujing's face seemed to stiffen. However, he quickly recovered and said with a grin: "Actually, this time I'm not here to see Miss Anziano, but the Eastern Empire is going to prepare a comprehensive academy in the future."

"It's like Mistral, the city of magic, has the strongest magic academy in Arthur. We're aiming for a comprehensive academy this time, and since we can't compare to other Arthur's academies in terms of professionalism, we'll focus on overall development. If you come, you can complete the corresponding vocational training here."
Here is the translation of the text:

"When the time comes, we will invite the heirs of various powerful forces, including royal princes and numerous lords, to join our school. In addition to providing professional training and cultural education, we will also disseminate the secrets of the Nine Swords to those who are destined to receive it.

The legendary mage, Yi Du, looked at them with a mysterious gleam in his eyes, his gaze fixed on them. Meanwhile, Zhao Xu was also shaken to his core.

He couldn't have expected that the prestigious "Starlight Academy", which was known throughout the entire continent and was impossible for even the most influential merchants and aristocrats to gain entry to, would suddenly unveil its true face before him.

As a legendary mage, even if the academy was massive in size, it was still just a trivial matter. However, the fact that it was going to absorb the heirs of most of the powerful forces in the continent, including those of the second and third line of succession, was a feat that was nothing short of astonishing.

It meant that the heirs of the powerful forces in the continent would gather at the academy before the future, and it was precisely because of this that the East Empire had attracted the attention of countless powerful forces and aristocrats, with the ripple effects of the academy's establishment spreading far and wide.

Yi Du continued to speak, his hands manipulating a letter of invitation that floated over. 'I wonder, Princess Noel, how you intend to proceed. Are there any suitable candidates in the scroll who can be recommended for exchange students to join our academy?'"
