Chapter 053: Virtuous Spiritual Light

Looking at Zhao Xu's blank expression, Lei An nodded slightly.

"You just want to say you have it, and I'll really... "

"Be cautious, Lei An," the Archbishop Sosi interrupted Lei An's words directly.

Zhao Xu glanced at him, and as the liaison officer of the Church's Association, he wouldn't dare to be so reckless in front of clergy members.

If he really had such intelligence, those apprentices who had failed on the wizard's path would have killed themselves.

The only explanation was that Lei An and the Archbishop Sosi were too familiar, familiar to the point where Lei An had lowered his guard.

However, Zhao Xu wouldn't pretend to be someone he's not. He was still a 1-star player, after all.

Don't mention fighting, even a stray spell could send him back to the novice stage.

Show his value to the Archbishop Sosi, and he would be more willing to invest in him later, which would have an extraordinary impact on Zhao Xu's future development.

Even a big shot like the Archbishop Sosi might not take him seriously.

But it was different when he would be appointed as a bishop in the future. It wouldn't be something anyone could take lightly.

Not to mention that the Archbishop Sosi would be sending him to Winter City, which was the birthplace of many players in the school.

"I... " Zhao Xu was about to speak.

"Ah, you don't know, Zhou Xia," the Archbishop Sosi said. "In the past, I failed on the wizard's path and was assigned to Saint Heart to study. As a result, my pastoral talent was not bad, and within a few months, I was granted divine power and obtained divine magic."
Here is the translation of the text:

"But when it comes to the ability to disperse undead creatures, I learned zero-level spells when he didn't grasp it. I learned first-level spells when he also didn't grasp it. Finally, I almost broke through to the third level spellcaster's mastery of second-level spells, and the goddess finally couldn't bear it anymore and gave him another divine favor, allowing him to obtain this ability to disperse."

"Ah, yes, the divine favor of awakening the domain, I brought you here because of Senior Brother Zhao's rich experience. With his guidance, you can definitely avoid various pitfalls."

Just as Senior Brother Zhao was about to continue boasting, he suddenly stopped and said, "I just obtained the ability to disperse!"

"What?"

Just as Senior Brother Zhao was about to continue boasting, he looked taken aback.

The Archbishop, who had been sitting there with a smile, looked at Zhao Xuan with a serious expression, his hand trembling so much that the ceramic cup was about to be crushed.

"The divine teachings of the goddess may not be as extreme in their rejection of lies like the Just God, but——"

Just then, a warm and soothing white light shot out and covered the surrounding area.

This was a fatal poison for undead creatures, making humans feel at ease.

The familiar feeling, whether it was Senior Brother Zhao or Li Ran, was that this was the light of positive energy.

This was the energy released when a priest uses the "dispersal of undead creatures" ability.

The light dissipated, and Zhao Xuan was sitting quietly, holding the Archbishop's holy emblem, as if nothing had happened.

【Adventurer Zhong Xia is dispersing undead creatures, with a roll of 1D20 + charisma adjustment = 12 + 1 = 13, allowing the dispersal of up to 2 HD undead creatures.】

The adventurer Zao Xu's character panel suddenly displayed the following two lines of information.

According to the information, if he encounters those skeletal warriors again, a single hit from him would immobilize all six of them.

This is the true power of the priest's "Dispelling Undead" ability.

The evil priest uses this ability in combination with spells to create a sea of skeletons, which is not a difficult task.

"What's possible?" Li An looked at Zao Xu with a puzzled expression.

Zao Xu, the Archbishop of Soso, sighed and shook his head lightly.

The silence between the two was so long that Zao Xu began to feel uneasy.

Suddenly, the Archbishop of Soso directly grasped the wand on the table and began to chant a spell in front of Zao Xu.

Before Zao Xu could react, he felt a faint, cone-shaped light spreading throughout the room, including Li An.

In the blink of an eye, the Archbishop of Soso put down the wand and looked at Li An with a solemn expression.

"Li An, he may not be what you said he is. He's only exceptional because you're looking at him that way."

"What kind of joke is this? Am I not his illegitimate child?" Li An said with a grin, not taking into account the subtle advantage Zao Xu had gained.

"He has a divine spark," the Archbishop of Soso said, his eyes growing even more serious.

Li An, who had only recently taken up the position of liaison officer and had no experience as a liaison officer who had spent decades in the church, reacted slowly.

"I never noticed that. It seems that the unique 'divine spark' you have is not exclusive to first-level priests. This knowledge is too obscure."

Li An slapped his own head in frustration.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Hey, no way, I'm not that smart. Even if I didn't expect it, I would hide my divine light from him just in case. The main reason is that I didn't expect him to awaken the ability to dispel undead creatures."

Reinhardt shook his head and consoled himself.

Zhao Xu had been confused since the bishop of the Sosaria Church started casting spells, and now it was like a fog.

"Ask?"

His curiosity was like a spark that could ignite a deadly trap. But in normal times, it would serve as a warning to avoid repeating the same mistake.

Zhao Xu had already guessed that the bishop of the Sosaria Church might have already figured out that he had obtained the divine magic.

In theory, as long as he completed the training for his equipment and armor, he would be a qualified priest.

If Zhao Xu had received this most basic training before coming here, he would probably have seen his character card showing that he was a level 1 priest.

He had to know where Reinhardt had made a mistake.

"Generally, priests of the same alignment as gods will have a similar affinity to gods," Reinhardt explained slowly.

Zhao Xu understood that a benevolent deity's priest was generally benevolent and righteous.

Only some priests were neutral or benevolent, and would not deviate more than two levels.

"Therefore, priests who worship chaotic, evil, good, or neutral gods will have the same divine light as the gods."

Reinhardt continued to explain, "So, you will have a benevolent divine light that is consistent with the goddess."

"I thought at first that only a formally appointed level 1 priest would have such a divine light, but I didn't expect that as long as you have most of the priest's abilities, you will obtain the divine light."

"After Bishop Sosaria used the 'Detect Good' spell to detect the benevolent divine light on your body, it's natural that he figured out you're actually a provisional priest."
