Chapter 500: The Mysterious Guest

Zhao Xu, who was driving the horse-drawn carriage, didn't expect that one day he would be chased by a group of winter wolves.

Even without looking back, he could sense the vast snowstorm created by the advancing winter wolf army.

At this moment, he was controlling the warhorse while occasionally applying the "Light Healing" spell to the horse, which was exhausted from running.

As a master of both martial arts and magic, Zhao Xu could do anything he wanted.

Magic is the best treasure trove.

Even if the winter wolf army behind him was extremely fast, several times it almost caught up, but Zhao Xu's temporary acceleration technique broke through the chase.

Even after consuming a lot of energy, the winter wolves were exhausted and could only linger in the distance.

At this moment, Zhao Xu gazed at the ice-cleft gorge ahead, lost in thought.

According to legend, this ice-cleft gorge was created by a god chasing the ancient white dragon and slashing it with his long sword.

In the end, only a small empty space remained in the middle, allowing passage.

Generally speaking, only experienced riders who often travel through the ice mountains would have to take this shortcut due to time constraints.

Most people would choose the safer and more time-consuming route.

Zhao Xu's riding skills were not exceptional, and he relied on his agility attribute to make up for it.

As the carriage approached the gorge, the few frost giants driving the chase from behind let out angry roars, scolding the winter wolves chasing after them.

Because these wolves were slowing down at this moment, afraid of getting too close and losing control, they would roll into the valley in the middle of the mountain. Generally speaking, they would not take this shortcut when coming down from the mountain to the big city. The road through the valley was not wide enough for so many wolves to pass through at the same time, and even a slight mistake could trigger an avalanche.

The shadow of death loomed over this place, with a sense of ferocity, watching every careless passerby. However, Zhao Xu's approach was extremely bold.

He was like a reckless driver about to take a turn, not only not reducing speed, but rather urging the warhorse ahead, as if the road ahead was a flat snow-covered highway.

At the same time, in an ice cave carved out of the mountain, two heads suddenly emerged.

"My sister, it's weird, look, the wolves are chasing a cart," a man exclaimed in surprise.

Meanwhile, his sister, holding a single-lens telescope, looked ahead and shook her head: "That cart is doomed, although I don't know how he managed to make the rear carriage as light as a swallow, but in front is the icy gulf, and behind these wolves, as long as they don't act foolishly, they will definitely wear each other out."

After speaking, she was about to put down the telescope, as she and her brother had barely managed to pass through this icy gulf just two days ago, with great effort.

It was impossible for a horseman to safely pass through this gulf with wolves chasing him without a riding skill of at least 40 levels. And no one in the world could reach that level.
Here is the translation of the text:

"I'm telling you, Xiao Nian, that horse ran all the way here in perfect condition, with a gait like flying, and I'm not sure if the driver is a mage."

"Come on, you're being naive, and your sister is a warrior, after all. She wouldn't know nothing about magic."

The clear-skinned woman smiled and said, "If we fall down here, it won't matter even if we have a flying spell. There are countless ice shelves below, and we can easily be pierced to the heart."

"If we fly up, there's a possibility of collapse and then a sudden gust of wind and stormy weather. Unless it's a mage who can cast long-distance teleportation, no one can survive here."

The robust man looked at his own armor and sighed, thinking he couldn't help his opponent. He looked at his sister with a pitiful expression.

His sister, on the other hand, glared at her saintly warrior brother, saying, "Brother, you're only going to drag me down to death with you. I only have three resurrection stones left, and I don't want to waste them here."

"Ah, yes, yes," the man said awkwardly, but his eyes lit up suddenly. "Wait a minute, Xiao Nian, can I save him by riding that flying eagle?"

His sister shook her head, "You're more aware of the intensity of that storm than I am. I'm even suspicious that there's some mysterious magic operating above. As for that man, whether he lives or dies, you'll definitely be the first to fall and shatter into pieces. You're being too self-righteous, and we'll just have to wait and see if we can collect his remains or notify his family later."

"But won't he fall apart?" the man asked in surprise.

It wasn't until his sister reacted that she realized she had said too much, and she could only explain, "You really think he'll stop and wait for us? He'll definitely limit his speed, get off the horse, and then engage in a fierce battle with these winter wolves."

As the woman spoke, she started to feel a headache coming on, and the two of them struggled to get through, all for the sake of retrieving the bodies. It was a tremendous hassle.

When the man heard this, he also looked depressed. Although Saint Warrior was extremely powerful, even saying that he could suppress other close-combat professions, and with 28 or 32 points of talent assigned, he was even more exceptional. However, he was still unable to reverse the heavens like a wizard.

However, in the ice castle, the two siblings were guessing Zhao Xun's fate, when he was frantically whipping his horse with his whip, urging it to gallop forward.

Behind him, some of the winter wolves were already exhausted and collapsed on the snow.

These wolves that followed closely were all staring at Zhao Xun's horse-drawn carriage with a fierce gaze, baring their teeth and snarling, as if ready to pounce at any moment.

Finally, the horse galloped forward, as if it had forgotten that it was on the edge of a deep cliff.

"He wants to die?" The woman in the ice castle exclaimed in shock.

She had already noticed that the brake was not enough, and it was impossible to stop the carriage from falling into the pit. At this moment, the frost giants behind them let out a fierce roar, shouting at the winter wolves to stop, while holding a giant stone and preparing to throw it.

As Zhao Xun looked at the horse's hoof, which had already reached the edge of the cliff, he knew that it would collapse in just a few seconds.

"Flight technique."

In this critical moment, Zhao Xun's incantation and hand movements were just complete, and a green light representing flight energy condensed on his hand.

Zhao Xun patted the horse's rump.

The horse, which had been galloping wildly on the snowy plain, suddenly seemed to have grown wings and took off into the air, without slowing down.
In the valley of snow-capped mountains, before their eyes lay an unfathomable abyss, and behind them, the winter wolves were closing in. The horse carriage controlled by Zhao Xu was soaring through the air like a mythical creature, defying everyone's expectations.

"This is too fantastical!" exclaimed the sister on the fortress walls, only to quickly regain her composure.

Neither horses nor humans could fly across this chasm. She sighed, "What a pity!"

On the vast, endless snowfield, the frost giant, with a look of ruthless determination, spoke in giant language, "The path to death is useless."

Just then, the warhorse, which had been delighted to possess the ability to fly, suddenly let out a desperate cry, and its flying ability, which had been in control, was lost.

In the valley below, mysterious gusts of wind kept emerging, and the powerful shockwave caused the carriage driven by Zhao Xu to overturn, as if an invisible force was pulling it.

Next, a mysterious attractive force came, and the carriage suddenly fell freely, plummeting towards the ground like a cannonball.

"What?" the sorceress woman, looking at this scene, was filled with doubt, "It seems there's no ice shield, and even the Falling Feather Technique is futile."

"Ah," the brother, a saintly warrior, shrugged, "It seems this Three-Ring Magician has no fireballs ready; otherwise, we could still fight back, taking a few falls."

The Ice Cracked Valley, where the bodies of those who had suffered were used to warn of its terrifying presence every year.

"Alright, sister, let's go back. It's windy outside," the saintly warrior man said, retreating from the narrow ice-carved door.

However, in the next instant, he looked like a cat with raised hackles, almost jumping up.

"Sorry, I intruded."
I see a wizard in a cloak adorned with gleaming, shimmering stars, pouring down from above, sitting in an ice-carved chamber, greeting them with a question.
