Chapter 289: Reunion

The witch, who had gone through countless years, exuded an aura of fear that made the air thick with terror. This was the witch's inherent "fear aura," which affected all living beings with a level of hit dice less than 5 HD, causing them to become frightened and enter a state of panic. Adventurers with a level below 5 would be affected by the "Fear" spell if they gazed at the witch.

Zhao Xu was immune to this mental effect due to his undead nature. At this moment, Zhao Xu's entire mind was highly focused, and if he didn't handle it properly, his precious "Wraith Lord" ability might be lost.

Even the most skilled mages lacked a channel for their magic, which often led to their downfall and death. Some mages, therefore, chose to become a witch by undergoing a ritual known as the "Witch's Testament." This ritual allowed them to perfect their previous profession and inherit their abilities.

The ritual's true purpose was to create a magical container that stored life energy. Only by destroying this container could one truly defeat the witch. Otherwise, even if the witch died on the spot, it would resurrect within 1-10 days around the container.

This was the reason why countless legendary heroes chose to become witches, allowing them to come back to life and become the ultimate demon king in the next chapter.

To become a witch, one had to master the craft of "Creating Marvels" and pay 120,000 gold coins and a large amount of energy to perform the ritual.

Compared to the direct "Time-Warp" spell "Suiyuan Wuhun", the cost is enormous, and it is also strictly limited to the evil camp.

As for the benevolent camp's "Great Sorcerer" and the more advanced legendary-level "Half Sorcerer", they are extremely rare and unparalleled, even more so than the legendary cleric.

And the "Half Sorcerer" is even more powerful, often referred to as the "Half God Sorcerer".

At this moment, Zhao Xu turned around and looked at the sorcerer floating in the air with disdain. He directly and decisively consumed his "Sense of Death" ability again, opening his right eye.

The sorcerer saw Zhao Xu open his originally closed right eye and immediately felt a powerful death intention looming over its soul, almost causing it to kneel down in worship.

The sorcerer wanted to cast a protective spell to safeguard itself, but it failed to sense any magic being cast by the mysterious man in front of it.

At first glance, the man seemed like an immortal being.

However, upon closer inspection, he couldn't determine what kind of immortal being it was, and it seemed more like a living being.

The man in front of him was definitely not the most human-like immortal being, the "Vampire".

And Zhao Xu's right eye was also radiating the power of the Grim Reaper at this moment, causing various possibilities to constantly rotate and change, slowly becoming a series of flashbacks before his eyes.

"You should repair the dimensional bag in your dimension bag that has been damaged. Why not fix it?" Zhao Xu said coldly, looking at the sorcerer in front of him with an icy gaze.

After hearing Zhao Xu's words, the sorcerer immediately lost his composure, completely unaware that his deepest secret had been discovered by a young man.

How could he possibly know that he carried the "dimensional bag" with him?
And how could he know that the "dimensional bag" was damaged?

The amulet was the most precious treasure of the warlock, and most of them were hidden in places with extremely strict and mysterious security.

As the warlock asked "Who are you?", it felt an incredible sense of unease and couldn't continue speaking. Zhao Xiu didn't say anything either, just turned his head away and continued walking, saying, "Your path is correct. However, you can either become a half-god warlock or use the legendary skill 'Break the Amulet' to destroy it. If not, you will be courting death. Don't think the warlocks of the past were foolish, just like you, a clever one."

The warlock's face turned red as it heard Zhao Xiu's words, and its voice trembled slightly as it wanted to ask for guidance. However, it didn't dare to approach Zhao Xiu, so it could only stand there and watch him disappear around the corner.

Zhao Xiu didn't stop until he turned the next corner, then let out a sigh of relief.

As a mage, information is the most important. Just now, he used "Sense of Death" to see the scene where he and the warlock clashed, and was directly destroyed by the opponent using "Separation Technique".

He had to switch between four or five routes, but finally managed to escape using "Soul Lord". Even this time, he saw a longer future, and directly ordered the warlock to reveal the location of its amulet.

This was also the fate of the warlock, who had the courage to carry the most important amulet with him.
Here is the translation of the text:

Recently, a powerful sorcerer got into a dispute with a legendary immortal being, who directly threatened to destroy the sorcerer's soul box unless the sorcerer handed it over. The sorcerer was determined to find a way to split the soul box into two parts, so that even if one part was destroyed, the other part could be used to revive it.

Zhou Xu just revealed two methods to split the soul box to the sorcerer. One method is to use the legendary spell to split the soul box, while the other is for the sorcerer to become a half-divine sorcerer, allowing the soul box to be split into eight spirit stones. As long as one of the stones exists, it can be used to revive the sorcerer. This revelation made the sorcerer suspicious about Zhou Xu's identity.

As a result, Zhou Xu took extra precautions when acting, making sure there were no problems before taking action. He even used his "invisibility" spell to pass through obstacles. After walking for a couple of hours, Zhou Xu finally reached the "High Tower" within his line of sight.

The High Tower was eight stories high, with a clock tower at the top. The clock, which came from the Mechanical Realm, was ticking away. After observing and judging the situation, Zhou Xu found that there were no immortal beings nearby, except for the clock tower itself, which seemed to have a church-like atmosphere and could repel immortal beings.

However, Zhou Xu didn't think too much about it and used his "invisibility" spell to slip through the massive iron door with two openings.
As soon as Zhao Xu stepped in, he sensed something was off and heard a strange sound coming from beside him. "Secondary Speed Burst!" he exclaimed, and immediately activated this spell.

At that moment, his entire body was in a state of extremely slowed time flow, and the arrow that was about to hit him was hovering in mid-air, hesitating to strike. Unfortunately, Zhao Xu had not yet mastered the four-ring "Speed Burst" spell, which would allow him to teleport a short distance. He could only use the two-ring spell to move a few meters at most.

Without the "Teleportation Boots", Zhao Xu was unable to use his usual instant transportation technique and had to rely on walking. He was filled with regret and frustration because he had become accustomed to the convenience of teleportation.

Just then, he noticed that the undead creatures had become immune to attribute absorption and damage to physical, mental, and sensing attributes. Moreover, his own senses had become dulled, making him more vulnerable to attacks.

To his surprise, he was suddenly attacked by a skeletal warrior wielding a bow and arrow from a distance. Fortunately, Zhao Xu was still in stealth mode and quickly moved to a safe distance, where he stopped to catch his breath.

As the aftereffects of the spell hit him, Zhao Xu felt a dizzying sensation and became paralyzed, unable to move.

"Whoa!" he exclaimed, as two arrows simultaneously struck the doorframe, their tails still quivering.

"What's going on?" Zhao Xu thought to himself. "The magic alarm went off, and I estimated the enemy's movement speed to be about the same as mine. Why didn't they notice me?"

At that moment, Esveia emerged from the shadows, her brow furrowed in thought as she held her lightweight crossbow.

Meanwhile, Wang Qingwei also emerged from another shadow, also holding a lightweight crossbow and with a similarly furrowed brow.
Here is the translation of the text:

"You're being too polite," I said to you two. This time, Zhao Xu finally shed his invisible form and looked at the two girls with a sarcastic tone.

"Ai, Zhong Xia," King Wei exclaimed, startled by Zhao Xu's sudden appearance. She turned around to see Zhao Xu and was taken aback.

Asvei, although she didn't make a sound, looked at Zhao Xu with a hint of emotion.

"You shouldn't have come," King Wei said lightly, "and by the way, congratulations on reaching level 5. I and Asvei are still at level 3."

"So you didn't even bother to notify me through the group chat," Zhao Xu smiled.

It's true that resurrecting can only be done in this half-plane, and the monsters inside have high levels, making it not much different from directly wiping out.

"In fact, I came to this half-plane with additional tasks to complete, and finding you two was just a coincidence. I came to exchange information," Zhao Xu reassured them, trying to ease their worries.

He hated being indebted to others.

King Wei said, "You can send us a QQ message, and we'll definitely tell you what's going on."

Zhao Xu chuckled, "I did send you a message, but you didn't respond. That's why I came here to use my item positioning skills to find you."

"Haha, King Wei asked me to make sure not to respond to you before we wipe out or leave, so as to avoid you finding out the truth and trying to rescue us," Asvei said.

Zhao Xu thought to himself, once the other party didn't respond, he might assume they had given up and would not affect reality.

But this time, Zhao Xu couldn't help but gaze at King Wei, wondering if the other party had also guessed the thread of clues left behind by the masses after the great migration ten months later.
Here is the translation of the text:

Or, to put it another way, the other party really believes in this information they've extracted from the game, but it's gotten to the point where it's ridiculous.

Zhao Xu is thinking, and he starts selectively revealing some of the information he's brought, exchanging information with each other.

At this time, Wang Qingwei and Esvechi also tell Zhao Xu about their experiences during this period.

Finally, after listening, Zhao Xu couldn't help but lift his head and gaze at the high tower that's many layers away.

To his surprise, there's a portal there!

It can lead to the outside world and to the "Amber Coffin" storage temple!
