Chapter 16: Why Me?

Zhao Xu's face remained calm, as if this development didn't exceed his expectations. However, his mind was already in turmoil, constantly thinking.

Potential Points?

This seemingly additional gift account, on the other hand, was what the people in front of him valued the most.

"What can you explain?" Zhao Xu asked.

The forum mentioned in the previous life had all sorts of content, but Zhao Xu had never seen any information related to potential points.

Even after crossing over, he had never heard anyone mention this term.

As a 5th-level warrior like Zhao Xu, how could he know the names of various 9th-level spells?

It wasn't like they were sitting around chatting and boasting about their experiences on Earth.

"It's actually a special innate ability, and the owner can obtain potential points every time they level up. Through consuming potential points, they can restore spell slots and usage times for some profession skills."

Zhao Xu listened, but he was very perplexed. Restoring spell slots was indeed impressive, and increasing profession skill usage times was even more impressive.

At least he didn't know of any other way to achieve this.

But no matter how astonishing, it was difficult to recover the fact that each level had a few potential points.

Before reaching legendary status, a person would have 100 potential points, with 5 points per level. How could they withstand the use of these points?

"I notice that you seem to be like someone from our world, very sensitive to these numerical values," Anzhiya suddenly said.
Here is the translation of the text:

"If it were only a matter of a few levels, then it would indeed be that way. Therefore, those who possess innate potential, in the past, were all very inconspicuous. All they had was a few more tricks up their sleeves compared to other adventurers."

"Until a legendary mage discovered a spell to obtain extra innate potential, and it was just a 5th-level spell at the time, everything changed."

Zhao Xu's reaction was instantaneous. Extra innate potential? Wouldn't that mean the spell slots were unlimited? And wouldn't that also mean unlimited uses of profession skills?

Zhao Xu found it hard to imagine a mage who could fight and flee, with a variety of countermeasures and trigger methods, being able to sustain themselves indefinitely. How terrifying would that be?

Just sending someone over, casting a wave, and then running away, consuming the teleportation spell - such a simple routine could wear out most people.

Arthur's life value would not automatically recover, but rather through long periods of rest or treatment by a therapist. Even monsters were the same.

Everyone was talking about the theory.

Zhao Xu suddenly understood a bit.

The Final Scroll organization needed people with innate potential to become a sharp, limitless mobile knife.

"Just like I'm too low-level now," Zhao Xu said, scratching his head.

In his heart, he was secretly looking forward to it.

It was said that some objects could directly read and level up. The Final Scroll organization definitely wouldn't be short on those.

It would be best if he could read eight books and directly level up to 9th level, able to cast 5th-level spells.

"Don't worry, as long as you join us, we'll provide you with sufficient means to ensure you level up to a legendary mage," Anniya said.

Although Zhao Xu told himself to stay calm, his heart still jumped with excitement.
Here is the translation of the passage:

As for the requirements of the organization, they are far from you, and the rights and obligations are correspondingly arranged. So, I'll tell you slowly and in detail when you've reached a higher level. Ah, Anzhi Noya said nonchalantly, as if introducing an underground organization.

"Did you determine to accept me before I entered the transmission portal?" Zhao Xu asked.

"Well, it's more accurate to say that you chose to leave the portal at that moment."

Zhao Xu's eyes widened slightly.

At the moment he left the portal, he had just converted his faith to the Goddess of Magic. Originally, he thought his potential had been discovered, and that black-robed sorcerer was the guide.

It seemed he was still mistaken.

Before making a clear declaration of faith, others would not possibly allow him to join the organization.

However, Zhao Xu was astonished by the speed of the organization. From the moment he left the portal to his dormitory, the entire process took no more than 15 minutes. Within this time, the organization had already completed the procedures and directly intervened in the grassroots management of the Sorcerer's Association, assigning Anzhi Noya as his mentor.

The mysterious organization was able to accomplish all this, and Zhao Xu had no doubts.

However, completing the process in 20 minutes was completely beyond the reasonable range. Even in this information age, it's unlikely that a recruitment process would be completed in 20 minutes.

But then Zhao Xu suddenly realized something.

It wasn't the organization's efficiency that was high, but rather—

The Goddess had been watching him all along.

Or, to put it another way, when he converted his faith to the Goddess at that moment, the Goddess's gaze fell on him again.

The pawn that was still in the process of being observed suddenly found itself on the board.

It was only the Goddess's will that could make him eligible without any discussion.

Risk and opportunity coexist, and Zhāo Xù's true portrait is one of risk and opportunity. If he joins the organization, he will undoubtedly be directly entangled in the intricate plans of countless powers, which conflicts with his own self-preservation thoughts.

However, it is only in such a large organization that he can obtain the strongest and most powerful resource support.

Zhāo Xù is well aware that when he was a warrior, he spent a lot of effort to learn a strong specialty. However, it's not exclusive to the earth, and it's especially true for a mage specialty. Without an organization, many mages would not bother to join.

Moreover, if he doesn't learn his specialty, it will become obsolete.

"Teacher, what do I need to do next?" Zhāo Xù decided firmly and began to listen to the superior's arrangement.

"You don't need to do anything before you reach level 9. We won't be able to use you."

"However, your career path and all the skills you've learned need us to plan."

An Shì Nuò Niā said.

"No problem. But can you reveal the plan for the next step?" Zhāo Xù smiled with his teeth.

Players may think this is an NPC violating their choice rights. However, as someone who knows the truth, Zhāo Xù is eager for the opponent to arrange everything for him.

"It's okay. After you complete the training and become a 1st-level mage, go below and complete the priest's career training. Then, when you can upgrade, come back here and I'll tell you how to become a 2nd-level scholar of the Chronicles from then on. From then on, your magical profession will advance along the path of the Chronicles."

"As for your promotion, we'll talk about it later when you reach level 5."

An Shì Nuò Niā said slowly.
