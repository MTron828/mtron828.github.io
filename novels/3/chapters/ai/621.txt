Chapter 622: The Strength of the Nine Swords, the Sword of the People

For warriors, a painful experience is losing a trusted weapon. This is not a problem that can be solved by simply picking up another type of weapon on the go.

For example, a "specialized weapon" skill can increase the attack power of a specific weapon by one level, while a "refined weapon" skill can increase the damage of a specific weapon by two points. There are also higher-level specialized weapons and refined weapons, and once a weapon is changed, it can only be returned to its original state unless someone like Zhao Xu has the ability to "mix and match" and reset the weapon.

This is also a weakness of warriors, who have spent four skill points to enhance the power of their weapons, which is equivalent to the strength of the "Divine Blessing" spell.

However, Zhao Xu is not only concerned about this.

The ability to transfer other weapons also means that some specialized skills of specific weapons can be transferred using this ability, which is dependent on further investigation.

Over the next few days, the old man, without a single mistake, explained the entire system of the Nine Swords to Zhao Xu, especially when encountering complex situations, he would activate his "transmission" ability and directly impart knowledge to Zhao Xu.

Meanwhile, Zhao Xu's heart was filled with shock and awe.

If Arthur did not have the existence of "magic", any traveler who carelessly touched the "Nine Swords" would think they had entered a martial arts world.

However, upon closer comparison, there are also some subtle differences.
Here is the translation of the text:

What truly left Zhao Xu in awe was that the skills of the Nine Swords were all "unique abilities" that belonged to the realm of anti-magic and could not be suppressed. Slowly, Zhao Xu also began to transform from a passive recipient of knowledge to asking questions and seeking guidance from the elder, who was surprised by the elder's unexpected questions.

"Are you really a mage, not a warrior?" the elder asked with a deep sense of astonishment. "Unless you're not deceiving me with your physical age, I would have thought that you had at least over ten years of experience in martial arts. The level of attack power is indeed determined by an individual's ability and innate aptitude."

"But in terms of scope, it's more about accumulated time. Especially, I can be certain that your previous professional training did not involve military weapons, yet you can still grasp them, which is beyond my expectations."

As the elder spoke, his eyes narrowed slightly. "You young man, are you a mage with a warrior's heart?"

Zhao Xu smiled in response.

Anyone who has been a warrior for ten years will always carry the memories of their physical body.

After that, the elder spent the entire day giving Zhao Xu a hands-on demonstration of the Nine Swords system, and the elder's eyes grew wider and wider, as if he was afraid of missing any key points.

Throughout the process, the elder also demonstrated his own level of expertise, pointing out the key points directly and clearly, without any ambiguity, just like a research student in mathematics teaching elementary school mathematics.

"Sir, the 'Mo Feng Pai' is a unique sword art that only swordsmen know, and I should not be learning it," Zhao Xu said with an embarrassed expression.
As a pragmatist, he listened to the principles of the wind and void, just like he was studying the Nine Yang Arts, and suddenly, he heard the whispers of the Nine Yin True Classic from next door.

He naturally accepted this and essentially gained an advantage by gaining insight into the enemy's intentions.

However, as a swordsmanship expert in the three main professions, the foundation of the attack is the lowest, and the life expectancy is the shortest. As a close-range combatant, the strength and defense are both low. These critical panel data are all weak points, and the style learned is not the most outstanding. Naturally, it falls short of expectations.

"I'll teach you, and you'll just listen, okay? Don't talk nonsense." The elder shook his head with a hint of disdain.

"This is the first move of the wind and void, 'Crimson Lotus Sword'. After activation, the weapon can unleash a fierce flame in the current round. Each strike can increase the damage by 1-6 levels of the martial artist."

As he spoke, Wú Fēi recited the cultivation principles of "Crimson Lotus Sword" and, at the same time, a wooden sword trembled, and a burst of flames erupted, as if an invisible fire dragon was emerging.

"Have you grasped it?" he asked.

Zhāo Xù shook his head.

It seemed that he was not a martial arts prodigy, except that he had never experienced the thrill of leveling up in place after gaining insight.

Especially, he had never walked the path of swordsmanship, and he couldn't even use the wind and void style.

"Rotting wood," Wú Fēi exclaimed, stomping his foot in frustration. "Your innate talent is so poor that even the imperial family would be expelled from the throne."

Zhāo Xù smiled, "It's not that bad. I'm not using multiple weapons or bare-handed striking right now."

Wú Fēi's eyes narrowed slightly as he listened to these words, and he asked, "Have you understood the effect of this move?"

Zhāo Xù nodded slightly.
Here's the translation of the given text:

"Just like enchanting a weapon, these abilities increase the damage by 1-6 points. The key is that this ability also adds an unlimited martial arts level. This technique can enhance the power of multi-attack weapons.

After six months of gameplay, many players in the Ranger's Guild have started to abandon their multi-attack skills because they are too weak compared to single-shot skills.

Multi-attack skills require sufficient expertise and may even be provided by profession abilities, but it's still far from enough.

Players also discovered that, even with equal investment, the damage output of multi-attack skills is actually weaker than that of single-attack skills. Many players have defected, leaving only a few die-hard fans.

Wu Bu said with a smile, "If you can grasp the purpose of these skills, at least these skills won't gather dust in your hands."

Wu Bu then asked Zhao Xu, "Why are the three major factions - Steel Soul, Iron Heart, and White Falcon - considered the top three of the Nine Swords?"

Zhao Xu was taken aback by Wu Bu's sudden reversal of their previous conversation.

However, Zhao Xu was not surprised, as he had previously pursued the Nine Swords system as a warrior in his past life. Although he didn't have the talent and didn't plan to marry or inherit a legacy in the East, he had lost the opportunity to learn the Nine Swords.

This time, after being reborn, he felt a sense of nostalgia and longing for his past life.

Zhao Xu was also quietly reviewing these skills in his mind.

The Nine Swords system has nine factions, each with skills categorized into nine levels of difficulty. Generally, each level has one to three skills.

Unlike mages, who have hundreds of spells, even a 20th-level warrior can only learn up to 13 skills. Each choice must be made with great care."
Here is the translation:

"It's not necessary to elaborate on 'Iron Heart Flow' and 'White Raven Flow', so let's take 'Steel Soul Flow' as an example."

"One-layer 'Perfect Spirit' can replace 'Willpower' check with a focus check when necessary."

"Similar to this, there's the two-layer 'Anticipation' (focus replaces reflex), three-layer 'Spirit Control' (focus replaces resilience), and these three techniques can replace 'Willpower' with focus, making it easier to stack. Moreover, even if the result is 1, it will not fail."

Zhao Xu knows he's gotten this far, and his opponent can infer it.

Zhao Xu's ability to brush aside a bunch of spells like this is quite impressive, but most adventurers have their own weaknesses in 'Willpower', making it easy for opponents to target them. Choosing one or two of these techniques can perfectly avoid their weaknesses.

What's more important is that even if the specific performance value is 1-20, it will not fail, which is the most critical point.

This avoids the possibility of "weakness overcoming strength".

If Zhao Xu masters these techniques and has an 80-level focus check, then even if his performance is 1, he will still pass all challenges with a difficulty not exceeding 80.

He won't appear to have an 80-level 'Willpower' and then be hit by a "weak intelligence" spell because his performance evaluation is 1.

Mastering these three techniques gives him the confidence to not rely on specific performances, and he can simply compare the numbers to decide whether he passes or not! The strong don't rely on luck!
Here is the translation of the text:

At this time, Zhao Xū seemed to be even more enthusiastic, continuing to talk about it with great passion, "The 'Emerald Slash' at the steel soul level can transform dependent combat understanding and tempered spirit into an opportunity to find the enemy's weak point, converting ordinary attacks into unblockable contact attacks."
As he spoke, he got a bit tangled up, saying, "It's almost like a weakened version of the Ghostly Fist Technique."
"As for the 'Burst Shot' at the four-ring level, it's a theoretical continuous charge or a 180-degree reversal charge, and I don't need to elaborate on its significance in Arthur's context."
"When we reach the eighth level's 'Godspeed Body', this step can turn every round into a dual swift action."
As he said this, Zhao Xū's heart skipped a beat.
He hadn't expected to break through the action limit so quickly.
If he mastered this step, the next round would be two instant spells and one mark action.
Compared to others who had exhausted themselves, he had already achieved a triple-action round.
"As for the ninth level's 'Time Stop', it can perform a continuous two-round full-cycle attack, while appearing to the outside world as if only one round had passed."
Zhao Xū couldn't help but shake his head at this, although there were some restrictions on additional actions, but the "swift burst" gained through the efforts of a wizard was a completely different path in the Nine Swords system.
Not to mention the "White Crow Sect" centered around the "Charge" technique.
The first "White Crow Tactics" in the Nine Swords system uses a swift action as a sacrifice, directly reversing the entire flow of time, changing the reaction of teammates, and allowing teammates to acquire a similar uncostly swift burst technique, gaining an additional "bullet time".
"Now, let's choose which one to practice," the old man, Wàn Bì, suddenly opened his mouth.
Zhao Xū furrowed his brow slightly, saying, "If I pursue the iron-hearted spirit, I'll definitely start with a technique from the 'Iron Heart Flow' school of martial arts first."
Zhao Xu spoke, and a strange glint appeared in his eyes. "I'll try out the 'Sword Shadow Barrier' on the second level," he said.

The "Sword Shadow Barrier" is a technique that uses the movement of the weapon to parry an incoming attack. Once the opponent makes a move, Zhao Xu can use his lightning-fast speed to counterattack, using his weapon to deflect the opponent's attack.

"How do you grasp the timing?" Yun Buwei asked.

Zhao Xu thought for a moment before answering, "I think it's when I can use my weapon as an extension of my body, like an arm."

As soon as he uses this technique, Zhao Xu's defense is no longer determined by his own defensive abilities, but by his attacking abilities. He can even anticipate the opponent's move and decide whether to use this technique based on the strength of the opponent's attack.

Yun Buwei seemed satisfied with Zhao Xu's answer. "Alright, let's try it out," he said.

Just then, the old man, Yun Buwei, suddenly transformed and struck out with a sword, like a ram's horn, leaving no place to hide. Moreover, he was using the "Emerald Slash", a touch attack that ignored armor.

Zhao Xu's eyes widened, and his gaze was completely taken by the opponent's sword light. He felt like he had lost all his defensive abilities, and was now just a blank slate, relying solely on his basic reflexes to dodge attacks.

But in this instant, Zhao Xu felt a warm sensation from the "Paradise of Humanity" on his hand, and a familiar power surged out of it. The next second, his heavy sword was automatically wielded.
Here is the translation of the text:

Relying on the manual of physical training, Zhao Xu, even without magical powers, had a foundation strength of 13 points, and holding a heavy sword in both hands was not a problem at all.

In the next instant, a gust of wind swept by.

"Bang!" A dull sound echoed.

Zhao Xu suddenly realized that he had used his sword to block the old man's attack, which was filled with the sense of victory.

"What does it feel like?" the old man asked with a smile.

"It's a sense of relief," Zhao Xu replied, his heart still racing.

As he spoke, he also gazed at his sword with a look of astonishment, thinking that if he had hesitated for just a moment, he would have been pierced through the heart.

But if he had reacted just a little faster, he would have missed the old man's attack. It was only when he was in the state of utmost extremity that he could successfully block the attack.

If he were someone else, he would definitely take a more conservative evasive action and would not take such a risk with his life.

His behavior just now was like wearing an iron glove, facing the flying knife head-on.

He did manage to block it, but if he had lost his grip, the result would have been a gruesome death. It was only because of the technique that he had gained such confidence.

"Understood?" the old man asked.

"Understood," Zhao Xu replied.

"Then let's go," the old man said, waving his hand towards Zhao Xu.

Zhao Xu couldn't help but be astonished. "Sir, I haven't even learned the 'Iron Heart Strength' yet."

"Get lost. You think I just taught you? I taught it to the sword," the old man said, gazing at the heavy sword in Zhao Xu's hand, "the sword of the divine heavens."
This text translates to:

"It is the sword of the people, and the more people under your hand, the stronger its power will be. In the future, your nine sword knowledge will tell you all."
