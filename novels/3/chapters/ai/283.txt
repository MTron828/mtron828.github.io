Chapter 284: The Earth Shakes and the Gods Weep

As Zhao Xu gazed upon the statue, he couldn't help but wonder why this divine image was present here. Initially, he had experienced the first-person perspective of the "God of Slaughter" and had made most of his moves with remarkable precision. Even Edmund, who had once been a mortal, was not far off.

Zhao Xu had thought he would gain something from this. Who would have thought that even the three "Transcendent Divine Abilities" seals, let alone the magic of the goddess, would not bestow such a gift upon him? It was unthinkable that even the gods themselves would implement such a plan, as it would require a hefty price to be paid.

Otherwise, any legendary wizard-level "Legendary Necromancer" could be directly controlled by the "Master of the Undead" with a single move.

At this moment, the statue, which had once stood alongside the "Slumbering Ground" below, had undergone the ravages of time and weather, its surface worn and weathered. Zhao Xu lifted his gaze to behold the face of the "God of Slaughter" on the top of the statue, which had even become somewhat indistinct.

Although Zhao Xu was unsure why there were no half-undead creatures around, he was certain that the divine energy remaining in the statue would not be too abundant after the recent bestowal.

As Lakshmi listened to his question, she also gazed at the statue, saying, "Master, based on your recent experiences and some rumors, it's likely that the 'God of Slaughter' obtained the divine attribute of the former God of Death, Nala."

"After the God of Slaughter fell, there were many rumors, but it is true that his divine attribute was not inherited by any other god. Otherwise, with the divine attribute of the former God of Death combined with that of the God of Slaughter, it would not have been so many years since the appearance of a new God of Death."
Here is the translation of the text:

Arthur has never had a senseless love or hatred.

Zhao Xu has gradually come to understand that he has the ability to break through boundaries, so the goddess of magic has invested in him in exchange for future assistance.

Just like how he once obtained part of his "fate" by making a promise to the Morlin Stone.

These years, only Xisilvina has not been deceived by the three blessings of the Morlin Stone, and instead has even turned the tables on it.

So Zhao Xu has always held the goddess in high esteem.

As a 1st-level priest, he's not bad at all, but whenever it comes to the bestowal of divine blessings, he's always been able to get what he wants easily.

Others may spend years studying and researching the miracles of the gods, but Zhao Xu has always been able to bypass them easily.

But what about the "God of Slaughter" before us?

The other has already perished, having inherited the curse of "cannot be revived" as the successor to the God of Death.

Even if the statue still has some divine power, it's probably because of the reason of the "Sleeping Land" and the three divine tattoos that are not dead, which can be inferred from the fact that they are not dead.

As a former police officer in his past life, Zhao Xu knows that the gift itself is not scary, and he has even received many gifts before.

However, what's terrifying is that he doesn't know the origin of this gift.

The gift is unclear, and it may be a path to death.

"The master said that, it's a strange thing." Lakis thought similarly.

For her, she was able to see through the fog of fate at the beginning, which is why she suddenly joined Zhao Xu.
Here is the translation:

It is said that a divine tool selects its master, and it's mostly like that. Later on, she saw Zhao Xu, who was just an ordinary human, but his talent was only slightly better than her previous masters, who were both top-notch. However, Zhao Xu's aura made her secretly tremble with fear and admiration, saying the name of the master.

"'Master' or 'resonance'?" Larkiss recalled, "For some lingering divine powers, if they are too similar to the self and the gods, they will achieve 'resonance.' Maybe this statue sensed that you and that 'God of Slaughter' Edmond are similar, and your test reactions are also similar to those of the previous opponent."

Larkiss hesitated a bit, having a hard time connecting the "Edmond" who had a deep-seated grudge with the easygoing "Zhao Xu" before her.

Suddenly, a lightbulb moment struck her, "I understand, maybe the master and you are both people with auras that defy the heavens, just like you are both touching the divine power of 'Death God' now."

However, Zhao Xu was a bit melancholic, gazing at the statue of the "God of Slaughter" before him.

At that moment, he recalled the tragic events of his past, which was akin to a family being destroyed and a person being orphaned. In his past life, he was also Zhao Xu, but he didn't have the aura of his current self.

The one who eventually became the "God of Slaughter" was actually Edmond, not the "God of Revenge", and he unwittingly planted the seeds for his own tragic fate.

From the time Zhao Xu entered the game, he had never thought about his past life.
As he stumbled upon this divine power, if he could obtain the divine aura smoothly, then during the period of his power surge from level 6 to 9, he would have to go to the ancient dragon that killed his entire family in his previous life.

Just beyond the precipice, "the land of the sleeping" was filled with the eerie and deathly atmosphere, making the entire landscape a barren yellow desert with not a blade of grass in sight.

Meanwhile, in Zhao Xu's location, even though the "God of Slaughter" was ahead, the ground remained lush and green.

As he turned around, he gazed at the vast expanse of the sky, and with the game time advancing, his summer vacation was approaching.

Zhao Xu also wanted to visit his ancestors who had been lost in his previous life.

"Let's go, Lark," he suddenly said with a stern tone, no longer the gentle and soft tone he had before.

Lark was taken aback, but she knew she only needed to keep silent.

It was as if he had sensed the fiery revenge in Zhao Xu's heart, and the three divine patterns on his body also triggered a powerful energy wave, causing the statue behind him to tremble.

"Wraith attribute."

Zhao Xu suddenly unleashed the power of his divine patterns, and immediately, the negative energy from the sky and earth converged towards him, creating an extremely intense extraction. This sudden movement caused the entire city of An Ta to sink by a small fraction.

Although it was slight, it was real.

The area where he was standing originally saw countless small grasses wither and die, as if autumn had arrived.

The power of the divine patterns tightly protected Zhao Xu, allowing his body to coexist with negative energy in a miraculous state.

At the same time, he began to transform into an "undead being," and the status bar on his character card showed the states of immunity to death, one by one, appearing.

„ÄêYou, Adventurer Zhong Xia, have obtained the attribute of the undead being.]
Here is the translation of the text:

As Zhao Xu's face turned slightly pale, the entire process of the divine power finally came to a halt. However, Zhao Xu was still a living being, albeit one that was different from the undead. This was enough to make the undead regard him as one of their own.

Zhao Xu stood at the boundary between life and death.

At this moment, the statue of the "God of Slaughter" behind Zhao Xu suddenly came to life, grasping the massive sword in its hand and slashing towards the front.

Suddenly, the entire sky and earth changed colors!

The reanimated corpses, mummies, skeletons, and zombies that had already begun to climb back up the ditches suddenly turned pale with fear and began to flee wildly in all directions. Wave after wave of them fled.

Moreover, the sword wielded by the statue was imbued with immense divine power, striking the entire "Land of the Sleepers" with a massive shockwave.

The ancient buildings made of yellow earth, which had accumulated countless years of history, were directly split open by this sword. The entire city was torn apart, and a massive chasm suddenly appeared, as if the heavens themselves had collapsed. The undead creatures hidden within the city walls were startled and began to flee in terror.

"Perception of death."
Zhao Xu, however, remained utterly unmoved by the sudden changes in the sky and earth. He didn't pause for a moment, and instead directly activated another divine pattern.

The power of the divine pattern exploded, and countless fragments of knowledge and fate related to death condensed in Zhao Xu's eyes.

Even without using up the remaining five opportunities to observe death, Zhao Xu saw how the rules of death operated in this world.

Zhao Xu cherished everything before him.

Life, old age, illness, and death.
This was Zhao Xu's first time to wield such a fundamental theory of the heavens and earth.
Here is the translation of the text:

"As an adventurer, your knowledge (faith) has reached level 8 (maximum). The statue that had been quietly standing still suddenly tightened its grip on the stone sword in its hand and thrust it forward with a powerful strike.

The sudden impact caused the entire "Sleeping Grounds" to erupt in a massive explosion of sound waves. The shockwave caused the ancient architecture to shudder and create cracks on its surface.

The once peaceful "Anata City" instantly found itself on the brink of destruction.

At this moment, Zhao Xu's right eye closed shut.

Every time he opened it again, it represented a consumption of "Sense of Death" power.

However, just as his eye closed, Zhao Xu triggered his divine power again and opened his right eye.

This time, his target was not someone else, but himself.

Suddenly, Zhao Xu's life trajectory merged with the threads of death, and a multitude of specific scenes unfolded before him.

He directly saw all his death trajectories.

However, the duration of this divine power was not long-lasting. As a large amount of information poured in, Zhao Xu's right eye began to tremble, as if unable to withstand the immense divine power and quickly shut tight.

After gaining all the knowledge, Zhao Xu showed no hesitation and took a few strides forward before leaping off the cliff.

"Feather Drop Technique!"

At the same time, more than ten figures in the city took to the air, all of which were legendary undead creatures. Although they showed no fear, they were filled with deep confusion.

In contrast, Zhao Xu descended freely, walking backwards.
