Chapter 106: Teleportation Technique

Zhou Xu still remembered that in his past life, his team had caught a young wizard apprentice, but the apprentice managed to escape into the wizarding district, and not a single member of the law enforcement team dared to enter.

In the end, it was Zhou Xu who had to rely on his connections with the town hall to go through a series of procedures before the wizarding association finally agreed to hand over the apprentice for processing.

If the apprentice had been a 1st-level wizard, the jurisdiction would have belonged to the wizarding association, which is why the association sets up branches in different locations.

As Zhou Xu looked at the courteous demeanor of the head of the Moonlight Town branch, he felt a strange sense of absurdity for the first time, as if he had lived two lives.

"Are you guys here with a teleportation portal?" Zhou Xu asked in a fleeting and unrealistic fantasy.

If there was a teleportation portal, it would be easy. There was only one teleportation company in the world, and as long as the destination was a major city, there would definitely be a teleportation portal there, allowing him to constantly loop back to the Floating City.

"Sorry, sir, according to the headquarters' requirements for establishing teleportation portals, we must meet the 19th strategic element of the teleportation portal," the head of the Moonlight Town branch, Li Wei, explained, lowering his head.

"What 19th strategic element?" Zhou Xu asked.

As the head of the branch, Li Wei had no magical prowess to compare to Zhou Xu's, but he was well-versed in the fine details of the association's regulations and replied immediately, "It's the 19th condition for establishing a teleportation portal, such as requiring a city with a population of level three or above, and an evaluation of its strategic importance..."
Translation:

As he spoke, he noticed that Zhao Xu had drifted off, and hastily changed the subject: "If we can't achieve that, there's another possibility: that I have the ability to cast the teleportation spell myself, and if I'm willing to pay the price, the headquarters may provide the necessary materials. However, the president is still a 9th-level mage who just broke through a month ago, so he hasn't had time to implement this plan yet."

Li Wei, who had received high-ranking officials from other major cities' councils, knew that these big shots didn't care whether they achieved their goals or not, as long as they had the right attitude.

"Yeah, can you provide 5th-level mage spellcasting services here?" Zhao Xu asked, settling for the second best.

"I can pay," Zhao Xu added, but it was clear he didn't believe his own words.

The mage council was indeed one of the most convenient places for individuals and organizations to purchase magical services, more so than large churches. Compared to families with strong faith requirements, the mage council's reputation was easier to cultivate.

5th-level teleportation was not a stable teleportation method, and it required the caster to be familiar with the destination. In theory, the president of each branch of the mage council should visit Mistral to take office, so it's unlikely that they haven't gone there. However, there was still a possibility of error, even if it was just a similar location.

To achieve precision, it would be necessary to reach 7th-level "Advanced Teleportation" or even the "Interdimensional Portal" lit by the prayer candle. According to Anniya's words, he had used up all his resources, and Zhao Xu had no intention of spending more money. He had obtained a small book from Ley Mage, which he could use as a bargaining chip.

Li Wei, the council's manager, looked slightly surprised and forced a smile. "Sorry, Ambassador, but you're a bit late. The council held an emergency meeting today, and the president has already left to attend. The 5th-level teleportation scrolls have also been taken away as strategic resources."

Zhao Xu had been wondering what would happen, but this outcome was not what he had expected.
After Li Wei finished speaking, he looked at Zhao Xu's thoughtful expression and hurriedly opened his mouth to alleviate the awkwardness: "However, the messenger, if you're in a hurry, we can escort you to North City, where the association has a teleportation gate."

"North City may be the frontline between Karakos and Valtora, but we will absolutely guarantee your safety. Even if Karakos and Valtora's insurgents want to get recognition from the association later, they won't attack our merchant caravans. Much less will Karakos and Valtora be able to hold out for long."

Zhao Xu listened and thought for a moment before responding, which wasn't unreasonable.

Earlier, in the whirlwind city, the local mage association definitely had a teleportation gate.

However, those teleportation gates may have limitations, unlike Mistral's, which could be opened at will.

Generally, teleportation gates in fixed locations would be set up to allow a certain number of uses per day or per week due to cost considerations.

After thinking for a moment, Zhao Xu finally refused.

He would rather ride in the council's carriage to the frontline with Luo Ya's team.

This adventure allowed him to successfully promote to level 2 and awaken his "Combat Spellcasting" specialization, and he didn't feel like he had lost out.

After sitting for a while, Zhao Xu politely declined Li Wei's dinner invitation and only asked for a "Special Introduction Letter" as a precautionary measure.

At the same time, Zhao Xu expressed satisfaction with this visit and even refused the bag of "Special Local Products from South Island Forest" that Li Wei had specially sent over.

As Zhao Xu left the mage association, he suddenly realized that he was surrounded by several people.

He didn't care about the crowd and quickly walked forward, preparing to fight while asking, "What's going on?"

At this time, Maple Leaf's face turned slightly red, and he grumbled angrily, "Those thieves stole my wallet. I just discovered it when I was about to buy something."
Here is the translation of the text:

As the wanderer, Rainbow, looked on with a sheepish expression, his hand had already rested on the hilt of his sword at his waist.

Zhao Xu could only suppress his smile, feeling embarrassed to the point of losing face at his grandma's.

Arthur's players and reality were no different, with no item slots to carry things, and everything had to be carried on their backs, including purses and the like.

Now, right in front of Rainbow, the wanderer, Zhao Xu was being robbed. This wasn't stealing from home, was it?

At this moment, the thief, who had been grabbed by the maple leaf, was scowling, shouting, "What do I care if you're standing there? This wallet is yours, anyway. All wallet designs are yours!"

His accomplices had already gathered around him, with three or four people. Not to mention the eight or nine people pretending to watch the commotion from a distance.

Zhao Xu realized he had missed the initial opportunity to mediate the situation.

The best choice at the beginning would have been for Rainbow to take the initiative as a wanderer, to demand the return of this wallet.

As the Wanderer's Association holds sway in the underground world, everyone would give respect.

This is also the reason why many teams like to bring wanderers along, as they often need to communicate with them to get things done.

It's not that they're afraid of trouble, unwilling to face evil. It's just that Zhao Xu and his two companions were here to complete a task, and they naturally wanted to avoid making a big fuss. Even if they managed to recover the wallet, they would still be expelled from the town.

The difference between outsiders and locals is like an invisible chasm.

Especially in Moonlight Town, which is too small, with few players born here. Otherwise, Maple Leaf would have called it a day, and these few thieves would have been left to their own devices.

But since it was too late now, Zhao Xu could only find his own way to resolve the situation.

It was okay if the Golden Dragon Grandpa bullied him, but did the thief have the guts to climb all the way up to them?
