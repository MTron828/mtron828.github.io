Chapter 526: The Challenge from a Player

"Sorry, it seems that our conversation will have to be delayed for a bit," Zhao Xu said with a hint of apology.

A reputation is a powerful tool that can summon a hundred responses with just one call.

Even if someone online dares to slander the name "Summer" when no one has ever met Zhao Xu, many strangers will suddenly become fierce defenders of him, spontaneously engaging in arguments with the haters.

Even after the traffic dies down, some people will deliberately create a fan circle, using filtering methods to ensure that only the most loyal and devout fans are left.

Zhao Xu also secretly grumbled to himself about the similarities between the way gods absorb believers and this model.

Initially, the people who gathered around him due to their popularity were treated with favor by the people on the other side of the crossover.

Some of these lucky individuals would eventually become professional players or even get favored by the gods and have a smooth ride. They would have it made and be eating well.

However, those who lack the ability to match their reputation will become stumbling blocks for the gods to harvest faith. Even those without a platform will see their basic foundation constantly slipping away, until they are eventually killed off by a stray arrow.

As for now, Zhao Xu has also received another kind of "red eye".

Just now, they arrived at the Blue Song, and it's no secret that many players followed to watch the commotion. However, no one wants to pay the minimum consumption for the Blue Song, so there are hardly any players who can sneak in as reporters.
Here is the translation of the text:

At this moment, the fountain square in front of the deep blue song is, where a player, dressed in a thick leather armor, is wandering around, playing with the sword in his hand and shouting at the person on the floor above, Zhao Xun.

Seeing Zhao Xun's determination to fight, Cui Lu also expressed concern: "Mr. Zhong Xia, if you agree to this battle, even if you use your life to fight, it won't make a difference. From today on, you will be covered in invitations to fight every day for several months."

It's impossible to climb the rankings without being the first. However, it's a different story in terms of combat. It doesn't mean that whoever is stronger will win. Otherwise, everyone would just compare their levels and go back home.

"Let's do it this way, Mr. Zhong Xia," Cui Lu said. "We'll filter out the first batch. They want to challenge you, but they have to go through our bodies first."

At this point, Zhang Qi, who had been saved by Zhao Xun, was filled with indignation, saying, "What about those dogs and cats, coming to join in the fun?"

"Moreover, they may take advantage of your insufficient magical abilities and use a siege warfare strategy to consume your magical energy. Once Mr. Zhong Xia accepts the challenge, he will inevitably fall into the opponent's trap by refusing to use his magical abilities. It's better to stop it now than to be trapped in the opponent's words."

Cui Lu thought for a moment and then warned, "Or we can ask the opponent to provide a token, and then filter out most of the people who rely on luck."

As she spoke, she couldn't help but look at Zhao Xun, saying, "So, I don't recommend this fight for today."

At this point, Cui Lu's gaze had already fallen on the player in the courtyard below, "Look, he's one of those poor guys who can't even afford 100 gold coins."
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu nodded in agreement, saying, "You all have a point."

However, I will give them an unforgettable experience today. The next player who wants to find their existence by relying on me will likely think deeply, and thank you all for your good intentions. Please, don't worry."

After finishing his sentence, Zhao Xu walked away quickly.

He realized that the challenge from the wanderer had brought these classmate friends, who had only had a superficial relationship with him, to stand behind him, which was the same situation as how Black Cat turned ordinary people into fans.

Soon, Zhao Xu reached the fountain square below, and with the wanderer's loud shout, the players who were unclear about the situation were attracted to come over.

"Mr. Zhong Xia, I know you're currently recognized as the number one player."

"But I won't give up," the wanderer said, licking his face. "So, I'm here to challenge you and prove who is the true number one player in the game."

As he spoke, he looked around at the players who were slowly gathering and increasing in number, and said with confidence: "If I win, I won't need you to acknowledge yourself. I just need you to reveal the method for quick leveling."

Hearing this, the players in the scene started to get excited and cheer, with some even clapping their hands in support.

Zhao Xu, however, raised an eyebrow.

He didn't expect that this unassuming wanderer player was also a master at stirring up emotions.

However, he didn't know one thing.

Arthur also has such a selfless and benevolent nature.

But most of them are powerful, and if they weren't, they would have long since died from the social pressures.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu waved his hand lightly, saying, "I'll just ask one question: is it a matter of life and death?"

As he spoke, he raised an eyebrow and looked at the opponent, saying, "If you can step over my corpse, what conditions do you have to offer?"

"Okay!"

"Big deal!"

"Not worthy of being the number one!"

The players around him also began to whistle, trying to make a bigger noise and attract more attention.

Zhang Qi and the others were also watching Zhao Xu with tense expressions, feeling a sense of unease.

Just this brief interaction had already made them have a good impression of the player "Zhong Xia", and they naturally didn't want him to suffer a setback.

Zhang Qi and the others believed that Zhong Xia could easily defeat the opponent in front of him.

However, what followed was that many players who were eager to challenge the number one player had already gathered.

For the price of a "Revival Stone", they could challenge the number one player once, which was a very attractive offer for these wolves.

The reason why the Jianghu is so cruel is that every year, new people emerge and need to use the blood and reputation of old celebrities to sacrifice to the gods, which is a way for a new generation to bury the old.

The opponent, who had seen Zhao Xu's carefree response, looked concerned, fearing that the rare opportunity would be wasted due to small mistakes.

Zhao Xu, with an expressionless face, said, "You're welcome to come, but to me, it doesn't matter who comes, as long as they don't recognize my authority."
Here is the translation of the text:

When he said that, several ambitious players in the game cheered and were about to jump up to participate. However, they all believed that Zhao Xu would definitely defeat the first challenger and seize the opportunity for themselves. They were more concerned with exhausting the opponent's magical skills.

As long as they defeated "Summer", who would pay attention to whether there was a conspiracy behind them, or if the opponent had exhausted themselves completely?

"That's what you said, Mr. Summer," he said.

The wanderer's face turned red with excitement, and he exclaimed, "Then I'll take my chance!"

As he spoke, his ferocious intent was fully revealed.

Arthur's various mysterious abilities were innumerable, and he didn't believe that Mr. Summer understood all the changes in various professions.

He had honed his ultimate technique for a long time and used it on the first person, which was definitely not a waste.

Thinking about this, the 4th-level wanderer couldn't help but laugh out loud.

"So, I have to..." Suddenly, the wanderer shouted, "Then let's start!"

As he shouted, he had already entered a state of sprinting and was trying to take the initiative.

Meanwhile, Zhao Xu shook his head silently.

He quietly took out a bone staff made of finger bones from his pocket, gently holding it in his palm, and felt the rhythm of death emanating from it.

"Sealing Soul Technique!"
