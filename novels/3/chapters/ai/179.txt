Chapter 180: Within the Tomb

Fortunately, there were no more ambushes by the "Dead Squad" at this abandoned tomb, otherwise, a sudden burst of colorful lights would emerge before a tombstone, and one would be frightened to death on the spot.

To open this infinite-page tome, one needs to assign it a name on the cover. Therefore, Zhao Xu specially wrote the name by hand, which is also a powerful effect of the "Appraisal" spell, a first-grade magic.

For ordinary adventurers, the usual way to understand the effects of a magical equipment is to wear it and feel the enhancements it provides, such as Zhao Xu's "Stellar Cloak". However, for some activation-type magical items, a specific method is required to trigger them, which is usually noted on the item itself, like Zhao Xu's "Invisibility Ring", which has "Tap" written on the inner circle.

As for those without notes, the user must rely on their own experimentation. For example, the "Jumping" ring that enhances jumping ability can only be experienced by actually wearing it and trying to jump.

At this moment, the colorful lights disappeared, and Zhao Xu touched the tome he had named, feeling a sense of fusion and integration.

Zhao Xu lightly opened the tome and looked at the records left by the ancestors of the Andy family, which were directly cleared and erased.

Later, Zhao Xu wrote something on the tome, and it would slowly fade away. However, when he read it, the text would automatically appear again. Zhao Xu remembered that the Andy family's ritual was also said to exist in the legendary library, so he naturally eliminated the specific content of the ritual.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

Until his ancestor Andy brought back the notebook, Zhao Xu had been hesitating, squinting his eyes and reading the words left behind by the other party. From the content, it could be analyzed that the other party had already left the tomb when they recorded this notebook, and most of the content was about distant landscapes and the nostalgia for their hometown.

However, what caught Zhao Xu's attention was the other party's description of the tomb. In the diary, it was recorded that adventurers had explored the tomb and even left behind the remains of adventurers who had died in traps.

Andy's ancestor was able to take back a magical notebook and, by looking at the other party's description, the gain was enormous. Otherwise, there would be no need to send a carriage.

Generally, a large tomb with grave goods could still find treasures and explore the death toll of explorers, indicating that the tomb still had undiscovered treasures.

Especially, the diary left behind a rough map of the tomb's location and a simple drawing of the tomb entrance.

Zhao Xu was lost in thought as he gazed at the drawing.

He had seen the mysterious symbol on the entrance of the tomb before.

When he was transported back to the Dark Ages by Anniya, he saw the priest performing a savage sacrifice, and the other party's face was painted with this symbol.

Could it be that the tomb was an ancient elemental shrine?

Zhao Xu glanced at the location map. The tomb was a month's journey from Mistral. It was not too far, but not close enough for him to go there immediately.

However, Zhao Xu didn't think too much and directly hid the rough map and the image of the tomb entrance on an invisible page in the notebook.

Then, he planned to erase the records of the scenery along the way.

Suddenly, Zhao Xu's eyes narrowed.
Here is the translation of the text:

As an ordinary person, one may not be able to notice the subtle differences, but as the owner of this notebook, Zhao Xu can clearly sense the distinct characteristics of each word.

The two pages of content contain some written text that was particularly laboriously written, but since each page of the notebook is quite thick, it is impossible to discern any marks on the back. However, if one covers the pages with transparent tracing paper and lightly applies a layer of charcoal, the color and depth of the charcoal can be used to determine which words were written with more force.

Zhao Xu doesn't need to use this method, as he can clearly sense the construction and texture of each word in the book, making it easier for him to determine which words were written with more force.

Zhao Xu slowly and carefully assembles the scattered words, in order:

"I've been cursed."
"Don't use the family's inherited summoning ritual!"
"That will summon real demons!"
Zhao Xu suddenly feels a chill run down his back, as if the world has too many summoning rituals.

This means that the man named Andy is deceiving him, and the ritual he saw on the stone tablet at the mysterious shop was not the real thing.

Zhao Xu leaps up and runs in the direction where the five young men disappeared.

At the same time, he takes out the small candle from his pocket that he had lit earlier.

If someone appears at the night cemetery, they will hear a loud "whoosh" of wind and a gust of air blowing past, as if someone is running towards them.

Finally, Zhao Xu runs until he is panting and gasping for breath.

He sees four bodies lying on the ground in front of him, where he had passed by earlier.

At this moment, Zhao Xu's body is invisible, with one hand holding a protective staff and the other holding the candle. He first gives himself a few protective charms, then slowly approaches the bodies.
Here is the translation of the text:

As soon as Zhao Xu approached within a few steps, his hand gripping the staff tightened even more. It was the same group of four men and women who had been sitting around the perimeter of the ritual. However, Andy, the man who had lied to him, had vanished into thin air. Zhao Xu's entire body was now extremely vigilant. Even when he looked at the corpses ahead of him, he remained silent and did not move towards them. His only action was to constantly rub the wick of the "Prayer Candle" with his fingers, which was already covered with flammable sulfur. As long as he lightly pressed it, the "Prayer Candle" would naturally be ignited.

Finally, Zhao Xu decided to use the "Divination" spell on himself. This was a level-one evil spell of the necromancy element, which a righteous priest like him could not use, but could only cast through a ritual. The effect of the spell was similar to "Detection Magic", releasing the spell after which a fan-shaped area with a radius of 10 meters appeared in front of him, covering the four people who were still alive.

Instantly, the spell fed back to him the information of whether each target in the area was alive, their specific state, and whether they were undead. Zhao Xu was not surprised by the result, as he only found four dead bodies ahead of him. At this moment, Zhao Xu no longer dared to make any rash moves, and he could not even guarantee whether Andy was still hiding nearby. From his backpack, Zhao Xu took out a gemstone given to him by Li An and lightly pressed it.

Li An was standing by the stream with a dazed expression, surrounded by two priests and a saint warrior who were crouching down. There were also three "Mystic Guardians" from the "Rose Cross" department, who were all from the same department.
Here is the translation:

The "Rose Crucifix", organized by the Magician's Association and the Goddess Church, is responsible for capturing evil extraterrestrial beings that have invaded King Arthur's realm, particularly those related to demons and devilry.

"I said, old buddy, your luck is too good, isn't it? You're coming out to escort the bunch of noobs and might even get this done." Lian said with a yawn.

The "Rose Crucifix" involves a joint effort between the two organizations, with Lian serving as the liaison between the Association and the Church.

Initially, Lian gave Zhao Xu a gemstone, allowing Zhao Xu to receive information and transmit it back to him if he crushed the gemstone.

However, Zhao Xu used the gemstone for the first time to send a huge achievement to him. Although it woke him up in the middle of the night, it was indeed a remarkable case. Lian's tired thoughts were replaced by calculations of his merits.

"Are these people all doomed?" Zhao Xu asked.

Lian shook his head: "Their souls have been taken away. Unless divine intervention occurs, no one can save them. The demons' methods are also brutal. I didn't expect to encounter such a situation in the vicinity of Mistral."

As he spoke, he glanced at Zhao Xu, "You've become so strong in just a few days, the demons don't dare to face you directly. Otherwise, they would have killed you on the spot and used the four men and women as vessels to continue the ritual later."

Zhao Xu nodded: "You don't need to console me. I'm just not strong enough."

At this moment, Zhao Xu's gaze was fixed on the four bodies that had been collected.

"Honestly, I don't care about consoling you, you little brat." Lian turned his head and looked at the subordinates who were using magic to record the events.
Here is the translation of the text:

"You're no use, no matter how strong you are," Lightning said with a condescending tone, "Someone who can perform such a dangerous ritual summoning is already halfway to the abyss. You can't save them. They'll only die when they're with Andy. When I came, I didn't notice anything unusual. Otherwise, the demons would have been eradicated long ago."

As the deputy of the "Rose Cross" department, Lightning spoke these dejected words with a nonchalant expression.

The nearby pastor, who had been standing nearby, furrowed his brow after hearing Lightning's words, but remembering Lightning's usual style, he restrained himself from speaking out.

Lightning suddenly looked at Zhao Xu with a curious expression, "I haven't explained it to you, but you've already guessed the main point?"

"No, logically, the direction of the creek is not the way back to Mistral, how did you judge that the other side didn't go back to Mistral first?" Zhao Xu said, "After all, it should think it's hidden very well and dare to kill people nearby so boldly."

Lightning couldn't help but reveal a "look of surprise" with a hint of disdain, "Players, logically, can't truly gain knowledge and upgrade their abilities."

Zhao Xu looked at Lightning with a bad temper, "I've been reading books at the library every day."

"I'll go," Lightning said, lowering his voice, "I've forgotten your old identity, so I suppose you're working very hard, how many hours have you been reading recently?"

Lightning had already understood that Zhao Xu was talking about the library.

"18 hours," Zhao Xu said, basically, he had always been holding a book borrowed from that library and reading it.

"Then tell me, how did you guess it?" Lightning suddenly thought of something and asked Zhao Xu.
