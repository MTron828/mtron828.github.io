Chapter 569: The Stormy Nation, Secret Archives of Magic

"Let's go," said Zhao Xu, turning his head and looking at the law seed he had been searching for, which was actually the little girl Zhao Lusi.

From the moment Zhao Xu cast his spell, she had been watching him with her eyes half-opened, looking at the spell he was casting with an expression of incredulity.

Including her brother, who had transformed from a half-beast to a half-human and finally to a human form.

The entire process was like entering a fantasy world, and the magic had instantly satisfied the little girl's innermost fantasies.

However, the little girl Zhao Lusi soon looked at the iron chain on her brother's half-beast body with a hesitant gaze.

Zhao Xu couldn't help but praise her, saying that even at such a young age, she could think so comprehensively. It seemed that she would be an excellent team leader in the future.

At this moment, the player's soul had already entered a new body, and the original body was completely like a dead person.

"Strike technique," Zhao Xu said naturally, not wanting the other party to be confused. He lightly waved his staff.

Suddenly, a mysterious and flexible magical light shot out from the tip of the staff and entered the iron chain, breaking it open in two moves.

In reality, the half-beast could have broken this chain if they had been more intelligent.

Similarly, Zhao Xu could have done it by hand.

However, as a mage, he had already stopped using his hands to do manual labor. A mage's hands were like a pianist's, needing to be protected.

Then Zhao Xu approached Zhao Lusi, preparing to cast a spell to take the little girl away.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Young brother is currently in an uncomfortable state after his body transformation. He will wake up naturally, so you don't need to worry." Just hearing Xu Zhi say this, Zhao Luwei still couldn't bear to look at her brother who had transformed into a human body.

"As for you, if you can become a legendary mage quickly, who knows if you can even return to see the last piece of the dying Earth," Xu Zhi said to everyone.

In reality, he was well aware that among the players, only a handful could actually achieve this.

Xu Zhi had even taken one of the few spots for himself.

Even he had to see if he could break through smoothly, leaving a foundation for later players.

Just then, a brave child from the Earth suddenly shouted, "Mage, can you demonstrate the so-called Eight Major Styles for us?" "Yes," Xu Zhi replied.

Although the child was not Xu Zhi's targeted player, if he could let the Earth-crossing player choose the mage profession, then the mage's territory would become even stronger.

Spreading magical culture was also one of Xu Zhi's future missions.

"Snap!" Xu Zhi snapped his fingers, just like Ansit had done for him before.

Instantly, the surroundings began to change, gradually reverting to the bar scene on Earth before the crossing, where Xu Zhi was at the time.

"Ah! We're back?" "Cried, what's going on?" "Is this magic?" The people who gathered around were all shocked, including the flashing lights on the ceiling and the scent of incense in the air.
Here is the translation of the text:

An elderly man, seemingly impossible to believe, stretched out his hand to touch the leather sofa in front of him, having spent a day apart from it and now touching it again, feeling a strong sense of longing. A loud bang suddenly echoed through the air, and the scene before them began to fade away like a bubble.

The people who had been immersed in this illusion suddenly snapped back to reality.

"This is an illusion," Zhao Xun said, awakening the deep inner consciousness of each person.

Just moments ago, he had used the "Sea City Mirage" spell to change the surrounding scenery.

Compared to the "Illusion" spell, the "Sea City Mirage" was more impressive and provided a sense of touch and smell, making it even more captivating.

"Just now, I used the Reincarnation spell to restore the player's body to its original form, which is the power of the Transformation System."

"As for now, this is the power of the Plasticity System," he said, pointing to the hundred-year-old giant tree behind him and making a slashing motion with his hand.

Suddenly, a static electricity surged through the air, causing several people's hair to stand on end.

Next, a 30-meter-high, 10-story-high residential building suddenly emerged from the sky, with a rooftop location.

Then, a six-meter-wide, thick lightning bolt struck down.

Accompanied by the intense sound of breaking air, the lightning illuminated everyone's face, and their hearts were shaken.

To intimidate the crowd and expand the number of wizards, Zhao Xun directly used the War Magic.

The lightning bolt, which was previously a three-ring spell, had upgraded to the four-ring spell "War Lightning".

On the battlefield, it would sweep everything away without a word.
Here is the translation:

That rugged width is equivalent to three beds being connected together, and it looks like a mesh of electricity from a distance.

In the end, Zhao Xu showed a few effects and, based on his own feelings, elaborated on his views about the Eight Great Factions, and then brought the little girl back to Yalan and handed her over to the core personnel.

He also rushed to the next target immediately.

However, Zhao Xu didn't notice that under his ability to use verbal manipulation, his 24-level deception and negotiation skills were still exerting their power.

Even though most people didn't know the significance of what Zhao Xu was saying, only those who were familiar with the game would nod in understanding, and the crowd's understanding of the wizard's intentions had reached a new level.

As for those who were watching, they wouldn't know until the next day that the mysterious wizard had shown them a level of magic that was terrifying.

...From a female perspective, Zhao Xu would always prioritize selecting female targets.

Initially, the crossover period was extremely chaotic, and no one could predict whether they would be injured due to unexpected circumstances. Therefore, Zhao Xu decided to prioritize finding female targets, and then male targets.

At this moment, he was attracted to a very magical aura, even though it was far away. He could sense this spiritual pressure, so he didn't hesitate to teleport closer.

However, in the brief moment when he was bringing the little girl back, the dark sky above the wilderness had turned dark and cloudy.

Even during the day, the surrounding scenery had decreased to a new level, as if night had fallen prematurely.
Zhao Xu had approached the new campsite, only to find everyone busy searching for a way to escape the rain. The entire camp was in a state of chaos, with no one paying attention to him, a stranger. This kind of black cloud would normally make people stay indoors, not venture out. "Ding dong." Suddenly, a drop of rain fell.

So quickly? It had only been ten minutes since the dark clouds appeared. Zhao Xu couldn't have imagined that the storm would arrive so suddenly.

If he didn't know the weather pattern of the desolate wasteland, he would have thought it was an act of divine intervention.

At this moment, the people in the campsite felt the gentle patter of raindrops falling, and their faces changed from calm to anxious. They immediately abandoned their work and rushed to prepare for the rain.

After a day of wandering, let alone finding basic food, a sudden heavy rain would be a disaster that would knock the whole human order back to the Stone Age.

Except for a few lucky ones who found a place to hide, most people would be drenched and catch a cold.

"Huala!" The first heavy rainstorm after the apocalypse, which had been looming over the earth, finally arrived.

"Don't be a fool, run for your life!" A pedestrian carrying a bundle of reeds looked at Zhao Xu, who was still standing there, not helping or running, and shouted loudly.

Zhao Xu could only smile wryly and lifted his staff:

"The Li Yuan Secret Museum."

As a mage, there was no option to be rained to death.
