Chapter 468: Malicious Shape-Shifting: Oooh

As the entire team led by Freya approached the city of Orlo, everyone was in a daze, not knowing what had happened.

The group of white dragons swooping down on them without hesitation, releasing their dragon aura, had almost no one able to maintain a calm and composed state.

The fear emanating from the soul had caused the guards, who had lost their weapons and were furious, to sink into a state of panic.

Although they didn't lose consciousness, they had already forgotten everything that had happened.

"This is what it feels like to be under the dragon's aura?"

"Isn't it supposed to be that players are immune to this kind of psychological influence?"

One player who had never experienced something like this before was still in a daze.

"Don't be silly, it's just that the game doesn't allow NPCs to know your thoughts and memories, but it doesn't mean you can't be affected by most psychological fears."

"I see, I didn't expect the game to be this intense. That's why those people said it's a must-try to experience fear, trembling, and other negative states. Now that I think about it, it's just too intense, even scarier than a haunted house."

"What about you?"

"My brain directly generated a terrifying scene: a person wandering aimlessly in an endless dark road, and then hearing strange footsteps behind them. At that time, I almost fainted from fear."
Here is the translation of the text:

"Well, it seems like it's playing out a scene of fear for each individual. When I was thinking back, I remembered when I got caught playing with my phone during class, and the fear of having my phone taken away made me not know what was happening outside. When I came to my senses, those NPCs had already fled."

"Shh, quiet down. You didn't see that, did you? Those NPC guards were originally afraid and shocked by that mage's 'fireball' technique, and now they're almost worshiping him as a god. This experience of soloing the White Dragons and escaping unscathed is something that can be exchanged for a high-ranking position in the alliance. And according to the announcement from 'Elder's Mansion', this guy is still the number one player in the game, and he's still a mage. This is too terrifying. I don't know how he leveled up."

"Yeah, I'm about to burst from holding it in, I really want to log off and post this message on the forum. I thought he might have some secret technique before leveling up, but this experience of fleeing from over ten White Dragons, mom, legendary players are not this strong."

"You'd better hurry up, I think Old Bell from the Patrol Guest House also wants to post this message, let's see who gets to it first."

These two players who have been whispering to each other are unaware that their conversation has been heard by Zhao Xu, who is discussing the target.

Orlu City is the capital of the Northern Alliance and is situated by the small port developed around the "Eternal River". By leveraging the cargo capacity of the "Unfrozen River" that flows from the ice mountain range to the sea, Orlu City has easily facilitated trade with many key cities along the river.

After giving Zhao Xu the gemstone that had accumulated all the remaining power of her legendary skill "Dragon Tribe Attack", An Ti Nuo Ya left before reaching Orlu City.

According to her words, she went to visit someone first, and then confirmed some things, and will come back to find Zhao Xu when she's done.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu, who had obtained the "Giant Dragon's Fury", also possessed the ability to dominate the heavens and earth, which helped him overcome the predicament of facing the "Thousand-Man Army" siege. Even if noble aristocrats who were unwilling to compromise wanted to intercept him, it would be impossible for them to do so unless they mobilized tens of thousands of cavalry and combined them with elite magic teams. Otherwise, they would be unable to block Zhao Xu.

"Summer Wizard, don't worry, after we enter the city, I will immediately contact the Tangde leader and ensure that no one will offend you inexplicably," Frayel said, his voice low and gentle as he approached on horseback, his eyes gazing at the horse-drawn carriage.

As he rode, he couldn't help but look at the carriage with a hint of longing in his eyes, as if the person inside was still present.

After Anniya's disappearance, he had realized that the mysterious woman wizard in front of him was at least a five-ring wizard, which made her a stalwart member of the wizarding community, equivalent to a high-level wizard. This realization only added to Frayel's excitement.

"I'm not too concerned about this," Zhao Xu replied, lifting his hand to stop Vivia from unsheathing her sword. "No need to hurry."

On the side, the white dragon Sylus gazed at Zhao Xu with a calculating and cunning expression.

After Anniya's departure, the "necklace" that had been tightly wrapped around her neck was finally loosened, allowing her to take a few deep breaths.

Although the Summer Wizard had obtained the "Decree" that could condemn her to death, Sylus was not fooled. He had already sensed that this young wizard was not the kind of ruthless killer who would unleash his magic at the slightest provocation and cause her to die on the spot. Therefore, he could gradually probe the bottom line of these righteous people.
Here is the translation of the text:

As for the bodyguard, Serus has already understood that it is being sustained by someone along the way, so it's reluctantly accepting it.

"Hey, kid, did you really get that divine artifact?"

At this moment, Serus had a piece of straw in his mouth, and his legs had already kicked up to the position where Anniya was sitting.

To be honest, without the "Dragon's Pearl" that repels dragons, even if the air is as cold as ice, it still has that taste of freedom.

"Get your legs off," Zhao Xu gave a disdainful glance at the white dragon Serus, who was trying to grasp the sword in his hand, but used even more force.

"Kid, I'm telling you," Serus, the white dragon, seemed to be having trouble breathing, and took a few deep breaths, "from now on, I'll take you to explore the red light district of Orlo City, and I guarantee you'll feel the thrill of it."

"You're still a child, aren't you? As a projection of the Earth player, do you have that ability? Although I've seen you rarely steal glances, I've never seen your bodyguard."

Saying that, he looked down at Viviya, who had restored her tank top outfit, and his gaze didn't even linger on her figure. It was no wonder she didn't attract attention.

"When you return, you'll have to thank Serus Old Man, because other towns don't have as many foreign women as Orlo City has. Even if you have a unique taste, you want to find a dwarfâ€”"

Just as Serus finished speaking, he saw Zhao Xu's finger pointing at him.

Before the finger could reach him, a metal scepter with a gemstone on top suddenly appeared in his palm.

"The touch of secondary frost."

With the extended short distance, the scepter just touched the white dragon's chest.
Here is the translation of the text:

Sirus suddenly felt that something was off.
He saw the white dragon, which had once been full of vigor, with its limbs stiff and rigid, as if they had been poured into cement. The dragon's deliberate posture, which had once been so difficult to maintain, had caused it to lose its balance and fall heavily onto the floor of the carriage.

At this time, the "Sirus" who had fallen into a helpless state could only watch as its "agility attribute" was completely reduced to zero.
Although the white dragon had evolved from a young dragon to a dragon of old, its clumsiness had prevented it from increasing its agility attribute, which had remained at 10 points for a long time.

However, the four-ring wizard, Sirus, who had not even summoned any artifacts, had somehow reduced its agility to zero with just a light touch.
Sirus, who had lost all ability to act, was even more pitiful than being "frozen" by someone else. It was filled with consciousness, but was powerless to resist.

All it could do was cruelly watch as it "waited to die".
It couldn't understand why its "immunity" and "spell resistance" had both failed, with no trace of resistance left.
It was as if the opponent's spell had ignored "immunity" and "spell resistance" altogether.

Sirus shook its head to dispel this absurd thought.
If such a spell really existed, the monsters of King Arthur would have been destroyed long ago.
"Agility 10 is the norm for most living beings."
"This twenty-some rounds, reflect on the reason slowly, or I'll continue to add this spell."
"One-ringed spell, I'm still playing with it."
Just then, Freyr thought that Anniya had returned and couldn't help but come over to ask in surprise, "What's going on?"
Here is the translation of the text:

"It's just that my bodyguard fell down," Zhao Xu explained. "Thank you for your concern, but it's not a big deal."

At this point, the vehicle had slowly entered the city gate of Aurou, and even Frey didn't need to intervene. The guards who had gone to support him were, in themselves, the best credentials.

Their carriage didn't even need to undergo a basic inspection, and it smoothly reached the core area of Aurou. The surrounding children were even pulled away by their parents, avoiding these towering snow-covered warhorses.

Zhao Xu was looking at the white dragon Saurus, who was trying to resist but couldn't move. He whispered, "If you continue to resist, I'll have to use some special methods."

"Like turning into a toad that can only make a 'lonely' sound?" Zhao Xu threatened in a detached tone.

Saurus, however, showed a disdainful expression.

Indeed, after arriving at the Four Rings, Zhao Xu had mastered a new spell that was limited only by imagination - the Four Rings Transformation Art.

It was not the Golden Dragon, which was born with the ability to transform, but Saurus. Through a series of transformations, he could change into a human form to accompany a few people.

The Transformation Art, however, was even more powerful, allowing it to transform into other species and even inherit the attributes of the previous three worlds. The effectiveness of this spell was entirely dependent on the imagination.
However, Saurus was clear that the Transformation Art required the target's voluntary consent. It was impossible to force someone to transform into a toad.

Unbeknownst to Zhao Xu, he took out a scroll of magic from his pocket at this moment.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Although I'm not a five-ring mage, it doesn't hinder me from casting five-ring magic."

As he spoke, he waved his hands over the scroll inscribed with arcane symbols, saying, "This is a five-ring spell, a transformation spell of malice, and it has a permanent duration."

In the legend of King Arthur, those witches could transform innocent children into animals using this "malice transformation spell".

"Can you be confident that your exemption can resist?" Zhao Xu asked.

At this moment, the White Dragon Serus finally recalled that the mage in front of him had a terrifying level of magical prowess, and his resistance was no match for it.

As for the even more formidable Anzhiya, I don't know how many weakening exemption spells he has bestowed upon this summer wizard.

It almost wanted to beg for mercy, thinking that if it could only be with those toad mothers in the future, it would rather permanently lose this ability.

"Haha, you'll be waiting for a lifetime to sing the 'solitary' song for those lovers, Odai," Zhao Xu laughed.

At this moment, he was about to intimidate the White Dragon again when he noticed that the carriage in front had stopped.
