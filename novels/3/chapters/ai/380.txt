Chapter 381: No Trace of Murder

As someone fell to the ground, the onlookers who had been watching the group of adventurers with envy suddenly changed color, their instincts for survival urging them to look towards their family members' direction.

Some quick-thinking parents immediately picked up their sleeping children and hugged them tightly.

"Ah!" someone exclaimed, "He's dead!"

Pandemonium erupted, with the crowd surging forward like ripples on a lake. Even those who were slow to react joined in, rushing to the aid of these powerful adventurers.

Among the adventurers gathered around the deceased, most looked grim-faced.

As professionals with skills, they could see their own character cards and were not easily startled like ordinary people. Although death was not common, they would not be shocked to the same extent as ordinary people.

At this point, a few people approached and dragged the lifeless body of the wandering minstrel away from the fire pit. A mage nearby used their "Frost Beam" to extinguish the flames.

As the clock struck dawn, they began to waste no time and started casting spells. A novice priest knelt down, using their amateur medical skills to examine the body, then stood up and shook his head in dismay, saying, "He's dead."

ViViAn also approached, examining the body and nodding to Zhao Xu, indicating that the body had been cold for more than an hour.

The eerie feeling of being near a corpse for a while sent shivers down the spines of ordinary people, but did not faze the adventurers.
Here is the translation of the text:

More professionals gathered around, repeatedly crouching down to inspect the deceased bard. Outside the wilderness, any experienced adventurer would believe their own judgment and would not hastily accept the conclusions of other teams. Therefore, the bard would not be able to deceive anyone unless he used a fake death spell. However, after reaching this conclusion, everyone looked at each other in silence.

They sat around the bonfire, having spent at least a few hours there. The deceased was not in the center, but not too far away either. It was as if someone had killed him in front of everyone! At this moment, another warrior who had worked as a forensic examiner in a church also stood up, calling a few people to lift the body into the tent and begin a basic external examination of the wounds.

The others could only wait outside the tent, keeping a watchful eye on the surrounding situation. If he had died at home, it would be considered a sudden death. However, having lost his life in this desolate wasteland, it was as if he was carrying some kind of mysterious aura.

Vivian had already taken out the sacred avenger from her hand, the sword shining brightly in the firelight as it flashed across each person's face. "Poor kid, he had just become a professional bard a month ago and was saving up to go back home and get married. And then he met such an unfortunate fate."

Another bard who had traveled with the deceased looked on, feeling emotional. When Vivian spoke, the other adventurers in the wasteland also felt a sense of shared sorrow, their hearts burning like the burning embers in the fire, constantly crackling and popping.

"I feel like I'm unable to log out safely," a player suddenly exclaimed in shock.
Here is the translation of the text:

It seemed like everyone was in a daze, as if they were outside observers watching their own character panels. "What?" Zhao Xu suddenly realized that the "safe logout" button had disappeared.

The only remaining button was "force logout", which seemed to be mocking the players who thought they could just leave the game. Safe logout was a normal way for players to leave the game, staying in one place for five minutes without making any intense movements after a battle.

However, players were not allowed to logout when they were in a critical state. But they could still choose to force logout. In that case, the character would remain in the same location, like a vegetable with no consciousness.

"It feels like a fierce battle," said the highest-level 3-star warrior in the scene, sizing up the crowd as if trying to guess something. Meanwhile, Zhao Xu remained silent.

He had never thought that this desolate wasteland would be so extraordinary, with even the slightest disturbance causing the system to judge them as being in a dangerous state where safe logout was impossible.

In the four months since the game's launch, many players had experienced this same situation without receiving any damage or even seeing monsters. They were in the same predicament as Zhao Xu.

As players who knew the truth explained the situation, other players gradually calmed down.

In the end, they had no choice but to force logout. But in this desolate wasteland, it was no different from giving up on reviving with a revival stone.

In the past, over 60% of players who experienced the same situation had ultimately died.
Here is the translation of the text:

Because they cannot quietly log off, it means the place they are in is extremely dangerous.

"I don't think it's possible to silently kill someone," said the 3rd-level warrior, Ten Steps One Sword, who had just introduced himself and tried to grasp the main thread of the current situation, even if it was just from the player's perspective.

"Are you suspecting that there's a traitor among us? Is someone plotting revenge?" someone asked.

Ten Steps One Sword laughed confidently, "We'll know whether there's a traitor or not after the autopsy."

"You know what you're talking about, but it won't make a difference and you're not entitled to make decisions," another 3rd-level player, a wanderer, countered, looking at Vi Vi.

It was clear that the strongest one in the scene was the female knight who seemed to be a Saint Warrior.

As for who had a sharper sword, naturally the one who spoke up had more authority.

"What's your name?" Ten Steps One Sword asked, his brow slightly furrowed, slightly displeased at the wanderer's repeated interruptions.

"Bloodshed," the wanderer said nonchalantly.

As the wanderer spoke, Ten Steps One Sword's companion immediately explained, and the other party was also one of the top-ranked wanderers in the city of Luca.

As for the higher-ranking wanderers, most of them had already exchanged revival stones.

However, the warrior was calm and collected, without the ability to sneak attack, and had lost the influence of the sneak attack damage that had previously tipped the balance of victory, so what could he do?

He synchronized the withdrawal of his battle axe from his back and intended to educate the wanderer on who had harder fists.
Here is the translation:

However, the warrior who went in to examine the body came out of the tent, his face grave, shaking his head, "There are no wounds on the body."

"And a simple toxicology analysis also doesn't suggest poisoning."

In an instant, the suspicion in almost everyone's eyes was alleviated.

They didn't have anyone in the group who could perform a stealth attack, unless they used magic, and even then, it was impossible to kill someone silently.

"It's the Corpse King." Suddenly, one of the Arthurian adventurers from Luca City couldn't help but shout, "The Corpse King has come to exact revenge."

"Don't be ridiculous," said the caravan leader, High Earl, "The news of the Corpse King has not been heard in over ten years. Luca City has concluded that the Corpse King was either killed or left."

"Corpse King?"

At this moment, the players, hearing this unfamiliar term, couldn't help but look at each other in surprise and curiosity.

【As an adventurer, you make a knowledge (local) check and succeed, obtaining the following information about the Corpse King.】

In an instant, all the legends about the Corpse King in the Desolate Graveyard were revealed, and Zhao Xu quickly read through them.

The Corpse King is a lone killer who has been attacking travelers and merchants on the road, constantly killing people in his rampage.

His method of killing is extremely unique, as he kills people while they are sleeping or in a daze, making it seem like they died suddenly with no signs of struggle or injury.

It wasn't until the frequency of deaths in the Desolate Graveyard became too high and the causes of death were all the same that people began to notice these cases of death.
Here is the translation of the text:

At that time, the entire wasteland was filled with danger, and no merchants dared to venture forth. Later, after the investigation by the city of Luca, it was confirmed that there was a murderer, who was named the "Corpse Demon".

However, when the city of Luca called in powerful wizards and priests to help capture the "Corpse Demon", the criminal record suddenly stopped at 10 years ago.

As a result, people gradually forgot about the mysterious murderer who had once struck fear into the hearts of the people of the wasteland. If only a few people, including Zhao Xu, knew the information about the "Corpse Demon", everything would have to rely on Zhao Xu's "knowledge and skills".

However, in the current state of confusion, the most lacking thing is people. Suddenly, a brave warrior who had participated in the Corps Demon's reign of terror when he was a courier, stood up to recount the history of that time. The account was consistent with the information Zhao Xu had obtained.

The warrior shook his head, "There were no signs of physical decay or old age on the bodies of the deceased. They were like the poet who had just passed away peacefully in his sleep, with no signs of struggle or suffering."

"Have any ideas?" Zhao Xu asked, using his "mind-reading" ability to communicate with Selena, who had a demonic background.

"This method is similar to the tactics of evil beings like us," Selena said with a hint of self-mockery, without any embarrassment.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu also agrees, even if she is a vampire like Vivian, she doesn't have such a direct killing method.

Vampires kill by transforming, like attracting a man with a sweet kiss and then using the "absorption of energy" supernatural ability through the process of kissing, directly causing the opponent to lose all "1-level" life energy.

The kiss of the flower fairy is expensive, while the kiss of a vampire is worthless, which is the logic.

Even if Vivian has become a pure and virtuous vampire saint warrior, she still retains the ability to educate perverts.

After kissing, vampires will also use their own free magic "hypnosis" to ask if they want an additional kiss.

Until death.

So Vivian asks if there are any signs of aging, whether there is physical damage or life force absorption.

"Vivian?"
Suddenly, Zhao Xu realized something.

As a pure and virtuous saint warrior, Vivian will not change her vampire nature.

The alien creature living in the evil camp outside the dimensional boundary is called a demon because even if its camp changes, it remains a malevolent subspecies.

Vampires are chaotic subspecies, malevolent subspecies.

This means that when calculating the camp aspect, she will also be counted in.

"So, aren't you eating the four thieves?" Zhao Xu asked.

Vivian nodded slightly with a hint of bitterness at this moment. This is what is required to carry the thorns of righteousness.

Vivian is counted as chaotic and malevolent subspecies, but she is also a saint warrior, belonging to the "order", "good" camp.
Here is the translation of the text:

So, the "abusive language" that attacks the evil camp outside can harm the demon, and the "holy language" that attacks the good camp outside can also harm her. Moreover, the true spells of the two major camps are not worth mentioning.

Similarly, the defensive spells of the four major camps that protect evil can all take effect on her.

As for the legendary "Cleave Good", "Cleave Evil", "Cleave Disorder", and "Cleave Chaos", Vivian can devour all four.

This has caused Arthur, who is extremely particular about his camp, to be utterly defeated in this aspect.

At that moment, the people around him kept recalling the story of the " Corpse Demon", and even some civilians who had experienced or heard about it ten years ago were invited to come and tell their stories.

However, they themselves were also somewhat embarrassed, and their recollections were fragmented and scattered, so everyone didn't gain much.

"Just no first-hand data?" The warrior complained, unable to bear it.

"These contents are all sealed, and the official of Luca City may still know." The butler said, originally not believing that the Corpse Demon had returned, but was now getting increasingly anxious.

"When the investigation was completed, it disappeared, and the initial report of the Corpse Demon was never published, leaving everyone in the dark about what the Corpse Demon was."

The forensic officer said, sitting on the ground with a pipe filled with tobacco in his mouth.

"What method can achieve such a silent and deadly effect?" The butler asked, looking up at the adventurers.

Meanwhile, the civilians standing afar were all too nervous to sleep, each looking at this side, hoping that these powerful adventurers could solve the problem.

After hearing the story of the Corpse Demon, no one dared to sleep at that moment.
Here is the translation:

Just hearing the butler's inquiry, even the most adventurous players who are usually full of energy are left scratching their heads, with no intention of making a hasty start.

"It might be an instant death effect,"

Suddenly, Zhao Xu looked at the tent where the corpse was placed in the shadow, and his voice, though not loud, pierced through the fog, echoing in each person's heart.
