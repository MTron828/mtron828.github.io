Chapter 291: Harvest of Divine Power

After Zhao Xu finished shouting, his entire body stiffened, and he was suddenly split into countless energy streams that flowed into the teleportation portal.

Immediately, his consciousness reassembled outside a grand and majestic cathedral, but the cathedral looked as if it was constructed from countless corpses, presenting a gruesome and eerie sight.

"This is the White Bone Cathedral of the God of Death," Lacis explained.

Before Zhao Xu could enter the cathedral, he saw the originally calm sky suddenly erupt into a brilliant white light, like a bolt of lightning striking down. The massive energy converged into a portal to another dimension.

The association's mages finally arrived on the scene.

Sensitive to the disturbance, the cathedral's originally closed doors suddenly swung open, and a beam of white light emerged once more. Suddenly, the legendary undead creatures that Zhao Xu had killed in another world line began to appear one by one.

Two and a half gods of magic, one dragon mage, and a half-god mummy stood at the forefront, followed by legendary undead creatures such as the ghost of fire, the shadow of emptiness, and others.

It can be said that all the legendary undead creatures of the "Land of the Slumberers" gathered in the cathedral, all waiting for the opportunity to become gods since the beginning.

Zhao Xu didn't hesitate at all, and directly exhausted the remaining three "senses of death" in this instant.

At this moment, his right eye even condensed some residual godly power, causing the ordinary undead creatures around the temple to feel the power and kneel down in worship.
Here is the translation of the text:

The legendary immortal beings paid close attention to Zhao Xu's every move, with countless cold and malevolent gazes sweeping past him from in front of him. Originally, they had been determined to launch a fatal attack on him after seeing the "Lord of the Dead" tattoo on his hand. However, at this moment, the Celestial Academy had opened nine portals to other realms, foreshadowing a massive battle that would soon break out. As a result, none of the legendary immortals dared to attack Zhao Xu first, and instead, they all hesitated to take the initiative.

Zhao Xu's heart skipped a beat as he realized the situation. At first, he had been doomed to die, as the legendary immortals had all agreed to attack him together, with each one being controlled by a different force. However, this time, the legendary mages intervened in the battle, and none of them dared to lose their initiative.

Zhao Xu seized the rare opportunity and used his magic, "Secondary Swift Explosion," before rushing into the church that had just been opened by the giant dragon's skeleton door. Only at this moment, when the legendary mages descended, did the giant dragon's skeleton door, which had never been opened by Zhao Xu's own efforts, finally open.

Zhao Xu knew that before using the "Lord of the Dead" tattoo, his threat level in the situation was not inferior to that of the legendary mages. However, due to his own fragility, the legendary immortals believed that they could easily eliminate him, and therefore, they did not immediately attack him. Just as Zhao Xu was rushing into the giant dragon's skeleton door at full speed, he suddenly discovered that the "Godly Devourer" was hovering in the grand hall of the church, completely unaffected by the situation, and was the last guardian.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu's target, the "Amber Coffin", was placed in the front hall at this time, with all the death god statues surrounding it having been shattered. Above the skylight in the center of the room, a sculpture of the death god was carved, and under the light of the lamp, the entire light beam fell directly onto the "Amber Coffin" in the middle.

When Zhao Xu saw this scene, he suddenly raised his arm and shouted at the grotesque, drooling corpse of the "Demonic Witherer" in front of him: "In the name of the God of Slaughter, I command the undying creature before me!"

At that moment, the superhuman energy emanating from the "Soul Master" pulsed out from Zhao Xu's hand and struck the "Demonic Witherer" directly.

"Stupid." However, the "Demonic Witherer" sneered at Zhao Xu with a mind-reading taunt just as Zhao Xu finished shouting. But Zhao Xu had already fallen into the aftermath of the "Secondary Rapid Explosion" spell, and was now stumbling.

The energy left by the God of Slaughter transformed into a binding web of energy flows that wrapped around the "Demonic Witherer", constantly harassing it, but was also resisted by the opponent's divine nature, resulting in a stalemate.

However, the lingering energy of the God of Slaughter ultimately took control of the "Demonic Witherer".

"Rakshasa, take action!" Zhao Xu mentally commanded, his heart racing.

Rakshasa transformed into a beam of light that shot out and attached itself to the "Amber Coffin", seizing the opportunity when the "Demonic Witherer" lost control. She then activated her assimilation ability to tear down a piece of power from the residual divine energy of the death god.

At that moment, the entire temple began to shake violently.

This was also the final, most devastating blow struck by the God of Slaughter after Zhao Xu used his third divine mark.
Here is the translation:

Zhao Xu also forced himself to observe the "Soul Devourer".
He didn't expect the power of the "Overlord of the Wraith" to be able to control the soul devourer for a long time.
After waiting for six seconds for the dizziness to pass, he directly activated the "Departure" intention and infused it into the soul devourer.
However, just as he issued the command, he heard a voice coming from the back of his head: "Pure".
A huge pain spread from the back of his neck to his chest, as if glass had shattered.
Zhao Xu suddenly realized that he couldn't even breathe, and he saw a zombie-like, blue, sharp claw piercing through his chest, with a drop of scorching hot blood dripping from the claw.
He turned his head back, and a blue-skinned, skeletal figure with a skull-like face, covered in icy skin, looked at him with a cruel gaze. The figure only had a skull without any flesh, just a skull-shaped head.
Winter Ghost, also known as Frostbite Witch, is a level 23 undead creature created by a half-god witch to pursue the ultimate art of soul manipulation.
However, Zhao Xu was laughing and closing his eyes, already feeling Lakisha returning to his body.
【Adventurer Zhong Xia, you have received fatal injuries and are on the brink of death.】
【Adventurer Zhong Xia, you have failed to resist the Winter Ghost's "Wilted Flame" ability (difficulty 35), and have permanently lost 4 points of constitution.】
【Adventurer Zhong Xia, you have acquired the "Steel Will" prestige ability】
Just as Zhao Xu closed his eyes.

The "Soul Devourer" also recovered at this moment, but it let out a sharp cry, wanting to escape with the "Husk of Amber", but it was unable to do so.
Here is the translation of the text:

At this moment, the massive and majestic temple's dome had been effortlessly removed, replaced by a colossal black destruction ball. Its enormous size was awe-inspiring, with its surface radiating an aura of destruction and extinction. Wherever it went, everything was left in ruins, as if it had been annihilated. The temple's dome had been directly removed by this destruction ball.

Any object or living being that came into contact with it would be affected by the "Separation Technique". The "Soul Shrinking Sorcerer" was not afraid of this legendary technique, but this space was completely sealed off, and the "Amber Coffin" was also sealed by the combined efforts of the "Soul Shrinking Sorcerer", which was not something that could be controlled by one person alone.

The "Soul Shrinking Sorcerer" could only let out a fierce cry of indignation and then flew away, hiding in the vast black hole of destruction. Meanwhile, the few half-god witches above the temple had already retreated to a distant location, gazing coldly at the black destruction ball, which was nearly 100 meters in diameter and directly covering the entire temple.

"This is crazy," even those who knew the formidable strength of the highest-ranking woman couldn't help but be silent when they saw the opponent's opening move was a legendary technique of such high intensity.

"Are you, Anzhi Noya, using a new 'Legendary Technique'?" a legendary mage floated beside Anzhi Noya and asked.

"Destruction of the Abyss," Anzhi Noya looked at the effect of her "Legendary Technique" and nodded slightly in satisfaction.

At this moment, the black destruction ball below and the temple were being flattened, and it had even sunk into the ground. However, the ball itself seemed to possess an extremely corrosive property, and nothing could block it. The massive ball continued to descend, devouring everything it touched.
Here is the translation of the given text into English:

"You're making it hard for us. This spell also has a teleportation effect on things that can't be separated, right? So, the divine aura of the Grim Reaper, I don't know where it's going to end up."

Another legendary mage floated over and sighed, "Ordinary things will naturally be separated, but that divine aura will randomly be teleported to one corner of Arthur's many faces. When the gods of war come, it will always appear."

Anastasia spoke lightly, as if she didn't care that she had accidentally sent away a divine aura that could be obtained.

...Zhao Xu slowly opened his eyes and found himself in the temple.

But seeing the familiar saint's mark of the goddess of magic among the surrounding priests, he breathed a sigh of relief. The legendary mage from the cooperative had finally come to his aid, helping him destroy the White Bone Temple.

As a result, he didn't have to be reincarnated in the "Sleeping Ground" of the Anata City.

At this time, there were many players who had just been revived, still muttering grievances about their recent misfortunes.

Zhao Xu, on the other hand, looked calm, taking stock of his own state.

He almost spat out blood when he saw that his permanent loss of 4 body points due to the supernatural power of the Winter Ghost.

Luckily, he had a way to remove the "Prayer Spell" and "Miracle Spell" restrictions.

It was no wonder that he felt extremely weak after waking up, with only 10 body points, not much different from the earthlings. However, Zhao Xu's gaze was completely absorbed by the item in his inventory - the fragments of the Grim Reaper's divine aura.
