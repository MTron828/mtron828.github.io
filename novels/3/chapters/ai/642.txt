Chapter 643: Loving the Error Era

"Don't blame me for always setting traps for you. For thousands of years, I've seen far too many foolish people who claim to have no desire for the divine."

The Heavenly Envoy reminisced, "They claim to be promoting peace in this world, and that they are willing to kill evil at any cost. However, when the opportunity really presents itself, and they see the divine intent, which reflects the deepest desires of every person's heart like a mirror, what's left are only empty words and pretenses."

Zhao Xu paused, hesitant, "Can you explain the prophecy in more detail? Just how strict is this requirement, that not even the God of Death can escape?"

"The angels, divine beings from the heavenly realm, do not have gender distinctions, or they can change at will," the Heavenly Envoy explained. "It's not a problem for gods, and many gods' incarnations already have both male and female forms."

"The key point is that the prophecy reveals that the future God of Death is female, which means that all the current rulers' hopes are dashed."

"A seemingly ridiculous, yet extremely serious reason. You can deceive yourself, but you cannot deceive fate."

Zhao Xu was left with only a sense of lamentation at this moment.

It seems that the gods truly believe this prophecy about the future seven main gods, and they may even dare to remake the world because of the conditions. And the Heavenly Envoy is confident, without a shred of doubt, that he is not worried about his impulsiveness, and it's likely because of this!

Combining the trait that the God of Death cannot be revived, it's basically certain that if a male takes on this divine intent, he will probably die halfway through.
Here is the translation:

"What are the two items that can make Death God Li Tao's powers stagnant?" Zhao Xu continued to ask.

"I think you should know that those two items have already disappeared into the flow of history," said the Human Heaven, muttering to himself.

"Are they the eyes and palms?"

Zhao Xu thought back to the critical keywords and couldn't help but be astonished, "Could it be that they are the set of high-level combination artifacts?"

"No, it's not that. After Death God Nael defeated the strongest evil wizard, Victor, he obtained Victor's high-level artifacts, including his Eye of Magic and Magic Hand."

The Eye of Magic and Magic Hand have been sought after by countless wizards and evil sorcerers, who are trying to find clues in the ancient history that has been lost to time. Even in the legendary library, the records of these artifacts are vague and unclear.

Zhao Xu also knew that in order to use these artifacts, he had to remove his own eyeballs and install the magical eyes, then cut off his palms and replace them with the magical palms.

According to legend, each of these artifacts has its own functions, and when combined, they can even give birth to a powerful and destructive force that can destroy the world.

"In the beginning, Death God's powers were divided into seven parts, three of which were taken by other gods, including the magic goddess Sisilvina, which you believe in. The remaining four parts were divided into one part for the artificial Death God, one part for Victor's Magic Hand, one part for the Sleepers' Land, and one part for myself."

"One of the fragments of Death God's powers in the Sleepers' Land has the attribute of automatically returning, which is also the hidden trick left by Death God to attract strong individuals in the future to become Death God and attract attention. This includes the artificial Death God, which was used as a backup plan, but was interfered with by you."
Here is the translation of the text:

"Even if you didn't isolate yourself at the time and directly became a new death deity, then the killing god Edmond would be your predecessor. Initially, he also obtained the method of entering the land of the dead from the old priest and eventually became a god, only to die later.

Zhao Xu's gaze jumped slightly at this moment.

The artificial death god retrieved the "divine fragment" from Zheng Xin'an and combined it with its own fragment, making it already two-thirds complete.

The third fragment was hidden in the "Heavenly Paradise" held in his hand.

At this moment, the Heavenly Paradise emitted a dazzling golden light, as if a wing of heaven, stretching endlessly.

"This divine fragment was also given to you. From now on, I will no longer bear this fate. Wait until my vitality is restored, and I will be reborn."

Suddenly, the golden light scattered and converged into the "star crystal" hovering between the two, containing divine fragments.

After parting with his most important possession, the Heavenly Paradise was filled with an endless sense of fatigue.

"Any deity corresponds to a complete divine fragment. Even the deity corresponding to the magic of Sislevina is not entirely complete, but has fragmented divine fragments from the gods."

"So the key question is, who can obtain more than half of the divine fragments, and who will become the final god, possessing the ultimate explanation of the corresponding deity. Therefore, as long as you obtain the 'Eye of Victory' magic staff after this, you will be able to grasp more than seven-tenths of the divine fragments, controlling the deity of death.

"As for how to avoid wearing the 'Eye of Victory' magic staff and continue to extract divine fragments to avoid the cycle of rebirth, it's up to your own abilities."
Here is the translation of the text:

"God's plan for the deceased god Nala was to wait for the person predicted to appear, and when that time came, the divine artifact would naturally fall into her hands, and then the god would awaken again inside her, followed by her collecting the remaining four large fragments."

Zhao Xu heard this and couldn't help but smile wryly.

Whoever said, "He didn't even realize it, and had already done the next few steps, only to miss the first step."

"Thank you," Zhao Xu said sincerely to the person from the Heavenly Realm.

"No need to thank me, I don't want to bear the burden of fate anymore. Just release me when the time comes."

"Okay," he said, even though the other party still possessed the true power of the divine artifact, Zhao Xu would still fulfill his promise, which was the most basic issue of honesty.

A mere divine artifact was not worth betraying him.

As for the rest, it was clear.

..."Don't cry, Auntie."

A girl wearing a silver helmet, Qi Qi, said tearfully, her eyes streaming with tears.

At this moment, there were over ten players beside her, most of whom were classmates of Zheng Xin'an from before.

Since they were in the AP class that went abroad, most of them didn't need to take the college entrance examination, and after finishing their application materials, they had plenty of spare time to establish their character accounts in Arthur.

This time, they had gathered here to mourn the sudden death of Zheng Xin'an, who had been attacked earlier.

The massive explosion outside the camp had destroyed everything, including the entire support team that had been wiped out.

As for Zheng Xin'an, who was at the center of it all, her fate was even more unbearable to imagine.

"I kept telling her to be cautious, that faith is a serious matter in a world where God exists, but she wouldn't listen..." Zheng's mother said, her eyes red from crying, having fainted when she received the news earlier and still struggling to accept the reality.
Here is the translation of the text:

She, who had always been as refined as a noblewoman, was unable to maintain her composure after hearing the news of her daughter's death. Meanwhile, Zheng Xinyuan's father stood silently by the window, his entire being seeming to have aged by over a decade. He kept reaching into his pocket, as if searching for something, but to no avail.

Even in a desolate wasteland where resources were scarce, let alone in a rich and prosperous outside world, a packet of cigarettes was a luxury item. Zheng Xinyuan's family may have had assets on Earth, but after crossing over, they were nothing.

The influence network they had once built had crumbled, along with the nodes, and had lost its effectiveness. At this moment, the most reliable people were Zheng Xinyuan's original classmates and friends, who were also the main force of Arthur's players of the same age.

However, on Earth, Zheng Xinyuan's social circle, family background, and residential location were all similar to hers. Many of her parents' acquaintances were also friends with Zheng Xinyuan's parents. This was the reason why they hurried to her house, despite the impending rain.

As Zheng Xinyuan's identity was, she was given the largest house in the camp, which was usually inhabited by her parents. However, Zheng Xinyuan rarely visited during the day.

After learning of the misfortune, Zheng Xinyuan's family members, who had always been busy traveling between unfamiliar places, were even more active. Zheng Xinyuan's relatives and friends, including classmates and friends, gathered at her home, with some people even having to stand due to the crowded living room.

Zheng Xinyuan's aunts, who were Zheng Xinyuan's mother's sisters, were constantly wiping away her tears and consoling her.
After a while, Zheng Ba, the patriarch of the Zheng family, finally came back to his senses, looking at the visitors, including his daughter's friends and classmates, and said, "Thank you all for coming to visit. My wife and I are grateful for your concern. Unfortunately, we don't have the conditions to reciprocate your kindness, and I'm truly sorry."

"No, no, it's we who intruded," said Qi Qi, a classmate who had shared a dormitory with Zheng Xin'er, wiping away tears. "We had previously agreed to mutually support each other when something happened to one of us. Who would have thought that we would face such a situation?"

Qi Qi's eyes became misty as she looked at the gold chainmail on her body, which was a birthday gift from Zheng Xin'er. "She gave us many items and magical goods during the early days of our journey."

As Qi Qi spoke, the female companions who had come to mourn also began to reminisce about their time with Zheng Xin'er, and their eyes became red and swollen. Zheng Mu was overcome with grief, her clothes soaked with tears.

"Mr. and Mrs. Zheng, we came to help you this time, to the best of our abilities," Qi Qi said. "After all, the conditions here are much harsher than on Earth. Please don't worry about it. This is what we agreed on earlier."

The men behind Qi Qi also nodded in agreement, their armor emitting a clear sound. As they spoke, each person came forward, expressing their condolences.

As they looked at the bundles of flax cloth, which were wrapped around the condolences, people couldn't help but be moved. The flax cloth was a rare commodity in this desolate land, and the items inside were all gifts from players. Many of the visitors who had come to comfort the Zheng family were also deeply moved.
Here is the translation of the text:

Although they may not have been as well-off as the Zheng family, they were still a respectable family with a good social standing. "Thank you for your concern, that's enough, I'm truly grateful," she said.

If they were on Earth, Mrs. Zheng would naturally decline the condolences and might even go to great lengths to hold a grand funeral for her son, refusing any compensation or returns. However, now that time has passed, it's difficult for her to decline the condolences, as she still has a family to rely on.

As she thought about giving her daughter a proper burial, but couldn't even find the remains, Mrs. Zheng's heart was filled with sorrow.

"Aunt, although this is a far-fetched idea, do you have any clues from A'nan?" she asked.

Mrs. Zheng was lost in thought, recalling a month ago when her son had urged her to play a game called Arthur with him. At the time, she had laughed at him, saying he was silly, playing games like a girl chasing after celebrities. Who would have thought that later, something like this would happen?

After crossing over, her son seemed to be very busy, aside from visiting the core city of Arthur, he mainly focused on spreading the teachings. He had kept this aspect of his work secret, and didn't tell her much.

Just then, a man dressed as a mage spoke up, "Has A'nan mentioned anything about his relationship with A'nan?"

The room fell silent for a moment. At this point, the area they were in was already part of A'nan, but they were also in the same region as A'nan's initial capital, which was several hundred miles away from where they were.
Here is the translation of the text:

Yanan's influence is largely inherited from the previous Starfall Town and the Northern Alliance's influence. Before that, Zheng Xin'an was reborn in Mistral, and later heard that he had gone to the Northern Alliance. Therefore, there was no experience of interacting with them in the game.

After crossing over, everyone gathered in the same camp because they were all in the same city.

Another girl spoke up, saying, "Aunt, don't you think we're being presumptuous. If there's a connection between Yan'an and our son, then we can't ask for their help to avenge our son."

The people present couldn't help but flash a look of surprise.

Yan'an is a name that is akin to heaven in everyone's heart. The capital of Yan'an is a dreamlike existence.

Even if they weren't in Yan'an right now, they wouldn't be able to live a life of peace and stability.

"Yes, sister, think carefully about this," said the middle-aged women who were with Zheng Mother.

"I don't really remember," Zheng Mother said with effort, recalling, "I just barely remember that before crossing over, she was going to meet a friend at a gathering. I heard her mention something about Zhao Xu."

As soon as the name was mentioned, Zheng Xin'an's classmates shook their heads, indicating that they had no impression of the name.

The older relatives of Zheng's family also arrived at Zheng's house one by one. Those who had never touched Yan'an asked their children if there was a person named Zhao Xu in Yan'an.

The natural answer was negative.

At this time, the younger generation of Zheng's family, who had crossed over a few days ago, had basically realized the truth and understood that Zheng Xin'an was their biggest burden in the future. Who would have thought that something like this would suddenly happen, and many people were lost for a moment.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Don't be discouraged," Zheng Xin Yu's grandfather said, tapping the floor with his cane. "Wait, my previous acquaintances from the family will come to pay their respects soon. You two should also be prepared to respond properly. This is a formal occasion, after all."

At this time, the younger generation of the Zheng family were already standing at the entrance, welcoming the visitors.

As a 3rd-level pastor, Zheng Xin Yu had been through a lot since crossing over. During the initial chaos, he had even received visits from people who wanted to tie the knot. But in this precarious situation, no one could afford to take things slowly. It wasn't until the 20th that people started considering such matters.

The warmth of the family gathering also made Zheng's parents realize their daughter's "refined" nature.

After all, they were living in a city on Earth, and the people coming to visit were not just ordinary folk. They were from high-ranking families with a history dating back to the vice-ministerial level. Some even had connections to the Imperial Court.

As the visitors continued to arrive, it was almost time for lunch.

The Zheng family naturally wanted to keep everyone around for a meal, hoping that the young generation could also make friends with Zheng Xin Yu's acquaintances and classmates. The more friends, the merrier.

Just as everyone was about to sit down, footsteps echoed from outside the door again.

The younger generation rushed over to prepare for the formalities.

Although most people were empty-handed, the act of visiting and offering condolences in itself was a gesture of goodwill.

As the mysterious man in a black cloak, resembling the night sky, stood alone at the entrance, he was asked, "Who are you?"

The two people in charge of welcoming the visitors looked at each other in surprise, with no recollection of the man.

Zhao Xu suddenly felt a sense of nostalgia, reminiscent of his first visit to the family. He gazed out, his eyes sweeping across the familiar faces of friends and acquaintances from his past life.
Here is the translation of the text:

Just like returning to his previous life, he was at the scene where he first visited the other person's home for a blind date, and a sentence from an old song suddenly popped up in his mind - "Like a dream play, the heavens manipulate one's life, familiar friends and new loves are all fleeting, old love and new joy are intertwined with regret." He didn't care about what was right or wrong, he was lost in the wrong era.

"Sir?" The two people receiving him looked at Zhao Xu's fancy dress, knowing he was a big shot, and they didn't dare to speak loudly, but they couldn't help but stare at him for a long time, still reminding him.

"Oh, sorry." Zhao Xu finally snapped out of it, looking at his previous life's father-in-law and mother-in-law sitting in the courtyard, looking puzzled, and slightly bowing his head.

A sense of familiarity began to well up inside him.

"Excuse me for dropping by, I'm Zhao Xu."
