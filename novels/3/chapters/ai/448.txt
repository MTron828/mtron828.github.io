Chapter 449: The Eve

Wasn't it because of him that the other party waited for the apocalypse to revive, otherwise, Zhao Xu would have doubted whether the other party was truly the "Moses Zarelin". Moreover, when he heard this word, Zhao Xu seemed to recall the people at the train station who wore flashy clothes, kept silent, and pretended to be mute. They carried fake "disabled certificates" and "good Samaritan cards" and went around asking passengers for donations.

In reality, not all passengers who sympathized with the cause were wealthy.

The camel that was skinny to the point of death was bigger than a horse.

Even if the Moses Zarelin in front of him was in a state of dying but not dead, he was still a formidable existence.

"I am not a great existence like Ernest," Zhao Xu said. "You want my promise, but it's unlikely to make a difference."

Facing this existence that was still suppressing the fire element with a firm will, Zhao Xu thought back to what Anzuelo had said, that a careless move could cause the fire element to merge with the Arthurian realm.

After some thought, Zhao Xu decided to be more delicate in his approach.

No one knew whether these silent "existences" would suddenly change their faces and become terrifying demons.

Or maybe they were disguised by certain demons or devilish leaders.

"You should know what I chose in the past, as Anzuelo said outside," Moses Zarelin said in a hoarse voice, tapping the armrest with his finger in a mysterious rhythm.

He seemed like an old, decrepit old man, lamenting the relentless passage of time.

"Isn't it funny?" Moses Zarelin's voice said, his voice like sandpaper.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu shook his head, saying, "No, even if the ancient gods don't exist in this era, I still feel a profound sense of reverence. Especially, the residue of the fire element is still protecting the stability of the fire element's position."

"Just now's sudden change makes me feel a bit uncomfortable, that's all," he said.

"Oh?" Moszelin seemed to be interested in Zhao Xu's words.

"It feels like seeing the ancestor of the fire element, and it's not that different. It's as if I'm looking at a dying neighbor, aren't you thinking the same?" Zhao Xu said, his heart feeling a sense of relief.

The spell he had been preparing to cast was interrupted, and he explained, "No, the ancient sages taught us not to use mortal eyes to gaze upon the glory of the divine."

"Hmm, interesting. That's what I taught Ernest," Moszelin said with a sigh. "Don't doubt me."

After saying that, he lightly lifted his right hand and snapped his fingers.

[As an adventurer, you are under the influence of "Fire's Honor" and your fire-element spells automatically gain the effects of "Spell Extremity", "Spell Intensity", "Spell Expansion", "Spell Instant Release", "Spell Silent Release", and "Spell Fixed Release".]

The prompt in the dynamic bar suddenly made Zhao Xu's heart skip a beat, with a total of six specialties, the first three increasing damage and spell effect range, and the last three reducing spellcasting costs.

Just in time, they were all within the standard system, unlike his "Spell Twins" that belonged to the "Non-Standard System", which ordinary mages couldn't learn.

"So, have you got a good hand?" Moszelin smiled.

"Beyond imagination." Zhao Xu exclaimed.
Here is the translation of the text:

The wizard's profession is unmatched, and it's impossible to achieve the same level as the "Mossezelin" in front of me, which can automatically match the opponent's spells to their specialties with just a flick of the wrist. This is a bit "beyond the rules".

"So, I'm asking you again here, I need your promise for the future," Mossezelin said, his tone becoming more humble.

Finally, it's here.

Zhao Xu slowed down his thoughts, considering his response, "Mainly, I don't understand why such a giant entity like you needs to ask us, tiny insects, for something."

"A wizard who hasn't even reached half the level of a legend, how could I overestimate myself?" Zhao Xu muttered to himself, waiting for Mossezelin to enlighten him.

"It seems she's not very clear about this, or maybe she is clear but doesn't want you to bear the responsibility," Mossezelin said.

Suddenly, his voice, as old as the hills, rose an octave.

The echoes of his voice reverberated through the empty space, "That's okay."

"What do you mean?" Zhao Xu asked, looking back and forth, wondering if Anzhiniya would notice his awkwardness.

"Not a problem," Mossezelin smiled, "Even if I'm about to tell you, it's one of the biggest secrets of the world, about the world being destroyed."

"I can't directly tell you the 'oath' that Ernest told me earlier, otherwise you'll become deaf and forget this memory as soon as you hear it. This is a secret protected by magic."

"I can only tell you a few key points."

"'Destruction' and 'birth' are the two sides of everything, just like the chaos that accompanies order, as if two serpents were born together."

"Can you understand?"
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu puffed out a mouthful of turbid breath, as if he was about to release all the frustration and anxiety accumulated in his chest. He speculated, "Does your intention mean that Arthur will be destroyed, depending on whether 'initial birth' appears?"

"Indeed, you're perceptive," Moszelein suddenly exclaimed, his words not clever and without congratulatory tone.

"'Initial birth' refers to whom?" Zhao Xu asked.

"The Earth people."

"Boom!"

The moment the space became chaotic and empty, like a lightning bolt striking, the bright light tore through the darkness. The thunderbolt pillar accompanied by the electric arc, connecting the heavens and the earth.

Moszelein seemed to feel his breath about to disappear, even though he was already panting, and still spoke in a hurried tone: "As soon as the Earth humans cross over to this world, it means the arrival of 'initial birth'."

" Destruction and rebirth, it's all a restart."

"Remember, Earth people, you still owe me a promise."

Just as Zhao Xu was about to respond, he realized that everything in front of him had solidified into a glass mirror, reflecting all things transparently, but suddenly shattered.

It transformed into nothingness.

...

He fell onto the shore of the Star Lake.

"What happened?" Zhao Xu asked, sitting on the cart with his head bowed, looking somewhat lackluster.

After Zhao Xu heard Moszelein's last words, it took him a moment to regain his composure, only to find that the three of them had been chased back out of the "tomb" and were floating on the surface of the Star Lake.

Meanwhile, the stars in the sky had risen, and the three crescent moons had settled in their respective positions, looking down at the living beings of the Arthurian world.
After the "Rainbow Sphere" was set up to block and prevent all forms of divination and precognition, Zhao Xu began to organize his thoughts, slowly selecting words that could avoid "sensitive keywords".

He gradually told Moszelein about his "past", retelling it to Anzhi Noya. Meanwhile, ViViAn sat quietly in the corner, listening attentively.

"It seems he knows more than I imagined, but still not as much as me," Anzhi Noya summarized with a single sentence.

As she spoke, she looked at Zhao Xu, who seemed to be deep in thought, and asked with a smile, "What's wrong? Did you get hit?"

Zhao Xu shook his head, but his heart was actually troubled by the thought of the apocalypse. He had always believed that humans were too short-lived to worry about events that might occur hundreds, thousands, or even tens of thousands of years in the future.

However, when he learned that the apocalypse was connected to "Earth's crossing", his mind began to feel the weight of a heavy stone.

"It's not that I'm feeling hit. I'm well aware that Arthur's destruction and the Earth have no connection whatsoever. It's just that the fact that the Earth can cross means that Arthur's destruction will indeed happen."

Zhao Xu concluded.

"If I were the Summer King, I would indeed feel uncomfortable. It's as if I just jumped out of a dead-end situation where the Earth was about to be destroyed, only to find myself in a situation where the destruction of Arthur will still occur anyway."

Anzhi Noya nodded lightly, saying, "You don't need to worry too much about this. In fact, it's brutal to say that more than 99% of the people who crossed over from the Earth will not live to see the destruction arrive."

"Don't worry about this until you become a legendary strongman above level 30. This is not something to worry about yet."

Here is the translation of the text:

"What is the Saint Descending?"
Zhao Xu was taken aback, as he had just learned a new term from An Ti Nuo Ya.
"Don't ask too many questions," An Ti Nuo Ya directly cut off the topic.

But she could not help but soften and explain a little, "It's the moment when the gods lose their divine power and descend to the mortal world. Don't talk too much, okay? I'm warning you. This is a secret that most gods don't know."

"This is the era of dawn," she said. "When the era of turmoil begins, that's when you'll have a headache. It's not just legendary, and you might not even have the qualification to survive."

After saying that, An Ti Nuo Ya suddenly looked Zhao Xu up and down, "Tomorrow is supposed to be the 'New Year' for your kind, isn't it?"

"It's just a custom in the Huaxia region, not the whole world," Zhao Xu corrected with a hint of amusement.

The impact of the previous words had just been tempered a bit.

However, according to his memories from his past life, at least ten years later, the era of turmoil had not begun yet, and it was not an urgent matter within the next ten years.

If An Ti Nuo Ya's answer was really accurate, he might have thought that the other person was also a human from Earth like him.

"Yes, I've heard that on that day, you all gather with your families. You don't have time tomorrow. What I just said also verified half of the intelligence you gathered, barely meeting the target."

"That's why I'll take Viola with me to visit May in the month of May. As for the summer solstice, you can go offline at your own discretion. This carriage is invisible, and you don't need to worry about it."

After saying that, An Ti Nuo Ya and Viola disappeared into thin air in front of Zhao Xu.
Zhao Xuguang was about to lift his hand again, but put it back down. Tomorrow is New Year's Eve. I wonder, among those who will come to visit tomorrow, how many will be able to see each other again in four months' time.
