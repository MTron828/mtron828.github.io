Chapter 132: One Arrow

Zhao Xu was walking down the straight corridor, finally understanding that he could reach every floor from here.

Looking at the indicator pointing to the legendary-level alchemy upgrade platform on the 10th floor, Zhao Xu smiled, thinking that one day he would come here, but not now.

He turned around and directly pushed open the door leading to the first floor, which had been repaired and installed for many years.

After Zhao Xu entered the testing area on the first floor, he discovered that the entire floor was divided into many regions, with most of them set up according to the mainstream arcane arts of current wizards.

For example, there was a remote target room for practicing acid spray and freezing beam, and various arcane art usage notes were carved on the door.

There were also multiple hidden doors set up for training the "Detection of Hidden Doors" spell, and a high platform with a safety buffer plate below for training the "Feather Falling" spell.

Compared to the chaotic scene of novice wizards on the underground plaza the night before, the current situation was indeed much more orderly.

Zhao Xu walked past, nodding in approval, muttering to himself that the Floating City was indeed willing to invest in this area.

However, Zhao Xu's goal was to reach the battle training area.

The scroll scholar had mastered all the divine magic of the four major professions: priest, druid, ranger, and paladin.

As a priest, divine magic can enhance the abilities of teammates.

Even if a priest decides to go to battle, as long as they give themselves a buff, they are stronger than warriors.

The prestige of the priest was always intimidating to the warriors of King Arthur.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

As for the limited number of battles, it's not that they're useless, but rather that the significance of the priest's healing is greater. Meanwhile, the Forest Ranger and the Holy Warrior have numerous magical abilities to enhance themselves and raise their combat abilities in both close and long-range combat.

This is also why Anshen told him that, aside from the priest, only the Scroll Scholar can output damage in close combat. Scroll Scholars can survive in that terrifying and bizarre world, and it's not without reason.

Zhao Xue specifically trained today to test his own close and long-range combat abilities, aside from practicing his Scroll magic. Even if he has corresponding spells, he'll still be troubled by some high-attribute enemies.

So Zhao Xue needs to train his own physical output ability, even if he doesn't use it. When Zhao Xue entered the combat room, he found several novice mages already there, staring at the underground arena with a depth of four or five meters. There were several blind, wandering skeleton warriors there.

Zhao Xue took a glance at the introduction on the wall and roughly understood the situation.

The day Anshen used the summoning spell to summon the skeleton, it followed the rules of the spell. This place is a specially set-up arena, and most of the skeleton warriors have been specifically modified to become stronger through the negative energy field underground.

Their HP is significantly higher than ordinary skeletons. The skeletons glowing red are the lowest-level ones with only 10 HP. Those glowing blue are higher-level ones, with at least 20 HP.
Here is the translation of the text:

The life value, as a quantifiable data, is constantly influencing the Arthur world at all times, and it wasn't until the introduction of the character card system that people began to accept this concept.

On the tables surrounding the training grounds, there were bows and quivers filled with arrows for the novice mages to practice their shooting skills.

Zhao Xu lightly nodded and picked up one of the bows, immediately taking aim at a red-glowing skeleton warrior on the training grounds.

"Click-clack" sounded the bowstring as it was drawn back, and the arrow flew straight towards the target with a spinning arc.

"Boom!" echoed through the air, as the arrow was spotted by the skeleton warrior Zhao Xu was trying to sneak up on. The skeleton warrior used its iron shield to deflect Zhao Xu's attack.

"These skeletons have been granted sloping defensive capabilities," Zhao Xu explained, "not to mention that even if you manage to sneak up on them, the sloping defensive abilities on their bodies could potentially deflect your attack."

Just then, a female mage approached Zhao Xu and began to explain.

The majority of the floating city's requirements for personnel are met by people with a certain level of magical experience, which is why players like Qi Qi began recruiting for this profession.

According to her expectations, she would be able to save up enough contribution points in a few more days and then record another level of mage spell.

Zhao Xu, who had previously cast a defensive evil spell on himself, was well aware of the effects of sloping value addition. This ability is equivalent to a force that appears throughout the body, allowing attacks to be deflected.

Once a mage stacks up their defensive sloping values, any arrows shot at them will find that no matter how hard they try, those arrows will eventually be pulled back like they are under the influence of a massive gravitational force.
Here is the translation of the text:

"This junior student, if you haven't mastered the first-level spell 'Defeat the Enemy First', then you're unlikely to penetrate the defense of these skeletons," Qi Qi explained to Zhao Xu, looking at him with a sympathetic expression.

The style of Earth players is quite obvious, and she immediately recognized the opponent, but as the guide, she couldn't say anything at the scene, and could only follow the requirements of the Floating City.

Just now, there was a player who, due to the noise of the corresponding training room, had to come to this relatively quiet training room, but he found that he couldn't penetrate the defense of these reinforced skeleton warriors and could only return disappointed.

"Oh, it's okay, I'll try," Zhao Xu continued to hold his bow.

In reality, he hadn't prepared this spell, but it didn't matter, as he had a special talent for precognition and could use the three empty spell slots in the mage profession to cast the spell.

At this time, the guide Qi Qi didn't say anything to Zhao Xu and turned to give guidance to other novice mages, also spreading the strengths and weaknesses of skeleton warriors.

Standing in the shadowy corner, Zhao Xu reviewed the list of spells in his mind and directly released the Aen stone from his pouch.

In this way, he, a 1st-level scholar, could achieve the effect of a 2nd-level mage.

Looking at the skeleton warriors on the field, Zhao Xu directly chanted the incantation of the unique 1st-level spell of the Paladin, "Divine Sacrifice".

Paladins can only cast 1st-level spells when they reach 4th level, and even then, they need to have an extra spell slot, and won't be able to get the first 1st-level spell slot until they reach 6th level.

Therefore, Paladins can only cast 1st-level spells when they are 4th to 6th level, and the spell itself is extraordinary, far surpassing ordinary mages and priests.

Divine Sacrifice is a spell that sacrifices blood for output.
Here is the translation:

Zhao Xu consumed 10 HP of his life force and gained the ability to add powerful force to his attacks for the next two rounds, dealing up to 5D6 (5-30) damage per round. At the same time, the arrow shot by the bow had a mere 1D8 (1-8) damage, which seemed like a mere trifle.

Immediately after, Zhao Xu cast the "Preemptive Strike" spell, which granted him extraordinary insight, allowing him to probe the weaknesses of his opponents and penetrate their defenses.

After casting the spell, Zhao Xu lifted his bow again. Just then, Qi Qi had just finished explaining the basics of the bow to a few people and was about to come over to explain the finer points to Zhao Xu.

As a rare individual who had practiced archery on Earth, she didn't need much training with the bow. This was also the reason she was assigned to this small room.

However, when she saw that Zhao Xu's arrow was perfectly aimed at the 20 HP blue-glowing skeleton, she couldn't help but laugh. This little brother was indeed too cute, being afraid to attack the skeleton directly.

The skeleton was placed at the bottom because there was a negative energy field at its feet, which would harm ordinary people who approached. However, it would heal the skeleton instead.

Even if the arrow dealt damage to the skeleton, it would not be enough to kill it, and the skeleton would soon recover to full health within a round.

Many new players who had just learned magic had tried to attack the skeleton with magic missiles, but they all failed, as the damage was insufficient.

Unless they could kill the skeleton in one round, the skeleton would recover to full health in the next round, ready to fight again.

Qi Qi hurriedly walked forward to tell Zhao Xu not to waste his time on the blue-glowing skeleton, which was actually set up to practice group synergy.
Here is the translation of the text:

Just as Zhao Xu's hand-held crossbow had already been fired.

Qi Qi's attention also followed the arrow, and she was watching it as it just grazed the edge of the iron shield at a strange angle, piercing the skull of the skeleton warrior.

The entire skeleton warrior then shook violently where it stood.

Qi Qi was about to turn back to look at the astonished expression on her fellow student's face, but only to be astonished herself.

The skeleton warrior, with its blue glow, immediately turned into dust.

A long time later, Qi Qi finally came to her senses.

She was full of questions in her heart!

This amount of blood, which was enough to kill a 2nd-level warrior with 20 HP, was killed by a single arrow from a 1st-level mage.

Who would believe it?

This 1st-level mage was a monster who could kill anyone, instantly killing anyone he saw.

Qi Qi suddenly blinked her eyes, thinking she must have been hallucinating. But she couldn't deny the truth.

The skeleton warrior had indeed disappeared.

Qi Qi quickly turned around to ask her fellow student how he had done it.

However, the dark corner that had been quiet earlier was now empty, with only the still-warm crossbow lying on the table.

At this moment, Qi Qi couldn't help but groan at her work manual.

She had to fill out the reason for the death of this skeleton warrior...

The floating city, the highest hall.

This place is the core of the floating city, always watching the unusual movements of the entire floating city.

Each monitor personnel in front of the projection screen has a "refining transmission tube", and only they can connect to all directions of the floating city from this place.
Here is the translation of the text:

"How did this happen? How did a huge energy fluctuation occur inside the Floating City? There was no large-scale experiment application approved today, was there?"

A monitoring personnel complained.

"Quickly locate it," the person in charge said, sitting at the back.

"It's confirmed, it's the Power Testing Facility."

"Let's go ask about it."

The person in charge, sipping his red tea, gave orders.

Compared to using short-range communication methods like telepathy, these high-end communication devices, although expensive and maintenance-intensive, are highly efficient and can even allow ordinary people without magical abilities to maintain communication.

At this time, another monitoring personnel picked up the communication device and dialed the Power Testing Facility.

"What? Emergency activation of the 13th layer? Who authorized this? Did you submit an application?"

The monitoring personnel immediately asked sternly.

But soon, his expression changed, and he politely said, "Okay, I'll pass on the message. If there's anything we need to cooperate with, please directly connect to this line. I'll contact the Energy Regulation Room to strengthen the power transmission capacity of the Power Testing Facility."

At this time, the person in charge had already understood the situation from the brief conversation. He put down his tea cup and asked, "Who is the noble person who went?"

Only the seven powerful individuals could be considered noble.

"It's Miss Anastasia," the monitoring personnel replied, lowering his head.

Upon hearing this name, the person in charge's expression condensed slightly.

Miss Anastasia never needed to go to the Power Testing Facility, as its facilities were already more advanced.

Could she have some familial relationship with the old man Li Stan?

But he reviewed Li Stan's life story and couldn't find any connection to the Itzel family.

If there really was a connection, he wouldn't have been on the blacklist for this period.
Here is the translation of the text:

As he thought about it, he decided he still had to tell his cousin about it, temporarily unable to easily move Li Sitan's position.

......War Force Testing Hall.

Li Sitan put down the communication device in his hand and continued to command the nine-ring mage to adjust the output power of the equipment room to its maximum. Just now, his furious outburst was the first time in his life he had been so reckless in front of the highest temple of the airship city's central department.

Everyone in attendance who knew the source of the communication device trembled with fear.

The only thing that made Li Sitan a bit uneasy was why Lady Annye was still not here.
