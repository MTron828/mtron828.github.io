Chapter 312: The Lost Mage Tower

After the initial shock, it was not until Zhao Xu explained that everyone realized they had been linked together by Zhao Xu's magic spell.

It was not a "heart-to-heart" connection, but rather a simple "ally chat" spell, which was a group version of the "telepathy" spell. Moreover, it could prevent the contents from being read out of the lips.

For a moment, the entire Guardian Alliance was excitedly discussing, with each person speaking their mind and pointing to their own goals.

Only later did Snow Sword reorganize the discipline, and the meeting did not become chaotic again.

However, considering the possibility of strong enemies lurking nearby, it was impossible to escape at this point.

So Snow Sword continued to arrange personnel according to the previous plan, but he emphasized the importance of the personnel stationed on the lake surface.

Slowly, as the high-ranking members of the Alliance continued to speak, the meeting turned into an exchange session.

Finally, it took 70 minutes for Zhao Xu's spell to run out of time, and everyone finished discussing.

According to the initial plan, the first batch of eight people, including Snow Sword, Giant Pillar, Accumulated Snow, Wanderer, Poet Kol, Shepherd Qingyun, Priest Chen, and Zhao Xu, set off.

After Zhao Xu received the 5th-level "Underwater Breathing" scroll from Snow Sword, he directly unfolded the nearly 30-centimeter-wide sheepskin paper, looked at the arcane text on it, and began to cast the spell.
Here is the translation:

As time passed, a blue glow began to emanate from Zhao Xū's palm, resembling a gentle spring breeze.

Immediately, he walked up to each person preparing to dive, lightly touched them, and transferred the energy of the glow.

Originally, the duration of "underwater breathing" was 10 hours, with each level lasting 2 hours. On average, each person received 1 hour and 15 minutes of breathing time.

After completing these tasks, everyone took a rod worth 2 gold coins, which was a refined illuminating rod. Then, they tied stones to their feet and jumped into the water.

As there was no way to light an oil lamp at the bottom of the lake, the group had prepared a large number of illuminating rods in advance.

The surface of Mirror Lake was crystal clear, but after sinking a certain distance, Zhao Xū's visual and sensory abilities were severely restricted.

The water pressure also compressed his body, especially after diving deep, causing him to feel slightly uncomfortable.

According to the notes, the wizard tower directly struck the mud at the bottom of the lake. Therefore, they had to search the bottom of the lake to find the wizard tower.

So, everyone first dispersed, forming pairs according to their abilities, and began to search for the entrance to the wizard tower at the bottom of the lake.

However, Mirror Lake itself was extremely vast, with an area equivalent to three or four football fields.

However, when Zhao Xū reached the bottom of the lake, he found that the lake bed was primarily composed of hard rock, with a layer of mud deposited on top over time.
Here's the translation of the text:

If the wizard's tower were to fall straight down, it would probably crush the rocky bottom of the lake, making a significant impact. However, he didn't see anything, just some protruding gray things, which were mostly sediment from the lake bottom, not the tip of the wizard's tower.

After an hour had passed, everyone automatically floated back up to the surface according to the initial agreement.

When Zhao Xu and his ghostly companions finally emerged from the water, they faced the other seven people.

Each person shook their head, indicating that they had not found any evidence of the wizard's tower.

After listening, the face of the person with the frost sword turned somewhat gloomy.

Seeking the site of the wizard's tower had been a problem for him, and no one dared to guarantee that it hadn't been excavated within a hundred years.

However, the detailed notes in the notebook made him almost certain that the wizard's tower still existed and had not been excavated.

"How should we proceed?" the poet, Kou Lu, asked, looking somewhat dejected.

Originally, according to the plan, they would use the "Water Breathing" technique for the second time, with the entire team entering the tower in order.

But this situation was unexpected.

"What do you think, Mr. Wild Wind?" the frost sword asked, looking at Zhao Xu for advice.

Zhao Xu was taken aback, but his thoughts were clear: "Continue, expand the scale of the attempt. If it doesn't work, wait until tomorrow to try again."

As Zhao Xu looked serious, the frost sword nodded seriously as well.

After that, Zhao Xu didn't go down again, but instead consumed his magical energy to perform the "Water Breathing" technique twice in a row.

This time, he allocated the time equally among the 20 people, allowing each person to breathe for more than an hour.

However, when everyone floated back up to the surface after an hour, they all shook their heads, indicating that they had found nothing.
Here is the translation of the text:

At that moment, all the members of the guild looked at each other in shock, with water droplets all over their faces, unable to wipe them dry. It was as if the heavens were playing a huge joke on them.

Sword then got nervous and took out the remaining three "Breathing Underwater" scrolls, giving them to Zhao Xu, and taking out the share that was originally meant for their core team to enter the tower. "Sir Wind, please cast a spell to make us go down," Sword said, gasping for air, with veins bulging on his neck.

"Thirty people?" Zhao Xu looked at the three scrolls, each worth 350 gold coins, wrinkling his brow.

He had initially suggested trying again, but after 30 people searched for an hour and found nothing, he realized that this method was unreliable.

He felt that going down again would be futile, but Sword was unwilling to give up, even if it meant consuming more resources.

As the one accepting the commission, Zhao Xu naturally wouldn't persuade the other to give up.

Sword agreed, and behind him, the group of players, some with red eyes, didn't agree.

After Zhao Xu used the "Breathing Underwater" spell three times, the entire Guardian's Guild divided into 30 people, and they lined up around the Mirror Moon Lake, jumping into the water one by one and then simultaneously heading towards the lake's center.

Sword also went down to the bottom of the lake, while Zhao Xu stayed sitting by the lake's edge.

At that moment, the night wind was gentle, and the three-quarter moon in the sky was slowly rising, casting a soft, silvery light on the lake's surface, creating a dreamlike, unreal atmosphere.
Here is the translation of the text:

This time, Zhao Xū also let his soul demon follow him, and he could replenish his True Knowledge technique at any time. However, just a minute or so had passed, and there was still time left over. Zhao Xū saw the players who didn't usually participate suddenly rush out of the water. "It's all over," the Frost Sword said, his entire body soaked through, with lake water dripping from his hair, and he had no energy to wipe himself dry.

"How is this possible? Why is this happening?" the wandering thief whispering to himself, as if unable to believe this sudden change. His sister, who had just gone down with him, looked at her brother with a tense expression.

She was clear that they had basically drained their entire guild's assets for this time's ruins of the Mage Tower. "Perhaps, from the beginning, this Mage Tower itself was just an illusion," the Frost Sword said with a sigh.

The 18 hours of underwater search time, adding up to over 60 hours, had found no Mage Tower beneath the lake. Either they couldn't reach it with their current manpower, or it didn't exist in the first place.

Even if it did exist, there were mysterious forces nearby, closely monitoring the situation and ready to intervene at any moment. This adventure, from the very beginning, had been shrouded in shadow.

It was too hasty to let everyone retreat, but it was also very frustrating.

"What do you think, then?" the guild leader asked.

"But we've mobilized too many resources this time, and if we return empty-handed, the guild may not be able to operate," someone replied.

"That's better than wasting time here," someone else said.

The guild leader, Frost Sword, let out a sigh and walked straight to Zhao Xū, saying, "Sorry, Crazy Mage, we may need to hold a meeting first."
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu nodded slightly and then walked to the lake, which was far from the main group, and gazed out at the serene and peaceful evening landscape. Under the faint moonlight, he could only barely make out the outlines of the day's events. However, it was even more mysterious.

Suddenly, Zhao Xu noticed that a green phosphorescent glow had appeared in front of the Frost Sword, despite being far away. Although he could hardly recognize it, he knew that it was the large character "kill".

His heart skipped a beat as he realized that it was the effect of the "Divination" magic, which was unique to the pastor of the two rings. The Divination magic could only predict the future within half an hour, and it could only be used at this moment.

It was likely that the other party was asking whether they could find any useful information about the wizard tower after searching.

The gods and their servants also gave a direct answer, which was a "kill". Even the neutral "peace" was not an option.

Zhao Xu's heart was calm, and he was the only one who had gained something in the group. As long as he could get the notebook, he would be satisfied.

However, it was necessary to think carefully about how to get the notebook from the Frost Sword.

As for the goal of this journey, the wizard tower, he could definitely participate in some task to get what he wanted.

Finally, the Frost Sword finished the meeting and led the guild members over. Unexpectedly, the Frost Sword immediately told Zhao Xu about the divination result he had just obtained and also told him about their intention to give up.

"Crazy Wind, we just want to cut our losses, so we want to ask if you're willing to buy the information about the wizard tower's ruins."

As he spoke, the Frost Sword handed a "lead box" containing the notebook to Zhao Xu.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu also discovered for the first time that he had encountered the predicament of buying a shell and returning a pearl.
He actually only wanted that notebook.
However, the people of Frost Sword did not hide the divination results from him at all, and the information about the Tower of the Mage also attracted the attention of outsiders, so Frost Sword and others did not have too high expectations.
And Zhao Xu paid the gold coins, and Frost Sword and others would then withdraw, which could be said to be their best way to stop the bleeding at present.
After all, they had not even found the Tower of the Mage yet.
"Agree to it," suddenly the voice of An Ti Nuo Ya echoed in Zhao Xu's ear.
