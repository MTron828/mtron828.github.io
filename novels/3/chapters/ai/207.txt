Chapter 208: The Disappearing Path

Zhao Xu waited for 18 seconds before looking at Lü Dù with a playful expression. Just moments ago, Lü Dù had said "the secret of the gods" and Zhao Xu's ears had become numb, making him unable to hear any external sounds. It was as if the emptiness around him was warning him not to listen anymore.

This reminded Zhao Xu of his 11th-level ability as a scroll scholar - Dark Knowledge (Terror Secret). Compared to his Dark Knowledge (Tactical), which could enhance his combat performance against monsters, Dark Knowledge (Terror Secret) was even more formidable, capable of forcing enemies to tremble or be stunned.

It was like the time he had used his "Deep Prison Furnace" skill and his opponent had cast the eight-ring spell "Order: Stun" on him. With just one syllable of the "Stun" spell, he could immobilize the enemy, making them unable to move.

However, the actual cost and limitations of the spell were significant. Not only was the spell itself close to its upper limit, but it was only effective against creatures with 150 HP or less. Moreover, Zhao Xu had forgotten that the spell was part of the "Coercive Mind" category, which was immune to his "Higher Law" skill, "Mind Barrier" skill, and "Merciful Resignation" skill.

Therefore, if the opponent wanted to successfully stun Zhao Xu, they would have to break through all three of his skills. This was the awkward part of the spell.

As a scroll scholar, Zhao Xu's "Terror Secret" would only be blocked by the unyielding four-ring immunity skill of a saint warrior like "Merciful Resignation".
Here is the translation:

At the same time, Zhao Xu is also facing the "secret of the gods". Moreover, the opponent is somehow related to the god of death, Nala, and the entrance to the underworld is not far from the temple of the god of death. However, Zhao Xu has no time to care about these things.

The key question is whether Luo Duo, just a spirit, can have such an effect on him. Let alone the fact that he has no basic exemption ability. It means that he can reveal this secret to others and even make them deaf to it. With this secret, he can manipulate others like a whip.

Luo Duo has already understood Zhao Xu's silent thinking, looking at him with a disgusted expression. "I've already found a loophole. You're affected by the wrath of the god of death because you're a direct participant. Try fighting while saying something that seems meaningless to others, but only you understand it."

After hearing these words, Zhao Xu calmed down a bit. It seems that he knows too much and has been entangled.

On one hand, he knows the existence of the underworld and needs to participate in it. On the other hand—

"Not fair." Luo Duo suddenly looked thoughtful, her hair fluttering, and then she looked at Zhao Xu with a suspicious expression. "You mustn't have gotten close to the god's artifact."

When Zhao Xu heard the word "god", he thought things were taking a turn again, until the three words "of the god's artifact" appeared. He finally realized he was just startled.

At that time, he entered that place of the dead and saw those "coffins". According to reason, he must have picked up some things at that moment.
Here is the translation:

"What does that mean?" Zhao Xu immediately changed the topic, trying to steer the conversation towards a vague direction.

"That refers to the place where the dead god fell before becoming a god, where he suffered cruel torture. After becoming a god, the god's powerful wrath created an unbreakable will, directly cursing the place to become the 'Half-Face' of King Arthur."

After finishing, Dulu stopped talking and didn't reveal anything more. Later, Zhao Xu tidied up and then fell asleep in the library, surrounded by magical tomes.

The next morning, Zhao Xu woke up and began preparing according to his plan. This time, considering the mysterious and unknowable nature of the Half-Face, he reviewed the three major magical systems.

Finally, after Zhao Xu's magical preparations were complete, his character panel changed to:

【Mage (Profession Line One: 4th Level) Magical Position:
Zero-Rank: 4=4 (Profession)
First-Rank: 5=3 (Profession) + 2 (Intelligence)
Second-Rank: 4=2 (Profession) + 2 (Intelligence)】

【Scholar of Ancient Tomes (Profession Line Two: 3rd Level) Magical Position:
Zero-Rank: 4=4 (Profession)
First-Rank: 4=3 (Profession) + 1 (Perception)
Second-Rank: 3=2 (Profession) + 1 (Perception)】

【Priest (Profession Line Two: 1st Level) Magical Position:
Zero-Rank: 3=3 (Profession)
First-Rank: 2+1=1 (Profession) + 1 (Perception) + 1 (Domain)】

At this moment, Zhao Xu had 7 two-ringed spells, 12 one-ringed spells, and multiple magical abilities. With 13 two-ringed spells, he was essentially a "Mini-Overlord" of his level.
Here is the translation of the text:

After Zhao Xue finished inspecting his equipment, he directly walked out of the room. He went to find the middleman who had brought him yesterday, according to the other party's arrangement, and got on a horse-drawn carriage, heading towards the destination.

Zhao Xue sat back on the carriage, feeling the jolting sensation as the wheels rolled over the stones, and couldn't help but smile.

Earlier, he had also sat on a carriage with Yu Yu, going on an adventure, but unfortunately, it ended in failure.

Zhao Xue sat on the carriage for an entire morning, with the journey exceeding his expectations.

The carriage ride lasted for three hours, and Zhao Xue finally arrived at the destination just before noon.

At this point, Zhao Xue noticed that they had arrived at an estate.

The estate was a three- or four-story garden-style mansion with a slightly eerie atmosphere, standing before Zhao Xue's eyes. Behind it was a towering mine.

The estate's manager looked like an ordinary gardener, still holding his pruning shears, standing in front of Zhao Xue.

He took the "introduction letter" handed to him by Zhao Xue, didn't even glance at it, and stuffed it into his pocket. Then, he led Zhao Xue to the entrance of the mine behind the estate.

"Is this the location of the Flesh-Eating Beast's Den?"

Zhao Xue looked at the entrance, which was not very large, and became curious.

"Not at all. Below this entrance is a secret teleportation portal. As long as you find the key location, you can teleport smoothly."

At this moment, the estate manager's demeanor changed, and he became solemn and dignified, like a witness at a wedding. "Remember, if you have any questions, just break this gemstone, and we'll come to rescue you." He handed Zhao Xue a plain black gemstone.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Furthermore, although you don't possess the skill of teleportation, I'm still warning you according to the regulations, don't try to teleport inside, it will cost you a huge price." After saying this, the farmer took a folding stool and sat down in a corner, waiting for Zhao Xiu's move.

Zhao Xiu saw this scene and didn't think much about it. After casting a few protective spells on himself, he took out a "Non-Extinguishable Torch" and walked inside.

It wasn't until Zhao Xiu's figure disappeared that a magician who had been hiding in plain sight finally revealed himself, looking down at the farmer with a low voice, "How did they arrange this most difficult entrance? It's been a few years since anyone has been able to pass through this entrance."

The farmer just shook his head, "The Association requires it."

"This is a joke, you and I both know what level of cultivation is needed to pass through this entrance," the magician said.

"I can't guarantee that I can get through this entrance and then successfully obtain the artifact," the farmer replied.

The magician pressed on, "Can you guarantee that you can get through this entrance and then get the artifact?"

The farmer shook his head, "So, we're guarding here, not him."

"Ha, I'll just warm up by going in and rescuing them," the magician said...

Zhao Xiu had a bag full of teleportation stones in his backpack.

Four of them were the "Seven Rings Escape Technique", which allowed him to shatter the stones and return to a designated location after.

The other four were the "Gem Jump Technique", which allowed him to teleport to another location.

The farmer was not saying he couldn't teleport, but that it would cost him a price.

This statement is definitely worth exploring.

Moreover, he didn't expect that he would have to go through another barrier on the other side.

As Zhao Xiu stepped down from the mining stairs, he suddenly realized that his torch had gone out, and the darkness enveloped him tightly.
Here is the translation of the text:

As he just descended from the nearly thirty-story staircase, the entrance hole was far away, leaving only a small white light, like a small window.

Zhao Xu also cast a "Uyin Eye" spell on himself, allowing him to see through the darkness.

He looked around and didn't find any reason for the flame torch that had just dimmed.

However, he didn't say anything and continued to move forward towards the front entrance.

The conditions of this underground tunnel were extremely unfavorable, with the entire tunnel being artificially dug out of mud and sand, making the walls and floor rough and unrefined.

Zhao Xu walked along the tunnel, with occasional sand falling from the ceiling due to his footsteps. Despite causing no harm, it kept stimulating his already taut nerves.

Finally, Zhao Xu's pace came to a halt.

He looked at the completely dead-end wall in front of him with a hint of astonishment.

Just after he descended the staircase, there was no branching path, so he had walked a straight path to the end, and the front road had disappeared.
