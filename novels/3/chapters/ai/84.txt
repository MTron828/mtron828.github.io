Chapter 085: The Name of the Abyss

Despite the fact that there was no unusual noise around them, everyone's eyes were scanning their surroundings as if something was about to emerge from a hidden corner at any moment.

They saw the obvious handprints of struggling people, and everyone's face fell.

Zhao Xiu, who had been full of confidence, began to worry. This situation was likely to make his team members lose heart.

Compared to the four people who pursued wealth and the ones who sought to climb to the top, Zhao Xiu was seeking adventure itself.

Anzhen gave him three cards, not to let him return safely to Mistral, but to let him temper himself.

If Zhao Xiu returned safely and reported to Anzhen, he would have killed a few goblins and successfully preserved the three cards, and this trial would be over.

Therefore, Zhao Xiu did not resist the risks of adventure. If a ancient black dragon appeared that night, he would undoubtedly release the divine messenger on the spot to fight it.

He wanted to avoid being trapped by someone else's trap.

For example, if he fell into this pit and found that it was a trap set by others to kill him, he would only be ridiculed by Anzhen when he returned to Mistral.

This situation raised the question of how to make a choice.

It was a small gain to avoid a 10-level druid and to use the prayer candle to scare away the ghosts. Zhao Xiu had also expected this pit to give him another small gain.

However, looking at this scene, it seemed that this pit was not as simple as just a small gain.

"What are you guys planning?" Zhao Xiu, who was not a person who sat idly by while his companions died, finally spoke up.
Here is the translation:

"If he couldn't react in time, he would be wiped out, and he could only ensure his own safety. 'What's the plan?' Warrior Maple Leaf was momentarily stunned.

'Are we going to keep moving forward? Now that we've seen those hellish words and these blood-red handprints. As long as it's related to the Abyssal Hell, none of it is simple.' Zhao Xu spoke softly.

The war for sealing the demon that lasted for several years in the previous life, even the top players in the first year, including Arthur, didn't spare many lives.

'Let's go, we're already here,' Warrior Maple Leaf said, and the other three nodded.

Seeing that they were willing to persevere, Luo Ya also let out a sigh of relief.

After completing his reminder duty, Zhao Xu didn't say much, and Warrior Maple Leaf and the others estimated that there were still many revival stones left. Naturally, they thought that exploring was a profitable business.

It was only when they had only one revival stone left that players would realize that ability was Arthur's top priority.

The mining pit had several branches, and Zhao Xu and the others could only start exploring in a clockwise direction, searching for that hidden underground city.

After looking at those handprints, they didn't dare to split up to explore.

However, as they moved forward together, forming a formation, they did encourage each other.

Luo Ya led the team through a narrow path about two people wide and entered a wide hall. Inside, except for some already collapsed cabinets in the corner, there were many broken and dusty beds on the floor.

This hall was likely the dormitory of the miners, and the surrounding walls were opened and then neatly stacked. Unlike the path just passed, it wasn't as chaotic."
Here is the translation of the text:

The two mages, Mr. Mr., do you have a spell to detect hidden doors?" asked Liao Yang, looking at a half-closed wooden door.

"I don't have one," said the poet, Qing Wa.

The poet was not yet at level 2 and couldn't use the first-level spell "Detect Hidden Door" anyway. Even if he had it, he wouldn't choose this obscure spell. As a poet, he could only choose from a limited set of spells, just like a wizard.

"Detect Hidden Door" was a knowledge-based spell, and Zhao Xu did know it, but he had not expected to come to the underground castle that morning and had prepared the "Divination" spell instead. If he really wanted to switch to "Detect Hidden Door", he would have to use his "Multi-Talented Mage" specialty to consume two zero-level spells to release it.

"Let's go in and take a look around. We can search for hidden doors later," Zhao Xu thought to himself and suggested to Liao Yang.

Liao Yang nodded slightly.

They were not yet at their destination, just a simple miner's dormitory, and the probability of encountering hidden rooms and traps was low.

However, they were still cautious when approaching the half-closed door. Liao Yang held a heavy steel shield and leaned against the door, ready to defend against any sudden attacks from inside.

Warrior Maple Leaf held a giant sword, preparing to push open the wooden door.

Meanwhile, Wu Zhen, the martial artist, stood with his back to the group, ready to defend against any unexpected attacks from behind.

As the main light source, Yu Yu held a torch, while Zhao Xu focused intently, holding his single-handed bow, aiming at the room inside.

If there were no handprints, everyone would probably just burst into the room without hesitation.

"Now I'll open the door," Maple Leaf reminded everyone, and since there were no objections, he gently pushed his giant sword forward.

"Eh!" a voice cried out.
As the door creaked open, everyone's heart skipped a beat. "Altar?" Luo Ya, who was standing at the front, was the first to take in the scene inside the room. "I'm going in. You all follow me."

After saying that, he slowly walked forward, shield at the ready, with Maple Leaf and two wandering souls following closely behind. Rainbow, who was serving as a scout, was completely focused on listening skills, constantly monitoring the surroundings for any signs of danger.

"Not feeling right, let's sing a song," Zhao Xu whispered to the poet.

At this moment, the poet's zero-level magic and archery skills were of little use, so he decided to sing a song to boost everyone's morale instead.

As they all entered the room, except for the whirlwind, who was still standing at the door, observing the outside, the others, illuminated by the torchlight, were shocked by what they saw.

This room, located next to the miner's dormitory, was not large, with a corner featuring a collapsed bed and a table with discarded items, indicating that this might have been the foreman's office.

However, the walls, floor, and ceiling were all painted with blood-red text, with all the text pointing towards the empty altar.

"I think we should notify the nearby church to send a pastor here," Yao Yao said, her body trembling, but she was holding it together because she was surrounded by her friends.

"Don't worry," Zhao Xu replied, squatting down and examining the ground with the lantern. "These things are probably just paint."

In the past, he had worked with the benevolent pastor to eradicate some demonic rituals, and he was familiar with this kind of situation, remaining completely calm.
The translation of the text is:

"Anyway, they're all made of flesh and blood, and a single cut will kill them, let alone a ghostly disturbance. 'These hellish scriptures are all variants of the same name.'"

Yu Yu took a deep breath and continued, "What name?"

"What name?" Zhao Xu asked again.

"Dymo Gao Gen," Yu Yu replied.
