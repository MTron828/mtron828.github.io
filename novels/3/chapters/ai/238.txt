Chapter 239: The Mortal God of Battle

Zhao Xu, holding the massive scythe, finally felt the power of his magic coursing through him, taking his output to a terrifying level.

Even for a former five-star warrior like him, quickly resolving these warriors was not a simple matter.

When fighting, weapons and armor were like fire and hammer, constantly colliding and clashing. Sometimes, after a battle, the spoils of war would not even be enough to have the blacksmith repair the broken and deformed armor.

Otherwise, Zhao Xu wouldn't have become a law enforcement officer, and he wouldn't have had to arrange for his parents to open a brick factory to increase their income.

However, breaking through the defense of a fully armored enemy was not always easy. One had to find the weak points in the armor and shield, and only then could one cause fatal damage.

Zhao Xu had just successfully slaughtered two people, causing panic and relying on the power of his magic.

The most direct reason was that he had the "Sustained Magic" ability, which lasted for 24 hours and allowed him to use the "Ghost Strike" technique.

The technique was as its name suggested - a ghostly strike that couldn't be defended against. Unless others in the area had acquired magic-enhanced abilities, such as bias force fields, evasion shields, or holy power shields.

Otherwise, most people could only rely on their agility and the defensive capabilities of their armor.

Zhao Xu's Ghost Strike technique treated armor as if it were nothing, and in a situation where he was not targeting his opponent intentionally, he would naturally kill one enemy after another.

Everyone would experience a visual disparity, thinking that his weapon had not hit the opponent, but in reality, his weapon had actually hit the opponent.

Zhao Xu even felt the delay caused by the sword striking a blocking object.
Here is the translation of the text:

However, the obstacle that others collided with is armor, but he, having a ghostly strike technique, directly collided with the physical body.

In reality, as long as you remove the armor from those who have fallen to the ground, you can see the internal wounds.

It is because Zhao Xu has applied the "High-Grade Unusual Strike" spell to his "Giant Scythe" that it appears to strike at a distance. This spell allows him to enlarge the size of his weapon.

Generally speaking, humans of average body type use middle-sized weapons like Zhao Xu's Giant Scythe and Zhang Qi's Giant Sword. They can also use small-sized weapons, which are easy to handle.

Even originally large swords that require both hands to hold can be reduced to a small size and can be held with one hand.

The strength of the weapon increases with the size of the weapon. However, people cannot intentionally use large weapons for the sake of causing harm.

Large single-handed weapons are difficult for humans with average body type to wield, requiring both hands to hold them. For example, a large scythe like this requires both hands to wield, making it difficult to wield and reducing its attack power.

The "High-Grade Unusual Strike" spell is a skill that can enlarge the size of the weapon. It does not change the size of the weapon in one's hand, but rather surrounds the weapon with an invisible light circle to enlarge it. Zhao Xu's middle-sized "Giant Scythe" has been upgraded three levels and has crossed over the large and super-large sizes, reaching the "Giant" level.

It is worth noting that even giants who are almost 7 meters tall and weigh over 5 tons use super-large weapons. Therefore, those people who have been struck by Zhao Xu's weapon may not have been hit by the physical weapon itself, but have actually been affected by the light circle that is equivalent to a giant weapon.
Here is the translation of the text:

By doing so, the effectiveness of "Ghost Strike" has been hidden. Zhao Xu doesn't need to demonstrate to everyone how his "giant scythe" can disappear and then enter the opponent's body. This is also intentional on Zhao Xu's part to spread fear of death. After reading the biography of the God of Death, he understands that the way to please the God of Death is to create unimaginable death methods. Therefore, even if "Higher Unusual Frenzy" can only enhance the damage of "blunt" weapons, such as Zhao Xu's giant scythe, which is a "cutting" or "piercing" type of damage, it will not increase the damage. It won't change the "2D4 (2-8)" damage to "4D6 (4-24)" damage. However, Zhao Xu still chooses to use this technique to complement "Ghost Strike". Because the psychological effect of intimidation has already been sufficient. Moreover, at this point, Zhao Xu can feel the vague outline of the transmission portal in his mind, indicating that he is on the right track. After experiencing the "Sustained Spell", Zhao Xu realizes that his supernatural expertise is extremely lacking, so he must obtain the "Steel Will". With the avatar of the awakened artifact, Laxus, he can immediately grant him supernatural expertise. At this time, Zhao Xu is no longer satisfied with the sparse crowd in front of him, and he directly activates the arbitrary door spell on his body to directly enter the battlefield where the personal bodyguards are most concentrated. He needs to use enough attack times to trigger his beheading effect. Each battle will add a heavy burden to the psychological state of these bodyguards.
Here is the translation of the text:

Just now, Zhao Xu's second slash was successful in decapitating the enemy, and this was due to two factors. On the one hand, his slash was extremely precise, with a performance level of nearly 20, directly triggering a critical hit. On the other hand, Zhao Xu had just used the "High-Grade Enhanced Weapon" and chose the most domineering ability, "Decapitation", which has a maximum bonus of +5 and can trigger a decapitation effect on all humanoid creatures.

As long as the critical hit is successful, it can trigger the decapitation effect, which is a fatal effect. In reality, Zhao Xu's slash caused 4 times the damage, and the warrior was instantly killed. The decapitation effect triggered afterwards was already useless.

However, the decapitation effect brought about a state of panic, similar to that caused by killing dozens of people. All onlookers were terrified by the mysterious decapitation sword aura that suddenly appeared.

Zhao Xu's sudden flash intervention on the battlefield also made the surrounding bodyguards tremble with fear. However, their constant training and combat instincts allowed them to quickly respond by charging towards Zhao Xu with their long spears.

However, when their ordinary long spears collided with Zhao Xu's "Stellar Cloak", they were instantly shattered into five pieces. Zhao Xu seized the opportunity and saw two ghostly images of himself swinging his massive scythe.

Zhao Xu's body automatically adapted to one of them, and he swung his massive scythe forward with a circular motion. The angle was extremely precise, as if he had made a pre-emptive calculation, and directly cut into the defensive blind spot of an incoming bodyguard.

Just like before, the "Massive Scythe" had not yet reached its target when it was completed by the glow of "High-Grade Unusual Strike" and the piercing attack of "Ghost Strike Technique", resulting in a kill.
Here is the translation of the text:

Essentially, Zhao Xu relied on the massive effect of the scythe in his hand, making it inevitable that someone would die by his sword.

At this time, the team leader of the guards discovered something amiss and hurriedly shouted, "Don't bother, surround that scythe mage first!"

Although he found it hard to believe that the man who was using the scythe to reap lives was a mage, the opponent's mage robe and cloak only allowed him to make this judgment.

For the miners' association, the miners' discipline was unparalleled among all trades, and the mine owner's personal bodyguards were even more so. As soon as they heard the news, they sprang into action.

Just as Zhao Xu had cut down one person, he turned to see the other seven bodyguards approaching him with long spears and giant swords. However, he was not the least bit intimidated.

At this moment, he continued to use the "Flowing Strike" technique, simultaneously taking down another guard who was standing relatively close by.

"Flowing Strike" was a technique exclusive to warriors, which could only generate a single burst of power. Zhao Xu relied on the residual force of his previous strike to attack again.

The prerequisite for releasing this technique was that he had to take down an enemy and let the force of his previous strike dissipate.

Only then could he use the residual force to counterattack.

However, Zhao Xu was not satisfied with just one strike. He had already ignited his inner potential once again.

He jumped forward, slashing at the guards who were rushing towards him from the side, and then followed up with another "Flowing Strike" against the guards who had already approached him.

The sword flashed, and another head rolled off, taking the second person's life.

However, Zhao Xu's momentum did not wane, and he continued to win, his momentum like a river flowing endlessly.

Each strike was a success, and the seven guards fell one by one.
Here is the translation of the text:

Within a round, eight people lost their lives.

The battlefield, which was previously crowded, suddenly became empty, with only the souls of the deceased wandering around aimlessly.

At this moment, the leader, who was riding a horse, let out a loud shout: "Big Sway Cut!" It was clear that he had recognized this warrior's secret move.

As a warrior in his past life, Zhao Xu had only learned the "Sway Cut" technique, but had never touched the "Big Sway Cut".

However, his eyes had already reddened, and he was no longer concerned with the increasingly clear transmission door image in his mind. He simply charged forward without hesitation.

"Escape!"

Someone suddenly shouted, and the private bodyguards of the mine owner all scattered and fled. The battlefield, which had previously been a chaotic scene, suddenly reversed.

However, the players realized that they no longer needed to rush forward.

The wizard, dressed in a cloak and wielding a giant scythe, seemed like a Grim Reaper. No matter how far the guards escaped, he could always arrive late and strike from behind, killing them with a single stroke.

Throughout the entire process, no one was able to let the Grim Reaper strike twice.

"He can't possibly attack so perfectly every time!"

At this moment, one player had just recovered from the shock of the beheading and murmured to himself in amazement.

"And his attack power is so strong? The guards' defense was as fragile as paper! Even if the armor was fake, it should have succeeded a few times through dodging!"

"Don't be ridiculous, you just killed someone, have you?" someone directly challenged, causing another person to turn red with anger.
Here is the translation of the text:

"I must have seen things." A player couldn't help but rub his eyes after seeing Zhao Xu harvest the life of a guard once again.

The last guard was already running frantically in the opposite direction towards the player group.

However, before the guard could get close to the player group, Zhao Xu's figure appeared behind him, and he struck with his sword, taking him away.

At this point, on the battlefield, the 70 guards who were still alive when Zhao Xu entered the battlefield were all beheaded by him.

In the end,

Zhao Xu gripped the massive scythe, standing steadfastly with his back to the setting sun on the horizon, like a statue.

The afterglow stretched his shadow to its limits, almost touching the players on the opposite side, causing those who were close by to involuntarily take a few steps back, fearing they would step on the shadow.

Zhao Xu, on the other hand, gazed impassively at the players in front of him, allowing the fresh blood dripping from his sword to fall onto the dry land.
