Chapter 403: Interest-Free Loan

Zhao Xuyu listened calmly.

Unlike the Earth, where money can be freely stored, the wealth on this planet is difficult to transfer. Even with the intervention of the Commercial Goddess Temple, it's hard to transfer wealth to another place. Currently, setting up a specific regional account is only possible through a large guild or powerful organization.

Before this, Zhao Xuyu had entrusted the Archbishop of the Winter City Goddess Temple to exchange his battlefield achievements in the Star Lake War for a mineral deposit, and then put the "Crystal of Secret Silver" into it.

As a result, the silver mine produced "Secret Silver" after processing, and after being refined and sold by the Mineral Association, the monthly dividend was 50,000 gold coins.

Moreover, the Archbishop also arranged for Zhao Xuyu to set up a "Mineral Dividend Account" and directly linked it to his Magical Association identity.

This allowed Zhao Xuyu to withdraw this amount of money through the Magician's Association in the entire Northern Alliance.

This made Zhao Xuyu feel a surge of excitement, and the next time he met the Goddess, he would definitely pat the Archbishop's shoulder and say something like, "The Archbishop is a good comrade."

Ordinary silver mines can only produce a small amount of secret silver, and the production volume is low and rare.

Even Zhao Xuyu, who made a significant contribution in the Star Lake War, can only produce a few thousand gold coins per month.
Here is the translation of the text:

This year's 600 gold coins, he is still a small-town law enforcement officer, which is equivalent to a county-level public security bureau chief. However, there are too many people vying for the mineral rights, making it impossible for him to take control of them.

Most of the mineral deposits are worth hundreds to tens of thousands of gold coins, and after deducting production and processing costs, the profit is relatively stable and consistent. However, the current output of 50,000 gold coins per month is largely due to the power of the "Mystic Silver Crystal".

Converting it to gold coins, it would be nearly 6 million gold coins per year. This is a typical long-term and stable mineral extraction, and the power of the "Mystic Silver Crystal" can be fully utilized.

According to the nine-ring method of the advanced jade master, Frank, if the mineral composition is good and the extraction is patient enough, it is not difficult to produce tens of millions of gold coins.

This "Mystic Silver Crystal" can sustain consumption for about 20 years before its output decreases to a few thousand gold coins per month. Regardless, this mineral deposit is indeed a good investment for future generations.

Frank, when he first obtained this "Mystic Silver Crystal", probably thought of using it as a material for leveling up, and didn't want to spend it all on gold coins.

For legendary strong individuals, they already have the basics, and these black markets can't provide what they want.

"Then I have a budget of 100,000 gold coins?" Zhao Xuan asked.

Vivi also looked at the badge and chip that Frank had respectfully returned to him.

100,000 gold coins, which is enough to deceive many humans and buy many lives. For Vivi, this is a huge sum of money.
Here is the translation of the text:

Typically, adventurers of a 5th-level town boss would not have equipment worth more than 5,000 gold coins on them.

"Not just that," Saraqui explained hastily. "The silver ore vein is, in a word, a hard currency."

As he spoke, he sneaked a glance at Zhao Xu, saying casually, "According to my knowledge, the silver ore vein in Starfall Town has countless powerful forces from the Northern Alliance involved in the division. Although Starfall Town was occupied by Earth adventurers later on, the basic division has not changed much, and only the original owners' shares were re-allocated."

Saraqui's head drooped further, and he didn't dare to speculate further.

"Hard currency?" Zhao Xu immediately understood the meaning.

On Earth, the Qing dynasty used tariffs to secure debts. If silver ore production is stable, it would be a extremely solid security.

"How much can it secure?" Zhao Xu asked immediately.

Saraqui's eyes lit up, knowing the other party was also knowledgeable, and he didn't need to elaborate on the benefits and drawbacks. He was thinking about how he could also make a profit from the transaction, and he became even more excited.
Here is the translation:

"Mister Zhongxia, you can borrow up to 600,000 gold coins here. Then, a fixed amount of silver mining revenue will be deducted from you every month for a year. If the revenue is insufficient, you will have to make up the difference personally. If you fail to make up the difference on time, you will be charged an interest rate of 10% per year."

As he spoke, Sarazzi's eyes seemed to gaze at Zhao Xu for a few seconds, his expression as if he was condescending. "If you want a higher credit limit, you'll have to personally handle the long-term mortgage, and the repayment period will certainly be longer, and the interest rate will be higher as well."

Zhao Xu nodded silently, indicating that he understood.

In essence, it's like interest-free lending to him, with a repayment period. This might be a "face-saving" gesture on behalf of the other party, after seeing the "Shining Silver Secret".

Even if he were to apply for a loan, with the silver mine as collateral, he might be able to borrow hundreds of millions of gold coins.

But Zhao Xu didn't think about it that way. He wasn't used to engaging in such "crossing-the-boundary" loan transactions on Earth.

So, in Arthus, he was given this opportunity instead.

"Might as well be enough, let's go straight to the VIP area," Zhao Xu thought to himself, not putting too much thought into it, as he didn't have the legendary intelligence headgear with +12 wisdom.

He didn't need to give up a long-term benefit for a few hundred million gold coins.

..."

After borrowing 600,000 gold coins, Zhao Xu was directly led to a dark, luxurious hall with a glass cabinet on the wall, filled with various magical items that looked extraordinary.

At the same time, a monk-like man with a shaved head stood beside them, his hands on his hips.
Here is the translation of the text:

Compared to ordinary adventurers, the opponent's attire was extremely ancient, with no protective gear, not even a pair of boxing gloves. On his back, he had a staff with a wooden handle that was already worn out and white-haired.

Zhao Xu took a moment to examine the mysterious tattooed monk and said nothing more.

"There are at least three targets surrounding us," Vivian said, using her spiritual intuition to sense her surroundings.

"Sorry, Mr. Zhuming, this is against the rules," Salar replied, looking apologetic.

"Vow of poverty?" Zhao Xu suddenly interjected.

The tattooed monk's eyes flashed with a brilliant light, and he smiled, saying, "Mr. Wizard, according to the rules, you cannot guess our identity and abilities."

"I apologize," Zhao Xu smiled.

It's indeed a chicken-and-egg situation, where the egg comes from the chicken, and the chicken comes from the egg.

The Vow of Poverty is a "Champion Specialty" that only virtuous characters can choose. Once obtained, every level increase will grant new abilities.

If you start from level 1 and choose this specialty, you can gain up to 15 levels of defense, +8 to +2 attribute enhancements, 10 virtues, and 10 points of energy protection, 10 points of damage reduction, +3 anti-magic resistance, true knowledge, fasting, and other unique abilities.

Among the 10 virtues, there are countless options.

Zhao Xu would become unstoppable if he had this ability, transforming his chaotic dual energies into other specialties, directly making him invincible on the spot.

Unfortunately, once you take the Vow of Poverty, you can never use magical items again, and you'll have to give up all your gains during the adventure.

So Zhao Xu had to reluctantly give up this ability.
Here is the translation of the text:

Arthur also tends to lean towards the "poverty oath" stream among the equipment-dependent "clerics" and "warriors". This warrior is able to take the poverty oath, indicating that the opponent is also a virtuous character, which allows Zhao Xu to lower his guard, at least not worrying about being scammed here.

Virtuous warriors will accept underground security jobs and receive wages from the underground after completing the task. However, they will never cooperate with the underground to scam adventurers, as this will cause them to lose their "Chong Shan specialty".

However, Zhao Xu also discovered that these virtuous characters who cannot wear magical equipment are actually the best candidates to guard these magical items. Besides not stealing or stealing, they can also provide reassuring reverse guarantees.

At this time, Salarazi respectfully handed over a sheepskin "register", saying, "Mr. Zhongxia, this register records the magical items existing in this hall, and the last few pages also record some magical items that are not stored here." "This includes legendary items in disrepair," Salarazi said with a look of envy and unattainable elegance.
