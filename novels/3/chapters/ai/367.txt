Chapter 368: Transformation

Just as the flash of lightning, Zhao Xu lifted his hand and knocked down the wizard and the several guards behind him.

Among all attributes, the vitality attribute returning to zero would result in immediate death, while other attributes returning to zero would lead to a state of helplessness, similar to being knocked out.

As a wizard, agility is generally not very high.

So, Zhao Xu's "Frosty Touch" spell, which deals 3-18 points of agility damage, combined with the characteristics of no immunity and no resistance to magic, would make it extremely likely that the opponent would be knocked down.

In this instant, Rock, the team leader of the swordsmen, also suddenly released a one-ring "Weakening Ray" and shot it at the guard who had not been struck by the Unicorn's attack.

For close-range professionals, the "Weakening Ray" spell, which reduces 1-6 points of strength, is a decent negative spell.

In an instant, the emotional signal was sent out, and the entire tavern erupted into chaos. The drunkards who had just been drinking and were now stumbling around suddenly stood up, grabbed the chairs they had been sitting on, and smashed them against the guards. The scene quickly turned into a brawl.

Zhao Xu couldn't help but laugh at the sight. After the swordsmen took action, there were people who could "back up" the situation, essentially saying that they had taken the lead.

As a result, no one could grasp the situation, and the sword team would likely embark on a journey of escape if the opposite family pursued them. At the moment Zhao Xu took action, the sword team was equivalent to being caught with their pants down, with no clear reasoning. Therefore, the mage had to make a decisive move to maintain the morale of the team. Zhao Xu gazed at the scene unfolding before him, but he didn't pay attention to anything else. He had already defeated the strongest mage in the scene, and this group of people couldn't even defeat four bodyguards, let alone go on a wild goose chase. At this moment, he looked at the innocent-looking female adventurer sitting on the sofa, who had lost her control over her magical consciousness and was momentarily at a loss. As for players, they had a spiritual protection period and wouldn't be affected by this kind of mind control spell. However, the residents of Aria would have to suffer the consequences on their own. Zhao Xu sent Buddha to the west, naturally to help this outstanding female adventurer remove the control of the "Dominate Human" spell. Among the three-ring spells, "Remove Magic" can be said to be the most direct "answer" and the most instinctive reaction of most mages. "Remove Magic" often appears when mages don't know what spell to prepare and make a hasty decision. It can terminate spells currently in effect on living beings, objects, or regions. Of the three uses of "Remove Magic", "Targeted Removal" is the most common. As long as Zhao Xu used "Remove Magic" on Ralier, he could help her remove that spell. But it's only a possibility.
Here is the translation of the text:

Canceling the magic, in itself, is a mental battle against one's own will, but it's not a level-based battle between the two spellcasters.

The difficulty of canceling the check is based on the level of the spellcaster, with a minimum of 11th level. However, considering the level of the spellcaster and the level of the spell, the difficulty is at least 20th level.

Zhao Xu's check level is his own level as a spellcaster, plus 1-20 levels of mastery. The level cap for the spellcaster is 10th level, so even if Zhao Xu has reached 12th level, he can only be calculated at 10th level.

Only a 6th-level advanced canceling magic can reach the 20th level.

Zhao Xu, therefore, can only cancel the "Control Humans" spell at a level of around 5-6. However, Zhao Xu has another non-standard 3rd-level spell, "Heart's Serenity", which he casts directly.

Canceling the spell requires a certain success rate, but Zhao Xu, who has a deeper understanding of magic, can force the canceling of the "Control Humans" spell.

If the 6th-level "Healing" spell is used to heal physical wounds,

the 3rd-level "Heart's Serenity" spell is used to heal psychological wounds.

The range of the spell's effect is determined by level, so after selecting Rachel, Zhao Xu also sent another 10 people, including himself.

Instantly, all the affected individuals have their fear effects, despair effects, and other psychological effects, including enthrallment and coercion (such as "Control Humans"), terminated by this spell. At the same time, it brings a sense of peace to the mind.

"What's weird is that I just used my fists to punch that guard, and I feel a sense of clarity in my mind, and I'm in a good mood, so I don't want to fight anymore."
"You're not kidding, maybe it's just that you're not used to fighting like a punching bag, so you're getting pounded by me."

In an instant, Laetitia's eyes cleared and became transparent, and she turned her head to look around, wondering which powerful person had freed her from her slave's fate.

However, the tavern was already in a state of chaos, with people rushing about and making it impossible to see anything clearly.

Zhao Xu walked out of the tavern, feeling the cold wind blowing from outside, and couldn't help but wrap his cloak around his body.

The star-patterned cloak was good for everything, except it didn't keep out the cold.

After the warmth of the day, the frost that had accumulated overnight finally revealed its stern face.

Zhao Xu thought for a moment and decided to cast the "Endure Environment" spell on himself.

Under the effect of this spell, the temperature range of -45 to 60 degrees Celsius would automatically adjust to a comfortable range for Zhao Xu to feel.

Instantly, the cold sensation on his body disappeared, and he found that it was even more effective than using a warm air machine by the fireplace.

At this moment, the lightly closed door of the tavern creaked open, and a blood-curdling scream echoed out, seemingly unrelated to the previous few people.

It was clear that the fight had just begun to escalate, and some latent conflicts were taking advantage of the situation to unfold.

As it happened, the cavalry from a few days ago had asked him, and the young man in traditional Chinese clothing had also asked him about Zhao Xu's identity. As long as Zhao Xu revealed his true identity, no one would dare to offend him.

Moreover, as a pastor, Zhao Xu had a certain background to rely on.

However, Zhao Xu had never liked to meddle in the affairs of the Saint Mother's Order.

Or, he didn't need to use his personal abilities to solve problems or rely on his background connections to intervene.

It was two different concepts.

Therefore, unless it was a matter that Zhao Xu's close friends had stirred up, and he couldn't handle it with his own abilities, he would only reveal his "background" to suppress the situation.
Here is the translation of the text:

Unless otherwise, ordinary people would find it unbearable and would use two spells to teach a lesson, rather than being truly merciful and benevolent towards all humanity.

At this moment, Zhao Xu glanced at his coordinate axis, with the horizontal axis representing the axis of good and evil, with the left side being more benevolent and the right side being more evil. The vertical axis represented the axis of order and chaos, with the top being more orderly and the bottom being more chaotic.

The neutral camp was located in the narrow region between the two axes, and absolute neutrality was represented by the smallest square region at the center.

At this moment, Zhao Xu noticed that even if he truly had a reason to feel disgusted, his current coordinates were still moving towards the direction of "good".

However, on the order-chaos axis, he had moved slightly towards the direction of "chaos". If this happened a few more times, he would eventually slide towards the direction of "good" and "chaos".

Just as Zhao Xu was paying attention to his own camp's tendency, a sudden commotion erupted on the street.

In an instant, a group of warriors rode horses at full speed through the street, whipping their horses mercilessly and ignoring the fact that the horses' bit had already broken into bloody foam.

Behind them, a group of pursuers was chasing after them, creating a situation that made it clear that the strength of these pursuers was not to be underestimated.

At the same time, Zhao Xu noticed that a nearby mansion was engulfed in a massive fire that illuminated the dark night sky like a burning cloud.

The acrid smell of smoke wafted over, and Zhao Xu had already reacted, realizing that the mansion was the location of tonight's auction.

The basement of the mansion had been deliberately excavated to create a vast, empty hall that served as a casino during normal times. Today, however, it was being used as the venue for the auction.

It turned out that the mage family was indeed taking a heavy-handed approach.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

It's possible that the young man in traditional Chinese clothing entered the bar, saying that the items being auctioned off tonight are the tomb of their family's ancestor. Naturally, they wouldn't leave him the opportunity to spread the news. In fact, the wizarding family's words are like this, saying they're right or not right. After so many years, Arthur actually has become a convention, with no one in charge of guarding the tomb, making it possible to dig it up. Even the gods won't say a word about it. Therefore, the wizarding family in Mistral, in terms of family tombs, is unified in management and burial. Naturally, the items auctioned off tonight won't be from the unified burial site, but from other secluded tombs. Some wizards are indeed quite individualistic, even designing their own tombs as mazes for those with a connection. Therefore, if the auction master knows that the wizard who digs up the tomb can be traced back to the Mistral family, tonight's auction wouldn't be so grand. At this time, Zhao Xiu also smiled and turned back to look at the bar, probably thinking that the young man in traditional Chinese clothing has already been educated to have a swollen nose. He lightly tapped his finger, and suddenly Zhao's appearance began to change, as if his face was being re-modeled from a piece of clay. Zhao's appearance gradually transformed into the young man's appearance, and his clothes also changed to a well-crafted, thin wizard's robe. The "transformation spell"! This spell can transform a person into a similar biological form, even of the same species. At this moment, Zhao transformed into the young man and strode directly into the auction house. "Young master." The mounted knights searching for them noticed his appearance and immediately dismounted to bow down to him.
