Chapter 307: The Revenge of the Mage

Zhao Xun saw the members of the Guardian's Guild slowly backing away, and after creating some distance, he directly raised his hand to cast the two-ring spell "Cloud Mist Technique".

The "Wall" series of spells is a mage's defensive spell, especially the walls created by many creation spells, which are permanent and will not disappear.

Zhao Xun once used his intuition to cast the "Swift Explosion" spell in the treasure room of the Starfall Town, synchronizing it with the "Stone Wall Technique" to deflect the opponent's three-ring spell "Mage Disintegration Technique". As a result, he obtained a legendary staff and a high-level demon lord's staff.

The "Mist" series of spells is a mage's signature escape and group control spell.

If Zhao Xun was just a ordinary one-ring mage, he would only have one chance to escape when he encountered the three giants during the day: to release the one-ring spell "Hidden Mist Technique" and then desperately escape.

The two-ring "Cloud Mist Technique" has even greater power. Besides being able to determine the starting point of the cloud mist within a certain range, its area is also much larger.

The three-ring "Stinky Cloud Technique" can even make enemies trapped within it feel nauseous.

After Zhao Xun finished casting the spell, a mist wall suddenly formed behind him, with a thick and heavy fog that rose up to a height of about six meters, exceeding the surrounding cypress trees by about two meters. At the same time, the mist directly blocked the field of vision of everyone more than two meters away. Even if someone shot an arrow in their direction, it would only be a wild shot.
Here is the translation of the given text:

The mist itself is very stable and does not spread outwards. Moreover, the spell duration is 10 minutes per level, and it can maintain a full hour of effect. Therefore, it is impossible for a gust of wind blowing at a speed of 40-50 kilometers per hour to disperse this mist.

The four players who attacked Zhao Xu saw this scene and were initially shocked to the point of nearly losing their lives. Suddenly, they began to feel uneasy. They were using spells to block each other's line of sight, which was clearly a sign of a special intention.

"Brother, shall we forcibly disconnect and avoid the wind?" one of the mages couldn't help but ask.

"Don't be silly," the other mage replied. "If we forcibly disconnect, our physical bodies will remain here. You want us to lose all our equipment? That's not right. Let's just self-destruct instead."

Self-destruction is an ability unique to a few players and ordinary Arthur citizens do not possess it.

However, Zhao Xu was looking at his opponents without showing any emotion.

In reality, if these people were intentionally sent to kill him, he would also reciprocate with the Arthurian code of conduct, "an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth".

But, just as Zhao Xu and his companions were about to rescue the opposing side, they suddenly turned into wolves. "Come on and attack, kill the captives," one of the wolves yelled, trying to use the residual power from the article "Ten Commandments for Newbies" to seek a glimmer of life.

However, his fierce appearance did not stir any emotional response from Zhao Xu.

Zhao Xu was more aware of the entire array's bias.

The priest at the fifth ring has the "Redemption Spell", which allows them to restore their original allegiance as long as they sincerely repent. In theory, this spell is equivalent to shifting one's own "array of spirit".
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu took out a sacred seal from his pouch and began to recite a pure religious incantation, his eyes fixed on the four people.

The wanderer couldn't help but ask, "What's this priest saying?"

The priest frowned and translated, "It's a blessing that we will no longer have to endure the joys and sorrows of the mortal world, because our souls will be purified once again."

The wanderer and even the poet couldn't help but sneer, "How childish!"

The wanderer continued to mock, "Old Master told you, this foolish priest, if you hadn't reacted quickly, you would have already become a soul in the underworld."

The wanderer tried to provoke Zhao Xu again, hoping to get him angry and request a fair duel.

Since Zhao Xu had just used a mirage technique to dodge their attacks several times, the warrior's sword would have definitely killed him otherwise.

As a compromise, Zhao Xu handed over some magical items as a price, and the two sides were able to make peace.

However, Zhao Xu pointed directly at the wanderer, who was still mocking him nonstop.

At this moment, the ghostly demon standing beside him moved, its massive body quickly approaching the wanderer. Its eyes, filled with a sense of death, fixed tightly on the wanderer.

At this time, the four people finally noticed the ghostly demon, which had its chest ripped open, with its ribcage constantly opening and closing like a medical model. The atmosphere, which had been solemn and eerie, became even more bizarre.

The ghostly demon lowered its body, stretched out its long and withered claws to grab the wanderer, and then suddenly opened its huge mouth to suck him in.
Here is the translation of the text:

Suddenly, the wandering soul's entire face distorted, and the powers of countless souls were drawn into it, emitting a series of eerie, emerald-green lights. The process was extremely rapid, and the sated soul demon quickly shook off the wandering soul's corpse.

"No way, that's just a one-hit kill effect, I'll revive and become a strong warrior again," the mage exclaimed, hastily shouting to rally his teammates.

"But isn't that not Grandpa's appearance?" a warrior noticed a slight irregularity.

At this moment, the soul demon burst open its chest, revealing a small, human-like creature struggling and flailing its arms, with the face of the deceased wandering soul.

Instantly, the originally confident few people all felt a creeping sense of unease on the back of their necks.

Zhao Xu stood calmly by the side, expressionless.

As a level 11 undead being, the soul demon possessed abilities such as energy absorption, body binding, and spellcasting, as well as spell failure.

It was this ability that the soul demon had just used on the wandering soul.

This ability required the soul demon to successfully execute a normal attack first. Once the bound individuals could not withstand the difficulty of 19 levels of toughness, they would be killed on the spot.

More terrifyingly, the opponent's soul would also be absorbed into the soul demon's chest, rendering the target creature unable to revive or resurrect.

The wandering soul's first-person perspective would henceforth become that of the small person within the soul demon's chest.

Only spells of "Limited Prayer" and above could release it, but the soul demon would also disappear in the process.

The soul demon had already captured one person and was no longer able to capture others.
Here is the translation:

It directly exhibits the "True Knowledge" ability to itself and Zhao Xu, imbuing them with power.

Each time the "True Knowledge" ability is used, the small person trapped in the ribcage becomes weaker by a fraction, until the soul demon finally uses the ability five times, and the small person completely disappears, as if never existing.

The other three people, who witnessed the small person's disappearance, also vaguely understood something, but were terrified and wanted to curse Zhao Xu for bravery, but felt their throats dry.

Even they didn't have time to react, the corpse of the wandering spirit continued to remain intact.

The soul demon, born with the ability to bewilder, possesses eight kinds of magical abilities, including "Bewilderment", "True Knowledge", and "Control over the Dead". When it uses these abilities, it consumes soul energy.

As for the soul demon, it can bind a soul for every life dice a soul has in front of it, providing 5 times the ability to use magical powers.

Therefore, these 1st-level players can make the soul demon use 5 times the ability, but at the cost of depleting the soul, which will be extinguished.

This is also the fastest way for Zhao Xu to extinguish a soul.

Even the legendary "Soul Binding Rod" in his hand, with nine rings, is only a permanent binding of the soul, not destruction.

Zhao Xu now has the soul demon, and naturally, he no longer wastes the rod's energy.

Gradually, the soul demon catches up with the remaining three players, binding and imprisoning them, and then gradually exhausting their soul energy.

By the end, the two remaining opponents, with some courage, began to scold Zhao Xu, saying that they couldn't get a single bit of magical equipment from him.

However, they still lacked the courage to commit suicide in front of the soul demon, always holding onto the last glimmer of hope.
Here is the translation of the text:

If the other party really had the courage to do that, Zhao Xu would use the "Soul Binding" spell to capture the soul, making it a corpse. The Soul Binding spell is also the weakness of the Soul Prison Demon, which takes a whole five rounds to digest a 1st-level soul and has a low difficulty of 19% to successfully bind the soul. Unlike the Soul Binding spell in Zhao Xu's undead staff, which has a difficulty of 34 levels, it's a total kill on low-end targets.

After finishing the setup and destroying the corpse, Zhao Xu also brought the "Soul Prison Demon" along with him as he left. When he returned to the main team, everyone re-equipped and set off again.

The members of the Guardian's Guild didn't ask about the fate of those players again, not even the saintly priest who understood Zhao Xu's actions.

"Suddenly, Frostbite opened his mouth, which rarely interacted with Zhao Xu, saying, "Ah, you're feeling a bit of a killing aura on your undead creature?"

"Uh?" Zhao Xu replied.

"My nemesis is undead creatures, so I'm sensitive to this aspect. You just used your undead creature to resolve them?" Frostbite asked.

Before Zhao Xu could respond, Frostbite interrupted him, saying, "That's what they deserve. Those players are also our enemies, and they're the key figures in this task."

Zhao Xu nodded in agreement, and the guild members in the team also nodded in agreement, emphasizing the importance of teamwork and camaraderie in the revolution.

Since Zhao Xu had fought twice, he had gained a certain status in the team. Therefore, when he was attacked just then, the warriors rushed over to help him, taking down the enemy.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Furious Wind, don't worry. This grudge won't end with just one step. As long as we find the wizard tower and return to Mistral, I will go and round them up again and settle the score once more." Frost Sword said directly to Zhao Xu with a solemn expression.

"Don't worry, I've already taken revenge on them," Zhao Xu replied calmly.

When the players of the guild heard this, they all laughed together.

Musing, this furious wind wizard still underestimated some players. Sometimes, only players can find players.

At this time, the members of the Guardian's Guild were still online, unaware of the extent of Zhao Xu's revenge.
