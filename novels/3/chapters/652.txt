Chapter 653: Evil Spirit Light, Demon Possession

"'Your aunt Liu's daughter looks like she's in a bad state,' said the mother, grasping Zhao Xiu's sleeve. 'I had no choice but to call you back. Do you remember when I brought you back then?'"

At this moment, the mother's words were interrupted by the commotion around her. The sound of wailing and crying ceased, as if everyone had suddenly realized the connection between them.

Originally, they thought the woman crying in the corner was just a former colleague of Zhao's mother from her younger years, and never suspected that she had once helped Zhao Xiu. "This situation is quite serious?" someone asked, shivering with cold.

"Shouldn't we call the pastor from next door to take a look?" someone else suggested.

"Yes, don't delay the patient's treatment."

At this moment, Liu Auntie, who had been sitting quietly in the corner, had already shed tears.

"Zhilili had already arranged for the pastor to take a look, but he couldn't find anything wrong, just that the patient's body was malnourished," she said.

Zhilili is actually the name of Zhao Xiu's mother.

It was only when the pastor's treatment had no effect that Zhao's mother had rushed to call her son back.

This woman, who could address Zhao Xiu's mother without any title, was the heavyweight presence in this room.

"My mom, I know," Zhao Xiu said, wearing a cloak and already wearing a suit of armor. His excellent demeanor, combined with his new outfit, made him even more eye-catching.

Even if one overlooked his identity, anyone who looked at him would feel a surge of desire to marry Zhao Xiu's mother.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu gently tapped his mother's shoulder and cast a reassuring glance at Liu Auntie beside him. When Zhao Xu was a child, he once played the "Treasure Hunt" game with his friends from the neighborhood, including Nan Xiaoyi. Without realizing it, he wandered out of the alleys and got lost. At that time, he couldn't recognize the way back home.

Luckily, he encountered Liu Auntie, who was a colleague of his mother's, and she recognized Zhao Xu and pulled him out of the crowd. Otherwise, he might have been kidnapped or lost in the chaotic era.

In that era, people would steal fruit from the street vendor, and beggars would snatch food from the street vendors. The "flying car" gang, who rode motorcycles and snatched packages, were also prevalent.

When Zhao Xu was brought back home by Liu Auntie, his family was in a state of panic, with his relatives from his hometown receiving phone calls and preparing to come together to search for him. Eventually, they were relieved to find out that he was safe and sound.

After that, Zhao Xu was scolded by his parents and almost became the stepchild of Liu Auntie. If he hadn't asked his elders about it, he would have been forced to address Liu Auntie as "auntie" from then on.

Later, Zhao's father quit his job and started a business, working hard to earn a living. Zhao's mother had to give up her job to take care of the family, and they eventually moved to a new home. As a result, Zhao Xu's relatives realized that Liu Auntie, who had almost become his stepmother, was actually an ordinary middle-aged woman who had been worn down by time.

Thinking back to the past, Zhao Xu felt a strong sense of nostalgia.
Here is the translation of the text:

As his intelligence increased, he could now recall the scene where the other person had lifted him up and then bought him a delicious McFlurry from McDonald's.

"Liu Auntie, don't worry, I'll find a way," he said, consoling her while scanning his abilities, which had already scanned the 18-year-old girl in front of him multiple times.

Arthur, everything was related to the magical effect, with a probability of 8.9 out of 10.

Therefore, the "Detection Magic" method was often the first step in finding the problem and tracing the source.

At this moment, Zhao Xiu had both the professional ability of the "Curse Guardian" - "Secret Vision" and the ability of the "Detection Magic" from the voters.

Among the three rings of Secret Vision, it was faster than the single-ring Detection Magic in recognizing the position and intensity of the spiritual light without requiring simultaneous attention.

Meanwhile, the Detection Magic was more like opening a camera on a phone.

On the other hand, Secret Vision was more subtle, like wearing glasses.

However, with enough expertise and potential, Zhao Xiu could also perform the spell silently.

He lightly raised his hand, and the "Detection of Evil" spell, combined with the natural law, was effortlessly cast out.

If the detection magic was ineffective, the detection of evil would be the next step.

As everyone waited with bated breath, Zhao Xiu shook his head after scanning for a few times.

"Hopeless?" Liu Auntie's voice was dry and husky.

She saw Zhao Xiu's expression and was terrified.

"Not," Zhao Xiu directly contradicted, "I just understand. Why did Little Nuan encounter this kind of thing?"

Looking at the 18-year-old girl in front of him, who was once a good friend, Zhao Xiu was also moved.
Here is the translation of the text:

When he was young, he was taken to visit the girl's family several times due to academic reasons. He had always seen her from behind, with her back to the lamp light, diligently studying.

It wasn't until today that he had a clear glimpse of her face for the first time in many years.

"What is it?" his mother asked sharply, "Shall we find a quiet place?"

Liu, the aunt, also felt a pang in her heart, sensing that the issue might involve the girl's privacy.

"Mom," Zhao Xiu said lightly, waving his hand to decline.

"You guys want to settle this matter publicly, rather than in a private room, which means you must know that she can't be left alone in a private room."

As he spoke, Zhao Xiu stood up, "Although you want to choose a crowded place to suppress the issue, this thinking is correct, even if it doesn't work in the end."

"And since we're here, why not settle this matter publicly and avoid spreading rumors privately, affecting the girl's reputation?"

Zhao's mother suddenly slapped the armrest of the chair, "Here, everyone is family, and no one will spread rumors outside."

As she spoke, her gaze swept over the group with a sharp, piercing look.

It is said that officials find it difficult to mediate family affairs, and there have been countless instances of emperors and their relatives being powerless in the face of family matters.

As for Zhao Xiu, he was always too busy to care about family affairs, naturally leaving it to his mother to handle.

At this moment, Zhao Xiu also swept his gaze over the group, and a flash of blue light flashed in his eyes, a result of the "secret visual" technique he had mastered over the years. The air around him seemed to thicken, as if the weight of his experiences and the fate of countless people hung in the balance.
Here is the translation of the text:

At this moment, standing silently among the crowd, a cousin of Zhao Xu's suddenly felt a deep sense of regret from the bottom of her heart:

When those in power tear off their benevolent mask, people will finally discover that behind it lies a terrifying beast!

As everyone was stunned by Zhao Xu's piercing gaze, he suddenly burst out laughing.

"Just so, we're all relatives here, and I'll tell you about the 'phenomenon' my niece 'Little Warmth' encountered."

"If you all have similar experiences in the future, remember to contact me or the high-ranking pastor first, and then explain these circumstances clearly. What I'm about to describe is not just a simple illness."

Zhao Xu's relatives, who were initially thrilled by his words, gradually became serious as they listened to the gravity of the situation.

"Little Xu, what's going on?" his aunt, who was usually fond of him, asked.

"Have you seen the movie 'Exorcism'?"

The mention of the movie sent a chill down the spines of those who were familiar with it.

The movie hinted at a religious ritual - exorcism.

It's hard to imagine that there are no wizards like King Arthur on earth, with so many gods and magic at their disposal.

As a result, the earth is filled with countless horror stories, haunted houses, and supernatural events.

And so, the world is a place where magic and power exist, making it difficult to imagine.

In an instant, the vast hall seemed to be swept by a cold wind, causing several people to shudder.

Even Liu Auntie, who heard this for the first time, was so shaken that she almost fell over if not for Zhao's mother catching her.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

In the film and television drama, those "victims" who were possessed by evil spirits ultimately ended up in a tragic state. She knew it all too well.

It was a kind of mental torture, where they would bang their heads against the wall, crying out loud, pleading for forgiveness, yet unable to break free from their own guilt.

It was as if they thought they had finally freed themselves, only to discover that the mirror showed a cursed smile.

"The darkness is as powerful as it is, and the sunlight after dawn will be even more intense."

Zhao Xu slightly unbuttoned the topmost button of his cloak.

He gazed at the "evil detection" device on the small, warm figure before him, which was emitting a circle of evil aura.

The evil air emanating from it was so intense that it could make even the most virtuous celestial beings vomit.

This was the highest level of eye-opening!
