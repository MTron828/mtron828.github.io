Chapter 380: Ruins Legend

As Vivian's extraordinary sword "Break Demon Slash" was unleashed, it immediately silenced everyone present.

For ordinary civilians without combat skills, being able to stab a professional warrior wearing armor with a single sword strike was already an incredible feat.

However, for other adventurers or players, killing a low-level adventurer with a single sword strike was not a difficult task.

The challenge lay in executing such an astonishing sword strike.

No one in the scene had confidence in their ability to withstand such a sword strike.

This directly affected Zhao Xu's subsequent journey, with fewer pests bothering him.

As they entered the desolate ruins, a thick fog slowly emerged from the surroundings, like thick gauze, isolating the area from the sunlight.

Even gazing up at the sky, it was difficult to see the scorching hot sun.

The terrain of the desolate ruins was not the usual sandy or stony path, nor a flat stone pavement. Although it had a hard, flat surface suitable for horse-drawn carriages, the top layer looked like a thin layer of fine sand-like desolate gray soil.

As many people walked on this desolate gray soil, the dust and dirt they stirred up further obscured everyone's field of vision.

Even without using fog-based magic, Zhao Xu's field of vision remained limited to no more than 10-15 meters ahead.

When night fell, the surroundings became even more shrouded in darkness, accompanied by occasional wild beast howls.

Even ordinary civilians would have to stop and set up a simple camp for the night.
Here is the translation of the text:

Although Vivian usually doesn't have the habit of setting up camp, she specially brought along the necessary items this time when she went out with Zhao Xu. Within a few moves, she quickly set up a tent.

At this moment, everyone was sitting around the bonfire, silently roasting marshmallows on the winter day.

In the midst of the night, Zhao Xu could only vaguely make out the glow of over ten bonfires in the distance, but anything beyond that was obscured by the thick fog caused by the ruins.

Zhao Xu and Vivian sat side by side at the entrance of the tent, leaning against the canopy to block the snowflakes drifting from above.

He relied on the flame of the bonfire to gaze at the book in his hand, while Vivian, who was sitting closely beside him, was washing her hair with water created by Zhao Xu's "Water Creation" spell.

As for the others, they were not as fortunate. After entering the ruins, they had no way to replenish their water supplies, so they had brought along precious drinking water.

Zhao Xu's water creation spell could produce 4 liters of water per cast, and the amount of water he created was even more than a bucket. There was no doubt that they had no water shortage issues.

This was also the reason why Vivian could calmly wash her hair. At this moment, most of the others looked like they had been rolling in the dust.

Some children were playing with the ashes, making a mess and getting scolded by their parents.

Just then, the other players who set up camp across from Zhao Xu and his friends began to tell ghost stories. They took some common ghost stories on Earth and reorganized them using the background of King Arthur, and combined them with the snow-covered landscape to make everyone shiver.

Zhao Xu had heard most of these stories before, but Vivian was particularly interested, even putting down her comb halfway through her hair, fully absorbed in listening.
Here is the translation of the text:

The people gathered together, looking at Vivian, who was exceptionally beautiful, and listened intently to their descriptions, their interest growing more intense.

At this point, the leader of this merchant caravan, High Lord Mr. Gao, who was not young, cleared his throat and began to speak in a slow and deliberate tone: "Do you know how this desolate wasteland was formed?"

This question, which concerned their own real interests, immediately sparked their interest. Several guards who were eating dry rations and bread were paying close attention to him.

In the entertainment-starved land of Arthus, a group of people sat together, swapping lies, which was actually the most common way to pass the time.

Even more, a rough-hewn jug of fermented millet wine was placed in front of them, followed by a martial arts expert who created a lively atmosphere, making it seem like a bar on Earth.

Zhao Xun had indeed verified the "knowledge and skills" beforehand, and even in his past life, he had heard people talk about this legend.

"I'm telling you all," High Lord Mr. Gao quietly opened his aluminum flask of wine, took a sip, and said, "This is the site of a great war's aftermath."

"Cut it out," the surrounding crowd suddenly responded with a tone of disdain.

Including Zhao Xun, everyone's curiosity fell sharply.

In his past life, he knew this rumor, and he had even touched it up close.

"Hmph," High Lord Mr. Gao noticed the crowd's disgruntled expressions and immediately emphasized: "What I'm saying won't be that simple."

"This wasteland was formed because it involves the gods," High Lord Mr. Gao whispered.

At this point, the people in the audience all looked thoughtful.
Here is the translation of the text:

"It was said that an immortal being had once blocked a blow from an ancient god. However, the force of that blow was too immense, and although it was repelled, the energy still seeped into the land beneath our feet.

Eventually, this land lost its original brilliance, and everything died, as if all life force was drained away.

The butler recounted a story he had heard at the dinner table, speaking each word carefully. As he did so, everyone's hearts began to wonder.

The mere overflow of energy caused the land, which stretched for an extremely long distance, to suddenly vanish into thin air.

Just how terrifying was that blow, and if it had been aimed directly at the city, wouldn't the entire city have been destroyed?

Vivian's eyes sparkled with curiosity as she whispered to Zhao Xu, "It's as if negative energy overflowed and consumed life force. But strangely, we can't feel it now."

Zhao Xu nodded slightly upon hearing this.

It's not unusual for all life force to be drained in an instant. The question is, how long has this land been drained of life force? That's a bit unusual.

Normally, such a situation would involve a nearby negative energy core or the like. However, Zhao Xu's group had not been affected by negative energy at all.

"Hey, you can't explain why there's this unbearable fog," someone said suddenly, without being intimidated by Zhao Xu's words. Although he didn't raise the question Zhao Xu had in mind, he touched on another direction.

What is this persistent fog that has lasted for years?

At this moment, the butler let out a hearty laugh, "I don't know that, but I do know that from the time I can remember, West Luo and North Alliance have organized over ten expedition teams to explore the source of this desolate wasteland."
Here is the translation of the text:

The desolate wasteland and the mysterious mist gave the Northern Alliance a perfect barrier in the eastern direction, but it also limited its expansion in an intangible way.

"'Ah, yes, I remember now,' said the caretaker. 'It's said that the mist in this desolate wasteland is actually sentient.'"

At this point, a young wanderer deliberately raised his voice, drawing the attention of everyone in the room.

He directly stated that he had secretly observed the desolate wasteland on one occasion and that it was indeed true that the wasteland was inhabited by two major forces, but every year, they would secretly hold a mysterious ritual.

The ritual had to be conducted secretly because the Righteous Church forbade human sacrifice.

"'Oh no, you're saying this, and I'm getting goosebumps!' someone exclaimed. 'We're setting out on this journey, and we didn't prepare any offerings for this desolate wasteland.'"

Everyone in the room laughed awkwardly, and those who made a living by traveling this route were busy recalling whether this event had really occurred.

As they thought about it, everyone's gaze fell on the caretaker's expression, and the Ai Lasi family's pharmaceutical industry, which had some connection with the Northern Alliance.

Therefore, they must have walked this route before.

At this point, the caretaker also turned white-faced, saying, "Before we entered this area, we buried a freshly killed animal in a special location according to local custom, seeking peace of mind."

It seemed as though everyone felt a sense of unease. The caretaker quickly explained, "However, this is our long-standing custom, and we do it quietly and secretly. So, it's possible that you followed the merchant caravan and didn't notice anything unusual."

Everyone understood the caretaker's intention.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

The road was in disarray, and they had suddenly conducted a ritual, leaving others who had not participated wondering what to make of it. Without prior preparation, everyone was carrying dry rations, and what about the live birds? However, Zhao X큰's face was pale and hard-set.

"Association head?" Vivi An sensed something and leaned in close to Zhao X큰, her hand brushing against the hilt of the sacred avenger's sword behind her back.

"What's wrong?" Zhao X큰 responded to Vivi An's concerned inquiry, his face stern.

"It's okay not to give in sometimes," he said.

"But it's not enough, that's the real problem," Vivi An countered.

"Under the eaves, there are no complete eggs," Zhao X큰 said, gazing out at the dark landscape where tents were stacked like small mountains.

"Hey, you're tired, go back and sleep," a woman on the opposite side of the campfire called out, patting a companion's shoulder. The woman had been slumped over since the beginning, as if sleeping.

But the poet didn't wake up with a start, but instead just fell down, his entire body collapsing into the campfire.

The flames spread to the poet's body in an instant.

But he didn't wake up again.
