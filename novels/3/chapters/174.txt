Chapter 175 Tacit Understanding
"It seems like you have a different idea." Wang Ningwei suddenly showed a calm smile.
After hearing this, Aisweixi also looked at Wang Ningwei in surprise.
At this moment, the two women looked at each other and instantly understood each other's intentions.
When smart people and ordinary people get along, they can cooperate well.
But when two extremely intelligent people are together, if there is a slight deviation in their thoughts and positioning of each other, it will lead to completely different results, so sometimes the efficiency is not high.
Wang Ningwei said, "Ying, can I go first?"
Seeing the other nod, Wang Ningwei, who usually doesn't like to be suspicious, spoke openly, "At the first moment, I also released the 'greasy technique', but my spell range was slightly behind, so when I saw the goblins falling in advance, I knew someone else had cast a spell."
"According to the list of spell masters, out of the 8 people who have learned the greasy technique, except for the first one who fell in the first wave of attacks, the other seven people, including you, I combined observation and the skill of 'spell identification' to determine that they did not cast this spell."
After hearing Wang Ningwei's explanation, Aisweixi also smiled lightly, "I saw you raise your hand to cast the 'greasy technique' in an instant, so naturally I didn't release the spell. At that time, I chose to continue observing the other 18 people besides you."
She knew that when Wang Ningwei released the "greasy technique", the outcome of the battle was already decided.
Those goblins can only rely on raids to seize the opportunity. Once they catch their breath, there is not much difference between 20 goblins and 2 goblins. "I screened it and confirmed that if the mentor really exists, then he should not be able to infiltrate easily, especially those more reclusive players who are my main focus." "After excluding everyone in the back row of the team, I naturally started paying attention to the empty space behind. When the originally intact dry leaves we passed suddenly got crushed, I knew there was an invisible person approaching." Wang Ningwei had already understood the other's thinking from Eisweich's response. "If you speculate that the other party is Zhongxia from the situation where he can only use 'invisibility', then covering him with grease is too risky. What if he is really exposed?" Both women were not stupid. If the person was really Zhongxia, and he hadn't revealed to them in the QQ group that he was responsible for following them this time, it meant Zhongxia definitely had something to hide. "Don't be nervous, Xiao Weiwei," Eisweich joked, "It could be some thief with invisibility abilities, so I have to consider all possibilities. If that person is Zhongxia, he definitely has a way to successfully escape from that situation." Eisweich said this with even more confidence than Zhao Xu. "And after this test, no one in the team will suspect that Floating City has sent personnel to track us. So by knowing that the other party exists, it is only limited to the two of us, isn't it also helping him?" Wang Ningwei looked at Eisweich with a playful expression, "Shadow, I think you seem to have more confidence than him."
Here is the translation of the text:

"Eh, if that's the situation, he still can't figure it out, then he's asking for it, completely a pig teammate," Eschwisch said calmly, seemingly not worried at all about Zhao Xu's mistakes.

"He can just cast the second-level spell 'Quick Flight' with a simple incantation. With the spell's inherent stealthiness, he can become invisible," Eschwisch added.

"And besides, I deliberately chanted the incantation for 'Grease Spell' loudly, and the wind blowing nearby was quite strong, so he can definitely cast the spell without anyone noticing. Naturally, he won't leave any trace on the oil, and I can also successfully dispel the suspicion in everyone's minds."

Eschwisch spoke confidently.

The second-level spell "Quick Flight" is a weakened version of the third-level spell "Flight". It mainly emphasizes the ability to cast the spell instantly, without needing to chant a long incantation or perform a spellcasting pose like in the flight spell.

Additionally, the spell's mana cost is lower by one level, making it possible for a 3rd-level mage to cast it. The only issue is that it can only sustain flight for 6 seconds.

This is also why Eschwisch is certain that if that person is Zhao Xu, he can definitely escape silently.

Among all the low-level mages in Mistral, Zhao Xu is the only one who can freely cast various obscure spells.

Like the spell being cast today, it's not that people don't want to cast "Grease Spell", but rather they don't know how or have limited spell slots. Even if they have prepared the scroll, they need to take time to retrieve it from their backpack or scroll case and then spread it out to cast the spell.

However, Eschwisch still expressed his own judgment privately.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Indeed, in an emergency situation, no one will think about the most optimal or cost-effective method, but rather start from relying on familiar paths. Perhaps he has obtained a new magical item, who knows?" Wang Qingwei analyzed. "Or maybe you didn't need to specifically create a 'magic alert' just now."

"That's what I did," Esve said, looking at Wang Qingwei. "My oil and grease technique is to distinguish between possible enemies and dispel everyone's suspicions."

"Me?"

At this moment, Wang Qingwei's face also lit up with a radiant smile. "I've already used that spell to inform Zhongxia, and Zhongxia also told me his answer."

"Our mutual probing has reached its end."

Zhao Xu gazed at the silver line shining brightly in the sunlight, smiling silently.

The initial feeling of being discovered had just emerged, but was quickly suppressed.

If he hadn't prepared to be discovered at the beginning, his plan would be too simplistic.

As Zhao Xu, who only mastered the two-ring technique, faced players who possessed one-ring techniques, his methods were still quite limited.

So Zhao Xu had prepared to be exposed by those two clever girls from the start.

Anthyronia had given him the task "to solve the strong robbery without revealing his identity," which determined whether a magical item belonged to him.

As long as he didn't reveal his identity in front of novice wizards, he wouldn't be considered to have revealed his identity.

Even Wang Qingwei's "magic alert" could only infer that someone had followed them after they left.

Unless Wang Qingwei cried out his name in person, this would be a long way from revealing Zhao Xu's identity.

Zhao Xu knew from the start that he couldn't actively reveal his identity, so he didn't tell anyone about it in the QQ group.

Some things deliberately take advantage of known loopholes, and completely lack any intention.
Here is the translation:

Especially, he clearly knew that he had revealed his QQ chat logs and the conversation with the two girls, and it was inevitable that everyone's behavior would be exposed.

Even if he had revealed this, he might not have been able to conceal it from Anzhiya.

Zhao Xu gazed at the silver thread, knowing that it was a message left by Wang Qingwei.

He couldn't openly tell him, but Wang Qingwei had guessed Zhao Xu's existence. She wanted to make them both feel a sense of tacit understanding.

This silver thread was too obvious in the sunlight, just like the materials needed for the "Magic Alert" spell. Wang Qingwei could have easily hidden it with the dry grass surrounding it.

After Zhao Xu used the "Trap Detection" spell to eliminate the possibility that the silver thread was used to cover up another trap, it meant that the thread was a clue left by Wang Qingwei.

It also meant that she had left an opening for Zhao Xu, responding to his probe and giving him a hint.

Zhao Xu couldn't help but smile wryly, although he was confident that he could escape the scene before the other party took action.

However, he only wanted to give the other party a subtle hint to make it easier for them to cooperate and control the behavior of the floating city wizards who were a bit reckless.

However, Zhao Xu didn't expect Wang Qingwei to take a direct approach, probing him back and even trying to tell him how to maintain the tacit understanding.

Zhao Xu bent down and observed the silver thread closely.

He gently touched it with his hand, and to his surprise, a knot formed on the thread.

Zhao Xu suddenly understood that Wang Qingwei was telling him how to verify his identity.

Zhao Xu quickly estimated the time.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

The warning range of the magical alarm is approximately 6 meters in diameter. If only the "sound alarm" option is chosen, a loud and piercing sound will be emitted, audible to everyone within a 20-meter radius after the alarm is triggered.

If the "mental alarm" option is chosen, the caster will receive the alarm prompt as long as they remain within a 1.5-kilometer range. However, if the caster lingers, they will no longer receive the prompt once they are more than 1.5 kilometers away from the location.

Next, Zhao Xu followed the silver thread's guidance, using the bell as a reference point, and moved to a range of 6 meters away, patrolling the perimeter of the warning line.

The magical alarm continued to be activated, and the mental signals also began to oscillate in the air, drifting towards Wang Qingwei's direction.
