Chapter 574: Giving Up on Beliefs, the Druid

In an instant, he created over 6.7 billion pieces of cloth, and then dispatched them to each of the Earth's travelers, with the goddess Sylvina herself being one of the most powerful deities, capable of achieving this feat.

In the eyes of all humanity, such power was equivalent to that of the Creator.

This was also a moment when the "Miracle Art" of the Nine Rings exceeded the scope of its own magical range, allowing divine power to intervene and create a brilliant force.

At this moment, Zhao Xu was in an unparalleled state.

In the instant just past, the goddess's immense power radiated from his body, converting countless magical energies into sparkling starlight, which then transformed into individual "clothing" pieces that floated down from the sky, gently settling into each person's hands.

As a result, the process of creation was accompanied by Zhao Xu's voice spreading out.

At this moment, the entire Wasteland was filled with the sounds of Zhao Xu's voice, which many people on Earth had never heard before. They also heard his seemingly humble yet timely request.

Those who had been drenched by the rain and were shivering with cold, whose clothes were soaked and unable to be dried immediately, and who lacked new clothes to replace them, felt the warmth of this "snow-in-the-ear" gift for the first time.

Not even the greediest of people dared to think of stealing at this moment, as all of these were divine gifts.

The priestess Mia, who was about to quietly disappear, was surprised that Zhao Xu had used up his three Miracle Arts in one go. Moreover, he had even made such a "request".
Here is the translation of the text:

She nodded slightly, seeming to understand and not understand at the same time, and let out a faint sigh. She glanced at a heap of grass and then retreated silently into the depths of the forest, gradually disappearing from view.

She already knew that the silver fire had found a suitable master.

Arthur's evil powers were about to manifest again.

"In that case."

After completing the spell, Zhao Xu also lifted his head silently, as if he was about to receive a gentle, non-existent drizzle.

Just now, the goddess had forcefully infused divine energy into his body, and in the instant he used his hand to cast the spell, Zhao Xu also unexpectedly discovered a secret about divine energy.

Unlike before, the fragments of the god of death had been lodged in him for nearly half a year, without giving him any feedback, but only allowing Lux to take advantage of him.

"Look, you've been playing this game for so long, it's time for you to come out."

Suddenly, Zhao Xu turned his head and looked at a lush grassy area.

It's undeniable that the spell in "pre-emption" and "anticipation" is top-notch, no matter who you meet.

However, if you really pay attention to the wind blowing through the grass and detect the hidden enemies, it's actually relying on the skills of "surveillance" and "listening".

Even Zhao Xu's five-ring mage's power can only rely on the "stacking" skill to achieve a roundabout effect.

The person hiding in the grass heap, however, was unable to escape Zhao Xu's "listening" and "surveillance", so he was caught by his gaze.

At this moment, a Druid dressed in leather armor and carrying a wooden shield stood up silently.

His entire body was trembling with an unbelievable expression, even his body was shaking slightly.

And in his hand, he was holding a piece of cloth wrapped in waterproof paper, which he received as a gift under Zhao Xu's divine magic.
Here is the translation of the text:

The druid's animal companion, a smooth-feathered hawk, remained still on his shoulder, not daring to move a muscle.

When he saw Zhao Xu, he slightly lifted the corners of his eyebrows.

The druid, who had always hidden in the forest, had been forced to leave his home after this time-traveling incident. However, despite being surrounded by negative energy that repelled him, he was still able to live comfortably.

For the druid and the rangers, the forest was not just a wilderness, but their own stronghold.

Therefore, this druid felt confident enough to venture out alone to explore.

It was also at this moment that he encountered Zhao Xu's blessing, as well as the scene of spreading blessings.

After this time-traveling incident, the druid, Kai, had finally understood the meaning of his profession. He had learned that he would one day inherit a trust fund left by a distant relative, which would provide him with a steady income every year, ensuring that he would never have to worry about food and clothing.

"Have you noticed?" Zhao Xu asked with a smile.

It was clear that the lady, Naiya, had noticed the druid, and even glanced in his direction as she walked away, which is why Zhao Xu turned around to listen carefully.

However, Naiya believed that her actions were transparent, so she had nothing to hide.

"No, Mr. Zhongxia," the druid, Kai, slowly said, his words striking fear into the hearts of countless people on Earth.

The name that accompanied this incident became a dream destination for countless people, with a large number of people rushing to this land every day, as if embarking on a journey.
Here is the translation:

After the initial shock, the druid player, Shi Kai, gradually regained his composure. However, the more he thought, the more thoughts flooded his mind, as if an invisible electric arc was burning his scalp. When he heard the response, Zhao Xu only smiled slightly and didn't say much. He quietly walked past the druid player and headed towards the target area. It wasn't until Zhao Xu had pulled ahead by three body lengths that the druid suddenly shouted, "Mr. Zhong, can I follow your footsteps?" As he spoke, he knelt in the direction of Zhao Xu. "Huh?" Zhao Xu slightly turned his body and looked at the druid, who was kneeling before him, with a curious gaze.

In reality, Zhao Xu had considered becoming a druid in his previous life. The characteristic of druids can be summarized in one word: "omnipotent". In the Holy Trinity of War and Thievery, druids are known for their all-around support. They can cast healing spells, although not as powerful as those of priests. However, when combined with the abilities of a paladin, their healing abilities are decent. Additionally, druids have a certain level of magical and shapeshifting abilities, making them capable of both dealing and withstanding damage. Even in the early stages of the game, they can provide some battle support with their animal companions.

Zhao Xu spoke in a strange tone, "From a logical perspective, as representatives of nature, druids obtain their power from the balance of nature, rather than kneeling before me here." Among druids, they address each other as brothers and sisters, regardless of their level, and consider each other as leaders or helpers, without significant class differences.
Here is the translation of the text:

"No, when I met you, Mr. Zhongxia, at this moment, I suddenly felt that I had taken the wrong path in the past. The natural way is not what I desired, and I don't care about the 5th-level druid skills."

Druidic Stone Kay's face turned pale for a moment.

As a druid who respects nature, he has his own boundaries. Just wearing metal armor would prevent him from casting druidic spells and using any supernatural or magical abilities until he removes the armor and waits for 24 hours.

At this moment, Druidic Stone Kay's entire strength has been exhausted by just a little bit.
He has already gone against his oath to nature.

Zhao Xu, on the other hand, narrowed his eyes slightly.

Although all Earthlings have only been here for two days, even a three-year-old child would know that the "player" identity of the past is an invisible noble among travelers.
As a 5th-level player, he is almost at the top level.

Although he may not be able to reach the top 7th or 8th levels, he is still strong enough to beat most ordinary players.

They are already in the gray area between the first and second teams.

"You're pushing it too far," Zhao Xu summarized. "Unless you have the 'Redemption Spell' of the 5th ring, your abilities will definitely not come back."

Even if the opponent's behavior is intentional, the priest who wants to mediate through spellcasting has to pay extra life energy to smooth over this subjective mistake.
This makes it even more difficult.

"No need," the druid player knelt down on the ground and bowed his head to Zhao Xu.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Sir, I have come to realize that relying solely on natural power is not enough to save this world. Yesterday, I saw my family members in the camp, each one looking emaciated and even showing signs of death. Although I have the Druid's magic of the three rings, which can save them, what about others? The countless gazes of those who are dependent on me make it impossible for me to bear the exhaustion of my spell slots, so I decided to leave the camp alone to search for answers."

"I believe in the natural way, but it cannot provide me with an answer."

"Countless myths tell us that it is not us Druids who can save the world."

"Just now, I was filled with doubt and even considered ending my life to escape everything. Before breaking my oath, I noticed that my abilities were declining."

"A Druid who doubts himself has already destroyed himself."

"However, I met you, sir."

"You are the answer to my question, Mr. Zhongxue."

At this point, Druid Shi Kai looked up at Zhongxue with a determined gaze.

When he heard the other party's passionate words, Zhongxue couldn't help but feel a slight hesitation.

Although he had just realized that the first step towards divinity was to abandon humanity, he still found it difficult to understand the madness of this Druid before him.

It was as if he was facing a young swordsman who had encountered a supreme master, who immediately gave up his skills without saying a word.

As a 5th-level player, he could guarantee his own prosperity and wealth, even without joining forces with Zhongxue.

Now, using his determination alone to prove his resolve was too extravagant.

"Will you regret it?" Zhongxue asked, squatting down.

"Even if I walk on the wrong path for 100 steps, it is still impossible to reach the other shore."
Here is the translation of the text:

When he heard this, Zhao Xu's face turned pale, and even he himself dared not speak boastfully. The "Druid" in front of him suddenly spoke out.

In an instant, Zhao Xu stretched out his hand, as if holding a sword, and smiled, saying, "In the next moment, I will release a negative energy beam from my hand. You should know the name of this spell - Absorption."

The Nine-Ring Spell of Absorption can temporarily absorb 2-8 (2D4) levels of the target creature. It instantly eliminates the effects.

It's not until 24 hours later that one can have the opportunity to roll for each lost level. If failed, it becomes permanent.

This is one of the few spells that can deal damage to players, like Zhao Xu's "Absorption" spell, which can absorb 16 levels at once, even if he himself is hit by a dragon.

Zhao Xu, who has mastered the Four-Ring Spell of Absorption, can absorb energy that will return later, only temporarily suppressing levels.

"Well, you don't want to become a Druid again, that's for sure. You'll have to start from scratch and make a fresh start. Otherwise, you're just a 5-level white-collar worker, to be frank, you might not even be able to defeat a 1-2 level warrior."

"If you want to find answers here, let's start from scratch."

As he spoke, Zhao Xu said in a low tone, "However, I can tell you in advance that if you want to rise to 5 levels again, it may take 10-20 years of struggle to achieve."

"I can give you half a minute's hesitation time."

"No need," the Druid, Shi Kai, refused abruptly, without even thinking.

"That's fine," Zhao Xu said, putting away his hand, as if trying to probe.

But just as he stood up, a "Absorption" spell suddenly enveloped the opponent!
Here is the translation of the text:

At this critical moment, Zhao Xū's figure flickered several times, as if he had experienced countless moments in time.

The green light dissipated, and the originally pale-faced DeRui Shi Ke, as if he had just recovered from a serious illness, was covered in sweat all over his body.

At the same time, his character panel returned to its original state as a level 1 civilian.

He had lost everything.

As a 5-level white panel, he could have redeemed himself and become a 5-level DeRui, or at least retain his 5-level life value and immunity, and those skill levels.

But in this moment, he was no different from the travelers from Earth who had never played the game, who were camped in the camp.

He was ruthlessly stripped of all his capital by Zhao Xū.

Zhao Xū then headed towards the distance, while the former DeRui, who was still kneeling on the ground, prostrated himself towards him.

No one could deceive a mage who could read memories.

In the instant just passed, Zhao Xū began to "rapidly burst" and combined it with the "mind-reading" spell, and everything was clear.

As Zhao Xū walked a few steps, he suddenly turned back and said, "If you want to become a mage who can change the world, then you should recite the incantation above and head to Yánán."

A golden coin that looked ordinary flew through the air in a perfect arc and fell into the mouth of the former DeRui.
