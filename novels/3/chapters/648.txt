Chapter 649: The Dead Magic Zone

Upon hearing Zhao Xu's words, Anzhi Noya unexpectedly didn't show any surprise on her face, but instead, her pale face began to regain its color.

"You seem to have a more obvious connection to the Abyss," she assessed.

"A connection?" Zhao Xu replied.

To be honest, Zhao Xu had never gone to the Abyss, and even his "chaotic" camp had only just started to shift towards it recently.

"Anyway, remember those mysterious incantations corresponding to each layer of the Abyss when I was last there. At that time, my face was pale, and I vomited several times. The teacher forced me to recite those incantations by heart."

As Anzhi Noya spoke, her tone grew increasingly solemn, "Those incantations can create miracles when necessary, and sometimes they can even help you survive."

"Miracles?" Zhao Xu couldn't help but lift his head, looking at Anzhi Noya in confusion, "Even you, Teacher?"

"Summer Solstice," Anzhi Noya said, her eyes narrowing at Zhao Xu, her tone filled with annoyance. "I notice that you're getting more and more scattered lately."

She took a step closer to Zhao Xu, their distance now just a few inches apart, "I can tell you that the endless Abyss, the Nine Layers of Hell, and the Outer Realm are three special outer layers, and they are among the most dangerous of the many layers."

"If you're thinking that you have the 'Iron Will' and won't fall into a desperate situation, I advise you to just stick to practicing in the material plane and wait until you reach legendary level before saying anything else."

Hearing these words from the other side, Zhao Xu, who had originally thought he had finally filled the last gap, also couldn't help but stand up straight, "Please, Teacher, guide me."
Here is the translation:

This sense of respect also made Anxinyue feel pleased and lift her head, as if she had gained immense satisfaction.

"First, do you realize where your Iron Heart's weakness lies?"

As for Zhao Xu, he was no longer the Wu Xiaoming from before. He had crossed over and was relying on the "Potential Point" to forcefully restore his magical abilities every day, and he hadn't slept more than three hours.

The moment he was prodded, he was taken aback and suddenly exclaimed, "As a magician who has mastered the dual arts of magic, I'm most afraid of being unable to cast spells in a corresponding region, and Iron Heart's power is specifically designed to counter the 'Anti-Magic Zone' situation."

"But there's another one - the 'Dead Magic Zone'. However, since the three generations of Magic Goddesses abandoned the magical network and had it feedback to the core of the plane, there isn't another place like that anymore."

In the era of the Second Magic Goddess, Arthur still existed, and these regions could be said to be each spellcaster's forbidden zone, which was also the last shred of dignity for the warriors.

As Zhao Xu spoke, his voice grew weaker, and Arthur no longer had a Dead Magic Zone, but this didn't mean that other planes didn't exist.

Therefore, even traveling from plane to plane was a perilous task for a powerful magician.

There was no magical area where Iron Heart's power could suppress everything, but it couldn't reverse reality and turn it into a normal magical zone.

Iron Heart's power was like a "gas mask" that allowed Zhao Xu to breathe normally in a toxic gas region, but if he actually entered a vacuum region, even the strongest gas mask would be useless.

Unless he had an oxygen tank.

At this moment, Anxinyue took out a mysterious device from her backpack.
As Anshinoya pulls the spherical object upwards, the device suddenly opens, revealing internal components, including a series of crystal lenses and various operating handles and levers.

"This thing is called a 'Spatial Hexagram'," it said. "It can help us analyze the specific characteristics of the spatial structure and assist us in making judgments."

"Try operating it and analyzing the main material spatial characteristics," he said.

As Anshinoya handed it over, Zhao Xu also placed it on the stone table of the high tower, observing the pattern above - the outer circle was a broken floral pattern, with one side being an arc-shaped triangular sawtooth, and the other side being a scale with different black and white alternating lengths, with empty spaces having over ten complex mysterious patterns.

The inner layer was a large triangle, with a circular shape inside, and the circle had a triangle inside. The lines on them all had some sawtooth patterns, and were also filled with different pattern symbols.

After conducting a spatial knowledge search and combining it with his own intelligence, Zhao Xu once again demonstrated the "identification technique" to double-check, and finally mastered the usage of this spatial hexagram and the characteristics that could be judged.

One: Gravity - whether normal, high gravity, low gravity, objective gravity, subjective gravity, or different gravity.

Two: Time - whether the flow is normal, fast, slow, or irregular, or without flow.

Three: Region - whether the spatial structure is infinite, finite, or independent.

Four: Morphology - whether the spatial structure's natural shape is changeable, and whether it is eternal, highly variable, magically variable, or self-changing.

Five: Elements - whether it is dominated by air, earth, fire, water, or positive and negative energies.

Six: Alliance - whether it is biased towards a specific alliance and whether it is warm or intense.
Here is the translation of the text:

Seven: Magic: Non-existence Magic (does not exist), Wild Magic (effects unpredictable), Hindrance Magic (makes it harder to cast), Amplification Magic (has an amplifying effect), or Limited Magic (only effective for certain schools, sub-schools, or levels of magic).

At the same time, the six-fold compass can also reveal the location and information of 20-meter range teleportation portals. Additionally, it can assist in judging the knowledge of the current plane.

Thinking about this, Zhao Xu couldn't help but shake his head. If he had had this thing when he was in the mysterious cave, he would have been much easier.

"This plane's six-fold compass is yours now," Anzhenyao said, looking at Zhao Xu after he had mastered the magic device.

Zhao Xu nodded slightly.

This valuable item, worth 54,000 gold coins, is crucial for searching information comprehensively and also makes him realize the seriousness of plane travel.

Even a five-ring "interdimensional teleportation" could reach the deepest level of the abyss, but Anzhenyao did not do so, instead choosing to prepare thoroughly.

Just judging the characteristics of the plane requires a magical item worth tens of thousands of gold coins.

"Have you understood the severity of the problem after seeing those different magic regions?" Anzhenyao asked.

Zhao Xu nodded sincerely.

The interdimensional world is far from what he thought it was.

In addition to the non-existence magic zone, there are also wild magic zones, hindrance magic zones, amplification magic zones, and limited magic zones, especially the latter ones in Aether.

"What do you remember about your initial goal?" Anzhenyao asked.

Zhao Xu replied, "To become the sharpest sword in Aether, where the sword's reach is boundless and cuts through everything."

"What do you need to do to achieve this?"
Here is the translation:

"Compensate for all my shortcomings."

Zhao Xu thought for a moment and said, "My second route as a master of the arcane arts is to master all aspects of the ancient tome."

"Learning magic comes at a great cost, so I entered the final scroll and mastered the spell."

"As a mage, I need to prepare a fixed set of spells, so I learned multiple talents and specialized in precognition."

"As a mage, my daily spellcasting slots are limited, so I mastered the unbridled hero's spirit and potential points, allowing for infinite endurance."

"As a mage, the duration of my spells is limited, so I learned spell delay and spell persistence skills."

"As a mage, my magical abilities are limited by the number of circles, so I advanced to master the art of circle manipulation."

"As a mage, the power of my spells is limited, so I learned extreme efficiency and twin-birth skills."

"As a mage, my spells require spell resistance and expensive materials, so I advanced to become a guardian of incantations."

"As a mage, I will be restricted by the demon realm, so I learned the Ironheart Flow and Ironheart Force."

"As for the remaining weaknesses, I'm referring to the shortcomings of a 'mage' such as myself, including the Wisdom Scholar, Cleric Domain, and subsequent compensatory actions of the Ruby Guard. All of these are weaknesses that I, Zhao Xu, need to compensate for."

"This is also the reason why, although I'm only level 10, my combat strength is comparable to that of a legendary hero. And if I get a suitable magical weapon, I can deal thousands of damage."

"So, have you finally understood?" An Ti Noya smiled mischievously.

Zhao Xu also smiled, "So, before going to the depths, I need to compensate for the weaknesses in the magical region, right?"

"What's the current equipment on your body? You're still missing a few slots," An Ti Noya asked.

"Just the wrist and outer armor slots," Zhao Xu replied.
Here is the translation of the text:

Among the magical items, the equipment slots are mainly divided into three types: shoulder slot, chest slot, and outer slot. The shoulder slot is specifically designed for capes and cloaks, and Zhao Xu's is the "Stellar Cape". The chest slot is designed for vests, formal wear, or blouses, and Zhao Xu's is the "Great Sage's Robe". The outer slot is designed for armor and robes.

However, due to the high failure rate of magical failures, Zhao Xu has never considered armor. He is currently wearing a standard robe with the emblem of Misterla, which is not particularly outstanding. Even the chest slot with the Great Sage's Robe is empty, with a high probability that Zhao Xu will not wear it.

As he grew up, the effects of the Great Sage's Robe on him became less noticeable. However, wearing it is a matter of identity, so Zhao Xu has not considered alternatives.

"So, I'll give this to you."
As Anzhiya said, she handed over a robe with her personal emblem prominently displayed.

"This robe is not a big problem to convert into a magical item, but the sewing itself was a bit of a headache. It also improved my sewing skills to the point where I'm almost on the verge of leveling up."

At this point, Zhao Xu took the robe and discovered that it felt like silk, with intricate details and impeccable craftsmanship. He glanced at Anzhiya's hands and noticed that there were no scars or needle marks.

To be honest, Anzhiya's sewing skills are estimated to be no more than level 3, but she can produce work that surpasses the 40th level. It's clear that the remaining 37 levels are due to her magical abilities.
Here is the translation of the text:

"This item of clothing is called the 'Unwavering Spellcasting Set'. Its style is diverse, depending on the creator's race and the characteristics of the dimension. I've seen various styles, from snow-white clothing with book-page decorations to earthy colors."

"As for its greatest effect, it allows you to ignore the dimensional magic properties and cast spells in areas such as the Wild Magic Zone, the Barrier Magic Zone, and the Limited Magic Zone. Of course, when you encounter a favorable amplification zone, you can use it to its fullest potential."

As Anisina spoke, she proudly lifted her head. "Thank you, Master."

Zhao Xu also cherished the cloak, stroking it gently while removing the star-patterned cloak and revealing the original crimson robe of the Great Sage. The new cloak immediately covered it.

Despite being a 25,000 gold coin item made with limited blessing or miraculous magic, it perfectly solved half of Zhao Xu's dimensional magic property issues.

After completing the outfit, Zhao Xu's aura also became more majestic by a few folds.

"Well done," Anisina nodded in satisfaction.

"So, we're left with the last question - the Death Magic Zone, which needs to be solved."

Hearing this, Zhao Xu's heartbeats quickened slightly.

After filling this gap, he had no constraints in spellcasting. With his hands grasping the spell, he grasped the truth of Arthur's reality, no longer a mere illusion for him.

"That's what you know the direction is?"

Anisina countered with a question.

Zhao Xu was taken aback, but replied directly: "I've heard of a method called the 'Entrusted One' specialization."
Here is the translation of the text:

"No mistake," Anzhi Noya agreed, "the specialization of a believer is only achievable when a believer has achieved the goal set by God through their efforts, and this specialization usually allows believers to acquire additional magical powers and abilities, such as increased stats and the ability to add certain spells to the priest's repertoire."

"So, this is also a way to expand one's capabilities," Anzhi Noya said with a hint of amusement.

"Because the specialization of a believer requires a deep connection with the divine, each person can only have one specialization," Anzhi Noya added.

As Anzhi Noya gazed at Zhao Xu's handsome and dashing face, he asked, "Do you know the specialization of the goddess Sylvina?"

Zhao Xu swallowed hard, his eyes fixed on Anzhi Noya's enticing gaze, and replied, "Yes, mastering this specialization means being accepted by the goddess and knowing the greatest secrets of the goddess's church."

"You can even succeed in casting spells in areas with forbidden magic or antimagic fields, as long as you pass the spellcasting test," he added.

However, Zhao Xu's brow furrowed immediately. "But it requires faith in the goddess beyond that, and also a 3rd-level priest level."

Zhao Xu's current magical path was only at the 1st level, and it was already extremely difficult to achieve the 2nd level, let alone the 3rd level.

"This is also the reason I didn't consider this specialization before," he thought to himself. Normally, one would only consider increasing their priest level after becoming a legendary figure.

"No, after the catastrophic era, the goddess's chosen ones do not require a 3rd-level priest level," Anzhi Noya said with a straight face.
