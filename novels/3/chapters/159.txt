Chapter 160: Legendary Mage

"Big brother?" Zhao Xu thought that the voice might be coming from the consciousness of the Mo Lin Stone.

However, this kind of tone was a bit unfamiliar to Zhao Xu.

He asked with a hint of confusion, "Speak normally?"

"Uh..."

"That's it, let me introduce myself. I'm the original consciousness carrier of the Mo Lin Stone, and your little brother, Qiqi."

"Qiqi?"

"Yes, big brother. Seeing you, I'm really moved."

"Hold on, don't we know each other?"

Zhao Xu was a bit perplexed.

"Oh, it's mainly because of the way you walked into the hall. The sensation of fear from the depths of the soul directly made me wake up. I was immediately impressed by your royal aura."

The voice from the void became even more subdued, as if it didn't dare to touch Zhao Xu's emotions.

Zhao Xu was also a bit surprised by the stone's attitude. At first, people thought he was being harsh to the stone.

However, Zhao Xu suddenly remembered An Niya's hint.

Even people who had passed the trial 70% of the time were messed around by this stone.

Couldn't it be that the mess started from the dog-like mode?

Zhao Xu began to scan his surroundings by moving his gaze.

Inside his field of vision, there was only dark and impenetrable darkness, like a dark night sky.

Zhao Xu's remaining vision was only provided by the light column falling from above.

"Big brother, I'm really sorry, I didn't consider your feelings at all."

The voice in the void seemed to carry deep remorse.

At this moment, the darkness around him was suddenly stripped away, revealing a lush green landscape. A small deer that had been squatting earlier looked at Zhao Xu in surprise and quickly ran away.
Zhao Xu sniffed the fragrance of the green grass in front of him, wondering if he had entered another illusion. "Brother, is this scenario satisfactory?" a voice from the void asked expectantly.

Zhao Xu was already a bit confused, feeling that the so-called "Seven Seven" stone monument was too humble, and it was hardly worth teasing. He thought for a moment and decided to be cautious and not take anything at face value.

No matter what the other side said, he would treat it with caution. Even if the sky fell and the earth shattered, he would not be afraid.

At the beginning, Anzhi Noya introduced him to the final chapter organization and said she would arrange his next profession. However, Zhao Xu was clear that just advancing to a normal mage profession had stopped countless people.

Many mages loved the idea of advancing to a higher level, but they often gave up due to their inability to understand the structure of magic. Those who were unable to advance to a higher level had to settle for other professions that could still perform magic.

For advanced professions, especially those that were extremely powerful, it was extremely difficult to advance. Even if you obtained the qualification and met the requirements for the advanced profession, you could still fail the advancement.

It was just like the time Zhao Xu spent three or four days stuck at the last step of the scriptural studies. At that time, he had not given up and had not seen the ancient cursed stone monument.

Advanced professions were similar. Even if you met the hard conditions, there were still hidden, invisible soft conditions. The stone monument in front of him had a history of success in advancing the majority of candidates who had passed through it.

It was enough to guarantee that Zhao Xu would completely obtain the content of the advanced profession and completely bypass various soft conditions.

"Can you tell me the specific trial? I propose an advanced profession name, and then you arrange the trial? Or do you arrange my specific advanced profession based on the trial results?"
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu asked with curiosity.

"Oh, esteemed older brother, usually I arrange progress according to the level of the trial-taker. If they're not satisfied, they can go back and find a new one."

"If someone wants to progress, I'll arrange it. That's what I am, or that's what I'll be."

Zhao Xu's heart sank upon hearing this. It meant that the stone monument would arrange some unsuitable progressions for him, such as the Scholar of the Book, the Knight of the Elemental Forces, and so on. He would be left with nothing.

At this moment, the existence in the void, the consciousness of the stone monument, noticed Zhao Xu's puzzled expression and hastily explained: "Oh, no, older brother, that's not it. It's not you."

"You, as my esteemed older brother, just tell me the name of the profession you want, and I'll transmit it to you. My younger brother doesn't have any special talent to bring back to the older brother, and can only use a few progression tables to show his intention."

"I'm thinking, older brother, you might be suitable for a profession like a Chemical Alchemist. This way, you can cast a spell with a difficulty level of seven or eight, and then kill anyone who dares to approach. Oh, no, the Chemical Alchemist is strong, but the style is too ugly, not suitable for your majestic and powerful image."

"Original Force Scholar? This profession is perfect for you, older brother, as you have the potential to intuitively manipulate the original force. Ah, I'm so stupid, older brother, you have the potential to be stronger than that, and this profession is too cumbersome."

"Rainbow Disciple? This profession can intuitively manipulate the rainbow-colored magical sphere at the seventh level. Just... I'll think about it again."

Note: The text is a conversation between Zhao Xu and the stone monument, discussing profession progression and potential. The conversation is quite hypothetical and fantastical, reflecting the fictional world in which it takes place.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Hey, are you saying that I should use the Overwhelming Curse? It has four Overwhelming Curse specializations at level 10, and it can also prolong the duration of my spells. However, I'm not sure if it's a good idea, as I need to progress and join a faction. My older brother is the kind of all-around mage."

Zhao Xu listened to the stone monument's constant chatter, and could only interrupt hastily: "Don't worry about it, let me try it out and then we'll figure out what to do next."

Zhao Xu's voice was not loud, but he believed that Seven Seven could hear him.

Suddenly, the originally quiet and peaceful sky was filled with an unbelievable voice: "Brother, you don't need to try it out. This is just something I do to pass the time."

Zhao Xu shook his head, thinking that if he had started by dismantling the stone monument, which was not born with magical abilities, then the opponent's zone would be over.

He had just sat down when the stone monument suddenly emitted a warm and intense aura, making him even more vigilant.

After all, he had seen the mysterious creature that possessed the stone monument, which could summon fire elements.

"You can arrange it for me," Zhao Xu said cautiously.

"Oh, I understand. You're indeed worthy of being my brother. It's true that I'll directly give you your profession, but after my subordinates outside find out the truth, they'll bother you," the ethereal existence spoke to itself.

The will of the Mo Lin stone monument recalled the scene where the young man who claimed to be the nephew of the Association's leader had begged him to cry.

At the time, he had directly used the "Transmutation of All Things" spell to turn the opponent into a woman and chased them away.

Who let that kid want to progress as a mage of unbalanced magic? He definitely needed to get close to create a progress with that female mage, and it would be easier to understand each other.

It was later that the Association didn't dare to send people for a month, so it was a bit boring.

"That's it, brother. The trial has arrived," the ethereal voice asked.

Zhao Xu suddenly stood up, took out his protective staff, and pointed it towards the front.
Here is the translation of the text:

As the will descended from the void, Zhao Xu waited for a long time before he saw the lake at the end of the green grass, where ducks were quacking and swimming towards him. The scene was serene and peaceful, like a mid-day picnic. "Is this a trial?" Zhao Xu couldn't help but ask.

"Ah? I'm just waiting for Big Brother to agree," the voice from the void complained.

"That's it then," Zhao Xu replied gruffly.

In an instant, a giant whirlpool appeared on the grass, and a person emerged from it. The person was wearing a purple-gold robe, and their gaze was cold and distant. A mysterious glow of numerous spells surrounded their body, as if it was about to overflow. This was a legendary mage!

Zhao Xu's eyes widened as he gazed at the emblem on the robe, representing the legendary mage. He felt a shiver run down his spine.

This was what level of enemy?

Even Zhao Xu didn't dare to strike first.

Even a high-level mage would be no match for the opponent, who had always had those counterattack spells on their person. Even a hint of hostility would be enough to kill anyone who tried to attack the mage.

Zhao Xu took a deep breath, planning to try to negotiate with words.

If the legendary mage could cast high-level spells, Zhao Xu would have to give up.

But just then, the legendary mage waved his hand.

A devastating black light burst forth from the mage's hand.

Separation Technique!

Zhao Xu recognized this six-level spell, which could dissolve anything and turn it into dust.

However, in Zhao Xu's astonished eyes, the black light of the Separation Technique suddenly fell back onto the legendary mage themselves.

The opponent instantly disappeared, dissolved into dust by the spell.

At this time, a solemn voice echoed through the sky: "Congratulations, Big Brother, on successfully killing the legendary mage."
"The current settlement reward for the big brother's trial."
