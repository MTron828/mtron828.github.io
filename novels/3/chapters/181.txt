Chapter 182: Divine Gift of the Ritual

As Zhao Xu suddenly saw the silhouettes of Andy and four others appear in front of him, he was taken aback for a moment.

Having once used this technique in the final scroll space, Zhao Xu was clear that this technique only allowed the caster to see specific historical events for themselves.

Just like when he used the "Detection Magic" spell, the specific aura could only be seen by the caster themselves.

However, the five people were now able to see this scene, which was undoubtedly due to Rey An simultaneously casting an illusion to show what he had seen.

As expected, the five people finally reached the creek bank and were about to step on the stone steps when, suddenly, the four young men all looked terrified and fell to the ground, unable to move.

As for the man called Andy, he had a fierce look on his face and went to each of his former companions one by one.

Among them was the slightly plump man who had once invited Zhao Xu to visit, who was a secretary of the Ministry of Affairs in Mistral, and he suddenly ran away in terror.

However, he didn't run far before suddenly freezing in place like a statue.

As if he had been bound by a spell.

Seeing this scene, Zhao Xu couldn't help but furrow his brow.

This effect was undoubtedly the ability released by the demon possessing Andy.

Generally, stronger monsters would have additional abilities such as special abilities, supernatural abilities, or spell-like abilities besides their inherent characteristics.

For example, the target of Zhao Xu's previous transformation, the Fiery God Servant, had both the spellcasting ability of a 19th-level priest and spell-like abilities.
Here is the translation of the text:

All these types of magical abilities correspond to the same-named spells, and are not exclusive to wizards. However, they are limited in frequency of use, such as being able to use them freely, once a day, or once a year.

For example, the 20th-level Deep Infernal Mage has the ability to cast the 9th-level spell "Wish" - but only once a year. The Deep Infernal Mage does not have the ability to teleport interdimensionally, so it can only simulate teleportation to the prime material plane using the "Wish" spell once a year.

This means that the true form of the entity can only return after a year, when the spell's ability is restored.

It also implies that the demon possessing Andy has a similar magical ability similar to "Immobility" spell.

The lowest level of "Immobility" spell is the 2nd-level paladin spell "Human Immobilization" or the 3rd-level wizard spell "Human Immobilization". As for higher-level spells, there are the 7th-level wizard spell "Group Human Immobilization" and the 9th-level wizard spell "Group Monster Immobilization".

After Andy completes a simple sacrifice ritual, he flees to the opposite side of the stream with his body covered in blood.

After displaying this scene, Rayan also obtains Andy's likeness information and uses the 8th-level wizard spell "Sense Location" again.

Rayan's expression remains heavy as he gazes at Zhao Xu.

After a while, Rayan raises an eyebrow and asks Zhao Xu, "Do you have any speculations?"

Zhao Xu falls into contemplation, "The demons with immobility-type magical abilities are most commonly seen among the 11th-level Sharp-tailed Demons and the 20th-level Deep Infernal Mages."
Here is the translation of the text:

"So, you're guessing which one it is?" Le'an continued to ask.

"Deep Dungeon Magician," Zhao Xu replied with a slight hesitation in his tone.

"Ah, congratulations, you're correct," Le'an said with a smile. "Based on the remaining evidence at the scene and our personnel's feedback from Mistral, it's clear that the opponent is indeed a 'Deep Dungeon Magician'."

"And what's more, it's a high-ranking 'Deep Dungeon Magician' who just killed those four people to cover up its tracks through a ritual," Le'an said.

As Le'an spoke, Zhao Xu's eyes grew wide with a mixture of shock and fear, gazing into the dark depths of the forest ahead. The trees swayed gently in the night wind, as if the very same 'Deep Dungeon Magician' was standing there, staring at them.

Zhao Xu's face turned grave as well.

A being with a special ritual can even resist the detection of its position by devils, and it's definitely not some unknown entity in the infernal realm.

This means the opponent is not just an 18HD being, but possibly an evolved life form or a professional with a strong record.

Even ordinary 'Deep Dungeon Magicians' can freely cast several types of magic abilities every day, including the powerful and deadly spell "Blasphemy" with a negative and killing effect.

This spell does not consider the target's physical condition, and its effect is solely determined by the difference in life force between the caster and the target.

For example, Zhao Xu has only three life force points (3HD), which is a huge disparity compared to the opponent's at least 18HD.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

The effects of the divine language spell within the law of magic, with a difference of zero HD, is to fall into a state of dizziness, like Zhao Xu's swift and fierce release of magical energy. However, if the difference exceeds 10 HD, it is an instant kill, even without the basic exemption of instant death spells.

So Zhao Xu, at that time, would have been killed instantly if he had rashly approached the opponent, assuming the opponent had no further intentions to deceive. "They've finished collecting information, let's go take a look," Rui An suggested.

Zhao Xu nodded, but he didn't take a step forward, as this wasn't a crime scene investigation. Even before Rui An and others arrived, Zhao Xu didn't take a step forward to avoid being cursed or destroying the scene.

At this moment, Zhao Xu finally got a close-up view of Andy, possessed by an evil spirit, drawing a simple ritual array on the ground using the blood of four innocent victims.

Just then, a middle-aged mage, who had been collecting information here, approached and was about to brief Rui An on their analysis results.

However, Rui An lightly waved his hand to stop the other from speaking.

"This is a counter-prophecy ritual?"

Although Zhao Xu didn't recognize the effect of this ritual itself, he had already transcended his previous self, Wu Xiaoming, and had some concept of the symbols used in rituals.

For example, summoning rituals often used symbols related to planes, teleportation, coordinates, and energy transmission.

The ritual in front of him used a lot of symbols related to detection, orientation, and positioning. However, this did not mean it was a prophecy ritual.

On the contrary, the layout of the ritual was in the shape of an inverted star palace, typical of counter-prophecy rituals.

"No mistake," Rui An verified Zhao Xu's judgment.
Here is the translation of the text:

The mage who was about to report was taken aback by Zhao Xu's appearance. At first, Zhao Xu's cloak with a shimmering aura and a trail of starry lines had caught his attention. Later, when he saw the large bishop's emblem on the other side, he didn't ask any more questions. However, now it seemed that the other party was also researching rituals at this age, which was unusual. According to reason, the mages of Mistral, who were not familiar with rituals. Only some senior mages who specialized in researching rituals would have some knowledge in this area. Based on the courteous treatment of the team leader, Lian An, by the other party, the mage guessed that Zhao Xu was an expert in rituals. At this time, Zhao Xu was deeply engrossed in thought, staring at the ground ritual array. Then he took out his ritual notebook again and, through self-control, reproduced a simple sketch of the ritual array on the notebook. This shocked the mage who had recognized the other party's actions. Generally, scenes involving demons and evil killings were strictly sealed to prevent the leakage of demonic and evil powers, causing panic. He had never seen anyone do this before, and he was taken aback. At this moment, Lian An had noticed the change in his subordinate's expression and opened his mouth to explain: "He is one of our future team members, so this information is shared with him." However, Zhao Xu was already lost in thought. He took out a book from the legendary library, titled "A Brief Overview of Various Rituals", and flipped to a page, clearly having read it before.
Here is the translation of the text:

Before, Zhao Xu had stayed up late reading this book and then, based on the book's recommendations, he went to read "The Ritual of Transmission: The Journey of Hrosa Ga". In that legendary library, he had always stayed up late, reading various rituals, and symbols were flying around in his mind like a mess.

This time, he had come to protect the twenty wizards, and for Zhao Xu, it was almost like a journey of relaxation.

Suddenly, Zhao Xu's gaze fell directly on a critical node of the ritual, and the notes on his wand began to expand slowly.

Zhao Xu knew that the ritual was not complete.

In fact, the ritual did not need to be complete.

It was just that the "Deep Furnace of Demon Refining" had the ability to make an incomplete ritual work, relying on its own spirituality to fill in the gaps.

Zhao Xu began to reconstruct the missing key link in his mind, just like trying to imagine the original shape of a vase from half a dozen broken pieces.

As he thought, Zhao Xu's eyes fell on the wrapped body bag that had been wrapped up.

Suddenly, his heart shook, and some indescribable thoughts emerged from his entire body.

"That 'Deep Furnace of Demon Refining' must certainly be centered here, avoiding the surroundings. This killing site is the center of the ritual."

Zhao Xu declared on the spot.

At this time, Lei An also revealed an incomprehensible expression, looking at him.

This kid, couldn't he have read similar cases before and pretend to be knowledgeable here?

However, Lei An immediately rejected his own speculation.

Those files were still stored in the Rose Cross's library.
At this moment, Lei'an couldn't help but gaze straight at Zhao Xu.
