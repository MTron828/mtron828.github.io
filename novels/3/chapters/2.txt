Chapter 3: Racial Camp

Zhou Xun, who had only seen the divine, knew that the gods were truly real. Even when facing these godly statues in the game, he did not dare to be careless.

He quickly composed himself and looked at the guidance interface in front of him.

After players complete the guidance interface operation, they can ascend the stairs and enter the Arthurian world.

After death, players will remain in this creation hall before using the revival stone.

Not wanting to waste time, Zhou Xun directly used brain control to input his username, "Zhong Xia", which was the same as his past life.

After inputting his name, the panel suddenly displayed a series of racial options. Seven major races floated in front of him, each corresponding to different professions, abilities, and attributes.

"Humans," Zhou Xun said decisively.

To be honest, humans are one of the strongest races in Arthur's world. Humans have unique innate abilities and skill points, which many people underestimate at the beginning.

Therefore, he did not intend to switch to another race, even if the elves have a lifespan of several hundred years. As long as his plan goes smoothly, he will not lack any means of extending his life.

Some people who have crossed over to become game characters have gone crazy, especially the pygmy groups.

Gender was locked by the system as male, which also prevented the transformation accident after crossing over.

Body type was set to the average height of humans.

He didn't make too many changes to his eyes, skin tone, and hair color, only making some minor adjustments to remove some small defects, as the system does not allow for drastic changes.

Until the final camp test.

Arthur's camp line is horizontal for order, neutrality, and chaos; vertically, it is good, neutral, and evil. The horizontal and vertical combinations form nine major camps, and players can choose their initial camp or take a test to determine it.

Zhao Xu directly selected the absolute neutral camp.

In fact, he was actually part of the neutral good camp, but he chose the camp with the least restrictions, allowing him to adjust his alignment according to the events that unfold.

He temporarily set his faith to the camp's faith.

The game does not require a strong commitment, and even priests allow players to take the camp as their faith. Many people determine their faith after experiencing a segment of the game.

After selecting his options, Zhao Xu's data panel finally appeared:

Name: Zhong Xia

Species: Human/Otherworldly being (Earth)

Age: 22

Gender: Male

Body type: Average

Weight: 76 kilograms

Height: 183 centimeters

Identity: None

Language: Undetermined

Racial features: 1st level has an additional 4 skill points, and each level upgrade has an additional 1 skill point; 1st level automatically gains an extra feat.

After confirming the panel information, Zhao Xu let out a sigh of relief.

Many people had already completed their attribute profession selection and entered the game by this point.

However, after Zhao Xu's future Earth was destroyed, he saw how revered high-level players were in the Arthurian world, and how some top-class mages could turn the tide of a war single-handedly.

He knew that in the Arthurian world, a character's strength or weakness determined everything.

No matter how much time he spent, he would eventually be delayed by the basic job training that followed. This could take anywhere from a few hours to a week or more, just like the speed of the top-ranked players in each profession.

As the data on his panel disappeared slowly, a sacred, ethereal melody echoed through the hall. Six columns of attribute pillars, each representing strength, agility, vitality, intelligence, perception, and charm, stood before him.

Zhao Xu's inner tension reached an unprecedented level at this moment.

After crossing into the Arthurian world, everyone's physical quality in the Arthurian world was completely determined by these attributes.

Intelligence attributes had a real impact on IQ levels. A half-orc player once started with 8 intelligence, but after the penalty for his species, he was left with only 6 points of intelligence.

Before crossing, he could naturally control his character with his average 10-point intelligence. However, after crossing, he directly became a 6-point intelligence and was not much different from someone with low intelligence.

Many players pushed their attributes to the limit here, but Zhao Xu dared not.

Maximizing the benefits of attributes was his unbeatable advantage compared to other players.

The six attributes before him were all initially set to 8 points, and the height of the attribute pillar was also fixed at 8 levels high.

His test account had 28 points assigned to himâ€”

For attributes in the range of 8-14, 1 point was assigned to gain 1 attribute value.

For attributes in the range of 15-16, 2 points were assigned to gain 1 attribute value.

For attributes in the range of 17-18, 3 points were assigned to gain 1 attribute value.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The 18 attributes are also the initial attribute cap. To upgrade attributes, one must rely on leveling up or equipping better gear. Zhao Xu, in his previous life, had only managed to get a +2 strength belt, and leveling up was only possible every four levels. Zhao Xu gazed at the 28 attribute points displayed in front of him, with an additional +4 shown behind it. This meant he had a total of 32 attribute points, which was a reward for being one of the first players to log in within 24 hours of the game's launch. This was also the only opportunity for 32 attribute points to appear in the game. In his previous life, Zhao Xu had started with 22 attribute points, 10 less than the average player who had logged in 10 days earlier. However, he was still considered lucky, as most people on Earth had not even created an account for the game. Reborn after 10 years, Zhao Xu became the biggest cheater in Arthur's game."
