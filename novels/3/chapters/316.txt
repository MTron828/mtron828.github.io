Chapter 317: Concert

However, Zhao Xu still underestimated the waves caused by this unexpected downtime, or to say, many silent players who had been lurking in the shadows were suddenly awakened.

At that moment, the forum's traffic reached its peak, with countless people sharing their opinions and conspiracy theories spreading like wildfire across the forum.

Meanwhile, this unexpected event began to spread like wildfire in non-game QQ groups and eventually spread to other platforms.

Especially during idle hours, players started creating their own DIY content, sharing their gaming experiences and anecdotes. As a result, screenshots of hilarious and bizarre experiences were widely circulated.

Zhao Xu's post, on the other hand, quickly went viral due to the massive amount of forum coins he had offered as a reward, as well as the reputation of his "Dong Cheng Yin" account. His post quickly skyrocketed to an all-time high.

Even professional experts began to participate in the discussion, but the topic was still accumulating content over a period of two to three days.

On the day of the game's scheduled downtime on Friday, Zhao Xu had a hard time attending classes and even took notes for his final exams.

After a few days, he would have to take a break to go back home for the winter vacation.

As the afternoon approached, Zhao Xu directly walked to the subway station near the school gate without changing trains, arriving at his destination.

He then spent about 10 minutes walking to the sports center, which was the venue for the concert.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

After the concert began, the entire process was like a replay of Zhao Xiu's memories from his past life. Even the two twin stars on stage sang the wrong lyrics, causing the audience to burst into laughter. Zhao Xiu was listening to the song and his thoughts drifted back to his past life, as if he had seen the flow of time.

When Zhao Xiu had his first personal music player, CD machine, he listened to the other person's album. Later, it changed to an MP3 player and then an iPod Shuffle. The other person's songs were always stored on Zhao Xiu's music player, and he could only listen to them without looking at the lyrics. He could sing along from start to finish.

However, during the concert, Zhao Xiu tried to look around, searching for a familiar figure, but to no avail.

Although the other person was not tall, he still underestimated the enthusiasm of the VIP zone fans. Everyone was standing and singing along, waving glow sticks and holding up light sticks, making it impossible to see clearly. When Zhao Xiu sat in the mountain zone, he could still see the appearance of the people around him, but in the VIP zone, he could only recognize the appearance of a few people nearby.

Until the middle and late stages of the concert, Zhao Xiu took a break in the interval to change his clothes and directly went to the restroom.

In his past life, Zhao Xiu knew the pace of the performance and didn't rush to find a portable toilet nearby. Instead, he went to the staff restrooms in the sports center.

Less than a few minutes later, he came out and walked to the sink area, where he found a woman wearing a blue princess dress, with her shoulder-length hair and exquisite features.
Here is the translation of the text:

At this moment, the woman in front of Zhao Xu was busy making up in front of the sink, looking radiant and carefree, as if she didn't care about the distractions around her. Zhao Xu couldn't help but smile at the scene.

In his previous life, Zheng Xin'an had met Zhao Xu through an introduction by his parents and had already been familiar with the upper echelons of society. However, after becoming an apprentice pastor, he had also distanced himself from the common people.

When Zhao Xu and Zheng Xin'an first met, they didn't feel a significant class gap. It wasn't until later, when they spent more time together, that Zheng Xin'an occasionally revealed his upbringing and habits.

However, when they suddenly met again, Zhao Xu couldn't help but acknowledge that there were certain qualities that could be felt just by being near someone. After a while, Zheng Xin'an slightly turned his head, looked at Zhao Xu with a puzzled expression, and asked, "Are you also here for the concert?"

Zhao Xu suddenly became calm, returned his gaze, and felt the water flow from the faucet in front of him. Originally, Zheng Xin'an had been surprised by the stranger, but he now saw Zhao Xu's chest sticker for the concert and suddenly understood that the handsome man in front of him was also a fan. He nodded and said, "Yeah?"

Zhao Xu awkwardly laughed and said, "I've been a fan for 10 years." "Me too," Zheng Xin'an said, feeling a strange warmth from the stranger and responding without hesitation.

"So coincidental?" Zhao Xu joked.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zheng Xin Yuan smiled slightly and pulled out a handkerchief from her backpack to wipe her hands, preparing to end the topic and leave. "But I like their song 'die without changing' the most," Zhao Xu also shook the water droplets from his hands naturally, preparing to leave.

However, Zheng Xin Yuan's eyebrows twitched slightly when she heard Zhao Xu's words, but she didn't say anything.

This song was her favorite among the group's songs. Sometimes, songs that intentionally create a sensation are difficult to succeed, while songs that are carefree and effortless can be extremely popular.

Zhao Xu was a benevolent person who didn't have a favorite song or prefer to make choices. However, he knew that Zheng Xin Yuan liked this song the most.

Because he had sung this song with her many times at night.

"Then what's your second favorite?" Zheng Xin Yuan couldn't help but gently brush her hair and ask softly.

"Red eyes," Zhao Xu's voice seemed to have magical power.

"What verse?" Zheng Xin Yuan asked.

"I was initially red-faced, now my eyes are red, and even as a child, I still feel that love is like a dream," Zhao Xu hummed the lyrics directly.

Even Zheng Xin Yuan didn't realize that she was walking side by side with Zhao Xu.

They walked all the way to the VIP area and Zhao Xu's entire demeanor was very calm. His exchange with Zheng Xin Yuan was a simple question-and-answer process, and even the sentences themselves didn't show the slightest excitement.

As calm as running water, as quiet as the passing of time.

But Zheng Xin Yuan didn't know why, especially since she knew that there were online tutorials specifically aimed at catching and teasing girls like her, who were often ridiculed by their girlfriends.
Here is the translation of the text:

While attending an international school, she had limited contact with boys and no experience in love. Therefore, she was wary of being manipulated by someone who might use PUA tactics. However, her conversation with this stranger was completely different, as it was just a question-and-answer session. She began to suspect that the person standing opposite her might be her own alter ego, as they shared many similarities. Coincidentally, the autobiography she bought in the first chapter and the song she listened to were identical. She joked, "You're saying all these hobbies are the same as mine? Unless there's something I've known since childhood, I'd think you're one of my friends playing a prank on me." Zheng Xin'an smiled and said, "Regardless of your motives, from now on, we're strangers, and it's useless." "Do you believe in reading minds?" "No," Zheng Xin'an said with a smug expression, as if teasing a child. "Then tell me, which song will they sing next?" Zheng Xin'an pretended to ask, already knowing the general playlist for the day. "Thanks for the breakup." Zhao Xu said. Zheng Xin'an smiled slightly, knowing it wasn't that song and also didn't intend to expose it. "Do you play games?" Zhao Xu had already walked to the VIP area. The two twin brothers had changed into new clothes and were about to perform the next song. "Yes?" Zheng Xin'an raised an eyebrow slightly, thinking to herself that the other person might finally start manipulating her. She thought for a moment and then said, "Yes, for example, the popular game 'Arthur' lately."
Here is the translation of the text:

Zheng Xin Yu's girlfriend has been playing this game, but she hasn't. Therefore, Zhao Xu's subsequent arguments based on the conclusion that she has been playing the game will be misleading.

However, she didn't realize it.

Zhao Xu, who had been with Zheng Xin Yu before, had completely guessed that she would say this sentence.

As he handed Zheng Xin Yu a piece of paper, he said, "Send you, don't just play with words."

Zheng Xin Yu was about to refute him when she discovered that Zhao Xu had already disappeared into the crowd and couldn't be found.

Zheng Xin Yu couldn't help but stick out her tongue and say, "Hey, we have a connection that's not visible."

She then looked at the piece of paper in her hand, which had a long activation code for the game. She had helped her friend buy it before and knew it was in the format of an Arthurian activation code.

Below the activation code was a small line of text: "Mr. Stra, Priest of the Camp."

As well as a mysterious incantation that she didn't recognize.

Zheng Xin Yu didn't think much about it and was about to throw it away.

At that moment, the sound effects on the side suddenly played a song, "The Return of the Scene, the Earth is Wintering" - which was the song that Zhao Xu had guessed.

The two twins on stage suddenly changed their song to this one due to a loud call from an audience member. This coincidence made Zheng Xin Yu take back her hand that was about to throw away the paper, and instead took out her phone to take a picture of the mysterious incantation. The translation software immediately translated it for her - a common language in the Arthurian game.

"It's a prayer to the gods in the game?"

Zheng Xin Yu couldn't help but sigh.

But she followed the Romanized pronunciation and silently recited the incantation.

After finishing, Zheng Xin Yu gazed vaguely in the direction where Zhao Xu had disappeared.
Zhao Xu, who had already entered the field, suddenly stiffened as if he had been electrified. However, he did not turn his head back, but instead continued walking forward.
