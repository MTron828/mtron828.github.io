Chapter 323: An Eye for an Eye

The administrative academy did not build a castle-like structure, but instead constructed a cluster of low-rise buildings and formed a cohesive whole. There was no floating city with alchemical elevators. The high-rise buildings were mainly built with standardized brick and stone, revealing the passage of time.

As the female secretary stopped about 10 meters away from the class, she gestured to let Zhao Xu proceed on his own. Seeing the opponent's nervous expression, Zhao Xu was about to burst out laughing, likely due to his own experience with misfortune, which had left a shadow in his mind.

This also made him look forward to the upcoming journey with anticipation and excitement.

The female secretary had already explained to Zhao Xu that the administrative academy would hold a comprehensive exam a week later. Therefore, all students would be required to gather daily, with teachers rotating to answer questions.

Today's schedule was for Zhao Xu, the "class leader," to give a new lecture and answer questions.

Compared to other students in other classes, even if their parents were high-ranking officials in the Mistralla government, students at the administrative academy had to keep their heads down and work hard to take exams. Otherwise, if their grades were too low, they would ultimately fail the evaluation and lose their chance to become government officials.

For many people, studying at the administrative academy was a fierce struggle for their future.

However, for the "Law 2nd Generation" students in Class 7, this was all just a joke. Even if the academy's president added his courage, he would not dare to evaluate them poorly. In fact, they could even bypass the school and enter the Mistralla government system through connections.
Here is the translation of the text:

When the wizard can live forever, the hierarchical barriers of Mistral's class system are already predetermined, far exceeding the imagination of many people.

However, as someone who has already enjoyed the benefits, Zhao Xu will not be surprised or delighted by this. He walked along the long corridor and found that several classrooms were empty, obviously because he was going to the 7th grade, which had been specially separated.

For some people, the 10-meter distance is too long and takes a lifetime to walk, but Zhao Xu took about 6 seconds, or a round of time, to cross it.

When he reached the slightly ajar wooden door, although the gap was small, Zhao Xu, who had a sense of touch beyond the average person, noticed that a wooden tub was placed on top of the door.

Zhao Xu immediately understood the situation.

As long as the new teacher in charge did not notice pushing open the door, this would cause the tub to fall on his head, making him look like a boiled chicken.

The solution is simple: just don't enter the room at the same time, and watch the tub fall freely in front of you.

Therefore, Zhao Xu directly used his staff to push open the slightly ajar door.

Immediately after the impact sound, accompanied by the sound of the door opening, "Ah!".

However, the tub did not fall directly. In the corner that Zhao Xu could not see, a thin rope tightly secured the bottom of the tub, stopping its fall and causing the entire tub to flip over, and the water inside splashed out, pouring towards Zhao Xu, who was standing outside the door, holding his staff.

Zhao Xu, who had already prepared himself, immediately noticed the colorless and odorless liquid that poured out of the tub.

After guessing that it was water, he directly released the "Secondary Rapid Explosion" spell that he had prepared to release at any moment.
Here is the translation of the text:

Before Zhao Xu reached the fourth ring, he was unable to unleash his "Swift Explosion" and could only barely use it to try and obtain a slight movement, unable to use it to cast a spell, and he was also restricted by some constraints.

However, the water that was sprayed out was more than enough, but Zhao Xu gave up due to some psychological reason.

He only retreated a step, and the water poured down like a sword, directly slashing onto the woolen robe that had changed into being worn by Zhao Xu.

Although he avoided most of the water, he was still splashed by some.

Zhao Xu was indeed somewhat helpless, although he had just actively given up on using his spell to dodge, he had indeed been caught off guard.

He directly lifted his staff and slammed it down on the ground, producing a dull thud that covered up the laughter of the students in the classroom and the muffled sound of the incantation that had been compressed to the extreme.

Even if ordinary people heard it, they would think that Zhao Xu had suddenly let out a loud shout.

However, in reality, he had activated the ability of his staff, directly causing his "Detection Trap" spell to be released.

With a detection range of over 15 meters, Zhao Xu instantly judged that there were no simple traps in front of him.

If these "master" apprentices could use magical traps to ambush him, he would admit it.

At this time, Zhao Xu relied on his "Detection Trap" spell, slowly walking into the classroom, all the way to the podium, and silently looking down at the students in front of him, actually observing his students in secret.

Most of the students were a few years younger than him, and even the five mage players, who were around the same age, were already considered to be the oldest in the room.
Here is the translation of the text:

As I introduce myself, Zhong Xia. According to the deployment notice, I will be your guidance teacher. Zhong Xia said lightly tapping the desk ahead, "However, before that, I would like to ask, what's the purpose of hanging a wooden bucket with a rope? Is it to prevent the bucket from being too heavy and hitting someone?"

At this moment, an unexpected and eerie response came from an unknown source, "It's to make you, a self-proclaimed smart person, fall into the trap."

The entire class burst into laughter at this response. "Ah, he's really unbearable," Zhong Xia shook his head and sighed.

"I was just trying to make excuses in my heart, thinking that you all were just joking," Zhong Xia said, his tone gradually losing its warmth.

"Otherwise, I would find it really difficult to just pretend that this didn't happen."

As Zhong Xia reached for the pen on the desk to write on the blackboard behind him, he discovered that the ink had already started flowing, dripping down his wrist.

The ink was also too small and weak, beyond the detection range of the "trap" spell. It didn't even consider the trap a threat.

"Magical tricks," Zhong Xia waved his hand, and the water that had just been splashed on him, as well as the oil ink on his palm, instantly disappeared under the power of the spell.

"This kind of trick is also quite boring," Zhong Xia said, wiping his hands gently with a towel.

The students who had been watching Zhong Xia get hit again, who had been secretly laughing, suddenly fell silent as they saw Zhong Xia's magic.

As a member of a family of wizards, everyone, including the five players, was familiar with the difference between having magic and not having magic. If a wizard who could cast spells came to be their guidance teacher, it would mean that they would be closely monitored, except for those who were truly exceptional.
Here is the translation of the text:

"What are you trying to convince yourself of now?" Zhao Xu exclaimed, waving his hand in a magical gesture, and began to hear voices of hesitation around him.

"Oh, because I swore before I came in that if I got caught in any trap, I'd let each of you experience it too," Zhao Xu said nonchalantly.

As soon as he finished speaking, the students who were initially a bit wary of him burst out laughing. "What kind of magic are you using to drench us with water? Is it a hidden servant?" one of them asked.

The students sitting next to him couldn't help but laugh, and even started clapping their hands in excitement, trying to get the others to join in. Magicians wouldn't waste their time researching a spell just to drench someone with water.

Later, similar effects could be achieved by other spells, but that was just an additional effect of the original spell, and not the original intention. The spell itself was also very high-level.

Looking at everyone, Zhao Xu seemed like a teacher, not someone to be looked down upon. He could cast high-level spells, so he wouldn't be here.

Zhao Xu looked at everyone, who had initially been wary of him, and began to show no concern at all, without the slightest remorse. He took out a blank sheet of paper from his file folder and started scribbling on it, pretending to use it as a spellcasting material.

Zhao Xu looked at the whole class and whispered, "Rain, snow, storm."

Suddenly, several students from prominent families, who knew various secrets, shouted loudly, "Crazy!" But it was too late.
Here is the translation of the text:

The entire radius was exactly 24 meters, completely enough to cover the entire classroom range, directly bringing a torrent of extremely cold rain, mixed with snowflakes, and instantly blinding everyone's vision.

The hazy vision made it impossible for anyone to escape, and the icy rainwater directly flooded into each person's body, causing the classroom temperature to drop by 10 degrees in an instant.

The floor also froze due to the magical effect, forming a layer of transparent ice that was so slippery that anyone who didn't watch their step would slip and fall.

Zhao Xu initially intended to maintain this spell for seven rounds, enough to make everyone catch a cold, but he didn't do so.

Instead, he simply punished the students in the classroom for two rounds before terminating the spell.

Suddenly, most of the students in the classroom turned into "fallen angels" due to their reaction, with furious and angry expressions looking at Zhao Xu.

Not to mention that most of their clothes and belongings were soaked by this spell.

"Is he crazy? He wasted a three-hundred-gold-coin scroll just for the thrill of it!" one of the students who had just complained to Zhao Xu frowned and said.

Even they wouldn't dare to retaliate with a three-ring scroll, which was too extravagant for anyone to bear.

However, Zhao Xu had indeed lightly waved his hand with the ink stick, implying that his retaliation was far from over.

Just letting Zhao Xu take a shower, and they were mercilessly tortured by the icy rain for over ten seconds, which made Zhao Xu's hand covered in ink. Did he still have a chance to survive?

In an instant, a few students who had taken the lead recognized their mistakes and apologized.
