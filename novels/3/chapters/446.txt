Chapter 447: Secret of the Apocalypse

Vivian, who possessed dark vision, saw the giant insect's enormous and long body lying motionless on the ground, and her heart was shaken.

As she walked along, she felt that her guild master's abilities were extremely strong, but she didn't expect that she could also deal damage and kill a legendary monster face-to-face.

"This is the 'hammer of justice' with unlimited damage?" she sighed.

In the past, Vivian had seen her guild master use this spell when she followed him alongside May. However, she didn't expect that this spell, cast by Zhao Xu, would also have such immense power.

If Zhao Xu had just released a fireball spell, the fireball's power would have capped at level 10, with a range of 10-60 HP (10D6), and with the twin attribute bonus, it would have a total of 120 HP.

It was only this "hammer of justice" spell, which was linked to the caster's level, with 1-8 HP damage per level and no limit, that could be so "abnormal".

Zhao Xu had stacked his spellcasting level to 27, making this spell an essential skill outside of his "Frostbite Touch". If Anzhi Noya, who had stacked his spellcasting level to 70 or above, cast this spell, it would result in over a thousand points of damage.

This was something that ordinary players who were still using one- or two-ring spells couldn't even imagine, and even top-tier legendary mages could only deal hundreds of points of damage in a single spell.

"Let's go, don't just stand there," Anzhi Noya reminded her.
Zhao Xu chuckled and shook his head, "No, I didn't expect that one day I would be able to rely on the Three Rings spell to achieve such an extraordinary effect. Suddenly, I felt a sense of regret about the gap between mages and warriors, which is much larger than I initially thought."

Annie corrected him directly, "Zhao Xu, if you think that, you're too naive."

"I know, my mentor," Zhao Xu said with a sincere tone, "What I can do is something that other mages cannot replicate."

"Mastering the non-standard spell of Judgment Hammer, stacking 27 levels of spellcasting, and having the special talent of no-cost pairing, each of these is something that vast numbers of mages and clerics dare not even think about."

"I'm just self-aware that I'm not worthy of such strength, it's a bit of a feeling," Zhao Xu said.

At this moment, Zhao Xu seemed to be his past self.

If he had such ability back then, the black dragon would have been killed in an instant, where would he need to waste time, even accumulating for years to qualify to join a dragon-slaying team.

"Hmm."

Annie coldly laughed and analyzed Zhao Xu's thoughts, "Most of the monsters you've fought in the past are ancient relics left behind, all of which are ordinary monsters with no profession level and no evolution."

"They are just relying on the old challenge evaluation system, so the giant worm Nightmare can only claim to be an 18-level challenge. "

"True monsters that have survived through the waves of history, especially legendary ones, have evolved to a level beyond your imagination. Today, you are in this ancient graveyard, so you've encountered these primitive monsters."

"So, Annie, you just killed a small monster, and you're still very weak," Annie concluded.

"..."

Zhao Xu, who was about to sigh, suddenly fell into an awkward emotional state.
Here is the translation of the text:

After a long time, he barely managed to spit out the words, "Teacher, thank you for reminding me."

However, Anniya was not bothered at all, and she began to hum a tune.

This surprised Zhao Xu a bit, and he couldn't help but ask, "Teacher, is it really okay to be so happy when hitting students?"

"No, I just think that fate is cyclical," Anniya replied. "I didn't have a good teacher-student relationship in recent years. And only now did I realize that the way my teacher taught me back then was so delightful."

Vivian made a timely comment, "My lord, when you were teaching the young lady, it was also a matter of choosing the right approach for her, not intentionally trying to intimidate her."

Vivian's interruption suddenly shifted Anniya's focus to her, and Anniya couldn't help but slowly take a closer look at her.

Zhao Xu didn't know why, but Vivian showed no emotion at all, behaving like a "tool person".

As a demon, Vivian could transform into a saint warrior, which was already full of contradictions. However, Vivian had masked all of this.

It wasn't until Anniya appeared that Vivian started to "show her true colors".

Zhao Xu looked at the situation and thought it was a bit off, so he quickly changed the subject, "Let's keep going, who knows what will happen next?"

However, after Zhao Xu raised this flag, the road suddenly became peaceful, despite each of them carefully observing the surroundings on both sides. However, they didn't encounter any more monsters.

It was as if the giant shadow that had just appeared was just a shared illusion.
Here is the translation of the text:

Only the occasional stone statues without facial features appear on either side of the road, reminding the three of them that this is the tomb of an ancient elemental god.

The vast and empty stone floor is only accompanied by the sound of the three people's footsteps, as if an unspoken performance is being played for the long-dormant tomb. After walking for half an hour, the three finally arrived at a completely different place.

A stone staircase stood before them, with each step almost as tall as a person, rising all the way to the distant, unreachable sky. Annyoja finally regained her composure and said, "We'll just fly up to the high platform from here. There's a path leading to the main tomb from there."

Instantly, the three of them unfolded their flight abilities, controlling their speeds and flying in parallel above the staircase.

"It's really strange," Zhao Xu said with a sigh. "All these gods are dead, and yet they're buried in such a large tomb. It's not like they should just use some kind of 'sealing technique' to confine themselves in a mysterious place, away from human disturbance."

"It's like the gods' corpses are drifting in the starry expanse," he added. "And because of the vastness of the starry expanse, it's difficult to search for them."

He glanced around casually, and the staircase in front of him was at least over a thousand steps long, covering a distance equivalent to three full circles of a running track.

Annyoja nodded, saying, "You're right to some extent. If these gods don't want to live again, it would indeed be like that."

"Generally, those who are not heartbroken and foolish would not design such a grand and complex tomb. They would rather rely on the ancient ritual passed down through the gods to revive themselves."
Here is the translation of the text:

"Would you like to live again?"

Zhao Xiumin brought up this key phrase in a sensitive manner, and his eyes were fixed on An Tiya who was standing beside him.

"For ordinary humans, resurrection is just a simple five-ring magic, but for gods, it would definitely not be a difficult feat to achieve."

"Because gods can resurrect instantly, they also won't publicize it, so you won't know they've died. It's just like how you won't publicize your past when you were killed by an immortal creature in the temple of the underworld in Anta City."

"When all ordinary resurrection methods fail, death becomes a permanent and irreversible fact for gods."

"At this moment, the fire element's tomb is in front of us, and the master of this tomb is the first 'fire element' in this multiverse, and can be said to be the true 'master of fire elements'. Even the will of the dead continues to suppress the stability of the fire element's domain."

Zhao Xiumin was also somewhat emotional at this moment, "Murszelin is the source of the fire element, no wonder I've read about it in the ancient literature, but the details are unclear, only knowing that it's significant to the fire element domain."

"If I hadn't traveled back in time to the Dark Era and saw the name on the Morlin Stone Tablet, I might not have remembered it today."

"It's just that names like this seem to have nearly disappeared from history, and even the incantation to summon the fire element doesn't mention the former immortal who has passed away."

At this moment, An Tiya's tone became somewhat subtle.

"What?" Zhao Xiumin and Vivian both perked up their ears.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

From just now, Zhao Xu realized that An Ti Nuo Ya's knowledge and skills were several decades ahead, and he couldn't find any relevant knowledge at all.

At this time, An Ti Nuo Ya seemed to have some hesitation, hesitating for a moment before speaking up.

"Because this deity is self-murdered."
"Ernest told him that Arthur would certainly perish in the future, and it committed suicide to avoid calamity."
"It planned to wait until the end of the world and then resurrect itself from the ashes of this world."

This sentence left Zhao Xu and Wei Wei both with their mouths agape, barely able to shut them.

This ancient element god, the eternal emperor of all fire elements, was too realistic.

"The key to the problem is that Ernest didn't initially dare to confirm whether the end of the world would indeed happen. Is it true that it will happen in the future?"

"This is the most ironic part of everything."
