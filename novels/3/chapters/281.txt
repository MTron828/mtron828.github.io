Chapter 282: Superhuman Power

"Master?" Lark looked at Zhao Xu, who was in a trance-like state, and asked him.

"I'm fine," Zhao Xu shook his head, regaining his composure, and said.

Just now, the scene had changed so quickly, and each scene was like a delicate dance on the edge of a sword. One misstep could lead to a fatal outcome. Therefore, Zhao Xu's mental state was extremely tense from start to finish, especially when he was possessed by the corpse of the Nai Lao Priest. He was always on the verge of "breathing" as he acted.

Reminiscent of the plot of "The Path to Becoming a God" and the statue in front of him, which was the "God of Slaughter" Edmond. It was as if Zhao Xu had directly entered the perspective of the God of Slaughter, who had experienced everything in the book.

However, Zhao Xu did not expect that the biography of the God of Slaughter in the book only briefly mentioned his rise to power. But he had just directly experienced the details in first-person perspective.

Moreover, he was confident that his every move was not much different from that of the God of Slaughter.

In such a limited choice of circumstances, everyone's choices were similar, and he finally chose to replace the corpse at the critical moment.

At each moment, Zhao Xu was constantly evaluating his performance, trying to reach the limit of his state, and even exceeding it by a small margin, which meant he had completely exposed himself.

At this time, Zhao Xu also told Lark about his recent experiences.
After hearing Zhao Xu's explanation, Lakshmi remained silent for a moment before speaking up again: "Do you know how long you've been in a daze, Master?"

Zhao Xu quickly understood that his sense of time was likely to be inconsistent with Lakshmi's perception of time, given that he was in an external state.

"How long?" Zhao Xu asked, while also observing the surrounding environment and trying to sense the traces of time and his own hunger level.

In theory, he had only spent less than half an hour in the perspective of the "Killing God".

Most of the time was spent struggling in the shroud, and the earliest two scenes were even shorter than one or two minutes.

However, Lakshmi replied, "Just an instant."

Zhao Xu was so surprised that he couldn't even emit a voice of surprise.

He began to think about the impact of the time dimension on him.

As someone who had mastered the "Time Stop" technique and had experienced multiple rounds of time, Zhao Xu had a profound understanding of this aspect.

However, compared to the "Time Stop" technique that he had mastered, where he had experienced multiple rounds of time, the external world had only passed a fleeting moment.

Zhao Xu had essentially spent almost half an hour in his consciousness, while the external world had only passed a fleeting moment.

Arthur's time scale and Earth's time scale were consistent.

If Zhao Xu had just gone online and then experienced this experience before logging off, he would have noticed that only a few minutes had passed on Earth.

However, in reality, he had spent almost half an hour in the perspective of the "Killing God" in the Arthur game.
Here is the translation of the text:

"It's a shame that ordinary players can't even touch such high-level powers. Even the ability to verify the "Time Stop" spell with nine rings is impossible because the time difference is too small, and the level of the nine-ring spell is too high for players to access. Is this a manifestation of divine power?" Zhao Xu asked Lark suspiciously.

However, Lark shook her head inside Zhao Xu's mind and said, "Master, slowing down time speed would require a huge price, even for a spell itself. 'Secondary rapid explosion' would also cause oneself to become dizzy and disoriented to balance such a large time difference."

"That means there are means beyond spells?" Zhao Xu asked Lark, who replied, "Yes, master. The most convenient method is actually to achieve it through a slow world where time flows slowly. You might experience a century in that world, but the main material plane would only pass a year."

As soon as Zhao Xu heard this, he couldn't help but laugh and asked, "If it's that strong, why doesn't the association deploy all reserve personnel to a slow world with a hundredfold time speed. Wouldn't it be possible to cultivate a large number of legendary mages in just over ten years?"

"This kind of slow world with a hundredfold time speed has limited world energy, and it's not enough to supply a single legendary mage, let alone cultivate a large number," Lark told Zhao Xu directly.

"If you really want to use it to upgrade legendary mages, it's likely that a legendary mage would consume hundreds of such worlds, which is not strange at all."

World, energy, supply.

Zhao Xu immediately grasped the key words mentioned by Lark, and the fog in his mind became clearer.

However, he directly asked, "What about the long-term situation, then?"
Here is the translation:

A mage directly transported himself to a world where time flows at a pace one hundred times slower. After sleeping for eight hours in that world, he spent an hour preparing a spell. When he returned to the Arthurian world, he realized that only six minutes and forty seconds had passed. Zhao Xu immediately seized this loophole and said, "It's not incorrect, but the owner, when preparing a spell, will inevitably consume the lifespan of that half-plane. Only sleeping for eight hours in that half-plane without preparing a spell is a way without cost."

After listening to Lark's explanation, Zhao Xu also began to understand. Even if he said it again and again, a world where time flows at a pace one hundred times slower can reduce a mage's sleep time by eight hours, and then he can spend an hour preparing a spell in Arthurian time.

The only question is that slowing down time by a factor of one hundred is extremely difficult to achieve.

"Just like I just did, I actually slowed down time in that half-plane world, which reduced my personal time," Zhao Xu thought to himself. From then on, he had always been curious about this kind of phenomenon.

Thinking about it, this half-plane with such a feature is even more valuable than a divine artifact from some angle.

"Master, what are those three divine marks you just got?" Lark finally shifted his attention back to Zhao Xu.

The former God of Killing came to the "Land of the Slumberer" Ananta, relying on his own reaction ability and the "incantation" given by the old shepherd, and finally succeeded in obtaining the divine mark, becoming a god.

This time, Zhao Xu came to the "Land of the Slumberer" with only Lark, empty-handed, and yet received the gift of the God of Killing.

"The three divine marks represent the use of three divine powers," Zhao Xu said.

At this time, the three divine marks had begun to take shape in his mind, and Zhao Xu also began to feel the power of the three divine marks.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

He said with a skeptical tone, "Are they all weakened 'divine powers'?"

"Divine powers?" Even Lark could hardly ask with a trembling tone at this point.

Zhao Xu indeed nodded slightly, "That's correct, but all three divine marks are clearly marked. As long as the statue is facing the correct direction, it will work."

"I use one move, and the statue will take a step forward and swing its sword. Until I successfully swing the third sword, the statue will dissolve into nothingness, waiting for the next opportunity to manifest."

Zhao Xu initially felt that the description of divine powers was very powerful when he first saw it.

However, when he swung the first sword, it also meant that the subsequent two parts could not be hidden, so Zhao Xu did not show his hand at all.

"What kind of power is that?" Lark asked with excitement, unable to conceal her inner emotions.

"The Lord of the Dead?" Zhao Xu spoke softly, looking at the first divine mark.

However, he failed to notice that the residual vibration caused by this repetition of the sound wave had already caused the undead creatures far away to kneel down towards this side.
