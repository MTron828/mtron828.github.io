Chapter 107: Diviner

Zhaoxu lifted his hand and pressed the excited maple leaf, causing the other person to loosen their grip on the thief's collar.

With the battle strength of the three of them, they were more than enough to handle the group of people in front of them.

However, they were not in the wild, and nearby guards could quickly respond to any disturbance. By the time they arrived, it would be too late.

If these thieves hadn't prepared beforehand, they would have been foolish to attempt a heist near the city gate. "Is this wallet yours?" Zhaoxu smiled kindly, looking at the 18-19 year old thief who had already learned to be fierce and ruthless.

"Yeah, you bunch of outsiders, go back to your hole and behave," the thief replied, mistakenly thinking Zhaoxu was intimidated.

Zhaoxu, dressed as a scholar, looked down on people like them. However, the important figures in Moon Bay Town had undergone training from the very beginning and were well aware of the situation.

These outsiders, who had always been the best targets, had been coming and going hastily.

"Young man, some things aren't yours to take, and it will burn your hand," Zhaoxu seemed to have returned to his former role.

However, the thief, Chuck, suddenly felt a sense of unease, as if facing a town administrator. But he quickly recovered and became even more enraged, saying, "Don't think that just because you're dressed up like a big shot, we'll be afraid of you. The Morlin brothers will never back down from a fight."

After saying this, Chuck turned around and said, "Brothers, someone has ruined my clothes, what should we do?"

As he spoke, Chuck shook his clothes, indicating that the maple leaf had wrinkled his collar.
Here is the translation of the text:

Compensation, I think this gentleman's outfit is not bad, Chuck, you can definitely look just as good wearing it, haha. Another companion of Chuck also stepped forward.

Zhao Xiu gazed into the distance, noticing that the target person was getting closer, and thought to himself that it was perfect timing to take action. His demeanor was a bit too low-key.

"You'd better open this wallet first, and I can prove it belongs to us. If it can't be proven, I can give you this dress as compensation," Zhao Xiu said with a hint of cunning smile.

Chuck's eyes lit up when he heard this. He thought that the dress would definitely be his, and he could already imagine himself wearing the scholar's outfit, feeling quite impressive.

Chuck directly opened his hand, revealing his palm.

They had previously undergone a comprehensive training, and no matter what Zhao Xiu said, it would all fall into his next set of words.

Chuck chuckled to himself, thinking that this foolish man was too naive. He thought that the previous owner had never questioned anything or tried to prove anything.

The temple of justice had not yet covered the Moonlight Town!

The mix of three teachings and nine arts was the true reason for the flourishing of this place.

"Don't you know the aphorism of King Arthur - everything will choose its own master?"

Zhao Xiu then muttered a simple incantation - "The Hand of the Mage"!

As he waved his hand, the wallet that had been quietly lying in Chuck's palm suddenly flew up and flew towards him.

"You're using deception," Chuck's face turned pale with anger, but his heart began to coldly smile. He not only got the wallet and dress, but could also beat up the person in front of him.

Zhao Xiu remained as calm and composed as ever.
Here is the translation of the text:

While Maple Leaf and Rainbow immediately put their hands on their weapons, they didn't bother to actually start fighting, wondering if they could kill their way out of the town.

Chuck suddenly raised his fist, ready to throw a punch, but a thin hand, similar to a hawk's claw, pressed heavily on his shoulder, neutralizing his force.

This familiar feeling made Chuck's originally hot-hearted inner self suddenly cool down.

He turned around in surprise, only to find that the one holding him was the second-in-command of their brotherhood, Iron Luo, who was responsible for teaching them their skills.

Before Chuck could speak, Iron Luo's hand directly slid down his arm and finally grabbed Chuck's right hand, saying, "This esteemed gentleman, it was my men who just disrespected you, and I apologize. Now, I'll punish him."

"No need to bother with the fingers, I have no interest in maiming others," said Zhao Xu, who had seen enough of these tricks.

"Okay," Iron Luo said sincerely.

A whip-like kick followed.

Chuck fell to the ground, his whole body trembling, and it seemed like he was about to vomit.

The men behind Iron Luo all jumped in surprise.

Chuck, however, gritted his teeth, his forehead covered in cold sweat, but didn't dare make a sound.

"Are you satisfied, sir?" Iron Luo asked, bowing down.

"That's it," Zhao Xu said, knowing the outcome would be like this, and he spat at the thought.

"Well, let's go," Zhao Xu said, tossing his wallet to Maple Leaf before turning and walking away.

Maple Leaf and Rainbow followed Zhao Xu through the crowd, not stopping until the group of people behind them had disappeared around the street corner. Only then did Maple Leaf ask, "Mr. Zhongxia, what's going on? Why did that person get punished instead?"
Here is the translation of the text:

"It's simple because I've intimidated them with my fake magic," Zhao Xu explained calmly.

Just then, Feng Ye finally understood and hung his head in regret. "I was too impulsive. We have a mission to complete, and the wallet wasn't even worth much. Losing it would just mean losing it, and almost jeopardizing the entire operation. But that old man's methods are brutal. If he really broke one of his fingers, it would take at least half a month to recover."

Zhao Xu just smiled and didn't say much more.

The old man didn't punish him on the spot, but it wasn't that simple. He had to receive his explanation afterwards.

When he got back, the kid who had gone astray was scolded. Who let him get lost and find the wrong target?

The zero-level magic of the mage was called "magic tricks" and wasn't just for show. The effect was too similar to the tricks of those rural magicians.

So when the thief saw the old man's magic, his first reaction wasn't fear, but anger, thinking he was using tricks to deceive.

But Zhao Xu was clear that when he entered the association and left the association, the old man was standing near the entrance, observing the market situation from afar.

When he intervened to stop the conflict, the old man followed from a distance.

So after he released the magic, even if the old man was stupid, he should have known that he was a real mage.

It wouldn't be good to provoke a mage near the association, like spitting on a death god's statue and begging for death.

If there hadn't been that old man, he would have used a first-level magic spell to let the thieves know they had messed with the wrong people.

And Zhao Xu had to use magic to scare off the Mo Lin brothers and make them stop following them.

Otherwise, losing the wallet wouldn't be the only problem, and the mission would be jeopardized. These underground forces are much more sensitive to the stench than ordinary people.
When Zhao Xu thought about it, they followed Lao Ya's instructions and intentionally wandered around the entire Moonlight Town, making sure no one was following them before finally entering a mysterious and dark divination shop with no customers.

The door was already slightly ajar, with a dusty curtain that hadn't been washed in a long time. Rainbow looked around the room with a look of disgust at the decorations.

A ordinary crystal ball lay on a soft cushion, while on the wall corner, there were many cards used for divination. A corner incense burner was continuously burning wormwood.

"Where are people?" Maple Leaf wondered.

Yisi had explicitly confirmed that someone would meet them here today.

"Is there someone?" Rainbow couldn't help but shout loudly.

However, at this moment, the air was filled with the oppressive feeling of a storm about to break, and no other unusual sounds echoed.

Rainbow, being one who loved to wander, was examining the room while trying to walk in, looking for any clues. However, after taking a few steps, he stopped still, his voice trembling slightly: "Maple Brother, Mr. Zhongxiao, hurry over here."

Zhao Xu immediately rushed over.

The entire room was in disarray, with things turned upside down as if someone had rummaged through them. But what was even more striking wasâ€”

A dead body, dressed in divination attire, with a similar appearance to their contact person, lay on a stool, with a long sword piercing his heart.

Zhao Xu suddenly had a flash of clarity.

He already understood that this task was over.

His adventure was also over.
