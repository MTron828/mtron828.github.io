Chapter 249: The Truth Below

Zhao Xu was suddenly awakened by "Lakis" reminding him that something was amiss, and his heart was already racing with alarm.

However, thanks to Lakis, he was able to learn about the "Lawbreaker's Disintegration Technique" before his magical perception kicked in.

Initially, Zhao Xu almost lost his temper.

He had never done anything bad in his past life in this Star Lake.

How could the "Jade Emperor" Frank casually use a technique that could bankrupt him?

In general, a practitioner who has mastered a set of long-lasting spells, like Zhao Xu, may seem invincible, but it's not necessarily the case.

Because a practitioner can use a three-ring "Cancel Spell" or a six-ring "Higher Cancel Spell" to achieve a certain probability of spell effect cancellation.

He had built a defensive structure, but others could come and dismantle it, or even blow it up.

However, when one reaches the ninth ring...

Everything changes.

A spell that brings tears to both sides was born.

The "Lawbreaker's Disintegration Technique" can 100% cancel all magical effects on an opponent's body.

If someone uses a longevity spell to prolong their life, it would be instantly cancelled, resulting in a situation where their life expires.

However, if the spell is only used to cancel magical effects, this technique would become a "greeting" for law mages when they meet.

Moreover, it has an additional effect, causing all law mages who dare to use it to inevitably fall into an endless, irreversible situation.

As a result, this technique becomes the "nuclear weapon" of a ninth-ring law mage, Arthur.
Here is the translation of the text:

The Council of Mages summoned nine mages to sign a protocol stating that they would not use the "Soul Shattering Spell" first. This spell would simultaneously dispel all magical items on the opponent's body. The items' inherent value and the owner's inherent value would be compared, and the higher one would be used for the willpower test. If any item failed, it would be restored to its original form by the "Soul Shattering Spell". For example, if Zhao Xu's "Stellar Cloak" worth 130,000 gold coins was unable to withstand the test, it would be reduced to a ordinary cloak worth less than 100 gold coins. Zhao Xu's eyes blazed with fury at the thought.

Just as this was happening, the opponent was about to finish reciting the incantation. Zhao Xu was about to shout "I have a divine artifact!" when the opponent suddenly activated the "Soul Shattering Spell". This spell was extremely rare and could destroy divine artifacts, but its success rate was only 1% per caster level. Frankly speaking, it was unlikely that the opponent would succeed more than one-quarter of the time.

If the opponent actually destroyed the divine artifact without passing the willpower test, they would lose their magical abilities. Not even miracle or prayer spells could prevent this situation. Therefore, it was a good idea to carry a divine artifact to protect other magical items. However, the opponent had already begun reciting the incantation, and Zhao Xu could only sigh in resignation.

Zhao Xu immediately activated the "Combination Spell" he had pre-set earlier. He recalled the scene of himself casting the sixth-level spell "Triggering Spell". This process was the condition for activating his "Trigger Spell". Suddenly, the "Trigger Spell" on Zhao Xu's body burst forth with immense energy, instantly driving the fourth-level "Swift Release" spell he had prepared.
Here is the translation:

Relying on this combination, Zhao Xu's entire body state suddenly entered a slow-motion mode, as if everything around him had almost come to a standstill.

He had acquired precious time to cast the "Trigger" spell.

This was the most opportune moment for the "Flashy Release" spell, which allowed him to cast it before the opponent could finish their spell.

Unfortunately, the opponent did not understand the "Flashy Release" spell, and could have countered by casting it before Zhao Xu activated the "Trigger" spell.

At that point, Zhao Xu would have had to think about dismantling the opponent's "Flashy Release" spell and entering a battle of magical actions.

However, Zhao Xu did not dwell on this too much, and his focus was completely on the specific countermeasures.

He tried to cast a defensive spell, but it would be laughable, like trying to block a knife with tofu.

The "Slicing Spell" was a spell that burst forth from the opponent, covering an area with a radius of 12.5 meters.

It was four times larger than the range of a fireball spell, and it was impossible to escape.

As for the "Gate of Randomness", the scope of its vision was within the range of the spell, which meant that the entire space of the treasure room was covered by the spell. Therefore, he wanted to escape by using the "Teleportation" spell, which would undoubtedly alert someone outside.

Another option was to directly cast the "Anti-Magic Field" spell.

At this point, Zhao Xu and the opponent were about four meters apart, just outside the range of the spell, making it impossible to stop the opponent from casting.

However, the Anti-Magic Field, even when outside, had a 1% chance to be destroyed, just like a divine artifact.

But Zhao Xu still had to remove the Anti-Magic Field himself, which was too passive.

Just as Zhao Xu hesitated slightly, two seconds had already passed.
Here is the translation of the text:

If he delays any further, the timing of the burst will not be sufficient to cast the spell, and when the time comes, he will only be able to watch the other person cast the spell while he himself sends off a bunch of magical equipment to disappear in smoke.

Burst.

Suddenly, Zhao Xuan's mind flashed with this phrase.

Arthur can be vague about everything, but when it comes to the list of spells, there is no ambiguity in the description of the spell.

The principle of the spell's effect is based on countless theoretical derivations and experiments, and it's not just a matter of changing it.

So it's a burst, not a gradual spread!

In other words, if something is blocking his way.

The spell effect is not instantaneous and will only come into effect after a delay!

Just like this spell's effect will not penetrate through walls.

After thinking this through, Zhao Xuan directly let out a light laugh and then cast another five-ring spell - "Stone Wall!"

And behold, a vast stone wall suddenly emerged from the ground, rising all the way to the ceiling.

The area covered was over ten square meters, equivalent to six large beds stacked together.

It was almost as if the entire room was being divided.

This spell is not a type of "fire wall" from the creation school, nor is it a "wall of order" from the defensive school, nor is it an "illusion wall" from the illusion school.

It is a genuine, tangible stone wall created by the conjuration school.

The duration of the spell is instantaneous, meaning it will not disappear even after the duration has passed.

This is also a characteristic of the conjuration school, which is not vulnerable to various anti-magic effects.

However, after Zhao Xuan created the stone wall, he noticed that Frank, the nine-ring mage, had used a spell to remove the stone wall in front of him, but Frank did not continue to cast the spell.
Here is the translation of the text:

This also made Zhao Xu, who was preparing to counterattack with the second spell, slightly taken aback.

"'Master, he cancelled the spell,' Lark explained.

'Not bad, he actually has a sense of intuition,' Frank, the master of the gemstone star, said with a smile as he sat down on a recliner, holding a cup of hot coffee that was emitting a gentle smoke.

'Not fighting?' Zhao Xu asked.

However, his brow was still locked in a tight expression, with no sign of relaxation.

Just now, Frank had claimed to be a seven-ring mage, and then he got slapped with a nine-ring spell. He didn't have a second trigger to supplement, let alone the 1-round penalty that was still to come after using "Quick Burst". Therefore, he was unable to release "Quick Burst" again.

'No need, but if you can use a countermeasure, you have the right to ask me, Frank,' the man with a silver-white metallic glow on his body said.

'Incantation is not difficult, but finding the right spell is something that mages spend their whole lives thinking about,' Frank suddenly sighed.

Zhao Xu didn't expect this situation, and the atmosphere suddenly became awkward.

'Master, don't waste your words, go a bit closer to him and cover a range of three meters,' Lark continued to remind Zhao Xu.

'If something goes wrong, master, you can use "Anti-Magical Field" oh,'

Zhao Xu heard this and couldn't help but ask, 'Lark, can you transform into a god tool?'

'Ah, master, how did you react so quickly? Is it possible that you've changed people?' Lark complained.

When he heard this, Zhao Xu just smiled and didn't say a word.
Here is the translation of the text:

Lysander made him burn the jade stone, creating a "counter-magic zone" where neither the enemy nor himself could cast spells again.

This was because the counter-magic zone did not affect divine artifacts.

As a result, if Lysander could transform into the "Book of All Laws" at any moment, and his counter-magic zone had a range of over a hundred meters. Even legendary mages would get caught off guard if they were careless.

However, Zhao Xu still followed Lysander's advice and pretended to be going to negotiate, taking a few steps forward.

The complex variables of the mage made it so that sometimes, after eliminating most of the abilities and compressing them into a competition, decision-making would become easier.

"Ah, you're asking me something?" Frank lightly blew off the mist on his coffee cup.

"What do you mean?" Lysander told Zhao Xu with a hint of puzzlement. "I feel like the other party doesn't seem to have any malicious intentions."

Zhao Xu's insight and his "Reading People" skill, which had reached level 30, did not hint at any anomalies.

Zhao Xu remained vigilant. "I want to ask, what is the truth behind the birth of the Star Lake?"

Frank's eyes suddenly flashed with a faint silver light. "You're also looking for something at the bottom?"
