Chapter 626 Domain outside the world, missing time
"Hurry up, come over and recount the scene at that time."
At this time, a guard captain urgently ran over, looking at a group of dejected guards behind him, tightly grasping the portrait in his hand and questioning.
"Are you sure the other party went down from here?"
In this barren and material-poor place, the "parchment portrait" held by the other party completely exceeded everyone's expectations.
And the soldiers bound by iron chains, all looked at the parchment paper with fear and said, "Yes, this gentleman went down from here. He threatened us to surrender."
"After he went down, I stayed at the mouth of the cave for a long time, but there was no response. Several waves of people came here to go down, but there was no response."
Another warrior player in a deep purple captain's uniform frowned and looked at the deep, invisible cave.
At the beginning, he sent down a few skilled climbers, but still no one climbed back up.
It seemed that the cave below was like a huge gaping mouth, devouring anyone who dared to go down.
"Report!"
At this time, a group of cavalry suddenly rushed over from a distance, all of them were in high spirits, wearing armor and riding horses, all in the unified equipment of Yanan at this time.
Many young people in the army have solved lifelong matters directly with this outfit, making joining the guard team in Yanan as a soldier a popular job.
The leading cavalryman walked over with a serious expression and saluted the purple-clad commander responsible for the cave in front of him, saying, "Sir, I am now handing over some intelligence to you." Following the procedure of witnessing the destruction of the sealed intelligence, he bowed and left, then returned to the queue to prepare for retreat.

At this time of great activity, the importance of using a cavalry squad to escort intelligence can be imagined. The commander, at this moment, couldn't care less about the strong wind in the field and immediately opened the confidential letter in his hand.

In an instant, he almost couldn't hold onto the letter, letting it float down into the depths of the cave. The many guards standing by all lowered their heads silently, fearing the wrath of the commander.

The parchment was written with the message that no other forces that had entered the cave had come out so far. The commander couldn't help but clench his fists, shouting in his heart, "Zhong Xia, do you want us to take the risk? Can Yanan now survive without your presence?"

Since the crossing, the contact between Zhao Xu and Yanan, powered by teleportation, had never been interrupted for more than 2 hours. Even if it exceeded 2 hours, Yanan's high-level emergency team would activate the emergency plan and use special means to contact Zhao Xu.

But from two days ago until now, the entire barren and deadly land had been attacked by an overwhelming number of undead creatures, and every department was busy. And the most crucial figure in Yanan, the peak Zhong Xia, had inexplicably disappeared.

The intelligence just received deepened the commander's inner panic. Perhaps in the future, Yanan would be able to break free from Zhong Xia's influence, but at this moment, Yanan could not afford to lose Zhong Xia, or it would instantly fall apart.
Here is the translation of the text:

At this moment, a majestic carriage as wide as a house, capable of seating over ten people, slowly approached with a team of over ten black-armored guards surrounding it. "Who is this? I didn't instruct anyone to make this area a restricted zone, and no one is allowed to enter without permission," the commander suddenly shouted at his subordinate nearby, his face reddening with anger. "Is this the highest order from my hand, drawn at will?"

"No, sir," the subordinate quickly explained, "this carriage has special permission for passage, even the highest authority in the Ailan government can pass through freely."

Just as the commander's expression began to clear, the carriage slowly came to a stop beside the cave entrance. A stunningly beautiful young girl descended from the carriage, none other than the princess who was supposed to be in charge of coordinating the development of Ailan. The girl, Esvei, also stepped down from the carriage, surveying her surroundings.

Princess Wang Congwei then leaned into the carriage, saying, "Uncle, Aunt, he's the one who went missing here, you don't need to worry, our people are already tracking his location and will feed back the information."

At this point, the commander had lowered his head, bowing respectfully towards his distant niece. His ears, however, were twitching with curiosity.

Little Star?
Could it be that the people inside the carriage were the parents of Congwei's partner? But he hadn't heard that Congwei was even in a relationship.

Just as he hesitated, a voice came from inside the carriage, "Let me take a look, how can this be? A person as big as this, just vanished into thin air."

In an instant, a thunderbolt struck the commander's heart.

Ah, Summer!
It turned out that the young girl was nicknamed "Little Star"? How could he not have noticed? It seemed that the two elderly people inside the carriage were about to reveal their identities.
The commander immediately took off his helmet, saluted, and prepared to move forward while considering how to break through this rare relationship. At this moment, he suddenly realized that his niece, Ning Wei, cared about her family, and had given up this opportunity for him. Suddenly, everyone present froze. They all heard a sound coming from the depths of the cave. Slowly, the commander, who had been thinking about taking the upper route, suddenly stiffened and had a sense of deep defeat. He muttered to himself, "How is this possible? How can it still be like this?" "It's impossible, right? With these resources, how can our soldiers still be unknown, suffering from dozens of injuries for half a day, and worrying about whether they can output smoothly?" However, no one around him answered. They were all reciting these mysterious contents to themselves, with an indescribable look of joy on their faces. All the guards who were originally guarding the area had the same expression, listening intently to this familiar "speech." Because everyone recognized it. On the other side of the cave, the owner of the voice was Zhong Xia! At the same time, on the savage continent, countless similar deep caves, from which undead creatures ran out from mysterious locations, were also attracting people to come closer and observe the situation inside. And at this moment, these caves also emitted the same sound! At this moment, the vast majority of people in the savage dead land had heard Zhao Xu's wish. Everyone who had a second piece of clothing had heard his voice. Even the most foolish person would realize that what Zhong Xia said was of extraordinary significance.
Here are the translations:

"The ultimate charge, the true cost will make this role unable to do anything except output, and its effect will become single-dimensional! And the charge resource, the most likely problem it will face is the output environment issue."

"However, as long as you complete these requirements, I can say that even in this chaotic wilderness, you won't have many opponents."
