Chapter 237: Real Feedback

Zhao Xu gazed at Zhang Qi, who was lying on the bed opposite him. The running lights on the brain dome headgear on Zhang Qi's head were flashing rapidly, as if he was experiencing a fierce battle. It was unnecessary to say that Zhang Qi and others had noticed that Zhao Xu had disappeared from reality when they prepared to set out in the morning.

Perhaps they thought he had left without notice or even had some guesses filled with fear. However, they definitely could not have imagined that Zhao Xu had been teleported to the dormitory of the Mage Association in Winter City.

His soul had also drifted to the "Legend Library" in Floating City. Considering it was already noon, Zhang Qi and others were likely to have arrived at Star Lake by now, and perhaps even fought a few battles. In reality, players still had illusions about negotiations, thinking the other side would surrender the perpetrator.

However, the mine owners suddenly flung their iron fists, crushing the players and tearing open a rift. Zhao Xu was about to put on his headgear when he discovered that his brain was still foggy.

He even doubted whether he had stayed up all night without sleep. This bizarre feeling, completely opposite to reality, made Zhao Xu suddenly alert.

He immediately held his breath, relaxed his entire body, and recalled the last moments of the previous night's game.

He remembered looking at a book on close-range combat magic, and then falling asleep in the game. After falling asleep, his soul would usually be sent back to Arthur's body.

Normally, Zhao Xu could seamlessly switch between the two worlds the next day. However, this time, he had directly disconnected.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

At this time, Zhao Xu didn't dare to continue his reckless behavior, and he struggled to climb down from the bed, feeling weak and exhausted.

As soon as he stepped off the bed, he suddenly felt a dizziness, as if the world was spinning around him. He quickly grabbed the nearby railing to maintain his balance.

After a while, Zhao Xu finally made it to his cupboard and took out a pack of chocolate, which he then unwrapped and ate with water. This time, he felt a slight recovery in his physical strength.

Zhao Xu had come to realize that something was amiss. He quickly put on a coat and left the dormitory to head to the hospital.

It wasn't until the afternoon, around 1-2 pm, that Zhao Xu finished his medical examination and obtained his test results.

As he looked at the chief doctor in front of him, he was plunged into deep confusion. "Doctor, you're saying I'm anemic?" Zhao Xu was hard to believe.

It was clear that he had eaten well every day and had a high metabolism. Moreover, since he started frequenting the "Legend Library", he had reduced his exercise time significantly.

Zhao Xu was hard to believe that he was actually malnourished.

After the doctor's explanation, Zhao Xu could only follow the doctor's prescription and take some medicine, while holding his waist and walking slowly back to the dormitory.

Compared to when he was bedridden and could only take a bus ride to the hospital, Zhao Xu was now able to walk back to the dormitory without any difficulty.

At this point, Zhao Xu also wanted to test his physical abilities, so he decided to take a direct route back. The 3-kilometer journey took him about an hour to complete.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

Zhou Xu was constantly lost in thought as he walked along the road, wondering how his current physical state was related to his use of the latent ability last night. He wasn't too worried about the latent ability affecting him, according to the doctor's words, his condition was similar to that of someone who had gone on a few days of fasting.

However, Zhou Xu couldn't help but think that maybe Arthur had started to affect the Earth. As he walked up the slope of the campus, he looked around at the students pushing their bicycles, and delved into the reality of the situation.

They, the Earthlings, were like summoned projections from another world, brought to Arthur's projection. Those summoned projections were often time-limited, and even if they died, they wouldn't affect the original entity in the other world. Even demons and evil spirits, if they didn't die in their own world, couldn't truly die, and would eventually descend to the depths and undergo reincarnation as a lower-level demon.

As for his current condition, was it because he had used his latent ability for the first time, affecting his physical body on Earth? Or was it because he had been lying in bed for a long time, contracted some kind of syndrome? If it was indeed affected, it would lead to many unpredictable situations.

However, no matter how he thought about it, he couldn't think of anyone in his past life who could use magic or divine arts on Earth. On the other hand, most people were like him, with a small illness or slight discomfort.
Here is the translation of the text:

Suddenly, Zhao Xu's foot slipped, and he realized it wasn't the inclined road he thought it was, but a flat road. He felt a momentary lapse, and only then did he realize he had finished a long uphill road and had arrived at the intersection, straight ahead of which was his dormitory. On the other side was a bustling commercial street. Zhao Xu suddenly felt a rumbling in his stomach and walked towards a milk tea shop to get a hot dog to eat.

"Did you hear that? Last night, the group of people from the electrical engineering department went on a night march and had a clash with the mine owners," someone said.

"What's going on? How could they dare to march at midnight without fear of encountering some monster that could wipe them out?" another person asked.

"There's no exaggeration, but it's true that the mine owners did besiege themselves in their own stronghold, waiting quietly for us players to come and then counterattack one by one. As far as I know, the group that arrived at noon was the best, but most of them are basically dead now," someone replied.

"How did this happen? Those rustic mine owners are so powerful?"

Just then, a classmate of Zhao Xu's, who was around the same age, asked, his mouth agape, and even the soda can in his hand fell out of his hand without him noticing.

"It's mainly because we're too scattered and disorganized, and can't match the enemy's formation," another classmate said, looking a bit disheartened.

Zhao Xu, who had been listening to the conversation, didn't find it strange and took a sip of his milk tea as he walked towards his dormitory.

At this time, Zhao Xu saw that the grilled bread and fruit had come out to set up stalls on the road. He took out his wallet to buy one, but accidentally pulled out his keychain along with it.

The keychain fell freely and quickly, too fast to chase after.
Here is the translation of the text:

In an instant, Zhao Xu didn't even have time to react himself.

He had already noticed that the key had fallen to the ground, just a few inches away from him, and he had grabbed it.

It was as if he had just unleashed a burst of speed, and then slowly reached out to grab the key.

Zhao Xu stood up with a hint of puzzlement.

He was absolutely certain.

One hundred percent certain that no player from the previous life could bring their in-game abilities to the real world.

Otherwise, the official forces from the previous life wouldn't have been caught off guard in this new world.

Even the richest and most powerful elite wouldn't have played the game.

Logically speaking, if someone had really proven that Arthur's abilities could be brought to the Earth world, the wealthy and powerful elite would definitely have taken the initiative to prepare beforehand.

At this moment, Zhao Xu also thought of his wife from his previous life, and couldn't help but sigh.

The other party was someone who was accustomed to a top-tier lifestyle, with a huge gap in habits and hobbies between them and ordinary people like Zhao Xu.

Without the crossing, it was unlikely that Zhao Xu would have even been able to interact with the other party.

Even their identities and statuses had been flipped upside down.

In the end, it was still impossible to replicate things like electricity, diodes, and internal combustion engines in the other world.

A legion of hundreds or even thousands of ordinary people might not be able to compare to a necromancer's undead army summoned at will.

At this moment, Zhao Xu looked at the key in his hand, put it back in his pocket, and walked away without looking back towards the dormitory.

By now, he had already made up his mind that even if he had mastered magic on Earth, it would ultimately be like chasing after a mirage.
Here is the translation:

His future is still in Azeroth's strength.

...After returning to Azeroth, Zhao Xu quickly prepared his spells and continued to activate "Unbridled Heroic Spirit" to gain potential points.

Then, he used the potential points to restore "Frequency of Dispersion" and went wild with "Sacred Super Magic (Spell Endurance)" to equip himself with beneficial spells for close combat.

After completing all this, Zhao Xu directly took off his giant scythe and held it in his hand, and the battle had already begun. He would go to the front line, and naturally, he would start slaughtering wildly.

Although Zhao Xu was sitting in the dormitory of the academy, he could still hear the noise of external players.

It was just like the countless posts on the forum, where people were discussing the evil mine captain of "Star Lake" and inviting people to join the discussion. Regardless of the writing style, the topic had garnered a large number of clicks and attention after a day of fermentation.

When he walked out, he found that some players who had died in "Star Lake" were shouting slogans, leading the remaining players to Star Lake.

The entire Winter City seemed to be infected by this excited atmosphere.

Zhao Xu didn't pay too much attention and directly used the "Miracle Spell" to simulate the "High-Level Teleportation" and went to the front line of Star Lake.
