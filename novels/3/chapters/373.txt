Chapter 374: The Road Home

It wasn't until the second day that Zhao Xu formally absorbed the energy of "Super Magic Storm" and his mind was still a bit hazy.

He had only received one piece of information: that Anzhenia and Madam May were preparing for the return of "Ernest".

He even obtained a stunning piece of news: Anzhenia was the "heir" of the opposite party.

So, the legendary King of Ofa, Ernest, was not only his mentor, but also the founder of the wizarding world.

This lineage was long-standing and rich in history.
It was no wonder that everyone called her "Big Sister".
However, Zhao Xu was still perplexed.

After the fall of the first-generation magic goddess, Anzhenia, with her identity and status, was a powerful rival to the second-generation magic goddess.
She was a legendary wizard during the era of the first-generation magic goddess.
This background was hidden in the wizarding association, and even the association's main leaders couldn't find a clue.

Thinking about this, Zhao Xu was very curious about the event that forced Ernest to leave the world, which led to the collapse of the initial magic empire.

However, after some thought, Zhao Xu still took off his brain dome helmet, got out of bed, and went to brush his teeth and wash his face.

His dormitory classmates had all bought tickets to go back home for the New Year.
Zhao Xu was in the critical stage of breaking through the 6th level, and he didn't have much time to spare, so he postponed his exams and stayed for a few more days before going back home.
After everything was officially settled, he could finally set off for home. At this moment, Zhao Xu was looking at the empty dorm room, and he couldn't help but nostalgically recall his parents. He had only occasionally called home and chatted with his parents, and hadn't told them much about his gaming activities. Thankfully, he had a sudden burst of intelligence, and his final exam results were basically all high scores, directly shattering countless people's expectations. Even Zhang Qi suspected that he must have secretly studied by playing games.

After taking out the pre-packed luggage from the closet, Zhao Xu directly pulled it down the stairs, and then reported to the dorm administrator to cut off the power. This time, Zhao Xu was going home for the Chinese New Year, so he had brought an aluminum alloy luggage, which was not full, only containing a few pieces of clothing, for convenience when returning to school.

In the first semester of his freshman year, everyone used the "stepping on a bucket" washing method for half a month, but eventually had to admit defeat and buy a washing machine, which also allowed Zhao Xu to bid farewell to his accumulated pile of unwashable clothes.

The main gate of the school was just a subway station, and Zhao Xu had bought a high-speed rail ticket for noon. Although he had to transfer trains, the time was still early. At this moment, he saw that the girl's dormitory across the door had parked a local plate A6, and his classmate, Cui Lu, was walking ahead, holding the hands of her parents.

Cui Lu's father, a middle-aged man, was well-educated and had a gentle smile, and was helping Cui Lu carry a luggage, about to put it in the trunk of the car.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu, a solo traveler, smiled at Liu Lu and did not approach her, but instead continued to push his luggage cart with wheels and move forward, heading towards his future.

In his previous life, Zhao Xu had met Liu Lu's father when he was still a high-ranking official, but later he had fallen and became an ordinary person. He had still tried to integrate into the society of King Arthur.

However, due to his slightly higher attributes and large age difference, he only managed to become a 1st-level bard, a relatively ordinary position.

"Is this your classmate?" Liu Lu's father, who had been immersed in his work for many years, immediately noticed the unusual glance between them.

"Yeah," Liu Lu replied with a smile.

"Hey, why is your classmate in such a hurry? Shouldn't we call him over to eat with us?" Liu Lu's father asked curiously.

"Get lost," Liu Lu's mother replied gruffly, elbowing her husband.

"Laozi, stop joking," Liu Lu's father quickly apologized.

"I'm warning you, the investigation is very strict now, and all queries will be recorded. Don't go back and ask about that young man's and Liu Lu's personal life. It's not good for the person who helps you with the investigation," Liu Lu's mother warned.

"Besides, this kind of thing is quite common among young people these days. You should also give your daughter some privacy," Liu Lu's mother said seriously.

"Mom, I haven't done anything like that," Liu Lu corrected her mother's joke, blushing.

...

After verifying his ID card, Zhao Xu directly passed through the facial recognition gate and took his seat in the first-class carriage. On the opposite side, a couple was already sitting together, holding hands and gazing lovingly at each other.
Here is the translation of the text:

The person sitting by the window also looks like a student, but the other person is dressed more maturely.

After putting his luggage in the overhead compartment, Zhao Xu sat down, closed his eyes, and took a break, having spent the previous night absorbing the energy of the Super Mage Storm through meditation.

The sudden news he heard had still been affecting his mind for a long time.

Zhao Xu's journey home was not long, and he arrived around the evening. The three people sitting next to him were mostly strangers who had gotten on at the previous station, of similar ages, and had already chatted for a while.

"Hey, brother, I'll pass you by on the way back and bring you along," said the fashionable man. "We've got a team of 2-level players and are preparing to go out of town to hunt powerful monsters."

As he spoke, the man shared some of his simple experiences of hunting monsters with the others.

At first, Zhao Xu didn't think much of it, but it just so happened that the three people sitting next to him were all Arthur players.

Or, to put it, the heat of Arthur wasn't low at the moment, and it wasn't surprising to encounter one or two players. It was just a coincidence that the three people sitting next to him were all playing Arthur.

However, the survival situation of players was still quite grueling, and death was a common occurrence, even for level 3 or 4 accounts. Few people could survive.

Zhao Xu was looking out the window at the retreating mountains, which seemed to be confirming the difference between two worlds.

"Hey, friend, do you play Arthur?" asked the man sitting next to him, looking at Zhao Xu, who had been silent since getting on the bus, as if he were a passenger.

Zhao Xu's thoughts were suddenly interrupted, and he looked at the fashionable man with a puzzled expression, nodding slightly. "Yes, I do."
Here is the translation of the text:

The man's eyes lit up as he exclaimed, "You're so high-level, even though we're not from the same town, it's just coincidental!" The man's enthusiasm was palpable as he began to brag about his high-level friend, as if the question about Zhao Xu's level had suddenly lost its importance.

However, the couple couldn't help but be curious, and asked, "Hey, friend, where are you from in Arthur?"

Zhao Xu thought for a moment before speaking up, "North Alliance, Starfall Town. I'm heading there right now."

Just then, the man beside him couldn't help but shout out, "That's the old cow town? The first player-owned city? I've heard that the first wave of players who entered the city received a set of refined equipment. That's a 300-gold start!"

"I'll give them a concert and dance performance for once, and exchange it for Arthur's gold coins. But this game's gold is too valuable. My friend said that many studios want to come in and make a fortune by farming gold, but they never find a way in."

As they continued to chat, the conversation eventually turned to their complaints about the troublesome monsters they had encountered.

Especially the man who had been boasting earlier, who had a task that required a special part of a monster's body, but had been stuck for almost half a month.

Their questions were too obscure, and even inquiries on the forum received no responses.

Arthur's complexity made it difficult to solve many problems, and without years of in-game experience, it was impossible to know where to start.

Zhao Xu remained silent throughout, only speaking up when he got off the bus. Before leaving, he handed over the two handwritten notes he had just written to the others.
Here is the translation:

There were some strange men who looked at the notes on the solution, their eyes were deeply drawn in, almost unable to tear themselves away. The notes on the paper were mostly in Chinese, with only a few key parts written in a universal language, as if to avoid misinterpretation.

The men couldn't help but take a photo of the note and post it on the forum with the title "Who is the great saint Arthur I met?"...

After three or four months of psychological preparation, Zhao Xiu saw his parents again, and his expression had returned to normal.

Because he knew that the next time he saw his parents, everything would be different after seven years.

The only thing that puzzled Zhao Xiu was that a girl was lying on his bed, wearing pajamas and holding a cookie in her mouth, flipping through a textbook.

"What are you doing on my bed?" Zhao Xiu asked.

He used this normal conversation to calm himself down.

"You're a cheapskate," the girl glanced at Zhao Xiu and didn't bother to respond.

At this moment, Zhao's mother walked into the room, "Your father has a lump and needs surgery soon. Your mother has been busy taking care of him in the hospital lately."

"It's almost time for the high school entrance exam, so she's very nervous. So she asked us to let her stay with us for a while," Zhao's mother said hurriedly.

At this moment, Zhao Xiu sat silently in his old chair, and the desk was already cluttered with the girl's high school accessories.

Zhao's mother looked at her son, knowing that agreeing to his old friend's request would not cause any problems, and she went happily to the kitchen to cut melon for them to eat.

Zhao Xiu sat in his swivel chair, turned around and looked at the girl who was pretending to read a book in front of him.

"How many years are you in?"
Here is the translation of the text to English:

The girl who had grown up together with Zhao Xu, like a small cat whose fur has stood on end, couldn't help but turn her head back to look at Zhao Xu, saying "I didn't play Arthur."

But she soon realized she had let the cat out of the bag and rolled her tongue nervously, asking "How did you know?"

Zhao Xu just gave a cold smile.

Yes, he knew.

He also knew that the girl in front of him, at the beginning of the time travel, in an era where countless lives were drifting aimlessly without a foothold, had sacrificed herself to save her classmates, and died in the hands of a monster.

When they arrived at the scene, all they could do was watch as the mother of Xiao Wei was crying bitterly, holding her pale corpse.
