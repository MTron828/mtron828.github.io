Chapter 277: Divine Heritage

As soon as he heard the "Elegy", the entire army of undead warriors that filled the corridor suddenly surged forward, with many jumping over the undead warriors blocking the way and forcing their way through. The corridor had become a massive battleground, as if a torrent of divine energy was about to engulf everything behind them.

Zhao Xu couldn't help but turn around to look back at the path he had taken, but there was nothing to see. The area had become desolate after the "Shadow Departure" of the immortal being.

As he looked ahead, the originally high ceiling of the corridor had been crowded to the point of being suffocating by the undead warriors. Zhao Xu saw this sight and jumped down from the wall, his boots splashing into an unknown "pond". However, he didn't have time to think about it, as his attention was fully focused on the undead warriors ahead.

"Master, shall we follow?" La'kis suggested.

"Yes," Zhao Xu replied, immediately taking a few quick strides to catch up to the rear of the undead warriors, only about 10 meters behind.

The undead warriors lagging behind were stuck to the ones ahead, unable to squeeze through.

Zhao Xu continued to walk for nearly 10 minutes before he saw a glimmer of light ahead, indicating that the terminal tunnel was about to appear.

The distance he had followed had allowed him to estimate that this corridor was likely over a thousand meters long. The number of undead warriors was likely in the tens of thousands.

As for the undead warriors that had just marched through this corridor and onto the "Star Lake" battlefield, it was unclear whether the players could win or not.

Zhao Xu followed closely until he finally caught a whiff of fresh air, which made his nose feel a bit better.

As the number of reanimated corpses decreased, the entrance to the cave, which was originally blocked by a dense cluster of them, began to allow in some outside light.

At this point, Zhao Xu reached the end of the corridor and found that the road ahead was blocked.

He looked out, taking in the vast, empty landscape before him, with a sprawling underground city stretching out as far as the eye could see. The city was dotted with ancient buildings that were hundreds of years old, with many of them showing signs of wear and tear. The exterior walls of some buildings were covered in dirt, revealing the rough, earthy material beneath.

As Zhao Xu gazed out at the scene, he could still feel the grandeur of the place, as if he had witnessed a piece of history. The only thing missing was the scent of human life.

Zhao Xu's current location was on the edge of a precipice, with a narrow path carved out of the cliff face. The reanimated corpses that had emerged were sliding down the near-vertical slope, or tumbling down.

Zhao Xu cautiously poked his head out to look around, and discovered that this cliff face was not just a single cave entrance, but had at least a dozen similar entrances, each spewing out hordes of undead creatures, including zombies, skeletons, mummies, and reanimated corpses, all racing towards the city below.

However, the sky above still echoed with the mournful wails of the departed, the sounds coming from the gray-white void above, directly penetrating every person's heart.
Here is the translation of the text:

"This is the ancient 'Land of the Sleeping' mausoleum, where it was once cut off from the main material plane and turned into a floating half-plane. Who would have thought that it would merge with the 'Carrion Beast's Den' half-plane? Lark says in amazement.

The Land of the Sleeping? Zhao Xu's religious, historical, and local knowledge suddenly connected to retrieve a segment of content.

The Land of the Sleeping is a legendary realm where immortal beings dwell. It was once the experiment site of the God of Death, where even the bravest warriors wouldn't dare to tread.

Zhao Xu soon realizes why there are tens of thousands of reanimated corpses crowded in the corridor. He has arrived in a town where all the residents are immortal beings.

However, Zhao Xu is still pondering the reason.

The mausoleum appeared in the half-plane of the God of Death, but the association's wizards didn't tell him.

This incident just occurred in recent days, which means it was orchestrated by the artificial God of Death.

What was the purpose of this plan? Was it to gain a deeper understanding of the God of Death's powers?

Feeling the crisis intensifying, Zhao Xu crouched lower, no longer concerned about the lingering stench in the corridor.

"Lark, you helped the artificial God of Death earlier, allowing it to break free from the ritual of the God of Death's priests. Now that it has broken free, why does it need to wait for me to enter the underground temple to depart and then suddenly enter this half-plane to obtain the God of Death's powers?" Zhao Xu asked.

"It still lacks something," Lark explained cautiously. "In fact, it has been waiting for the day of the divine war to come. At that time, it will take action, and the numerous forces of the gods and King Arthur's numerous half-planes will be too busy to pay attention."

"However, the master's entry into the underground temple has also attracted the attention of the wizard association and the goddess temple, so it naturally cannot hide anymore."
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu heard this and couldn't help but sigh, realizing that it was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to create chaos, but it was unexpectedly interrupted.

"'Lord, if we can obtain divine power, it's not just a matter of thousands of years, but even tens of thousands of years,' Lacis seemed to have seen too many cases of divine power struggles. 'Even if the Mage Association predicts that there is divine power here, they will still be patient and slowly infiltrate the work.'"

"'Even this time, the artificial death god entered, they are just as calm, just like a legendary mage waiting for orders. Because time and patience will let them defeat all enemies, even if this artificial death god didn't respond well, it's just for the Mage Association to cultivate an opportunity for someone to become a god.'"

"'So, merging this "Land of the Slumber" is the artificial death god's countermeasure.'"

Suddenly, the "Song of the Departed" in the sky resonated more and more throughout the universe, so much so that it stirred Zhao Xu's thoughts, and he began to immerse himself in this melancholic atmosphere.

Meanwhile, the countless undead creatures wandering aimlessly in the "Land of the Slumber" were also kneeling in one direction.

The fear that originated from a higher level of natural instinct made these even mindless skeletons follow suit, remaining motionless and not daring to move.

At this point, Zhao Xu was still wondering what was happening, but the corner of his eye suddenly reminded him of the source of this unusual phenomenon.

On the edge of the pale sky, a coffin floating in mid-air slowly flew by, with countless silver chains stretching out to connect to another flying creature.

Twenty-four enormous flying creatures, each chained to the coffin by a chain, were hovering in the sky, accepting the homage of countless undead creatures.
Here is the translation:

These winged creatures resembled enormous bats, with wings spread wide enough to exceed ten meters in width. They were shrouded in darkness, with their entire bodies enveloped in shadows. Around the stone coffin, there were over ten clusters of dark energy masses that looked like black human figures. However, these creatures did not support the golden sarcophagus, but instead hovered around it, flying slowly and clumsily.

Zhao Xu then noticed that one of the bat-like flying creatures had a mummy sitting on its back.

At that moment, Zhao Xu couldn't help but feel a sense of despair and dread, and his heart was filled with fear. The fear was so intense that it paralyzed his entire body.

【Adventurer, you are affected by the "Despair" effect and enter a "Paralyzed" state due to fear, lasting for 3 rounds (1D4 rounds).】

Zhao Xu was completely immobile, frozen in a state of paralysis.

The giant dragon had flown overhead, swooping down at their team and inflicting a "Fright" status on them.

It was also Zhao Xu who had just taken a glance at a distance of several hundred meters and was directly affected by the "Paralyzed" state.

"Lady, that's a half-divine mummy," said Lakshmi, her tone becoming increasingly serious. "The opponent's 'Despair' effect has a difficulty of 48, and anyone who sees it must make a saving throw to resist."

Lakshmi's expression became grave, even more so than when she faced the legendary "Deep Furnace of the Damned" challenge.

"Ordinary mummies are formed when humans die," she explained.
Here is the translation:

"But the half-god mummies represent their former dignities as half-gods," Lark said.

"Next to the casket of amber is the immortal being 'Night Shadow', composed of equal amounts of darkness and pure evil. The chained bat-like Night Shadow, level 14, is a formidable immortal being. The humanoid Night Shadow guarding the perimeter is level 16, the 'Night Shadow of Folding'."

Just then, Zhao Xiu noticed that behind the casket of amber, more immortal beings emerged from thin air, all following the coffin.

But Zhao Xiu's gaze immediately locked onto a large immortal being, his eyes widening in puzzlement at its infant-like appearance.

"That is the Abomination, the stillborn child of the gods - the Withered One," Lark noticed Zhao Xiu's gaze and supplemented the introduction.

However, she was even more cautious about this existence.

"The Withered One will kill all life in the area. In fact, many immortal nations are controlled by the Withered One. The master of this 'Land of the Slumber' is it, but I didn't expect it to still exist."

"Be extremely cautious, Master. Whether it's the Abomination, the Withered One, or the half-god mummies, they are all legendary beings and may possess divine powers."

Zhao Xiu saw this scene and knew it was the most perilous moment since entering the game. He restrained his trembling body and retreated a few steps, as if the darkness behind him could protect him better.

"What's inside the casket of amber that they're escorting?" Zhao Xiu asked.

"Yes, it's the divine attribute of Death. Our target this time," Lark said, as if she had caught her prey, speaking lightly and happily.
