Chapter 482: Born Ordinary

It was half past midnight on Earth.

Zhao Xu had originally planned to sleep in the game, but he was woken up by a sudden urge to urinate due to drinking too much at dinner.

He rubbed his eyes, put on a pair of shorts, and walked out of the room, heading towards the bathroom a short distance away.

As he passed the washbasin, he caught a glimpse of himself in the mirror and couldn't help but shudder at the sight of the dark shadow behind him.

When he looked again, the strange phenomenon had disappeared.

It was just him alone in the mirror.

"Almost died," Zhao Xu said, his voice shaking.

He turned on the bathroom light, but instead of taking a step forward, he just stared straight at the mirror in front of him, his eyes locked in a stare.

He stood there for a long time, with no unusual occurrences.

Finally, Zhao Xu let out a sigh of relief and sat back down on the toilet, thinking to himself that the dark shadow he saw might be the projection of the "Grave God's Fragment".

According to his memories, the Grave God Nal had once taken the form of a black mist that was difficult to shape.

This was why many sculptors of god statues were troubled by this style, and as a result, few such statues existed.

Zhao Xu took his phone out of his pocket and pressed his finger against the screen to unlock it.

At this moment, the screen was still black and hadn't started up yet.

Under the soft white light of the bathroom lamp, he looked at the dark shadow behind him again.
Here is the translation of the text:

It seemed like a personification of death, surrounding him with an aura of death. Suddenly, the screen in front of him flickered back to life, and Zhao Xu closed the page, only to see the black shadow disappear again. Zhao Xu's heart was racing, and he hastily opened the camera app on his phone and took a selfie.

The selfie showed Zhao Xu with a hazy expression, his eyes half-open, and a faint stubble on his chin. He lightly pressed the camera button and saved the photo.

Zhao Xu saw it twice and was almost certain. The divine power was indeed transmitted from the "material-energy channel" that traversed two worlds and had been projected onto his body.

Did this mean that if a player could complete the legendary feat of becoming an immortal in the next four months, they could actually display "divine power" on Earth as well?

Zhao Xu let out a soft sigh. He chuckled to himself, wondering what he was thinking. Was it necessary to become a god?

As long as he reached the legendary level, he might even have the ability to teleport back to Earth.

In the past, every time he had touched divine power, his attributes had taken shape. Suddenly, Zhao Xu hesitated as he held his phone.

He gazed at the moonlight filtering through the latticework window, which was unusually clear and serene, especially given that it was almost the Lantern Festival. However, compared to King Arthur's moon, which was a pure white disk, this moon seemed more captivating.

If a player had touched the power of the abyss or hell, wouldn't they also be able to sense some anomalies beforehand, just like Zhao Xu?

Or was it like him, seeing some sort of ghostly shadow in the mirror?
Here is the translation of the text to English:

Thinking about this, Zhao Xu also didn't bother to continue his own affairs. He directly opened the forum to search for hallucinations and illusions.

As expected, there were about five or six posts mentioning it, but it was difficult to determine whether the opponent was real due to supernatural power or just a simple hallucination caused by mental illness.

Especially, the content of these posts was extremely rare, and Zhao Xu couldn't even match them.

Moreover, most of these posts were single posts with no subsequent replies.

Zhao Xu was almost certain that there were players who knew about "the Earth crossing" in the game.

However, it was another matter that these players didn't believe it.

At this time, he glanced at the forum's hot topics and found that the event he had just destroyed the Scarlet Lips' fiery passion, which had surprisingly become the top headline.

When did the Northern Alliance have such a strong reputation? A brothel being smashed could attract such attention?

It was unthinkable that players couldn't do such bad things, and almost no one went to this place.

When encountering evil points in the local area, even the Arthurians would be ridiculed and scolded.

It was absolutely bizarre.

Zhao Xu immediately entered the post to investigate the entire incident.

"What's going on?"

He suddenly widened his eyes.

"Zhong Xia" with two large, bold, and red characters lay at the beginning of the post.

Detective player?

The entire official investigation of the city of Oulu had not concluded, but players could be certain that he did it?

This "frame-up" was too excessive!

Zhao Xu was about to have a brain hemorrhage, as if he had seen his own re-login, with an entire team of guards waiting outside.
Here is the translation:

It's really like that, and he has to gamble that the other side hasn't forgotten to lock the dimensional lock and send it.

With curiosity and incredulity, Zhao Xu directly scanned the post that pointed out that "Zhong Xia" was the mastermind behind the destruction of "Lianhuang Hongchun".

He scrolled down to the bottom of the post.

Zhao Xu looked at the online forum with a face full of expressionless eyes.

In this day and age, it's really happening that a blind cat meets a dead mouse. Everything has its source, and it's really happening that some players bet on "Zhong Xia" entering the city today. With his abilities, he will definitely stir up the winds of the entire Oulu City.

As expected, last night, the city of Oulu was destroyed by someone, and the largest brothel in the city was destroyed.

As a result, the players naturally gathered to celebrate the "First Person Zhong Xia" and his bravery.

Of course, wherever he went, he was accompanied by sparks and lightning.

Zhao Xu couldn't help but let out a few sarcastic words, but he still had a few moments of calm.

He really thought he had found some key evidence.

The chaotic camp wants to do as they please in this world, and the key is whether they have been caught with their pants down.

Many players have been caught by the city guards after a brief truce and are now singing "Iron Window Tears".

At this time, Zhao Xu looked at the screenshot of the post's mastermind and found that it was a group of people who were arguing in the group.

He didn't even need to guess to distinguish these people, who had been labeled as "thinly coded" in their avatars, from those in his own academy gaming group.

Unexpectedly, they had managed to get on the hot list in this way.

After understanding that this had no major consequences, Zhao Xu couldn't help but open the group, only to find that Wang Qingwei was also online, with his avatar lit up.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

If Arthur from the previous life knew that the Earth would be traversed, who would know?

Wang Congwei is absolutely the top candidate.

If she didn't know, then no player would know.

However, Zhao Xu was uncertain about when the other party knew.

He took a deep breath, and directly sent a link to a post on the forum that Dong Cheng had posted before, titled "If you find yourself as a civilian who has traversed to Arthur, what would you do tomorrow?"

Most people who can chat online are like opening their hearts and lungs.

Many are lonely souls.

However, at this moment, Zhao Xu is experiencing a different kind of loneliness.

【Congwei: ?】
【Zhong Xia: I think this post is quite interesting. What if it's true?】
【Congwei: I've thought about it before, but it's unlikely to be true, right?】

At this moment, on the other side of the network.

A girl wearing a blue and white striped pajamas and a rabbit headband, hiding under the blanket, couldn't help but think countless thoughts as she saw her usual online friend asking a question.

Her friend list and numerous group chats were pushed aside.

【Congwei: But if it's true, it would be a disaster for many people.】
【Zhong Xia: Congwei, when I see you thinking like that, I think you're more suitable to be a pastor or saint knight.】

Traversing the forum, most people's replies are interesting.

Or rather, for these players who are destined to win, it's indeed a fun thing.
Here is the translation of the text:

However, for other Earthlings, if they have just gone through a situation where everything is in a mess, and if they were already living at a low standard of living, they will continue to live like that.

But definitely, there are over 3 billion people who will live a more miserable life than before.

【Kong Wei: Hehe, it's mainly because they're not strong enough, the priest is feeling well, but I prefer the wizard.】
【Zhong Xia: How do you know?】
【Kong Wei: Intuition.】
It's a truly sharp and fearless girl.

Zhao Xu couldn't help but show respect when he saw this scene.

【Zhong Xia: By the way, do you know any priest scholars?】
【Kong Wei: Hmph, I just finished answering the question and both the priest and wizard statues were lit up. At that time, the guide took me to the job "Priest Scholar", but I refused, I want to be a wizard.】
【Zhong Xia: It seems that the distance between us and the genius is still so clear.】
【Kong Wei: Ah, it doesn't matter. Anyway, let's go back to the topic you just brought up.】

【Kong Wei: It's possible that the Earth itself is about to be destroyed. Then, a meteor shower will fall from the sky, and we will be transported to Avalon.】
【Kong Wei: If such a situation of struggling to survive occurs, there's no need to be disappointed. Let's work together to face the new life.】

At this moment, Zhao Xu was holding his phone and saw the "meteor shower" mentioned by Kong Wei.

It's as if he wrote "I know the inside story" on his face.

It seems that he also needs to reveal some inside information to the other party.

He immediately sent a photo of himself taken just now.

【Kong Wei: Hehe, it turns out that Zhong Xia looks like this. Although your face value is above average, considering the background, is there a need for this kind of requirement in the heart?】
Here is the translation:

【 Qingwei: If you insist on talking about this, I suggest you open up to me about your inner thoughts. I've also studied this area and can offer some psychological counseling. However, if you really have a tendency to act impulsively, it's better to take a step back.】

【 Qingwei: I'm still a woman, and I'll still feel shy when I see something like this.】

Zhao Xu was taken aback by this response and didn't know whether he was dreaming or whether he was excited because Qingwei was also knowledgeable about the matter. He had just wanted to ask Qingwei if she had also experienced something similar to what he had just seen, "the mysterious black shadow".

Unbeknownst to him, he had just sent a photo of himself squatting, although it was just an upper body shot. However, the background of the toilet storage tank was clear. This was a serious case of sexual harassment.

Zhao Xu quickly clicked on the "undo" button and revised the message.

【 Zhongxia: Tremble, tremble.】

【 Qingwei: Hehe, it's saved.】

【 Qingwei: Internet police warning: the internet is not a lawless land (image)】

【 Zhongxia: ...】

As he looked at the photo Qingwei had sent, he found it to be as pure as an evening sunset, with no difference from her in-game avatar.

【 Qingwei: Remember to treat me to dinner if you meet me on the street. If not, I'll tell Aisvi to make you regret it for the rest of your life.】

【 Zhongxia: ...】

【 Zhongxia: Shall we gather in real life in June?】

It was the perfect time to start reconnecting with people before he crossed over.
