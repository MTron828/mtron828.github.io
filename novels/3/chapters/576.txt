Chapter 577: The Return of the Disobedient Sect

After Zhao Xu finished speaking, the dozen or so high school students standing beside him looked puzzled, and one of them, a frail-looking girl wizard, raised her hand to ask, "Mr. Zhong, are you using the binding spell just now?"

"No mistake," Zhao Xu replied with a smile, happy to clarify the doubts of the young wizards.

However, the frail girl looked puzzled and drew attention from the others, indicating that there must be more to it.

"What's going on?" South Xiaoyu couldn't help but wonder, looking at her friend.

Zhao Xu couldn't help but lecture South Xiaoyu, saying, "As a pastor with expertise in religious knowledge, you should at least know that undead creatures occupy about one-tenth of the content in religious knowledge. Think about it."

South Xiaoyu only then flexed her fingers, saying, "Don't undead creatures refer to things like immunity to heavy blows, ability to absorb skills, property absorption, toxins, sleep, intimidation, and diseases?"

"Actually, there's one more thing," said the timid-looking girl wizard standing behind her, "the psychological coercion effect. The five-ring monster binding spell is actually a psychological coercion effect."

It's easy to kill an undead creature, but controlling one is much harder.

Because they are immune.

Everyone's attention suddenly turned to Zhao Xu, and his impression became even more mysterious.

The rules of Arthur, which could break the rules of the gods, were said to be immune.

"Mainly, I used a necromantic spell, not a controlling spell. The three-ring necromantic binding spell can take effect on undead creatures," Zhao Xu explained.

Just like he had used a tombstone to command an undead creature, "Wow!" "It looks like a three-ring spell has taken down an 18-level monster!" "Is this a wizard?" Instantly, these young men and women began to whisper to each other. Because three-ring spells were already beyond their reach.

At this moment, Zhao Xu used a three-ring spell to paralyze a giant worm with a challenge level of 18, just like using a divine strike to kill a Porsche 911. It was almost impossible to achieve.

Instantly, countless amazed and admiring gazes surrounded Zhao Xu. However, Zhao Xu, who was accustomed to this, remained silent, thinking to himself that there was nothing to be excited about. After all, the process had been simulated by consuming potential points to upgrade the spell and increase the difficulty of evasion.

However, when he saw the eager eyes of the young men, Zhao Xu thought for a moment and then explained, "I can control it with a three-ring spell because my evasion difficulty exceeds your imagination and exceeds its limit. In fact, I can use another three-ring spell to knock it down."

"By the way, my fireball is not the same as yours," Zhao Xu said. "Don't have such illusions."

"In the challenge level system of monsters, as the level rises, the various static data of the monster will increase, making it difficult to defeat the opponent with evasion difficulty. That's to say, these monsters all have spell resistance."

"What should we do?" the students standing below asked eagerly.

Anyone knew that this opportunity was hard to come by, and they were also borrowing the light of Nan Xiuxi to have this chance to get close to the current number one player, Xia Xia.
Here is the translation of the text:

From a purely weak-to-strong perspective, if you don't care about the diversity of spells, you can take a specialized path, focusing on a few powerful spells and combining them with a chain of expertise to achieve a one-hit-kill effect.

As for the so-called "non-transmission of six ears", this is not a high school classroom, and sensitive students already know what Zhao Xu is talking about after he raises the topic.

The truth is often just a couple of sentences, and the rest is left to the individual's fortune and destiny.

However, unexpectedly, Zhao Xu continued without hesitation, saying, "For example, a mage who specializes in pursuing the upper limit of damage, using spells like the 'XX Ball' created by the 'Curse Creation' system, combined with 'Secret Paper', 'Super Magic', 'Instant Super Magic', and 'Super Magic Wand' techniques, and then adding 'Energy Replacement', 'Energy Mixing', 'Spell Efficiency', 'Spell Strength', and 'Spell Twin' to increase damage. This can have a decisive effect."

Indeed, there are people who can cast spells with the ability to manipulate the air.

However, it's just a few times.

Other players don't have the same "Super Magic Control" ability as Zhao Xu, such as combining "Spell Endurance" and "Spell Efficiency" to increase the level of the spell by 10 rings, or relying on 3rd-level abilities to reduce the level of a spell by 1 ring, which still costs 9 rings.

Therefore, ordinary mages need to use "Secret Paper" to reduce the level of a specific spell by 1 ring, and "Super Magic Specialization" to reduce the level of a specific super spell by 1 ring.

The remaining options include using specific "Super Magic Wands" for a total of three times a day, and "Instant Super Magic" can activate a specific super spell once a day.

So, if someone wants to achieve Zhao Xu's effect, they need to use a long chain of expertise to cover it.

Then, they may only have one to three times a day to deliver their strongest blow, and throughout their long careers, they will rely on such a spell to survive.

Currently, Zhao Xu's level is not necessarily higher than that of a specialized mage who has undergone unique transformation. However, Zhao Xu's true strength lies in the fact that he can simulate the level of most special mages, with the exception of a few. Moreover, he also masters the entire spell table and arbitrary spellcasting methods.

Many top players believe that Zhao Xu is only one or two levels behind them. In reality, Zhao Xu is actually several levels ahead of the entire mage team.

When building a character, most players aim for either "specialization" or "comprehensive" development. For mages, their larger role in the team is to provide sufficient spells to adapt to different situations, and they are also one of the few professions that can perform "scene control".

At its core, a mage is a "comprehensive" profession. While they can excel in various aspects such as "physical attack", "spell output", "scene control", "skill system", "summoning", and "healing recovery", they may not reach the top level in both "skill" and "healing" aspects.

It's just that the foundation is solid enough, and with effort, it can be mined and harvested. In other areas, as long as they invest in "specialization", "profession level", and "equipment" resources, they can optimize to the extreme.

For example, the cannon mage exemplified by Zhao Xu is an extreme example of spell output. This naturally sacrifices other dimensions of ability.

It is Zhao Xu, a person with a greedy heart, who has achieved "comprehensive" mastery in every aspect.

As for the profession of a knight, it is the most top-level selection for both "skill" and "healing".

As long as you invest resources, the key issue lies in the insufficient length of his teammates' HP, which will not lead to a situation that cannot be recovered from.

After Zhao Xū finished speaking, although the things he mentioned were unclear to everyone, even many experts had not experienced it, and yet people still remembered it in their hearts.

In the following period, these high school students who had survived would each take their weapons and face the giant night demon individually, while Zhao Xū continuously maintained his "stabilization technique".

This allowed everyone to experience firsthand what it means to be "not strong enough to be of use".

In the past, Arther was a simulation game where players did not have the shadow of death looming over them, and it felt completely different.

Only by truly experiencing the game, seeing the massive monster's breath and the threat of death, could one deeply understand that "hunting monsters" also requires courage.

In the real world, there are few who do not faint from blood loss. Those who can enhance their mental quality and continue to fight after being injured are rare.

However, in addition to attribute enhancements, players also truly projected the three major evasion abilities of "tenacity", "reflexes", and "willpower".

Therefore, the girl with high willpower, who seemed weak, was actually the most steadfast in the scene.

However, accompanied by the "ding-ding-dong" sound of swords and axes, all of this was futile.

Some players even used heavy crossbows to shoot or barbarian players directly used their strongest stance to swing their giant axes.

However, their efforts were in vain, and some high school students who were not adapted to the post-crossover world directly dropped their weapons, looking embarrassed.
Even players who are not proficient in military weapons dared to try their luck, and naturally, they ended up being clumsy and almost injuring themselves. In the end, everyone took a step back, gazing at the central area, where Zhao Xu stood calmly. The middle-aged people who had been hiding in the corners also poked their heads out, watching the scene unfold.

Just as Zhong Xiaofang had just unsheathed his sword, he had already torn open the giant Night Shadow's belly. However, the opponent was now standing still, leaving no trace behind. Its enormous size was indeed a disadvantage in terms of defense. It was impossible to move, and that was another disadvantage. Yet, none of these disadvantages could bring about any progress for the crowd, just like trying to take a treasure that was out of reach.

Zhao Xu smiled and said, "This Night Shadow is born with a natural defense of over 29 levels. With your current level, unless you have a light-based weapon that ignores defense, even the +5 sword worth 20,000 gold coins would be unable to defeat it." He then raised his hand, ready to lower the monster's defense and dissect it for the crowd.

Suddenly, the middle-aged men and women who had fallen to the ground, as well as the young boy who had been blocking with his sword, all stood up in a strange pose. Each of their faces had collapsed, with their cheekbones visible.

"Who did this? Who summoned the dead with a spell in front of me?" Zhao Xu asked with a hint of annoyance.

At that moment, a tall man dressed in a black ceremonial robe emerged from the shadows, his entire body adorned with numerous bone ornaments. The man's face was shrouded in darkness, and his voice was hoarse as he spoke.

"The Return of the Dead, Tares, my master is interested in you. Are you willing to obey us?"

When Zhao Xu heard these words, his fists clenched tightly.
