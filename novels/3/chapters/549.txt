Chapter 550: The Rift between Reality and Game

As the countdown to the last month of crossing nears its end, even the most sluggish players in the Falling Star Town feel a sense of tension in the air, as if the entire town is mobilizing for war.

They live each day as if they're about to go to battle tomorrow. Normally, they would only transport precious silver ore and ordinary silver ore from the Falling Star Town to the outside world, but recently, a constant stream of carriages has been heading to the nearby port, carrying large quantities of supplies, and then piling up at the new, large granary built outside the town.

Thanks to Zhao Xu's repeated cleansing of the surrounding monsters, no one has dared to come and cause trouble in the short term.

However, the town residents are all extremely curious about how the lord, Zhong Xia, managed to mobilize over a thousand horses to transport supplies.

It's impossible to believe that magic could create such a large number of horses, let alone war horses. Even if it were true, it would be a significant expense to maintain the food, veterinary care, and breeding of such a large number of horses, and a single act of malicious poisoning or equine plague could wipe them all out.

Only the supply storage department under Zhao Xu's direct control knows that these horses used for transportation are actually small horses created by Zhao Xu using magical transformation.

It's truly amazing.

Zhao Xu uses the two-ring magic "Warfare Incantation: Summoning Steed". As a version of the one-ring "Summoning Steed" magic, it still has a duration of 2 hours per level.

Of course, when used in conjunction with "Temporal Extension" under Zhao Xu's control, it can be extended to a continuous 120 hours, or 5 days.
Here is the translation of the text:

Even if someone suspects that Zao Xu's "Summon Mount" spell is a trick, it's hard to explain how he managed to conjure up over a thousand horses and maintain their long lifespan.

With the ability of the Talisman Guardian, Zao Xu was able to dispense with the spellcasting materials, including the 1000-golden-coin statue made of copper, silver, and gold.

At this point, Zao Xu began to feel like a one-man empire.

His creative abilities had surpassed the imagination of players.

In the Five Rings spell, there is another spell called "Ghost Axe God's Work," which can convert one material into a product of the same kind.

However, this spell cannot be used to manufacture biological or magical items.

If he wants to convert something that requires craftsmanship, Zao Xu would need to possess the relevant craftsmanship skills.

What caught Zao Xu's attention was that the "raw materials" in the "raw materials" to "product" process were actually "spellcasting materials".

By consuming these spellcasting materials, he could create the final product.

For example, if he placed a gold brick in front of him, Zao Xu could convert it into an equivalent amount of gold coins.

One catty (a unit of weight) of gold is roughly equivalent to 55 gold coins.

This means he can use his "Supernatural Spell" ability to create an equivalent amount of gold coins without consuming the gold brick.

However, after several days of excited attempts, Zao Xu suddenly discovered that he could only succeed on the first try.

He could create 3,000 to 10,000 gold coins without consuming gold, but it was only converting gold into gold crafts, not creating gold from thin air.
Here is the translation of the text:

However, thanks to the power of "Ghost Axe Divine Craftsmanship", Zhao Xu's daily income increased by tens of thousands of gold coins. He also felt a sense of satisfaction in his heart. 

He remembered what Anniya had said earlier, that she had created 25,500 gold coins using "Wishcraft" and that it was not a one-time achievement, and Zhao Xu suspected that it was under the suppression of the power of King Arthur.

He thought that if he abused this power, he would be blocked immediately. 

In reality, if we consider the actual effect of the "Ghost Axe Divine Craftsmanship" five-ring spell, each level can convert 0.3 cubic meters of material, which is equivalent to 300 liters of water. Using a bucket as a unit, it is not small. 

As Zhao Xu converted at level 32, the upper limit was 9 cubic meters.

As for gold, 1 cubic meter is approximately 19 tons. This 9 cubic meters is equivalent to 10 million gold coins. 

If Zhao Xu could really release 10 million gold coins every day, even if the mage could consume gold as a spell material, he could stabilize the gold market.

However, according to his release amount, 600 tons of gold per month would undoubtedly affect the gold stability in the entire northern region, attracting the attention of the Commercial Goddess.

It is likely that this is also the reason why "Ghost Axe Divine Craftsmanship" is limited.

However, with this daily income, Zhao Xu's current predicament in purchasing food was alleviated.

With his benevolent and authoritarian leadership, he also granted benefits to his direct subordinates, causing their morale to be even more united.

He even started to gradually release the experience he had accumulated during the entire northern region's seal-breaking war, bit by bit.

Additionally, his "Eastern City" account on the forum also started to resume its daily posting rhythm.
Here is the translation of the text:

It's for the day when we won't need to trade lives for these information. At the same time, he also intends to follow up on the previous post "What if we can cross over" and gradually summarize his experiences in overcoming some difficulties from his past life.

At the same time, he has also re-enabled the account "Starlight Reflection" and, relying on the ability to teleport anywhere with the "Transmission Technique", he has completed numerous high-difficulty killing tasks as the mysterious mage account wielding the giant scythe.

He has also rekindled the passion for this account.

The construction of the Starfall Town is also proceeding smoothly according to the plan of Zhao Xu and Wang Qingwei.

As Wang Qingwei's personal charm spreads, more and more people are gathering around her, whether they are players or residents of Arther, and they are all unwittingly filled with affection for her, and her every request is met with a smile.

Even a mysterious fan group has begun to form around her.

Zhao Xu is quietly observing this.

He also realizes that some people are naturally suited to survive in this society...

Finally...

The days of June are slowly approaching.

Zhao Xu and others are about to take the exam again.

Like Zheng Xin'an, who is about to take the college entrance exam, these few days are unbearable under the pressure, and it's best to focus on reviewing.

Perhaps for her, the uncertain future is remote, and it's best to prioritize reality.

On the other hand, Wang Qingwei casually tells Zhao Xu that she has already arranged everything in reality, and if her body allows it, she will spend the last few days playing games with an IV drip and glucose injection, 24 hours a day.

"Brother Xu."

Suddenly, Zhang Qi shouted to Zhao Xu, who was taking off his helmet and getting out of bed.
Here is the translation of the text:

"What's wrong?" Zhao Xu was astonished.

As the entire plan for crossing was gradually unfolding, he didn't even have time to think about his academic work, let alone the fact that he had nearly disappeared for a year. Even the class monitor and Qi Lu couldn't persuade him. Not to mention that a strict teacher who was responsible for attendance had already told him that he didn't need to take the final exam this semester because it wouldn't make a difference anyway.

"Hey, Xu, don't you think you should take a break from gaming for a while?" Zhang Qi advised. "Last time, the teacher knew about your situation and specifically went to talk to the professor. Just yesterday, the professor agreed to let you take the exam. You scored 58 or 59 points, so don't expect anyone to help you out with 40% of the regular grade."

Zhang Qi was worried and said, "The teacher was in a good mood today, but I'm not sure if it's because of a disagreement with his wife or something. He suddenly announced that today's attendance would be zero. The other girl who skipped class and came crying to ask for mercy just now."

In other words, Zhao Xu and his friends would only have a chance to pass the exam if they got full marks. The teacher's course was one of the few open-book subjects, but it was extremely difficult to get full marks.

"So, the teacher wants you to go see him tomorrow," Zhang Qi said, looking at Zhao Xu, who was looking rather exhausted.

"Okay, I understand," Zhao Xu nodded.

"Zhao Xu..."
Here is the translation of the text:

Suddenly, Chen Sīnán, who was usually quiet, spoke up: "Although I also like this game, the prerequisite for playing a good game is at least a stable and realistic life."

"We can't be like Han Qi, who runs a library on the rooftop just to prepare for the entrance examination. But we've almost finished our junior year."

After undergoing half a year of Saint Wu's training, Chen Sīnán had developed a strong and inviolable aura around him.

"Zhang Qi was preparing to go to the teacher's office to ask for help yesterday," Chen Sīnán said, his face turning red as he spoke, and he waved off Zhang Qi's attempt to interrupt him. "From next September, the interview season will begin, and the school will issue our academic records from freshman to junior year."

"You had a poor grade last semester, and you still have a makeup exam next semester. However, the subjects you failed in your junior year cannot be reflected in the records before the makeup exam. So, by the time the records are issued, there will only be a red 'fail' mark."

As Chen Sīnán's voice rose, he said, "Stop it!"

Zhou Xù was also slightly surprised, as he hadn't expected Zhang Qi to go to the teacher's office, let alone ask for help from the teacher, who was known for his ability to mediate between professors and students. Zhou Xù couldn't help but laugh, and he thought to himself, "Zhang Qi has spent over 600 yuan, and he's even spent his own money on me."

As for their living expenses, most students' families could only afford a few hundred yuan per month, unless they came from wealthy families, in which case they could afford several thousand yuan per month.
Here is the translation:

They are still a traditional school with a simple and plain academic atmosphere, unlike some private schools that are filled with children from wealthy families. With 38 students in a class, there are already 25 cars on the road.

"Thank you," said Zhao Xiu with a slight nod.

Before this, Zhao Xiu was able to put things aside and return to reality to participate in learning.

However, his plan in Star Town is now developing rapidly, with over a hundred people coming to report their progress to him every day. He can barely have time to eat.

"This is what you're worried about," said Liu Hanqiang, who had just finished eating and returned, having stood at the door for a while.

"Zhao Xiu thinks he can make a living by playing this game, Arthur, and make a fortune. Let him go, what's the point of bothering him?" Liu Hanqiang jeered.

"You don't have to worry," Zhao Xiu interrupted.

"I'll explain it to you in July," he said.
