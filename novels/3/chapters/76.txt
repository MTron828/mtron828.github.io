Chapter 077: Unable to Touch

After hearing the whistle of the sentry, the people inside the tent suddenly woke up. The warrior and the ranger, Maple Leaf, quickly grabbed the light armor hanging nearby and put it on. They didn't want to waste time putting on heavy armor, or it would take too long and the battle would be over before they finished.

The priest, Yu Yu, had already stood up and walked over to open the tent flap. She looked outside and said, "It's too dark, I can't see. Those bonfires are also extinguished."

The entire team started moving at this time, with many warriors directly putting on their armor according to the regulations set by Luo Ya.

Then, a sudden and terrifying scream echoed through the night, shattering the original tranquility.

Zhao Xu at this time also rolled up his scroll, although the process of copying spells to his mind was interrupted, but it wouldn't affect too much. However, the scroll was definitely unusable for casting spells again.

Immediately afterwards, another terrifying wail echoed through the night.

The sounds of chaos and confusion rose and fell like the ebb and flow of the tides.

"Run! I can't take it!" someone shouted.

"I don't know how—"

As the terrifying sounds reached their ears, Priest Yu Yu was stunned, her hand that had been opening the tent flap suddenly relaxing.

"Be cautious of the undead," Zhao Xu thought to himself.

This couldn't be just wolves roaming at night, or they wouldn't be beating the people outside to the point of being unable to defend themselves.

Facing this situation, Zhao Xu cast a level one evil protection spell on himself.

This spell lasted for one minute per caster level and was enough for him to use. The spell also allowed him to face evil enemies with a 2-level boost in defense and 2-level boost in saving throw, both of which increased by 10%.

What's more important is that the spell can provide protection against psychic attacks and mind control by evil beings. At this time, a few people were busy putting on their gear, and the poet took a torch and lit it before preparing to leave. Zhao Xu quickly stepped in front of the poet and whispered, "Is the performance at level 3? If so, let's go out and sing 'Boost Morale' immediately."

The poet glanced at Zhao Xu and received a nod of agreement. "Singing" is the poet's supernatural ability to strengthen all teammates who hear the song, and the effect can last for at least five rounds even after the poet stops singing.

Just then, the warrior, Maple Leaf, stepped forward, holding up a shield and leading the way out.

The entire campsite looked like it had been ravaged by a storm, with several tents already knocked down by fleeing people. The torch lit by the poet became the only bright spot in the surroundings.

The poet's song, "Boost Morale", resonated in their ears.

【As an adventurer, Zhongxia obtained the blessing of the poet's song "Boost Morale", which grants a +1 bonus to morale, allowing the character to ignore the effects of fear and intimidation, and adds a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls. The effect lasts for at least five rounds or more.】

Just then, Zhao Xu and the others finally caught sight of a figure, dressed in a robe, standing about ten meters in front of them. "Ghost!" Zhao Xu shouted out in alarm, having seen such a terrifying creature before. However, he didn't even have time to tell everyone to close their eyes before he felt a strange sensation in his eyes, followed by a recovery to normal, as if he had been affected by some kind of impact.
Here is the translation of the text:

The adventurer, Zhōng Xià, was hit by the ghost's "frightful appearance" and had to make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 18. He rolled a 7 and added his Constitution modifier, which is 7, making the total 18, which is equal to the DC. He successfully passed the saving throw and avoided 1d4 force damage, 1d4 dexterity damage, and 1d4 Constitution damage.

Zhāo Xù, who was watching, almost shouted "Good luck!" when he saw the result. The 7 points of Constitution come from the Cleric's profession, 2 points from Constitution adjustment, 2 points from protective evil spell, and 1 point from the Bard's singing.

Although he still has a 50% chance of being affected, the result is fortunate and he passed the saving throw. Otherwise, the three types of damage would have severely injured him.

The ghost's victim, who didn't pass the saving throw, said, "My Constitution is tough, and I lost 4 points of ability. I only have 5 HP left."

The Bard murmured, "I'm like that too," but then continued singing to boost the party's morale.

Zhāo Xù continued to carefully observe the ghost, which had almost destroyed his team in a previous life, and was still fearful of it. Just looking at the ghost from 20 meters away would affect him. Fortunately, he had just passed the saving throw, and he won't be affected by the ghost's ability for at least 24 hours.

The warrior stood guard in front of them, holding up his shield. He didn't dare to advance.

The ghost turned around and looked at Zhāo Xù and the others with a cold smile, his face like a demon lurking between the spiritual and material worlds.

Suddenly, Láo Yà, who was hiding in the shadows, gripped his giant sword and charged at the ghost. The sword flashed with a cold light as it struck the ghost without being dodged.

As long as one gives up evasion, even if their defense level is high, they will receive a -5 agility penalty, and only a few buffs will take effect.

However, Luo Ya's facial expression suddenly changed from ecstatic to shocked. His most trusted sword, as if cutting through the air, flew towards the ground without any obstruction.

It seemed as if the ghost before them did not exist in the real world.

The guards surrounding them were frightened out of their wits, their eyes wide with terror.

"In that case, we have to run! No magical weapon can harm a ghost," Zhao Xu shouted.

Hearing these words, Luo Ya's face turned pale.

He had realized that all his authority would be taken away, and the countless scars on his body, which represented his efforts, would all be reduced to ashes tonight.

However, Luo Ya refused to give up and turned around to flee.

The ghost, which had been facing Luo Ya, felt his sword and looked back at him with contempt. It stared at Luo Ya as he ran away, its eyes fixed on him.

A mysterious power shot out from the ghost's eyes, silent and invisible, leaving no trace. But Luo Ya, who had his back to the ghost, was struck by an invisible arrow and fell to the ground, unable to move.

The four players who witnessed this bizarre scene all felt their legs go weak, even the poet who was singing a song to lift everyone's spirits. Luo Ya, a warrior, was no exception. His life force was higher than anyone else's in the scene.

Even he fell down, so it was likely that the next one to fall would be one of the five Zhao Xu's followers.

"Don't worry, Luo Ya is still alive. It's only when life force falls below -10 that it's considered true death. That's the ghost's 'corrosive gaze' attack, which deals 2D10 damage and 1D4 charm damage if it's not resisted through strong will,"
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu hastily consoled, "Let's not worry about the ghost not arriving yet, we'll scatter and escape one by one and avoid being beaten separately."

After hearing that it was a strong exemption, the warriors at least relaxed their breathing. The one who was at the forefront, who had just passed the strong exemption, had blocked the impact of the ghost's "terrifying appearance".

This successful experience gave him a slight recovery of courage.

Just then, the ghost, having knocked down Luo Ya, suddenly flew towards them without hesitation.

With a perfect flying speed, the distance of less than 10 meters was not a problem.

Everyone present had no magical weapons and could not harm this ghost.

Zhao Xu then directly chanted incantations.
