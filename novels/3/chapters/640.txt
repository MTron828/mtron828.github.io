Chapter 641: Eight Thousand Injuries, Eternal Belonging

At this moment, Zhao Xu's entire body was still enveloped in the power of the anti-magic field, with a ten-foot radius suppressing all magical movements. However, the suppressing effect of the Iron Heart's power allowed the numerous buffs that were constantly present on his body to flow freely without obstruction.

The radiance of the various spells such as the Domain of Decline, the Treasure of the Legacy Seeker, the Sacrificial Body, and the Shield of Praise, which were all buffing Zhao Xu, shone on his body, gradually building up his aura to its peak.

From another dimension, Zhao Xu was a being with the ability to resist magic, yet he was still able to manipulate the "unknowable existence" of magic.

In an instant, the Phantom Steed, which had exceeded the level of an 18th-level spellcaster, had reached its maximum state and transformed into a flying horse, shooting out at a speed that surpassed that of a giant dragon.

At the same time, the shape-shifting ability of the "Heavenly Realm" in his hand began to take effect, suddenly transforming into an extremely sharp long spear!

Zhao Xu put on the "Rider's Boots" and triggered the "Riding Battle" expertise.

The Phantom Steed topped with the "Warrior's Reins" triggered the "Rapid Riding Attack" expertise.

The combination of the two triggered the "Furious Charge" expertise!

In an instant, his entire body's charge strength surged, and even a thick, imposing wall in front of him would be smashed to pieces!

The "Furious Charge" expertise, which could only be learned by mastering the "Riding Battle" and "Rapid Riding Attack" expertise, could be the final item in the set of three items for the "Riding Battle" expertise.

However, the price for increasing the charge damage by one level was that it could not be replaced!
Here is the translation of the text:

At the same time, the "fearless" power imbued on the long gun is triggered, and the damage output is doubled, just like when using the "Tiger's Charge" skill. The non-living beings in front of Zhao Xu's eyes even produce a sharp, piercing sound and a faint smoke due to the intense friction of the air.

The long gun's charge attack causes double the damage, ranking first among all weapons.

When combined with "Tiger's Charge" and "Fearless", the damage output is quadrupled, as if it has directly struck the vital spot and caused a critical hit.

The artificial demon in front of him, imbued with divine pride, shows no signs of retreat.

Even if someone were to pull out a sword and strike at him, thousands of times may not be enough to inflict a true wound.

Artemis, with his extraordinary abilities, magic, and psychic powers, is a being beyond human comprehension.

After the intense battle, some creatures are no longer killed by simple "effort" and "concentration".

This is also the reason why the artificial demon, who has been responsible for the Fourth Catastrophe on Earth, has suffered repeated defeats in the eight months of gameplay time.

Therefore, the artificial demon is now aware of the power of Zhao Xu's gun, which can cause multiple times the damage and is even considering using it to slaughter the gods.

Even Zhao Xu's decision to abandon his spellcasting and switch to melee combat is met with ridicule from the artificial demon.

The final, all-out attack after the charge, which requires the utmost strength, is something that even the artificial demon cannot withstand.

However, Zhao Xu is determined to charge forward, his eyes fixed on the target, with no intention of retreating.

As for the artificial demon, it is now facing a being with the same identity as a nine-ring pastor, the chief of the gods, who has the ability to use "Super Multi-Weapon Combat" and can swing his hundreds of arms to deal thousands of damage.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

So, Zhao Xū's one hit could create a miracle, but for it, it was just scratching an itch. As a divine being, it had already become immune to the "instant death" effect, so the opponent's weapon, which came with a decapitation effect, was of no use. The final door of "winning with weakness" was also closed.

However, Zhao Xū was becoming increasingly skilled, and even the legendary undead creatures surrounding him could hear the sound of his gun being cocked! In the blink of an eye, Zhao Xū finally brandished his long gun, aiming it at the artificial Death God.

One shot was fired!

The buffalo charge - additional 200% damage!

The artificial Death God raised an eyebrow, but it was not surprised, as it could only be pierced by breaking through its defense. There was no light-based effect, and he was trying to break through its defense level, which was difficult to estimate. All the legendary undead creatures in the scene also shook their heads slightly.

Although the battle erupted too quickly, allowing them to assess the situation, it was impossible to use melee output to kill them. They could even see a mage, who was actively approaching and being slaughtered.

This was a foolish move, taking advantage of the enemy's weakness.

It is worth noting that distance is a mage's greatest defense.

The next second!

"How is this possible?" accompanied by this cry, Zhao Xū's long gun, like crossing a mountain of knives and fire, marched over the artificial Death God's body, as if it was a thin film without defense.

Ghostly strike!
With only two rings, the effect was already above the level of a light-based weapon with a +4 bonus. Moreover, the spellcaster usually didn't have time to cast a bunch of spells before the battle, and it was Zhao Xū who relied on his spells to sustain himself, making it possible for him to make this unexpected move.
Here is the translation of the text:

The artificial God of Death's expression changed to one of surprise at this moment, as it was already within striking distance of Zhao Xü's body, less than 3 meters away. As the magic-resistant field arrived, the artificial God of Death realized that all of its spells and magical items had lost their effects!

This situation was one that a legendary wizard, not far removed from a 20-level commoner, could easily dispatch. Even because of the magic-resistant field, the artificial God of Death's resurrection and teleportation spells had all lost their effects.

This was one of the reasons why it would be easily pierced by Zhao Xü.

However, Zhao Xü's strength was not limited to this. His blood-red eyes seemed to burn with fury, and his chaotic, dark red glow surrounded the tip of his spear in a disorderly manner.

Blood fury: 19 points! Leadership charge: 5 points! Divine blessing: 3 points! Urgent: 2 points!

The entire strength of the attack was unleashed, and the single-hit damage output reached 95 points!

With the five-fold multiplication, the direct damage output reached 475 points!

Finally, the artificial God of Death's expression changed slightly, as it had always been carefree and seen Zhao Xü's actions as child's play.

But it didn't end there. Suddenly, the sustained two-ring spell "Lion's Charge" was triggered, and the mighty force pierced Zhao Xü's entire body, turning the original momentum into stored elastic energy.

In an instant, Zhao Xü's power was replenished, and he was able to accumulate the strength for a continuous attack.

The second shot!

380 points!

The artificial God of Death was once again pierced through by Zhao Xü, with golden blood pouring out of his spear, as if bathing in new life.

The surrounding legendary undead creatures let out a collective gasp, unable to believe what they were witnessing.

Their master, who was supposed to be invincible, had been pierced through twice, with wounds that could not be healed.
After Zhao Xu's second strike, he felt a painful numbness in his arm. However, he quickly accelerated and unleashed a swift technique that made his arm move like lightning, pulling his arm back and shooting out one last, almost impossible shot - 380! The three consecutive hits exceeded 1,000 points and landed squarely on the artificial god of death, telling him how ridiculous his former pride was. Even a lowly insect could bite at these high-and-mighty deities.

"It's my turn now," the artificial god of death snarled, his mouth cornering with golden blood.

After the three consecutive hits, Zhao Xu panted and adjusted his breathing, readjusting his rhythm. This all-out effort, unleashing all his strength, was a desperate gamble with no retreat. Therefore, this one-second window was the artificial god of death's opportunity to easily eliminate Zhao Xu.

Even if it was a mere mortal's magic, could it really slay a god?

The artificial god of death reached out and pulled Zhao Xu's chest, his arm transforming into a dark and deadly force, like a rope made of countless circles of black silk, being pulled from behind and representing the power to destroy everything.

At this moment, Zhao Xu gritted his teeth, and this was the moment he would turn the tide.

Shield of Protection!

In an instant, the +5 Quick/Indomitable/Life/Experience/Transformation/Fine/Mental Shadow/Protection/Long Gun directly unleashed seven "Wish Forces". The seven future versions of Zhao Xu were summoned to this moment.
Here is the translation of the text:

They were like shadows of each other, flickering and flashing on Zhao Xu's body, and all grasping the infinite sharpness of the long gun with the same grip. Zhao Xu immediately shouted, "Seven-Strike Extermination!"

If someone said he could swing a gun over three meters long in an instant, striking from seven different angles, each time pouring out all his strength. Then everyone would think it's a joke.

Only legendary warriors could barely manage to land four consecutive strikes, which was the strongest four-hit strike created by King Arthur.

It took no more than a few seconds, just like Zhao Xu's previous consecutive strikes.

However, at this moment...

From the artificial death god to all the legendary undead beings present, they all witnessed something. They couldn't see what just happened, but the artificial death god had been pierced through seven times in a row by Zhao Xu!

Ten transparent blood holes were visible, like a row of tally marks.

The golden divine blood spread across the dragon crystal vein, interacting with each other and producing a rolling, scorching sound wave.

At this moment, the artificial death god, who had almost given up, was about to let out a mighty roar.

If it hadn't coincidentally appeared at the bottom of this mystical cave, surrounded by the dragon crystal vein, it would have long since died and fallen into eternal slumber.

It looked at Zhao Xu with reverence and fear, saying that he was the first to make him realize that the fusion of magic and melee combat could lead to such a terrifying state.

It was also exhausted to the point of near collapse due to this crushing blow.

It could only muster the last bit of strength and counterattack Zhao Xu!

You're done, I'm here!

Now is the stage for this eternal being, about to take the throne of the death god.
Here is the translation of the text:

Even if it pulls back a bit, the divine power on its body can restore its state completely.

As long as it can't be killed in one hit, it will never die.

This is the terror of the artificial god of death.

Moreover, it is worried that Zhao Xiu might be able to launch another terrifying attack in the future, so it is willing to take the risk and strike at this moment when the opponent is exhausted.

"Just a little more!"

The personified long gun of Heaven also let out a furious roar at this moment.

Millennia have passed, and this scene of near collapse is unbearable to behold. The personified long gun of Heaven can no longer maintain its composure.

It never thought that after combining its knowledge and devout harm, it would still be unable to kill the opponent with a single blow.

This series of ten consecutive hits has already dealt 4180 damage!

It still underestimated the opponent's "damage reduction" ability, which only takes effect in the next round, missing the opportunity to strike.

Even under the crushing damage of this moment, the artificial god of death finally showed signs of faltering.

"Let's attack him together!" The artificial god of death finally put aside its dignity and, seizing the opportunity of the opponent's brief pause, sent a mental message to the undead beings in front of it.

However, the long gun pierced through the god's body and tore away the last shred of courage from the heart of the legendary undead beings.

The artificial god of death also understood the intentions of the others.

But it didn't care anymore.

Because in the blink of an eye, its arm had already extended three meters, reaching out to the opponent's chest.

"There's still a chance!"

Zhao Xiu's eyes had already turned red with fury, like a gambler who has gone all in.

"What's the point of preparing for anything?" Zhao Xiu's and the personified long gun of Heaven's thoughts flashed back and forth.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Four-ring's 'Quick Release' spell can at most allow you to unleash another attack, but it won't change the fact that it's already too late."

"I still underestimated the opponent's strength."

The divine heaven's long gun is despondent.

"No."

Zhao Xu looked at the magical storage ring on his hand with a nostalgic gaze.

Who could have thought that from the moment he charged to the present, he had completed ten consecutive attacks, and the external time had not yet passed six seconds.

"I need to use this technique in advance."

Zhao Xu muttered to himself in his heart.

Only one mage knew how many trump cards he had really played.

The high-level magical storage ring, which Zhao Xu had purchased on the black market in the Northern Alliance, had been secured with some future income from the secret silver mine.

Its effect was to store the mage's spells and release them at a later time.

The high-level version in Zhao Xu's hand could store spells of levels one to nine.

The key was that he had initially let An Tiya wear this ring, and she had stored an eight-ring spell called "Higher Quick Release!" on it.

Borrowing time from the future!

Quick Release borrowed a moment of backlash time.

But Higher Quick Release borrowed a complete new round of time!

The artificial God of Death had almost reached the point where it would dissect Zhao Xu's heart and liver. However, it was stuck in the flow of time, unable to detect any of this.

Because Zhao Xu had just dodged an attack, his body was half-slanted, as if floating in the air.

Smiling, he didn't stop moving.

Guardian, consuming 35,000 gold coins, automatically recharged.

Under the new round of time, Zhao Xu's eyes flashed red again, and he once again grasped the "long gun" that felt like a thousand jun in his hand, continuing to charge forward with all his might.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Time rewinds, history repeats itself.
Ghostly blows, lion's charges, rhino charges... Ten consecutive strikes of destruction!
In total, 20 consecutive strikes, pouring 88 times the damage into the body of the "Artificial God of Death", which had been weakened by its vulnerable physique. Originally, its massive body was first aware of the insufficient distribution of the damage holes!
Finally, time returns to normal, and the sound of the torn wound continues to spread.
The Artificial God of Death falls to the ground, and the fragments of its divine aura rise up.
8360 points of damage."
