Chapter 614: The Transmitter of the Nine Swords

After entering the darkness, Zhao Xu suddenly sprang into the air and flew through the dark cave, relying solely on his constant dark vision and not needing any illumination. He was constantly accelerating and moving forward throughout.

At this moment, he was equipped with the "Higher Atmospheric Wing" spell, which had reached the perfect level of mobility, like a flexible bee. He was performing various extreme actions in the winding tunnel.

After running for about 15 minutes and passing through at least five forks, Zhao Xu slowed down and re-examined the vast plaza he had just entered. The surroundings looked like an ancient arena, with grayish-white stone blocks and yellow soil everywhere. The ceiling was extremely high, at least 50 meters.

The plants that grew on the ceiling emitted a faint green glow.

This place looked like a playground for giant, night-dwelling, immortal creatures.

After taking a look around, Zhao Xu stopped in his tracks.

This place had at least 20-30 branches, making it a challenging location to navigate. However, it was also perfect for him to capture a few intelligent, immortal creatures to investigate.

At this moment, Zhao Xu was waiting for the immortal creatures that posed little threat to him.

However, he couldn't help but feel that the underground space of this cave was far beyond his imagination. Although he had taken the small roads to avoid the main path, he still hadn't met any players.

Zhao Xu didn't stop moving and continued to carry out his intelligence work.
Here is the translation:

On the ground, he wants to find out if there's a treasure or a treasure box buried beneath the earth, and he can use a metal detector for that. But in Arden, everything can be guaranteed by "magic". "Treasure sense".

A three-ring hour-level spell is released, and instantly, a colorful metallic glow envelops Zhao Xuan's entire body, as if a thin mist is rotating around him.

Then, these mists actively burrow into Zhao Xuan's nose, making him unable to suppress a sneeze.

The next moment, the aura of treasure suddenly permeates Zhao Xuan's nasal cavity - during the duration of the spell, all gold, silver, copper, white gold, and precious stones within a 6-meter radius will be sensed by Zhao Xuan as existing in a particular direction. When they are within 2 meters, the position can be judged accurately.

This ensures that Zhao Xuan can still sense some obvious dragon crystal even if he walks past quickly. The only question is that if the rock thickness exceeds 30 centimeters or the lead plate is over 1 meter deep, this spell's effect can be blocked.

However, Zhao Xuan did not stop there. He directly released a one-ring spell that only exists in the "urban domain" - a pastor's divine spell that is not listed on the wizard's list - "Awakening the City"!

With a 10-minute incantation time, he can gain knowledge about the city, as if he has already become a member of the community. He knows the community's population, species, proportion, highest occupation level, and power center type, and the strongest items in the city. If Zhao Xuan masters this spell in the half-death realm of the God of Death, he can instantly know the detailed information of that city of immortal beings.

However, at this moment, Zhao Xuan realized that this was not a city at all.
Here is the translation of the text:

It's as if there is no central authority, these immortal beings are simply gathering unconsciously!
Facing this, Zhao Xu didn't lose heart because this judgment had already told him enough.
Taking a deep breath, Zhao Xu continued to cast the spell he had used before, "Terrain Perception" (Poet 4 Druid 1).
He had once used this spell to release green spiritual energy near the ancient Morlin Stone, and at that time, a map of the surrounding terrain appeared directly in his mind, showing cities, villages, and famous ruins.
However, this time, Zhao Xu's mind was still in a state of chaos, and the spiritual energy had been forced back.
"Legend Search!" (Poet 4 Knowledge 7 Sage 6) - Obtaining legendary stories about a notable person, place, or thing.
"Inquire of Nature!" (Druid 5 Ranger 4 Animal Domain 5) - Becoming one with nature, knowing the environment, such as terrain, plants, minerals, water bodies, and inhabitants.
After casting these two powerful spells, Zhao Xu couldn't help but feel his breath quicken slightly.

There was no gain at all!
Especially the "Inquire of Nature" spell that could detect mineral deposits was also unable to provide any clues, as if this void was being suppressed by some mysterious force.
Moreover, the immortal beings that were supposed to appear didn't even show up, which was too strange.
Zhao Xu continued to turn around and look at the surroundings, unable to grasp anything.
He was even scrutinizing the intricate patterns on the parchment, as if trying to unravel the secrets of life and death.
Here is the translation of the text:

Right after that, Zhao Xu brushed up on his skills and reactivated the abilities of a 1st-level cleric, "Knowledge" - understanding local celebrities, legendary items, and notable locations. He could still rely on his instincts like a bamboo basket scooping water.

Zhao Xu looked at his over 80-level knowledge and realized it wasn't that simple.

"Young people, don't waste your energy," a voice as old as the hills suddenly echoed from behind him.

Zhao Xu was startled and turned around, his all-encompassing field of vision only becoming clear to him at this moment. Standing behind him was a mysterious old man, with no invisible signs whatsoever.

Zhao Xu's "Flash Bomb" and "Uncovering Illusions" skills were squashed back into their original form.

The old man's body was hunched over, with a tangled mess of white hair on his head, even reaching down to his chest, except for his piercing eyes.

The old man's hand held a somewhat worn wooden sword.

The phrase "without a sword, one can still win with a stick" doesn't apply here, as the wooden sword wasn't enchanted, and it would be no match for a magical sword.

Is this really an old player who looks like a beggar?

Or is it a shape-shifting undead creature?

Instantly, Zhao Xu silently cast the "Detect Undead" spell, scanning the old man in front of him. However, all he got was confusion - the old man's aura was blocked, or he was just like Zhao Xu.

"Interesting young man, you're detecting me the moment we meet," the old man chuckled, shaking his head.

"Be careful when going out, and be cautious of old men like me. I need to judge if you're a fake or not," Zhao Xu explained.

Everyone knows the story of the farmer and the snake, and Zhao Xu knew that these evil undead creatures would use human nature's goodness to launch an attack.
Here is the translation of the text:

When the old man heard this, he burst into a loud laughter, and his white teeth shone brightly, forming a striking contrast with his disheveled appearance. "Don't you find it strange that this massive hall has no undead creatures lurking about?" he said, his gaze intentionally fixed on Zhao Xu, who was holding a simple pouch containing a dragon crystal at his waist, especially considering that he had brought an item that attracts spirits to this place.

Upon hearing this, Zhao Xu's expression turned serious, and his hands were poised to shoot out "Quick Release", "Bouncing Ball", or "Force Wall" at any moment.

The old man before him was radiating an aura that made Zhao Xu feel an intense sense of danger.

"What's your business here?" Zhao Xu asked again, his expression stern.

"Ah, you're referring to the physical immunity of the Starseed Cloak, the daughter of Anzilonna?" the old man said with a disappointed smile.

"Whatever, it has nothing to do with me," the old man said, "In your eyes, I'm just a lost soul."

"Or, you can call me another name - Qing Bu Qi, one of the founders of the Nine Swords System."
