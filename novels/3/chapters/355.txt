After listening to Robert's words, Zhao Xun remained silent. He simply continued to gaze at the knights in front of him, his hand still holding the top of the staff, as if calculating something. The few lucky individuals who had successfully dodged the law spell among the knights looked at this scene with trepidation, not daring to take a step forward.

Those who had their throats cut and were licking their own blood were familiar with the horror stories of mages. For example, a thief who displeased a mage might be turned into a "mouse" and thrown into a sewer, never to be seen again. Some might even be struck by lightning summoned by mages, their bodies burnt to a crisp and their deaths terrifying.

Zheng Xin'an and Elliot followed Zhao Xun as he got off the carriage, together gazing at these people who were tightly bound. In the distance, another group of knights struggled to emerge from the thick fog. They were vomiting and trembling with fear, their stomachs still aching from the aftereffects of the spell, and had no energy to do anything else. Even the gruesome sights before them made the bodyguards of Lady Betty, who were about to come to their aid, feel a shiver down their spines. Despite wearing sturdy armor, they couldn't help but stroke their own stomachs, as if they were experiencing the same thing.

Lady Betty, who ran a magic shop in the Purple Pine Guild, couldn't help but understand the power of the man in the white robe and black cloak. It was as if he could summon the wind with one hand and the rain with the other.
Because of the ordinary third-ring mage, the difficulty of the spell exemption is simply impossible to reach such an exaggerated level, which directly caused most of the cavalry present to fall. This means that this seemingly ordinary spellcaster's own spell exemption difficulty exceeds the general level. Either the opponent's "intelligence" is extraordinary, allowing the spell to be more complex. Or the opponent used a higher ring of spells, or has enough expertise to support and increase the difficulty. This leads to a more terrifying speculation - this spellcaster is not just a third-ring mage. Third-ring mages or third-ring priests are not rare in the kingdom of Mysteria, the land of the magic goddess. But for their ordinary guilds, they are already close to the ceiling of what they can achieve. Even many guilds are willing to enslave and drive the mage families, hoping to cultivate one or two outstanding descendants who can serve as mages. As for priests, they are servants of the gods, not something they dare to imagine or speak of. "Mother, what's wrong?" At this time, the six or seven-year-old Webster looked at his mother, Lady Betty, and gently shook her finger. "Nothing, child, you need to close your eyes next," Lady Betty just smiled gently at her young son and lightly covered his eyes with her hand. At this time, she lightly draped her expensive fur coat and walked gracefully towards Zhao Xu's side with her young son, making the standard gesture of respect towards him. Zhao Xu immediately realized that this was a bow made by a follower of the goddess to a priestess of the goddess, and directly nodded to Zheng Xinyun next to him.
Here is the translation:

Zheng Xin Yu, who had just encountered this aspect of the content for the first time on the day of the game's launch, was doing it with no hesitation, and even returned a more standard greeting.

Most residents of Mistral, including Betty, worshipped the magic goddess Sylvina. It was not strange that Betty coincidentally shared this trait.

As the sky above the misty forest began to drizzle with fine snowflakes, they slowly fell onto people's cloaks and outer garments.

The snowflakes gently touched Zheng Xin Yu's neck, and the icy sensation made her shiver, causing her to curl up in her cloak and exhale a warm breath.

"Pastor of the Goddess in the mortal world, thank you for your timely aid to us orphans and widows," Betty said again, expressing her gratitude to Zhao Xu.

Her voice was soft and melodious, with no hint of age, making it impossible to imagine that she was already a 7-year-old mother.

However, this time, Zhao Xu, representing the Goddess's pastor, accepted the task with ease.

Just now, he had reportedly saved Betty and her child, which was no exaggeration.

Zhao Xu, with no ulterior motives in his heart, was worthy of such a greeting.

At this moment, Betty finally lifted her head, and her face changed several times as she did so.

This was because she noticed that the cloak worn by Zhao Xu, although it seemed ordinary with no distinguishing marks or insignia, looked similar to the one worn by the novice female pastor beside him.

However, relying on her experience in the textile industry, Betty quickly judged that Zhao Xu's cloak was actually a "sacrificial robe" only worn by high-ranking clergy of the Goddess's Church.
Here is the translation of the text in English:

There are no grand religious rituals in everyday life, so even if the Pope is wearing such a vestment, there won't be any awkwardness. However, Betty's face changed color once she confirmed the identity of the other person, and she immediately thought of the "spider web technique" and "stinky cloud technique" that the other person had just demonstrated. These techniques are essentially occult and are not something that a ordinary pastor who uses divine power can perform. Betty, who has been crawling and climbing in Mistral for over ten years, naturally won't be shocked or surprised. As a goddess's devotee, she has some understanding of the goddess's power. The goddess's pastors can perform limited occult techniques, but these people are all deeply loved by the goddess. Therefore, even if Betty has over ten years of cultivation and has accumulated deep foundations, she couldn't help but get excited at this moment. She realized that she had just met a big shot and had just overcome the first hurdle. At this moment, the knights around her, who had not yet been given the order to attack, also slowly emerged. However, even though they were wearing shining armor that shone like the sun and were noble knights who would kneel down to commoners, they still dared not move at this moment. Compared to players, the native people of Arthur knew better how to beg for mercy from a wizard. Especially this mysterious wizard used two spells to prove the gap between them and himself. The wizard's reputation, accumulated over many years, made Zhao Yu seem mysterious and unknown to everyone at this moment. Even the knights regained their freedom, but they dared not attack or flee towards him again.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Sir." Robert, the leader of the mounted archers, looked at himself as he chased after Mrs. Betty, who was walking towards the mysterious wizard. He suddenly interrupted his voice.

His face changed color, and he then shouted, "Sir, you're revealing your identity as a wizard. We dare not offend you."

In reality, Robert was also furious. There were teleportation gates in the surrounding towns, which were used by high-level wizards to directly teleport to their destinations. It was absurd for them to waste hours traveling by horseback, especially since the carriage they were riding was rented from a relay station and didn't have any special markings indicating their noble family or association.

So he mistakenly thought the other party was just a common traveler from a distant land.

This wizard didn't wear the unique robe that wizards wore to identify themselves. Mainly, it was also due to the haughty nature of the wizard himself. After Robert questioned him, he would directly mock or scold him.

Where could he get away with charging forward? The other party looked like someone who was not used to the dignity of a wizard.

"Sir, I hope you will take pity on us and spare our lives?" Zhao Xu naturally didn't recognize the name of Mr. Chilo.

He was too busy every day to recognize these people, so he didn't need to level up.

In general, Zhao Xu had a basic understanding of the key figures and their surnames behind them.

He didn't recognize this name, so it was a crime.

"Mr. Chilo is the steward of the Fen family, one of the hundred great wizard families of Mistral." At this time, Elliot came up to remind Zhao Xu.

Fen?

This name was immediately forgotten by Zhao Xu.
Here is the translation of the text:

"What are you planning to do with these people who want to kill you?" Zhao Xu directly turned his head towards Mrs. Betty, as if he didn't care about the resistance from the knight leader, Rupert. However, the originally calm Mrs. Betty, who had been covering her eyes to prevent her son from seeing the blood, suddenly turned red in the cheeks when she heard the name "Kilro". Zhao Xu couldn't help but suppress a smile inside, thinking that compared to the straightforward battles in the game, the inner circle of the Mistral organization was too full of twists and turns. It seemed that Abel's son, Harry, who controlled the Purple Jasmine Guild, had done a good job in secretly aligning himself with a more important figure, causing Mrs. Betty to become wary. "Respected Goddess Priestess, may I make a presumptuous request of you?" Mrs. Betty said, taking a deep breath, before speaking to Zhao Xu.
