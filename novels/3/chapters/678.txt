Chapter 679: The Actress in the Lair

The cavalry troops on one side of the earth looked at the space that was being swept away by the energy fragment storm, and they dared not advance for a long time.

Even their warhorses, which had seen the gruesome sight of the bodies scattered on the ground, had become limp.

"What kind of existence is causing this?" the commander of the cavalry troops asked.

Behind him, hundreds of players who had ventured into the unknown looked on in bewilderment.

Just moments ago, they had been in a stalemate, but suddenly the battlefield had entered a new dimension.

It seemed as if an invisible, dark hand was manipulating everything, mocking their weakness.

"Perhaps it's a team of mage squad?" the mage who served as the team's consultant said with a hint of incredulity.

His eyes were wide with astonishment, as if he had just touched magic for the first time.

But none of them could find any unusual or magical signs on this battlefield littered with bodies.

"Let's go, we'll raid these demons' lair," Zhao Xu said, tapping his finger on the forehead of the stunned Lü'er.

"Ah? Don't you want to confront them?" Lü'er asked with surprise.

This group of over a thousand people, including some of the top players in the game, couldn't help but be impressed by Zhao Xu's decision not to confront them.

To say the least, Zhao Xu was like the "senior" among them.

Zhao Xu shook his head slightly, "They're so brazen, killing without hesitation, and then they have the nerve to claim they're here to save you?"
Lü'er nodded, her face flushed with embarrassment.
Here is the translation of the text:

"That's it then," said Zhao Xu, patting her on the shoulder. "If it's not to rescue you, why are you worrying so much?"

"Oh," allowed to understand, "it's no wonder that you, the team leader, want to unleash this kind of continuous 'shattered storm' spell, which is not only to kill these demons but also to create a dead zone in this area, making them unable to pass through temporarily."

"I know now," she said.

Zhao Xu finished speaking and directly cast a "flying spell" on allowed, flying her to the demon's lair.

"Team leader, do you know the way?"

Allowed was fascinated and curious, as she had just been with Zhao Xu throughout the whole process, but how did the other person seem to understand the situation from start to finish without saying a word?

"That's what you think I just started fighting for no reason?" Zhao Xu smiled.

As he spoke, he waved his "authority stick" and said, "From the moment the battle started, I've been eyeing the demon and cast the 'modify memory' spell on it."

"I'm pointing to the memory of the 'lair', and naturally, I know it clearly now."

"Modify memory? What kind of spell is this?" allowed murmured to herself.

She suddenly felt like she had touched a dark secret.

"Modify memory, huh," Zhao Xu said nonchalantly.

"This is a four-ring poet spell, which can penetrate the recipient's mind, modifying a memory segment that lasts no more than five minutes."

"The specific implementation can directly erase all memories of an event or allow the recipient to clearly recall the entire experience, or modify the memory details, and even directly implant new information."
Here is the translation of the text:

"I just read it, so it didn't take me long to read it. If I really implanted the entire memory, it wouldn't be that fast."

Although Zhao Xu's description of the process seemed a bit flippant, as a listener, I couldn't help but feel a sense of trepidation in my heart.

"This method of modifying memories is a bit too abnormal, isn't it?" she couldn't help but joke.

"So, is there no pure land in this world?"

"No," Zhao Xu said lightly, wiggling her fingers. "For the entire Arthurian world, being a four-ring master is already a high level. Not to mention that this spell is a poet's four-ring spell, which ordinary poets can only master at level 10."

"If you really want to thoroughly modify memories, you'll have to rely on the nine-ring spell 'Memory Compilation', so it's not worth worrying about the collapse of Arthur's order."

"A level-five mage is already a top-level mage in terms of magical strength for a small country like Arthur."

The rapid leveling-up mode in the game has led many people to underestimate a four- or five-ring mage, who is considered a high-level mage in the entire Arthurian world.

It's like watching the news and thinking that a county-level official is just like that, but it's only when you really get in touch with them that you realize the energy of a county-level official.

"Shall we go to that den without hesitation?"

At this point, Er was still controlling the flying powers, soaring in the sky, but her heart was struggling to suppress her excitement.

Conquering the sky has always been a fundamental pursuit for humans.
Here is the translation:

"If you don't do that, there won't be so many people trying extreme sports like skydiving, which carries a high risk. "What's there to worry about with me around?" Zhao Xu said nonchalantly.

"Not really, Captain," Ren Yi replied, tilting her head, looking eager to learn. "Isn't it like kicking open a door, just going in without hesitation?"

Zhao Xu couldn't help but raise an eyebrow, knowing that he was curious about the existence of that "divine being", so he hurried to mislead Ren Yi.

Zhao Xu immediately explained, "It's not that simple."

"Before we venture out, we must do our homework and prepare the basics. We need to investigate the monster information in front of us and prepare the corresponding spells. For example, if there are undead creatures, we won't need to prepare mind-control spells like 'Sleep'."

As Zhao Xu spoke, his gaze turned towards the direction of the demon's lair, which was already within sight.

"If I reach level eight, I'll definitely prepare 'Final Judgment' spells targeting evil humanoid monsters, giants, or other humanoid creatures," he said, punching the air.

"When that time comes, I'll declare their crimes on the spot, shout 'I represent justice, I condemn you!' and then the heavenly judgment will descend upon the earth, taking away those evil giants, and their bodies will be sent to the underworld for eternal judgment."

Zhao Xu's eyes had already taken on a radiant glow, as if he had been preparing for this moment.

As he finished speaking, Zheng Xin Yi, who had been listening to his words, could only slightly curl up her lips, indicating that she had learned something."
Here is the translation:

"Simultaneously, we must also prepare for 'retreating from the battlefield'. After all, our lives only come once, just like the sudden arrival of a massive army of goblins. A qualified mage should cast an escape spell or control spell to block them at the moment they appear."

"For example, the 'Cloud Mist' spell is the most basic control spell. Sometimes, when a four-person adventure team suddenly encounters three goblins, the only way to escape is to cast the 'Cloud Mist' spell, which allows everyone to escape before the fog clears."

"...Oh, I finally understand."

Arthur's battles are, in fact, more pitiful.

"What's the latest method of escape, team leader?" he asked.

"This one," Zhao Xu replied, pulling out three small test tubes from his backpack.

These test tubes were perfectly sealed and filled with a liquid that resembled bright red blood.

"Owl, eagle, giant eagle?"

Zhao Xu read out the labels on the test tubes.

Then, he dripped three drops of blood from each tube onto his finger, merging them together. The entire process was done discreetly.

The next second, he pulled Allow to a descent, and they landed near a tree stump. Zhao Xu then drew a symbol full of blood significance on the stump with his index finger.

Allow didn't even have time to blink before the symbol disappeared, and then Zhao Xu pulled her back up into the air for flying.

Before Allow could ask a question, Zhao Xu explained:

"The spell I just cast is the 'Retreat Emblem' at the fifth circle. By touching the surface of a living object, I just created a secret seal (zero circle)".

Here is the translation of the text:

"This way, within the 24-hour duration of the spell, I can instantly transport myself to the marked location at any time, with an effect equivalent to a seven-ring high-speed transportation."

Allowing laughed, thinking it was some kind of magical effect, but it turned out to be just a high-speed transportation spell cast by a seven-ring mage. She shrugged and said, "But that's all there is to it, a mage can already cast transportation spells at the five-ring level."

Zhao Xuan chuckled silently and said, "You, a little girl with high aspirations but low abilities, should first receive a beating from life. To cast a five-ring spell quickly, you need to combine it with 'Instant Spell Release', otherwise it's just a nine-ring spell."

He also added, "Moreover, casting spells on inanimate objects does not mean they cannot move, so sometimes it's better to let animals or others carry them, which can have unusual effects."

Allowing finally understood Zhao Xuan's true intentions.

As they entered the depths of the mountain ahead, they began to transform into low-altitude flight.

At this point, they had already left the cavalry team far behind.

Zhao Xuan quickly found a hidden entrance to the mountain peak based on the memories of the flesh-eating demons, and directly opened the large stone to enter the tunnel with Allowing.

As the light from the eternal fire torch illuminated the rough stone path ahead, Allowing subtly narrowed her pupils to adapt to the light in the mountain valley.

"It's really the lair of the flesh-eating demons, and the air is filled with a foul odor."

Allowing thought to the scale of the flesh-eating demons and couldn't help but wonder, "Doesn't this mean that there is a huge underground city to accommodate these flesh-eating demons? It's no wonder they haven't been swept away by the waves of undead tides, and they're probably just hiding here to enjoy their retirement."
Here is the translation of the text:

As she spoke, her eyes were filled with curiosity, scanning the tunnel in every direction, "Why is it that these flesh-eaters don't seem to worry about the impending heavy rain? This is just the perfect place to set up a base, isn't it?" she said.

Zhao Xu shook his head, "Don't assume that we haven't thought about using these underground tunnels, caves, and the like as a place to stay. I can tell you that in a place where sunlight can't reach, the possibility of being affected by negative energy is also the highest."

As he spoke, Zhao Xu's eyes took on a cautious look.

"When that time comes, it won't be the time to become a skeleton. Instead, it will be a deep sleep, and who knows when we'll wake up again?"

Allowing to hear this, she couldn't help but shudder inwardly.

It was clear that this wasn't knowledge that had fallen from the sky, but rather the hard-won experience of someone who had endured great suffering.

The atmosphere suddenly became solemn once more.

"Will these flesh-eaters not suffer from such consequences?" Allowance asked.

"It's possible they won't," Zhao Xu replied, recalling their recent experience. "It seems that the 'divine being' gave them some kind of protection, allowing them to avoid such punishment."

"Of course, that's why everyone is mobilizing to search for a sacred artifact, and not even leaving a single guard behind."

At this point, Zhao Xu caught a whiff of the air, and a faint bloody scent wafted through. It wasn't human, but rather the scent of flesh-eaters.

As they walked, they found that the entire tunnel was filled with various shades of dark red, leaving behind countless screams and wounds. And yet, the flesh-eaters' bloody scent still managed to overwhelm the air.

Wasn't this evidence that something much larger had already occurred?

As they walked forward, they saw the entrance to the circular tunnel, as well as the weapon rack and the moving stone slab above. It was clear that if enemies were to attack, this place would be sealed off.

On either side of the road ahead, rows of prison cells began to appear.
Here is the translation of the text:

The two sides are made of thick wooden bars, with some weeds and dirt scattered inside. The stench is even more overwhelming, and it's clear that eating, drinking, and defecating are all taking place in there.

Suddenly, Allow's voice pierced the air, pointing straight at a cell. In this dark and shadowy place, there are four bodies, with three of them already lying motionless, their fate unknown.

The only one who looked slightly more robust was trembling incessantly, muttering incoherent words with their mouth. When they heard the sound of Zhao Xu and Allow's footsteps, the woman suddenly lifted her head, her originally terrified gaze suddenly transforming into immense joy upon seeing that the two of them were no more than two meters tall.

She continuously cleared her throat, trying to shout, but then quickly remembered that the cannibal guards might still be nearby, and only whispered softly, "Are you here to save us?"

As she spoke, her eyes were already streaming with tears, but her body was still struggling to suppress her sobs.

Although the woman's appearance was covered in dirt and dust, Zhao Xu vaguely recognized her, but couldn't quite put a name to her.

"Is that you? Ah, Rain from Pinkgirl!" Allow exclaimed, bursting into excitement, never expecting to run into her favorite idol singer in a post-apocalyptic world.

"This...," Zhao Xu looked at the scene, at a loss for words.
