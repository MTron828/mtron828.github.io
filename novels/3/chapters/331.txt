Chapter 332: Vice-Chairman of the Association

Leyen led Zhao Xu and others to the Sacred Heart Cathedral, where he immediately contacted the church as the liaison officer.

At that time, the mysterious being had transformed into someone, and no one knew what form it took or what identity it assumed. Everyone wanted to expose the mysterious being, but they were also worried about stirring up trouble.

As a result, the matter was still confined to the highest level and had not spread far.

Meanwhile, the "Peter" was taken to a more secluded location, and the association and the church sent out high-level forces to search and analyze Peter's memories in an effort to find clues about the possible hiding place of the mysterious being.

After a while, Leyen finally emerged, his face expressionless as he turned to Zhao Xu and said, "It's a bit complicated."

"How so?" Zhao Xu was taken aback to learn that even Leyen, a legendary strongman, had a question that could stump him.

At that moment, Zhao Xu's evaluation of the "divine attributes" buried in his heart rose slightly.

It was undeniable that the divine power level was higher.

"Leyen, it's impossible to replenish the deep-sea divine power in Arthur, and the mysterious being is likely to be favored by fate, even if it continues to use it for several years. Although the probability is high, it's probably being used sparingly."

Leyen gazed at the statue of the church's goddess and said this, showing no disrespect.

In Arthur, it was unthinkable to gaze at a goddess statue with lecherous eyes, and in the headquarters of this church, no one dared to throw a stone at Leyen.

"What are we going to do now?" Zhao Xu asked.

"It's tough." Lai An initially thought he had achieved a major accomplishment, but as he continued to interrogate Peter's information, he also began to understand the gravity of the situation.

"That Peter's ritual was originally intended to last until sunset today, and at that time, the demon will use special means to contact the other party. Once it realizes it can't establish contact, it will naturally know that Peter has failed, and it may directly flee a thousand miles away. The association and the church are planning to strike when the demon establishes contact, but I think the success rate is low."

"Why doesn't the church investigate?" Zhao Xu asked incredulously.

Suddenly, Lai An's expression changed, and he said, "Investigate? Let's see how to investigate. Just received the message and confirmed one thing. The demon is likely to perform a major action today and try to achieve everything in one go. So we suspect it is disguised as a priest in a certain temple and is currently in this church."

In a flash, Zhao Xu also understood that if the demon could disguise itself as a priest so easily, Arthur's entire church would likely have been breached long ago.

It's clear that the demon discovered the existence of something of great value and is planning to use up all the granted abyssal energy today, disguising itself as a priest in the Holy Heart Church and gradually implementing its secret plan.

Although Zhao Xu doesn't know where the demon's target is, time is running out, with sunset approaching.

Initially, the association planned to take action later, but it seems that this plan may not be effective at all. The demon may achieve its goal and then flee directly.

The church is unclear about which priest was replaced, and it's unable to spread this news.

"Confirmed, reconnaissance will be carried out in multiple directions." At this point, Lai An received the latest information from his communication magic, "Ah, unfortunately, we're too late to intervene. It's really like wearing someone else's clothes."
Here is the translation of the text:

Upon hearing Li An's sigh, the members of the small team didn't dare to approach and ask questions, but instead stood at the periphery, watching. "Have you found a way?" Zha Xu nodded slightly, implying that if the association and church couldn't find a countermeasure to deal with the demon within half an hour, they wouldn't be qualified to survive for a thousand years.

This was just a matter of closing the door and beating the dog, but it was necessary to be cautious of the novice priests and various buildings within the church, not to mention the "front door" behind it.

"The big boss of the deep abyss, Di Mu Gou Ren, has a symbol of a forked snake tail, usually wrapped around a long sword or skull. Another powerful deep abyss boss, Glazet, has a black six-fingered hand."

"Now, we need to urgently call back the mages and priests who have touched the deep abyss bosses in the past because they have touched divine power, and when they approach the demon, it will resonate and allow us to directly expose the demon's identity," Li An said with a sly smile. "The deep abyss power may be strong, but it's not without flaws."

"This won't it directly trigger a war?" Elliot suddenly realized what was about to happen.

"Yeah, but the demon's explosion will only last for an instant. To avoid suspicion, we won't have many people nearby to inspect, so we can just wait for a while and then have the main force arrive to take down the opponent."

"Aww, it's a shame. Capturing the demon in the church is a rare feat in the past decade. The church will definitely reward us heavily, and who knows, we might even get our hands on a divine artifact. How I wish I had thought of this earlier and touched the beard of the deep abyss boss."

Li An sighed, originally thinking he could get a big deal, but who would have thought he could only watch from the sidelines now.
Here is the translation of the text:

When the time comes for the demon lord to counterattack, he needs to hurry up and get there as fast as possible. Maybe he can salvage some of the demon lord's power.

As for Zhao Xu and the others, they don't need to consider anything else.

However, Zhao Xu hesitated and said, "Is it possible to just touch the power of the deep-sea lord? Or maybe even the intention behind it?"

"That's definitely the case," someone replied. "Another deep-sea lord once came to Arthur after he had consumed all the deep-sea power he had been carrying. He was then slaughtered. So, at present, no deep-sea lord dares to come to Arthur without his personal involvement. Naturally, everyone who has interacted with the deep-sea lord has only experienced the projection or intention."

"Deep in the abyss, those few people are like powerful forces, who lives and who dies, it's like a rhythm. You think everyone is like a strong mentor?" Lian Dong said with a sarcastic tone.

"Well, I had previously interacted with the intention of a certain enslaved nine-ring mage due to certain circumstances a few months ago," Zhao Xu said.

As soon as he heard this, Lian Dong's eyes lit up with excitement and he carefully scrutinized Zhao Xu, saying with excitement, "This feels like it can be a plan."

He paced back and forth in the courtyard of the church, lost in thought, planning the details of what was to come.

"Now, we are pretending to be the supervisors of the 'Judgment and Execution' department, conducting a routine conversation with the middle-level pastors of the church today. We will talk to each person separately."

This method is to integrate the investigation into normal routine business, making it difficult to arouse suspicion. The disadvantage is that it's slow, but this is also an opportunity for Zhao Xu and the others.

"Yes, this deal is worth doing," Lian Dong said after thinking for a moment. "You can follow me and be my deputy, and with the words of a few people in my team, even if the demon lord has legendary power, it won't be in vain."
Here is the translation of the text:

"The only question is that you're going to fight against the demon king, and no one can predict what his trump card is, not even if I use the 'Rainbow Ball' spell. You'll have to rely on yourself to adapt and respond."

"After all, it's easy to revive in the church, and you won't have to pay the price. The only question is that you'll have to make amends with that person from now on."

Zhao Xu couldn't help but laugh, as he had already offended "Gratz" and had taken back his soul from him.

This is a deeply humiliating behavior for demons or devils.

He basically owes a lot and has no worries.

"It seems you're planning to participate, so go ahead, I'll leave a big bonus for you."

As he said this, he directly opened a mental link and began to communicate with Zhao Xu.

"Summer, remember to pretend to be serious or actually put in effort, and release some spells. Don't just think about escaping."

Zhao Xu slightly tilted his head at the reminder from Lian.

What's the point?

"You're not a 5th-level mage, are you? Although theoretically, 5th-level mages will be expelled to train, but it's not a bad idea to continue training to level 6. You won't be able to receive the energy feedback if you don't put in effort to kill that 'demon king'."

"Energy feedback? Isn't it just a myth that you can level up by fighting monsters?"

Zhao Xu said bluntly, but he knew Lian would understand.

"You're not a breakthrough 4-ring, and it's natural to rise from 5 to 6 levels. Even if you don't have any accomplishments on the other side, it won't be a big problem. With accumulated energy, you can go up."

At this point, Lian showed a slightly envious expression.

"After you become 6th-level and achieve success, you'll have at least a 50% chance to be appointed as a deputy chief of a small town or something by the association."
Here is the translation:

When Zhao Xu heard this, he was a bit bewildered.

He didn't expect Lei An to give him a huge surprise.

A 6-star ring is indeed the minimum standard for the deputy chair of a normal association.

If Zhao Xu can smoothly take up this job, even if he is hiding in the background, he would have enough influence to manipulate some things.

In his past life, Zhao Xu was very clear about the extent to which the wizard association's influence could reach in a small town.

Even fifth or sixth-ring wizards wouldn't dare to bully him, because as long as they have a position, they are the face of the wizard association.

Especially now that Zhao Xu has a notebook that can help him level up, it's only a matter of time before he breaks through to the 4-star ring!

The 4-star ring is a limit that ordinary wizards without connections can't reach.

Moreover, the position of deputy chair of the association means that he can become a "high-level NPC" who can assign tasks to players.
