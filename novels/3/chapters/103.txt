Chapter 104: Moonlit Town

Moonlit Town is located on the outskirts of the Southern Forest, where Loia's merchant caravan deliberately took a detour to avoid the forest and ended up arriving near the forest. Many adventurers who obtained rewards in the Southern Forest will choose to trade and replenish their supplies in the nearby town.

Moonlit Town developed based on this situation, just like Kasa and Butan cities developed based on the Tian Duan Mountains.

"Are those ambushers okay?" Rainbow, the wandering adventurer, asked with concern.

Compared to the initial Golden Dragon's menacing aura, the ambushers who had slipped away from the valley became the real threat.

Now, it's likely that the surrounding towns have received the news and know that this smuggling caravan is approaching. They can easily calculate their journey from the size and time of the caravan.

Before saying that, it's possible that heavy troops have already been hidden in the Southern Forest, waiting for them to fall into the trap.

Zhao Xiu, who has done something similar in the past, comforted, "If Kasa and Butan only had our one caravan to transport goods, they would have surrendered earlier."

"That's right, the entire Tianbei Commercial Alliance is not just our one smuggling caravan in the past. It all depends on which caravan can successfully infiltrate and obtain the eternal friendship of Kasa and Butan," Poet Nan Jie Qingwa added.

"What are we doing here?" Yu Yu looked puzzled.

"Going to get something, I think," Maple Leaf whispered, as the fixed liaison between Loia and Isis, knowing many secrets.

"What's going on?" Yu Yu asked curiously, her eyes sparkling with curiosity.

"I don't know," Feng Ye said with a smile, scratching his head. "It's a secret, half-finished."

"Ah, for crying out loud, Feng Ye-ge, you're really stupid," Yu Yu said, rolling her eyes.

The entire merchant caravan had just started and was halted at the edge of the South Forest, seeking shelter behind a giant stone barrier. After a while, Luo Ya finally walked over, looking at Zhao Xu and Feng Ye. He was accompanied by several bodyguards, who stood guard around him.

"What do you want to ask, Mr. Luo Ya?" Feng Ye asked first.

Luo Ya paused for a moment. "I have something to entrust to you."

"According to the original plan, after we arrive at the Moon Bay Village, we need to go in and obtain a passage permit and some recent intelligence to arrange the next step."

"Passage permit?" Luo Ya's words had just fallen, and the few players around Feng Ye suddenly exclaimed in surprise, only to realize that the thing referred to was actually a passage permit.

This couldn't mean that their journey could be shortened by more than half, and they might not even need to hide by day and sneak by night.

However, Luo Ya shook his head. "The passage permit is fake, and we had to use it to deceive the scouts when they discovered it in the end."

The crowd fell silent, not expecting this outcome.

Now they had reached the range of Caso and Bunti cities.

The Northern Trade Alliance had not deployed too many defenses on the plain of the Great Rift Valley beforehand, partly because they were underprepared and partly because they were confident that they could blockade the two cities like a packet of noodles, ensuring that most of the goods would not enter.
Here is the translation of the text:

Without the passage documents, the risk of trying to break through the encirclement is very high. However, Zhao Xu was clear that the passage documents were their last trump card to fish in troubled waters, and if discovered, they would be crushed by the regular army and mercenaries of the Heaven's North Commercial Alliance. This was not comparable to the scattered troops they had encountered before, which still had some civilians who could be spared. Meanwhile, the Heaven's North Commercial Alliance was also recruiting players to join the pursuit and blockade. "Mr. Naloria, do you want us to go to Moon Bay to obtain the passage documents and intelligence?" Feng Ye reacted slowly, but still responded.

"No, I originally planned to have our wandering team go, but now the alliance has set a too high price, plus our previous encounter with the ambush team has blocked us, so it's possible that my and my fellow's intelligence has been obtained by the other side." Naloria bowed his head and said.

"Just Naloria, aren't we also leaking intelligence?" Yu Yu asked.

"No, Yu Yu, their intelligence and our intelligence are not the same concept," said Rainbow, who was a member of the Wandering Association and had some understanding of this aspect.

Naloria's information was already known to others, and even if this time the delivery was successful, he would have to avoid the limelight for a period of time until the conflict between Cassio and Brutus subsided.

As for the three players, those scattered troops would not be able to immediately figure out their players' backgrounds.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

It's not to say that even the iron stones that had once interacted with them had already died. "I accept this task," Maple Leaf thought for a moment before agreeing.

Entering a strange town as a player is a very reasonable thing, and even if they directly self-destruct, they will revive near the church in the nearest town. Many towns that understand this will not obstruct players too much.

Luo Ya's gaze fell on Zhao Xu, asking for his response. Zhao Xu thought for a moment and nodded in acceptance.

Moonlight Town will not produce another golden dragon, will it?

After discussing for a while, the three of Maple Leaf, Zhao Xu, and Rainbow decided that they would enter the town, find the contact person, and exchange goods through secret codes to obtain the designated items.

...The next morning, Zhao Xu and the two others had dressed up as adventurers who had spent the night outdoors in the southern forest.

Moonlight Town was bustling during the day. The gate where the exit was, had many merchants lining up to enter, all honestly paying their taxes and submitting their documents. However, the three adventurers, including Zhao Xu, took a different exit, carrying no more than necessary and not needing to pay taxes.

Moonlight Town had abolished the entrance tax for new arrivals when it was first established, which was the reason why many adventurers chose it and allowed it to flourish.

Although Zhao Xu and the two of them were a bit unusual compared to those who chose to venture out, there were many like them who came from other towns every day, which did not attract much attention from the guards. The guards roughly examined them for a moment, confirmed that they were earth adventurers, and let them pass.
Here is the translation of the text:

"I'm going to go to the wizard's guild to buy some materials, you guys wait for me to get back."

Zao XÃ¹ walked down the central street of the small town, but he suddenly noticed a tall building not far away that was covered in mysterious symbols. The area around the building was empty, as if there was some kind of plague that made people afraid to get close.

As he approached the building, he noticed that it was the location of the wizard's guild. He didn't expect to find a wizard's guild in a small town like Moonlight Town.
