Chapter 1289 - You’re So Big Now!

Once one’s cultivation reached the divine way, their body could exist within the vacuum of space with no repercussions. But this was the first time that Yun Che had truly travelled through the starry expanse of the universe.

As time quietly flowed by, the two people had lost count of how many stars they had passed by as the Vanishing Moon Celestial Palace continued flying forward.

“So it turns out that all the strange situations that you kept finding yourself in in the past were actually because the Heavenly Slaughter Star God was by your side.”

“Weren’t the things that happened to you even more inconceivable?” Yun Che said with a small chuckle. “This world is so big, yet sometimes, it’s so very small.” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“When we got married all those years ago, you were still only in the Elementary Profound Realm. Yet in a short two decades, you have already become the Eastern Divine Region’s ‘Conferred God Number One’.” She looked at Yun Che while speaking in a heartfelt voice, “Perhaps, you truly are as they say... the child of the heavens.”

“That’s definitely not the case,” Yun Che said with an extremely nimble wave of his hand. What child of the heavens? Those nine rounds of tribulation lightning were clearly desperately and frantically trying to strike him to death, but in the end, it could do nothing but helplessly tremble beneath the might of the Evil God as it dissipated powerlessly. But in the eyes of the world and coupled with the words of those three old con men from the Heavenly Mystery Realm, it was as if that nine stage lightning tribulation had announced the birth of the “child of the heavens” to the world.

“During the last few years, have you never thought of returning to the Profound Sky Continent?” Yun Che asked.

“There was not a single moment or time that I did not feel like returning,” Xia Qingyue said with a sigh. “But, I did not dare to. I was afraid that foster father was still angry with my father... and even the Profound Sky Continent itself.”

“...” Yun Che gave a faint nod of his head as he gave a heavy sigh in his heart. He understood all too well what Xia Qingyue was feeling, because the current him was unable to return home either.

They were not those old monsters who had already lived for tens of thousands of years, who had grown more and more indifferent to things like feelings and emotions.

“Then what about you?” Xia Qingyue asked.

“I was supposed to go back within the next two years, but...” Yun Che helplessly shook his head, “I created far too great a commotion, so it can’t be helped anymore. I will be entering the Eternal Heaven Pearl next, and I will have to wait at least three years before I can try to find an opportunity to return.”

When the two of them had first arrived at the God Realm, they had never thought that they would actually somehow, within a few short years, actually be able to reach a height where they were able to move the clouds within the Eastern Divine Region... At the same time, it had also saddled them with a multitude of heavy burdens and worries.

“If we have such an opportunity, let’s go back together,” he softly said as he looked at the side of Xia Qingyue’s face.

“...” Xia Qingyue remained silent for a long time before she finally gave a light nod of her head, “Alright.”

Can I still even return... She closed her eyes and was not able to find herself within her own heart and soul... Today’s choice had protected Yun Che’s dignity yet it had also cause her to turn her back on the foster father to whom she owed a mountain of gratitude, and her own birth mother. It had also caused her to become the great sinner of the entire Moon God Realm.

I no longer have the right to live for my own sake for the rest of my life...

During the time she lapsed into deep silence, Yun Che had always been silently looking at her.

They left Divine Moon City more than twenty hours ago, so their hearts and minds had already grown calm quite a while back. But, from the start to the end, he could sense the heavy aura of melancholy that shrouded Xia Qingyue’s body... and this aura had not even lessened by a single degree.

“Qingyue, I know that, right now, the only thing that is dominating your thoughts is how to ‘atone for your sins’ after you return.” Yun Che’s words broke the train of Xia Qingyue’s thoughts. He crossed both hands over his chest and said with the resolute manner of a husband, “Do not always think of taking it on all by yourself. You’re not that self-sacrificing, nor do you need to be that self-sacrificing. Since you still consider me your husband, then don’t you think that relying on me is only natural?”

“I already said that this has nothing...”

“Whether it has anything to do with me is for me to decide,” Yun Che cut her off before a very relaxed and confident smile played across his lips. “Perhaps you’re worried that the Moon God Emperor will kill me with a single slap the moment he sees me. But don’t forget that I am still slapped with the label of the “child of the heavens”. As long as he does not completely lose his sense of rationality, he is unlikely to go so far as to wantonly kill me without clearing up matters first... Furthermore, I do have a plan that will not only calm his anger, but it might just end up with him feeling grateful towards me in the end.”

“So, you don’t need to bring me to the Eternal Heaven Realm first. Instead, it will be I who accompanies you to the Moon God Realm first.”

“?” Xia Qingyue’s beautiful eyes swivelled towards him. Yun Che did not seem to be faking his confident and composed look so she asked, “What plan?”

Yun Che’s plan was naturally to use the Great Way of the Buddha to replenish Yue Wugou’s lifeforce. However, he did not intend to say it, because it was something that even the Moon God Emperor was unable to accomplish, so just why would the rest of the world believe that he could do it just because he said so. Furthermore... he was also afraid that Yue Wugou’s condition was far more serious than he currently anticipated and at that time, it would instead cause Xia Qingyue to lose the very last bit of hope that she held in her heart.

“Of course, it’s to send him a great gift that he will definitely be overjoyed with.” Yun Che thought about it for a moment and his eyes faintly flashed as he spoke with a mysterious look on his face, “Cough, this great present is rather unique, so I will only be able to tell you if you close your eyes.”

Xia Qingyue’s delicate brows gently drew together. It seemed as if she really wanted to know the method that “Yun Che” had mentioned, so she complied with his words and closed her eyes.

The beauty had closed her eyes and the clean and bright light of the Celestial Palace illuminated her body, it was as if she was a painting of a peerlessly beautiful goddess illuminated by moonlight, as she floated down to earth. Her robes were as white as snow, yet they paled in comparison to her beautiful skin which, was as lustrous as white jade and as smooth as rouge.

She simply stood there quietly, her breathtaking beauty and grace assaulted him head on. She was as beautiful as a fairy and even the words “transcending all conventional understanding” would barely be able to describe her!

Twelves years ago, Xia Qingyue was already beautiful enough to cause the ruin of cities and countries, and her current beauty had transcended this earthly world to an even greater degree. Even Yun Che had instances where he could not quite believe that this person was actually his wife.

Unfortunately for him, he had not touched her once over the past twelve years!!

He took a few steps forward before arriving in front of the completely defenceless Xia Qingyue and wrapped an arm around her waist. He did not wait for Xia Qingyue to react, planting a heavy kiss on her lips.

As those four lips came into contact with each other, Yun Che felt as if the lips he was kissing were just like orchid jade ointment. They were warm, soft, and satiny but they were also tinged with a sweet moist chill.

Xia Qingyue’s beautiful eyes widened into circles, her entire body suddenly went rigid, and she was about to involuntarily let out a sound but just as her pearly teeth parted, Yun Che took the opportunity to push his tongue inside. His tongue touched her fragrant tongue which wriggled around helplessly as he plundered a mouthful of her flavor.

“Wu...”

Xia Qingyue let out a startled whimper as her delicate body once again went stiff, as if an electric current had run through her body. Her mind went completely blank for a few breaths before she finally thought of resisting. But the resistance that she put up while her heart and mind were in complete chaos was not to push Yun Che away with all her might. It was to panickedly use her pink tongue to push against Yun Che’s tongue in an attempt to force it back into his own lips.

Her small tongue was smooth and tender, so rather than saying that she was resisting, her actions, in actual fact, seemed to be bashfully egging him on.

The soft and delicate body in his arms had gone completely limp, and it was lushly curved in an extremely enticing manner. Yun Che’s hand was wrapped around her waist and even though their skin was separated by a layer of cloth, it still felt as if he was caressing the most perfect warm jade in this mortal world. As Xia Qingyue continued to resist, their tongues continued to tangle together ceaselessly. The fragrant saliva that flowed from her mouth to his caused him to continuously tighten his grip on her waist as he hungered even more to wantonly violate every corner of her open mouth.

Finally, following an anxious gasp from Xia Qingyue, her pearly teeth fiercely bit down on Yun Che’s tongue...

“AHH!!”

Yun Che let out a strangled cry and he finally withdrew his tongue. After that, he was pushed back several steps by Xia Qingyue’s weak and helpless push. He covered his mouth and sucked in a breath before saying with widened eyes, “Xia Qingyue, are you some sort of dog?”

“You...” Xia Qingyue’s face was flushed red as she kept gasping softly, even her hair was in some disarray. There was a trace of fresh blood inside her mouth and it was clear that Yun Che’s tongue had been bitten so hard that she had broken the skin. Furthermore, this bit of blood caused her already chaotic mental state to become even more helpless as she swallowed it in a daze.

She had never thought that Yun Che would have so much guts. She had expected even less that he would suddenly...

Compared to Xia Qingyue’s disordered aura, Yun Che finally sucked in a breath fiercely, but his face was not red nor was his heart thumping in his chest. On the contrary, he said in an exaggeratedly obsequious way, “So do you suddenly feel better?”

“...” He had clearly just assaulted her all of the sudden, yet he was acting as if he was helping her dispel some of her woes. In a huff of anger, Xia Qingyue directly turned around, not wanting Yun Che to see her helpless expression.

However, the worries in her heart had indeed somehow grown a lot lighter.

“It can’t be that she’s really angry, right?” Yun Che quietly made a small grin as he howled in his heart, “Twelve years, Twelve years! I finally kissed her for the first time... So of course I have to kiss her more fiercely.”

Eh... This could probably considered a big step forward, right?

Xia Qingyue remained silent... If Yun Che had been standing in front of her, he would see that her chest was still violently heaving.

“We have been husband and wife for twelve years already, but it has always been in name only. So you couldn’t... actually really be angry because of just this, right?” Yun Che’s voice grew much softer as it started to sound a bit resigned... and even aggrieved?

“...”

Xia Qingyue’s chest rose and fell yet again. Her expression finally started to relax, but her mouth and lips were still filled with the sensation of Yun Che’s touch and his flavor. It would not go away, no matter what. After hearing Yun Che’s words, she felt some guilt appear in her heart and she said in a soft voice, “I’m sorry... I’m still not used to it.”

“There’s no problem, you can slowly get used to it!” Yun Che swiftly replied. But after that, it seemed as if he realized those words were not appropriate so his voice obediently grew softer again, “What I meant was... After this instance, if you’re not willing, I definitely won’t do it again. But... can I just hug you for a while instead?”

After hearing Yun Che’s careful and somewhat pathetic request, Xia Qingyue simply could not get angry with him. On the contrary, her heart was filled with guilt towards him... Yes, she was his wife after all...

“Mn,”She gave an extremely soft reply but she did not turn around.

Yun Che moved forward and arrived at her back, his arms wrapping around her waist in a gentle embrace... The moment his arms were about to fold around her, the corner of his mouth crooked up. His hands conveniently moved higher and he spread his fingers wide as he firmly grasped Xia Qingyue’s towering bosom.

Immediately, his hands deeply sank into two extremely soft and full pillows. When he used strength, the rich and full jade flesh stood out against the soft and smooth moon robes as it spilled over his five fingers... his palms simply could not hold it all.

Xia Qingyue’s entire body went stiff again. Following that, her moon robes flared and a gigantic force fiercely smashed against Yun Che’s chest, sending him flying far away. He somersaulted in the air before landing heavily on his butt.

But Yun Che did not immediately choose to stand up. Instead, he simply sat there, as he stared at his hands which had just gotten away with murder with a mystified expression on his face. After that he raised his head sharply and said in an amazement, “Qingyue, you’re actually already... this big!”

All those years ago, the sixteen year old Xia Qingyue was already beginning to blossom into womanhood... It had been an estimate based on his observations, but there was indeed already some signs of it all those years ago.

But just now, the sensation that he had felt was a sensation that was incomparably lush and full. All ten of his fingers had sunk deeply in and it did not seem as if he had reached the end...

Even though the moon-white long robes she wore floated around her body like she was a celestial fairy, they were exceptionally loose. So even though her bosom towered towards the heavens, it was hard to tell. Yun Che had definitely not thought of it either, but after a few years of not seeing her, Xia Qingyue... had practically grown enough that she could be compared to Mu Xuanyin.

(Yun Che: Hey? Why did I just think of Master just now?)

“You...” Xia Qingyue continued to retreat several steps, her arms subconsciously held the front of the portion of her body that had just been violated. Her snowy mien was both panicked and confused, her eyes wavering between timidity and fury. The soft chest that had just started to calm down once again started to heave violently, and her gasping had become multiple times heavier.

Furthermore, the words that Yun Che had just said caused her heart to become so confused that she very nearly went into a daze.

Just as she was about to scold him, her eyes suddenly focused and fixed themselves on the curtain of light in front of them, “What... is that?”

Within the curtain of light, a faint golden light was swiftly drawing near to them from far away.
