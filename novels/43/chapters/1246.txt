Chapter 1244 - Rematch

The entire place was dead silent and no one responded to what had just happened.

Everyone’s eyes were filled with a deep fear, it was as if they were looking at a monster that should not even be able to exist in this world.

Luo Changsheng’s face was as white as a sheet as he stared dazedly at Yun Che. He barely responded to the words that were said to him.

That dreadful heavenly might had even broken the courage of all the gathered Divine Masters and Divine Sovereigns, much less Luo Changsheng who had just stepped into the Divine King Realm.

Furthermore, Yun Che had actually survived despite being beset by this heavenly might. In fact, he was standing there, right before them, in the flesh.... Not a single person could bring themselves to believe what they were seeing. It was much easier for them to believe that the Yun Che currently in their vision was no more than a transient illusion.

“Luo Changsheng...” Yun Che’s voice boomed like muffled thunder, shaking the souls of countless trembling individuals, “the fight between us still hasn’t ended... So let’s go!!”

Luo Changsheng’s pupils contracted and his lips faintly trembled. It looked as if he wanted to say something but he could not make a single sound.

“Big Brother Yun, put on some clothes first! It’s so embarrassing I could die!”

The free-spirited and beautiful voice of a young girl clearly rang out in the air at this moment. This voice had an instantaneous effect as it roused the souls of all who were present. In fact, it was as if a stream of clear and clean spring water had been poured into the chaotic and suffocated space.

Shui Meiyin’s coquettish shout stunned Yun Che, because it was only now that he realized that he was actually standing there buck naked while facing every living being in the entire Eastern Divine Region. His arm moved with lightning speed and a new ice phoenix snow robe garbed his body immediately, the sleeves of his new robe were wildly fluttering in the air as pale white lightning continued to play around them.

Even though Yun Che’s skin was as thick as a city wall and his soul had just gone through a transformation as well, he could not help but feel his face flush with heat.

Shui Meiyin had not let out any ordinary shout. In fact, what she had released was the Stainless Soul Sound that could cleanse one’s heart and soul. This allowed everyone present to quickly recover from the fear and shock that had been evoked by both the tribulation lightning and seeing Yun Che emerge alive respectively.

The muscles on the Eternal Heaven God Emperor’s face were clearly twitching as he extended a hand towards where Yun Che was standing. But before he had completely extended his arm, he withdrew it and instead spoke with deeply furrowed eyebrows, “Yun Che, you... How are you still alive? How exactly did you survive that?”

They had just personally experienced the true might of that white-colored tribulation lightning. The barrier that had been forged from the combined power of the gathered god emperors, Divine Masters, and Divine Sovereigns had been shattered by a single blow from that heavenly might... and that was just from the excess power that had spilled over.

If one was located in the eye of the storm, the point at which all of that heavenly might was focused, the Eternal Heaven God Emperor did not doubt in the least that even a Divine Master would have been instantly reduced to nothingness under that kind of power.

As for Yun Che, he was only a Divine Tribulation Realm profound practitioner. Furthermore, he had just been beaten within an inch of his life by Luo Changsheng... He had suffered such a terrible defeat at the hands of Luo Changsheng that he could not even retaliate, so just how then could he have survived that dreadful lightning tribulation!?

He was unable to bring himself to believe this. He was simply unable to believe that such a thing had happened, no matter how much he tried.

But what was even greater than his disbelief was his inability to understand or reason out what had just transpired.

Not only was Yun Che alive and kicking, he actually did not look the least bit hurt!

The peerlessly dreadful nine stage lightning tribulation was far too frenzied and not more than fifteen minutes had passed since the first stage of tribulation lightning had started until now.

But before these fifteen minutes had passed, it would have been hard-pressed to find a single uninjured part on his body... Within the short span of fifteen minutes, even the Divine Water of Absolute Beginning or the Great Firmament Golden Pellet would not be able to heal a person to this extent.

Also, that pale white lightning that played across his body... That was lightning that belong the ninth stage of tribulation lightning and the dreadfulness of that lightning still left a profound fear in the Eternal Heaven God Emperor’s heart.

This pale white lightning which had yet to dissipate represented the highest level of heavenly might in this universe, yet it had actually wrapped itself around Yun Che’s body in an incomparably docile and meek fashion. Without even mentioning his actual body itself, even the snowy robes he had just donned had not suffered the slightest bit of damage—In fact, the lightning that played around his body only looked like ordinary light without any ability to kill or injure, but the moment the Eternal Heaven God Emperor’s eyes made contact with that white light, his heart and soul could not help but violently shake as fear and dread overtook him.

“...” Yun Che did not reply, and in fact, he was unable to reply.

The Dragon Monarch gave Yun Che a deep look before suddenly speaking, “Yun Che and Luo Changsheng’s battle was interrupted due to the lightning tribulation and even though Luo Changsheng has already left the confines of the Conferred God Stage, that was due to an unavoidable and dare I say, irresistible, interference, so it cannot count as his defeat. Which is also to say that this Conferred God Battle is not yet finished.”

The eyes of the Eternal Heaven God Emperor shifted to the side as he said, “The esteemed Dragon Monarch’s means to say?”

“Nine tribulations descending from the heavens, that is something that has not happened even in ancient times. This proves that Yun Che’s talent and potential is unique and unmatched. But compared to him alone, the final battle of this Profound God Convention is doubtlessly far more important. As for the rest of the details, let’s leave them until later!” the Dragon Monarch said in an incomparably calm and unperturbed voice.

Every single one of the Dragon Monarch’s words were as heavy as a boulder.

The Eternal Heaven God Emperor was briefly startled by those words, but after that, he gave a nod of understanding and assent before declaring in a deep voice, “Qu Hui!”

Honorable Qu Hui was ultimately still Honorable Qu Hui. No matter what the circumstances were, he was a person that would follow the rules and regulations to their utmost limit. In a flash, he arrived before the area where the Conferred God Stage should have been. His hand pulsed with profound light and a pure white barrier immediately formed under his feet. The barrier started to spread until it covered the one hundred and fifty kilometer area that had made up the Conferred God Stage, covering up the empty space that had been created by the lightning tribulation.

Just like that, an entirely new one hundred and fifty kilometer “Conferred God Stage” had been created!

Under the power of the Honorable Qu Hui, this arena, that had been formed by a profound energy barrier, was far more sturdy than even the actual Conferred God Stage.

“Luo Changsheng, the battle between you and Yun Che has not yet ended. Just now, the two of you were interrupted by that lightning tribulation. But now that the lightning tribulation has finished, both of you should continue from where you left off. Make haste and enter the arena. However, you can also choose to reject this suggestion, and if that is the case, it will be viewed as you abandoning the fight and admitting your defeat.”

The sonorous voice of Honorable Qu Hui remained the same as ever, as he pronounced those words with a cold detachment.

The shock that nine stages of tribulation lightning had brought about was still fresh in everyone’s mind and still left them reeling from its impact. But before they could even catch a break and rouse themselves, their attention was now suddenly redirected back to the Conferred God Battle.

However, these were the words and the decision of the Dragon Monarch and the Eternal Heaven God Emperor respectively. Moreover, all that had been said and done were within reason.

At that moment, they remembered how Luo Changsheng had Yun Che completely ground under his heel just a moment ago. To all who were present, that very real scenario now seemed much like a dream.

Countless gazes turned toward where Luo Changsheng was, but he still stood there unmoving.

“Luo Changsheng,” Yun Che said with narrowed eyes, his deep voice booming in the air, “it can’t be that you... don’t dare to fight me, right!?”

These words had undoubtedly fiercely agitated Luo Changsheng. His blankly staring eyes fiercely regained their focus and his chest rose and fell as his lips hooked up with the trace of a smile, “Me.... Afraid... of... you!?”

“Changsheng!” Luo Guxie grabbed him anxiously as she said in a low voice, “The lightning aura around Yun Che is extremely bizarre, let’s not make any hasty....”

Before Luo Guxie could even finish her statement, Luo Changsheng had already shrugged her off abruptly, and taken to the skies. He flew across the distance and landed in front of Yun Che.

Both participants stared at each other, their gazes colliding. But, unlike before, this time Luo Changsheng’s eyes were involuntarily quivering, whereas Yun Che’s eyes were a sea of icy indifference.

Zzzt... zzzt... zzzzzt...

The sound of the crackling lightning was exceptionally jarring to the ear. Luo Changsheng stood only thirty meters distant from Yun Che but the moment his eyes made contact with that pale white lightning, a sensation that felt as if a thousand iron needles were stabbing into his soul ran through his body. What was even more bizarre than this was the fact that he actually could not sense Yun Che’s aura at all... Not only could he not sense his profound energy, he could not even sense the aura of his life force.

Furthermore, it was not only him, even his master Luo Guxie and the gathered god emperors themselves could not sense Yun Che’s aura... The layer of pale white lightning that covered his body had completely sealed off Yun Che’s profound energy and life force from detection and even the spiritual perception of a Divine Master was unable to penetrate it.

“...” The rising and falling of Luo Changsheng’s chest become more and more violent. His heart could not stop its frantic rhythm, it was beating so fast that it threatened to leap out of his chest.

Not more than fifteen minutes ago, he had completely dominated Yun Che and had forced him to the edge of despair and desperation. Yun Che had been his chew toy but right now, his body and soul were being invaded by a dread he could not control... A gigantic difference in ability had naturally given birth to enormous humiliation.

He was the Luo Changsheng who had become a Divine King, the youngest Divine King in the history of the entire Eastern Divine Region, the best and most incredible genius! So how could he display fear in front of a person who had just survived a lightning tribulation, someone he had been wantonly trampling all over just a moment ago!?

It was even more impossible for him to retreat or lose to this person!

No matter what, he could not... there was no reason for him to retreat or to lose!

He steeled his nerves as he fiercely bit down on the tip of his tongue and forcefully straightened his back. He wore a bland smile on his face, the kind of smile that the strong showed in front of the weak, “Ah, Yun Che, you have once more given me an enormous and delightful surprise. Heh, nine stage lightning tribulation, magnificent... truly magnificent!”

Yun Che, “...”

“I have no choice but to confess that you will very possibly be my superior in the future. But that’s too bad, because that will be in the future.” Luo Changsheng’s lips drew back slightly to form the trace of a twisted grin... It was as if to tell Yun Che that it was a mystery whether he would even have a future.

“But the current you... Let’s not even talk about the nine stage lightning tribulation, even if it was ten stages, no, one hundred stages, you are still someone who has just survived his lightning tribulation and stepped into the Divine Spirit Realm. So you surely can’t be so naive as to think that the current you has the qualifications to be my opponent, correct?”

Yun Che did not say a word, but a cold light that pierced one’s marrow flashed in the depths of his cold eyes.

Honorable Qu Hui furrowed his brows before giving a wave of his hands, “The final battle of the Conferred God Battle hereby continues! The rules are the same as before! Begin!”

It was very clear that Luo Changsheng had managed to convince himself with what he had just said. The fact that “Yun Che had just entered the Divine Spirit Realm” was a fact that became prominent and deeply embedded in Luo Changsheng’s psyche. His gaze started to grow confident as he dismissively extended his hand towards Yun Che, “As a Divine King, it’s beneath my dignity to take the initiative to attack someone who has just entered the Divine Spirit Realm. Come, attack me with all your power. Let me take a good look at just how much improvement you’ve made just now.”

Yun Che still did not say anything in response to Luo Changsheng. Instead, he slowly raised his hand and pointed a finger at him.

Zzzt!

A soft whinny of crackling lightning rang out in the air. A bolt of white lightning swiftly shot out of the tip of his finger...

And in the next instant, that bolt of lightning pierced through Luo Changsheng’s body.

Luo Changsheng did not even react in time to that attack, he only felt a part of his chest grow cold. After that, an intense pain assaulted him. He involuntarily looked down, and to his surprise, he found a bloody hole in his chest

A bloody hole that ran all the way through his body.

Luo Changsheng’s pupils instantly contracted into pinpricks and all the profound practitioners surrounding the Conferred God Stage were completely stunned by what had just happened.

There had been no movement or surging of profound energy in the air, it had merely been a flash of lightning, yet Luo Changsheng’s body had been pierced through... This was a Divine King’s spiritual perception and body we were talking about, yet Luo Changsheng did not even react, and the profound energy that protected his body seemed practically non-existent to that attack. In fact, it had not even made any sort of sound or struggle when it had been pierced.

Fresh blood finally gushed out of that wound as Luo Changsheng gave a low moan and pressed with his hand... The bloody hole was not very big, and to a Divine King, it was not even considered a serious wound. But this wound dealt a devastating blow to Luo Changsheng’s heart and soul.

Yun Che’s finger made a slight movement as lightning flashed on the tips of fingers. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

BANG!!

Yet another bloody hole appeared on Luo Changsheng’s body, this time piercing through the right side of his chest. Luo Changsheng let out a pained moan as he stumbled backwards. He once more felt the intense pain and the cold sensation of being pierced through, and his heart violently clenched in his chest...

His spiritual perception still did not react to this attack and the protective profound energy still seemed to put up no resistance whatsoever.

“You...” He stared at Yun Che, his body actually involuntarily shivering. But his fear soon turned into humiliation before turning into an incomparably intense rage. He gave a low bellow as a gray light flashed. The Dragon Compassion Blade appeared in his hand as the power of a Divine King violently surged up in his entire body, and he sent a ferocious slash at Yun Che.

In the previous bout against Yun Che, Luo Changsheng was afraid that he would accidently inflict a fatal slash on Yun Che, so from the beginning to the end, he never used more than thirty percent of his power. But this particular slash was an attack that had been provoked by the formless dread, so it carried all of his explosive power as a Divine King. The Dragon Compassion Blade left chaotic dimensional ripples in its wake as it whistled through the air.

If this was the Yun Che of fifteen minutes ago, this attack would definitely kill him.

But despite facing the all out attack of Luo Changsheng, Yun Che did not move from where he was standing. Instead, he merely raised his right arm up slowly as he lightly opened his fingers to welcome the Dragon Compassion Blade, that was hurtling towards him, as it slashed through the empty air.

This scene was so shocking it caused everyone’s heart to leap in their chests.

“Yun Che, he... Could it be that he wants to...”

Yun Che’s actions caused Luo Changsheng’s pupils to widen. With a low roar, the blade which was full of the power of a Divine King actually grew fiercer by yet another degree, “You’re looking for death!!”
