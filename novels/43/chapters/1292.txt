Chapter 1290 - Annihilating Stars

In order to reduce the fuel consumption of the Vanishing Moon Celestial Palace, Xia Qingyue had already deliberately reduced its flight speed, but the speed it was running at was still extremely fast. Yet that golden light, which had appeared in the curtain of light, was not only drawing closer, but it was doing so at an astonishing pace as it rapidly whittled away the distance between it and the Vanishing Moon Celestial Palace.

Profound light flashed in Xia Qingyue’s hand as the projection displayed on the curtain of light immediately zoomed in on the golden light, and a blurry human figure appeared on it. It was at this moment that Yun Che also strode forward... the figure displayed in the curtain of light was growing clearer and clearer. Gradually, he was able to make out the image of a woman dressed in luxurious golden robes, her face clearly covered by a golden mask that was shaped like wings.

Those golden robes, the exceedingly beautiful curves of that lush figure, and that golden mask which covered more than half of her face...

Yun Che’s brow jumped up fiercely, “Qianye Ying’er!?”

“...You’re saying that it’s the Brahma Monarch Goddess?” Xia Qingyue said with faintly furrowed brows, “Why would she be in this place?”

There was nobody in the God Realm who had not heard of the Brahma Monarch Goddess’ name. But they had already left the Eastern Divine Region, so why would she appear here? Was it a coincidence?

“That’s not right, there are two people!” Yun Che abruptly said. As they grew closer and closer and their figures grew clearer and clearer, it was then that Yun Che noticed that there was a gray-colored figure trailing behind Qianye Ying’er. Dressed in gray robes, he was extremely thin and weak-looking. It seemed as if his very being was blending together with the space around him, and his presence was extremely weak and thin. He was so easy to miss that Yun Che and Xia Qingyue had not even noticed his existence until now.

The warning that Shui Qianhang had deliberately sent to him via sound transmission flashed into his mind at this moment. Yun Che’s expression changed dramatically as he anxiously shouted, “She’s rushing straight for us, we need to go faster!!”

Xia Qingyue’s eyes focused and she immediately made a gesture with her hand, causing the speed of the Vanishing Moon Celestial Palace to spike... But in nearly the same instant, that gray-robed elder extended an arm and made a casual pushing motion.

BZZN——

A dreadful explosion suddenly appeared in the vast and empty vacuum of space and a tornado began to coalesce after that. It was just like a legendary cosmic hurricane as it caused thousands of kilometers of space to shudder violently.

In a split second, the Vanishing Moon Celestial Palace had become a dried leaf tossed about in a storm. The internal space within the profound warship was shaking even more violently and the flow of air within the space was thrown into complete chaos. What seemed like ear-piercing wails of lament rang from all four corners of the world. It took more than ten breaths later before the Vanishing Moon Celestial Palace finally regained its equilibrium and started moving forward again at the fastest speed it could muster.

Yun Che gasped roughly as he looked at the light curtain behind them... and an incomparably terrifying scene appeared before his eyes.

This was the greatest and most terrible storm he had ever seen in his entire life. Within the storm, layers upon layers of space were fragmented into tiny pieces as countless black holes were formed in those rips of space. There was also a small star nearby that was bodily forced from its orbit by the storm.

To be able to move the very stars themselves with a wave of his hand... A scene that had been described only in myth and legend unfolded before Yun Che and Xia Qingyue’s very eyes, filling them with so much shock that they felt like nothing would shock them after witnessing it.

If not for the fact that Xia Qingyue had raised the speed of the Vanishing Moon Celestial Palace to its maximum the instant before he had made his move, it was extremely likely that the Vanishing Moon Celestial Palace would have been caught in the eye of the storm. The results of that would be unthinkable.

Even though they had received an extremely big shock, in the end, they had been more scared than in any actual danger. There were also no signs that the Vanishing Moon Celestial Palace had sustained any damage... But if this had not been the Vanishing Moon Celestial Palace and it had been any other profound warship, even if it was the Divine Martial Realm’s Divine Martial Heavenly Palace, it would also have been smashed to smithereens.

Yun Che heavily gritted his teeth as he felt cold air radiate from his body... What kind of person was this old man? Even the strength of a god emperor was not so powerful, right!?

If the words he had said previously were only conjecture, then right now, that conjecture had completely morphed into stone-cold reality. Qianye Ying’er was indeed coming right at them!

“What do they want to do?” Xia Qingyue’s eyebrows knitted together tightly, she was now far too busy to bother about the fact that Yun Che just violated her moments ago.

“They’re coming for me!” Yu Che said through gritted teeth. But he was mistaken this time around, Qianye Ying’er wasn’t coming for him alone, she was coming for both of them!

“Why?”

“Of course, it’s to snatch me back to be her man! The fact that she tried to broker a marriage between her and myself is something that the entire God Realm knows about already! It must be because her humiliation from being rejected by me has now turned to fury, so she wants to force herself on me! Hss!”

“......”

Xia Qingyue was in no mood for jokes at thist moment. After she had raised the Vanishing Moon Celestial Palace’s speed to its maximum limit... the gold and gray figures depicted in the curtain of light were finally not drawing any closer, but neither were they growing further away.

A strange equilibrium was formed between the speed of the two parties.

This scene caused the hearts of both Yun Che and Xia Qingyue to lurch violently.

When the Vanishing Moon Celestial Palace had been moving at its maximum speed, even Golden Moon God Yue Wuji, whose speed within the Moon God Ream was only inferior to the Moon God Emperor himself, had slowly been shaken off. Yet they were unable to shake off the two people on their tail despite moving at that exact same speed.

Their power was actually above that of a Moon God’s!?

“Qianye Ying’er’s title as the ‘Goddess’ is something that I heard countless times in just my first year within the God Realm,” Xia Qingyue said. “But to think that her cultivation is already so high that it has reached this level?”

As the new master of the Vanishing Moon Celestial Palace, she was far more clear than Yun Che on just how terrifying a notion it was to be able to pursue the Vanishing Moon Celestial Palace.

In the entire Eastern Divine Region, there definitely weren’t more than ten people who could do so.

But they had met one of those ten, in fact, they had met two of the ten in this one instance.

“I heard my master tell me before that it was very likely that Qianye Ying’er’s cultivation was nearing that of her father’s... At that time, I had thought that this was only a ‘rumor’, but who would have thought that it was actually true!?” Yun Che said as he stared fixedly at the curtain of light, his entire body tensed up like a coiled spring.

“Then who is that person in the gray?”

“I don’t know! But if he’s following behind Qianye Ying’er, then he’s definitely someone from the Brahma Monarch God Realm!”

As the head of the four king realms within the Eastern Divine Region, the Brahma Monarch God Realm was truly an extremely terrifying existence.

Time flowed as the distance rapidly fell away. Under the maximum speed of the Vanishing Moon Celestial God Palace, the internal space was still extremely quiet and stable, but the heartstrings of Yun Che and Xia Qingyue were still pulled taut, they were unable to relax for even a single instant.

The two figures behind them were still there and they were following them like their shadow.

“Is there truly no way to move just a little bit faster?” Yun Che asked yet again. If they could only go faster by just the slightest degree, they would be able to gradually leave Qianye Ying’er in the dust...

“We’re already at the limit,” Xia Qingyue replied.

Two hours passed... Then four... They did not know how many star regions they passed by under this kind of speed and they were also completely unaware of where they were at the moment.

“Oh no...” Xia Qingyue suddenly let out a soft cry.

“What’s happening?” Yun Che’s eyes glanced sharply to the side.

“At its maximum speed, the Vanishing Moon Celestial Palace’s fuel consumption is simply too high,” Xia Qingyue gave a gloomy sigh, “it won’t be able to last for much longer.”

“...” Yun Che’s scalp immediately went numb. He had long thought of this point, but in the end, he had never dared to ask.

“Right now, we can only hope that they run out of endurance first and give up their pursuit,” Xia Qingyue softly said, yet she sighed powerlessly in her heart. Once they had reached that realm of power, their profound strength would be far more robust and solid than a normal person would be able to imagine, so this possibility was extremely low.

It was at this time that the curtain of light suddenly flashed with an abnormal gold light.

Yun Che involuntarily turned his head. In a glance, he could see that a golden star composed of light was gathering at the tip of Qianye Ying’er’s finger... This star of light was extremely tiny, and at first, it seemed as though it was just a weak little dot of light, but within the next instant, it felt like his eyes, heart, and soul had been completely pierced through...

And this was just a mere projection of its power!

Yun Che’s pupils shrank as he roared with all his strength, “Dodge that attack!!”

This loud roar clearly startled Xia Qingyue, but it also caused her hand to twitch involuntarily, causing the Vanishing Moon Celestial Palace to abruptly roll up and over.

SSSST————

This was definitely the most dreadful ripping sound Yun Che had heard in his entire life.

It was exactly when the Vanishing Moon Celestial Palace was making its roll, that an extremely small golden light skimmed the underside of the warship... After that, it cut across a small star that was an unknown distance in front of them.

A long golden glow immediately carved itself into that star. Then, the entire star was engulfed in that golden light and slowly tore itself apart and ruptured... following that, a cosmic storm that could devour the heavens and earth filled the void where the star had been.

A star had been annihilated!

Yun Che’s jaw dropped open and it was several breaths before he regained his senses.

He had never once imagined that he would actually see such a terrifying scene in his life.

Was this the pinnacle of the profound way? Was this power that a mortal could obtain?

Just what kind of monsters were these people!?

At this moment, a rather preposterous idea popped into Yun Che’s head... What kind of qualifications and capability do I possess to actually have two such monsters chasing after me!?

“To think that the power of mortal man could truly annihilate stars.” Xia Qingyue’s dispirited and empathic sigh rang in Yun Che’s ears. It was not that she had never heard of this, but hearing about something and witnessing it yourself were naturally two completely different notions.

If they had been hit by that attack, even if it was the Vanishing Moon Celestial Palace, it would also have been split in two.

“How much longer can we continue at this speed?” Yun Che finally asked that faithful question.

“At most... fifteen more minutes,” Xia Qingyue replied.

“Wh.... What?” This answer shocked Yun Che so greatly that he leapt to his feet.

Qianye Ying’er was simply far too terrifying. If they fell into her hands, even ten thousand of him and Xia Qingyue would not be able to put up the least bit of resistance.

And this was without even considering the gray-robed old monster that was by her side!

The Vanishing Moon Celestial Palace could only maintain its maximum speed for about fifteen more minutes. This also meant that right now, they could no longer depend on the Vanishing Moon Celestial Palace.

Now that he had considered all of these things, Yun Che swiftly regained his composure. He stared at the curtain of light as his eyes began to narrow bit by bit...

Even though he did not know what Qianye Ying’er’s goal was... for she who rarely even made an appearance to not only chase them personally, but to even chase them beyond the Eastern Divine Region, it was definitely no ordinary scheme that she had in mind.

We definitely cannot fall into her hands.

It looks like the only choice that he had now was to use the Void Illusion Stone to escape together with Xia Qingyue... As to where it would send them, that would all depend on fate at that point.

In any case, it was far better than landing in the hands of these monsters whose motives were unclear!

He looked over towards Xia Qingyue, only to discover that her crescent brows had tightly knit together and her gaze had grown cold and focused. It was as if she was pondering something and she did not seem the least bit panicked.

“Qingyue, could it be that you’ve thought of something?” Yun Che inquired.

“We need to quickly head to that place,” Xia Qingyue suddenly said.

“That place?” Yun Che was briefly puzzled by those words. But at this time, he suddenly noticed that a white blur had appeared in the curtain of light in front of them.

As the Vanishing Moon Celestial Palace came closer, Yun Che could gradually see that it was a white vortex... a spatial vortex.

There were no stars in sight within this vast region of space, and they could not see anything else either. The only thing they could see was the solitary and quiet presence of that white spatial vortex hanging in the middle of nowhere. Upon looking at it, Yun Che was suddenly struck by a strange feeling that came out of nowhere... It was the true center of this entire universe, the core of everything in existence.

“What is that?” Yun Che asked.

“The God... Realm... of Absolute... Beginning!” Xia Qingyue slowly said.

Yun Che’s brows twitched violently upon hearing that, “That’s the... fabled God Realm of Absolute Beginning!?”

The words God Realm of Absolute Beginning were words that Yun Che had already heard far too many times.

It was at the center of the four divine regions and it was also the core of the Primal Chaos Dimension. It was the most ancient and most gigantic ancient secret realm in this world. It was also rumored that it was the secret realm in which the Ancestral God herself had resided during the beginning of the Primal Chaos Dimension.

Stored within the God Realm of Absolute Beginning were countless primordial treasures. The drop of Divine Water of Absolute Beginning that was used on Yun Che had also come from this place, but there were also the many legacies left behind by the True Gods that had yet to be discovered. However, at the same time, these opportunities were accompanied by extreme danger.

The God Realm of Absolute Beginning was swimming with strange and fierce primordial beasts that did not exist in the world outside it. The more formidable a treasure, the more likely it was to radiate a spiritual aura that would attract powerful wild beasts which would try to possess it. Thus, if one wanted to take the treasures discovered within the God Realm of Absolute Beginning, even if they were as strong as a Divine Sovereign or a Divine Master, one needed to steel themselves for the likelihood of death.

The God Realm of Absolute Beginning did not belong to any divine region, much less any star realm. Anyone could enter it and there were no laws of restriction. Although this place had caused countless powerhouses to drool as they stared in its direction, at the same time it also caused them to flinch back the very next instant.

As for the younger generation of profound practitioners, the God Realm of Absolute Beginning was a forbidden ground they were absolutely not supposed to approach. Otherwise, it was no different from committing suicide.

But right now, it was the only option they had.

“We’re going in!”

Xia Qingyue’s gaze was cold and resolute. The trajectory of the Vanishing Moon Celestial Palace changed slightly as it flew directly toward the white vortex which whirled in the center of the universe.Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates
