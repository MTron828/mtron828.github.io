Chapter 1283 - Vanishing Moon

BUZZ————

Yun Che’s tone had not been too serious, but it had exploded in the brains of everyone present like a huge lightning bolt that came out of the blue... They had come today to attend the Moon God Emperor’s earth-shaking wedding celebration, so they had definitely never thought that they would be shaken by so many shocking events, one after the other, that it left their very souls trembling.

The god empress that was due to be wed to the Moon God Emperor was actually Yun Che’s lawfully wedded wife!?

Holy shit...

Even if all of the otherworldly talents in the universe gathered together and brainstormed until their heads cracked open, they would definitely not be able to write such a script.

Everyone’s mouths had gaped open. The Snow Song and Flame God Realms were so shocked that their eyes were practically bulging out of their sockets, and their very souls were thrown into confusion. This was especially so for Huo Rulie, his mouth was gaping open so widely that one could just about stuff one Huo Poyun inside.

The Moon God Emperor’s eyes were shaking wildly. He looked at Yun Che for a long time before slowly saying, “You... are truly her...”

“Yes, I am,” Yun Che said in a cold and hard voice before he turned and looked towards the Star God Emperor. “However, there is one thing I must make clear. The words that the Moon God Emperor just said did indeed not contain any falsity or excuses. Eight years ago, I was most certainly ‘dead’.”

The Moon God Emperor, “...”

The Star God Emperor’s brow furrowed greatly upon hearing those words.

“At that time, everyone thought that I was dead, including Xia Qingyue. Furthermore, after that she arrived in the God Realm and has not seen me again, so naturally she was not aware that I still lived,” Yun Che said impassively. “That is also to say that before today, Xia Qingyue was indeed not aware that I was still alive.”

He had definitely not said the words he had just spoken because he wanted to help the Moon God Emperor. Because of Jasmine, he definitely did not have any good feelings towards the Star God Emperor. Furthermore, the Star God Emperor had gotten ahold of his marriage contract and was clearly trying to use him. How could he be willing to be freely manipulated as the Star God Emperor’s tool?

“So to her, the fact that I am still alive is merely an accident that ‘should not exist’.”

“This marriage contract was something I had given to Xia Qingyue’s maid ‘Jin Yue’ so that she could hand it over to Xia Qingyue. The purpose of doing all of this was so that she could erase this ‘accident’ with her own two hands. After all, even though she and I were once husband and wife, our feelings have always been thin and weak. Furthermore, we were separated by ‘death’ for eight years, heh... I’m afraid that there probably isn’t much left of what was an originally weak and thin relationship in the first place. So this marriage contract, that should have long ago been consigned to dust, could perhaps barely be considered to be the last remaining bit.”

Yun Che’s voice was very cold and it held nearly no emotion. He looked at the Star God Emperor and even though he was staring directly at a god emperor, his gaze still remained cold and cutting, “Everything I should have said has been said. Right now, I have a question that I wish to pose to the Star God Emperor... Why did this marriage contract end up in your possession!? And how and why did you come to the conclusion that the ‘Xiao Che’ written on this marriage contract was me?”

The Moon God Emperor stared at Yun Che, a complex look in his eyes that no one else would be able to understand.

Yun Che’s explanation was beyond the Star God Emperor’s calculations and it had clearly messed up his own schemes. His expression grew faintly rigid as he gave a bland chuckle, “If this king told you that he had just picked it up, would you believe me?”

“I believe you. Of course I believe you.” Yun Che nodded his head, “A distinguished god emperor of a king realm. It is definitely not possible for such a personage to stoop so low as to steal something secretly from another person.”

Everyone present was so shaken up that they felt their brains had been rattled. At this moment, Yun Che was interrogating the Star God Emperor and making certain insinuations about him, and they could not even react in time to feel shock.

“Ah, so it turns out that he is her first husband who ‘has come back from the dead’, so it looks like the ‘taking by force’ hat doesn’t fit anymore,” Qianye Ying’er said with some disappointment. “This in addition to the fact Xia Qingyue’s vital yin aura still remains means that Xing Juekong will not be able to throw him for a loop this time.”

When she heard these words, it sounded like this matter had nothing to do with her, “However, being able to irritate Yue Wuya for a moment isn’t a bad idea either. But Yun Che on the other hand... Now things are about to get ugly.”

“But that makes it all the more interesting, yes?” Qingye Ying’er said with a faint smile.

At this moment, a stream of air flowed across the area. The Vanishing Moon Celestial Palace, that had always been quietly floating in the light of the divine moon, suddenly flashed with profound light before it started to slowly move. It continued flying before finally coming to rest in the space above Yun Che and the rest of them.

The curtain of light opened and Xia Qingyue stepped out from behind it. She slowly floated to the ground, and it was as if a celestial fairy from the Moon Palace was descending to the earth.

A mere glimpse of her from afar had already painted an inestimable portrait of beauty. But now that she had come forward and graced all of them with her presence, it caused a stifling sensation, that was hard to put into words, to assault everyone who saw her.

Today was the day of her marriage, the day that she was supposed to become a god empress, yet her long moon-white robes were exceptionally spare and simple. It was not even equivalent to the Divine Moon Robes worn by the daughters of the Moon God Emperor. Yet even this startlingly simple attire was exuding an incomparably eye-catching brilliance and grace because of her.

Her eyes were extremely calm and tranquil, they resembled a secluded pool that would never be disturbed by anything. Yet they seemed to hold all the delicate beauty that this world had to offer.

She merely stood there quietly, neither laughing nor scowling, but all eyes were focused on her. Even the two great god emperors, the Star God Emperor and the Moon God Emperor, had become mere props in the background when standing next to her, their presence unconsciously forgotten at that moment.

Yun Che looked at her before slowly averting his gaze. She was still Xia Qingyue, but compared to the past, she had completely and utterly changed. She was clearly so close to him, yet she radiated a mysterious and strange illusory feeling, it was as if she was a goddess that had strolled out of an ancient painting... It felt as if she should not exist on this sinful earth.

This thought silently flashed in nearly everyone’s hearts: Perhaps, just based on her heavenly beauty alone, she was sufficiently qualified to become a god empress, even if she did not have a Heart of Glazed Glass. Being at the summit of this universe’s ideal of beauty and grace, was now something that not only belonged to the Dragon Queen and Goddess, but also something that belonged to her.

“Qingyue,“ the Moon God Emperor looked at her, a complex look in his eyes, “is Yun Che truly the ‘previous husband’ that you told me about before?”

“...Yes.” Xia Qingyue gave a light nod of her head.

Yun Che, “...”

The sound of saliva being swallowed spread across the crowd like a wave. It was fine to treat the words of everyone else who had spoken so far as assumptions, but with a single word from Xia Qingyue, this had become an absolutely irrefutable truth.

Everything that they had heard so far was actually true.

“...” The Moon God Emperor was rendered speechless for a moment before he gave Yun Che a deep look.

Xia Qingyue lightly turned her gaze to someone else, “Star God Emperor, would it be fine to return that marriage contract to me?”

“Heh heh, this was something that was originally the both of yours in the first place, so it’s natural that it should return to its original owner.” The Star God Emperor gave a bland chuckle before pushing out his finger.

The marriage contract lightly floated over and Xia Qingyue grasped it in her hand.

“This is something concerning me, so let me be the one to resolve it,” Xia Qingyue said in a soft voice.

The Moon God Emperor inclined his head as his gaze swept over Xia Qingyue and Yun Che separately. After that, he said something that was extremely strange, “If it is him, then he is worthy of you after all.”

With those words, he withdrew.

Following a gesture of his hand, the rest of them hurriedly withdrew as well. Very quickly, a huge empty space was formed and only Yun Che and Xia Qingyue stood there, in silence in the middle of this empty world... as well as the Vanishing Moon Celestial Palace that was floating quietly in the air above them.

“To think that such a thing would actually happen.” The Eternal Heaven God Emperor gave a deep sigh of lament, “Yun Che is the ‘child of the heavens’ while Xia Qingyue possesses the Heart of Glazed Glass and so she is the ‘daughter of the heavens’. Furthermore, the two of them have been husband and wife and had even come from the same place.”

Blue Wind Floating Cloud...

“Yet neither of these people were born in the God Realm. So just what kind of existence is that planet in the lower realms known as ‘Neptune’.”

“Heh heh,” the Brahma Heaven God Emperor gave a dry chuckle upon hearing those words. “During this period of time, the Brahma Monarch God Realm has sent people to scour the lower realms in hopes of finding that planet known as ‘Neptune’. I had believed that the stars of this myriad universe were boundless and that this search would be akin to searching for a needle in a great ocean, a most arduous and difficult task. Yet who would have thought that the fortune of my Brahma Monarch God Realm was good and we would indeed find that very planet.”

“Oh?” The Eternal Heaven God Emperor’s gaze swivelled towards him, but his eyes did not hold much expectation.

“It was exactly as the Eternal Heaven God Emperor thought. That planet ‘Neptune’ was a dead planet and there were no living creatures in it.”

“Hahahaha.” The Eternal Heaven God Emperor was not the least bit surprised, instead he laughed in a very composed manner. “Yun Che is an extremely clever person, so how could it be possible that he would reveal his true origins. Him using ‘Neptune’ as a shield was something completely logical and natural. But as for you, Brahma Heaven God Emperor. You clearly knew that this information was false yet you spared no effort to search for this planet anyways. It looks like Yun Che has truly ‘caught your eye’.”

“Hahahaha,” the Brahma Heaven God Emperor gave a hearty laugh at that. “It’s not merely enough to call it ‘catching my eye’. If not, how would I be willing to betroth Ying’er to him?”

“The will of the Goddess is something I am afraid that even you, the Brahma Heaven God Emperor, cannot interfere with. So this so-called ‘betrothal’ is no more or less the will of the Goddess herself.” The Eternal Heaven God Emperor’s eyes were profound and deep beyond measure. On the final day of the Conferred God Battle, the actions of the Brahma Monarch God Realm may have tricked everyone else, but it could not possibly have tricked him as well, “But given this old one’s minimal understanding of the Goddess, it is not possible for her ‘betrothal’ to be a genuine one. On the contrary, just this one word alone has caused Yun Che to be hated and envied by an innumerable amount of people. Moreover, this hatred and envy was spread across the entire God Realm.”

“Furthermore, the attention of any one of these people is something far beyond what Yun Che can endure.”

“The Eternal Heaven God Emperor has overthought things,” the Brahma Heaven God Emperor said with a faint smile.

“Yun Che may not be able to endure it, but this old one can most certainly endure it.” The Eternal Heaven God Emperor said slowly, his voice was composed but the implication behind his words were clear, “At least for the next three years, no one will be able to touch a hair on his head. As for what happens after the next three years, that is up to his own choices and destiny.”

The Eternal Heaven God Emperor greatly admired Yun Che. Even though Yun Che had rejected his offer to become his direct disciple, he was still willing to protect him with all of his strength. After all, he was the miracle of the Eastern Divine Region.

The Brahma Heaven God Emperor smiled but he did not reply.

As everyone looked at them with bated breath, Xia Qingyue walked towards Yun Che. When she finally came to a stop, the distance between the two of them was very small, she was merely a single step away from him.

The two people finally met each other eyes. Their gazes were composed and not a ripple appeared on their faces... But the ripples of their hearts and souls were known only to themselves.

“It’s been a long time,” Xia Qingyue said, her voice as light as a dream.

“Yes, it has been a long time.” Yun Che nodded in response.

“You practically haven’t changed at all.”

“Yet you have changed so much.”

“Is the sect still well?” she asked.

“Very much so.”

“Then that’s good.”

Every word, every action, every expression, and every look was something everyone present could see clearly. They were once husband and wife, yet their words and emotions were as bland and indifferent as two strangers who had met on the road.

What Xia Qingyue was about to do and what was about to happen next was something everyone very clearly understood.

On one hand was her previous husband whom she had an extremely indifferent relationship with, someone who had burst onto the scene with much fanfare in the Eastern Divine Region.

On the other hand was the realm king of the Moon God Realm, one of the four god emperors of the Eastern Divine Region, an existence that stood at the pinnacle of the entire God Realm, the entire universe even.

There was no simpler choice in the world to make than her choice today.

Even if one were to make all the concessions in the world, even if Xia Qingyue truly still had feelings for Yun Che, and even if those feelings were of the kind that would not fade even until her death. Given this current scenario and setting, the wedding celebration of a god emperor, she could not make any other choice. Because if she chose to abandon this wedding in the end, it would undoubtedly cause all the dignity and face that the Moon God Emperor had left to go down the drain. It would cause the Moon God Emperor, who was originally about to wash away the shame and humiliation he had suffered because of what had happened to Yue Wugou all those years ago, to truly become the greatest laughingstock under heaven.

The result would be that both she and Yun Che would die under the Moon God Emperor’s thunderous fury. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

She would not, would not dare to, and even more so, it would not be possible for her to.

As such, Xia Qingyue and Yun Che would sever the final remnants of their bonds, destroy the marriage contract, and go their own ways.

There was no other possibility.

“This pair is actually what could be called a golden couple. Ah, how pitiable,” Gu Zhu gave a rare sigh of lament.

“Uncle Gu,” Everyone’s attention was fixed on Yun Che and Xia Qingyue but Qianye Ying’er’s gaze was focused on the Moon God Emperor, “don’t you think that Yue Wuya’s reaction is rather strange? When faced with such a situation, just which man can be magnanimous to this extent? What’s more, this is Yue Wuya we are talking about, someone who had suffered such humiliation because of the matter with Yue Wugou.”

Gu Zhu, “...”

“It’s been more than eight years. I had never thought that the next time we would meet, it would be in this place.”

“I had never imagined it either.”

The words exchanged by the two people remained calm and composed, there was no joy or sadness there.

“Have you always been in the Moon God Realm?”

“Mn, I’ve never left it before. How about you? When did you come here?”

“Three years ago, but I’ve basically been in the Snow Song Realm all this while.”

“The God Realm is vast, and the Eastern Divine Regions is just one of the divine regions within it. Have you ever paid a visit to the other divine regions?”

“No, not at all,” Yun Che replied.

“I haven’t either. Since that’s the case...” Xia Qingyue suddenly extended her arm and grabbed Yun Che’s hand.

“...” Yun Che was instantly stunned by her actions. After that, Xia Qingyue’s voice, that sounded like an illusion or dream, rang in his ears, “Then why don’t we go and have a look?”

Her celestial voice lingered in his ears as Yun Che was suddenly carried up by Xia Qingyue, before transforming into a flashing comet which disappeared into the Vanishing Moon Celestial Palace’s curtain of light.

The Vanishing Moon Celestial Palace radiated profound light before it gathered up a vast amount of air and shot into the distance. In just a single instant, it had vanished from the sight of all who had gathered here.
