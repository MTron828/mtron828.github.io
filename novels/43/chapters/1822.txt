Chapter - 1820 - The Final Fragment of the World-Defying Heaven Manual

Yun Che agreed to all three things.

After that, Shui Meiyin closed her eyes and her tear-stained face seemed to be a lot more at ease.

“I’ll fulfill them, each and every one of them,” Yun Che vowed solemnly.

Shui Meiyin managed to make a cute little pout before she finally laughed in a voice that was still a little stuffy from crying. “Mmm! Thanks Big Brother Yun Che!”

“There’s no need to thank me.” Yun Che grinned as he pinched the tip of her pretty white nose. “If we’re really going to be thanking each other, even a million years wouldn’t be enough for me to say all of those ‘thank yous’.”

Shui Meiyin, “...”

Today was undoubtedly yet another rebirth for Yun Che.

A long period of time passed before the two of them finally managed to compose themselves. They didn’t linger in the Seven Star Realm any longer. Instead, they immediately shot into the air and returned the way they came, back to the Ten Directions Deep Sea Realm.

Even though they could have used the World Piercer to arrive there in the very next instant, it was a waste of its remaining power, a power that might very well prove invaluable in the near future. They also didn’t want to leave any traces of teleportation near the Seven Star Realm.

“Now that I think about it, the timing with which you produced your Illusory Glazed Imagery Jade was simply sublime. It caused the battle lines that the Eastern Divine Region had just begun to form to completely collapse. Everything fell into place like a pile of dominoes after that. Also, even though you were struggling with this decision all this while, the timing with which you chose to tell me everything couldn’t have been more perfect. At least that’s the way that I see it.”

Yun Che grasped Shui Meiyin’s hand gently as a faint smile appeared on his face. However, the meaning behind this smile was completely different from what it had been for the last few years.

“I was actually really worried just now, but now that I see the look on Big Brother Yun Che’s face, I believe that we will definitely attain the best possible ending in the future,” Shui Meiyin said with a happy smile.

“That’s right! Let me make a guess right now,” Yun Che suddenly said. “Did you borrow the spatial divine power of the World Piercer to secretly scout out the Northern Divine Region from the very beginning?”

A surprised look appeared on Shui Meiyin’s face, but she didn’t deny his words immediately. She grinned at him and replied, “Why do you ask?”

“About one and a half years ago, we were laying the groundwork to create the excuse we needed to attack the Eastern Divine Region. At that time, Chi Wuyao lured Zhou Xuzi to the border of the Northern Divine Region and I killed Zhou Qingchen in front of him.”

“After that, the Devil Queen told me a very strange thing. She said she sensed an aura flash past us during that confrontation and she was utterly convinced that she wasn’t mistaken.”

“However, she couldn’t find that aura again, no matter how much she swept the area with her spiritual senses.” Yun Che glanced at Shui Meiyin. “The Devil Queen possesses a very unique devil soul, a soul strong enough to cause the dragon soul of the strongest Dragon God to collapse, but she wasn’t able to find the aura that she had already sensed again. This was something she simply couldn’t accept for a very long period of time... In fact, I don’t think she’s quite accepted it even now.”

“Now that I think about it, that aura most likely came from you. After you discovered that she had sensed you, you instantly used the power of the World Piercer to teleport away. If that’s the case, even the Devil Queen wouldn’t be able to find you.”

“Am I right?”

Even though he was posing it as a question, Yun Che was absolutely convinced that he was right. Because this was the only way that aura could have suddenly vanished from Chi Wuyao’s spiritual senses without a single trace. There was no other possibility he could think of.

“...Heehee.” Shui Meiyin suddenly giggled. She shifted her eyes away and looked to the front, “I got caught by Big Brother Yun Che. Yup, that was me! It’s just that I couldn’t reveal myself at that time, so I immediately fled the moment I was discovered.”

“Just as I had thought,” Yun Che said with a smile on his face. “Let me make another guess. Long Bai... You were the one who lured him away, right?”

Long Bai just so happened to leave the Dragon God Realm a few days before the Northern Divine Region launched their invasion of the Eastern Divine Region, and he still hadn’t returned yet.

He had already confirmed that this had nothing to do with Chi Wuyao or Qianye Ying’er... They definitely wanted to do it, but they simply didn’t have the means.

As a result, the only person who would be cognizant of the timing of the Northern Divine Region’s invasion and be able to use a special method to lure Long Bai to the God Realm of Absolute Beginning right before then was Shui Meiyin. After all, she had just confessed that she would occasionally use the World Piercer to spy on the situation developing inside the Northern Divine Region.

She had even been able to do it without being caught.

“Mmmm, Big Brother Yun Che is right again,” Shui Meiyin simply confessed. “At that time, I thought that the Dragon God Realm would pose the greatest threat to your plans. It was the greatest unknown variable that could easily have turned things around for the Eastern Divine Region. Furthermore, since Long Bai has absolute and unquestioned authority in the Dragon God Realm, his disappearance would mean that the Dragon God Realm would most likely stay put unless you directly invaded the Western Divine Region.”

“However, it seems like Big Brother Yun Che isn’t the least bit afraid of the Dragon God Realm. Did I... do something unnecessary?”

Yun Che smiled and shook his head. “Before the events of today, I was eagerly awaiting my meeting with Long Bai. But now... I realize that you luring him away was for the best. If not, we’d be facing an utterly different situation right now. Just thinking about it sends a shudder down my spine.”

As he looked at Shui Meiyin’s profile, his heart throbbed with emotion and he said, “Meiyin, I’m really lucky... to have you in my life.”

They had first met when she was only fifteen. It had been during one of the rounds of the Profound God Convention’s Conferred God Battle. When faced off against her terrifyingly strong Stainless Divine Soul, he had no choice but to use a despicable method to attain victory. He thought that she would fiercely hate and despise him because of that, but she had instead become infatuated with him! To the point where she would simply ignore her elder sister’s advice and her father’s wrath.

This infatuation of hers had also been a huge headache for him back in the day.

Amazingly enough, this love hadn’t dimmed one bit during the three thousand years she had spent in the Eternal Heaven Divine Realm.

And now, it had turned his destiny around and saved his heart, soul... and everything dear to him.

He did not dare to imagine what the situation would be like... if he had never met her, if he hadn’t been fortunate enough to gain this wholehearted love of hers.

“Then, what method did you use to lure Long Bai into the God Realm of Absolute Beginning for so long? To the point where he still isn’t willing to come out to this day?” Yun Che asked. He was extremely curious as to how Shui Meiyin had accomplished this feat.

“That...” Hesitance appeared in Shui Meiyin’s eyes before she said, “I used a very special method that’s a bit hard to explain. If Big Brother Yun Che really wants to know, you can personally ask Long Bai after you’ve gallantly beaten him.”

“Oh right, there’s something that I have to give to Big Brother Yun Che.”

Perhaps Shui Meiyin was trying to avoid this question she wasn’t willing to answer, but she looked as if she had suddenly recalled something as she stopped and held her hands up toward Yun Che. A weak light faintly flashed from them before a floating black stone tablet appeared in front of her.

It was a square-shaped stone tablet that was three feet wide and as black as night. A row of strange and profound-looking runes were inscribed on this tablet.

An indescribably mysterious aura that barely seemed to exist radiated from the tablet, and it caused Yun Che’s soul to violently shudder.

This feeling...

He reached out to touch the stone tablet, his fingers tracing the lines of those strange and bizarre runes.

The Divine Text of Absolute Beginning!?

Could this be...

Yun Che’s head whipped up violently to look at Shui Meiyin. His eyes were filled with shock as he asked, “Was this something that the Heaven Smiting Devil Emperor passed to you as well?”

“Yes, Senior Devil Emperor told me to pass it to you at the appropriate time,” Shui Meiyin replied.

Yun Che’s heart started to ripple agitatedly.

The Divine Text of Absolute Beginning. The thing that the Heaven Smiting Devil Emperor had passed to Shui Meiyin... was the fragment of the Ancestral Divine Art that she had owned!

The profound art that was also known as the World-Defying Heaven Manual in this current era!

In the Ancient Era, Heaven Punishing Divine Emperor Mo E set a trap for the Heaven Smiting Devil Emperor because of this fragment of the World-Defying Heaven Manual. That was the event that caused Jie Yuan to be banished from the Primal Chaos Dimension in the first place.

He had always assumed that this fragment had followed the Heaven Smiting Devil Emperor back to the void beyond the Wall of Primal Chaos, but it turned out that she had passed this to Shui Meiyin as well.

Strange... Why didn’t she just hand it over to me? Why did she have to pass it to me through Shui Meiyin?

A suspicion flashed through his mind.

He stretched out a hand and grabbed hold of the stone tablet that was floating in the air... Once he combined this with the other two fragments he was holding, he would possess the unified World-Defying Heaven Manual, the whole Ancestral Divine Art.

No one had ever managed to complete it before! This was true even in the Era of Gods!

This was truly a historic moment! Something that had never happened in the entire history of the Primal Chaos!

As he suppressed the wildly-surging emotions in his heart, he voiced his suspicions to Shui Meiyin. “When the Heaven Smiting Devil Emperor handed it over to you, did she leave you any special instructions?”

Shui Meiyin paused for a moment before replying, “She said that she would rather that this thing had never come into her possession in the first place.”

Yun Che, “...”

He had not obtained the answer he desired, but the Heaven Smiting Devil Emperor’s words contained a boundless sorrow and regret that no outsider could ever understand.

The law of nothingness that Yun Che had grasped had come from the two fragments of the World-Defying Heaven Manual he already possessed.

It was an extremely unique and vague enlightenment, because Yun Che didn’t even understand how he attained this enlightenment in the first place, nor did he know just how much of this law he truly understood.

Now that he had unified the World-Defying Heaven Manual, the completed Ancestral Divine Art might be able to help him delve into the deeper mysteries of the law of nothingness.

However, he could not read the Divine Text of Absolute Beginning. The only person in the universe who could do so was Xiao Lingxi.

Unfortunately for him, he wasn’t able to reveal himself to her at this time.

Yun Che put away the black stone tablet, and put all thoughts of the World-Defying Heaven Manual and the Ancestral Divine Art out of his mind. After that, he turned to Shui Meiyin and said, “Meiyin, after we return to the Deep Sea Realm, can you promise me one thing...”

...................

When they returned to the Ten Directions Deep Sea Realm, Yun Che thought that the ocean-blue sky was as pretty as a picture as his eyes and soul drank in its splendor.

The world seemed so much more colorful and vibrant to him now.

The Three Yama Ancestors rushed toward Yun Che at the highest speed the moment they sniffed out his aura. They reverentially stopped in front of him and greeted him. “We welcome Master back to the realm.”

Yun Che was softly caressing the tri-colored Glazed Sound Stone around his neck, a warm and gentle smile on his face. The Three Yama Ancestors’ voices caused him to look up at them reflexively, but the smile on his face was still there when he looked at them.

The moment they saw that smile, the Three Yama Ancestors felt a violent shudder run down their spines. After that, they practically pissed themselves as they frantically prostrated themselves before Yun Che.

“Maaaaaassssster! Please do not be angry! This old slave deserves... deserves to die a thousand deaths!” Yan One howled as he smashed his head against the ground. His crooked body was practically glued to the ground as he shook in terror.

“This old slave repents! I beg for Master’s forgiveness.” Yan Two was shaking even harder than Yan One.

“This old slave is incompetent and dull-witted. Since I have incurred Master’s wrath, I fully deserve to die a thousand times over. I beg Master to bestow his punishment upon this old slave. You mustn’t become so angry that you hurt yourself,” Yan Three howled as his head banged off against the ground with the steady rhythm of a pounding hammer.

“...” Yun Che’s lips twitched... He immediately realized that his faint smile had scared the three old men witless.

“Rise.”

After he let go of the Glazed Sound Stone in an incredibly gentle manner, he flung a hand out and said, “Stop being eyesores and disturbing the peace! Go take a break somewhere!”

Yun Che immediately walked off after he said that. The Three Yama Ancestors scrambled to their feet as they stared at his shrinking figure with eyes that were as wide as saucers. Their brains simply couldn’t process what had just happened.

After he sent sound transmissions to Chi Wuyao, Qianye Ying’er, Caizhi, and Yan Tianxiao, Yun Che stood in the center of the Deep Sea Royal Hall, closed his eyes, and whispered, “He Ling, prepare to open the Eternal Heaven Divine Realm.”

He Ling’s excited voice very quickly rang out in his mind. “Master, you’ve finally... thought things through!”

“Yes,” Yun Che said as he smiled and nodded his head.

“Before today, I was only thinking of using the most violent and cruel method to rip Long Bai apart. Every day I had to wait was a torture because of my violent desire, and I wouldn’t hesitate to pay any price to make that desire into a reality.”

“But now, things have completely changed.”

As he spoke, a faint smile remained on his face, even when he mentioned the name “Long Bai”.

The figures of all the people who had reappeared in his life once more floated up in his mind as he closed his eyes and said, “Now, I wouldn’t mind if I had to wait three hundred years, or even three thousand years in the Eternal Heaven Divine Realm, much less a measly three years.”

“Because Long Bai and the Dragon God Realm... are no longer opponents that I will risk my life to defeat!”

Crack!

The joints in his hands cracked as he clenched his fists. His voice was rich with malice and the promise of violence as he continued, “I am going to use the safest possible method to smash... him... to death!”
