Chapter 1344 – The Evil Infant Awakens

Outside of the Star God Realm, Qianye Fantian, Zhou Xuzi, and Yue Wuya, the three great god emperors of the Eastern Divine Region, still had not left.

Due to the isolating effect of the Absolute Star Soul Barrier, however, they were completely unaware of what was happening in Star God City.

“The Absolute Star Soul Barrier can’t be maintained for too long, seven more days would be the absolute limit. Are the two of you going to continue waiting?” The Eternal Heaven God Emperor asked.

“Since I’ve come all the way here, then I’m naturally going to wait,” The Brahma Heaven God Emperor said with a laugh.

“A momentous event that would cause the Star God Realm to open the Absolute Star Soul Barrier is very likely to affect our entire Eastern Divine Region. If we aren’t able to get to the bottom of the this matter at the earliest opportunity we have, how can we feel at ease?” Compared to the Brahma Heaven God Emperor, the Moon God Emperor’s expression was a bit more solemn and serious.

The Eternal Heaven God Emperor gave a small nod and as he thought of the Yun Che who had slipped through the Absolute Star Soul Barrier, a look of worry once again emerged on his face. “For the time being, let’s not discuss why Yun Che would suddenly rush over here from the Dragon God Realm. Now that he’s entered the Star God Realm, it will definitely be considered an unexpected incident by the Star God Realm who has currently sealed themselves off from the world to undertake a huge task. I’m afraid that...”

“Heh heh, the Eternal Heaven God Emperor need not fret,” the Brahma Heaven God Emperor said. “Yun Che isn’t any ordinary junior, his innate talent is unmatched and he is also the ‘child of the heavens’ that the Heavenly Mystery Three Elders have personally prophesied about. Even more than that, he has the Dragon Monarch’s protection, so no one would be willing to take action against him. What’s more, in the end, his power is still very weak, so even if it is an unexpected incident, it isn’t a critical one.”

“...” The Eternal Heaven God Emperor nodded and said, “I hope that’s the case.”

The Brahma Heaven God Emperor’s gaze swept across the Eternal Heaven God Emperor’s face as his laughter grew even richer, “It looks like even though Yun Che chose to stay in the Western Divine Region’s Dragon God Realm, the Eternal Heaven God Emperor is still deeply concerned about him. This child truly has great fortune. Speaking of which, the Eternal Heaven God Emperor must definitely be feeling extremely regretful over the fact that he did not enter the Eternal Heaven Pearl and chose to stay in the Dragon God Realm instead. But if you want him to return to the Eastern Divine Region, it actually wouldn’t be too hard of a task.”

“Oh?” the Eternal Heaven God Emperor said as his eyes slanted to the side.

“Everyone under heaven knows that the reason Yun Che went to the Dragon God Realm and has not returned is because he is afraid of the Moon God Emperor,” the Brahma Heaven God Emperor said cheerily as he looked at the Moon God Emperor. “As long as the Moon God Emperor is willing to say something and make it known that he will not make things difficult for Yun Che over the matter of the ‘God Empress’, then he will naturally return. Wouldn’t you agree, Moon God Emperor?”

The Moon God Emperor declined to comment. He looked to the side as he coldly narrowed his eyes.

The Brahma Heaven God Emperor continued, “As such, it will clearly show that the Moon God Emperor has a broad and magnanimous heart and it will also fulfill the wishes of the Eternal Heaven God Emperor. Yun Che’s growth in the future will be a positive for the Eastern Divine Region, it will kill three birds with one stone. Wouldn’t that be simply beautiful?”

“Heh heh, the Brahma Heaven God Emperor is absolutely right,” the Moon God Emperor said with a smile that was not a smile. “Since this king has already taken Qingyue as my foster daughter, then I naturally won’t be bothered with trying to pursue the matter with that kid Yun Che. But as for why that kid chose to stay in the Dragon God Realm... Brahma Heaven God Emperor, it can’t be that you truly...”

THUMP!!

Before the Moon God Emperor’s voice had finished falling, he felt his heart fiercely wrench... The complexions of the three great god emperors changed at the very same instant.

“What is going on!?” the Moon God Emperor said in a deep voice.

“...” The Eternal Heaven God Emperor’s brows knitted together, he instantly released his spiritual sense and swept it over the vast world surrounding them.

The Brahma Heaven God Emperor raised his head... At this time, the heavens themselves had suddenly gone dark, and dark clouds that came out of nowhere were swiftly gathering. They whirled and rolled around before finally pressing down layer by layer. Not long after, the blue skies that had been engulfed by those black clouds had been pressed down completely, and it was almost to the point where it was touchable.

“This... This is?”

The expressions of the three great god emperors abruptly grew extremely heavy and imposing. They had seen a similarly bizarre occurrence a little more than a year ago. At that time, the rolling black clouds had engulfed the entire Eastern Divine Region and what followed was a incomparably world-shocking nine stage lightning tribulation.

Moreover, this time was different from the last. Because the eerie gloominess and the oppressiveness that followed the sinking down of these black clouds, were more than a thousand times heavier and more terrifying than it had been the last time!!

It was so terrifying that all three great god emperors found it impossible to breathe. As their souls were being overwhelmed by shock, they began to spasm and convulse like never before.

..................

Within Star God City, black clouds had also covered the skies. An invisible oppression was fiercely pressing down on everyone’s chest. Between the heavens and the earth, the sound of that heart beating was getting louder and louder... It was as if a devil God of the Primal Chaos, which was even larger than their God Realm, a devil god that had been sleeping for untold aeons, had suddenly been roused and had started to point its sharp fangs and devilish claws towards this weak and frail world.

“What’s going on? What exactly is going on?” Under this oppression that was far too dreadful, even the Star Gods themselves felt a deep feeling of disquiet emerge in their hearts... Swiftly, this sense of unease quickly morphed into fear, a fear that was growing deeper and deeper, a fear that caused their souls, hearts, bodies and even hair to shake crazily.

Thump!

Thump!

Thump, thump, thump...

Thump, thump, thump, thump, thump, thump, thump, thump...

That heartbeat was growing heavier and heavier, more and more frenzied and that extremely dreadful aura had now filled every corner of this world. Only Jasmine remained completely motionless, she did not react in the slightest, it was only that the pupils of her eyes had become incomparably pitch-black and empty.

Yun Che...

Yun Che... Yun Che...

“Big Sister, you... what’s going on with you? Big Sister...” Caizhi’s complexion was a deathly white as she faced the person who was the closest to her in her very life. For some odd reason, her heart was pulsing with an extremely deep fear. She called her name time and again, but Jasmine had never given a single response. In the end, she desperately suppressed all of her dread as she moved forward to grasp her hand.

In an instant, her hand jerked back as if she had been electrocuted, her pale face going even whiter, “Big... Big Sister...”

Jasmine’s hand was incomparably icy and cold, it was even colder than the coldest regions of the extreme north... Furthermore, it was the kind of cold that directly pierced through one’s heart and soul.

At this moment, Jasmine suddenly moved.

She raised her left hand and pressed it against the barrier that had sealed her and Caizhi inside, the barrier that was also suppressing all of their power.

On the back of her hand, the mark of a pitch-black wheel flashed before abruptly releasing a cluster of incomparably dense black light.

The moment this cluster of black light appeared, it was as if a black hole, which possessed an infinitely strong ability to rend things apart, had manifested in their midst. Everyone’s spiritual senses and gazes were drawn towards it by an inexorable force and focused on it. As everyone dumbly stared at the black light flashing on Jasmine’s hands, their eyes began to unconsciously grow bigger bit by bit...

The color black was a color that could not be more common or familiar in the world.

But not a single one of them had known that the color black could actually be so dense and deep.

That cluster of black light was very tiny, but as they stared straight at it, for some odd reason, the same terrifying thought emerged in everyone’s mind:

That cluster of black light was enough to swallow any lifeform, it was enough to swallow this Star God Realm, it was enough to swallow everything in the entire universe...

“What... What is that?” The Heavenly Origin Star God was the first one to come to his senses and he said those words involuntarily as his hair stood on end.

Black light... there was no profound artifact in the Star God Realm that could release that kind of profound light and it was even more impossible for it to be the Heavenly Slaughter Star God’s own power!

This black profound light was clearly the profound light that would only be emitted by darkness profound energy! But all of the dark “devils” or creatures of darkness that he had met in his lifetime that had spanned tens of thousands of years, the dark profound light they released had never given him such a feeling of terror.

“...” The Star God Emperor was left speechless. He wanted to know what that cluster of black light was more than anybody else. Just what exactly had happened to Jasmine’s body? And what exactly was happening to the entire Star God Realm!?

As the black light brilliantly flashed, beams of black colored streaks of light were abruptly released from the left hand that was being covered by black light. It swiftly spread and radiated across every part of Jasmine’s body, and in a few short breaths, these fine black streaks of light had already covered her entire body.

At this moment, her hair started dancing in the air and within everyone’s extremely shocked eyes, her hair, the hair that had been dyed with the Heavenly Slaughter’s divine power, the blood-red hair which was a symbol of the Heavenly Slaughter Star God, was slowly becoming pitch-black as it danced in the air.

It was even darker than an abyss, even deeper than a dark night sky.

“Ah... Ah, ah... AH!? W-w-what... what exactly is going on here!?”

Inside the barrier, most of the Star God and elders had stood up. They had just somehow managed to regain their composure after the shock Yun Che had given them, but now, shock and fear bloomed in their hearts once more...

But it was only just the beginning of everything. In the next instant, it would feel as if all their souls had flown straight to heaven.

CRAAAACCCK!!!!

A tiny crack appeared beneath Jasmine’s palm, but it produced an explosive cracking sound that ripped through the heavens and the earth. Furthermore, the instant this crack appeared, the eyes of all the Star Gods, elders and Star Guards just about exploded in shock.

Because this crack had actually appeared on the barrier that had locked up Jasmine and Caizhi.

The ceremonial barrier that had connected the power of nine Star Gods and thirty-six elders along with countless amounts of profound stones and profound crystals! The ceremonial barrier, that according to their knowledge and experience, was completely impervious to any damage or impact!

“AHHHHHH!!??”

“No... It’s not possible!!” The Star God Emperor stood up as his body shook, his eyes became completely bloodshot and it was as if he had been plunged into a nightmare.

KA————

The black light flashed yet again and it instantly swelled up by several orders of magnitude as it engulfed Jasmine long and slender left arm. After that, yet another long crack exploded on the barrier. Following that, the new crack connected together with the first crack as the cracks began to swiftly spread out like spiderwebs. In the blink of an eye, it had directly spread throughout the entire barrier.

An isolation barrier that had focused the peak powers and auras of a king realm, an isolation barrier that could be called the strongest isolation barrier in the universe, under that bizarre light, it actually seemed like a layer of fragile and weak glass as it was easily cut in two by that crack.

After that... it shattered with an explosive bang.

CHA————

The sound of the strongest barrier in the universe shattering was so sharp and shrill that it sounded as if billions of awls had been stabbed into one’s ears and heart.

This barrier had not only linked together the power of nine Star Gods and thirty-six elders, it had also linked their auras, and now that it had shattered, one could well imagine how dreadful the backlash was. Amidst a shattering sound that was so sharp that it rent space, countless Star Guard’s eardrums were ruptured and blood streamed from all seven orifices. Furthermore, the nine Star Gods and the thirty-six elders, including the Star God Emperor himself, all seemed to have been smashed by some heavenly mallet. Fresh blood wildly spewed from their mouths as their meridians and veins were ruptured, and countless wounds had even been inflicted on their internal organs...

The ceremonial barrier that they were standing in, as well as the two layers of the Absolute Star Soul Barrier which sealed away Star God City and the Star God Realm respectively, had also completely collapsed in this instant. The sound of something being cracked open and rent apart filled the skies above the Star God Realm as the explosively dispersing energy caused thousands of calamitous storms to be stirred up in those very same skies. It seemed as if a calamitous disaster had suddenly descended on the entire Star God Realm as shocked roars and cries of misery filled the air.

The nine Star Gods and thirty-six elders... All of them lay flat on the ground, as they crazily vomited blood due to the far too dreadful backlash, as if they were going to vomit out all the blood in their bodies. They did not know exactly what kind of nightmare this was as a haze descended over their minds and their souls had been shaken so badly that they were about to fly apart...

“Heeheeheeheeheehee...”

“Uuuuuuuu... Uuuuuuuuuuuuuuu...”

“Hic, hic... Hic, hic, hic, hic... Huhuhu... Huhuhahahahahaha...”

Amidst this nightmarish world, a terrifying voice suddenly started ringing out in the air. This sound was very soft and very sharp; at times it was laughing and at times it was crying. This crying laughter, when one first listened to it, it sounded like the voice of an infant, yet it was also extremely eerie and terrifying, causing everyone’s bodies to go cold as if they had been plunged into an abyss of icy hell.

They involuntarily raised their heads... The black clouds above had blocked out the sun and they produced a scene that looked like the apocalypse was about to happen. But as those clouds tossed and turned, they actually started forming a dark and gloomy face... That was the face of an infant, yet those eyes were even more sinister than that of a devil as it let out laughs and cries that were even darker and more eerie than the cries of a malicious spirit...

“Hic, hic, hic...”

“Huhuhuhu... Uuuuuuu... Yehahahahaha....”

Jasmine quietly stood under the face of that infant, her entire body was covered in black markings and her pitch-black hair danced even though there was no wind. Her previously blood-red eyes were now covered by a terrifying black light, a black light which caused her face to seem even more ghastly white than it already was.

In her left hand, she held a pitch-black wheel. The wheel was about as large as her body and the blades that had unfolded from it were as dense as a devil’s fangs. She slowly raised those pitch-black eyes as she gazed upon the world that had been enshrouded with darkness before letting out a voice filled with hatred and resentment, a voice that seemed to be coming from the deepest parts of some devilish hell:

“You... deserve... to... die...”

“ALL... OF YOU... DESERVE... TO DIE!!

“...” The Star God Emperor’s eyes were fixed on the dark wheel in Jasmine’s hand. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

His body started to shake, it started to shake so fiercely that it seemed as if his god emperor body was going to fall apart, as the the most terrified and shaky voice he had ever issued in his life came from his lips:

“Evil... Infant... Wheel... of Myriad... Tribulations...”
