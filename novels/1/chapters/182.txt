nd a dish
to bring to a potluck

The following text has been translated to English:

"The next day, after having breakfast prepared by the Quanlong side, the discussions for the establishment of diplomatic relations finally took place.

The location was a relatively small meeting room.

Since this was quite a confidential discussion, it wasn't held in a large meeting room with a large number of people.

After exchanging greetings, they promptly began the discussion.

The first topic discussed was the movement of each country's citizens between the two nations. This included tourism, business, and in some cases, immigration.

Since it takes more than a day to reach each other by seaplane, it was suggested that both sides contribute to the creation of a waystation town at the midway point, along with immigration inspections.

Both parties agreed that they didn't want to allow individuals with ill intentions into their countries, so it was decided to establish embassies in each other's countries and have resident ambassadors.

Immigration inspections would be conducted at these embassies, and only those with issued visas would be allowed to travel freely.

This was almost in line with what Mr. Naval and Mr. Oug had argued for, as the current means of transportation between Quanlong and the Western countries was limited to seaplanes.

It's clear that it would take a year to travel on foot, as evidenced by Mr. Shaolin and the testimonies of those who had reached each other's countries before.

Before discussing trade, they also talked about exchange rates.

This involved determining the exchange rate between the currency in circulation in the Western countries and the currency of Quanlong.

It seemed that Quanlong still primarily used coins, as they had yet to introduce paper currency.

So, they decided upon the equivalence of one of our copper coins to a certain unit of Quanlong's currency, considering market value.

Up to this point, both sides had a clear understanding, and the discussions proceeded smoothly.

The situation changed when they discussed trade.

Mr. Naval proposed that everything from each other's countries should be included as items for trade.

Both Quanlong and Els thought that, considering the significant cultural differences between them, the introduction of new goods from each other's countries would be beneficial.

Hao seemed to agree with this idea, but his proposal was rejected by his aide's whisper.

"We can't include everything. We need to impose some restrictions."

Upon hearing these words, not only Mr. Naval but also us were puzzled.

"What items do you intend to restrict?""

Here is the translation of the text you provided:

"Nabal-san asked, and Hao-san replied as if it were a matter of course.

'It's dragon leather.'

Just as I expected.

Dragon leather has become a prohibited material in Quanlong, and its circulation has been stopped. They refused to export it.

"I see... But that's a strange situation."

'What's strange about it? What's wrong with limiting something that is banned in our country?'

"Well, I heard during our journey that there is quite a substantial stock of dragon leather."

'And what's the problem with that?'

"See, having a stock that can't be put into circulation is considered unsellable, right?"

'Unsellable stock?'

"Yes, that's right. We're willing to help dispose of that unsellable stock. Why are you opposing it?"

"That's because it's the law of this country!"

"Moreover, isn't that law supposed to restrict circulation within the country? It doesn't forbid export, right?"

"In that case, I propose amending the law!"

"Oh, no, we can't allow that. We can't accept such last-minute requests."

"Oh... Nabal-san has exposed the flaw in their law."

In fact, according to Mr. Shaolin, the ban on dragon hunting and the restriction on the circulation of dragon leather are considered strange laws. Maybe we can uncover something if we press further.

Hao-san, who had been glaring at Nabal-san for a while, eventually responded with a smug smile.

"So, in that case, in exchange for allowing the trade of dragon leather, let us also have the rights to the seaplanes."

Hao-san said this with a triumphant expression.

Is Nabal-san going to agree to that?

I thought, and then Nabal-san said with a composed expression.

"No, that won't be possible."

"What? You only make demands on one side and refuse to accept our demands?"

"It's not like that."

"Then what is it?"

"First of all, those seaplanes don't belong to us."

"Huh?"

"They were created by a certain individual and we use them as a form of lease."

"Wait, you mean...?"

Hao-san had an incredulous expression.

Well, I guess that makes sense.

Seaplanes are usually owned by countries, but those are technically owned by individuals, or rather, the Ultimate Magicians.

"So, seaplanes can't be used as a negotiation tool. As for the dragon leather, I did say we would accept the trade."

"What!? That's only if we exchange it for the seaplanes!"

"That's also a strange proposal."

"What's so strange about it?"

"You said, 'If we exchange it for seaplanes, we can trade dragon leather.' Isn't that what you said?"

"That's...!"

"So, you don't understand. You mean that if we make various demands in exchange, you're willing to sell dragon leather, right?"

"Huh?"

"I'm just saying that because those seaplanes are owned by individuals, we can't sell them. But we're willing to negotiate for the trade. Your turn to trade."

"...!"

Wow, they've completely outmaneuvered him.

Hao-san, red-faced with anger, couldn't come up with a response.

Nabal-san, with a calm expression, sipped his tea.

Next to him, Oug seemed quite impressed and watched Nabal-san.

Nabal-san, unchanging in expression until the end, finally presented the dragon leather trade with a smile.

Even though Nabal-san had been stared down by Hao-san, he continued to make his case calmly. In the end, Hao-san made one last-ditch effort and still complained.

"...But you haven't shown anything in return!"

"That's because we're the ones negotiating the dragon leather deal. It's not your place to be concerned."

"Grrr...!"

Even the last-ditch effort was brushed aside lightly, and Hao-san gritted his teeth in frustration.

However, after that, Hao-san was whispered something by his aide, and suddenly, he glared at the interpreter, Shaolin-san, and shouted.

Shaolin-san seemed like he wanted to say something but ultimately didn't offer any objections, and he didn't translate those words to us.

What's going on?"

When I thought about it, Oug spoke to Shaolin-san.

"What's wrong, Lord Shaolin? Can't you translate those words?"

Shaolin-san looked a bit troubled and then began translating what Hao-san had shouted.

"Well... I was told that I had leaked information to you, and... that's what they said."

Well, it's completely true, though.

As a result, Shaolin-san's information led to the country losing the negotiation. However, since Shaolin-san didn't really agree with his country's decision in the first place, this outcome was inevitable.

Still, it must be tough to be cursed at by people from your own country.

"That's all from our side. Is there anything else?"

"...I won't accept it."

"What?"

"I said I won't accept the trade of dragon leather! This negotiation is invalid!"

He's still saying that even at this stage.

However, if Hao-san doesn't agree, the trade won't be authorized. If they engage in unauthorized transactions, it could become smuggling, and that would provide Hao-san with a righteous cause. What will happen to the negotiation?

Thinking about this, Nabal-san sighed and said, "Let's call it a day for now. It seems you can't make a calm judgment."

Nabal-san said this and stood up.

"We'll resume the discussion... Well, you should have your own consultations as well. So, let's reconvene in three days."

"No matter how many times we discuss, it won't change!"

"It's not a children's discussion, and it won't all be settled in one negotiation, will it? Let's think it over once and then come to a conclusion."

"..."

"Well, three days from now, I'll come again. Until then, I'll arrange for accommodation elsewhere."

Saying this, Nabal-san left the conference room.

We, along with Shaolin-san, were about to follow him, but then Hao-san shouted something at Shaolin-san.

Shaolin-san calmly responded this time and joined us.

"Shaolin-san, what did he say?"

Although he came along with us, he had a somewhat sad expression, so I asked what had been said to him.

"Well... I was told that they won't allow you to come along, and I can't leave people here who don't understand the language of this country, so I came out to be with you."

Saying that, he smiled.

"I see... But are you sure it was a good move? In the end, it seems like we picked a fight with Quanlong."

"It's fine. In this case, I'm completely on Nabal's side. When I managed to persuade that Hao, I could barely contain my satisfaction."

"...Do you have a personal grudge against him?"

"It's him."

"What about him?"

"He's the mastermind behind the dragon hunting ban and the prohibition on dragon leather circulation!"

As Shaolin-san said this, a resentful expression appeared on his face.

"I don't know what he's thinking, but he created a false report and got the bill approved."

"Shaolin-san... So, for the Min family, Hao is an enemy?"

"Yes. It's not about the country; it's about him... I don't want to let him have his way."

"Well, it's quite a childish reason."

..."

In response to Oug's sarcastic remark, Shaolin-san bit his lip and fell silent.

"Well, thanks to that, we were able to gain the advantage. Isn't that good?"

Nabal-san stepped in between Oug and Shaolin-san, seemingly to dissipate a subtle tension in the air.

"In any case, Nabal-san, you did a remarkable job. You completely outmaneuvered him."

"Oh, well, ha-ha. Embarrassingly enough, I learned that from His Highness August."

"August's?"

What does he mean?

"Well, during the Three Nations Conference, I made similar demands to Hao, just like this... That's when they told me. Seaplanes are personal property, so they can't be used for negotiations."

"Come to think of it, I remember that."

"They don't understand our situation. What they desperately want at the moment is the seaplanes, right? But those are Lord Maou's... or rather, the Ultimate Magicians' possessions. So, I managed to use them."

"I see... Nabal-san, you really are amazing as the representative of a country."

"Aren't you going to praise me?"

Nabal-san teased, but this was genuinely heartfelt.

Negotiating by exploiting legal loopholes, concealing our information while extracting promises from the other side – it was all brilliantly executed.

And I wasn't the only one who thought that.

"If only they had negotiated like this back then, things would have been settled much faster."

"That's right, Your Highness, nothing more to say. Besides, at that time, that unpleasant fellow was there, which made me a bit emotional."

"Well, let's leave it at that."

"That's what I'm saying! Geez, Your Highness!"

Nabal-san, who had an air of invincibility during the negotiations with Hao-san, seemed a bit deflated when dealing with Oug. Well, he is the Crown Prince of a friendly nation, so maybe he can't be too aggressive.

As we discussed this, we left the Yuhou Palace, and there wasn't a single carriage waiting for us.

"Hmm, so there are no carriages available for us?"

"Isn't that fine? It's easier to understand when they're so openly hostile."

I thought we were considered guests, but this treatment makes it seem like we're quite the opposite. However, just as I was wondering what to do without a carriage, Shaolin-san spoke up.

"Everyone, you'll have to walk, but would you like to come to my house? You can stay the night there as well."

"Oh, really? I wasn't sure if we could find accommodations with the way things are going, so that works out nicely."

"Yes, please come and stay. This way, please."

Shaolin-san said this and began leading us. Familiar with the area, he walked confidently without hesitation. The delegation members followed closely behind, and we followed behind them, albeit with caution.

"Oug..."

"I know."

We addressed Oug because there were groups showing hostility towards us. Despite the failed negotiations, they were considering using force right away.

"Anyway, they aren't bothering to conceal their hostility."

"Indeed. Does this country not have any detection magic? Being this conspicuous would get us noticed right away."

After sensing the hostility, we positioned ourselves to surround Shaolin-san and the delegation members. We then directed our gaze towards the direction where the assassins were hiding.

At first glance, it seemed empty, but with detection magic, we could clearly see the opponent's magical power. Realizing they had been spotted, their magical power wavered in surprise, and they quickly withdrew.

They fled.

"Shishiry, what's wrong?"

Next to Shaolin-san, Sicily, who was on alert, was asked by Shaolin-san what was going on.

Sicily, who was asked, looked surprised.

"What's going on... Shaolin-san, you were being targeted, you know? We didn't know when they might attack, so we were on guard."

"Huh? Targeted!?"

"What? What do you mean?"

Not only Shaolin-san but also Leifan, who seemed like a seasoned warrior, were surprised.

I guess they really don't know about detection magic.

"We can sense the magical power of people who are in distant places. There's a lot of magical power with hostile intent in this area."

"Magical power!?"

"Yes, well, we showed that we were on guard as soon as we realized we were surrounded by hostility. When we directed our gaze towards the hidden assassins, they were surprised and ran away, so I think we're fine now."

My words surprised Leifan even more than Shaolin-san.

"Such magic...?"

"It seems that our magic cultures are quite different."

"It certainly seems that way."

"But with this situation, it seems we can't let our guard down even at Shaolin-san's house."

"Yeah... that's right."

Being presented with unreasonable laws from the country, and further having their lives targeted by the nation... I wonder what kind of emotions Shaolin-san is going through right now?

Even after the immediate danger had passed, Shaolin-san continued to walk with a dejected look.

And then, a large house came into view.

However...

"We've arrived. There it is... huh?"

What Shaolin-san pointed to was indeed that large house, but in front of it, a scuffle was taking place.

One side seemed like soldiers, but the other side...

"What, what are you doing?!"

Seeing the commotion, Shaolin-san sprinted toward it.

Then, one of the people involved in the scuffle shouted.

"Miss Shaolin!?"

I couldn't make out the rest, but I heard "Shaolin."

Does that mean that person is someone from Shaolin-san's house?
