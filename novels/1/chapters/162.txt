 thank-you note
to a guest speaker for my class

In short, we had quite a bit of free time.

Sicily and I spent most of that free time taking care of Silver, so we weren't keeping tabs on Aug's activities.

"Oh, you're doing the Crown Prince's job quite well."

"...I'd like to contest your evaluation of me, but well, there's communication through devices, but there are also negotiations involving paperwork. Sometimes, direct meetings are necessary."

"I see. So Aug, who can use the Gate, often came to Els, right?"

That's right. This place is a room Els prepared for me to use the Gate to move. Today, I'll go to the Presidential Palace by carriage from here."

"The Presidential Palace?"

I know Els' president, Mr. Aaron... or rather, I'm in a senior disciple position to him.

To meet such a senior disciple, you're changing into a new uniform and taking a carriage to the Presidential Palace? Does that mean today's business is an official request from the president?

"It feels like quite a big deal."

When I said that, Aug let out a tired sigh.

"It is a big deal, actually. I can't go into detail, as the president, Mr. Aaron, will explain, but it feels like it's going to be even more troublesome."

The Crown Prince of a country can't speak here... It only makes me feel like it's going to be a troublesome matter.

"Nevertheless, this is an official request from Els to us, the Ultimate Magicians. We can't refuse a request from the top of a nation, even if we're not operational as an organization yet."

"We haven't started operating as an organization yet..."

"That's right."

We graduated from the academy just yesterday. According to the plan, administrative staff were scheduled to be dispatched from various countries after this, not only for surveillance but also to ensure that we don't harbor malicious thoughts towards the world. We were supposed to officially start operating once those people arrived.

This request came before we could wait for that.

"Is Mr. Aaron feeling quite rushed?"

"Rushed isn't the word; it's more like the push from those around him is getting noisy."

Mr. Aaron is the president, as the name suggests, the representative of a country chosen through a general election by the citizens. Unlike Earls Hyde and other kingdoms, it's not hereditary. That means there are individuals who might want to overthrow Mr. Aaron, and those people will likely try to find fault with him.

Saying that our actions are slow, huh?

In that case, there's something I want to confirm.

"But, the fact that this request came to us at this timing..."

"That's right. President Aaron waited for our graduation despite being pushed by those around him."

I see... Mr. Aaron did consider us, despite all the things being said about him. It's not because of some grandma's fears, right? That seems most likely.

Anyway, he showed such consideration, and as a junior disciple, I need to meet the expectations of the senior disciple. Like this, we got on the carriage stationed at the building and headed towards the Presidential Palace.

We split into several carriages, and in the one I was on, Sicily, Maria, and Aug, the usual crew, were all there. We'll probably arrive soon, but there's something that had been bothering me during this carriage ride, so I decided to ask Aug.

"Hey, Aug."

"What is it?"

"...What's happening in Darm?"

"Darm, huh..."

Coming to Els, which has a republican system led by merchants, reminded me of something. After the War of the Demon King, Darm, a country that tried to declare war on the world but was quickly suppressed, and then the monarchy was abolished.

At the time, General Hiiro Cartoune, who had prevented the king's outrageous actions in advance, became the interim head of state, but later, the Cartoune family officially took the position of prime minister in Darm. The country changed its name from the Kingdom of Darm to the Republic of Darm and completely abolished the aristocracy.

The former nobility was completely extinguished, and the country is now governed by elected representatives from the citizens. Els also elects its president through a general election by the citizens, but it can't be called a complete democracy.

Only governors who rule various towns can run for president, and these governors are elected by influential merchants. The selection of these governors is determined by a secret meeting among the merchants, not by a citizen's vote. So, why are governors chosen by merchants in a closed meeting?

It's because merchants know more about each other than the average citizen. From their business acumen to their personal characteristics.

Furthermore, and I apologize for saying this, the low level of education among Els citizens is also a reason.

It's not the former empire, but only a few wealthy individuals can afford to attend school. Most people cannot, and as a result, education tends to be lacking in this aspect. Mandatory education for those under fifteen is provided in some places, such as Earls Hyde.

For these reasons, the general public cannot participate in the selection of governors. However, the presidential election is a general election conducted by the citizens.

Why is that? It's because you can judge whether a candidate governor is competent by looking at the development of the city they govern. The Election Management Committee at the Presidential Palace compiles evaluation materials for each city fairly, allowing citizens to assess which governor's election as president would benefit them, and they cast their votes accordingly. This is how Els elects its president.

However, this time, Darm has chosen a complete democracy.

Darm isn't a very large country, but it has several cities within its borders. They have chosen representatives for these cities, local council members, and even national parliament members, all elected by ordinary citizens. In other words, the governance that was previously handled by the nobility ruling each city has been replaced by representatives of the people.

The transition from an aristocracy to a democracy. Even looking at the history of past lives, it's not that uncommon. However...

"As Shin was concerned about, it's not going well."

"Exactly..."

The transition to a complete democracy in Darm this time. My concerns about it. It's... the complete abolition of the aristocracy, excluding them entirely from the political arena. Those who previously managed the cities and countries were the nobles. In essence, they have completely excluded political professionals and replaced them with amateur citizens as elected representatives.

Without any knowledge of how to govern cities or countries, can they suddenly engage in politics conducted by the citizens? Normally, when transitioning from an aristocracy to a rule by the masses, I thought they would leave some members of the former ruling class in the government. I was concerned about the complete exclusion of the aristocracy, though...

As I feared, it seems it's not going well.

"Bribery is rampant among the legislators and, on top of that, there are rumors of crime organizations linked to some of the legislators."

"It's only been a little over a year since the system changed, right? Is that kind of thing happening already?"

"It seems there are a considerable number of individuals with ties to the criminal underworld among those elected as legislators."

"They used their subordinates to secure votes through organized crime...?"

"The individuals from the criminal underworld who had previously eluded the government's surveillance have gained legitimate power. You could call Darm a den of darkness now."

"But there's nothing we can do about it, right?"

"It would be considered interference in their internal affairs. We can only watch from the sidelines. It's frustrating."

By the way, why did Mr. Cartoune of Darm do this?

Certainly, Darm had a few failures. The military's leadership went rogue and almost let a Demon slip through their fingers. A diplomat, of all people, nearly killed Ekaterina, the Pope of the Church of the Creator. In reality, all of them were being controlled by Demons, as later discovered, but the trust between nations had been severely damaged.

Finally, the king himself went rogue, and it happened after they had successfully defeated all the Demons. It was clearly for personal gain. I can't say I don't understand why they wanted to take power away from such a royal family...

Did they not anticipate this outcome when they handed over politics to the citizens so abruptly?... No, they probably didn't, judging by the results.

The reforms they pursued to regain the nation's reputation have further damaged their trust as a nation. With considerable anxiety about Darm's future, we reached the Els Presidential Palace.a charter
