"It blew away the wheat fields in grand fashion...

I was genuinely scolded by Oug for that, and I went to the royal castle to honestly explain what happened.

I felt like a student waiting to be scolded by a teacher.

Even though I'm a student at the Advanced Magic Academy.

So, with a solemn heart, I waited for the verdict. But King Kurt praised us for repelling the demon and said that the damage was limited to only a part of the wheat fields.

I was relieved, but Oug was not pleased with this outcome. He promised a significant reduction in the rental fees for the magical tools he lent us and a large purchase of wheat.

He explained that they couldn't make it entirely free because the Kurt Kingdom would feel a psychological burden if they handed over the demon subjugation to us and waived the rental fees for the magical tools.

King Kurt even begged me not to do that.

"Hmm... Adjusting the price of wheat for the next season will be quite a challenge."

"Sorry..."

As we were leaving the royal castle of the Kurt Kingdom and heading outside the capital, Oug muttered.

"It's good to be strong, but you should learn how to use your strength more wisely."

"I'm really sorry."

"Ah well... it's alright. I just wanted to vent a bit and think about the future. Adjusting the price of wheat is nothing compared to the troubles you might cause."

"Wait a minute... What exactly are you expecting?"

"That's up to you... like accidentally wiping out a whole town, or the country disappearing, or the world coming to an end..."

"Am I a destruction god!? I won't do anything like that!"

"Huh?"

"Huh?"

Everyone reacted with disbelief.

"I honestly thought I did quite well with that level of damage..."

"I weirdly agree with His Highness's explanation!"

"Oh, um, please don't accidentally destroy the world!"

"Am I a demon lord!?"

Why is everyone's assessment of me leaning towards a demon lord!?

"Demon lord... it has a nice ring to it..."

"Perfect for a wizard king like you, Mr. Wolford."

"Shin, the Demon Lord, it is then..."

"Stop! Please, just stop!"

In this world, there are no so-called heroes or demon lords like in the previous life's games.

So, the term "demon lord" doesn't exist.

Therefore, when everyone says "demon lord," it ends up referring to a wizard king."

Because of the careless words I blurted out, it seems like I might become the first Demon Lord! I can't handle any more embarrassing names!

"Hmm, Shin's alias has been decided."

"Don't decide it! Please!"

"Why not? It's perfect for a Wizard King like you to be called 'Demon Lord Shin.'"

"Yeah, I can't think of a better alias than that."

"Think of something else! There has to be something else!"

Don't give up! If you give up now, it's all over!

"Well, no matter how much Shin denies it, an alias naturally spreads. It will soon stick."

"It's over!"

No way! Demon Lord as an alias can't be accepted so easily!

Why didn't this world have heroes or demon lords in the past? If they did, we wouldn't have such aliases!

"Then please, open the gate soon."

My major issue was brushed aside, and I was asked to open the gate.

Can such a tragic thing even happen?

We had to return home, so I had no choice but to open the gate at the usual guard station.

"Oh, Your Highnesses have returned!"

"Welcome back! Congratulations on defeating the demon once again!"

"Hail to Prince August! Hail to the Ultimate Magicians!"

As soon as we arrived at the station, the soldiers who had gathered there cheered for us.

"What, has the news already spread?"

"Yes, we received word from our Kurt Kingdom ambassador a while ago. The Ultimate Magicians defeated the demon that appeared in Kurt Kingdom with no casualties. It's already known in the town. With Prince August's crown prince inauguration celebration, the city is in an uproar."

"I see, it's probably best not to go out in the city."

Oug suggested not going out into the city.

Wait, were we planning to go out into the city? Originally, it was supposed to be a celebration for Oug's crown prince inauguration. But if he shows up, won't it become a big commotion?

Lately, I've been feeling like Oug's sense of things is getting weird...

"Of course! It would be unthinkable to go out in the midst of this commotion... The Ultimate Magicians should also restrain themselves."

"Huh? Us too?"

"What's been said can't be taken back. The names and backgrounds of the Ultimate Magicians are already widely known."

"What!?!"

Is everyone's identity exposed, including mine and Oug's?

What happened to personal information?

...Well, that concept doesn't exist here yet.

"So, me and Ellie are fine!"

"No way!"

For once, Oug made an unusual comment.

Even Mei seems to be losing her sense of things...

Anyway, I reported the details of our state visits to Dis-Ojisan for now.

Elise and Iis contacted, and after various arrangements, it seems the tri-country conference will take place after the long vacation.

Unlike the small countries we visited this time, it takes a lot of time to organize a meeting with the three major countries.

After reporting to Dis-Ojisan, we ended up in Oug's room.

"It's such a big festival, and we can't even participate!"

"I didn't expect our names to be known..."

"I... am just a normal girl..."

"Olivia, give up. There's no other town girl who can casually defeat a demon while being part of the Ultimate Magicians."

"Come to think of it, it's amazing, isn't it? A group where everyone can defeat demons..."

"Defeating demons, huh..."

"Shin, what's wrong?"

"Well... I've noticed something after defeating demons this time and the previous time."

I've felt something after defeating demons this time and before.

Compared to the time when I faced the 'demonized Kurt,' they were weaker.

"I had a hard time blocking the magic of the demonized Kurt. I even suffered some damage."

I got a burn on my hand.

"Compared to that... I easily blocked the demon's magic this time. The attacks were monotonous, with no coordination. What could it be?"

"Hmm... Even though Shin is saying that, he's the only one who has actually faced the demonized Kurt. We don't really understand it... but if Shin says so, then it must be true."

"Indeed, the actions of the demons don't make sense. You can argue that they overestimated their demon powers and attacked head-on without strategy, but it's strange to do the same thing the second time."

"Did anyone feel Strom's magical power?"

"I didn't."

"Me neither. If Claude, who is good at sensing, and Shin didn't feel it, maybe it wasn't there this time either?"

"That's true..."

What could it be? Is Strom really trying to unify the world using this method?

And why is there a difference in the strength of the demons?

It doesn't make sense. It really doesn't make sense at all.

"Well... for now, we can only react to the actions of the demons. If we can establish an alliance, we can take the initiative next time. We'll have to put off solving the mystery for now."

Is that all we can do? We can quickly respond to the small countries around the former empire, so for now, we'll have to wait and see.

Moreover, we don't have enough personnel to invade the former empire. The territory of the former empire has become like a den of monsters, and advancing with a small number of troops would be difficult.

We could probably force our way through on our own, but... as Oug said earlier, we would win too easily, and we don't even know the location of the demons' stronghold.

As one of the former Four Great Nations, the territory is vast, and even if we advance painstakingly, we can't imagine how long it would take.

We might miss our chance if we don't get the cooperation of at least two countries and launch a simultaneous attack with a large army.

Monsters have overflowed from the empire, and each country has allocated a significant portion of its forces to deal with the situation, so it's not possible to gather all the forces in one place.

So, for now, we can only react to the demons' actions. If we don't, we might miss our chance. We are waiting for the formation of the alliance because of these various dilemmas.

But the tri-country conference won't take place until after the break, and we have nothing to do now.

"Your Highness, do we have any events scheduled for later?"

"Since Shin and Claude's engagement party and my crown prince inauguration ceremony are already over, there aren't any major events left."

"Then, I want to go out and have fun with everyone!"

Alice proposed that she wanted to go out and have fun as part of the future plans.

"We've been in training camp, practicing, and engaging in combat with demons since the long break started... We haven't had a proper break! It's a rare holiday!"

"But we went on a trip, didn't we?"

"That was just a side trip for Your Highness and Shin, right? I want to go somewhere purely for fun!"

Indeed, we took short breaks between training sessions, but we didn't really have leisure time for pure fun.

"Yeah, you're right. In terms of taking a break, we haven't really rested."

"I want to go, I want to go! I want to go somewhere and have fun!"

"Alice, you're like a child."

"Ugh! To be called a child by a pure and innocent princess like Mei..."

The atmosphere lightened with the exchange between Alice and Mei.

"If that's the case, you can visit my family's estate."

"Huh! Is that okay? Can we go to the Rittenheim Resort?"

"Of course. Everyone is in high spirits due to the consecutive demon subjugations now. You can go to the resort without any problems."

Julius' words were met with cheers from everyone.

Is it really that amazing? A warrior's resort.

"Do you know about it, Shin? The Rittenheim Resort is even a coveted place for nobles. Our royal family, in particular, often goes to Rittenheim when they talk about a resort."

"Is that so? I only heard a brief explanation before, so I didn't know what kind of place it was."

"It has everything—sea, mountains, and more! It's fun!"

"Oh... I think I've had enough of mountains...?"

"Well, Shin is used to mountains, after all."

"I'm more than familiar with the mountains. Camping might not be enjoyable."

I probably have the skills to live in the mountains for the rest of my life. So, I'm not too excited about camping now.

"In that case, let's go to the beach. That way, Shin will enjoy it, right?"

"Good idea, Sisily."

"What? What's up?"

"Going to the beach means wearing swimsuits, right? Sisily, what are you planning by showing Shin your swimsuit?"

"Oh! I-I didn't mean it that way! I just thought it would be better if Shin had a good time!"

"Sisily, thank you."

"Shin, did you understand?"

"Yeah... I'm looking forward to the swimsuits."

"Geez! Geez!"

Sisily, who kept blushing, was cute, so I'll let her off the hook.

Anyway, we were supposed to be talking about the demons, but somehow, we ended up in bonus time.

Since we can only react to the demons and our countermeasures are in place for now, I might as well take a break.

"By the way, we had guardians during the training camp, but what about the trip? The previous ones were in foreign countries and on the down-low, but how about domestic trips?"

"Hmm..."

"Did you forget?"

"Your Highness Augustus... you really seem to forget your position these days."

"It's Shin's fault."

"Don't use me as an excuse!"

"Just bring your families with you. Luckily or unluckily, many cancellations have occurred due to the recent demon commotion."

"Is that okay!?"

Julius's resolute statement prompted everyone to shout in agreement.

"This time, we'll pay the fee as expected. It's not a training camp; we're going for pure fun."

"You don't have to worry about it."

"If you don't pay, you'll feel reluctant and won't enjoy it to the fullest. Besides, you mentioned there were many cancellations, didn't you?"

"That's true, but..."

"Julius, I agree with Shin. This isn't about training or practice. So, it's only fair to pay an appropriate fee."

"I'm good with it too! I earned quite a bit from monster hunting during the training camp!"

"I'm in."

"Count me in."

"I want to contribute too."

It seemed everyone was fine with paying the fee. When it's free, people tend to hold back.

"I understand. However, I'll provide a discount. Otherwise, it would trouble me."

"Well, that's a compromise. Oh, Sisily, you're good; I'll cover your share."

"Huh? No, you don't have to."

"I'll pay too."

"Me too."

"We received free lodging from the Claude family, so we should do something in return, right?"

There didn't seem to be any objections from everyone.

"So, as a token of our gratitude for providing the training camp location, shall we invite the Claude family to join us?"

"Please, that's not necessary. We only provided our home..."

"How about considering it as a gift from a husband to his wife's family?"

"Wife..."

Oh, did he soften a bit?

"We're celebrating our engagement, right?"

"Isn't that a good idea? Oh, invite Cecilia and Sylvia as well, okay? Or else, they might sulk."

Even Royce...

"If it's considered as a celebration, it would be impolite to decline further. I understand. We'll graciously accept your kind offer."

"Great, let's discuss the dates and details. How will we get there? By flying?"

"Not this time. It'll be a considerable number of people, and for economic benefits at the intermediate towns, we'll use carriages for both the journey there and back."

"Oh, the ones Cecil mentioned. Understood. So when are we going?"

"Let's see..."

And so, it was decided that they would visit Julius's family in three days, as everyone wanted more time for preparations.

"What did you say? You're going to Rittenheim Resort?"

"Well, that's quite lavish."

To avoid causing a commotion by walking back, they were sent to their respective homes through the gate.

After saying their goodbyes at home, Shin, along with Sisley and Maria, returned to their house. There, they found an elderly man and woman who appeared to have just finished their hot spring bath, and Shin shared the recent decision with them.

"Since the long holiday started, we haven't had time for fun. Julius is offering a discount, so we've decided to go for leisure."

"Times have certainly changed, students going on vacation to Rittenheim Resort..."

"Oh, and he said we could bring our families too."

"You've got some great friends!"

Upon hearing that they could bring their families, the grandmother's excitement suddenly skyrocketed.

"Well, if that's the case, we need to prepare right away. Sisley, Maria!"

"Yes."

"What is it?"

"We're going shopping for swimsuits now! Come with us!"

"Yes, yes!"

With that, the excited grandmother whisked Sisley and Maria away.

"Grandma in a swimsuit... it's a bit..."

"Give it up. Don't even think about it..."

They shuddered at the thought of what might happen later.

In the end, the three-day preparation period was mostly spent on shopping. As it turns out, the women's swimsuits were kept secret, meant to be a surprise for the others.

On the day of departure, not all family members could gather due to work commitments. It was unavoidable, but they understood.

"Hey! Long time no see, Shin!"

"Oh, long time no see, Mr. Glen."

Among the crowd, a man approached and struck up a conversation.

It was Alice's father, Mr. Glen Corner.

"I never dreamed I'd get to go to Rittenheim Resort with my daughter already. You must have made quite a bit from monster hunting!"

"That's right. I've been working hard to earn."

"Seems like it. I'm going to work harder to make sure I don't lose to my daughter's earnings!"

"By the way, thanks for accepting the business association offer."

"What are you saying? Becoming a director in a company founded by the new hero is a massive promotion! When I heard about it from Mr. Tom, my heart and body trembled!"

Glen had a determined look on his face.

"Glen, you don't have to push yourself so hard."

"Oh, it's you, Reverend! Good morning!"

"Yes, good morning. If you put too much pressure on yourself, you might make unexpected mistakes."

"Yes... you're right."

"Don't stress yourself too much. The magical tools he creates can't be replicated by anyone. They'll sell themselves."

The conversation continued, and the departure day arrived.

"That's a different matter, but from a business perspective..."

It seemed that Grandma had met with Mr. Glen a few times regarding the business association matter, which made her more at ease. The other family members, however, didn't approach them much.

"Good morning, Shin."

"Good morning, Shin! Thanks for today!"

Sisley and the rest of the Claude family arrived. Since this time, the entire Claude family was invited, there was a considerable number of people.

"Inviting the whole family to Rittenheim Resort together is wonderful, dear brother-in-law."

"That's absolutely right, big sister."

"Hehe, both of you, don't you dare steal Shin from Sisley."

"No, I won't!"

Sisley grabbed my arm and vehemently protested.

"I won't take him away..."

"I wonder if we'll see this scene throughout the vacation..."

Both of them didn't seem to have boyfriends despite being beautiful.

"What about Siegfried-niichan?"

I asked because they mentioned he was part of the Mage Corps. I wondered if he had a boyfriend.

"Siegfried-sama is... Well, he's handsome, strong, and his specs are excellent, but..."

"His womanizing tendencies..."

"Or rather, our commander is quite something... Many of the men in the Mage Corps are womanizers."

"What's going on, the Arsheid Mage Corps! It seems like it's become a group of playboys!"

While they were discussing this, what about Lois?

"How can I make myself stand out more in the presence of Merlin-sama?"

"That's our eternal theme..."

They sighed and had a lonely conversation in the distance.

...It's quite a pitiable sight.

Once everyone gathered, they split into their respective family carriages and set off towards the Rittenheim territory. Sisley tried to go to her family's carriage, but Irene asked her to ride in our carriage, so she joined us.

It was said that the journey to the Rittenheim territory from the capital would take about two days. Horses equipped with magical items allowed the carriages to move smoothly.

Even so, the carriages were equipped with what seemed like suspensions, and the roads were well-maintained, so they didn't shake much. Perhaps these were coil springs? The slight shaking had a long wavelength.

I wonder if I can make four-wheel independent suspensions and springs somehow.

"Shin... You're not thinking of something ridiculous again, are you?"

"I think there are too many people around me who can read minds."

"Your expression gives it away. Anyway, were you plotting something?"

"Plotting sounds bad. I was thinking about how to make the carriage ride more comfortable."

Since it's not engine-driven but pulled by horses, I don't need to think about defogging, and I think I can make it more comfortable somehow.

I haven't discussed it with the Bean Workshop owner yet, but when I return, maybe I should consult with Lois and Glen first. After all, I'm planning to start my own trading company.

While I was thinking about such things, the inevitable happened again.

"Oh, you're here."

"Medium-sized, I see. Oh, there's a large one too."

"So, shall we do the usual..."

"The lottery?"

"That's the one where there's no regret later."

While Sisley and I had this conversation, we got off the stopped carriage.

"Ho ho, calling a large monster a lottery..."

"...Looks like even Sisley has been influenced by that girl..."

I overheard the conversation between the old man and grandma, but the opponents were disaster-level mass-produced demons, so we wouldn't usually bother with them. However, since everyone's family was here today...

"I want to do it! Let me do it!"

"Let me handle this."

"I'll do it this time."

"The lottery! Walford-kun, give us the lottery!"

Even Olivia claimed that she wanted to do it. Where are the normal city girls?

As for the monsters... they seem to have increased compared to when I first checked.

There are more of them now. Also, their reactions...

"Given the size of this group, the monsters probably see it as a feast."

"So, there won't be a lottery this time. We'll all intercept them."

"Understood!"

"I'm in too."

"Your Highness, wait!"

"What's wrong? These monsters don't even qualify for subjugation, do they?"

"What are you saying? Behind us... There's a disaster-class monster approaching from behind!"

To be honest, we don't need guards for our journey, but they said it wouldn't make sense for members of the royal family and nobles to travel without an escort. So, knights and mages from the royal escort are accompanying us.

Well, it's just for show.

The escort members seemed to have noticed the situation as well.

A group of medium-sized monsters with a large one mixed in, and now even a disaster-class monster had appeared.

But the number of monsters has really increased. Disaster-level ones rarely used to appear.

The escorts had a mix of tension and despair on their faces, while the families of the team turned pale, trembling.

"This is... the appearance of a disaster-level monster..."

"It was supposed to be a fun vacation..."

It seemed that Cecilia and Sylvia had never fought a disaster-level monster before, and they wore an expression of half-resignation.

"I want to go too."

"What? You..."

These must be Tony's parents. Since they mentioned being knights, it seemed Tony had started to express his desire to fight as well.

"Let your fathers watch from there."

"What?! How can I let only my son go into such a dangerous place?"

"Well, it's not that big of a deal."

"What, what did you say?"

"Well, just watch from there."

Saying this, Tony prepared his vibration sword.

"Everyone, the disaster-level... is that a lion? Whoever gets there first wins. Let's go!"

"Ooh!"

First, they needed to clear out the medium-sized monsters! Each of them unleashed magic without incantations.

Magic rained down on the group of medium-sized monsters, delivering a shock that shook the ground.

With this, they were able to thin the numbers of the medium-sized and large monsters.

The dust from the landing magic still hung in the air, but they could sense the positions of the monsters using magic detection.

Tony and I activated our jet boots and flew toward the lion-like monster.

"Ah! That's cheating!"

Alice's protest could be heard, but it was a race to be the first!

"Osshaa! Got it!"

"I'll get it first!"

We both swung our vibration swords simultaneously at the target, but...

"Uowa!"

Multiple spells suddenly hit the target, which was the lion-like monster they were aiming for.

When we hastily dodged and looked back, Alice and Olivia were in postures that suggested they had cast magic.

"That was close!"

"It's a race to be the first, right?"

"You two are so unfair! I want to do that too!"

"It's not very useful if you can't use a sword."

"Mm, but my magic hit first!"

"What are you talking about? It was me!"

"It was me!"

"Either way is fine."

Everyone was extra enthusiastic since their families were watching.

They defeated the monsters so thoroughly that there was barely a trace of them left.

"Well, at least you've been able to show it off."

"I didn't really need to show this to my family."

Tony and I returned to everyone, and then we all went back to our families.

Everyone was left speechless.

"What... is this?"

"Shirley... Shirley blew away a bear in one hit..."

"Alice... defeated a lion?"

"Our daughter... Our daughter, who was a waitress not too long ago..."

"I couldn't see Tony's movements..."

"She didn't flinch when facing the lion-like monster and attacked so boldly..."

The families were in awe of how they had defeated medium-sized, large, and disaster-level monsters in the blink of an eye.

Only Tony's mother, a former knight, was impressed, watching Tony charging into the lion-like monster and crying.

She really is the mother of a former knight. Her sense of awe is a bit misplaced.

"See? It's not a big deal, is it?"

"You all... have become this strong..."

"Well, to deal with magic beasts, you need to be at this level."

"At this level..."

"How about that? Dad! Isn't it amazing!"

"It's so amazing that I don't know what to say..."

"Sister? What's wrong?"

"Cecilia... you were good at healing magic and not very skilled with offensive magic, right?"

"Yes, that's right. I was the weakest when it came to that..."

"And yet, with that..."

"Yes."

They were asked various questions by their families, and they all looked a bit proud. It felt like a school open house.

"...I'm sorry, everyone. Our grandson turned you all into this..."

"No, no! It's not like that at all! In fact, we can't thank you enough for training our boy like this!"

"Do you really think that way?"

"Of course, Master! With this level of ability, the public's perception that this group could save the world is completely understandable!"

Other families nodded in agreement with Glen's words.

"To see my own child walking the path of a hero... what a wonderful thing that is!"

Tony's mother's words seemed to represent everyone's feelings.

With the monster subjugation that also served as a presentation to their families coming to an end, they were about to set off again when they noticed the escorts nearby.

"Ultimate Magicians... what an incredible group..."

"To be honest, we're just for show... but it was worth coming just to see everyone's battles..."

"Their abilities are just too overwhelming, and I can't even feel jealous..."

"I'm... becoming a fan of the Ultimate Magicians."

"Me too!"

"Count me in! In fact, let's start a fan club!"

"Agreed!"

A strange decision had been made.
