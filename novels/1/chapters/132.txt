"You guys!"

In front of us, the demons appeared, causing my emotions to skyrocket instantly. I remembered that these demons almost killed Sicily once before.

As I remembered that, my anger took over.

"Calm down, Shin."

"No!"

In the grip of my anger, I was about to attack the demons when Oug stopped me with a chop to the head.

"What the hell are you doing?"

I protested after being abruptly chopped on the head, and this time, Oug put me in a headlock and whispered.

"Just calm down. If you let anger control you and annihilate them, we won't be able to find out their total numbers or their objectives."

"What's the point of worrying about that now?"

I whispered back, going along with Oug.

"There's no way around it! Without knowing their total numbers, there might be some leftovers, just like last time."

"Mmm... you have a point."

I recalled that we had a tough time last time because of that.

"You should stay quiet at the back."

"Understood."

Finally released from the headlock, I followed Oug's instructions and took a step back.

"It's the first time I've seen His Highness in a headlock."

"That's right."

"Wow, Thor, you've been through..."

Thor and Julius, who were with me, started talking.

At that moment, I noticed that Julius was wearing an iron gauntlet.

"Julius, about that..."

"Hmm? Oh, I'm not as skilled with a sword as you or Tony. I thought I'd use my specialty of physical enhancement for direct punches."

I see, so he's going to punch.

"Julius, fold your arms behind your back to hide the gauntlet."

"Like this?"

"Yeah."

With Julius folding his arms behind his back, it looked like he was in a 'rest' position to an observer.

And the gauntlet was hidden behind his body.

During this moment when the demons were distracted, talking to Oug, I took the opportunity to bestow magic upon Julius's gauntlet.

After completing the enchantment, I glanced at the demons, but they didn't seem to notice our actions. That was a relief.

"Shin-dono, what kind of magic did you bestow?"

"Ah, well..."

While I was explaining the enchantment I applied to Julius's gauntlet, the demons continued their conversation with Oug.

"What a polite greeting. I didn't expect you to come attacking with a rare dragon turned into a monster."

"What did you say...?"

"However, I had heard a rumor that there was one instance of a dragon being turned into a monster in the past, but it seems it wasn't as impressive as they say. Oh... does the one who turned you into monsters lack power?"

As Oug said this, the demons' magical power suddenly swelled.

...As expected of Oug. When it came to provoking others, he was unparalleled.

"You... insulting Lord Strohm!!"

"Hmm, I only spoke the truth. For demons, you seem quite loyal."

"Of course! Lord Strohm is our savior; he rescued us from the oppressive empire!"

"Even though you've been turned into demons?"

"We wished for this! You have no right to criticize us!"

"On your own... it's quite hopeless."

Oug sighed with disbelief, but the demons seemed to smile for some reason.

"No, we were saved. We were exploited and abused by the empire. Lord Strohm rescued us."

"That's right! Lord Strohm freed us from the hellish days!"

"And not only that, he granted us the power to overthrow the detested empire!"

"Small fry like you probably wouldn't understand!"

The demons around them also started shouting at Oug, clearly worked up.

They were quite emotional.

Despite the barrage of shouts, Oug, unperturbed, calmly responded and continued.

"I really don't understand. You were oppressed only by the emperor and nobles. If you want revenge, it should be against those individuals alone. Why massacre innocent civilians who share the same fate?"

The demons fell silent at Oug's words.

"Just based on that fact alone, there's no sympathy left for you. You're just bloodthirsty monsters!"

After raising his voice a bit, Oug looked down on the demons and taunted them.

"Of course, Strohm, who created you, must be the same."

Honestly, this line makes it hard to discern who the real villains are...

But it was undeniably effective.

After Oug said this, the restrained magical power of the demons swelled all at once.

"You insolen...!!"

The demons' eyes were bloodshot.

They were really fuming.

"You intend to wage a war on the world with just this number. Your heads must be quite messed up. Or perhaps... do you have other reinforcements?"

"Don't mock us! It's just us and the executives!! To bring about the world's annihilation, we wouldn't rely on anyone else's help!"

They spoke.

The demons present here and the executives are their entire numbers. The exact count of the executives was unclear, but for now, it seemed like all the regular demons were here. The total number was around... 30 to 40, it seemed.

And as expected, these demons' goal was not world conquest but world annihilation. Why they came up with such an idea was unknown, but they were actively trying to execute it.

If that's the case...

"Hmph. That's all I needed to hear."

Oug, who had been taunting the demons, said this and began gathering his own magical power.

"Well then, let's settle this, shall we? As per your beloved Strohm's words..."

Oug smirked once more as he said this.

"It's the beginning of the game."

What's going on...?

Oug seems to be taking the spotlight!!
