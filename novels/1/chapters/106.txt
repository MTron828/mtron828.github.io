Schrodtrom's mocking laughter suddenly echoed.

Those of us who had heard his voice immediately recognized it as Schrodtrom, but most of the people present seemed to be hearing that voice for the first time.

"Hey, Shin. Schrodtrom... What is he?"

"Mr. Galan, is this your first time hearing it? The owner of this voice is Oliver Schrodtrom, the leader of the demons."

"No way...!"

In answering Mr. Galan's question, tension spread among the commanders from various countries. It's understandable. After all, being the leader of the demons meant he was the head of the opposing force. Essentially, the final boss. He forcibly created demons and even transformed humans into demons. The existence of someone who could do all that had appeared in this place, even if it was only his voice, and feeling fear was inevitable.

Amidst the fear and confusion that permeated the area, Schrodtrom's voice echoed again through the amplifying magic.

"Well, when I incite the monsters, I wondered how you'd react... And look at the incredible things you've done, Shin Wolford."

Incite the monsters... He played a prank like this just to see how we'd react!

"As always, you're a joker!"

"Calm down, Shin. He came out for a reason, he might have some ulterior motive."

Schrodtrom's jesting actions provoked my anger, and I couldn't help but raise my voice, but I was pacified by Olug. Olug was probably also quite angry inside, but he seemed to have made the decision to assess the future actions of the demons, whose actions had been difficult to understand until now. That's what I presumed, and I waited for Schrodtrom's next words. I calmed down a bit and decided to listen to what he had to say.

"Well, now everything around us is covered by walls, isolating us."

Schrodtrom was now taking stock of the situation.

Indeed, we had hastily built the wall to prevent the large-scale calamity-class monsters from getting out, but as a result, it had become a form of isolation for Schrodtrom and the demons.

"Inside this walled area, the calamity-class monsters are jostling together, creating a very interesting situation."

Now that I thought about it, I hadn't checked inside the walls from above. What on earth was going on in there?

Because the wall was used as a material, there should be a deep trench in front of it, which should prevent anyone from approaching the wall.

"Hehe, I wonder what will happen if this wall collapses?"

"What?! Are you planning to destroy the wall!?"

One of the commanders overreacted to Schrodtrom's ominous words. However, for me, it was within expectations. Schrodtrom would naturally consider breaking the wall, and he had the power to do it with ease. However, for others, it seemed unexpected, and unease began to spread among the various country's armies gathered in this place.

"Oh? Wolford, you don't seem surprised? Did you anticipate this?"

"Yeah. It's only natural to think that way."

We... or rather, I, who has had direct confrontations with him, do not underestimate Schrodtrom. It's obvious that he can easily break such a wall. It's not something to be surprised about at this point. Nonetheless, we built the wall because we wanted to buy some time for discussions to overcome this situation.

I crossed my arms, as if to say that I could see through Schrodtrom's thoughts.

"Now, the reason I've addressed all of you today is that I have a proposal."

...

Oops, my voice didn't reach Schrodtrom. Presumably, he saw us through far-sight magic and used amplification magic to speak to me. I answered without using amplification magic, thinking I was responding to him directly. My face turned red with embarrassment as I continued to cross my arms. Next to me, Olug was desperately biting his back teeth, trying hard not to laugh, with a stern look on his face.

Others couldn't hold back their laughter, either. Because my voice was only audible to the people around me, the commanders seemed to interpret it differently.

"His Highness August seems very angry..."

"The Ultimate Magicians' reaction... What on earth is he provoking?"

In a situation where the enemy's boss had appeared, we should absolutely not be laughing.

For that reason, it seems that they thought we were angry or afraid of Schrodtrom's request.

This is bad. Could this lead to a decrease in everyone's morale?

With such a sense of crisis, Schrodtrom began to talk about this proposal or whatever it was.

"As a matter of fact, I've made a certain decision."

Decision?

"A decision... considering this situation, have you finally decided to conquer the world?"

The moment Schrodtrom spoke those words, our world seemed to come to a halt. Now... what did Schrodtrom just say? "Destroy the world"!?

"What?! Nonsense! What purpose does that serve?!"

Olug involuntarily activated amplification magic and shouted loudly, trying to reach Schrodtrom.

"Oh, my, isn't this His Highness August? What a pleasant surprise."

"We don't have time to indulge in such nonsense! What did you just say?! You're not talking about 'conquering' the world, but 'destroying' it!? What is the purpose of such an act!?"

Frustrated by Schrodtrom's flippant greeting and wanting to find out the true meaning of his previous statement, Olug spoke. After all, wasn't the massive production of monsters and the creation of allies supposed to be for the purpose of "conquering" the world? It seemed much more natural to think that he was trying to conquer the world to create a place for those allies he had multiplied. However, Schrodtrom had declared, of all things, that he wanted to "destroy" this world. What on earth was he thinking? Did he hold such a grudge against us humans?

Unable to fathom Schrodtrom's true intentions, Olug was left momentarily bewildered when Schrodtrom responded in a surprisingly straightforward manner.

"It won't amount to anything."

"What...? I don't understand..."

Because he asserted it so matter-of-factly, Olug was momentarily dumbfounded. Without paying any attention to Olug's bewilderment, Schrodtrom continued his explanation.

"I don't really have any desire to destroy the world. It's just that..."

"Wha...? I don't understand..."

"It doesn't have any meaning, you see... There's no meaning in this world continuing to exist."

"W-What are you saying!?"

It's becoming more and more incomprehensible. Destroy without meaning?

What's up with that? It's like some kind of Zen riddle!

Furthermore, what do you mean there's no meaning in the world continuing to exist?

"Well then. How you interpret my words is entirely up to you. I've simply resolved to destroy the world. That's all you need to understand, isn't it?"

It's an incredibly selfish statement. He wants to destroy the world just because he wants to. The reasons are nonsensical. Everyone listening to this is more confused than scared. However, Schrodtrom continues talking without the slightest regard for our confusion.

"Now, I've decided to destroy the world, but going to attack each country like this would be rather uninteresting."

"U-Uninteresting... you say!?"

Is he deciding on actions to destroy the world based on whether they're interesting or not? As expected, demons are insane!

"So, I'm giving you one month."

"Huh?"

"I'll give you a month's reprieve. Use that time to bolster your forces, and one month from now, let's decide the victor within the enclosure you, Mr. Wolford, have created."

As we seethe over the abnormality of Schrodtrom, the demon makes such a proposal. With a casual attitude, it's almost as if...

"...It's like we're playing a game, isn't it?"

What Olug says likely mirrors everyone's feelings. Schrodtrom's words sounded as if they were suggesting we all play a game.

"Exactly. It is a game."

"What?!"

"Fufufu, please enjoy it to the fullest. I'm getting rather bored with the current state of affairs. So, one month from now, I look forward to it."

"H-Hey! Do you really think we'll agree to something like this!?"

"If it's not accepted... well, then, I suppose I'll have to systematically annihilate each country in order, hmm?"

"Y-You!"

He declared that he would invade each country if we didn't participate in his game.

This leaves us with no choice.

One month later, it was decided that we would be forcibly participating in a game to determine the victor within the enclosure teeming with disaster-class monsters.

"Well then, everyone, farewell."

"Wait! Schrodtrom!! We're not done talking yet! Hey!"

After his parting words, Schrodtrom didn't respond to Olug's inquiry. Honestly, this is the worst possible outcome. I had hoped to build a relationship with the demons that wouldn't involve siding with them, even if it didn't mean coexistence. However, the one-sided declaration of war from the demon side escalated to a full-scale war. Oug seemed to be disappointed that he couldn't avoid this situation as he wore a stern expression and looked up at the sky.

"Oug... for now, let's return to the capital. We need to report this..."

"Yeah... and we need to report to the other countries as well..."

Oug, who wanted to avoid this situation, couldn't hide his disappointment at his miscalculation. Nevertheless, at this moment, commanders from various countries had gathered, and they had all witnessed the developments that had just occurred. Concealing the situation was impossible.

"We need a leadership meeting urgently. And we have to prepare for what's to come in one month."

Oug, who had been feeling down until recently, quickly regrouped and communicated with the commanders of various countries about what to do next. Not only the commanders but also the soldiers from various countries wore shocked and despairing expressions. Just when they had almost thought they could restore peace to the world, the situation suddenly turned into a crisis of annihilation.

This wasn't what they had expected.

The enemy was disaster-class monsters and even stronger demons. No matter how much the Ultimate Magicians had transcended human limitations, they were only twelve in number. When facing a significant number of disaster-class monsters and demons who had previously given the Ultimate Magicians a hard time... they couldn't help but feel despair about the future of humanity.

What should we do...?

"But... why did they suddenly propose something like this?"

As they pondered the future, Sicily, seemingly concerned about the fundamental issue, voiced her question.

"Even when we were fighting the demons who broke away from us, they never interfered at all... so why this sudden..."

Sicily was so surprised by the sudden turn of events that she couldn't help but voice her thoughts.

If they had intended to destroy the world from the beginning, there would have been no reason for those demons who initially wanted to conquer the world to separate from us, and they wouldn't have left us alone.

So, why the sudden change?

"...I can't really fathom the thoughts of someone who has abandoned their humanity."

After a moment of contemplation, Oug slowly began to speak.

"Perhaps it was an event that made them despair of the world."

"Captain Zest."

After Strom declared war on humanity, one of the demons who had been listening to this approached Zest, the former captain of the intelligence unit.

"What is it?"

"Well, you know, we were made into demons by Lord Strom, more or less pawns at his disposal. So we'll follow his decision. But..."

"Why did he suddenly say something like that?"

"Yes."

It seemed that Strom's declaration had been unexpected not only for close aides like Zest but for other demons as well. They couldn't understand the true intent behind it. So, they decided to ask Zest.

After pondering for a while, Zest let out a small sigh and answered the demon.

"Do you know that Lord Strom was conducting a certain experiment?"

"An experiment...? You mean the one where animals were turned into monsters and even forcibly made to become disaster-class creatures?"

"That's one of the experiments, but it's not the one. It's related to an experiment that will affect our future."

For that demon, Zest's words were a revelation. They knew that Strom had been conducting experiments to forcibly turn living creatures into monsters, starting from the time he was hiding in Arlsheid. They were aware that these experiments had evolved to forcibly turn them into disaster-class monsters. However, this experiment seemed to be different from those – an experiment with no apparent purpose, almost like one of Strom's hobbies.

They had no idea that there might be other experiments going on behind the scenes.

"So, what's the point of this experiment?"

"Oh, the results of that experiment..."

Zest mentioned this much, recalling what Strom had told him a few days ago.

Milia had proposed an experiment, which was then carried out. Finally, the results of that experiment had been obtained, and Zest heard about it from Strom.

Zest, who knew the contents of the experiment, understood that the future of the demons was at stake based on the success or failure of this experiment.

So, with a tense expression, he waited for Strom's words.

"The experiment..."

Finally, Strom spoke, revealing the results.

"It's a failure."

Hearing Strom's words, Zest was left dumbfounded.

After a brief moment of shock, Zest understood the meaning behind Strom's words and couldn't help but shout.

"So then, what awaits our future, the demons?"

"Despair. There's nothing else."

"Th-that's..."

The experiment, which had determined the future of the demons, ended in failure. Based on this result, Strom concluded that there was nothing but despair in the demons' future.

This statement didn't just apply to the demons' future; it also filled Zest with despair. Strom continued speaking without showing any sign of offering comforting words to Zest.

"If this experiment is a failure, what's the purpose of our existence in this world?"

"Why... What do you mean?"

Zest didn't understand the meaning behind Strom's question.

As he pondered the question, Strom continued.

"For this world, we are nothing but a menace."

"What?! No way!"

Zest wanted to deny that idea. He didn't want to accept the notion that their existence was a menace. However, the results of this experiment seemed to confirm Strom's statement.

Zest, who couldn't completely deny the term "menace to the world," listened as Strom continued.

"An existence that serves no purpose in a world where we are considered a menace... Is that necessary?"

After hearing these words, Zest understood. Strom intended to destroy the world. He had apparently concluded that there was no meaning in their existence in a world that wouldn't tolerate them.

If that were the case, what would Strom's next move be?

"Conquest of the world... or rather, its annihilation?"

"Hehe, Zest, you truly are perceptive. I like that."

While observing Strom's cheerful response, Zest swallowed the additional question he had in mind.

It was:

"Or perhaps... are you wishing for your own destruction?"
