"Wow, do they start magic classes with threats at elementary school? I didn't know that!"

This was said by Mei-chan, who was in her third year at the Ultimate Magicians.

Mei-chan had already turned twenty. After graduating at the top of her class from the Advanced Magic Academy, she joined the Ultimate Magicians. Of course, she didn't get in through connections or favors; she passed the entrance exam on her own.

Her test results were outstanding, earning her the top spot, so there was no jealousy from her fellow newcomers. However, some people in the public eye suspected she got in through connections, as she was a princess, her brother was the crown prince, and he was the vice captain of the Ultimate Magicians. Though most of them had never seen Mei-chan's abilities up close.

At this point, Mei-chan possessed significant power among the Ultimate Magicians. While her attack magic might not be on par with Aug, it was close, and she could also enchant magical tools due to receiving guidance from Yuri in the past. She had a strong bond with Sicily, from whom she learned healing magic, and though not as proficient as Sicily, she could also use healing magic.

While she might not match experts in each field, she could skillfully wield magic at a high level. The only thing she couldn't use was a sword, but that was simply because Mei-chan never showed any interest in learning it. If she had learned, she might have mastered it at a high level.

Thanks to Mei-chan's talents, there was a growing perception within the Ultimate Magicians that if you asked her for help, even the most challenging tasks would be manageable.

Mei-chan, overflowing with talent, had a daily routine of chatting with me when she arrived at the office in the morning. During one of these chats, she mentioned her recent experience with the first magic practice at the elementary school, which elicited the previous reaction.

"Come to think of it, Mei-chan, did you have magic classes starting from middle school?"

"Yes, we did. So I was curious about what kind of classes they have at the elementary school."

Mei-chan started learning magic during the summer when she was ten, and the catalyst for it was when she came along on our training camp.

"Oh my, you shouldn't say that in a place like this!"

"Hehe, then, after work, perhaps?"

"Ahh..."

"Hey, you two... could you please refrain from flirting at work?"

The person who approached us was Eclair-kun, one of the new recruits in the Ultimate Magicians, and he joined at the same time as Mei-chan. His full name is Eclair Von Swiede.

As you might guess from his name, he's a prince from the Swiede Kingdom, specifically the third prince in line for the throne. Back in middle school, he displayed remarkable talent in magic practice, which marked him as a promising future magician. However, at the time, Swiede lagged behind in magical technology compared to Arlsheid, a nation that was always at the forefront of magical advancements.

Due to these circumstances, the Swiede royal family decided to send him to study abroad in Arlsheid, a country known for its cutting-edge magical technology. This led to Eclair transferring to Arlsheid Middle School in his second year, the same school Mei-chan attended.

Being the same age as Mei-chan and hailing from a neighboring kingdom's royal family, he ended up spending a lot of time with her. Despite receiving guidance from us even before entering middle school, Mei-chan's magical prowess had grown to the point where it easily surpassed Eclair, a royal of the Swiede Kingdom.

Both were from the same royal background, but Mei-chan had more formidable magical skills. Currently, Eclair was head over heels for Mei-chan. Through his homeland, he proposed an engagement with Mei-chan to the Arlsheid royal family.

However, Arlsheid was a country that strongly encouraged love marriages, even among the royal family. While political marriages did occur, such an arrangement with Swiede didn't hold much significance for Arlsheid, a world-leading superpower. Consequently, they rejected the proposal between two royal families.

However, they responded that they would approve of it if Eclair, as an individual, managed to court and date Mei-chan, leading to marriage. Eclair had originally fallen for Mei-chan and proposed a political marriage, but now he began his personal approach to win her over.

At every opportunity, Eclair-kun would praise Mei-chan, saying "beautiful," "wonderful," and "amazing." Mei-chan, however, seemed to dismiss it as flattery directed at royalty from the country he was studying in, and it had no effect on her.

For Mei-chan, magic was more important than romantic matters. After graduating from the Advanced Magic Academy, her goal was to join the Ultimate Magicians, and she diligently trained for that purpose, more devoted than anyone else.

Eclair, whose previous approaches had all failed, decided to change his strategy. He thought that if he could earn recognition in the field of magic that Mei-chan was most passionate about, she might start noticing him. So he began to devote himself to magical training, which was actually the main reason for his presence in Arlsheid. When I once pointed this out, he blushed and said, "You're absolutely right, but I was so desperate back then."

And so, Eclair worked diligently on his magic training. Naturally, Mei-chan trained alongside him. During their joint training, their relationship evolved from treating Eclair as a foreign royal to considering him a friend. Furthermore, they passed the entrance exams to Arlsheid Advanced Magic Academy, just like their friends Agnes and Colin, who had been friends with Mei-chan since elementary school.

Their bond grew stronger as they engaged in monster hunting for the Hunter Association after becoming students at the Advanced Magic Academy. Mei-chan started to become more aware of Eclair.

You really worked hard, Eclair...

Despite developing this awareness, Mei-chan's relationship with Eclair remained unchanged for a while. However, as they approached graduation from the academy, Mei-chan started to wonder about Eclair's future plans.

Eclair, being a member of the Swiede royal family, was expected to return to his homeland after graduating from the academy. Upon hearing this, Mei-chan was greatly disturbed and became aware of her own feelings. It was rather late in the game.

As a result, Mei-chan confessed her feelings to Eclair, who happily accepted her confession. Following this sequence of events, they became a couple and engaged to be married.

When I first heard about it, I thought, "How sweet and youthful." By the way, Eclair's reason for being a member of the Ultimate Magicians was partly because he could boast about producing Ultimate Magicians from the Swiede royal family if he joined us, and also because it meant he didn't have to return to his home country.

With a refreshed expression, Eclair-kun mentioned this during an interview.

Well, since he had trained alongside Mei-chan and performed well in the practical exam, he passed as the second best after Mei-chan and now works together with her as a team.

However, they had only been in a relationship for a little over two years, so they often indulged in public displays of affection like this.

"Come on, can't you two separate work from your private life a bit more?"

"Even if you say that, it's not very convincing, you know."

When I attempted to give a lecture to the young couple, Maria interrupted.

"What are you saying? You, the guy who used to be all over Sicily all the time, are saying that? You're the last person in the world who should say those words."

"...Guh."

A low groan escaped.

"That's right! Big brother Shin, you were always all over big sister Sicily!"

"Is that so? I would have loved to see the passionate love of Lord Shin and Lady Sicily, who are known as the epitome of a close couple."

"Enough of that. You two were practically all over each other 24/7. There have been countless times when I felt embarrassed watching you."

"Hey, it wasn't that bad!"

"It was that bad! I've even thought about shooting magic at you two while you were flirting!"

Maria was genuinely furious.

Certainly, I had some self-awareness that I used to be all over Sicily when I was younger. However, now that I'm in a position to lead these young people, it's also my responsibility to teach and guide them.

"So, since my words don't carry much weight, let me say it on Maria's behalf. Mei-sama, Eclair-sama, this is a workplace. Please save the affection for after work."

"Yes, understood."

"I'm sorry, Maria-senpai. We'll be more careful from now on."

"As long as you understand, it's fine."

Well, that's what I wanted to do.

"When it comes from big sister Maria, it's convincing."

"That's true. Even though her husband, Cartus, is in the office, I've never seen them being affectionate. When senior Maria, who clearly separates her work and personal life, says it, I have no choice but to agree."

Is this what they call persuasion...?

Certainly, Maria and Cartus are a married couple, but I've never seen them engage in any public displays of affection at the office.

Maria, who is respected by the two royals, gave me a smug look.

Damn it... it's frustrating, but there's nothing I can say.

I never expected my past actions to come back to haunt me like this!

Frustrated by my own inadequacy, I grit my teeth. Eclair-kun then spoke to Mei-chan, saying, "By the way."

"Yesterday, we received letters from Colin and Miss Donnelly. Did they arrive at your place too?"

Colin is the son of Tom, the head of the Hague Trading Company, who had been taking care of me since I was a child, and Miss Donnelly is Agnes, who has been close friends with Mei-chan since childhood.

"They did, they did!! I was so happy that I jumped for joy!"

"Eh? In letters from Colin and Agnes? What did they write?"

Maria knows about Mei-chan's friends because they also attended the High Magic Academy. She's curious about the contents of the letter that made Mei-chan jump for joy.

Mei-chan, with a beaming smile, answered Maria's question.

"Agnes and Colin are getting married!! And I got an invitation to their wedding!"

"Eh, really!?"

"Huh? It didn't come to big brother Shin's place?"

"Yesterday, right? I didn't hear about it."

Even though we have butlers and maids in our house, despite being commoners, managing letters that arrive at our home is one of the butler's responsibilities. But there was no such report yesterday.

Huh... I thought we were getting along quite well. Was I being self-absorbed?

"Hmm, that's strange. I'll ask about it."

Mei-chan said that and started making a communication call with a wireless device.

No... it's almost time for work...

I was thinking that, but it seems she got through to someone, and they started talking.

"Oh, Agnes? It's Mei. Are you okay now?"

The person she was communicating with was Agnes.

"Oh, you have work right now? Well then, I'll talk to you later... Huh? You're okay?"

It seems she was about to start work, but a call from Princess Mei takes priority. Their conversation continued.

"Yesterday, I received a letter. Congratulations! I believed that this day would come ever since our elementary school days!"

Come to think of it, Agnes's feelings for Colin-kun were quite obvious back in our elementary school days.

Despite everyone around her noticing, Colin-kun was the only one who remained oblivious.

"I'll definitely attend the wedding! Oh, and by the way, did you receive an invitation at Shin's place?"

Bringing up the main topic, Mei-chan subsequently said, "Yes, yes," "I see, indeed," and "Okay, I'll ask."

"Shin Onii-chan, Agnes asked if it would be disrespectful to send you an invitation to the wedding. What do you think?"

"Of course not! I've been taking care of these kids since they were little, so it's only natural to celebrate Colin-kun's wedding!"

"That's what I said. So, it's fine to send you an invitation."

Saying this, Mei-chan ended the communication.

"Actually, Agnes-san mentioned that she was hesitant to invite Shin Onii-chan to a wedding like theirs."

"No, no, no. Even before anything else, Tom-san, Colin-kun's father, has been taking care of me since I was a child, so it's only natural to celebrate Colin-kun's wedding!"

"Oh, right."

Well, even if we hadn't received invitations from Colin-kun and the others, Tom-san might have sent one, but I wanted it to be from the individuals themselves.

Anyway, we'll be able to attend Colin-kun and the others' wedding.

However, not only among our group but also among the juniors we've been taking care of, they are getting married...

"By the way, Mei-chan and Eclair-kun, when are you two getting married?"

"Eh!? Umm..."

"We have a little more time. It's a marriage between royals, after all. We will most likely have to renounce our titles of nobility, and we're still in discussions about which country's ducal title we will be granted."

This is the reason why Mei-chan, a 20-year-old princess, hasn't gotten married yet.

Marriage between royals seems quite complicated.

Well, it seems these two are deeply in love with each other, so they should be fine regardless of which country they choose.

"I see. In that case, let's conclude this discussion here. Should we get to work right away?"

"Understood!"

"Got it."

"Sure."

After receiving the request form from Katarina-san, they headed off to work.

Once they saw them off, Shin deeply sat in his chair and let out a sigh.

I see, those kids...

Before he knew it, so much time had passed.

At home, his older children had also started learning magic, and the next generation was steadily growing.

It was an event that made him realize this. itinerary
