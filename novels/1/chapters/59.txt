This is the worst-case scenario.

The nickname that the Demon Lord, who had been trying to avoid at all costs, was given by Uncle Dis during the commendation ceremony of all times. If you make a declaration in such a public place, it would spread throughout the capital in no time.

As I walked through the city...

"Ah! Lord Demon King!"

"Eek! It's Lord Demon King Shin!"

"The King of Wizards... it really suits you."

Whenever they call me, they add "Demon King" to it.

"I can't walk outside anymore..."

"Don't worry about it. It's only embarrassing because you're not used to it. You'll get used to it."

"I don't want to get used to it..."

"But you've already gotten used to the team name, haven't you? You'll get used to the nickname too."

Sitting next to me, Cecily said this with a smile.

Cecily, who always cares about me, is such a good girl...

"You're doing well, Cecily. You've completely tamed Shin, haven't you?"

While soaking in Cecily's kindness, Grandma said with a grin.

"Huh? I-I didn't mean to do that..."

"Never mind that. Just keep taming him. If you do that, your relationship as a married couple will go well."

"Yes! Oh, no, Shin, I don't mean to tame you or anything..."

"Oh? Can't you listen to your grandma's advice?"

"No, it's not like that..."

"Don't worry, Grandma is just teasing you."

Saying this, I pat her head.

"I see... that's a relief."

"Hahaha, it's all so innocent."

"Indeed, but with all this commotion, we can't go out together."

As Grandpa said, after the commendation ceremony, the members of the team couldn't go out as freely as before.

It seems that if they walk around the city unprotected, they get surrounded.

"It would be a good idea to teach the Gate magic early."

"That's true... Maria said the other day that she was fed up with all the guys approaching her now that her name is famous."

"No one good comes to a person only after their name becomes famous... It seems like she's blowing them all away without mercy."

"That seems to be the case. I... am fine when I go outside because I'm with Shin-kun."

Cecily said this a little shyly.

However, when she said she was fine, it meant that she no longer went out alone.

In fact, she couldn't go out alone anymore. Whenever she went outside, she was always with me, Grandpa, or Grandma.

This was because Cecily's reputation in the Kingdom of Swied had reached the Kingdom of Arlsheid, and many people began to revere her as a saint and seek her salvation. If she walked alone in the city, she would be surrounded, and not only that, there were some people with questionable intentions. This meant that we had to protect her in a different sense than before.

However, I couldn't imagine anyone being able to harm Cecily in her current state.

According to Orth, the investigator from the security team who visited us before, there were people who wanted to manipulate us into committing crimes. They were busy investigating and apprehending these individuals.

"They genuinely believe they can manipulate you guys, who can easily defeat demons, into doing their bidding... They're hopeless."

Orth warned us to be cautious and then left.

As a result, learning Gate magic became even more necessary.

"Even so... the expectations of the people toward Shin-kun have become stronger."

"I knew it would turn out this way."

All the members of the team had the power to defeat demons, and I had even received the title of "Wizard King." As a result, there was a strong belief that "demons are nothing to be feared."

When I asked Uncle Dis, who visited us recently, about this, he said something unexpected.

"It's fine that way. I've given instructions to the military from officers to soldiers. Only you guys, Shin-kun, can defeat demons."

"Do you really agree with that?"

"When I explained that defeating demons requires the ability to defeat disaster-level monsters individually... they all quickly understood."

Come to think of it, Mei-chan said that disaster-level monsters were trauma generators for the military... While they may not be able to imagine the strength of demons, they understood the fear of disaster-level monsters.

"But what about the Three Kingdoms Conference? Could that have an impact?"

"You don't need to worry about negotiations with the country. I want the people to think that demons are not to be feared, even though negotiations may become difficult. I don't want the country's atmosphere to worsen due to any unnecessary sense of crisis."

"Is this about manipulating information?"

"You know some tough words, huh? That's what I mean."

I understood what Uncle Dis was saying. But I was still worried about whether this would affect the Three Kingdoms Conference.

"Negotiations with the country fall within my purview. You don't need to worry about it."

"..."

Wow, he really said it.

"What's wrong?"

"N-nothing..."

"...I'll ask you about it later, but leave the negotiations with the two countries to me. I've already run several simulations."

"Is that so?"

What is he planning to do? Well, he'll probably conduct thorough information gathering, considering that it's a major country.

Upon the advice of Oug and Uncle Dis, I decided not to worry further, as it was no longer in my domain.

"By the way... what was that earlier?"

"I told you, it's nothing."

"Spill it!"

"It really was nothing!"

"After that, I was interrogated by Oug... It was so troublesome."

"Haha, but your lines were exactly as Shin-kun expected. I almost burst out laughing."

"If Ellie finds out, it'll be troublesome again..."

"..."

"Could it be... she already knows?"

"U-um... well..."

"Hey!"

"Ehe?"

"You're cute, but not 'ehe!' What are you doing here?"

"Kyaa! I'm sorry... Ah, it tickles!"

"Stop that! Don't play around here. It'll get dusty."

"Oh, sorry."

"Hau... sigh... I'm sorry."

"Hoho, they seem to get along well."

I had forgotten that Grandpa and Grandma were there.

By the way, Cecily had been visiting us without any specific reason since returning from the Rittenheim Resort. She would chat with Grandpa and Grandma like this, and get along with the staff, even when she didn't have any official business. It was like an extension of her vacation before she officially became a part of the Walford family.

Of course, she would return home at night. Grandma kept an eye on her...

A few days after the commendation ceremony, I went to pick up everyone, who could no longer casually go outside, and we gathered in the academy's research room.

"It feels like it's been a really long time..."

"I think so too. We've been having intense days since the summer break started..."

"Well then, I'd like to teach you the Gate magic right away. Is that okay?"

"Anytime you're ready."

Lynn, who had been looking forward to this day, responded with impatience.

"Alright, everyone, please have a seat, and I'll explain Gate magic."

Saying that, everyone obediently took their seats.

"You've seen Gate magic many times, so you should know what it's like, right?"

Everyone nodded in agreement.

"Now, I'm going to teach you the imagery needed to activate the Gate. However, this is based on my own imagery, and it might not be the same for everyone. You'll need to adjust it individually."

After this introduction, I drew points A and B on the blackboard.

"Now, first, a question. How would you get from point A to point B in the shortest distance?"

"That's easy! You just need to go in a straight line from here to here, right?"

"Bzzt."

"Huh? Why not?"

As I told Alice that her answer was incorrect, a commotion broke out.

"What's going on? Is there another shortest distance other than a straight line?"

"What's this? A riddle?"

"Well... I have absolutely no idea."

Everyone quickly gave up.

"Well... it's a bit difficult to arrive at the answer using the blackboard, isn't it?"

"Using the blackboard?"

"Yeah, why don't you try writing it on paper?"

I suggested, and everyone started writing two points on their papers and pondering.

"Ugh! I give up! I don't understand!"

"What about the rest of you? Surrender?"

"Yeah, I have no idea."

"Well then, here's the answer. But don't call it cheating, okay? This is the imagery for the Gate."

My words made everyone's eyes focus.

"The reason I said it's difficult to arrive at the answer on the blackboard is... this."

I took a piece of paper and folded it. Then, points A and B came together.

"When you fold this paper, like this, and consider these points as your current location and your destination, the distance becomes zero. In other words, this is the shortest distance, and..."

I pierced the overlapping points with a pen.

"This hole is the Gate."

As I said this, some of them were dumbfounded, some seemed to understand, and there were various reactions.

"A change in perspective... I never thought of it at all."

"Indeed, it's the shortest distance... Just as you said, it's not easy to arrive at this answer on the blackboard."

"I understand. I get it."

"Did you understand the imagery?"

Everyone nodded emphatically.

"Now, based on this imagery, when you activate the magic by making a hole between two points using spatial storage, like this..."

A Gate appeared in front of me and connected to the back of the research room.

"This is the imagery for the Gate and how to activate it. You can only connect to places you've been to, as you need to have an image of the destination. So, how about it? Can you do it?"

"I can do it. I'll definitely do it."

"I understand the imagery. It's a matter of whether I can activate it."

"Alright, today, we'll practice the Gate together. Well, it took Grandpa quite a while to master it, so don't worry if you can't do it."

No one seemed to have heard the part about Grandpa.

As soon as I mentioned practice, they began gathering mana.

They were even ignoring my analogy... Even though they were heroes...

Well, I suppose there was no ill intent. Everyone wanted to try the Gate as soon as possible. Each of them gathered mana and tried to activate the magic using spatial storage.

Since I had just conveyed the imagery for the first time, everyone ended up opening spatial storage instead of the Gate.

They had to redo it each time, opening spatial storage again and trying over and over, losing track of time as they immersed themselves in Gate practice.

During that time, I was left with nothing to do...

In the end, no one succeeded that day, and the research club was adjourned.

"Ugh... I felt like I was about to grasp something a little more."

Lynn seemed to have made significant progress.

At this rate, Lynn might be the first to learn the Gate.

And so, about three days passed since they began practicing the Gate during the summer break research club activities...

"I did it! I succeeded!"

"What...!"

Surprisingly, Alice was the first to learn the Gate.

"Yes! I did it! Now I won't be late!"

Her motivation was impure!

Leaving that aside, a Gate had opened in front of Alice, connecting to the edge of the research room.

"Yeah, there's no doubt that the Gate has opened. Congratulations, Alice."

"Hehehe, I did it!"

"But how...?"

"Umm, well, you twist the space like this, and then you go 'Hyah!' like that, and you go 'Boom!' to expand it!"

...I have no idea what she's talking about.

Well... if the Gate opened with that imagery, let's consider it a success.

After seeing Alice's success, everyone was even more determined to succeed next.

I was still free, so I was brainstorming an idea for a certain magical device.

"Shin, what are you doing?"

"Hmm? Oh, I'm brainstorming an idea for a magical device."

"A magical device?"

"Yeah, you know there's a communication device, right?"

"Yeah."

"I'm thinking about creating a wireless version of that..."

"Hold on a second."

I was interrupted by Ogre, who should have been practicing the Gate.

"What's wrong? Did you succeed?"

"That doesn't matter. You just said something unbelievable again."

"Unbelievable? You mean the wireless communication device?"

"Yes!"

At his shout, everyone stopped their practice and looked our way.

"But it's just... unbelievable?"

"Even with that communication device, it brought a revolution to information technology. Now, you want to make it wireless? Are you planning to start an information war?"

Information war... I had heard that term in my previous life, but did this world not have it yet?

"Well, it might be a bit too early..."

"Even with wired communication devices, they are currently only used for communication between nations. Eventually, they will become more widespread, but it's still too early for now."

"I see... Well, I'm just brainstorming, and there's no prospect of realization yet."

"Is that so..."

Ogre let out a relieved sigh, as if realizing that it wasn't going to be implemented right away.

To release it, there needs to be a gradual process.

"Don't startle us like that. Let's get back to our practice."

Saying that, he went back to practicing the Gate.

The prospect of realization... honestly, that's the biggest problem.

The reason the wireless communication device hasn't been realized with just an idea is because the receiving end must also be activated for communication to occur.

For wired communication devices, when the sending side activates the device, magical threads that have materialized into monstrous spider silk transmit the signal to the receiving end's device, which then activates.

Therefore, communication can take place. But if it's made wireless, even if the sending side activates the device, the receiving side won't activate. That's only natural.

To achieve this, the receiving side would need to activate the device at all times.

For the sake of receiving communication that might come at any time?

That's not practical at all. It's a major reason why this idea has reached a deadlock.

There are other aspects to consider. We haven't decided on the communication mode, whether it should directly exchange magical waves, or use relay stations.

However, to begin with, we might use the direct type, since setting up relay stations would require large-scale infrastructure.

If we go with direct magical wave communication, we'll need to experiment with the maximum effective distance.

In the long run, we might want to set up relay stations, but it's uncertain when that will happen.

Regardless of the communication mode, the main issue is how to activate the receiving end.

Is there something... a hint that might help?

I've thought about many things, but I've reached a complete dead end due to my lack of understanding of this world's common knowledge.

Everyone who knows this world well might have some ideas...

Ogre told me it's too early, but having it would be a significant advantage when invading the former imperial territory. I can't afford to halt its development.

While everyone was practicing the Gate, I continued to research and think about this.

Then, a few more days passed...

"I did it! I made it!"

Lynn, quite unusually, shouted.

Drawn by her voice, I looked at Lynn, and there was a Gate open in front of her.

"I'm so happy! I did it!"

Not only her loud voice but also her beaming smile made me feel a bit relieved about my previous frustration.

Lynn repeatedly opened and closed the Gate.

"Wow! Great job, Lynn!"

"I can't believe I fell behind Alice, but I'm happy."

These two have really become good friends.

They've become a bit cheeky, too...

The others also got motivated by the second person's success and worked hard in their practice.

Then, just before the end of the summer vacation.

"Well, I've finally done it..."

The last remaining person, Olivia, succeeded in opening the Gate. With that, the entire team had mastered the Gate magic.

"Alright! With this... everyone has mastered the Gate!"

"Wow!"

"Alice, you can whistle again."

"Well, this was just in time for the end of the summer vacation."

"I'm sorry... It took me a while..."

"No, it's not a problem. You managed to master it quite early, considering that even the Sage took time to learn this magic."

"Indeed, it was a close call for Thor too."
