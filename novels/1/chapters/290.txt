"Good morning, Allen."

"Ah, good morning, Cresta."

The day after the visit to the Walford family, Cresta greeted Allen in the classroom of their academy.

Their classmates were taken aback by this.

Previously, when Cresta approached Allen, it was always with nervousness, taking a deep breath and mustering the courage before speaking.

But today, they exchanged greetings quite naturally.

Could it be that there was progress in their relationship?

Their classmates didn't say it out loud, but each of them was thinking the same thing.

If this were an academy for commoners, the boys would have teased them mercilessly, but this was an academy where many children of nobility attended.

Finding a future partner was a very important matter, so they wouldn't make fun of something like this.

So, their classmates watched Allen and Cresta with warm and expectant eyes.

However, the two of them themselves had no such thoughts at all.

The reason they could now talk so comfortably was that they had gone through a trial together, which had fostered a strange sense of camaraderie between them.

So, the content of their conversation revolved around that.

"Yesterday was quite something, wasn't it?"

"Yeah... I was so tired. I fell asleep in the carriage on the way back without even realizing it."

"I was exhausted, both physically and mentally."

"They mentioned coming again, didn't they?"

"Yes, they did..."

Saying this, both of them sighed.

Allen had a faint hope that he might meet Shin and Sicily if he visited Sylvester's house.

As for Cresta, her primary wish was simply to play with Allen.

The fact that they were going to the Walford family was where Cresta had her faint hope.

But that was all it was.

And that hope had been fulfilled.

However, the appearance of the princess and the crown princess was unexpected.

Meeting royalty without any prior preparation is something they really wanted to avoid.

At first, the two of them were excited to be in the Walford family and chatted happily with Sylvester. But after the arrival of the princess and the crown princess, they were constantly worried.

It was an honor, but...

Yesterday, as they recalled what had happened after Octavia woke up, Allen and Cresta approached Sylvester with great urgency.

"What do you mean... She seemed disappointed that she couldn't thank you for playing together," they said, hearing these words, both of them breathed a sigh of relief.

"I see..."

"That's a relief..."

"Huh? I don't get what's going on, but Vi-chan said she wants to say thank you again, and she invited you to come over to play."

"!!"

Despite the relief they felt, the single sentence Sylvester uttered next sent shockwaves through Allen and Cresta.

Octavia wanted to thank them, so she invited them to play again.

This meant that they would have to visit the Walford family again, with Octavia certainly being present. Octavia was a three-year-old toddler, and her mother, the Crown Princess, would naturally accompany her.

"So, come over again. This time, I'll show you my room," Sylvester said with a smile. He had originally intended to show them around yesterday, but Shal and the others had interrupted, so he couldn't do it. Sylvester wanted to make up for that, and he was genuinely looking forward to it.

Allen and Cresta, who had never dreamed they would receive an invitation to the Walford family's house so soon, replied with awkward laughter, saying, "Uh, yeah..." and "Haha..."

Sylvester observed the two of them with a puzzled expression.

And among their classmates, there were some who were looking at Sylvester with a stern gaze.
