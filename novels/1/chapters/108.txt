Translation:

In a conference room within the Aarlsheid Royal Castle, the heads of the countries surrounding the Demon Realm, as well as the Pope Ekaterina of the Holy Kingdom of East and President Aaron of the Els Free Trade Union, had gathered.

The atmosphere in that conference room was heavy, and no one seemed willing to open their mouths, except for one.

"So? Disaum, did you call me here today to discuss that matter?"

Under the pressure of Granny, who had attended a meeting of national leaders, the trio of Uncle Dis, Pope Ekaterina, and President Aaron, who were once her disciples, were completely overwhelmed. Seeing the heads of the three major countries succumbing to Granny's pressure, the heads of the surrounding countries were also swept up in this atmosphere.

Both Granny and I had been invited to the recent World Leaders Conference. This was regarding the recent issue of transforming the Knight Order's swords into Vibrationswords. While I was the one who would actually perform the magical enhancement, disregarding Granny's intentions and proceeding could lead to unknown consequences in the future.

So I had called this meeting to gain Granny's consent, but...

"Yes! In this current situation where the world is exposed to the threat of annihilation, I believe that only Shin's Vibrationsword can break through this predicament."

"..."

"Please... could you grant your permission?"

"..."

Even as they listened to Uncle Dis's desperate pleas, Granny remained silent, only glaring. Faced with this silent pressure, Uncle Dis seemed on the verge of giving in, but backing down here wouldn't resolve the crisis in this world. I imagined that he was confronting her with that in mind. Despite usually being completely unyielding to Granny, he was facing her with sweat pouring down, his thoughts on the line.

They remained like that for a while, but eventually, Granny herself spoke up.

"It seems you're not saying this lightly... Shin."

"What?"

"Go ahead and bestow it upon everyone's swords."

"Is it really okay, Granny?"

"Yeah. It's fine."

"Thank you, Merida-sensei."

With Granny's permission finally granted, Uncle Dis let out a long sigh and then expressed his gratitude. Hearing Uncle Dis's words of thanks, you could hear relieved voices from the heads of the different countries. However...

"Don't get too complacent!"

Translation:

Granny scolded the heads of the countries, causing everyone to flinch, and the room was filled with tension once again.

No, it's the heads of countries who are here... What is Granny scolding them for? And why are the kings looking so intimidated?

In a way, it's an unusual sight, but Granny's turn is not over yet.

"From what I've heard, it's true that using these Vibrationswords within each country's knight orders would be the most effective and quickest way to address the current situation. However..."

Here, Granny paused and slowly surveyed everyone before continuing.

"Do you all truly understand how powerful and dangerous this weapon is?"

To the silent heads of the nations, Granny began to explain the danger of Vibrationswords.

"Did you see the effect of this sword earlier? When you use this sword to cut something, you don't need strength. You don't even need skill. Anyone who wields it... can cut through iron as if it's butter."

As she touched the Vibrationsword placed on the desk in front of her as a demonstration, Granny continued speaking.

"This sword, you see, can be used by anyone who holds it. Because it's a magical tool."

The heads of the nations participating in this meeting didn't know about the effectiveness of Vibrationswords, so a demonstration had been done at the beginning of the meeting.

So, everyone was aware of the sharpness of the Vibrationswords.

And how easy they are to handle.

"Moreover, this isn't a legendary sword made of special metals. Any ordinary sword lying around can be transformed into this immensely powerful sword."

And they are inexpensive to produce in large quantities.

"Imagine what would happen if such a weapon were widely available. Can you guess?"

Granny had been deeply concerned about this danger for a long time.

Regarding Vibrationswords, she had repeatedly emphasized that they should only be given to individuals she genuinely trusted.

So far, Vibrationswords had only been given to Tony, one of the Ultimate Magicians, and Miranda, a close friend of Maria's who had actually met us.

Uncle Dis and Zeek, Chris' older sister, are part of the family, after all.

Translation:

In response to Granny's point about the Vibrationswords being powerful magical tools that can be mass-produced inexpensively and used easily, the heads of the nations, who had naively welcomed the idea, hung their heads and fell silent.

No, seriously... Heads of the nations...

"If you take this lightly, you'll inevitably face severe consequences. Please don't forget that."

"Yes!"

Finally, all of them responded.

Well, I think Granny understood that Vibrationswords could become the ultimate weapon against the demons, even if they carried such risks. However, she wanted to make it clear that handling them casually could lead to problems in the future.

I hadn't anticipated that so many Vibrationswords would be mass-produced and handed to others. Therefore, I hadn't thought about the potential dangers at all.

Everyone nodded in agreement with Granny's concerns, and it seemed that the conversation would finally move forward.

However, at that moment...

"But, Archmage, if it's such a dangerous item, why is Mr. Wolfford allowed to use it?"

Someone challenged Granny's decision.

Who would do such a thing when she had just gained Granny's approval?

Oh, that's...

"Oh, he's the new King of Darm, isn't he?"

"Yes, that's right, Archmage."

A recent incident involved an emissary from Darm who attacked Ekaterina. Fortunately, Ekaterina survived, and it was determined that the emissary, who shouldn't have had significant magical power, was almost turned into a demon due to his actions, suggesting he was controlled by a demon.

However, due to a series of incidents that occurred after the recent campaign to defeat the demons, the former King of Darm took responsibility and abdicated the throne, passing it on to his son.

This was the new King of Darm's first time participating in diplomacy as a king, and it was his debut at the previously unheld world summit.

Due to the multiple incidents that occurred consecutively, Darm's reputation had been tarnished globally. Even the fact that this summit, which had previously been held in Darm, was taking place in Arlsheid this time reflected Darm's weakened international standing.

In this context, the new King of Darm probably had a strong desire to restore his country's position, but it seems he picked the wrong target to challenge.

Translation:

"We must not keep it, but it's okay for our grandson, Mr. Wolfford. After all, isn't it typical for heroes to adore their grandchildren?"

What a challenger.

I can't believe someone would speak to Granny like that.

Even if they're heads of the nations!

"Huh? What are you talking about?"

"Y-You..."

"Shin has been strictly disciplined about right and wrong since he was a child. You might say I'm biased toward my grandson, but there's no way he would do anything bad."

"Granny..."

Granny is always strict, but she trusted me this much...

"Well, certainly, he's biased towards his grandson."

Despite the touching moment, the King of Darm persisted.

"Moreover..."

"What is it?"

"The Vibrationsword was developed by Shin himself, you know? What's wrong with owning something you've created?"

"G-Guh..."

Besides, Granny continued, looking at me.

"From his essence, a well-sharpened sword is the same whether he has it or not."

Huh? Just a moment ago, I was touched, but suddenly, I feel like I've been let down...

As the tears that were brought on by the touching moment quickly recede, I start to think, "Is that really how she sees me?" Just then, Mr. Dis starts laughing.

"Haha! Well, it's true, it doesn't matter if Shin has the Vibrationsword or not!"

Granny's impolite remark seemed to have hit Mr. Dis's funny bone.

He couldn't stop laughing.

"W-Why are you laughing so carefreely!? Having this sword or not is the same thing!? Does that mean that Shin=Wolfford over there possesses an extremely dangerous power?"

Well, what the King of Darm is saying makes sense.

But maybe it would have been better not to say it?

By making a statement that views me as a danger, the atmosphere among the three in the room has changed.

"You... Talking like that to the hero of salvation?"

"I see. So Darm is viewing Shin as a threat? Even though Shin has saved us so many times until now."

President Aaron and Mr. Dis are both Granny's former disciples.

Translation:

It seems he doesn't like the idea of them viewing his mentor's grandson as a threat.

He glared at King Darm while addressing him.

King Darm, momentarily taken aback by the intimidating looks from the heads of two major nations, quickly composed himself and responded.

"Well... Well, I'm quite surprised that esteemed figures such as the king of Arlsheid and President Aaron, who are considered great nations, do not perceive the danger this boy poses."

He seemed to be provoking Mr. Dis and President Aaron.

Well, President Aaron might know well enough, but doesn't Mr. Dis believe that due to their long association, I wouldn't do such a thing and doesn't view me as a threat? But speaking to these two in this manner could be seen as picking a fight with the great nations.

Oh, dear. The atmosphere between Mr. Dis and President Aaron has become rather tense.

"I think it might be a good idea to reconsider our relationship with Darm."

"It seems that way."

"What?! What are you saying?"

No, it's not "what are you saying."

From my perspective, they're rather pitiful old men who can't stand up to Granny, but in the eyes of the world, they are the heads of three major nations. If you speak to people like that, it's bound to hurt their feelings.

"You don't understand! This powerful sword possesses overwhelming might! What if that power is directed towards us?"

I've always wondered, why do people in power fear the might of their own allies? It's no small matter if they're portrayed as villains in a hypothetical scenario.

Honestly, just when I was getting irritated by King Darm's argument, someone who, in a way, is probably the most uncontrollable figure for King Darm spoke up.

"Enough."

"Y-Your Holiness Nie..."

Darm shrank back quickly when Ekaterina spoke.

"Shin is the divine envoy recognized by us, Ees. Are you seriously thinking that such an envoy will bring disaster to the world?"

"Well, that is..."

Both Darm and Ees are religious states that devoutly follow the Faith of Creation, and Ekaterina is the pope of Ees, a religious leader. There is a clear hierarchy established between Darm and Ees.

Translation:

Being reprimanded by the heads of the superior nation and the pope of the Faith of Creation, Darm was left with nothing more to say.

Where did that momentum from earlier go? King Darm fell silent.

"Moreover, Shin saved my life. This benefactor of mine, you intend to label him as a villain based on your own assumptions?"

"No, I certainly didn't intend to..."

"And besides,"

Ekaterina, cutting off King Darm's frantic excuses, delivered the final blow.

"The person who stabbed me was from your country, you know?"

"Oh... Th-that is..."

"Even though he was manipulated by a demon, it was the people from your nation who caused it. To use that as an excuse to make Shin a villain... What exactly are you thinking?"

"...W-well, the individual was manipulated by a demon, it's not our fault..."

"Are you seriously saying that? Your country's internal troubles provided an opening for the demons, isn't that the case?"

"Grr..."

He must be at a loss for words. He hung his head, his face beet-red, clenching his teeth.

...Isn't this pushing him a bit too far?

Can a head of state of a country bear such humiliation and stay silent?

As I began to worry about this, a voice of mediation intervened.

"Enough of that."

They probably couldn't stand watching this argument anymore. Granny stepped into this scene of King Darm being verbally demolished.

"Having a one-on-one debate is one thing, but ganging up on one person isn't admirable, is it? It's like bullying."

"No, no! That's not what's happening at all!"

The voices of the three harmonized.

Is Granny that frightening to them?

... She is.

"B-Bullying... am I being bullied...?"

For King Darm, being perceived as the victim of bullying was probably a shock. He had been mumbling to himself since earlier.

Having grown up as the prince of a nation, he probably had never experienced bullying before. That something so unheard of had happened to him now.

Could that be why he's so upset?

If that's the case, King Darm's state might be a bit dangerous...

To be honest, Shin's power is abnormal. If Shin were to get a little ambitious, he could easily conquer the world in no time.

Translation:

"Hey! Whose side are you on, Granny!?"

Worried about King Darm, who seemed a bit dangerous, I was hit by an unexpected betrayal from Granny.

"Listen to the whole story. But that's in case Shin misuses his power. Like I said before, I've disciplined Shin strictly. Now, isn't that showing results?"

Granny addressed King Darm and, as he raised his head, she looked directly into his eyes and continued.

"By offering our knowledge in the face of a crisis for humanity and by standing at the forefront ourselves."

"That... that is..."

"Among those present here, there might be those who are concerned about Shin's power. But won't you trust me? If Shin were to go down the wrong path, Merlin and I would risk our lives to stop him."

"I... I won't do something like that!"

"I know. We trust you. That's why we can say we'd risk our lives so easily."

"Granny..."

Uh oh... I'm on the verge of tears...

"How about it? Will you trust me?"

Leaving me on the verge of tears, Granny addressed King Darm once more.

King Darm stared at Granny for a while and then...

"...Hmph."

...he turned away.

Honestly, what's with that attitude, I thought, but Granny seemed to consider that he had backed down with that.

"Well, that's enough from you all. Let's proceed with the discussion."

"Yes, yes!"

As obedient as ever to Granny, the three of them.

Thanks to these three being so obedient to Granny, the subsequent meeting proceeded smoothly.

Using the Vibration Sword doesn't require any special technique.

However, there are some important points to keep in mind.

These details were explained by the three of us who are the actual users: me, Tony, and Miranda.

Tony was there at the moment when it was decided to use the Vibration Sword in the upcoming battle, so he already knew. But I hadn't told Miranda yet. I need to inform her later.

The meeting went smoothly, but something caught my attention during it.

While King Darm seemed to have backed down, he started giving brief responses like "I see" and "Understood" in the middle of the meeting.

Translation:

This... I guess he's still not completely satisfied deep down.

Leaving behind that slight unease, the meeting of the top leaders for the upcoming battle with the demons, scheduled for one month later, came to an end.

By the way...

Gramps, being ineffective when it comes to magical tools, stayed home and looked after things.

Shin used the gate to send the national leaders who had just finished the meeting back to their respective countries.

Among them was the new King of Darm.

When King Darm returned to the Darm Kingdom and entered his room, he kicked a nearby stool.

"Damn it! Are they saying I was bullied?! An ordinary commoner like Merlin dares to get carried away with a title like 'Mage'!!"

Merlin, revered as a hero and admired as a mage, but with a commoner's background, had bested, shielded, and advised the king, who had enjoyed royal privileges until now. For King Darm, this was an unparalleled humiliation.

Nevertheless, what allowed him to control himself during the meeting was the humility that Merlin, a hero from old times, showed to the High Priest, Ekaterina, of the Creationist Faith.

It's a well-known story that when Ekaterina was a young priestess, she studied under Merlin, who was already a hero at that time. That journey also included Aaron, who would later become the President of Els, and D'Sayim, who was already the Crown Prince of Arzheid at the time.

"Do you intend to tame the leaders of the three great nations and rule the world?! That damn vixen!!"

Merlin, who had acted as though he were the greatest in a gathering of leaders from seven nations, was particularly irksome to King Darm.

As he vented his frustration in his room and breathed heavily, the door was suddenly knocked on.

"Who is it!?"

"It's me, Kartun."

"...Come in."

For a moment, King Darm frowned, but he quickly composed himself and granted permission for the visitor to enter.

"Excuse me... Wow! What's this?"

"Be quiet... So? What do you want?"

"Huh? Ah, yes. As the head of the military, I thought it was necessary for me to be one of the first to know the results of the meeting."

While wearing a faint smile and a nonchalant demeanor, the man who entered the room answered King Darm in this way.

King Darm furrowed his brows at the king's attitude, which didn't seem befitting of a ruler.

Translation:

However, King Darm did not mention anything about this attitude.

The man who entered the room, named Hiiro Kartuun, was originally a swordsman belonging to the Darm Knight Order. However, he suddenly awakened magical talent within the past six months.

Kartuun, whose sword skills were nothing special, rapidly rose to become the top combatant in the Darm military due to the addition of magical powers. For Darm, which had experienced significant military decline due to its top forces running amok during the previous operation against the demon territory, this should have been a welcome development.

But this man named Hiiro Kartuun didn't have a particularly good reputation.

His reputation was that he had an inflated sense of self-importance.

His reputation was that he occasionally said or did things that were outlandish.

His reputation was that he was excessively hostile towards Shin.

In a nation's strongest military organization, it is necessary to select individuals who not only possess the appropriate skills but also emphasize good character when appointing leaders.

However, at present in Darm, there is no one with greater competence than Kartuun. Although there may be some character issues, given the substantial difference in capabilities between Kartuun and others, King Darm reluctantly appointed him as the Commander-in-Chief of the military.

"So, Your Majesty. What was the outcome in the end?"

"Ah, well..."

Regardless of personal preferences, he appointed the military head himself, so he couldn't avoid conveying the results of the meeting.

King Darm informed Kartuun about the decisions made during the meeting.

"I see... so, there's such an incredible weapon..."

"Yes. But we don't acknowledge its continued possession except for my grandson. Moreover, even the Pope has sided with us..."

Perhaps remembering the events of the meeting, King Darm's expression turned sour once again.

"Well, well, we can discuss that in detail later. But more importantly..."

Kartuun withdrew the cheerful smile he had on a moment ago and muttered.

"After the Jet Boots, now it's an incredible weapon..."

He uttered this, then clicked his tongue.

"I really want to see this amazing cheat weapon soon..."

King Darm, who was irritated, recalling the events of the meeting, paid no special attention when Kartuun muttered incomprehensible words again.
