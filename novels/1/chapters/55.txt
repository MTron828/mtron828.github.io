Leaving behind the trouble-stricken Kingdom of Caranan at the very end, they headed to the Kingdom of Kurt, which was the final destination of their tour of various nations.

"By the way, what kind of country is the Kingdom of Kurt that we're going to last?"

It was a while after leaving the capital of the Kingdom of Caranan and switching to aerial transportation when they remembered they hadn't asked about their final destination.

"The Kingdom of Kurt is a major grain producer, especially wheat."

"It seems like their food self-sufficiency rate is well over three hundred percent. Many countries import wheat from Kurt."

"Thanks to that, wheat is inexpensive, and there's a wide variety of bread. It seems like almost all types of bread made around the world originated from the Kingdom of Kurt."

"Oh, so you really know your stuff."

"I learned all of it in middle school."

It seems that general education for the common world is almost complete by middle school. There wasn't any geography or world history on the entrance exam for the Advanced Magic Academy, so I never studied it at all.

"In that sense, Princess Mei, you get to study geography hands-on."

"I get sleepy in class, but I enjoy this kind of studying!"

"Mei, are you really studying properly?"

"Oh, whoops, I messed up!"

Watching Mei-chan, who was being teased by Og, Mark unexpectedly said something.

"In the Kingdom of Kurt, when it comes to wise people and priests, priests are more popular."

"Huh? Is that so?"

"Yeah, it might be true."

"Well... Granny used to be quite active in her younger days, so it's not surprising if she's popular even now."

"It's not that, it's something more practical."

"Practical?"

I wonder what it could be. Is it related to magical tools?

"Well, I think you'll understand right away when we get to the Kingdom of Kurt."

He said that and didn't provide any further details.

Hmm... I'm curious.

And as always, they crossed the border and entered the Kingdom of Kurt before taking to the skies again.

"Wow, unlike the Kingdom of Caranan, this is a granary region..."

"It's quite a sight. It looks so different from above."

"It's like a carpet of wheat!"

The wheat fields, still a few days away from harvest, were not golden but looked like a green carpet covering the entire area.

"This is amazing... I can see why their food self-sufficiency rate is high."

However, there was one question here.

"With such a vast expanse, harvesting must be quite a task, right?"

It's like they're implying that I'm causing trouble on purpose.

But, during this trip, there hasn't been a single day without trouble...

Upon arriving in the Kingdom of Kurt, after Og and the others headed to the royal palace as usual, and with no need to stay at an inn since they were returning today, we had nothing to do, so we decided to explore the city for a while.

"Oh... I can smell something good."

"Yeah, you can smell the aroma of bread baking all around."

"I'm hungry."

Since none of us had anything specific we wanted to do this time, we all decided to walk around the city.

As we strolled through the city, there was a delightful aroma in the air, and just walking around was enough to make our stomachs growl.

"Ah! They're selling sandwiches! Let's all buy some and eat together!"

Looking around, we noticed many people walking and eating sandwiches or crepes. It seems like this style is common in this country.

There were various sandwich stalls, each offering something unique. There were meat-focused stalls, vegetable-focused stalls, and even fruit sandwiches. There were so many options, and it was a bit overwhelming.

The ladies opted for vegetable and fruit stalls, while the men chose meat-focused ones to buy sandwiches.

I bought a sandwich with various kinds of ham, cucumbers, and lettuce. I personally think the combination of cucumber, ham, and mayonnaise is the best.

"No, no, bacon, tomato, and lettuce is the best."

"No, it's all about the combination of onions and olives."

"No, lettuce and ham with cheese, right?"

"No, no."

"No, it's..."

Well, it's clear that everyone has their own preferences, and we couldn't come to a conclusion.

The sandwiches were made with long, narrow bread instead of regular slices, so as we walked and talked, we debated passionately about whose sandwich was the most delicious.

With eleven people all expressing their opinions at once, it was quite chaotic.

As we continued to explore the city while enjoying our sandwiches, we came across a bookstore at a street corner, with pictures of young men and women hanging outside.

"Oh, it's the Wise One and the Guide!"

"What... did you say...?"

Alice was shocked when she saw the picture of a young, provocatively smiling, black-haired, wild-looking handsome man, and the picture of a red-haired woman wearing glasses, who had an intelligent yet somewhat alluring appearance.

Is this the picture of Grandpa and Grandma?

"Oh, they're so cool, Merida."

"This Wise One over here is drawn quite well too."

"But, as expected, it's the Kingdom of Kurt. There are more books related to the Guide rather than the Wise One."

"Huh? Aren't books all the same?"

"It's not that simple. Both the Wise One and the Guide have new books published every year, even now."

"Starting from the first book claimed to be the original, they range from those that tell untold behind-the-scenes stories to complete fanfiction in various genres."

Really... Grandpa and Grandma are in quite a situation...

"Hmm, the way they're depicted now is impressive, but their older images are wonderful as well."

"I've only known the elderly version of the two since I was born..."

They've always been Grandpa and Grandma to me, just a bit younger back then.

Seeing old family pictures like this makes me feel a bit awkward.

"Have you all come from Arlsheid?"

"Huh? Yes, that's right. How did you know?"

While talking and looking at the pictures hanging outside the store, the bookstore owner approached us.

"The young man over there mentioned something about seeing the two of you recently. The story of the two of you returning to Arlsheid with your grandchild has become well-known, so I thought maybe you'd also seen them in Arlsheid."

"Oh, I see."

So this story has reached foreign countries too?

"Huh? Seen the two of them?"

"Wow, I'm so jealous!"

"I'd love to see them at least once."

Others who overheard the conversation gathered around.

Everyone was praising Grandpa and Grandma.

At a somewhat awkward moment, Mei-chan unintentionally blurted out, "Shin, you're blushing."

"Why are you the one blushing?"

"Shin, you're the grandchild of Merlin-sama and Merida-sama!"

At that moment, I felt the air around us freeze.

Everyone paused to process the words they had just heard, then slowly turned to look at me.

"The grandchild of the two of them?"

"Really? Is this for real, or a prank?"

"Well... it's hard to believe a little kid like her would make something up like that."

"Plus, she seemed embarrassed when she asked about their story."

"So... is it true?"

Gulp...

"They're the real grandchild of the two of them!"

They all crowded around me at once.

"Whoa!"

"I'm sorry! Excuse us!"

"Wait a second!"

"Autograph! Please give us your autograph!"

"Handshake! Shake hands with us!"

Autographs? Handshakes? I've never done anything like that before, it's like I'm an idol or something!

I grabbed Mei-chan, who was beside me, and tried to escape from the crowd that had gathered around us.

"Come on, Mei! Don't you realize that saying something like that in a place like that would lead to this?"

"Sorry..."

"Don't blame Mei too much, Ellie. She didn't mean any harm."

"Shin, it's your fault!"

"Me? Is it really my fault?"

"This commotion is definitely your fault."

"Ellie, are you okay?"

"Huff! I'm exhausted!"

In the end, we all ran away together.

Staying there would only lead to more questioning.

In the midst of it all, Ellie, the only one in our group who couldn't use magic to enhance her body, quickly reached her physical limits.

By the way, Mei-chan was still held in my arms.

"Excuse me for a moment!"

"Huh? Kyaa! Alice?"

"Can you manage like this?"

Among our group, Alice, the smallest except for Mei-chan, carried Ellie in her arms and started running.

It's a strange sight, a small girl princess-carrying another girl...

"By the way..."

"What's the matter?"

"You keep saying 'Poyopoyo' over and over! Are you making fun of me?"

"I'm not doing it on purpose!"

"Don't squirm!"

"Please don't squirm!"

What are they doing...

More importantly, it feels like the number of people is increasing rapidly.

Uh-oh... What should I do?

"Wolford-kun, your cloak."

"Oh, right! Optical camouflage!"

I hadn't even thought of it in all the chaos. I could activate the optical camouflage attached to my cloak.

"Okay, activate the optical camouflage in that alley over there!"

"Roger!"

And then, when the group entered the alley...

"Hey, where did they go?"

"They were just here a moment ago!"

"They disappeared so quickly... It's truly befitting of the grandchild of the two of them."

"Oh no, I was just about to get an autograph!"

"We can't help it, let's give up."

...Phew, we managed to escape somehow.

Actually, I activated the optical camouflage and stayed right in front of them the whole time.

Even though everyone could see us, I couldn't activate the optical camouflage, so I was nervous the whole time.

"Is everyone here?"

"Yes."

"We're here."

"Yeah, I was really nervous!"

"That's true. We knew we couldn't see you..."

"I can understand how famous people being chased must feel..."

One by one, we deactivated our optical camouflage and became visible.

While we were sharing our thoughts about the grand chase we had just experienced, Mei-chan looked a bit down.

"What's wrong, Mei-chan?"

"...I'm sorry, Shin."

Oh, it seems she's bothered by what happened earlier. She's still a young girl, even though she's a member of the royal family, and there were no situations where she had to be careful with her words.

Blaming Mei-chan in this situation would be cruel.

I gently put Mei-chan down from under my arm, patted her head, and spoke to her.

"Don't worry about it. It's because I'm the grandchild of my grandfather and grandmother that it turned into such a commotion."

"But! I accidentally blurted it out..."

It's okay. Mei-chan made a mistake today, right?

"Yes..."

"Well, you won't make the same mistake again, will you?"

"I won't do it again!"

"Great. So Mei-chan, you've grown a little from this, right?"

"Yes!"

"Alright, this matter is over. I don't mind, and you don't need to worry about it, Mei-chan."

Mei-chan, who had been looking at my face for a while, hugged me with teary eyes.

"I'm sorry, Shin Onii-chan."

"Yeah. Just be careful next time, okay?"

"Yes!"

Everyone watched Mei-chan with warm eyes.

"Why are you here?"

"Oh? Oh, you're tired. Is it over?"

Such a scene, with the exhausted Ogre party finishing their negotiations, was witnessed by us.

Perhaps they had detected our magical energy with search magic, but they probably didn't expect to find us in the back alley.

"Ah, it's all done. Now we just need to get the cooperation of Els and Ys. By the way, why are you here?"

"Well, then let's start heading back."

"Hey!"

We started walking towards the gate, interrupting Ogre's questioning to avoid any potential trouble or Mei-chan getting scolded.

"Are you hiding something from us?"

"No? Not really? We just wandered around and ended up here."

"...Is that so?"

"It really is."

"Could it be that you got involved in some weird trouble again?"

"Are all my actions just assumed to lead to trouble!?"

"Well, that's often been the case before..."

As we continued with our usual exchange and approached the city gate, the sound of bells suddenly rang throughout the capital.

Soldiers on horseback rushed out from the gate.

"Emergency alert! Demon attacks! All personnel, evacuate immediately! I repeat, evacuate immediately!"

While they were issuing evacuation warnings about the demon attack.

"Trouble-prone, that's the perfect word for you."

"I'm starting to feel that way myself..."

This is the third incident today!? What's going on!

"Blaming Shin here won't do any good. Everyone, change into your combat gear for interception."

"Yes!"

"Well, it was fortunate for the Kurt Kingdom that the attack occurred when we were here."

"For us, it's a disaster, though..."

The whole Kurt Kingdom was in turmoil, and people, including citizens and tourists, rushed to designated evacuation locations. Amidst the commotion, we re-entered the alley, activated the optical camouflage on our cloaks, and changed into combat gear.

It's quite useful even in such situations.

It's purely coincidental, though...

We finished changing and headed outside the city walls, but what about Mei-chan and Ellie?

"Mei and Ellie, stay on the city walls like you did this morning. I'll ask the Kurt Kingdom's soldiers to assign guards to you."

"Are you sure about this? Is it safe?"

"We have defensive magic tools, and if you focus on defense, it shouldn't be too dangerous."

"This is incredible! It's like a VIP seat!"

"What are you saying, Mei?! Demons are a threat to humanity!"

"Shin and the others can defeat them all!"

Mei-chan looked at us with eyes full of anticipation.

"This isn't a place to show off your cool side."

"Leave it to me, Princess Mei! I'll show you my cool side!"

"Sigh... am I weird for not feeling nervous even though we're about to fight demons?"

"I feel the same way, Yuri. I was just a regular city girl..."

Those who had experienced battles with demons in the Swede Kingdom all had a composed expression.

It's better to be confident than nervous...

"Don't let your guard down. Last time, it was manageable because Strohm wasn't around. This time might not be the same."

Ogre really knows how to keep us focused.

What could be the intent behind this attack in such a short period?

As long as we don't know that, we shouldn't let our guard down.

As we reached the city wall, a soldier noticed us and came running over.

"Hey! What are you guys doing? Didn't you hear the emergency alarm?"

"We heard it, and that's why we're here. Is there someone in charge here?"

"What are you talking about!?"

"What's going on?"

Having overheard the conversation between Ogre and the soldier, a senior soldier with gray hair approached us.

"Ah, it's you, just in time."

"Huh? Y-Your Highness August!"

"Huh?"

The older soldier knelt down as he said that.

"Please rise. It seems like something serious is happening."

"Yes! Just earlier, the sentries on the city wall confirmed the firing of red signal flares. They continued firing more afterward, so there's no doubt."

"I see. To think there would be an attack while we are in this country... Is it good luck or bad luck..."

"For us, the citizens of the Kurt Kingdom, it's undoubtedly good luck. For the demons, it's bad luck."

"Um, sir... Longtime leader? These people here..."

"Ah, they are His Highness August, the Crown Prince of the Arsheid Kingdom, who was visiting our country, and the members of the Ultimate Magicians."

"His Highness August!? The Ultimate Magicians!?"

The soldier who exclaimed opened his mouth wide, then quickly knelt down.

I see, this soldier is a high-ranking officer, part of the military. He probably knew Ogre and was present at the negotiations, I suppose.

"I-I-I apologize profoundly! I've made a grave mistake!"

"No worries. Your statement came from concern for the people. You have nothing to worry about."

"T-Thank you very much!"

Just like in the Swede Kingdom, they quickly win over soldiers from other countries. The soldier's eyes were moist.

"Now, the reason we visited this country was precisely to respond to situations like this. Let us fight to our heart's content."

"We are grateful for your assistance. However, it feels somewhat uncomfortable to leave everything to you, Your Highness."

"Of course, we'll have you all work as well. Have the defensive magical tools from Arsheid arrived?"

"Yes, they have been provided along with the communication devices."

Those magical tools are capable of warding off the demons' magic. They've been tested in the Swede Kingdom. We will handle the offensive part, so leave the defense to us."

"Understood."

"Also, I'd like to request protection for my sister and fiancée. Well, we've provided them with defensive magical tools too, so it might be more of a formality."

"You have our assurance. We will protect them diligently to prevent any unforeseen circumstances."

With Kurt Kingdom soldiers leading them, Mei and Ellie left the area.

As they moved away from the city wall, Mei's voice could be heard yelling to the soldiers, "The city wall is the best spot! It's a prime location!"

"They don't seem to have an ounce of tension."

"That's because they have immense trust in Your Highness."

"More so in Shin over here."

"Oh! Are you the grandchildren of the Sages and the Prophets?"

It's irrelevant, but in this country, it's clear that grandmas come first.

We can't bring Grandpa to this country... He'd likely vanish into thin air.

"I'm Shin Wolford. Nice to meet you."

"I would've loved to hear the Sages and Prophets' tales, but..."

"Yes, it doesn't seem like we have the luxury for that right now."

Another red signal flare was launched.

The group of demons had approached to a point visible to the naked eye.

"Now, should I address the people of this country?"

"Yes, please go ahead."

With that, Ogre activated a voice amplification spell and made an announcement to the citizens of the Kurt Kingdom.

"Kurt Kingdom citizens, I urge you to listen calmly. I am August von Arsheid, Crown Prince of the Arsheid Kingdom. A group of demons is currently invading your country. I understand you are all feeling threatened. However, you can rest assured. Why? Because today, in this country, we have gathered the Ultimate Magicians."

Not only the citizens but also the soldiers gathering on the city wall were listening intently to Ogre's proclamation.

"You have probably heard about the incident in the Swede Kingdom. The demons that attacked the Swede Kingdom were repelled by the Ultimate Magicians. I, as a member of the Ultimate Magicians, am here too, along with Shin Wolford, the grandson of that hero. Let me declare: Kurt Kingdom will be safeguarded by us, the Ultimate Magicians!"

As he made this declaration...

"Whoooa!"

Cheers could be heard from both the soldiers on the city walls and the people in the depths of the capital.

With this, the fears of the Kurt Kingdom citizens were likely alleviated. Now, all that remained was to repel the incoming demons.

"They're getting closer. Begin preparing for interception."

"Understood. Everyone, prepare to activate the defensive magical tools!"

"Rest assured, everyone. Shin, who's here with us, directly received guidance on creating magical tools from his grandmother, Lady Merida, and has surpassed her. He can easily defend against demon magic spells, up to the level of a demon's magic."

By referencing the popular grandma in this country, they seemed to have gained the trust of the Kurt Kingdom soldiers. Everyone looked calm and composed.

"Here they come! Activate the defensive magical tools!"

Finally, magic was cast by the group of demons, but all of it was deflected by the activated magical tools.

"Whoa! Amazing!"

"They really blocked it!"

"We can do this! We can do it!"

"As expected of the grandson of the Sage!"

Everyone was celebrating the successful defense against the demon magic, but even so, it felt like magic was weaker here compared to Cartahena.

"These demons seem bewildered. Shin, strike while they're in disarray!"

"Got it! I understand!"

Right now, there was no time to consider the strength of their magic. First, the demons needed to be defeated.

Shin and Tony activated their jet boots and charged straight towards the demons.

"Raaaaaah!"

"Shaah!"

Swinging their vibration swords, they cut down the demons in their path. Shin and Tony took down one demon each.

Immediately after, the magic from others who had caught up from behind struck the group of demons, and the demons were rapidly being defeated.

While sporadic magic attacks came from the demons, they were blocked by the magical barriers before activating the magical tools.

Before, they used to pair up into teams of two, but now, it seemed that they could handle things just fine alone.

As they defeated the demons around them, Shin couldn't help but feel the growth of his companions.

And then...

"It's them! Retreat! Quick!"

The same voice Shin had heard back in the Swede Kingdom sounded again, and once more, the demons began retreating.

"Again? They're retreating way too quickly!"

They hadn't even defeated half of the attacking demons yet, but the demons were once again beginning to retreat.

What's going on? Why do they retreat immediately after being engaged? What's their intention?

Since this was outside the city walls rather than in the city, they couldn't use magic to blow them away all at once. Nevertheless, they activated the directional explosion magic to reduce their numbers as much as possible.

"Wait, Shin! That magic is..."

While Oug was trying to say something, the magic activated and caused a huge explosion right before their eyes. Since many of them had scattered in different directions, they could only catch a few.

They once again let more than half of them escape. It was because the demons were fleeing so easily. Not suspecting a diversion at this point would be strange.

Just to make sure, Shin went back to Arsheid by himself. As expected, there was no demon attack.

Feeling uneasy and dissatisfied, he returned to the others. They all looked at him with exasperated expressions.

"Huh? What's wrong?"

"Shin, I should have told you not to use that magic."

"That magic?"

"The explosion magic."

"Why?"

"Look behind you."

When he was told that and turned around...

Kurt Kingdom was known for its cultivation of wheat, and there were many wheat fields around the capital city. They were fighting in the middle of these fields.

"Is it bad?"

"It's bad! You idiot!"

Facing the vast wheat fields that had been blown away, Oug scolded Shin seriously.

While Shin was scolded by Oug after blowing away the wheat fields, another group of demons used far-sight magic to observe the situation.

Strom was clutching his stomach, writhing and twitching. The sight of the demons being repelled so easily must have been quite amusing to him.

Milia and the others had different thoughts this time.

"They charged head-on like last time, were repelled in the same way, and now it seems like they suffered no damage..."

"What can I say... It's beyond poor."

"Although it's not Lord Strom, I can't help but feel like I'm watching a comedy."

While in the previous encounter, they had a strong sense of caution against Shin and his group, this time their comments mostly focused on the poor performance of the demons that had been repelled by Shin and his companions.

"Phew... Haah... Are they trying to make me die of laughter? These guys?"

Strom, who had finally revived, muttered this while catching his breath.

"The real formidable opponents might not be Waldford here, but them. At this rate, I... I... Haha, ahahaha."

Watching Strom laugh again, those around him couldn't help but feel a mix of emotions at the pitiful sight of their former comrades.

"...But well, I hope this makes them lower their guard."

"Yes, indeed. It's annoying that they see the strength of the demons in that pathetic display... but if they underestimate us, it might work in our favor when they attack."

Milia and the others, former combatants turned into demons, reluctantly agreed.

"I... I can't take it anymore..."

Strom, who started convulsing again, pretended not to see what was happening.
