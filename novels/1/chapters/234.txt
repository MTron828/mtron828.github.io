On the ground, everyone waved at us without change.

So the pilot was considerate and circled several times in the sky.

Thanks to that, we were able to make our final greetings to everyone on the ground.

And then, we began to fly towards the desert as we left the capital city, Eilon.

Sigh...

Og sank deep into the seaplane's seat while saying so.

"You must be tired."

I handed Og a cold drink while saying that.

"Yeah, sorry."

He accepted it and took a sip, exhaling deeply once again.

"Finally, I can relax a bit."

He finished the drink in one go and stretched widely.

Even such a simple action feels like it's been a long time since I've seen it.

"This is the first time we've had diplomatic talks with a country we've never visited before. We can't even communicate, so I haven't been this tired in a while."

"Lately, there hasn't been much of what you would call 'diplomacy.'"

"After the War of the Demon King, the unity among nations has grown stronger."

The relationship between Arlsheid and its neighboring countries is better than ever before. The sense of camaraderie that they all came together to face the threat of the Demon King Strom and overcame it has made the leaders and citizens of each country very friendly toward each other. Thanks to that, it seems like there haven't been any major issues requiring Og to travel.

I guess it's true that having a common enemy can strengthen unity.

Hearing this, Shaolin looked a bit worried.

"Um, everyone seems so close, is it okay for me to be included?"

Oh, right. Quan Long is a newly established diplomatic partner this time. They had no involvement in the War of the Demon King Strom. While there's a sense of camaraderie with the other nations who fought together in the Demon King's War, she might be concerned about not sharing that bond.

"Don't worry; you'll be fine. The purpose of this mission is to have us observed by all the nations. It's not just a friendly gathering. Don't be too concerned."

"Are you sure?"

Og says not to worry, but Shaolin's expression doesn't look very reassuring.

"Well, there's always the possibility of it being just a facade," added Naval.

"Even in Els, the Ultimate Magicians are quite popular, right? If I get to work with people like them, I might forget my facade."

"Oh? Is the person being dispatched from Els like that?"

Og said this provocatively, and Naval replied with a sly smile.

"No, no, the personnel we're sending from our side aren't like that. And I gave you the documents, didn't I?"

"The documents only contained the person's profile. It didn't include details about their personality."

"Well, let me vouch for that part. The person we're sending is not the type to neglect their duties just for the sake of personal enjoyment."

"I see, that's reassuring."

Og said that, and Naval looked exasperated.

"You're talking as if we're sending an observer, but it's just part of the job. They're being dispatched as an administrative officer, so they need to do their job properly."

"Alright."

Naval said this and lay down on the seat, seemingly indicating the end of the conversation.

"Please, try not to rock the boat too much."

Saying that, he placed a towel on his face and began to rest.

... What about the baggage handling?

It seems that he's too hungover to worry about that.

Og and I exchanged glances, and shrugged.

I guess I'll have to report this to President Aron later.

As I was thinking about that, Naval let out a scream.

In response to that scream, I hurriedly looked at Naval...

"Hey! Young master! Don't shake your head!"

"Oita, morning?"

Although it was strange that he was sleeping with a towel on his face even though the sun was up, Silver removed the towel and was shaking Naval's head to wake him up.

"Hey! What are you doing, you brat!?"

"Sorry, Silver! I'm up!"

"Mu."

Og, who had been watching the scene, laughed loudly.

"Naval, the diplomat, is telling Silver to do his job, you know?"

"Are you saying that?"

"But, the reason you and Aaron President didn't return with him was to take care of the baggage, right? You haven't done it at all so far."

"Well, that's true, but..."

"Hmm. Maybe I should report it to the President..."

"Alright! Alright! I get it, just not that!"

Naval desperately tried to stop Og and reluctantly got up.

"Haah... exhausting. Hey, we'll switch out in a bit."

"If I can get up, I'll take over."

"I'll wake you up."

Yelling must be exhausting too.

The Els delegation whispered to each other in hushed tones, having such a conversation.

"Good grief. Silver, you did a great job."

"Yes!"

Og praised Silver, and Silver proudly raised his hand.

"Enough already."

Sissily, who was holding Silver, looked exasperated.

In this friendly atmosphere, the seaplane reached the border between the desert area and Quan Long.

"Now, from here on, the scenery won't change much. Let's take a little break," Og said and closed his eyes while sitting in his seat.

"Hey! You tell us to stay awake, and you go to sleep yourself!"

"Is there a problem? I don't have any luggage to manage. I'm just on board as the person in charge of operating the seaplane. I don't have any specific tasks."

"Grr..."

Naval, outwitted by Og, looked frustrated.

But well, Og is right.

Naval doesn't stand a chance...

"Your Highness, if you have a moment, may I inquire about the duties of the Ultimate Magicians now?"

Come to think of it, Shaolin rode the seaplane to hear that story on the way back.

"...,"

Since Shaolin had asked him for permission beforehand, Og couldn't refuse.

"That's right..."

Og said and got up from his seat to face Shaolin.

Afterward, the conversation proceeded in the form of Shaolin asking questions and Og providing answers.

They discussed the nature of the work that Shaolin and her colleagues were doing. Mainly reception and accounting, along with distributing requested tasks. They installed fixed communication devices in their office and set up wireless communication devices to relay messages to each individual when a call came in. These were the primary responsibilities.

By the way, there was a proposal to open up direct contact to the fixed communication device. However, this was expected to result in a constant stream of messages. So, as it has been until now, all requests are first sent through the palace, where they are examined before the message is relayed.

Given that we used to be students, only the most urgent requests were accepted.

The conditions for accepting requests seem to have become more relaxed now. In addition, they plan to charge a proper fee for requests. However, this won't directly translate into our salaries. It will be a fixed salary plus a commission based on the number of requests completed.

It's starting to feel more like a professional job. Management of the number of completed requests is also part of the job, essentially everything except going out into the field.

"We haven't really started moving yet, so I can't say for sure, but it's going to be quite busy. There's even a possibility that the whole 'surveillance' thing might become just a facade."

"Is it going to be that busy?"

"Considering the current number of requests that have reached the palace, honestly, we won't be able to handle them all."

"Th-That many!?"

The busiest department in the palace is the one that reviews the requests coming in from various places for the Ultimate Magicians. They claim to conduct examinations even before the requests reach the palace, so just how many original requests are being submitted in the first place...

However, as long as this situation continues, it seems they will be able to continue employing administrative staff.

Honestly, I proposed it, but whether or not it's possible to monitor things with this setup is quite doubtful. Well, it's already halfway just for show, so it doesn't really matter.

With the increasing number of requests, it means we'll be constantly on the move. Surveillance doesn't seem very practical.

"But we will accept the requests, right?"

"Just having our personnel dispatched should provide some peace of mind."

It really is just a facade. Well, it's too late to stop now. Doing so might stoke fears in various nations. Despite the good relations among the countries at the moment, we can't afford to jeopardize that. Additionally, it seems that the personnel being dispatched from various countries are all highly capable individuals. Whether arranging substitute administrative staff now is even possible remains to be seen.

"Shao Lin, did you also work at the Ming family? I'm looking forward to it."

"Yes! I will do my best to contribute, no matter how small my role may be!"

For now, with the work discussion over, let's just relax and enjoy the rest of the journey in the sky.

Silver, however, got tired quickly and fell asleep in Sissily's arms.
