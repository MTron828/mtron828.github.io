On the day they achieved victory in the battle for the survival of humanity, Ekaterina used a communication device to declare their triumph to the whole world.

Upon hearing this declaration, the crowds erupted in joy, and it seemed that celebrations were held in various countries.

I say "seemed" because I didn't witness the events myself.

The reason is that this battle is not over just because they defeated the demons. I have to retrieve the magical tools I provided to various countries and revoke their enchantments.

However, even if I wanted to collect them immediately, many soldiers suffered casualties, and some of the items were lost in the process. Therefore, the plan was to first confirm the quantities and then collect them.

So, each country took the items back to their respective nations, counted the number of participating soldiers and weapons collected, and submitted their reports. But here is where the trouble began.

While I had removed the magic from the weapons of various countries and asked for their return, Darm was the only one refusing to submit.

And when it came time to return the weapons with the enchantments removed, they declared war on Arlsheid.

Darm's argument went like this:

"In this way, Shin-Walford, who can create extremely dangerous weapons, is a more dangerous individual than Strom, and Arlsheid, which is harboring him, is planning world domination. This is a just battle to prevent that!"

They made this proclamation to the world.

This caused a strong backlash from countries and people worldwide.

After all, even if I say it myself, we are the saviors who saved the world.

They called us villains and, above all, their cowardly tactics of taking the weapons I provided and waiting until the removal of enchantments from various countries' weapons were completed angered not only the upper echelons of each country but also the general population.

Looking at it this way, it's a significant event, so why did I lightly call it a "trouble"?

It's because this commotion quickly came to an end.

The one who made the previous proclamation was the young king of Darm whom I had seen at a previous meeting, but he seemed to have decided on it by himself.

By doing such a thing, he was sure to make enemies all over the world, and the Darm army staged a coup.

However, it is worth noting that the citizens of Darm themselves were surprised and angry at King Darm's proclamation. As a result, both King Assari and King Darm were captured and promptly executed.

After the commotion, they quickly submitted the weapons that had been enchanted.

...King Darm had some sort of hostility towards me, but to do something so foolish...

In the end, all the failures of the Darm Kingdom were attributed to the royal family, but the royal lineage was not extinguished. However, all political power was taken away from them.

They were left as mere symbols.

They announced that they would explore a new political system, and for the time being, the interim head of state was the Darm Army's commander.

It was Hiiro Kartun, the one who had asked me strange questions before.

This person had openly criticized the king in the past, and honestly, I didn't have a very favorable impression of him.

Is it really going to be okay?

However, this was an affair of another country, and there was nothing we could do, so we decided to watch and wait.

...I hope nothing else happens...

Because of such an incident, the celebratory atmosphere was temporarily interrupted.

That's probably why...

When it was announced that the wedding of Shin and Sicily and Og and Ellie would be conducted personally by Pope Ekaterina, it created even more excitement than expected.

In Arlsheid, it became a nationwide festival to celebrate the royal crown prince's marriage, and the story of me adopting Silver, the miraculous child, was also made public. Considering that I miraculously survived an attack by monsters in a carriage, it became a topic of discussion that a miraculous child adopted another miraculous child.

And then...

"Shin, I'm coming in."

Og, wearing an all-white tuxedo, entered the waiting room where I was.

"Hmm, it suits you quite well."

As soon as he entered the room, Og, who was also dressed in a white tuxedo, said this when he saw me.

"You, on the other hand... seem to be quite used to this."

"Even though I don't look like it, I am the crown prince. I have plenty of opportunities to wear formal attire."

"I see..."

Seeing that I didn't say anything more, Og had a sly smile on his face.

"What's wrong? Even a renowned hero like you gets nervous about a wedding?"

"Of course! Why are you so calm about it?"

So, this was the waiting room of the Arlsheid Grand Cathedral.

Today, at this location, our wedding, Shin and Sicily's, and Og and Ellie's, is finally taking place.

Even considering my previous life, I was extremely nervous since it was my first wedding. However, it was frustrating to see Og so composed.

"I told you, right? Even though I may not look like it, I am the crown prince, so I'm used to being in the public eye."

"Is that the problem?"

I thought that being a crown prince and appearing in public were different things, but that's when it happened.

"Augusto-sama, are you trying to say that marrying me is nothing out of the ordinary!?"

"Ellie-san, no, that's not it. Please don't furrow your brows like that. We're about to have a wedding."

"I apologize..."

In wedding dresses, Ellie and Sicily appeared in front of us.

"Even though I didn't sleep much last night due to excitement and nervousness... Augusto-sama, it seems you're not the same..."

"Well, it's not like that, Ellie. I've been looking forward to having this ceremony with you like this. I'm more excited than nervous..."

"Really!?"

"Yeah, of course."

"I'm happy..."

While Og and Ellie had such exchanges, I was distracted.

"It's beautiful... Sicily..."

I couldn't take my eyes off Sicily, who was wearing a pure white wedding dress. The dress was, if I recall correctly, referred to as an A-line dress, with a skirt that flared gently from the waist, accentuating Sicily's grace. Our always cute Sicily looked even more adorable, several times over.

"Oh, thank you. Shin, you look wonderful too."

With that compliment and a warm smile, Sicily drew me closer, almost like a magnet.

In her arms, Sicily held a beautifully dressed Silver.

"It's like a dream..."

"Me too..."

"Both of you, I'll make sure you're happy..."

"Just the two of you?"

"Huh? Oh."

That meant that our family would grow...

Understanding that, I corrected my words.

"No, everyone. I'll make sure everyone is happy."

"Yes, I'll protect everyone too."

"Sicily..."

"Shin..."

"All right. Save the pledge of a kiss for the ceremony."

As Sicily and I drew closer, Irene-san interrupted.

"Aha..."

"Ah..."

"I felt relieved seeing that. Come on, Silver will stay with me, so go ahead."

"Yes. Thank you, Mother."

"Hehe... I get to see my grandchild's face right away. Next time, make sure to show your own children properly, okay?"

With Silver in her arms, Irene-san, in high spirits, teased us, but we replied without embarrassment.

"Yes!"

"Yes!"

"Oh? I thought you'd be more bashful. Well, it's alright. In that case, Silver, let's go with Grandma, okay?"

"Daaai."

Not getting the reaction she expected, Irene-san made a slightly sulky expression and left with Silver, heading back to her seat.

Next to arrive were Grandpa and Grandma.

"Just the other day, I thought you were still a child..."

"Time flies, doesn't it?"

They said this with a slightly melancholic expression.

Perhaps influenced by the atmosphere, I, too, started feeling sentimental.

"Grandpa, Grandma, thank you for raising me until today. I'll count on you from now on as well."

"Shin..."

Grandpa was moved to tears.

As for Grandma...

"Shin, you're also becoming a husband and father now. Don't just keep doing foolish things like you used to, okay?"

"Y-yeah, I get it."

"Is that so?"

Stop giving me that skeptical look at a slightly emotional moment.

With that thought, I turned to Sicily.

"Sicily, thank you from the bottom of my heart for becoming Shin's wife."

"I'm truly grateful."

"N-no! Please, Grandpa, Grandma, stop that. I'm so happy to be Shin's wife. Let me express my gratitude instead."

"You really are a good girl, aren't you? Whenever you need help with raising children or anything else, don't hesitate to ask. We'll be there to support you."

"Yes!"

Hmm, this is going quite well.

Why didn't I...?

Just as I was thinking that, an attendant arrived.

"Well, shall we go, Shin?"

"Y-yeah."

Oh no, I'm getting nervous again.

However, the momentum had already begun, and Og and I made our way to the wedding venue.

In front of the crowded audience gathered at the Arlsheid Grand Cathedral, Og and I appeared.

In the front row... our team members were sitting.

The women today were dressed in fashionable dresses instead of their usual uniforms or combat attire.

The men were all in suits.

All of them were grinning as they looked at us.

Come on, don't smirk like that!

And then, after a little while...

"Oh..."

"Wow... beautiful..."

The front doors of the church opened, and Sicily and Ellie, dressed in wedding gowns, appeared arm in arm with their respective fathers.

I've never seen Ellie's father, the Duke before.

He had a beard, and he looked quite distinguished, but he had a stern expression, as if trying not to cry.

On the other hand, Cecil-san... oh, she's already crying.

Sicily is smiling wryly beside her.

As they approached us, the fathers handed their daughters to us.

"Shin... take care of Shi-Shiri, okay?"

It's hard to understand what he's saying with all the sobbing, but I quickly replied.

"Yes, please leave her to me."

The same kind of exchange was happening with Og and Ellie.

"Your Highness... taking my unworthy daughter as your wife is the greatest honor as a subject. Please, I entrust her to you."

"Yes, you have my word, Duke. I promise to make your daughter happy."

"Your words are too kind."

Hmm, it's quite formal over there.

I'm glad I'm a commoner.

And so, Sicily took my arm, and Ellie took Og's.

Then, Ekaterina, who had been waiting in front, spoke.

"Now, from this moment, we will commence the wedding ceremony of August von Arlsheid, Elizabeth von Coral, Shin Wolford, and Sicily von Claude."

And with that, the wedding ceremony began.

First, Ekaterina recited passages from the Bible.

I had never heard them before, but there were emotional reactions from the back of the audience, so it must be something deeply meaningful.

I sneak a glance to the side and see that Sicily is also deeply moved.

And now, the climax is approaching.

"Now then, August von Arlsheid."

"Yes."

"Do you vow to take Elizabeth von Coral as your wife, to love each other at all times, support each other, and spend your lives together?"

"Yes. I vow."

"Elizabeth von Coral."

"Yes."

"Do you vow to take August von Arlsheid as your husband, to love each other at all times, support each other, and spend your lives together?"

"Yes. I vow."

"Shin Wolford."

Oh, here it comes.

"Yes."

"Do you vow to take Sicily von Claude as your wife, to love each other at all times, support each other, and spend your lives together?"

"Yes. I vow."

"Sicily von Claude."

"Yes."

"Do you vow to take Shin Wolford as your husband, to love each other at all times, support each other, and spend your lives together?"

"Yes. I vow."

"Very well. Now, as a token of these vows, exchange your rings."

We put the wedding rings that Grandpa and Grandma had given us on each other's left ring finger.

"Now, before the presence of God, exchange your marital vows."

I lifted Sicily's veil from her face.

"I love you, Sicily..."

"I love you too, Shin."

After whispering these words to each other, I kissed Sicily.

I'm sure behind me, Og is also kissing Ellie.

"Here, I, Ekaterina von Preußen, acknowledge the birth of two couples. May God's blessings be upon these young couples!"

As Ekaterina says this, a dazzling light radiates from her.

It's as if God is blessing our marriage, creating a magical scene.

And thus, the wedding of Shin and Sicily, Og and Ellie, was grandly celebrated and came to a close.

For the following month, festivals were held to celebrate the victory of humanity and the marriage of the Crown Prince and the Hero.

I hope that in the future, happiness will continue to shine on Sicily and us...

Shin and Sicily's wedding took place at the Arlsheid Grand Cathedral.

Various world leaders had been invited to the wedding due to the events leading up to it. Among them was a representative from a currently unstable nation: Darm.

Hiiro, the interim Head of State of Darm, returned to his home and plopped down on the couch.

"Hehehe... I'm the Head of State now... Finally, I've caught up to you, Shin Wolford. It's not allowed for you to have all the good fortune... I'm a reincarnator too..."

Hiiro, who was aware that he couldn't match Shin's strength, thought that by becoming the Head of State, he could stand on an equal footing with Shin. To achieve this, he had manipulated the young king's self-esteem and fueled his dislike for Shin.

The outcome was...

"Well, well, I never thought he'd dance so perfectly to my tune. Well, now I'm the top of this country. I'll go down in history as the person who spread the unique democratic republic system in this world."

Hiiro muttered to himself as he looked out of the window.

At that moment...

"Ugh! Grraaaah!!"

Suddenly, he felt a severe pain in his chest and collapsed where he stood.

"W-What's... grrr!"

The pain persisted for a while but eventually subsided.

"Huff! Huff! Phew... Give me a break! Why now, just as things were getting started..."

Hiiro muttered, pondering his future.

Finally, he could use his knowledge from his previous life to become unmatched in this different world, and he couldn't help but smile to himself inwardly.

At the same time, in the mountainous region spreading east of Else.

Beyond it, further east, in the desert, was an unexplored territory.

No one had crossed it before.

Shin and his companions didn't know what lay beyond, but in that desert, further to the east, there was a large nation.

In that nation, a man and a woman were preparing for their departure.

"Miss Shaorin... Are you absolutely sure about going?"

"Yes, I'm going. If I don't... my family will be finished."

"I see... In that case, I won't stop you. Let's step into the deadly land together."

"I'm counting on you, Leafan."

What they aimed for was the uncharted desert beyond, stretching to the west of the country.

As for what awaited them there, they had no idea.
