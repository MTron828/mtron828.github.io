A few days after the challenging topic of my grandmother's popularity among family members had been discussed, we arrived at Thor's family estate together.

Thor, Sicily, Maria, and I all have birthdays coming up, with Mark's birthday being a bit earlier. Since the appearance of demons, celebrations had been limited, but now there was a desire to buy presents.

However, there was a problem. Our notoriety in the capital city had skyrocketed, making it difficult to shop there. We wanted to go shopping but couldn't leave the city.

It was at this point that we realized something. We could simply use a gate to visit other cities. Everyone knew us in the capital city, but in other cities, the story might have spread, but our faces wouldn't be recognizable because there were no photos or television. So, in other cities, we could shop without any issues.

The women quickly jumped on this idea and began selecting a city to visit. Sicily and Julius's territories were tourist destinations with plenty of souvenirs, so they were excluded. Maria's place was a coastal town with charm, but it didn't have any particular specialty products. They had traded goods, but it was somehow different.

Thor's territory was known for its bustling production. Frägerl's craftsmanship was its own brand, ranging from woodworking and metalwork to decorative items, clothing, and sundries. Most things were branded, and it seemed like a city they definitely wanted to visit, not just for choosing presents.

There was never really a choice from the beginning, but that's why we had come to Frägerl's city.

"Are the girls planning to visit the entire city?"

"Thor, what kind of troublesome city did you create?"

"Your Highness, that's a bit harsh, don't you think?"

"Just kidding. However, while we're staying in this city, I'd like to take separate actions from the women."

"It's impossible, right..."

Before the famous stores of branded goods in the capital city, the women were taking deep breaths. The men watched them with a fearful expression.

Three new women had joined the group this time.

"Thor-chan, let's go around together. Will you guide us?"

"Sh-Shin, you know, using the '-chan' honorific in front of everyone is a bit..."

Karen von Klein, Thor's fiancée and the daughter of the Klein baron, said this. She's a seductive lady with wavy, light brown hair that reaches down to her waist and is two years older than us.

It seems that from a young age, Karen was charmed by Thor's small stature and actively pursued a relationship with him. Thor, on the other hand, has always admired the lady who cared for him since childhood, and they seem to have a very close relationship.

Due to Thor's childhood habit, he still calls her "big sister," and Karen finds Thor's petite size endearing, even though she has grown taller. She had been hugging Thor from behind for a while now.

It seemed embarrassing for them to be affectionate in front of everyone, and Thor's face had been red the whole time.

But Thor blushing wasn't just because they were being affectionate. Actually, Karen is quite a bit taller, and when she hugs Thor from behind, something touches the back of his head.

It's embarrassing to be affectionate, but Thor couldn't help but squirm at that pleasantly embarrassing sensation.

"Thor is a man after all..."

"Sh-Shin, what do you mean?"

"Haha, it's unexpected, isn't it? Thor-kun, who is so reliable, turns out to be such a spoiled one."

"Lord Tony! Please don't tease me like this!"

"Hehehe. Everyone seems to get along well. Thor-chan, your big sister is happy that you're getting along with everyone."

As Karen teased the blushing Thor, she burst into laughter.

Did I do something strange?

"It's amazing, Mr. Wolford. You can talk with His Highness like this."

"Is that so?"

"I'm grateful to you for that. It's thanks to you that Thor-chan has been able to make equal friends."

"Friends, perhaps, but Thor has achieved his abilities through his own efforts."

"Hehe. Let's leave it at that. But I'm grateful to you. Don't forget that."

"Hmm..."

I received thanks from my friend's fiancée.

It's kind of uncomfortable.

"Shin, Thor was never the kind of person to say such things, right? What have you done?"

"Why is it always me in the end..."

"That's because it's easier to settle things that way."

"What kind of reason is that!?"

"Hehe... Haha..."

Karen burst into laughter when she realized the reason why she always used me as the punchline.

Did I do something strange?

"As Karen-sama says, I am also grateful to Lord Wolford."

"Even Miss Sarah..."

And now, the second new addition to the group spoke up.

She is Sarah von Campbell, the fiancée of Julius, and the daughter of the Campbell Earl's family. She ties her golden hair on top of her head, and she has a model-like figure with slanted blue eyes.

The Campbell family is known for producing excellent knights generation after generation, and Sarah received an education as a woman from a martial family. Perhaps because of this, she has the attitude of supporting her husband and following him a little later.

Based solely on that attitude, they appear to be like the samurai and his wife from the past. Both of them have blond hair and blue eyes, and Julius is a muscular man, while Sarah looks like a model, so it's quite an incongruity.

"My husband-to-be, Lord Julius, undoubtedly owes his great reputation to Lord Wolford's help. I can't thank you enough."

"Well, I feel like I've guided Julius in the wrong direction..."

Ideally, I would have liked to have had someone like Chris-nee or Michelle-san teach him and make him a knight, but that wasn't possible at the Magic Academy.

As a result, we ended up with the absurdity of a muscular wizard.

"Well, I, uh, would have liked him to succeed as a knight..."

"Oh, really?"

"However, that's just being picky. Even though it deviated from the original goal, he has become a hero. In that case, the means don't matter."

"Are you really okay with this?"

"Yes."

Good. It seems she's grateful.

It bothers me a little that she's so formal, but when I suggested we talk more casually, she seemed bewildered, so this must be her true self.

"Sarah, don't trouble Lord Shin too much."

"I apologize, Lord Julius."

"I see. Lord Shin, my apologies."

"No, it's not a big deal..."

They really seem like a military couple.

Their interaction only amplifies the awkwardness.

Seems like everyone thinks, "They're so formal." However, I can't help but see this as a historical drama with blond foreigners.

This is how it is. I told myself that and decided to watch Julius and Sarah's interaction.

As I listened to this very awkward conversation, the third woman in the group finally spoke up.

"Um, um! Wh-why am I here?"

"Because, it's not fair if Lilia is the only one left out, is it?"

"Tony-kun!? I heard we were going shopping today!"

"Shopping?"

"W-well, maybe, but I didn't hear anything about being with these people!"

"Sorry for bringing you into this."

"Eek! I-it's not like that! No, it's not, Your Highness! I meant 'amazing' people!"

Tony brought her, Lilia Jackson, and she was on her knees in front of Aug, crying and pleading for mercy.

"Just kidding."

"Your Highness, please don't tease her too much. She's a genuine commoner, you know."

"Ugh, I've been forgetting that lately with this group."

"That can be a problem, you know."

Aug, who was reflecting on his teasing of Lilia, was a little uneasy about the fact that he could be punished by the royal family for teasing them.

His sense of boundaries is truly dulled.

"Don't worry, Lilia-san. It's just Lord August's playful nature."

"I-Is that true?"

"Yes, I'll make sure to talk to her later. Come on, get up."

"Oh, thank you, Lady Elizabeth."

Lilia, who was trembling and crying, took Elizabeth's outstretched hand.

Seeing Lilia sobbing and standing up while sniffing, Aug felt bad for genuinely making the girl cry. He apologized to her.

"I'm sorry, Jackson. I've been used to our usual interactions with this group. I responded the way I usually do. Forgive me."

"It's, it's, it's not a problem at all! Please, don't worry about it!"

This reaction is quite refreshing.

Usually, Aug is respected as a member of the royal family, so we don't see this side of him.

"But, Lilia-san, you should get used to it too."

"Th-then, it's the Saint now? Huh? Get used to it?"

Sicily advised the still overwhelmed Lilia to get used to it.

"After all, even after graduating from the academy, the Ultimate Magicians will continue, right?"

"Y-yes..."

"If Lilia-san marries Tony, we'll have wives' interactions, right?"

"W-wives?"

"Wives?"

"Marriage!?"

"Yes."

Sicily hesitated a bit, feeling a little embarrassed about the term "wives." No, not that. Maybe it's a good idea to get used to it now, as they'll be interacting with this group in the future.

"W-wait, marriage? I'm still a student! It's too early!"

"Is that so? Tony is already a hero of Arlsheid, and I heard he makes a lot from his famous weapon."

"Really? Is that true?"

"Shin, how much do you make every month?"

"I don't know. I haven't checked my account recently."

"Shin..."

Oh, I exasperated Sicily.

"Come on. Show a little more interest in your own assets. Just hoarding them isn't good, you know?"

"Is that so?"

"Yes."

I was more interested in creating things, and I had no interest in income.

I didn't have plans to spend it either. I'm going to launch a telecommunications business in the future, so I need to think about that.

"So, Tony, how much do you make?"

"It's about an average annual income."

"Se-see! It's still too early, right?"

Huh? I think you can have a comfortable married life with an average annual income.

I must have misunderstood because Sicily mentioned the amazing income in the beginning.

"Is that per year?"

"Per month."

"What?"

Oh, Lilia seemed frozen when she heard that the monthly income is about the same as the average annual income.

Wait, it was that much?

"Because they're mass-produced items with reduced durability. It seems they have quite a few deliveries every month."

"Is that so?"

"Shin..."

I'm getting exasperated again.

"That's why there should be no problem with getting married."

"But... I thought marriage was still something for the distant future... and then suddenly..."

Well, that's pretty normal.

"Sicily-san, we shouldn't compare ourselves to them. They have their own pace."

"Ah, you're right, Ellie-san. I've been talking about it a lot with Ellie-san lately, so I just..."

Lately, Ellie, who often hangs out with me, is a comrade in getting married.

The other girls were probably looking at it in a similar way.

And it's understandable that Lilia is confused.

It seems that people who don't go to a prestigious academy and become independent tend to get married early, but that's still a rare case.

No matter what profession you choose, you usually start as an apprentice and earn a low salary at first.

Normally, people start thinking about marriage around the age of twenty. For Lilia, who is only fifteen or sixteen, marriage is still a distant future for most people.

Besides, Lilia is a student at the High School of Economics and Law.

She also has a future as a career woman.

In terms of appearance, she ties her red hair in a ponytail and wears glasses, giving her a serious look.

It's a terrible match next to the flashy Tony.

Is this like a scenario where the class president gets together with a delinquent?

"Lilia seems to aspire to build her career based on her appearance, doesn't she?"

"Based on her appearance?"

"It's an imitation of Merida-sama, isn't it? Her attire."

"Merida's?"

What's going on?

"Yes, that's exactly it!"

Lilia seems happy to affirm this.

"It's quite common among female students at the Economic and Legal Academy. The style with a ponytail and glasses. I've heard that especially red-haired girls are almost all like that."

"Yes! I'm lucky with my red hair!"

"Oh, is that also imitation of Granny?"

"Huh? Mr. Wolfor, didn't you know?"

I didn't.

They all know too much.

"Shin didn't even know that Wise and High Priest were heroes. He was raised as an ordinary grandfather and grandmother."

"Oh, I see."

That's right.

"While being a woman, the High Priest made many magical tools to enrich people's lives, not only in Earlsheid but also from all over the world. She's a role model for girls who are considering entering society."

"Is she also admired there?"

"Yes. At that time, especially, she was portrayed as having a red ponytail, wearing glasses, and looking very dignified."

"I see."

"You say 'I see'... Haven't you even seen that?"

"I... I might have seen it once..."

"I saw it at Kurt's bookstore. I may not remember it because it caused a commotion later."

Ah, that's right. I remembered it with Sicily's explanation.

On the eaves of the bookstore, there was a picture of someone saying, "Who's this?"

"At least in appearance, many girls try to imitate the same style as the High Priest."

"Some even wear fake glasses even if they don't have bad eyesight."

"Is Lilia doing that too?"

"Mine have prescription lenses!"

I seem to have been yelled at.

Whether they have prescription lenses or not seems to be an important detail.

"I also have red hair and wear glasses with prescription lenses. I can say that I'm the successor to the High Priest!"

"No... How many red-haired girls with bad eyesight do you think there are..."

Isn't she respecting Granny a bit too much...

"Successor? By the way, isn't Yuri called 'the successor of the High Priest'?"

Alice threw a bomb towards Lilia, a Granny believer.

"S-Successor of the High Priest...?"

With creaking movements like a robot running out of oil, Lilia looked at Yuri.

"Uh... uhm, I don't know if people call me that?"

Receiving a slightly dangerous look, Yuri also recoiled.

Then Lilia heard his answer and sank to her knees with a dejected expression.

"Th... That... I was supposed to be the High Priest's successor..."

She seemed dazed and despondent.

Is she so shocked that Yuri took away the title of Granny's successor?

"Yuri has talent for making magical tools. The High Priest also recognizes him. The attack magical tools lent out for the demon subjugation in the Magic Beast Territory were made by Yuri. There's no doubt he's the successor."

Lynn delivered the finishing blow to Lilia.

You don't need to put the nail in the coffin so gently...

"Mr. Wolford! Why didn't you make attack magical tools!? Being the grandson, and already having so many titles, if Mr. Wolford had made attack magical tools, he wouldn't have received the title of the High Priest's successor!"

"Why are you blaming me for it!"

She's too desperate for my liking!

"If Mr. Wolford had made attack magical tools... I wouldn't even want to imagine."

"It's impossible to lend something like that to a regular soldier, right?"

"Next, the one who wields those magical tools will start scheming to conquer the world. We can't even think about letting those things be made or lent out."

"I-Is it really that bad?"

Lynn refused to think, Thorne said something stupid, and Aug warned of a new crisis.

In response to these opinions, Lilia's eyes rolled.

Or rather, their perception is quite brutal.

"Lilia. When Shin makes attack magical tools, it's equivalent to creating a world-destroying mass destruction weapon."

"M-Mass destruction weapon..."

"I'm not gonna make something like that!"

Tony explained to his girlfriend as if trying to persuade her.

Listening to the explanation, Lilia swallowed hard.

Oh dear, she's already believed it!

"So, it's not 'can't make' but 'won't make,' right..."

"Hey, Shin. Seriously, stop it? This isn't a joke. It's not a joke!"

Thorne deciphered my words. And I saw Aug, who has been looking desperate lately.

Mass destruction weapon.

Can it be made or not?

'Can be made.'

With my pseudo-scientific knowledge, I can create magic that can produce tremendous power. If I wanted to, I could even make forbidden weapons.

Moreover, it can produce phenomena that defy the laws of physics.

But if I were to create this, I might genuinely attain the title of the "Demon Lord of Destruction."

It's not a joke; it could truly bring about world-ending destruction.

So, I can "create" it, but I "won't."

I've made up my mind about this.

"Don't worry, Aug. I will absolutely never create that magical tool. I swear it."

"I believe you."

"Yeah."

With this promise to Aug, the discussion on this topic came to an end.

It's not really a topic to be discussed openly.

Perhaps sensing the end of this dangerous conversation, Lilia muttered with a frustrated expression.

"Darn it... Well, magical tool creators do have the advantage, don't they? I hate myself for not having magical talent..."

"Hehe..."

Yuri could only manage a wry smile.

He seemed like such an ordinary person...

"So, what are you all going to do? Will the men and women separate, as usual?"

"I'll go with Thorne."

"I understand, Karen."

"Alright, what about the rest of you?"

Thorne attempted to steer the conversation back on track after the awkward moment.

Thorne and Karen will go together.

Since this is Thorne's family territory, it would have been nice if he had guided Karen, but it wouldn't be right to interrupt a couple who get along so well.

So, let's quietly let them go.

"I want to keep the contents of Shin's present a secret, so I'd like to go separately."

Sicily wished for separate activities with me.

In that case...

"In that case, I'll go with Sicily. We've been going to buy each other presents together every year."

Maria preferred to accompany Sicily.

"In that case, I'll accompany Lord August. Mei, you come along too."

"Yes!"

"I see. Mei is coming along as well."

"Is there anything wrong with that?"

"No, it's fine."

That guy Aug, he seems to predict a future where he's being pushed around by two girls.

I heard that he was used as a taxi driver by Julia-san and Mei-chan the other day, and lately, he gives off a vibe like he's being bossed around by Ellie.

Could it be that many of the strong people in this country are women?

The head of the family is Granny, after all...

"We'll go together too."

"We'll also buy Mark's present together."

Olivia seems to be going to buy presents with the recipient.

It's giving off a vibe like they're really experienced in dating.

"Today, I'd prefer it if it were just the two of us."

"Tony..."

Tony is with Lilia.

"I will also accompany Sara to go around the town after a long time."

"Lord Julius... I'm delighted."

Julius is also with Sara.

"We're going in a group of three."

"That's fine."

"Haha, just like during our mission, huh?"

Alice, Lin, and Yuri formed a group.

And then...

"Huh? Did I get left out?"

I found myself left out.

"Would you like to join our group?"

"No, I'd be exhausted in a group with only girls, and it might lead to misunderstandings..."

Alice invited me, but I refused, as I thought that being the only guy in a group of three girls could lead to misunderstandings.

"Then, Shin, would you like to come with me?"

"Well, I think it would be inconvenient to barge in on Ellie, and Mei-chan probably wants to rely on Aug sometimes."

"Hehe, Shin-sama, I appreciate your consideration."

"Today, I'll have my big brother treat me!"

Despite Alice's invitation, I declined because I thought that having a guy in a group of three girls might lead to misunderstandings.

"Shin... you..."

"Sorry, Aug. I don't have the courage to intrude, and I wouldn't want to spoil the mood for Ellie or give Mei-chan a hard time."

"Heh..."

Aug looked frustrated.

Let him be dragged around by the two girls.

However, with the couples pairing off, I found myself with no place to go.

"I guess it can't be helped. I'll go on my own."

Maybe it's nice to travel light every now and then.

This is an artisan city, and there might be something that serves as a hint for magical tools.

"Are you really just letting Shin wander around the city by himself?"

"We're worried. He might come up with another strange idea for a magical tool."

"Shin-sama, please restrain yourself! Don't take jobs away from the city's craftsmen!"

Regardless of what Aug and Ellie are saying, Thorne is desperately asking me to restrain myself.

"I assure you that I'll be careful not to let anything like that happen."

"You're plotting something, aren't you?"

No need to worry so much. I've been considering that lately.

After determining the allocation for touring the city, we also discussed where and when to meet up.

During this time, Thorne was persistently reiterating his concerns.

Alright, I'll head out to the city right away.

"See you later, Sisily. Look forward to your present."

"Oh, yes!"

"Lord Shin! Absolutely, positively, restrain yourself!"

I left the scene, listening to Thorne's desperate cry as he was held back by Karen.

Now, let's go search for presents and ideas for magical tools.

"Lord Shin!"
