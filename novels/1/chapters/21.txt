A section lined with noble houses. This section, with many large houses, has few pedestrians, creating a tranquil streetscape. Ort-Lickerman, an investigator from the Security Bureau, had come to the Ritzburg Count's mansion, located in that peaceful corner, for the purpose of questioning Count Ritzburg.

In the Ritzburg mansion's reception room, Ort and Russell sat facing each other.

"Madam, how are you holding up?"

"Oh... She has been bedridden due to stress. Her own son became a demon and was ultimately killed. If I could fall ill, I would too."

"...I can only imagine the pain."

"No, don't trouble yourself. It's our responsibility that Kurt turned out that way."

"Regarding that matter... Was your son always of an arrogant nature?"

"Don't say such foolish things!"

Russell raised his voice involuntarily. Realizing his outburst, he apologized for his loud tone.

"S-Sorry... My emotions got the better of me."

"No need to apologize. And I'll ask again, knowing it might be impolite. Was your son always of an arrogant nature?"

"No... As you know, our nation puts the people first. Nobles exist for the sake of the people, and the royal family exists for the sake of all, including nobles. The people are the nation's treasure and should be protected above all else. I've been teaching Kurt this since he was a child. He may have been a bit high-handed, but he should have had a sense of protecting the people."

"Until now, there haven't been any such behaviors?"

"I'm not with Kurt all day long... My wife or the servants might know more..."

"We can check with them later. So, this behavior from him was the first time?"

"Yes, it was the first time."

"I see..."

His reputation at the Imperial Magic Academy was completely different from what it was at the Secondary Academy. However, his reputation at the Secondary Academy matched the description.

At the Imperial Magic Academy, he was seen as a "foolish person with an arrogant attitude."

At the Secondary Academy, he was considered a "noble who had high status but cared for the people."

How could his reputation differ so greatly between the Secondary Academy and the Imperial Magic Academy? It was as if he were a different person.

During his time at the Secondary Academy, he behaved like a typical noble from the kingdom.

And during his time at the Imperial Magic Academy...

"Imperial noble..."

"What's that?"

"Well... It's just my impression, but it seems that your son was more like an imperial noble after entering the Imperial Magic Academy."

"...An imperial noble, you say?"

"That's just the impression I got."

"Indeed, the imperial nobility tends to view the common people as objects of exploitation and even deny their humanity," Ort-Lickerman commented.

The way nobility is perceived in the Earlsheid Kingdom and the Blue Sphere Empire is entirely different.

In the Earlsheid Kingdom, nobles are seen as existing to protect the citizens, and it is a common belief that their presence contributes to the prosperity of the kingdom. This is what King Diseum meant by reforming the nobles' consciousness.

After generations of reforms, this belief has taken root, leading to an improved quality of life for the citizens of the Earlsheid Kingdom, increased productivity, and ultimately, increased tax revenue, contributing to the prosperity of the territories and the nation.

In contrast, in the Blue Sphere Empire, it is common to believe that commoners exist for the sake of the nobility. Commoners suffer from heavy taxes and lower productivity, resulting in a significantly lower standard of living compared to the kingdom.

In the kingdom, all children under the age of fifteen have the right to receive equal education, making it almost compulsory. As a result, literacy rates are high, and mathematical skills are strong.

In the empire, however, schools are typically attended by nobles or the children of wealthy merchants, and commoners rarely have access to education. They are not provided with unnecessary knowledge, and those born in the exploited class cannot escape their position because they lack knowledge.

Commoners exist for the benefit of the nobility.

Kurt's words were unmistakably in line with the rhetoric of imperial nobility.

"Could it be that he has been influenced by imperial indoctrination?" Ort-Lickerman wondered.

"Imperial indoctrination!?" Count Ritzburg responded.

"Count Ritzburg, don't you find it strange? Just recently, your son was someone who seemed to think like a kingdom noble, protecting the people, and suddenly, he's saying he can't stand being equal to commoners. Is this something he would say?"

"That's why my wife and I are so confused..."

"Has your son had any contact with someone from the empire or a former imperial resident?"

"Well... now that you mention it..."

"Is there something?"

"There was a teacher at the Secondary Academy that Kurt attended. He's originally from the empire and wears an eyepatch on both eyes. It's said that he caused some trouble in the empire and came to the kingdom for that reason, given his considerable skill in magic."

"Did that teacher have contact with your son?"

"Yes, Kurt participated in the research seminars that the teacher organized at the Secondary Academy. He even served as a temporary tutor when Kurt was preparing to enter the Imperial Magic Academy."

"An empire-native teacher..."

It was suspicious. Anyone would find it suspicious.

So Ort-Lickerman decided to speak with the servants as well.

"Professor Strom? He's a good person. I heard he's originally from the empire, so I thought he might have a strong bias against commoners, but that's not the case at all. He treated us, the servants, with respect."

The testimonies from the servants were mostly in line with this.

Is there really no problem? However, the teacher began working at the Secondary Academy a year ago, and the student he was responsible for, Kurt, turned into a demon.

A year ago.

The timing matched with the recent revelation. Moreover, his student had transformed into a demon.

There were no suspicious aspects in the testimonies, but every action was suspicious. And...

"The day Young Master turned into that... What time was it?"

"I believe... it was in the morning."

In the morning, before he turned into a demon. Additionally, after Ort's visit, Kurt had left his room.

There was no direct evidence, but it was clearly suspicious.

With that in mind, Ort decided to visit the Secondary Academy where Kurt had studied, and as a precaution, he returned to the security team station and brought a young officer with him.

The academy they visited was more luxurious than other academies, reserved for nobles and wealthy merchants. Oliver Strom, who rented a room in the academy, was waiting.

"I'm sorry for disturbing you, Professor Strom."

"We've come to visit."

"No need to apologize. Would you like some tea?"

"No, please don't bother."

Ort observed Strom closely without letting his guard down. Despite covering both eyes with an eyepatch, Strom's movements displayed no hesitation. He was likely using a form of sensory magic, but the specifics were unclear.

Observation alone wouldn't reveal much, so Ort decided to ask questions.

"Professor Strom, I understand you're originally from the empire. I apologize for the impertinent question, but could you please explain how you came to our country, the circumstances of your arrival?"

"Why I came to the kingdom... Well, it's a somewhat embarrassing story. I was born into a noble family in the empire, but I lost in the competition for the family heir. My relatives who wanted to eliminate me barely missed me, and I barely escaped with my life. As a result, I couldn't stay in the empire anymore, and I sought asylum in the kingdom. I even received these scars on my eyes during the attack at the time..."

"I see. I'm sorry for asking such intrusive questions."

"No, it's part of your job, isn't it? Please, don't worry about it."

A conversation without any notable confrontation. However, it wasn't certain how much of what Strom was saying was true. Where did the truth end and the lies begin? The young officer by Ort's side was taking notes. He entrusted the recording to him and continued with the questions.

"By the way, Professor Strom, I've heard that you invite children with magical talent to join your research seminars at this academy and are fostering highly skilled magicians. Why are you doing this, given your background from a former enemy nation, the empire? Is it some sort of retaliation against the empire?"

"It's not unreasonable to think that way. However, I have no such intentions. It's for a simpler reason."

"And what would that be?"

"I am a new teacher here, originally from the empire's nobility. The reception hasn't been particularly warm, you see. To earn recognition in this academy, I wanted tangible achievements."

"And that's your research seminars?"

"That's right. Thanks to my seminars, the children who joined have all improved their magical abilities. Some even passed the entrance exam for the Imperial Magic Academy. I've established my position at this academy."

It wasn't for any particularly noble reason; it was simply a matter of self-preservation. The most natural reason for human actions.

There was nothing unusual in the current conversation. Ort looked at his face, but due to the eyepatch, his expressions were difficult to discern. Ort suppressed the urge to sigh and continued.

"But then, this incident must be unfortunate for you."

"Yes, it is. Kurt is a student I taught and who passed the entrance exam to the Imperial Magic Academy, as I mentioned earlier. I never expected something like this to happen..."

"Wouldn't this incident tarnish your career, Professor Strom?"

At this, Strom seemed slightly annoyed and responded.

"I'm not saying that! Kurt is my dear student! I'm just sad that something like this happened to him!"

"My apologies. I misspoke."

"If you understand, then it's fine..."

Strom, who had appeared momentarily agitated, quickly regained his composure. Whether this was his true sentiment or an act... if that was the case...

"Professor Strom, may I ask you for a favor?"

"What is it?"

"I actually have a request regarding the examination of the body of the individual who turned into a demon."

"Something you'd like to confirm?"

"Yes, we're currently gathering experts from various organizations to conduct an examination, and from what I've heard from you, Professor Strom, you're a highly skilled magician. I'd like to hear your opinion as well."

"I'm not particularly keen on examining the remains of a former student..."

"Please, if you could make an exception. This is for the benefit of humanity."

"...Alright, let's go."

"Thank you. Is it okay for you right now?"

"Really right now...? That's fine. I don't have any research meetings today."

"Thank you. Let's go, then."

Ort signaled the young officer and stood up.

"I hope to hear some valuable information."

"Don't expect too much from me."

Saying so, they headed for the security team station.

Meanwhile, in the grasslands and forests around the capital, investigations were being carried out by the Bureau of Military Affairs.

"Director, I have a report."

"Tell me."

"Yes, it appears the number of magical creatures has indeed increased significantly. They range from small animals like rabbits and squirrels to medium-sized animals like wild dogs, jackals, wolves, and wild boars, and even large animals like bears have undergone magical transformation."

"Why do you think we didn't notice this earlier?"

"Most likely because there were so many small animals, they didn't pose a significant threat. While there has been an increase in medium and large magical creatures, they haven't surged dramatically, and they haven't appeared in groups. By forming formations and cooperating with the Mage Corps, we can fairly easily subdue them. The absence of disaster-class magical creatures like tigers or lions is also a contributing factor."

"I see..."

"Hey, Dominic."

"...Here, you can call me Director, Ruper."

"Hah! You're just going through the titles here. I was the previous director, and I'm going to be the next one."

The man who addressed Dominic, the director of the Bureau of Military Affairs, was Ruper Orglund, the current head of the Mage Corps and the former director of the Bureau of Military Affairs.

With brown eyes and hair, he was slightly disheveled in his Mage Corps robe. He fit the description of a bit of a rogue.

"Subordinates below might not have any respect."

"If you say that, the previous director didn't show any respect to anyone other than His Majesty."

"Could you both stop this...? So, what is it?"

"The one who was talking about speculating on the magical aspect of why magical creatures have increased..."

"Did you figure something out?"

"..."

"Tell me."

"I have no idea!"

"Sigh... I was a fool to have expected anything."

"Well, don't say that. It's only natural not to understand."

"Natural? "

"Yeah, magical creatures are said to be more likely to appear where magic is concentrated over a long period, right?"

"Yeah, that's true."

"But here, in this area, there's not particularly dense magic."

"...So, does that mean..."

"Yeah, your idea of 'artificial creation of magical creatures' is becoming more likely."

"What about the possibility of them moving from elsewhere?"

"Not likely. If that were the case, it would be much more problematic. This gradual increase isn't something that happens. Besides, there have been no reports of increased magical creatures in other cities."

"This is getting really..."

"Yeah, it's suspicious."

Saying so, the top two figures at the Bureau of Military Affairs exchanged solemn glances.

Meanwhile, in a certain room in a castle, a man with a report stood before the lord of the castle.

"What did you say? The number of magical creatures in the Arsheid Kingdom is increasing?"

"Yes, it seems the Bureau of Military Affairs is working on measures to investigate the cause."

"I see. What about our country's magical creatures?"

"Contrary to the kingdom, there are reports that the number of magical creatures in our country has decreased."

"I see..."

"Your Majesty, could this be an opportunity?"

"You're right. The number of magical creatures in our country has decreased, while the kingdom's has increased. Most likely, our country's magical creatures have moved to the kingdom. If that's the case, the kingdom will be preoccupied with dealing with magical creatures, and they won't be able to focus on us."

With that, the man conveyed the message to those present.

"This must be a sign from heaven, calling upon me to unify the world. It would be the height of folly to let this opportunity slip away. Therefore, I will invade the Arsheid Kingdom. I will lead the charge. Everyone, prepare for the expedition."

"Your will be done!"

The man who made the decision to invade the Arsheid Kingdom was Emperor Herald von Blusphere of the Blusphere Empire.

The story returns to the royal capital of the Arsheid Kingdom.

Ort, who had brought Strom to the security team station, arrived at the training ground.

"I'm sorry, Professor. I dragged you out here."

"Why mention it now? It's fine."

Saying so, the two entered the training ground.

"What is this place?"

"Oh, it's the security team's training ground. I thought we'd perform the inspection here."

"In a place like this?"

"Yes."

Saying that, Ort signaled.

Suddenly, knights, soldiers, and mages appeared, surrounding the training ground.

"Your inspection."

"Mine? Why?"

"Well, Ort, you were summoned right after returning from the investigation. What's going on?"

When Ort left Strom's lab, he had signaled a young officer to gather the military personnel.

"I'll explain now, Lord Ruper."

Saying so, Ort looked at Strom.

"Why am I being treated this way? Ort-san. Is it because I used to be an Imperial noble?"

"That's not the reason, Professor Strom. Your testimony was excellent. There's no reason to doubt it just based on your testimony alone. However, you made only one mistake."

"A mistake?"

"Yes, Dominik, who was the one who turned into a demon?"

"Kurt von Ritzburg, right? What's the point?"

"That's correct. Everyone here naturally knows."

"What's your point?"

"Everyone here knows, but it's supposed to be a secret for everyone else."

"Is that so?"

"The king heard about it from Shin Wolfort, who defeated the demon. He immediately imposed a gag order. Nobody should speak about the person who turned into a demon. This is because there were several inexplicable aspects to this demon appearance. This was done to ensure that his family doesn't face unjust treatment. I visited the Ritzburg residence before coming to you, and it was eerily quiet. Considering the national character that feels an exceptional threat towards demons, if people knew that Kurt von Ritzburg had turned into a demon, there would be a massive outcry. The gag order is evidence that it's functioning."

The surrounding knights also realized this, and Strom faced their wary gazes.

"The story that has spread through the royal capital is that 'a demon appeared at the Advanced Magic Academy, and Shin Wolfort, the grandson of a hero who happened to be there, defeated the demon.' People know that a demon appeared, but they don't know who turned into the demon. Those who know are the military, the security team, and some members of the Advanced Magic Academy. So, could you please tell me how you found out that Kurt von Ritzburg had turned into a demon? Because leaking that information is a crime."

When Ort said this, Oliver suddenly burst into loud laughter.

"Hahaha, Ahahaha, Ahahahahahahaha!!!"

"What's so funny!?"

"Have you gone mad?"

Ignoring the bewildered soldiers and security team members, Oliver began to speak.

"I never expected that a gag order was in place. I thought everyone knew because the whole royal capital was in an uproar. So, you're saying only Shin Wolfort is making waves."

"That's right. Everyone is excited because a new hero has been born. Moreover, it's the grandson of an already renowned hero, so it's only natural that the excitement is high. Besides, while people felt threatened by the appearance of a demon, there were no actual consequences. If the citizens are more focused on the hero than on the true identity of the demon, can you blame them?"

"I see. So everyone is more focused on the hero than the demon."

Saying this, Strom began to envelop himself in magic.

"Don't underestimate me!"

At once, Ruper unleashed a fire arrow spell without an incantation, aiming it at Strom. The fire arrow, which appeared to hit Strom, was blocked by a magical barrier.

"Tch! You blocked that, huh? Who do you think you are!?"

"Hehe, I have no obligation to answer that."

Strom said this and cast an explosive magic, breaking the walls of the training ground. He then floated into the opening in the wall.

"Do not let him escape! If he gets away, there will be more victims!"

In response to Dominik's words, the military personnel began simultaneously launching magic and arrows. However, all of their attacks were thwarted by a magical barrier.

"Well, I've completed all the experiments here, so I'll be taking my leave now."

"Experiments... you say?!"

Ort expressed intense anger in response to that statement.

"Did you use Kurt for experiments? You used the life of a young boy with a promising future for your selfish purposes?"

"That's right. My condolences to you. Well, consider yourself unlucky the moment you caught my eye."

"Unlucky? Do you not understand how much pain and suffering his family is going through?"

"Ort, that's enough!"

Ort drew a sabre issued to the security team and lunged at Strom.

"Haa, self-righteous people are so tiresome."

Strom avoided Ort's attack and tried to cast magic from behind.

"Ort!"

Dominik, who jumped in, body-slammed Strom from the side. Ort, along with Strom, was sent tumbling. As the magic passed by them, it struck the security team's compound wall and exploded.

"Oh? You dodged it?"

Strom said this nonchalantly as everyone surrounded him, unsure of how to subdue him.

And then, in the midst of their dilemma...

"What the?! What's going on?!"

They heard a boy's voice.

Everyone turned to see...

"Oh!? What's all this commotion?!"
