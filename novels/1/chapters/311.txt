"Wow! It's so cold! Feels great!"

"Oh my! Please, Charlotte, don't splash around like that! It got on my face!"

"Charlotte, you've done it again! You've upset His Highness Octavia!"

"Haha, Charlotte is so full of energy."

"It's so hot... I want to go back to the room."

After we visited, the Oug family and other families all gathered, changed into swimsuits, and headed to the beach.

Charlotte was the first to jump into the sea, and Via, who was dragged along, complained about getting splashed by Charlotte's water spray. Alisha, who came with us for the first time, also complained to Charlotte.

Max watched over this scene with a smile, while Rain, feeling exhausted from the summer heat, expressed a desire to go home.

The first-year elementary school students are so lively... except for Rain.

Well, it might be more accurate to say that he's being dragged around by Charlotte, who is the most energetic.

Silver approaches the first-year students.

"Everyone, don't go too far, okay? Those who can't swim, be sure to use a float."

"Yes!"

"Big brother Silver!"

Via leaves Charlotte's side to go over to Silver.

"Big brother Silver, um...?"

Seeing Via, who is fidgeting in her swimsuit, Silver smiles gently.

"That swimsuit looks really good on you. You're so cute."

"Ah! Big brother Silver..."

With Silver's casual remark, Via's heart flutters, and she blushes while looking at Silver.

She looks like a girl in love, completely.

Or rather, Silver, you casually complimented Via's swimsuit, but it seems you've become capable of doing that now...

I'm worried about whether you'll make girls cry in the future.

Observing Via, who turned bright red after being praised by Silver, one of the younger kids, Nova, who is Via's little brother, tilts his head.

"Sister, your face is red."

"Huh!? Nova!? Why are you here!?"

"?? We were told to play with Silver's big brother."

"We were told!? Wow, there are so many kids here!"

Lynn's matter-of-fact words somehow resonated with me.

"Oh, I didn't expect to hear such words from Hughes."

Oug, who was nearby, also seemed impressed and, after a moment of surprise, looked at Lynn with amusement.

"I have no husband or children. Therefore, I can see things more objectively than everyone else."

"Really? Does that mean you've started to want children, Lynn?"

Despite Shishiry's teasing comment, emphasizing her single status, Lynn immediately shook her head.

"No. Having children would disrupt my magical research. I'm fully occupied with my own work."

"Is that so?"

Lynn's resolute statement left Shishiry with nothing more to say.

"Hey? Children are great, you know? They're cute! When they come running to you, you want to hug and cuddle them, right?"

Alice, who used to cause trouble with Lynn, has now married and become a mother.

She was explaining the joys of having children to Lynn, but Lynn just chuckled and looked at Alice.

"Alice, who's gone all soft for her children, is quite repulsive."

"That's mean!"

Alice, who was once Lynn's closest friend, was left in shock, carrying the word "Gaan!" on her back, having been cut off so abruptly by Lynn.

"Haha. Well, people are different, and that's okay, isn't it?"

Tony joined the conversation with a smile.

"I like my current life and my family. Alice is happy with her children, and Lynn is content with her current life. Isn't that fine? Besides, even married couples without children exist, you know."

Tony said this and then directed his gaze toward Maria, who was standing beside Shishiry.

"Well, you see, we met after graduating from the academy, so we haven't been together as long as everyone else here. We wanted to enjoy our time alone as a couple for a while. But, well, we're thinking about it now."

Maria said this and looked at us.

"In the past, we used to come here, but we would time our visits differently. We couldn't neglect the Ultimate Magicians, after all."

Despite being invited to Rittenheim Resort every year, we hadn't visited all together until now.

This is because, in case of emergency, someone needed to remain at the Ultimate Magicians' office.

However, this year, everyone participated.

And what does that mean...

"With the younger generation coming up, there's less need for me to stay at the office, right? So, I was thinking of taking maternity leave on my own."

Despite being married, Maria hadn't had children because many women in the group took maternity leave or childcare leave. Maria had been voluntarily covering for them. However, now that the younger generation had grown, the need for this had diminished.

"So, even without us, it's running smoothly now."

The Merchant's Guild had always been managed by Glen and others, but the Ultimate Magicians, including May, Eclair, and new first-generation members like Van and Minea, were steadily gaining power. The new members had developed skills approaching those of our group during our time at the Royal Academy.

Thanks to that, the reputation of the Ultimate Magicians was excellent wherever they went.

There was no longer a reason why it had to be us.

This had been guided to this point.

Thinking about the current situation, I unconsciously muttered words.

"Maybe our mission is over."

When I said that, everyone looked at me with expressions that said, "Huh?"

...Huh?

Maria and others were looking at me like, "What's he talking about?"

"What are you saying, dude?"

I was questioned!

"Yes, that's right. Even though you're still causing a ruckus in the magic tools industry, how can you say such a thing?"

I received a stern look from Thor.

"That's right. More importantly, Shin-sama, can't you make a new type of magic car yet? I've become addicted to magic cars."

When Julius was driving a magic car, it felt as natural as a blond musclehead driving an American car... Oh, he got hooked.

"Actually, we can't have you retire! The Bean Workshop is in chaos thanks to you, Walforde-kun!"

"Yes, that's right! You need to take responsibility!"

Even the young couple, Mark and Olivia, from the Bean Workshop, where I caused the most trouble, directly refuted my words.

Well, I'm sorry...

"Wow, I was surprised. I never thought that Shin-kun, who just being around causes trouble for everyone, would say something like that."

"Hehe, yeah. It was a bit unexpected, don't you think?"

Hey! What do you mean, Alice? And Yuri, you're probably just laughing!

"Haha, if your mission is over, how about turning it into a story or a book about your past life? I'd love to read it."

"If you do that, His Highness will strike you down. Physically."

"Oh, I see, what a shame."

"Besides, even if you leave him alone, Walforde-kun will naturally create chaos."

"That might be true."

Since going to Kuang Long, Tony had stopped hiding his love for the occult. Even now, he often found time to chat with me while holding books of current occult gossip in one hand.

In other words, like Lynn and Alice, Tony was being mean! I'm not intentionally causing trouble!

As they all made mean remarks, I slumped my shoulders in dejection, and Oug gave me a reassuring pat on the shoulder.

His face expressed that he understood everything.

Oug... My first friend and best friend. We had treated each other as cousins and could hang out more freely than anyone else.

I thought he would surely understand me, even when I was hurt.

So, I had believed...

"Shin, even if you hide it, it will eventually come to light. If you have something on your mind, confess it now."

"Oug!?"

He didn't understand anything! On top of that, he suspected me more than anyone else!

"That's enough! It's just that I thought I wasn't needed anymore because everyone has grown up!"

When I said that, everyone finally nodded in understanding.

"Yeah, I was surprised. I thought you were planning to retire at this age."

"That's right. There's no way you could do that."

"Shin-dono is underestimating his own influence."

"Everything you come up with shocks the world."

"It sounded like a joke that someone like you would retire."

"It would be a disaster if Shin-kun retired!"

"I see, it would certainly cause a sensation in the world."

"But what would happen if you retire?"

"I can't imagine. We are currently in a transitional period. Without Walforde-kun, it wouldn't be possible."

"That's right. You won't be able to retire and enjoy a leisurely life for a while, so be prepared, okay?"

Everyone said this, and Oug emphasized that retirement was a distant future story.

Sigh, I understand.

I just have to do my best, right? I just have to do my best.

Thinking that way and feeling disheartened, Sicily gently grabbed my arm.

"I understand what Shin-kun wants to say. The Ultimate Magicians, the Guild, and the magic tool industry are all becoming more active, so even without Shin-kun, they will continue to develop."

That's right! That's what I wanted to say!

"But, if Shin-kun, who has been at the forefront, suddenly disappears, everyone won't know what to do. So, maybe it's still too early to retire?"

"No, I don't intend to retire. I just thought about stepping back a bit from the very front lines."

"Is that so? But..."

After saying that, Sicily turned her gaze towards the children.

"For the children, their dads who are working at the forefront of the world are a source of pride. They all love their dads, but they love their hardworking dads the most."

Intrigued by Sicily's words, I looked at the children too.

And then, it seemed that Shal noticed my gaze or something, as she waved her hands vigorously.

"Daddy! Mommy! Let's play together!!"

Shal, with a joyful expression, waved her hands, and Silver also called out.

"Father, Mother, this might be a bit too much!"

Silver, who was taking care of the eight toddlers, asked for help because the number of children was overwhelming.

Next to Silver, Viachan was also helping to take care of the toddlers, but for some reason, she had a slightly flushed face and was muttering something.

In response to Silver's call for help, I approached them, and Viachan muttered, "Big brother and cooperative work... children... hehe."

...Wait, isn't she just six years old?

I was a little taken aback by Viachan, who seemed to be tripping into the future. As I was a bit uncomfortable with this, there was someone clinging to my feet.

"Daddy!"

My son, Sean, who had blue hair and resembled Sicily, clung to me with a beaming smile.

I lifted Sean up, and Sicily leaned in close.

"Hehe, you see, it's not the time for retirement, dear. We have to continue showing these kids a proud example."

After her words, I looked at Sean, and he smiled and clung to me happily.

Silver approached me, and I ruffled his hair with words of encouragement. He blushed a bit but smiled happily.

"Suu-ree-!! And Shal too!!"

"Oh no!!"

As I interacted with my sons, my daughter Shal, who was feeling jealous, sprinted over at full speed and leaped onto my back.

"I called you first!! Not fair!"

Shal, sticking to my back, complained like that.

Before I knew it, I was surrounded by the children.

Seeing this, Sicily was smiling happily.

"That's right... There's no time for retirement."

"Huh? What do you mean?"

"Oh, it's nothing. Alright! Well then, from here on, we're going to play together!"

Saying that, I used magic to lift seawater and let it rain down from the sky like a shower.

"Wow!"

"Eek!"

"Hahaha!"

The children were ecstatic about the sudden seawater shower.

Silver looked up at me with eyes full of admiration and said, "Amazing..."

That's right.

I must continue to be their role model from now on.

Until the day when these children surpass me, I will keep running forward.

That's the pledge I made on this summer day.

By the way, the seawater shower ended up soaking the parents as well, and they voiced strong protests about their hair being drenched in seawater.

...We might not be very dignified, but this is still very much like us, isn't it?
