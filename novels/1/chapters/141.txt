"...Wishing for their own destruction...?"

Having finished treating Miranda and returned to my side, Shisilly's voice held a hint of confusion.

"I didn't say it with complete certainty, but... "

In light of the previous battle, August and the others considered strategies to break the stalemate. Naturally, they expected the demons to do the same.

"The demons are charging at us without any apparent strategy or escape plan. I mean, nobody could have predicted it would turn into such a one-sided situation, but..."

"Are they perhaps... wishing to be defeated?"

"Yeah, that's how it looks to me."

Back then, Strom declared his intention to destroy the world. Considering that, it seems unlikely that they would so easily lose their limited number of demon pawns.

"What the hell are they thinking!?"

While it's reassuring to be able to defeat the demons with ease, Strom's intentions remain incomprehensible.

"Ah! Shin-kun!"

As August grappled with the demons' perplexing behavior, he noticed a demon heading their way.

"Shin-Wolford! Give me that head of yours!"

"...This one too, huh?"

This demon charged solo without coordinating with anyone.

"Haa!"

A spell came straight at him, so August blocked it with a magic barrier.

"Watch out, your back's exposed!"

"Oh, it's not!"

"What!?"

A demon who attacked from behind saw his magic repelled by Shisilly's magic barrier.

Though the demons came at them as a pair, Shisilly and August were also a duo. There shouldn't have been any openings in their defenses.

"Shisilly, sorry to ask, but can you keep that demon in check?"

"Of course!"

"For now..."

"What!?"

He decided to defeat the demon directly in front of him.

"Shh!"

"Ugh! Using a sword as well makes it tricky!"

The vibration sword's swing was barely evaded by the demon.

Clearly flustered by the sudden dodge, the demon's stance faltered.

"Haa!"

August seized the opportunity and struck with his magic.

"Ugh! Gaaah!"

Even though that magic was blocked by a magic barrier cast by the demon...

"There's no way to deal with it anymore, right?"

"Oh..."

While the demon desperately used a magic barrier to block my magic, they got closer.

I swung the Vibration Sword again.

The demon was effortlessly cut down by the Vibration Sword, which the magic barrier couldn't defend against.

"I-I can't believe it's this easy..."

While the other demon was still in shock, I moved over to their position.

And then...

"Guaaaah!"

I grabbed the demon's arm, threw them, and pinned them to the ground.

"You... What's your goal? Why are you launching such a senseless attack?"

Since I was having trouble understanding Strom's goal, I decided to ask the demon directly since they conveniently launched an attack.

Well, I didn't expect them to answer honestly.

"What!? Killing you guys is obviously our goal!"

"Is this the result? It's quite pathetic."

"Shut up!"

"Have you received any orders or strategies from Strom? What's the point of this meaningless attack?"

"How should I know!? We're just pawns in Strom-sama's grand plan! We can't possibly fathom his deep thoughts!"

"Then... are you really given no strategy..."

I had considered that they might have received some strategy and that we were just being manipulated, but it seemed that wasn't the case.

But this means...

"You're just disposable pawns..."

They were told to fight us and ended up getting mercilessly defeated. Even if it was Strom's orders, having your subordinates treated like this...

I thought this as I realized...

"To you... to kids like you who are so privileged..."

"Hey..."

The demon I had pinned down started gathering a large amount of magical energy.

"Do you understand how we feel!!"

"Damn it! Seriously!?"

"Uwaaaaah!"

What is this guy thinking?

Is he trying to let his magical power run wild and self-destruct?

"I won't let you!"

I hurriedly released the demon from the restraint and cut them down with the Vibration Sword.

"Gah!"

At the same time, the magical energy they had gathered dissipated.

Dangerous... They were on the verge of causing a massive explosion...

"You guys... are..."

The demon mumbled this and then breathed their last.

In the end, the conversation didn't provide a clear answer, but I became convinced.

These demons hadn't been given any proper strategy by Strom.

They just acted on Strom's orders and challenged us to a battle.

Those orders were...

Yet, without a shred of doubt, they executed them...

"What's wrong with these guys..."

"Shin, are you okay?"

Shivering from the twisted relationship between Strom and the demons, Shishiri rushed over.

"Jeez! You shouldn't subdue a demon for questioning like that!"

"Ah, sorry. But, thanks to that, I found something out."

"Huh? Through that exchange?"

"Yeah."

I didn't say it clearly.

But with the situation at hand and the demon's words, I became certain.

These guys...

"Strom ordered them to come and die."
