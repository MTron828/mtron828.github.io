"However, regarding the bestowed characters used in the ancient civilization, like Masita, and the reincarnates from the same world like Shin, aren't there many of them?"

In response to my hypothesis, Og questioned, "This is purely speculation, but are you with me?"

"Yeah."

"Perhaps, but I think the world where Masita, me, and you come from is 'close' to this one."

"Close? What do you mean?"

"Maybe in terms of dimensional phase or the distance between worlds."

"...Sorry, I have no idea what you're talking about."

My explanation left not only Og but also Tony and others with question marks in their heads.

"This world has a lot of similarities with the previous one in terms of its ecosystem. Animals, plants, and even humans."

"It's natural for humans to be the same, isn't it?"

"Is it? There might be a world with humans who are like tigers or lions, for all we know."

"Surely not..."

"Can you say that for certain?"

"Well..."

"Nevertheless, even within that, all the flora and fauna are very similar to the previous world. That's why I thought the worlds might be close to each other."

"Hmm..."

While Og was deep in thought with his arms crossed, it's not easy to understand this kind of discussion without any prior knowledge.

"Shin! Could it be that the world you were in was a parallel world?"

There you go, someone with prior knowledge.

I already have an answer ready for Tony's question.

"No, it's not. The constellation patterns are different, and the geography is different."

"I see."

"It's not a parallel world, but you can think of it as the worlds themselves being close. I don't know the details either."

When I said that, Og seemed to give up on understanding.

"Well, there's no helping it. Anyway, is it easier for souls to travel back and forth because the worlds are close?"

"The truth is known only to the gods, I think."

When I said that, Og glanced briefly at Sicily.

"We can't tell the Shrine Maiden of the Creation Faith this story."

"I won't say it, as she wouldn't believe it."

Og was indirectly telling me not to tell the Shrine Maiden at the clinic, but it seemed that Sicily also understood this.

Well, in the first place, it wouldn't be believed.

"Lord Shin, the conversation has gone off track, but may I proceed with the important discussion soon?"

"Important discussion?"

"That's right. Shin's story was too shocking, and I had forgotten about it."

Og said that and turned to me.

"You knew quite a bit about the wars in the previous civilization. Does that mean similar wars happened in the world you came from?"

Ah, I see.

"No, although extremely powerful weapons were developed in the previous era, wars like the ones in the previous civilization didn't occur."

"They were developed, though?"

As a deterrent, yes. Because we knew that if we were to use them, the world would collapse, just like in the previous civilization. So, during the time I was alive, they were never used."

"What about after that?"

"I hope they were never used, but who knows."

"You seem really disgusted by it."

It seemed that my face showed a sense of disgust, and Shaolin pointed it out.

"Well, of course."

"Why?"

"...Those weapons were used in the past... Well, not once, but twice."

I paused for a moment and then continued.

"They were used in the country where I lived in my previous life."

As soon as I said that, there was a murmur around.

"However, that's a story from more than seventy years ago, earlier than the time I was alive. But we were raised from a young age to understand the extent of the damage and the misery caused by those weapons. So, I have a strong aversion to weapons that can wipe out entire cities."

That's why I would never create such magical tools.

With these thoughts in mind, I said this to Shaolin.

"I see, I finally understand the meaning of what Lord Shin said about being able to create them but refusing to."

Shaolin nodded in agreement.

"By the way, how extensive was the damage?"

"Oh, let me think... The area around where the weapon exploded was blown away for a few kilometers, and I know that tens of thousands of people died, but I don't remember the exact numbers."

I probably learned the details in social studies class, but I don't remember any specific numbers.

I felt sorry that I couldn't provide more detailed information, and Og was wide-eyed in astonishment.

"W-What? Tens of thousands!?"

Not only Og but everyone else was equally shocked.

"That was more than seventy years ago. During my time, the power of those weapons had increased by thousands of times."

"..."

At this point, Og seemed to be at a loss for words, and he was left open-mouthed in astonishment.

"I-If such a thing were used... the world would come to an end, wouldn't it?"

"I said that. So, even though I can create them, I won't use them."

"But the previous civilization did use them..."

"That's probably true. I don't know the exact political structure of the previous civilization, but I don't think they'd engage in actions that would make the high-ranking people's children remember their past lives. As a result, the creators of the weapons knew their power, but the users probably didn't. Because it was a powerful weapon, they used it. The result, I believe, was the downfall of the previous civilization."

"I understand... I understand very well. I now realize that we should take measures to ensure that such weapons are not created in the future."

Og had said that he wanted to prevent the current world from repeating the mistakes of the previous civilization.

If he had made this determination, he would likely work with various countries to prevent the creation of such weapons.

Thinking that the discussion related to the downfall of the previous civilization had concluded, Tony casually muttered, "I hate to say this, but the previous civilization was quite a messed-up world, despite its advanced civilization."

Yeah, I thought the same.

Everyone nodded in agreement.n email
