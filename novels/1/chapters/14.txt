for my new podcast on urban design

Julius finished his self-introduction, and after hearing about the plans for tomorrow, today's activities came to an end.

Tomorrow morning, I'll be guided around the academy. After lunch, there will be practical magic training in the indoor magic practice area.

I don't have practice clothes. It's because it's said that this uniform already has advanced defense capabilities thanks to an enchantment. Even if the clothes get torn, they will be provided for free by the academy. By the way, the academy's cafeteria is free, even for tuition. This is the same for the other three major higher education institutions. It's allocated as an annual budget to nurture valuable talents for the kingdom. However, there is no obligation to serve the country after graduation.

This country is amazing.

And my uniform has already been modified.

Hehehe, it turned out exactly as I envisioned.

Originally, the words in this world that were enchanted on the uniform were "Magic Defense," "Shock Absorption," and "Stain Resistance." Objects with three effects through enchantments are considered to be in the advanced category. Most usually have one or two effects.

The effect of "Magic Defense" is to 'mitigate' the impact of magic.

"Shock Absorption" 'mitigates' physical impact.

And "Stain Resistance" removes dirt from the uniform since it's used as is during practical training.

When I confirmed these effects, I thought, "Stain Resistance is good, but 'Magic Defense' and 'Shock Absorption' won't do." The effects are to 'mitigate.'

So, I decided to 'rewrite' the enchantment effects.

First, I had to remove the originally applied magical effects. To do this, I used a specialized staff with magical power wrapped around it, and I carefully removed each character one by one. I also created this specialized staff by myself. It's not impossible to do it with my fingers, but it requires delicate work and even greater concentration. Doing it while facing someone is absolutely impossible. In fact, it seems that no one has ever attempted to "remove" the enchantment effects before.

The reason I could do this is that I didn't like the effects I had applied before, and I tried various things to see if I could change them.

I wrapped magic power around the magical tool, imagined the characters floating, and then transcribed them. To my surprise, the transcribed characters appeared to float. I then created a staff with the enchantment "Magic Effect Nullification" and tried tracing one of the floating characters, and the character disappeared. When I re-applied the enchantment, it worked again.

My grandma's expression when I showed her this was quite amusing.

The number of characters that can be enchanted on the blazer, shirt, and slacks is twenty each.

What are these made of, anyway? They must be made from some highly specialized material. Is it because of the thread? I've heard that various unique materials can be obtained from monsters, so could it possibly be spider silk from a monster... Ugh, I shouldn't dwell on that.

When I previously created the Protect Suits, regular clothes allowed for up to eight characters, so I could only enchant three effects: "Blade Protection," "Magic Resistance," and "Shock Absorption." Even with that, it was quite practical. However, either due to 'abbreviating' the effects in the inscription or for some other reason, they didn't fully manifest.

So, this time, I replaced "Magic Resistance" with "Absolute Magic Defense,"

"Shock Absorption" and "Blade Protection" were replaced with "Complete Physical Impact Absorption,"

And I retained the original "Stain Resistance."

Additionally, I added "Automatic Healing."

This makes a total of twenty characters.

Enchanting "Absolute Magic Defense" was particularly challenging because I couldn't quite grasp the imagery. Since it's a word that encompasses defense against all types of magic, it had to cover everything. However, the method to defend against "fire" and "water" is different. I couldn't imagine defending against everything, and I failed repeatedly during transcription.

I was quite troubled about what to do.

Seeing me troubled, my grandma looked very concerned.

Finally, I succeeded in transcription with a change in perspective.

The new image was "dispersion of magic power."

I envisioned creating a magical barrier that thinly enveloped the clothing, and when activated magic came into contact with the barrier, the magic power would disperse. Until then, I had imagined a "solid wall," which didn't work. So, instead of "blocking," I thought, why not disperse the very magic power that composed the spell? I tried it, and it worked perfectly. I imagined it to make harmful magic disappear while not affecting healing magic or magic I cast myself.

The moment of success, I shouted loudly.

My grandma rushed over.

"Complete Physical Impact Absorption" is based on the same principle. Rather than imagining something "hard," I pictured "dissipation of kinetic energy," and the enchantment was successfully transcribed. It honestly felt creepy when an object in motion hit this uniform, completely ignoring the laws of physics. It's fantastic as armor, though.

"The Stain Resistance" is designed to remember the clothing's original state and remove anything else adhering to it.

"Automatic Healing" recognizes wounds and damage, activates when they occur, collects cells from other parts of the body, temporarily transforms them into universal cells, and restores the damaged area to its original state.

So when "Automatic Healing" is activated, the body becomes slightly thinner.

By the way, it only works on surgical factors.

At first glance, it may seem like invincible armor, but it has two disadvantages.

One is that it only defends where the "clothing" is present; the face and extremities are unprotected.

The second is that it won't activate unless magic is used in the first place.

The first drawback is mitigated to some extent by "Automatic Healing."

The second drawback is not a big issue since there won't be many situations where you'd be attacked. It'll mostly be during battles.

It won't activate without a considerable amount of magic power, so it won't be active all the time. But it's essential to be careful as taking an unexpected hit can result in damage.

This is the enchantment magic incorporated into this uniform.

My grandma emphasized to me that I must never reveal this to anyone.

Homeroom ended, and when everyone left the classroom today,

"Shin, can I talk to you for a moment?"

Maria called out to me.

"Huh? What is it?"

"Can I talk to you for a moment?"

"Sure..."

Is it that again? Does she want me to introduce her to Grandpa and Grandma?

"I have something to discuss about Sicily."

"Something wrong?"

"Yes, there's a problem."

Maria had a genuinely troubled expression.

Sicily also looked apologetic.

Both of them wearing these expressions; it must be quite a significant issue.

"In fact... there's a guy who's been following Sicily."

"What...?"

What the heck?! Who's that guy?

"Sicily first met him a little while after meeting you. He's been pursuing her persistently, despite Sicily rejecting him multiple times. He even came and threatened her, using the influence of his family."

He's the worst, that guy. But with his family's influence and not getting his way, things might get... complicated.

"Sicily seems to be getting quite upset because things aren't going her way... and she might resort to some reckless measures soon."

...Just as I suspected.

"And, you see... that guy who's been pursuing her... he's here at this academy."

"What!?"

If he's here at the academy, it means there's no moment of rest from what might happen!

Sicily had a truly distressed and apologetic expression.

"I'm sorry, Shin-kun... for burdening you with this."

"What are you talking about? I'm glad you told me!"

"So, I'm really sorry..."

What does she mean? Instead of that, we need to address this situation urgently.

While I was contemplating what to do, someone called out.

"Hey! Sicily! How dare you talk to another guy while you're my fiancée!"

What! Who is this guy?

And Sicily's face twisted in anguish when she heard that voice. Who could possibly make Sicily look like this? I turned to see who was responsible...

It's him again. Kurt.

"That guy. He's been persistently bothering Sicily and falsely claiming to be her fiancé to everyone."

Maria explained to me.

Seeing Sicily, he hastily approached and she hid behind me. Apparently, he didn't like that.

"Sicily! Get over here!"

Kurt reached out to grab Sicily's arm.

I wasn't going to allow that.

I grabbed the hand he extended to Sicily and twisted it behind his back. It felt like déjà vu.

"Argh! Let go, you insolent fool!"

"Huh, you're still saying that?"

I released him because he was being too loud, but he continued to shout.

"Sicily there is my fiancée! You have no right to talk to her!"

"You say that, but is it true?"

"Uh, well..."

Oh, Kurt's voice is really loud, and it seems to have made Sicily shy away.

"Sicily, it's okay. I'll protect you no matter what happens. So, speak your mind."

"S-Shin-kun..."

To reassure Sicily, I said that. She then looked determined and spoke to Kurt.

"I... I've declined your proposal! It's bothersome for you to claim to be my fiancé without my consent!"

In the quiet hallway where we were watching the situation unfold, Sicily's voice rang out. Well done, Sicily.

"You... Do you dare defy me?"

"Yes, I do! I have no intention of obeying you!"

She must be scared, her legs trembling, but she still said what she wanted to. Good job, Sicily.

"You... Do you dare oppose me, a woman defying me? You women should just be by a man's side, entertaining him! Moreover, you dare to resist my offer to have you serve me, don't be so insolent!"

"Who's being insolent?"

What he just said is unacceptable. Women are not tools for men. I felt genuinely angry at this guy for yelling such things.

"You... Will you keep defying me like this?"

"Yeah, I'll keep defying you. You can't just have everything your way and act so arrogantly."

"Ugh, g-g-g-g... ggggh..."

Oh, his face, which was already red, turned even redder. He might burst a blood vessel.

"You're getting too full of yourself, thinking you can say whatever you want... Very well, I'll show you what happens when you defy me."

"What? Threats? Fine, come at me anytime. I'll beat you to a pulp if you do."

"Can you say that? Sicily. I remember that your father was a financial bureau official, right?"

"Yes, but... surely not!"

"That's right. My father is the vice secretary of the financial bureau. If I were to mention it to my father... Well, what do you think would happen?"

Kurt said that with a malicious grin.

This guy is just... the worst!

"Cut it out."

"Y-Your Highness Augustus..."

Just as I was about to explode, Augustus stepped in.

"Kurt von Ritzberg, don't you remember what I told you during the entrance exam?"

"That's... um..."

"Furthermore, attempting to pressure the other party's parents by pleading with your own father is an act unbefitting of a noble of this kingdom."

"..."

Augustus reprimanded Kurt, who hung his head and couldn't say anything.

"I will inform the Ministry of Finance through my father. To ensure you don't take any inappropriate actions."

"What? Is th-that...?"

"This is a decision. There will be no objections. Now, go."

"...Yes... I understand..."

He left this place after glaring at us with eyes filled with even more intense resentment than during the entrance ceremony.

"Thank you, Augustus. I was about to lose my temper."

"Sorry, Your Highness. Thank you very much."

"No need to apologize. I was watching to see what you'd do, but things seemed to be heading in an odd direction, so I had to intervene. Although I was somewhat curious to see what would happen if you lost your temper."

"Hey, return my gratitude!"

You've been watching this whole time! If that's the case, you should have intervened sooner!

"Don't be so angry. I was sure that with you here, there wouldn't be any danger to Claude and Messina."

"Of course, but... What if something happened?"

"Hehe, is that so? Didn't you say, 'Don't worry. I'll protect you no matter what'? It was quite impressive, wasn't it, Claude?"

"Uh, well... it was... impressive..."

"I guess it was. Good for you, Shin."

This guy... really!

Sicily blushed and fidgeted while looking at us with upturned eyes. Oh, come on! She's so cute!

"Hey, do you think everything is fine now?"

Maria asked with a worried expression. Given his behavior, it's hard to feel completely at ease.

I don't know why he thinks he's so special, but people like him probably won't easily accept not getting their way. It's probably still necessary to be cautious.

"Hmm, judging from that look he gave us when he left, I think we still need to be cautious. We shouldn't let our guard down."

"I see... I guess you're right..."

Sicily looked downcast. I need to cheer her up. Maybe I should introduce her to Grandma? Oh, that's it!

"I've thought of something. Can you all come over to my place later?"

"What!? To Shin's house!?"

"Yeah, that's right..."

"I'm going! I'll let my parents know, so let's go just like this!"

"I'm going too! I'll inform my parents as well, so please let me join!"

Both of them answered hesitantly.

Do they really want to meet my grandpa and grandma that badly?

"Well, then, I'll go too. Father will probably visit Shin's house, anyway."

Most likely. I have no doubt about that.

"I'll go too, as I am His Highness's bodyguard."

"I shall accompany you as well."

Ah, Thor and Julius, you were here. I see, you're Augustus's guards. I saw you for the first time today.

"Alright, I'm going to talk to my parents!"

"Wait for us!"

Good, Sicily seems to be in higher spirits now. She dashed off.

"So, what's your idea?"

"Yeah, this uniform has granted magic, right?"

"That's correct."

"I'm thinking of rewriting the granted magic."

Og and the others froze. Oh, they've rebooted.

"...Hold on a second. Did you just say something quite extraordinary?"

"Hmm? Which part?"

"Well... you said 'rewrite' the granted magic."

"That's right. This uniform is made of exceptional fabric. I could grant up to twenty characters."

"You... didn't you come here to learn common sense?"

"That's right?"

"Sigh... I can't keep being surprised all the time."

What's with him? He just wrapped it up on his own. It's still quite intriguing.

Thor and Julius also wear a subtle expression. What's going on?

As we were having this exchange, Sicily and Maria returned. In a full sprint.

"Heavy breathing... ngh... sorry... haa... kept you waiting..."

"Heavy breathing... haah... we're sorry... haa..."

They're completely out of breath. They really went all out, huh?

"You didn't need to rush so much..."

"What are you saying! We can't afford to keep the Sage and the Instructor waiting!"

"That's right!"

Well, we've already made them wait for quite a while.

"You don't need to worry so much... So, shall we go?"

"Yes..."

"Yes!"

And so, the six of us—myself, Sicily, Maria, Og, Thor, and Julius—walked together.

"I'm sorry. You probably wanted to spend time with your families after the entrance ceremony."

"No, don't worry about it. In fact, when I mentioned going to Shin's house, both of them seemed really envious. They told me to come back and tell them all about it."

"Same here."

"I-Is that so?"

These people in this country really have too much respect for my grandpa and grandma!

Grandpa and grandma, along with Mr. Dis, were waiting in the school's guest room, taking precautions against any commotion.

"You were quite late. We were getting worried that something might have happened."

"That's right. What were you up to?"

"Shin, while I was waiting, I couldn't help but worry. I thought you might have gotten into trouble."

Compared to my grandfather and grandmother, who genuinely worried about me, Uncle Dis is so heartless!

"I'm sorry for making you worry. There were some circumstances that made me late."

I turned to look at the two of them, and they were stiff with nervousness.

Well, it's understandable. Two heroes and a king are here. It's impossible not to be nervous.

"These two are classmates, Sicily and Maria."

"Hello! I'm Maria von Messina, Shin's classmate!"

"Um, well, um... h-hello! I'm Sicily von Claude."

They were speaking nervously.

"A beautiful girl with blue hair, huh. So, she's the girl Shin was talking about, right?"

"Shin was talking about me?"

You don't need to say things like that!

"Oh, is that so..."

My grandma's expression changed. She was looking at Sicily as if inspecting her. The conversation wasn't going anywhere!

"Grandma, let's save that for later. We have something to discuss, so let's go home. We can't talk about it here."

"Oh, I see. Does that mean you'll take these young ladies with you?"

"Yeah, both of them... Well, it's actually a discussion about Sicily."

"I see. Well then, we'll take our time hearing it at home."

We put Sicily and Maria in our carriage, and Og, Thor, and Julius rode in Uncle Dis's carriage as we headed home.

Even in the carriage, the two of them were still nervous. Sicily, in particular, was frozen as she was being stared at by my grandma.

Grandma, you're scaring her. Please stop.

After a tense five minutes, we finally arrived home. It's the first time I've felt five minutes be this long...

"So? You wanted to talk about this girl. What is it? Don't tell me you're already..."

"No! It's not like that!"

"Then what is it?"

"Yeah, so, you know the granted magic on this uniform, right?"

"Ah... yeah, that was quite cruel, wasn't it..."

"No, it's not about that... I'm wondering if it's okay to apply that granted magic to her uniform too."

"Let's talk about it in detail."

I explained what happened at the academy today. I also talked about how we're not in a safe situation yet and that I want to strengthen her protection.

"I see, so that's why you were late."

"Diselm."

"Yes, what is it, Lord Merlin?"

"Do we still have people like that among the nobles in this country?"

"No... there shouldn't be. Our country's nobles are undergoing a conscious reform. While there are some who still possess a strong sense of entitlement, Ritzberg, the Undersecretary of the Treasury, is known for being an upright and principled person who despises corruption and pressure. I can't believe his son would get involved in such matters."

"Hmm, so is it the son's misbehavior..."

His father seems like an outstanding person. Or maybe he just didn't know anything about his father? Why did he say something like that?

"Grandma, is it okay?"

"Well, sure... The girl over there, her name is Sicily, right?"

"Yes."

"Shin's granted magic he's talking about is an incredible thing. He's trying to apply it to your uniform. So, does this girl genuinely believe she's qualified to receive your protection? Do you think you have the qualifications to accept that protection?"

"Qualifications?"

The qualifications to accept my protection? I'm not that important, am I?

"Grandma, qualifications... It's not such a big deal. I just want to do it, so there's no need to make it so grand."

"You should be quiet. You see, this granted magic that you applied to this uniform, it's become something extraordinary. She's trying to apply it to your uniform. So, do you think you have the qualifications for that protection?"

"Qualifications..."

What? Are you serious?

"Merida, what's going on?"

"I don't know. This girl has gone wild again. Will that make it clear to you? It has a granted magic that we can't imagine based on our common sense."

"I see... it's scary to hear."

I'm not scared. It's more like it's going to protect me.

"The armor with this granted magic is unimaginably valuable. This girl is trying to apply it to your uniform. Do you have the determination and qualifications to accept it?"

"Well... I wonder if I have those qualifications..."

Sicily was asked, and tears began to well up in her eyes.

Why?

"I don't... I don't have the qualifications... for that..."

She said and began to cry.

"I see, you don't have the qualifications, you say?"

"I... I took advantage of Shin's kindness. I thought if I told Shin about my circumstances, he would sympathize with me and help me... I expected him to help me, so I told him about my situation."

"Well, she's strong, so it's not hard to understand why she'd want to rely on someone."

"But! But... even though it had nothing to do with Shin, he still, as I thought, said he would help me... and protect me... and I was so happy about that... I was hoping that he would keep helping me, even though it was all just my selfish desires..."

Sicily's tears wouldn't stop. I guess when I first heard this story, she had that apologetic look not because she thought it was a "weird story," but because she was hoping that telling the story would make me feel sympathy and help her.

But still, she's telling the truth despite knowing that I might not like it. She can't tell lies, I guess?

"Milady Merida! I apologize for trying to use your grandson! I'll handle the things after this myself. I'm sorry for causing any inconvenience!"

Sicily, while crying, confessed that she tried to use me and attempted to run away.

What are you talking about? She was about to run away in tears, and I tried to chase her...

"Wait!!"

Grandma stopped her.

Startled by her voice, Sicily froze in place.

Her tears still wouldn't stop. She seems to be filled with self-loathing...

"Sicily, you were honest about it, which is good. I immediately realized that you were trying to take advantage of Shin. If you hadn't confessed and tried to accept Shin's granted magic without telling the truth, we would have thrown you out."

"Ugh... h-huh..."

To Sicily's words, tears mixed with sobs. Why is she crying so much?

"But you were honest. You told us that the armor with the granted magic was of national treasure quality. You had the chance to obtain it but chose to give it up yourself. Not everyone can do that."

"Th-that's... h-huh... trying to deceive Shin... deceive him... and yet I can't accept that... h-huh... at all..."

Through her sobbing, it's hard to understand exactly what she's saying, but it seems she's really upset about trying to use me.

"What's wrong with a girl deceiving a guy? What you did was rather cute, you know. Shin, look, he hasn't even noticed. If anything, he's actively participating because he's helping a cute girl, isn't he?"

"I'm sorry! Sicily, I don't feel like I've been deceived or used by you, okay? My intention was to help you. So... don't deny my intention."

"Mmm."

"It's more than fine for you to use me. In fact, I'd regret it more if something happened to you without me knowing your circumstances."

"Sorry for trying something like that. To grant this bestowed armor, I had to confirm your suitability. I'm sorry."

Suddenly, Grandma became very gentle. She hugged Sicily and patted her head.

"Waaah!"

Held in Grandma's arms, Sicily finally broke down in tears.

"Now, Shin, go ahead and bestow the same enchantment on Sicily's uniform."

"Is that okay?"

"Yeah, but Sicily, you must promise not to tell anyone about this. If you can't keep this secret, I won't do it. I want you to at least make that commitment."

"Okay, I won't tell anyone. I promise."

"Good, you're a good girl."

Great, it seems she has finally calmed down. Now I can bestow the enchantment on Sicily's uniform.

However, to bestow it, I need to apply it to the blazer, shirt, and skirt, so she needs to change. Asking a girl to undress is awkward. I was contemplating what to do when Grandma came to the rescue.

"Come, Sicily. To bestow the enchantment, you need to take off your clothes. I'll lend you my clothes, and we'll go to a room."

"Ugh... sniff... okay..."

And Grandma took Sicily to the room.

As I watched them go...

"Now, Shin."

"What is it, Grandpa?"

"I couldn't even tell that girl was trying to use you."

"Same here, Grandpa."

"Merida is the one who noticed..."

"Maybe she's got more experience as a woman?"

"I hadn't noticed it like that..."

So, it was blown out of proportion.

"But more importantly..."

"What is it?"

"Doesn't that old lady have control over this place? I was completely in the dark there."

"Come on, Grandpa..."

"Her authority might be more significant, don't you think? I was just a bystander back there."

"Rather than that..."

"What is it?"

"That old hag, doesn't she hold the reins here? I was left out of the loop."

Hang in there, Grandpa!

"Here, you're going to change soon anyway, so this will do."

Merida handed Sicily a white dress she could easily change into from her own clothes.

"Now, hurry up and change, we've already wasted enough time. Let's get back to everyone."

"I'm sorry..."

Sicily, who was aware that she had wasted time due to her actions, changed her clothes with an apologetic look.

"By the way, you were very honest. If it were my younger days, I'd have definitely kept quiet about the national treasure-class armor."

"I originally wasn't willing to take advantage of Shin's kindness. But I couldn't help it anymore... so when Shin helped me, I was really happy, but also really sorry. I couldn't stand keeping quiet any longer."

"So even though you were feeling that way, receiving the bestowed enchantment was painful for you?"

"Yes."

"I see. You're a good girl, Sicily. I was really rude earlier."

"No, it's because it's about your family. I should be the one apologizing."

"By the way, Sicily?"

"What is it?"

"How do you feel about Shin?"

"What? Eek!"

"I want to ask a good girl like you for something about Shin."

"Wh-what do you want to ask?"

"What do you think? It seems like you're not entirely uninterested."

"Well, I... I'm not sure..."

"Hmm?"

"I don't dislike him at all, absolutely. But when it comes to liking him... I hardly know anything about Shin, just that he's kind, strong, and cool... so I'm not sure."

"That's enough, I suppose..."

"What do you mean?"

"It's nothing. You're done changing. Let's go to everyone."

"Okay!"

While on the way back to everyone with Sicily, Merida made up her mind.

"I want to secure this girl somehow."

Sicily was in Merida's sights.content strategy
