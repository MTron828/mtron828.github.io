"Whew... I'm tired. Really tired..."

Og, who had been listening to various things from me, murmured as he leaned back on the sofa's backrest.

Well, isn't he too tired?

"I never expected to hear such an unbelievable story..."

"Indeed. Originally, it was supposed to be just a sightseeing tour of the ruins..."

Both Og and Thor look exhausted, wondering how things got so complicated.

"Even I never dreamed I would have to tell such a story."

To be honest, my secret was something I intended to take to my grave. I never expected to reveal it in a place like this. And I never imagined it would be accepted so easily. That was the real surprise.

"Anyway, we've heard some very useful information. When we return to Arlside, we'll have a lot of work to do."

"Yes, we need to finalize the signing with Quanlong as soon as possible. But I wonder what's happening right now."

Come to think of it, Navar and the people from the Els tribe are not present here.

Well, that's precisely why I revealed that story. If Navar and the others were here, they would surely be digging for information on what kind of magical artifacts could be made. And there might have been a fierce battle among them over the sales rights...

"Hey, have you all already returned from sightseeing?"

At that moment, Navar showed up in the living room.

Phew, that was a close call. The timing was pretty tight.

"Perfect timing, Lord Navar. Have you heard any updates from Emperor Youkou?"

"Even if you ask what updates, both Shaolin and Leafan aren't here, so I have no idea what's going on."

By the way, I took both of them on a sightseeing tour. So even if there were any messages from Emperor Youkou, I wouldn't know.

"Besides, this is the merchant guild, right? With the resumption of dragon leather trade, there has been a lot of coming and going of merchants. To be honest, I don't know who's arrived."

At that moment, one of the Ming family servants spoke to Shaolin.

"...Can it be overwritten?"

"..."

Ah, that thing from earlier.

"Kyaa!"

I pushed myself onto the bed with my face buried in Shisiri's chest.

"Not yet."

That night, we did a lot of overwriting.

And from the next day onwards, Navar and the others began visiting Emperor Youkou's place every day. During their visits, either Shaolin or Leafan always accompanied them. This meant that only one of them could accompany us when we went out, effectively cutting our chances of going out in half.

So, I decided to do what I had planned to do after returning home in advance.

"Shaolin, can I use the garden?"

"Sure, but what do you intend to do?"

Today, Leafan was accompanying Navar. Since no one else had plans to go out today, Shaolin was at home.

"Well, I have some free time until the signing documents are ready, so I thought I'd do something I had planned to do when I got back."

"Okay, that's fine."

With Shaolin's approval, I went out to the garden.

Mark and Yuri were with me.

"Are you going to dismantle that thing right away?"

"Couldn't you have done it after you got back?"

This is the Min family's garden, not the well-equipped Bean Workshop. It's completely unsuitable for dismantling.

I'm not going to dismantle it here. I just thought that since I have so much free time, I might as well examine it.

"Examine it?"

"Yeah. I want to compare it to my memories of the car and see what the differences are."

"I see."

Since I planned to dismantle it once I got back to the workshop, I thought it might be a good idea to take a look at it beforehand.

After all, I have some free time!

"Um, can I watch too?"

"Sure, you can. I can't guarantee it will be interesting, though."

"That's okay. It might give me some new business ideas."

I see. The Min family is a trading company that deals in dragon leather and dragon leather products. But that doesn't mean they can't explore other business opportunities.

This time, because they specialized in dealing with dragon leather, they were put in a difficult situation when trading it was prohibited.

I think it's a good idea to have multiple business options apart from dragon leather.

Well... we probably can't make a car right away, but it's not a big deal.

"Now, let's start by laying out a sheet in the garden."

I spread a thick cloth sheet made from the extradimensional storage. Ideally, a plastic blue tarp would have been better, but in this world, petroleum isn't being effectively used yet. It's smelly and not suitable for lamp light, so if you happen to dig it up, you'd become a nuisance.

"Now, let's take it out."

I said so and extended the entrance to the extradimensional storage along the sheet, then lifted it up. The car that had been stored there was sitting there.

It was in a pretty shabby condition, almost on the verge of falling apart. I tried to handle it carefully to avoid causing any further damage.

"As skillful as ever."

"Coming from a world without magic, it's amazing that you can do things like this. I wonder how much you practiced?"

I've been doing it almost every day since I was three. My amount of magical practice is unmatched by anyone.

"Now, let's take a closer look."

The ruins had lights on, but it was still somewhat dim since it was underground. However, today, we were under the sun. Things that couldn't be seen in the ruins might become visible here.

We carefully examined the car.

"Hey, is this the suspension?"

"Wow, it's more complex than what Bean Workshop makes."

"That's because it has a really simple structure. You need something like this to support the weight and speed of a car."

"This could be useful for improving the products we're making now."

"But this car? It's really something. I wonder how much time it would take to make one."

Yuri noticed something very interesting.

"If you were to make a copy of this, it would take several years."

"Several years!?"

"Yeah, because we don't make all the parts in one place. Even the suspension Mark just noticed is delivered from a specialized manufacturer, and the brakes too. We gather parts made in different factories to assemble it. If we were to make everything in Bean Workshop alone, it would take that long."

We don't have specialized machinery for this.

"...So, what exactly are we trying to do here?"

"We're just saying it's impossible, but we should be able to make something simpler, right? Anyway, as long as we can make the power source and brakes, we can figure it out from there."

We should take it one step at a time. We can't make a coupe or sedan right away, and we don't even have enough iron.

"Well, we've already made the suspension, so we might as well dismantle it for improvements. As for the most important brakes, we can do that when we get back."

"That sounds right."

"Hmm, we're done."

Dismantling would take time, but we were only checking it. So, we had free time again.

"Sigh... I hoped that maybe we could make it, but this seems more challenging than expected."

For Shaolin, the car we were looking at would probably just appear as a lump of iron. Besides, it was in really bad shape. Trying to develop a car from there without any hints would be impossible, I guess. Shaolin seemed to have given up on the idea of pursuing a new business, so I stored the car back into the extradimensional storage.

"Mmm, we have free time again."

"That's not a bad thing. Let's relax once in a while."

Back in the living room, while sitting on the sofa, Shisiri made tea for us.

"Oh, thanks."

"I'm sorry. Here you go."

"Thanks."

Shisiri, after making tea for Mark and Yuri as well, sat down next to me. Mark and Yuri were sitting on the opposite side of the table.

Our mission is to guard Navar and the others. Today, Alice and Rin are on guard duty. Since it's not like we're on a battlefield, two of them are sufficient.

"Well, even if we say 'relax,' what do we do to relax?"

"Come on, relaxing is just relaxing. You don't have to do anything."

Not doing anything, huh. But after all the things I've been through, not doing anything makes me feel restless. In this lifetime, I have inherited not only my grandma's wealth but also built up a fair amount of wealth myself. However, my tendency to be frugal from my previous life hasn't changed.

"Enough."

As I pondered how to relax, Shisiri closed the gap between us while holding a teacup.

"You should just relax like this, drinking tea."

"I see."

As prompted by Shisiri, I drank the tea she had made.

"Ah..."

We both drank the hot tea and exhaled at the same time.

"Hehe."

Our timing was so synchronized that we ended up looking at each other and laughing.

Ah, so this is what it means to relax.

At that moment, I noticed the gazes of the two people sitting in front of me.

"You two are lovey-dovey as ever."

"It's been three years since we started dating already."

Mark and Yuri were grinning as they looked at us.

"What's the matter? Your relationship with Mark is even longer than ours."

"Yeah, it's true. Yuri's relationship is still in the early stages, so it's the lovey-dovey phase."

They teased us, so we returned the favor.

"Well, we've been together for a long time, so we're more settled."

"It's amazing that you're still lovey-dovey even after so many years."

They aren't fazed at all...!?

"Oh, by the way, you two."

"Hm?"

"What is it?"

Somewhat feeling like we lost, Yuri suddenly spoke as if she had remembered something.

"I think it's not a good idea to push yourself too hard in the house where you're staying."

"!!!?"

What?! No way!?

"Eh? Um, did you hear..."

"My room is right next to yours."

"..."

Upon Yuri's remark, Shisiri and I turned bright red. Meanwhile, Mark, sitting across from us, breathed a sigh of relief with a relieved expression.

"Good thing I used soundproof magical devices..."

I... forgot about that.a content calendar
