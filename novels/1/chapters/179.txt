"Everyone, there's a village ahead! We've arrived in Kuanglong!"

As everyone was admiring the ruins, the pilot raised their voice.

This time, we quickly looked ahead, and gradually the desert gave way to grassland, and scattered wooden houses came into view.

"Ah! That's a village at the border of the desert! We've arrived! We've made it in just two days, amazing!"

Seeing the village, Xiaolin, who had been nervously watching our reactions until now, shouted with such high enthusiasm that it was hard to believe she had been anxious just moments ago.

Well, it's understandable. It took us a year to get here, and now we're back in just two days.

The village was still far away, but it was getting closer, and that's when Xiaolin gave some instructions.

"Excuse me, may we land the airship at the entrance of that village?"

"Yes, understood."

The pilot followed Xiaolin's instructions and landed the airship at the village's entrance.

Why are we landing in a place like this?

Well, it's to avoid causing unnecessary chaos in Kuanglong. Our purpose this time is not invasion but diplomacy. We're here for a diplomatic visit to establish diplomatic relations. If a flying vehicle suddenly appears, the capital city would fall into chaos. So, we planned to send envoys from this village and request permission to dock with the airship.

However, we haven't made any prior arrangements with this village...

The scene outside the window, in one word, is panic.

Well, that's to be expected. A flying ship suddenly appearing would be amazing if anyone stayed calm.

So, first, Xiaolin and Lifan disembarked from the airship and began talking to the villagers. Some of them seemed a bit tense, but they quickly started talking as if they remembered Xiaolin's visit about two years ago.

They probably pointed at us occasionally, asking questions like, "What's that?" I assume.

After a while, Xiaolin returned to the airship.

"We've arranged a meeting with the village representatives. Your Highness, Mr. Naval, would you like to come along?"

"I see, understood."

"Well then, shall we go?"

"Yes, please. Thank you."

With preparations made in the village to hear our discussions, Oug, Mr. Naval, and their escorts went to the village. During this time, the rest of us waited inside the airship.

We deployed reconnaissance magic just in case, but it seemed no one here had any hostile intentions.

Xiaolin translated the words of Oug and Mr. Naval as they spoke with the village representatives. After a while, Oug and the others returned.

"You must be tired. Can we go now?"

"No, not yet. They're sending a request to Kuanglong's capital now. We'll have to wait for their response."

"Eh? How long will that take?"

I asked Oug, but Xiaolin, who had been listening, answered.

"If we estimate one week for the journey there and one week for the return journey, it will take about two weeks."

"It's quite far, isn't it?"

"Yes, Kuanglong is a nation formed by integrating small countries, so its territory is quite extensive."

I see, a nation formed by integrating smaller countries, in other words, an empire.

I wonder why I always associate empires with being the bad guys. But in reality, the Bluesphere Empire was indeed a very sinister nation. Without that country, the Demon Lord might not have appeared.

In any case, two weeks...

"What should we do, Oug?"

"Well, for now, let's try to interact with the residents here. We don't have enough time to learn their language, but we can at least get a glimpse of their culture."

"That sounds like a good idea."

So, we decided to stay in this village for two weeks. However, there were no inns in this remote village, so we had to obtain permission to camp on the outskirts of the village and set up tents. Of course, we didn't forget to place lookouts and defensive magical tools at both the airship and our camp.

Xiaolin explained that we were a foreign diplomatic delegation, but the delegation was composed mostly of middle-aged men, and we had six young women with us, all foreign beauties. It was possible that some people might have inappropriate thoughts, so the women were escorted by Xiaolin, while the men were accompanied by Lifan as we engaged with the villagers.

The purpose was to get accustomed to Kuanglong's food, learn their customs, and engage in cultural exchange with the village.

While we were busy interacting with the village, the men from the village kept their gaze fixed on the women in our group. Some even attempted to approach the tents a few times, but it didn't escalate into a major problem.

No, the fact that they were trying to approach was odd in itself. It seemed like they didn't quite understand the concept of a foreign diplomatic delegation.

After slightly over two weeks, one day, a villager came running out of breath. According to Xiaolin, it seemed that government officials from the capital had finally arrived. Well, they probably didn't leave the capital right after receiving our message and must have had discussions before sending the officials.

However, what came were not just officials but also armed soldiers.

"ーーーーーーーーーーー!!"

They were shouting something in the Kuanglong language. We didn't understand what they were saying, but Xiaolin had a stunned expression and was desperately speaking to the officials.

The official, after muttering something while looking at Xiaolin, signaled to the soldiers standing behind him. The soldiers then simultaneously released arrows in our direction.

"Lord Shin! Please, run!!"

That's what Xiaolin was desperately shouting, but... Come on, seriously?

We are a foreign diplomatic delegation, you know? Is this the right attitude for a country to have?

That thought crossed my mind, but judging from the atmosphere of the approaching soldiers, it was clear that we were not welcome. Ever since Xiaolin's incident, we hadn't let our guard down, and this was something we had been prepared for.

I deployed both physical and magical barriers against the arrows that were coming. Why, you ask? It's because the arrows the soldiers were using had the same kind of charms attached to them that Xiaolin had shown me. I had a feeling they would trigger something upon hitting their target, so I put up a double barrier. The result was a great success. The arrows, blocked by the barriers, exploded right on the spot, covering the area in smoke. Since our visibility was now obscured, I activated reconnaissance magic, but the soldiers did not show any sign of movement.

Huh?

Isn't this the perfect time to attack?

I wondered what they were doing, but as the smoke cleared, I understood. The soldiers seemed to have thought we were dead.

The first thing I saw was a soldier with a faint smile and Xiaolin, her face filled with despair. Then, the soldier's face turned to shock when he saw that we were safe, while Xiaolin appeared happy.

What's going on with these people?

"Hey, Mr. Naval."

"Yes?"

"What should we do in this situation?"

"It's quite obvious," Mr. Naval replied with a wicked grin. "They've treated us like this despite us coming here for friendly dialogue. So, it's perfectly fine to subdue these guys for self-defense. In fact, we've gained some good cards for negotiations."

Oh dear, we've shown our vulnerability to the Els merchants. Well, we have approval from the head of the diplomatic delegation, so shall we counterattack?

"Let's go! Teach these rude folks some manners!"

"Yes!"

Under Oug's command, all the Ultimate Magicians rushed at the still astonished soldiers.

To be honest, it didn't even turn into a battle. We swiftly subdued them, no casualties, and everyone was restrained. Then we called Xiaolin.

"I'm so sorry! I never dreamt of such a rash act..."

She approached us, her face pale, and bowed deeply. There was no need for prostration this time.

Then, Xiaolin explained the contents of the message the official had been shouting earlier. It said:

"I shall confiscate this flying ship! No objections allowed!"

What? Is this country for real?

Are they in their right mind?

As I pondered these questions while looking down at the bound officials, Xiaolin started searching through their clothes. After a while, she exclaimed, "Ah, here it is!"

She found some documents and began to read them.

The contents were...

"Your Highness, Mr. Naval, it seems that this attack was the unilateral decision of these officials."

She also shared the contents of the letter.

The content of the letter was as follows: "We appreciate the offer to establish new diplomatic relations with a neighboring nation. Therefore, we have no objections to you boarding the flying ship to the capital. We await your arrival."

Wait a minute, if that's true, is this official really that much of a fool? The government asked us to bring the airship to the capital, and now he wants to claim it as his own. Unbelievable.

I was thinking along those lines, but...

"As despicable as ever," Xiaolin was more furious than us.

Us? We were more incredulous than angry, and I even considered whether this letter might be a fake or a trap. But Xiaolin seemed to have a precise grasp of the situation.

"This country has a long history of using this tactic. They always give the officials a proper letter for negotiations. However..."

Xiaolin looked at the official as if he were a piece of filth.

"The officials are not particularly restricted in making on-the-spot judgments. For example, in this case, the official decided unilaterally to seize the airship, eliminate all evidence... essentially, commit mass murder."

"And even if that fails, they can claim they delivered the letter, and it was the decision of the on-site official, so we're not responsible?"

"That's the idea."

Ah, Oug's expression also changed to that of looking at the official as if he were filth, just like Xiaolin.

Well, well, is it really possible to establish diplomatic relations with this country from the beginning like this?

Thinking that, I looked at Oug and Mr. Naval...

"Well, this is quite something."

"Indeed, we're being quite underestimated. This makes my blood boil; it's been a while."

Both of them had wicked expressions. a fun fact
