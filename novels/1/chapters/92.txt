The day after the birthday party, which had been a big fuss in many ways.

The hall used for the party had been thoroughly cleaned by Mariica-san and the other maids.

As always, our servants are of a high caliber.

And since many people stayed over after getting drunk yesterday, they were busy preparing breakfast for them from the morning.

I should do something for these people who always help us.

I thought about it while sitting on the living room sofa and watching the maids work.

"Shin-kun, what's wrong?"

As I was staring absentmindedly like that, Sisily sitting next to me spoke up.

"Huh? Oh, well, I'm always grateful to Mariica-san and the others, so I was thinking if there's something comforting I can do for them."

I said what I was thinking, and suddenly Sisily slumped against me.

"You really care about everyone. Kind Shin-kun... I love you."

She said that and nuzzled her head against my chest.

She's so cute! Hey!

When I was about to give in to Sisily's affectionate behavior...

"Wait... what's with this sweet atmosphere?"

"My teeth are about to float."

"Oh my, it's grown-up matters!"

Maria, Ellie, and Mei-chan, who had stayed at our place, woke up.

"Oh, good morning."

"...Sisily doesn't seem to be flustered..."

"Oh, could it be?"

"Huh?"

Seeing Sisily greeting nonchalantly, Maria and Ellie seemed to have noticed something.

Mei-chan's reaction, on the other hand, seemed to be based on what she observed from the sofa's cuddling.

But seriously, why does a ten-year-old know the word "grown-up matters"?

"Is that so...? Should we congratulate them?"

"Huh? Did something happen?"

I felt a bit heartened by Mei-chan's innocence.

"What are you doing this early in the morning?"

"Good...morning! Shin-kun and Sisily are sticking to each other even more than usual!"

Og and Alice also woke up and appeared in the living room.

"Good morning."

What is this person doing!? Certainly, if the gate were usable, one could sneak out quietly.

Or rather...

"So, you went to Ekaterina's private room, Grandpa?"

"Yes. Back when I was traveling, I also visited Ees, and my status as your teacher and mentor is fairly well-known there."

"I see."

"We contacted Dee through the communication device shortly after you guys exterminated the demon, and we asked my mentors to come. I guided them to the room at that time."

"When did that happen?"

So that's why Grandpa and Grandma frequently left home after we returned to the capital.

"But why did you call them? Did you have some business with them?"

"No, not at all. I just wanted them to listen to my complaints and share some of my worries."

"...Uncle Dis has also been coming to the remote house to complain... Is it a trend for the heads of state to go to Grandpa and Grandma to vent their frustrations?"

"Both Dee and Aaron are like that, too. Once you become the nation's leader, you can't afford to show weakness. It can be used against you. That's why, with my mentors, I can easily confide in them."

Words can really be troublesome in real life. They must have a lot of pent-up complaints and frustrations.

"Ah, you're awake."

"Good morning. Are you okay?"

"Oh, Sensei, Mentor. Good morning."

As I talked to Ekaterina, Grandpa and Grandma woke up.

By the way, I've been curious about this for a while, but is Sensei referring to Grandpa?

"Grandpa, you're called Sensei, huh? Weren't you bad at teaching others back in the day?"

"This child is just calling me that on her own."

"Watching him was educational enough. There's no doubt he's a sensei."

She must have absorbed a lot just by watching him. She's known as the Holy Maiden and even rose to the position of Pope. She must be a genius too.

"Now, shall we return soon?"

"Yes, please."

"Well then, let's go."

Saying that, Grandpa opened the gate.

Ekaterina, who had been facing the gate, turned back towards us.

"Then, everyone, until we meet again at the wedding. Stay well until then."

"Yes! Stay well, Your Holiness!"

Everyone bowed respectfully and thanked Ekaterina.

"We look forward to the next time we meet."

"Hehe. Well then, goodbye."

With a light wink directed at us, Ekaterina passed through the gate and returned to her room in Ees.

Although I wasn't particularly nervous, it seemed like everyone else had finally relaxed.

"But seriously, why be so nervous?"

"You're too unique. She's the head of the world's only religion. Just being able to meet her is fortunate enough."

"I never thought I'd actually call her by her name."

Even royal family members like Og rarely get to meet her. But Dis mentioned that he's Ekaterina's senior disciple, so maybe if he wanted to, he could meet her?

As for the name-calling Ellie mentioned, it's because they were both Grandpa and Grandma's former disciples, and it made me feel a sudden closeness to her. I'm their grandchild, but I felt a bit like an older brother or sister to her.

"Are you for real...? You're even unconventional when it comes to relationships. What's wrong with you?"

"It's Grandpa and Grandma's fault! It is!"

It's not my fault when it comes to relationships!

As we were arguing about this, we heard footsteps coming down from upstairs.

"Ah... my head hurts..."

"Hey... Ani-san, don't shake..."

Both senior disciples appeared unsteadily.

In this moment, they seemed to have lost the dignity of being Grandpa's and Grandma's senior disciples, or even the heads of state.

"Oh? Has Katze already gone back?"

"She just returned. Do Uncle Dis and Uncle Aaron need to leave?"

"For me, the Wolfram family is like a second home. Nobody's really worried about it."

"I'm not going back. I brought Katze in front of my wife using the gate just now, so I don't think she'll suspect anything. But this and that are different matters..."

"There's a man here who can't defy his wife..."

I've never met someone so submissive to their spouse before. Maybe there's no other choice...

"Uncle Ani, huh?"

"Well, it's not like comparing him to Merlin-dono is fair... He's up against Lady Merida, after all."

"Yeah, he can't win against her."

The two uncles were laughing happily, but I wasn't in the mood for that.

After all, I just went to see them off using the gate.

There was no reason to stay.

In other words...

"Hmm? You guys seem to be having a good conversation, aren't you?"

"Huh?! Sensei?!"

"Me, Merida-sensei?! Weren't you supposed to go to send Katze?"

A gate opened behind the two of them, and there was Grandma.

Naturally, she must have overheard the previous conversation.

"It seems like being in power for too long has made you arrogant. I guess I'll have to teach you a lesson and help you rediscover your humility?"

"What!?"

"T-That's...!"

The two heads of state were crushed by despair.

I guess Grandma really is the strongest in the world...

In the end, Uncle Dis and President Aaron were made to sit seiza in the living room and were lectured continuously until Julia and the others who had stayed the night woke up. By the time breakfast was ready, both of them looked exhausted.

In the end, Aaron, who said he wouldn't have breakfast at home because his wife would nag him, left without having breakfast, while staggering due to the hangover and the lecture.

And while watching Aaron's condition like that, I remembered something.

"Oh."

"Shin-kun, what's wrong?"

I inadvertently blurted out, and Sisily asked me what was wrong.

"I should have lent Ekaterina and Aaron that pendant."

"Huh? Oh, right. They seemed to be having a hard time with their hangovers."

"Hangovers probably occur when there's still alcohol in your system, right? In reality, we only got a bit tipsy."

"Thanks to the pendant's effect, they might have been able to cure their hangovers."

Yes, the pendant we usually wear grants the "foreign object elimination" effect, so if I had lent it to Ekaterina and Aaron, they might have been able to cure their hangovers before their official duties.

"I feel bad about it."

"No need to worry about that. It's their own doing. You reap what you sow. They might learn from this a bit."

As I was saying that, Grandma, who didn't accompany Aaron when he left, added, "You don't need to dwell on it."

To make us learn from our painful experiences, huh?

Grandma is still as unrelenting as ever.

I was told not to worry about what I thought was a failure, and in the end, everyone who stayed the night had breakfast together. The large table we usually only use for the three of us was filled with people today, as if it were fulfilling its intended purpose.

But when you think about it, from an outsider's perspective, this is quite an unusual scene, right? Royals, nobles, and commoners all having breakfast together at the same table â€“ a combination that's unimaginable anywhere else but here. The royal and noble factions don't seem to mind, but Alice and his son, who are commoners, looked very uncomfortable.

But it would be cruel to separate only those two.

Well, they'll get used to it eventually.

While I was lost in thought like that, did that happen because I was lost in thought while eating?

"Shin-kun."

"Hmm?"

"On your cheek..."

"Huh? Oh."

Maybe I got some food on my cheek. She gently brushed my cheek, and Sisily gave me a little smile and reached out to pick up the food debris from my cheek and brought it to her mouth.

"It's right here."

After picking it up, she placed the food from my cheek in her mouth.

"You shouldn't be lost in thought while eating."

"Right, I'm sorry."

We were just having such a casual exchange, but for some reason, I felt a strange gaze.

The conversation had stopped, and what's going on?

"That casual exchange just now..."

"I see. So that's it, isn't it?"

"That's right. Shin has grown up."

"Huh?"

"Yes?"

Maria and Ellie seemed to have come to some realization, and Grandma muttered with a touch of emotion.

Sisily and I didn't understand what they had figured out. What? What did they understand?

"I see, I see. It seems that we absolutely need to bring this situation to a swift conclusion for the sake of you two who have grown up."

"Please do your best. You."

Wait, everyone suddenly seems so motivated, and Julia is supporting Uncle.

"Um... what is everyone talking about?"

"They're probably thinking that they should have a wedding ceremony soon for the two of you who have grown up."

"Oh, that's what they're talking about..."

"Eh?!"

They found out, huh...

"Ah, ah, Shin and Sisily's intimate time!"

Whoa, Alice! Don't use such direct words! It's embarrassing, you know!

Well, it seems like everyone is now aware of what happened, and I'm receiving rather warm looks. Sisily is blushing intensely and can't even raise her face. My face is probably as red as hers. It's so embarrassing!

"Huh? Did something happen?"

Among all this, May-chan, who was the only one not understanding anything, couldn't be happier.

And so, the embarrassing breakfast ended, and the people who stayed over all went back to their own homes, leaving only me and Sisily at home. It's back to our usual daily life.

As such, the commotion from yesterday has quieted down completely in our home, and Grandpa, Grandma, Sisily, and I are sitting on the living room sofa. The reason is that we were told by Grandpa and Grandma that they had something to discuss with us.

I wonder what it is. Maybe it's too early? We sit in front of them, nervously awaiting what they have to say, worried we might get scolded.

However, something seems strange. Grandpa and Grandma, although looking quite serious, are having a hard time speaking up.

Did it really go that badly?

Just as I was thinking that:

"In truth... there's something we haven't told you yet."

"Something you haven't told me? Is it about your former disciple?"

"Well, it's something similar."

So, it's about something from the past. I remember hearing something about defeating demons a long time ago, but I never imagined being treated like a hero or knew the details. Is it about that?

I had this suspicion, but...

"Shin, didn't you find it strange? We used to be married. So... didn't you wonder if we had children?"

"Well, I did."

Certainly, I wondered. However, I know that there are couples who desperately want children but can't conceive. So, I assumed Grandpa and Grandma were one of those couples. But from their tone, does it mean something else?

"Yesterday, you heard about the girl... Ekaterina having a boyfriend, right?"

"Yeah."

"Well, that boyfriend is... our son, and his name is Slaine."

As I thought... it's like that. But if that's the case...

"From Ekaterina's words last night, you should understand. Slaine is no longer with us; he passed away."

"I see... that's..."

As a parent, I can only imagine how painful it must be to outlive your child. I've never been a parent in this life or my past life, so I don't really know. But I can imagine how tough it must be.

"...That was hard for you, Grandpa, Grandma."

"Shin..."

"You fool! You shouldn't say things like that!"

Perhaps it triggered their memories because tears welled up in their eyes. I understand why they wouldn't want to talk about it. Reminiscing about painful memories is hard.

"Grandpa, Grandma, you don't have to talk about it if it's too painful."

"No, we're family. We have to know everything that happened within our family."

"We've been silent all this time, but Ekaterina has made me realize that we shouldn't keep secrets from our family."

I see... they're family. I'm relieved that they've chosen to share this with us. However, it's tough to hear about their painful experiences.

"All right. I'll listen. Please tell us."

"Grandfather, Grandmother, I'd like to hear too. Please tell us."

"Yes, indeed. Slaine was born a few years before we defeated the demons."

"He was a spirited boy... in a different way than you, Shin."

They look back with gentle expressions. These are memories from a happier time.

"Back then, I worked as a demon hunter. Until Slaine was born, I worked alongside Merida."

"After I gave birth to our child, Merlin went demon hunting on his own... and often returned with ruined materials."

"Huh? Is that so?"

"Hehe... in the past, I wasn't very skilled with delicate magic."

"Despite needing money to raise Slaine, he would always go on a rampage."

"It's fine to talk about that now, isn't it? It's Slaine's story."

"Yeah, that's right."

I'm curious about Grandpa's younger days, but for now, let's focus on Slaine's story.

"Well, raising Slaine required money for many things. I also developed my own magical tools to earn a living."

"Making magical tools that benefited commoners... she earned more than me."

"Maybe it was because we spent so much time together. She had a knack for magic, but she leaned more towards being a magical tool craftsman."

"Huh, that's unexpected."

I was groomed into being a mage, wasn't I?

"One day, the incident with those demons happened. I had grown tired of being celebrated as a hero after defeating the demons."

We decided that when Slaine grew up, we'd leave the capital for a journey. During that journey...

"Ekaterina, a newly-appointed shrine maiden, joined us. She and Slaine were the same age, and they got along quickly, not taking much time to become a couple."

Around the age of fifteen or sixteen, like Shin and Shishiryu. Shishiryu also seemed to have felt the same because she was holding my hand. Her grip wasn't a sign of dependence but rather slight trembling. It seemed she anticipated the impending tragedy.

"During our journey, we rescued Aaron, who was under attack by monsters. He decided to stay with us, and it's been four years since."

So, that completed their party. Four years had passed since they became a couple.

"Were they married?"

The question was answered by Grandma's next words.

"They were supposed to get married when Slaine celebrated his twentieth birthday."

At twenty. That's about the age many people get married. They must have been waiting until then.

"But then... just before his birthday, they received shocking news."

"Shocking news?"

"Yeah... it was about a dragon turning into a monster."

"A dragon?"

"Wh-what?! Really!?"

A dragon? Weren't those mythical creatures, not real?

"Wait, a dragon? Do they actually exist?"

"Huh? Oh, Shin, you don't know?"

"There are herbivorous dragons, carnivorous dragons, and lizard-like creatures, even if they haven't turned into monsters. They have bodies several meters long."

Herbivorous dragons, carnivorous dragons, and lizards...

"Dinosaurs, you mean!?"

"Dinosaurs?"

"What are you talking about? Dinosaurs are different."

"Oh, I see. So, those creatures exist."

Geez, I blurted out something odd without thinking.

More importantly, dinosaurs have survived?

"Dragons are valuable because their hide is a high-quality material. Even if they aren't monsters, people who've learned magic would overhunt them, leading to a decrease in their numbers. They are conserved in a certain region."

"Larger creatures are believed to have a lower likelihood of becoming monsters, especially if they're intelligent."

"People become monsters, and even large creatures like dragons turned into monsters."

"Well, there have been very few instances of dragons turning into monsters in historical records, and it's not something that actually happens."

"But an event that rarely happens did occur. We received a request to subdue them."

That makes sense. By then, they were already celebrated heroes for defeating the demons. Grandpa and Grandma were probably expected to handle this.

"We did indeed subdue the monster dragons. However..."

"...During that battle, Slaine protected Ekaterina..."

"Enough! You don't need to talk about it!"

The expressions on their faces quickly turned pained.

There was no need for them to explain how their son had passed away.

Thinking that, I interrupted their conversation.

After a while, they resumed talking.

"Ekaterina was devastated and depressed to an extreme extent. Somehow, she held herself together without breaking... she might still be holding it in. The fact that she's stayed single until now is a testament to that."

"...We've also been suffering from the loss of Slaine... how can someone who couldn't protect their own son be called a hero? I quit being a hunter."

"Slaine's death changed our relationship. Both Merida and I regret not being able to protect our son. We blamed ourselves for not being able to save him."

"Continuing our married life in that state was painful... so we got a divorce."

I see...

I had a feeling something was going on, but I never expected such a heavy story.

"Several years later, that's when we found Shin."

I couldn't feel any trace of that painful past. They must have been careful not to show it to me, even a hint of it...

"We found Shin under what can only be described as a miraculous circumstance. We had no idea about his background. A baby was in my arms. I took it as destiny. This time, I was determined to raise this child and not let him die."

"I see..."

"...Is that so? But, you taught Shin magic like crazy. Although I can't deny that he has an incredible memory... deep down, you wanted Shin to become strong enough so that no one could harm him."

"And this is the result..."

Huh?

When did the conversation shift to me? Grandma is sighing about me. How did it turn out like this!?

"Um... can I ask a question?"

"Sure, what's your question?"

Curious about why the conversation was directed toward me, Sicily asked a question.

What is it?

"Normally, when someone finds a child, they become the child's foster parent, meaning you'd become Shin's adoptive father. Why did you decide to raise him as your grandson instead?"

"Oh, right. I never thought about it because Grandpa was always Grandpa."

Then, Grandpa responded with a wry smile.

"If Slaine and Ekaterina had married and had children, we probably would have had a grandchild about Shin's age... I believe that's what we thought."

"...I never questioned it either. I took it for granted that I had a grandson. I see... Is that how I felt all along?"

From the beginning, I was raised as a "grandson" because it would have been reasonable to have a grandchild my age if nothing had happened. So, that's why I was raised as a "grandson."

The "grandson" of the hero and the sage, that's what they call me. But I never knew there was such a sad story behind it...

"By the way, do you remember Ekaterina getting drunk yesterday and asking you to call her 'Mom'?"

"Yeah... She said something pretty outrageous, huh?"

"I assume it's a similar reason."

"Huh?"

"Originally, I should have been your and Merida's grandchild. That's because Ekaterina should have given birth to me."

"Oh..."

"She said, 'I'm your master's grandchild, so it should be fine if I'm your child,' when she was drunk."

I see... So Ekaterina felt that way too, huh... She didn't say that out of loneliness for being single.

"Should I still call her 'Mom'?"

"That wouldn't be a good idea."

"Don't say that?"

"Why not?"

"You're the one being referred to as God's messenger. If you start calling the Pope 'Mom,' it will cause a huge commotion, right?"

"Oh, I see. I guess I'll refrain from that."

That was close. I almost did something reckless out of sentimentality.

"I'll say this though. It's true that Slaine and Ekaterina couldn't have children, which is a shame. But we've never thought of Shin as a substitute."

"That's right. Shin is Shin. We've never mistaken that."

"Grandpa... Grandma..."

Perhaps because we talked about their own child and a non-blood-related grandson, they immediately offered me reassurance.

I get it, Grandpa and Grandma.

To me, you've always been Grandpa and Grandma.

"Children like Shin can't be found anywhere in the world."

"Ho ho. That's right."

"Well, yes..."

Even though I was just getting moved, I messed it up!trip
