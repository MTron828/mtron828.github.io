One spring day,

I woke up, got dressed, and when I came downstairs to the living room, I saw the following scene:

"Here, aah."

"Aah."

"Silver, is it delicious?"

"Delicious!"

"Hehe."

Married and now my wife, Sicily, was feeding breakfast to Sylvester... Silver, the child of the demon Millia and Strom.

Sicily had a loving expression on her face, like a saint, while Silver was eating breakfast with a radiant smile.

The scene was so precious and beautiful.

As I watched this heartwarming scene with admiration, Sicily, who sensed my presence, turned towards me.

"Oh, Shin, good morning."

"Yeah, good morning, Sicily."

Even after we got married, Sicily continued to call me 'Shin-kun' when addressing me.

This was her wish, she had told me that even after we got married, she wanted to call me by my name when it's just the two of us.

"Papa!"

Silver, who had noticed me, energetically called me 'Papa.'

"Good morning, Silver. Is Mama's breakfast delicious?"

"Yes!"

"Is that so? Then Papa will have some of Mama's breakfast too."

"Yes, I'll prepare Papa's breakfast right away."

"Yeah, thank you."

Sicily, who softly smiled at my words, headed to the kitchen to prepare breakfast.

When Silver joined our family, it became natural for us to call each other 'Papa' and 'Mama.'

After the battles with Strom and the others, we were able to enjoy such peaceful everyday life.

With mixed emotions about that, I watched Silver eating breakfast on his own, holding a spoon, as Sicily was no longer beside him.

"Oh, Silver, look, you got some food on your face."

"Huh?"

He had learned to eat on his own, but Silver was still not very skilled, leaving his face covered in food. I wiped it off with a towel.

"There you go, all clean."

I said, releasing the towel from his mouth.

"Giggle."

Whether it was because he found it ticklish or he simply enjoyed having his face wiped, Silver flashed a cute smile.

"So, adorable... our child is so adorable..."

"Huh?"

"Hehe, Shin-kun, you're quite something."

As I was overwhelmed by Silver's cuteness, Sicily returned. Behind her, there was the head maid, Marika, and other maids pushing a wagon with breakfast on it.

With their help, breakfast was ready, and Sicily and I also had breakfast.

The three of us had a peaceful breakfast together.

What a happy time it was.

While I was thinking that, I noticed that Sicily was looking at Silver with a complex expression on her face.

"What's wrong, Sicily?"

"Well, at first, I was really worried. Suddenly having to raise a baby, I wondered if I could do it properly."

"...Yeah, I felt the same way. I was honestly anxious."

"But with the help of Grandma and Marika-san, it was tough, but I'm really glad I took it on."

"I see."

"And also..."

Sicily said, then gently stroked Silver's head while he was earnestly eating.

"Silver is such a good child... I feel sorry for Millia-san, but I really feel happy..."

Sicily said this and her expression became somewhat sad.

"I see."

That's all I could say.

Millia, who gave birth to Silver, was no longer in this world.

Sicily is raising Silver in place of Millia, and she feels a little guilty for feeling happy.

Certainly, Millia couldn't have raised Silver.

But...

"It's okay."

"Shin-kun?"

"Millia entrusted Silver to you, Sicily. And you're taking good care of Silver. I'm sure Millia is happy too."

After saying that to Sicily, I addressed Silver.

"Silver, do you like Mama?"

When I asked, Silver replied with a beaming smile.

"I like her!"

"I see."

"Shin-kun..."

"What? Silver can feel that Sicily is taking good care of him. So, you don't need to worry about such things."

"Yes, you're right."

Finally, Sicily's smile returned.

At that moment, I decided to ask a question.

"What about Papa?"

Silver, perhaps excited by the previous question, raised both of his hands this time, still holding the spoon.

"I like Papa!"

With enthusiasm, Silver raised his hands, but the spoon he was holding hit the plate and overturned.

"Ahh!"

Instinctively, I picked up Silver, and Sicily wiped away the spilled food from him. The maids were cleaning up the table.

"Are you okay, Silver?"

"Did you get hurt?"

Both Sicily and I asked Silver, but he seemed to be shocked by spilling his food, and tears welled up in his eyes.

"Uuu... noooo!"

And finally, he burst into tears.

"There, there, it's okay."

"It's alright, Silver, there's more food."

"Waaah!"

A child once upset is not easy to calm down.

Sicily and I were at a loss, but then we heard the voice of our savior.

"Goodness, what's all this commotion so early in the morning?"

"Granny!"

"Grandma!"

We were relieved when Grandma appeared because...

"Granny!"

Silver, who had been crying as if his world had ended just a moment ago, suddenly stopped crying and smiled at Grandma.

Even though we were married, our status was that of students. We had to attend school during the day. Despite being married and having a child, Grandma wouldn't allow us to drop out, believing that we still had much to learn.

... To this day, Grandma doesn't consider us to have gained enough common sense.

As a result, Silver was taken care of by Grandma and Grandpa during the day, as they spent much more time with him than we did.

For this reason, Silver had become quite attached to his grandparents.

"Come here, Silver."

"Yes!"

"Oh!"

When Grandma took Silver from us, he looked a bit dejected. But then Grandpa, who had appeared behind Grandma, spoke to us.

"Hey, you two, is it okay to be so relaxed?"

"Huh?"

"Oh!"

Grandpa's words made me check the time.

Oh no! Is it already this late?

"Today is your graduation ceremony, isn't it? If the representative of the graduating class were to be late, it would be a problem, you know?"

"We'll join you later, so you go ahead first."

"Okay, understood. Let's go, Sicily."

"Yes!"

"Alright, Silver. Say 'see you later' to Mom and Dad."

"Yes!"

"Hehe, Silver is so adorable."

On this bustling morning, it was our graduation day.

Finally, the day when our student life would come to an end.
