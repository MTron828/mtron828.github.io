I'm not sure about the exact context of the text, but here's a translation to English:

"To hear feedback directly from the readers of that book about me... What a torture!"

"Hmph... Hehehe."

Just as I thought that, I heard laughter from behind.

It seems that Aug is back.

Upon closer inspection, even Mark, who returned with me, and Tony, who returned with Aug, are shaking their shoulders in laughter.

You guys...

"Arenas, please spare me the rest. Shin is embarrassed about the book that's about him."

"Is that so?"

Catalina-san tilts her head in genuine curiosity.

Why can't you understand this embarrassment...

"By the way, how did we get into this conversation?"

"Oh... Well, I was asking Catalina-san about the book she was reading."

"I see. What's the story about?"

Aug also seemed interested, and when he asked Catalina-san, she suddenly became tongue-tied.

"Well... um..."

"What's the matter? Is it a book with difficult content to talk about?"

"No! It's just a normal romance novel!"

It seems not.

"Then why are you having trouble speaking about it?"

"Just now, you seemed willing to talk about the content normally, didn't you? Is it difficult to talk to Aug about it?"

"Well, this is, after all, a fictional story from a fictional country."

When Aug and I pressed further, Catalina-san emphasized this before telling us the content.

"It's a story about a common girl who falls in love with a prince she met in secret while visiting the town..."

Huh?

As a story, that sounds like a typical setup.

Why is it difficult for her to talk to Aug about it?

"...What's so hard to talk about in that?"

"Well, you see..."

As if speaking for my feelings, Aug asked, and Catalina-san looked around nervously before starting to speak resignedly.

"The prince has a fiancée determined through political arrangements. He doesn't like the woman he's engaged to... and he's in love with the queen, so he finds it hard to talk to her Highness..."

Ah, I see.

It's well-known that Aug values Ellie, who is the queen.

After graduating from the academy, Ellie's pregnancy was announced immediately, so it's widely known among the citizens that the Crown Prince deeply loves the Crown Princess. I heard it from someone I met at my request, so there's no mistake.

It must have been difficult for Aug to share a story about a prince who doesn't like his fiancée.

However, the main person himself seems puzzled, not quite understanding the content.

"Why is it difficult to talk about?"

"Huh? Because it's a story about a prince who disregards his fiancée. The fiancée in this story has a terrible personality, and I'm worried that it might offend you..."

Catalina-san also explains with a puzzled expression, saying, "Huh? Why?"

...Ah, this might be due to cultural differences.

"Um, Catalina-san. Is it possible that in Sweden, political marriages among nobility and royalty are common?"

"Yes, not just in Sweden, but everyone around us too."

Catalina-san said this and looked around the office.

The office workers seemed to have been listening, and Kwang-Long's Min Xiao-Lin, Karan's Ian Corrie, and Kurt's Henri Montreux nodded.

"We don't have a nobility system, so that's not very common for us."

That's Els's Kartas Zenis.

Els has a presidential system.

There is no social class system, and everyone is a commoner.

Natascha from Ees is in Sicily and staying at my house, so she's not here.

That leaves only one person.

It's Alma.

"Um... I'm sorry. We don't really have that now..."

Alma said that and looked down.

Upon hearing those words, Aug's expression turned slightly stern.

"Don't really have that, huh? I heard that you used to work in government offices before being assigned here, didn't you?"

Aug's tone was more of an interrogation than a question.

As a dispatched personnel from the politically unstable Darm, they're keeping a close eye on Alma's movements.

In fact, it seems they've assigned a few spies to keep an eye on her.

Well, for the most part, she seems to be shuttling back and forth between her apartment, which serves as her office and her home. She stays at home most of the time, only going out for shopping occasionally.

So far, there haven't been any suspicious activities reported. Nevertheless, it seems that suspicions linger.

The intention to ask some more probing questions is evident.

In response to Aug's question, Alma replied while busy moving her gaze.

"Um... I'm a commoner, and I used to work as a government office clerk. So, I've never been involved with nobility. Even after the nobility was gone and someone was selected through senkyo? to replace them, it honestly didn't have much to do with my work..."

That makes sense. Changes at the top don't have much impact on lower-level employees.

"I see. But still, why were you chosen as our office worker?"

Come to think of it, that's true. Although it may sound a bit conceited, I heard that all the office workers here are elite with impressive resumes. I saw Alma's resume, and it had a recommendation that described her as an excellent clerk.

Did she lie?

"Well, that's... It's because my handwriting is neat, and I received praise for having easy-to-read reports. I think that might be the reason..."

"..."

Huh?

Chosen for having neat handwriting and clear reports? What's that all about?

"Oh, yes, that's right. Alma's reports are known for having neat handwriting and being easy to read, and they were well-received by the staff at the royal castle."

Henri affirmed Alma's explanation, with a quizzical look on her face.

"Is that so?"

"Yes, when I went to the royal castle the other day, the receptionist said your reports were concise and easy to understand. They envied us because they mostly receive reports with messy handwriting and unclear content."

I see, that's how it was. Henri probably heard about it when she had discussions between our office and the royal castle.

Catalina, who plays a secretarial role, Alma as the secretary, Henri in sales, and Kartas in management. By the way, Ian is said to be good with calculations and handles the financial side. His impressive muscles seem to have no real use so far...

Suddenly recruited as an office worker, Xiao-Lin is working in the general affairs department. However, she's often absent from the office due to preparations for the upcoming Kwang-Long language school. Occasionally, she uses our gate to go back to Kwang-Long or seems busy in other areas.

"By the way, what were we talking about again?"

The conversation had drifted quite a bit, but what was the original topic?

"We were discussing whether Aarlsheid is based on love marriages."

Catalina, the original contributor to the conversation, reminded us.

"Oh, right. In Aarlsheid, love marriages are generally encouraged, even among the nobility. The royal family as well. Moreover, there's no issue with marriages between nobles and commoners."

"Um, can I ask something?"

Alice, who had returned unnoticed at some point, spoke up. Lin, her partner, was by her side.

"What is it, Corner?"

"Well, I think Shin and Sicily are fine because Shin isn't ordinary, but is it okay for others as well? For example, when a noble's daughter marries a commoner, or when... a common woman marries a nobleman..."

Alice asked with a bit of hesitation, looking at Aug.

Huh?

Who is this? Alice, right?

Wait, Alice!?

"Oh, yes. As long as the individuals involved are in agreement, there shouldn't be any problem. However, it's said to be quite challenging for a common woman to marry a nobleman..."

"Is that so!?"

Confused but curious, Alice pressed on. So, who is this!?

"Oh, yes. Living as a noble is quite different from being a commoner. There are many manners to learn, and it's often said that many people struggle to adapt and suffer mentally."

"I see..."

Alice said with a serious expression, lost in thought.

Huh? Seriously, what's going on?

"What about the Corner?"

Aug, also perplexed by Alice's behavior, quietly asked me.

"I don't know. What do you think?"

So far, she has always opposed any talk about romantic relationships, but today, Alice...

Ah! Could it be!?

Just as I was shocked by my own conjecture...

"Um, excuse me!"

Alma, who had been quite timid earlier, suddenly spoke loudly.

"Um, continuing from the previous conversation... could it be that His Highness and Her Highness the Queen also had love marriages?"

Oh, right, I remember we were talking about that.

"Oh, right."

When Aug answered, somewhat taken aback by Alma's sudden change in attitude, both Catalina and Alma exclaimed with excitement.

"That's why I don't really relate to stories where engagement partners are decided through political arrangements."

"That's right! It's wonderful!"

"Um, may I ask for more details next time?"

Unlike Catalina, who was honestly impressed, Alma's enthusiasm was remarkable.

Had she been so deeply moved by it?

"I'm sorry, but I'm not very good at discussing such matters. Please understand."

However, Aug politely declined Alma's request. What's going on? Is he still cautious... No, it's different.

Come to think of it, I've heard about how Aug and Ellie met, but I've never heard about how they started dating or how he proposed. Is he really not good at it, or is it just embarrassing? Either way, it seems difficult to get him to talk about it.

"Oh, is that so..."

Rejected, Alma seemed shocked and a bit dejected.

"Oh, Alma, is there a moment?"

Maria, who had approached Alma, said. When did she return?

Approaching Alma, Maria whispered something to her. At that moment, Alma's eyes, which had been downcast, regained their sparkle.

"Really!?"

"Yes, it looks like everyone has returned, and work is probably done for today, right? If you're okay with it, shall we go get a meal together? Catalina too."

In response to Maria's words, Catalina smiled and said, "Definitely!" But Alma, who had initially shown a happy expression, seemed to remember something and immediately became dejected again.

"I'm sorry... I have plans after this..."

"Oh, I see. Well, let's do it another time."

"Yes, I'm sorry. Despite being invited, I have to decline."

With that, Alma said, picked up her belongings, and quickly left.

"In that case, I'll pass on dinner today as well. Let's go together another time when it suits Alma's schedule."

Perhaps feeling hesitant to go to dinner with just Maria while leaving Alma out, Catalina also declined the invitation.

"That's right. It's a shame, but let's do that. Well, everyone, good job!"

With those words, Maria left in a hurry through the gate.

"Oh, hey, wait, Messina!"

Aug hurriedly reached out, but the gate closed mercilessly. Aug, who had reached out into the space where the gate had disappeared, clenched his hand in frustration.

"That guy... he wouldn't be planning to spill the beans, right?"

Oh, right, Maria is a countess. She used to attend the same noble academy as Aug, even up to the middle school, so she might be well-informed about Aug's romantic situations.

Well, with the way things were going, it seemed like she was more than ready to talk.

"So... should I use the Crown Prince's authority to keep her quiet about this nonsense?"

This guy is trying to use the Crown Prince's authority for such a trivial matter.

I placed my hand on Aug's shoulder, conveying my message with a shake of my head, as if to say, "Give it up." Interrupting a girls' discussion about love... we don't want to deal with the consequences later.

Perhaps understanding my feelings, Aug sighed and slumped his shoulders.

More importantly, there was something off about Maria earlier. It was a conversation about love, yet she responded with indifference. In the past, she would get angry and say things like, "Why is everyone so nosy?" if someone brought up the topic.

Well, we're all adults now, and maybe she only engages in such discussions within her circle of friends. It might be a matter of self-restraint in front of the new office workers they just met.

In that sense, Maria going out to dinner with Catalina and Alma could serve a purpose.

By the way, didn't Alma mention earlier that she just shuttles between the office and her home? I wonder what her plans are?

After leaving the Ultimate Magicians' office, Alma headed straight home, except for stopping to buy dinner ingredients on the way.

She arrived at a three-story brick apartment. Climbing the stairs of the apartment, when she reached her own door, someone called out to her.

"You finally returned..."

The person who spoke was a middle-aged man in a suit.

Upon seeing the man's face, Alma let out a soft sigh and opened the door to her room.

"Come in quickly."

Alma spoke briefly and swiftly entered her room, with the man following suit.

It wasn't until several hours later that the man emerged from Alma's room.
