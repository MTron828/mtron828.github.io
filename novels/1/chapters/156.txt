The second appearance of a demon that plunged the world into chaos.

People around the world were terrified of the demons who had swiftly wiped out the powerful and massive nation known as the Bluesphere Empire.

Next, they wondered if it would be their own countries.

Indeed, the demons who had annihilated the empire set their sights on the Swede Kingdom as their next target.

The people of the Swede Kingdom felt a sense of despair, thinking, "Why our country?"

However, just as the Swede Kingdom was on the verge of being trampled by the demons, a ray of hope appeared.

The wise wizard who had once defeated demons, Merlin Wolfford, had a grandson named Shin Wolfford who came to the rescue with his companions.

Shin and his friends swiftly defeated the demons, becoming the hope of humanity from that day on.

They formed the world's first alliance with the neighboring nations of the Empire, the Great Nation of Els Free Trade Union, and the Holy Nation of Ees to counter the demons.

Finally, they defeated the demons, including their leader, Oliver Strom.

People called this period of turmoil the "Demon King Campaign," and the Ultimate Magicians led by Shin, who put an end to the battle, became literal heroes of salvation.

And, a year and a half after the Demon King Campaign, Shin and his companions enjoyed the peace that had come.
