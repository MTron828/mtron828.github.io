"Wait, does that mean..."

"Can you tell us your heroic tale, the two of you!?"

Maria was eagerly interested in hearing about the demon they had defeated in the past.

Everyone else seemed equally curious.

"Hold on a minute! There's no way we'd share such an embarrassing story."

"Oh... I see..."

Those who had expected to hear the story directly looked a bit disappointed.

"We'll only talk about our past encounters with demons."

While it might not be a heroic tale, the fact that they were going to share stories about their past encounters with demons seemed to rekindle the interest of those who had felt let down.

"The demon we defeated, as the story goes, wreaked havoc without discrimination."

"It seemed as though its sole purpose was to destroy everything around it."

"The surge of magical power it emitted seemed to hate everything in this world."

"You would understand if you faced it. This creature was consumed by hatred."

As they spoke about the demon, the listeners held their breath.

Actually, I've never read that book, so I don't know if the descriptions of the demon are written there.

"The story didn't go into that much detail, I believe..."

"A demon overflowing with hatred..."

Tol's words made sense. Alice must have imagined the part of the story where the demon emitted a power of hatred, and she shivered slightly.

"I felt deep down that it was wrong and had to be defeated."

"I felt such a level of threat from the past demon."

When Grandpa told them about the demon-slaying, he didn't go into that much detail. In reality, they were thinking about many things while fighting.

"It seems that the demon that appeared this time also had 'hatred' towards the Empire."

"The demon we defeated mentioned that its goal was to destroy the Empire, so I think it's likely the same."

Hatred.

It was unclear what the past demon held a grudge against.

Strom's feelings of resentment and hatred toward the Empire were also unclear.

However, based on the words of the demon they defeated, it could be predicted that Strom had a strong hatred for the Empire.

Certainly, it's likely that even the person who confronted the past demon felt that way, so the demon probably had some hatred towards something.

So, Grandma had probably guessed that hatred and resentment were at the root of the cause for demon transformation.

"Strom might have indeed lost his purpose after taking his revenge on the Empire and is now staying quiet."

Grandma was speaking to everyone, especially looking at Aug.

"But... there is a commonality in their past demons - hatred. We can't say for sure that Strom won't direct that hatred towards the world, just like the past demons did."

"That's true..."

"I'm concerned about that. The current demon might be different from the past ones, but there are similarities, and they are still demonized."

Because there is a common thread of hatred and resentment leading to demonization, it's not wise to let one's guard down just because there's a difference in self-awareness.

And it's frustrating that there aren't enough examples to draw conclusions about why it happens.

"It would be nice to have more evidence for a judgment. There are too many unknowns, and we can't verify anything."

"Is there anything we can find out?"

"That's right..."

When I expressed my frustration and wished for more clues, Grandpa and Grandma looked thoughtful for a moment.

And then...

"Do any of you know what kind of 'human' turned into demons in the past?"

They asked this question to everyone.

"No, we don't..."

"It wasn't mentioned in the stories."

According to Yuri, it seems that the details of the demons weren't included in the stories.

"That's right. After all, the Earlshide Mage Corps worked hard to cover it up."

"That's why the general public doesn't know what kind of people became demons."

"They covered it up..."

It seems that Tol noticed.

I noticed it too.

Those who became demons in the past...

"It was a magician who belonged to the former Earlshide Kingdom Mage Corps."

Everyone probably had a vague idea. With that one sentence, they became excited.

"Is that so? Your Highness?"

"Well, I had no idea either..."

Aug, who said it was the first time she heard of it, in response to Maria's question.

Uncle Dis hadn't talked about it.

Certainly, as a Mage Corps, they wouldn't want it known that a demon had emerged from within their ranks.

But...

"What's wrong, Shin?"

"No... I was just wondering if it's something worth hiding so desperately."

I was surprised to hear that they were a former Mage Corps member, but is it something worth hiding to that extent?

Thinking that way, Grandma began to explain the reason.

"The person who became a demon was an incredibly talented magician. In terms of ability, they were on par with this old man."

"Me? On par with a sage!?"

"That's amazing!"

Maria and Tol were utterly surprised.

It seems that having the same level of power as Grandpa was quite remarkable.

"That talented individual wasn't properly recognized by the squad leader of the Mage Corps at the time. In fact, that squad leader took credit for the magician's accomplishments."

"Wow. There are bosses like that everywhere, aren't there?"

That's awful.

"Due to that, the person couldn't get the proper recognition within the organization."

"In the public eye, I was doing my work as a hunter at the time, and people were saying I was the strongest magician of the era. Meanwhile, that magician, who should have had the same level of ability, was smoldering in the organization."

Even though they had the same level of ability, one was called the strongest magician, while the other was left behind in the organization.

It's indeed a cruel story.

But still...

"Wow, you seem to know a lot about that magician?"

When I said that, both of them had a shadow on their faces.

"That magician... was someone we've known since our youth."

"Huh..."

Someone uttered these words, and a small voice of surprise rose.

I was surprised as well because I had hardly been told anything about Grandpa and Grandma's past.

"We've been together since junior high school through high-level magic academies. We were good friends and good rivals."

"I went to the high-level magic academy, and at the time, these two were always acting together. They were called genius Wolfford and prodigy MacLean and stood out quite a bit."

"Grandpa and Grandma's high-level magic academy days..."

I'm really curious now.

"MacLean... is the name?"

"Yeah, Kyle MacLean. He's a guy who uses magic logically, unlike someone who relies on instinct and intuition. I also learned a lot from him."

"Hey, what about me?"

"Your explanations were too intuitive for me to fully understand. I can't believe Shin has grown so much."

I was taught in a straightforward manner when it was my turn... Grandpa, you really went through a lot.

"Our story has deviated a bit. After graduating from the high-level magic academy, we became hunters, while Kyle joined the Mage Corps."

"I was young at the time and didn't like being tied down by an organization."

"In that regard, Kyle was serious. He wanted to work for the country rather than for himself."

"People around us judged us hunters on their own. It's a world where ability is everything, for better or worse."

"But the Mage Corps is an organization. Even if you have outstanding abilities, you won't necessarily receive much recognition."

Monster hunters might be well-respected and well-compensated if they have the skills, but it's a risky business if they lack the abilities to earn their daily bread.

Joining the Mage Corps, in a way, is like becoming a civil servant: less recognition, but a stable income.

Which one is better? It has its pros and cons.

"I understood from the beginning that becoming part of an organization would make it difficult to achieve individual recognition and accomplishments. Nevertheless, Kyle chose to join the Mage Corps. Unlike the individualistic hunters, being a member of the Mage Corps meant protecting the citizens."

"But... his superior at the time was a cunning man. He claimed his subordinates' achievements as his own and blamed his own mistakes on his subordinates."

"Ugh... What a jerk."

Maria seems to feel indignation toward Kyle's former superior, and similar sentiments were visible among the others.

"Even within an organization, there's a sense of evaluation. Kyle, who had his achievements taken by his superior and was unfairly blamed for mistakes he didn't make, became increasingly dissatisfied with the Mage Corps."

"I remember staying up all night listening to his superior's complaints."

They seem to be recalling that time, with nostalgic expressions on their faces.

"Kyle was unable to advance within the organization, and his friend, who had always been compared to him in terms of ability, was steadily earning recognition. The gap kept widening, and he had a lot of grievances about it."

"I... didn't know about that. I only heard my superior's complaints, and he never mentioned anything like that to me."

"A man can't say such a thing."

A friend... If you've been together since junior high school, you can call them close friends. Grandpa's abilities were on par with his, but he was recognized while he remained obscure within the organization.

"Did he hold a grudge over that? But it doesn't seem like a reason to become a demon to that extent..."

"Probably, it's not just that. There might have been other factors."

"But for now, all we know is that he held a grudge, which is why the Mage Corps desperately tried to cover it up."

Other grudges... I wonder what they could be?

"We don't know what Kyle held a grudge or resentment against, but he was undoubtedly the one who became a demon."

"I was confused. My childhood friend, who I've known since a young age, became the first demon in human history and started pouring out hatred to the world. And... we have to defeat him."

Even though he became a demon, he was originally a close friend.

Did Grandpa defeat him...?

Come to think of it, he hasn't used the word "defeat" once since the beginning.

...There must have been many conflicts back then...

"Kyle was a serious man. And he was a kind man who cared about the country and its people."

"As soon as such a man became a demon, he started rampaging with the intent to destroy the entire country. We've seen it with our own eyes, a serious man like that turning into a demon and having to deal with it."

We don't know the circumstances that led to Strom becoming a demon, but that's why we can't be too optimistic.

Because there are so few examples regarding demons, the two who only have memories of the past demons don't have a sense of security in the current situation.

"So, don't think that demons who've achieved their goals are safe, and please remain cautious."

"Indeed, you never know what might happen."

"Understood. I'll convey that to my father. He might know part of the story from earlier, and he might be convinced."

Aug, who had been listening to Grandpa and Grandma's story with a serious expression, promised Uncle Dis not to let his guard down.

The others also seemed perplexed by the story they had never heard before.

"Somehow... I don't think I'll be able to enjoy reading hero stories in the future."

"Me neither."

"Same here..."

Maria, Thor, and Alice had complex expressions as they were told the hidden side of the story they had enjoyed reading.

If the demon, who had been portrayed as pure evil, turned out to be someone with various sympathetic qualities, it's only natural they'd feel this way.

"I'm sorry for taking away everyone's dreams. However, to verify this incident, we determined that we need accurate information about the past demons."

"It's true that Kyle was mistreated in the Mage Corps. There might have been other factors, but it's clear that grudges and hatred were at the core. Strom, too, might reveal something if we investigate his origins."

Certainly, that makes sense, but given that the Empire has already been completely destroyed...

"Even if we wanted to investigate, there's no Empire left to do so... It might be quite difficult."

"If only we had realized while the Empire was still standing..."

Seems impossible now.

In the end, they couldn't predict what actions Strom would take, and they concluded that they should continue to be cautious based on Grandpa and Grandma's story.

It was truly a shocking tale.

"I never would've imagined that demons were acquaintances of you two."

"Indeed... It feels like our perspective on the story has been completely overturned."

After finishing hearing Grandpa and Grandma's story, we informed Butler Steve and Head Maid Marika about the birthday matter and they came to my room.

As soon as they entered the room, Oug and Thor gave their impressions. They must have been greatly shocked since they grew up reading stories told by Grandpa and Grandma.

With fourteen people, including Ellie and May-chan, the room felt cramped. The atmosphere had also become heavy due to the lingering effects of the previous conversation.

Despite the heavy atmosphere, I decided to ask something that had been on my mind while listening to the story. I wanted to know how everyone felt about the current public opinion, which seemed to be elevating me to a certain extent.

"You know, I was wondering if... the current public opinion, like, the way they're praising me, doesn't bother anyone? I mean, I was just thinking about it a bit... but..."

What do they think?

So, I asked, and everyone looked at me as if saying, "Huh?"

"What are you talking about? There's no way something like that would happen, right?"

"That's right. Among us, Lord Shin is the only one with exceptional strength."

"To be honest, it's strange in itself that we're being praised so much, isn't it?"

"Being praised too much feels creepy!"

"I feel the same."

Maria argued that it was impossible for such a thing to happen.

While Julius' words were somewhat troubling, Tony, Mark, and Olivia seemed to find the fact that they were being appreciated unexpected.

"You're a weird one. Merlin was jealous of the difference in appraisal because he faced an equal opponent. In this situation where you stand out alone, what is there for us to be jealous of?"

I think he's going too far by calling me a weirdo.

But I'm glad. It seems that nobody in the group harbors ill feelings.

"Oh, but there are probably many out there who will be jealous when you marry Cecily."

"Huh? Is that so?"

"Yes, it is. Shin, do you know how popular Cecily was? During the engagement announcement party, I remember that she was stared down by several people..."

"That's right. Cecily was so popular in middle school... you could even say that all the guys in the school were after her."

"S-so much...?"

"Yes, that much. I was right next to her... as well."

Wow. Maria was casting a gloomy smile as she spoke.

"Maria, you're scaring me..."

"Come on, Maria-san. Mei is scared, so please stop that laughter."

"...Fine... I mean, she's already taken, after all..."

"Eek!"

When Maria's attention turned to Ellie, who was sitting next to me on the bed, with nowhere to sit, Cecily, who was sitting on the bed with me, tugged at my sleeve.

"Hmm? What's wrong, Cecily?"

"Um, well! I'm not dating anyone! Shin is my first love!"

She seemed to be frantically trying to assert her innocence, probably because Maria had just mentioned how Cecily was popular throughout the academy.

Blushing and teary-eyed, Cecily was making a desperate appeal.

It's too cute.

"You don't have to worry about that. In fact, I feel a sense of superiority for being able to make a girl who was so popular my girlfriend."

"Huh? Uh, um, really...? Ehehe."

While comforting Cecily by patting her head, I said so, and Cecily seemed relieved and smiled.

"I'm glad you didn't go to the middle school, Shin."

"Why's that?"

"Because... you probably would have been very popular. And then... you would have been with...dating different girls..."

For some reason, Cecily became teary-eyed again, perhaps due to her imagination.

"Probably wouldn't have been that popular."

"I bet you would! After all, you're so handsome!"

"That's enough."

"Eep!"

Because she was speaking so loudly about embarrassing things, I hugged her and silenced her.

"Don't say such embarrassing things."

"But you're so cool."

"Still saying it?"

"Eek!"

I pushed down Cecily, who was being persistent, onto the bed.

"If you keep saying it, should I give you a little punishment?"

"Eeh..."

Just when I was thinking about what to do with a bright red Cecily, I heard a voice.

"Hey. Are you planning to do this publicly? I don't mind, but..."

I suddenly realized that other people were in the room.

"Oh, uh... Aah!"

Overwhelmed by embarrassment, Cecily buried her head under the sheets and hid away.

"As usual, you become oblivious to your surroundings so easily."

"They're so close."

I received warm looks and words from Thor and Julius.

"You... How could you do that in front of a single person like me!"

Maria was saying, and Tony mumbled.

"Maybe Mr. MacLean also had some grudges about love affairs."

He said that.
