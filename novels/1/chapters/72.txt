It seems that shortly after Mr. Oruguran joined the monster subjugation team, the infamous ministerial meeting was held.

At that meeting, it was reported that the strategy to conquer the Demon Realm had been agreed upon, and the World Alliance's signing ceremony and deployment ceremony were held simultaneously. The situation is finally reaching its final stage.

As for the decisions made during the meeting, it was decided to divide the forces equally between the armies of the four countries surrounding the Demon Realm, Els and East.

Aarlsheid, being a major power with a large number of military personnel, will not increase its forces. We, the Ultimate Magicians, will be divided into four teams of three and join the surrounding armies of the four countries.

Regarding this, Aarlsheid will not accept the participation of the Ultimate Magicians. At first glance, it may seem unfavorable for Aarlsheid, but in reality, it is not. Aarlsheid's Kingdom of Magicians has practiced and published a paper worldwide through the Magic Academy, stating that "increasing the scale and precision of magic control will enhance the power of magic and allow for non-verbal casting."

This is an undeniable fact, but because it takes time for results to be seen after implementation, so far only the Aarlsheid Kingdom of Magicians has been able to practice it. As a result, other countries will eventually acquire the same power, but for now, the Aarlsheid Kingdom of Magicians is the only one that has stood out, so they refrained from strengthening the forces of Els, East, and us.

The same goes for the Knight Order, as they do not have Vibrations Swords, but they conduct daily combat training using Jet Boots, which puts them one step ahead of other countries. In fact, with the official adoption of the Aarlsheid Kingdom Knight Order, there have been large orders for Jet Boots from various countries to the Wolford Company.

Additionally, with the introduction of the Magician Division, Jet Boots have become a trend in the world of military equipment.

Thanks to this, the Bean Workshop is in a frenzy producing Jet Boots.

... I need to go and express my gratitude to my parents at least once... Just giving them a bonus doesn't seem enough...

Now, it seems that in the training grounds of the Knight Orders and Magician Divisions of various countries, you can see people floating in the air. There are many who are flying in unintended directions against their will...

Nevertheless, it seems to be taking shape.

"Uh, there's this magical item that's been attracting everyone's curious glances..."

"You're talking about it all of a sudden?"

In the classroom, Oug, who had informed them of the results of the ministerial meeting, asked with a puzzled expression.

It's only natural to answer that you don't know what will sell when you report the results of the meeting.

"No. I never expected jet boots to sell this much."

"Hmm. In times like these, they probably want to try anything that seems to add to their military strength. It's the way of the world."

"Is that so?"

"However, if they're officially adopted by the military of various countries, it's possible that even civilians will start using them. Your 'airball' may become popular sooner or later."

"That's a good point. If it becomes widespread in all countries equally, it would be fair, and things like national leagues, Champions Leagues, and World Cups might not be just a dream."

Everything is a conversation for after this turmoil is over, but it would be wonderful if they could provide entertainment to people who are under tremendous stress due to the crisis of humanity's survival.

"And as the organizer, your assets will increase again. How much do you plan to make?"

"...I have no use for it..."

"Well, that's a luxurious problem to have. If you have that much wealth, why not surround yourself with mistresses or something?"

"Hey! What are you saying..."

Twitch

Cold... A very strong coldness is emanating from the seat next to me.

Not figuratively, but literally, it's cold!

"...Shin-kun... Are you going to surround yourself with mistresses?"

Smiling, exuding cold air, Shishiri asks.

This atmosphere... it's just like Irene!

"No way! I've never even thought about something like that!"

"Is that so?"

"Yeah!"

"...In that case, it's fine."

I utter a denial without showing the slightest hesitation.

If I hesitated or faltered, it would be terrifying to even think about.

Pure strength aside, mentally, I feel like I can never win.

"Hehe, you're desperate."

"Oug! What the hell are you saying? Thanks to you, it could have turned into a disaster!"

Our relationship, me and Shishiri's!

"Heh, well, it's just a warning. I have the power to control the world and more wealth than I can use. Besides, I have a beautiful saint as my wife. As an object of jealousy, she's hard to beat, isn't she?"

"Is... is that so?"

"That's right. If that's the case, groundless rumors like the one earlier will pop up here and there. It's a rehearsal for that."

"I see..."

Oug is worried about me...

"Don't be deceived, Lord Shin. It's just a joke from His Highness."

"Thor, why would you spill the beans?"

"Why, indeed?"

"Heh, it's a simple joke from His Highness, who has nothing better to do."

"Heh! This guy, what is he saying..."

Pikiri.

"Cold... Very cold air is coming from my side."

Not metaphorically, but literally!

"Are you going to surround yourself with mistresses, Shin-kun?"

"His Highness, are you going to surround yourself with mistresses?"

"I am not!"

"Heh, it's a luxurious problem. If you have that much wealth, why not surround yourself with mistresses or something?"

"What?! What are you saying..."

Pikiri.

Cold... A very strong coldness is emanating from my side.

"His Highness, are you going to surround yourself with mistresses?"

"I am not!"

"Heh, it

"Next is Claude. You have the right to be the second to receive it because there's quite a bit written about you."

"Oh, thank you..."

Shishiri also has an expression that's hard to describe.

It must be embarrassing...

"Next is Messina. You're also featured quite a bit. With this, you'll become even more famous, but be careful not to get involved with strange men."

"I understand."

Maria is my friend since I came to the royal capital. She'll have a lot of appearances.

The rest of them are said to be similar, so they were distributed together.

...Oug has become quite a bother...

Then, the books reached Alfred-sensei, who appeared for homeroom. Since the first class was a magic practice, they all decided to read the newly completed book together.

It became so, but...

"Ahahaha! Who is this!?"

If Alice bursts into laughter loudly...

"'Grandpa, I want to use this power for the sake of world peace'... 'Grandpa'? 'Me'?"

Maria is reading while her shoulders are trembling.

"Don't laugh like that. Look here, 'August. If you want to use my power anytime, our friendship is eternal'... Uh, uhuhuhu. Ahahaha!"

Yuri is also bursting into laughter at the lines spoken by the character who seems to be me in the book.

"I... I didn't say such a thing..."

Shishiri is also writhing in discomfort at the lines attributed to the character who seems to be her in the book, such as 'I was born to meet you. This heart and body are all yours'... lines that she has never heard of.

"Ugh... Walford-kun... My abs are about to break..."

Even Lin, who I thought was reading calmly, says this.

However, there's little room for strong objections, as there are no lies in the episodes that occurred and the content itself. The release is imminent.

It's too late to change the lines now.

I see... Is this going to be released to the world...?

Thinking that acquaintances will read it makes me want to die.

"Well, reading this book, only a handful of people will be able to laugh like we are now. More than ninety-nine percent of those who read this will be touched by this story and think that Shin=Walford is a kind-hearted hero who wishes for world peace."

Could it be...?

"Are they using this story to manipulate my image?"

The editing states that it's from the Kingdom of Arlsheid, so did they place an order to the author in this way?

Especially since the final battle with the Demon Lords is approaching.

By showing their power to defeat the Demon Lords, they probably wanted to establish everyone's impression from such a perspective to avoid making it seem dangerous.

Really... the Arlsheid royal family keeps making me wary...

"Oh, that's entirely the author's creation. When we read this, the whole family and Ellie burst into laughter. Mei was the only one who read it with shining eyes. Well, with this, I gave permission because I thought the people wouldn't have negative feelings towards Shin."

"Damn it! Give me back my emotions!"

Was it just a coincidence!

Really! These royals!

While sympathizing fully with the old man who read his own book and said, "Whose story is this?" after finishing reading it, I finished reading the "New Heroic Tale" to be released next month.

By the way, "New Heroic Tale"... The old man's book was "Heroic Tale," so is this a sequel?

"Hmm, I didn't think the content was so hilarious. Is it because of my classroom connection?"

Alfred-sensei, my homeroom teacher, who had also finished reading the book like everyone else, muttered. I was surprised that Alfred-sensei, who is my homeroom teacher, had such an impression, but upon closer inspection, Alfred-sensei wasn't involved in the various commotions that erupted everywhere. It's even more so for people who have no direct acquaintance with me... They would probably believe that what is narrated in this book is true and that I am such a person.

It's kind of scary that everyone is likely to imagine a Shin=Walford different from the real me.

But is this going to make me famous?

Even in my previous life, celebrities sometimes revealed things that were unexpected at the time, like "that was like this back then" or "it was like that." So...

"That's how it is. From now on, the people will recognize Shin as someone with heroic thoughts. You should exercise a little more self-restraint."

"...I feel like more and more restraints are being added."

"Give it up. That's what it means to become famous worldwide."

...Now, Oug just said something I can't ignore, right!?

"...Worldwide?"

"Yeah. This book is a 'worldwide simultaneous release.'"

...No way!

"Huh?! Why?! The Arlsheid Kingdom's edited book will be released all over the world!?"

"Of course, isn't it? Your grandparents were globally famous heroes. This is the story of their grandson, you know? People all over the world want to read it. In fact, orders have already come in from various countries through the communication devices. The first edition has already been sent to various countries. It's probably been delivered to the bookstore warehouses by now."

...So... people all over the world will read this...

"We wanted to get it out before the campaign to subdue the Demon Lords. It would be too late after the battles start, wouldn't it?"

"You don't have to worry about that..."

Certainly, for information manipulation, it wouldn't make sense if it were released after the battles started. I'm not mentally prepared for this!

"Rather than Arlsheid, it's more important to let other countries know that Shin is not a dangerous presence. Give up."

If I knew this was going to happen, I wouldn't have wanted to become famous...

Seeing Shin, who is crushed by the fact that his own story will be released not only in Arlsheid but all over the world, Tooru spoke to August.

"Your Highness, you're being modest. Didn't you order the author to write something that wouldn't give the readers a bad impression of Shin-dono?"

"...Did I do that?"

"Yes, you did."

Tooru and Julius know that it was not a coincidence that it was written as a hero with heroic thoughts who wishes for world peace, but it was done at August's instruction.

"Don't tell Shin, okay?"

"Heh, are you embarrassed?"

"I've been saying it like this... Tooru."

"Oh, I'm sorry. Did you get influenced by Shin-dono?"

"...Well, never mind. If Shin knows, he'll get carried away. Just make him think it happened by chance with this kind of content, okay?"

"Your Highness, you're not straightforward."

And perhaps it's embarrassing. August, who knew that it was not a coincidence, but an instruction from him, and did not tell Shin about it.

Understanding his feelings, Tooru and Julius looked at August with warm eyes.

From a young age, they had been chosen as the prince's companions in their studies and had grown up together, but there had always been a certain distance in their relationship.

However, in recent times, the two of them had become less reserved around August.

While August saw it as a favorable change...

"You two... have been influenced too much by Shin..."

August sighed, feeling that they had been influenced a bit too much.
