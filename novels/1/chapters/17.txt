"Is Kurt on home suspension?"

For some reason, I ended up starting a study group and became its president. The day after, when I went to pick up Sicily and Maria as usual and then went to school, Aug informed me about it.

"It seems so. This morning, the academy received a message stating, 'Stay at home for a while and reflect.'"

The source of all this trouble, who had to be guarded by Sicily, was now on home suspension. Will this bring some relief?

"Hey, I have a question. Why does Kurt behave like that? Everyone knows that such an attitude is unacceptable at the Academy of Advanced Magic. And not only that, he's been directly warned by Aug and still doesn't improve. It just doesn't make sense..."

A noble with a nearly top-tier status as a prince of his own country, yet he can't follow the words of a noble supremist. It's baffling.

At that moment, Aug, Thor, and Julius exchanged subtle glances.

"What's wrong?"

"Well, to be honest, we're a bit confused too."

"We attended a middle school where nobles and the wealthy study..."

"Kurt was at that school too."

"Eh? Really?"

It's news to me, but well, all three of them are nobles... or rather, Aug is a royal, but if there's a school for nobles to attend, it's not surprising if they were together.

"I wanted to ask, was Kurt always like that from the beginning?"

"That's what's puzzling us. He was certainly confident, but he didn't have that attitude of coming here under his noble status..."

"Yeah, I come from a baron's family, so my status is lower than his, but he never acted that way towards me."

I find it hard to believe, knowing only the current Kurt, but apparently, he wasn't like this in the past. So, what is the current Kurt?

"By the way, Your Highness, I recall that when we were in our third year of middle school, a teacher at the academy approached us. Didn't they talk to you?"

"Oh... I remember that. Wasn't it a magic teacher?"

"Yes, 'You all have remarkable magical talent. Would you like to come to my research lab?' They were approaching anyone who could use magic to some extent."

"That's right. They approached so many people all over the place that it seemed suspicious, so I didn't accept the invitation in the end."

"I, on the other hand, was never approached..."

...Well, that's not surprising, I guess.

"So, what's the deal with that?"

"Well, I believe... Kurt used to visit that teacher's research lab."

"Oh? And then?"

"His magical abilities significantly improved after he started visiting that lab. At that time, he was a bit boastful about his magical skills..."

"Huh, was that teacher really that great?"

"Well, he did have significant skill, and his appearance was quite appealing. Although, he did seem suspicious."

"His appearance?"

"Yes, he seemed to be blind, as he always wore an eyepatch that covered both eyes. Yet, he managed to act normally..."

Hmm? What's so impressive about that?

"Why was he so well-liked then?"

"Why, you see... he could sense his surroundings using magic. However, that ability was limited to magical beings. You do know that it doesn't work on inanimate objects, right? So, that means that the teacher used other magic besides that. Frankly, if His Highness hadn't said otherwise, I would have wanted to visit that lab too."

"He did seem suspicious, though."

That's all Aug cares about.

But does this have any connection to Kurt's current behavior? While it's true that he became more confident during that time...

Honestly, I'm not sure if it's related, but it piqued my curiosity a bit.

"I see. Who is this teacher anyway?"

"I think he mentioned he came from the Empire."

"The Empire, huh..."

The kingdom where I am now shares its borders with another country, the Blue Sphere Empire. This country holds significant power and authority among the nobility. Many people from the Empire have sought refuge in the kingdom. He might be one of them.

"But do people with such strong magical abilities really seek refuge?"

"Could there be some ulterior motive? That's why it seemed suspicious."

In the end, we couldn't figure anything out from mere speculation, and the conversation about Alfred-sensei coming to the academy ended.

"We have the explanation for the research club this afternoon. Although you're already decided to join, make sure to formally participate."

The research club... It was decided without my consent. I hope this doesn't stir up resentment among the upperclassmen. Is it really okay?

The morning classes were about the countries in this world.

I thought it wasn't necessary for me, but considering it from the perspective of a mage, it seems different.

In that class, there was also an explanation about the Blue Sphere Empire that was discussed earlier.

The region where the Blue Sphere Empire is located originally consisted of many small countries. Among these, one country's king gradually unified the others, leading to the formation of the current empire, with that king becoming the first emperor. The small countries that were annexed were granted as territories to nobles of the empire. As a result, the capital of the small country became the home of high nobles, and the surrounding towns and regions were granted to lower-ranking nobles, giving the empire's nobility significant power. Due to this history of conquering the surrounding regions through military force, the empire still maintains a strong military presence.

However, there hasn't been a major war in recent times. In the past, the kingdom and the empire engaged in war, but both nations neglected to exterminate the surrounding magical creatures. This negligence led to a significant increase in these creatures.

Nevertheless, there are rumors that the empire is still eyeing the neighboring countries. Even though they have a strong defense against magical creatures, they continue to expand their military power. This is why Aug and the others mentioned what they did.

However, I can't see how this connects to Kurt's recent actions. If the empire has some ulterior motive, like revenge or a counterattack, it would make more sense...

As I pondered these things during class...

While Shin and the others were attending classes at the academy, someone had visited the Ritzberg Mansion.

"It's been a while, Professor Strom."

"Yes, it has been a while. The last time I came here was when Kurt took the academy's entrance exam."

The visitor was none other than Oliver Strom, the magic teacher at the middle school that Shin and the others had been discussing.

He worked as a teacher at the middle school, but at Kurt's request, he had tutored him as a private instructor until the entrance exam for the Advanced Magic Academy. As a result, he was known to the mansion's gatekeeper and other staff members.

As described by Thor, he wore an eyepatch that covered both of his eyes. The part of his face that wasn't covered suggested that he was a handsome young man.

"So... why is Professor Strom here?"

"Well, I heard through word of mouth that Kurt has been placed on home suspension. As a former teacher, I was concerned, you see."

He explained that he had come out of concern for his former student.

"I see... What on earth happened to Kurt? We're also perplexed."

"He used to hold me in high regard as his teacher. I thought I might be able to have a conversation with him..."

"I see... Well, my husband is currently absent, but my wife is here. I will arrange for you to see her. Please wait a moment."

"Understood."

Saying so, the gatekeeper hurried into the mansion, and when he returned, he was accompanied by an older lady.

"Oh, Professor Strom! Thank you for coming!"

"Good to see you again, Mrs. Ritzberg. How is Kurt doing?"

Upon asking, Mrs. Ritzberg, Kurt's mother, broke down in tears.

"I just... I don't understand anything anymore! He said such things even to members of the royal family, whom he had pledged loyalty to..."

Words became inadequate from that point on. Oliver spoke to the distraught Mrs. Ritzberg.

"I see... It seems there's a need to find out what happened. Let's talk about it."

"Professor... you are our only hope! My husband is trying to punish Kurt! Please, please help bring him back to his senses!"

"I understand. I'll do what I can."

With that, Oliver entered the Ritzberg Mansion and made his way to Kurt's room.

"Kurt, it's me, Strom. May I come in?"

However, there was no response.

"Mrs. Ritzberg, is it alright?"

"Yes, please go ahead."

With her approval, Oliver entered Kurt's room and immediately cast a soundproof barrier.

"What's wrong, Kurt? You're looking rather pathetic, aren't you?"

Kurt had his limbs bound to prevent him from leaving the room, and he was lying on the floor. In this world, there are no magical devices to suppress magical power. Magical power affects human life processes, and if it's completely suppressed, it can lead to death.

There is no one who can use magic effortlessly without incantations, especially not someone who has just entered the Advanced Magic Academy. If he were to attempt using magic by controlling his mana, the guards waiting outside his room would immediately sense it and disrupt his concentration. That's why he's left in this bound state.

"Professor Strom..."

"Didn't I tell you? You're a special individual, as I mentioned not too long ago."

"Yes..."

"You are special in every way, in status and ability. There's nothing that's beyond your reach, you know?"

"But... I couldn't get the woman... It was because of that guy... He got in the way..."

"Hmm, I see. He's an obstacle for you, huh?"

Saying this, he began to envelop himself in magic. However, there were no signs of the guards outside entering. Oliver had set up a soundproof barrier as well as a magic-blocking one.

"You understand? I'll teach that interfering fellow a lesson. You are..."

After a while, Oliver left the room.

"Professor! How did it go!?"

"Well, it's not looking very good... He seems to be in a state of mental and physical collapse. We'll have to wait for him to recover over time..."

"W-what! If you do that, that man will... My husband will punish Kurt!"

"Of course, I don't approve of such a thing either. Even if I call him 'former,' he's still my dear student. I will advise Count Ritzberg as well. Kurt is in a state of mental and emotional collapse, and punishing him would not be in the count's best interest."

"I see... Thank you, Professor!"

"Well then, I'll take my leave for now. I still have classes at the academy."

And with that, Oliver left the Ritzberg Mansion.

"Hehehe, Kurt, do your best and dance for me, alright?"

Oliver smiled as he walked away, looking up at the room where Kurt was.

Morning classes had ended, and everyone was having lunch together. Since there were ten students in Class S, they usually hung out together. Today, the first-year Class S students had occupied a table in the cafeteria.

"By the way, Shin, we couldn't discuss this in the morning, but what are you going to do about Kurt's commute to and from school?"

"What do you mean?"

"Well, Kurt has been placed on home suspension, right? That means there's no danger in and around the academy and the town anymore, right?"

"Well, that's true."

"In that case, do we still need to provide him with an escort?"

"Right... um, yes, the escort..."

"But, do we have to commute together if it's not for the escort?"

"Huh..."

"We live in the same direction, so it should be fine to commute together, don't you think? Is that okay?"

"No, no, it's not a problem! Y-yeah, we live in the same direction, so it's not strange to commute together!"

Shizuku stood up and shouted this, drawing attention to herself.

"Ah... s-sorry!"

"Geez, Shizuku is getting too worked up."

"N-no, I'm not!"

"Maria, you're commuting together too, right?"

"Of course! Originally, I was planning to commute with Shizuku. Is that okay, or should I not join you?"

"No, it's fine."

"Th-th-that's right! W-what are you saying!?"

"Calm down, Claude."

Unusually, Oug made a comment, and as expected, he was grinning.

"Well, you're amazing, Shin."

"Huh? Me?"

"That's right. In front of everyone like this, saying 'Come with me' or something... No way, I couldn't do that."

"You're not saying that, are you!?"

"Together..."

"Shizuku is fixating on something strange."

"Well, joking aside, commuting together is a good idea. Claude and Messina are both beautiful women. There might be some inappropriate folks approaching you."

"Don't stir things up with jokes..."

Well, they are both beautiful girls, so they might attract attention like when we first met.

"By the way, Shin, you use detection magic even while moving, right? Why is that?"

"Hm? Why? Wouldn't you understand if someone directed ill intentions towards us?"

"Ill intentions?"

"Shin-dono, what exactly do you mean by ill intentions? To understand ill intentions?"

"What do you mean? I mean it just like it sounds. Especially in this capital, there are a lot of people who are indifferent to each other. From among them, you can quickly sense if someone is directing ill intentions towards us."

"I don't understand ill intentions."

Huh? You can't sense ill intentions? That's... oh, I see.

"Thor, have you ever hunted monsters?"

"Of course not. I was a middle school student until recently."

"The magic power of monsters is, like, eerie or unsettling, not ordinary magic power. Feelings of hostility or ill intentions are directed towards us, right? It's something normal humans can feel. Even if they say the security in the capital is good, with this many people, you occasionally feel it, you know?"

"Monsters' magic power... is that so..."

"Wolfford-kun, have you ever hunted monsters?"

"I have."

"By the way... how old were you when you first hunted a monster?"

"Ten."

"Ten!?"

"It was a bear, about three meters tall."

"A bear!?"

"I cut off both arms because they were getting in the way, and then I chopped off its head to defeat it."

...

When I told the story of the first time I hunted a monster, everyone was left dumbfounded.

Huh? Did I do something again? Which one, the bear? At the age of ten?

"Wow, you were being guarded by someone so amazing."

"It's reassuring."

Maria seemed slightly exasperated, while Shizuku said it with a smile. I wonder which one Maria is exasperated about.

"Well, should we get going soon?"

"Oh, it's that time already."

Saying that, I looked at the wall clock. Lunch break was almost over, and there were hardly any students left in the cafeteria.

"What a waste of time, isn't it?"

"Lord Yuri, you're right, if we don't participate, it might cause resentment."

I'm afraid of the resentment of the upperclassmen.

Since we already knew which research clubs we were going to join, we headed to the club orientation, which was just for observation. It was held in the auditorium where the entrance ceremony had taken place, and it was quicker to cross the grounds from the cafeteria. But as we were about to do that...

I shivered!

I felt an eerie presence through the magic detection I had set up.

Could it be? Are ill intentions directed at us!?

Where is it!?

Looking across the grounds, I found Kaart.

Why is he here!? He was supposed to be on house arrest, right? Can he really break out so easily!?

As my thoughts were paralyzed by such questions, Kaart seemed to have finished his incantation.

"Shizuku! Oug! Cloak yourselves in magic!!"

At the sound of his voice, Oug, Shizuku, and the others also became aware of the abnormality. They probably never dreamed that they would be attacked inside the academy. Everyone froze.

"Darn it!!"

Kaart cast his magic. I stepped forward to shield everyone.

Will I make it in time!? Except for Shizuku, Oug, and the others, none of them are wearing that uniform!!

"You bastaaaaaard!!!"

"Screaaaam!!!"

And then, the magic struck.

BOOOOM!!!

And I... I extended my hands in front of everyone and created a magical barrier.

Uoooh! That was close!!

It was a spur-of-the-moment decision, so I couldn't visualize the magic!

I managed to protect everyone, but my imagery was incomplete, so I couldn't completely nullify the power and ended up with burns on my hands. Areas other than my clothes are not protected.

"Shin-kun! That...!"

"Yeah, I'm fine, but are you okay?"

"Shin-kun protected me."

It seems like everyone behind is okay.

The automatic healing function of the uniform activates, and my burned hand starts to heal.

"The burn is... healing..."

Someone mumbled behind me, but I don't have time to think about it.

"Was that... Kaart?"

"Why?! Wasn't he on house arrest!?"

That question is valid. I thought the same thing. But more than that, it's a fact that he's here and launched an attack magic at us.

"Oug, this is no longer acceptable, right?"

"Yeah, you're right. We've let it slide so far as an attempt... but this is attempted murder, and it's impossible to overlook."

As Oug and I discussed Kaart's treatment, Kaart's behavior took a strange turn.

"You... You... You... You... You... You...!!!"

He screamed as if he had gone mad and began to clothe himself in an abnormal amount of magical power.

"Hey, Oug."

"What is it?"

"Do you think he can control that?"

"...I doubt it."

"Doesn't this look bad?"

"...Yeah."

Saying that, I took out my Vibrationsword from my extradimensional storage and leaped towards Kaart.

"Oug! Evacuate everyone! That thing is bad!!"

"Got it!"

The result of a creature's runaway magic is...

I swung the Vibrationsword at Kaart, but it was blown away midway due to the immense release of magical power.

"Shin-kun!"

Shizuku was shouting, but I couldn't afford to pay attention to her.

I controlled my posture in midair and landed. Then I looked at Kaart.

"...Seriously..."

Kaart, with a sinister aura and blood-red eyes, was standing there.

"He's... turned into a demon!"
