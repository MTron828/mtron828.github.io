 fun activities
for a family of 4 to do indoors on a rainy day

It happened during the day when Sylvester invited Allen and the others to the Walford family again.

"Hey, Walford."

During lunch break, after finishing his meal and visiting the restroom, Sylvester found himself surrounded by several male students.

These were his classmates, probably from the Earl's family or Viscount's family, Sylvester calmly observed while being encircled.

"What is it?"

Sylvester remained calm because he had been learning martial arts from Shin since he was young.

In place of the busy Shin, Christina, Miranda, and sometimes even the former Sword Saint Michelle had trained Sylvester.

Merida had expressed her displeasure about Sylvester following in Shin's footsteps, but because he was a child of the Walford family, danger was always present, so he continued to learn self-defense.

Even when surrounded by first-year students at the elementary academy, Sylvester didn't find it particularly frightening.

So he was calm, but he couldn't help but notice that the classmates surrounding him were grinning oddly.

He was about to ask them what was going on when they threw a shocking statement at him.

"Hey, you. Don't act all high and mighty when you're not even a real Walford!"

The moment Sylvester heard those words, his thoughts came to a standstill.

"â€¦Huh?"

Dumbfounded, Sylvester muttered just that, and his classmates who had surrounded him burst into laughter.

"You're lame! You didn't know, did you!?"

"We know! You're the adopted child of the Demon Lord and the Holy Maiden! A foundling like you!!"

"Somebody like that pretending to be close to royalty is so cheeky!"

The words of his classmates, berating him one after another, cut deep into Sylvester's heart.

It wasn't being called cheeky that affected him; it was the revelation that he wasn't the child of his father, Shin, and his mother, Sisily.

And for the first time, he recalled Charlotte and Sean.

Charlotte had black hair and facial features similar to Shin, her father.

Sean, whose facial features had become more apparent recently, had blue hair and facial features resembling Sisily, his mother.

And what about himself?

He had silver hair and facial features that didn't resemble either of them much.

He had always grown up with the confidence of being loved by both his parents, so he had never doubted it.

If that were true...

Sylvester's face turned pale in shock.

Seeing this, his classmates, who had surrounded him, seemed to feel satisfied and, while hurling derogatory remarks like "Got it!" "Know your place!" "Adopted child!" at him, they left.

Sylvester, who had been dazed for a while, eventually returned to the classroom with unsteady steps.

"Huh? You're late, Silver... Hey, what's wrong!?"

Upon entering the classroom, Allen, who had just returned, called out to Sylvester, raising his voice in response to Sylvester's unusual condition.

"Huh?"

"What? No 'huh'! Your face is as white as a ghost!"

As Allen said this, the eyes of the entire class were focused on Sylvester.

Among those gazes were the students who had insulted Sylvester earlier, and they were now grinning. But...

"Sylvan, are you okay?"

"Terrible! We need to take him to the infirmary right away!"

"I'll take him!"

The female students became quite noisy, and the faces of the classmates who had been grinning inappropriately quickly contorted when they saw this.

"Sorry, but I'll take him to the infirmary. I might be able to get him out of class early, so could someone please fetch Sylvester's belongings?"

As Allen supported Sylvester and said this, there was a rush among the girls to lay claim to Sylvester's things.

The classmates who had taunted Sylvester earlier couldn't help but grumble inwardly, "Why does an adopted kid like him get so much attention?"

And the reason Sylvester was popular was because everyone believed he was the child of the Demon Lord, Shin, and the Holy Maiden, Sisily. They needed to correct their mistake.

The school contacted the Walford family and Sylvester was sent home early based on the assessment of the infirmary's doctor, who deemed it necessary.

Allen and the female students, who had won the battle for Sylvester's belongings, returned to the classroom, discussing Sylvester's condition with comments like, "I hope Sylvan is okay..." and "Poor Sylvan."

Upon entering the classroom, primarily the female students surrounded Allen and Sylvester, inquiring about Sylvester's well-being.

At that moment, a loud voice echoed in the classroom.

"Don't be fooled, everyone! Sylvester is an adopted child of the Walford family! He's a foundling!"

The voice of the classmate shouting these words silenced the room, which had been noisy just moments before.

"Sylvester may go by the name Walford, but he's not the real child of the Demon Lord and the Holy Maiden! There's no need to fawn over him!"

The classmate who had shouted this appeared quite pleased with themselves.

They had corrected everyone's mistake, performed an act of justice, and felt fully satisfied with their actions.

However, when they surveyed the reactions of their peers, it was not what they had expected. They were met with cold, disdainful glares, particularly from the female students.

Why?

They soon found out why.

"Huh? Everyone knows that, though."

"Sylvan being an adopted child is common knowledge."

"He's the 'Miracle Child' who survived the War of the Demon King, right? That's incredible!"

"The Demon Lord and the Holy Maiden protected Sylvan as the only survivor in the former imperial capital and raised him as their own child, right? What's the problem?"

"Actually, Sylvan being the child of the Demon Lord and the Holy Maiden doesn't even matter. Sylvan is Sylvan, and that's what makes him wonderful!"

"What are you misunderstanding?"

When Sylvester received contemptuous looks and comments from the female students who admired him, unaware of this well-known story, the male students raised their voices.

"Besides, what's wrong with being an adopted child?"

"Noble families sometimes adopt children from their relatives when they lack heirs, don't they?"

"Huh? Your family discriminates against adopted children or something?"

"Seriously?"

In the Arlside Elementary Academy, where there were many children from noble families, adoption was a common topic.

The male students were surprised that their classmates would make such discriminatory comments.

"Eh... eh..."

The students who had hurled insults at Sylvester were bewildered by the unexpected turn of events.

Several students were flustered by the unexpected situation, and Allen realized that these were the individuals who had entered the classroom just before Sylvester returned.

After that, Sylvester, being transported to the infirmary, was determined to leave school early by the decision of the infirmary's physician. The news was relayed to the Walford family, and Sylvester left in a carriage to return home.

Upon witnessing this, Allen and the female students who had won the competition for Sylvester's belongings returned to the classroom and were surrounded by students inquiring about Sylvester's condition.

At that moment, a loud voice rang out in the classroom.

"Everyone, don't be deceived! Sylvester is an adopted child of the Walford family! He's an orphan!"

"Uh..."

"What did you do to Sylvan!?"

"Eh, um..."

"Tell the truth!! What did you guys do to Sylvan!!"

Allen grabbed the collar of the student who had insulted Sylvester earlier and shouted at them, bringing his face close to theirs.

The anger of Allen, a member of the Marquis's family, made the children from the Earl's and Viscount's families tremble.

"Uh... I..."

Allen glared at them for a while, rendering them unable to speak properly due to his anger. But then he noticed something and released the collar he had been gripping.

He looked down at the students who had fallen to the ground and seemed unable to get up, their backsides on the floor, as if their strength had left them.

"I will report this to my father. There will be protests at your houses, I'm sure. And..."

Allen said with a frown.

"Go to the infirmary and get some spare clothes."

Saying this, he distanced himself from the students who had fallen and trembled in fear of Allen's anger.

Allen couldn't help but worry about his best friend Sylvester, who had left early. Other classmates, especially the male students, looked at Allen with respect for defending Sylvester, despite his low commoner status.

The female students had their own thoughts.

"Silver and Allen, huh..."

"Friendship? Or maybe..."

"Eek! I feel like I'll see the two of them differently starting tomorrow!"

Allen had no knowledge of the scary conversations that were taking place about him and Sylvester. a fun fact
