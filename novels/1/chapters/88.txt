 a fun fact
about the Roman Empire

After parting ways with everyone, I strolled aimlessly through Frägerl's town, going here and there. I visited various shops, but in truth, I didn't intend to buy a present here. I roamed around, looking for something that hasn't hit the market yet to create and give as a gift. I'll be making it at the Bean Workshop, though.

Lately, I've been indulging in my own whims. My old man already reassured me, saying he's making several times the profit from last year, so I can relax. The products created by the workshop professionals are truly beautiful. But I don't want to be just the one receiving, so maybe I should aim to create something that can be sold as a product later.

With that decided, I resumed my exploration. I heard that there are many workshops in this town that have "branches" in the royal capital. When I first arrived in the capital, I explored various places, but now I see that there are "main stores" in different locations that surpass those branches.

Inside the stores, they sell the latest clothing, shoes, bags, accessories, and other items that haven't yet made their way to the royal capital. The ladies must be thrilled. In the end, we're all going out in the city with female companions, so it'll be interesting to see how fatigued they are when we meet up.

By the way, since everyone has a wireless communication device, we've decided to use that to coordinate our meeting place. The three newcomers who saw this were quite amazed. Lilia said something like, "If they can create things like this, I can accept the existence of mass destruction weapons..." and so on.

Setting that aside, I visited a few magic item shops. If I don't check out the regular magic item shops, I won't know what they have and what they don't. Among several magic item shops, I entered one, and there were various magic items on display.

Nowadays, there are magic items for water supply, stove, and the magic items that popularized bathing in ordinary households. Most of the magic items that improve daily life are said to be inventions by Grandma. I felt proud once again of Grandma, who used her powers for the betterment of everyone's lives.

But more importantly, I need to decide on a present. As I looked again at the magic items displayed in the store, my eyes were drawn to something.

"This is something that every ordinary household has. I've seen it not only in this magic item store but also in other shops. However, I haven't seen the advanced version of it in this store or the previous one."

"Are you looking for something specific?"

"Ah, well, is this magic item only available here?"

"This... yes, it's only available here. Why do you ask?"

"No... is it a popular item?"

"Well, to be honest, it's not something that comes up very often. Every household already has one, and having one is sufficient."

"So, it's not essential?"

"Well, not really."

I see. In that case, it shouldn't be a problem to create an advanced version of this. Since there's likely no specialized market for this tool, I doubt there are any specialists for it. I think I'll choose this for Cecily and Maria's presents.

"Sorry for the strange questions. I'll have a look around the other stores, so I'll take my leave."

"Oh, sure. We look forward to your next visit."

In the end, I just browsed around. But it was informative.

Now, the only remaining gift is for Mark. Actually, I've had this one planned for a while. Since Mark stopped his blacksmith training and started taking up hobbyist metalworking like jewelry crafting, I'm thinking of giving him a tool that makes the carving process, which he does with blade-like tools, easier.

There's something about tools that tickles a man's heart, isn't there? There was a time when I seriously considered buying a toolset worth tens of thousands, even though I had no use for it.

If it's a new tool, Mark, who was born and raised in the workshop, would surely appreciate it. I pictured the three of them receiving their presents with joy and had a smug smile on my face as a result. As I did, a carriage passed by.

A carriage...?

While Shin had already decided on his gift and was thinking of something upon seeing a carriage, Thor, who was on a date with his fiancée Karen after a long time, was restless and fidgety.

"Oh, Thor. We haven't seen each other in a while, and you're being so distracted."

"Uh, sorry, Karen. It's just that I can't help but worry when Shin is left to his own devices..."

"Come on, you worry too much."

"You're too naive, Karen! Shin is always running ahead, zigzagging just a bit beyond our imagination! I can't even imagine what he'll come up with next!"

"Huh, really?"

Karen thought Thor was saying some pretty harsh things, but she was also pleased that Thor was expressing his candid thoughts about his friend.

From the exchange they had when everyone was gathered earlier, it seemed that Thor's comments weren't just behind Shin's back, but were directed at Shin himself.

Shin Wolford was truly an unreserved friend to Thor, he realized once again.

As for Thor:

"If it's Shin, it wouldn't be surprising if he created a flying vehicle."

"Flying!?"

Suddenly, he started talking about imaginary vehicles.

"Yes. Shin himself can use levitation magic. That means he can also bestow it."

"…So the rumors were true. The Ultimate Magicians can fly and teleport. I was really surprised when I saw the teleportation a while ago..."

"Gate magic is something that all Ultimate Magicians can do. But Shin is the only one who can use levitation magic."

"That gate magic is already impressive enough, I think..."

"Shin's explanations are easy to understand. When I heard the theory behind Gate magic, I was amazed."

"Haha, he really is amazing."

As Thor talked about Shin's greatness, it was a different tone from when he was complaining earlier, and Karen could see the respect in his words.

Thor, who was teased by Karen about his reaction, continued to speak to negate her words.

"Well, with someone who thinks on a level that's beyond the reach of ordinary people, it's natural to be worried about what he'll come up with."

"Wolford-kun is also running a company by himself, so I don't think he'll act recklessly."

"Is that so...?"

"Yes. So, look! For now, escort me properly, okay? After all, I'm soon going to be the lady of a territory where I'll be married."

"Ugh... R-right, got it."

With the words whispered into his ear that she would be marrying him soon, Thor blushed and continued to escort Karen.

Karen couldn't help but be moved by Thor's words, and she had an impulse to hug him. However, as the townspeople recognized Thor and approached him one after another, she managed to restrain herself. The people in her territory naturally knew that their heir had become a hero. So, when their pride and joy appeared in the town, the townspeople couldn't just leave him be. As Thor, a little embarrassed, responded to the praises of the townspeople, Karen, watching him, decided she would definitely cuddle him later.

"Hmm? I suddenly felt a chill... Huh! Could it be that Lord Shin has come up with something?"

Thor was gripped by a sense of misplaced premonition.

For Julius and Sarah, the samurai couple, strolling through the town together was a first-time experience. Despite Julius being a muscular mage, Sarah was the heiress of a high-ranking noble, the daughter of a count. They had never considered going out together as a couple. However, Julius belonged to the Ultimate Magicians, possessing power far beyond the average person, and it was judged that they didn't need protection. In fact, he was stronger than any escort. That's why this was their first-ever date alone...

"Sarah, come to my side. It's hard to talk when you're walking behind."

"But Lord Julius, is it not improper for a lady to walk alongside a man?"

"What era are you talking about? Come and walk beside me."

"Yes... My apologies."

Although her usual manner was polite, it seemed that it was a result of her using honorific language. She adopted a lordly tone when addressing Sarah, who didn't require such formal language. As a daughter of a martial family, Sarah prioritized elevating the status of men above all else. Thus, she considered it disrespectful and indecent to walk beside Julius. Sarah's family seemed to have a unique sense of values.

"By the way, Lord Julius, you seem to be quite cheerful."

"Hmm, yes. When I'm with everyone, especially with Lord Shin, it's not boring."

Sarah witnessed Julius talking happily about his male classmates for the first time.

Julius' family owned a territory in one of the kingdom's top luxury resort areas. In addition, he served as the aide to the crown prince.

Despite having a title that had no equal, Julius didn't have any acquaintances his age apart from August and Thor based on his appearance and speech. While it could be said that it was the nature of the nobility's offspring, making friends was still preferable.

But what surprised Sarah wasn't just that.

"Even Elizabeth-sama seems to be quite at ease."

"That's right. Ellie-sama is the one enjoying the most, I believe."

In terms of titles, Ellie outranked her. Her family was the highest-ranking nobility, a duke's family, and she was the fiancée of the crown prince. She was one of the most important figures in the kingdom. Her being accompanied by a noticeable escort was only fitting.

However, such a person was being teased and laughing with commoners like Alice and Lynn, having a genuinely good time. Moreover, the crown prince, August, was engaging in a casual conversation with Shin, the hero's grandson, no matter how much they joked. It was hard to believe.

For a moment, Sarah even wondered if it was a different person with the same name and appearance. However, as she spent some time in this atmosphere, she began to understand. The center of this group was Shin.

He had the status of a sage and an archmage, being the grandchild of Arsheid and, by extension, a world hero. He was a mage known as the "Demon Lord" and the "Messenger of God." However, rather than becoming arrogant in response to such praise, he exhibited humility and a sense of embarrassment. It was because of such a person being at the center that this group transcended social status boundaries.

Julius was also part of this group. Sarah felt like she could fit into this circle as well. With that thought, she suddenly couldn't hide her smile.

"Hmm? What's wrong, Sarah? You suddenly have a grin on your face."

"No, it's nothing."

"Is that so?"

A bright future was waiting. Sarah couldn't help but reveal her smile in anticipation.

"Sigh..."

"What's wrong, Lilia? Why the sigh?"

"It feels like I've finally been released, that's why I'm sighing."

"Is that so?"

"Maybe Tony is used to it, but that group is extraordinary."

"Huh?"

Lilia had been invited by Tony to go shopping, so she casually followed him, only to find herself thrown into a rather unusual group. Once they were alone, she let out a sigh of relief.

Tony, who had been hanging out with the same people since entering the Advanced Magic Academy, had grown so accustomed to them that he lacked self-awareness. Lilia sighed at this as well.

"You're a member of the royal family and nobility, not to mention the grandson of a hero. What kind of group is this?"

"Yeah, now that you mention it, you're right."

"I can't believe you didn't realize it until it was pointed out... How clueless can you be?"

"Still, I try to be cautious around His Highness, but when I see His Highness interacting with Shin, he doesn't come across as royal at all."

"What!? What are you saying? He's the Crown Prince, the future king! How can you forget that?"

From the perspective of ordinary citizens, the royalty were high above the clouds, and seeing their faces directly was considered lucky. If they spoke to you, you could pass down the story for generations. Tony had been having a conversation with such a figure with surprising ease. Lilia had been nervous that Tony's lack of respect might get them into trouble.

However, August himself sometimes seemed to forget that he was of royal blood. Lilia wished she could tell him to return the favor for all the concern he was causing.

"Well, I think it's undoubtedly Shin's fault that His Highness has turned out like that."

"Shin Wolford?"

"Yeah, because Shin treats not only His Highness but also His Majesty the same way. He calls His Majesty 'Uncle Dis.'"

"Uncle...? Is that okay?"

"Well, it seems like His Majesty treated Shin as a relative rather than as a king."

"What kind of person is Wolford?"

Referring to the reigning king as "Uncle" and engaging in casual conversations with the crown prince. To Lilia, the person Shin Wolford seemed like an extraordinary individual.

"It's hard to say... He's a good guy, I guess."

"I can somewhat understand that, but..."

"But his thoughts are way out there... He tries to be self-restrained, but he can't seem to manage it..."

"Ha... Are you praising him or criticizing him?"

As Tony tried to explain, Lilia couldn't help but burst into laughter at his description of Shin as a good guy with wild thoughts.

Tony, who had been laughed at, scratched his head and continued to speak.

"You know, he's definitely a good guy as a person. It's just that his ideas for magic and magical tools are a bit out of the ordinary. He gets scolded by Lady Merida quite often."

As Tony said this while walking, he suddenly realized that Lilia was no longer walking beside him. He turned around to see Lilia standing still in one place.

"Huh? What's wrong, Lilia?"

"Tony... Lady Merida..."

"Huh? Oh, well, I've been to Shin's house quite a bit, so I've met Lady Merida a few t- Wait, wha—!?"

Suddenly, Lilia dashed towards Tony and grabbed his collar.

"You sneak! How dare you be the only one who knows Lady Merida!"

Lilia's eyes were dangerous. Despite her deep admiration for Merida, she couldn't help but feel jealous of Tony, who had become acquainted with her.

"Ugh... C-Calm down... There's nothing I can do about it..."

"I want to get to know Lady Merida too!"

"Maybe you can..."

"Huh?"

To become acquainted with Merida. With those words, Lilia finally calmed down. Tony continued.

"Ahem... Well, you're coming to Shin and the others' birthday party next time, right? It's going to be at Shin's house, so you'll be able to talk to Lady Merida. I'm sure of it."

"Really? What should I say? What should I do?"

"Well, I think anything would be fine, wouldn't it?"

"Oh, this is like a dream... Meeting Lady Merida!"

From being completely consumed by jealousy just a moment ago, her eyes were now sparkling.

Seeing this transformation, Tony couldn't help but smile wryly.

"If I had known it would be like this, I would have just told you I could introduce you to Lady Merida without going through all this trouble."

"How rude! But I can't deny it!"

Fulfilling her wish and finally becoming her friend, the unexpected side of the girl left Tony bewildered.

"Anyway, the main event is Shin and the others' birthday, you know."

Looking at her happily, he let out a sigh.

Meanwhile, the Crown Prince, accompanied by his fiancée and his younger sister, the Princess, said:

"Ah... Your Highness August, how about this one?"

"Yeah... I guess it's fine."

"Big brother! This one is cute too!"

"Yeah... I guess it's fine."

"Which one do you prefer, this one or this one?"

"Yeah... I guess it's fine."

"Big brother, after this, I want to have a parfait, and big brother, you're treating!"

"Yeah... I guess it's fine."

"Yay!"

"Your Highness August..."

He accompanied the two girls on their shopping trip, wearing a deadpan expression.
