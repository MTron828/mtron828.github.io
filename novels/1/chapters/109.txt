The Knight Cadet Officer Academy, one of the three major advanced academies in the capital of Aelsthyde, is a prestigious institution dedicated to training officers for the Knight Orders.

Officer roles in the Knight Orders demand not only command skills but also considerable martial prowess. Therefore, the students undergo rigorous and demanding training on a daily basis.

In this historically renowned Knight Cadet Officer Academy, the second female student to become the top student in her year since the idolized Christina Hayden has emerged. Her name is Miranda Wallace, and her classmates strive to compete with her and surpass her every day.

One day, a male student from the same S class called out to Miranda.

"Hey, Miranda."

"What?"

When she inquired about the reason, the male student's voice grew agitated.

"What's taking you so long to introduce us to the girls from the Magic Academy?"

Miranda felt a sense of exhaustion in response to the request from this frustrated male student.

Miranda, who became the top student in her year when she advanced two grades, had expected to be challenged regularly by her male classmates who aimed to reclaim that position. However, instead of challenges, she was inundated with one demand: to introduce them to the girls from the Magic Academy.

While the students at the Knight Academy are often perceived as valuing strong physical training and swordsmanship due to their nature, the fact remains that these students are between the ages of fifteen and eighteen. They are in the midst of adolescence. Moreover, considering the gender ratio, the majority of the male students are eager for companionship.

Miranda couldn't help but glare at one of the male students who were eager for female companionship.

"Look, I get it, I'm friends with Maria from the Magic Academy. But, you know, all the other girls I know from the Magic Academy are Ultimate Magicians as well."

"Oh, really?"

"What? Are you asking me to introduce you to the Ultimate Magician girls?"

"Uh, no, that's..."

Ultimate Magicians were such a prestigious presence that they were known worldwide, not just in Aelsthyde. Their otherworldly abilities had made the girls among them practically idols.

To approach such figures...

"That's pretty bold."

"Grr..."

Maria and the other female Ultimate Magicians were always on the lookout for boyfriends. However, due to the world increasingly seeing them in a divine light, they had no idea what kind of punishment they might face if someone dared to approach them. Unwittingly, Maria and the others had ended up in a highly undesired situation.

"Darn it... I thought it was a golden opportunity to get close to girls!"

The male student was even more frustrated than when he had lost his position as class representative to Miranda.

Miranda sighed in response to the pitiful sight he presented.

"Sigh... Then why don't you try convincing everyone else?"

Incredulously, she suggested that he make an effort to be just as impressive as the Ultimate Magician girls.

"Oh, I see! I'll become someone who can date Ultimate Magician girls without anyone complaining!"

The male student's exclamation caught the attention of other students who had been eavesdropping.

"Hey! Is that story for real?"

"Are you saying you can introduce us to Ultimate Magician girls if we try hard enough?"

"Huh? No, I never said..."

Misinterpreting her words, the male students reacted with confusion.

"I'll do it!"

"Don't joke! I'm the one who's going to be introduced!"

"No, it's me!"

Miranda never said anything like that, but the male students who had a strong desire to get closer to girls took her words that way and suddenly became excited.

Seeing this scene, Miranda couldn't help but think, "How foolish they are."

She remembered the words of someone she greatly respected. "Aren't there any girls here? Am I not a girl?!"

Those words belonged to Christina, the idol of the Knight Academy, who is now revered by everyone. But back when she was a student at the academy, she wasn't treated as a girl by the boys around her. She still carried that with her.

Miranda felt a deep resonance with Christina's words at this moment.

"I'm a girl too, you know..."

Some of the male students heard her murmur, glanced at Miranda for a moment, and then made faces like, "What's she talking about?" before returning to their ruckus.

Internally fuming at their attitude, Miranda vowed that she would never, under any circumstances, introduce them to any girls.

"What is all this commotion?"

Unaware of Miranda's inner determination, one of the instructors entered the classroom where the male students were making a commotion and shouted.

As instructors at the Knight Academy, they were muscular and imposing.

With the instructor's admonition, the classroom fell silent.

Looking out over the now-quiet classroom, the instructor said, "You guys, you should have a little more self-awareness as students of the illustrious Knight Academy! You fools!"

No one dared to defy the instructor they all feared, and everyone hung their heads in silence.

The instructor then turned to Miranda, breaking the silence. "More importantly, is Miranda Wallace here?"

"Yes, I'm here!"

"The Academy Head wants to see you. Hurry to the Academy Head's office."

Being suddenly called by name was surprising enough, but the content of the message was even more shocking.

A summons to the Academy Head's office.

Still bewildered, Miranda tried to reply, but the instructor raised his voice, "What's your answer?"

"Yes, understood! Miranda Wallace will head to the Academy Head's office immediately!"

With a hasty salute, Miranda left the classroom and made her way to the Academy Head's office.

Once the instructor who had witnessed this left the classroom, the remaining male students were left in a state of confusion.

"What did Miranda do?"

"I don't know, but... being called by the Academy Head is quite something."

"Don't tell me... she's getting expelled?"

While being summoned by instructors occasionally happened, being summoned by the Academy Head was quite rare. Among the male students, there were concerned voices regarding Miranda's summons.

"If Miranda gets expelled... the connection with the Ultimate Magicians' girls..."

"Yeah... if that happens..."

"This is a serious situation..."

The male students, as usual, were only thinking about girls.

"What on earth is this?"

Unaware of the rather cruel concerns from the male students in the classroom, Miranda, who was standing in front of the Academy Head's office, was anxiously wondering why she had been called here.

She couldn't knock on the door for quite some time, but she gathered her courage and knocked on the door.

"Yes?"

"I-It's Miranda Wallace!"

"Oh, you've come. Come in."

"Th-Thank you."

Surprisingly, the voice of the Academy Head from inside sounded cheerful.

While she was puzzled by this, she opened the door to the Academy Head's office.

Inside, there was the former Knight who now served as the Academy Head.

Although he had retired a while ago, being an ex-Knight and having served on battlefields gave him a unique, sharp look. Miranda almost felt overwhelmed by his presence.

"You came. Well, please have a seat."

"Yes! Th-Thank you."

Perhaps out of consideration for the visibly nervous Miranda, the Academy Head kindly urged her to sit on the sofa despite his imposing appearance.

Despite her lingering tension, Miranda sat on the sofa. Even though she was called in, she couldn't help but wonder why.

Seeing Miranda's extreme nervousness, the Academy Head decided to speak in a gentle tone. "Well, I understand it might be hard to stay calm when you're suddenly summoned to the Academy Head's office, but don't worry. I didn't call you here to punish you."

"R-Really?"

"What's wrong? Do you have some reason to believe you're being punished?"

"N-No! Absolutely not!"

Seeing Miranda hastily stand up, the Academy Head laughed and continued, "Hahaha. I know you're not. I've heard quite a bit about you, the student who reached the top of the class through unwavering effort."

"Haa..."

"Being close to Maria, the 'Valkyrie' of the Ultimate Magicians, right?"

"D-Did you know about that?"

"And you received a special weapon from the 'Demon Lord' Walford."

Saying so, the Academy Head stared at Miranda's face.

Under that gaze, Miranda became increasingly uneasy. Why? Because the Vibrationsword she had received from Shin was considered a heretical weapon in the Knight Order. Would she be reprimanded for accepting and using such a weapon? No, he said earlier that he didn't call her to scold her, but then why was he bringing this up now? Various thoughts were swirling in her mind.

Observing Miranda's confused state, the Academy Head chuckled.

"Rest assured. I already said I didn't call you here to scold or punish you."

"Th-Then, what is the purpose of this meeting?"

"Yes. The other day, a disaster-class demon appeared in the former imperial capital, along with many other powerful demons."

"Yes, it's currently the hot topic all over the capital."

"And the leader of the demons, Oliver Strom, has challenged humanity to a battle that could determine our very survival."

"Yes..."

Currently, not only in the capital of Arlside, but around the world, this topic was making headlines.

A battle for the survival of humanity.

If they win, humanity triumphs.

If they lose...

"In this battle, we must absolutely emerge victorious."

"Yes."

"So, after discussions among the leaders of various nations... it was decided that you would provide the weapon you received from Lord Walford to the armed forces of various countries."

"Is that so..."

The Academy Head was telling a student like Miranda about what was decided in a recent international conference. The whole situation was unclear, and she couldn't help but feel like it was almost a matter of super-national secrecy. Miranda started to feel uncomfortable and strained, thinking if it was even appropriate for her to hear such information.

Unaware of Miranda's reaction, the Academy Head continued.

"Yes, we heard that it's an extremely powerful weapon, but there's no one available to provide instructions on how to use it."

Finally, Miranda began to understand after hearing this much.

And then, the idea that had produced an unbelievable result was immediately swept from her mind.

I mean, the thought of her, Miranda, providing guidance on how to use the Vibrationsword to the armed forces of various nations... "This is an unbelievable turn of events!?"

The idea that she had so quickly dismissed as impossible was now presented to her directly by the Academy Head.

"What? Were you expecting this? Well, I'll make it quick. We'll give the academy a short break, so you can work for the sake of humanity to your heart's content. A messenger from the royal palace will come to your home to provide more details. That's all I have to say."

It seemed that Miranda had no authority to make decisions in this matter, as the decision had already been made.

"Th-Thank you for your time..."

Miranda, feeling a bit dazed, left the Academy Head's office. As she pondered the factors that had brought things to this point, she muttered with a tinge of resentment:

"W-Walford... this is all your fault..."

Miranda had decided that she would go and voice her complaints to Shin later on.
