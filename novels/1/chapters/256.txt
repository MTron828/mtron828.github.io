 a fun fact
about the Roman Empire

August received an investigation report from Willer and, upon reading its contents, he involuntarily widened his eyes and furrowed his brows.

"Could it be... they haven't given up yet..."

When August saw the name of the main culprit mentioned in the report, he regretted underestimating the tenacity of humans.

Just a few days ago, when this topic came up in a conversation with Shin, what had he answered?

"It's not a big deal."

He had said something like that with full confidence.

And now, he was in this sorry state.

August placed the report on his desk, pressed his forehead with his hand in frustration, and let out a deep sigh.

At that moment, Willer spoke up.

"Your Highness, we already have all the evidence, and the background investigation is complete. Our investigators are ready, and we can move for an arrest immediately."

In response to Willer's words, August raised his head.

"Brooding over my incompetence here won't help. Let's go right away."

"Yes, Your Highness!"

Following his orders, the investigators quickly assembled in August's office.

"From here, we'll use the gate to reach the city where the main culprit is. The investigators will go straight to the culprit's location and apprehend them. Do not let them harm themselves!"

"Yes, sir!"

After receiving the response from the investigators, August promptly opened the gate.

Their destination was the "Doville Count's Territory."

August, who operated as an Ultimate Magician, had arranged gates to the major cities within the Earlsheid Kingdom, and he also received requests from the residents of the Doville Count's Territory. So, they could reach their destination swiftly.

A large group of investigators raced through the city, making their way to the Lord's mansion.

All of them were wearing the uniform of the Security Bureau, and they had carefully selected investigators with a physique suited for apprehension. This display of force surprised the residents of Doville, who quickly made way for them.

As a result, they smoothly reached the Lord's mansion.

Upon arriving at the mansion, the gatekeeper was unable to hide his surprise when he saw the numerous, well-built investigators.

"W-What's the meaning of this, with so many Security Bureau investigators? What do you need?"

Caught off guard by the unprecedented situation, the gatekeeper inquired about the reason for their visit.

In response, Willer stepped forward with documents in hand.

"This is Security Bureau Director Dennis Willer speaking. We have an arrest warrant for the Earl of Doville, the owner of this mansion. Notify him immediately!"

"An... arrest warrant!?"

The Security Bureau Director had personally arrived with an arrest warrant.

In the face of this unbelievable situation, the gatekeeper, who considered it a serious matter, hesitated. However, the gatekeeper was the private guard of the nobility, and his employer was the Count of Doville, not the kingdom, so he attempted some resistance.

"Even if there's an arrest warrant, this is the Count's estate. We can't just let you in like that..."

As the gatekeeper spoke, the investigators' demeanor became tense. They seemed ready to spring into action at any moment.

But just as the gatekeeper was locked in a standoff with the investigators, a person wearing the Security Bureau uniform stepped forward from the group.

"I am August von Earlsheid, the Crown Prince of the Earlsheid Kingdom. I won't repeat myself; open the gate immediately."

"Oh, Your Highness, the Crown Prince!?"

After the Security Bureau Director, now, the Crown Prince had made an appearance.

Though confused by the situation, the butler recognized the person who had identified himself as the Crown Prince. It was indeed Crown Prince August.

"P-Please..."

Making his judgment, the gatekeeper retracted his earlier statement and opened the gate.

"Let's go!"

Upon seeing this, Willer gave the command, and the investigators rushed into the Doville Count's mansion.

Inside, the servants were taken aback.

"W-Who are you people!? Do you think it's okay to cause such a ruckus in the Count's mansion!?"

Amidst the commotion among the servants, an elderly butler stood before Willer and the others.

"I am Security Bureau Director Dennis Willer. We have an arrest warrant for the Earl of Doville. This has been approved by the court and His Majesty, King Deseum. Show us the way to the Earl of Doville immediately!"

"His, His Majesty!?"

Upon examining the arrest warrant presented by Willer, the butler confirmed the royal seal, which left him deeply agitated.

Under normal circumstances, arrest warrants and search warrants were issued by the court, but they never bore the royal seal.

In this case, due to the attempted assassination of the Crown Princess and the fact that the culprit was a noble with a high title like the Earl, the King himself had authorized the investigation to prevent interference.

However, the butler found it difficult to believe the unprecedented situation.

"E-Even with an arrest warrant like this, the royal seal... No matter how high your position, Director of the Security Bureau, forging the royal seal is a grave crime!"

He began to protest the authenticity of the arrest warrant and the royal seal, but his objections were quickly silenced.

"It's not a forgery. I personally requested this."

As August stood beside Willer, the butler's eyes widened in astonishment.

"Y-Your Highness..."

"Now that you're certain this arrest warrant isn't a forgery, show us the way to the Earl of Doville immediately."

August's words were calm, but his anger at the interference with the investigation was evident. The butler, intimidated, silently led them to the office.

Upon reaching the office, the group did not immediately enter.

Sounds were coming from inside.

"What's the meaning of this, Father!! That fox is still sitting on the Crown Princess's throne, isn't she?"

"Ugh, that useless woman, has she failed...?"

"This means that Elizabeth's security will become even tighter, doesn't it?! Father, there's no choice but to detonate someone else now!"

"True... Let's proceed with the next selection."

Just as they overheard this conversation, Willer signaled to halt their actions.

"What's going on?"

"Master, there is a guest."

"Guest? There was no appointment for a visitor today... Ah, that merchant. Very well, let him in."

With the Earl of Doville's consent, the butler opened the door to the office.

Upon confirming the opened door, the Earl of Doville directed his words toward the incoming person.

"You, how dare you assign such a useless person..."

However, as he spoke and raised his gaze, the Earl of Doville finally realized that the person who had entered was not the aforementioned merchant.

"W-Who are you!?"

"I am Security Bureau Director Dennis Willer."

As soon as he heard the words "Security Bureau," the Earl's heart began to race.

Why was the Security Bureau's Director, of all people, here? Could it be that this matter had come to light?

No, however, I've heard that the perpetrator has taken the perpetrator's family hostage, and besides, crimes committed through magic leave no evidence. I've also heard that they've taken meticulous care to avoid leaving any decisive witness information. So there should be no risk of exposure.

Thinking this far, the Count of Doville likely assumed that Willer was here for a different matter. He tried to maintain his composure and hide his inner unease while responding to Willer.

"My, my, why would the Director of the Security Bureau bother to come in person? What kind of major event has occurred?"

Although the Count's intentions were transparent, Willer restrained his inner anger and responded, "Oh? The Count doesn't know about such a major event that is shaking the entire kingdom?"

"Well, I wonder if there was such a major event that required me to hear about it?"

The Count was sticking to his story, but he froze upon hearing Willer's next words.

"It's the attempted assassination of Princess Elizabeth, the Crown Prince's Consort."

"What!?"

Seeing the certainty in Willer's assertion, the Count realized that Willer believed him to be involved in this matter and desperately tried to think of a way out.

But...

"Oh my! Isn't that Crown Prince August! Oh, so you've come to pick me up after all!"

His daughter Natalie noticed August, who was standing behind Willer, and spoke to him.

"Natalie!"

The Count hastily called his daughter's name, but Natalie, filled with the excitement of meeting August, was oblivious to her father's anxiety.

"What's the matter, Father? Finally, Crown Prince August is switching from that arrogant Elizabeth to me! Please don't interfere!"

Taken aback by Natalie's brashness, the Count momentarily hesitated.

That hesitation was the Count of Doville's decisive mistake.

"Oh? Why do you think I came to pick you up?"

In response to August's question, Natalie was briefly baffled, then laughed and answered.

"Because if Elizabeth was attacked and came to me immediately, it means the baby in her belly must have been lost, right? If that's the case, the next Crown Princess can only be me, can't it?"

Natalie delivered this with a radiant smile, but August's reaction was icy.

"You as the Crown Princess? Spare me the joke."

"So, Your Highness?"

Natalie was taken aback, but she finally realized that August's gaze towards her was incredibly cold.

"W-Why..."

"Why? You seem to have some misunderstanding."

"Misunderstanding?"

"Yes, Ellie is perfectly fine, and the baby is unharmed. Why did you have such a misunderstanding?"

With a cruel expression, August spoke, and Natalie became greatly agitated. She stammered as she tried to explain.

"It's just that I... I thought, since Elizabeth-sama was attacked by bandits, even if she didn't pass away, she might be seriously injured, and... I thought the baby might not be safe..."

"Oh? Why did you have such a misunderstanding? Ellie is unharmed, and the baby is safe."

When August said that, Natalie couldn't help but exclaim, "That's not true!! It's a lie!! The merchant undoubtedly inflicted serious injuries..."

"Natalie!"

Count Doville hurriedly tried to interrupt Natalie, but it was too late.

"Willer! The Doville Count's daughter has confessed!"

"Yes!"

In response to August's statement, Willer showed the arrest warrant to Count Doville.

"Count Doville and Doville Count's daughter Natalie! You are under arrest on suspicion of the attempted assassination of Princess Elizabeth, the Crown Prince's Consort!"

Upon Willer's command, the investigators who had been on standby immediately apprehended Count Doville and Natalie.

In this world, there was no concept that arresting a female suspect required female investigators to avoid harassment.

Despite her power as the daughter of a count, Natalie was physically weak. In no time, the investigators had her under control.

"Scream!"

"Let go! This is a mistake!"

The same held true for Count Doville, an adult male. There was no match between him, who typically remained locked in his office, and the Security Bureau investigators who trained their bodies daily to confront criminals.

The father and daughter were both quickly restrained by the investigators.

"No! Let go! Who do you think I am!? Father! Help me, Father!"

"Natalie! Damn it! Release us! On what basis are you resorting to such tyranny?"

While being restrained by investigators, Count Doville desperately shouted:

"On what grounds? Didn't Doville Count's daughter just confess?"

August replied, "Your words, but, Your Highness, my daughter did not say such things."

With this retort, Count Doville thought he had won.

Natalie's slip of the tongue was merely a spoken word. Unlike written documents, spoken words could be misheard. If he asserted that it was a mishearing, it would be difficult to refute. Count Doville had engaged in endless debates of this nature with the noble society and merchants. This should work.

He was convinced of his victory.

However...

August suddenly burst into laughter, almost as if he were choking, leaving Count Doville with a puzzled expression.

Then, his spine froze.

The expression on August's face was so wicked that later Willer would say, "It was not an appropriate expression for a crown prince of a country."

Not only Count Doville but also Natalie, who had surely admired August, were horrified.

"Mishearing... Mishearing, huh."

While making such a face, August muttered:

"Yes, yes. That's right. So..."

"Well, Count Doville."

"Yes."

"Do you understand what this is?"

Saying that, August presented a certain magical item in front of Count Doville.

"Why do you have that? I have no idea..."

"This is a magical item made by Shin..."

At August's words, Count Doville and Natalie felt a shiver down their spines.

The Demon King.

God's messenger.

A legendary hero who used incredibly powerful magic that made him seem like a different species from ordinary humans. He created a magical item that no one had ever thought of, and even if they did, they couldn't make it. This hero was already becoming a legend.

Such a device created by this person was right in front of them.

A magical device like this, unlike anything they had seen before, left them anxious because they had no idea what its effects were.

Despite their concerns, August began to speak while looking at the magical device.

"Shin initially made this in a state of disbelief, thinking it was yet another exceptional item... but I never thought it would come in handy in a situation like this."

Saying this, August pressed a switch on the magical device.

"What?! That's a lie!! The merchant definitely inflicted a severe injury..."

"Natalie!!"

"Huh?"

To the sudden sound they heard, Count Doville was left speechless.

What they heard coming from the magical device held by August was undoubtedly the same content as what Natalie had just spoken. Could it be... could this magical device record 'sound'?

If that were the case, it changed everything fundamentally. They had believed that 'spoken words' didn't leave a trace because they were not preserved in any form. However, the evidence presented by August was the spoken words themselves.

While Count Doville was desperately trying to figure out how to escape this predicament, August repeatedly played back the statement. Each time, what they heard was undoubtedly Natalie's voice saying, "I heard from the merchant that she inflicted a severe injury."

Count Doville thought it might be over at this point.

But when Natalie shouted, "Your Highness, please don't tell lies! My voice doesn't sound like this!" a solution suddenly struck Count Doville.

"S-So, Your Highness! Fabricating evidence is unforgivable, no matter what!"

That's right, this was fabricated evidence. If they went with that explanation, they might still have a way out. That's what Count Doville thought. But...

"Hmm. Do you also find something strange about your own voice?"

"Huh?"

Both Count Doville and Natalie tilted their heads in unison.

"Then, another one. Can you listen to this as well?"

August said so and received another recording device from Willer, then played it.

"What's the matter, Father?! That vixen is still occupying the position of Crown Princess!"

"Mm, it seems that useless fellow has failed."

"With this, the protection around that vixen Elizabeth will become even tighter, won't it, Father? There's no other option now but to self-destruct someone else!"

"I see... Shall we proceed with selecting the next candidate?"

"Huh? Father's voice and who?"

"Huh? Me?"

"Huh?"

When Natalie murmured, Count Doville instinctively asked her for clarification and then denied it.

"I-I don't sound like this!"

"What are you talking about, Father? That's not your voice. More importantly, who's the woman talking to you?"

"It's you!"

"Lies! This is not my voice!"

"Understood now?"

August, who had been watching their exchange, asked if they understood.

"What... what does this mean?"

"Shin mentioned this. It seems that the voice you hear when you speak is different from the voice others hear."

"Huh? What?"

"Uh...?"

"I was surprised when I heard my recorded voice for the first time. It sounded like a completely different person's voice, yet everyone around insisted it was my voice. And it's not just me. Everyone we experimented with said the same thing. Do you get it now?"

"S-So... this is undoubtedly my voice?"

"T-This can't be..."

"Well, even a conversation between just the two of you would be sufficient evidence. There was still a possibility of denial, but with this, there's no escaping it."

In response to August's words, Count Doville slumped and Natalie, still restrained, looked around in disbelief.

"Huh? Huh? So, does that mean I will become August's wife..."

Even at this point, when Natalie was saying such things, August wore an exasperated expression.

"The mastermind behind the attempted assassination of the Crown Princess is not going to hold such a position. However, I'll assert one thing—no matter what happens to Ellie, it doesn't mean I will choose you."

August said this, then ordered Willer to "take her away" before leaving the office.

Receiving August's merciless words, Natalie screamed, clinging to him as he walked out.

"No!! August-sama! Why? Why won't you choose me, August-sama!?"

As he left the office and continued to hear Natalie's screams, August let out a deep sigh.

"Who would fall for a woman like you..."

The investigator who overheard this muttered comment from August nodded in agreement. design principles
