Leading the charge and systematically defeating demons with their combined use of swords and magic, Maria and Miranda showcased their prowess.

Watching this display, Tooru and Julius smiled wryly.

"Well, our women do seem to have a penchant for combat."

"Yes, it's probably for the best now. Besides, it seems that our strategy has been proven effective."

"By the way, earlier I received some kind of enhancement from Lord Shin. What was that all about?"

Julius was about to answer Tooru's question when a high-powered magic attack was suddenly directed at them.

"!!"

Reacting swiftly, Tooru and Julius deployed their magic barriers, successfully blocking the incoming magic. However, the power behind the attack made them break out in a cold sweat.

"...While Lord Shin may seem to defeat them effortlessly, well-trained demons are something else."

The two of them acknowledged this, and then observed the area where the magic had been fired.

In front of them, there were many demons, but a group among them had turned to face Tooru and Julius.

"You chatter away during battle... Do you think you can take us lightly?!"

The demon who had unintentionally initiated the exchange grumbled with frustration. Although there was no malice behind their conversation, the fact remained that they had been talking during the battle. This realization prompted Tooru and Julius to refocus their efforts.

"It's quite a complex situation. A demon like you pointing out the obvious."

"Indeed, they are different from the demons we've encountered before."

"Tch! Don't compare us to those failures!"

Perhaps offended by Julius's words, the demon launched another spell. This time, Tooru avoided the magic by utilizing his jet boots for high-speed movement instead of deploying a magic barrier. He immediately countered with a blade of wind magic aimed at the demon.

"Argh!"

The demon, who had anticipated a defensive stance, was caught off guard by Tooru's unorthodox reaction. In haste, they used a magic barrier for protection.

"Ugh... A brat like you using magic of this magnitude!"

Perhaps because they hadn't been in their best condition when they attempted to block the spell, the demon was being pushed back by Tooru's magic.

At that moment:

"I got you!!"

"What!?"

As Julius, who had dodged the magic using jet boots just like Tooru, passed through the opening beside the demon who was deploying a magic barrier, he slipped into the demon's personal space.

"Oh no...!!"

"Nuuaaahhh!!"

Julius cried out while simultaneously activating a gauntlet-turned-magic tool in Shin's hand, swinging his fist.

And then, Julius's fist made contact with the demon's body, resulting in...

A massive explosion.

"...Huh?"

"...Wha..."

In utter disbelief, even Julius, who had caused this situation, froze, while Tooru gaped in astonishment.

As for the demon that was blown away...

"...There's no way it survived."

Within Julius's line of sight lay the remains of a demon, consisting of only its lower half.

After confirming his achievement, Julius activated his jet boots and returned to Tooru's side.

"What... What was that?! You punched someone, and they exploded!"

"Well... I only heard from Lord Shin that the power of my punches would increase."

"Increase the power... That's way too much..."

"I suspect this is a directional explosive magic from Lord Shin. It doesn't trigger by just activating it; it seems to go off upon impact."

"...I just don't understand what goes on in a genius's mind."

"I couldn't agree more. However, this means we've gained a powerful weapon. Let's make the most of it!"

"Yes, let's!"

With this, Tooru and Julius initiated the counterattack. The demons, who had been momentarily stupefied by the unusual occurrence, hastily took a defensive stance when they saw the two charging at them.

"Ugh! These monsters!"

"It's quite impolite to label us as monsters! I'll show you what a real monster can do!!"

As Tooru retaliated with a fire magic spell, the demon decided to evade the attack rather than block it with a magic barrier.

"Ugh! The power of this magic! These inexplicable magical devices! You lot are more monstrous than we are!"

"Are you still saying that?!"

While exchanging spells with one another, Tooru and Julius continued to bicker. Julius was unable to intervene in their magical duel.

However, he had confirmed a while ago that his attacks would be effective against the demons, so he was eagerly waiting for an opportunity to strike.

Yet, standing around thoughtlessly on the battlefield would make them easy targets for the demons. Therefore, he constantly moved with his jet boots while observing the actions of Tooru and Julius.

While Tooru and a demon continued to exchange spells while bickering, the conversation between them seemed to change.

"Are you guys, being demons, perhaps holding onto your rationality quite well? You're different from the commoner demons who act out of anger! Why do you follow someone like Strohm?"

"Hah! Kid, you're missing the point! We became demons because we followed Strohm-sama! It's not like we became demons and then decided to follow Strohm-sama!"

"Even so! Don't you have any resentment towards Strohm for giving such orders? It's almost like he's ordering you to die!"

"Even then! We were saved wholeheartedly by Strohm-sama! If he told us to die, we'd die for him!"

"...You guys are insane."

"Yeah, that's right! We're demons! Every one of us is insane! So, enough chit-chat, let's finish this already!"

Saying so, the demon attempted to release a spell.

But at the next moment, there was an explosion beneath the demon's feet.

"Ugh! W-What's this!?"

Caught off guard by the sudden explosion, the demon momentarily froze.

At that moment.

"Tooru! Do it now!!"

"Right!"

Upon hearing Julius's shout, Tooru unleashed a massive fire magic spell toward the demon.

"What... Guwaaahhh!!"

Due to the sudden ground collapse, the demon was unable to defend or evade. It became enveloped by Tooru's magic.

"Julius, that saved me."

"No problem at all."

"Did you just punch the ground to make it collapse?"

"Yes, that's right. It broadens our tactical options."

"I see."

After some silence, Tooru spoke again.

Honestly, there was a part of me that sympathized with them a bit for being willing to throw their lives away for Strohm's orders. But after that last conversation, I made up my mind."

Tooru then turned to the demons.

"They are insane. They seem to take pleasure in sacrificing their lives for Strohm. Here..."

Tooru said this and began gathering his magic.

"I will finish them all right here!!"

"Oh!!"

After Tooru's rare declaration of annihilation, he unleashed a powerful spell.

Julius, in sync with Tooru, shouted and charged toward the demons.

The battle became even more intense.
