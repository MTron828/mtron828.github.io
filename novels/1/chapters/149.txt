The text you provided appears to be in Japanese. Here's the translation to English:

With a somewhat pale face, I said, and everyone shivered.

"I'm sorry, but this time we can't afford to hold back. I'll unleash my maximum magic with all my might. So, I want everyone to cooperate."

I looked around at everyone and made my request.

Everyone, upon hearing my wish, nodded with serious expressions.

Looking at their slight nervousness, they seem quite cautious.

Well, if that means everyone will put all their effort into pinning down Strom in the air, that's fine with me.

"Um, Waldford-kun. What should I do?"

"Miranda, well..."

What should Miranda, who can't use magic, do?

If we're going to pin Strom in the air, it's essential to be able to use long-range attack magic.

The best option would be for her to use defensive magical tools from a safe distance and take shelter... But to come all this way and be the only one left out...

Just as I was thinking about that, Yuri had a proposal.

"In that case, I'll lend you my magical tools."

"Huh? Yuri-san, are you sure?"

"Of course. Let's fight together until the end."

"I appreciate it."

I see, magical tools.

As someone who can cast attack magic himself, I've mostly focused on developing magical tools for defense and communication, in that direction.

There's also a prohibition on creating offensive magical tools...

I hadn't thought of that approach.

"Is that okay with you, Miranda?"

"Yeah. Let me fight until the end too."

"Alright. In that case... Let's open the door."

Having confirmed the plan for the battle against Strom, I finally reached for the doors of the audience chamber.

The door was quite heavy, as expected from its grand and solid construction, but a few of the men managed to push it open.

And as the door swung open and we entered the audience chamber...

"We've been waiting for you, Shin-Waldford-kun."

Strom was sitting on the throne at the back.

His appearance, which I hadn't seen in about a year, was relaxed, with his legs crossed, elbows resting on the armrest, and chin propped on his hand...

Seeing his relaxed posture, it felt incredibly eerie, as if we were not about to engage in the final battle.

"It seems you've had quite detailed discussions in front of the door, but has the plan come together?"

This is the English translation of the provided text:

"This guy... Could it be that he was eavesdropping on our conversation with magic?"

"Fuh, don't worry, Shin-Waldford-kun. I haven't been eavesdropping."

"What do you mean?"

"If I did something like that..."

Strom said so, shrugged his shoulders, and spread his hands.

"Isn't that a mood spoiler?"

For Strom, this is just a game. He seems to find it more enjoyable not knowing the enemy's strategy.

"You seem quite relaxed. From what I heard on the way here, it seems you've been losing your composure."

When I said that, Strom let out a sigh with an exasperated look.

"Everyone, chattering away. What a nuisance."

When I heard those words, I couldn't contain my rising anger.

"You! Do you not care at all about the subordinates who sacrificed their lives for you!?"

Zest, Lawrence, and the unnamed demons all sacrificed their lives following Strom's orders.

The fact that we are here means we defeated them. Yet Strom lamented that he spoke too much.

He showed no mourning for the fallen subordinates who died for his sake.

I was more indignant at Strom, who showed no remorse for the subordinates who died for him. However, Strom looked at me with a puzzled expression.

"You defeated them, didn't you? Why are you so angry?"

"You... truly, this guy... he doesn't care about Zest and the others at all..."

"They are just pawns, after all. Whether they live or die, it doesn't bother me."

Pawns... he called the subordinates who died for his sake pawns.

When I heard those words, the image of the female demon in my mind flashed.

"Is Miria also a pawn?"

"Miria-san? Ah, she is an experimental subject."

"... An experimental subject?"

That woman who shed tears for Strom, gave birth to a child, an experimental subject?

No... I feel like I'm about to lose control with anger...

"Some interesting experimental results have come up. Hey, Shin-Waldford-kun."

"What is it!"

"What are demons and monsters, I wonder?"

Here's the English translation of the provided text:

"What?"

My anger was on the verge of boiling over, but Strom's question made me a bit calmer.

"There is no ecosystem for demons. Ordinary animals suddenly turn into demons one day. And they die out in a single generation without leaving demon offspring."

"..."

"What's the meaning of such existence, I wonder?"

To Strom's question, neither I nor the Ogres could provide an answer. We had never considered such a thing.

"In my opinion, demons are like tumors that nest in this world. They will eventually proliferate and corrode and destroy this world..."

At that moment, Strom wore a self-deprecating smile.

"They are nothing but a menace."

He's calling himself a menace?

What is he trying to say?

"In that case, I'm trying to destroy the world as that malignant tumor, as the world's menace. Isn't that the truth of this world?"

Is he saying he's the cancer of this world?!

So, he wants to destroy this world...!?

That's just... outrageous!

"Don't be ridiculous! I won't accept such a 'truth'!"

"I see. So you won't sympathize with it. In that case..."

Strom said so and stood up.

"Struggle until the end, Shin-Waldford!"
