The matter of wireless communication devices was essential for infiltrating the vast former imperial territories, and I managed to persuade Aug to grant permission to develop them. However, we were strongly reminded to keep it a secret.

Starting with our training camp, two demon attacks and subjugations, visits from various countries, and everyone mastering their gates, our eventful summer vacation came to an end. There were many things that happened, but the most significant one for me was...

"Well then, Grandfather, Grandmother, we're off."

"Yes, go ahead."

"Ho ho, take care."

"Yes!"

Becoming Sicily's boyfriend, I guess. Oh, once this commotion is over, I might become her husband.

Although I feel somewhat bewildered by how fast things have progressed since we became lovers at the beginning of the summer vacation, I'm not opposed to it. In fact, I'm really happy.

"Shin, let's go."

"Yeah. Grandpa, Grandma, we'll be on our way."

Sicily and I left home, walking together with our arms linked. By the way, Maria is heading to school directly because she's learned how to use the gate. So, why are Sicily and I walking to the academy?

"Oh! Look, it's the Demon Lord and the Saint!"

"They still make a great pair."

"Sigh... I wish I had a girlfriend like the Saint."

"That's impossible. There aren't any girls like the Saint, after all."

"What did you say!?"

... There seems to be some commotion happening. It's like a public announcement or more of an expression of intent â€“ the Demon Lord and the Saint of the Ultimate Magicians are lovers and engaged, and no one is allowed to make advances towards Sicily.

I'm fine with it, but apparently, there are many people with impure feelings towards Sicily, so this is being done as a declaration. Honestly, I'm not too thrilled about being put on display, but Altos Investigator suggested that making our relationship widely known in society would deter people from approaching Sicily with improper intentions.

Well, I think it's not just that. Sometimes, people who have impure intentions towards Sicily are brought here under the guise of being part of the security detail.

The Saint plays a role as bait in addition to the declaration of her being the Demon Lord's. ... It's just that these two titles have already spread, which is quite sad.

"Well, it's been two months, so I didn't expect there would be more desks."

You really didn't notice, huh? We used to have three desks, four desks, and three desks, but now they're all four desks.

So that means...

"Good morning, it's been a while, hasn't it? Since the engagement announcement party of Walford and Claude."

Alfred-sensei arrived with two students.

"Starting today, these two will also attend classes in the S class. No need for introductions, just sit wherever you want."

"Thank you very much!"

"Thank you."

It's Mark and Olivia.

"It's turning out just as I expected."

"Yes, in the Ultimate Magic Research Society... Now it's the Ultimate Magicians. They belong there, and even if there are only two A-class students capable of subduing demons, there's a significant difference in ability. As a special case, this year's S class will have twelve students."

I see, that's a relief. I was worried that they would be the only ones in a separate class.

Well... this might make it even harder for us to interact with students from other classes...

"Today is the first day of the new semester, so we'll end with the opening ceremony and homeroom. Oh, you two will be honored at the opening ceremony."

"Honored?"

"Of course. Right now, while the world is in crisis due to demons, it's the students of the Arsheid Advanced Magic Academy who have saved the world twice."

I see. But honored with what?

"Do we get certificates or something?"

"Ah, yes, it's like a prize. In this academy, there is something that is given to outstanding students at graduation, and that will be awarded. It doesn't mean you're graduating, but it's the highest thing awarded within the academy. Your achievements this time are too great to go without it."

I see, what could it be?

So, does that mean we won't get anything when we graduate? It's like getting it in advance.

"Now, let's move to the auditorium."

Alfred-sensei led us to the auditorium, and... even on the way, I could feel everyone's eyes on us. The students didn't seem to be making a fuss, but they looked confused.

Upon arriving at the auditorium, the usual speeches, new semester instructions, and the school principal's words continued.

"Now, finally, members of the Ultimate Magic Research Society, please come up to the stage."

With the announcement from the MC using a magical amplification device, we were about to step onto the stage...

"Screams!"

Note: The translation provided is a continuation of the text in the previous request.

Instantly, there was a thunderous applause and cheering that left everyone stunned.

"Huh? Weren't they avoiding us?"

"It seems like it's different."

"They probably just didn't know how to approach us. Anyway, let's go."

"Yes!"

It's a bit overwhelming when it's just one or two people, but when it's everyone... it feels different, I guess?

Regardless, it seems like we're not disliked by everyone, so that's a relief.

"As you all probably already know, the Ultimate Magic Research Society led by Shin Walford, who was the top student in the first year, has now changed its name to the Ultimate Magicians. They have successfully defeated the group of demons that attacked the old empire and finally advanced into the world!"

As the teacher conveyed this with some excitement, it seemed to have also reached the students, as another round of loud applause and cheers erupted.

"They have prevented two demon attacks on two separate occasions and have now received an award. They are here to make the name of our Arsheid Advanced Magic Academy widely known!"

Once again, cheers filled the auditorium.

The teacher seems quite delighted... almost as if he's hosting a live event or something.

"Therefore, instead of the usual practice of awarding it only at graduation, we will now present them with the items. School principal, please."

And with that, we were presented with this time's items by the elderly school principal.

I wonder what it is...

I was so distracted by the content of the items that I completely let my guard down.

"Now, representatives of the Ultimate Magicians, Shin Walford, we kindly ask for a few words."

"Huh!?"

It was such an abrupt request that I involuntarily made a strange sound! Even the students are chuckling! Alfred-sensei, you could have given me a heads up!

But now that I've been asked, I have to say something.

What should I do...

"Oh, um, I'm Shin Walford, representative of the Ultimate Magicians, I guess? Come to think of it, when did I become the representative?"

"You're the president of the Ultimate Magic Research Society, so it's from the beginning, right?"

"Oh, I see... Well, um... We didn't do what we did because we wanted to become heroes or be recognized and awarded like this. We took action because we believed that allowing demons to run rampant would lead to the world's destruction."

As I spoke, everyone listened attentively.

I just honestly expressed my current feelings, but if it motivated everyone, then I guess the embarrassment wasn't in vain?

After our recognition, the opening ceremony concluded, and we returned to our classroom.

"By the way, what is this item they presented us with?"

"Huh? Oh, Shin, don't you know?"

"It's well-known, but it's not impossible for Lord Shin to be unaware."

"Does everyone know?"

"Yes, while the Knight Academy and the School of Economics have different things, the item awarded to outstanding students of the Magic Academy is..."

"An item?"

"Magic stones."

"Magic stones?"

What's that? It sounds quite fantastical, but I've never heard of it in this world.

"Huh? Walford, haven't you heard about it from Lady Merida?"

"It's the first time I've heard of it."

Saying that, everyone started whispering.

"I don't think Lady Merida would forget to tell me about it..."

"I guess if Lord Shin doesn't know, she didn't tell him."

"This is probably it. If Shin learns about the existence of magic stones, he'll end up creating something unbelievable again, so Lady Merida probably decided to restrain herself."

"Ahh, I see!"

Everyone seemed to be in agreement.

"What the heck is this? What have I just agreed to?"

"When you get back, ask Lady Merida how to use the magic stones you received at the academy."

"What is that?"

It seems like everyone knew about it, so is it something common in this world? But I've never seen it before... What is a magic stone?

In the end, nobody explained anything about magic stones. They all unanimously said, "Ask Lady Merida."

Even Sicily said, "Well... I think it's better to have Lady Merida explain it to you" instead of telling me.

...What on earth is my grandmother keeping as a secret? I'm really curious...

Our homeroom for the day ended with a discussion about the future course of our studies. It turns out our magic practice will become self-study, as there's nothing more the academy can teach us. However, the theoretical classes will continue as usual.

After hearing these announcements, our day concluded. It finished before noon, and I wanted to ask my grandmother about the magic stones, so I decided to skip the research club for the day.

Afterward, everyone planned to go out in disguise. They felt stressed because they couldn't casually go outside anymore, and they wanted to experience the thrill of not knowing when they might be recognized.

They're all quite the adventurers...

Supplying magical energy continuously, so... even if someone doesn't activate it, the magical device will keep working.

Huh? I've heard of that somewhere...

"Ah! The forest house's protective barrier magical device!"

"Exactly. That one also uses magic stones to continuously supply magical energy. It uses a reasonably large magic stone. It should last for a while."

"I see... and then?"

"And then?"

"Well, if my grandmother was hiding that much, there must be something else, right?"

"There's nothing else. Magic stones can keep magical devices active even if they're no longer in human hands. That's all."

Really? Is that the only reason my grandmother was keeping it a secret?

I looked at Sicily and Maria, and they both nodded vigorously.

The staff members also did the same.

"As Lady Merida said, there's nothing more to it. It's not more or less than that."

"I see. So why didn't you tell me?"

"Why?"

Huh? My grandmother's expression changed...

"Why didn't I tell you about a thing like a magic stone? Because you wouldn't know what kind of extraordinary creation it could lead to!"

Huh? That's the reason?

I looked at Sicily and Maria as if seeking help, and... Oh, Maria is nodding vigorously.

Sicily has a slightly troubled expression but doesn't deny it.

...So that's why everyone at the academy agreed...

"I really didn't want to tell you... I figured if you were attending the academy, you'd eventually learn about it in class, so I was putting off the issue until then."

"Issue...?"

"It's a big issue!"

Oh, Maria is nodding vigorously again.

"Well, fortunately, magic stones aren't commonly circulated. Even so, if you've managed to get one, I'll teach you how to use it."

"Really!? Thank you, Grandma!"

"Well... It's fortunate that there's only one..."

Come to think of it, she mentioned earlier that it's not widely circulated.

She said it's only given to outstanding students. Is it really that rare?

"Are magic stones really that rare? Where can you get them?"

"Here we go again with Shin's 'Why? What?'... Magic stones are, well, they're only found by chance. There's no method of extraction for them."

"By chance?"

"Yeah, there are many mining areas for ore. It's not in shallow places, but in deep locations. Occasionally, they're found during mining operations."

You've reached our limit of messages per hour. Please try again later.

"That's right, you can't deny that."

Everyone seems to be saying something, but I can't quite make it out.

More importantly, the problem is that we don't have enough magic stones.

Should I try to mine for magic stones? But where? I don't even know the conditions for their formation.

Come to think of it, they mentioned that magic stones are only found deep underground. Is it similar to diamonds?

In my previous life, artificial diamonds were manufactured, and I think they used...

"High temperature and high pressure..."

"What was that?"

Magic stones are formed deep underground, which means they crystallize under high pressure with significant magical energy. I wonder if high temperatures are also needed?

"...I think I should try..."

"Try? Try what?"

"Granny, I'm going to head out into the wilderness for a bit."

"Wait a minute! What are you planning to do?"

"Well, it's a little experiment."

"That doesn't tell me anything..."

"It's probably better if you see it. Are you coming?"

"Of course I am!"

And so, I brought Grandpa, Granny, Sicily, and Maria to the wilderness.

"I'm sorry, but I'm going to put up a full-strength magical barrier. We don't know what's going to happen."

When I said that, everyone put up their magical barriers with all their might.

The magical device's barrier also activated, creating a double barrier.

"This feels a bit excessive..."

"No, it's not. What kind of magic are you going to use?"

"It's not an offensive or defensive spell."

Saying that, I started gathering magical energy.

"This is... a ridiculous amount of magical energy you're gathering."

"You're not using this enormous amount of magical energy for an offensive spell, right? What are you... Could it be?"

"What's wrong, Grandma?"

I gathered the same amount of magical energy as before and began compressing it.

Make it smaller... Apply more pressure...

I tried gathering and compressing the magical energy, but...

"It's not working..."

As soon as I released the compression, the magical energy dissipated.

"Then, next..."

I gathered a similar amount of magical energy again and started compressing it. However, this time, I also applied high heat.

Make it smaller... Apply more heat... Make it even smaller...

Continuing the compression, I compressed it to about the size of the first joint of my thumb and continued to apply high heat and high pressure for a while.

After a while, I released the pressure and heat, and...

"I did it..."

In the palm of my hand, a transparent, unmistakable magic stone that emitted magical energy had been created.

"I did it! I did it!"

"What's going on? What did you make?"

I couldn't help but shout with excitement about the results of solving various problems, and Granny, who heard it, came flying over.

"Granny, look at this!"

"What is it? What did you do?"

Granny lost her voice when she saw the magic stone that had just been created in the palm of my hand.

It's a once-in-a-century discovery. That's probably why Granny can't speak.

"I really... really created it..."

Saying that, for some reason, I knelt down as if I were collapsing.

Huh? This is the moment to say, "Wow, that's amazing!"...

It feels more like despair.

"What's wrong? What happened, Merida?"

"Granny?"

"What's the matter?"

The three of them arrived late and saw Granny, who was kneeling and looking down.

"Shin... Shin..."

"Hey! What's the matter with Shin!?"

"Shin... created a magic stone..."

"...Huh?"

Everyone else also looked dumbfounded.

Did I mess up again?

"The magic stone in Shin's hand... is something that Shin created just now."

"Wait, show it to me for a moment!"

"Sure."

I handed the magic stone I had just created to Grandpa.

"This is... It's small, but it's definitely a magic stone!"

"Could it be true?"

"Creating magic stones... Wasn't it a mystery of the world that hadn't been solved until now?"

"That's right, until just now. Shin, how did you create a magic stone?"

"Magic stones are created deep in mines, right?"

"That's right."

"When you mine, you're digging deeper, so it might not be obvious, but before you dig, there's a large amount of earth and sand on top, and it's under tremendous pressure, right?"

"Now that you mention it... it's true."

"So... I thought that high pressure might be necessary for creating magic stones."

"...And?"

"At first, I tried compressing magical energy with just pressure, but it failed. So, I thought about what other types of energy are found deep underground, and I figured it might be heat... and when I added high heat..."

"So you mean the magic stone was created..."

"Probably, but... in the mines where magic stones are excavated, there are probably nearby volcanoes or faults, right?"

"Indeed... There certainly are!"

"As I thought."

Heat and pressure, are these the necessary conditions for the creation of magic stones?

However, natural magical energy must compress gradually to create them, so it might take some time.

"Haa... seriously... what kind of mind do you have?"

"Seriously, this child... anyway, Shin."

"What?"

"Let me make it clear, you must not tell anyone about this. If it's known that you can create magic stones... it would cause a different kind of chaos in the world."

"It's because they are rare, right? I understand that much. I just wanted a bit for ourselves."

"I never expected that we would solve the mystery of magic stones right after talking about them. You're really an extraordinary child."

"Hoho, it's not bad, always advancing. It's wonderful."

"It's because you're like that... honestly..."

Magic stones are said to be rare and expensive, so I don't intend to distribute these artificial magic stones. I know very well that it would cause chaos in the world.

However, I do plan to create the necessary amount for our own use, except for the wireless communication device. I feel bad for Granny.

By the way, why has Sicily been quiet for a while now?

"Shin, you managed to solve the world's unsolved mysteries that nobody else could... you're amazing..." She looked at me with watery eyes. with concepts
