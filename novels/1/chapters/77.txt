The surrounding countries' armies, like the Earlshide Army, are invading the Demon Realm.

The combined forces of Els and Eys, added to these surrounding countries' armies, may not match the Earlshide Army, but they have assembled a formidable army.

Furthermore, this regional alliance has a delegation from the Ultimate Magicians.

Those who have directly witnessed the Ultimate Magicians in battle, like Suede and Kurt's soldiers, have immense trust in them.

Even those who haven't seen them directly, like Karnan, who heard stories from acquaintances in the National Sheep Farm, had high expectations, as the National Sheep Farm, considered the strongest domestically, praised them without reservation.

However, for Els and Eys' people who are part of the alliance, the strength of these Ultimate Magicians is unknown, and they were uncertain about how much they should trust them.

"Um, can I ask you something?"

"Yes? What is it?"

A while after the Kurt regional alliance invaded the Demon Realm, a soldier from Els, who was part of this regional alliance, approached a nearby soldier from Eys.

"Hey, you're from Eys, right? Have you seen the battles of the Ultimate Magicians?"

"No... Unfortunately, I haven't. How about you?"

"We had a diplomat who saw it, but you know, we're civil servants, so we don't really understand what's so incredible about it."

"I see... Well, with Pope Ni Xia speaking so highly of them, there's no doubt they're powerful, but..."

"How powerful... That's the real question."

"Don't worry too much."

As the soldiers from Els and Eys were talking, a soldier from Kurt approached them.

"So, have you seen their battles?"

"Yes, with my own eyes."

"So, how strong are they, specifically?"

"How strong... well..."

"Is it that hard to describe?"

The Els and Eys soldiers began to look worried as the Kurt soldier seemed to struggle with the answer.

"No, it's not that, but... it's just hard to put into words. I understand how the Els diplomat feels."

"You understand our diplomat's feelings?"

"Yes, it's just... incredible, that's the only way to describe it."

The impressions of active-duty soldiers were similar.

The two soldiers from Els and Eys, who couldn't stop trembling at the sight of the Disaster-class creature they were seeing for the first time, wondered if it could even be defeated. They felt a sense of despair from the sheer power of the tiger-like magical creature.

Then...

"What is it? Another tiger? It would be nice if something else showed up occasionally."

"That's rather insensitive, Your Highness. To regular soldiers, even a tiger-like creature is a formidable opponent."

"Tooru's words are surprisingly heartless."

In a space dominated by fear and tension, three individuals appeared, carrying an air quite out of place. They were August, the Crown Prince of the Earlshide Kingdom, and his companions, Toru and Julius, who were supposedly his friends but served as his guards.

"At this rate, that guy Shin might start calling you the 'Tiger-Hunting Prince.'"

"Your Highness, lately you've been encountering tigers quite frequently."

"Is it because I'm the Tiger-Hunting Prince?"

It was hard to believe this conversation belonged to the Crown Prince of a major kingdom. Even the burly man was teasing the prince. The shorter man burst into laughter.

"Why are you all so relaxed at a time like this?"

"Yeah, it's a Disaster-class creature!"

"Huh? What's got you so on edge? It's just a tiger."

"Just a tiger!?"

The contrast between the tense soldiers and the carefree attitude of August's group was striking.

"Your Highness, may we request something?"

"Understood. You all, step back. I won't care if you get caught in the crossfire."

The soldiers from the Kurt Kingdom casually requested the defeat of the tiger-like creature, and the prince accepted it as a matter of course. The soldiers from Els and Eys couldn't believe their eyes.

"Wait a minute! Are you really sending another country's Crown Prince into harm's way so casually!?"

"Yeah! He's the Crown Prince of the Earlshide, a major country! He's the next King!"

"Huh? If it's their Highnesses, it should be no problem, right?"

The exchange between the soldiers from Els and Eys and the Kurt soldiers left them in disbelief, and the contrast was stark.

While the soldiers were having this exchange, August controlled his magical power and prepared a massive amount of it.

"Look, step back."

"Huh?"

The two who had been making noise turned to look in the direction of August's voice.

A massive lightning bolt struck, covering the entire field of vision.

"Screaaam!"

"My eyes! My eyes!"

If Shin had heard them, he would have been delighted to hear these lines from the soldiers who covered their eyes while wincing in pain. Their eyes had been burned from directly witnessing the huge lightning strike.

"Your Highness! If you're going to use lightning magic, please let us know! Some of them are rolling on the ground!"

"Huh? Didn't I say something?"

"You didn't!"

Some of those who had witnessed the lightning strike up close covered their eyes. Although they were at risk of being attacked by the creatures, it didn't come to that. Because...

"Ugh... My vision is finally returning... Wait! What is this!?"

"W-what is this!?"

What the two of them finally saw when their vision returned was a tiger-like magical creature and a multitude of creatures, all charred black by a single strike.

"Hmm. The materials are... completely ruined."

"It's a good thing Shin-dono isn't here. He would have definitely teased us mercilessly."

"Because we're all blackened."

August and his companions discussed the fact that they couldn't obtain any materials from defeating the Disaster-class creature. The Kurt soldiers, who had witnessed the power, were momentarily stunned but soon erupted in cheers.

On the other hand, the soldiers from Els and Eys, who were seeing the magic of August, or rather, the Ultimate Magicians, for the first time, couldn't believe their eyes and stood in amazement.

"Don't stand there in a daze! Revive yourselves! There are still creatures left!"

Reprimanded by August, the main cause of their astonishment, the soldiers finally snapped out of it.

Then, from among those soldiers, a voice was heard.

"Thunder God..."

August broke into a cold sweat upon hearing this word from somewhere. This was not a good sign. He tried to find the person who made that statement and prevent the spread of the name, but...

"Incredible! It's like a blow from the Thunder God!"

"Thunder God!"

"Thunder God!"

"Hey! Stop it! Seriously, stop it!"

The voice quickly spread, and August, with no means to stop it, was now renowned as the "Thunder God."

"I'm looking forward to tonight's report."

"That's right."

"Don't say that! Definitely don't say that!"

Observing the rare sight of August getting flustered, Toru and Julius contemplated whether this was a prelude to something he needed to say.

Changing the scene, Alice, Lin, and Yuri had been dispatched to Suede. They were sent to this country, which had experienced attacks by demons, and where many people carried trauma. The hope was that Alice and her team would bring a sense of brightness and break the dark atmosphere.

"So, then, Shin used a new magic..."

"The whole area turned into a wasteland."

"That was quite something..."

Alice gestured and spoke about Shin's episode, while Lin calmly added some explanations. And, perhaps recalling that moment, Yuri let out a sigh of ennui.

Listening to Alice and Lin's conversation with a warm smile, Yuri's sensuality, which didn't seem fitting for her fifteen years, made their hearts flutter. The trauma of Suede's soldiers seemed to have eased considerably.

However, they were still in the Demon Realm. There was no time for prolonged conversations, as they were under attack by creatures here as well.

Part of the strategy involved defeating the creatures within the Demon Realm, so they set out to defeat them one by one as they found them. In this joint force with Suede, no Disaster-class creatures had appeared.

"Ugh! There's nothing to do!"

"I want to use magic, whether it's medium or large-sized creatures."

"Well, let's ask around."

Alice and Lin were bored due to the lack of action. Upon hearing this, Yuri approached a nearby soldier to ask if they could also participate in the battle.

"That sounds good... There's still a long way to go, so can we join in?"

"Sure! Let's go, Lin!"

"You go ahead."

"Yeah! No fair! Wait for me!"

"It's not a game, so be careful... Oh well, she's already gone."

While Disaster-class creatures hadn't appeared, they were allowed to participate in creature hunting, and without much heed to Yuri's advice, Alice and Lin jumped into action.

Frustration had likely built up in them as they had been left without a role for yesterday and today.

"Hiyah!"

"Here we go!"

Activating their jet boots, they headed towards the center of the creature swarm from above. Before that, they used explosion magic together to blow the creatures away and create a platform.

Upon landing and standing back-to-back, the two displayed their magic prowess.

"Whoaaah!"

Alice released a multitude of fire bullets towards the creatures crowding in front of her.

"Hyah."

Using composite magic, mixing a small amount of earth with water, she created water cutters and swung them horizontally. The creatures hit by the fire bullets exploded one after another due to their power and quantity, and the creatures hit by the water cutters were sliced in two easily.

"Oh, come on. They're having so much fun."

Seeing their actions, Yuri also took out a magical tool from her extradimensional storage and readied herself.

"Everyone, I'll join in too."

Although it appeared to be an ordinary staff, it was imbued with Merida's personally taught enhancement magic. The characters used by Shin for enhancements were unique to him. He applied his knowledge from a past life with a few characters, which Yuri couldn't understand or teach. Therefore, Yuri had learned this technique from Merida, who was the leading expert in creating magical tools in this world. Yuri created magical tools using the techniques she had been taught.

"Here we go. Fire!"

The staff, charged with magic, released countless wind blades. The released wind blades trampled over the creatures.

"Oh? I missed a few."

It seemed that while the power was tremendous, precise control wasn't possible, and some creatures were left untouched.

"Hmm. I still need some improvements. Let's try this next."

Saying so, she took out another staff.

"Eii."

With a somewhat deflated shout, magic was released from the staff imbued with magic. Bullets formed from the ground at her feet were shot towards the creatures with incredible force.

The creatures were quickly turned into a sieve.

Watching Yuri and the others' battle in a daze, the soldiers of the joint forces finally regained their composure.

"Don't fall behind those girls! Let's do it too!"

"Yeah!"

"But! Don't get caught up in it!"

"Yeahhh!"

"Huh? Isn't that a little harsh?"

Yuri expressed some slight dissatisfaction at the fact that the response to "Don't get caught up in it" was louder than expected.

In the end, no disaster-level monsters appeared. Alice and Lin, after taking down about half of the creatures, seemed satisfied. They returned from the center of the group of monsters to Yuri.

"We're back!"

"Welcome back."

"Is that enough for you?"

"Yes! We've taken down plenty of monsters!"

"We need to leave some for the soldiers to do their jobs, you know."

Rather than just wanting to go on a rampage, it seemed that the two had considered the soldiers. As a result, they wiped out the remaining creatures as instructed, and the soldiers returned.

"Well, you saved us."

"Oh, no need to mention it."

Representing the joint forces, the Swede commander approached Yuri and the others.

"By the way, the power of your magic seems to have increased since I last saw you."

"We've been training a lot since then!"

"Really pushed ourselves."

"Just kidding."

Impressed by Alice's words, slightly puzzled by Lin's mention of training, and relieved by Yuri's response, the commander's expression changed constantly. Alice and Lin watched the commander's ever-changing expressions with interest. The commander, who had piqued their curiosity, decided to ask a question.

"It goes without saying that you used magic, but this time, you used magical tools as well. Were they created by the Demon Lord?"

"No, I made them!"

"Eh? You did?"

"Yes. I learned various things from Lady Merida."

"I see. From the High Priest."

"Shin's magical tools are all original, and I couldn't understand them or imitate them, so Lady Merida taught me directly."

"I see. So, you are officially Lady Merida's 'successor.'"

"Huh? N-no way!"

When called the "successor of the High Priest" by the Swede commander, Yuri was flustered. Alice, who observed her reaction, expressed her discontent.

"Yuri's so lucky! Give me a title too!"

"A title like...?"

As a commander, he had simply shared his honest impression. He was at a loss when they asked him for something more specific. After thinking about it for a while and recalling the recent battle...

"...Annihilating Magical Girls...?"

Hearing that, both Alice and Yuri shivered. Yuri held back her laughter.

"Th-that title is the last thing I want!!"

"I'm fine being a rampaging magical girl."

The Swede Allied Forces seem to be doing well.

In the Carnan Allied Forces, where Tony, Mark, and Olivia are deployed, they have a slightly different feature compared to the others.

They have Galan and the shepherds with them.

While the young Tony and the others might be somewhat unconventional within the military due to their slender builds and carrying staffs that make them look like mages, they all have burly, muscular physiques, exceeding even knights and soldiers.

This becomes particularly peculiar when they wear robes and carry enormous halberds.

Even the Carnan soldiers, who are their fellow countrymen, seem unsure of how to interact with them.

"Hmm, they've stolen all the attention."

"The impact is incredible."

"I don't really want too much attention."

Tony appears somewhat disappointed that the focus is on Galan and the shepherds, but Olivia, who claims to be an ordinary town girl, is relieved.

"By the way, Tony, are you going with a focus on swords or magic?"

"Well, I think I'll stick with a sword. What about Mark?"

"I'm going to focus on magic."

"Is that so?"

"I'd like to use both a sword and magic, but I don't want to get in Tony's way. I'll practice a bit more first."

"Haha, you have to protect Olivia, right?"

"Well... I might have had to do that in the past, but now..."

"What do you mean? I'm just a regular girl from a town. Protect me!"

"A woman who can chat while annihilating monsters isn't something I'd call normal!"

Mark talks to Olivia in a regular tone. Tony observes their exchange and, looking somewhat envious, comments.

"You guys are great. You're always together."

"No, it's not like that!"

"What do you mean!?"

"Haha, you know how it is. If you two get married, your house will be filled with flying magic, I guess."

"Please refrain from making comments that sound like something one could actually imagine in real life..."

"Haha."

It's hard to imagine Shin and Sicily having a big fight, and with August and Elizabeth, Elizabeth can't use magic. Only these two seem to have such an amusing future in store.

"By the way, what's Freid-san's girlfriend like?"

"I've never heard about it."

Regarding relationships within the Ultimate Magicians, Thor and Julius have arranged marriages decided by their parents. However, aside from that, they are free to start relationships on their own.

By the way, Thor and Julius also have arranged marriages, but they seem to like each other, and their relationship is good. Julius's situation might be a bit hard to imagine...

In the midst of all this, Tony hadn't heard who he had chosen as a girlfriend after August had advised him to sort out his romantic affairs when he learned the Gate spell. With his flirtatious appearance, Tony was often seen with girls. Naturally, one might assume it was someone from that group, but Tony surprised them with his answer.

"Yeah, I never told anyone. Actually, I've only recently started dating."

"What? It's not someone from the girls you've been seen with?"

"Since His Highness told me to sort out my romantic affairs, I hadn't really thought about it. Then, I thought, and I asked the girl who had rejected me a long time ago to date me again."

"Rejected for a long time?"

To this surprising confession, Olivia inquired with curiosity.

"I confessed back in middle school and got rejected. Then I dated another girl who comforted me. But I ended up being more disliked..."

It seemed that Tony, too, had experiences of not being able to gain the affections of his real crush. Considering this, Shin and Sicily, August and Elizabeth, and Mark and Olivia were quite lucky.

"I had to become a member of the Ultimate Magicians, earn a special medal, and finally say that I would only have you."

"You went through a lot..."

"But! But! What's she like?"

One girl... as she thought about that, Olivia seemed more interested in Tony's girlfriend.

"Well, she's a girl who's currently attending the Magic Law Institute. She used to be the class representative in middle school."

Both Mark and Olivia couldn't hide their surprise at the identity of Tony's girlfriend.

An attendee of the Magic Law Institute was someone who excelled in middle school. Moreover, being a class representative in middle school meant she was an exemplary student.

"...Is this just a case of wanting what we don't have for each other?"

"She's the opposite of Tony..."

"You guys are kind of ruthless, aren't you..."

Surprised by Tony's unexpected girlfriend, Thor and Julius felt a small sense of superiority for being the first to hear about it and looked forward to the report meeting later tonight.

As they were about to say there was no need to share more, a voice called out, "Monsters have appeared!"

For each of them, whether the timing was good or bad, monsters had appeared.

"Sigh, well, let's go outside. We need to see the situation."

"Alright!"

"Sure!"

Galan, the shepherd, spotted the three of them as they exited the carriage.

"Hey, you made it."

"Thank you for your hard work, Galan-san. What's the scale?"

"Who knows? Seems like they're still increasing. There's no point in knowing the current number, is there?"

"That's true."

Here, the number of monsters was also increasing as they gathered. However, with an army exceeding tens of thousands, they wouldn't fall behind.

"And if all the surrounding Allied Forces are in this state, wouldn't the wild animals in the Demon Realm disappear?"

"Or perhaps all the wild animals have turned into monsters... right?"

For a moment, Galan was speechless by that possibility. However, considering the gathering of a large number of monsters, it was a natural conclusion.

"If that's the case, then maybe I can understand this massive group... The ecosystem has gone completely haywire!"

As someone who made a living dealing with creatures, Galan couldn't hide his anger at the fact that the ecosystem had gone completely haywire.

His intense frustration made the three of them involuntarily tense up.

"You bastards! How can we leave those who play with lives like this!? It's pitiful for the animals turned into monsters, but we'll send them on their way and restore the ecosystem!"

"Ooooh!"

In the Carnan Allied Forces, the first to charge forward were not knights, soldiers, or even mages, but the shepherds. They were indeed strong as individuals but didn't know the common tactic of using mages for the initial attack, so the shepherds charged forward. The mages were baffled by their actions, but there weren't many shepherds. They fired magic in areas without shepherds and, as a signal, the knights and soldiers stormed in.

"Is it really okay to just observe until a disaster-class one appears?"

"I feel like we should participate too."

"But if we take actions outside the plan, everyone will be bewildered..."

Olivia's concern was the most reasonable. In a large-scale military operation, irregular actions were hard to deal with. Should they stick to what had been pre-decided, or should they provide assistance?

They debated this but the dilemma became unnecessary soon.

"Ah, is that... I-I think a monster that appears to be a disaster-class has shown up!"

A soldier on patrol shouted, but what did they mean by "a monster that appears to be a disaster-class"...?

When Tony and the others looked in that direction:

"Huh? Have my eyes gone crazy?"

"I can see it too, so it's probably not a mistake."

"That's... becoming a disaster-class?"

The monster they saw was a deer-like creature, but of a size that seemed like a scale had gone wrong. Deer were common creatures to become monsters of medium size, but getting as large as this was extremely rare, and becoming a disaster-class was unheard of. Did wild animals gradually grow larger because their body tissues changed when they turned into monsters? That was the usual assumption. However, there was a presumed limit to it. Deer were thought to grow only to a large size, not this large.

"...It's as big as a school building."

"Hey, hey, what are we gonna do with something like this!?"

Mark, who was somewhat lacking in tension, muttered, and Galan, who was seeing a disaster-class monster for the first time, raised his voice. Even the soldiers who had seen disaster-class monsters before were left speechless. By the way, when humans turned into monsters, their size didn't change. There was no absolute certainty due to the limited samples of demonized humans, but it was thought that their size remained unchanged because they could control their magic. It was most likely a stag given its antlers, and it raised its appropriately sized horns and let out a roar.

"Buuuuuh!"

The soldiers shrank away from that voice. On the contrary, there were figures rushing towards the giant deer monster.

"Mark! Olivia-san! I need your support! I'll cut off its legs and come back!"

"Understood!"

Responding to Tony's request, Mark and Olivia took action.

"Hey! Tony, that's crazy!"

Seeing a monstrous creature beyond imagination, Galan tried to stop Tony, thinking it was impossible even for the Ultimate Magicians. However, Tony had already infiltrated under the deer monster's feet.

"Ah!"

Galan thought Tony was about to be crushed but was shocked when the deer monster's face suddenly exploded.

"Wow, it's tough."

"Maybe we should have put more magic into it?"

Mark and Olivia were unsure of how to handle a creature of this size since it was their first encounter.

"Nice job!"

Tony, who had ventured under the creature, activated his jet boots, propelling himself upward, almost up to his knees.

"Huh!?"

Seeing this for the first time, Galan let out another surprised shout.

"Shh!"

Then Tony easily sliced the knee with his vibration sword, releasing a blast of magic into the wound.

Tony chose an explosion spell. Even though the surface was tough, the inside was not. The vibration sword wasn't long enough to sever it completely, but the subsequent magical attack successfully cut off one leg.

"Huh!?"

Galan shouted again in disbelief after seeing Tony sever one of the massive deer monster's legs. The wounded creature, the size of a large tree, was struggling to maintain balance but managed to stop from falling.

"Oh? You're persistent."

Tony said and proceeded to blow off the hind leg in the same manner. Mark and Olivia's magic hit it again, finally causing the creature to lose its balance and fall to the ground with a seismic tremor.

"There. Welcome."

With the deer monster's face on the ground, making it easier to handle, Tony swung his vibration sword and, in combination with the explosion magic, quickly decapitated the creature.

"May I ask for your help?"

"Sure! You guys, let's clean up the rest!"

'Yeah!'

Tony felt he had finished his part of the job. Upon hearing his voice, Galan and the others came to their senses and proceeded to eliminate the remaining monsters.

"No, it's amazing. I mean, I thought 'Magicians' were all about magic, but you can use a sword too?"

"Yeah, well."

After giving orders to everyone, Galan talked to Tony.

"Wow, if you can use both magic and a sword, you could call yourself a 'Magic Swordsman,' don't you think?"

"Well, it's a bit awkward for me to declare that myself..."

"Is that so? Well, others will probably call you that on their own. Alright, I'm off!"

"Okay, take care."

Tony waved goodbye to Galan, who had bestowed him with an unusual title, and then returned to Mark and Olivia.

At that moment, he appeared to be somewhat troubled.

"Good job, Tony. What's wrong? Do you not like the title of 'Magic Swordsman'?"

"Well, it's, um... a bit embarrassing, but it's not that I don't like it."

"Then did we make a mistake?"

"No, not at all. Your support was perfect."

"Then what's the matter?"

Despite the sudden title given to him, it seemed that Tony had no complaints, and the support from Mark and Olivia was flawless. So they were puzzled as to why Tony looked troubled.

In response to Mark's question, Tony began to express his thoughts.

"Well, you see... do deer usually get that big?"

"No, not that big. Typically, they grow to be large at best. Why, is there something strange?"

"The moment we entered the Demon Realm, I thought that animals would only grow to be large, but now, we're encountering creatures of disaster-class size. Doesn't that seem odd to you?"

"Maybe it's just a coincidence..."

"Do you really believe that?"

Unable to answer Tony's question, Mark fell silent.

"I have a feeling this could become troublesome..."

While the soldiers continued to successfully defeat the horde of monsters, Mark and Olivia watched the scene with concern after hearing Tony's words. spreadsheet formula
