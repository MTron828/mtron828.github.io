In the sunshine coming in through the window, Sicily woke up.

I'm not sure when I went to sleep yesterday.

I tried to remember what happened last night, but when I looked to the side...

There was Shin, breathing softly.

"Huh? Huh!? Shin-kun!? Huh? Why?"

For some reason, Sicily was confused when she saw Shin sleeping next to her.

At that moment, she suddenly remembered what happened last night.

Last night, Shin was unfairly criticized, and she got angry and cried a lot out of frustration, and Shin comforted her and put her to sleep.

Looking at her own hand, she was gripping Shin's clothes.

She couldn't help but wonder how she had held onto Shin all night without letting go.

"W-what should I do!?"

As she panicked about the situation, she suddenly saw Shin's sleeping face for the first time.

The most reliable and beloved man in the world who would protect her with all his heart and soul.

That man was lying beside her, showing his vulnerable sleeping face.

Sicily couldn't help but stare at Shin's sleeping face.

As she gazed absentmindedly, Shin shifted and eventually opened his eyes.

"Ugh... No... Huh? Sicily? Why..."

When he woke up, Sicily was in front of him.

"Why are you here... Oh, right, Sicily didn't let go of my clothes yesterday, so I slept like this..."

"Good morning, Sicily."

"Um, good morning. Uh, sorry about, you know, holding onto your clothes... I couldn't go back to my room, right?"

Sicily's hand still had his clothes tightly in her grip.

...Did she grip them again after waking up?

"Well, you could have gone back if you just let go of my clothes..."

"Ah, right... So why?"

"Last night... I didn't want to leave Sicily alone..."

"Huh..."

"You got angry for my sake, cried until you were exhausted, and someone said they didn't want you, a girl like that, to be left alone... I couldn't just leave you."

"Shin-kun..."

"Sorry. Did you hate it?"
!

Shin stayed overnight in Sicily's room.

It quickly became known to everyone.

"It's a misunderstanding..."

While escorting the intruder from last night to the lodging of the Holy Kingdom of Is, I desperately tried to clear up the misunderstanding.

"What's wrong? It's not a big deal. We're both adults, and we're engaged, so it's not unnatural."

"Well, I think so too, but... I'd appreciate it if you could consider the timing and the place..."

"That's why! We shouldn't do this at a time like this!"

Sure, we're engaged, and we have that magical item, so it's not strange for us to do such things. But it's incredibly inappropriate to do something like that in the lodging where everyone is staying during such an important meeting.

"Whether we do it or not, it doesn't really matter. More importantly, we've arrived."

It's no use... Our relationship has been perceived as something more, and they've accepted it.

Can we still change their perception?

"Haha, way to go, Shin. How does it feel? Doesn't the world look different now?"

"Yeah, it does. It feels different after the first time."

"That's because it's different... We haven't done anything to change that... By the way, Mark, you... Oops."

I guess the lack of sleep the other day wasn't because of a long transmission after all.

"Shin, you're coming with us, and so is Claude."

"Huh? Uh, sure."

"Yes!"

I couldn't press Mark further.

When it's my turn, everyone gangs up on me, but why do they interfere when I try to do it to Mark?

As I wondered about this, Sicily approached from the women's group.

She stood beside me, her face blushing, her cheeks puffed out, and she gave me a stern look.

Oh... she's cute.

"Gosh, Shin, because of you, I was bombarded with questions from everyone."

"Sorry..."

"I really wanted to keep it a secret between just the two of us..."

"Huh? Oh... I'm sorry..."

"...Enough."

I see... it was supposed to be a secret just between us... I messed up there... Maria saw it, but...

"Hey, we're going to meet the delegation now. No more lovey-dovey stuff."

"Oh, okay."

"Sorry!"

That's right. Last night, these guys... about Sicily.

When I remembered, I got angry again.

"I am August von Airlsheid, the Crown Prince of the Airlsheid Kingdom. I have business with someone from the Holy Kingdom of Is. Please bring someone of significance other than the representative."

"Your Highness August? Why are you here?"

I did say I had business. Please bring someone of importance, except the representative this time."

"Understood."

Following August's orders, one of the Swid Kingdom guards at the lodging's entrance went to fetch someone from the Holy Kingdom of Is.

Soon, a seemingly amiable middle-aged gentleman appeared.

"Your Highness August, I must inquire about the purpose of your visit to a place like this, and at such an early hour without an appointment."

He asked with a mild but reproachful tone, considering the early hour and unexpected visit.

"Um, first, I want you to see these guys."

Saying so, he presented the intruders from last night.

The intruders presented were, of course, bound.

"What?! Who are you people?"

"Bi... Bishop..."

"It seems these individuals are indeed from the Holy Kingdom of Is, right?"

"That seems to be the case, but... Why are they being treated this way? What did they do? They are devout followers of the Church of the Creator. Depending on the circumstances, we may have to address this issue."

This guy probably has nothing to do with it... but saying such things after they caused all that trouble... I'm getting seriously annoyed.

"Oh, you're willing to address the issue?"

"What do you mean?"

"Do you know that in our Airlsheid, there is a girl known as a saint among the people? She risks her life on the battlefield to defeat demons and protect the people, and when there are wounded, she heals them regardless of who they are, free of charge. She truly embodies the teachings of the Church of the Creator."

That's some impressive reputation. Well, it's not entirely inaccurate.

Sicily blushed next to me.

I get it... it's embarrassing when people praise you like that...

"But these individuals, last night, infiltrated our Airlsheid Kingdom's lodging with the intention of kidnapping that saint."

"What?! Are you serious?"

"We caught them in the act. We got a confession, so there's no doubt."

"Why... why would they do something so dreadful..."

"By the way, you were going to address this as a problem, right? So, in the midst of negotiations that could decide the fate of other nations and the world, if it turns out that individuals from another nation attempted to kidnap a key figure from that nation... I wonder what kind of problem that would become?"

"T-that is..."

The gentleman addressed as a bishop had his legs, or rather, his whole body trembling.

It's likely due to the anger directed at those who did something so terrible and the trembling stems from considering the Holy Kingdom of Is' future.

Really... how could they have done something like this?

"Hmm... I might have gone a bit too far."

"If you realize that, then stop..."

"What? Aren't you frustrated?"

"I am frustrated and annoyed, but this person isn't involved, right?"

"That's true. By the way, do you understand your current situation?"

"Yes..."

"Alright. Now, tell me who gave you the orders."

He urged the captured intruders to reveal who had given them orders.

"...Archbishop Flehr..."

"What...?"

"We were deceived by Archbishop Flehr, and it was because of his lies that we took these actions..."

"Lies? What kind of lies?"

"We were told that the Saint had been captured and defiled by an evil man known as the Demon Lord, and that it was our mission to rescue her..."

"Foolish! The Ultimate Magician's Demon Lord and the Saint are known in the world as a deeply affectionate couple!"

Is that so?! I've never heard of that rumor before!

"That's exactly... It's a lie spread by the Demon Lord himself, they say..."

"What a... what a foolish thing!"

Indeed, how foolish is that?

Both the one who issues such orders and the one who follows them.

"But... in reality, as rumors say... no, we realized that they love each other even more than rumors suggest. We were about to do something irreparable..."

The intruders, their heads bowed, tears in their eyes, were reflecting on their actions.

It's hard to believe they were truly devout, although they may have taken it too far.

"Now, about this Archbishop Flehr... surely, after causing all this trouble, you don't plan to let him still represent you in the negotiations, do you?"

"Well, of course not... You! Go to his room and tie up that pig! He's probably still sleeping!"

"Understood!"

Wow... the seemingly kind gentleman just referred to someone as a pig...

"Oh...! I must apologize for showing you such an unsightly scene..."

"No... it seems you've had your share of trouble with that Archbishop."

"Yes... that man holds the title of Archbishop, but he's far from a clergyman. He indulges in gluttony and lust, and is nothing more than a depraved monk!"

Seems like he's completely indulging in the three worldly desires.

Well, from the perspective of a serious gentleman, calling him a pig is understandable...

"That man sees the Church of the Creator as nothing more than a tool to satisfy his desires! I wonder how many women have fallen victim to his clutches..."

Really? What a terrible person! Seriously!

"If you know that much, why do you let him run free?"

"Indeed, he's the worst as a bishop... but he's skilled in financial management, and he controls a large portion of the Holy Kingdom of Is' finances..."

"...So you couldn't touch him..."

The Church of the Creator is a religious organization, but the Holy Kingdom of Is is a nation. It would be difficult to go after someone who manages the nation's funds.

"But that's all changing today. He caused such an unbelievable... an issue so grave that it could lead to the disappearance of the Holy Kingdom of Is. Capital punishment is even on the table."

"Are you sure it will be okay? Won't he use his influence to escape again?"

"The Holy Kingdom of Is recognizes the reputation of the Saint. Especially His Holiness, who was once called a Saint in the past, is very concerned. If it is known that someone tried to harm such a Saint... the citizens and His Holiness will not forgive it."

"I see, that's good then."

Wow, the current Pope is a woman, huh?

Perhaps she's concerned about Sicily because she was once called a Saint too?

As I pondered these things, shouting came from the second floor of the lodging.

"You! What do you think you're doing? How dare you show such disrespect to me, a high-ranking Archbishop! Release me!"

It's no wonder the gentleman called him a pig. This is far from the conduct expected of a clergyman.

The man, who was incredibly overweight, was being tied up and dragged by the temple guards who had accompanied him.

"What's the meaning of this? Bishop Makina! Do you think you can get away with treating me like this?"

"Silence! You sinner!"

Wow, his shouting is not what you'd expect from his appearance.

"I've put up with this for a while, but I can't take it anymore! To think you would attempt to kidnap the Saint of all people! And during a crucial diplomatic meeting that could decide the fate of the world! Do you intend to destroy the Holy Kingdom of Is?"

"W-What are you...?"

"All those present here have confessed! They said they were incited by you to abduct the Saint! And they were caught red-handed! Do you think you can weasel your way out of this?"

"This is... a setup! It's a conspiracy by the Arlsheid Kingdom to frame me!"

"You... Even now, you say such things?"

"Hmm... these men entered the Saint's room, and we witnessed it. We caught them red-handed. Is that a setup?"

"T-That's right! The Arlsheid Kingdom is fabricating charges to trap me!"

This guy... before calling him a depraved monk, he's just a terrible human being... This is really getting on my nerves.

"If I recall... Archbishop Ameen-Fura was the representative of the Holy Kingdom of Is. In other words, he is the proxy of the Pope."

"That's right! I am the Pope's proxy! Do you think such disrespect is permissible?"

I can't believe... he doesn't even understand what a proxy means?

The young men seem to understand the meaning, and they're pale-faced.

"Being a proxy for the Pope means... that what Archbishop Ameen-Fura says is equivalent to what the Pope himself says, right?"

"So what if it is?"

"Meaning... since earlier, the Holy Kingdom of Is has been insulting the Arlsheid Kingdom, saying that we're a nation that fabricates crimes and entraps people?"

"N-No, it's not like that..."

"Isn't it like that? The meaning of being a proxy... In addition to that, they tried to abduct the Saint from the Arlsheid Kingdom. So, does it mean that the Holy Kingdom of Is, the headquarters of the Church of the Creator, is taking hostile actions against the Arlsheid Kingdom?"

"That's not true! This man is a sinner who attempted to kidnap an important figure from another country! He's not the proxy of the Pope!"

"What! Makina! You!"

"I hereby request the dismissal of Amen-Fura as the second in command of the Holy Kingdom of Is delegation. Does anyone object?"

"No!"

"I have the unanimous consent of the delegation! As such, I revoke the position of Amen-Fura as the representative, and I, as the deputy, will represent the delegation! My first order is to bind this man and transport him back to our homeland!"

"Yes, sir!"

"Makina! Youuu!"

Archbishop Amen-Fura was dragged away by the temple guards.

...I've seen the dark side of the Holy Kingdom of Is.

"As you can see, that's correct. I am relieving Amen-Fura of his position as the representative, and I will act as the acting representative. Is that acceptable?"

"Yes, I don't mind. But understand that thanks to Amen-Fura, you have created a significant debt to Is, haven't you?"

"Yes... it's utterly... an outrageous thing you've done."

Makina, the young lady in question, is muttering to herself. It's an incredibly negative start, so it's understandable that she might want to vent.

"Well then, I will proceed to the diplomatic meeting. You're free to do as you please."

"Why did we come here?"

"Well, isn't it to observe?"

Come to think of it, both Shinn and I haven't said a word. What exactly did we come here for?

"I apologize, but are you the Demon Lord Shin-Walford and the Saint Cecily-von-Claude?"

"That's correct."

"Saint... this time is... very sorry!"

Saying that, Archbishop Makina and all the members of the Is Holy Kingdom delegation bowed deeply.

Oh, my... it's awkward when this many people bow to you.

"You have committed tremendous rudeness to the heroes who saved the world, the Demon Lord, and the shining hope of the people, the Saint. It may not be forgivable, but we humbly request your forgiveness!"

They all remained prostrated without moving.

This might not settle down unless I say something.

"...I see. Understood. I accept your apology."

"Oh! Your words are most gracious!"

"We're going to have a wedding ceremony at the Arlsheid Great Cathedral... and I don't want to cause any trouble with the Church of the Creator."

"Thank you! In that case, I shall advise His Holiness to officiate at your wedding, as an expression of gratitude for your forgiveness! We must have His Holiness officiate at your wedding!"

... Huh.

... What?

... Huh!?

They want to have the Pope of the Church of the Creator officiate at the wedding!?

What is this person saying!?

"Ah! That's an excellent idea, Makina Archbishop!"

"His Holiness regards the Saint as his own daughter. He would be delighted to officiate. Wouldn't he?"

"Of course! We must make this recommendation!"

Why is everyone so happy about this?

"W-Wait a minute! Don't just proceed on your own!"

"Then, I shall return to my home country beforehand and make a recommendation to His Holiness the Pope."

"Um, I'm counting on you!"

"Yes!"

"So, I told you to wait!"

They're just leaving the criminals behind and returning home!

"This has turned into something amazing. The Pope is going to officiate at your wedding?"

"That's bad, right? If we let you officiate, we'd do it before the Pope."

"Hmm, you might have a point."

"I knew it! We should refuse..."

"So, shall we have a joint ceremony? It seems Ellie was originally planning on it."

"Don't offer a proposal with no way out!"

If we do it with the Crown Prince, everyone will surely accept!

"Give it up. Besides..."

"What is it?"

"Don't you think Claude and Ellie would be happy?"

Come to think of it, Cecily has been silent the whole time.

Thinking that, I take a look...

"At the Arlsheid Great Cathedral... a wedding officiated by His Holiness the Pope... a dream? Is this a dream?"

She seems to be in shock.

This is something we can't refuse anymore...
