The soldiers of Arlsheid were in despair.

Facing an unprecedented horde of disaster-class creatures, they had almost given up on winning and even on surviving.

In the face of such despair and with death as their grim companion, a savior descended upon them.

It was their beloved Crown Prince, Augustus von Arlsheid, who bore the nickname of the "Thunder God."

The lightning strikes unleashed by Augustus left soldiers in awe, but the blackened corpses of the creatures around them, casualties of heavenly wrath, ensured that no more harm would befall the soldiers.

The Crown Prince, by saving the lives of his subordinates, had ignited a fire of loyalty within them. Despite their lingering astonishment at the sudden downpour of lightning, their loyalty was burgeoning.

Augustus, standing there, surveyed the scene and clenched his teeth in anger.

"You... dare to harm our people of this country!"

He muttered quietly, then spoke loudly.

"Listen! Brave soldiers of our land! We have arrived, and the fate of these creatures is sealed!"

Augustus continued, "For from now on, we will defeat them all!"

The members of the Ultimate Magicians started gathering magical energy upon hearing Augustus's words.

"Knights, disengage for now!" Augustus commanded.

In response to his order, the knights activated their jet boots and quickly moved to the rear.

After confirming that there was no one left at the front line, Augustus shouted, "Release!"

The remaining creatures were bombarded with magic by the Ultimate Magicians.

Augustus and Mark, who was currently heading towards them, were the only ones who didn't participate in the spellcasting.

Nine of the Ultimate Magicians unleashed a collective burst of magic, causing an apocalyptic event.

The sheer power left even the soldiers of the Arlsheid Kingdom, who had witnessed the Ultimate Magicians' magic a few times before, in awe, their mouths agape.

However, this onslaught only took down about a dozen or so disaster-class creatures. Many more still remained.

Seeing this, Augustus spoke once again.

"Soldiers, gather your strength! We have each other; we will return alive!"

"Oooooooh!"

To return alive.

A moment ago, they were on the verge of giving up, but Augustus reminded them.

The knights, reinvigorated, once again pointed their swords toward the creatures.

"Magician Division! Unleash everything!"

With this command, countless spells rained down from the Magician Division, which vastly outnumbered the Ultimate Magicians.

"Knights, charge!"

The knights, not to be outdone, activated their jet boots and assaulted the creatures once again.

"We're going too!"

"Alice, Lin, let's annihilate these creatures!"

Alice and Lin, full of determination, led the way, with the members of the Ultimate Magicians joining the battle.

Though the manner of engagement was the same as at the beginning, having them on their side made all the difference for the Arlsheid Army. The Magician Division unleashed concentrated magical bombardments while the Knights pursued.

If things got dicey, Alice and the others provided support.

Feeling that the tides of battle had shifted in their favor, Augustus issued the next command.

"Claude!"

"Yes!"

The only one who didn't head out to combat the creatures, Sicily, who had been standing by Augustus, understood her role.

"Attend to the wounded soldiers! I implore you! Let's not allow anyone else to die!"

As a member of the Arlsheid royal family, whether noble or commoner, the people were treasures and assets alike. The soldiers, too, were equally valuable.

Augustus couldn't bear to lose more of them to creatures' attacks. So, he humbly requested Sicily's assistance in treating the severely wounded soldiers.

"Your Highness... Understood! Leave it to me!"

Normally, one would advise not to bow, but there was no time to spare now. Sicily hurried towards the section where the injured soldiers were being carried.

Watching Sicily rush away, Augustus called the commander of the garrison troops.

"Explain the situation. Have these creatures also appeared at the garrisons of other countries, or is it just our own?"

"Sir! We have confirmed that these creatures are present only in our area. They haven't appeared in other countries' territories."

"I see."

"Yes, and we've received word that various countries, after receiving our distress signals, are sending reinforcements."

"Thankful. If we can defeat these creatures, our bonds will grow even stronger."

"Yes, indeed."

If they can just defeat the creatures, their connections with other countries will become even more robust. For this reason, Augustus earnestly hoped that they could finish off the creatures without further incidents.

Upon receiving this mission from Augustus, Sicily arrived at the temporary relief station. There, she called over a resident healing magician.

"Bring in the severely wounded patients!"

Until a moment ago, intense battles had been taking place, and there was no shortage of wounded.

"Holy maiden! Please, heal me!"

"Hey! The Holy Maiden mentioned that the severely wounded should be treated first!"

This garrison unit also had healing magicians. However, having learned under Shin, receiving lectures about the structure of living beings and the cells that compose their bodies, and having practiced this in the healing facilities operated by the Church, there was no one in the Royal Capital of Arlsheid who did not know the name of Saint Sicily, a healing magic genius.

When it was known that Sicily was going to use her healing magic, the wounded began to pour in, disregarding the priority of the severely injured.

"Uh, excuse me, please listen!"

Sicily desperately tried to get the wounded to bring the severely injured patients first, but the soldiers, who were agitated due to the battle and their injuries, paid no attention.

At this rate, they wouldn't be able to fulfill the mission entrusted to Augustus.

At that moment, there was a small yet undeniable magical explosion above their heads. Startled by the sound, the wounded momentarily stopped moving.

"You there! Do you have the nerve to trouble our little sister?"

"Hehe... I wonder if people in trouble need some punishment?"

"Sister! You're safe!"

Calibrating their timing to the moment when the wounded had stopped moving, Sicily's sisters, Cecilia and Sylvia, admonished the wounded. They wore expressions of considerable anger, especially given the wounded soldiers' disregard for Sicily's words.

"Sicily had said, didn't she? Bring in the severely wounded patients who can't move on their own!"

"If you're dissatisfied, maybe I should turn you into a severely wounded patient?"

"Oh, big sister..."

Cecilia, who served as a mage unit member during this campaign and was part of the garrison force, scolded the soldiers. Sylvia muttered something ominous. Whether it was Cecilia's scolding or Sylvia's threat, the soldiers hurriedly began searching for the severely injured patients.

Consequently, soldiers who were unconscious and in visibly critical condition were brought in.

"This is..."

Upon seeing the soldiers who had been brought in, Cecilia was momentarily at a loss for words. Their arm bones were broken, with bones protruding, and some internal organs were exposed. To be honest, it seemed unlikely they would survive. Their injuries were that severe. And now Sicily intended to heal them.

The likelihood of failure was higher. If that happened, knowing Sicily, she might blame herself.

Worried about this, Cecilia and Sylvia spoke to Sicily.

"Sicily, well..."

"Even if they can't be saved, you don't have to push yourself, you know? So, you don't need to force yourself to heal them..."

"Cecilia, Sylvia..."

Sicily interrupted her two sisters midway.

"I understand your concerns. But it's okay. I've been trained in various ways by Shin."

"Huh?"

Even for someone skilled in healing magic, seeing injured humans wasn't something you'd get used to easily. Cecilia and Sylvia were surprised that Sicily was speaking so calmly in front of the severely injured soldiers and seemed unaffected by this dire situation.

Sicily immediately started treating the soldiers. First, she addressed the most critical issue, which was the torn abdominal area and the injured organs, disinfecting the area and repairing the intestines while placing them back into the abdominal cavity. After confirming there were no injuries to the organs, she proceeded to heal the abdominal wound.

As for the broken arm, while Shin might forcibly cut the nerve transmission and apply a form of anesthesia, Sicily couldn't quite mimic that technique. However, it seemed that Sicily's healing treatment was relatively painless. Sicily's healing magic had two main aspects. One was physical regeneration based on medical knowledge taught by Shin. The other was the original healing magic triggered by a strong desire to heal others, driven by a compassionate spirit.

While Sicily activated Shin's healing magic, her desire to help the patients brought about a secondary effect of pain relief.

The injured soldiers' wounds were rapidly regenerating. Those around them were astounded by this sight.

"...Phew, it's done! The wounds are healed, but the lost blood hasn't regenerated, so please keep them at rest in the rear!"

"Yes, understood!"

A significantly older soldier than Sicily responded to her announcement, sending her a respectful glance. He and another soldier used a stretcher to carry the healed soldier out.

"Next, please!"

"Sicily?"

"What's the matter, Cecilia?"

Cecilia, who was quite flabbergasted, decided to inquire about the recent treatment while Sicily prepared to treat the next patient.

"What was that? I've never seen healing magic like that..."

"Huh? Oh, that. Well, it's healing magic Shin taught me."

"Shin taught you?"

While treating the next patient, Sicily responded concisely.

Cecilia wanted to ask more, but Sicily seemingly believed her previous explanation was sufficient and chose not to say more.

"...Huh? Just that?"

"Yes? Because Shin develops magic... and just from that, you can tell it's something out of the ordinary."

"Oh, is that your perspective..."

Cecilia was taken aback. She was well aware of Sicily and Shin's affectionate relationship. Witnessing their overtly affectionate displays of affection, sometimes even in public, made her want to vomit with sweetness.

Therefore, Cecilia thought she would accept anything concerning Shin unconditionally. However, it seemed that this acceptance had a different connotation.

"Shin seems to think a bit differently from ordinary people."

"Differently?"

"Yes. Shin never received the basic or secondary education we did. But he's incredibly intelligent."

Cecilia and Sylvia were aware of this to some extent.

The "New Heroic Tale," in which Sicily appears as the main heroine, had been read countless times.

"It's hard to believe, but... Shin learned everything on his own. About natural phenomena, the structure of living organisms, and many other things, all through self-study."

"Self-study!?"

"But didn't the sages or mentors provide any education?"

Cecilia was amazed, and Sylvia expressed her doubt. However, a new patient was brought in at this point.

This patient appeared to have severe internal damage and was vomiting blood. Sicily used the ultrasound diagnostic magic she learned from Shin to locate the damaged parts within the organs, and then applied regenerative treatment. When she judged that the patient was recovering, Sicily asked the soldiers who had transported the previous patient to take them to the rear again.

In the interim before the next patient was brought in, Sicily answered Sylvia's earlier question.

"It seems that neither the grandpa nor the grandma taught Shin anything but how to use magic and create magical tools. He said that he had memorized things from books brought by the Harg representatives since he learned to read and write."

"He memorized them by himself..."

"Geniuses are something else, aren't they?"

Cecilia was astonished, and Sylvia was exasperated.

"This is the magic that Shin uses. It's far from ordinary."

Sicily's words brought agreement from Cecilia and Sylvia.

As the Magic King, known for being the magician king, Shin was certainly exceptional. He was living in a world that was difficult for ordinary people to comprehend.

Another patient was brought in during their conversation. Since less severe patients were being handled by other healing magicians, only seriously injured patients were arriving.

This time, the patient had an arm that was almost severed. Sicily carefully aligned the nearly severed arm, rejoining the bone, muscles, blood vessels, and even the nerves. When the treatment was complete, the knight was left in disbelief.

"I'm sorry, could you please make some room as the next patient is coming?"

"Yes, thank you very much, Saint."

With a bow, the soldier turned and rushed back to the battlefield.

"For Saint's sake! I'll do... huh?"

The soldier, who had rushed out with high spirits, suddenly stopped in his tracks.

Later, the soldier shouted.

"Monsters! Monsters are coming this way!"

At the words, those gathered at the makeshift medical station immediately turned around. What they saw was a massive wolf-like monster charging toward them, seemingly having broken through the encirclement.

"Oh no! We let our guard down because we were in the rear!"

"We won't make it in time!"

Although Cecilia and Sylvia had increased their magical control through Merlin-style practice, they still hadn't reached the point of casting spells without incantations.

As a result, Cecilia, who had been focused on treatment, couldn't stop the treatment in time, and it seemed the monster's sudden attack might succeed.

But Mark, who had arrived late, shouted, "I won't let that happen!" He quickly launched several thick spears of flame toward the wolf-like monster.

While the monster managed to dodge the initial attack, one of the spears, as if Mark had anticipated its escape route, hit the monster.

Cecilia and the others prepared to continue the attack, but it wasn't necessary. With just one magical strike, the catastrophic wolf-like monster, which had reached the point of causing a disaster, had a gaping hole in its body and was lifeless.

"Claude-san, are you okay?"

"Yes. Thanks to you, Bean-kun."

"I think I was a bit late, so I'll help guard this area."

"Thank you very much."

Their exchange was so light that it hardly seemed like they had just defeated a catastrophic monster. It was true that Shin was not just extraordinary but rather abnormal, and under his leadership, they, too, had become exceptional, Cecilia and Sylvia thought.

Turning their attention toward the battlefield, they wondered how the other exceptional individuals were doing. What they saw were monsters whose numbers had visibly decreased.

Perhaps just a few more to go. Cecilia's primary emotion at that moment was not admiration but amazement at how smoothly they had dispatched the monsters in such a short time.

Just as she was thinking that there should be no problem in defeating the monsters, a tremendous surge of magical power, strong enough to rival the Ultimate Magicians, was unleashed towards them.

"What the...?!" Even Cecilia and Mark couldn't help but look in the direction of the overwhelmingly powerful magic.

Mark couldn't help but shout, but August had also noticed the overwhelming magical power.

Though somewhat surprised, August erected a magical barrier and activated the defensive magic on his combat attire. He managed to protect himself from the incoming magic.

"Your Highness! Are you okay?" Thor, taken aback by the sudden incident, asked to ensure August's safety.

"I'm fine! But what was that just now? Where did the attack come from?"

August's suspicion was justified. They were facing a catastrophic-level monster, and while monsters were known to use magic for body enhancement, it was unheard of for them to use offensive magic like this. So who had cast this spell?

There was only one possible answer, but August hoped he was wrong.

As he cautiously scanned the area where the magic had been released, a voice spoke up, "Hey... if this is a joke, stop it."

Until now, they had been concealing their magical presence, which is why they hadn't been detected. Magicians had appeared.

"Well, well... blocking that last one, huh? Looks like it's not just Shin Wolford we should be cautious of."

The magician who was likely responsible for the attack had spoken.

As they looked at the magicians who had appeared, August had a foreboding sense that the situation had taken a turn for the worst.

If possible, he had hoped the magicians would stay quietly in the old imperial capital. After all, their leader, Oliver Strom, was supposed to be unable to discern a target and was likely a mere husk.

But it seemed he had moved.

This meant that Strom had received some kind of guidance for action. And, as it turned out, the action the magicians had taken was indeed combat.

August grit his teeth at this fact. The plan to capture the territory of the magicians had gone well, and they had set up their surveillance network. However, it seemed that the peace of humanity was not coming as easily as they had hoped.

August watched the magicians vigilantly. There were five of them who had appeared. Although August and his companions had defeated numerous magicians before, these magicians were different.

First of all, they appeared calm. They had suddenly cast a spell, but they didn't seem intoxicated with their power. But the most significant difference was...

"What... is this magical power?"

The black magic unique to the magicians. The amount of it was on a completely different scale.

"So you're different from the magicians we've faced before..."

"Of course, don't compare us to those incompetent fools."

The magicians appeared offended by August's words.

"You're quite harsh, aren't you? Weren't you once comrades?"

"Comrades? Don't say absurd things. We're magicians. We don't have any sense of camaraderie."

"Then why are you working together in a group?"

"Everything is for the sake of Lord Strom. All of our actions are in accordance with Lord Strom."

"Hmm. That's a lot of trust."

"Of course. Lord Strom is the reason for our existence. Those incompetents who betrayed him. Normally, we'd want to bury them ourselves."

"...,"

"Ungrateful pawns should be grateful they were used at all."

"Pawns..."

With those words, various realizations dawned on August.

The simplistic nature of the magicians' invasion, their amateurish tactics, and all the questions that had lingered before were now becoming clear.

"So, you're saying that everything those magicians did was at your command..."

"Heh heh. Those idiots had no idea."

This was the first time August had a calm conversation with the magicians. During this conversation, he realized that something was missing in them as humans. Probably, apart from Strom, nothing else really mattered to them. Even as magicians, they showed no value or regard for human life.

"Now, we haven't come here for no reason."

As the others were shocked by the revelation that they had discarded the defected magicians, the magicians began to explain their reason for being here.

"It's to get rid of you before the greatest threat, Shin Wolford, is gone!"

Starting with this statement, the magicians abruptly made their move.

And then, all five of them cast magic at once.

"Activate defensive magic equipment! Soldiers, fall back to the rear! Even if you get caught in it, don't mind it!"

August, who had defended against the unleashed magic using his magical barrier and magical equipment, issued orders for the soldiers to retreat.

The knights, realizing they couldn't get involved in the battle between the Ultimate Magicians and the magicians, hurriedly retreated. Even so, they couldn't outpace the speed of magic, and some of them were blown away into the air when the aftermath of an attack hit them as they used their jet boots to jump.

Having successfully defended against the magicians' magic, August, who seemed to know as if it were natural that Shin was not there, formed a hypothesis.

"Don't tell me! His Holiness the Pope was stabbed!?"

"Hmm, you noticed that, huh? Yes, we used someone brainwashed by us. For the time being, Shin Wolford will be tied up in East."

The magician sneered and revealed that he had separated Shin and August with his own plan. This infuriated August and his followers, who were devout followers of the Creator God.

"You scoundrels!! You used His Holiness the Pope as bait!?"

"Heh heh, yeah, yeah. He danced well for us, and we lured him in nicely. Now, let's see if we can kill him nicely."

The magicians then dispersed and started targeting one or more individuals.

"Whoa! Wait!"

Being at the front, Alice was the first to be targeted. She immediately activated the defense magic on her combat suit.

"This is... you're equipped with quite a troublesome magical tool!"

"Yep! It's Shin's special-made defense magic! You're in for a big surprise if you think it's easy to break!"

Alice had successfully blocked all the magic attacks and was about to counterattack when...

"We can't forget about this side."

"Huh? Aahhhh!"

As she was about to attack, her magical defense was momentarily dispelled. In that brief moment of vulnerability, another magician launched an attack.

"Corner!!"

It was the first direct attack the Ultimate Magicians had faced. August couldn't help but shout.

As for Alice, who had been hit by the magic:

"Ugh... I was so surprised! I thought I was dead!"

It seemed she had immediately reactivated her defensive magic, emerging unscathed.

August breathed a sigh of relief, but during that time, the magicians targeted another person and attacked them. They worked in groups, intentionally disarming the defense magic and attacking when the opportunity arose.

August's group, which outnumbered the magicians, attempted to surround and attack them. However, while attacking one person in a group, they were inadvertently led into the line of fire where their allies stood. This made them hesitate to cast magic, preventing them from transitioning to an offensive stance.

"That's it!"

Saying this, Tony dashed forward. He held a Vibroblade in his hand, intending to slice through the enemy using close combat rather than magic.

However...

"Charging in alone, you've underestimated us!"

"Ugh! Damn it!"

As Tony targeted one magician, another magician aimed and fired a spell at him.

In such a situation, they had to either halt their charge and deploy defensive magic or evade the attack. Tony quickly decided to evade the attack since stopping near the magician was deemed too dangerous.

"Argh! If you'd stopped, I would have tortured you to death!"

Upon hearing this, Tony felt a chill run down his spine. At this point, everyone had the same realization: these magicians were far stronger than any they had faced before.

However, this recognition didn't lead to an improved situation. While they managed to handle the magicians' magic, they were unable to cast spells themselves, and even if they could, the magicians easily dodged them.

The magicians, too, hadn't anticipated that August's group possessed such powerful defense magic tools. Frustration began to build on both sides as the magicians' initial expectation of quickly eliminating August's group was met with heavy resistance.

It became clear that this battle wouldn't reach a conclusion as it stood. Recognizing this, August discreetly whispered to Thor, who was nearby.

"I'm going to call Shin now. Please buy us some time."

"Understood."

While the magicians were focusing on others and preparing to launch attacks, August temporarily withdrew from the battlefield. He then took out a wireless communication device from his pocket and contacted Shin. It seemed that, in their judgment, the only option left was to deploy humanity's last resort.
