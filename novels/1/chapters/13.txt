to experience the wildlife in the Australian outback

"You should not include jokes in greetings.

I didn't know about that! In my past life, I had no choice but to rely on those memories, and in those memories, including humor in greetings was the basic way to make the atmosphere more pleasant.

I was agonizing over the newfound norms of this world and the fact that I had made a huge blunder in a public setting.

"I thought I was interesting, you know? Greetings in these kinds of situations are boring and tiring, don't you think?"

I was approached like this. Being at this table means they are in the same S class.

"I'm Alice. Alice Corner, to be exact. Nice to meet you, Shin Walford."

"Oh, nice to meet you."

"I thought your greeting earlier was interesting. Greetings were always painful during elementary and middle school. I bet a lot of students feel the same way, right? Most of the students were laughing just now, and I think there will be more people imitating you in the future."

"Is that so?"

"Yeah, it is. By the way, Shin."

"You can just call me Shin."

"Alright, Shin. So, you're the grandchild of Merlin and Merida, right?"

Not exactly, though. I wonder if they know that my grandparents are divorced.

"Well, yeah."

"Are they here today?"

"I think they're probably in the parents' section..."

Is this one of those situations where they want to be introduced?

"I see. Since we'll be classmates from now on, it would be nice to go and greet them, right?"

I've never heard of having to greet your classmates' parents before.

"Oh! That's not fair! I want to go too!"

"I want to go too."

"I want to go as well."

"I want to go too."

"I want to greet them too."

"I want to go as well."

Who is it!? There's a samurai here!

"Hmm? Is it a rule in this academy to greet classmates' parents?"

"Uh, Your Highness August..."

"Then it's only natural that I also pay my respects to my father."

"No, Your Highness! That's too impertinent!"

"Then stop saying foolish things and be quiet. Look, the teachers are glaring at us."

Huh? Wow, they're really glaring at us. Today, I'm getting scolded a lot.

"After this, we'll go to the classroom to socialize."

There are four classes in this academy: S, A, B, and C. Only S class has ten students, while the others have thirty each, making a total of 10 + 30 x 3 = 100 students in a year. The admission test results determine the class placement, with the top ten students in S class, which is considered an elite class. C class is at the bottom, but everyone has passed a highly competitive entrance exam. The class assignments are reorganized every year, so it's common for students to start in C class and graduate in S class or vice versa. I need to work hard to avoid embarrassing my grandparents, who are very prestigious.

Please forget about all the times I got scolded today. Please.

The classrooms are more like offices. The desks resemble office desks, are luxurious, and quite large. The chairs are leather-covered. It feels like the president's office or something, and I'm not the only one who thinks that.

"Wow, this desk is amazing. It's like your father's office desk."

"Yeah, it's really impressive."

"I've never seen such an impressive desk. The chair is amazing too. Just being here makes me nervous and tired."

"What, are you all that impressed?"

Only Aug is unfazed by it.

"It's just a piece of furniture; you'll get used to it eventually. Don't let that distract you from your real duties."

"Aug... you're amazing, as always."

"Well, it's not as good as the one in our home."

"Of course not!"

After all, this is a royal palace!

"Hey! Instead of being so fascinated by the furniture, sit down already. Your assigned seats are on the blackboard, so take your seats."

With that, the male teacher who had escorted us this far urged everyone to take their seats. Let's see, my seat is... Ah! Right in front of the teacher's desk, not bad!

But with only ten seats, it doesn't really matter where you sit.

The seating arrangement is based on a 3-4-3 system.

Thanks to the alternating pattern, you can see the blackboard from any seat.

As I take my seat, the male teacher takes the one at the teacher's desk.

"Now then, once again, congratulations on your admission. I am Alfred Marcus, the homeroom teacher for this class. I'm also in charge of practical magic, so let's get along. Now, after this, we'll introduce ourselves and discuss our plans for the days ahead. That will be it for today. So, let me start. As I mentioned earlier, my name is Alfred Marcus. I'm a graduate of this prestigious High Magic Academy and have been teaching for five years now. Before becoming a teacher, I was a member of the Royal Mage Corps for about five years. After serving for five years, I became a teacher due to a vacancy at the academy. So, I'm twenty-eight years old. The person I respect the most is the sage Merlin. Therefore, I'm very happy to be the homeroom teacher for this class. That's all."

Did he say something at the end? If he said something like that at the beginning, everyone would have to say something too.

"Now it's your turn. Let's go in the order of your admission rankings. So, starting with Shin Walford."

"Yes. Um, nice to meet you, whether it's your first time or not. I'm Shin Walford, as I mentioned in the welcoming speech. I've been living deep in the forest until recently, so I'm pretty clueless about the world. So, please don't abandon me if I do something strange. My grandpa taught me a variety of magic, and my grandma taught me how to create magical items. The people I admire the most are my grandpa and grandma. Nice to meet you."

"Private lessons with Merlin and Merida... How envy-inducing..."

Everyone seems to have mixed expressions of envy and jealousy. Are they all fans of my grandparents?

"Next is His Highness August, please."

"Yes. You probably already know, but there might be some people as clueless as Shin, so let me introduce myself again. I'm August von Arlsheid, the first prince of this country. However, as you know, this academy doesn't care about noble status. Just like with Shin, please treat me without any reservations. I pride myself on having a reasonable level of magical ability, although not as much as Shin. The people I admire the most are my father and, of course, the sage Merlin. I hope we can get along from now on."

Stop using me as a benchmark all the time! Seriously.

"Do you have a close relationship with His Highness?"

"I'm so jealous."

There's a samurai among them after all! Who is it?

"Next, Maria von Messina."

"Yes. Nice to meet you. I'm Maria von Messina, the second daughter of the Messina Earl's family. I didn't quite fit in with the girls' academy, and I can use magic to some extent, so I came to the Magic Academy. Just like His Highness mentioned earlier, I'd be happy if everyone could treat me casually. The person I admire the most is, of course, Instructor Merida. I aspire to be a strong and beautiful woman like her. Nice to meet you!"

It seems the girls' academy for nobility and the wealthy doesn't quite suit her. She doesn't give off that refined vibe.

"Next, Cecily von Claude."

"Yes. Nice to meet you, everyone. I'm Cecily von Claude, the third daughter of the Claude Viscount's family. I took the entrance exam for the Magic Academy, following Maria's lead. I'm very grateful to Maria for inviting me and allowing me to meet all of you wonderful people. I'm good at healing magic and not so good with offensive magic. I hope to support all of you in some way. The person I admire the most is Merida. I hope I can meet her someday. Nice to meet you."

Don't worry, Cecily. Grandma has been wanting to meet you. It's more like a quality assessment.

"Next, Alice Corner."

"Okay. Hi, everyone. I'm Alice Corner. There have been a lot of people from impressive families here, but I put a stop to that. My family is just common folks, and my dad works as the accountant for Harg Trading Company. Unfortunately, I'm not good at accounting, so I worked hard on magic instead. I'm really lucky to be in the same class as Shin. I admire Merida a lot. Nice to meet you."

Alice is a girl with short, blonde hair and blue eyes. She's kind of petite and frail-looking. We're the same age, but she gives off a little sister vibe. By the way, Harg Trading Company is the one run by Uncle Tom.

"Next, Thor von Frägel, please."

"Yes, I am Thor von Frägel. I am the eldest son of the Frägel Baron family. I was selected to be His Highness August's bodyguard and schoolmate from a young age, and I have been walking alongside His Highness ever since. This time, I came to the High Magic Academy with His Highness for his advanced magic education. I am also planning to become a magic occupation bodyguard. I have admired the sage Merlin, just like His Highness. Nice to meet you."

Thor is Aug's bodyguard and schoolmate. He has silver hair and round glasses. He's another small boy, and I mean a boy, not a young man. He's likely to be popular with the ladies.

"Next, Lynn Hughes."

"Yes. I'm Lynn Hughes. My father is a court magician, and my mother is a housewife. I love magic, so I came here. I admire Merlin. Nice to meet you."

That was short! Maybe she's not much of a talker? Lynn has short, black hair in a bob cut and wears slim glasses. She's a medium-sized girl. She's the first girl I've heard of who admires Grandpa. She said she loves magic and probably prefers magic over feminine things.

"Next, Yuri Carlton."

"Yup. Hi, everyone! I'm Yuri Carlton. My family runs a hotel. So, if any of you ever want to stay over quietly, just let me know. I'll give you special service. I'm better at bestowal magic, so I truly admire the strong and beautiful Merida. Nice to meet you."

I don't know, she seems a bit... erotic. She has a certain charm. Her way of speaking is a bit sweet. And Miss Carlton runs a hotel. She has the smell of being well-off!

"Next is Tony Fraid."

"Alright. Hello, everyone. I'm Tony Fraid. My family has a long line of knights, and my dad, mom, and older brother all went to the Knight Training Officer Academy, but a school with a 9:1 male-to-female ratio was torture for me. Anyway, I didn't want to go to that academy. But they told me they wouldn't accept me into the Magic Academy unless I made it into the S class. I worked my butt off. By the way, if you fall out of the S class, they'll drag you to the Knight Training Officer Academy. So, I'll do my best here. I admire Merlin, who got together with Merida, as a man. Nice to meet you all. Oh, and Mr. Carlton, let's connect when you want to use the hotel."

He's a tall, slender handsome guy with brown hair. I thought he might be a playboy, but he seems to be going through a lot due to his family circumstances. It's sad. But he's still a bit of a playboy.

"Finally, Julius von Rittenheim."

"I humbly introduce myself. I am Julius von Rittenheim, the eldest son of the Rittenheim Marquis family. Like Thor, I have been the guard and schoolmate of His Highness August since a young age. Since His Highness is advancing to the Magic Academy, I have also taken the entrance exam. I must admit that I had a hard time due to my weakness in magic. Nevertheless, I somehow managed to pass the entrance exam and sit at the same table with all of you, which is fortunate. I will continue to work hard, and I ask for your cooperation. I admire the sage Merlin and the former Knight Order Commander Michel."

There he is! This guy is a warrior! On top of that, his appearance, name, and way of speaking don't match! Despite his aristocratic name, he has muscular build, short blond hair that stands up, and blue eyes. He looks like an American football player, but he talks like a samurai. No, it's just weird!

But he doesn't look like a wizard at all. He looks more like a student at the Knight Training Officer Academy. He even said that he's not good at magic. Could it be...

"Ah, I understand what you all want to say, but the school didn't let His Highness enroll just to cater to him. It's purely Rittenheim's ability."

I see. I doubted my classmates...

I'm the worst...

"Just that Rittenheim is not good at releasing-type magic. He used body enhancement magic."

Body enhancement magic?

"He enhanced his leg strength and jumped to the target in a single leap... and then he used enhanced fists to destroy the target."

He's a pervert! He's a pervert wizard! I can say that, right? His use of magic is just weird!

"No, being praised this much makes me blush."

((Praising you? No way!))

Just after starting school, everyone's hearts came together.
