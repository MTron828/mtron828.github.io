 a story
about Sharky, a tooth-brushing shark superhero

"A tendency for trouble is contagious."

"That can't be true!"

After being falsely suspected and feeling quite down following their visit to the Kingdom of Darm, the protagonist heads to the Kingdom of Caranan, which is known for its thriving livestock industry, the day after. They also make a quick return to Arlsheid at night to check if there's any information about the demons.

So far, there's nothing. Nevertheless, it's quite a hassle to keep going back every time.

I wonder if there's a way to make a wireless communication device?

"Shin... are you thinking about something dangerous again?"

"No, nothing like that. By the way, the Kingdom of Caranan is famous for textiles, right?"

"Yes, that's correct. Especially the fabric made from the wool of demonized sheep is well-known. Why do you ask?"

"Well, this cloak of mine has temperature control and optical camouflage, but it doesn't have the healing enchantment."

"Healing? Oh, you mean what happened in the Kingdom of Suid, right?"

Yes, the enchantments applied are primarily for the protection of the wearer. However, as a result, they cannot bestow the benefits of those enchantments on someone else. If the cloak had the same "automatic healing" enchantment as the uniform or combat attire, Sisily wouldn't have had to suffer so much in the Kingdom of Suid.

People in this world all have magical power, so even if they can't use magic, they can activate magic tools. Like Ellie, who uses the cloak.

In that case, even severely injured patients like Sisily, who couldn't be treated in Sisily, could be healed by having someone activate a cloak with the "automatic healing" enchantment. It used to be possible with the uniform, but not with the combat attire... and Sisily was prevented by those around her.

"I want to apply a new enchantment to the cloak. But the current cloak is already full in terms of character count, so I'm wondering if I can add a healing enchantment as lining or padding."

"Why not buy a new one?"

"I wish I could make it from fabric made with demonized giant spider silk. But it's not suitable for the cloak or the lining. It was tough to find a fabric that can withstand the character count for the cloak."

"I see. In that case, when we arrive in the Kingdom of Caranan, I'd like to look for the fabric that could be used for the cloak. Is that okay?"

"Anyway, let's descend. We should defeat these sheep if there are no shepherds nearby."

"Agreed."

As soon as everyone landed on the ground, they canceled their levitation magic.

And just when they were about to check if there were any shepherds nearby...

"Yahhhh!"

A muscular man with a large axe jumped out of the nearby bushes.

What was that weapon called again? It's like a combination of a spear and an axe.

"Ha... Halcyon!"

"It's a halberd."

"..."

Oh no! How embarrassing! I blurted it out without thinking!

While I was blushing over my mistake, the man cut off the head of the demonized sheep and finished it off.

With his muscular body, wielding a halberd instead of a shepherd's staff, and wearing a different kind of robe than a wizard, it was clear that he was indeed a shepherd.

"Hey! Travelers, huh? Are you all right?"

"Yes, we're fine."

"But seriously, it was dangerous. What are you doing in a place like this?"

"Well, we saw the sheep demonize, and we thought we should take care of it if there were no shepherds around."

"Hey, you shouldn't be so reckless. You look like you've just come of age, and you're already hunting demons. It's too early for that."

"It's not a big deal. Look."

Since a while ago, I've been sensing sheep on the verge of demonizing with my detection magic, and one of them just demonized. I cast a wind blade spell toward it.

The demonized sheep had its head severed in an instant and collapsed on the spot.

"See? Everything's fine, right?"

The shepherd, who had been watching the scene in astonishment, suddenly burst into laughter.

"What a kid! You're pretty strong, aren't you? And you're a wizard too?"

"Well, yes, I am."

He patted me on the back while laughing merrily.

Such incredible strength! My back hurts!

"I see, I see. But I'm sorry, even if you defeat demonized sheep, you can't do much with them. They have to be handled by 'National Sheep Breeders' like us with the right qualifications."

"Oh, I see."

Shepherds need a national qualification!? Does Caranan Kingdom really have such a qualification?

"Anyway, we just couldn't leave the demons unattended, so please don't mind."

"Is that so? My apologies. Are you travelers headed to the capital?"

"Yes, we are."

"In that case, when you arrive in the capital, I recommend 'Shepherd Outfitters.' They have a wide range of clothing and equipment suitable for travelers like you."

"Oh, really? Thank you."

"No problem, it's my treat. After all, I easily captured one demonized sheep without much effort. It's our way to show gratitude."

"Haha, well then, we should get going."

"Sure, I'm Garan. If we have the chance, we'll meet again!"

"I'm Shin. Until we meet again."

Saying so, I shook hands with Garan and left the place.

I heard some useful information. Shepherd Outfitters, I should check it out when we arrive in Caranan Kingdom.

"That guy had quite a physique, didn't he?"

"Yeah, with that one-shot kill and all, maybe the shepherds in this country are stronger than the soldiers."

"They mentioned 'National Sheep Breeders,' so perhaps Caranan Kingdom's shepherds are elite."

In my past life's knowledge, shepherds had a low social status, but it seems to be different in this country.

After the encounter with the National Sheep Breeders of Caranan Kingdom, we reached the capital of Caranan Kingdom. We had a similar exchange at the entrance gate as we did in Darm Kingdom, and we also found accommodation in the same manner.

"Amazing! So fluffy!"

"This is quite something. The amount of wool used here is significantly more than what we have at my house."

We had taken two rooms, just like last time, with eight people in each. When we gathered in one of the rooms, May-chan dived onto the bed and exclaimed, and Ellie mumbled upon seeing the quantity of wool used in the beds.

Having more wool in the bedding here compared to what's used by royal and ducal families is likely because there are more sheep than people in this kingdom.

"By the way... Shin, your family's bedding doesn't use wool, right?"

"What are you talking about, Sisily? Do you already know about Shin's bedding too?"

"Huh? No, it's not like that! When I went to your grandmother's room, she showed it to me!"

"I see, I thought for a moment that you knew all about Shin's bedding comfort and all."

"Jeez, Maria!"

Sisily and Maria are playing around in Grandma's room, but why did you go to Grandma's room?

"What did you go to Grandma's room for?"

"Well, Grandma seemed to have hurt her back a bit during her training, so I went to help her with her treatment."

"Grandma..."

She's getting up there in age, so take it easy, Grandma...

"So, I had her lie down on the bed for her treatment... But at that time, I noticed that the mattress was different. What is that? Grandma said she didn't know either."

"Oh, that... It's made from the memory foam-like material of tree bark we found in the forest. We gathered it and used it to make the mattress."

Cork is also made from tree bark, but there was a type of tree with softer, more memory foam-like bark. I had always admired memory foam mattresses in my previous life, so I made the mattress right away.

"Memory foam? Can you sleep on something like that?"

"It's amazing, really. Grandma asked if I wanted to try it, so I lay down on it, but I almost fell asleep."

"Is that so?"

"It's just that... It feels like your body is floating or being enveloped."

"So, that much?"

"Come to think of it, the bedding placed on top was incredibly light. Why is it so light?"

"Huh? Shin, you come from a wealthy family..."

Alice had her doubts, and there's a reason for that.

In this world, bedding made from sheep's wool is the mainstream, and the more wool is used, the higher the quality. What surprised Ellie and May-chan was the sheer amount of wool used in the bedding. Moreover, if there's more wool, the bedding becomes heavier. Light bedding is generally considered cheap.

"Ah, our family doesn't use sheep's wool for bedding."

"You told us that already... So what do you use?"

"Down feathers."

"Bird feathers..."

Everyone's looking at me with puzzled expressions.

In this world, the effectiveness of down feathers is not yet known.

"Well, you should try it someday. You'll be surprised."

"Is that so? Well, I think Sisily will feel it soon enough."

"Maria!"

Leaving aside the Wolford family's bedding situation, we set off to pursue our individual goals in this country.

The women went shopping, and I decided to visit the Shepherd Outfitters store that Garan, the shepherd, recommended.

All of our cloaks, including Aug's, have already been entrusted to them. We want to have them tailored right there.

"Wolford-kun, may I come with you?"

I was stopped by Mark just as we were about to leave the inn.

"Sure, but are you also looking for materials?"

"That too, but I'm also interested in what materials you'll choose and what kind of processing you'll do."

As expected of the son of a blacksmith, he seems to have an interest in craftsmanship.

"In that case, I'll be alone, so can I come with you?"

"Sure, let's go with three of us."

In the end, the men and women split into two groups.

We easily found Shepherd Outfitters when we asked the people at the inn. It seems to be a well-known clothing store in Karnan Kingdom. They may not have the latest fashion, but they offer a wide selection of clothing necessary for traveling, such as coats and other items, all made from wool from monsters that have transformed into sheep. The owner is a National Sheep Farmer, and the store is well-known for having a rich selection of fabrics and clothes.

I received a great recommendation. This store has exactly what I'm looking for.

On our way to Shepherd Outfitters, we also checked out other shops.

"Karnan Kingdom is indeed impressive. There are many clothing and fabric shops."

"The shop I saw earlier specializes in men's clothing. There were a few items I liked just from a quick look."

"Shall we stop by on our way back? I found some nice clothes too."

"That sounds good. Let's do that."

We took a detour while discussing our plans and continued on our way to the main destination.

And the store we arrived at...

"It's huge!"

"This is amazing..."

"It's a four-story building."

I hate to say it, but it's even bigger than Mark's family workshop. Both the floor area and the number of stories.

We quickly stepped into Shepherd Outfitters.

"Welcome."

Unlike the shop we had visited earlier, the store was filled with an air of luxury. The staff also had a refined demeanor.

But the store is so large that it's a bit of a challenge to find what we're looking for. We should ask the staff for guidance.

"Excuse me."

"Yes, how may I assist you?"

I explained my purpose for coming to the store and asked if they had any fabric suitable for use as the lining or padding for a mantle that can be enchanted.

"Are you looking for material that can receive enchantments for a mantle lining or padding?"

"Yes, this is the mantle."

"I see, I'll take a look."

I showed my mantle to the staff and asked them to help me find suitable materials.

"This is... You're using quite good materials."

"By the way, I've added eight characters to it."

"E-eight characters on a mantle?"

The mantle prioritizes durability. It's not common to have a large number of characters for enchantment.

"I'm also using good lining material... So I have to increase the padding. But it can get quite hot in the summer, you know?"

"Oh, that's not a problem."

The mantle is air-conditioned, after all.

"Is that so? However, when it comes to padding that can be enchanted, there's nothing but wool from monsters that have transformed into sheep..."

"That's fine. Can you process this quantity?"

I take out all thirteen mantles, including Ellie's and Mei-chan's, from my storage.

"This many?"

"In total, it's fourteen. Can you do it?"

"That's no problem, but... in that case, the price..."

"I'll throw in some extras for those."

"Owner!"

"Owner?"

When the staff was about to discuss the price for the materials and processing of a total of fourteen mantles, a voice called out from behind.

"Oh, it's you after all, Garan."

"Yeah, he came right away. Welcome, Shin."

"Is this person an acquaintance of the owner?"

"Yeah! This Shin is amazing. He killed a monster sheep with a single spell."

"A single spell!? Was he such a high-ranking mage?"

"High-ranking...? He's just a sheep."

"Ahahaha! I knew it, he's one of those. You seemed unsatisfied with regular monster sheep."

"Killing a monster sheep so easily..."

Huh? But it's just a sheep, right? Even if it's classified as a medium-sized monster, it's not like it's a wild boar or a wolf.

As I thought that, Mark tugged at my sleeve.

"Maybe in Wolford's perception, it's just a medium-sized monster sheep... But generally, medium-sized or larger monsters are considered quite threatening."

"Well... we've been dealing with tigers and lions recently, so our sense of danger has become somewhat warped..."

"Oh, what's wrong?"

"It's nothing."

"I see. Well, since he's such a high-level mage, if he gets equipment processed at our shop, it'll enhance our shop's reputation. Besides, he hunted some sheep for us."

Our shop, huh?

"So the owner being a National Sheep Farmer refers to Garan-san?"

The "shop" was Garan-san's, I see.

"Hey, it's Garan Shepard. As a token of appreciation for hunting the sheep, I thought I'd introduce you to the shop."

So he introduced his shop to us. We were lucky.

"Thank you very much. The quantity is quite large, so this helps."

"Sure, how about materials and processing costs... What do you think of this?"

"O-Owner! That's almost the cost price! And it includes processing costs..."

Garan-san covered the mouth of the shopkeeper who was making a fuss.

"Shut up, it's fine like this. Is it good?"

The shopkeeper, who was causing a scene just a while ago, looked dejected.

Is she... is she okay?

"For us, it's more than we could have hoped for... Is it really okay? You'll hardly make a profit like this, right?"

"Well, profits aren't just about money. You guys will become well-known mages sooner or later. When that happens, if the equipment we processed for you becomes known to be from us... then we'll make our money then."

Garan-san said that with a grin.

Cool, Garan-san is so cool.

"I understand. Well then, please. I'll do my best to meet your expectations, Garan-san."

"Good! Do your best!"

With a hearty laugh, Garan-san agreed to process our equipment.

According to the shopkeeper, the processing should be done by tomorrow, so we decided to pick it up before we left.

That's a relief... the shopkeeper was okay...

"Well, we got lucky. I was prepared for a bigger expense."

"But... is it really okay? Getting it cheaper that way..."

Mark threw this question into the air. It's true, it's not something you hear about much in this world.

"Why not? It's like a mutually beneficial deal. In a way, we're becoming an advertisement for their shop in exchange for a lower price. Both sides benefit, so all that's left is for us to build our reputation."

"Still, I think we've already built quite a reputation."

But if that's the case, maybe we should consider putting in the company logo? It might end up looking like some kind of uniform. Well, let's think about that later. After accomplishing our goals in this country, we decided to check out everyday clothing at a clothing store we passed by.

Choosing everyday clothes is nice since we don't have to think about enchantments.

The planned amount turned out to be quite a bit less than expected, so we spent the extra money on various things.

"How about it? Will they be able to do the enchantments you were looking for?"

As we were going around a shop, meeting up with Ogg and the others after their negotiations, it seems their meeting was similar to what we experienced in the Darm Kingdom. Since there wasn't anything particularly noteworthy, the three of us guys continued shopping, had lunch at a food stall, completed souvenir and other purchases, and finally returned to the inn.

"Phew... shopping is fun, but it's tiring."

"Yeah, it is. I get tired even from my own shopping."

"Maybe it would be better to skip shopping with the girls, too?"

It seemed like Mark and Tony shared the same opinion... Ogg and the others didn't seem to fully grasp the idea, as they were in a unique situation with their fiancées, and shopping with just the two of them was out of the question.

I've been shopping in Claude and Cecily's town a few times... I'll just say that girls' shopping is the same everywhere.

"By the way, when are we picking up the cloaks?"

"We'll pick them up tomorrow, right before we leave. We'll use the shop's workshop and enchant them right away."

"Got it."

"We're back!"

It seems the ladies returned while we were discussing tomorrow's plans. They are all hands-free thanks to their personal storage spaces, but just how much clothing do they stuff in there...

"Hah... I had so much fun. It's my first time visiting so many shops."

"Let's go again sometime, Cecily!"

"We are your escorts, so no need to worry."

"Haha, indeed. Let's go again."

"I want to go, too!"

"Don't worry, Mei, I'll take you with me!"

"That's great!"

The ladies are quite lively...

We had other matters to attend to, so we spent less time shopping than the ladies, but even so...

"...Let's not bring up the topic of shopping. If they ask us to join them, we can't resist."

"Oh, Lord Augustus."

"What's wrong, Cecily?"

"Did you do some shopping, Lord Augustus?"

Oh, they're bringing up the subject... from over there?

"Oh, yes... After our meeting, I joined Shin and we visited a few shops..."

"I see... Hey, Lord Augustus?"

"W-What is it?"

"Next time... would you like to visit some shops together?"

"Well... I suppose so..."

Oh, Augustus's face seems to be twitching...

"Uh, Shin?"

"Huh? Oh, what is it?"

Is it my turn now? An invitation to go shopping?

"Well, I found this during our shopping trip. I thought it might suit you, Shin."

Saying this, Cecily took a black jacket from her personal storage space.

"Shin, you often wear black jackets, so I thought you might like it."

"Cecily..."

Oh, I'm so happy.

"May I try it on?"

"Yes, please!"

After putting it on, the jacket fit perfectly.

"Yeah, it looks cool. I really like it. Thank you, Cecily."

"No problem, I'm glad you like it."

Cecily smiled as she spoke.

I'm glad I bought it too.

"Cecily, I have something I want to give you."

"Huh?"

Saying that, I took out several scarves from my personal storage.

"I thought they'd suit you, Cecily. What do you think?"

"Wow, thank you!"

Cecily immediately opened one of the scarves and wore it draped over her shoulders.

"Thank you, Shin, I'm so happy!"

"I'm glad you like them."

"Shin..."

"Cecily..."

"Hey! This is a cafeteria! It's a public place!"

Maria's comment snapped us back to reality.

Whoa, that was close!

Other customers who had been watching our interaction began making playful comments.

"Geez! It's embarrassing to watch you two!"

Sorry, Maria. Unexpected gifts got us carried away.

"Oh... oh..."

Cecily, who had snapped back to reality, wouldn't recover for a while.

Are we still able to eat?

"By the way, we didn't have any trouble on our end today, but how about you, Ellie and the others?"

"No, being a group of eight, no men approached us."

Hm... I doubt we'll get away without any trouble... Everyone, stay vigilant to the end.

"Yes!"

Damn! They're acting as if trouble is a given, and I can't say anything in response!

"Oh... oh..."

Cecily isn't helping me out here!

On the last day, still feeling down, we headed to the Shepard Garment Shop to pick up the cloaks before our departure.

"Hey there! Good morning!"

"Good morning. The processing of the cloaks is complete."

"Thank you. May we borrow the workshop?"

"The workshop... is it?"

"Yes, we'd like to apply the enchantment right away."

The shop assistant looked puzzled, and then their eyes widened.

"You can apply the enchantment yourself?"

"Wow, it's amazing. You can use magic to that extent, but you can't apply enchantments?"

"Well, yeah."

"Wow."

While Galan was impressed, I rented the workshop to apply the automatic healing enchantment to all fourteen cloaks.

"Oh, you're done already?"

"Yes, thank you. We'll be on our way."

"Sure, anytime..."

"W-Wait, Galan!"

Just as we were about to say our farewells, a young shepherd burst in, looking frantic.

"What's going on? What happened?"

"S-Sir, the sheep..."

"The sheep, what happened?"

"The sheep... they've transformed into monsters in large numbers!"

"What?!"

Of all times, it had to happen now.

"I knew it, trouble had to come..."

"In situations like this, credibility becomes more apparent."

"It's not my fault!"

It's not, right? Please say it isn't!

"I'm sorry, Shin, but we've got a problem to handle. We need to go."

"Oh, we'll go with you."

"Huh? Well, I appreciate that, but... are you sure?"

"Yes, and if we help here, our names might gain some recognition, right?"

I conveyed this, and Galan briefly looked surprised before bursting into laughter.

"Hahaha! You're right! Well then, can I count on you?"

"Yes, leave it to us."

"Wait! Galan, what are you thinking?"

"Hm? Ah, don't worry. Shin and his friends are strong."

"It's not just one or two, you know! What do you expect kids like them to do?"

Well, we've only just become adults, but still, you can trust what Galan says, right?

"Don't you believe what I say?"

"Oh... No, it's not that..."

"Don't worry. I've seen Shin and his friends in action. They're more than capable. In fact, I'm worried we might slow them down."

"G-Galan, slowing them down?"

"Whoa! We don't have time for this. Shin, let's go!"

"I understand. Mei-chan and Ellie, you can watch from the top of the city walls. Oug, can you stay with them?"

"Hmm... we might need to explain things to the people from the visiting country later. All right, I'll be their escort."

"It's a bit unusual for you, big brother, to be the escort."

"That's true... usually, it's the other way around."

"Well, let's go."

"Wait! Hold on!"

"Then, everyone, see you later."

"Yeah. Let's go."

"Yes!"

"Why are you so carefree... this isn't just for fun."

The young shepherd who came to get us muttered, but come on, they're just sheep, right? We're used to hunting tigers and lions, so there's no tension here.

I refrained from saying that out loud to avoid more trouble and stepped outside the city walls. There, we were greeted by many shepherds, aside from Galan.

"Hey, Galan, you're here!"

"Welcome, Galan!"

"Welcome!"

Wow, burly shepherds bowed in unison to Galan.

The only one who didn't bow was the guy who spoke to Galan informally.

Still, the sight of these robust guys in robes with halberds in hand is quite intimidating.

They all have the same halberd. Could it be a symbol of the National Sheep Farm...?

"By the way, who are these kids?"

The guy who spoke informally to Galan stared at us and asked.

Come on!

"Don't glare at them, Barak. This is Shin. He's here to help with this incident. Oh, and I'll tell you this now, but these guys are quite high-level mages. No need to ask if they can fight."

"If you say so, I won't press further... But why are they helping?"

Well, that's a reasonable question. Only the National Sheep Farm is allowed to handle the sheep that have transformed into monsters. Apart from soldiers, there's no benefit to this extermination.

"I've received various favors from Galan, so it's a way of repaying him."

"Haha, I see. So it's payback. I get it."

Oh? He seems to find it funny. I'm glad I wasn't glared at.

"They're coming! It's a flock of sheep!"

As I talked to Barak, a friend of Galan, someone shouted.

Wow, this is amazing. Are all of those sheep monsters? At a rough glance, there are at least a hundred... no, more like two hundred.

"Don't be afraid, everyone! Instead, think of it as an opportunity to earn some rewards!"

Galan's call changed the expressions of the shepherds.

Everyone wore ferocious smiles as they observed the flock of sheep.

Well, it's all about perspective!

"Shin, could you avoid using fire magic that might damage the wool?"

"How about minor injuries?"

"It's fine since we'll be using the wool for thread. Minor damage won't be an issue."

"I see. We'll avoid using fire magic, then."

"Got it."

What a relaxed response, lacking any tension.

While we were discussing this, the flock of sheep drew nearer.

Alright, I should make the first move.

Thinking that, I cast a spell towards the ground.

Right in front of the flock of sheep, pointed stakes suddenly protruded from the ground.

"Meaaah!!!"

A dozen or so sheep leading the pack were skewered, and their agonizing bleats echoed.

The shepherds, stunned by this sight, seemed dumbfounded.

"More are coming! Be ready!"

At the voice of reason, the shepherds snapped back to attention and began defeating the sheep that had crossed over one after another.

Wow, this is amazing. The group of robust men are wielding halberds, hunting down the sheep one after another.

As for us, we're using magic like Wind Blades and Water Blades to defeat them one after another.

And like that, the flock of sheep was exterminated in no time.

Well, they are just sheep after all.

It's not like they were led by wolves.

On another note, the soldiers were also participating in the extermination, but the shepherds were overwhelmingly stronger.

I wonder if the strongest in this country is indeed the shepherds?

As I was thinking about this, the shepherds said...

"Amazing! We didn't expect it to go this smoothly!"

"Really... It feels like these kids pretty much did all the extermination, doesn't it?"

"Uh... I'm sorry for what I said earlier."

The shepherds gathered around.

"Well, they are sheep."

"That's true."

"It's incredible that you can say that... But what do these kids usually hunt?"

"Haha, well, I think that's fine."

"Given how strong they are, they might even be able to hunt tigers and lions."

"I doubt that."

"That's for sure!"

"Hahaha!"

Oh, so they really have that perception. I'm glad I didn't mention it.

As I was talking to the shepherds, Oug's group joined us.

Now, with this done, it should be smooth sailing, and we can finally set off, right?

"Thanks for your help this time. I'm Barak. Barak Crook."

"I'm Shin, Shin Wolford."

Barak extended his hand for a handshake, so I introduced myself and shook his hand in return.

Come to think of it, I didn't tell Galan my last name.

Since Galan only mentioned his name, I also introduced myself with just my name, and I realized I didn't give my last name.

"Wolford? Is that the same last name as the hero?"

"Huh, is it famous outside of Earlshide too?"

"Of course. The epic of the Sage Merlin Wolford is widely read all over the world. I, too, admired it when I was a child."

"I see... My grandpa would be ecstatic if he heard that."

"Grandpa?"

"Yeah, Merlin Wolford is my grandpa."

"What? Huh?"

"Is the conversation over? Well, it's time to depart."

"Right, understood. Well then, Galan, Barak, excuse me."

Ah, we can finally set off. Next is the Kurt Kingdom. By the way, I haven't heard an explanation about this country yet.

With these thoughts in mind, we left the Carnan Kingdom.

"Ehhhh?!"

I could hear some shouting from behind, but I ignored it.
