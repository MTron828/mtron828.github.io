The three major world leaders are bowing their heads together.

...Wait, what is this!?

"Hey, wait! Why are you bowing your heads!?"

The atmosphere around us has turned freezing!

In such an unusual atmosphere, the three of them raised their heads.

And, on behalf of them, Pope Ekaterina began to explain.

"We are facing a crisis in the world like never before. To confront such a desperate situation, we needed a leader."

Well, I understand what she's trying to say.

In such a desperate situation, a formidable figure is needed to lead the people.

"We found the perfect person to be that leader. He is the grandson of the hero who once saved the world and has already defeated numerous demons himselfâ€”a modern hero."

Saying that, she looked at me.

I don't have that kind of self-awareness, and I haven't really had that much of a struggle, so being called that way feels a bit awkward.

"Shin, no one among the heads of state from various countries objected to making you the leader. That's how much overwhelming support you had when I made that speech at that time."

So, the speech at the departure ceremony was not a unilateral decision but a unanimous one.

"But we forgot to seek the support of the one person we should have most."

Yeah, I didn't hear anything about it. I was really surprised.

"In such a globally-watched moment, we did something that could change Shin's life without his permission. I came to apologize for doing that without your consent. I'm truly sorry."

"I apologize. You're right."

"My bad, Shin."

Saying so, the three of them bowed their heads again.

Well, I understand that now. But can national leaders just bow their heads so easily?

That's why this location was chosen. It's not an official setting, everyone is gathered here, and Deceum is here too. This is a unique opportunity. So, I asked Merida and Merlin to bring you here.

I see, that makes sense.

It's not easy to bow your head casually in an official setting. Moreover, if they were to apologize for promoting me in a public place, Ekaterina's trust might be compromised. But I do want them to apologize for doing it without my consent.

"By the way, at that time, you mentioned that there were others accompanying you! So, could it be that..."

"That's right. At that time, Ekaterina, who was a fledgling oracle, and Aaron, a traveling merchant, were with me. They were both my junior disciples."

Having three people who would later become heads of state at a party, what kind of party was that!?

But now I understand why Uncle Dis was calling Ekaterina by her first name and President Aaron was using her nickname, Kache.

"Back then, I used to get scolded by my mentor all the time..."

"I thought my head would change shape a few times too..."

Ekaterina Pope and President Aaron muttered with a distant look in their eyes.

It seems like it was quite a tough past...

"We used the grandchild of that mentor for our plans. It's only natural to be scolded."

"We were quite cornered at that time... It's as expected from our mentor's grandchild! So, we jumped at Kache's idea."

"What? Should I give you a punishment too? What? Boy?"

"Oh! Mentor! I already knelt and received a lecture!"

"Well, it's fine. I'll forgive you for that."

President Aaron, who escaped punishment from Grandma, was openly relieved.

The party attendees watched in disbelief.

It's understandable. The President of the Els Free Trade Union is behaving like a scolded child in front of everyone. He's famous for being a self-made man, so the confusion is probably greater.

"Hahaha. Aaron, especially, won't be able to stand up to Mentor Merida, I'm sure. After all, he got the rights to sell her magical tools when we disbanded the party."

"Uncle Dis, what do you mean?"

"When we disbanded the party, I received the rights to sell Merida's magical tools."

Ah, I see.

He rose to the position of President thanks to those magical tools and eventually became the President. It's no wonder he can't stand up to her. Instead of a mentor, she's more like a benefactor.

"Ekaterina too. Thanks to Merida's guidance, after returning to East, she became known as a saint and even rose to the position of Pope."

"Really... I can't say anything about myself either. We're quite pitiful grandparents."

"That's right..."

The grandparents, who had inadvertently made their grandchild uncomfortable, both sighed.

"You have wonderful grandchildren who care about the two of you. Shin, you may be a bit foolish, though."

"Heh."

They seemed pleased to receive praise for their grandchild. Despite calling him foolish, Ekaterina couldn't help but smile at Merida's expression, which seemed to be full of joy.

"Well, even if you say that, it doesn't have to be today, does it? It's not appropriate to discuss gloomy matters on such a happy occasion."

"...You're right. But please tell us one day."

"Of course."

"Understood."

Satisfied with the apparent determination of the two, Ekaterina approached the table to enjoy a drink that she normally didn't have the opportunity to partake in.

Watching her, Merlin and Merida murmured with deep emotion.

"Really, that young girl..."

"People grow up. We should learn from her."

"That's right."

Saying that, they both watched Ekaterina's back, having grown up.

"Um... what about me?"

Leaving Aaron behind.

As the alcohol began to flow, the atmosphere became chaotic.

Everyone present in this setting, except Mei-chan, is an adult, so they can drink. We, on the other hand, have the "foreign object rejection" pendant, which eliminates excessive alcohol, so we only get slightly tipsy.

However, the others were rather outrageous, especially...

"Shin-kun! Are you drinking?"

"Yes, I am... drinking."

"Ekatereena... you're really somethin'. There's no way you should have a child like Shin-kun, you know?"

"Well, you're right."

Ekaterina is completely drunk.

She had mentioned that she doesn't usually get to drink much, so this is probably the first time in a while that she's had this much to drink. The drinking games have been relentless since a while ago.

"That person's gone... when I go back to my country, they call me a saint... in the end, I'm single until this age..."

Oh, come on, she's even getting into a depressive mood.

As I searched for words to comfort her, Ekaterina suddenly lifted her head, grabbed my shoulder, and shouted, "I've got it, Shin-kun! You should call me 'Mom'!"

"Buhuh!"

"Mom!?"

Ekaterina said something outrageous, and everyone who had been worried about the pope getting completely drunk burst into laughter.

What is she saying? What is she thinking!?

"You can't possibly call me that! What are you thinking!?"

"Why not? Since you're the grandson of the pope, doesn't that make you my child, in a way?"

"Why would that be!?"

Oh dear, the drunken logic is incomprehensible!

"Mmm... then, Sicily-chan!"

"Yes!"

"Since you're called 'her holiness' after me, can you call me 'Mom'?"

"T-That's too presumptuous!"

"Don't be afraid! Call me 'Mom'..."

Oh dear, she's completely out of it.

Ekaterina slumped on the table and began to snore.

"I... didn't want to see the Pope like this..."

"She must be accumulating a lot of stress. She's not only a head of state but also the Pope of the Creationism Faith."

Oug, who is destined to become a king in the future, defended Ekaterina compared to Maria, who had a complex expression.

Certainly, she's likely to be stressed out. Today, in this setting, she had people like her grandparents, who are even more significant than her, so she probably let her guard down.

And...

"Slaine... I'm lonely..."

Ekaterina muttered in her sleep.

Slaine? Could it be the deceased lover Ekaterina mentioned earlier?

Perhaps remembering that had caused her to lose control even more.

"Sigh... this child... I'm sorry. Thanks to this child, the party has become a mess."

"No, not at all! I never expected the Pope to celebrate my birthday!"

"That's right! It's an honor for a lifetime!"

"It's because of this child..."

"Mumble mumble... hehe."

Although she had tears in the corners of her eyes just a while ago, now she was peacefully asleep with a happy expression. Grandmother sighed once again.

"Well, should I put this child to bed in the room?"

With those words, Grandma had Grandpa carry Ekaterina and was about to leave the hall.

"Oh, right, I almost forgot."

"Oops, that's right."

Upon hearing Grandpa's words, Grandma took two boxes out of a dimensional storage.

"I forgot to give you presents."

Oh, come to think of it, I didn't receive any, did I? But why are there two boxes?

"One is for Maria, and the other is for you."

"Oh, thank you."

What Maria received from the box was a hairpin.

It's a nice match for my gift.

"This is a magical item. When you wear it in your hair, it will flow magic and keep your hair beautiful."

"Wow! Thank you, Lady Merida! I'm so happy!"

I see. It not only cleans hair but might also help with cuticles and such? I feel the envious gazes of the women again, but maybe it's because the gift is from Grandma that they don't press the matter.

Especially Lilia's gaze is intense.

I think we can talk about various things after putting Ekaterina to bed, so I hope they can be patient until then.

Now, there's only one box left...

"This is for both of you."

"For us?"

"Both of us?"

I wonder what it is? Sicily and I exchange glances before opening the box.

Inside were...

"Grandma, is this..."

"Wow..."

It wasn't extravagantly decorated, but there were rings inside the box that were of high quality.

And there were two of them.

"These are engagement rings for Shin and Sicily."

"We can't do much for you two."

Engagement rings.

In this world, there's a custom of wearing engagement rings on the ring finger of the left hand.

Sicily already wears one.

I had been thinking that I would need to prepare one eventually, but I received a present from Grandpa and Grandma.

This wasn't just an expensive gift; it felt like evidence that they were looking forward to our marriage, and I was so happy that tears were welling up.

"Grandpa, Grandma, thank you... I'm so happy."

"Grandpa, Grandma, thank you..."

Sicily also seemed deeply moved, as her eyes were welling up with tears.

"I pray for the success of your wedding ceremony..."

"Grandma... Don't say inauspicious things when we're feeling so moved."

"Hahaha, alright, I'll put this child to bed, then I'll come back, so let's redo the party."

"Yes!"

The party that had started with confusion, followed by surprise apologies and further confusion, finally returned to a normal party.

"Phew..."

"That was tiring, wasn't it?"

After Grandma returned, the adults, mainly centered around Grandpa and Grandma, continued to drink. Along the way, President Aaron poured out his grievances to them while crying, and Lilia, who finally had the chance to talk to Grandma, became nervous and stumbled over her words. There was even a drinking contest...

Wait, what kind of party is this again?

With such thoughts in mind, the feast continued.

In the end, the adults all ended up drunk, and we carried them into the available rooms. Once that was done, the party naturally came to an end. Those who didn't have relatives visiting went home, while those who had drunk family members headed to the rooms where they had been put to sleep.

Amidst all of this, Sicily and I, slightly tipsy, decided to cool off on the terrace.

"You know, it's strange, isn't it? This was supposed to be our birthday party, but why do we feel tired?"

"Haha, well, it's still nice to be ourselves."

"Yeah, I guess so."

Pushing the guests of honor aside and causing a ruckus. It was chaotic, to say the least. It was definitely reckless and just the way we are.

As we engaged in such trivial conversation, Sicily had been staring at us intently.

"What's wrong?"

"Nothing... I was just thinking about how fifteen years ago today, on my first birthday, Grandpa saved your life, and I wanted to thank him again."

"I see... But maybe, just maybe, I was born on the same day one year earlier? Well, we'll never know for sure."

I said it as a joke, but Sicily didn't take it that way.

She embraced me frontally and gently stroked my back.

"...Your father and mother must have wanted to embrace you like this."

She said that and quietly shed tears.

"Sicily..."

"The Pope probably wanted to give birth to her own child too. She had someone special, but due to a sad farewell... she might see you, Slaine-kun, who is her Master's grandson, as her own child."

"Is that so?"

"Most likely."

"Then, maybe it would have been better to call her 'Mom'?"

"That might be a bit... too much."

Sicily looked up at me with a wry smile.

"I'm a lucky person. I have loving parents, and I've been raised with love by both of them. I was reminded today of this simple happiness."

"That's right..."

Ekaterina had someone she loved but couldn't build a family with. My parents passed away without seeing my growth. Comparatively, having both parents around, spending time together and being watched over in my growth, felt like an ordinary miracle.

"We have to make sure we don't let our children experience sad things."

"Haha, that's true."

After gazing at each other for a while, we softly pressed our lips together. After parting our lips, we gazed at each other again...

"Thank you to Grandpa who saved Slaine fifteen years ago."

"And thank you to Cecil and Irene, who brought Sicily into this world sixteen years ago."

Now, we expressed gratitude to each other for the miracle of us being here.

And once again, our lips met, this time more deeply, as if yearning for each other.

"Sicily..."

"Mm... Ah... Slaine..."

And on that day, Sicily...
