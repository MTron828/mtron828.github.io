At the time when the coronation ceremony of Prince August was being held in the royal capital, in the neighboring Swede Kingdom, the soldiers were carrying out their essential patrol duties.

Originally, they had ambitions to annex the surrounding nations, so their watchful eyes were always on the empire. However, the sudden fall of the imperial capital to the demons had raised concerns, and as a result, the surveillance system had been strengthened.

In case the demons attacked, they had taken precautions such as securing evacuation routes and installing communication devices provided by the Arlside Kingdom.

"But still, how long do you think we can endure if they actually attack?"

"Yeah, it seems the Imperial Army didn't last half a day..."

"Anyway, we need to evacuate the residents..."

"Yeah..."

"Hmm..."

While the Swede Kingdom's patrol units discussed how to protect at least the civilians in such a desperate situation, a momentous event occurred.

"Hey... what's that..."

"Huh? No way..."

A patrol guard who was surveying the surroundings with a telescope from the city walls turned his gaze to something in the distance: a flare.

It was also provided by the Arlside Kingdom, and the fixed communication devices couldn't be used for mobile patrols. Even if they discovered demons or monsters, communicating on horseback would be too slow.

So, although they didn't fully understand how it worked, they were provided with a magical device that, when activated, launched a flare into the sky, illuminating it from a distance.

"The color is... red..."

It was a red that seemed to symbolize the eyes of the demons.

For a moment, the patrol guards couldn't comprehend what had just happened, but they quickly regained their composure and sprang into action.

"Confirmed the red flare! It's believed that demons are attacking! Immediately report to the royal palace! And issue an evacuation advisory to all citizens!"

"Roger!"

They had repeatedly conducted simulations in preparation for the worst-case scenario, so the instructions were quickly relayed.

"Another flare has been launched! There's no doubt about it!"

"Darn it! I can't believe something like this is actually happening!"

"I see them! A group of demons!"

A group of demons.

Throughout the long history of humanity, until last year, only individual demons had been observed. This was the first time a group of demons had appeared.

The appearance of a group of demons felt almost like a bad joke, and the soldiers of the Swede Kingdom's army couldn't fully grasp the reality of the situation.

"What's the scale? Do you know the scale?"

"The number of demons is... roughly... about a hundred."

A hundred demons, even a single one was a formidable adversary. The soldiers of the Swede Kingdom's army were prepared for the worst.

"What about the monsters? How many of them are there?"

"W-well..."

"What's wrong? Can't count them?"

Even self-deprecating remarks started to surface, but...

"It's just that... we can't see any signs of monsters! It's a group of demons only!"

"Demons only!?"

This information was inconsistent. Demons were supposed to be accompanied by monsters, but there were none?

"Well... It seems like an already hopeless situation just got worse. I want everyone to know this! Defend the city walls to the death! Even if we can't achieve that, don't let harm befall the citizens!"

"Understood!"

The Swede Kingdom's army commander issued orders, and the troops promptly lined up outside the city walls.

"Is there any chance these walls can hold? Hey, I need you to report to Arlside! Request for reinforcements, too!"

The messenger set off to deliver the message, but while running, he muttered to himself, "Even if I report immediately... how many days do you think it'll take for Arlside to reach here?"

Everyone had the same thought, but for now, they had no choice but to rely on the power of the heroes who were supposed to be demon slayers.

With a glimmer of hope, the soldiers of the Swede Kingdom sent a request for reinforcements to Arlside.

"We've also borrowed defensive magical tools from Arlside! At the very least... we'll try to delay them!"

And then... the group of demons and the Swede Kingdom's army clashed in front of the city walls of the Swede Kingdom's capital.

In the midst of the Crown Prince's ceremony, I had embarrassed myself by saying something, and even while moving with levitation magic, I couldn't bear to look at everyone's faces out of shame.

...The "Ultimate Magicians"...

I can't help but think that it's quite heartless, but I had already blurted it out. The Arlside citizens who had gathered there had already started chanting the name, so it must have already spread. ...We have to continue our activities under this team name...

What a heavy burden I've taken on!

"Hey, Shin, what have you been fidgeting about since earlier? It's creepy, you know?"

"Uh, well... I don't think it's a bad team name?"

"Don't say that with a straight face! Besides, you're a member of that team too!"

"It's not a big deal. I think it's a good name, actually."

We created an invisible barrier around us to make our voices audible to each other and used wind magic to connect our voices as we flew through the sky.

Since we often flew together after developing levitation magic, moving and conversing with the help of wind magic had become second nature to us.

Flying in the sky was much faster than traveling on the ground by carriage.

While communication could be done in an instant, transportation was a different story.

Demons had already appeared in the Swede Kingdom. We needed to get there as soon as possible, so we chose the fastest method to arrive.

If only we had set up a gate point to the Swede Kingdom, but we didn't know where the demons would appear.

"But it's a good name, in reality. I like it."

"If Lin likes it, it makes me even more uncertain..."

"Well, that's rude."

"Sigh... I guess it's already spread among everyone, so we have no choice but to accept it."

"More importantly, Lord Shin, we're approaching the border between Arlside and the Swede Kingdom."

"Huh? Already at the border?"

"We're flying, after all."

"Amazing! It would take days if we were using a carriage!"

Maria and the others were also surprised by the speed.

I've never been there, so I wouldn't know.

"Being fast is a good thing. The longer it takes to get there after receiving a report from the Swede Kingdom, the greater the damage will be."

"But... dealing with demons... even though I've become capable of defeating disaster-level demons on my own, it still makes me nervous."

"Don't worry, Maria. You're stronger than the demons, so there's no need to be concerned."

"But is that really a compliment...?"

As a girl, isn't being stronger than demons a compliment? Maria had a complicated expression on her face.

"I'll do my best too!"

"Sisily wants to examine the people who were injured by the demons."

"Oh, right. In that case, I'll do my best to help as many people as possible!"

"Yeah, please do."

Before reaching the Swede Kingdom, we decided on our roles. I, Aug, Tony, Julius, and Mark equipped ourselves with vibration swords and took the front line.

Sisily was in charge of healing the wounded.

The rest of us provided support through magic.

"Mark, don't do anything reckless."

"I know. I'm not worried because Wolford-kun and the others are here."

Oh, it's Mark! I didn't hear him say hi!

"Damn, they're all so lovey-dovey..."

I could hear Maria's voice filled with resentment.

"Mar-Maria, calm down..."

"Seriously! There are way too many lovey-dovey guys on this team! There's a surplus of girls here, you know!"

Maria seemed to be getting angry.

Indeed... it's just Thor and Julius who don't have anyone, right?

"I have a fianc√©e, you know?"

"I, too, have a betrothed."

"Looks like it's a complete wipeout!"

Wow, Maria's really mad.

"Damn... you wait, you demons... I'm going to vent all this frustration..."

Yeah! This tension release is great, and everything is going fine!

We're up against a group of demons, so it's good not to be overly tense, as it might hinder our performance.

Let Maria unleash her full power!

"Hey, I can see the capital of the Swede Kingdom."

At Aug's words, we turned our gaze forward.

Indeed, we could see a large city surrounded by walls.

Is that the capital of the Swede Kingdom?

And... in front of the city walls of the capital, magic was flying, and a magical defense barrier was visible.

"Huh? Is that barrier...?"

"Oh, that's the defense magic tool you had made for you."

"All personnel! Prepare to activate the magical tools!"

After requesting assistance from Arlside and immediately activating the magical tools provided by Arlside, the soldiers of the Swede Kingdom began preparing to activate another magical defense tool.

They only knew of conventional defense magical tools, and even though these were provided by Arlside, at this point, they didn't believe they could actually defend against the attacks of the demons.

"They're here! Activate the magical tools!"

The mages of the Swede Kingdom's army simultaneously activated the magical defense tools.

And then...

"Whoa!"

"Huh? Seriously?"

"We did it! We blocked the demons' attacks!"

"Incredible! What an incredible magical tool!"

"Now's not the time to be impressed! Blocking the demons' attacks is meaningless if we can't counterattack! Everyone, attack the demons with all your might!"

"Understood!"

"Mages, prepare your spells! Fire!"

Their morale soared as they realized they could block the demons' attacks using the magical defense tools.

Despite occasional attempts by the demons to breach their defenses and infiltrate the city walls, they managed to hold the line and keep the demons at bay.

"Hold on! If we endure, the heroes from Arlside who slay demons will come to our aid! Endure until then!"

"Yeah!"

They were eagerly awaiting Shin and his group's arrival.

When Dis-san requested a large number of defense magical tools, I thought he meant for personal use, but he distributed them to various countries.

"Even so, the quantity may not be enough; the demons' attacks are still getting through the gaps in the magic power barrier."

Indeed, some magic had landed in the capital. This was urgent!

"Everyone, at full speed! Use search magic to locate and eliminate the demons!"

"Yes!"

As we began using magic to search for the demons, someone shouted, "It's bad! Someone is being chased by a demon!"

A human with regular magical power was being pursued by a sinister demon with strong magical power.

Hurry! We can still make it in time!

We passed over the city walls at high speed. A few individuals who appeared to be soldiers of the Swede Kingdom were looking in our direction, but they couldn't afford to be distracted.

And when we reached the location we had searched...

"No, no, no!!"

"Ahaha! See, see, if you don't run away properly, you'll get hit, you know?"

"No! Stop!"

"Aha ha ha! If you don't run away quickly, you'll be killed, gevera!"

"No... huh? Gevera?"

The mother, who was carrying a child and running away, turned to look at us.

I drop-kicked the demon chasing after the mother and child, landing at the scene.

While looking in the direction of the kicked demon, I asked the mother, "Are you okay? Any injuries?"

"Oh, yes... I'm fine. Uh, who are you?"

"I'm Shin! Why are you suddenly drop-kicking from the sky? You're doing something reckless!"

"Sorry, but I had to do it."

"Oh, um..."

"Don't worry, ma'am. We've been dispatched from the Arlsheid Kingdom. Someone! Please take her to a safe place!"

Descending from the sky, Thol explained to the mother and called out to the nearby soldiers.

"Yes, ma'am, this way!"

"Thank you!"

After the soldiers and the mother and child had run off, I surveyed the area once again.

Thanks to the magical tools, the city walls hadn't been completely breached. However, just as Aug had pointed out, some demons had slipped through the gaps in the barrier and infiltrated the capital.

From this vantage point, I could see damaged buildings and the fallen bodies of numerous soldiers and civilians.

Seeing this sight, I felt a level of anger I had never experienced before.

"To the people of the Swede Kingdom and the demons! I am August von Arlsheid, the Crown Prince of the Arlsheid Kingdom!"

Aug and the others remained on top of tall buildings and didn't descend to the ground. Aug used wind magic to amplify his voice and declared the arrival of reinforcements.

"Rest assured, people of the Swede Kingdom! We have come here with the power to defeat the demons! We will cooperate with the kingdom's soldiers and surely repel the demons!"

Aug's words were meant to encourage the Swede Kingdom's citizens who were under attack by demons.

"And to the demons, prepare for despair! Among us is Shin Wolford, the grandson of the legendary hero Merlin Wolford, who defeated demons with overwhelming power! Do not think for a moment that you stand a chance!"

As Aug made this declaration, a loud cheer echoed from the center of the capital, near the royal palace. It seemed that many people had taken shelter there.

While I usually would have commented on how loud Aug's declarations were, I couldn't muster the same sense of humor this time.

"Demons, be prepared! We will eliminate every single one of you!"

I also used voice amplification like Aug, making a declaration of war against the demons.

I won't forgive those who do such things!

"Ouch! What the hell are you doing?"

The demon I had kicked earlier finally got up and yelled at me.

"What are you doing? That's my line. What the hell are you doing here?"

"Huh? I'm a demon, you know? What's wrong with messing with weaklings?"

The demon who had just stood up grinned and said that tormenting regular people was a demon's privilege.

He's just a scumbag who's reveling in the power he gained as a demon.

"Aug! What should we do with these guys?"

"Of course, it's obvious!"

I checked with Aug, who was on top of a building. Aug responded:

"Annihilate them!"

"Understood!"

Aug's declaration made our determination clear.

These guys may have been human once, but now they're demons. Moreover, they're a bunch of scoundrels who think it's perfectly fine to torment powerless ordinary people.

There's no hesitation in dealing with them!

"Hah! Do you really think you, mere humans, can stand up to me, a demon?"

"Shut up... We have a large number to exterminate, and we don't have time for idle chatter!"

Saying that, I moved towards the closest demon.

I attempted to intercept with magic, but I was too slow!

"Raaagh!"

Thol, who was behind me, unleashed a preemptive fire spell at the demon.

"Nice one, Thol!"

The demon, incapacitated by the magic, received a slash from my Vibrational Sword.

"How does it feel? How does it feel to be defeated by mere humans?"

"That's... you idiot..."

As he muttered that, the demon split into two vertically.

After looking down at the demon we had just defeated, I used detection magic to find the next one.

It seemed the others had also started fighting. The number of demons detected by the detection magic was rapidly decreasing.

"Sicily! Head towards the injured for healing! Someone, guide her to where the wounded are!"

As I shouted, a soldier who had been staring at our battle in a daze snapped back to attention.

"Yes, this way!"

"Shin, be careful!"

"Yeah, Sicily too!"

"Alright!"

Led by a soldier, Sicily headed toward the location of the wounded.

"You're in the way!"

With Sicily's voice, the Wind Blade magic exploded, and a demon was torn to pieces.

... The leading soldier was dumbfounded.

Well, no wonder. She looked so quiet, but with a single blow, and without an incantation, she took down a demon.

They seem to be alright. With this, we can proceed with peace of mind...

"I'll annihilate them!"

I went on to defeat one demon after another detected by the detection spell.

"Thol! I'm fine, so please go support the others!"

"Understood! Good luck, Lord Shin!"

"Yeah, Thol!"

Saying that, I confronted the demons alone.

The demons fired magic at me, but it was easily blocked by my magical barrier.

These guys... they're much weaker than the demonized Kurt!

"Darn it! Why!? Why doesn't it work!? We're demons, you know!?"

"Hah! You're acting all high and mighty with just this much!"

"Ugh! Dammit!"

I continued to roam through the city to exterminate demons.

Along the way, I found the corpses of soldiers and what appeared to be late-escaping civilians, and with each discovery, my anger welled up.

"We became demons to unify the world! Can we die in a place like this?"

"Don't dream above your station! You scumbags!"

I cut down the demons with my Vibrational Sword...

"These damn barriers are ridiculously tough, and what's going on!?"

"You don't need to know such things!"

"Gaaah! You... you!!"

I shot another demon with a fire bullet.

World domination? Is that the purpose of these demons, of Strom?

There's no way I can allow scum like them to do such a thing!

Right here and now, I will crush their ambitions!

"Ugoooh!"

"You fiend! You fiend!"

"Aaaaah!"

Aug and the others seemed to be doing well too.

As per the roles we had decided earlier, they used magic for a preemptive strike and finished the demons with Vibrational Swords.

Some demons were taken down with just magic.

At this rate, we'll be able to wipe them out quickly!

Just as I thought that...

"Retreat! Fall back!!"

One of the demons shouted.

Then, the demons' magical power started moving from within the city towards the outside.

Moreover, they were dispersing, making it difficult to track all of them.

"Damn it! You won't get away!"

I cast that directional explosive magic at the demons trying to escape.

I aimed at the demons who jumped into the air to clear the city walls.

"What!? You idiots..."

"Uooh..."

"D-Dammit..."

The explosive magic erupted, catching several demons in the blast.

"Ah! Damn it! A few of them got away!"

Some of the demons that had infiltrated the city walls and the ones we had held off outside had managed to escape.

We didn't achieve total annihilation.

As I grimaced at having let almost half of them slip away, the soldiers around me let out triumphant shouts.

"We did it! We repelled them!"

"Amazing! The hero who defeated demons is the real deal!"

"Thank you, Arlsheid! Thank you!"

The soldiers of the Swieden Kingdom praised me even though I regretted letting so many demons escape.

They were relieved that they had repelled the demons, and the damage was minimal.

But I...

"I'm sorry... I let the demons outside get away... and if we had arrived earlier, there could have been even fewer casualties..."

I had nothing but regret and reflection. If only I had established gates to all potential locations, without saying that we didn't know where they would appear, and if I had come faster, we could have saved more lives.

"No, no! You did plenty!"

"Actually, you were surprisingly fast, weren't you? I thought it would take several days for you to arrive. Were you on an expedition nearby?"

"No... I came from the capital of Arlsheid."

"...?"

It seemed like they found it strange that we arrived so quickly after the initial report.

"I flew here."

"Flew?"

"Oh, right! I did see something flying!"

"Huh? You can fly?"

"Yeah, well..."

The Swieden Kingdom soldiers were left dumbfounded by these remarks.

I was getting used to their reactions.

"Shin, are you okay?"

"Yeah, how about you?"

"I'm fine."

"I'm not injured."

"Strangely, I'm unharmed too."

"Maybe no one's injured, I think?"

One by one, everyone gathered.

The only one missing was Sicily, who was tending to the wounded.

Their positions were already confirmed through reconnaissance.

"Everyone's safe, it seems."

"Yes, honestly, facing demons, I thought we'd have a tougher fight..."

"They turned out weaker than expected!"

"W-Weaker..."

The Swieden Kingdom soldiers were at a loss for words at the statement from Alice, the smallest among them.

Everyone seemed to be getting used to these reactions.

"By the way, who's in charge here?"

"Ah, that would be me."

"I am August von Arlsheid. I'd like to make an announcement regarding the demon extermination. May I?"

"August-sama! Please, go ahead!"

He must be the commander of this unit. After getting permission from him, Oug activated his amplification magic once again.

"No incantation!?"

"Huh? Isn't that the prince?"

"I saw him. August-sama was really defeating demons..."

Oug had an awkward look on his face, but he continued with his words.

"Swieden Kingdom citizens! I am August von Arlsheid, the Crown Prince of the Arlsheid Kingdom! Please be at ease! We have successfully repelled the demons!"

He glanced briefly in my direction.

"We, the 'Ultimate Magicians,' have driven back the demons!"

Oh, come on!! Why did he have to make such a big announcement!?

"The Ultimate Magicians..."

"Wow..."

"That's amazing, the Ultimate Magicians!"

"Thank you, Ultimate Magicians!"

The Swieden Kingdom soldiers started enthusiastically chanting the name.

Stop it! Don't shout so loudly like that!a database schema
