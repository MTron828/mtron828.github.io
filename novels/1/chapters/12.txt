Og came to the house, along with Uncle Dis.

When Og first met Grandpa, he was deeply moved and had tears in his eyes. It's hard to believe, but Grandpa seems to be amazing after all.

Og's sister seemed to have caused a fuss about wanting to come to the house, but it seems she was left at the royal castle because she didn't come to play today. Og mentioned that her despairing expression was amusing. Surprisingly, she has a bit of a bad personality.

By the way, she's ten years old and seems to admire Grandma Merida.

If they didn't come to play, then what did they come for?

"Shall we go soon?"

It's been a few days since the entrance exam, and today is the day for the announcement of the results. Og invited me to go with her, so that's why she came to the house. Uncle Dis is the messenger. The king...

Only the two of us are going. If Grandpa or Uncle Dis went with us, it would be a panic, and the king is out of the question. So Grandpa and Uncle Dis are staying at home.

What did Uncle Dis come for?

Og wanted to take a walk in the city, so we decided to walk to the academy. It's close.

Today, Og doesn't have any bodyguards. She said she didn't need bodyguards if I'm with her. It's nice that she trusts me, but is that really okay? She's a royal.

Og, who walked freely through the city without bodyguards for the first time, seemed to be enjoying the freedom, so she wandered around, taking about thirty minutes to reach the academy, which should have taken fifteen minutes.

When we arrived at the academy, we both had skewers in our hands.

"Oh, everyone's gathered here," the prince said, chewing on skewered meat.

"Yeah, they have," the hero's grandson replied, licking his fingers covered in sauce.

Yeah, we're definitely going to get scolded.

After finishing the skewers, they tossed the skewers into a different dimension and headed to the bulletin board where the list of successful candidates was posted. They pushed their way through the crowded people and reached the front of the bulletin board. Let's see, where's my number?

"Oh, there it is."

"I found mine too."

Both of them seemed to have passed safely. After a high-five with Og, they got in line for the successful candidates' registration. Here, they received textbooks and uniforms. It seems the classes will also be announced here.

The line moved smoothly, and it was soon their turn. Og was in the next line.

"Next, please," the receptionist lady said as they presented their examination tickets and citizen IDs.

"Well, in that case, do your best to prepare a speech," she said with the best smile she had ever seen.

Really? Overwhelmed by the shocking fact that he had to give a speech as the representative of the new students at the entrance ceremony, he once again forgot to look for Maria and Sicily. He realized it after he got home.

... I forget too much, don't I?

Depressed by the fact that Shin had to give the speech as the representative of the new students, he passed by the still-queued line. In that line, Maria and Sicily were among the two.

"Oh, the top of the entrance exam didn't work?"

"It's amazing, right? Both his physical skills and magic are incredible."

Sicily was smiling while following Shin with her eyes.

"Sicily, should we talk to Shin?"

"Oh, yeah... it's fine, but I don't know what to talk about..."

"What are you saying? We have a common topic now that we've both passed the exam."

At Maria's words, Sicily seemed to realize it just now.

"I just realized..."

She said.

"Oh! It was a great opportunity, wasn't it!?"

"It was indeed."

"What am I doing..."

"What are you doing..."

Despite passing the prestigious school of the kingdom and being surrounded by cheerful people, Sicily was enveloped in a gloomy atmosphere.

"What are you really doing..."

After returning home, he was worried if he had failed, but when he told them that he had become the top student and had to give a speech as the representative of the new students, they congratulated him and said it was amazing.

"Oh, you've become the representative of the new students. You've worked hard, Shin."

"We've taught you a lot, so this is natural. But you did well."

Both of them praised him with smiles.

"As expected of you, Shin-sama."

"Of course, it's only natural for Shin-sama."

"I think I could have been the top student at the Knight Cadet Academy."

Mrs. Marika, Mr. Steve, and Mr. Alex also praised him. Although Alex had something different to say.

"I apologize for not becoming the top student, Father."

"Oh, yeah. If it's Shin-kun, it's expected. He's truly exceptional. But more importantly, you did well to pass. And in the S class, no less. I'm proud of that too."

He casually said something quite heartless.

"But Shin-kun, you don't need to be so down, especially about the speech."

"Besides the matter of the speech, it seems he's down about other things as well."

"Other matters?"

"It seems he forgot to look for acquaintances."

"Acquaintances... oh... girls?"

"It seems so."

Grinning x2

This parent and child are so annoying!

What are they saying? Well, they're not wrong, but still!

"So, what's the girl like?"

"Oh, she has long, beautiful navy-blue hair, a small face, big, slightly droopy black eyes, and she's about 155 centimeters tall. She also has a great figure and is a super beauty."

"Well... I didn't ask for that much detail..."

"Tch, you're just giving me a normal response. How boring."

Hey! Og, you're really unpleasant!

"Ah, you've had quite a few experiences since coming to the capital. That's quite something," he said with a chuckle. "Shin, make sure to bring that girl to our place. I'll give her a proper evaluation."

He must be happy that Shin is gaining some social experience since he came to the capital for social education. And Grandma is scary.

And from the next day onwards, the days of contemplating the speech began. There was absolutely no free time left!

In a certain noble's mansion.

In one room, there was a boy who had just returned from the announcement of the magic academy's acceptance.

"I'm in Class A...? Not Class S...? That's ridiculous... And on top of that, that guy who embarrassed me is the new student representative...? This can't be... This can't be... He must have cheated... The teachers at the academy must be in on it... Otherwise, I wouldn't be... I can't forgive... I can't forgive... Unforgivable..."

In the pitch-black room, mutterings filled with resentment and anger echoed.

And here we are. We've arrived. It's the entrance ceremony.

Yesterday, I was nervous... but I slept well. I decided to prepare my speech with a determined mindset. There's no use fidgeting around; I've got to go with the flow now.

Today, we're going to the academy by carriage. The reason is that today, Grandpa and Grandma are coming as guardians. Walking there would be a recipe for disaster, so a carriage arrived from the royal palace. It was a luxurious carriage that I've seen in a museum in a past life. The ride was very comfortable, but the atmosphere was uncomfortable.

Today, it's a given, but I'm wearing the uniform. For this year's first-year students, we wear a blue blazer and black slacks, and the tie's color is red. Second-year students wear a blue tie, and third-year students wear a green tie. The new students next year will have green ties. For girls, they wear black pleated skirts and ribbons instead of ties.

Actually, in the capital, there are other institutions called "Higher Education Academies": the "Knight Cadet Academy" and the "Higher Economic and Legal Academy."

The Knight Cadet Academy is self-explanatory. It's an academy that trains knights who command soldiers to protect the kingdom. Exceptionally physically fit men and women gather here, and the male-to-female ratio is about 9:1. It's where Michelle-san and Chris-nee-chan studied. The uniform design is the same but in different colors, which are red.

The Higher Economic and Legal Academy is where you study economics and law. It's a place for nurturing merchants and civil servants. It's called the kingdom's think tank, and even though they don't have combat abilities, the country wouldn't function without them. The male-to-female ratio is about half and half. Mr. Tom, the merchant, is an alumnus of this institution. The uniform design is also the same but in different colors, which are green.

Calmness in "blue."

Passion in "red."

Knowledge in "green."

That's what they say. These are the three major higher education academies in the Arlsheid Kingdom.

There are other academies for nobles and the wealthy, but they're not really relevant, so I'll skip those.

And today, Grandpa is wearing a luxurious cloak that I've never seen before. It's a mantle given by the country along with the "Order of Merit, First Class" medal. It's a magnificent cloak with white fabric, gold-threaded edges, and intricate embroidery. He's wearing it over a white military-like uniform.

Grandma is wearing the same cloak, worn over her light blue dress. She used to be a beautiful and stylish lady, so she looks amazing in it. Even though she's at the age where she's called "Grandma," there were even admirers among the servants. She's also wearing stylish blue-framed glasses that match her dress, instead of the usual silver-framed rectangular ones.

The distance to the academy is about a 15-minute walk, so with the carriage, we arrived in about 5 minutes. When we got off the carriage, well, it was actually Grandpa and Grandma, the people around us started making a fuss. Also, the rumors that their grandchild was coming to the academy seemed to have spread, and gradually, curious looks were directed at me as well.

Enduring the uncomfortable stares, the academy staff came to guide us into the ceremony venue. Phew... that was a relief, especially because Grandma was about to lose it.

"Seriously, every single one of them! I'm not some exhibit!"

She was really angry.

"I apologize. It's supposed to be Shin's big moment, and it turned into a commotion."

"That's right! What if Shin gets flustered because of this and messes up the opening speech?"

Yeah, they're in sync. Just reconcile already.

And, Grandma, there's no need to set up such a flag of failure.

With that, the two guardians went to the hall, and I, the new student, headed to the meeting place before entering.

"Hey, Shin. Are you feeling nervous?"

"Oh, Aug. No, I'm fine."

When I arrived at the meeting place, Aug spoke to me.

We've been meeting quite frequently lately, so we've become quite comfortable with each other.

"Today, there are new students, current students, and even my father, the king, along with nobles and influential figures from the country all gathered here. But you don't need to be nervous at all, okay?"

"Well, that's why..."

"Shin, the new student top-ranking, will surely give a wonderful speech. I'm looking forward to it."

This guy... He's doing it on purpose. He's deliberately trying to make me nervous!

"Aug! You!"

"Oh, what's wrong, Shin? Why are you so excited?"

He's doing it on purpose, right?! He's definitely doing it on purpose!

"Haha, what are you talking about?"

"This guy!"

"Hey! The ceremony is starting soon! What are you making a fuss about?"

"Sorry."

"Sorry."

"Geez. Come on, it's starting, so line up."

We got scolded by the teacher.

"Aug... It's your fault that I got scolded right before starting school."

"Haha, well, it worked out, didn't it?"

Come to think of it... my heart was considerably calmed from the unexpected flag of Grandma's failure.

"Aug, you..."

"Well, it's just a coincidence!"

"Aug, you!"

"That's enough! Stop it!"

"Yes, sorry."

"Yes, sorry."

Aug is still smiling. It's hard to believe considering when we first met, but this guy has quite a bad personality... or rather, it's more accurate to say he has a good personality. He teases me at every opportunity, and we often end up chasing each other around. He's my first same-age friend... or rather, like a cousin, so it seems he enjoys playing with me to no end.

I should note that both of them are normal! I've never met them, but Aug apparently has a fiancée, and he often talks sweetly about her. I wish I could get along with Sicily too...

Then, I was called from behind.

"Um, Shin, it's been a while."

It was Sicily.

"Hey, Sicily. You got in, too. And Maria."

"Don't say it like it's a casual thing!"

"Sorry, sorry. I didn't see you during the entrance exam or the acceptance announcement, so I was curious about what happened."

"I saw you, but... I didn't feel like I could approach you."

"Huh? Oh, you mean those times?"

When Karl talked to me and when they mentioned I was the new student representative...

I got a little noisy back then.

"But more importantly, if you're standing here..."

"So, we're in the 'S class' too, Mr. Top Student?"

"Yes, we're in the same class."

Sicily was smiling happily, and I couldn't help but be captivated...

"Shin. Is this the young lady you were talking about?"

Whoa! Why did you have to say that?

"Oh, I remember you. You are..."

"Nice to see you again, Prince August. I'm Maria, the second daughter of the Messina Earldom."

"Nice to see you again, Prince August. I'm Sicily, the third daughter of the Claude Viscount family."

Earl and Viscount!? They're nobility!

"Huh? Sicily, I can understand, but Maria is also a noble?"

"Wait a minute! Isn't that unfair!?"

"Hehehe."

Sicily found it amusing.

"So, why didn't you tell me?"

"Because when you tell people you're a noble's daughter, many of them suddenly change their attitude."

"Yes, that's right. They become more formal... or you can feel the distance."

"Hmm, is that so?"

"You're just special. Both of them... authority and common sense don't work on this guy, so you can interact with him casually."

"Huh? Your Highness, what does that mean?"

"Look! Stop it already! Let's go!"

When Maria was about to ask something, the teacher's voice interrupted her.

And with applause from the current students, teachers, parents, and dignitaries, we entered the venue.

On the stage, dignitaries, representatives of the current students, and the school principal gave speeches, but I couldn't hear a thing.

I'm fully occupied with my own thoughts.

And... finally, the moment arrived.

"Now, next is the speech by the new student representative. The top-ranking first-year student in this year's entrance exam, Shin=Wolford."

"Yes!"

"Huh...?"

"Wolford?"

"That's right. Shin=Wolford. The grandson of that hero."

"!!!"

It seems like Aug is explaining something to Sicily and Maria. Huh? Didn't I mention it?

But more importantly, it's time for the representative speech. I went up to the platform nervously.

The audience is unusually restless. Please, be quiet.

"Ladies and gentlemen, I am honored to introduce the new student representative, Shin=Wolford. On this auspicious day, I am delighted to have been welcomed by parents, dignitaries, teachers, and current students and to enroll in the Ars High School of Advanced Magic."

Phew, are these standard lines okay?

"I have been learning various things from my grandparents and acquaintances since I was a child. However, because my grandfather had retired and we lived deep in the forest, I grew up without knowing the world. At that time, someone said to me, 'Go to the academy and learn common sense.'"

"My environment changed dramatically after coming to the royal capital. I have already made some friends. I believe that there will be even more encounters when I enroll in the academy. I am looking forward to it. You might wonder about studying, but for me, meeting people is important and essential. So, you might think that I should study as well. Of course, I don't plan to neglect my studies. I hope to build relationships where I can learn from the people I meet."

"So please, everyone, don't exclude me just because I'm ignorant of the world. If that happens, I might cry."

"Parents, dignitaries, please always watch over us warmly, and sometimes with strictness. Teachers, current students, I might be a cheeky student and a junior, but please don't bully me. In three years, we will work hard to grow bigger and take flight, so we appreciate your guidance and encouragement. New student representative, Shin=Wolford."

And then I bowed.

This was followed by a loud round of applause.

Phew, I'm relieved now that this weight is off my shoulders. As I returned to my seat, Aug was trying to suppress his laughter.

"Hahaha, Ahaha, Hahahahaha!"

He couldn't quite suppress his laughter.

"What's so funny?"

"Phew, because you, for your representative speech, it's unheard of to include jokes. Didn't you listen to the speeches of the others?"

"Huh!? Is that so?"

"Yes... that's correct. We haven't heard it very often..."

"More like, I've never heard it before."

Maria is also laughing.

Seriously? Oh, the students are laughing, but the parents, guests, and teachers are forcing smiles.

Did I mess up?
