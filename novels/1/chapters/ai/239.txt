 a fun fact
about the Roman Empire

"Please proceed in pairs. If any trouble arises, please contact the office immediately. We will involve the palace in handling the situation as well. By the way, these wireless communication devices and fixed communication devices are really convenient, aren't they? With these, our previous tasks could have been even smoother."

Catalina mumbled this while holding her personally assigned wireless communication device.

Well, once you experience their convenience, you can't let go of them.

As evidence, others are nodding in agreement.

"This transfer device is amazing too. What is it? Documents are sent as they are. It's almost like cheating," said Cartas, referring to the transfer device that had been continuously producing requests.

This is a magical tool imbued with gate magic.

It allows the transfer of documents between paired magical tools. It's not like a fax machine, so you can't communicate with multiple devices at once. Nonetheless, it achieves incredible efficiency when considering the back and forth between the palace and this office.

"I apologize; we've gotten off track. Now, every morning, you'll receive pre-checked requests here and proceed to handle them. In principle, once you finish one request, you'll return to the office before taking the next one. However, in cases where the location is nearby, you might continue directly. Thank you."

The excitement from when they first met seems to have disappeared, and Catalina efficiently handles the work-related announcements.

She's truly an efficient secretary.

"Lady Sicily, you will primarily be stationed at the healing institute in the capital. If there are requests from other cities or countries, you might be asked to visit those locations, so please be prepared."

"Yes, understood."

"Additionally, as a rule, Natasha will accompany Lady Sicily as her support."

"Support?"

Unlike the others, Sicily doesn't go out to fulfill requests; she works as a healing mage at the healing institute.

Despite her healing mage skills improving, she still falls short of Sicily. She'll have to deal with patients who are too much for other healing mages to handle.

In a way, it's a tougher job than anyone else's.

And Natasha will be supporting Sicily in this regard.

"Yes, the healing institute is an affiliated facility of the church. I don't anticipate any issues with the healing institute in the capital of Arsheid. However, Lady Sicily is not a priestess of the Creator God's religion. There may be individuals who frown upon someone who is not a priestess practicing healing in the institute."

Catalina's words reminded me of Lord Ralph in Darms. He was a devout follower of the Creator God's religion. However, his extreme devotion led to him not accepting me and Sicily and even causing trouble.

It seems they are being cautious due to such incidents.

"Natasha is currently holding the position of a bishop in the Creator God's religion. With her presence, unnecessary trouble can be avoided."

"Oh, really? Natasha, you're amazing!"

A bishop is above a priest, right? Natasha, who looks like she's not much older than us, has already reached such a position? That's impressive.

Natasha, who received compliments from Sicily, blushed and looked down.

"No, compared to the Holy Lady, I am nothing but a speck of dust..."

She's filled with so much reverence...

Thinking that, she suddenly lifted her head with a determined expression.

There was a strong resolve in her face.

It seems that her previous blush was due to Sicily's praise.

"With me around, I'll quickly eliminate any stubborn fools! I'll protect the Holy Lady from any impertinent individuals at all costs, even if it means staking my life!"

"You don't have to go that far!"

In response to Natasha's intense devotion, Sicily hurriedly tried to stop her.

While Sicily is often assumed to be a healing-focused "Holy Lady," she possesses enough power to single-handedly defeat demons. Even regular soldiers serving the country would likely have no chance against her.

"I acknowledge Lady Sicily's abilities, but foolish people exist everywhere. That's why I request that when you go on missions, you always go with Natasha."

"Yes, that makes sense. Understood."

"Natasha, please take care of Sicily."

When I said that to Natasha, she welled up with tears.

"Yes! I will protect the Holy Lady with all my heart to meet your expectations, even if I have to sacrifice my life!"

"You don't need to risk your life!"

I hope she'll protect Sicily to the best of her abilities, but she can always run away if her life is in danger!

While I was having that exchange with Natasha, Sicily and Maria were engaged in a conversation.

"Huh? Sicily, did you change your necklace?"

"Oh, yeah. Hehe, does it look good?"

"Yeah, it's nice. It's cute too."

As Sicily and Maria had such a conversation, I tried to appease Natasha and began to review the requests assigned to me.

Let's see, which one... Huh?

Wait, this one... What? This one too?

"Um, Catalina, can I ask about my requests?"

"Yes, what's the matter?"

"Well, it's just that... there are a lot of requests from really distant places, aren't there?"

Indeed, all the requests assigned to me were from places far away from the capital, some even from other countries.

"Oh, there's a good reason for that," Cartas, who assigned these requests, responded to my question. "Shin, you can use levitation magic, right? But the others can't."

"That's true."

"So, we decided to have Shin, who can use levitation magic, handle the distant requests. It's the most efficient way."

"I see..."

Certainly, when we're together, I use levitation magic to make everyone fly, but I can't fly alone.

So, it makes sense for these requests to be assigned to me.

"So, who's my partner?"

"You won't have one."

...Huh?

Wait, did I mishear that? I thought I heard you say I won't have a partner...

"No, I didn't mishear, right? I heard you say I won't have a partner..."

"You didn't mishear. Shin, you'll be handling the requests alone."

"Oh, really?"

"Yes. Sicily will be exclusively at the healing institute. We have one person short, and it makes sense to have Shin, the most capable individual who can handle any situation, act alone."

"I see..."

If that's the case, I can't help it.

If I'm alone, I won't have to worry about a partner, and in a way, it might be more relaxing.

"Releasing Shin into the wild alone..."

"Your Highness, I understand your concerns, but let's trust Shin here."

Glance.

"That's right. Shin is a responsible adult, so he won't act recklessly."

Glance.

...

Stop looking around so much!

"Now then, Your Highness and Tony, Thor and Julius, Maria and Yuri, Mark and Olivia, please form your pairs," Catalina specified the pairings.

So it's already decided.

"I'll be with Yuri."

"Yes, previously, we had the honor of your presence when you saved us, Your Highness. However, you are a married man, and having two women on a mission together might lead to unnecessary rumors, so I made that judgment."

"That's true. Yuri, let's do our best."

"I feel the same way."

"Now, the Ultimate Magicians are ready to begin!"

"Yes!"

Lastly, Vice Captain Aug closed the statement, and the Ultimate Magicians were finally in action.

... Wait, I'm the leader, right? with concepts
