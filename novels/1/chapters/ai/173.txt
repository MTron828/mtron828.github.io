In this way, we chatted about silly things and engaged in small talk with the members of the delegation throughout the journey.

The reason for this is that in this world, there are very few flying creatures.

Monsters can also refer to animals that have absorbed too much magical energy, causing them to become uncontrollable and undergo transformations.

Magical energy is naturally present in the atmosphere of this world, but it tends to accumulate in deserted or stagnant air places.

Spending too much time in such places can lead to an excessive absorption of magical energy.

Therefore, monsters are often found in remote areas like the depths of forests, where people rarely venture.

Considering this, birds and other flying creatures that roam the sky rarely stay in one place for long.

So, there aren't many flying monsters in this world, and there are no dragons either.

As a result, even though the flying ship is soaring through the sky, we don't encounter any monsters, making the flight very smooth.

On the other hand, there isn't much to do except engage in small talk.

Some people are so bored that they even fall asleep.

After flying through the desert for a while, there is still no end in sight.

We left Els in the morning, but it seems like the sun is about to set.

"I'm sorry. Nighttime flights can be dangerous, so we'd like to land somewhere..."

As the sun seemed to be setting on the horizon, one of the pilots said this.

While our course is based on the compass, flying in total darkness may pose a risk.

There was a suggestion to land somewhere and set up camp.

There was no opposition to this idea, and the flying ship landed right in the middle of the desert.

"Ugh! Phew... It's been a while since I've stepped on solid ground."

It's been about eight hours, right? I've been on the vehicle the whole time, and the feeling of solid ground is incredibly reassuring.

I should be used to flying, but this sensation is unavoidable.

"Oh, oh? I feel a bit wobbly."

"It's quite a strange sensation."

Naval-san and the members of the delegation, including him, seem to be puzzled by this new sensation.

"We'll be setting up tents now, so please wait a moment."

While everyone is feeling a bit wobbly, the escorts provided by Els began preparing for camping.

Among the escorts, there was a mage with the ability to use spatial storage magic, and they began to retrieve camping tents one after another.

They efficiently set up the tents.

We generally don't go camping, and in situations like the campaign to conquer the demon realm, we are completely useless in this regard.

After all, we can just use a gate to return home.

So, we, the "useless" ones, simply watched as the professional escorts arranged everything.

However, at that moment, Sicily exclaimed, "I left Silver with Granny!"

"Come to think of it, that's true. I'll head home for a moment."

"Yes."

"Oug, sorry, but I'll go back home for a bit to check on Silver."

"Understood. What about dinner?"

"There's still a need to build camaraderie, so I'll eat here."

"Got it."

After that conversation, I opened a gate to my home.

Come to think of it, it's the first time I've opened a gate in front of Ms. Shaolin.

She and Leafan, with mouths agape, stared at the gate that had suddenly appeared.

The Els delegation didn't seem too surprised.

Had they seen Oug's gate before?

Leaving that aside, both Sicily and I were curious about Silver's well-being, so we immediately went through the gate...

"Wow wow! Wah wah!"

As soon as we arrived, we heard Silver's intense crying.

"Hey there, Silver, please stop crying."

"Oh, what should we do?"

Grandma and Grandpa were desperately trying to comfort Silver, but there was no sign of the crying abating.

We thought he had become more attached to them than us, so what's going on?

"Wait, Grandma, what happened!?"

"Did something happen!?"

"Oh! You came at the perfect time! Look, Silver, it's Mom and Dad!"

"Huh?"

I called out to Grandma, and she, who had been uncharacteristically flustered, spoke to Silver with a visibly relieved expression.

Then, Silver, who had been crying just a moment ago, looked at us.

And then...

"Wow wow!" He reached out his hands towards us.

Sicily, summoned by Silver, hurriedly went to his side.

"Yes, it's Mom. What's wrong?" She received Silver from Grandma, and Silver clung tightly to Sicily.

"Ugh..."

"What's the matter, Silver?"

"Mmm."

Finally, Silver stopped crying, but he buried his face in Sicily's chest, growling.

"Grandma, what happened?"

"Ugh... It's just a mess..."

I inquired, but Grandma muttered with a level of exhaustion I'd never seen before.

With Grandma looking so tired, Grandpa answered in her place.

"Well, usually, you two are home at this time. But since you haven't come back, Silver was feeling lonely."

"No matter how much we try to comfort him, he won't stop crying. It's really been a challenge."

"Oh, I see."

So, was Silver sulking?

"Hey, Silver."

For now, I tried to gauge Silver's mood and called out to him while he was being held by Sicily.

He looked at my face for a moment, then...

"Pui."

He turned his face back into Sicily's chest.

"Hey now. What's got you sulking?"

"Mm!"

When Sicily forcibly lifted Silver from her arms, he made a pouty face like I'd never seen before.

His behavior was so amusing that I couldn't help but chuckle.

Perhaps he didn't like that, as he started tapping my chest with his little hand.

"Oh, what's wrong? Silver, that hurts."

"Mm!"

"Come on, you shouldn't hit Papa like that."

"Ugh!"

Despite Sicily's attempts to comfort him, Silver's mood didn't improve.

As we pondered what to do, Grandma made a suggestion.

"Could you two do us a favor and take Silver with you?"

"Huh?"

"It's not like you're going into battle this time. Is it really a problem to bring a child along?"

"Well, in that sense, it's not a problem, but... we're part of the official delegation of a country, you know? Taking a child with us might be a bit..."

"When you participate in meetings or whatever, you can bring him back here. He might not even eat anything this way..."

"..."

Upon Grandma's words, Sicily and I exchanged glances.

"...What should we do?"

"How... can we even..."

After all, this is like an international conference, right? Taking your crying child with you...

"For now, should we at least ask?"

"Yeah, let's do that."

"Please."

It was truly unusual to hear such a meek voice from Grandma.

In fact, it was the first time I'd ever heard it.

It's amazing that Silver could make Grandma sound like that...

So, we returned to everyone by going through the gate that had been left open.

"Ah... We're back."

"Hm? You've returned... Silver?"

"Yes!"

When I called out, Oug, who noticed first, greeted us, but when he saw me holding Silver, he made a puzzled sound.

Thinking that Silver responded well to a familiar figure, he cheerfully replied.

"Um... When we returned, Silver was crying a lot, and it seems like the reason is that... we weren't here."

"...So you brought him here."

"Well, Grandma was exhausted, and she asked you to take care of him there..."

"She made Her Highness Merida come visit!? That's pretty impressive..."

"This is a diplomatic mission for establishing relations and trade, after all. It was absolutely not allowed to bring a child, but she said to at least hear you out..."

"Hmm... Normally, the participation of children would not be allowed... But it's at the request of Her Highness Merida..."

Oug, who usually made calm judgments, was troubled.

Is Grandma that scary?

"First, let's go ask the Els delegation."

Oug said that and walked toward the Els delegation, who were relaxing until dinner was ready.

Naturally, we, who were in the position to request this, followed him.

Then, we spoke to Navar, who was the leader of the delegation.

"Navar Diplomat, do you have a moment?"

"Hm? What's going on, Your Highness? Oh? The Demon Lord and the Holy Woman are here too."

"No, actually... "

"Oh, is that the child they call the 'Child of Miracles'?"

It seemed that Silver was famous even in Els.

Upon Navar's words, other members of the delegation gathered as well.

"Oh, what an adorable child."

"Definitely. This child will be a heartbreaker in the future."

"So, what's the talk about?"

"Well, you see..."

As the people from Els praised Silver one after another, Oug began to explain the situation.

I thought they would likely refuse, but the response that came was unexpected.

"This is a request from the Archmage!? We absolutely must accept such a request!"

"Huh?"

An immediate acceptance? Why?

"The Archmage is one of the heroes, of course. Moreover, he's our president's master. Can we disregard such a person's request?"

I see. But Grandma's influence is really something.

Well, it's probably natural from the perspective of the people of Els. After all, she's the one who introduced magic tools for daily life to the public and is revered as a hero in the world of commerce.

That's what I thought, but...

"...The president has also informed me about it... We absolutely cannot go against the Archmage..."

They're not revering her; they're fearing her...n email
