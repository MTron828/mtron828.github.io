While waiting for Aug, it seemed that the preparations were also complete, and the Min family's farewell party began.

Tomorrow, they're flying back together on a flying boat, so they brought Silver along as well.

There's a table full of exotic dishes, and they are eagerly interested in them.

"Here, Silver, say 'ah.'"

"Ah."

I used chopsticks to feed Silver something like fried chicken.

Fried chicken is a classic favorite among children.

As expected, Silver's eyes shine with delight at its deliciousness.

"By the way, Shin, you're quite skilled with these chopsticks."

"Oh, in my previous life, chopsticks were mainstream in my country."

"I see. There are some cultural similarities, I suppose, since we're all human."

"Papa, say 'ah.'"

As I chatted with Sicily, Silver couldn't wait any longer and started urging for more food.

"Oh, sorry. So, which one do you want?"

"Ka-ge."

"Ka-ge?"

"Isn't it fried chicken?"

"Oh!"

With Sicily's interpretation, I finally figured out what Silver wanted, so I fed him more fried chicken.

Chewing sounds

"Oh, don't eat so quickly. Look, it's spilling out of your mouth."

"Oh, sorry."

The fried chicken's oil had overflowed, and Sicily was using a nearby napkin to wipe Silver's sticky mouth.

Chuckles

"Hey, don't squirm."

Groaning

"Oh, come on."

Silver was being held by Sicily, who was attempting to wipe his mouth.

He was desperately trying to escape from Sicily's arms as she tried to wipe his mouth.

Sicily, on the other hand, was holding onto him tightly to prevent him from getting away.

Watching this mother and child's back-and-forth was heartwarming.

"Shin, please help catch him with a smile!"

"Oops, sure."

"Ouch!"

Perhaps having resigned himself to being caught by a papa stronger than mama, Silver became obedient.

"He's really mischievous."

Sicily said that while wiping Silver's mouth.

"Mm, ouch."

"There you go, all clean."

After Sicily finished wiping Silver's mouth, she held him again.

"And... wow. You're really doing the whole mom thing, aren't you?"

Olivia, who had somehow ended up near us, commented on Sicily's actions as if impressed.

Sicily returned a smile to Olivia.

"I've been Silver's mom for almost two years now. I've gotten used to it."

"As expected of you, Sicily-san. Will I be able to do it...?"

"Taking care of a baby is something you can learn from your parents or others quickly. But I'm more worried about what comes next."

"What comes next?"

Olivia tilted her head in confusion, and Sicily's smile turned serious.

"The terrible twos and the rebellious phase."

"Oh..."

Yes, Silver is almost two years old now.

At two years old, it's about time for that to start.

The phase where they say "no" and resist everything, known as the terrible twos. And then it evolves into a more advanced stage, the rebellious phase.

Both Sicily and I have been warned by our grandmothers to be prepared for what's to come after the age of two.

"In reality, I've never dealt with a child that age, so I don't know what it's like. But, that old lady says, 'I really struggled' about it."

"Me... Merida-sama said that!?"

Olivia seemed to hold her grandmother in high regard as well.

And that grandmother had apparently had her hands full with it.

What kind of dreadful situation is waiting for us...?

"Um, Mr. Wolford, you have memories of your previous life, right? Were you married in your previous life?"

This seemed like a casual question about a past life unrelated to the current situation.

But upon hearing those words, Sicily's face suddenly looked like she was about to cry.

"Shin, were you... married?"

W-Wait a minute! Why is she about to cry!?

"I wasn't! When I died in my previous life, I didn't have a girlfriend either!"

When I said that, both Sicily and Olivia looked surprised.

"No, it's not like that..."

"I-I'm sorry!"

Sicily's tearful expression suddenly turned into a perplexed one, and Olivia bowed her head.

"What's wrong, Olivia? Huh? Did I do something wrong?"

I don't remember having to apologize to Olivia.

Why is she bowing her head so deeply?

And why is Sicily about to cry?

And then, why is she not crying now?

Why do women have to be so complicated?

And why are they making such a big deal about something I don't even remember?

"Why isn't Sicily stopping this?"

I was wondering, and then Olivia muttered something under her breath.

"That's right... Having memories of your previous life means you have memories of when you died..."

Huh? Oh...

Was Olivia implying that she thought I had remembered what happened when I died because I had memories of my previous life?

Well, with the fact that I have memories from my previous life, which means I died and was reincarnated, it's natural to be concerned.

"I'm sorry for apologizing, even though you don't remember."

"Yes."

"I don't remember what happened after I left the company... So, I have no idea what happened afterward."

"Is that so?"

"Yes. So, I suddenly felt like I was in this world without realizing it, so you don't have to worry too much about it."

"But..."

"Apologizing for something I don't remember is inconvenient for me."

"I see..."

"Alright, Olivia."

Finally, Olivia accepted this and lifted her head.

I wish they would stop bowing their heads like this at a festive gathering.

And besides, it's something I don't even remember.

"But, Shin-kun, this is your first time raising a child, right? That's great."

Is she jealous of my previous life too?

Well, if she knows I have memories, it's natural for her to be curious.

"I didn't have any children in my previous life, and I didn't have any relatives with children, so it's really my first time."

"In that case, we'll get through it together."

"Yes!"

"Yeah!"

As Sicily and I held hands, Silver placed his hand there as well.

"Hey, you're saying you'll do your best with Mama?"

Chuckles Huh?

When I scolded Silver like that, Sicily couldn't help but laugh, and Silver looked puzzled.

"Ah, he's not really concerned about it."

"I told you, I don't remember. How can I be concerned about something like that?"

"I see..."

Olivia finally smiled and approached to pat Silver's head.

"Ouch."

"Hehe, he's cute. I still want to meet my own child soon."

"To achieve that, Mark will have to work hard, won't you?"

Saying this, I turned around.

There, Mark, with a red face, was standing.

"No... I'd rather you didn't say that here."

"It's fine. It's just us as a couple here, after all."

As I said that, both Mark and Olivia blushed and responded.

"We're not a couple yet!"

It's fine, just accept that you're a couple already. It's getting annoying.

"Enjoying yourselves? Welcome."

The one who approached us with these words was Swiran, the organizer of this farewell party. Despite her broken language, she clearly spoke in our country's language.

"Yes, we're enjoying it. Thank you."

With each word clearly separated, I replied, and Swiran smiled, as if she understood the meaning.

"I'll be opening a foreign language school from now on. I want to learn as much as I can myself."

Certainly, Leafan was interpreting this. But, I see. While the people of Kuang Long are trying to learn our language, we should also learn their language.

"We also plan to open a language school in Earlsheid in the future. We've already discussed it with His Highness, so please come and study with us when the time comes."

It seems they've already discussed it that far. This person is really capable. I can understand why Shaoran wanted her help so badly. The development of the trading company would be completely different with or without Swiran. And I understood that Shaoran could come to Earlsheid without any worries because Swiran was here. After that, we thanked the Min family's servants and spent some time, and by the end of the farewell party, Silver had already fallen asleep in Sicily's arms.

"Silver has fallen asleep, so should we wrap things up soon?"

"Yes, that's a good idea, big sister."

Shaoran, choosing to call Swiran in our language, said, "Let's end it soon."

When Shaoran said this, Swiran nodded.

"Thank you, everyone. Truly, thank you."

Swiran said that and deeply bowed to us.

At that moment, Aug stepped forward and spoke to Swiran.

"I want to express my gratitude; you have taken care of us."

He said this in the Kuang Long language.

"When did you...?" I asked, but Aug just smirked and didn't answer.

He really doesn't show when he's making an effort. Seriously, he's amazing.

Among the Min family members who received thanks from a foreign crown prince in their own language, some were moved to tears.

Truly amazing.

"Then, Lord Shaoran, I'll be counting on you from now on."

"Yes! I'm looking forward to working with you as well."

And so, our stay in Kuang Long came to a close...

"By the way, what will we do with the passed-out Lord Naval and his group?"

...

We were trying to wrap things up nicely, and now these drunken old men!

For the time being, the drunken men were carried to their respective rooms.orm edge cases
