The old imperial capital.

Now a stronghold of demons, it was called the "Demon Capital" by humans, a city teeming with monsters and demons. At its center is Strom, the leader of the demons.

Strom, who created all the demons and monsters in the Demon Capital and its surroundings, appeared to be in very high spirits. Why? Because...

"It's finally tomorrow. The showdown with young Wolforde."

The recent conflict between Strom's faction of demons and the humans around the Demon Capital. During that time, Strom proposed a showdown between the demons and humans, and the deadline for that was approaching tomorrow.

If the demons win, they will march into the human world and destroy all of humanity. If the humans win, peace will return to the world. Strom himself proposed these conditions and forcefully obtained their agreement.

In terms of the conditions, it slightly favors the humans. This is because even if the humans lose here, it doesn't mean they'll be wiped out at that point, though their chances of winning are extremely low.

However, for the demons, losing here means the destruction of the demon race. Humans can't afford to leave demons, who have become an extraordinary threat, alone. Despite the individual differences in combat strength, the number of humans is overwhelmingly greater.

Even though he proposed such a slightly disadvantageous battle, Strom seemed somewhat cheerful. Among his subordinate demons, there were some who couldn't understand why he would be in such a good mood despite proposing conditions that were slightly unfavorable for them. But Strom was their leader. Until he made a decision, they didn't question it.

Zest, Strom's most trusted lieutenant, was the same. His guiding principle was everything for Strom's sake. He had worked in various ways to benefit Strom.

Zest, however, had something on his mind. It wasn't about tomorrow's operation.

"Strom-sama, may I ask a question?"

"What is it, Zest? Some fun strategy for tomorrow's battle?"

"No... we leave all that to Strom-sama. We will follow your will in everything. It's just that..."

"Yes? What is it?"

"Well... this..."

"Hmm?"

"What are your intentions, Lady Millia?"

Millia.

A woman who had been following Strom since before he seriously began attacking the empire. She had devoted herself to taking care of Strom after he was severely injured during his first encounter with Shin. After Strom transformed into a demon with his own hands, she had dedicated her all to help him destroy the empire as a loyal subject.

Millia had carried out an experiment risking the existence of the demons and... it failed. Since then, Millia never appeared in front of everyone. She had special feelings for Strom and felt responsible for the experiment's failure, leading to her withdrawal.

Zest, who had been a comrade of Millia, serving Strom from the very beginning, inquired about how Millia would be treated. Strom's response was concise.

"She can do as she pleases, right?"

"Eh?"

"Whether she participates in the battle or not is Millia's choice. I won't force her."

"I see."

Depending on how one listened, it might sound like Strom was showing concern for Millia, who was feeling down after the failed experiment. But Zest accurately read Strom's true feelings.

(As I thought... Strom-sama doesn't have any feelings for Lady Millia.)

He fully understood that Strom, who had become a demon himself through his own choice, lacked human emotions.

There was no point in feeling bad about how he treated his subordinates. So Zest didn't hold any suspicion towards Strom.

(Poor thing...)

He only felt sympathy for Millia.

"Hehehe, now, young Wolforde, what kind of magic will you use to surprise me next time?"

Strom, who said this playfully, seemed like a child looking forward to an enjoyable event. At the same time, he also appeared like a recluse who had given up on everything.

Earlshide Royal Castle.

As the showdown with the demons approached, Deceum was having a conversation with his son, August, in anticipation of the battle tomorrow.

"Tomorrow is finally here... How are the preparations going, August?"

"I've done everything I can. The rest depends on the strategies the members of the Ultimate Magicians come up with. But I'm not particularly worried."

Seeing August assert this, Deceum couldn't help but smile.

"You've certainly changed the most, August, especially after meeting Shin."

"Is that so?"

"It certainly is. Originally, the idea was for Shin to learn common sense by attending the Advanced Magic Academy, but it had an unexpected synergistic effect."

Deceum chuckled while speaking in a lighthearted manner, but August, the one being addressed, displayed a slightly embarrassed or troubled expression.

He understood that his way of interacting with others had changed before and after meeting Shin. However, when his own parent pointed it out, it was quite embarrassing. He was aware of it, but hearing it aloud made him feel self-conscious, resulting in a subtle expression.

In an attempt to change the topic, August found the perfect person to discuss.

"It seems Shin is thinking about some sort of trump card."

Upon hearing these words from August, Deceum's warm smile froze.

A trump card.

Even now, when things were already abnormal.

Shin, a trump card.

Deceum, who had recovered from the paralysis, drank tea on the table to calm down. His hands were trembling, making a clattering sound. After taking a sip of tea, Deceum asked August.

"S-So, Shin is considering a trump card?"

"Yes. According to Claude's account..."

August paused his words there.

Deceum held his breath.

And then...

"He felt like an entire country might disappear."

In that moment, all sounds around Deceum vanished. After a brief period of paralysis, Deceum asked once more.

"Huh? Did I mishear that? I heard 'country' instead of 'city.'"

"No, you didn't mishear, Father. He said 'country.'"

Upon August's words, Deceum placed a hand on his forehead and let out a deep sigh.

"Really... We're fortunate that Shin doesn't have any ambitions."

Deceum spoke with a sense of relief, and August responded.

"Well, with Shin, everything should be fine in the future."

In the future.

In other words, August was confident that human history would continue beyond this point.

Hearing these words, Deceum now drank his tea with a smile.

"That's right. In the future..."

"Yes. In the future, indeed."

The royal father and son of Arlside had already turned their gaze toward the world after the decisive battle.
