"Huh, chanting has such an effect!?"

"I didn't know."

These were Alice and Lynn's reactions when I told the same story to the S-class students the day after explaining chanting and magic to Oug, Sisily, and, for some reason, Ellie. Only Oug and Sisily had heard the explanation in the class, so I thought it was a useful piece of information to share with everyone. By the way, it was Oug's idea to share this information. This fact that chanting can allow advanced magic with less magic power is somewhat limited in its application and not highly utilized in combat, so it was made public to the general population.

In fact, we brought this story to the Arsheid Academy of Magic after that, and the researchers there had quite interesting reactions on their faces. They went from surprise to bewilderment, and then they got really excited. So, the team shared it before the official announcement from the magical academy.

"Magic responds to the heart... It's been said for ages that the most important thing in magic is the imagination, yet we didn't realize it..."

Thor appeared a little frustrated by the content he seemed to have almost realized.

"By the way, what's going on in Shin's head?"

"That's right. His offensive magic is beyond any standard..."

"And the magic tools are incomprehensible."

"We also solved the mystery of the world's enigmatic magic stones."

When Tony said these words in disbelief, Julius, Yuri, and Mark agreed.

Everyone had a similar look of disbelief.

What is it?

In this situation, where I couldn't tell if they were praising me or criticizing me, Oug, who had heard the explanation yesterday, asked a different question.

"First of all, this story is something so obvious that no one even thought about it as a question until now. Shin, when did you start to wonder about it?"

When did I start to wonder?

If I say it started from the beginning, I might get some strange looks again.

Maybe I should evade the question a bit.

"Well... I guess it was when my grandpa taught me magic?"

"What, what! You said you first used magic when you were three years old, didn't you?"

Oops.

I initially assumed that I started wondering about this around the age of one when my memories from my past life resurfaced, but I actually used magic for the first time when I was three!

Now, I had to divert the conversation.

"Uh, yeah... It was really strange. I used to wonder why fire would come out without any firewood or why water would flow without a well..."

"...We can't comprehend the genius's thinking. I don't remember much from when I was three years old, and I've never had any doubts about magic or magic tools."

"If I were three years old, I wouldn't even have memories. My earliest memory is when I was about four years old. I remember a lot from my debut when I was five..."

Oh? Are they somehow misunderstanding this on their own?

Oug and Maria, although looking a bit bewildered, seemed to come to terms with it in their own way.

"For Shin, this world seems to be filled with mysteries. I've never even thought about such things."

"That's right. I've started to think that the ability to feel this doubt might be the essence of Wolfort-kun's greatness."

Recently, Sisily and Olivia, who had been getting along unusually well, seemed genuinely impressed.

As I was comforted by Sisily and Olivia, after the initial amazement, Alice, who had shown signs of deep thought, asked a question.

"Hey, Shin-kun! If magic responds to your own heart, that means it'll do what you want, right!?"

"Well, if you put it that way, I guess so?"

"I see! I got it!"

Alice, who looked like she had understood something, showed signs of thinking again and began gathering magic power.

Hey! This is a classroom! Are you sure you're gathering quite a lot of magic power!?

The next moment, I thought that when Alice started chanting, "I seek it! To fill my heart and stomach, create a delicious and sweet cake!" the amount of magic power she was gathering was quite substantial.

Hey!

"Sweets!!"

With Alice's determined words, the magic power dispersed.

Actually, it began dispersing from the moment she started chanting, right?

The magic power completely dissipated, and a heavy silence filled the surroundings.

Were they dumbfounded, or were they struggling to hold back laughter?

No one uttered a word.

In the midst of this, Alice, who turned bright red, glared at me.

Was it out of embarrassment, or was it some kind of backlash?

"Shin, you liar!! I wanted cake so much, and it's not coming out!!"

"Are you stupid!? There's no way something like that would come out!!"

I thought it was just frustration, but it turned out to be genuine rage.

Responding to your own heart doesn't mean that!

"Alice..."

"What, Lin?"

"...Idiot."

"Grr!"

A chase between Lin and Alice began.

Alice's actions were undeniably foolish, but they unintentionally confirmed one thing: creating physical objects with magic was impossible. Or, more precisely, "complex objects couldn't be easily materialized," to be more accurate.

Magic power was likely a highly psychoreactive substance pervading this world. This substance reacted to our hearts and changed its "quality" according to the results of our imagination.

What's worth noting here is that it only changed the "quality." Physical objects were composed of various elements, so altering only the quality wasn't enough to materialize them. The "magic stones" were probably crystallized objects with their quality remaining unchanged.

They were called "magic stones" due to their appearance, resembling transparent stones, but "magic energy crystals" would be a more natural name for them.

While I had this hypothesis, I hadn't conducted any experiments besides the creation of magic stones.

After all, no matter how much experimentation was involved, creating a cake with magic, for example, required a fair amount of courage due to its seemingly ridiculous nature.

But thanks to Alice's recent blunder, we now had nearly conclusive evidence.

Alice might be a bit unfortunate, but the results of her experiment were praiseworthy in many ways.

I won't elaborate on why we're praising her since I'm afraid of everyone's probing questions.

Now, regarding Alice's recent failed magic, there was one thing that caught my attention.

"Alice."

"Huff, huff, what?"

I stopped Alice, who was chasing Lin and out of breath, and decided to ask her about the magic from earlier.

About that incantation she used, did you come up with it yourself? Or did you use some reference?

"I thought of it myself."

"In that split second?"

"Yeah. But it's weird, you know? I've never failed even with random incantations before. Why did it fail this time?"

Random incantations... Can they really activate magic?

I know the reason for the recent failure, so I'll ignore that and think about incantations. Incantations can be random.

Is that so? I think it was initially considered as a way to supplement one's imagination.

Even with such vague understanding, they still activate. Magic power really responds directly to our hearts. It seems that words serve to clarify one's own imagination.

If that's the case... maybe I should try something.

"After school, should I go to the wilderness..."

I thought of experimenting in the wilderness and it slipped out of my mouth. Everyone turned to me with shocked expressions.

"What? What are you planning to mess up this time?"

"W-W-Wolford! Seriously, please, please! Spare the world from destruction!"

Og was assuming I'd mess something up again, which was cruel, but Olivia was even crueler. We're about to embark on a battle to save the world, and she's worried about destroying it first!

"I'm not going to mess up anything, and I won't destroy the world! I just want to conduct a little experiment!"

"An experiment? Then you should report it to Lady Merida."

"Oh, that's right, Maria. Shin, if you experiment, you have to do it in front of Granny, or she'll get mad, you know?"

As Shishiry said, Granny should be present for the experiment. So instead of heading to the wilderness directly after school, I'll go home first. Once the after-school schedule was determined, I was considering what kind of experiment to conduct when Alice interrupted my thoughts.

"Hey, why didn't the cake appear? Why, Shin?"

She hadn't given up yet?

Anyway, I explained that it was impossible because objects are complex, and then stopped explaining further. I could elaborate, but I couldn't explain how I knew all this.

And then came the after school.

Having already gone home once and not just with Granny as a chaperone, Grandpa, who was very interested in my actions, came with us to the wilderness.

Granny is already holding her temples and her stomach area.

"Every time I accompany your magic experiments to this place, my stomach hurts..."

"Granny, you're such a scaredy-cat. I'm looking forward to what Shin will show us this time."

"It's because you're like that that Shin ended up like this!"

Oh, this reminds me of the time I first demonstrated magic. Grandpa is being scolded by Granny.

"Hey, you two. Instead of bickering, can we get started soon?"

"We're not bickering!"

"You're in perfect sync."

Even though they are in perfect sync, what are they saying?

"As always, I have no confidence in stopping their fights."

"You're really something, dealing with their argument so easily."

Og and Thor praised me unexpectedly. I don't feel happy about being praised for that.

Anyway, it's time for the experiment.

"Um, so first..."

To activate magic, I gather magic power.

The amount is... extremely minimal.

As a magic user, I'm on the verge of being able to activate magic.

"This is another unexpected development... What are you planning to do?"

"Interesting. What are you planning to do?"

See, it was just bickering after all.

While listening to Grandpa and Granny's conversation, I don't interject. I was too focused and nervous about what I was going to do.

What I'm about to do is an experiment with incantations.

However, creating an incantation that I've never used before at this point is impossible. So, what I heard was a hint from Alice's incantation the other day.

If the definition of an incantation isn't so strict, I thought there might be a way to activate it without feeling too embarrassed.

"Alright, let's go."

I'm going to try a fire magic spell.

The incantation I saw in the magic academy's entrance exam is too embarrassing to use. But this one...

"Ignition."

With that one word, the small amount of gathered magic power reacted and created a spark.

"Accelerated combustion."

As I spoke these words, the spark dramatically grew larger.

"Area of effect."

And let's not forget the designation of the magic's area of effect.

"Launch."

Finally, as I uttered the activation word, the enlarged fireball was launched.

The impact of the fireball landed, affecting only the area in front of it while leaving behind it, to the sides, and back untouched.

Looking at the place where it landed...

"Wow... That's amazing."

Despite using only a tiny amount of magic power, a crater about the same size as when I first showcased magic to the Dis family has formed.

"Chanting is incredible."

I said so, and when I turned to look at everyone, they had not expressions of astonishment or fear, but rather a mixture of the two.

Why?

"Shin, you, the chanting..."

"Something is different! Something is different, Shin!"

"That's right! Chanting should be more... poetic or something..."

Og appears confused, Alice seems a little angry, and Olivia insists that chanting should be more poetic.

Well, I didn't want to do that kind of poetic chanting. Not wanting to perform a poetic chant, I decided to try uttering each phenomenon separately.

The result was the original incantation from before.

...Well, honestly, I don't think I can even call that an incantation. But, if it doesn't make a difference whether it's poetic or business-like, I'll choose the business-like way.

"Well, it's fine, right? The result is the same. Besides, you can't use incantations in actual combat, and as Lin has been pointing out, the variety of magic available is very limited. Plus, as I discovered in this experiment, it takes time to activate. If you were to use incantations, you'd have to use them for long-range attacks."

After experimenting, I still believed that incantations couldn't be used in combat. As Lin suggested, it would only be useful for long-range attacks.

When I explained this, Lin had a proposal.

"In that case, you can stand on the walls surrounding the magic city and launch magic towards the city."

At Lin's suggestion, everyone except me had a complicated expression.

In this world, wars mainly consist of both sides exchanging magic attacks first, followed by their armies clashing. While there are various strategies, launching magic unilaterally from long distances towards an enemy city is seen as unfair or something along those lines.

So, although everyone felt that it could be an effective approach, they couldn't help but feel that it was somewhat unfair, and their expressions became complicated. However, I saw things differently.

Long-range remote bombardment from a safe location was normal in my past life, and there was an understanding that ground warfare can turn into a quagmire.

Emotionally, I agreed with Lin's suggestion, but I had to reject it for a specific reason.

"It's a good idea, indeed... but I can't do it."

"Why? Is it because it's unfair?"

Lin is likely aware that this could be considered an unfair tactic. She probably thinks the reason for rejecting it is because it's unfair.

"I said it was a good idea, didn't I? I believe that the attack method itself isn't wrong. But..."

"But what?"

Og prodded me to continue when I hesitated.

"I think if we use half-hearted magic, Strom will catch on and defend against it. If that happens, we'll need to release even more powerful magic."

As I said this, I looked at everyone's nervous expressions.

"...If you cast such a powerful magic from a long distance, the surrounding area will become uninhabitable for quite a wide range."

"I knew this was a bad idea. Just forget it."

The one who initially proposed it, Lin, immediately withdrew her suggestion. She must have imagined the potential consequences of my executing her plan, and everyone's faces turned pale.

"It's a good thing we discussed it beforehand. Otherwise, there might have been a possibility of Shin being asked to carry out that operation."

"Yes, that's right. We have no choice but to invade the Magic City directly and defeat the magic users."

Og sighed and expressed relief, and Thole confirmed the strategy for this battle.

"Then, should we practice a bit more?"

"What kind of magic are you planning to try next?"

"Explosive magic."

As soon as I said that, everyone scattered from around me like a bunch of spiders, activating their jet boots and deploying both their personal and magical tool's energy barriers.

"Anytime!"

"Come at us!"

"But be gentle!"

Og, Alice, and Olivia called out, well-prepared.

Hey. I conducted experiments with directional magic earlier, didn't I? How untrustworthy do they think I am?

While watching Shin try explosive magic after his fire magic experiment, Merida muttered something to herself.

"That kid has some good friends."

"Indeed."

Merida and Merlin watched Shin playfully interacting with August's group, wearing somewhat sentimental expressions.

"Even after hearing the discussion earlier, he's still the same as always."

Shin responded to Lin's proposal by saying he didn't use long-range magic to defeat Strom because he couldn't but rather because he chose not to. This implied that he could use a spell capable of devastating a several-kilometer radius. Despite this revelation, August's group didn't fear Shin's capability to wield such magic. On the contrary, they were relieved he hadn't used it. When Shin explained his ability to August's group, he didn't hesitate because he had full confidence in them.

"Enrolling that child in the Magic Academy was filled with both expectations and concerns. We were worried that no one would come near him because of his overwhelming power."

"Indeed, I was confident. Shin is a good kid. No one would be so heartless as to ignore a good kid like him."

"Hmph, anyone can say that later."

"What did you say?"

After this exchange, Merlin and Merida stared each other down for a moment, but eventually, they both let out a smile.

"Well, worries like that are in the past now. Look at how happy he is."

"He even found such a cute fiancée. I can't wait to see my great-grandchild's face."

"That's all... Ah, after we win this battle."

"Yes, if we can make it happen."

"Oh, is that so?"

From the grandparents' smiles as they watched their grandchildren having fun moments earlier, they now assumed the faces of seasoned warriors. As they looked at each other, a deafening explosion echoed.

"What... what's happening?"

"What on earth is going on!?"

Both grandparents directed their gaze towards Shin, who was making a "uh-oh" face as he faced them. Most likely, he miscalculated the amount of magic power while continuing the incantation experiment for the explosive magic. This led to a massive explosion that shook the surrounding air.

Merida's anger erupted, both due to Shin ruining the serious scene and his reckless actions.

"Shin!! Is this kid for real?!"

"Whoa! Sorry, Granny!!"

"Wait up! I'm not done with you!"

Shin fled, and Merida chased after him. Watching the two of them, Merlin shrugged his shoulders in a resigned manner.

Now, he contemplated what he and Merida had discussed earlier.

"Well, I guess it's time to talk to Diaseum."

He muttered this while observing Shin getting scolded by Merida.
