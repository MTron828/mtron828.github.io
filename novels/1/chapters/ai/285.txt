"Wow, that was scary..."

"Was it really that scary?"

Right now, I'm attending a strategy meeting to capture corrupt politicians from the Darm region.

I couldn't help but mutter the words after recalling Ekaterina's appearance just now, and Tony, who was sitting next to me, looked at me with a puzzled expression.

I see, maybe Tony has only seen Ekaterina smiling so brightly. She even calls it "pest control" with a smile when eliminating corrupt politicians. I felt a bit sorry for the corrupt politicians who were being exterminated.

"Hmm, when it comes to governing a nation, being gentle alone isn't enough, huh?"

"That's right."

Ekaterina is generally known as a person filled with kindness and compassion due to her role as the religious leader, but she also serves as the head of the Holy State of East, a top position in the Shingon religion. It seems like you need both kindness and strictness.

Moreover, religion isn't just about being kind. In most religions, if you commit a sin, you'll end up in hell, and the torments in that hell are usually quite severe. Well, it's probably a warning to live a righteous life, considering what happens when you do something bad.

"By the way, we're about to go catch corrupt politicians in various cities, but I guess these politicians are the leaders of their respective cities, right? Will they just surrender without resistance?"

"They'll definitely resist. After all, we're going to apprehend people from the underworld."

"Yeah, you're right. If they don't believe our claims that Darm's sovereignty has been handed over to East, what do we do then?"

"Of course, we'll have to take a tougher approach."

"!!"

While Tony and I were discussing this, Ekaterina suddenly interrupted.

When did she come over here?

"I've prepared arrest warrants listing the charges and a letter of authorization from Darm. If they still resist after seeing these... "

Ekaterina said that much and smiled.

"V-very well. We'll apprehend them promptly."

"Thank you."

With a warm smile, Ekaterina left the area.

"That was... scary."

"See? I told you."

"Yeah... I've never realized that a woman's smile could be so terrifying."

"Is that so? Haven't you experienced it many times before?"

"Hey, when did you arrive, Mrs. Zenith?"

As I teased her, Mrs. Zenith, Maria, blushed deeply.

"You're so loud! Don't say that kind of thing!"

"Huh? But it's the truth, Mrs. Zenith."

"Yeah, what's wrong, Mrs. Zenith?"

"You guys..."

Carlotta and the newlywed Maria, who had not yet gotten used to her new last name and being called "Mrs.," blushed greatly when referred to as "Mrs. Zenith." It was amusing, but I should stop teasing Maria further because she might explode.

"Maria, are you joining us this time, even though you're newlyweds? It might turn into a messy situation with bloodshed, you know?"

"I'm fine with it. Whether I'm married or not, I'm not going to change. More importantly, I can't let those scoundrels who targeted Ellie and Sicily go unpunished."

Maria's anger towards those who tried to harm her best friends was intense. If they were in front of her, she might strangle them.

"...Just so you know, this time it's an apprehension, right? The targets are humans, not demons. Make sure to go easy on them."

"I understand. Well, there might be a chance my emotions get the better of me..."

"Please don't let that happen!"

"Fine, fine."

Why is Maria clicking her tongue like those people? It's scary. Why are all the women around me so scary?

"Maria, you seem pretty upset."

"That's right. And aren't you angry too, Mark?"

"Of course, I'm angry. Max's life was threatened, even if he got involved unintentionally. No parent wouldn't be angry, right?"

Mark, who is usually smiling, wore a stern expression this time.

I need to make sure of this as well.

"More importantly, it's strange that Walford seems so composed. I thought he'd be furious."

As she said that, Lynn also joined the conversation.

"I am angry. But I've decided, in consultation with Oug, that I'll make them suffer more than just dying. It would be too easy for them to just die."

When I said that, Tony and Mark had horrified expressions.

Lynn, for some reason, raised her thumb.

"It seems like he's not nervous at all."

As we were having this conversation, Oug entered the meeting room.

Right now, in the conference room of Darm Castle, Oug, Ekaterina, the active members of the Ultimate Magicians (excluding the newcomers), and the elite individuals chosen from various countries are gathered.

The simultaneous capture of Darm's pests—corrupt politicians—will begin shortly.

"First, I'll have the Ultimate Magicians take on the roles of the city leaders in each city. One for each city. Any objections?"

Ekaterina scanned the room, but no one voiced any objections.

"Very well. We'll provide the city leaders with arrest warrants listing the charges against the politicians in each city. We'll also give them a letter of delegation, which states that Darm's full authority has been delegated to East. If the politicians surrender without resistance upon seeing these documents, that's fine. But if they resist, it's acceptable to inflict non-lethal injuries."

"For the arrests, please use these handcuffs. They are made by Arlesheid and are easy to use."

Oug said this and took out a large number of handcuffs from his dimensional storage.

I made these because I thought it would be inefficient to use ropes, which were the standard method of apprehension in this world. Of course, it's a reuse of my previous life's knowledge.

When I made these, the security team members were very grateful. Elite individuals from various countries are also expressing their admiration for Arlesheid's handcuffs.

Some of them are even negotiating with Oug, asking if they can get a sample to use in their own countries.

Leaving that aside, the plan for this operation is to simultaneously subdue all the cities. This is partially my fault because I introduced fixed communication devices to ordinary households in Arlesheid. And that technology spread to foreign countries.

Now, every household has at least one fixed communication device. This includes the Lord's Mansion.

The political system in Darm is slightly different from my previous life. Representatives are elected through elections in each city, and the elected politicians become the lords of those cities. There were no governors or local council members.

This aspect was quite disorganized. As a result, the elected politicians ended up having immense power in their respective cities.

As we demolish each of those cities one by one, the information quickly circulates through the fixed communication devices, and we anticipate that some individuals will manage to escape.

To prevent that, it was decided to carry out simultaneous arrests in each city.

"Now, once you've confirmed your assigned cities, assemble with the assault teams. When the signal is given, the city leaders will open the gates, and we'll subdue them all at once. Is that clear?"

"Yes!"

In response to Ekaterina's words, everyone unanimously replied.

"Alright... Commence the operation! Open the gates!"

With the command, we opened the gates to each city.

Thanks to the previous activities of the Ultimate Magicians in these cities, this operation could be executed smoothly.

Through the opened gates, elite individuals poured into the cities.

Finally, I also passed through the gate because it needed to be closed.

After closing the gate, I headed towards the Lord's Mansion.

There, the gatekeeper was trembling as he witnessed a sudden influx of soldiers.

"We have been entrusted with full authority by Darm's Prime Minister. We are members of the Darm Provisional Government! As of today, the parliamentary system is abolished, and all privileges are revoked!"

I stated this and attempted to forcefully pass through the gate.

The gatekeeper, who had been trembling, hurriedly stepped in front of me.

"What's this!?"

"What's going on? I can't just believe this all of a sudden!"

"This is the letter of delegation! We don't have time for this. If you want to know more, check it after we're done!"

"Huh!?"

"Let's go!!"

"Wait a minute!"

As this was a criminal apprehension, I deliberately asserted myself with a commanding tone. As expected, the gatekeeper was easily persuaded under the pressure, and he allowed the elite individuals to enter.

He rushed to follow after us, but it was already too late.

Ignoring the gatekeeper shouting something from behind, I kicked open the doors of the Lord's Mansion.

"What the...!?"

Inside the Lord's Mansion, it was filled with individuals who didn't look like ordinary officials. They had genuinely privatized their positions as parliamentarians, and I can understand why the country fell into chaos.

"We are members of the Darm Provisional Government! As of today, Darm's full authority has been delegated to us! The parliamentary system is abolished, and all privileges are revoked! Furthermore!!"

To prevent the delinquents who were suddenly intruding and confused from having any room for argument, I immediately delivered my words forcefully.

"Arrest warrants have been issued for the parliament members here due to numerous crimes! Surrender quietly!!"

As I loudly proclaimed this, the delinquents, who were initially stunned, gradually started to show signs of anger.

"Don't come in here out of nowhere and talk nonsense!! You guys! Get 'em!!"

"Yeah!!"

Ah, it seems like I managed to incite them well.

Arrest warrants haven't been prepared for the delinquents gathered here. Therefore, I couldn't forcefully arrest them. So, I decided to provoke them and arrest them for obstructing official duties.

For ordinary citizens, they had an overwhelming sense of intimidation, but they posed no threat to the elite professionals who were experts in combat. The delinquents who dared to confront us were swiftly apprehended.

I didn't participate in this rampage, and I headed straight for the Lord's office.

I passed by butlers and maids along the way, but they didn't obstruct my path at all. Instead, they guided me to the Lord's office.

I guess that's their way of saying, "Please arrest them quickly." It's convenient not to have to deal with unnecessary formalities.

As a result, I smoothly reached the Lord's office and, without even knocking, kicked open the door.

"What's wrong with you!? You've been making noise for a while now!!"

"I am a member of the Darm Provisional Government! There's an arrest warrant issued for you! Surrender quietly! If you resist, there will be no mercy!"

"Huh!? What nonsense are you spouting!! Don't mess around!!"

The parliament member in the office responded in a tone that didn't seem like that of a politician and then drew a sword to attack.

However, despite being involved in the criminal underworld, they were ultimately amateurs. I calmly avoided the sword and struck their wrist with the edge of my hand to make them drop the weapon. As they groaned in pain, I quickly handcuffed them from behind to complete the arrest.

"Let go, you bastard!! Stop fooling around!!"

Since they continued to be noisy even after being apprehended, I silenced them with a muzzle.

I can't use sleep magic or anything like that.

This way, the parliament member I was responsible for was swiftly apprehended.

By the way, this person is not the mastermind behind the attack on Ellie.

The one responsible for that is...

Oug. I hope he doesn't go too far.
