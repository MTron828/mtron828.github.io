"Come on, you guys... use magic to make the first move and stay put!"

"Alright."

"Haha, sorry."

"We're really sorry!"

Once again, we received a reprimand from Oug for almost making the same mistake.

Tony and I were used to it, but Miranda was very respectful and kept apologizing.

"You don't need to apologize so much."

"Why not? He's our lord, right? He's the crown prince, right? Why is he so casual about it?!"

I tried to encourage Miranda to take it easy, but she got upset, asking why I was saying that.

Even if she asked why, I couldn't help it...

"Because it's Oug?"

"I can't stand it anymore... I feel like my stomach is going to burst..."

"Are you okay? Should we have Sicily apply some healing magic for you?"

"Why is everyone saying the same thing?"

I thought Miranda had built up some resistance to this sort of thing since she had been with us for a while now, but apparently not.

"No need to worry. Oug isn't the type to get upset over little things..."

"GYAWOOOO!!!!"

"Oops, I left them alone too long."

"They seem really angry."

When I tried to console Miranda, the dragons roared at us.

It seemed we had neglected them for too long.

They got fed up and roared.

"Now's the time! Everyone, fire!!"

"Yes!!"

It seemed like they were waiting for that moment. In response to Oug's command, everyone had been gathering magic power.

The magic released simultaneously by the ten Ultimate Magicians, excluding Tony and me, successfully inflicted significant damage to the dragons, led by the Tyrant Dragon as they had done earlier, bringing their movement to a complete halt.

"All right!"

Seeing this, I activated my jet boots.

I dashed toward the Tyrant Dragon in front of me.

"GUWO!"

The Tyrant Dragon prepared itself as I approached.

I executed a feigned dash toward the Tyrant Dragon, just as I had done earlier.

The Tyrant Dragon must have remembered my previous move.

It was baited and raised its head.

By raising its head, it created space underneath its body.

I activated my jet boots and flew into that space.

There, I found the defenseless feet of the Tyrant Dragon.
!

"I won't let you call me 'headhunter' anymore!"

I swung the vibration sword towards the Tyrant Dragon's right leg.

The not-so-thick leg of the Tyrant Dragon was severed without any resistance.

"GYAAAAA!!"

In extreme pain from having one of its limbs severed, the Tyrant Dragon screamed and thrashed around.

To avoid being caught up in the rampaging Tyrant Dragon, I continued to sever its other leg and escaped from underneath its body.

With nothing to support its body, the Tyrant Dragon collapsed to the ground.

As I was in the middle of escaping from underneath its body, the Tyrant Dragon fell in front of my eyes...

"Ah..."

Oops.

It was a reflex...

"Oh... I accidentally beheaded it..."

I hadn't intended to finish it off with the sword at the end...

Well, I guess it's okay since I managed to defeat the Tyrant Dragon, the strongest among the dragon monsters.

Now, what about the other two...

"Wow, cool!"

Tony, on the other hand, was efficiently inflicting damage on the armored dragon's tough skin by flowing his vibration swords smoothly.

Two of the armored dragon's four legs were already gone.

Its tough body was covered in wounds.

"Hmm, it's so thick..."

Tony, who was gracefully wielding his vibration swords, had momentarily distanced himself from the armored dragon.

He didn't seem to be having too much trouble, but it appeared he was lacking a decisive blow.

After some thought, Tony adjusted his stance and raised his sword again.

"Guess I don't have a choice. Let's go!"

Muttering to himself, Tony activated his jet boots, flew into the air in front of the armored dragon, and fired a wind magic spell down at the armored dragon below.

Being pushed down by the wind pressure on its head, the armored dragon was pinned to the ground as Tony descended towards it with his vibration sword.

"This should be thinner up here, right?!"

Saying that, Tony thrust his vibration sword into the top of the armored dragon's head.

The armored dragon's skin was probably too thick to inflict a fatal wound by cutting its body or neck. In contrast, the top of its head had no thick skin.

The vibration sword pierced through the skull, and Tony destroyed the armored dragon's brain.

The armored dragon, after a large jolt, crumbled and fell into silence.

"Oh, you did great!"

"Haha, I struggled a bit."

For Tony, leaving the armored dragon all battered and bruised seemed to be a point of reflection.

But it didn't look that way to me.

"Two-sword style is really cool."

"Do you think so? By the way, how's Miranda?"

"Oh, she seems to be fine over there."

While watching Tony, I kept an eye on Miranda. She was either calculating the distance from the horned dragon, trying to ease her tension, or practicing dodging the horned dragon's horn attacks using her jet boots.

"Wow."

"Active duty still has a different level of movement."

Tony and I didn't think we had gotten rusty, but compared to Miranda, who had been constantly practicing swordsmanship while on active duty, it seemed that we had a considerable gap in terms of agility.

"We're from the Magic Academy, after all."

"It may be inevitable, but it's a bit frustrating."

As we justified ourselves, Miranda's movements, which had been focused on dodging, suddenly changed.

"Oh, she looks determined."

As Tony mentioned, Miranda evaded a charge and used her jet boots to leap into the vulnerable spot of the off-balance horned dragon. She swiftly thrust her vibration sword into the area where the heart was presumed to be, withdrew before the blood spurted, and left the spot.

The sword had precisely pierced the heart, as a massive amount of blood gushed out, and the horned dragon died on the spot.

Oh... Come to think of it, this is the first time I've seen Miranda's combat up close. She looks pretty cool.

"Phew."

After the battle, Miranda took a breather and then joined us.

And, as expected...

"Wolford, you really are a headhunter."

"Ugh... they're saying it again."

I ended up being labeled as a headhunter by Lin.

"Tony, you're surprisingly ruthless. Stabbing the brain and all..."

"Well, it couldn't be helped. Its skin was too thick."

Tony hurriedly tried to explain to Maria's comment.

Well, you really can't know what it's like until you actually do it.

Amidst all this, Miranda received the highest praise.

"Great job, Miranda!"

"You were so cool, Miranda!"

"Yeah! Dodging gracefully and then stabbing it, that was awesome!"

Receiving praise from Sicily, Olivia, and Alice, Miranda blushed and seemed embarrassed.

"No, well... A knight should be able to do that much."

"That's not true at all!"

Yuri called out to Miranda, who was being modest. It seemed like the girls' admiration was more significant.

This...?

While watching Miranda in this situation, Maria grabbed my shoulder with a sigh.

"Shin... please don't say that; it bothers Miranda."

"Uh, yeah..."

Come to think of it, Maria was also often admired by the junior girls. Perhaps she felt a sense of camaraderie with them.

"...Are you thinking about something annoying?"

"N-No?"

As we had this exchange, a voice that wasn't ours sounded in a place where there should be no one other than us.

"Ugh, dealing with these silly people..."

The voice was from someone other than us, and we used a detection spell to find the source.

"A demon..."

On top of the walls of the Demon Capital, several demons were standing there.
