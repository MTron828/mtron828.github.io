The training for the use of the magic tool, the Vibrating Sword, began.

The first round of training with the Earlshide Army went smoothly. Having prepared a large quantity of swords with enchantments in advance was indeed a significant advantage.

Now, the second round of training was with the Swiede Kingdom.

"Yes! I'm done!"

"Lord Demon King, I'm next!"

"All right! Just a moment!"

This conversation wasn't happening in a cafeteria during lunch. It was my voice, as I emerged from the enchanting tent after enchanting the swords provided by the Swiede Kingdom, and the voice of a Swiede Kingdom soldier who passed the next weapon to me, as I accepted it somewhat desperately and returned to the tent. Upon entering the enchanting tent, it was like stepping into a battlefield.

This round of training was specifically for learning how to use the Vibrating Sword. So, to begin with, you needed a Vibrating Sword. Those who didn't have their completed Vibrating Sword had to wait and observe while their turn was still in the queue. Once the Vibrating Sword was obtained, they would quickly start their own training.

The training itself was progressing smoothly. The knights and swordsmen from the Earlshide Army, who had finished their training first, joined in as helpers. This suggestion from Chris nee-chan was not only accepted by the Swiede Kingdom but by other countries as well. Thanks to that, the training was going remarkably well.

However, the supply side of things wasn't going so smoothly.

I'm really glad I made the duplicating device for enchantments. If I had to imagine "ultrasonic vibrations" each time while enchanting, the supply process would have come to a complete standstill. It wasn't just for the participants in the training; I had to enchant for everyone who was going to participate in the upcoming battle. The number was extraordinarily high.

When I finally finished enchanting all the weapons provided by the Swiede Kingdom, several hours had passed since the start.

"Ugh... I'm tired."

"Good job, Shin-kun. Please take a break here."

After I complained at home that I needed to finish a large number of enchantments during training starting tomorrow, Cecily got worried and came along with me. Near the enchanting tent, there was another area that resembled the seats for officials during a sports festival, and Cecily suggested that I take that seat. I sat down and relaxed.

"Please have some tea and sweets."

"Thanks... Ahh, I'm coming back to life..."

I enjoyed the pleasant scent of the tea and sweet snacks, finally feeling like myself again.

"Good job. Are you pushing yourself too hard?"

"I'm not pushing too hard, but it's just the quantity... Ah, my shoulders are stiff."

I had been pressing the enchantment duplicator on the swords like stamping a seal. I had done it so many times that my right shoulder was pretty stiff. I rotated my shoulder a few times to loosen it.

"Do you feel okay?"

As I brooded about the future, Cecily moved behind me and started massaging my shoulder.

"Mmm... Ah, right there..."

"Hehe, is this relaxing?"

She might not have been using a lot of force, but just the act of Cecily massaging my shoulder felt great. While I was enjoying this, someone approached us from the side.

"The Demon King and the Saintess seem to be as close as the rumors say."

"That is correct, Your Majesty."

It was His Majesty, the King of the Swiede Kingdom, and the Chief Officer of the Swiede Kingdom Army. They had come to visit the scene for inspection and noticed me coming out of the tent.

"Oh! I apologize for the indecent display!"

"Oh no, Saintess, you don't need to worry about it. We were fortunate to witness the lovely relationship between the Demon King and the Saintess, which is renowned everywhere."

"Such a reputation!?"

"Well, weren't you aware, Demon King? Right now, among the common folk, when they talk about the best couple, they mean the Demon King and the Saintess."

Cecily rushed to my side to apologize, but the King of Swiede openly mentioned our embarrassing information, which the army's chief then elaborated on.

Seriously? Is that kind of reputation circulating about us? It must have been Cecily's first time hearing about it, as she stood next to me, blushing intensely and looking down.

"Hahaha, you two are so fresh. Just by looking at you, I feel like I need to step up my game."

"That's right. When I see both of you, I think I should be kinder to my wife."

"Oh, indeed. I had exactly the same thought."

Whether they were teasing or genuinely felt that way, the two of them were laughing and having a good time.

"So, how was the inspection?"

"Yes, with the assistance of the Earlsheid army, it seems to be going smoothly. With this, we should be able to overcome the upcoming challenges."

"Exactly. We can't thank Demon King enough."

"True, Demon King, you can leave the training to the soldiers and take a break for a while. Would you like me to have a meal brought from the castle's kitchen?"

"No, I'm fine. Your thoughts are more than enough."

"Hmm. Demon King is humble."

"Indeed, holding immense power that has no equal, while maintaining humility... I want the soldiers to learn from you."

Even refusing a meal earned me compliments... This is getting tiring...

"Your Majesty, it's time."

When it started getting tough, the royal aide reminded the king.

"I see, is it already that time? I'm sorry, but I have other official matters to attend to. I'll take my leave."

"Thank you for your time."

"Thank you."

"Yes."

Cecily and I expressed our gratitude, and the Swiede King left the scene.

"Now, I will also inspect the training. Demon King, you should rest."

"Yes, thank you."

With that, the chief officer also departed.

Come to think of it, neither of them addressed us by name throughout the conversation.

"Sigh... I get nervous and feel pressured when it's a king from another country..."

"Shin-kun, you get nervous even with kings from other countries?"

"Of course. They're kings, you know? The leaders of their countries. It's only natural to be nervous."

I looked at Cecily, wondering what she found so remarkable, but she just tilted her head.

"King Diseum is the top leader of his country, too, and it's even larger than any of the neighboring countries."

Cecily pointed out, but I found that aspect more mysterious.

"King Diseum is like an uncle to me, so it's different."

He's a relative, and that position is unwavering.

No matter how king-like they may act...

"Indeed... It's not surprising to think that way when you see His Majesty's behavior at Shin's house..."

Cecily has been staying with us for her recent bride training, so she often meets Uncle Diseum. At our house, he's completely off-duty, and he has no dignity whatsoever. I've been used to seeing him in that state since I was a child, and I've always thought of him as a family uncle. So even if you tell me he's the king now...

Aaron, the President of Els, and Ekaterina, the Pope of East, are the same. They're treated like family by Grandpa and Grandma, so I don't have a strong awareness that those two are the heads of their respective states. I was nervous at first, but now I feel like they're part of the family.

However, it's not the same for kings from other countries. They are virtually unknown people, the leaders of other nations, and honestly, it's awkward to talk to them even if they approach me in a friendly manner. So kings of smaller countries are harder to deal with... It's fine for them to visit like this for inspections, but I'd prefer it if they didn't engage in conversations. Well, it's fine, they're unlikely to talk to me tomorrow anyway.

"Cecily, what will you do tomorrow?"

"Tomorrow?... Ah."

Tomorrow is the Darm Kingdom. The country that raised objections to me during the summit held in Earlsheid. I don't think that king will come to greet me.

I'm somewhat relieved about that.

"...Cecily, the king of Darm was the one who complained about me, right?"

"Yes, but what should I do? Will you be home tomorrow?"

"No! It's my duty to heal a tired Shin."

Cecily declared with determination. However, her voice was apparently too loud, as the soldiers from Swiede's army and the help of the Earlsheid army working nearby all turned their attention towards us. Their expressions were the kind you make when you've seen something heartwarming.

"Uh..."

Realizing this, Cecily turned bright red to the point where steam could practically come out of her ears and she hid behind me.

And so, the next day arrived. I came to the Darm Kingdom, where there had been a previous dispute with the king. In Darm, thanks to the prior notification from Earlsheid, a tent for the application of the vibrational swords was set up.

Next to the tent, weapons meant for applying the enchantments are stacked with name tags. What's there now is for the people participating in the training. Even after this is done, I'll have to apply the enchantments for everyone participating in the upcoming battle.

"Sigh... Do I have to do this many enchantments again today?"

"Y-You have to do your best..."

Cecily looks a bit worried as she's seen how tired I was yesterday. In fact, she offered to help with the enchantments last night. Since anyone can do the enchantments with a transcription device, it would be possible for Cecily to assist. However, if we did that, the existence of the transcription device that allows anyone to apply enchantments would become apparent. So, to maintain the illusion that only I can do the enchantments, I declined Cecily's offer to help, even though I appreciated her consideration.

Anyway, without applying enchantments to these weapons, the training can't proceed. It's a daunting task, but as I was about to start the enchantments, someone from the Darm side called out.

"Can I have a moment, Shin Wolford?"

"Huh?!"

I never expected a voice from the kingdom that had complained about me directly to the king, so I was taken aback and let out a surprised yelp.

"What's wrong? Is there something that surprising?"

Even though I was startled, I looked at the man who approached. There stood a man with short black hair and a narrow face. He wore knightly armor, and there were knights around him, likely his guards, so he seemed to be a high-ranking knight. His eyes were narrow and gave him a serpent-like impression.

"Oh, no. It's nothing, really. But more importantly... How can I assist you?"

I asked what he needed from me while wondering why a knight from the Darm Knight Corps would approach me. The man, who appeared to hold a high position in the Darm Knight Corps, wore an expression of slight bewilderment.

"Well, is something the matter?"

"Hmm? Oh, no, not really. I just found it a bit surprising."

"I see..."

I don't know what he found surprising, but it's a bit odd for someone I've just met to be so familiar.

"Right, right, the reason I called you was... In the previous meeting, our king seems to have been rather rude. Sorry about that."

"Huh?"

"Dealing with the hero who's supposed to save the world... I wonder what our king is thinking. It's rather unexpected."

"Umm..."

I was taken aback by this unexpected apology.

Hold on a minute.

Didn't this person just openly criticize the king?

I broke out in a cold sweat without realizing it.

This person is probably a high-ranking member of the Darm Knight Corps.

And yet, they were openly criticizing their own king. What's the deal? Are they close to the royal family? Perhaps they're from a noble family and around the same age as the king, who appears to be in his late twenties?

"Oops, my apologies. I haven't introduced myself yet. I'm Heero Cartun, the Commander-in-Chief of the Darm Kingdom Army."

The Commander-in-Chief of the Darm Kingdom Army!? So he's the top of the military! At this young age!?

And his name... this person is a commoner.

A commoner criticizing the royals? Moreover, the head of the military? What's going on here? It all seems quite inconsistent.

Besides, while he might be the military's top commander, looking at his armored body, the knights surrounding him seem to have superior physical builds. He doesn't appear all that strong.

Of course, even in the Sylphiette Kingdom, there is no law requiring the Commander-in-Chief to be the strongest. It should be more about leadership skills...

Oh no, I forgot to respond because the situation is so unusual.

"Umm, I'm sorry. I'm Shin Wolford, the representative of the Ultimate Magicians."

"Haha, I know. That's why I approached you."

"Uh..."

He's really too familiar.

"So, Cartun-san, what can I do for you?"

"Well, it's a bit too formal, huh? How about calling me Heero? Let's drop the honorifics. I'll call you Shin as well."

"Huh?! Um, no, I can't speak so informally with someone older I just met!"

This guy is unbelievable.

I can't just give up on using honorifics when asked. When I flatly rejected his absurd proposal, he looked even more puzzled.

"Hmm... I see. Alright, Wolford-kun. There's something I wanted to say."

"Uh, what is it?"

"Ah, a bit stuffy, huh? How about just calling me Heero and ditching the formalities? I'll call you Shin, after all."

"Huh?! No, no, I can't speak so informally with someone older I just met!"

What is wrong with this guy?

When he asked me to stop using honorifics, I couldn't just go along with it. I firmly rejected his outrageous suggestion, and he looked even more puzzled.

"Well... I see. Okay, Wolford-kun. I just had one thing to say."

"Yes, what is it?"

"It's just that King Darm is the only one who views you as an enemy in Darm. The others here know that you saved the day twice when our people caused the worst possible incidents."

"Is that so?"

I thought everyone disliked me because of the king's attitude.

"Of course, you are. You're the hero who will save the world, the hope, and not to mention, you have an adorable fiancée. You're truly a hero."

When he mentioned the adorable fiancée part, he looked at Sicily from head to toe as if sizing her up.

Sicily seemed uncomfortable with that gaze and tensed up a bit.

What is this guy's deal?

"What are you thinking, openly criticizing someone like you? The hero who will save the world."

Still, is it even okay for him to openly criticize the king like this, especially with others around? His overly familiar attitude, his impolite gaze towards Sicily, his nerve to criticize the king so openly—honestly, I don't really like this guy much...

"That's all I wanted to say. Well, good luck with the bestowal. I'll join in too."

"Understood."

With that, Commander Cartun walked away.

In the end, all he did was criticize his own king and leave. Sicily, the escort knights from Earlsheid, and I looked at each other.

What was that? Huh?

The Commander-in-Chief of the Darm Army, Heero Cartun, who had visited Shin, was now frowning and muttering to himself. Gone was the seemingly frivolous demeanor he had moments ago.

"... What's up with that? Normally, in situations like this, you should be on a first-name basis with anyone right away..."

The escort knights who could hear his voice had no idea what he was saying, even though they understood the words.

"And... damn it, is that a cliché, too? Having such a cute girl as his girlfriend..."

The escort knights understood that as well. The girl beside Shin was the rumored Holy Maiden, after all. Beautiful, filled with compassion, a true Holy Maiden. Such a girl, snuggling up next to Shin. Honestly, it was pretty envy-inducing.

"... Oh well. I don't like it, but making an enemy out of that guy would be foolish. Honestly, I wish His Majesty would think about this much... "

The top military official of the nation openly criticizing the king. The escort knights felt it was a very dangerous situation, but due to their positions and the difference in power, none of them could voice their opinions to Cartun.

Despite the escort knights' internal struggles, Cartun's muttering continued.

"Well, precisely because of our king, after this commotion ends..."

Heh heh heh.

A laugh as if suppressing something.

Having witnessed the commander-in-chief's criticism of the king earlier, the escort knights were on guard, suspecting that this commander might harbor dangerous thoughts about the future.

"Now then, shall we have some training with the Ultimate Magician's amazing magical tools for a while?"

And he ended with another statement that made no sense.

The escort knights, wary of the suspicious commander standing before them, were unable to do anything but stare. There was a significant difference in power between Cartun and the escort knights, and they had no choice but to observe.

The guidance on how to use the Vibration Sword in Darm was progressing unexpectedly smoothly.

The reason was that the King of Darm had not appeared.

In anticipation of him possibly demanding to see the bestowal process or causing trouble, we had increased the number of guards at the bestowal tent compared to when we performed magic bestowal in Swied, but there were hardly any people even approaching the tent.

It seemed that, as the strange commander had mentioned earlier, the strange hostility was only harbored by the king. The knights and soldiers of Darm were welcoming me unexpectedly warmly.

Most of them didn't even know that the King of Darm had raised objections to me during the meeting. It wasn't as if I had asked everyone. However, when a knight came to greet me, he said, "It would have been great if His Majesty had come, but he had a sudden unavoidable official duty..." with an apologetic expression about the absence of the King of Darm at this event.

From that, it was speculated that everyone here might not be aware of the king's objections to me. However, the strange commander knew. That meant the king had told the commander. So maybe the king and the commander had a close relationship? Recently, there had been a change in the throne, and during the crown prince days, there were stories of him engaging in activities among the commoners. Perhaps they had formed a relationship during that time? But... even so, the king had said things that showed he had a different perspective from theirs.

"Ah, geez! I should be thinking about the upcoming battle, but these strange people have piqued my curiosity!"

Enough of this. In reality, the knights and swordsmen will be the ones participating in the battle. The king and the commander-in-chief won't directly participate. Let's be content with the fact that the military personnel are participating in training in a friendly manner. Even if there's a rift between the king and the military commander, that's another country's internal matter. If we interfere, we might be accused of meddling in their domestic affairs. Besides, it's not my place to meddle in their problems; they should solve their own country's issues.

After bestowing magic on the participants and those I'll be teaching, I was even more exhausted today because I was preoccupied with unnecessary thoughts.

"Ugh... I'm tired..."

"Th-thank you for your hard work..."

Completely drained, I emerged from the bestowal tent, and today, just like every other day, Sisily was there to greet me. Due to my heightened fatigue, she applied healing magic on me today.

Ahh... this is so soothing...

"Hmm... so this is the secret weapon for this operation..."

Cartun, the commander-in-chief of the Darm army, held the Vibrational Sword that Shin had bestowed and infused it with magic.

"I see, it's ultrasonic vibration..."

"Do you understand, Commander Cartun?"

The words muttered by Cartun piqued the interest of the escort knights.

"Ah, when you infuse magic into it, it vibrates ever so slightly, right? If you make the blade vibrate like this, its cutting ability becomes exceptionally good."

"I see..."

The escort knights wore subtle expressions of understanding and confusion.

"Well, it's okay if you don't fully get it. The real question is, how is this bestowal done?"

"Don't you know either, Commander?"

"When trying to bestow this effect, no matter how many character limits I have, it's never enough. This is simply an impossible bestowal."

"But... it has been bestowed in practice... Is it because His Eminence is a genius?"

In this heavily religious country, many refer to Shin as "His Eminence." The escort knight who tried to brush Shin off with the label of a genius provoked Cartun to silently curse them in his mind. However, even Cartun had no idea about the method of bestowal.

"Geez... it's like cheating for real..."

Cartun could understand the logic behind it. But he didn't know the method of bestowal. Yet, it was being done in practice.

This made Cartun suspicious, thinking there might be some kind of illicit cheat involved. However, in a world without stats or skills, he knew that there was no room for cheating. Cartun was increasingly baffled by how this bestowal was happening.

However, feeling the gap between what was happening with the bestowal and his own capabilities, Cartun frowned. Although he had approached Shin with a smile for his own purposes, deep down, he disliked Shin quite a bit.

Frustrated by the seemingly unfair difference between himself and Shin, Cartun muttered quietly, almost inaudibly to the escort knights, "Why does it always have to be him...? It's just not fair..."
