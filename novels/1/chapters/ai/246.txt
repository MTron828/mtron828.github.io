 fun activities
to do indoors with my high-energy dog

"Wow, is that so?"

In general, weekends that become holidays for the public are also our Ultimate Magicians' days off.

If even one of us works, the office staff can't take a break.

So, we all have our days off together.

In the morning, I played with Silver at home and spent some intimate time with Sicily, and then came to the Bean Workshop.

The dismantling of the car brought from the Quanlong's pre-civilization ruins is done, and currently, they are in the middle of various trials to see how much they can reproduce with current technology.

Since these are just prototypes, they can't be made during regular business hours, so Mark's father and some free artisans make them on their days off.

I came to check on that, but since we have time until the prototypes arrive, I'm having a casual conversation with Mark.

"Sicily and the priestess who work at the clinic, and the healing magicians, they're really amazing. It's not about the technology; their hearts are much stronger than mine."

"Come to think of it, the people at the clinic, not just the priestess but also the nurses, are strong, or rather, scary. It seems like you can't survive if you're weak-willed."

"Yeah, maybe you have to become emotionally stronger to keep going."

"That's true. By the way, Walford-kun."

"Hm?"

"Why are you tampering with a citizen card?"

We're having a casual conversation with Mark while waiting for the prototypes to be completed, but I was a little bored, so I had something I wanted to check and was fiddling with the citizen card.

"Hey, you know this, right? It can't be activated by anyone other than the first person registered, can it?"

"Of course, that's how it is."

"Why?"

"Why, you... Are you trying to analyze the citizen card, Walford-kun?"

"Oh, you figured it out?"

"I figured it out! In fact, no one has been able to do it, but modifying a citizen card is a crime!"

Before, out of curiosity, when I saw the granted characters attached to the citizen card, I was shocked that they were in Japanese, and I didn't even look at the content of the granted characters because I found a hint that could solve the problem I had at that time.

Just a while ago, I suddenly remembered that.

"No, no, I'm not trying to modify it. I just wanted to see what the content of the granted characters is."

This also serves as a bank cash card.

Originally, rewriting granted magic seems to be something only I can do, and the sight of granted characters appearing is probably unusual.

"Walford-kun, what does it say?"

Despite all the talk, Mark seems quite intrigued as well.

I translated the characters into the local language on the paper.

"Huh? Does this tiny bit of text make sense like this?"

"It's quite mysterious."

After all, there are characters in this world that convey meaning with just a single character. Even if the stroke count is high, they are considered single characters.

While I was translating, I came across a word that caught my attention. I stopped my hand from writing on the paper and stared at that word.

"Walford-kun, what's wrong?"

"Did you write something strange?"

Startled by their voices, I snapped back to reality.

"Oh, no. It's just that there was a word I've never heard before."

I said this and wrote down the translated word on the paper.

Seeing it, the two of them also froze, just like me.

"Huh? What does it mean?"

"Magic Crest?"

Yes, the reason I stopped my hand was because of the word Yuri murmured. What is a "Magic Crest"?

"Hey, did we ever learn about Magic Crests in our magic academy classes? Or maybe in intermediate school?"

I asked, but judging by the reactions of Mark and Yuri, it seemed highly unlikely.

"No, I've never heard of it."

"Me neither."

So, this "Magic Crest" seems to be outside common knowledge.

Magic Crest... a symbol of magic? No, wait.

"Is it something like fingerprints or voiceprints?"

I muttered, and Mark and Yuri had startled expressions.

"I don't know what a voiceprint is, but I understand fingerprints!"

"Right, fingerprints are the traces used in criminal investigations."

Oh, so fingerprints exist, but voiceprints might not be widely known yet.

"Voiceprints are similar to fingerprints. They are used to identify individuals. And the reason I wanted to investigate this was..."

"How they identify individual magic, right?"

"Eh, eh, could it be, Walford-kun, did you just make a major discovery?"

That's possible.

"This citizen card responds to an individual's magic and activates accordingly. It can't be activated by anyone other than the first person registered. In other words..."

"Do humans have their own unique magic crest?"

"That's the only explanation, and if that's the case, everything makes sense."

"Exactly! This is a huge discovery!"

"Oh, does that mean the defeated monsters are being counted because the system detects their specific magic as well?"

With Mark's words, I examined the characters granted on my citizen card once again.

"Hmm? 'Connection'? 'List Quotation'?"

This...

"It's possible that the citizen card reading device or the granting device has a database of monster magic. It could reference the list and record it on the citizen card..."

I couldn't think of any other explanation. The "list" is probably a reference to a database.

I don't know if it's in the citizen card reading device or the granting device, but could they have registered the unique magic crests of monsters there?

Then, when you defeat a monster while holding the citizen card, it may be considered as such because the nearby magic disappears.

And by cross-referencing the database, the defeated monsters are counted on the citizen card.

"Oh man... Masita is really a genius..."

Maybe Masita's past life was an engineer or something.

When I thought of magic communication, I only considered telephones. But Masita used it for database access.

"It's amazing when you think about it..."

"Yeah, I mean, only Walford-kun can modify it, right?"

To Yuri's casually spoken words, I shook my head.

"I can't even do it. I have no idea how to tinker with such precise granting."

At my words, the two of them gasped.

"Seriously?"

"No way."

"Unfortunately, it's true. When I see something like this, I realize how much of an ordinary person I really am."

As I said this, now both of them looked at me with disbelief.

"Walford-kun, calling yourself ordinary..."

"That's right. You must never say that to anyone else, okay?"

"But still..."

My knowledge is only at a superficial level. I can't compare to professionals. Whether it's airships or the automobiles they're trying to build now, they all seem like things experts would scoff at and wonder why they're making such things.

"Well, anyway, it's the magic crest, right? Is there really a variation in magical crests among individuals?"

"That's right. But if the citizen card is indeed recognizing individuals through their magic, then it might be true, right?"

"But if that's the case, what about monsters? Would they be recognized as the same monster no matter which one you defeat?"

I think Mark's opinion is correct.

As for Yuri's question, we won't know until we investigate it. Perhaps there are species-specific magical patterns?

The three of us discussed various possibilities, but we couldn't reach a definite conclusion.

"Ah, it would be nice to confirm what the magic crest looks like in practice."

Yuri's words made me realize something.

"That's right. We should start by checking what the magic crest looks like, right?"

With that in mind, we decided to try various experiments.

I tried infusing magic into a basin of water, but all it did was create ripples on the water's surface, making it impossible to detect any individual differences.

Next, I tried it with industrial oil, but the results were the same.

Similarly, I experimented with various liquid substances, but none of them worked.

"Ugh... What should we do about this?"

"How did Masita appraise the magic crests?"

"Hey, Walford-kun, wasn't it mentioned in Masita's notes you talked about before?"

"Well, those were more like diaries than research papers, so they didn't have much on magical instruments."

"I see..."

We hit a dead end. I couldn't think of anything else and ended up slumping over the table.

"Oh, Walford-kun. This is a worktable, so if you lean on it, you'll get materials and dust on your clothes."

"What!? Oh no!"

At Mark's comment, I instinctively raised my upper body from the table and checked my sleeves.

"Oh, there's dust on them..."

As Mark had pointed out, the material dust from the table had clung to my clothes.

"Ugh, I'm really in a bind..."

At that moment, I remembered something.

It was about Kwanglun.

In Kwanglun, magical instruments called "charms" had developed as an alternative to magic. These charms were created by mixing magical stone powder with ink and writing symbols with it.

"...Magical stone powder."

"Huh?"

My mutterings drew reactions from Mark and Yuri.

"That's right. Since we're examining the shape of magic, it's pointless if it doesn't transmit magic. Magic stones are condensed magic, so if we turn them into powder..."

When I said that, Yuri cautiously expressed her opinion.

"But... but inhaling magic stone powder can turn you into a demon, right? Isn't it dangerous?"

"...In that case, how about dissolving it in water?"

"Even then, there's a risk of accidentally ingesting it."

Mark's point was valid. So, what should we do?

"Oh, Mark, do you have two pieces of transparent glass?"

"I do."

"Could you bring them here for a moment?"

"Sure."

With that, Mark left the room.

"Now, in the meantime..."

While Mark went to fetch the glass, I gathered magic and created a small magic stone.

"...I still can't believe this sight, it's truly unbelievable."

The sight of a magic stone being created right before her eyes was still hard for Yuri to believe since the generation of magic stones had been a mystery for years.

Now...

"I've brought them, Walford-kun."

As soon as the magic stone was ready, Mark returned with two smartphone-sized pieces of glass.

"Mark, do you have, like, a transparent box or something where you can stick your arm in to work?"

"We do. It's used when processing small and lightweight parts. It's designed to prevent them from flying away due to the airflow in the room or your own breath."

"That's the one!"

If no outside air can get in, that means nothing from inside can leak out.

"I'm sorry, but can I use it?"

"Sure, you'll be using it to carve the magic stone, right?"

"Yes."

Mark understood my intention, and he immediately allowed me to use the tool.

"Now, when using the tool, some of its fragments might mix in, so should I do it with magic?"

I placed the magic stone in the transparent box, inserted both hands through the rubberized holes, and then used levitation magic in my left hand to lift the magic stone. With the tip of my right index finger, I created a tiny vortex of air.

It was rotating rapidly, and as I brought it closer to the magic stone, it began to shave off tiny pieces.

"Oh... huh? It's not scattering as much as I expected."

"Huh? Could it be... you're using three spells simultaneously?"

"Yes."

To ensure that the left hand's levitation magic and the right hand's vortex of air, along with the magic stone dust, didn't scatter, I enveloped the surroundings with a membrane of air.

Like this, I shaved the magic stone, and within a few minutes, I turned it all into powder.

"Now, the next step is to dissolve this in water."

I transferred all the magic stone powder to a glass dish and began adding it to the water bit by bit.

"Alright, it's done. Now, with these..."

I looked at the two glass plates that Mark had brought.

"We'll sandwich it with these."

"Sandwich?"

While the two of them were tilting their heads in confusion, I dribbled a few drops of the magic stone water solution onto one of the glass plates Mark had brought and then used the other one to sandwich it.

"A little more..."

Since the magic stone water solution didn't spread evenly throughout, I added a few more drops and sandwiched it again.

"Alright, I think it's spread evenly now."

Once I confirmed that, I promptly flowed my magic into the glass sandwiching the magic stone water solution.

And then...

"Wow!"

"For real!?"

The magic stone water solution sandwiched between the glass plates reacted to my magic and created ripples.

When I stopped emitting magic, the ripples disappeared after a while.

"One more time."

Releasing my magic again, the exact same ripples as before appeared on the glass surface.

"Mark, Yuri, you guys should try it too!"

As I said that, Mark was the first to emit his magic.

In response, a different set of ripples from mine emerged.

"Stop the magic release once the ripples disappear, and then try it again."

"Okay!"

They stopped their magic release and, once the ripples disappeared, emitted their magic again. Once more, the same set of ripples, different from mine, appeared.

"Next, it's my turn."

Yuri took her turn, replacing Mark, and did the same thing.

The result was... ripples that were different from both mine and Mark's but consistent in shape appeared twice.

When we confirmed this, all three of us experienced the thrill of discovery.

"We've found it... this is the magic pattern!"

It was the moment when we rediscovered the concept of magic patterns, which hadn't been passed on to anyone since Massita. a code snippet
