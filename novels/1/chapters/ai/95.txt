"Alice said to Princess Mei, 'Princess Mei's magical dress is so cute.'"

Alice and her companions were in a barren wilderness where not a single tree or blade of grass grew, a place Shin had taught them about. Permission was required to use the academy's practice grounds, and most importantly, in this place, they could use large-scale magic without inconveniencing anyone around.

Therefore, the members of the Ultimate Magicians usually came to this wilderness for magical practice.

Today, Princess Mei of Earlsheid, who was only ten years old, had also joined them. During the summer training camp, her potential as a magician had been revealed, and since then, she had been diligently practicing magic control, aiming to become like her older brothers. As a result, she had learned to use extradimensional storage and was now looking to learn offensive magic.

However, even in the case of Shin, it was unusual for someone of Mei's age to have such proficiency in magic. Those around Mei unanimously agreed that it might be too early to teach her offensive magic, and since the Ultimate Magicians' training camp had concluded, she had not yet received any instruction.

Feeling dissatisfied with this, Mei had asked Alice, who had become her good friend among the Ultimate Magicians, to take her to this place through a gate. She hadn't asked Shin, as he always seemed busy, and she didn't want to bother him.

Alice, who appeared to have some free time, was well-suited for the task. She had also worn the magical dress that Shin had made for her when practicing magic.

Mei said, "Certainly, it's cuter than our combat attire. Our attire is designed for practicality."

In this gathering, Lynn, who had been paired with Alice frequently lately, was also present. It seemed that Lynn, too, found Mei's magical dress cute.

Mei proudly showed her dress to the two of them and said, "Yes! I said I wanted something cute, and my big brother Shin made it for me!"

The dress was a bright yellow, seemingly designed to match her hair color, with numerous frills and an exceptionally cute design. It would undoubtedly stand out on the battlefield. Although Mei would never go to a battlefield, Shin had presented her with this dress, emphasizing its cuteness.

"For Mei, Shin is not a romantic interest.

Shin is just a kind, not unkind, older brother.

In that sense, Mei adores her big brother and was delighted that he made a cute outfit for her.

Watching Mei so cheerful, Alice and Lynn were somewhat puzzled.

"You know, Shin is kind of strange. He doesn't seem to know common sense but can make cute clothes like Princess Mei's magical dress or cool clothes like ours."

"That's true. But this magical dress has a design like nothing I've ever seen before. It might be because he came up with it precisely because he doesn't know common sense."

"Oh, that could be it."

After that conversation, the three of them began practicing magic.

The two Ultimate Magicians used the 'process' of magic they had learned from Shin and cast spells while visualizing it. As Mei couldn't get instructions from Shin due to Auguste's strict orders, she cast her magic while visualizing the 'result' after watching the two of them. Mei, who had never used attack magic before, released one attack spell after another.

"Wow, Mei, you're amazing. Have you already become so good with magic?"

"Yeah, amazing. Mei might be a genius."

"Huh? Hehe, really?"

Today, they had sneaked out and brought Mei secretly, so there were no guards or attendants. The compliments from attendants often came because of her being a princess. However, the two in front of her were both her brothers. Auguste, who was also the crown prince, was not intimidated by them. If such people complimented her, it wasn't flattery. Mei felt embarrassed.

"I'd like to try some real combat after a bit more practice."

"You can't take her to a place with monsters. We might get severely punished."

"Oh no, that's a big no!"

To be honest, bringing a royal family member to a place like this without permission was a problem in itself. But for the two watching Auguste's freedom, taking her to a safe place was not something they had even dreamed could be a problem. However, they knew it would definitely be wrong to take her along for monster subjugation."

"Even if they return safely, taking her to a place with any hint of danger could lead to punishment. However, from my own experience, I know that real combat can significantly boost one's growth. While continuing to practice magic, Alice wondered about what to do.

"Well then, Princess Mei. I'll come to pick you up the next time."

"Thank you for your hard work."

"Yes! See you next time!"

After delivering Mei to the royal palace, Alice and Lynn reopened the gate and left Mei's room behind.

"Real combat, huh? What should we do?"

"It's a waste not to use magic when she can use it so well."

"You're right."

The two were at Lynn's house. There was a magic practice area here, making it the perfect place for impromptu magical training sessions. That's why Alice often visited Lynn's house.

"Isn't there a way to experience real combat without any danger?"

"There's nothing that convenient."

"I know..."

While drinking juice provided by Lynn's mother, Alice pondered Mei's upbringing. Normally, Alice wouldn't need to worry about Mei's upbringing. However, she wanted to be involved in the growth of the younger one who had grown fond of them. Although she was in the role of a troublemaker within the Ultimate Magicians, she probably wanted to be like an older sister to Mei, despite their similar appearances. While Alice and Lynn were troubled together, Lynn's father returned.

"Oh, Alice, welcome."

"Oh, I'm sorry for intruding."

"Just make sure not to be too late... Oh, Alice, you'll be fine, won't you?"

"Well, I'll be using the gate to get back, so it's all right."

"No, it's not about that..."

"Dad, what's going on?"

Lynn sensed that something was different with her father, whose behavior was unusual.

"Hmm? Well, no..."

"Something seems off. Did something happen at work?"

Lynn's father was a court magician, primarily tasked with guarding the royal palace and the capital as part of the Magician Corps. Ensuring the nation's security through magic was his duty, and he did not participate in the recent operation. Lynn, sensing something unusual in her father's behavior, asked if something had happened.

"Well, maybe... I should talk to you about it."

"What's going on?"

"It's not exactly what's going on, but there has been an increase in incidents like assault and violence in the capital recently. So, be careful when you're out in the city."

"I can handle common street thugs."

"Haha. There's no doubt that you, Alice, and Lynn now wouldn't have anyone who could match you. However, there's still the possibility of getting involved."

Certainly, Alice and Lynn wouldn't be harmed by common street thugs. However, it couldn't be guaranteed that there wouldn't be any trouble arising from such encounters.

"So, both you, Lynn, and Alice, should be careful. Well, I don't think you'll be out and about much."

"Well, but why did the security suddenly get worse?"

"It's not that security has deteriorated suddenly. The number of incidents has been increasing recently."

In the capital of Arlsheid, there had been a growing number of incidents, including assaults, in recent times. It was no longer just the naturally aggressive hunters who were involved, but also ordinary citizens. Fortunately, the capital hadn't become a lawless city overrun by criminals. However, the increase in the number of incidents couldn't be ignored.

"I see. I wonder if there's something behind this."

"Who knows? His Highness or Mr. Wolford might be able to figure something out."

"We wouldn't have a clue."

"It's best to leave that kind of thing to people who can handle it."

"Yeah, I guess you're right. All we can do is... Oh!"

"What? Alice."

"This!"

Alice, who seemed to have come up with something, caught Lynn's attention.

"Hey! Shin-kun!"

The new year had come, and the students were finally reunited at the Magic Academy.

The entire Year 1 Class S used the gate to get to school, so Alice also arrived at school through the gate. As soon as she arrived, she called out to Shin, who was already there.

"Hey, good morning. You're not wearing pajamas today."

"I won't go through that embarrassing ordeal again! But more importantly, I have a favor to ask of you, Shin."

"What is it? Please, go ahead."

"The magical outfit you made for Princess Mei, can you make one for me and Lynn too?"

"Sure, but why?"

Alice and Lynn already had combat outfits as Ultimate Magicians. So Shin was curious why Alice wanted a non-combat magical outfit like the one made for Mei.

"Um, well, Mei-hime's magical outfit is so cute! We want one too."

In reality, Alice and Lynn were secretly taking Mei out for magic practice. Since August was present at this moment, Alice chose her words carefully.

"Oh, I see. But would you like the design to be the same? What about the color?"

"Same design, just different colors, please."

"Alright. So, Mei-chan has yellow, Alice in red, and Lynn in blue, is that okay?"

"Yes! That's perfect!"

"Alice, what's been going on with you since yesterday?"

"Yesterday, you thought of something, and you've been in such a good mood. Have you not heard from Alice?"

"Nope."

"Nishi, I'll tell you later!"

With Alice looking unusually cheerful, Lynn and Shin exchanged glances.

After the classroom lessons, which were still mostly theoretical and seemed more like philosophy than anything else, ended, it was time for afterschool activities. In the past, they would have been part of the Ultimate Magic Research Society, but now, as the Ultimate Magicians who had gained plenty of practical experience, they spent their time fine-tuning their skills through practical combat rather than learning new magic from Shin.

The reason for this was that among the magic Shin was using, there were an increasing number of spells that couldn't be understood even with explanations. Gravity manipulation and optical camouflage were among them. They had made efforts to understand them, but the development of magic instead of science in this world meant that Shin's explanations couldn't be comprehended. They managed to learn Gate magic, but everything else was beyond their grasp.

So, they decided it was better to improve what they could do rather than wasting time on things they couldn't. Shin focused on inventing new things in the Bean Workshop, Sisi helped out in the infirmary before undergoing bride training at the Wolford residence. Maria went monster hunting with Miranda. Mark stayed with Shin in the workshop, and Olivia helped in the shop. Tony also went hunting monsters, while August and his group returned to the castle.

In the midst of all this, Alice and Lynn headed for Mei's room in the castle.

"Ah, Alice-neechan, Lynn-neechan!"

Mei, who had already returned from the elementary school, welcomed Alice and Lynn as they appeared through the Gate. There were Mei's maids and such around, but Alice and Lynn frequently visited Mei's room through the Gate, so they were received with familiar gestures.

"Welcome, Alice-sama, Lynn-sama. Please wait for a moment while Mei-sama changes."

"Oh, it's alright, no need to be in such a hurry."

"And could you drop the 'sama'?"

"What are you saying? I cannot be so rude to the hero-sama who has saved this world multiple times."

"Hero-sama... By the way, Mei-hime-sama is half-naked, is that okay with you?"

"Eek!"

As Alice and Lynn began conversing, Mei, who was in the middle of changing from her elementary school uniform, had been left half-naked and blushed cutely.

"I apologize. Well, let's move here."

"Alright. Thank you."

Mei finished changing while sniffing back her runny nose, and the maid left the room. With only the three of them in the room, Alice made a proposal to Mei.

"Mei-hime-sama, let's make jet boots for you too!"

"Huh? Jet boots, you mean those bouncy shoes that let you jump around?"

"What do you mean? Alice."

Mei and Lynn were puzzled by Alice's suggestion, but Alice didn't immediately explain herself.

"Never mind that for now. Well then, let's go practice magic again today!"

"Yay!"

"Alice, explain later."

Mei's attention was already on the fun magic practice, but Lynn continued to press Alice for an explanation.

"Once we get there."

The three of them arrived at the usual wasteland and immediately faced Lynn's inquiry.

"Alice, something's off today. Why did you place an order for the same magical outfit as Mei-hime-sama to Wolff-kun? Why does Mei-hime-sama need to use jet boots? Explain."

Lynn, who had been feeling uneasy since morning, confronted Alice with questions.

"Hehe. Come here for a moment."

Even though they were in the wilderness with no one around, the three of them huddled together, and Alice began to speak softly and confidentially.

After hearing Alice's explanation, Lynn's eyes sparkled with a subtle understanding.

"That's good. It'll also be part of Mei-hime-sama's training."

"Whoa, is that okay? Won't it get exposed?"

Lynn was enthusiastic, but Mei became worried about getting caught.

"Hmm, I wonder if it'll get exposed?"

"Let's ask Wolff-kun. He'd probably keep it a secret."

"Actually, he'd likely be excited and willing to help!"

They decided to consult Wolff the next day, and they continued their practice of Mei's offensive magic and jet boots.

"Waaah!"

"Mei-hime-sama!"

"It's okay; I have protective magic."

As Alice watched Mei, who was flying in the wrong direction due to her jet boots, she was relieved that she had protective and healing magic.

"Shin-kun!"

"Hm? What is it, Alice? I haven't finished making those clothes you mentioned."

"No, it's not about that. I need to discuss something with you."

"A discussion?"

"Yes. Oh, Shin-kun, I'll borrow Shishily!"

"Huh? Oh, sure."

With a brief explanation to Shishily, Alice, along with Lynn, took Shin out of the classroom.

"What's this about?"

"I'm not sure."

Augusto asked, and Shishily also tilted her head.

Once they had Shin outside, Alice and Lynn explained the situation to him. After hearing everything, Shin looked intrigued.

"But won't your faces give it away? I mean, those magic outfits don't have face recognition interference magic, and I can't do that."

"Yeah, Shin-kun, it's probably impossible for you."

"Face recognition interference, isn't that a form of mental manipulation? I can't try that; it's too scary."

"But we can't risk getting exposed."

While Alice and Lynn were somewhat known, their faces weren't familiar. The issue was with Mei. As a member of the royal family and having appeared in front of the people of the Arusheid Royal Capital frequently, Mei was recognized by the capital's citizens.

As Alice and Lynn hesitated, Shin asked, "So, essentially, it's okay as long as they can't recognize your faces?"

He smiled at his own comment, which made them recall Shin's past actions and worry a bit.

After receiving the consultation from the two, Shin returned to the classroom, thinking about various things.

"Shin-kun, what was that conversation about?"

"Hm? Oh, it was about Mei-chan asking me to make her a magical outfit for her. We discussed that."

"Ah, so it wasn't some weird issue you discussed?"

"Well, you know, since they took a girl with them, I thought they might have had some concerns in that area."

"It was a discussion about that?"

"Ouch! No, it's different, don't pinch my arm!"

"Hmm."

Augusto was wary because Alice and Lynn, the recent troublemakers, had summoned Shin, and he had sworn to question him later, especially after seeing Shin flirting with Shishily.

A few days after that consultation, on a day off, Alice and Lynn were called by Shin using a wireless communication device. They went to pick up Mei before arriving in the wilderness.

"Hey, you're here, all three of you."

"Big bro Shin! Long time no see!"

Cough! "Ah, yeah, long time, Mei-chan."

Mei rushed at Shin as they met after a long time, and Shin just managed to catch her charge in time, returning the greeting. He retrieved the magical outfits for Alice and Lynn from his interdimensional storage while imagining Mei's invisible tail wagging enthusiastically.

"Wow! Thanks, Shin-kun! They're cute!"

"Yeah, they're cute. Thank you."

"You're welcome. Now, about that other thing..."

And he took out the outfits for the three of them.

"What is... this?"

"... What?"

"Huh?"

Alice pretended to be surprised, not quite understanding, while Lynn and Mei had expressions like 'What's this?' However, as they listened to Shin's explanation, their faces gradually lit up.

"That's... awesome! This is exactly what I was looking for!"

"This should keep us from getting recognized."

"Big bro Shin, thank you!"

Alice was initially not quite sure but acted surprised deliberately. However, as they listened to Shin's explanation, their expressions became more and more excited.

"Yeah, something like that. Any questions?"

"This is perfect! This is exactly what I wanted!"

"This should keep us from getting recognized."

"Big bro Shin, thank you!"

It wasn't just face-concealing but also had support functions. The three of them were thrilled, feeling like they had just received new toys.

"All right. But make sure Mei-chan doesn't get into any dangerous situations."

"Yeah, we've got it."

With those parting words, Shin left. The three left behind were in high spirits, knowing they could now act freely. They trained for a bit before returning to the royal capital.

Equipped with what Shin had given them, they activated the optical camouflage on their capes and used jet boots to move across the roofs of buildings. While using detection magic to search for something, they finally found what they were looking for.

As Alice and her group arrived, they encountered a scene where a group of hunter-like men had dragged a woman into an alley, and it appeared they were about to assault her.

"Ugh!"

"Come on! Cut it out already!"

"Screaming won't help you!"

"Help! No!"

"Hehe, give it up."

"That's enough!"

Both the men who had been excited about their actions towards the woman and the woman herself, who had become despairing due to the situation, were momentarily taken aback by the sudden intrusion.

The woman was the first to recover.

"I don't know who you are, but please help me!"

The men who seemed like hunters were also shaken by the woman's loud plea.

"Who the hell are you? Show yourself!"

"It was a woman's voice, right? Don't play games or you'll get it too! Hey, you!"

Just as the man was raising his voice, a compressed ball of wind was sent smashing into his head, sending him flying backward mid-sentence.

The other men were momentarily stunned by this sight, but they quickly regained their composure and looked in the direction from which the magic had been cast. There, they saw shadows cast from the top of a building, but there was no one there.

Panicking, they looked up to the building and saw three silhouettes with the sun at their backs.

Pointing directly at the men, the silhouettes began to speak.

"We won't let any wrongdoing go unpunished!"

"Resolving things with the power of magic!"

"Here we are!"

"Magical Girls Cutey Three!"

The three girls, dressed in red, blue, and yellow outfits, with matching helmets and shields covering their eyes like sunglasses, introduced themselves.

This scene left not only the men but also the woman who had been attacked in shock.

"Trying to force yourself on unwilling ladies, you rotten scoundrels! Cutie Red will teach you a lesson!"

"Yellow, now!"

"Yes! Take that!"

"Hebuuu!?"

Yellow released a compressed air magic similar to what was used earlier, blowing one of the men away.

This brought the men back to their senses, and they began cursing.

"You jerk! Dressing up and playing around like that!"

"You said Red, but Yellow's attacking!"

"Shooting magic from a place like that, you coward... ugh!"

Precise magical sniping from the top of a tall building.
!

It might seem unfair to some, but their opponents were criminals, and, most importantly, they couldn't allow May to be in danger.

As a result,

"Sto... stop it!"

"Quit it! Urgh!"

"Wait! Thi... th... guh!"

This was a targeted magical sniping from the top of the building. The men who had been trying to assault the woman were taken down one by one by Yellow's magic, and they were incapacitated without any fatal harm.

After landing on the ground with their jet boots from the roof, the three girls tied up the men with ropes, hung signs around their necks that read "These men are perpetrators of sexual assault," and left them in the public square. Citizens would likely report them to the city guard.

Then, they approached the woman who had been attacked. She was initially cautious about their unusual appearances, but she quickly relaxed when she realized they were girls and had saved her.

"Sister, are you alright?"

"Yes, thank you. You saved me."

"No need to thank us."

"That's right! We help people in trouble!"

"I see..."

The girls were satisfied that the woman was safe and turned to leave.

"Um, excuse me, what are your names?"

In response to the woman's question, the girls stopped, turned back, and said:

"I am Magical Girl Cutie Red!"

"Cutie Blue."

"Cut... Cutie Yellow!"

"..."

"Well then, sister, take care!"

With that, the girls activated their jet boots, leaped over a building, and disappeared.

The woman left behind couldn't quite grasp the situation.

As for these girls, it goes without saying that Red was Alice, Blue was Lin, and Yellow was May. Thanks to the helmets that Shin had created for them, their faces were well concealed, making it difficult to identify them at first glance.

These helmets also had radio communicators, allowing them to converse while swiftly moving across rooftops.

"Alright! Let's keep going and take down more and more criminals!"

"Hostile magical presence detected to the right front."

"Understood!"

With just these three open channels, they couldn't talk privately, but Shin judged that it would be fine as long as it was only the three of them.

Furthermore, these helmets also had sound collection capabilities, not letting any screams go unnoticed.

"The sound collection is too noisy."

"Yeah, let's turn it off."

"Yes, sir!"

The sound collection feature turned out to be useless.

Watching the three from high above were two people, August and Shin. They were holding their bellies and appeared to be in pain.

"Those guys... are they trying to make me laugh to death?"

"Hehe... Ahaha!"

August and Shin were both there. Shin had heard the story from Alice and, after being questioned by August, had confessed without much resistance. He realized that keeping it a secret from August was not a good idea. So, once everything was ready, they had ambushed the capital city along with August.

"Well... honestly, I was quite worried when I heard the story, but it seems like everything's fine."

"That's right. They're attacking from the tops of buildings with magical attacks, so May-chan isn't in danger."

"But still... to drag around royalty like this... I wish May had more awareness of her role as a royal."

"Coming from you, that's not very persuasive."

Shin wanted to retort with something along the lines of "You shouldn't be saying that," but Alice and the others took their next action, so he followed them.

The next target for Alice and her friends was a group of thugs who were assaulting ordinary citizens to rob them of their money. Just as before, they announced their arrival from the tops of buildings and attacked and incapacitated the man who was assaulting others.

They promptly left the scene and looked for the next one.

Shin and August, who were still watching and laughing, were somewhat calmer as it was their second time witnessing this. That's probably why Shin felt something was off.

"What could it be? I can't imagine that guy doing something this violent."

"Hmm. The citizens might be experiencing significant stress from this situation."

"I see. Maybe this is the result of pent-up anxiety about the demons."

"Most likely. We have to put an end to this as soon as possible."

"I'm counting on you, Crown Prince."

"Ugh, that sounds so distasteful."

It was clear that the recent surge in assault cases in the capital city was due to the stress experienced by the citizens, Shin and August concluded.

This was also the decision made by the higher-ups in the country.

By this point, Shin and August, after seeing that Alice and the others were with May and she wasn't in danger, had stopped their surveillance. Therefore, at this moment, Shin and his group let a certain group of people go unnoticed.

"Oh! This time, it's a group!"

"What? A conflict?"

"Yeah! Isn't it dangerous?"

"It's okay!"

Alice and her friends had already appeared at several crime scenes, either thwarting or attempting to thwart individuals with malicious intent committing assault. They were so absorbed in the exhilaration of announcing themselves and doing righteous deeds that they didn't notice something significant.

The number of incidents they were encountering was abnormally high for the capital city of Earlshide. Right now, they were solely focused on stopping the conflicts, as the clashing of multiple sources of malicious magic could pose a danger to their surroundings.

They eventually arrived at a vacant area between buildings. Several people had gathered in that open space, and the atmosphere was tense, on the brink of turning into a skirmish. The group had no unified characteristics, with men and women mixed together.

Just as a brawl was about to break out, Alice's voice was heard, causing everyone to turn toward her. In their gazes, there was no confusion at the sudden, bizarre interruption, only anger at the interference.

At first, Alice and her friends were taken aback by those stares, but they regained their composure and shouted once more.

"If you release this much magic in a group like this, you might inconvenience those around you! Disperse right now!"

In response, those who had been glaring at each other as mortal enemies just moments ago suddenly directed their hostility towards Alice and her friends.

"You're annoying! Who does this little girl think she is?"

"That's right! Don't meddle in this!"

"Exactly! You all should back off!"

"A-All right..."

One angry voice after another rose, and an atmosphere that seemed like they might attack at any moment hung in the air.

Seeing May, who had shrunk back in this atmosphere, Alice...

"You there! Don't you dare scare a little kid like that!"

Alice, furious, conjured an oversized water balloon above the agitated crowd.

"Cool off your heads!"

The water balloon dropped on the assembled individuals, and they were swallowed by it, unable to react as they were collectively shaken.

When everyone had been suitably shaken, Alice dispelled her magic. What remained was a group of people, soaked from head to toe and staggering around as if they couldn't stand straight.

The group appeared dazed and looked up at Alice in bewilderment.

"Let this be a lesson! Disband right now, alright?"

From atop the building, Alice commanded the now docile group, who nodded so obediently that they seemed nothing like the agitated bunch from earlier.

Satisfied with the scene, Alice declared, "If you try to gather and do something again, I'll come flying at you!" Then, she left the scene.

After Alice and her group departed, those who remained in the area couldn't make sense of the situation. Their confusion wasn't about who Alice and her friends were.

One person among them muttered, "What was I... trying to do in a place like this?"

It seemed like everyone present shared this sentiment. Their memories were quite vague, and it felt like the intense anger they'd been burning with just moments before was a lie.

Faced with their own unsettling behavior, the drenched group dispersed.

Watching this entire sequence, there were observers.

"Besides the Ultimate Magicians, there are others like them..."

"Completely unexpected. We didn't think they'd reverse the brainwashing on such a scale."

These observers were Zest, the head of the former Imperial intelligence agency and a close aide to Strom, and his subordinates, the Demons.

"It seems they've been defeating the individuals we brainwashed all over the place. Maybe they've realized."

"Indeed... if they've caught on, it's too dangerous to continue experimenting here."

"Although I thought that with the large population of Earlshide, we could conduct experiments without being noticed..."

"We have no choice. If they've indeed caught on, it's dangerous to stay here any longer. Let's withdraw."

"Yes, sir!"

It seems that Zest and his group were conducting some kind of experiment in the densely populated Earlshide capital.

Although it was entirely coincidental that Alice and her group defeated those who were used as subjects in the experiments, Zest's group misunderstood this as them being discovered. As a result, they stopped their experiments and left the capital. Unbeknownst to Alice and her group, they had averted a crisis in Earlshide. However, no one aside from Zest's group knows what these experiments were about.

As the holiday ended, Alice arrived at the Magic Academy. She greeted everyone cheerfully as usual, but something seemed off about her classmates.

They were all smirking.

"Huh? What's going on?"

Alice looked puzzled, and her classmates responded with surprising greetings.

"Good morning, Red."

"Good morning, Red-san."

"Go-good morning, Re-Red... Hahaha!"

When August greeted her this way, Thorin did the same, while Maria couldn't complete her greeting and burst into laughter.

"Wh-why is His Highness calling me that!?"

Alice, who had believed that her secret was safe, was shocked to learn that August knew that name. Lin, who had already been teased a lot, approached Alice somewhat exhausted.

"Alice... give it up. What happened yesterday was seen by both Shin and His Highness."

"What?! Shin!? He betrayed us!?"

"Nah, it couldn't be helped. You can't involve Mei-chan in something dangerous without notifying Aug. After all, she's part of the royal family."

"Um, I'm grateful to Shin. Thanks to him, I got to see some exciting moments."

"Ehehe... Um, yeah..."

Alice started trembling as she thought it was risky to get caught by August.

Then August, seeing Alice's reaction, told her, "Well, it's an issue taking a member of the royal family to a place like that. But, it's not my place to say anything. Mei seems to be fine and had a valuable experience. I won't blame you for that."

"Really?"

Alice, who thought she would be scolded, felt relieved at the lenient judgment.

Just then, a sudden sound.

Thud! Thud!

"Ouch!"

"Ow!"

Alice and Lin were hit on the head.

"But, keeping it a secret from me was a bad idea. Consider yourself lucky it ended like this."

"...Yes."

"I'm sorry."

Taking a member of the royal family to such a dangerous place and coming out of it relatively unscathed was truly fortunate. However, Alice couldn't help but reflect, in a different sense, that Mei might have been a bit too young for real combat.

"Hah... Corner, your way of thinking is really getting closer to Shin."

"Huh!? To Shin!? Isn't that cruel!?"

"That comment is the one that's cruel!"

And so, the activities of the mysterious magical girls who appeared in the capital came to an end in a single day. Moreover, after the appearance of these magical girls in the capital, incidents of assault visibly decreased, and they no longer had a role to play.

However, due to their sudden appearance followed by a rapid decline in the number of incidents in the capital, the mysterious magical girls became a topic of conversation not only among the common people but also among the upper echelons of the kingdom.

But after that, the magical girls vanished completely, gradually fading from the memories of the people. And because of this magical girl commotion, the upper echelons of Earlshide never uncovered the truth behind the increase in assaults and injuries during that period.
