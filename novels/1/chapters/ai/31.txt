"Nevertheless, Wolfford's sword is quite impressive."

"Yes, I was surprised. I had thought it was just some feeble wizard's sword."

"Did you learn that from the Wise One?"

"No, it was impossible to learn it from my grandpa, so Michelle taught me how to use a sword."

"No way! The Sword Saint!?"

"What? Is that true, Wolfford?"

"Ugh, I'm jealous..."

After helping them with the monsters, the attitudes of Kraus and his group had softened considerably.

They could now chat casually on their journey. That was fine, but...

"Oh, I sense monster activity ahead. Everyone, get ready."

"Alright, Cecily, stay behind me."

"What are you talking about? I'll protect Cecily!"

"I won't let anyone lay a finger on Cecily!"

"Oh, um! It's okay, really!"

...Every time monsters appeared, it had become Cecily, Cecily, Cecily, without them realizing it.

Their teamwork was working well so far. They would cast spells and stop the enemy's movements with damage, then finish them off with swords.

The training for teamwork was going well. It was going well, but...

"Cecily, are you okay?"

"Are you hurt, Cecily?"

"I'm the one protecting her, I won't let her get hurt. Right, Cecily?"

"Um, well..."

They would fuss over Cecily at every opportunity, and Cecily was at a loss for what to do.

This wasn't limited to just battles; it happened when they had to push through thickets.

"Cecily, be careful."

When they had to climb over fallen trees.

"Here, Cecily, take my hand."

After walking a bit.

"Cecily, are you tired?"

"Uh, I'm really okay."

Cecily, Cecily, they were getting too familiar with her!

"Shin."

"Huh?"

"Aren't you irritated anymore?"

"It's not like I'm irritated..."

"You are. If you're so irritated, why don't you just say, 'Cecily is mine, so don't touch her'?"

"What are you talking about!"

"If it doesn't concern you, there's no need to be irritated."

"..."

"Well, Cecily is also a bit hesitant, so there's no problem. It's just that someone inexperienced with women thought she might have feelings because she was treated kindly."

"Hey, you guys, another group of monsters is coming, prepare yourselves!"

Seems like they missed the monsters due to irritation.

...No, it's not like I'm irritated... Oh! Damn it! I'm definitely irritated!

I tighten my focus and cast a scouting spell.

There's definitely a monster reaction coming from the right side, and this time, it's a group. There's quite a few of them.

"Zig, isn't the number a bit high?"

"Yeah, this might be a bit problematic."

"Are there really that many of them?"

"Cecily, stay behind us."

"Um, I also need to practice fighting..."

"Just stay behind, and let me protect you, my lady."

"No, I mean, that's why I'm here for training..."

Even at a time like this, are they acting like knights protecting a princess?

...Oh, they are knight trainees... I can't believe I'm doing something so ridiculous. Huh?

"Wait a moment, there's another reaction ahead of the monsters."

"Hmm? Oh, you're right. Could they be chased by the monsters?"

It seems that Aug also confirmed it with a scouting spell, and their observations are likely correct. After a while, another group emerged from among the trees.

"Oh! Zig-senpai! Chris-sama! Please run away!"

"Chris-sama, Zig-san! It's a dire situation! A large number of monsters are spawning and coming this way!"

The two instructors reported to the other instructors. The students from both academies who were being trained were out of breath.

"How big is the group?"

"There are at least a hundred!"

"A hundred...!?"

"What!?"

It seems to be quite a large group of monsters.

"Zig, can I take care of this?"

"...Yeah, can I ask you to do it?"

"S-So, Zigfried-sama! Can Shin-kun really handle a hundred monsters all by himself?"

"Just leave it to Shin, Cecily."

"To be honest, he's even stronger than us... Is there even a point to participating in this training?"

"Hey! You guys sitting there, move to the back! You'll get in Shin's way!"

Zig and Chris ushered everyone to the back. Then, a horde of monsters came into view from the depths of the forest.

I'm a bit irritated, so I'll let off some steam!

There were wild boars, wolves, and even bears among them.

"S-Shin-kun, is this...?"

The monsters are getting closer, but our magic is ready. Sorry, but I'm blowing them all away!

And then, I release the completed explosion spell.

...Oh, I messed up the intensity because of my irritation.

I quickly deploy a "double" barrier.

BOOOOOOOM!!!

A loud explosion spread out, and when the dust cleared, all the monsters in front of me had been blown away.

...Ah, I seem to have opened up quite an area in front of me.

Just to be sure, I cast a scouting spell to see if any monsters are left.

...Yeah, they're all wiped out.

"Shin-kun!"

Cecily ran over as usual and started patting me on the body again.

"You saw, right? I'm not injured or anything."

"Really? Even though you used such an amazing magic, you managed to protect yourself from the blast?"

"The blast didn't reach over there, did it?"

"We were quite far behind, weren't we? Shin-kun was right in front, and this..."

Cecily looked behind me.

"Even though you used such an incredibly powerful magic that could blow away everything in this area!"

...Maybe I overdid it... As far as I can see, the trees have been knocked down, and only the area where I deployed the barrier is left with oddly standing trees. I've caused quite a bit of deforestation.

Beyond that, everyone who had "evacuated" was standing there in amazement.

"Are you really not injured anywhere?"

"Yeah, I'm fine. Sorry for making you worry."

"It's true! Shin-kun, you're pushing yourself too hard! Think about those of us who are worried..."

"...I'm really sorry."

As I approached Cecily while she scolded me, everyone who had been dumbfounded finally started talking.

"What... What is this!?"

"Is this... different from what we saw earlier?"

"Why is someone like him even participating in this training?"

Aug, Maria, Zig, and Chris, aside from those four, people who had never seen my magic before, were muttering.

"Is it just me, or is this even more incredible than when we saw it before?"

"He must have held back a lot back then."

"It's still reckless and extreme..."

"Well, he's Shin."

Even the opinions of people I know are heartless.

"Uh, more importantly, why did this happen?"

"Yeah, that's right. Emily, what's going on?"

Zig-senpai asked Emily, who seemed to be another instructor from a different team.

"Oh, we were training in a shallower area. We ventured a bit deeper because it seemed possible. Then suddenly, a large number of monsters poured in from outside the detection range of our scouting magic..."

"They closed in within visual distance in an instant."

Suddenly from outside the detection range... That means...

"Zig-senpai, there's something in the deeper part."

"Yeah, no doubt about it. And there are even some large, bear-like creatures mixed in. This doesn't bode well..."

Zig-senpai suddenly cut off his words. It's also affecting my scouting magic.

"No... this can't be... can it?"

"What is this!?"

A student from another team at the Magic Academy screamed.

The Knight Academy students, who couldn't use scouting magic, were just bewildered.

"What's happening? Can you at least explain it to us?"

"Zig, could it be..."

"Yeah, it's the worst-case scenario."

"What?! We need to retreat quickly!"

"It's already too late!"

Zig-senpai's shout and the appearance of "it" happened simultaneously.

What was there was... a monster, transformed into a tiger, about five meters in size.

"A tiger... monster..."

"I-is this for real?"

"N-no, I don't want to die!"

Everyone had expressions of despair.

"Cecily! Come over here!"

Kraus tried to pull Cecily away from the group.

"Let go!"

"Cecily! What are you saying? Run away quickly!"

"If you're running, please go ahead without me. I will... stay."

"What?! What are you saying!"

"If Shin gets injured, I will stay to help him."

"You're being foolish! It's a disaster-class opponent! Can Wolfford even defeat it!?"

"Those who don't know Shin-kun, please be quiet!"

Cecily raised her voice unusually.

"Yeah, that's right. It's no big deal for Shin."

"I remember he said something like 'stronger than a tiger monster but weak to a ridiculous extent' about a demon a while back..."

"I heard the same reaction from people in the past."

"...It seems the trauma from past tiger monster encounters has made me lose my composure..."

Chris-neechan also has a trauma related to tiger monsters. Or is it about time for her to back off?

"So, that's why all of you 'evacuate' again!"

"Come on, let's go quickly. Shin is currently restraining the tiger with his magic power."

"Christina-sama! If Wolfford is going to handle it, I will too!"

"No, it's not possible. Even with Zig and me, we would only be a burden. Are you stronger than me? Certainly not."

"Well, no, but..."

"In that case, we'll go."

Kraus seemed like he wanted to stay, but he was finally convinced by Chris-neechan to evacuate.

"Shin-kun."

"Hmm?"

"Don't do anything reckless, okay?"

"Yeah, I'll take care of it quickly, so just wait."

"Yes, I'll be waiting."

Saying that, Cecily also joined the others in the back.

Now, both the tiger and lion monsters are classified as disaster-class.

Lions are slower than tigers, but they have incredible power.

Tigers may be less powerful than lions, but their speed is incredible. So, the way to defeat a tiger is...

I release the magic power I've been using to immobilize it all this time and cast body enhancement magic. It not only strengthens my muscles but also my bones.

Finally freed from the magical restraint, the tiger raises an angry roar at the one who was holding it down.

"Groooooaaaarrrr!"

And it charges towards me...

"Shut up, you noisy giant cat!"

Boosted by the body enhancement, I leap forward and deliver a powerful knee kick under the tiger's jaw.

"Gaaaaaaah!"

The tiger, hit under the jaw, somersaults backward and lands straight on its feet.

Huh? It seems like the impact didn't do much damage.

Oh, wait, that's not the case. The tiger's legs are shaking. I just countered its momentum head-on.

When fighting a tiger monster, it's better to use physical attacks with body enhancement rather than casting magic. It's agile enough to dodge spells. Lions are the opposite.

Now, let's finish it off quickly. I approach the tiger with my Vibration Sword, and the tiger, which had been growling in intimidation, looks at everyone behind me.

And it must have felt easier to deal with me, as it tried to go around me towards everyone...

"I'm not gonna let that happen!"

As soon as I understood the tiger's intent from its gaze, I quickly caught up to it, jumped on its back, and beheaded it with the Vibration Sword.

It was about half the distance to everyone, right? It seemed like it was heading towards them, but this way, I wouldn't endanger them.

I didn't do anything reckless, and it seemed like a job well done, but when I went back to everyone, they still looked bewildered. Why?

"Shin-kun... Can I ask you something?"

"Sure, what is it?"

"Do you always defeat tiger monsters like that?"

"Yeah, that's right. Tigers are so fast, so it's more efficient to enhance your body and defeat them with physical attacks."

"I see... even with a knee kick?"

As Cecily asked that, everyone else began talking.

"A knee kick..."

"That was a bit much..."

"That huge tiger did a somersault..."

"What can I say, this is..."

"It was insane, right?"

Wait, the knee kick wasn't good enough!?

Cautiously looking at Cecily, I noticed she had puffed up her cheeks.

"Geez! I told you not to do anything reckless!"

"Oops! I didn't think the knee kick was reckless!"

"Even though I trust Shin-kun... when you charged at the tiger monster, it felt like my heart stopped..."

Cecily seemed like she was about to cry.

"I'm sorry for making you worry again..."

"I'm really relieved that you're safe..."

"Yeah..."

"Oh, right!"

"Hmm?"

"Welcome back, Shin-kun, and thank you for helping us."

Saying that, she smiled warmly.

"Yeah, I'm back."

"Also, thank you for saving us."

"You're welcome."

I put my hand on my chest, acted proudly, and bowed my head.

Then, we looked at each other and smiled.

"Hey, Maria-chan, are you with these guys?"

"Well... it's not official yet..."

"Really!?"

"Yes, really."

"I can't believe it."

"You should just get together already!"

The spectators were so noisy!
