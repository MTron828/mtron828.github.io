 some names
for my cafe-by-day, bar-by-night business

Sylvester was immediately perplexed when he arrived at school and found himself in this situation, so he could only manage a wry smile.

It would have been good if someone had casually apologized and left, but Allen was standing tall next to Sylvester, glaring at them, so Sylvester had to keep his head down until he received permission.

Sylvester was troubled about what to do, but he decided that he couldn't let it continue without saying something. So, he finally mustered the courage to speak.

"Um... I don't really mind anymore, so it's fine."

"Really?"

"Yeah. So, you can raise your head now. And Allen, don't glare so much."

Sylvester addressed his classmates who were still bowing and convinced them to raise their heads. Then, he also spoke to Allen, who had been glaring beside him.

Allen responded to Sylvester with a stern face. "Are you sure that's okay?"

"Sure, I was shocked yesterday, but we've resolved that issue, and it's kind of unfair to keep blaming me for it, right?"

Upon hearing Sylvester's words, Allen let out a long sigh. "Well, if you're okay with it..."

"Yeah, thanks, Allen."

"No problem. But you guys..."

"Yes!"

The classmates who were spoken to by Allen, with cold gazes from someone of higher standing than them, responded stiffly while secretly trembling inside.

"Sylvier says he forgives you, so we won't pursue this any further. But your way of thinking isn't suitable for the Aristide noble family... You understand, right? There won't be a second chance."

"Yes, yes!"

"Enough. Disperse."

"Yes!"

The stern look from Allen, the eldest son of the Marquis family, during his education, was not the gaze of a six-year-old boy in his first year of elementary school. The classmates quickly dispersed according to Allen's instructions.

As Allen observed this, he turned his attention back to Sylvester.

"Sylvier, are you really okay with forgiving them so easily?"

"Yeah, it's fine. Besides, I'm okay with what happened yesterday. I told my parents the truth."

Upon hearing this, Allen's previously displeased expression was replaced by curiosity.

"Does that mean you heard the story directly from the person involved!?"

"Um, yeah. That's what happened... By the way, did you know that I'm an adopted child of the Wolford family?"

"Yeah, it's a well-known story."

"I see, I guess that's the case."

In the world, it's well-known that Sylvester is the adopted child of the Shins... but hearing it from Allen's casual remark made it undeniable.

"I had no idea."

"Oh, by the way, you mentioned you've never read the story of the Shins."

(What!?)

Classmates who were eavesdropping on their conversation couldn't believe their ears. The fact that the son of the people involved had never read the story they had been reading as a matter of course since childhood was inconceivable.

At that moment, the hearts of the classmates joined as one.

"But I can understand what your parents were saying. There's a story about me as a baby, right?"

"Huh? Oh, yes, you do appear in the later part of the story. The story about the only surviving boy in the Demon Territory, whose mother entrusted the baby to the Shins."

"I guess I wouldn't want to show the part where I appear to others..."

Sylvester said this while looking at Allen.

Naturally, Allen and the classmates had read that book thoroughly.

When they found out that Sylvester was in the same class as them, they secretly felt excited because he was the boy from that story.

By the way, Allen was one of them as well.

A few days ago, when Allen and Cresta came to play, they had told Sylvester that everyone had read the book, so Sylvester, though embarrassed, had given up.

"Yesterday, I heard about what happened back then from my dad."

As Sylvester said this, the classmates who were eavesdropping leaned in towards Sylvester and Allen. Everyone was filled with curiosity.

"My birth mother protected me with her life. She entrusted me to my parents and asked them to take care of me. So, I'm not just some adopted child. My dad and mom told me that I'm their real child."

Sylvester said this without any hint of forcing himself, and it finally brought genuine relief to Allen.

Feeling relieved, Allen closely observed Sylvester's demeanor.

In just one day, Sylvester's aura seemed to have matured slightly.

In fact, the girls in the class were quite captivated by this new Sylvester.

For them, it was old news, and it wasn't their business, but for the person involved, it was a different story.

Sylvester, who had overcome that, seemed to have grown significantly in maturity.

"But still, Shinsama is amazing. He can easily help Sylvier recover."

"Yeah, Dad is amazing."

Sylvester's face was filled with admiration for Shin.

Allen thought it was impressive that Sylvester could respect his own father in such a way. While he respected his father as well, he also had moments of fear and annoyance. However, those feelings had faded somewhat after the recent visit to the Wolford family.

Allen was a bit envious of the pure admiration Sylvester had for his father, Shin.

In a hushed tone, as if he were confessing a forbidden secret, Sylvester leaned closer to Allen.

"What do you think? Did you know? Dad isn't actually Grandpa Merlin's real grandson."

"Huh?"

Allen, who had been on edge, wondering what secret was about to be revealed, suddenly froze.

"You didn't know that... Oh, right, it was mentioned in the first volume of 'The New Heroic Tales.'"

"They have that many books!?"

"Yeah. It covers Shin-sama's childhood, being picked up by the Sage-sama and receiving magical training, meeting the Crown Prince, meeting all the comrades, and even his encounters and love affairs with Princess Cecily are all written in there."

Sylvester, in an unusual display for him, frowned in distaste at the mention of his parents' love affairs.

"I don't want to know about my parents' love affairs..."

"What are you saying?!"

Even though they were adopted, their parents' love affairs were not something easily accepted as a child.

At this point, Cresta, who had been silent until now, interjected into their conversation.

"Shinsama and Princess Cecily's love story is the envy of girls all over the world! Everyone is so jealous of Silver-kun, who was raised by such amazing parents! And yet, the person himself says such things!"

Both Sylvester and Allen were taken aback by Cresta's impassioned speech, something they couldn't have imagined from her usual demeanor.

"Huh?! I, I didn't mean to..."

Seeing the reactions of the two, Cresta realized her mistake and turned bright red, lowering her head in embarrassment.

"Oh, uh, yeah. I understand that Cresta-san respects my dad and mom very well."

"Au..."

"I didn't know Cresta had that side to her."

Sylvester chuckled and tried to support Cresta, and Allen naturally reached out to pat Cresta's head while she blushed intensely.

"There, don't worry, lift your head."

"..."

"Cresta?"

Cresta, whose face was getting even redder with every moment, couldn't possibly raise her head.

Unaware of this, Allen leaned closer to Cresta's face.

"Hyaah!"

"Cresta! Your face is so red! Do you have a fever!?"

Oh, the classic line at this point!

Thought one of the classmates who had been observing the situation.

Noticing this, Sylvester spoke to Allen while wearing a wry smile.

"Cresta-san is fine. Anyway, how about giving her some space?"

"What? Why do you think you can understand Cresta's condition?!"

"Well... not just me, I think everyone understands, right?"

Whether out of jealousy or genuine concern for Cresta, Allen snapped at Sylvester for acting like he understood. However, Sylvester just looked around with a bewildered expression.

"Huh?"

Following Sylvester's gaze and looking around, everyone was nodding in agreement, saying, "Yeah, yeah."

"Why? What's going on?"

"Well, um, Allen-sama..."

Summoning her courage, Cresta called Allen's name and hesitated.

Becoming even redder, she struggled to speak.

"I-it's really okay. So, your... head..."

"Huh?"

Finally, Allen realized that he had been absentmindedly stroking Cresta's head.

"Whoa! I-I'm sorry!"

"N-no!"

Both of them blushed and looked down at the ground.

Their classmates, including Sylvester, watched with warmth, but Sylvester came up with an idea.

"Hey, Cresta-san. If you really want to hear more about your dad and mom, why don't you come over to our house again and ask them directly? Allen can come too."

"Huh!?"

In response to Sylvester's suggestion, both Allen and Cresta, who had been blushing and looking at the ground until then, turned to look at Sylvester in unison.

They were getting along very well.

"You see, Via-chan invited both of you again, so it's perfect timing."

"Perfect timing? You call an invitation from the Princess perfect timing..."

Upon Sylvester's suggestion, they remembered the invitation they couldn't refuse. Moreover, Sylvester suggested that they use this opportunity to talk to Shin and Cecily.

Having been in a good mood until then, both of them were now looking at the ground with somber expressions.

Seeing this, Sylvester tilted his head and said, "Huh? Did I say something weird?"

If someone who knew Shin had witnessed this scene, they would probably say, "Silver-kun is just like Shin-kun."
