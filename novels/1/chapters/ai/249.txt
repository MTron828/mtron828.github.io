"Due to the poor collection of taxes, the budget that Heero had planned couldn't be assembled, so he hastily implemented additional levies.

He somehow succeeded in collecting the planned amount, but dissatisfaction among the citizens began to rise thereafter.

Although the tax rate had increased slightly from the initial period, it was still lower than in the days of the monarchy.

"Maybe it was a mistake to lower it so significantly at first. People, once they get used to an easier life, tend to be dissatisfied with even minor inconveniences," Heero thought, echoing the words of his secretary.

In reality, his secretary was right. Initially, Heero was very popular with the citizens as a prime minister who lowered the tax rates. However, within less than a year after the first collection, there were additional levies.

Ultimately, the citizens quickly lost trust in Heero, seeing him no different from the previous rulers.

Heero's approval rating was steadily declining.

Nevertheless, there was a law in place that prevented Heero from resigning as prime minister without a substantial reason for the first five years of his term. So, Heero still held onto the position.

However, thinking about what would happen in five years gave Heero a headache.

"First of all, why is the tax collection performing so poorly? Something is off!" Heero couldn't help but shout, venting his frustration about the initial cause of this situation.

According to his plans, the initial tax rates should have provided enough funds for the smooth operation of the country. Yet, it suddenly fell apart.

"Well, the year before last, there was the Demon King's campaign, which affected the domestic gross national product negatively, I suppose?"

"â€¦What about this year?"

"Huh?"

"Last year, there were no such factors, yet this year the budget collection is still poor..."

After the tax collection from the citizens was complete, a new financial report was submitted. Heero let out a deep sigh upon reviewing the report.

Although more money was collected compared to the previous year due to the increased tax rates, it was still far less than the expected amount.

"If things continue like this, we might barely get by this year without raising the tax rate. But it's still cutting it close. If a major disaster or something similar were to occur, we'd have to levy additional taxes again..." Heero said, holding his head in his hands."

"If that's the case, why not ask for assistance from the Ultimate Magicians of Arlsheid? It would be more cost-effective than trying to handle it on your own, wouldn't it?"

When the secretary suggested this, Heero, who had been hanging his head, snapped to attention.

"I don't want to rely on those guys!!" Heero shouted in response.

Seeing Heero's outburst, the secretary sighed and asked, "Why do you hate them so much? They are remarkable young people who use their powers for the benefit of the people, without flaunting their own strength."

Upon hearing this, Heero became even more enraged. "Shut up! I have no intention of seeking their help! Get out of here!"

Heero yelled as he threw the financial report he had in his hand at the secretary.

The secretary, observing Heero's agitated state, simply turned on his heel and left without saying a word.

From behind, Heero muttered to himself, "Why... why is it... why are they the ones... I've come this far too..."

It was unclear who he was referring to, but given the context of the previous conversation, it could be inferred that he was talking about someone from the Ultimate Magicians.

The other party was a hero who had saved the world, making it rather presumptuous to have a sense of rivalry with them.

"...You're clouding your vision by always looking so far ahead," someone whispered softly, too quiet for Heero to hear.

The secretary had an inkling of the cause of Heero's current dilemma and the gradual deterioration of domestic affairs in the nation.

However, the secretary refrained from offering this advice. This was because the secretary had been involved in politics as a bureaucrat ever since graduating from the academy. On the other hand, Heero, who had never been involved in politics, found himself in the position of prime minister in the recent political upheaval, solely due to his popularity among the people.

The secretary didn't hold a high opinion of Heero, who had taken the highest office without any prior political experience. So, the secretary considered the decline in Heero's popularity among the citizens a natural consequence and saw no reason to help him.

(This country won't last much longer...)

Thinking this, the secretary reached for the doorknob, but was called out from behind.

"Hey, by the way, have you sent competent people to the Ultimate Magicians?"

"Yes, we dispatched capable personnel."

"I see... that's good."

Upon hearing Heero's words, the secretary left the office this time.

As he closed the door, Heero's muttering was audible once again.

"Something... if only the secret of the Ultimate Magicians... no, their secret were to be revealed..."

In response to this muttering, the secretary closed the door without saying anything.

"As per your orders, I've dispatched 'capable individuals.'"

The secretary said this quietly, in a way that Heero couldn't hear, and then headed to his own office.

As Heero listened to the receding footsteps, his frustration seemed to reach its breaking point, and he shouted while scratching his head, "Ahhhh!"

"Darn it! Darn it!! Why?! Why?! Does he... does he have cheats?! Not just powerful magic, but also a genius at making magical tools?! Usually, that kind of thing should be kept hidden! Why announce it so openly?! And on top of that... on top of that, he's married to a beautiful saint and even has children..."

After saying this, Heero clenched his fists and pounded the office desk as hard as he could.

"What's the difference between him and me?! He's probably a reincarnated person too! He must have climbed to his current position using modern knowledge cheats! Why do I have to suffer like this when I've done the same thing?!"

In an empty office, Heero vented his innermost thoughts.

Then, after exhaling heavily, he smiled as if he had thought of something.

"That's right. He's called a hero, but he's just an ordinary commoner. What about me? I'm a prime minister of a nation now... There's absolutely no way I'm inferior to him."

Heero said this and chuckled to himself, but suddenly, his eyes widened.

"Ugh! Gahhh!"

Suddenly, an unbearable pain shot through his entire body, and Heero rolled on the floor in agony.

"Ugh... Gah... Ahhh!"

He writhed in pain on the floor for a while, but eventually, the pain subsided, and he lay sprawled on the floor (as he was already lying down), catching his breath.

"Heh, heh... What in the world... Even the doctors can't figure out the cause... Damn it! Why... Why do I have to go through this..."

Saying this, Heero quietly cried.

There was no one to comfort Heero in his distress.

In a different city from the former capital of the Darm Republic...

Inside one of the particularly large buildings in that city, there was an impressive office.

As the office door was roughly knocked on, the door was opened without waiting for permission from the person inside.

"Well, well! You called for me, Gope?"

The man who entered the office without courtesy was met with a glass ashtray thrown at his face as soon as he entered, causing him to fall to the floor.

"How many times do I have to tell you to wait for my response, you idiot? And I told you not to call me 'Gope'!"

The man who threw the ashtray didn't show any concern for the man on the floor but instead showered him with insults.

The man's appearance was far from what one would consider respectable, and it didn't seem to match the ambiance of this office at all.

Rather, the word "Gope" that the fallen man had used seemed to suit the man's appearance better.

But the man didn't tolerate it.

"Call me 'Councilman' properly. I won't go easy on you if you make the mistake again."

"Y-Yes..."

When the man implicitly conveyed that there wouldn't be a next time, the man who had stood up apologized while bleeding from his nose and mouth.

The man in the office told him to call him 'Councilman.'

In other words, he was one of the council members elected since Darm became a republic.

However, his appearance was far from respectable.

The man used to be part of the criminal underworld.

"So, how's the situation with that matter?"

When the councilman asked, the man who had entered reported while still bleeding.

"Well, the selection of the person is done, and we've already infiltrated him into his country!"

"Oh? So, how's it going then?"

When the councilman inquired, the man being questioned shifted his gaze.

"Well, you see... it's just that..."

"Yes? Is it not going well?"

"N-No! The infiltration itself is proceeding smoothly! It's just that the reports mention difficulties in gaining favor with the nobility of that country..."

Upon hearing this report, the councilman let out a deep sigh.

"Geez, why is he hesitating so much? This is the perfect opportunity right now."

"I-I'm sorry! I'll push more aggressively from now on!"

"Of course! Listen up! If you mess up this opportunity, you won't get away with it, understand?"

The man, cowed by the councilman's stern tone, also began to have doubts.

"U-Um, Councilman, may I ask a question?"

"What is it?"

"Why are we aiming for such a huge country? Isn't it a bit reckless?"

As the man said this, the councilman let out a deep sigh.

"You really don't understand a thing, do you?"

"W-Well..."

"Sure, if we were to directly challenge a country like that, a small nation like ours would have no chance."

"That's true."

"But..." The councilman said and then grinned.

"Right now, it's a perfect opportunity."

"Now? I heard that the country is celebrating because the Crown Princess is pregnant..."

"That's why."

"Huh?"

The man couldn't quite grasp what the councilman was saying.

With an even broader smile, the councilman continued, "If this plan succeeds..."

At that point, the councilman paused and then spoke with a touch of grandeur, "We can control Arlsheid from behind the scenes."

The man was left staring at the councilman, who spoke with confidence, in awe.

Arlsheid, a major country that could be considered the most significant contributor in the recent Demon King's War.

To have control over such a power, it was like a dream.

Upon hearing about this incredible plan, the man couldn't help but gulp in astonishment.
