Cecilia, Sicily's older sister, had been hurt. Furthermore, they were targeting Sicily herself.

I couldn't contain my anger. "You... prepare yourselves."

I spoke with a surprisingly deep, intimidating voice, perhaps due to the massive amount of magic I was radiating. The demons momentarily flinched.

Seizing the momentary paralysis, I reached into my pocket dimension to retrieve the Vibration Sword. With the aid of body enhancement magic and my jet boots for acceleration, I closed in on one of the demons.

"Too... fast!"

The demon started to say something, but before the words could leave their mouth, I slashed the Vibration Sword upward from a diagonal angle, splitting the demon in two.

"One down..."

"Attack!"

Other demons, observing this, fired their magic toward us.

"Shin!"

Og called out my name.

"Did it work?"

One of the demons raised the flag of having not done it yet.

I listened to this conversation from within the smokescreen created by the impact of the magic. When the demons released their spells, I activated the magic tool ring equipped with a defensive spell. I remained unscathed.

I dashed out of the smokescreen and headed towards the next demon.

"It's still troublesome!"

The demon who faced me hastily erected a magical barrier, but the situation had made me quite irate. I deliberately switched to using offensive magic against the barrier.

I deployed around a dozen of temperature-raised "white" fiery spears around me and directed them at the demon.

"Ugh! What's this power and heat?!?"

The demon managed to barely ward off the fiery spear with their magical barrier, but it had weakened substantially.

I thought to myself, "This is just one spear."

And I had dozens more fiery spears ready.

"W-Wait a minute..."

"You're not going to wait."

Seeing the several fiery spears closing in after narrowly defending one, the demon displayed an expression of despair, and though they shouted words of restraint, there was no way we would heed them.

I knew that sending this number of spears was clearly overkill, but I directed all of these dozen spears towards a single demon.

"Ugh...!"

While they managed to fend off the first few spears, they couldn't block the subsequent fiery spears that hit consecutively. Their magical barrier was shattered, and the demon quite literally disintegrated.

As I watched this scene, another demon released a spell towards me.

"You monster!"

How outrageous.

"Monster... I think that's more fitting for you guys!"

I couldn't believe these demons, who had slaughtered all of the Empire's citizens. They seemed like devils or monsters.

I avoided the incoming spell, not catching it, and headed for the demon who cast it. But as I did, a different demon's magic came flying at me from the side.

"Are you foolish?! Parallel activation!?"

I deployed the defensive magic tool and blocked the magic from the side. During all of this, I continued my charge, combining body enhancement and jet boots.

To the surprise of the demons, I simultaneously unleashed an offensive spell. For me, launching multiple spells at once wasn't that challenging. I visualized it like running multiple programs concurrently on a computer. However, according to Og, the parallel activation of these spells was considered unconventional. This common sense applied to the demons too, and they were astonished by my ability to deploy multiple spells simultaneously.

The demon I was approaching had been preparing an attack magic rather than using a magic barrier for defense.

"What!?"

"Too bad for you."

"Damn it!"

The demon couldn't switch to defense at the last moment, so they released the prepared offensive spell towards me. And I, having already prepared an attack spell, directed it straight at the demon.

The demon's spell was of fire magic, while I sent a spear of ice â€“ the complete opposite.

In a split second, the demon's face lit up with glee.

Certainly, their magic had an advantage. Yet, it was a simple solution.

"What...? The number of those...?"

Just like before, I deployed several dozen ice spears and began smashing them one after another into the incoming fireballs.

At first, the ice spears were being extinguished by the flames, but as I continued striking them, the power of the fireballs rapidly decreased. Eventually, they vanished before reaching me. After the flames were gone, there were still plenty of ice spears on my side.

The demon who had released the fireballs was left dumbfounded by this sight. Without hesitation, I directed the remaining ice spears towards the astonished demon, just as I had done with the fire spears earlier.

The demon was too dumbfounded to activate their magical barrier. They were pierced by the ice spears and turned into an ice statue as more spears kept hitting them.

Now, what's left...?

"Two more..."

I fixed my gaze on the demons observing me from a distance, and they appeared visibly unnerved. They glanced back and seemed to be searching for an opportunity to escape.

Their actions further irritated me. Attacking first and then trying to flee when things turned against them.

"Planning to run away with such half-hearted resolve! You dare to pick a fight with humanity!"

Shouting this, I dashed toward one of the two remaining demons. However, unexpectedly, a spell struck the ground between me and the demon from a direction I hadn't foreseen, causing the ground to explode.

"Damn it! Where did that come from!?"

Out of anger, I had lost some of my composure. I hadn't noticed another demon's presence among the remaining two.

They had likely come as reinforcements, perceiving the situation as unfavorable. To search for the new demon, I deployed a detection spell and scanned the area.

Then...

"Let's put a stop to this, Shin Wolford."

A different-looking demon than the others appeared.

"Captain Zest!!"

The two remaining demons shouted and hid behind the new demon.

Captain?

"What's this? Are you going to be my opponent now?"

I was so worked up that I found myself uttering lines that sounded like they came from a battle-crazed individual.

Anyway, I just wanted to vent this anger on someone.

"Don't get so agitated, Shin Wolford. There's no way I can be your opponent, is there?"

"Oh, really? Then why the hell did you launch this attack?"

You have no intention of fighting me, but you initiated this attack? What's going on here?

"I certainly didn't anticipate you joining the fray. It has thrown our plans off slightly."

"Don't mess with me! What kind of plans?"

"Hey. Could it be that you guys..."

"Well, it seems you're making various guesses. Is that fine with you?"

"What? What are you talking about?"

"You see, I was originally a soldier of the Empire."

"A soldier..."

So, you used to be part of the Imperial military? But why are you bringing this up all of a sudden?

Confused about Zest's intentions, I received an answer from a completely different source.

"Your Highness! Duke August!"

A soldier from the Earlshide army who had been waiting in the rear ran up to Aug.

"What's going on at a time like this?"

"I apologize! But we have received urgent communications from several nations!"

"Urgent communications?"

"Yes! From Earlshide and neighboring nations..."

What? Could it be...?

"Reports of demons appearing!"

"What!?"

Aug looked alarmed and glanced in our direction.

"In the military, we always prepare multiple layers of defenses for unforeseen situations."

Zest said this with an inappropriate grin.

"You...!"

"Well, can you leave us alone now? You know, it's not that difficult to eliminate nations that lack people like you."

I felt genuinely furious at Zest's smugness.

"Ugh! This guy!"

"Shin! We can deal with him later! Right now, the demons that have appeared in various countries are our top priority!"

As soon as Aug said that, the newly arrived demon and the remaining two had already moved away from this location.

"Then we shall take our leave."

They said this and left, leaving me with nothing to do but watch them in frustration.

I can chase after them and defeat them.

However, I can't leave the countries currently under attack by demons.

"Darn it! Aug! We need to hurry to the defense of various countries!"

"I understand! Hey! Have demons appeared only in the countries around the former empire?"

"Yes! There have been no reports from Els and East!"

"In that case..."

Right there, Aug decided to send two people to each of the countries. When the pairs were sorted, the first ones set out to their assigned countries using the gates. The five countries that share borders with the former empire are Earlsheid, Swiede, Daam, Karunan, and Kurt. With two people each, there were two extras, so Mark and Olivia stayed behind as liaisons. While they waited for communication from everyone, Mark apparently went to retrieve the dismissed horses.

As for my pair...

"Cecilia!"

"Huh? Oh, yes, you were amazing, Shin... but more importantly, what's going on?"

"Demons have appeared in various countries, including Earlsheid! We don't have a moment to spare! Is it alright if I take Cecily with me?"

Upon hearing my words, a startled Cecily began to panic.

"W-wait, demons! We need to go right now! But, there are other people who need healing..."

"Cecily!"

Cecilia snapped at Cecily, who had started to waver between wanting to participate in demon hunting and staying here to provide healing.

"This place is fine. So you should go with Shin. Embarrassingly enough, it seems I was the most severely injured, so there's nothing life-threatening for us now."

"But, still..."

"Your desire to heal everyone is admirable, but don't you have other things you should be doing?"

"... I..."

"Trust us more. By the way, isn't that something an older sister would say when sending her little sister to fight demons?"

"Th-that's not the case!"

"Shin! So, that's how it is. Please take care of Cecily."

"Yes! I understand! Cecily, let's go!"

"Alright! I understand! Big sister, please take care of things here!"

"You can count on me. Be careful!"

"Yes!"

With Cecilia's persuasion, we set out to fight the demons. Our assigned country was Karunan.

In this way, we were sent off by Cecilia and headed to Karunan through the gate.

After Shin and Cecily left for Karunan, Cecily's sister, Cecilia, who remained, spoke to everyone.

"So, I said that to her. We mustn't let anyone die, right?"

"Yes!"

In response to Cecilia's words, the healers shouted in agreement. In reality, Cecilia had the most severe injuries, but this didn't mean that the others had escaped unscathed. There were injuries like broken bones and lacerations. Cecilia had unintentionally uttered the ominous phrase, "leave it to me," and now, she felt determined to help all the patients, not just the one she was treating.

However...

"I'm not the one who'll be doing the healing..."

Nonetheless, the healers responded to Cecilia's words because she was Cecily's sister, referred to as a saint. She had delegated demon hunting to her sister and her comrades and couldn't even provide healing herself. Frustrated with her own helplessness, Cecilia bit her lip.

"I want to become stronger..."

Cecilia whispered a phrase that would likely astonish her older brother, Royce, who was a part of Cecily's group.

"I hope they're safe..."

Looking up at the now quiet battlefield littered with the remains of monstrous creatures, Cecilia could do nothing but pray for the safety of her sister, her brother-in-law, and their companions.

After passing through the gate, we were met by a combined force of shepherds and the Karunan army.

The presence of the shepherds remained as formidable as ever.

"Huh? Oh, it's Shin!"

"Long time no see, Garan! What about the demons?"

Garlan, the head of the National Sheep Farm, immediately greeted us, and Shin inquired about the current situation.

"Well, you see..."

Garlan looked a bit puzzled as he gestured towards something...

There it was! A demon!

However, something was off about this demon.

"...What's it doing?"

There was only one demon, and it stood still without doing anything.

"The thing is, when we thought the demons had appeared, they just stand there and do nothing."

"They're doing nothing?"

"Yeah. But it's not like we can handle demons. We can't even get close to them or figure out what to do... Ah!"

"Huh?"

In the midst of their conversation, Garlan suddenly shouted while looking at the demon.

Shin also turned his gaze in that direction and saw the demon running away from this place at an incredible speed.

"Oh!"

The demon had run out of sight to a distance where they couldn't see it anymore.

"What on earth...?"

This unexpected turn of events was so surprising that it made Shin forget his anger from a moment ago, and he watched the demon's departure in astonishment.

"More importantly, Shin, you need to report to Mark and the others."

"Ah, right."

Shin took out a radio communication device and contacted Mark.

"Oh, Shin!"

Cecily hurriedly called Shin, but Mark answered. Shin gestured an apology to Cecily and began his communication with Mark.

At that moment, for some reason, Cecily draped a cloak over Shin.

It's not that cold, is it? Shin thought, but he couldn't keep Mark waiting, so he started talking.

"Hello, Mark?"

"Oh, Waldford-kun, right? Have you already defeated the demons?"

"No, the thing is, they didn't do anything and just ran away."

"They ran away?"

"Yeah, have you heard any reports from others?"

"We were the first to report, but... Oh, it seems Olivia received a message."

Mark probably contacted Olivia because he was in the middle of a conversation. After waiting for Olivia's report for a while, Mark informed Shin of the results.

"It seems the others are reporting the same thing. They just ran away without doing anything."

"I see..."

What did they want to achieve, in the end?

"Anyway, it seems we have reports from others, so I'll hang up for now."

"Sure, I understand."

After ending the call with Mark, Shin and Cecily exchanged glances.

"What could be their goal?"

"I don't know anymore, Shin..."

While saying this, Cecily recovered the cloak and put it back on.

"What? And why the cloak?"

"It doesn't matter. I'm sorry, but I don't understand the demons' intentions."

"No, I don't understand them either, so you don't have to apologize."

Demons can cause significant damage even as a single entity...

More importantly, I'm curious about Cecily's actions.

I wonder what's going on?

As he was thinking this, Garlan approached Shin and spoke.

"Hey, Shin. That thing of yours..."

"Huh? Oh, this is..."

Oops, I used the radio communication device while Garlan was here. Wait, maybe this is what Cecily was about to mention earlier!

"Uh, sorry, but please keep this matter confidential..."

"Ha, you... that thing you're using is the wireless version of the famous communication device in various countries, right? Don't casually use such a national secret..."

"Oh, uh, sorry."

"Well, it seems I was the only one who noticed it up close, so I'll let it slide this time. But be more careful next time."

"Sorry, and thank you."

Garlan turned out to be a kind person.

"Come on. What if someone malicious had seen it?"

"Uh, sorry. I just... slipped my mind."

Cecily seemed to have noticed and others were probably handling it well. Due to the image of the cell phone from his previous life, Shin was prone to using it.

"Please be cautious. Shin, now all the countries are watching your every move."

"All the countries, isn't that a bit exaggerated..."

"It's not an exaggeration! Look..."

Cecily pointed to the mixed unit of shepherds and Karnan soldiers.

Most of them were looking in their direction.

"...I suppose that's why I couldn't see how you communicated earlier."

"I activated optical camouflage by putting a cloak on you, Shin. Garlan saw us before that..."

Oh, now that I think about it, I'm not wearing my combat suit at the moment. So, that's why Cecily put the cloak on me!

"Sorry. Thanks, Cecily."

"Please be careful, alright? If something happens to you, Shin, I..."

Cecily said this, but this time, the opposite nearly occurred. Due to the demon's magical attack, Shin nearly lost Cecily. This sudden realization made him scared, and he instinctively pulled Cecily close.

"Huh? Uh, Shin..."

"I was scared... I thought I might lose you, Cecily."

"Shin..."

If Shin were to lose Cecily over something like that, he couldn't imagine what would happen to him.

Thinking like that, the warmth in my arms right now was so precious.

I had sworn that I would absolutely protect this warmth.

While I held this conviction within me, Cecily in my arms shifted slightly.

"What's wrong, Cecily?"

"Um, well... behind us..."

"Behind us?"

At Cecily's words, I looked behind us, and there were Garlan with an exasperated look and everyone from the mixed unit of shepherds and Karnan soldiers. They were grinning, watching us.

"Oh..."

"Oh, um... I can't believe this... in front of all these people..."

Cecily was blushing furiously and couldn't even raise her face.

I, on the other hand, was feeling quite embarrassed. I was probably bright red...

"Well, well, save that kind of thing for when you get home..."

Garlan said, but just then...

"Huh? What's that sound?"

"S-Sorry, Garlan. Can you cover for us for a moment?"

"Y-Yeah."

The ringtone of the radio communication device resonated in the surroundings.

Both Cecily and I received calls.

This meant it was an open channel.

Was this a report from someone?

Cecily and I activated the optical camouflage built into our cloaks and answered the call.

"Hello? Who's this?"

"Everyone! It's Mark! Hurry... hurry back!"

"Hey, what's going on, Mark? There haven't been any demon attacks in the other countries, right?"

In the open channel, we could hear Oug's voice as well.

"There haven't been any attacks in the other countries, but it's not that!"

Not that.

Which meant...

"It's from the old capital! An unbelievable number of disaster-class demons have appeared!"
