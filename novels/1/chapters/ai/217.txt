Given its size, I think this is probably a considerable skyscraper. It seems to have more than thirty floors, and it easily surpasses a hundred meters. Nevertheless, there's no doubt that someone from the previous civilization had memories of their past life, but were they involved in construction work? Otherwise, I can only see a future where amateur attempts at building skyscrapers result in collapse. Everyone seemed overwhelmed by the size of the building, their voices silenced, but I was curious about the person who built it, so I remained silent.

Then, Shaolin-san called out to me from behind. "Are you surprised? This is what is considered a relic of the previous civilization. It is likely to have been a building, but we still can't imagine how high it was or how it was built." Shaolin-san, looking up at the building, seemed a little proud. "Unfortunately, there are no complete structures left, but even just a part of it is amazing, isn't it?"

"You're right... just by looking at this, you can tell that the previous civilization had advanced technology," Tony said and started examining the building closely. The rest of us followed suit and looked around together.

"Is this naturally carved from stone? Or is it..."

"It's a man-made structure," I replied to Oug, and both Oug and Shaolin-san looked at me. "Why do you think that?"

Oh, Shaolin-san is showing her guard. She was cooperative regarding Hao and Ryuu, but she doesn't seem to let her guard down when it comes to the previous civilization.

However, I thought that if I tried to deceive them, it would only raise more suspicion, so I explained why I concluded it was a man-made structure.

"Why? Because there's something inside the stone, isn't there? That's something used to reinforce its strength, right? Do things like that exist in nature?"

When I said that, everyone, except Shaolin-san and Leifan-san, stared at the building once again.

"You're right. As Shin said, there's something inside the stone."

"Shaolin-san! Is it okay if we touch it!?"

Maria, after confirming, asked Shaolin-san if it was okay to touch it.

"Huh? Yes, it's fine."

"Alright!"

Here's the English translation of the provided text:

Oug is lost in thought, envisioning the possibility of fortifying the city, while Mark and Yuri seem excited about the new technology. However...

"Um... shouldn't we go now? We haven't even entered the entrance to the ruins yet," Shaolin-san's polite words bring the three of them back to reality.

That's right; we're still in front of the entrance.

"Yeah, you're right! If we're already impressed before entering the entrance, there must be even more incredible technology inside!"

Mark says this and enters the entrance to the ruins, leaving the rest of us behind.

"Mark, that's not fair! I'm going too!"

"Wait, don't leave us behind!"

Yuri and Olivia chase after Mark into the ruins.

"I said I wanted to go too."

Tony looks at Mark and Yuri, who are more excited than he is, and smiles wryly. After all, Tony just wanted to see the ruins out of simple curiosity. Still, he probably can't compete with engineers who have witnessed the advanced technology of the previous civilization.

"Well, let's take it slow and enjoy the sightseeing. We can leave the technical stuff to those two."

When I say this, I get strange looks from everyone. What's going on?

"Well, I thought you'd be the most interested in this kind of thing..."

"You're surprisingly calm."

Maria and Sicily comment on my composure. Huh? Did they think I'd react differently?

I look around, and they nod in agreement. Seriously?

To my shock, Alice and Lin bring up something outrageous.

"Could it be? Shin, do you already know about it?"

"Indeed, there are suspicions that Wolforde-kun has memories from the previous civilization era."

"Huh!?"

Are they really bringing up this topic now?

I thought I had managed to divert attention away from it. I look at Shaolin-san, and it's clear she's still regarding me with suspicion.

So I didn't manage to divert attention from it after all.
