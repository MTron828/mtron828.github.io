Before Olivia joined to help, Yuri was facing the demons alone.

Originally, the reason she, who wasn't as skilled in offensive magic as the others, was fighting alone was...

"Hiyah!"

"Whoa!?"

"That's right."

"Hey, wait! Stop!"

"I won't wait."

"Oh! You! How many magical tools do you have!?"

"Huh? That's a secret."

"Don't mess around... Agh!"

Yuri understood her lack of firepower. Her solution was a "quantity over quality" strategy. She had enlisted the help of the craftsmen at the Bean Workshop to create a large number of short staves that were easy to carry and imbued them with attack magic. These staves with attack magic were stored in holsters created by the Bean Workshop craftsmen, which she strapped around her waist. Yuri would pull out one staff after another from the holster and continuously unleash attacks on the demons. The attack magic on the staves was based on Yuri's imagination, so a single attack wouldn't be fatal, but it would definitely cause substantial damage. The demons were not pleased with the relentless barrage of attacks. However, they managed to dodge and defend against Yuri's continuous onslaught, and they still had the energy to complain. In other words, the demons still had the ability to speak.

"Ugh, is this not enough?"

Yuri pouted with dissatisfaction, while the demons glared at her with resentment.

"We've become demons, entered a realm we've yearned for... and now we have to deal with this kid, still in human form..."

The demon expressed their anger toward Yuri.

"Don't mess with me!"

Suddenly, the demon who had only been on the receiving end of attacks launched an assault.

"Whoa!"

Yuri quickly deployed her defense magical tools to block the demon's magic.

However, the demon's attacks didn't stop.

"We became demons, and what kind of thoughts do you think we had!"

The demon shouted as they continuously cast spells.

"I don't know anything about that!"

Yuri raised her voice, visibly angered by the demon's clear frustration.

But the demon's attacks didn't cease.

"Noisy! Do you even know how the Empire's commoners were treated!?"

"That's why I said I don't know!"

"We, the Empire's commoners, were nothing but exploited! Can you understand our feelings after being oppressed like that!?"

"Then take it up with the Empire!"

"They left us no choice but to destroy it!"

"Does that mean you have to cause trouble for everyone else too?"

"We can't forgive it!"

"What's that supposed to mean!?"

"People like you! Living in comfort and luxury, indulging themselves while we struggled just to survive!"

"..."

Yuri was left speechless by the demon's cruel accusations. The audacious and groundless claims rendered her momentarily speechless, but the demon wasn't about to stop.

Thinking there were no words to counter her argument, the demon directed even more of their anger at Yuri.

"We lived in oppression, barely scraping by, and thanks to Lord Strom, we became demons and could finally stand on equal footing with the Empire! You think you, a brat like you, are equal to us!? Don't make me laugh!"

Listening to these words, Yuri felt an anger she had never experienced before rise within her.

With a heart full of fury, Yuri reached for additional wands from her holsters.

"Who's the one messing around here?"

"What?"

"I sympathize with your situation. But, you see!"

Yuri said this and aimed multiple wands at the demon.

"I've worked hard, really hard! I'm different from you who became demons and gained power unconditionally!!"

Yuri continued and activated multiple wands simultaneously, releasing various types of magic, including fire, wind, water, and earth magic all at once towards the demon.

"What!?"

Upon seeing multiple spells being cast at once, even the demon felt threatened and hurriedly tried to evade.

"Whoa!?"

Explosions erupted where the spells had landed just a moment ago, causing the demon, who was sweating profusely, to look at Yuri. Her anger had not subsided.

"I received training from Mr. Wolford! I was instructed by Lady Merida! I've come this far with their guidance!!"

Yuri shouted and, from her holsters, pulled out most of the remaining wands to direct at the demon.

"Wait... just a moment!"

As the demon hesitated due to Yuri's reaction and was about to utter words of restraint, it was suddenly struck by an attack from an unexpected angle.

"Gah..."

"Olivia, nice shot!"

The demon was left vulnerable in front of Yuri due to the support fire from Olivia, who had moved a short distance through a gate.

"And now!"

Yuri activated a multitude of magical items she held in her hands simultaneously and aimed them at the demon.

"Ugh... damn it... you...!"

The demon, struck directly by Yuri's magic, disappeared without a trace, leaving those words behind.

Having confirmed the situation, Yuri remarked, "Huh, so combining them all together results in this much power."

She appeared to have completely calmed down, her enthusiasm inappropriate for a battlefield. Olivia rushed over to Yuri, her expression somewhat strained.

"Y-Yuri, that was incredible..."

"Right? It's amazing, isn't it? I wonder if this is a new discovery?"

"W-Well, maybe? Who knows?"

"But with this, I can fight demons on an equal footing too!"

"Y-Yes..."

"Olivia, you really saved me earlier. I'll count on your support again, okay?"

"Sure..."

With that, Yuri turned and headed toward the next demon.

Watching her walk away, Olivia mumbled softly to herself.

"...I should make sure not to anger Yuri..."

In Olivia's mind, this was the moment when Yuri transitioned from being a mature older sister-like figure to someone quite terrifying when provoked.
