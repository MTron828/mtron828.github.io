There were movements in the operation to conquer the Demon Territory.

Currently, while many demons still appeared in the Demon Territory, their area of activity had significantly decreased. Therefore, the decision was made to reduce the number of troops. In terms of efficiency, it would be better to capture the territory with a large force, but after several months of deployment, the soldiers' mental burdens had become quite substantial, contributing to this decision.

It's worth noting that there hadn't been any personnel rotations.

As a result, the ultimate conclusion of the situation was postponed. However, the people did not mourn this. Instead, they sensed that there was enough leeway to reduce the personnel, and the operation had entered its final stage.

Throughout the capital, and indeed the entire world, people felt that victory was within reach. In the atmosphere of victory, Oug, who had come to school, didn't seem to share the enthusiasm.

"What's wrong, Oug? You look quite down."

"...Did I have that kind of expression?"

"Yes. Hey, are you worried about the delay in the conclusion because they're bringing back half of the personnel?"

"No..."

Huh? Isn't that the reason?

While staring at Oug, I couldn't help but think it was the cause.

Then he slowly began to speak.

"Hey, Shin."

"What?"

"Just the other day, we used to see catastrophic-level magical creatures all over."

"Oh, now that you mention it, I haven't heard about them lately."

"That's right. They vanished after we defeated the demons. What do you think about that?"

"What?"

So, the catastrophic-level creatures disappeared?

They were appearing everywhere just a few days ago, so what happened?

"It seems it's because we defeated the demons."

"Is that so?"

In that case...

"When demons increased, magical creatures, especially the catastrophic ones, increased as well. And now, with fewer demons, the appearance of catastrophic creatures decreased, right?"

"Seems like that's the conclusion."

Oug said this with a relieved expression.

"What is it?"

"During the recent meeting, this topic came up, and I made the same proposal as you did."

"I see."

"Then the discussion continued in that direction, and they decided to reduce personnel and discussed concluding the operation."

"Is that so?"

"Yeah. However, I was worried that no other opinions were brought up. I wanted to make sure we weren't overlooking anything else."

I see. He got worried because his suggestion was accepted as it is.

Honestly, it's just speculation; there's no concrete evidence. But given the situation, it seems like there's no other possibility...

"I hope we haven't overlooked anything..."

The number of magical creatures increased significantly since Strom appeared and many demons showed up.

Simultaneously, the number of catastrophic magical creatures increased. The ominous magical power we sensed from Strom and the demons we've defeated was also related.

We suspect that wild animals affected by this magical power turned into magical creatures.

Considering all that, it seems like we might be correct... Oh...

"By the way, what about those...?"

"What do you mean? Did we overlook something!?"

Oops. Oug seems very interested in this. I wonder if he's worried about the change in the strategy for this operation?

"Rather than overlooking, it's more about those wolf magical creatures we encountered, or the deer magical creature that Tony encountered, or the rhinoceros magical creature that Zeek and the others encountered."

The wolf magical creature, despite reaching catastrophic level, didn't exhibit the cunning typical of such creatures. The deer magical creature, despite being large, I've never heard of reaching catastrophic level. As for the rhinoceros, there aren't even records of it becoming a magical creature.

Isn't this an unusual situation?

However, there was the unique existence of the group of demons, something we've never experienced before. Due to the influence of their strong demonic magical energy, the wolf magical creature quickly reached catastrophic level and appeared before us before becoming more cunning. The deer turned into a large magical creature and then into catastrophic level. The rhinoceros, which was thought not to be magical, became a magical creature.

If you think about it that way, it doesn't seem like an unreasonable hypothesis.

But there's this feeling, like a little thorn is pricking me... I can't quite put my finger on it.

"The existence of magical creatures different from the records until now..."

"Well, I was just a little curious, that's all."

In any case, speculation alone won't provide any answers. Since it's a joint operation with multiple countries, the coordination with each country should already be done, and it's likely that the return orders have been given on-site. We can't stop everything on an ambiguous note, especially when there's no conclusion yet.

If we do that, it might instill further anxiety and suspicion among the people.

In other words, there's no turning back now.

"Well, I don't even know if that's a problem, and I think it's not wrong to keep moving forward like this."

"Is that so... Yeah."

"If there are no issues from here on, we can seal Strom and others in the former imperial capital and establish a joint surveillance network with the other countries. Maybe it's better to focus all our efforts on not making any mistakes in the final steps?"

"Indeed, instead of being troubled by unanswered questions, we should concentrate on what's right in front of us."

Oug still seems worried, but he seems to have decided to focus on the importance of this operation. The conclusion for this operation to conquer the realm of demons is to seal Strom in the old imperial capital, without any intention of invading neighboring countries, and to monitor that with a joint network of multiple countries.

If we believe the words of the defeated demons, Strom seems to have already achieved his goal and is now an empty shell. If we don't provoke Strom, there shouldn't be a threat anymore.

There might be a slim chance of something happening, but that's what the surveillance network is for. There are voices calling for the complete elimination of demons, but we can't expose people to any more danger.

Let's just hope that this operation concludes without any incidents.

But... according to the demons, there should be demons around Strom who haven't left.

Let's hope they don't do anything strange...

Oug and I were having a serious discussion in the academy classroom, so it seems like everyone else was curious.

"His Highness and Shin, always talking about difficult stuff, huh?"

"Yeah, I can't keep up."

"Aren't we supposed to just beat the enemies that show up! Isn't that enough?"

"Resolve it forcibly with the power of magic."

"...Can't Cutie Red and Cutie Blue think a little more?"

"Don't call us by those names!"

Thanks to Alice and Lin, the heavy atmosphere from earlier changed, and laughter filled the classroom.

Everyone hoped that these moments of camaraderie and laughter would last forever.

There would be no more trips for us. That was our common understanding at that time.

And it seems like that wish came true, as the operation to conquer the realm of demons proceeded smoothly.

First, all countries recalled half of their personnel. Reserve forces were deployed, and those remaining were rotated out.

The operation was progressing well. The situation with the demon activity was heading towards a conclusion. During this time, there was an announcement from the Earlsheid Magical Academy. Until now, magic stones were often discovered by chance during mining in places like mines. However, it was officially announced that many magic stones were being excavated near volcanoes or areas with significant faults. This announcement was based on my hypothesis drawn from past mining records and confirmed by the Earlsheid Mage Corps' investigations.

Although the exact purification conditions for magic stones were not disclosed, the Wolford Trading Company was bustling with activity every day. Since I was the owner of the store who had discovered the conditions for mining magic stones, many people assumed there might already be products using magic stones. Even so, I couldn't possibly have developed products that quickly.

For the time being, I considered retrofitting a refrigerator with magic stones to allow ice to be produced automatically without the need for mana. Once magic stones became more readily available, I expected there would be more inventions by magical craftsmen. This would contribute to the further advancement of humanity.

This expectation spread among the people, and Earlsheid's reputation increased even more after the information was shared publicly. It seemed that their influence within the current world union had grown significantly. However, they were cautious not to overstep and provoke neighboring countries or Els or East, as it might ignite new conflicts.

With the smooth operation and increased magic stone excavations, many people could see a brighter future. This was provided that the demon crisis came to an end.

By the time we advanced to the second year, the construction of the surveillance network was almost complete. Humanity was on the verge of achieving relative peace. But, we had made a fundamental misunderstanding, and there was something we had forgotten about Strom. Specifically, what he had been doing in the capital earlier.
