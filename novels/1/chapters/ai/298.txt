I watched as Sharl, escorted by the teacher, headed towards the classroom and some time passed.

We parents remained in the auditorium, waiting for the children to finish their first homeroom after the entrance ceremony.

After the children had left, it was like free time, and we gathered with the usual group of people.

However, among the usual faces was Aug.

As the Crown Prince, Aug received brief greetings from high-ranking nobles.

I understand that, but for some reason, he also greeted me as if it were just a formality.

I'm not a noble, so I don't attend evening parties, but many of the high-ranking nobles are customers or business partners of mine, or rather, of the Walford Trading Company.

He would exchange small talk with me, despite my concerns for Sharl. After all, he's a business associate.

I couldn't be rude to him.

While talking about trivial matters like how it's their first child's enrollment, so they're more nervous than me or how it's their second child's enrollment, so they're more relaxed, a considerable amount of time seemed to have passed.

"Oh, it looks like my child has returned. Well then, Mr. Chairman, until next time."

"Yes."

People with business ties with me call me "Mr. Chairman."

I am the chairman of the Walford Trading Company.

The president is still Mr. Glenn, Alice's father.

The managing director is Alice's husband and Sicily's brother, Mr. Royce.

Royce has already been designated as the successor by his father, Lord Cecil, and is set to inherit the viscount's title when Cecil retires.

However, Cecil isn't just managing the estate; he also works as a bureaucrat in the royal capital's treasury.

So, Royce plans to serve as the managing director at the Walford Trading Company while also managing the estate.

Thanks to the talents of Glenn and Royce, the Walford Trading Company has been steadily growing.

The number of employees has increased, and it seems that the workload of President Glenn and Managing Director Royce has significantly decreased.

If we continue like this, it seems there won't be any issues with managing the estate while working as the managing director.

Oh, by the way, the increase in employees is due to the expansion of the product range, and we built a new store and relocated there. As a result, the entire floor that originally housed the Walford Trading Company's store and offices is now used by the Ultimate Magicians, as their numbers have also increased.

While seeing off the noble business partners, it seems that Sharl and the others have also arrived.

Silver is with them, but... oh, they're in that state again. On Silver's right arm, there's Sharl, and on the left, there's Via. Silver in the middle seems to have a hard time walking.

"Hey, Sharl, you're sticking too close. Silver onii-sama looks uncomfortable, you know?"

"Big brother has a duty to guide his little sister, it's fine! Via-chan is the one who's clinging too much!"

"Silver onii-sama's escort belongs to me, naturally!"

"What's an escort?"

Even though Sharl adores her big brother, Silver, and it's clear that Via has a crush on him, they're glaring at each other with Silver caught in the middle when it comes to sharing him. They usually get along well, but they become like this when they're competing for Silver's attention. Max, who's following behind them, is also smiling wryly. As for Rain, I'm not sure.

When I look at Max and Rain, I realize that Rain is accompanying a girl I don't know. I wonder who she is, but first, I need to thank Silver for bringing Sharl.

"Silver, thanks for bringing Sharl here. Well done, big brother."

I say this and pat Silver's head. Silver looks a little embarrassed.

"It's fine. Hey, Sharl, let go."

"Yes."

Silver says, and Sharl and Via obediently release Silver's arms.

"Silver, thanks for being Via's escort."

"Yes, Silver is quite reliable. Unlike Shin."

"What do you mean by that?"

"Shin-kun is the most reliable person in the world, you know? By the way, Sharl, won't you introduce that child to us?"

"Sure!"

Shisilly casually followed up on Aug's statement, but she was clearly curious about the girl who had come with Sharl and the others.

When she asked Sharl, Sharl took the girl's hand and brought her in front of us.

"This is Alisha-chan, who became my friend just now!"

"I also became friends with her."

"Oh, you've made friends already. That's great."

"Yeah."

Sharl, who brought the girl, introduced her as her new friend. It seemed that Via had also become friends with her.

"Alisha-chan, nice to meet you. I'm Charlotte's father."

"And I'm her mother."

"Thank you for becoming friends with Sharl. Let's get along."

"Haha, please come and play at our house."

"Oh, um..."

When Shisilly and I spoke to Alisha-chan, she blushed and replied with her head down. I thought she might be nervous if a first-year elementary school student suddenly met her classmate's parents, so I tried to speak as gently as possible, but it seemed she was still nervous.

She replied with a blush, looking down.

"I'm Octavia's father."

"And I'm her mother."

"!!"

When Aug and Ellie spoke to her, Alisha-chan suddenly raised her head.

"U-Um, nice to meet you! I'm Alisha, the eldest daughter of the Kusaku family of Weimar!!"

...

She stumbled.

She stumbled a lot.

Alisha-chan blushed, with tears in her eyes, and continued to look down.

Hey Aug, she stumbled, but she made a proper greeting. Stop holding back your laughter and give her some support.

I thought, and glared at the Crown Prince and Princess, who were trying not to laugh.

Then, Ellie cleared her throat and spoke to Alisha-chan.

"Thank you for your very polite greeting. You've become friends with Via, haven't you? She doesn't have any same-sex friends other than Sharl. We're glad you can get along."

She said with a gentle smile. Alisha-chan, who had made a major stumble and was embarrassed, seemed to regain her composure after hearing Ellie's words and seeing her expression.

"No, no! I should be the one to say that! Um, well..."

"What's the matter?"

"Is it really okay for someone like me to become a friend of Princess Octavia?"

Alisha-chan seems to be quite humble about herself. Or rather, how did she become friends with them?

"Hmm? Did you force her to become friends, Via?"

"I didn't do anything like that. Please don't say rude things, Father."

When Aug said that, Via-chan pouted and turned away. It seems that Aug couldn't get the full story from Via's actions, so he decided to ask the person directly.

"Miss Weimar."

"Yes!"

Perhaps because she was spoken to by Crown Prince Aug, Alisha-chan stood at attention.

"What led to this?"

"Well, um, it's, uh..."

In response to Aug's question, Alisha-chan turned pale and struggled to find the right words.

This kid is talking to us in the same way as usual. We're used to it, but for her, Aug is the Crown Prince. It's impossible not to be nervous when addressed by someone from the Cloudland. Besides, this child is a first-year elementary school student, you know? Ah, she looks like she's about to cry any moment now.

I was thinking about offering some reassurance when an unexpected person spoke up.

"Alisha was watching over Sharl. She thought Sharl was cool, so she asked to be Sharl's friend to stop Sharl from going wild. Then Via said if she's Sharl's friend, she's also her friend."

Oh? Rain, who is usually very independent and doesn't pay much attention to others, is supporting Alisha-chan?

"Rain... You spoke so much...," Rain's mother, Chris, seems to be oddly moved.

But it's indeed unusual. Alisha-chan, who probably didn't expect such support, looks surprised as she watches Rain.

"Is that so? Miss Weimar, are you okay with that?"

"Yes!"

"I see, then I won't say anything more. Please take care of both Sharl and Via."

"N-No! I should be the one saying that! Thank you very much!"

Alisha-chan, who was asked to take care of Via by Aug, lowered her head deeply, almost as if her face would touch her knees.

But this development was a bit unexpected.

"It's surprising that it was Rain who offered support, not Max."

I said, and Max, who hadn't spoken until now, smiled at me.

"Just reading the situation."

"The situation? What situation?"

"It's a secret."

Eh... What does that mean? It's strange. Has everyone suddenly grown up too much just because they became elementary school students? Sharl, well... she hasn't changed much...

I was feeling a mixture of joy and loneliness as I watched the children grow, but suddenly I remembered something.

"By the way, Alisha-chan, where are your parents?"

"Ah..."

Due to the unexpected encounter with the Crown Prince, Alisha-chan had completely forgotten about her parents and began to look around for them.

"Oh, I remember..."

It seemed she found her parents, and when I looked to where her gaze was directed, I saw an older man and woman with their mouths wide open, looking in our direction. The Count and Countess of Weimar, I presume.

I approached the Count and Countess of Weimar to express my gratitude and greetings for becoming friends with my daughter. In the end, Aug and the others followed, so the Count of Weimar remained tense throughout.

Learn to read the room like Max, seriously.

"Is that you, Count Weimar?"

"Yes, that's me."

Perhaps because Aug was there and he was nervous, the Count of Weimar seemed to be anxious even talking to me.

"It's nice to meet you, I'm Shin Walford."

"Yes, I'm aware."

"I understand that your daughter has become friends with my daughter. Thank you."

"No, not at all! Thank you very much!"

He's definitely quite nervous; his voice is really loud. I wonder if the Weimar family gets loud or stammers when they're nervous?

"Count Weimar, your daughter has also become a friend of my daughter. I should be the one thanking you."

"Haha! Your Highness, it's too humble of you. I always remind my daughter to be respectful to Princess Octavia."

"Oh, there's no need to be so formal. I would prefer if you treated her as an equal friend."

"Well, those are very gracious words. I am deeply grateful."

...Huh?

Even though the tone is formal, isn't Count Weimar less nervous when he's talking to Aug compared to when he was talking to me? Why is that? As I pondered this, Countess Weimar, who was speaking to Shisiry and Ellie, approached.

"Count Weimar is a noble, so he must have met His Highness at the royal palace."

"On the contrary, Mr. Shin doesn't come to the official places at the royal palace, so he's a rare character for the nobles to encounter, right?"

What's a "rare character"? When did I learn that word? ...Was it Alice?

In any case, it seems that I was the only one who was meeting them for the first time. Well, if that's the case, it's natural for them to be nervous. I was just starting to accept that when Ellie sighed for some reason.

"Well, if Mr. Shin is fine with it, then that's good."

What does she mean?

I tilted my head at Ellie's words, and then Countess Weimar called out to me.

"Um, Mr. Shin."

"Oh, yes."

Since I was addressed, I responded, but usually, people address you with "Mr." when they meet you for the first time.

Well, I do have some awareness that I hold a fairly important position in this country, but my status is that of a commoner. Nevertheless, people here keep addressing me with honorifics and titles, so I've gotten used to it.

It's not a good trend, but I've started to get used to being addressed like that by everyone I meet.

While trying to stay alert, I faced Countess Weimar, who had called out to me.

"Is there something you need?"

"Um, well... "

Countess Weimar blushed and began to fidget.

Hey, Shisiry is right there, so please stop acting like that.

Somehow, it's getting chilly with Shisiry around!

As I thought that, she took something out of her handbag.

"Um! Could you please sign this for me here?"

She had taken out a notebook and a pen.

Oh, it's just an autograph.

"Yes, of course."

For a moment, the atmosphere became a bit strange, so I was relieved that it turned out differently. Without thinking too deeply, I signed in the notebook handed to me by Countess Weimar.

This was a mistake...

"Oh! Sneaky, you! Mr. Shin, I want an autograph too!"

Even though his wife was getting an autograph from another man, Count Weimar, her husband, not only didn't object but also extended his own notebook and pen.

"Oh, um, sure."

"I want one too!"

"Please, sign mine as well!"

Since I casually signed the notebooks of Count Weimar and his wife, the people around me also swarmed around me, requesting autographs.

"Wait a minute, everyone! Calm down!"

I asked Shisiry for help, but she just smiled wryly. Aug shrugged his shoulders with an "Oh, well" expression, and Ellie looked exasperated.

Adults are no help!

I thought so and sought assistance from the children.

"Dad is quite popular."

"That's right."

"As expected of Uncle Shin."

"Rain, you can't fall asleep here."

"Mm..."

"Oh my..."

Shal and Silver, the siblings, were just watching with smiles. Vee-chan was looking at me with an odd sense of admiration. Max was supporting Rain, who seemed about to doze off while standing. Alisha was flustered.

I don't have any allies here!

In the end, I ended up signing for almost everyone present.

Phew, my hand is tired...a database schema
