In the training aimed at instructing various countries on how to use the Vibration Swords, the biggest concern was the training in the Darm Kingdom, which has concluded successfully, albeit with a peculiar chief military officer in charge. Now, only Karna and Kurt remain for training.

Today, Karna visited, and there was someone Shin knew.

"I've been waiting for you, Shin."

"Long time no see, Mr. Galan."

Galan, the head of Karna's national shepherds, welcomed him. In Galan's hands was the Halberd, a weapon that Shin had seen before.

"So you're going to bestow this as well..."

"Yeah. This Halberd is the symbol of the National Shepherds. We can't use any other weapon, and we don't want to."

As Shin had suspected, that Halberd was indeed the symbol of the National Shepherds. Everyone had a matching Halberd. However, there was one concern.

"Hmm... this weapon might be a bit too thick..."

"You can say that, but like I said earlier, we National Shepherds can't use anything else. We've never used swords or anything like that."

"Well, you've never tried, so there might not be a problem."

"Are you sure?"

"It's the only way to know for sure."

When bestowal is performed on the spot, such issues may arise. If Galan and the others from the National Shepherds couldn't receive bestowal on their weapons, Karna's military power would take a significant hit. After all, in Karna, the ones boasting the strongest military power are not the soldiers; they are the shepherds.

"Alright, I'll get started with the bestowal right away."

"Sure, we're counting on you!"

Shin greeted Galan and entered the prepared bestowal tent. Come to think of it, the military personnel haven't spoken to me. Galan appears to hold a significant position among the National Shepherds, but is he really a crucial figure in Karna? Well, never mind that. For now, it's all about bestowing the weapons. As usual, a large number of weapons were prepared, not just the Halberd used by the National Shepherds.

In the end, the bestowal effect worked flawlessly on Galan and the National Shepherds' Halberds.

But well... Galan was swinging his Halberd and cutting practice logs, and he said, "This thing is amazing!" So I thought the bestowal was working effectively... Honestly, I couldn't tell whether the effect was being realized or not from an outsider's perspective.

Shepherds... they're too strong.

And then, on the following day, after Kurt's training was completed, all my weapon bestowals were finished. What remained was practical training. Initially, we planned to provide individual instruction, but the real challenge was swinging a sword while activating a magic device. Since I was able to do that, it was decided that it would be too much of a bother to continue providing guidance, so the latter half of the week was left completely open.

Miranda had been wearing a gloomy expression, thinking she had to provide combat training. But now, she looked very pleased. I wonder if it was that much of a burden for her...

Now, with this unexpected free time, there is something I need to do. It's a promise I made with Director Dominic. To make the words I uttered— that I would definitely win against Strom— come true. Honestly, the magic I'm considering as the ultimate weapon is something I have no intention of using after this battle. It's a highly dangerous magic, and it was a spell I had no intention of trying until I realized it had the ability to ignore the laws of physics regarding the direction of magical effects.

But this is the final battle against Strom. If we lose this battle, Strom declared that he would go on to destroy the world. And heading to the old imperial capital surrounded by high walls, now known as the Magic City, are the world's elite. If we are defeated, there will be no force capable of opposing Strom in the world. The enemy that mercilessly killed all the people of the Empire, from royalty and nobles to common citizens, is him. Mercy is not something we can expect. We absolutely must win. There is no time for hesitation. I need to try everything to ensure that nothing is left undone. To be honest, having this extra time now is a good thing for me. There are two things I want to try this time. First, that magic. Since it's too dangerous, I can't try it in the usual wasteland. The location for experimenting with this has already been decided, so it should be no problem... I think.

And one more thing.

Honestly, I'm not looking forward to this.

I don't want to do it, but I don't want to regret later that I should have tried everything.

Sigh This will be the only time for this verification.

If I can defeat Strom safely, I'll never do it again.

...But still, I have some resistance...

"Has Shin been acting strangely?"

"Yes... Your Highness, do you know anything?"

"I can't say I do... For the past week, he's spent more time with Claude than with me, you know? Can't think of anything in particular. So, how has he been acting?"

"Well... he started muttering to himself recently."

"Muttering?"

In the private chamber of August in the Arlsheid Royal Castle.

For this rare visit to August's private chamber, Shishiry was accompanied by Elizabeth, who is August's fiancée, to avoid any misunderstanding about her being alone in a man's private room.

It seems Shishiry came to August for advice about Shin. The topic of her consultation is that after the guidance on using the Vibration Sword was completed and the subsequent combat training was canceled due to time constraints, Shin began muttering to himself.

Shin had been completely exhausted from applying an excessive amount of bestowals, so Shishiry was concerned and had been with him for a week. However, there had been no signs of unusual behavior during that time.

Despite the consultation being about Shin starting to mutter to himself, August took it very seriously and listened with a sincere expression.

Elizabeth, who was listening nearby, found the situation strange and couldn't help but smile.

"Just wait a moment, Shishiry. I thought you came to see August-sama for something serious, but you're saying it's because Shin-san started muttering to himself... You worry too much."

"So? What kind of things is he muttering?"

"Well... something about magical power and particles..."

"Magical power? Particles? What is that?"

"I have no idea."

"Hey, hey, both of you, don't ignore me."

Elizabeth protested to Shishiry and August who were continuing their conversation without paying attention to her.

She understood that both of them were completely serious, but she couldn't grasp what was making it such a grave issue.

"Uh, sorry, Ellie-san. It's just that I'm a bit too concerned..."

"It's just that he started muttering, right? We're betting humanity's fate on the next battle, aren't we? He's not feeling the pressure?"

"You're too soft. Ellie doesn't understand Shin at all."

"...August-sama, it seems you understand quite well, don't you?"

"Don't tease me. Shin isn't the type to crumble under pressure. His mind is surely occupied with how to defeat Strom."

"So, do you think that thought is coming out of his mouth?"

"Claude and I think so. And based on our experience, when he's thinking of something new... nothing good has ever come of it."

"...It's the first time he's been muttering, so I wondered if he was thinking of something outrageously unconventional..."

Up until now, Shishiry had unquestionably accepted everything Shin did. It was Shishiry who finally made that comment.

Elizabeth, who had realized the gravity of the situation, immediately turned pale. She suggested to August that they should question Shin right away.

"...Questioning might be excessive, but it would be good to hear the circumstances."

"Yes, let's subtly inquire."

Merely questioning him about his muttering may seem like a routine procedure. However, Shin's actions up to this point had made him entirely untrustworthy. Even Shishiry didn't oppose the idea of inquiring into the situation.

August and the others decided to subtly ask Shin about it.

Sorry, but both of you, please don't ignore me.
Elizabeth protested to Shishiry and August, who continued their conversation without acknowledging her.
She understood that both of them were entirely serious, but she couldn't understand what made it so serious.
"Oh, I'm sorry, Ellie-san. I was just a bit too concerned..."
"Just because he's started muttering, right? We're betting humanity's fate on the next battle, aren't we? He's not feeling the pressure?"
"You're too soft. Ellie doesn't understand Shin at all."
"...August-sama, it seems you understand quite well, don't you?"
"Don't tease me. Shin isn't the type to crumble under pressure. His mind is surely occupied with how to defeat Strom."
"So, do you think that thought is coming out of his mouth?"
"Claude and I think so. And based on our experience, when he's thinking of something new... nothing good has ever come of it."

"Oug came over to our place. And for some reason, he brought Ellie with him."

"What's up? Did something strange happen again, leading to misunderstandings?"

"No, Ellie just said she wanted to come and play for a change, so I brought her along."

"I see. Is this Ellie's second time visiting my place?"

It had been a while since he visited on our birthdays last time.

"Yeah, it's been a while!"

I wonder... Ellie's behavior is kind of strange.

"If Ellie comes to visit, she usually goes to my house or Maria's. She gets nervous visiting a man's house, you know?"

"T-that's right! Please don't mind it!"

I kind of understood through Shishiry's explanation.

It's easy to forget given her past actions, but Ellie's family is the highest-ranking nobility, the Duke's family. You could call them an almost royal family. She's a purebred noble lady, and besides her fiancé Oug's home in the royal castle, I don't think she's ever been to a man's house.

When she came last time, it was a party, and there were many other guests, so I guess that's why it was fine.

I understand that, but even though they're at a man's house, Oug is here, and they've done various activities together, so she doesn't need to be so nervous.

"I see. Well, Shishiry is here too, so you don't need to be that nervous, right?"

"Yes, I'm not nervous at all!"

No, she's totally nervous.

"Don't worry about Ellie. By the way, you've been through quite a bit this time."

"Hmm? Oh, yeah, there were so many weapons to enchant... I was even enchanting in my dreams..."

That was really tough...

"I see. Well, if you were able to enchant them all successfully..."

This time, when we had to perform a large number of enchantments, I told Oug and Mr. Dis about the automatic enchantment device I created. Mr. Dis, who we had asked to make it for us, didn't say anything, but his face twitched a bit. Oug didn't say anything either, as his father was also the king, so he remained silent.

Well, it was an emergency.

Moreover, does bringing up that topic mean that he came to console us?

"With this, the soldiers should be able to fight on equal terms with the disaster-level monsters..."

At that point, Oug interrupted and looked directly at me to continue the conversation.

"...How about our side? Can we really fight on equal terms with Schtrom?"

So, that was what he was concerned about.

"Yeah... I've been thinking about various things, but..."

As I said that, Ellie, who had been strangely nervous all along, stiffened even more. Moreover, Oug and Shishiry also became tense.

"W-what's wrong?"

"It's nothing. So, what are you thinking about?"

"Oh, right... Oug, have you ever thought about magic itself?"

"Magic itself?"

"Yeah. Like why there is such a thing as magic in this world... and so on."

When I said that, the three of them looked puzzled and exchanged glances.

"Why there is such a thing? It's hard to answer that... It's just something that exists, right? I can't use magic, but I would be troubled if magical tools couldn't be used."

"That's right. Magic is deeply integrated into our daily lives, so we've used it naturally for a long time."

"What about you? Have you been thinking about such things?"

Lately, I've been thinking about something.

I've been thinking about what magic really is. What exactly is magical power?

I arrived at this line of thinking because I had a certain question about magic.

This question was related to Oug and the others' way of thinking about magic.

"Oug and the others said they used magic by devising their incantations until they heard Grandpa's magical training method, right?"

"That's right. When I think about it now, it's painfully clear that it was an easy and incorrect way of thinking."

"...But it may not be completely wrong."

"What do you mean?"

"Think about it. Oug said he hadn't done much training in magical power control, but he could use quite a bit of magic through incantations."

"Yeah, that's right, but why?"

"What do you mean by 'why'?"

Oug and the others made a huge leap in their magical abilities after they learned the proper magical training method from Grandpa.

This process involves creating a scientific image of magic from my side, but I had the wrong fundamental training method.

However, I could use reasonably powerful magic.

When everyone was impressed by Grandpa's words, I was shocked in the opposite sense.

"Why... how could you use reasonably powerful magic without training in magical power control?"

"...Indeed... why?"

"Why, you ask... why is that?"

"I have no idea."

Oug seemed to have noticed something but was left with a vague feeling without an answer.

Shishiry had no clue, and Ellie, who couldn't use magic, had never even considered the question.

"Indeed, it's like that."

"Yeah... I never thought about it at all. Why is that?"

My question seemed to pique their interest, and even Grandpa and Grandma joined the conversation.

"Do you know, Lord Merlin and Lady Merida?"

"That's right... in our era, we were taught to train magical power control, and then use it to cast spells."

"I thought that when incantations became mainstream, it was thanks to Merlin that an easy method became popular... But Shin is right."

Even the so-called 'Wise Men' like Grandpa and 'Scholars' like Grandma had never thought of such a thing.

"What about other people? Can Marica and Steve also use magic?"

"Yes. We have some knowledge as it's useful for doing household chores... But we've never thought about why powerful magic can be cast through incantation."

"I, as a butler, have the knowledge to use magic for combat in emergencies and protect the master... But I've never thought about why incantation enables powerful magic."

"None of us have ever thought about why incantations allow for powerful magic."

Other maids and butlers nodded in agreement.

My question was exactly about that.

There was someone in the past who admired Grandpa's magic.

That person wanted to use Grandpa's magic but didn't have the skills. So they tried to imagine Grandpa's magic and created an incantation, and they could use a similar kind of magic. I heard that this was the reason incantations became the mainstream.

"Grandma, was the person who created incantations based on your magic as skilled as you?"

"No, they were someone whose name I had never heard of."

"So that means they didn't have magical control skills as good as yours, right?"

"Yeah... But with clever incantations, we could indeed use similar magic..."

That's what's strange.

"Why can you use magic beyond your own abilities just by adjusting the incantation?"

"I'm stumped... It's a fundamental question. I wonder why we didn't realize it..."

My question seemed to be something that no one had noticed until now.

In the era of the past reincarnated individuals, which was not the age of incantations, there might not have been such a question.

However, a change occurred in the magical world after the person who admired Grandpa appeared.

That change led to incantations becoming the mainstream.

As a result, this unerasable question arose.

"Magic can be invoked just through imagination. But it also works through incantation. That's fine. But I still think it's strange that you can use magic beyond your own abilities."

Oug and the others, as well as the servants who usually just silently observed us, began discussing the matter with each other and a little confusion arose.

It was a problem that everyone had failed to notice, but it turned out to be a significant issue.

"Shin, by raising this issue to such an extent, do you have any answers or hypotheses related to it, or something you know? Is that why you've been pondering it to the point of muttering to yourself?"

"Muttering to myself?"

"Shin, you've been muttering to yourself a lot lately, right? So I thought you were thinking about something important..."

"Huh? Seriously? Did I say it out loud?"

Lately, I've been thinking about this and new magic non-stop, so I must have slipped up.

However, the people around me, including Grandpa and Grandma, seemed more focused on Oug's question, which suggested that I might have a conclusion, rather than the fact that I was muttering to myself.

I could tell their looks were demanding answers.

"Ah... It's still just a hypothesis, and I haven't proven it yet. Is that okay?"

"No problem. Even if it's a far-fetched hypothesis, it might bring a new wind to the magical world."

"Plus, it's Shin we're talking about, so it's probably a reasonably logical hypothesis, right? There's nothing to lose by listening."

Encouraged by Grandpa's continued passion for improving magic and Grandma's trust in me in her own way, I decided to share the hypothesis I've been thinking about for quite some time.

"Magic, right? It's about gathering magical power from this world, controlling it, creating an image, and then activating it."

"Yeah, that's magic."

Grandpa agreed when I explained the basics of magic.

"Well then, what's an 'image' to begin with?"

"What do you mean...? It's the mental picture you create, isn't it?"

Oug answered my question.

"An image is a mental picture... So, that means magic is responding to our 'minds,' right?"

"That does make sense. Responding to our 'minds'... Huh. I've never thought about it that way."

"Shin, you're amazing for thinking about something like that."

Grandma and Sishirley expressed their admiration.

I believe that the idea that magic responds to our 'minds' is crucial for resolving this question.

"Changing the subject a bit, what do you think about words?"

"Of course, words are a means of conveying one's intentions to others."

"Why are you suddenly asking something so obvious? What's going on?"

Words are a means of conveying one's intentions to others.

Sishirley and Oug exchanged puzzled looks, wondering why I was suddenly discussing something so straightforward.

However, this is important.

"Can the impression words give differ depending on the speaker? For example, some convey passion and inspire, while others might be so dull that they put you to sleep."

"That certainly happens, ye. Back in my student days, I used to doze off during the teacher's lectures quite often."

"You were a troublemaker in your student days, after all."

"Well, I'm not like that anymore."

While Grandma seemed concerned about something, that conversation would have to wait.

"Grandma, I'll listen to that story later. More importantly, if we put magical power into words with our 'intentions'... what would happen?"

I looked at everyone as I said this.

"What if we imbued 'intentional words' with magical power? How would that turn out?"

Everyone had a sudden realization at that statement.

This might be the correct answer.

'Kotodama.'

A word often heard in my previous life in Japan.

Words have power, and what you speak becomes reality.

So, what happens in this world with real magic?

It's likely that the past magician who admired Grandpa inadvertently put this into practice.

As a result, even magic that doesn't match one's actual ability could be triggered by the power of 'Kotodama.'

"Perhaps that's what chanting is. Words imbued with intention have power, and even with poor magical control, the power of words might cause magic to activate. I believe this is the mechanism behind using magic that doesn't match one's true ability... but what do you think?"

I said that and looked around at everyone, who all had astonished expressions.

"You've... you've reached quite an extraordinary conclusion... So, it's intentional words..."

"...I always thought of 'imagination' as just the things that come to mind in the heart... Words were just meant to complement that imagination."

"Power is indeed conveyed through words... That's true."

"Shin, you're really amazing..."

"Shin, what kind of mind do you have?"

While everyone voiced their admiration, Ellie's evaluation was peculiar.

It's not surprising that no one else realized it. The concept of 'Kotodama' is unique to Japan and is said to be untranslatable into foreign languages. In a completely different world, the idea that words can carry power might be inconceivable.

Even the servants had impressed expressions. However, Ellie, who had given an odd evaluation earlier, was the only one who seemed less convinced.

"If using chants allows you to use magic more powerful than your actual ability, wouldn't it be better to chant all the time?"

It was a question only Ellie, who couldn't use magic, would ask.

"It has its pros and cons. If the purpose for using magic is clear, I believe that chanting to activate the magic will increase its power, for example, in civil engineering tasks."

"So the power does increase, right? Then..."

"But in battle, it doesn't work like that."

"Battle?"

It seemed that Ellie was unaware of anything related to combat.

"By chanting, it becomes apparent which magic you will use next. Moreover, by putting it into words, you can only create a single image, and there's no room for adjustments."

"Even when you're healing, sometimes you come across unexpected injuries. In those cases, you have to respond immediately without chanting."

Oug and Sishirley explained to Ellie, and she seemed to understand. In other words, while the overall magical output increases, it becomes less versatile.

"So it depends on how you use it, and both good and bad results can occur."

"That's why Shin said it might not necessarily be a mistake."

"Exactly. Chanting is not inherently bad. It can be extremely useful depending on the circumstances."

This is one of the things I don't want to do but have to verify. I've been too embarrassed to use chanting for magic before. However, I can't just keep avoiding it. So, reluctantly, I decided to try it. But... it's still embarrassing.

"You made another incredible discovery about magic. But you can't use it in combat, right? Why are you worrying about it before the decisive battle with Strom?"

Oops, Oug noticed something important.

Ideally, I wanted to ignore that. "Well, there were various reasons..."

"That's not an answer. Are you seriously thinking of using it in battle at this point?"

Why is Oug so sharp? He's spot on. "Um, I sort of intend to."

"Nonsense. What on earth are you thinking..."

With that, Oug stopped moving. "You don't mean to... use a magic spell with so much power that it wouldn't be a problem if it got exposed..."

"No, it's just..."

I couldn't provide a clear answer to Oug's words. I am indeed considering using a spell with power strong enough to make me hesitate. Moreover, I believe Strom won't be able to discern the content of the chant. This is the second thing I need to verify. However, it's difficult to explain my reasons for thinking Strom won't understand, without referring to my knowledge from my previous life. Should I try to deceive him?

"I'm not entirely sure. I haven't experimented with it yet."

Upon saying that, Oug let out a deep sigh, as if exhaling all the air from his lungs.

"This is the kind of experiment we would only consider right before the final battle against Strom and the other magical beings... but I suppose it can't be helped this time. However, I want you to promise one thing."

"What is it?"

"Absolutely do not use it to destroy the world."

"What...?"

I wanted to retort with something like "What nonsense are you talking about?" but Oug had a very serious look on his face, and everyone else looked equally serious. So, instead of shouting as I usually do, I responded to Oug's words.

"I understand. I'll make sure to experiment in a way that doesn't lead to that."

I was glared at by Oug for a while, but he finally seemed to be convinced, and he sighed deeply again.

"Geez... I don't know whether to feel reassured that you're reliable or to lament the fact that I have to run around covering for you again..."

"Wait a moment, Shin. Please do not take away our time with August-sama."

"Yeah, yeah, sorry about that."

With Oug's words, the tense atmosphere relaxed. Finally, everyone could let their guards down, and they all started talking.

"Magic responds to the heart... There's no doubt about it."

"Right. This would explain why some people who excel in healing magic are bad at offensive magic."

"Is that so?"

Grandpa and grandma raised points that they had never considered before, prompted by my hypothesis.

"Well, it all comes down to the state of the heart. Those who excel in healing magic often fear hurting others, and I think that's reflected in their hearts, weakening the power of offensive magic."

"Those who are more belligerent tend to excel in offensive magic, I suppose."

Thanks to my hypothesis, it seemed that the experts in magic referred to as "Sages" and "Guides" had many things come to their minds. Everyone nodded in agreement as they discussed various aspects.

"Um, does that mean that healing magic responds to a kind and gentle heart?"

"That's right."

"And offensive magic responds to a more aggressive heart?"

"Exactly. The power of magic can also increase when one is trembling with anger."

For Ellie, who couldn't use magic, all of this must have sounded very fresh. She asked various questions about the effects of different emotional states, and both grandpa and grandma, as well as I, answered her. However, there was one question that none of us could answer.

That question was...

"So, how does magic respond when one is filled with deep sorrow or hatred?"
