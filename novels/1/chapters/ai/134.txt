After August unleashed a preemptive spell, the first ones to charge forward were Maria and Miranda's team.

"Now, Miranda, show the results of your special training!"

"S-Suddenly facing demons makes me nervous... But I'll do it!"

"Miranda warmed up earlier, right? You've got this!"

"Yeah!"

In comparison to Miranda, who seemed quite desperate, Maria appeared more relaxed. This was because Maria believed in Miranda's abilities.

During the period when everyone was putting effort into preparing for demon combat, Maria had also started training with the goal of challenging demons alongside Miranda. She had taken down numerous monsters for their training purposes. These monsters were...

"...Stronger than calamity-class demons, but compared to the wild fear they instilled, they were nothing!"

These monsters had been created by Strom's animal experiments. Initially, Miranda had rejected the idea as too much for her. However, Maria had convinced her to join, and as a result, they became capable of taking down calamity-class demons together. This achievement was attributed to several factors, including receiving the Vibrations Sword from Shin and receiving training from Michelle.

Since the year-end birthday party for Shin and his friends, Miranda had been training continuously with Michelle. When she reached her second year, she finally managed to claim the top position. As a result, she had the title of Knight Academy's top swordsman and wielded the Vibrations Sword, making her one of the most powerful frontliners in the current Earlsheid Kingdom.

Nonetheless, even Miranda, with her considerable skills, would find it challenging to fight trained demons alone. Hence, her partnership with Maria was essential.

"Now, it's my turn!"

As Miranda advanced toward the demons, Maria stopped mid-way and launched a fire spell at the demons.

"Ugh!"

With a loud explosion, the spell hit its mark, but the demons also raised magical barriers to shield themselves. Since the demons who were originally capable of using magic became demonified, Maria's spells were completely blocked.

However, Maria's magic was of the fire element. It inflicted more than just a physical impact.

"Ugh... Such intense heat!"

"Quite a temperature!"

The demons reacted as they felt the scorching heat of the flames.

The magical barrier could block magical attacks, but it couldn't entirely protect against the resulting heat.

The heat emanating from Maria's magic caused the expressions of the demons to contort.

"However..."

"We blocked it! Now it's our turn!"

The demons managed to defend against Maria's magic and prepared to counterattack. But when they exclaimed "Too late!"...

The demons, who had been focused on Maria's flashy magic, missed Miranda, who had charged ahead earlier.

As a result...

"What!?"

"S-So fast!"

"Noooo!"

Miranda, using her jet boots for rapid mobility, approached the demons and swung her sword twice at high speed. She used a close-quarters sword technique that emphasized speed, as a regular sword wouldn't have inflicted fatal injuries, even with such rapid strikes.

However, Miranda was wielding the Vibrations Sword.

"You fool..."

"Ugh!"

The demons she lightly struck were cut in half, and they died with expressions of disbelief.

"You!"

"How dare you!"

The demons who saw their allies fall unleashed their magic toward Miranda, but she was no longer there. After killing the two demons, she had already withdrawn using her jet boots.

It meant a swift one-strike-and-retreat tactic, but...

"Hey! It's too hot! My skin got burnt!"

Miranda's true feelings were that she couldn't endure the aftermath of Maria's fiery magic.

"Fine! I'll use something that won't be hot!"

In response to Miranda's complaint, Maria opted for a non-heat-based spell.

"In that case... how about this!"

Maria selected a spell involving wind or rather, a tornado.

The raging tornado swept through the group of demons.

"Ugh... Don't underestimate us! Something as trifling as a tornado..."

Maria's tornado spell, from the perspective of blowing away the opponent, was quite potent. However, it wasn't a spell that defeated the enemy with just the force of being blown away.

But there was something more to Maria's spell...

"What's this?"

"Rock fragments!? Damn! What a dirty trick!"

Maria attacked the demons by lifting stone fragments with a violent storm caused by the tornado.

"Darn it! The magical barrier can't protect against stone fragments!"

"Form a circle! Switch to physical barriers!"

One should not underestimate stone fragments. Stones lifted at high speeds by the tornado were akin to bullets. The stone fragments carried a deadly force as they attacked the demons.

The demons desperately defended against the stone fragments, leaving Miranda astonished.

"What are you doing, Miranda? Dive in!"

"Are you crazy? I can't charge into something like that!"

In front of her was a tornado so intense that even demons could barely manage to defend themselves. Charging into such a maelstrom might lead to severe injuries, even with her magical defensive gear.

Miranda had her own set of defensive magical tools. However, the mere fact that she could wield the Vibrations Sword while using her magic was impressive. Coordinating the simultaneous activation of multiple magical tools was impossible.

As a result, Miranda had to wait until the tornado subsided.

"Miranda!"

"Huh!?"

"These darn brats!"

Currently, they were in the heart of the battlefield. Demons who had not been engulfed by the tornado took the opportunity to attack. Realizing that she was their target due to Maria's warning, Miranda activated her jet boots for high-speed movement, evading the demons' magic.

"You tricky little...!"

"I underestimated mere magical tools... I never thought they'd be so troublesome."

The demons were not just idly waiting for Shin and the others to arrive. Being former Imperial intelligence agents, they had gathered information about the magical tools Shin's group possessed. However, there was a difference between observing and confronting them. Seeing someone move in front of them at a speed they had never experienced before caused them to misjudge their aim.

"Phew, that was close..."

Having avoided the demon's magic, Miranda retreated to Maria's side.

"Don't let your guard down anymore."

"Maria's doing something different from usual!"

"Well, they're demons! If you don't use stronger magic than usual, it won't mean anything!"

"That's true, but with this, all our practice was pointless!"

"You're a knight! Just charge in with determination!"

"Don't say reckless things!"

Despite being in the midst of battle, the two of them were playfully interacting.

The demons watched this scene with mixed feelings. They wanted to complain, but the ones being toyed with were them.

These young girls were causing such trouble for them.

These thoughts fueled the demons' anger.

"Oh, the tornado is gone."

Miranda looked towards the location pointed out by Maria. After the tornado had vanished, what remained were...

"Haa... haa..."

"This... you..."

The demons were battered and bruised, their bodies in a state of turmoil.

"They're quite resilient, aren't they?"

While they had dealt substantial damage, they hadn't completely defeated the demons. However, Miranda, who was tasked with delivering the finishing blows after the magical attacks, charged at the demons.

"Don't underestimate me! It's this brat!"

The demons attempted to use magic to halt Miranda's advance. But...

"Huuh!"

"What the...!?"

The magic launched by the demon was not blocked by a barrier but rather nullified by Maria's magic.

"You're using magic to counter magic!?"

"That's ridiculous!"

The demons were momentarily stunned by this surprising turn of events. However, even during that time, Miranda continued her attack.

"Oh no!"

"Shh!"

Facing the weakened and wobbling demons, all Miranda did was swing her Vibrations Sword. With that simple action, she defeated multiple demons. Afterward, she swiftly retreated using her jet boots, rejoining Maria.

"Huh? Were the demons we fought last time like this?"

Maria, who had previously experienced a situation where they lacked a decisive advantage and were stuck in a stalemate, tilted her head in bewilderment at how easily they had defeated the demons this time.

"Like this... I was really on the edge. If I let my guard down, I'd be finished in no time."

Miranda, who was facing demons in battle for the first time, still maintained a sense of tension when confronting them.

Observing Miranda's demeanor, Maria understood something.

"Oh, maybe it's because Miranda's here."

"Huh?"

"Just the fact that Miranda is here makes such a difference."

"What... are you talking about?"

Sudden praise caught Miranda off guard, and she blushed unintentionally.

Observing the unconventional interaction between the two amidst the battlefield, one of the demons muttered,

"...These monsters."

Though it was a quiet mutter, it undoubtedly reached the two.

"Both of you...!"

Trembling with determination, Maria heightened her magical power, and Miranda gripped her sword once more.

And then...

"Who's the monster here?!!"

In a fit of rage, Maria unleashed her magic, breaking through the demon's magical barrier. Meanwhile, Miranda, who had reached the demon on her own, promptly dispatched it.

In the end, the coordination between the two didn't serve much of a purpose.
