The day before invading the Demon Lord's domain.

The Earlshyde army was camped near the border with the Demon Lord's domain, close to the former imperial territory.

Earlshyde, a country of significant size compared to other neighboring nations, was able to mobilize tens of thousands of troops for this military operation without the assistance of Els or East.

In the Earlshyde army, a unique measure was taken that was not seen in other surrounding countries: the mobilization of students from the Knight Academy and the Magic Academy.

Although they had formed a World Union and there were no issues in terms of military power, these students had been undergoing exceptional training in demon hunting since before the summer break, and they had already achieved the feat of defeating numerous demons.

Seeing this as a good opportunity for the students to gain real combat experience rather than just training, several hundred of them were allowed to accompany the army on their march.

However, even though they had defeated many demons in training, it was still just practice, and this time it was a real operational mission. Moreover, it was a worldwide operation involving multiple countries.

"Klaise, you seem to be quite reserved. Are you nervous about facing demons?"

"Miranda, huh... Well, I've hunted demons extensively during training, so I'm not that nervous. But this is a global-scale operation, and that's what's making me nervous."

Students, including Klaise, the top student of the Knight Academy, appeared to be tense. Until now, there had been no precedent for sending Knight Academy students to the battlefield. But now, they were being sent into a simultaneous worldwide operation. Despite their experience in demon hunting, it was only natural for them to be nervous.

"You seem quite composed. Is it because you've heard about Maria's struggles? I don't think I'm in such a prestigious position."

Compared to demon hunting, participating in the operation was more nerve-wracking for Klaise. However, Miranda, the top student in her first year at the Knight Academy, didn't show any signs of nervousness.

Curious about her composure, Klaise asked, and Miranda mentioned an unfamiliar name.

"Maria?"

"Don't you remember? Well, you guys were quite taken with Wolforde's girlfriend during the joint training... Now she's his fiancée. Besides her, there was another girl."

Bitter memories of getting his hopes up for Sicily, only for Shin to win her over in an instant, resurfaced, and Klaise felt somewhat down.

"Christina-sama... Yes..."

They encouraged each other to find good men.

In the midst of this, Christina noticed something.

"Oh? That sword..."

"Oh, yes. It's an Exchange Sword that I purchased from the Walford Trading Company."

"I see. It's something that's issued when you enlist in the military, so I was wondering. Did you buy it yourself?"

"Yes, at Maria's recommendation. Also, this."

Saying that, she looked down at her feet.

"Hmm. You've already bought Jet Boots too."

"Maria said she was going to buy them, so I got a pair too. We worked part-time together hunting demons, and I've become quite proficient with them."

"I see. That's wonderful, Miranda. Your determination to bridge the gap in strength with Shin and the others, without giving in to despair. I hope others can learn from your example."

While Sicily was preparing for her wedding at Shin's house, Maria, who was left behind, had been deepening her friendship with Miranda.

It seemed that, before meeting a good man, she had met a good female friend.

"Well... Compared to the responsibility Maria took on, I'm nothing."

As a friend who was crucial to this operation as an Ultimate Magician, Miranda's position made her feel somewhat inadequate, especially when she considered senior knights and those accompanying the students.

Rather than nervousness, she felt more self-doubt.

"Do you want to become stronger?"

"Yes. At the very least, I want to be able to proudly say that I'm Maria's friend."

In Miranda's eyes, her determination to become stronger and be of help to her friend was clear.

"Well said. Miranda, I have a request for you."

"Yes!"

"You will accompany me on the front lines. I will personally train you."

"Huh?"

"Do you understand?"

"Yes, thank you! I'll do my best!"

"Hehe, I hope one day you'll be able to stand shoulder to shoulder with Maria."

"Yes!"

And so, among the students, only Miranda was granted a special position on the front lines.

Having delivered this message, Christina and Miranda headed off for a meal.

The sight left Siegfried and the other students who were left behind in astonishment.

"Chris and Miranda, what's with the all-girl team? And who's leading them?"

Siegfried sighed, feeling that it would be a while before spring arrived for them. It seemed that he would have to lead them on his own.

And then, the next day.

The long-anticipated campaign to conquer the Demon Lord's territory began.

"Listen up! Unlike other countries, we won't have the support of Wolforde and his Ultimate Magicians! So, if a disaster-class demon or even the Demon Lord appears, it's up to us to deal with it!"

Dominic, who had attended the departure ceremony in Darum, had been sent to Earlshyde by Shin through a gate. The soldiers were anxious as they heard Dominic's words, realizing that they would have to defeat disaster-class demons themselves.

"But don't fear it! Especially the Magic Division! You've put Wisdom-sama's teachings into practice and gained more power than ever before! I guarantee it. You are strong!"

Rupa's words inspired the Magic Division, and they let out a resounding battle cry.

While many of them seemed carefree at first glance, their eyes were now filled with determination.

"Knights and soldiers too! You've obtained new equipment, and you've learned to wield it even if it meant shedding blood... no, you've actually shed blood while mastering it. Let me say it too. You are strong!"

The knights and soldiers, driven by a competitive spirit against the Magic Division, also raised their voices in response to Dominic's words.

Conscious of each other, their morale reached its peak.

"Then let's go. March on!"

"Oooooo!"

And so, the Earlshyde army advanced into the Demon Lord's territory.

Here as well, demons didn't immediately appear, but after a while...

"They've arrived!"

"All hands, combat formation! Rupa, we're counting on you."

"Of course! Magic Division, prepare offensive magic!"

Under Rupa's signal, the Earlshyde Magic Division heightened their magical power. There was a clear difference in the scene from other countries. No one was chanting spells.

"Fire!"

Simultaneously, the Magic Division unleashed magic without chanting. The magic, released carefully to avoid offsetting each other's effects, was on a scale unlike any they had used before.

"Incredible..."

Students from the Magic Academy gazed with admiration at the Magic Division, which had cast high-powered magic without chanting.

"Hey, what are you guys so impressed with? The magic of your peers, Shin and his friends, is beyond that."

At Siegfried's words, the high-ranking students of the Magic Academy fell silent.

Two-thirds of the students from the Magic Academy participating were Shin's seniors, and the remaining third were in the same year. The former were crucial to this operation, responsible for dealing with disaster-class demons and demons.

On the other hand, they had battlefield experience under the supervision of their seniors. Their power was too disparate from their juniors, leading to a complicated mix of feelings, somewhere between frustration and thinking that being the grandson of a hero couldn't be helped.

Seeing these expressions that seemed to border on resignation, Siegfried asked them a question.

"Have any of you read the papers published by the Magic Academy?"

At Siegfried's words, the Magic Academy students looked down. By increasing the amount and precision of magical power control, one could increase the power of their magic and even use magic without incantations.

It was clear that they hadn't read the officially published papers.

"Why don't you read them? Is training only what you learn from the instructors? Shin has never missed training since he was a child. He never stopped his own contemplations. The result is the birth of an extraordinary magician. He wasn't born with special powers. He acquired everything through effort."

In reality, Shin did possess special "knowledge" in the form of memories from his previous life, but, as Siegfried put it, he wasn't born with special "powers."

Hearing those words, the Magic Academy students' determination returned to their eyes. It was frustrating, but if they could achieve that through effort, then they could too.

With that determination in their eyes, they responded with a firm "Yes!" and headed to the battlefield.

"Now, Knights of the Knight Academy."

Siegfried turned to face the Knight Academy students, but...

"...I don't understand knights."

Without Christina present, he couldn't speak about the knowledge required to be a knight.

Seeing the Knight Academy students looking slightly disappointed, Siegfried continued.

"I don't understand knights, but you guys are in the same boat. You can only train based on the instructors' directions."

Once again, the Knight Academy students hung their heads.

"Without Christina here, I can't give you specific instructions, but..."

Siegfried looked at everyone and continued.

"Learn from Miranda-chan, the cause of Christina's absence."

The Knight Academy students suddenly perked up at those words.

"Miranda-chan wants to stand shoulder to shoulder with Maria-chan. She bought a sword herself, got jet boots, participated in actual combat through monster hunting, and worked hard on her own. Why can't you do the same?"

They believed that their instructors would guide them. They thought that by training according to the instructors' instructions, they would become stronger.

"It's common for students, but both the Magic Division and the Knight Division actively acquire new techniques and equipment to become stronger."

Siegfried said this and then shifted his gaze to the battlefield.

There, knights wearing heavy armor and using jet boots were flying around in a way they had never seen before.

"Heh, this is quite a sight. Are you guys okay with this? If you continue like this, you'll be left behind by the Knight Division and Miranda-chan, you know?"

Upon hearing those words, the Knight Academy students seemed to have made a decision.

"We've also been through extensive training in monster hunting! What's the use of being a burden? We're going too!"

"Ooooh!"

A student who seemed to be a leader among the third-year Knight Academy students shouted, and the Knight Academy students also rushed to the battlefield.

"Well, well. I guess I should follow and provide support."

After motivating the students and sending them off to the battlefield, Siegfried prepared to follow them, but...

"Disaster-class monster appeared!"

He had been prepared for it, but he didn't want to hear that report.

"Tch! Of all times!"

He abandoned the plan to follow the students and headed towards the disaster-class monster. And there, he saw...

"...What's that? A rhino?"

In this world, there were several animals that were thought not to transform into monsters. Humans were believed to be one of them, and there were other examples like rhinos, elephants, and whales, which were thought to remain unaffected because humans could control their mana willingly. They were easily recognizable by their size.

Gigantic in size, large animals were assumed to remain non-monstrous.

"What the hell is that?"

There, he encountered a monstrous rhino, which was as massive as a two-story building.

"Hey! What is that? I've never heard of a rhino transforming into a monster!"

"Bad news! Get away for now!"

"Ah! Don't run in the front direction!"

It seemed that the soldiers scurrying around in front of the massive creature had irritated it, and it charged forward.

"Get out of its path! Jump to the side!"

Siegfried shouted instinctively, and the soldiers who were in the rhino's path activated their jet boots and moved out of the way.

If they hadn't been equipped with jet boots, the situation might have been very different.

Nevertheless...

"Agh! Damn it, this guy!"

Several soldiers who had been close to the rhino from the beginning were unable to escape in time and were caught in the rhino's charge.

Given its enormous size and the apparent weight, their chances of survival looked bleak.

Even those who had been farther away from the rhino were abandoning the monsters they were dealing with and simultaneously moving away from its path.

Everyone here was using jet boots to retreat.

The soldiers scattered like a swarm of spiders, but the monsters remained in place. Then...

"Whoa! The monsters are being trampled..."

The soldiers shoved aside the abandoned monsters and crushed them, while the rhino monster continued its charge.

"This is... something extraordinary."

"Chris, were you all right? Is Miranda-chan safe too?"

"Yes!"

Siegfried called out to Christina and Miranda, who had appeared next to him.

It seemed that both of them had escaped unharmed.

"What are we going to do?"

"What we're going to do? Well, I've thought of something."

"You have an idea?"

"Well, just watch."

Without answering Christina's question, Siegfried returned to the battlefield.

Finally, the charging rhino came to a stop. Siegfried checked behind him and then cast a spell.

The magic Siegfried unleashed with all his might had even greater power than the first spell cast by the Magic Division. However...

"Tch! What tough skin it has. It doesn't seem to be taking any damage... Oh!"

The rhino monster charged at Siegfried again after he had cast the spell. Siegfried activated his jet boots to avoid it, looking at the rhino's path.

"Oh, it's being trampled."

When Christina had asked about their plans, Siegfried hadn't been checking if there were soldiers behind him. He had been checking for the presence of monsters.

Perhaps due to its enormous size, the rhino monster couldn't change direction or stop suddenly once it started charging.

Having trampled other monsters in its path, Siegfried thought of taking advantage of the situation to clear out the other monsters.

The operation results seemed to be excellent.

"Have they diminished significantly?"

"Siegfried-sama, you're amazing! The number of monsters has decreased so much!"

"Sieg, you..."

"What's up?"

"...Isn't your way of thinking becoming more like Shin's?"

"Huh? Seriously?"

Upon returning to Christina and Miranda, Siegfried received sincere praise from Miranda, while Christina mumbled that the strategy resembled something Shin would come up with.

Upon hearing this, Siegfried couldn't hide his shock.

In any case, Siegfried's strategy seemed effective. Observing this, the soldiers started imitating Siegfried's tactics, guiding the rhino monster to trample other monsters as well.

Different soldiers tried to herd the monsters to a single location, where the rhino monster would charge in again.

It seemed that the other monsters could be managed this way.

"The problem is the creature itself..."

"Sieg's full-powered magic was easily deflected."

"Ugh! It's a naturally tough-skinned animal, even without monster transformation. After the transformation, it gained an incredible defense!"

"But... what should we do then?"

Hearing Siegfried and Christina's conversation, Miranda asked how to break through the situation.

"Well, its skin is thick, but the joints shouldn't be, right?"

"In that case... is it our turn?"

"Attacking the joints with our swords. There's no other way."

"Us...?"

While it was protected by a very hard skin, it couldn't have tough joints for charging and the like.

The legs and neck should be included.

So, there was no other option but to thrust a sword directly into its neck.

"Well, we'll keep it occupied. Take the opportunity to get close to its neck."

"Keeping it occupied... is that even possible?"

"Yeah. I followed Shin on his hunts, and it's come in handy."

"Is this something Shin used to do? Then, it should be fine."

"Huh? That simple, huh?"

Siegfried came up with the idea of keeping the creature busy after following Shin on his hunts, and Christina approved the plan. Miranda, who had witnessed Shin's power, also calmly accepted it.

"All right, then. Come this way!"

Once again, Siegfried cast his magic and lured the rhino monster toward them.

Observing the charging rhino monster, he activated another spell. As a result, a large earthen wall appeared in front of the rhino monster.

"There's no way it'll stop with that wall!"

Upon realizing that the method to stop the rhino monster involved an earthen wall, Miranda let out a despairing cry.

"I see. So that's how it is."

"What do you mean?"

"You'll understand when you see it. But more importantly... everyone! The rhino monster will stop soon! Prepare to attack!"

Christina, who believed that the monster would be stopped by the wall, issued orders.

Miranda didn't doubt Christina's words, but she couldn't fully believe it. And then...

BOOOOOOM!

The charging rhino monster effortlessly destroyed the earthen wall.

"Ah!"

It was just as Miranda had feared. But what happened next left her in disbelief.

The earthen wall wasn't created out of thin air; it was made from the soil on the ground. Naturally, this meant that a significant hole had formed where the soil was taken from.

A pitfall trap lay beyond the illusionary wall. The rhino monster, with no way to avoid it, became entangled in the pitfall trap and tumbled down.

"Uwaaah! Go for it!"

"I'm coming! Follow me!"

Roar!

Siegfried, who had given the command while shrouded in the dust kicked up by the monster's fall, and Christina, who relayed the command to the knights, were perfectly synchronized.

The knights, attacking the rhino monster one after another with their jet boots, caught up with the fallen beast.

Among those knights was Miranda.

"Here I come!"

She thrust her sword with all her might, but despite its slightly thinner skin in comparison to the rest, it wasn't easy to pierce.

"Ugh! It's so tough!"

"Out of the way, miss! Raaah!"

From the side, a knight with a muscular physique thrust his sword as well.

"Darn it! It's so hard!"

"At this rate, it will get up again soon! Quickly!"

The fallen rhino monster was thrashing about, having been surrounded and attacked by numerous knights.

As Christina mentioned, it seemed like the rhino monster would soon get back up. However, it was still thrashing, making it difficult for anyone to swing their swords.

The ground beneath them shook. Was there a way to resolve this? Miranda pondered and then remembered something.

"Everyone, step back!"

"Huh? What..."

In response to Miranda's words, a knight stepped back and witnessed...

Miranda activated her jet boots, soared into the sky, and descended towards them with her sword pointed downwards.

"Whoa! Don't be reckless!"

"Here goes!"

Miranda felt that holding the sword in her hands wouldn't transmit enough force, so she placed her foot on the sword's guard and thrust it into the rhino monster's neck from above.

The sword tip successfully pierced the rhino monster's neck, an area that had previously only received minor scratches.

"Wow! You did it, young lady!"

"But it still hasn't reached... Argh! The sword is stuck!"

Though she had managed to pierce the skin, the sword was now firmly lodged in place. She desperately tried to pull it out, but then she remembered something.

"Oh, maybe I should detach it."

With the sword still lodged in the rhino monster's neck, she performed the distinctive detachment action of the Exchange Sword.

Then, when she saw that the sword's hilt had disappeared, she remembered something else. With her foot on the sword's butt, she jumped into action.

"Miranda, what are you..."

"Hiiiyah!"

She activated her jet boots at full throttle. As a result, the sword that was lodged deeply in place by the jet boots' force pierced all the way to the hilt.

BOOOOOOM!

The sword had now penetrated deeply into the critical area – the neck – causing the rhino monster to writhe in agony. However, the sword was still relatively small compared to the monster's body, so it wasn't yet a lethal blow.

Nonetheless, they had found an opening.

"This is effective! We're doing it too!"

Having witnessed this, the knights took to the air, descended, and thrust their swords in coordination.

"Whoa! Be careful! You grazed me!"

"Sorry! My fine adjustments..."

An accident occurred where another knight descended near the first one, but the sight of the once-unyielding rhino monster's neck taking in one sword after another showed that they were making progress.

As the following knights thrust their swords and exchanged blades, Miranda, who had exchanged her blade first, descended from above once more.

"Here I go!"

She thrust the blade into the rhino monster's neck, detached the hilt, and used her jet boots to drive it in even deeper.

The rhino monster, which had already been pierced by several swords and was gasping for breath, trembled significantly and then fell silent.

"Oh...?"

"How's it looking?"

Knights who were now dealing with the subdued monster called out to those below.

"Silence of the Catastrophic Class confirmed! It's been vanquished!"

The knight inspecting the monster's condition confirmed that they had vanquished the Catastrophic Class monster.

"Whoa!"

The soldiers excitedly raised their voices at the prospect of defeating a Catastrophic Class monster by their own hands.

"What are you celebrating for? There are still more monsters out there!"

"Whoa!"

Dominic shouted at the exuberant soldiers, but they, driven by their heightened spirits, moved on to the remaining monsters for a sweep.

"You don't need to go. Take a little rest."

"Director Dominic!? B-but..."

Miranda, swaying on her feet, was about to join the monster vanquishing effort when Dominic stopped her.

Miranda was surprised to be addressed by the head of the Ersheid Army. However, while the others were heading off to battle the remaining monsters, she felt uneasy about resting, as she was the only one not contributing to the effort.

"Just rest. You're still a student, aren't you? You helped vanquish a Catastrophic Class monster. It's only natural to feel a bit shaky."

This was the second time she had seen a Catastrophic Class monster. However, unlike the time when Shin overwhelmed them during the joint training exercise, she had participated in the vanquishing this time. Her exhaustion was more mental than physical.

"Nevertheless, you did great. It was a splendid performance."

"Th-thank you very much!"

Miranda felt grateful for Dominic's encouragement.

"Descending from the sky... I'm impressed you came up with such a method."

"W-well, it was actually Maria who..."

"Maria?"

"Director, she's friends with Maria von Messina, the Ultimate Magician."

"Really? I had no idea!"

Dominic tilted his head in puzzlement as Miranda nervously mentioned the specific name. Christina provided additional context.

"Well... after buying the jet boots, I used them to practice and also took up a part-time job hunting monsters with Maria. My allowance wasn't enough, so I borrowed money from Maria..."

As a student who didn't receive a salary, her only income was from her parents' allowance. However, it wasn't enough to buy magical equipment like swords and jet boots. So, during the summer break, she hunted a large number of monsters, borrowed money from Maria, who had a reasonable amount of money, and took on a part-time job in monster hunting to repay it and get used to her new equipment.

"But isn't it dangerous for students to take on part-time jobs as monster hunters?"

"Maria was with me. She said she was getting tired of dealing with only Catastrophic Class monsters lately..."

"...She's been hunting Catastrophic Class monsters casually?"

Dominic's concern was valid, but Miranda's friend who accompanied her was skilled enough to take down Catastrophic Class monsters single-handedly. So, there was nothing to worry about.

"Back then, Maria was doing something like a 'jump thrust' and said Wolfrid was doing it too. The idea of using the last jet boots to push it in came to me on the spur of the moment."

"So the origin of that was Wolfrid... What's up with that guy? I feel like I can understand him with just that."

"Director, don't worry. I do too."

"I'm convinced as well. But even my pitfall was originally from Shin, so what's going on in his head, I wonder?"

Miranda recalled that Maria imitated what Shin had done. As Siegfried mentioned when he approached Miranda and the others, the pitfall from earlier was also imitated from Shin's hunting. How many tricks does he have up his sleeve? Miranda once again realized the extent of Shin's abilities.

"Anyway, that strategy is extremely effective. You did really well. Leave the rest to the other knights and take a good rest for now."

"Th-thank you very much."

With that, Dominic returned to directing the situation on the battlefield. As the top military leader left, the tension lifted, and Miranda felt lightheaded.

"Oops, are you okay?"

Siegfried caught Miranda as she staggered.

"I'm f-fine! Just fine!"

Her words were a bit incoherent.

"Looks like you're a bit tongue-tied... All right, I'll take you to the main camp."

"W-wait, what!?"

Siegfried held the swaying Miranda, and she reacted with a surprised exclamation.

In a state where her fatigue was attributed to her inability to speak properly, Miranda was held in a cradle carry. It was a princess carry right on the battlefield.

"Siegfried-sama! Uh, well..."

"Heroes must be properly rewarded."

"Meow!"

Miranda squirmed in embarrassment being princess-carried in front of everyone, but Siegfried didn't put her down.

"Sieg, are you planning to slack off?"

"You're annoying! You're pushing all the student work onto me! Work a bit yourself!"

"Ugh... You're right, Christina-sama!"

Thinking that Christina would surely stop Siegfried's actions, Miranda let out a cry of despair.

"Listen, Miranda. You are much more exhausted than you think. I understand that you want to be on the battlefield while the excitement is still there after defeating the Catastrophic Class monster, but for today, please rest quietly. Sieg, I'm counting on you."

"I know without you telling me."

"Huh? I-I didn't mean that!"

Miranda stopped Christina, and she was gently advised that she had misunderstood and was not going to the battlefield. Moreover, the way it was phrased sounded like they were asking Siegfried to keep taking her with him.

As a result, she was carried all the way to the main camp without being put down. Though she couldn't help but feel happy about being princess-carried by the person she admired, she wished it had happened at a different place.

On the way, various people praised her for a job well done, but she only wished they wouldn't come so close to her in her current state.

"So, Miranda-chan, make sure to rest properly, okay?"

"I-I will..."

When she was brought to the relief station at the main camp, her head was already boiling, and she couldn't give a coherent response. However, as time passed, she gradually calmed down. Ironically, the earlier panic had made her calm down, and suddenly, a certain question crossed her mind.

She had been doing part-time jobs hunting monsters to repay her debt to Maria and also because she was getting decent income from it. But she hadn't encountered any Catastrophic Class monsters in the past, and as soon as she entered the Demon Realm, an animal that had never been believed to turn into a Catastrophic Class monster appeared.

Was this just a coincidence?

Because she had been told to rest and not move around, she couldn't do anything about it now.

Unable to dispel the sudden fear that attacked her as she moved her body, Miranda's inexplicable anxiety continued to grow.
