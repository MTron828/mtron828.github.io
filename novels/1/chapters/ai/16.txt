The next morning, I immediately went to Sicily's house.

When I opened the gate to the spare room prepared at Sicily's house, Sicily and Maria were already waiting inside.

"Good morning. I was already waiting."

"Good morning, Shin. I couldn't keep you waiting since you came to pick us up."

"Good morning. I couldn't sleep well, so I woke up early."

It seems like they are already ready, so let's go right away. But before that, I should greet Sicily's parents.

They are in the dining room, so I leave the room and go to greet them.

"Good morning, Cecil-san, Irene-san."

"Oh, good morning, Shin."

"Hello, Shin."

Both of them greeted me. Cecil-san is wearing a suit, which is different from the formal attire for yesterday's entrance ceremony. He has a scarf around his collar, and his appearance makes him look very handsome.

"Hmm? What's wrong, Shin?"

Oh, did I stare too long? I was a bit rude, maybe?

"Oh, I'm sorry. I just thought you looked very stylish and cool. Are you heading to work now?"

"Hahaha, thank you. Yes, I'm going to work. And this outfit was chosen by my wife; I couldn't look this stylish on my own. I don't pay too much attention to clothes."

"Oh, Ufufu, thank you for the compliment, Shin. Should I pick out clothes for you too?"

"Oh, no, that's alright."

"Oh, don't be shy."

While Irene-san was laughing, she spoke to me.

"Shin, it's time to go. Your father is also ready to leave for work."

Sicily urged me to go quickly.

"Oh? Sicily, you're in a hurry."

"What's the matter, Mother?"

"Oh, it's nothing."

"Come on!"

I've never seen Sicily like this before. It seems like she has a different face when she's with her family. She looks so lively.

"Shin, let's go!"

"Alright."

Sicily grabbed my arm, and we left the dining room.

"Well, well, Ufufu."

"Sicily has grown up..."

I heard such voices from behind as we headed to the designated room.

The two guards are with us. Julius is still the same old samurai.

"Ah, good morning."

As we continue to greet everyone, Alice rushes in.

"Hey, did I make it in time? Is it okay?"

"You made it, but... is it okay to arrive at school on the first day of class just in time?"

"Well, you see, I couldn't sleep last night because I was looking forward to today's class, so I overslept."

"Are you a child!?"

Even though she's fifteen, which is considered an adult in this world.

"Good morning, everyone. Let's start homeroom. Take your seats, everyone."

While we exchange these words, Professor Alfred arrived. It seems like he was just in time.

"Everyone is here. So, good morning again."

"Good morning."

"Now, let me inform you of today's schedule. As I mentioned yesterday, we'll be touring the academy in the morning. After lunch, we'll have our first magic practice. I'll guide you there shortly, and we'll meet at the first practice area. You don't need to bring anything special... although it seems everyone can already use dimensional storage. Truly deserving of the S class. That's all for today's announcements. Does anyone have any questions?"

There are no bags on everyone's desks, which means that everyone can use dimensional storage. Among the students I saw on the way to school, some were carrying bags, so not all magic users can use it. Whether or not you can use dimensional storage seems to be one of the guidelines for becoming an S-class student, I feel.

The academy we were led to has two main buildings. One is the building with classrooms. There are four classes for each grade, with first-year students on the third floor, second-year students on the second floor, and third-year students on the first floor.

The other building houses the staff room, student council room, as well as various laboratories and research rooms for clubs.

These clubs are, in a way, similar to extracurricular activities. There's the "Offensive Magic Research Club" that focuses on honing offensive magic, the "Quality of Life Improvement Club" that creates various magical tools using enchantment magic, and the "Physical Enhancement Research Club" that specializes in strengthening body-enhancing magic, among others.

...The last one, what's that all about? You're doing it wrong as a magician! And when Julius heard about that, his eyes were shining. Just as I thought!

"I would very much like to join that club, Your Highness, if not for my duty as your guardian..."

"What's the matter? You can join even without my permission."

"No, it's not that simple."

"This is a prestigious magical academy. Your royal authority doesn't hold sway here. I have no power to bind you to me."

"But..."

Note: The text you provided is somewhat challenging to translate accurately as it contains some cultural and context-specific elements. If you have further questions or need clarification on any part, please feel free to ask.

"Well, it's just within this academy, so you can do as you please."

"Your Highness... I am deeply grateful."

Og is expressing concern for Julius. I honestly think this kind of place is amazing.

Thinking that, when I look at Og, he's smiling slyly.

Ah! Is this guy trying to distance himself from being a guardian because he's annoyed by it? Julius, you're being deceived!

"Og... you..."

"Hm? What's wrong, Shin? Are you interested in joining a club or something?"

"No, it's not that, but..."

"I see, I understand. I thought none of the existing clubs would satisfy you. How about starting your own club?"

"Huh?"

I was caught off guard by this sudden suggestion. He's clearly trying to brush off the topic.

"Well, a club created by Walford could be interesting."

Just as I was about to question Og, Professor Alfred goes along with Og's idea.

"That's right, Professor. I'm curious about what kind of club Shin will create and what activities he'll do."

"It's certainly intriguing."

Even Lynn, who doesn't talk much normally, has joined in.

"I'm interested too! If you create one, I want to join!"

"I might want to join too."

"I want to join as well. If we're in that club, we'll probably stay in the S class."

"Professor, how can we create a club?"

"If you have five or more members and a teacher as an advisor, you can submit an application to establish a club."

"Then we also have to come up with a name for the club."

Everyone starts talking eagerly. What is this? It looks like we're unknowingly about to create a club.

"Hey, everyone, wait a moment..."

"If Shin is going to create a club, I have to join too, right?"

"Huh? Oh, yeah, I guess so?"

Sicily has also started saying things like that.

"Then how about this? What if we call it the 'Hero Research Club'? Shin can teach us about Merlin and Merida!"

"What's that?"

"We already have one like that. We study and discuss stories, settings, and the source materials behind them. We research how to reach the heights achieved by Merlin and Merida."

"We already have one!?"

Seriously!?

"Well, too bad."

"Deciding what kind of club to create can wait until after the afternoon class."

"That sounds like a plan. Let's decide then."

"Well, in that case, when the time comes, those who want to join should come forward with the application forms."

Decision made! They made a decision without even considering my opinion!

"Hey, could you please not decide things on your own?"

"What's wrong? Do you still want to join a club?"

"Is it still the Hero Research Club?"

"No, it's just that I know too much about it..."

"Walford, I think it's a good idea. You're already quite famous, so I can easily imagine various clubs trying to recruit you. Choosing one from them would be a daunting task, right?"

"Well, that's true, but..."

"And as for the advisor, I'll do it. Most of the members will be from this class. So there shouldn't be any problem with this."

"That's right, Shin! Let's do it!"

"Sigh... I understand."

So, it was decided to establish a club rather reluctantly. How did it come to this?

"Hehe, looking forward to it, Shin."

That's right! This guy must have steered the conversation in that direction!

"Og... you..."

"Come on, let's finish the rest of the tour and then grab some food."

"Yes!"

In the end, I couldn't press Og further. Og kept laughing with Cook. Og...

After touring the school building, we headed to the practice area. The academy has three practice areas, and the one we used for the entrance exam was the second practice area. The others apparently used the first and third practice areas.

The first practice area is said to have the most robust magic barrier among the three. It is mainly used by the S class and higher-grade students.

Finally, we went to the cafeteria. As we had been all over the place, it was already lunchtime, so we had our lunch in the cafeteria. As I mentioned before, the cafeteria is free, but the menu is quite impressive.

You pick up a tray and choose dishes that are placed on plates in a line. There are multiple options for meat, fish, soup, salad, and various types of bread. New students often end up overeating and struggling in the cafeteria, which has become a tradition, I was told.

Alice and Julius also joined this tradition.

And now, it's time for the afternoon magic class. Everyone looked a bit nervous, but at the same time, they had excited expressions. When Professor Alfred arrived, we all lined up and waited for the class to begin.

"Alright, is everyone here? Then let's begin the first class at the Advanced Magic Academy."

"Yes, please teach us!"

"That being said, the first lesson is already set. We'll have you use the magic you demonstrated during the entrance exam."

I could feel the tension in everyone's bodies dissipate.

"Alright, let's get started right away. Yesterday, we did introductions based on the entrance exam rankings, so today, let's go in reverse. Rittenheim, you're up first."

"Understood."

It's starting with Julius... I've been curious about what he did.

"Alright, here I go!"

He said, and his body began to envelop with magic power. And then...

"Woaaaaaaahhhhhhh!!!"

With the use of body enhancement magic, he literally flew from the starting position.

"Take this!"

Then he punched the target with his magic-enhanced fist.

...Can this be considered a magician's magic?

But this is quite impressive. Taking such actions to clear the exam...

Looking around, everyone was in awe. Thor put his hand to his forehead and sighed, while Og was holding his belly and laughing.

Julius' display was so impressive that it seemed challenging to follow, but everyone did.

As expected of the S class. Everyone destroyed their targets. Sicily, who said she was better at healing magic, and Yuri, who claimed to be better at bestowal magic, were no exception. Everyone had excellent control over their magic.

"Now, lastly, Walford."

"Yes."

If it's the same as during the exam...

I produced the usual pale blue flames.

"No incantation!?"

"I've never seen blue flames before..."

"It's beautiful..."

Then I fired the flame bullet.

Kaboooom!

The flame bullet that destroyed the target hit the magic barrier on the wall, shaking the practice area. Is it the same as during the exam?

"This is... amazing..."

"This is... the hero's grandson..."

"It's incredible. I didn't expect it to be this amazing..."

Everyone was left speechless. Maybe I overdid it because I went last.

"Good, that should be everyone. While I asked you all to demonstrate your magic to showcase your current abilities, it's also for you to see various types of magic. As you know, magic doesn't activate without a proper image in your mind. That's why incantations are used to help, but it's easier to understand when you see the magic with your own eyes. Besides, you can get advice on the magic you want to learn. Normally, the teachers provide this advice, but we've all become classmates now, so it's good to learn from each other."

I see. It's a great idea to help each other improve as classmates.

"Now, that concludes our first magic practical lesson. It might feel short, but it's only the first day. Be prepared for more classes in the future."

"Yes!"

"Now, the class is over, but as I mentioned this morning, we need to submit the club registration form. Waldford, you'll be the president. Who wants to join?"

"Yes!"

"Good, all members of the first-year S class, as I expected. Now, all that's left is to decide on the name of the club."

I'm moving forward without being able to express my opinion.

"Oh? Julius, are you joining too?"

"Yes, I am. With a club run by Lord Shin, it seems like I can master body enhancement magic."

"...Tch."

Og, don't click your tongue!

"I've got a good idea now."

Lynn raised her hand.

"Oh, what's the name?"

"How about the 'Ultimate Magic Research Club'?"

Ultimate Magic Research Club!?

Ouch! Lynn-san, that's painful!

However, the reactions from everyone were surprisingly positive.

"I see, 'ultimate.' That might be perfect for Shin."

"Yeah. If it's Waldford-kun, he can probably use all sorts of attack magic that can annihilate everything, unbeatable defense, and maybe even teleportation magic."

Lynn was quite talkative when it came to magic.

Sorry, it's not teleportation magic, but I can use Gate.

"That's great! 'Ultimate Magic Research Club'! It sounds amazing!"

"It does sound amazing, but... just being a part of that club might be pressuring..."

Maria seems to be unexpectedly sensitive to pressure. But I don't like that name...

"It looks like it's decided. So everyone, write your names on the registration form, and finally, Waldford and I will sign it."

In the end, the club was established without asking for my opinion.

'Ultimate' is a bit much...

While Shin and his friends were struggling with the club name at the academy, in the royal castle, the monthly regular meeting of department heads was taking place. At this meeting, each department head reported on the monthly activities. However, among these department heads, the head of the Military Affairs Department had a concerned expression.

"Now, next is the Military Affairs Department... What's the matter, Dominique? Do you have any issues to report?"

"Yes, Your Majesty. Actually, when I was reviewing this month's operations, I stumbled upon something unexpected."

Dominique Gastol, the successor to Michel, was the Knight Order Commander and the Director of Military Affairs. The Military Affairs Department consisted of the Knight Order and the Mage Corps, with the Soldiers' Corps falling under the Knight Order. The position of Director of Military Affairs alternated between the Knight Order Commander and the Mage Corps Director each season, and this season was the Knight Order Commander's turn to serve as the Director.

The robust Knight Order Commander had a troubled expression on his face, making the surrounding civil officials nervous.

"Indeed, the number of monster appearances has significantly increased over the past year."

"What!?"

Unexpectedly, this report led to consternation among the various department heads.

"What do you mean? I've never heard of such a sudden increase in monsters."

"Indeed, if there were a proliferation of monsters, it should have caused quite a commotion throughout the nation. However, there haven't been any rumors or talk of such an event."

They spoke one after another. Monsters were considered an extraordinary phenomenon in this world, a problem that needed to be dealt with on a national level. An increase in the number of monsters was devastating news. However, there were no such rumors or discussions circulating in society. So what did the Director of Military Affairs mean?

"It's not unreasonable to find it unbelievable. We were also unaware of this situation. We can't argue against being called careless. However, this is a fact."

"Dominique, what exactly is going on?"

"During the preparation of this month's regular report, the person in charge mistakenly submitted last year's report. We quickly noticed the mistake and reprimanded the responsible party. But then, when we looked at the submitted report... we noticed a clear increase in the number compared to the same month last year."

"What!?"

"That's... how could you not notice it for a whole year?"

"Doesn't the Military Affairs Department have daily reports? Why wasn't this noticed?"

"It was precisely because of those daily reports!"

"What? What do you mean?"

"We couldn't figure out why we didn't notice, so we reviewed all the past daily reports. The result... was that it was increasing, albeit slowly, little by little, just within the margin of error, but it was definitely increasing."

So, Dominique explained why they hadn't noticed it.

"However, won't the burden on the monster subjugation teams increase as a result? How did you not notice that either?"

"When I asked the person in charge, they mentioned that they didn't notice it. It's likely that the increase occurred so gradually that even the person in charge became accustomed to it."

The atmosphere, which had been tense due to the report, somewhat eased.

"In other words, we can handle it now. There's no problem, right?"

"That's not the case. While we can handle it currently, it's a fact that the number of monsters is undeniably increasing. Moreover... this is just my personal impression, but it feels artificially induced."

"Nonsense! Are you saying that someone is intentionally increasing the number of monsters?"

"It's just my personal impression. However, I believe you'll share the same impression once you see this data."

With that, he had his assistant distribute the data. When the department heads saw the data, they all frowned.

"Your Majesty, honestly, this is an abnormal situation. We need an urgent investigation. Could we have permission for a large-scale inquiry?"

"Indeed, this is a serious situation. Agreed. The Knight Order, the Soldiers' Corps, the Mage Corps, and the Monster Hunter Association should all participate in a thorough investigation."

"As you wish!"

"Also, this matter is to be kept top secret. No one should speak of it until we have accurate information."

"Understood!"

Only the department heads knew about this matter so far, but an indescribable sense of unease had settled in their hearts.

And that night, in a certain noble's mansion:

"Kurt! Kurt, are you here!?"

The master of the mansion, Russell von Ritzburg, shouted in a furious tone.

"What is it, Father?"

"What is it? That's not how you should address me! Today, I was summoned by His Majesty and the department heads. Do you understand why?"

When asked, Kurt sighed.

"What's on your mind? Using one's status in the Three Great Advanced Academies is strictly prohibited, you know that, right?"

"I understand your point, Father, but the problem is with the law itself! We are the chosen people! It's the fact that we are treated as equals with commoners that's absurd!"

"Kurt... What are you...?"

Russell regarded his own son as if he were a different being. He couldn't understand what his son was saying. This was not the son he knew.

But the agitated Kurt wouldn't stop.

"I am a chosen individual! A special person! Yet everyone treats me as if I'm insignificant! Such a thing should never be allowed!"

"Kurt..."

Russell was now convinced that his son had gone mad. Kurt continued muttering to himself.

"That's right, it's him. It's been strange since he appeared. Women don't act as they should, and even His Highness... if he's going to support him, then maybe..."

"Kurt!"

Crack!

Russell struck Kurt with all his might. His hands, unaccustomed to striking, turned red.

"I can't overlook such statements! We must consider your punishment! Someone, take Kurt to his room! Lock him in there for a while!"

The servants who had been watching the exchange between Russell and Kurt stared at Kurt with a disgusted look, and the guards escorted him to his room.

Russell, clutching his swelling hand, muttered to himself.

"Kurt... What has happened to you...?"
