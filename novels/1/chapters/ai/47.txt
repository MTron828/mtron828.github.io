Approximately two years ago, he wasn't known as Oliver Strom.

His original name was Olivera von Stradius.

He was the head of the ducal family with the right to inherit the throne.

Despite being an imperial aristocrat, he questioned the system where commoners were exploited by the nobility. He believed in an ideal relationship between the aristocracy and commoners, similar to the Ardshyde Kingdom's nobility and commoners, and he worked tirelessly to improve the lives of commoners.

He also wanted to send common children to school. However, in order to do so, the financial situation of commoners needed to improve. Without that improvement, they couldn't afford to send their working children to school. This goal had not yet been realized, but he spared no effort to make it happen.

Nevertheless, the Stradius territory was known for being more livable compared to other regions. People in neighboring towns often discussed Stradius's efforts.

"Are you not going to take a break soon?"

"Oh, Aria. Well, the harvest in this region is lower than in other places, and I was thinking if there's something I can do about it."

Aria came to check on Olivera's work in the lord's office in Stradius City. She was wearing a loose nightdress, and her belly had grown a little.

"It's great that you're working for the people, but I'm worried about your health."

"Haha, you should take care of your health too, my dear."

Saying that, Olivera gently touched his wife's belly.

"This is our long-awaited treasure."

"Hmm, I know, my love."

Unusually for an imperial aristocratic couple, Olivera was very devoted to his wife and didn't have any concubines. Aria loved Olivera just as much, and their affectionate relationship was well-known in society. They were exceptionally popular among common people for imperial aristocrats.

Their good reputation, combined with the livable conditions in Stradius territory, led people from other less fortunate territories to dream of relocating there. This created a problem for the nobles in those territories who saw their subjects as sources of exploitation and feared a decrease in tax revenue if people left.

So, the various lords prohibited migration to other territories and prevented people from heading to Stradius territory.

However, it seemed that the more the migration to Stradius territory was prohibited, the more people wanted to go, and there was a continuous stream of individuals ignoring the treaty and moving to Stradius territory.

Since it was within the same empire and there were no checkpoints, the outflow of citizens from their territories couldn't be stopped.

Not only the local lords but also the dukes who had the potential to become the next emperor were not pleased with Olivera. The increase in subjects resulted in higher tax revenues, expanded business ventures due to increased capital, and increased tribute to the empire, which gave the impression that he was leading in the imperial election.

If this continued, Olivera would become the next emperor. And if he did, he would likely implement policies prioritizing commoners, which might mean that the privileges they had enjoyed so far would be at risk.

Their desires clouded their judgment.

Taking advantage of these thoughts was Herald von Richmond, a duke who still had the right to inherit the throne at that time.

"Everyone, thank you for gathering here."

"Yes, Duke Richmond, how may we assist you?"

"Well, forget the formalities for now. I have a request for all of you."

"What is it? Please, tell us."

"I want you to summon Stradius to the imperial capital."

"Stradius, the duke?"

"Yes, you've all had your subjects taken away to Stradius territory, haven't you?"

"Well, that's..."

"Yes, and does Stradius bother you as well?"

"Of course! He's been taking our subjects, enriching himself, and increasing tribute to the empire. His status in the nobility is undeserved!"

That's right; the nobles in the Imperial Council were non-territorial nobles. The nobles managing their territories were too busy exploiting their subjects and enjoying extravagant lives. Past lords had argued that they couldn't handle duties in the Imperial Council, so non-territorial nobles had to fill those roles.

Thus, even if Olivera pursued policies prioritizing commoners, he was living off a pension from the state and didn't feel any personal financial impact.

High regard from non-territorial nobles like this...

"At this rate, Stradius will become the next emperor."

"What?! If he becomes emperor, won't he implement policies prioritizing commoners?"

"That would be troublesome, wouldn't it?"

"We are the chosen people! Such lawlessness cannot be allowed!"

"So, you all need to bring Stradius to the imperial capital. In the meantime, I'll work to undermine his position."

"Is that really possible?"

"Yes, that's why I want you to keep Stradius in the capital for as long as you can. Any reason will do."

Following Herald's orders, the nobles, whose minds were clouded by their desires, began to consider how they could keep Stradius in the imperial capital.

"Hahaha, Stradius, your end is near..."

Herald couldn't contain his laughter as he watched the conflicted nobles.

A few days after the nobles' meeting, Olivera received a message from the nobles. They wanted him to teach them the methods to increase tax revenue from their territories, impressed by his success in managing his own land.

"Very well, I'll go."

"Yes, please be careful."

"Haha, you know my magical abilities, right? I can handle monsters that the military can't."

"Still, I worry because I'm your wife."

"Hehe, thank you. I'll be careful enough. You too, okay?"

"Yes, I understand."

With Aria's farewell, Olivera headed for the imperial capital.

The surrounding nobles also supported his ideas. If this idea spread throughout the empire, the commoners' lives could improve further, and the empire could continue to prosper.

With such hopes in his heart, he set out for the imperial capital.

In the days following, many nobles visited the Stradius Duke's mansion in the imperial capital. They listened to Olivera's methods for increasing tax revenue from his territory and showed appreciation. Olivera felt encouraged by their reactions, believing that the empire could change, and continued to stay in the imperial capital without taking a break.

Little did he know that, after hearing the nobles' stories, they were leaving the Stradius Duke's mansion and cursing, "Shameless nobles without any pride!"

Around the time Olivera went to the imperial capital, a series of incidents began to occur frequently in Stradius territory. There were numerous cases of residents going missing, and the victims included young women and children. Disappearances occurred not only during the dark of night but also in broad daylight.

The residents were filled with anxiety and fear about their children, wives, and daughters, and their distrust of Olivera, who took no action in response to these events, continued to grow.

Then, one day, a man arrived in Stradius City.

"Excuse me, can I have a moment?"

"Yes, what is it?"

The resident, approached by a well-dressed man, felt nervous. He assumed the man was likely a noble or high-ranking official, and his approach was probably related to some trouble.

"It's not necessary to be so nervous. I just have a few questions."

"What is it that you want to know?"

"Well, you see, I'm a member of the Imperial Gendarmerie from the capital. We've received information that people are being kidnapped in this city and sold as slaves. Do you happen to know anything about it?"

"Kidnappings!?!"

"Do you have any leads?"

The resident, who was asked this question, began to tell the man about the recent events that had been happening in the city.

"Well, yes... Recently, there have been a series of cases where women and children have gone missing, and everyone is quite concerned."

"Missing persons cases... I see."

"But why would someone from the Imperial Gendarmerie be...?"

"This is confidential, but it appears that the local lord of this city is involved."

"Th-the lord?"

"Shh! Keep your voice down!"

The resident couldn't believe it. He thought that their lord, who had been working for the well-being of the common people, would never be involved in such activities.

"Stradius Duke, the lord of this territory, is implementing policies favoring the commoners, right?"

"Yes, thanks to that, we have a good life."

"That's just bait."

"Bait?"

"Yes, by implementing policies favoring the commoners, he's attracting commoners from neighboring territories. In reality, he seems to be capturing the commoners he gathers and selling them."

"No way... something like that..."

"Think about it. Can you imagine imperial nobles genuinely caring about the common people?"

"Well, when you put it that way..."

At first, the resident found it hard to believe. However, he had never heard of imperial nobles genuinely caring for common people. The more he was explained to, the more the Gendarme's words seemed like the truth.

"We'll be staying in this city for a while. If anything happens, please let us know."

"All right, I will."

With that, the Gendarme man left.

(Another one has fallen...)

The resident thought with a grimace on his face.

Through the efforts of Herald's operatives posing as gendarmes, rumors of these incidents spread throughout the city and the surrounding villages. They fueled the suspicions of the residents and continued with the abductions.

Due to Herald's manipulation, the lord's residence in the city, which had received no information about such incidents happening in the area, naturally did not conduct any investigations. The frustration among the residents toward the lord, who remained completely inactive, had reached its peak.

Olivera's life in the capital, where he had never imagined such events would be happening in his own territory, had extended for nearly two months. However, since his wife's childbirth was approaching, he decided it was time to return to his domain. The nobles who had kept him in the capital for a long time also believed that two months was sufficient and allowed Olivera to depart.

After Olivera left the capital, the gendarme men approached the male residents in the city.

"Listen, everyone, we've finally got a lead on the kidnappings. The perpetrators are planning to leave this city in a carriage soon. We want to intercept that carriage, will you help?"

The residents, whose frustration had reached its peak, eagerly responded to these words.

The gendarme-posing men, who led the way to the point of intercepting the carriage, smiled and walked away. After a while, a carriage bearing the Stradius family crest approached.

When the man posing as a gendarme requested the carriage to stop, it did so without hesitation.

"We need to inspect the cargo."

"This is the Duke's carriage. Is such a thing allowed?"

"This is a search warrant personally signed by His Majesty the Emperor. No backtalk is permitted."

To be clear, this was all a charade. There was no such thing as a search warrant personally signed by the Emperor. However, the enraged residents were completely unaware.

Once they began inspecting the cargo on the carriage...

"Hey, what is this?"

"These are goods to be delivered by order of the Duke."

In the cargo hold of the carriage, there were individuals, including women and children who had been missing, bound with ropes and kept in cages.

Seeing this, the residents became convinced.

The gendarmes were right.

They had been lured like prey with sweet bait.

With this realization, the residents couldn't contain their anger.

They were determined to take action against Olivera.

That was the only option they could think of.

It was inconceivable that a ducal carriage with the family crest would transport slaves for such shady dealings. It was equally implausible that gendarmes would involve ordinary people in such an operation. The residents remained completely unaware of how they had been manipulated by false information.

As they watched the enraged residents return to attack the lord's residence, the men posing as gendarmes were laughing.

"How foolish commoners are."

"Well, they've never received an education, so what can you expect?"

"Well, that's why they dance to our tune."

Among them were the sons and heirs of nobles, who had been promised a future by Herald. They waved goodbye to the manipulated commoners and chatted with each other. Suddenly, one of them murmured:

"By the way... What should we do with these folks?"

"Yeah... let's play around with them for a bit before finishing them off."

"Sounds good."

They only saw the commoners as subjects for exploitation, and they had no intention of showing them any mercy. When the men returned to the city, they approached other residents and stormed the lord's residence.

Meanwhile, Olivera was heading back to his domain with souvenirs he had bought for his wife, whom he would see after a long time, and toys for their unborn child. When he saw the Stradius domain's city in the distance, he noticed something was amiss.

"What... What's going on there!?"

Smoke was rising from his own residence, where his pregnant wife should have been.

"Wait! Loan me a horse! Something terrible is happening! I need to get back quickly!"

At first, Olivera didn't understand what had occurred, but then he quickly dismounted the carriage, changed to a horse that some of his followers were riding, and headed toward his residence.

Olivera raced at full speed and entered the city, an unusual act considering the crowded streets. But the urgency of the situation left him no choice.

The residents noticed Olivera and started shouting, and some even threw objects. Some residents tried to block his path.

Dodging them while riding his horse, Olivera did not stop. He was determined to reach his residence.

Finally, he arrived at his lord's residence and witnessed a devastating sight.

The lord's residence was engulfed in flames.

Olivera noticed that the gatekeeper had collapsed near the gate and rushed into the lord's residence.

Inside, it looked as if the place had been burglarized. The once-beautiful interior was marred by damage and fire. Servants lay fallen in various places.

Although Olivera was shocked by the stark contrast to how it was when he left for the capital, he regained his composure and sprinted to his wife's room.

Finally, when he arrived, he found multiple men in his wife's room.

At their feet...

"Aria! Aria!!"

Shouting these words, Olivera used his magic to blow the men away. He had no consideration for the welfare of the common people.

Olivera rushed to Aria's side and embraced her. Although he was no expert, he tried to sense the presence of magical energy. But there was no magical energy emanating from Aria's body, or from their unborn child.

"No... Aria... Aria... Open your eyes, please? Didn't I tell you to be careful with your body? Didn't I promise to protect our treasure? Aria... Aria... Please..."

Olivera couldn't believe what was happening. The reality before him was hard to accept.

Why was all this happening?

Weren't these the common people he had taken care of and protected?

Why... Why did there need to be such a violent act?

He couldn't understand any of it.

"Why? Why did this happen!?"

The men who had been blown away staggered to their feet and started shouting at Olivera.

"Why? This is your fault! Your heinous actions led to this!"

Olivera couldn't understand what the man was saying.

"Heinous actions? What... What are you talking about?"

"Don't play dumb! We know everything! We know that you considered us nothing more than bait, using your sweet words to gather us! We know that you've been abducting and selling off the common people you've gathered one by one! We know it all!"

Olivera couldn't comprehend what he was hearing. He had never even considered such things.

"What is this... Why has it come to this?!"

"Don't play around! I saw it! I saw you using carriages with your family crest to transport the abducted women and children! I followed the gendarmes to their hideout!"

"...You followed the gendarmes? You, a regular person?"

"Yeah!"

"...Didn't you find it strange? The gendarmes wouldn't take regular people along..."

"Th-that's..."

"And besides... using carriages with my family crest to transport slaves?... Isn't that a ridiculous story?"

"..."

Indeed, would someone openly transport kidnapped slaves like that? Would the gendarmes bring regular people along?

It wasn't until he heard this that Olivera realized. He wasn't in the lord's residence.

Could he have just returned from somewhere else?

Could someone who wasn't even in this town have orchestrated all of this?

Maybe they had been deceived.

At that moment, the gathered commoners finally realized that they had been deceived, too.

They had done something terrible.

They regretted it, but it was too late.

Aria had already been harmed.

It was irreparable.

Olivera suddenly began laughing maniacally, and an abnormal amount of magical energy started to gather.

At that moment, Olivera was already convinced.

This was the work of a noble. It was impossible for anyone but a noble to orchestrate such an elaborate scheme, using people dressed as gendarmes, carriages bearing his family crest, and deceiving the commoners on such a grand scale.

The reason he had been summoned to the capital was also just to buy time for this scheme.

The nobles who came to listen to him didn't support his ideas at all.

And the fact that the commoners were so easily deceived by the noble's manipulation.

Olivera understood it all.

"Oh... how foolish I am. For the sake of someone as foolish as myself, who repays kindness with betrayal, I've devoted myself to the Empire, allowing nobles who scheme such trivial things to thrive..."

Saying this, the amount of magical energy gathering around Olivera showed no sign of abating.

While Olivera had always been an outstanding wizard, the amount of magical energy was clearly beyond his control.

Seeing this, the frightened commoners begged for forgiveness from Olivera.

"My lord! Please, forgive us!"

"Forgive you? Forgive the fools who committed such a foolish act? What on earth are you talking about?"

Upon hearing those words, the commoners fell into despair.

And Olivera, in response to his people's words, lost his temper.

"No, there's no way I'd forgive youuuuu!!! You, too! Those noble bastards who manipulated you! The empire that lets them run amok! All of it! All of it!! I won't forgive any of itttttttt!!!"

He shouted like this and gathered more magical energy.

With that magical energy alone, the commoners were blown away and groveled on the ground.

The magical energy gathered by Olivera knew no bounds and was further tainted by his hatred towards the inept empire, the wicked nobles, and the foolish commoners, turning black.

"A... aa... aaah..."

In the face of such a spectacle, the commoners were left speechless, unable to find the words to describe their despair.

Finally, magical energy was gathered that covered the lord's residence and spilled into the streets.

And then...

"Everything should be destroyed!!!"

...The magical energy exploded.

The explosion in the center of the town, at the lord's residence, was of an extraordinary magnitude, generating an immensely powerful shockwave.

The shockwave blew away everything in the town, extending even further into the surrounding areas.

It was impossible to believe that there had been a town here just moments ago, with buildings and people living in it.

In the center of this desolation stood only Olivera.

With his eyes bloodshot...

"Kuaaaa... Fuhahahahahaha!! Just you wait, Bluesphere Empire... I'll destroy everything... from the emperor to the nobles and commoners... all of it..."

And then, Olivera vanished, appearing in the Kingdom of Aursheid as Oliver Strom.

The magical beings who heard Strom's story were left speechless, considering his horrifying past. And they understood the reason why Strom had wanted to destroy not only nobles but also commoners.

He had been betrayed by the commoners he cherished, and his family had been taken from him.

He couldn't forgive the foolish commoners who were easily deceived and lost their loved ones, just as he had been.

"Those who left earlier were also acting without thinking, so it was a struggle to restrain my murderous intent."

It seemed like they had allowed their departure rather easily, but they were just like the foolish commoners whom Strom had despised.

Given power by Strom, they mistook it for their own strength and believed they could unite the world by using that power.

Strom didn't want to keep such foolish individuals by his side.

"Do they really understand what comes after they unite the world?"

Strom had several reasons for not embarking on a quest to unite the world. The main reason was his lack of interest, but there was one thing that remained uncertain: whether magical beings could have children.

It had been two years since he had become a magical being. Being the second magical being in human history, and the previous magical being had lost its sanity, there were no clinical results to confirm this.

What if they couldn't have children? A world ruled by magical beings would end in a single generation. And even if they could have children, would their offspring be magical beings or humans? If they were magical beings, what about the next generation? Magical beings weren't natural, and it was hard to imagine their lineage continuing.

With all these uncertainties, Strom didn't want to deal with such complicated matters.

"They probably don't understand anything... after all, they were originally foolish commoners."

The magical beings who remained behind broke into a cold sweat, realizing that Strom had spared the departing magical beings.

"Right! Shall we watch them for a while? Don't you think it'll be an interesting spectacle to see what foolish actions they take and how they'll be defeated?"

As Strom spoke with enthusiasm, the other magical beings watched him with a mixture of fear and pity in their eyes.

In the midst of this, Milia had made a decision. She had decided to propose a certain experiment.

And so, a few days later, the magical beings who had parted ways with Strom launched an attack on the nearest Kingdom of Swiede. business strategies
