 airplane turbulence
to someone who has never flown before

The party held after the medal ceremony was quite something.

Uncle Dis made an announcement, so there weren't any excessive solicitations from the nobles, like trying to marry their daughters or sisters to me. But in this country, subduing a demon is a significant achievement, and many people came to greet me and shower me with praise.

With Grandpa and Grandma by my side, there was quite a crowd. The members of the Claude family from Sicily and the Messina family's members from Maria, who already had a connection with me, seemed to observe from a distance.

I couldn't confirm anything amidst the commotion, but I heard about it later. The Augers didn't approach me either. They didn't make any advances, but they couldn't hide their smirks while watching me surrounded by women who wanted to hear my story. I noticed it.

As Aug had said before, being surrounded by unknown women wasn't particularly pleasant. Rather, it was bothersome, and their predatory looks made me uneasy.

There was no overt approach, but every time I said something, I was met with overly exaggerated reactions, and it honestly tired me out. I just wished it would end quickly and waited for time to pass.

Finally, by the time the party ended and I returned home, I was completely exhausted.

I've never been this tired from Michelle's training.

"It was definitely a good idea to have you by my side. If I had left you alone, one of those women in the crowd might have taken you home, don't you think?"

"I doubt that would have happened..."

"Who knows? Can a naive person like Shin escape from aristocratic women who are approaching their marriageable age? Even Merlin had..."

"Can we not discuss that?"

I'm really curious about what Grandpa has to say, but he's steering the conversation away.

"Shin, you must be tired today, right? We have classes at the academy tomorrow, so it might be a good idea to rest early."

Ignoring Grandpa's considerate words doesn't seem right, and I am indeed tired, so I decide to follow his advice.

"Yeah, I'll take a bath and go to bed."

"That's a good idea."

"Grandma, let's hear that story another time."

"That's not a good idea, is it!?"

Grandpa is flustered, but I'm curious, so I'll ask again sometime.

And the next day, as usual, I went to pick up Sicily and Maria, returned to my house, and opened the door...

"Oh! Shin-sama is coming out!"

"Eek! Shin-sama!"

"So, that's the new hero, huh?"

"I see, he has a good presence."

"Shin-sama! Look over here!"

I quietly closed the door.

"What is this?"

"Yesterday, Shin received the medal and the reason for it was officially announced. It was just a rumor before, but now it's official, although it wasn't officially presented due to His Majesty's consideration, so they all came to our house."

"Everyone knows the Sage's family. They probably wanted to see it at a glance."

"More importantly, I can't go to the academy like this... Grandma!"

"What is it?"

"Can I use the gate to go to the classroom?"

"Ha... I guess there's no choice. Once the commotion settles down, you should walk there."

"Alright."

"Shin... why don't you ask me for that...?"

It's scarier to be scolded by Grandma.

"Great! Today, I can go to the academy without any trouble."

"Just for today, Maria?"

"Come on, let's go."

I connected the gate to the classroom and passed through the gate.

"Wow! That surprised me!"

"What's going on, Shin? You used the gate."

"What is this magic?"

"Unbelievable. What's this, Wolforde-kun?"

In the classroom, Yuri, Aug's group, Tony, and Lynn were already there.

"Well, there were so many people in front of my house that I couldn't leave."

"Oh, so you came through the gate?"

"The gate? What's that, Wolforde-kun? Please explain in detail."

Lynn always has an appetite for magic.

"Oh, this is a magic called 'Gate.' It connects two locations through this gate. And when you pass through the gate..."

I removed the gate connected to the house and opened a gate at the edge of the classroom and passed through it.

"This way, you can come out from the other gate like this."

Lynn, Yuri, and Tony, who saw it for the first time, had their eyes wide open.

"Incredible! Wolforde-kun can use teleportation magic!?"

It's not exactly teleportation. It's a form of transportation magic.

"What do you mean?"

"Teleportation is a magic that moves the object itself, right? It disassembles the body and reassembles it at an arbitrary point. I haven't used it because I'm afraid of not being able to reassemble properly."

"Is this different?"

"It's just shortening the distance between places. It doesn't disassemble and reassemble at the entrance and exit."

"I don't get it..."

Lynn muttered sadly. Well, if she could understand this, she would be closer to her goal of being able to use teleportation-like magic.

"Well, there's no helping it. Even Grandpa couldn't understand it."

"Sage-sama..."

"Well, you might be able to use it in the future. After all, you're in the research society."

"Yeah! I'll do my best!"

I should probably aim to improve the research society. Lynn seems motivated.

"Shin... I forgot to question what you're planning."

"That's because I'm not planning anything strange."

Working on leveling up for everyone's safety doesn't seem strange, right?

We might consider going on a training camp together in the future.

"I'm worried... What are you planning?"

I'm not planning anything strange!

"Good morning! Huh? What's wrong with everyone?"

Alice, who came to the classroom last, looked at everyone in bewilderment.

In the Military Affairs Bureau and the Security Bureau, a large-scale search was conducted to track down Schtrom. The search covered various towns and villages within the kingdom and extended to some extent beyond the country's borders.

Among the search teams, a report was received by Dominic, the head of the Military Affairs Bureau, from those who had secretly conducted the search within the empire.

"Is there movement in the empire?"

The report mentioned that the empire was gathering food from towns and villages within its territory.

"If they are gathering food..."

"There is also information about military movements. This might be... preparing for war?"

Gathering resources rapidly, combined with military activity, seems to indicate preparations for war.

"But... why now? There doesn't seem to be a particularly compelling reason for an invasion, does there?"

"I cannot say. There might be a reason within the empire that presents an opportune moment for invading our kingdom, but that remains unclear."

"It's just one problem after another... Isn't it?"

"Indeed."

With the increase in monsters, Schtrom maintaining his sanity as a demon, and signs of war brewing within the empire, it's a string of issues one after another.

"Perhaps the empire sees the recent turmoil in our kingdom as an opportunity to attack."

"That's unlikely. While it's true that we've had a series of incidents, the kingdom isn't in chaos."

We've been able to respond adequately to each incident. Currently, we're searching for Schtrom's whereabouts, but it's not causing confusion since we're searching for a vanished threat rather than dealing with widespread damage.

However, there's definitely movement within the empire.

Not understanding the reason, but unable to ignore the report, I decided to report to the king.

"What? Is that true?"

"There's no mistake about the empire's movements. While we haven't received a declaration of war, we can't be certain if they are preparing for war..."

"But... considering the report, we should think that way... Dominic!"

"Yes!"

"While searching for Schtrom adds to the burden of dealing with the increased number of monsters, our kingdom must also prepare for war. Proceed with the preparations."

"Understood!"

In this way, the kingdom's army began its preparations for war.

Meanwhile, inside a room in a town within the empire...

"Oh, so the kingdom has also started preparations for war?"

"Yes. The movements of the imperial army are quite blatant, so they noticed right away."

"Hehe, it seems like you did well, Zest. Now, what do you think will happen, Milia?"

"...I cannot say, Schtrom-sama."

Milia and a woman were with Schtrom, whom the kingdom is diligently searching for.

"Everyone, please dance properly, okay? Hahaha!"

Schtrom began to laugh, and Milia watched him intently.

On the other hand, in the imperial capital of the Blusfia Empire, a conversation was taking place among the imperial forces preparing for war.

"Zest, where did you obtain the information about the kingdom you brought?"

"We have collaborators within the kingdom, and they informed us that the capital is currently in chaos due to an increase in monsters. So I investigated..."

"You noticed that the number of monsters in the kingdom is increasing while the number in the empire is decreasing..."

"That's right."

"Hmm, the actual number of monsters has been decreasing, and it seems like the time to take the kingdom has finally come."

"I hope it turns out that way."

"Hmph, there's no need for a commoner like you to say it."

"...You're right."

"Well, rest assured, we will use your information effectively, us noble families of the empire. Consider it an honor."

"...Yes."

As the nobleman left with a smile, a man called Zest simply glared at him.

After school, when the classes had ended, I apologized for not being able to hold the research society yesterday due to the award ceremony and started today's research society.

"By the way, something felt strange this morning. What happened?"

Alice, who wasn't present in the morning, asked.

"Oh, it seems like Shin was up to something suspicious, so I was trying to investigate."

"Suspicious... you say?"

"So I'm not planning anything strange."

"Then what are you planning?"

Everyone's attention was focused on me.

"Well... recently, there have been a series of unusual incidents, right? We've managed to overcome them for now, but we haven't fundamentally resolved the issues. So, there's still a possibility of more trouble happening. I'm just thinking about everyone's level up in the research society to prepare for that."

To avoid any further misunderstandings, I explained what I was currently thinking.

"I see, everyone's level up."

"Yeah, it's not a strange idea, right?"

"True, it's not... but Shin, what do you plan to do for this level up?"

"I thought everyone could learn some basic attack, defense, and healing magic. And also, the defensive magic attachment for those accessories."

For now, I conveyed the rough plan I had in mind.

"I see... Alright, it's true that it's not a strange idea."

"Right?"

After Aug agreed, Lin had a question.

"Wolforde-kun, can you teach us the Gate magic like you did earlier?"

"Lin wants to learn Gate?"

"Yeah, it's an amazing magic. With it, your chances of survival increase significantly, and it makes traveling easier."

"What's Gate?"

Alice hadn't seen it, so I opened a Gate again from one end of the research room to the other.

"Wow, this is incredible! With this, I won't be late!"

No, don't learn it for such impure motives!

"Shin, how about if each of us declares what aspect we want to strengthen, and then you oversee and guide us?"

"Is that the most efficient way?"

So, everyone declared what they wanted to improve.

Lin and Alice chose Gate magic.

Sicily and Thor focused on attack.

Yuri, Maria, and Olivia worked on defense and healing.

Tony, Julius, and Mark opted for physical enhancement.

Tony is still surprising, huh? He might not dislike using his body after all at the Knight Academy.

Aug seems to want to minimize the risks during movement.

Alice's impure motives are obvious!

"Well then, let's level up together so that we can handle any danger on our own!"

"Great!"

To be ready for Schtrom whenever he may come!
