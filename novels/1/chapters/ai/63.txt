A luxurious carriage is advancing on a road connecting the Kingdom of Arlshyde to the Kingdom of Sveed.

There is an impressive escort surrounding the carriage, and among them is an exceptionally luxurious carriage.

It's the carriage of the Crown Prince of Arlshyde, August-von-Arlshyde.

They are in the middle of their journey, accompanied by a large number of escorts, to participate in the tri-country conference between the Kingdom of Arlshyde, the Els Free Trade Union, and the East Holy Nation.

Each country has its representatives attending the conference, with Prince August representing Arlshyde, a diplomat from Els responsible for foreign affairs, and a high-ranking clergyman from East.

The purpose of the tri-country conference is to unite against the threat of demonic entities infiltrating the world, which would pose a global threat.

Additionally, the Ultimate Magicians are emphasizing that they are a group dedicated to saving the world from crises rather than being a military force of Arlshyde.

For this reason, the members of the Ultimate Magicians are also heading to the host country of the tri-country conference, the Kingdom of Sveed.

The presence of multiple carriages is due to this.

Inside one of these carriages...

"Recently, there haven't been any demonic entity attacks, and I've even heard rumors that they've given up attacking because they're afraid of the Ultimate Magicians. Is everything okay?"

"That's why I've been saying that negotiations with other countries are my domain. You don't need to worry."

"But still..."

As it's coming to this, I'm starting to worry that we won't be able to get cooperation from Els and East. If they're so confident, it means we're not needed... or something like that...

Huh! Could it be!?

"Could it be... that they're aiming for the moment of exhaustion after the war?"

"You're overthinking it. Besides, Els is a commercial nation, right? Merchants prioritize trust above all else. It's hard to believe they would take actions that would visibly invite criticism. East is the same. Do you think the religious center of a faith that emphasizes good deeds and leading people to the guidance of the Creator God would take such actions?"

"Maybe you're right."

"Well, at least publicly..."

"...But we don't know what's happening behind the scenes, is that it?"

"It's a reminder that the governance of nations isn't all about ideals."

"...During the negotiations, we need to be cautious."

"Don't worry; the magical device you gave me will protect me. There's nothing to be concerned about."

As he said this, Aug tapped his necklace at his chest.

Even though I don't expect them to launch a direct attack just because the negotiations don't go as planned... I don't know what kind of tricks they might try.

Let's hope that the representatives from Els and East are good people.

Last time, we flew here, so it took only a few hours to reach the Kingdom of Sveed. But this time, it's an official visit, so we're traveling by carriage.

If we use a gate, it would take an instant, but by carriage, it takes two days to reach the border and another two days to reach the capital of the Kingdom of Sveed.

It's quite far... I wonder if we should seriously consider alternative means of long-distance travel.

If we arrange things in various places, engage in negotiations, and get involved in business, it might not have much of a societal impact...

"Hey, Shin. Are you planning something?"

"Did I have a sly grin?"

"Yes..."

"I did, didn't I?"

"You really... when will you learn to restrain yourself?"

"You're being rude. I do restrain myself, so I don't take immediate action."

I got scolded the other day, but I think it's a good thing to make life easier...

As we discussed this, we could see the walls of the capital of the Kingdom of Sveed in the distance.

"Wow! It's been a while! It looks like it's been considerably restored!"

"Indeed. As a rallying point for the battle against demonic entities, there's no better country."

Looking at the city walls still in the distance, everyone stuck their heads out of their carriages.

I came here just the other day for a communication device test.

"Welcome, everyone from the Kingdom of Arlshyde! It's been a while!"

"Lord August!"

"Great Demon King!"

"Sicily!"

"Holy Maiden! Heal me!"

The enthusiastic cheers from the people, grateful for the recent demonic entity subjugation, were impressive.

But more importantly, has the title of Great Demon King already reached here?

"Hmm, it seems we're being welcomed."

"Of course. It was just the other day that we were attacked by demonic entities. After they were defeated, many of our citizens regretted not being able to express their gratitude since you left without being recognized. That's why so many have gathered this time."

Aug made announcements in the capital both at the start and end of the battle, and Sicily has been in direct contact with the citizens for healing purposes. It's only natural that they are popular.

"This time, we have prepared a guesthouse for you. Please use it to gather your strength before the conference."

"No need to trouble yourselves."

"No, please accept it as a token of our gratitude."

With that, we were welcomed to the Kingdom of Sveed.

The representatives from the other two countries are expected to arrive in the afternoon today.

The conference begins tomorrow.

If this goes well, we can finally launch our offensive against the former imperial territory.

Let's hope it all comes together.

A famous restaurant in the Kingdom of Sveed. There is a room on the second floor where meetings can be held while having a meal.

This time, the meeting venue provided by the Kingdom of Sveed is that room.

It's their consideration to ensure that the negotiations proceed in a friendly manner, with occasional breaks for meals.

August arrived ahead of the representatives from the other two countries in a private room near the venue.

Accompanying him are his guards, Thor and Julius.

While the two guards seem somewhat nervous, August is remarkably relaxed.

Noticing this, Thor asked August, "Your Highness, you seem very calm, but... are you not concerned about the issues Shin mentioned?"

"Of course, I understand the concerns Shin has."

"Then why?"

To that, August smiled and replied, "I've had the initiative from the beginning. That's all."

Considering that "Your Highness must have a plan," Thor decided not to inquire further.

"Your Highness August, the representatives from Els and East have assembled."

A report came in from one of the guards outside the room, stating that the representatives from both countries had gathered.

"Well, let's go, then."

With a casual demeanor, August headed to the venue for the tri-country conference.

Upon entering the meeting room, the representatives from Els and East were waiting, not yet seated.

"Nice to meet you, Your Highness August. I'm Usama Nabar, responsible for diplomacy in the Els Free Trade Union. Please, feel welcome."

The Els representative, speaking with a distinct Els accent, had a sly grin on his face, and it was clear that he had a hidden agenda to negotiate terms favorable to his country.

(He could at least hide his intentions a little better.)

"I am August-von-Arlshyde. The pleasure is mine."

Internally, August couldn't help but feel disappointed that Els had chosen a man who couldn't conceal his desires to represent them in this historically significant conference. Still, as a true royal, he maintained his composure without displaying any such attitude.

"Nice to meet you, Your Highness August. I am Amen-Fleur. I hold the position of Archbishop at the Grand Cathedral of the Creation God."

To this man, who was an Archbishop of the Creation God, August let out a sigh internally.

This was because the clergy of the Creation God were known for embracing poverty as a virtue and strict self-discipline, yet the person before him was a plump, middle-aged man with a greasy appearance.

(Using the position of Archbishop to fatten one's own pockets... and furthermore...)

"I am August-von-Arlshyde. The pleasure is mine."

"Um, likewise."

It seemed that both representatives were trying to assert themselves and act in an arrogant manner to compete with August, who was of royal lineage.

Both representatives appeared to be trying to utilize this conference for their own career advancement.

It could be inferred that they had used all means at their disposal to secure their current positions.

This was supposed to be a conference to address the world's crisis, but August couldn't help but inwardly lament the lack of a sense of urgency from the two countries that weren't directly exposed to the threat of demonic entities due to their location far from the former empire.

"I'd like to get into the negotiations right away, but how about we have a meal and discuss matters first?"

"Eh? Yes, that sounds fine."

"Indeed, it's a meeting that started early in the morning. I've only had a simple breakfast."

"In that case, I apologize, but could you bring us some breakfast?"

The Els representative, Nabar, who was eager to jump into the negotiations and present his case, seemed somewhat disappointed, and in response, Fleur exhibited a composed demeanor.

However, it might be that they were simply interested in the meal.

As breakfast was brought to the table, August initiated the conversation.

"Since the appearance of demonic entities, we've seen an increase in monsters on various highways. It must be quite a challenge for Els. It's likely affecting trade," August remarked.

"That's right. No matter what, we need to increase the number of guards, and the costs have been quite painful," Nabar responded.

"And how is it in East? Are the believers getting anxious, seeking salvation at the church?" August inquired.

"Hmm, it's true the believers are quite anxious," Fleur added.

While Nabar responded normally, Fleur, for some reason, smiled as he answered, causing August to have a certain conviction.

As they continued discussing such trivial matters over breakfast, they finally began the conference.

"Now, I reached out to Els Free Trade Union and the Holy Kingdom of East on behalf of Arlshyde, and I'll get straight to the point," August began, prompting both representatives to be on guard.

"We want to form an alliance for the defense of each nation against the demonic entities that have taken control of the former imperial territory and expanded into neighboring countries, as well as for an invasion of the former imperial territory."

Upon hearing this, the two representatives showed signs of contemplation, and Nabar had a sly expression as he responded, "Well, it's not going to be that simple."

"What do you mean?" August asked, noticing Nabar's grin.

"Isn't Els a commercial nation? It doesn't make sense for us to participate in something that only incurs losses and offers no benefits."

"No benefits, you say..."

"Exactly. Even if we were to defeat the demonic entities, who will cover the military expenses incurred? Are you suggesting we demand compensation from the demonic entities?"

"True, there's no one to demand compensation from."

"Or is the Kingdom of Arlshyde going to cover it all?"

"Cover the entire military expenses of a nation? That's impossible."

"Is that so? But after all, this proposal came from Arlshyde, didn't it? And have you heard the rumors? Supposedly, Arlshyde alone can handle the situation."

Nabar brought up the rumors circulating in the city, causing August's expression to distort slightly. Observing this, Nabar grinned even more.

"The burden is too great for Arlshyde alone, which is why you reached out to us and East, right? Then, you better come up with a proposal that won't make Els suffer... otherwise, this discussion won't go anywhere."

"Hmm... What does Els desire?" August asked, sensing that he had Nabar right where he wanted him.

"I believe... there's a magical device in Arlshyde and its neighboring countries that allows long-distance communication, right? How about providing that for free? Of course, we'll get the quantity we desire," Nabar suggested.

For a commercial nation, a communication device that facilitates the swift exchange of information is likely a highly coveted commodity.

Nabar's unabashed request left August sighing inwardly.

"What about East? Do you also have some demands related to the world's crisis?" August asked, subtly criticizing Els for making self-serving requests.

Nabar's expression twisted in response to August's criticism, and he replied, "Hahaha, we are the clergy of the Church of the Creator. We have no such greedy demands as Els."

"What did you say!?"

"It's unthinkable to prioritize our own interests in the face of a global crisis."

Nabar glared at Fleur as if he were a personal enemy, but Fleur remained unruffled, ignoring the animosity.

"So, does that mean East will join this alliance?" August inquired.

"Yes... we are not stingy in participating," Nabar conceded.

Despite criticizing Els, it seemed that East also had some requests.

"What do you desire?" August asked.

"Well, as I mentioned earlier, believers are becoming anxious in your country. We would like to address this situation."

"...Specifically?"

In response, Fleur made a request.

"Saint."

"What?"

"Rumors have it that there's a girl in your country revered as a saint. It's said she's a beautiful young lady with exceptional healing magic. We'd like you to hand over this saint to us. We want her to become a symbol in the Holy Kingdom of East, alleviating the people's anxiety."

August couldn't believe his ears as Fleur proposed that they hand over Sicily, who was gaining fame as a saint.

Internally, August thought, "I knew something like this would come up when they mentioned the people's anxiety. I didn't expect them to ask for Sicily to be handed over, though."

In Fleur's request, a clear desire was apparent. He wanted the renowned young beauty celebrated as a saint to be in his possession.

If it came to pass, August couldn't help but shiver at the thought of Shin's reaction.

Els and East. Both countries' requests were inadvertently tied to Shin, and especially East's demand was far from acceptable.

Nabar and Fleur were now looking at August with hopeful eyes.

(In international negotiations, it's surprising how unabashed they are about their desires.)

Nabar is overtly displaying his desire, while Fleur, though trying to conceal it, can't hide the greed in his eyes.

"These are the requests from both Els and East..."

Nabar and Fleur lean forward.

Then, August's words...

"I can't agree to both of your requests."

At these words, both of them momentarily open their mouths in shock and then display their disappointment.

"What are you saying? Are you telling us to participate in the war for free?"

"We presented a proposal to alleviate the people's anxiety, and to be honest, I'm disappointed."

"It seems that Your Highness, as young as you are, is not capable of such high-level negotiations."

Complaints and mockery are directed at August.

August, who received these taunting words, responds with a hint of anger.

"Who really doesn't understand the situation here is all of you."

"Nothing in it for Els? Is that the extent of your understanding to represent your country in this complex negotiation?"

"What did you say!?"

"And, Archbishop Fleur, why must you hand over the saint?"

"I just mentioned it. To alleviate the people's anxiety..."

"Are you suggesting that someone who hasn't undergone the training to become a priest is to be handed over? Moreover, when we speak of the Ultimate Magicians' saint, she is known for having the power to go to the battlefield and defeat demons, as well as for healing injured people free of charge. That's why she is popular among the people and serves as their hope. Why would handing her over to East be the only way to alleviate the people's anxiety?"

"Well, that is..."

"Wouldn't removing the saint from the front lines actually increase the people's anxiety?"

August's probing questions leave Fleur speechless.

"Or... is there some other motive behind this?"

"No! There isn't!"

"Oh? Even someone like a high bishop... could your request be for your own desires?"

"Silence! You miser!"

"What did you say!? You foul priest!"

"What did you say!?"

"Enough!"

August intervenes and stops the argument between the two.

Why did Nabar, who should be representing Els, provoke Fleur, a representative from another country?

This stems from the fact that Els and East had a strained relationship with no particularly positive feelings to begin with. Els finds East's constant criticism of capitalism annoying, and East sees Els as a group of misers.

This tension was evident in the meeting.

However, despite their differences, they are both commercial and religious nations. They don't have any intention of going to war, considering the costs of war and the impression it would give to the world when a religious nation engages in warfare.

"Els and East, what are you both thinking? This meeting is about overcoming a global crisis."

"Well, you say that, but if I understand correctly, wouldn't Aarlsheid be able to handle it alone? Why involve us?"

"That's absolutely right."

"Do you not even understand that?"

"What are you talking about?"

"Are you mocking us?"

Even after all this, they still didn't grasp the true purpose of the meeting. August sighed and decided to enlighten them.

"Indeed, Aarlsheid could handle it alone. But if we resolve the situation with our country alone, how do you think you will feel?"

"Well... I suppose we would be quite impressed..."

"And what about the neighboring countries?"

"They would certainly be grateful to Aarlsheid..."

It finally dawned on them. If Aarlsheid single-handedly resolved the situation, the significance of Aarlsheid's achievement would be enormous. Considering the positions of Aarlsheid, the savior of the world, and the non-participating superpowers...

"Neighboring countries would show great gratitude to Aarlsheid. And how do you think the two great nations that did nothing during this world crisis would be evaluated?"

This wasn't a guaranteed outcome, but it was spoken with an air of inevitability. The expressions on Nabar's and Fleur's faces changed.

While different in nature, both commerce and religion are heavily influenced by the public's reputation. As it stands, if Aarlsheid were to achieve glory, they would become a world leader with significant influence, while the two great nations that did nothing would lose their credibility, according to the two of them.

"The purpose of this meeting isn't to 'ask' Els and East for anything. It's a proposal for 'mutual benefit sharing,' so that both countries can share the achievements that Aarlsheid could monopolize alone. But to think you'd come here with such greedy intentions."

The purpose of this meeting was not just to counter the threat of the demons but also to adjust the world's power balance. Unable to understand this, the two representatives who voiced their demands hung their heads.

One felt embarrassed for failing to realize this, while the other felt angry for being humiliated.

"As for the communication devices, they were invented by individuals, and each country has purchased them and pays monthly communication fees. So, you're asking Els to provide them for free and in large quantities. What would happen?"

As if to add insult to injury, August asked what would happen if communication devices were provided for free.

"That... it would arouse resentment."

"That's the primary reason why your demands are unacceptable."

Nabar, who couldn't even think about the consequences of his own demands, became even more crestfallen.

"And as for the Holy Maiden... do you know she has a fiancé?"

"That... yes."

Fleur, of course, knew. He knew that being in a position as a high bishop within the Creation God Faith organization would usually make most things permissible.

Because of that, he assumed that his demands would be accepted regardless of the fact that the Holy Maiden had a fiancé.

"You seem to know about it. So, who is her fiancé?"

"...The 'Demon King' Shin Wolford, isn't it?"

"Exactly, you're well-informed. It's famous that the Demon King of the Ultimate Magicians and the Holy Maiden are engaged and are known to be very close."

"You didn't know even that?!" Nabar said, looking at Fleur with an incredulous expression.

Being stared at by Nabar in such a way, Fleur's anger began to take over.

Fleur, of course, knew. However, as a high bishop in the world's largest religious organization, he didn't think anyone would dare oppose him.

"So, you're making these demands despite knowing that... honestly, I'm impressed by your courage, High Bishop Fleur."

"What are you saying?"

"To make such demands when her fiancé is known as the 'Magic King' and can effortlessly defeat demons even if they attack in groups... you certainly have quite the audacity."

"He's just her fiancé, and despite being known to get along very well, would you be able to make such demands without enraging the Demon King?"

"...Let's see what happens if you do that... the world will truly come to an end..."

"Don't be so dramatic..."

Fleur couldn't believe it, but August understood Shin's unconventional nature well, so he could easily picture that scene.

"Anyway, you should refrain from interfering with the Holy Maiden. No matter what happens."

Fleur was now too furious to think straight. His face turned bright red, and he alternated between glaring at August and Nabarl, who was mocking him.

"In this state, it's impossible to continue this meeting any further. Let's adjourn and meet again tomorrow. Diplomat Nabarl, Archbishop Fleur, I haven't asked for your cooperation for free. Consider what benefits you can get after this crisis has subsided."

With those words, August left the room. Nabarl followed him afterward, leaving only Archbishop Fleur in the room.

"Oh, welcome back, Oug."

"Yeah, today's meeting is over."

"So, does that mean there will be another one tomorrow?"

"Unfortunately, both Els and East tried to get their demands met. We decided to take a break and meet again tomorrow."

"Is it because of those rumors...?"

"That doesn't matter too much. You don't need to worry about it."

"I see..."

I thought the negotiations had become difficult due to those rumors. But it seems like they had some influence, but it wasn't that big of a deal. I felt relieved by that. However, I was then approached by Oug.

"Shin, Claude, can I talk to you for a moment?"

"Huh? What is it?"

"What's wrong, Your Highness?"

He called me and Sicily away from the group.

"Listen, Shin... I need you to stay calm when you hear this."

"What's going on?"

"The representative of East... they made a request as a condition to join the alliance."

"Huh? What are you talking about!?"

"I told you not to get mad. Don't worry, we refused that request."

"Of course!"

To exchange Sicily for their alliance participation? What's that? Are the Creation God Faith people really like that?

"Just to be clear, the priests of the Creation God Faith are known for valuing poverty and strict self-discipline against desires. It was incredibly ironic to see someone that fat as a priest. They must be very skillful at handling situations."

"Despicable people..."

People like that exist in every world.

"It seems Els' representative somewhat agreed to the terms, but East's representative was furious when their demands were rejected. Furthermore, Els' representative taunted them."

"Els' representative?"

What's going on?

"Els and East don't get along..."

"Money and austerity..."

That's the situation. Especially East's representative holds a significant position within the Creation God Faith. They can't stand it when things don't go their way. They had a bright red face with anger.

"So, does that mean..."

"There's a possibility they might resort to drastic measures."

"Are you serious?"

Who is that person? They're definitely not a priest.

"So, Shin, don't take your eyes off them."

"Alright, I got it."

That's ridiculous! I won't let anyone lay a hand on Sicily!

"Shin-kun?"

"Huh? Oh, sorry."

Before I knew it, I had pulled Sicily closer by her shoulders. I noticed it but didn't feel like letting her go.

Absolutely, absolutely...

"Absolutely, I'll protect you."

"Shin-kun..."

I'll protect this girl...

"Hey, cut it out! Can't you do that in your room!?"

Maria interjected as usual.

"Um, Shin-kun?"

"Hm? Oh, sorry."

I realized that I was pulling Sicily even closer. I noticed it but didn't feel like letting her go.

I'll definitely protect Sicily. Bring it on from anywhere!

"I see that your lovey-dovey sessions have leveled up."

"Well, cut us some slack this time."

"What do you mean?"

With everyone's eyes on us, we made our declaration of determination. That's the spirit! We're ready for anything!

"He really came..."

I had expected a nighttime attack, and we had informed everyone of the situation and had them act as if nothing were happening. So we appeared defenseless.

As expected, a nighttime attack happened. Several magical reactions showed up on the search magic.

They checked each window one by one until they stopped at Sicily's window.

Peeping, huh?

It's already getting on my nerves.

By the way, we had instructed everyone to go to bed and pretend to sleep.

And then, the magical presence that had been motionless in front of the window for a while started to move.

What did they do?

And they opened the window and entered...

I clenched my anger and waited for multiple magical presences to enter the room.

And when they all entered...

"Who dares to break into a girl's room at this time of night? What kind of ruffians are you?"

I used a gate to reach Sicily's room and addressed the intruders.

"Ngh..."

The intruders were masked men.

Just the fact that a group of men had barged into Sicily's room made my anger boil over.

"Sicily, it's alright."

I spoke to Sicily like that.

"You idiots, I've been sleeping soundly thanks to this sleep-inducing fragrance!"

"Shin-kun!"

"What? Are you kidding me!?"

These guys... sleep-inducing drugs... or is it sleep gas? They went so far as to use that!

The magical presence that hadn't moved in front of the window for a while must have been sending sleep gas into the room through the gap in the window!

I'm really glad I created that magical item. And I'm glad I labeled it as an "foreign object" instead of "poison." If it were sleep gas, it might not be classified as poison.

If that were the case, we might have been put to sleep, and they could have taken us while we were sleeping!

That thought filled me with even more anger.

I jumped out of bed and held Sicily, who had jumped at me. I was thinking about what to do with these guys.

"Capture the intruders!"

At Og's command, the guards came rushing in through the window and the door.

The men tried to escape through the window, but there were already guards waiting outside, and all of them were captured and tied up.

"Now, what should we do with these guys?"

"Wait, Shin. If we make these guys talk, it will be advantageous for our negotiations. We should start with interrogation."

After tying up the intruders and removing the sleep gas that had filled the room through the window, I was thinking about what to do with them when Og suggested starting with interrogation.

Indeed, if these guys were really from the Holy Kingdom of East, it would become an international issue, and we could have the upper hand in negotiations.

My anger had clouded my judgment.

"Now, why did you target Claude?"

"...”

"Who are you people?"

"..."

"Did you do this of your own accord, or were you hired for this?"

"..."

Silence, huh?

These guys are stubbornly staying silent.

Is it this guy's turn?

"Og."

"What? Necklace again?"

"It's not as fancy as that. This one has the 'Confession' enchantment on it."

"I see, with this..."

"Hey, stop it! Cut it out, you!"

"They can't lie or stay silent, it seems."

By the way, since it's powered by a magic stone, it's always active.

"Now, I'll ask again. Who are you people?"

"We... We are..."

"Hey, stop it! Don't talk!"

"We are... from the Holy Kingdom of East..."

"Exactly as I suspected. So, did you come here of your own free will, or were you ordered to come?"

"...W-We were ordered to... come."

"Who gave you the order?"

"Hey, stop it!"

"Someone, gag these guys."

"Sir!"

Gags were placed on the men who had been shouting until now.

Finally, some peace and quiet.

"So? Who gave you the order?"

"...It was... B-Bishop Fuller."

"Bishop Fuller?"

"He's the current representative of the Holy Kingdom of East."

"Seriously... What were you thinking?"

Now it's an international matter.

They've caused a problem significant enough that they won't be able to resist any demands we make.

"Why did you do something like this? You must have known it would become an international issue, right?"

Of course, they did. Why did they execute such an order, which was clearly going to cause an international issue?

And can't the perpetrators resist such an order?

"T-The... Holy Maiden was... captured by the... evil Demon Lord... and... defiled... We were told... it's our mission to... rescue her..."

Snap... something snapped inside my head.

Unprecedented anger swirled around me.

These guys... what should I do with them...

As I was thinking that...

Pam! Sicily slapped one of the intruders hard across the face.

"What audacious nonsense are you saying!? You're calling Shin a villain!? Don't be ridiculous! Shin, more than anyone else, wishes for the happiness, safety, and peace of this world! You people who label Shin as evil and try to distance me from him, you are the real villains in my eyes!"

With a huff and tears streaming down her face, Sicily shouted.

Seeing Sicily like this, my anger subsided, and I was overwhelmed with gratitude and affection for her.

"Sicily..."

"Huff! Huff... Ugh!"

I embraced Sicily from behind as she took deep breaths.

"Thank you, Sicily. Your words... make me happy."

"Because Shin is... Shin!"

Sicily turned around and sobbed into my chest.

Was she upset because I was referred to as the evil Demon Lord?

I rubbed Sicily's back as she continued to sob and watched the situation unfold.

"Did you guys still think Claude had captured Shin even after witnessing this scene? Even after seeing Shin's anger and tears for his sake?"

"...We don't think that anymore. Were we deceived?"

"That's right. It was Bishop Fuller's doing."

The intruders looked visibly indignant.

That's to be expected. They were deceived into targeting someone who is generally regarded as a Holy Maiden. Even though they were deceived, they're still caught in the act of illegal entry and attempted kidnapping. We can't just release them. That's why we'll need to meet with the East delegation tomorrow before the negotiations.

As for Sicily...

"Sob... Hic... Ugh..."

She was still crying.

"Sicily, it's okay now, really."

"Ugh... Shin-kun..."

After her outburst and intense crying, she's regressed a bit into behaving like a child. It's a different kind of dependency from before.

"Look, it's time for bed. Okay?"

"Ugh... I don't wanna..."

"Come on, you need to sleep, right?"

"Ugh... Stay with me..."

With her swollen eyes, when she says something like that, I can't refuse, can I?

"Okay, I understand. Come on, let's go to sleep."

I said that and guided Sicily to the bed, helping her get settled.

"No, Shin-kun..."

I gently stroked her head, and eventually, Sicily, worn out from crying, fell asleep.

I was relieved and about to leave the room when I noticed that Sicily was clutching the hem of my clothes.

What should I do? She's holding on tightly, and it doesn't seem like she's going to let go easily.

As I pondered what to do, Sicily mumbled something in her sleep.

"Shin-kun... I love you..."

Upon hearing Sicily's sleep-talk, I decided not to release her grasp. Today, Sicily got angry and cried for my sake.

Feeling grateful and filled with affection once again, I said, "Thank you for today. I love you, Sicily," and kissed her forehead.

With a contented smile on her face, Sicily, still clutching my clothes, drifted into a peaceful sleep by my side.

Tomorrow... it will be quite a commotion from the morning onwards. fun activities
