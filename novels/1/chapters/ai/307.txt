"Earlsheid Elementary School, fourth-grade classroom.

The previous class had ended, and there were two different reactions within the classroom.

Restless and impatient individuals.

And those who looked at them with envy.

The restless ones were students with magical aptitude who couldn't wait for their next magical practice class.

The envious ones were students without magical aptitude.

"Hey Silver, let's go to the practice building."

"Yeah."

Among them, Allen called out to Sylvester to go to magical practice.

Sylvester, feeling the envious glances around him, went to the magical practice building with Allen and Cresta.

"Well, I understand the envy, but there's nothing we can do about it."

"That's right. Having magical aptitude is something you're born with."

The jealousy and envy within the classroom seemed bothersome to Allen, and he sighed.

Cresta also had an expression that said it was futile to envy whether you could use magic or not, as it was something determined by one's inherent nature.

However, Sylvester had a different opinion.

"Well, there are plenty of remarkable people who aren't wizards, so there's no need to be envious."

"For example?"

"Like Ms. Miranda."

"Comparing to someone who's an idol in the Knights, your surroundings are really something..."

"Ms. Miranda casually has tea in our living room..."

Allen and Cresta, thinking about the usual atmosphere in the Walford household, felt the peculiarity of the Walford family once again.

"They're all friends of your parents, so even if they're considered amazing..."

"Do you realize?"

"What?"

"What you're saying is exactly the same as Lord Shin, you know?"

Sylvester, upon hearing that, had an utterly surprised expression.

"Huh!? Really!? I'm with my dad!?"

"Is that what you find so touching!?"

"Hahaha, Silver, you might become like Lord Shin in the future."

"Really? Do you really think so?"

"Yes."

"I see, being with my dad."

Sylvester, told that he might become like his beloved father, was happier than he had ever been before."

Naturally, everyone had a supervisor's license... or rather, without even taking the required exam, the Walford family suddenly received licenses for everyone who could use magic. This meant that anyone could learn magic from them.

Upon seeing Sylvester, who rarely displayed such a side, Allen and Cresta exchanged wry smiles.

"But becoming like Lord Shin would be tough, don't you think?"

"Hehe, our goal is quite distant."

"Someday, I'll catch up!"

Sylvester, who was usually calm and rarely showed strong emotions, was now excited.

To him, his father was a significant presence.

"So, we should do our best in today's magical practice!"

"Yeah, you're right."

"Yes, let's do our best."

The three of them enthusiastically committed to giving their best in the upcoming magical practice.

As they walked and chatted about the magical practice scheduled for the day, Allen suddenly remembered something and asked Sylvester.

"By the way, did you finish Lord Shin's assignment?"

"Yeah, I finished it."

"Well, Sylvester, you're fortunate. Even without Lord Shin, we have several great magic instructors in our house."

"We can't practice once we go back home."

Elementary school students were not allowed to practice magic without a qualified supervisor present. This rule was established to prevent accidents caused by children learning magic on their own and using it recklessly, considering the incident when Merlin had left Shin unattended and he had created magic on his own, leading to a situation that was difficult to control. August had established this rule through law, keeping in mind the necessity of preventing accidents.

There were concerns voiced about it infringing on children's free will, but the fundamental premise was different for Shin and the current generation of children. Shin had retained the memories of his previous life from a very young age, which made him mentally equivalent to an adult. Such incidents were genuinely rare, and considering the risk, the necessity for supervisors during magical practice for elementary school students was established.

Supervisors were required to hold a supervisor license issued by the Mage Association, so only those with the license could serve as supervisors. Therefore, if there was no such person in the family or if they couldn't afford to hire a magical private tutor, practicing magic at home was prohibited.

In this regard, the Walford family had multiple individuals who were skilled in magic, apart from Shin.

Naturally, everyone in the family had supervisor licenses. Well, not everyone needed to take the exam because, according to Shin and the others, such a thing was unnecessary. One day, supervisor licenses for everyone in the Walford family who could use magic were sent to them, allowing anyone to be taught magic by them.

Sylvester, who had received envious looks not only from students without magical aptitude but also from Allen and Cresta, laughed it off, saying, "Ah, hahaha."

"Well, not only at the academy, but we are fortunate that we can practice magic while staying at Silver's house for a limited time."

"It's truly a luxurious situation. Not only our parents, but even our grandparents envy it."

"The Saintess, the Sage, and the Priest, right?"

"It's unbelievably lucky. Sometimes I worry that I've used up a lifetime's worth of luck."

"Me too."

"Is that so?"

Sylvester knew that his family was highly respected in society. However, no matter how much others said that, for Sylvester, they were just the family he had been with since he was born.

A kind and funny father, a loving mother who could be scary when she got angry, an incredibly gentle grandfather, and possibly the scariest grandmother in the world. They didn't bring their external status into the house, so when they were at home, they were just an ordinary family. As a result, no matter what others said, it didn't match Sylvester's usual image of his family.

"Anyway, Silver, just stay as you are."

"Yes."

"What's that supposed to mean?"

Sylvester tilted his head, not understanding the feelings of Allen and Cresta.

"Haha! Well, don't worry about it. More importantly, if we advance further in magical techniques than others, we might face unnecessary jealousy again."

"That's true. It's not just the students without magical aptitude, but even those who are learning the same magic might be envious."

"Such is the fate of those who possess talent..."

Allen, who said something in a somewhat self-important manner, made Sylvester burst into laughter.

"Hahaha! Oh, right, speaking of which..."

"Hmm? What is it?"

"The other day, my dad and Uncle Aug were talking about something."

"Oh, I see."

With the topic being the Ultimate Magicians' representative and His Royal Highness the Crown Prince, Allen and Cresta's expressions suddenly turned serious, moving away from the playful demeanor they had moments ago.

For Allen and Cresta, discussions involving Shin and August were not to be taken lightly.

"What... what's going on?"

"Nothing. So?"

"Apparently, they're planning to retest magical aptitude next year."

When Allen and Cresta heard Sylvester's words, they briefly widened their eyes but then shook their heads.

"Huh? Why?"

"I don't know. He didn't go into that much detail."

"Well, why would they do that?"

"Well, we'll never understand the thoughts of Lord Shin and the Crown Prince as kids ourselves."

While Allen was curious and wanted to know the reason, Cresta had already given up trying to understand Shin's way of thinking, especially when it came to Cloud's thoughts.

"Well, that's true, but regardless of the reason, is it confirmed that they will retest?"

"Yeah. They're going to do it along with the new fourth-year students' examination next year."

"What could it be, really?"

"Maybe they think that if they retest, some people might suddenly show magical aptitude."

Retesting would imply that it targeted individuals who were previously judged to lack magical aptitude. The reason for retesting might be the belief that these individuals could potentially show magical aptitude upon reexamination.

"That's unlikely."

"Yeah, if you can't use magic, you won't ever be able to. That's common knowledge."

"Hmm, I see."

Sylvester's hunch was actually correct, but the three of them, unaware of such matters, shifted their thoughts to their magical practice for the day.

While everyone else struggled with mana control, Sylvester and his friends were already capable of converting mana into magic, as expected, earning them more jealous looks. course overview
