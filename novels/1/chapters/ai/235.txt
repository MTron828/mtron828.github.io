"Wasn't it your father who actually signed the report? You're not implying that he didn't read the agreement document, are you?"

"Of course, I thoroughly read it. A king of a nation wouldn't do something so casual."

"So, what report were you actually waiting for?"

"Well, besides that agreement document, there are various other reports."

In other words, they must be asking for an explanation of what we've been doing in Quanrong.

Well, there are indeed other reports that should be conveyed besides my past life.

Being here implies that various adjustments have been made, so it's just right.

"What about Grandpa and Grandma?"

"Ho ho. I've always intended that."

"Or rather, you'll explain what kind of commotion you've caused this time."

Why is Grandma assuming I'll cause trouble? I don't plan on causing any unnecessary commotion in another country! Commotions just happen on their own!

Suppressing that feeling, I began to recount the events in Quanrong. From the commotion involving the Min family to the massive emergence of dragons and their subjugation.

Among them, what's particularly important is the story told in Quanrong and Hao's fate.

"What did you say!? Ingesting magic stones allows non-magic users to use magic!?"

That story was clearly shocking, as Grandma raised her voice.

"Is that really true?"

"I can hardly believe it myself..."

Uncle Dis and Grandpa both had expressions of disbelief.

"There is no mistake. Hao couldn't use magic. It's reported that he used magic without a doubt when he escaped from the confinement facility, and powdered magic stones were found in the mansion."

As Org explained, Grandma and the others finally seemed to believe.

"However, what's truly important starts from here."

Org continued and revealed that those who ingest magic stones will almost certainly become magical beings.

"To hide this fact, people in Quanrong are taught that magic stones are poisonous. This will be a separate deal with the Min family, but magic stones will start flowing into Arlsheid from now on. Should we consider similar measures in Arlsheid?"

When Org made this suggestion, Uncle Dis crossed his arms and grumbled.

Certainly, it might be better to say it's poison rather than to spread the information that magic stones turn you into a magical being.

"Do it that way. Otherwise, there might be people willing to become magical beings, even at the risk of transformation."

"It seems the upper echelons of the Quanrong from the past thought the same way. So, even now, only a very few of the upper echelons know about this fact."

Org said this and looked at Shaolin, who had come along.

"Yes. Until this incident, I was taught that magic stones were deadly poison and should never be ingested."

"They've been teaching it that way for decades, and no magical transformations have occurred due to magic stone ingestion."

With the additional information from Shaolin and Org, Uncle Dis seemed to have made up his mind.

"Understood. Let's inform only a select few about this. Is it enough to inform the military's top brass?"

"That should suffice."

"Very well."

For now, they decided to leave this matter to Uncle Dis.

Next, they talked about the ruins of the ancient civilization.

"What? The ancient civilization?"

Uncle Dis reacted with a dismissive attitude.

Well, that's the kind of reaction you'd expect from someone in Arlsheid.

"It's not a wild story or an urban legend. There are actual ruins. We've confirmed it."

The first to react to Org's words was Grandma.

"Is it really true!? Not a mistake or anything!?"

"Yes. We've actually seen the layout of the ruins. I've never seen a city like that before. It's undoubtedly the mythical ancient civilization."

As soon as she heard that, Grandma's demeanor changed.

"Could it really be? The ruins of the ancient civilization that we couldn't find any clues about no matter how much we investigated, in a place like that... right away... but for Shin's sake..."

Well, Grandma apparently went as far as traveling to a war-torn country in search of Masita's magical tool.

Honestly, she probably wants to go see the ruins right away. But after repeatedly telling me to exercise self-control, it seems she can't just say she wants to go right away.

That's when a lifeline was extended.

"You don't need to rush so much. In Quanrong, the ruins of the ancient civilization have become a tourist attraction. If you have the time, you can visit anytime. Lord Shin has a gate, after all."

"Really!? Then maybe I'll have them take me later!"

Huh? Later?

Does that mean right after this?

Even though she's already a grandma, why is she so active?

"Is there really no blood relation? Shin, you look so much alike."

Watching Grandma, who was unusually excited, Cecily whispered to me.

I agree, I also think so.

"Is the conversation over now!? Then let's get started..."

"I'm sorry, Lord Merida, the conversation will continue for a bit longer."

And Org began to talk about the circumstances of the collapse of the ancient civilization.

The creation of weapons capable of destroying nations, and the actual use of these weapons. The possibility of creating such weapons in the future as magical tools are developed. The need for nations to cooperate and refrain from creating such weapons, even as a deterrent, before it becomes a reality.

Uncle Dis, upon receiving this explanation, once again had a difficult expression, while Grandma seemed to have come to some understanding.

"I see. No wonder we couldn't find any traces of the ancient civilization no matter where we looked. Can't believe it was completely obliterated..."

"That's a horrifying story."

Grandma appeared ready to go investigate various things at any moment, while Grandpa wore a serious expression.

It's understandable, considering that humans caused a disaster worse than the one caused by the previous Strom. Having experienced the consequences of the magical beings' havoc, he probably understood the gravity of the situation.

"But still, is Quanrong really researching the matter to that extent?"

Perhaps because Org explained the circumstances of the ancient civilization's collapse in such detail, Grandma wondered if Quanrong was conducting extensive research on the ancient civilization.

She asked Shaolin about it.

However, Shaolin, when asked, appeared troubled.

"No, even in Quanrong, we haven't unraveled it to that extent."

Grandma wore a puzzled expression at Shaolin's response.

"What do you mean? Are you saying that everything you've told us so far was just your imagination?"

"It was quite specific for that, though..."

Uncle Dis also appeared puzzled.

Org and I exchanged glances and I took over the conversation from there.

"I made an educated guess based on the condition of the ruins. I think it's almost certainly accurate."

"Shin did?"

"What do you mean?"

Both Grandma and Grandpa, as well as Uncle Dis, looked at me.

Taking a deep breath and composing myself, I confided in the three of them.

"I, you see, have memories from a past life when I lived in another world."

When I said that, the three of them briefly widened their eyes, but they didn't react with further astonishment.

"Huh?"

Wait, I just shared something quite significant, you know? Why are you reacting so mildly?

"And? How does the fact that you have memories from a past life relate to explaining the circumstances of the ancient civilization's collapse?"

"Huh? Um..."

In turn, I explained the reason for my guess about the circumstances of the ancient civilization's collapse while I was confused.

The city layout of the ancient civilization was remarkably similar to a city in my past life memories. From this, it is assumed that there were individuals in the ancient civilization era who remembered their past lives, much like me. Likely, the person with memories of their past life created a weapon causing significant damage for deterrence. In the otherworld with past life memories, even if such a weapon was created, it was probably never used, as it wasn't expected to be. However, a ruler unaware of its power ended up using it. Consequently, the ancient civilization collapsed.

After explaining up to that point, all three of them heaved deep sighs.

"I see. If that's the case, it seems that Shin's speculations are accurate."

"Or rather, isn't it almost certain? Deseum, hearing this story here and now is crucial. We must take strict measures to ensure that such weapons are never created in the future."

"I understand. Once I return to the palace, I will contact the kings of various countries."

"W-wait a minute!"

The way the three of them were talking so casually made me blurt out a "wait."

"What is it? We're in the middle of an important discussion."

"I know, but! I just confessed something quite significant, right? Why are you brushing it aside?"

"Why? Do you want attention? Even though you've become a father, do you still see yourself as a child?"

"It's not like that!"

What's with this? It's like I'm acting like a spoiled child!

Am I the one who's behaving strangely?

As I held my head in my hands, Grandma sighed and said, "Well, it's too late now."

"...What do you mean?"

"That was when you first defeated a monster, right? We were talking about it with Merlin and Michelle. Even if you were told you came from another world, I wouldn't be surprised. I never thought it was true, but thanks to that, many of my doubts have been cleared."

"I see. So that's how it is. I've always wondered where Shin's ideas about magic came from, but if that's the case, it makes sense."

"To be honest, I had even thought that Shin might not be entirely human. I can accept that much."

"Is Uncle Dis the most ruthless of all!?"

Why does everyone consider me inhuman?

"Well, that's how it is. So even if you tell me now that you have memories from a past life, it's not like I have any other reaction."

"Is that so..."

What the...?

Give me back the determination I had to confess this!

"That aside, Shin, your actions until now were based on your memories from your past life, right?"

"Well, yes."

"In that case, from now on, before you create anything, explain everything to me."

"Everything!?"

"Of course! Your memories are from a world that must have developed as much as the ancient civilization, right? With magical tools based on such memories, there's a possibility they could become a repeat of the ancient civilization!"

"No! Wait a minute! I haven't made anything like weapons or military equipment so far, right?"

When I said that, Grandma started to think.

"Come to think of it, you're right. You've been showing restraint in that regard."

"Not so much restraint... but in the world where I lived in my past life, you couldn't possess weapons or military equipment, so I never had such thoughts. In exchange, alternatives to magical tools had developed significantly."

"I see. Now that you mention it, many of the magical tools you've created have been closely related to daily life."

"That's right."

Just so you know, I'm not a particularly combative person.

The magical tools I develop are mainly to make my own life more convenient.

"Even so, it's better to explain in advance."

"Why?"

"The magical tools you create are too advanced. You might create them without thinking about it because you used them in your past life, but in this world, they can be overly stimulating. It seems you're not very good at gauging things in that regard. If we don't supervise, it could cause chaos in society."

"Even if they're so useful..."

"That's why I'm telling you to take it step by step. You tend to go too far too quickly."

"Ugh..."

It feels like Grandma's words are on point.

The magical tools I create are intended to improve everyone's daily life.

Because they are convenient.

However, when I think about it, the first inventions announced in my past life's world were all quite primitive.

They gradually developed from there, becoming more convenient and multifunctional.

I've been skipping that process.

Come to think of it, that's true.

"So, for now, just explain as much as you remember, what kinds of tools there were."

"But even if you ask me to explain, there were so many that I can't count..."

I'm not sure where to start.

When I said that, Grandma let out a deep sigh.

"Does this mean I have to keep accompanying you on creating magical tools from now on?"

"Well... I'll only make the ones I think are necessary."

"Good, please do."

In the end, even here, my past life's story was accepted without much fuss.

I'm very happy that no one called me sly or found it creepy...

But seriously, is it necessary for everyone to treat me as if I'm not human?
