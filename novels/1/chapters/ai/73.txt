 a fun fact
about the Roman Empire

A few days after the cabinet meeting was held. Since it's uncertain when the demons will attack again, the operation to conquer the demon territory was agreed upon and people from various countries gathered in the Darm Kingdom once more.

This time, it's not the cabinet ministers, but the heads of state who have gathered.

In a sense, it's the world's first summit. It's actually called the World Summit.

During this inaugural World Summit, the signing ceremony of the World Union and the deployment ceremony for the operation to conquer the demon territory will be held simultaneously.

The Union's military cannot gather in the Darm Kingdom, so the military and top officials of the heads of state, along with some soldiers for the deployment ceremony, are participating.

And this declaration will be simultaneously broadcast to the entire Union through communication devices.

Loudspeakers have been set up in each country's communication devices, and both the military and civilians can listen to the declaration.

After hearing the declaration, the armed forces of each country will immediately invade the demon territory.

This is also the first time for such a simultaneous broadcast.

The Darm Kingdom has implemented an extremely tight security measure since the heads of state of the other six countries are gathering here.

There are thorough roadblocks and identity checks. Without a citizen's ID, one would be immediately detained.

Well, in this first-ever World Summit, only heads of state are present here.

If a terrorist incident were to occur, it would cause catastrophic damage to the world.

They must want to be as prepared as possible.

I observed such a tight security measure from the window of the room on the upper floor of the Darm Cathedral that was assigned to us, the Ultimate Magicians.

"Wow, the people of the Darm Kingdom are really on edge. It's not surprising."

"No wonder. It's not just the leaders of all the countries, but also the Pope of the Church of the Creator. If anything happens here, it could plunge the world into a crisis from a different angle than the demons."

Og responded to my muttering. He seemed to be talking calmly, but I could tell that he was slightly excited, which was unusual for him.

After all, it was the first time in history that the heads of state from various countries had gathered.

Of course, the world is not limited to just these seven countries, and beyond Els and East, the world continues to expand, with other continents as well.

This time, only the countries neighboring the former Empire, now the demon territory, and suffering severe damage from the demons have gathered. Even so, the gathering of heads of state is something that was unimaginable until now.

"That's quite polite. Nice to meet you. I am the Crown Prince of the Kingdom of Arlsheid, August von Arlsheid. And this is..."

Og gestured toward me. Oh, do I need to introduce myself too?

"Uhm, nice to meet you. I'm Shin Wolford, representing the Ultimate Magicians."

Is that okay? Thinking that, when Ekaterina, the Pope of the Church of the Creator, smiled gently and addressed me.

"Ah, you are... the 'Messenger of God,' Demon Lord Shin Wolford, aren't you?"

"W-What? 'Messenger of God'?"

What's with that? That's quite an extravagant way to put it! And my demon lord title is adding to the complexity of the names!

"The appearance of the demons this time is truly a global... existential crisis for humanity. In these times, you have appeared with unparalleled strength in human history. We believe that you are the messenger sent by God."

"I-It's too much to say that..."

"Is it? Perhaps it's not entirely wrong, is it?"

I was taken aback by her words.

Certainly, I have a unique background.

Not only do I have memories of my previous life, but I also come from a different world altogether.

If there is a God, maybe He had some intention to reincarnate my soul into this world...

But could it be... that she knows about that?

"Your use of magic seems quite unique. That's why I thought, perhaps..."

"Haha... no, it's not like that. I'm not receiving any instructions from God."

Did I manage to divert her attention? It seems like the Pope thought that my use of magic was unique and wanted to confirm something, but she doesn't seem to genuinely believe that I'm the Messenger of God.

It's more like she was just checking.

But still, 'Messenger of God'... When did people start referring to me that way?

"By the way... Are you?"

The Pope said that and turned her gaze towards Sicily, who was standing next to me.

"Nice to meet you. I'm Sicily von Claude."

"Oh, it is you after all! We finally meet!"

Come to think of it, I heard that the Pope, who was once known as a saint, has been paying close attention to Sicily, who is currently being called by the same title.

Meeting Sicily seemed to have boosted the Pope's spirits. She took Sicily's hand and smiled.

"Hey, are you okay? Have people been bothering you, saying things like 'Act more like a saint' or 'You're supposed to be a saint'?"

"Uh, well, not really..."

"Is that so? In my case, everyone around me was incredibly nagging. I never claimed to be a 'saint,' but they kept on at me..."

Surprisingly, did she not like the title of 'saint'?

"The Ecclesiastical Faction's chosen one isn't forbidden from love, marriage, or childbirth, but just because I'm called a saint, they ban everything... The court ladies around me kept resigning to get married one after another... And then there's Fuller, who keeps making creepy advances..."

It seems like the Pope has some inner darkness and isn't afraid to express it.

"For me... I started being called that after Shin and I got engaged, so it didn't bother me much. Besides, I'm not a clergywoman..."

"That's right! It's about that! Once this operation is over, I came to inform you that it's officially decided that I will officiate your wedding ceremony!"

It's official... I see...

In addition to the book's release, to have the Pope officiate our wedding ceremony... we're going to attract even more attention...

"Hehe. I've read it, Wolford-kun. This."

Saying that, she took out the 'New Heroic Tale' from her spatial storage.

"What?! Th-Thank you..."

It's amazing that it reached even someone like her.

"It was a wonderful story. Their determination, and the love story between Claude-san and you. After reading this book, I felt proud that I would be able to officiate the wedding ceremony for the two of you."

Saying this, she looked at me and Sicily, her smile deepening even more.

This is a true saint... She has followers all over the world, and she is at the pinnacle of the world's largest religion.

Now it's more appropriate to call her 'Mother Mary.' We couldn't help but smile along with her warm expression.

"Just, if you have the wedding ceremony just for the two of you, some people might say things, so it will be a joint ceremony with August-sama and the others, okay? Do you agree?"

"Of course. We would appreciate that."

To avoid people saying things like, "They're having the wedding ceremony without the Crown Prince," we definitely want to go with that option.

"Thank you, Your Holiness. My fianc√©e, Elizabeth, is also delighted."

"Prince August is a great supporter of these two, after all. Haha, there's no doubt this book will become a bestseller. It's such a joy for me as the Pope of the Church of the Creator and as a fan of this book that I can officiate the weddings of the main characters. I can't be happier."

Her occasional down-to-earth side might be one of the reasons people are drawn to her. It's clear that the people of the Holy Kingdom of East and the followers of the Church of the Creator greatly admire her.

"Well, I've conveyed the main message, so I should be going soon. Tomorrow is the signing ceremony and deployment ceremony of the World Union. Let's do our best to bring peace back to the world."

"Yes, absolutely."

When Og responded with determination, the Pope nodded with a smile and left our room.

"...Haa... I never expected His Holiness to visit..."

Even Og seemed quite nervous.

As the head of state of the Holy Kingdom of East, she is also the top figure in the Church of the Creator. Anyone in this world would be nervous.

"Shin, you didn't seem to be very nervous..."

Sicily, who must have been quite nervous too, murmured while exhaling beside me.

"Hmm, like I said before, I didn't even know that there was religion until I came to the capital. So, I can't really grasp the greatness of the Pope."

"Pope..."

"You mustn't say that in front of His Holiness!"

Maria scolded me, and Sicily quickly cautioned me.

"I-I know."

"Really? If it's you, Shin, you might end up calling her 'His Holiness' or 'Miss Ekaterina' right in front of her."

"C-Come on, I'm not that impolite..."

Once I said that, everyone gave me a suspicious look.

...Huh? Are they thinking I'm impolite?

"Judging by how you treat His Highness and His Majesty..."

"I thought Shin was the epitome of politeness!"

"How rude! He's perfectly aware of that!"

Well, because Uncle Dis is treated like a relative, and August is like a cousin, I don't see the need to be overly formal. But with anyone else, I treat them with respect!

"Anyway, please address her as 'Your Holiness' when in public. Please."

If Sicily asks, I can't refuse. I'll call her "Your Holiness" in public.

"...You've gradually become obedient to Sicily."

I chose to ignore Maria's impolite comment.

From the room where the Ultimate Magicians gather, the Pope of the Church of the Creator, Ekaterina, returns to her room.

On her way, one of her attendants inquires about the recent encounter.

"How was it, Your Holiness? About Shin-Wolford."

"Well, I wondered if they had significantly altered his character in that book, claiming it was edited by the Arsheid Kingdom. But it seems not. Despite his language, he doesn't seem to have any ambition."

"Is that so?"

"But more than that, I'm curious about something."

"Curious about something?"

"I'm curious about the 'Messenger.'"

"The Messenger?"

Ekaterina was more concerned about the Messenger than his personality.

Everyone here holds high positions and ranks in the Church of the Creator, and there is no doubt about the existence of God. However, none of them have seen or heard God directly.

God is the foundation of their everyday lives, a source of solace in times of need. Nevertheless, the Pope is curious about the Messenger.

"When I asked him if he might be a Messenger sent by God, he denied it but was clearly shaken."

"What do you mean? Could it be... he really is God's Messenger?"

It seemed the attendant who hadn't been close to the situation didn't understand. However, Ekaterina, who had seen Shin up close, noticed his agitation.

"I don't know. He denied receiving a divine directive."

"...He hasn't received any directive..."

"Right. Which means... he might have actually... come into contact with the presence of God."

"Your Holiness..."

"Yes. It's unfortunate for Wolford, but it's for the sake of world peace. Let him be the divine palanquin to unite the hearts of humanity."

In the near future, there would be a final meeting to approve a certain statement for the signing ceremony.

As Ekaterina, the Pope of the Church of the Creator, walked through the corridors of the Dam Cathedral, she solidified her determination.

The day after Ekaterina, the Pope of the Church of the Creator, met for the first time, the signing ceremony and the launch ceremony were finally held.

The location was the Dam Cathedral.

The heads of state from various countries signed the treaty together, and the document was kept in the Dam Cathedral. After signing the world alliance document in front of the temple, a launch ceremony was held in front of the military and the masses gathered from various countries. This marked the beginning of the campaign to conquer the Demon Territories.

Right now, the signing ceremony is taking place inside the cathedral.

The cathedral's doors are about to open, and the call to launch is about to be made.

"It's finally here."

"Yeah. Once this is over, we can return to a peaceful world like before. We must ensure the success of this operation."

"Ugh... I'm nervous..."

"Are you okay, Maria?"

Oug once again swears to ensure the operation's success.

Maria still seems nervous.

Sicily looks at Maria with concern.

Maria is in the same team as me and Sicily for this operation.

Oug leads the Oug Team, which also includes Thor and Julius.

There's the Mark Team, consisting of Mark, Olivia, and Tony, who recently limited himself to one girlfriend.

Then, there's the Alice Team, with Alice, Lynn, and Yuri, balancing it out with Yuri.

The specifics of how it's balanced remain a secret.

As I think back to the team composition, the doors to the cathedral open. From inside, the seven heads of state, flanked by guards, appear in a line.

The fact that they stand side by side without guards signifies the unity of the World Alliance. The crowd sensed this and erupted in loud cheers.

Then, on the stage set up in front of the cathedral, Ekaterina, the Pope of the Church of the Creator, raises the call to arms. Her charismatic qualities as the Pope of the Church of the Creator, and the careful choice of her words that could be embraced by people from other countries, seem to have led to her selection.

From among the line of heads of state, Ekaterina, the Pope of the Church of the Creator, steps forward.

We were standing towards the edge of the stage, alongside officials from other nations, when Pope Ekaterina turned toward us as she walked to the front. She looked at me and gave a mischievous smile.

...What? I have a bad feeling about this.

"To all of you gathered here, and to everyone listening to this broadcast from the United Nations, the time has come. We, the humans, must rise against the demons who seek to dominate this world!"

Ekaterina's announcement was met with a loud cheer from the crowd assembled in front of the Dam Cathedral. Presumably, those listening to the broadcast were responding in a similar manner.

"However, among all of you, many might be concerned about whether we can truly defeat the demons."

Wait, what? Why is she suddenly expressing doubt? In such a setting, this doesn't seem appropriate...

There were perplexed voices from the audience and the officials around.

"But, everyone, please be reassured. We have God on our side. As evidence of this, God has sent us... Shin=Walford!"

Wait, what?! What is she saying? That person is...?

"I met him personally and became convinced. He is indeed the hope God has sent to us! The girl who supports him, being called a saint, is also a necessity!"

Are you saying I'm the messenger of God, and the saint is my partner by default? This is an incredibly theoretical argument!

"I am convinced! As long as the messenger of God is with us, our victory is unshakable! So, everyone, let's help him and begin the battle to restore peace to the world!"

Once Ekaterina, the Pope, declared this...

"Woooohhh!"

The cheering was even louder than before.

And then, the director of this operation, Director Dominic, who was also the one responsible for planning this mission, said...

"All forces, move out!"

With that command, the soldiers who were staged in front of the cathedral began marching towards the outer walls for dramatic effect.

The United Nations forces listening to this broadcast should have moved out in unison as well.

With Ekaterina's powerful speech, the atmosphere in the venue reached its peak.

As Ekaterina, the Pope, was turning around to return to her position, our eyes met. She playfully stuck out her tongue and winked.

Teehee! What's she doing?! But it strangely suits her.

Anyway, I looked at Dis Uncle, wondering if it was okay to make such statements in front of the public, and he burst into laughter.

Damn it! Is this all planned and approved?

"Good for you, Shin."

"What are you talking about?"

"Now, you're officially God's messenger. You're recognized as humanity's ally."

"...Well, yes, but..."

"And..."

"What?"

"We've got material for the next volume."

I didn't want to provide material for that! superconductors
