 some names
for my cafe-by-day, bar-by-night business

The text you provided is in Japanese. Here's the English translation:

"Ishigama Tei."

Located in the capital city of Earlside, it's not a high-end establishment, but it's a prosperous restaurant with many regular customers who appreciate the exquisite dishes baked in its famous stone oven.

Reservations are hard to come by, and even if you go to the restaurant on the same day, you may have to wait for a while to get a table. Currently, the restaurant has been experiencing even more of a crowd than before.

The line outside the restaurant has become more than twice as long as it used to be.

The reason is...

"Olivia-chan! Can I take your order?"

"Olivia-chan, is the food ready yet?"

"Oliviiia!"

"Yesss! Please wait just a moment!"

The reason is that more and more customers are coming in search of Olivia.

The hottest topic in Earlside right now is the Ultimate Magicians.

They have already defeated numerous demons and are not only praised and envied from all over the world but also recognized as a group of heroes. For the average citizen, there is not much opportunity to meet those who are treated as heroes.

However, the citizens of the capital city knew that one of the Ultimate Magicians was the daughter of the well-known Ishigama Tei.

Before joining the Ultimate Magicians, she used to work as a waitress in the restaurant.

With a hint of curiosity, the capital city residents visited Ishigama Tei. To their surprise, they found Olivia working as a waitress, just as she used to.

Heroes living in a different world from ordinary citizens.

The opportunity to see those heroes up close.

The rumors spread quickly throughout the capital city, and people from all walks of life flocked to see Olivia, even for just a glimpse.

Olivia's parents felt like their daughter had become an attraction, and they told her she didn't need to work at the restaurant. However, with so many customers visiting the restaurant, the revenue was substantial. If Olivia didn't show up and customers went home disappointed, the regulars might not return, and the new customers might never visit the restaurant again.

In the hopes of increasing the family business's revenue, Olivia endured the embarrassment of receiving more attention than she needed from everyone and continued working at the restaurant.

And most of the customers who visited the restaurant were satisfied if they could see Olivia working. However, there were some troublesome customers among them.

It seems that Olivia alone cannot handle the crowd in this packed restaurant.

Naturally, there are other waitresses and waiters, but some customers express their dissatisfaction because Olivia is not attending to them.

"Welcome. Have you decided on your order?"

"Hey! I called for Olivia! Why isn't Olivia here?"

It appears that the middle-aged man, somewhat well-dressed and overweight, was displeased that someone other than Olivia came to take his order.

"Miss Olivia is currently occupied with other tasks. Please understand."

"Why? Didn't she attend to the customers over there? Is this place discriminating against customers?"

The middle-aged man voiced his dissatisfaction loudly because his demands were not met.

He seemed unfazed by the annoyed glances of the other customers.

The waitstaff attending to customers were unsure of how to handle this troublesome customer.

After all, he was a customer, and raising complaints might lead to a bad reputation for the restaurant.

"Enough! Call Olivia already!"

"What's the matter, sir?"

Amid the continuous demands for Olivia, a woman approached the man.

She was a woman in her thirties with straight black hair.

She was Olivia's mother.

"Was there any issue?"

"Of course, there was an issue! Why isn't Olivia attending to me but this person?"

The waitress, referred to as 'this person' by the middle-aged man, had a vein popping on her forehead, but Olivia's mother looked puzzled.

"Even if you ask why. She is a waitress at this establishment. It's only natural for her to serve customers, isn't it?"

"That's not what I'm asking! I want Olivia to attend to me!"

"Hmm. You're saying strange things."

"Strange things?"

Olivia's mother responded to the middle-aged man's anger with a troubled expression. The man's face turned beet red in rage.

"Yeah! How can this establishment allow a mere waitress to talk to me like that? I'm a bureaucrat! I manage this country! And she dares to speak to me like this!"

It seems that this man is a bureaucrat from some government office.

He seems to hold the common bureaucratic belief that he's important because he runs the country.

His unattractive, obese body seemed to reflect this attitude.

He was likely taking advantage of various privileges and using his special status to his advantage.

As a result, he believed he deserved special treatment.

"Okay, just bring Olivia already!"

At that moment, when the customers in the entire restaurant were growing increasingly angry with the man, Olivia spoke up.

"Mom, it's okay."

"Oh, Olivia."

"That person is not a customer. Let's ask him to leave for obstructing business."

"Wha..."

Behind her mother, Olivia appeared and suggested asking him to leave due to business disruption.

When the man heard this, he was temporarily speechless with anger.

Finally, when he could speak again, he raised his voice in anger.

"You! How dare a lowly waitress like you speak to me like this!"

It seemed that this man, in his excitement, had completely forgotten who Olivia was and why the restaurant was so crowded.

"You've brought shame upon me! I'll use my power to shut down this place!"

Finally, he uttered such words.

The employees at Ishigama Tei, who had remained silent until now, seemed to think they had achieved their goal.

But before he could say anything more...

"...What is a low-ranking official like you saying?"

"W-What? A low-ranking official? You dare call me a low-ranking official?"

Olivia's mother, with a business smile, said something outrageous.

"Mom?"

"Have you been listening quietly all this time, calling someone else's daughter by her first name so casually? You think it's normal for a woman you like to serve you? Are you a regular at such places? We are not that kind of establishment."

"Huh?"

While Olivia's mother was angry while maintaining a business smile, both Olivia and the middle-aged man looked bewildered.

"By your standards, it seems like you believe it's natural for a woman you like to serve you, but we are not that kind of place."

"Wha..."

The middle-aged man flapped his mouth without being able to counter, and laughter erupted from the entire restaurant.

And then, voices of condemnation towards the middle-aged man erupted from various corners, saying things like, "He's a nuisance!" and "We're trying to enjoy our meal, don't make us uncomfortable!"

"Moreover, you want to shut down this restaurant?"

"Uh, well..."

"Have you forgotten? Our daughter is one of the Ultimate Magicians. Do you know who's in that group?"

After being told this, the middle-aged man finally regained his composure and began to remember various things.

Right now, the woman standing behind the woman expressing her opinion towards him is not just a mage from another race, but she's also a member of the team known as the world's most powerful group of magicians, the Ultimate Magicians, who are also considered as the ultimate royalty, and even legendary heroes are a part of it.

"Uh...uh, well..."

"You were ready to shut down a place connected to them? You've got some nerve, don't you?"

The middle-aged man might hold a high position as a bureaucrat in the government, but the Ultimate Magicians, whom this restaurant's daughter is part of, have the supreme royalty and legendary heroes.

He had said he would use his power to shut down such a place.

The middle-aged man quickly turned pale.

"Th-this matter, could we keep it confidential..."

"Well, we don't do such things, you know. But..."

Olivia's mother looked around slowly.

"You can't control what people say, can you?"

Olivia's mother, who had stopped her business smile and now looked troubled.

The middle-aged man realized that the disdainful and resentful gazes were focused on him throughout the restaurant.

He had announced his intention to shut down a restaurant with connections to the royal family.

The realization that his face was exposed in front of so many people hit him.

Among the people here, there might be someone who recognized him.

The middle-aged man felt a chill down his spine.

"Ah! Ah!"

Without thinking, he cried out, covered his face, and left the restaurant without placing an order.

"Oh, there's an empty table. Olivia, please seat the customers."

"Uh, yes."

She didn't raise her voice particularly. She maintained her business smile.

However, she must have been quite angry. She calmly cornered the middle-aged man and eventually made him leave.

While thinking that even her own mother could be quite frightening, Olivia went outside to usher waiting customers into the restaurant.

The other customers who had witnessed this cheered her on, perhaps mistaking the entire sequence of events for some kind of event.

"Sorry for the commotion."

"Don't worry, we were all fed up with that guy! Your firm words were a relief."

"That's right, that's right!"

It seemed that everyone shared the same sentiments, and the applause continued.

Then, a new customer entered the restaurant, and it goes without saying that they were confused by the commotion happening inside.

While the commotion was occurring inside the restaurant, a young man arrived at Ishigama Tei.

He glanced at the long queue outside and, while still thinking that it was quite popular, attempted to enter the restaurant, ignoring the line.

This was a clear act of cutting in line, and one of the men waiting in the queue called out to him.

"Hey, you!"

"Yes? What's up?"

The young man was Mark.

"What's the matter with you? Can't you see we're waiting in line?"

"Huh? Oh, it's fine. I'm not a customer."

"Huh? You're not a customer?"

"Yeah... whoa!"

"Eek!"

While Mark and the man at the front of the line were having a conversation, the middle-aged man, who had covered his face, ran through them and escaped.

There was a moment of bewilderment for the two, but the man at the front of the line recovered first.

"What do you mean you're not a customer? Oh, I see, you came to hit on Olivia, didn't you!?"

"What!?"

"You came to hit on Olivia!?"

In response to the man at the front's words, even the customers who were waiting behind him reacted.

"Huh? No, I didn't come to hit on her..."

When Mark was about to say something...

"We apologize for the wait. Please come inside."

"Huh? Oh, Olivia."

"Yes? Please come inside... Oh, Mark."

"Yeah."

As Olivia tried to guide the waiting customers into the restaurant, she noticed Mark and called out to him.

The friendly interaction between them and Mark's attitude.

The male customers in the queue noticed this and began to get excited.

"Sorry, Mark."

The men, who had been in an uproar, heard comments like, "He got rejected," and "Serves him right," after Olivia said, "Sorry." But...

"It's not over yet. Wait in the room."

"Sure. Good luck."

"Yeah!"

Saying that, Mark entered the restaurant and went into a private area at the back of the restaurant.

The male customers heard words that were hard to believe: "Wait in the room." This implied that the man called Mark had a very close relationship with Olivia.

In response to this despairing revelation, the male customers, in general, sank into a state of disbelief.

The female customers, who were looking at the male customers with disdain, couldn't help but be curious about Olivia's relationship with the man from earlier.

"Hey, Olivia, who was that guy from earlier?"

"Her boyfriend? Her boyfriend?"

"Yes, that's right."

With Olivia's confirmation of her boyfriend, the female customers became even more animated, while the male customers felt even more disheartened.

Ignoring the male customers for some reason, the female customers became even more excited.

"Tell us! What's he like? How long have you been dating?"

"Yeah! Right, Olivia, we'll judge if he's suitable for you!"

"Huh? What are you talking about?"

"Shut up! Olivia, who is he and where is he from?"

For some reason, the male customers revived, and they eagerly observed Mark.

In response to this, the female customers grew even more disdainful, and Olivia looked bewildered, saying, "Why?"

"Olivia!"

"Yes!? Um, well, Mark and I are childhood friends..."

"Ugh! Childhood friends... She played a tough card right off the bat!"

"They're dating because they're childhood friends! Lovely!"

"That's it!?"

"Huh? That's it? Um, Mark is the son of Bean Workshop..."

"Bean Workshop!?"

It was the male customers who were surprised by those words.

There were quite a few hunters among the male customers.

And for the hunters, the weapons and armor from Bean Workshop were objects of admiration.

The son of such a workshop.

There was nothing more to argue about.

The male customers thought this, and they felt despondent, but the female customers latched onto something else.

"Isn't he the son of Bean Workshop? Wasn't he in the Ultimate Magicians?"

"Yes, that's right!"

"Moreover, in the Ultimate Magicians!?"

The female customers became even more animated at this, while the male customers turned pale.

"Um, I should probably head back soon..."

"Oh, I'm sorry. Good luck with your work."

"Sure. But I'm almost done."

"Yeah, your boyfriend is waiting in the room, right?"

"......Yes."

With a bashful response, Olivia entered the restaurant, and the female customers watched her with warm glances.

"Mom, I'm going up because Mark is here."

"Oh, is it that time already? Well, good job. You can go up."

"Yes."

Saying this, Olivia happily disappeared into the back of the restaurant.

Witnessing this scene were those who sent warm, approving gazes and those who harbored feelings of jealousy toward Mark, who wasn't there.

In a certain open cafe in the Royal Capital of Arlsheid, a couple, presumably on a date, were having tea. The woman appeared tired compared to the cheerful man.

"Huff... What's the matter, Lilia? Why are you sighing so heavily?"

"I just can't help it... Tony, how can you stay so composed?"

Tony and Lilia were a couple.

"Well, everyone around me seems to be engaged, so I'm starting to think it's normal."

"Really... Why does everyone want to get people married off so badly?"

"Haha, your parents earlier were quite interesting."

"Absolutely. Yesterday, when I told them I was bringing my boyfriend, they said, 'We won't approve!' But just a moment ago, my father suddenly said, 'Take care of our daughter.'"

"That's right! And once they found out that you're an Ultimate Magician, they did a complete 180... And after hearing about your earnings, my mom was like..."

"Lilia! You should get married soon! Don't let him go for sure!'" She said with a fierce look... It's so embarrassing!"

It seems Tony went to meet her family.

Regardless of whether they were going to get married or not, introducing a boyfriend or girlfriend to parents is quite common. However, it seems Lilia's parents were fervently hoping for her to marry Tony.

"Anyway, we're still students, aren't we? Both you and I are attending the academy, and getting married at this point is too early."

"That's right. I think I want to remain single a bit longer too."

Tired of the constant pressure from those around her to get married, Lilia, who seemed to resonate with this sentiment, expressed her own desire to remain single for a while longer.

Upon hearing this, Lilia's eyes narrowed slightly, and she asked, "Hmm... What are your intentions for staying single, I wonder?"

"Wait, Lilia?"

"Hmph! Tony, you're quite popular with the ladies, aren't you? Are you planning to play around again?"

Lilia, who knew that Tony had dated multiple girls during their middle school days, cast a suspicious gaze at him, wondering if he intended to engage in such behavior once more.

"Well, no, I don't have such intentions. It's just that I find it fun to hang out with Shin and the others, and I thought that once we're married, we might not be able to hang out as freely, you know?"

"I'm not so sure about that. If you ever cheat on me, we're getting a divorce!"

"Lilia... Divorce?"

"Huh?! N-No, that's not it! We'll break up, I mean!"

Perhaps because they had been talking about marriage, she said "divorce" instead of "break up." She turned red in the face, as it seemed like she was eager to get married. Tony was enjoying the flustered state of his girlfriend once again.

"Hey, Lilia, good morning!"

"Oh, good morning."

Unlike the Magic Academy and the Knight Academy, where the students were involved in the Demon Realm Campaign, the Accounting Institute continued its regular classes. Lilia, who had arrived at the institute as usual, was approached by a female classmate.

"Hey, Lilia. We saw you yesterday."

"Yesterday?"

"You went on a date, didn't you?"

"Huh?!"

Just like other institutes, the Accounting Institute also had a hundred students in each year, but unlike the practical Magic Academy and Knight Academy, the classes at the Accounting Institute were divided into four classes from A to D, each with twenty-five students.

Upon hearing the surprising words from their female classmates, the male students, who comprised half of the institute's students, let out a collective exclamation. Lilia was considered one of the most beautiful girls among the first-year students this year. While many male students had their sights set on her, they never expected Lilia to already have a boyfriend.

They fervently hoped it was a misunderstanding or that he was just a male friend. However...

"Why were you watching us? You could have at least said something."

"No, no. I couldn't just talk to someone who looked so affectionate while walking arm in arm with her boyfriend."

They had been walking arm in arm.

At this point, the hearts of the male students were on the verge of breaking, but there was still a possibility of a misunderstanding.

To bolster their spirits and pretend to be disinterested, the male students focused all their attention on the conversation between the two girls.

It appeared as though they had no interest in the conversation. However, the female students could easily see through the act. Lilia planned to extract more reliable information from Lilia to further frustrate the male students.

"After that, you were having tea at the cafe, right? What were you talking about with such serious expressions?"

"About that..."

In response to the female student's question, Lilia remembered her parents' behavior from the day before.

"Why is it that parents always encourage marriage when they see financially well-off people?"

"Hahaha!"

The male students coughed up blood and collapsed. Suggesting marriage when they were still just dating was absurd. The male students' hearts were completely broken in this seemingly hopeless situation.

The female student who had extracted this surprising answer was momentarily frozen. She hadn't expected such a response.

Regaining her composure, she questioned Lilia as to why she would bring up such a topic.

"Wait, wait! Marriage all of a sudden? Is it already heading in that direction?"

"Hmm? Well, no, but after I introduced him to my parents yesterday, they told me to get married quickly."

Sighing, Lilia explained. The female student was now interested in her boyfriend, who was recommended to get married after a simple introduction.

"What kind of boyfriend is he, exactly? He doesn't sound ordinary."

"No, he's not, he's not..."

Lilia thought of her boyfriend, who was anything but ordinary. The female student couldn't contain her curiosity about who this boyfriend was.

"Moreover, your boyfriend looked about the same age as you. What's going on? Is he a nobleman's son?"

"No, he's a commoner."

"Now I'm even more confused!"

Lilia's boyfriend, who was not a nobleman's son but a commoner, only added to the confusion of the female student. Because, before entering a marriage, there should be some financial foundation to sustain the married life. Otherwise, marriage wouldn't even be a consideration.

"Income? Well, he and Mr. Wolford developed a weapon that got adopted as the military's standard equipment, so it seems he receives a substantial sum as an idea fee every month."

"Military's standard equipment? That's..."

As students studying economics at an academy, they couldn't be unaware of how much income could be obtained by having one's creation adopted as the standard equipment of a massive organization like the military. However, the female student noticed something else, something astonishing, from Lilia's response.

"Wait a minute. Mr. Wolford? Is that the same Wolford?"

"I don't know which Wolford it is, but he's the most famous Wolford in this capital."

Upon hearing Lilia's words, the female student was shocked.

"W-Why? Why does your boyfriend know Mr. Wolford?"

"Wolford-sama..." Lilia thought in her heart but didn't say it out loud. She refrained because this was a typical reaction for girls of the same age.

Despite being of the same generation, the Ultimate Magicians had already achieved more than past heroes. They were the leaders, the Demon Lord, and the messengers of the gods. Referring to them with honorifics was simply natural for girls their age.

"Why? Tell me why!"

"Well, even if you ask me..."

Lilia revealed while looking at the girl's face.

"Because he's an Ultimate Magician."

"What!?"

This conversation between Lilia and the female student had already been overheard by everyone in the class. And when the shocking truth was revealed by Lilia, the entire class couldn't help but exclaim.

The female student who heard Lilia's confession looked at her with an astonished expression and said:

"Lilia."

"What?"

"Get married."

"Huh?"

Lilia, who hadn't expected such a remark from her classmate, let out an absentminded voice.

"Because that's the right thing to do! You can't just let such an excellent catch roll around somewhere else!"

"But, uh... Isn't it a bit too early?"

"Early or late, who cares! If you don't want to get married, then marry me!"

"Why would it come to that?"

"Because...!"

The female student who said that started shedding tears. Lilia tried to console the crying girl, albeit somewhat taken aback.

"Hey, why are you crying?"

"But, you know, it's enviable..."

Tears of frustration welled up in her eyes.

Lilia, who had initially panicked at the sudden revelation, managed to calm the female student and began explaining her situation.

"You say it's enviable, but it's not all that great, you know?"

"Why are you being so picky? You're going to marry a super-famous person!"

This time, the girl was getting angry. It seemed that the shock had made her emotionally unstable.

"No, listen, the Ultimate Magicians are not a popular band, you know? They're a combat group."

"Oh..."

Undoubtedly, they were the most famous group in the kingdom, if not the world. However, their actual nature was that of a group of magicians. Their primary area of operation was, of course...

"These people are usually on the front lines of the battlefield, you know?"

"..."

"Even in this operation, their mission was to 'subdue a demon.'"

"Demon..."

At those words, Lilia's classmates recalled. The citizens of Earlsheid, who had once been on the verge of destruction due to demons in the past, were supposed to feel more threatened by demons than people from other countries.

While they had almost forgotten this fact due to the frequent victories, their opponents were indeed demons.

Now, the students were reminded of this fact.

"Even though they are the same age as us... they were sent to subdue a demon. I couldn't help but feel worried until he returned..."

"Lilia..."

To believe in your loved one and wait for them, that's all you can do when your partner is sent to the battlefield to subdue a demon. That was what Lilia conveyed to the female student.

"To have a member of the Ultimate Magicians as a boyfriend, that's what it entails. Do you want to go through that kind of experience?"

"No..."

They didn't want to have such experiences at their age, at fifteen or sixteen. Furthermore, it wasn't just for the moment. They'd have to keep experiencing it for a long time to come.

However, that was precisely why the female student had a question.

"Hey, Lilia. Even though you know you'll go through such experiences, why are you dating him?"

Lilia, who was aware of the emotional turmoil involved, had asked her if she was prepared for such hardships, and she continued to date her Ultimate Magicians boyfriend.

It might have seemed contradictory, but Lilia stated it clearly.

"Because... I love him..."

"Wow..."

As Lilia blushed and confessed, the female students blushed as well.

And the way they looked at Lilia changed.

Just the other day, they thought she was merely a first-year student at the same high school as them. However, the classmate before them had a love they didn't yet understand and carried burdens they didn't yet know.

To the female students, Lilia suddenly appeared more mature.

Feeling a little regret for having asked about her and her boyfriend out of curiosity, the female student decided to speak to Lilia.

"I see. Then I hope everything turns out well this time."

"Yeah. I hope there won't be any more deployments."

"That's right. We won't be able to sleep from worry again."

"Yeah... Oh, wait, no, I didn't mean it like that!"

Lilia hadn't said she couldn't sleep before, but the female student's suggestive questioning led her to deny it hastily.

And it seemed that her response pleased the female student.

"Oh, come on! Lilia, you're so cute!"

"Hey! Don't hug me!"

"It's fine! Lilia is cute!"

"Stop! Don't touch me in weird places!"

"Hehe. It's alright, isn't it? It's alright!"

As they began to playfully tease each other, the female students watched them with warm smiles.

The male students, feeling intense jealousy after hearing the story, shed metaphorical tears of blood. They had given up because they knew there was no chance if the other person was an Ultimate Magician. They watched the scene with a slight slump in their posture.
