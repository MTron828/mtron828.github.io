"Seems like you care a lot about your older sister.

'Lord Wolford... Oh, and the Saint as well, Wolford, right? Um...'

'You can just call me Shin.'

'I'd prefer if you called me Sicily. It's embarrassing to be called a Saint...'

Sicily said this while blushing, and Shaolin looked at us with a moved expression.

'Lord Shin, Lady Sicily, thank you for everything you're doing for us. If my sister can be saved, our guild might still recover.'

'I'm doing everything I can, but it's not certain she'll be saved.'

'Even so, if there's even a glimmer of hope...'

Shaolin seems really determined to fully cure her sister.

It's understandable, considering she's family.

But what does that have to do with the guild?

'Um, may I ask a question? I understand your desire to cure your sister, but how does that relate to the survival of the guild?'

When I asked that, Shaolin began to speak with a bitter expression.

'...My sister is the head of our guild. Everything began when she fell ill.'" thank-you note
