"Ultimate Magicians New Member Recruitment"

This announcement sent shockwaves not only through Arlshyde but also to the surrounding countries.

"The Strongest Group of Magicians in History"

"Heroes Who Contributed to the Demon Lord War"

"Saviors of the World"

They were often referred to by various titles, and they were widely admired by the masses.

If possible, one would want to join their ranks.

If you were a magician, you would at least consider such a thing.

However, the Ultimate Magicians were an organization formed only by their peers from the Advanced Magical Academy, known for their close-knit nature, making external recruitment seem unlikely.

But this sudden call for new members changed everything.

Naturally, magicians from various countries were thrilled, and then most of them fell into despair.

This was because the recruitment criteria for new members included a condition that specified, "Those who graduated from each country's magical academies last year and this year."

Those who graduated from magical academies more than two years ago were not even eligible to apply.

As a result, many magicians were excluded due to this condition, leading to lamentations and sorrow everywhere.

Some even attempted to protest, but when they heard the words from the representatives of various countries, "Those who have served long in each country's organizations are likely to know internal matters. If you've only been a member for about a year, you probably wouldn't have access to the organization's secrets," they reluctantly had to agree.

In the midst of all this, those who were lucky enough to meet the condition rushed to apply.

Initially, it was thought that the examinations would be held at the Ultimate Magicians' office in Arlshyde, but due to the overwhelming number of applicants, it was suddenly decided to hold the preliminary exams in various countries.

Several weeks passed after the first round of exams, and finally, the successful candidates were announced.

The pass rate was abnormally low, and the successful candidates were not even 10% of the total applicants.

For most of the unsuccessful candidates, their feelings were more of "I knew it" as they hadn't expected to pass in the first place, having applied just on a whim.

However, there were some individuals who felt anger at their own failure.

"What!? Why did I fail!?"

This individual had always been at the top in their country's magical academy.
