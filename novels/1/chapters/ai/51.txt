It took some time to convince Ellie, who had once again caused a strange misunderstanding.

In this world, I've never heard of people with such interests, but do you really have a corrupted mind...

"Seriously... Why does your thinking always veer in that direction so quickly?"

"Because... we've been together for so long... even though we joke around, it feels like there's something connecting us..."

"Indeed! Shin, you can keep up with His Highness's complicated conversations, right?"

"That's right. I often understand His Highness's intentions with just a word."

"Alice! Thor! What kind of support are you giving?"

Are you trying to make the misunderstanding worse?

"Stop saying silly things, everyone. If Shin has been taught magic, he should understand. This guy's head is a bit strange."

"Why am I being belittled?"

"I'm praising you. According to Merida, he seems to be able to use the current magic on his own. What kind of mental structure does he have..."

It's a forbidden technique...

"Well, as long as it's not with another woman, it's fine."

"That's a strange way to agree!"

"It's a perfect match."

Maria even joined in!

"Shin, is that true?"

"Even Cecily!?"

Oh, Cecily, why did you have to come up with something weird too!

"That's not true!"

"But..."

"...Well, do you want me to prove it's not true?"

"Huh... Shin?"

Shin pulled Cecily closer and leaned in towards her face...

"Hey! Don't get carried away in a place like this!"

"Oops, my bad."

"Ah... Ah..."

This is bad... It was just about to get really intense.

"It's incredible... doing this in front of everyone..."

"Mark, don't imitate this, okay?"

"You still need mosaic!"

Oh dear... I might end up attacking before the ceremony.

"Ellie, do you understand now? Shin is head over heels for Claude, just as I said. There's no room for other women, including me."

"Ah... I... I understand..."

Ellie blushed and accepted it.

It was worth almost causing a scene.

"Shin, you're unbelievable! Seriously!"

"Oops, sorry, Cecily."

Cecily also blushed and playfully tapped me.

What's this? Cute.

"Ah... Shall we continue this silly couple's conversation?"

"Yeah, my bad. So, when are we going?"

Let's stop the joking around here and have a serious discussion.

"I'd prefer to leave as soon as tomorrow, but is that okay?"

"I'm fine with it, but is it alright with you? Don't you have the celebration for becoming the Crown Prince?"

"It's a festival for the citizens. I don't need to be present."

I see. Oug isn't the type to join in with everyone's revelry.

"Plus, we should be able to get back within a few days. We can return before the celebration ends."

"Right, so shall we leave tomorrow? We'll temporarily suspend the training camp."

"Suspending the training camp... What on earth are you talking about? And traveling to different countries..."

"Oh, well..."

Oug explained to Ellie and Mei-chan.

"I want to go too! I want to go!"

"But we're not going to have fun. It's your brother who's going to talk to foreign kings. While he's doing that, Shin onii-chan will be free! I want to tour foreign cities!"

"Indeed, with all of you around, there couldn't be a better escort, and I feel safe to go sightseeing."

"Huh? Are we going too? Isn't it just the Crown Prince and Shin?"

"Just the two of us are a bit..."

"The misunderstanding still hasn't cleared up, huh? And is Ellie planning to come along as well?"

"I said it earlier, but it would be the safest trip with everyone."

"It's not a vacation..."

"August-sama, please do your best with the meetings with the leaders of the various countries. In the meantime, we'll have some time to ourselves."

"...Hey, Shin. Ellie wasn't like this before. What's going on?"

"It's not my fault, is it?"

It's actually the women from our group!

"Alice! Lynn!"

"Peep, peep."

You can't even whistle!

Alice mimicked blowing a whistle while avoiding eye contact.

That's so irritating!

"It's not our fault. I think Ellie was always like this."

"Well, we've become quite close to each other during the training camp."

"See, it's Lynn and the others' fault!"

"But it's true that I envied you for a bit, watching everyone."

"Calling each other by name and everything, we really got close during the training camp."

"Hey, it's not their fault."

"But the thing I envied the most was the interaction between Shin-san and August-sama."

"See, it's you after all."

"Seriously?"

"If I back down now, August-sama might be taken by Shin-san."

"The way you compete is weird!"

"It's a perfect match."

"We've had enough of that!"

It runs deep! How do I make them understand?

"Hey, is that okay? If you marry August-sama and become the Crown Prince's consort or queen, you won't be able to travel abroad so easily anymore."

"...True, I won't be able to travel abroad casually once that happens. Is it okay with all of you? I was thinking of taking a break, but..."

"I'm fine with it, Your Highness."

"Me too! I want to go on a trip to foreign countries!"

In the end, Oug gave in and decided to take Ellie and Mei-chan along.

I almost forgot, but Ellie will become the Crown Prince's consort.

After that, it won't be easy to travel abroad casually. It will become a significant event every time.

As escorts, we all decided to go together. It's like taking a break from the training camp.

We've already dealt with subjugating the demons, and we're going to various countries to prepare for the appearance of demons, so sightseeing on the side isn't inappropriate.

"So, Oug, do your best with the meetings."

"...That's true, but it annoys me when Shin says it..."

"Heh heh, I've been teased enough until now. I need to get back at him sometimes."

"Heh... You have some nerve... Are you serious, Oug?"

"Yeah... Be prepared."

What's going on? This tension between me and Oug!

An unspoken comment that won't get through is better left unsaid. Let's plan the trip.

The entire itinerary will involve using floating magic for aerial transportation.

Since Ellie can't use magic, Oug will be carrying her, and Mei-chan, who has just learned magic, will hold hands with me and Cecily for support.

"I love floating magic because it's fun! Shin onii-chan, please take care of me, Cecily-san!"

"Hehe, looking forward to it, Mei-hime-sama."

"Yes! I'm really looking forward to this trip since it's my first time!"

"...Actually, it's not exactly a trip."

"It's just a side thing, a side thing. I thought it would be a pity to accompany a long holiday with just training."

"That's true."

And so, we decided to act in complete secrecy.

It could be troublesome if our identities were known, and there's a possibility of being targeted.

While we won't allow such things to happen as long as we're here, it's better to reduce the risk.

We also decided to stay in regular inns.

We could return every day through the gate, but...

"If we did that, it would ruin the charm of the journey, wouldn't it?"

Ellie, who wanted to enjoy the journey, shot down that idea.

Well, on the final day, we will return via the gate.

"All right, with this, we have a rough plan."

"It's not really a plan, but more like a policy. In the end, we're staying in inns spontaneously."

"That's part of the charm of traveling, right?"

Oug also decided to embrace the idea of a journey.

Well, it's pointless to stubbornly resist by myself.

"We already have the luggage for the training camp, so there's no need to prepare anything special. Let's meet at Shin's house tomorrow morning. You all worked hard today. Rest up, okay?"

"Yes!"

"Shin, Claude."

"What is it?"

"What's up, Your Highness?"

"...Rest well, okay?"

"You, really..."

"Ugh..."

Why did he have to say that when parting ways? It's so awkward!

"Huh? The two of you will assist Mei from tomorrow. Rest well and get yourselves in good shape, brothers."

"You...!"

This is... Oug's serious side!

"August-sama is our brother?"

"It's the first time I've heard that!"

"You're doing something stupid again. Let's go home. Well then, Your Highness, thank you for your hard work."

"Yeah, thanks."

"Come on! Shin, we're leaving. Cecily, stop blushing!"

"Wait, Maria!"

"I'm not waiting! Come on, Cecily!"

"Wait, Maria!"

In the end, Maria dragged us out of Oug's room.

You, Oug!

Cecily won't look at me because of your words!

"Cut it out already! These lovebirds!"

At that shout, the guide soldiers were trying to hold back their laughter.

You...

In August's room where Shin and the team had left, August, Elizabeth, and Mei were the only ones left.

"Phew... It's finally quiet."

"The main cause of the commotion was mainly Onii-sama and Shin onii-chan."

"That's really true. I only see August-sama act like that when he's with Shin."

"Come on, Ellie, enough..."

"Hehe, I understand. Shin only has eyes for Cecily."

"Well, then..."

"I envy it. August-sama being open with Shin..."

"Is that so?"

"Yes. But during the training camp, Alice and Lynn treated me as an equal, and I understood August-sama's feelings."

Elizabeth, who had been with the research club's women during the training camp, had requested the women of the club to take an equal attitude, as it was difficult to interact with a formal attitude.

However, Elizabeth was a duchess, and normally, such a request would not change her attitude, but the women of the research club, who had seen the interactions between Shin and August, accepted Elizabeth's request and began to take an equal attitude.

"I am the highest-ranking duke among the nobility, so no matter how much you ask me to relax, I maintained a formal attitude."

"That's right. I was the same."

In August's case, he was even higher in rank as a member of the royal family. Besides his father Diaseum and his mother and sister, there were very few people with whom he took an equal attitude.

"I was happy. To have a conversation in the same position as girls of the same age. To have fun in our pajamas with friends. To go shopping together during the free time at the training camp."

"...You were doing such things?"

"Yes. That's why I can understand August-sama's feelings now. It's because it's just Shin, that he can have such interactions with August-sama."

"I told the others not to be conscious of it, but they couldn't help it."

"Because you're royalty, it's impossible."

August had hoped that the other members of the research club would take the same attitude as Shin, but that wish had not been fulfilled.

"So I understand that August-sama enjoys his interactions with Shin."

"Then why?"

"Shin is still the one I envy. So I thought I'd cause a little trouble..."

"...Ellie, were you always like this?"

"Oh, August-sama, I never expected you to have such a personality either."

"I knew it!"

"Mei, be quiet."

"Eek! Ellie-nee, help!"

Mei, whose head was gripped by August, sought Elizabeth's help.

"Hehe, Mei is so cute. She's someone who treats August-sama and me as equals."

As she saved Mei from August, Elizabeth spoke.

"That's not true! There's still a distance between us at the elementary school, and August onii-sama is mean... I'm happy that Shin onii-chan is my onii-chan!"

"Hehe, a kind onii-chan, right?"

"Yes!"

"You guys..."

"Yes, we're running away, Mei!"

"Yes!"

"Hey, wait!"

The three of them raced around the room, screaming.

The distance that had once existed between these three had completely disappeared.

(Since I got involved with Shin, our relationships have changed quite a bit.)

As August chased after them, he thought about that.

While Shin and the members of the Ultimate Magicians were making noise in August's room, there were shadows gathering in the city of the fallen old empire.

"What the hell! What is this?!"

"What in the world... what's happening?"

"I don't know! What is that barrier in the first place? Our magic didn't work at all!"

"How many people broke through the walls?"

"I don't know... about twenty, maybe?"

"Only that many..."

"And most of them were killed! Who the hell are they? They're like monsters!"

"Are there guys like that outside the empire..."

These were the magical beings who had invaded the Kingdom of Sued, only to be repelled by Shin and the others.

They had been arrogant, thinking that they could easily conquer a small country like the Kingdom of Sued with their power.

As a result, they had no strategy and had attacked directly. They were initially stopped by Shin's defensive magical tools in front of the city walls, and only after finally breaking through did they begin their attack on the capital of the Kingdom of Sued. They were ultimately repelled by Shin and his companions.

They had underestimated the power of the magical beings, and in the end, they had to retreat.

"They were a piece of cake until those guys showed up..."

"By the way, they mentioned Arlsheid..."

"Yeah, they did."

"...So that means it's reinforcement from Arlsheid. Since Sued borders Arlsheid, if they attack a country farther from Arlsheid, they won't be able to receive reinforcements."

"Right! That's clever!"

"Hmph, I'm the smartest among us. I'll come up with a plan, so make sure to work hard."

"...Yeah..."

It seems that among the magical beings, there are those with a bit of intelligence, but he doesn't realize certain things.

He doesn't understand how little time passed from their attack to the arrival of reinforcements, how the communication with Arlsheid was made, and how long it would take to reach the Kingdom of Sued.

These thoughtless magical beings started planning their next attack, thinking that it would be safe as long as they were farther from Arlsheid.

And while the magical beings were retreating, there was a group observing the Kingdom of Sued from a distant location using far-seeing magic.

"Hehehe, hahaha, ahahahahahaha!"

Rolling on the ground with laughter, Strom was having a great time. He was watching the departing magical beings and found their fate to be quite entertaining.

However, Strom was the only one truly enjoying himself. The others watched in horror.

"That's... that's Shin=Wolford..."

"It's not just one person, Lady Miria. In total..."

"...There are twelve of them."

"Even though they may have been composed of civilians who couldn't use magic, is it really that easy for him to defeat them all?"

"It wouldn't be wise to oppose them."

"That's impossible."

While Miria, Zest, and the others were trying to avoid hostility towards Shin and his group, who easily defeated the magical beings attacking the Kingdom of Sued, Strom denied their hope outright.

"Why? If we oppose them, we won't get away unharmed..."

"That's true, especially considering Shin=Wolford. I'm not even sure if I can defeat him."

"Then why?"

"Do they know our situation?"

"No... that's..."

"That's right. So they would probably think something like this: 'A group of magical beings instructed by Oliver=Strom attacked the Kingdom of Sued.'"

"Th-that's true..."

"In that case, what if we try to clarify this misunderstanding?"

Strom's idea was accurate. In fact, Shin and August, too, thought along the same lines.

A magical being suggested to Strom that they should try to clear up the misunderstanding, even though they had made these assumptions.

However...

"It's impossible, isn't it? Do you think they will listen to my words now, considering everything?"

"T-that's..."

"Besides, I have no intention to do that now."

"What? What do you mean by that?"

"Nothing. Well, we've seen enough of this entertaining spectacle. Shall we head back?"

"Yes..."

Strom's mutterings went unheard by everyone.

No one knew what Strom was truly thinking, as his thoughts remained locked in his heart. options trading
