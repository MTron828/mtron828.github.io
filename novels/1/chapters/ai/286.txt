about Sharky, a tooth-brushing shark superhero

Switching gears, August headed to the city of Ulst.

This city is known for issuing citizen certificates.

In front of the lord's mansion, various elite individuals from different countries, such as soldiers and members of various national law enforcement agencies, stood guard at the gate, eyeing each other warily.

"What brings you here all of a sudden!? Hurry up and leave!!"

The gatekeepers quickly realized that these newcomers, based on their attire and demeanor, were not from hostile organizations but rather members of official institutions.

This mansion was filled with illicit activities, so they couldn't allow government officials inside.

The gatekeepers desperately tried to send them away, but they noticed someone approaching on foot.

"Hey! Didn't you hear me!? I told you to leave!!"

As they reached out toward the approaching figure...

Their hand didn't reach its target; instead, it was grabbed by the individual.

"What is this hand?"

"Eek!"

The person, August, looked at the gatekeeper who had reached out with an icy, unfeeling gaze.

Shocked by the coldness in their eyes, the gatekeeper involuntarily let out a scream.

With that, they threw the trembling gatekeeper aside and proceeded to the gate of the lord's mansion.

"Hey!"

The gate was blown away by magic.

The iron gate, blown away with a deafening noise, left not only the gatekeeper but also the elite guards who had accompanied them in astonishment.

Only August, the one responsible for this spectacle, walked calmly into the estate.

"Let's go."

With just those words, August set off towards the lord's mansion.

The elite guards realized that they would only incur August's wrath if they offered any advice or suggestions and decided to stop attempting to dissuade him.

And that was the right decision.

When August reached the lord's mansion, they didn't open the main entrance door; instead, they blew it away.

Though there was no one on the other side of the door, the fact that they were acting so deliberately, even in their anger, and confirming that no one was inside, showed that they were angry but still composed. In addition, the guards realized that their earlier judgment was not mistaken.

In August's current state, it was too terrifying to offer criticism or advice.

After blowing the door away, August advanced into the lord's mansion.

Naturally, the hooligans who appeared were unable to approach August due to the physical barrier they had set up.

The elite guards simply followed August and repeatedly apprehended the hooligans who attempted to obstruct their mission with public disruption.

Up to this point, August hadn't said a word.

To the people in this place, August was just an invader.

However, no one could stop August from advancing.

A non-combatant maid who saw August from the front let out a scream and fainted. Her eyes rolled back in shock.

The elite guards following from behind couldn't hide their nervousness for the upcoming meeting with the parliamentarians, seeing how terrifying their expression was.

August, who had confirmed the layout of the mansion in advance, arrived at the office without getting lost and, once again, didn't knock on the door but kicked it down.

"What the!? What's going on!?"

Perhaps having heard the commotion so far, the parliamentarian inside the room was on guard, holding a sword.

However, they probably never expected someone to kick down the door like this. Their surprise was evident.

"...I am August. August von Arlsheid."

The moment August introduced themselves, the parliamentarian's expression changed.

Their face, which had been red with surprise and anger, turned pale in an instant.

This is bad; I need to come up with an explanation quickly, or my life is in danger.

That was the parliamentarian's judgment, so they decided to feign ignorance to the best of their ability.

"P-Prince of Arlsheid, what brings you to a place like this? Moreover, even if you are the Crown Prince of a major nation, it's unacceptable to enter another country's parliament without permission..."

As the parliamentarian uttered these words, August wordlessly handed over a document.

"This time, I am not here as a member of Arlsheid. I am here on behalf of the Ultimate Magicians, as a delegate with a specific request."

"Huh? A request?"

The parliamentarian was momentarily confused about what was being said but quickly remembered.

The Ultimate Magicians are a transnational organization.

They have the authority to go anywhere in the world if they have a request.

Considering that, the parliamentarian examined the document that had been presented.

And there, they were astonished by the content.

Darm's complete surrender, the abolition of the parliamentary system, the revival of the monarchy, the immediate governance by the Holy Kingdom of East, and so on.

The document was nothing less than an agreement that confiscated all the privileges the parliamentarian had enjoyed so far.

The parliamentarian was so angry at this that their hand holding the document trembled.

"I-Is this... Can something like this really be accepted? It's a forgery!! This document is a forgery!!"

In front of the parliamentarian shouting like this, another document was presented.

"What is this!? Another document!? What's going on...?"

While receiving the document with shouts, the parliamentarian's complexion turned ashen as soon as they read its contents.

The document listed numerous crimes that they had thought would never be discovered.

Among them, the most troubling was the charge of attempted assassination of the Crown Prince of Arlsheid.

The person standing before them was the Crown Prince himself.

Furthermore, he was the Vice Chief of the internationally renowned Ultimate Magicians.

This is bad; if I admit to this, I will definitely be killed.

Sensing this, the parliamentarian struggled to find a way to escape.

"W-What is this? I have no recollection of anything like this..."

"Unfortunately, all the evidence is in place. There's no way to talk your way out of it."

"W-What kind of evidence do you have? If you have any, please present it!"

The parliamentarian had survived in the criminal underworld.

People like that are extremely cautious and take care not to leave any incriminating evidence.

So, they confidently stated that there was no evidence.

But when August exhaled and looked at the parliamentarian with an expression as if they were looking at something filthy, they said, "I'll show you."

Saying this, August took out a recording device.

When they played it, the voices of the parliamentarian giving orders to their subordinates and the consent of those subordinates could be heard. Additionally, the subordinates were heard using threats against a certain business owner.

"W-What is this..."

"This is a recording device. It can record voices. It is recognized as having sufficient evidential capability in Arlsheid."

The parliamentarian tried to shout that something like this couldn't be used as evidence, but August silenced them with words before they could.

This is unavoidable now, but there should be no evidence for the most critical charge of the attempted assassination of the Crown Princess. If they could deny that, they might be able to get away with some prison time.

Thinking this, they decided to focus on this particular charge.

Unbeknownst to them, this would turn out to be a bad move.

"Well, then! What's the meaning of this 'attempted assassination of the Crown Princess'? To make such a serious accusation, you must have substantial evidence, right?"

The parliamentarian, who had boldly asserted this, was confident this time.

However, they soon regretted speaking those words. This was because a strong aura of oppression emanated from August.

It was visible magical energy, so intense that even a non-magical person could perceive it. The parliamentarian felt overwhelmed.

I shouldn't have said that! I've provoked his anger! That's what they thought, but it was already too late.

They thought they would be killed! However, to their surprise, August didn't lay a hand on them.

Instead, they took out two small items from their pocket.

"W-What is this...?"

"Can't you see? It's an ID card."

"I-I can see that, but... what's the point of showing it to me?"

The confused parliamentarian asked timidly why they were showing an ID card. August, with narrowed eyes, began to explain.

"This ID card contains information about when and where it was issued."

"...Huh?"

The parliamentarian couldn't immediately respond to August's words.

"Don't know? I didn't either, to be honest. But Shin discovered it... Well, at the time, I didn't think much of it."

Saying this, August fluttered the ID card in front of the parliamentarian.

"This ID card was in the possession of the thief who caused a commotion at the royal castle the other day. And..."

With that, the parliamentarian finally realized how grave the situation was.

"Oh! No..."

"This ID card states that it was issued in this city three years ago."

"Uh... Uh..."

"The government manages ID cards. In the city, the lord is responsible for that. Unauthorized issuance is not allowed. Yet, this one claims it was issued here three years ago. Isn't that strange? The person who had it is said to be twenty-three years old. Shin wouldn't be that old, and do you think it's possible for someone to not have an ID card until that age?"

"..."

"Meaning, this ID card can only be issued by the authority of the lord. The thief had it. It can only mean that you issued it. Do you need more evidence?"

The parliamentarian, cornered by August, could no longer argue.

"Ugh...!"

Driven to desperation, the parliamentarian attempted to attack August, but such an attempt could never reach them. When they received a shock stronger than expected, the parliamentarian fell to the ground without a fight.

"...Phew."

Looking at the fallen parliamentarian, August sighed and then called over the elite guards who had been in the background the whole time.

"I'm sorry, but please apprehend them."

Saying this, August left the lord's mansion and took a deep breath outside.

"With this... it's finally over."

It was the moment when the incident involving the attack on Crown Princess Elizabeth, which had been ongoing for four years, came to a true conclusion. superconductors
