trip
to explore the Madagascar wildlife on a budget

At the end of the year, it was quite hectic. We celebrated our joint birthday with Maria as usual, and Chris had a baby. Before we knew it, the year had passed.

By the way, Chris had a baby boy who looks just like her.

After the baby was born, there was a quick dispute between Zeke and Chris about whether to teach the child magic or swordsmanship.

...Why not teach both?

Well, that aside, when the year began, Sicily was already eight months pregnant.

Her belly had become perfectly round, and moving around seemed quite difficult.

Silver, fascinated by the fact that Mama's belly was getting bigger and bigger, often touched her belly. When the baby in her belly kicked, he would startle and remove his hand.

"Mama! The baby moved!"

Silver repeated this every time the baby in her belly moved, so he already understood that he would become a big brother.

"Hehe, Silver, you're such a lively child. When the baby is born, make sure to play with them a lot, big brother."

Every time she said that, Silver's eyes would light up, and he would nod vigorously.

Just with this, you could tell that Silver was a good child. He didn't feel jealous of the baby in his mother's belly and looked forward to the day he would become a big brother.

And if Sicily's belly was getting bigger, that meant the same was true for Olivia and Ellie.

"Good morning, Sicily!"

"Ugh... my belly feels heavy..."

Pregnant women gathering at our house. Olivia seemed energetic, but Ellie looked reluctant to move.

"What's the matter, Ellie?"

"Unlike you all, I'm genuinely just an ordinary person, you know!? If anything, I have less stamina than an average person!"

"Well, you don't have to say it so loudly..."

"I'll say it, and please fully understand."

As they were nearing the end of their pregnancies, they could stay home quietly, but they said they would get bored being alone, so the two of them came to our house every day.

Sicily, being close to her due date, was also on maternity leave from her job as an Ultimate Magician.

Well, it's maternity leave.

"Welcome, Ellie, Olivia."

Sicily, with a cheerful smile, welcomed the two of them and spent time in the living room along with Silver.

In front of them were two people with big bellies, just like Sicily, who was the mom. Lately, Silver was looking forward to becoming the older brother of Sicily's baby.

And then, something like this happened. When I was busy with the activities of the Ultimate Magicians, Silver saw Olivia and Ellie, both heavily pregnant, and tilted his head.

"Sisters have babies?"

While stroking the bellies of the two, Silver asked, and Olivia and Ellie both nodded in agreement.

"Yes, that's right."

"Yes. Just like your mother, I'll be having a baby too."

"Oh..."

Silver seemed to be very convinced by their words. After gazing at their bellies for a while, he suddenly said this.

"So, this baby is my little brother!"

"Huh?"

At first, they didn't understand what he was saying, but Silver went over to Sicily and, while stroking her belly, said, "I'm this baby's older brother!" Then, he pointed at the bellies of the two and said, "This baby is my little brother!"

After hearing this, the three of them, especially Olivia and Ellie, were deeply moved. Soon, Silver would become the older brother of the three children.

Realizing that, he suddenly became more responsible, starting from that day. He helped Sicily, grandpa, and grandma, and offered to help Marika-san and others.

His behavior truly embodied the role of an older brother, and it brought tears to the eyes of everyone in the family.

He's such a good child...

With all these events happening, time passed, and it was February. The month of childbirth was approaching.

All three of them were in a condition where they could give birth at any time, so a female doctor was always nearby. Ellie, being the Crown Princess, naturally had several female doctors stationed at the royal palace.

In our relatively large house, we also had female doctors at home, but Olivia's place didn't have enough space to accommodate the doctors, so they had to be on standby elsewhere.

So, Olivia was actually staying at the Walford residence.

We had extra guest rooms, so it wasn't a problem.

While eagerly waiting for the upcoming events, something unexpected happened.

Out of nowhere, my radio communication device started beeping.

Since Sicily was on maternity leave, I thought it might be a request from the clinic. Answering the radio, I realized it was different.

"Shin! Where are you right now?"

"Huh? Grandma?"

The voice on the other end of the radio was my grandma's. It was rare for her to call me while I was on a request, but I quickly understood the reason.

"Wait, seriously? Has the baby been born?"

"Contractions just started! It'll still take some time, but finish your request quickly and come home as soon as possible!"

"Oh, okay, got it!"

Contractions... Ah, it's finally happening.

Childbirth in this world is actually not as dangerous as it used to be in the past world. In fact, it might be safer than in the previous world because of healing magic. With magic used during childbirth, accidents are less likely to occur, and the mortality rate during childbirth is very low. However, that doesn't mean there is no risk at all.

I need to get back home quickly!

Thinking so, I hurried to complete the request as fast as possible. I declined the invitation for a meal from the client and rushed back to the office. When I returned earlier than usual, I was asked what happened. I explained that Sicily had gone into labor and I returned immediately. The office staff got excited and Kartas said, "I'll clear your schedule for tomorrow and the day after, so stay with Sicily at home," granting me an unexpected two-day break. Despite the emergency, being able to respond so quickly... Kartas is indeed capable.

By the way, I haven't heard about progress with Maria since that incident. I'm curious, but it's not the time for that. I connected the gate to my home and went through it. The home on the other side of the gate was surprisingly quiet.

"Huh? Where's Sicily?"

I muttered inadvertently, and Marika, who was waiting for me, called out to me.

"Welcome back, Master. Madam is currently giving birth in the bedroom. Lady doctors and midwives, as well as the Grand Lady, are in the room. Please wait outside the room."

"Oh, okay."

Following these instructions, I headed towards the bedroom. Outside the room, Grandpa had placed a chair and was sitting on it.

"Grandpa."

"Hmm, oh, Shin. Welcome back."

"I'm back. So, what's the situation now?"

"She went into labor quite a while ago. She entered the room immediately... Sigh."

Grandpa said that and let out a deep sigh.

"Attending childbirth for the second time, but it never gets any easier."

"True... Hey, Grandpa, is there anything I can do?"

"What can you do, Shin?"

While having such a conversation with Grandpa, it happened.

"Aaaahhh!!!"

I heard Sicily's scream, which I had never heard before. The moment I heard that voice, I reflexively reached for the doorknob of the bedroom.

"Don't come in!!"

Right then, Grandma's sharp reprimanding voice reached me.

"Shin, listen up. This is a battlefield for women! Right now, Sicily is risking her life to bring a new life into this world. The only thing you can do is to offer encouragement. It's better if we have at least one healer here."

"But... I can use healing magic too!"

"I know! But understand. Women don't want to be seen like this by the men they love."

With those words, I let go of the doorknob.

At that moment...

"Shin-kun..."

"Sh-Sicily!?"

"Welcome back, Shin-kun."

"I'm back, Sicily."

"What about Silver? How is he doing?"

Her voice startled me. I hadn't seen Silver since I returned. I turned to Grandpa, who was behind me, and he explained, "He's resting in a separate room. I activated the soundproof magical device you made, so don't worry."

"He's a good boy, sleeping peacefully. So, don't worry about him."

"Yessssss!!!"

"!!"

Again, I heard Sicily's scream, and I unconsciously clenched my fist. Feeling helpless, I stumbled backward and sat heavily in the chair that had been prepared next to Grandpa.

Seeing me like that, Grandpa patted my head like he used to when I was a child.

"Shin, it's his first experience, so it's understandable to be surprised... Inside the room, there are skilled lady doctors, experienced midwives, and our grandmother. There's nothing to worry about. Keep yourself composed."

"Grandpa..."

"Who are you calling a grandmother? You old coot!!"

An unusually dependable Grandpa was about to receive my gratitude when suddenly, we heard Grandma's angry voice from inside the room.

"...!"

Did she actually hear those small words from outside the room? How composed is Grandma, really?

Seeing that everything seemed fine, both Grandpa and I exchanged smiles.

And so, how much time had passed? Although it felt like a very long time, it was still early evening outside, so not much time had passed.

At that moment, the living room became noisy.

"Shin! How is she?"

"Is Sicily okay!?"

The first to rush upstairs and reach the bedroom were Aug and Maria.

"Not yet. Grandma says she's okay, but we can't see inside..."

Just then, a high-pitched cry suddenly echoed from inside the room. It was a lively, loud cry that resonated throughout the entire house.

The moment I heard that cry, I couldn't help but slump to the ground in a mix of emotions. I stared blankly at the door, and it slowly opened.

"My, my, what a pathetic sight you're making."

"Grandma..."

"You've become the father of two children now. Stand up properly!"

Grandma's voice propelled me to my feet, and I immediately entered the room. There, I found a tired but conscious Sicily.

"Shin-kun..."

"Sicily..."

Seeing her like that, I couldn't help but shed tears. She had gone through childbirth with such determination, putting her life on the line. When I thought about that, I was overwhelmed with affection.

"Sicily, thank you... Well done."

I said that and gently touched our foreheads together, and tears welled up in Sicily's eyes.

"Yes. I did my best."

We gazed at each other for a while, shared a light kiss, and then separated.

At that moment, we noticed someone approaching us.

"Congratulations. It's a healthy baby girl."

Approaching us was the midwife, cradling a tiny newborn wrapped in swaddling clothes. The baby had black hair like mine, but it was hard to discern much about her facial features since she was just born and a bit wrinkled.

But... Ah, she's finally here. Our daughter, Silver's little sister. The baby was placed near Sicily's bedside.

"Hehe, this is my first time seeing her too. They took her away right after she was born."

"I see."

"Yes. Finally, we meet, my baby. Shin-kun's baby. Nice to meet you, Mom."

As Sicily spoke, tears welled up in her eyes once again.

Afterward, everyone who had gathered rushed to see the newborn, but we decided to let Silver be the first to see his little sister. He approached the baby cautiously, and when he reached out his hand, the baby grabbed his finger tightly.

"!!"

Silver was initially startled by this, but he quickly composed himself and gazed at his newborn sister.

"Silver, that's your sister. Be nice to her."

Upon hearing Sicily's words, Silver remained still for a moment, then nodded with determination.

"Yeah, I'm her big brother."

With a smile, Silver appeared very reliable in our eyes.

Our newborn daughter was named 'Charlotte' and affectionately called 'Charl.' She quickly became the darling of the Walford family.

Soon after, Olivia and Ellie also gave birth. Olivia had a baby boy with Mark's blonde hair and Olivia's brown eyes. Ellie, on the other hand, had a girl with light blonde hair resembling Ellie and a face like Aug's. Bean's workshop apparently made quite a fuss over the long-awaited heirs. They planned to start teaching them how to make things from a young age, almost like a gifted education program.

Ellie had a girl, even though the Arsheid Kingdom didn't follow male inheritance or firstborn inheritance.

So, it seems that both boys and girls have the right to inherit, and if the person in question doesn't desire it or is considered unfit, even a male firstborn cannot ascend to the throne. It's based on the idea that it doesn't matter whether it's a boy or a girl.

More importantly, Ellie's reputation has soared due to giving birth to a healthy and physically sound child.

Thus, new members joined the Walford family, the Bean family, and the royal family.

These three, born on almost the same day, will grow up as childhood friends. They have already achieved what I couldn't as a child. While I might feel a bit envious, I decided to support and guide them with kindness and firmness when necessary.

"Can you really scold our daughter when you're so lenient with Silver?"

"..."

I made a commitment to work towards that.

"Sigh, well, well."

Aug's expression, as he shrugged, was not his usual bewildered face but one filled with genuine delight.
