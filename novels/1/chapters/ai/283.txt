"In the midst of chaos lies the Republic of Daam.

In the prime minister's office, Hiiro Kartun, the first prime minister of the Republic of Daam, sat with his head in his hands.

Daily marches by the public, protesting amidst the turmoil.

Daily stone-throwing towards the former royal castle, now serving as a makeshift government office.

Riots erupting during unjust times, leading to looting from shops and other places.

Despite complaints pouring in from looted shops, the dissatisfaction of the public was on the verge of exploding, as the country failed to address the issues. A revolution could happen at any moment.

Additionally, Hiiro's health had been particularly poor lately.

Occasionally, unbearable pain would strike throughout his body.

Despite consulting doctors to determine the cause, no abnormalities were found in his body.

Hiiro insisted there must be something wrong, but no matter how many doctors examined him, the results remained the same.

'There's no physical abnormality. If there's still something abnormal, could it be related to magical power?'

This was the common diagnosis from all the physicians.

However, this was merely speculation, lacking confirmation.

And so, the doctors suggested unanimously,

'Why not seek treatment from Lord Shin Wolford, the representative of the Ultimate Magicians, or Lady Sisley Wolford, who is a saint?'

Hiiro absolutely did not want to do that.

Shin was a reincarnate like himself.

He was the only person in this vast world with whom Hiiro could truly communicate.

However, Hiiro genuinely despised Shin.

It wouldn't be an exaggeration to say he hated him.

Why did Hiiro harbor such emotions towards Shin?

The reason lay in Hiiro's upbringing.

The recollection of Hiiro's past life occurred when, as a child, he was subjected to violence from his intoxicated father, teetering on the brink of life and death.

Upon surviving without succumbing to death, he realized he had been reincarnated into another world.

While initially joyful about this revelation, the feeling quickly faded away.

Hiiro was born into a common family in Daam.

With meager earnings, his father would turn violent towards his mother and himself when intoxicated.

His mother always appeared timid, constantly gauging his father's mood."

"And yet, despite being reincarnated into a world with magic, I had no magical power.

Moreover, I couldn't check my status, and I had no skills.

Although civilization had developed to some extent, it was incomparable to my previous life.

Hiiro quickly fell into despair, thinking that it would have been better in the original world where he couldn't use magic.

However, the reality was that he was alive in this world.

Despite it being a crappy world, he didn't want to die.

He had to survive in this world.

Fortunately, there were magical creatures in this world.

And there was a profession called 'Hunter' that made a living by hunting these magical creatures.

Determined to become a Hunter, different from the typical template of a reincarnated adventurer, Hiiro started training with a sword.

In his previous life, he had never seen or touched a real sword, but in this world, they were commonplace even among commoners.

Feeling the thrill of it, Hiiro became engrossed in swordsmanship.

As he dedicated himself to swordsmanship, he received an invitation from his swordsmanship master to take the country's knight examination. Hiiro accepted the invitation, took the exam, and became a knight.

By that time, he had begun to think that this world wasn't so bad after all.

Several years after becoming a knight, news spread across the world that a demon appeared in the powerful Arusheid Kingdom, and it was defeated by the grandson of a sage and a wizard.

The name of the one who defeated it was Shin Wolford.

As time passed, various information about Shin started to circulate.

A genius in both magic and swordsmanship, talented in crafting magical tools. His magic and creations were extraordinary.

And to everyone's surprise, he had invented a communication device connecting various countries.

When Hiiro heard this, he became convinced.

Shin Wolford was a reincarnate.

The more he investigated, the more the gap between him and Shin became evident.

Shin was apparently an orphan, but the one who picked him up was a sage respected worldwide.

He had the aptitude for magic, and the sage himself had been guiding him.

He received guidance on crafting magical tools from the wizard.

He received sword instruction from a man known as the Sword Saint.

Because the sage and the Arusheid king had a master-disciple relationship, Shin had been in contact with the king since his childhood.

Through that connection, he became friends with the Arusheid crown prince."

"Later, he fell in love with a beautiful girl who would later be called a saint, and they became engaged.

And so on... Shin's life could be described as the template for reincarnation into another world.

In comparison, how was Hiiro's life?

His parents were alive, but his father, who became violent when drunk, his unreliable mother, a poor family, and on top of that, he had no aptitude for magic.

Why?

Even though they were both reincarnates, why was their situation so different?

Hiiro wanted to be in Shin's position.

At first, it was just jealousy.

However, Shin, unaware of Hiiro's feelings, continued to accumulate achievements.

With each achievement, society raised its evaluation of Shin.

Jealousy gradually turned into hatred.

What was the difference between himself and Shin?

He seriously pondered this question.

The conclusion he arrived at was that the only difference was whether or not one could use magic.

Desiring to somehow become able to use magic, Hiiro began researching about magic.

Finally, he found the difference between those who could use magic and those who couldn't, and concluded that if the basic magical power level was insufficient, it could be increased.

Then, Hiiro became able to use magic.

From that point on, Hiiro steadily rose through the ranks.

Indeed, he became convinced that the only thing that had separated him and Shin was magic.

When he actually met Shin, what he felt was that Shin was just a younger kid.

The starting point of being able to use magic was different, but he believed he could catch up eventually.

However, merely catching up with Shin was not enough.

What should he do?

At that moment, an unexpected chance rolled in.

The man who newly ascended to the throne of Daam turned out to be an extremely ambitious individual.

Once this turmoil subsided, he would eventually bare his fangs to the world.

Convinced of this, Hiiro secretly devised a plan to bring about the king's downfall and subtly encouraged the king in that direction.

The king, who danced to Hiiro's tune with amusing precision, rebelled against the world as soon as the turmoil came to an end.

Waiting for this moment and ready, Hiiro immediately turned against the king."

"As a result, the trust in the royal family plummeted, and Hiiro was able to become the new head of state.

That was Hiiro's peak.

At that time, Shin, despite being hailed as a hero, was still a student.

However, Hiiro became the most powerful head of state in the country.

'I've won,' Hiiro thought, but...

Looking at the current situation, Hiiro wondered.

How did it come to this?

What went wrong?

He had ousted the thoughtless royalty, regained the world's trust, but the current populace hated him.

When he went out, he was surrounded by mobs with his guards, making it impossible to even go outside.

His subordinates, the members of parliament, didn't listen to him at all.

Why... why...

It was during this endless loop of thought that a knock came on the office door.

Is it another complaint from the citizens? Or perhaps, is the revolution finally happening? Thinking such things, he gave permission to enter.

"Excuse me, Prime Minister. There is a visitor for you."

"A visitor? Was that in my schedule?"

He was, after all, the national leader of Daam. A visit from someone like that was not something that happened casually.

The fact that he didn't know about it meant that the secretary in front of him had kept silent.

Although anger flared up at the thought of even this person treating him like a fool, it subsided with the next words.

"No, there was no appointment. They came suddenly just now."

"What? Then why did you let them in here?"

While Hiiro temporarily suppressed his anger, he felt a renewed sense of anger towards the secretary who had brought an uninvited guest to the Prime Minister's office.

But...

"I'm sorry, but we cannot refuse that person's visit..."

"That person?"

According to the secretary, it seemed like an unrefusable guest. Hiiro, who had no idea who this guest could be, felt more bewildered than angry.

At that moment...

"Excuse me, may I enter soon?"

With those words, an elderly man dressed in luxurious white attire appeared.

"Oh, sorry for keeping you waiting! Please, come in!"

Without waiting for the Prime Minister's approval, the secretary ushered the guest into the office."

"Moreover, he bowed his head so low that the back of his head was visible.

Who is this?

For whom would this secretary go to such lengths to show respect?

As Hiiro pondered this, the elderly man entered the room.

Following him, a woman dressed in even more luxurious white attire—liturgical clothing—entered.

When he saw their figures, Hiiro gasped.

He recognized that figure.

Here in Daam, she originally commanded more respect and had more influence than the king.

Despite having memories from a past life and being less interested in this world's affairs than its inhabitants, she was an unavoidable presence for anyone living in Daam.

Pope Ekaterina of the Church of the Creator, the very person, had entered the prime minister's office.

"Sorry for the sudden visit, Prime Minister Kartun."

"N-no, it's... your words are too kind."

With such a greeting, Ekaterina entered.

It was as casual as dropping by a friend's house unannounced.

Normally, since the Prime Minister of Daam was a head of state, he would be on equal footing with Ekaterina, who was the head of state of East.

However, Ekaterina deliberately maintained this attitude.

To make it clear that she was above and the other was below.

As she had intended, Hiiro, despite being aware of Ekaterina's top-down approach, took an attitude expected of someone subordinate.

Moreover, he was unaware of it.

"T-today, for what purpose did you..."

As Ekaterina entered suddenly, the fault lay with her, but the evidence was in the fact that she maintained her condescending attitude.

Asked by Hiiro, Ekaterina narrowed her eyes.

Just that made both Hiiro and the secretary freeze.

"What purpose, hmm... I suppose you have some idea, don't you?"

Hiiro was disturbed by Ekaterina's words.

There was only one thing that came to mind.

Ekaterina... or rather, East, did not approve of the current situation in Daam.

Hiiro understood from Ekaterina's words that she did not acknowledge his failure in governance.

Hiiro feared that a revolution by the citizens might occur if things continued as they were.

However, he had not anticipated East taking action, and the Pope personally visiting."

"What to do? What will happen? Hiiro felt as if Ekaterina held the power of life and death over him as the prime minister, and he thought so.

The secretary, who was watching this unfold, secretly rejoiced that Hiiro seemed to be falling faster than expected. If Hiiro fell, the next prime minister would be him. That's what he thought.

However, the words that came out of Ekaterina's mouth were unexpected for both Hiiro and the secretary.

"The current situation in Daam is too much to bear. You may have attempted a new form of governance, but it's clear that it has failed."

Hiiro was bewildered.

It wasn't a statement questioning his qualities as prime minister. On the contrary, it was a statement about the current state of Daam itself.

No way... no way...

"If we simply change the prime minister without changing the political system itself, nothing will change. Therefore, we will revert Daam's political system to its original monarchy. The nobles who were stripped of their titles will regain their positions. To avoid the confusion that comes with another change in the political system, the Holy Kingdom of East will intervene in politics for a while. This is the consensus not only of East but also of all the surrounding countries. Do you understand?"

It wasn't a proposal but an announcement of a decision.

Moreover, it was not only East's decision but also the consensus of all the surrounding countries.

The elderly man who stood by Ekaterina's side—a cardinal—presented the agreement document, and Hiiro turned pale upon seeing it.

However, the secretary couldn't accept this.

"No! This is too arbitrary! First of all, Daam is a sovereign state! There's no recollection of being intervened by other countries!!"

For a sovereign state, political intervention by other nations is an absolutely unacceptable act.

Allowing it would be no different from colonization.

Although the secretary vehemently spoke out against it, Ekaterina and the others from East wore indifferent expressions.

"I see. However, can you say the same after seeing this?"

Ekaterina said so and instructed the cardinal to show another document.

When the document was submitted, Hiiro, who remained motionless in shock, received it when the secretary took it, and his eyes widened upon reading its contents."

"This is evidence of the crimes committed by those who became lawmakers with the democratization of Daam. Some may be sincerely working, but... isn't that a minority? It seems a bit too heartless, doesn't it?"

Ekaterina's words went unheard by the busy secretary, who was examining the documents.

"If this were only a matter within Daam, we wouldn't have intervened. However, the damage extends to other countries. It's no longer wise for any country to leave Daam unattended. Do you understand?"

Many of Daam's lawmakers have connections to the underworld or are individuals from the underworld itself. What used to operate covertly under the shadow of national power has now gained the ability to act openly. As a result, individuals from the underworld, now in positions of power, have extended their influence beyond their borders without considering international repercussions.

The surrounding countries concluded that leaving Daam unchecked posed a danger, especially considering the furious reaction from Arusheid, which had twice faced attempts on the life of its Crown Princess. After capturing the infiltrators into Arusheid's royal castle, Augustus had delayed his direct intervention into Daam to make the necessary preparations.

As expected, Ekaterina and the kings of the surrounding countries, including Augustus, agreed to this course of action. This led to Ekaterina's emergency visit.

Even when confronted with this reality, the secretary couldn't give up.

"H-However! This... such a thing can't be accepted! You have no right to interfere in our country!"

It was a natural assertion for a sovereign state. However, the situation had already surpassed such stages.

"Is that so? Does that mean you wish for war with the surrounding countries?"

Both the secretary and Hiiro, who had been bewildered until now, were shocked by those words.

"War!?"

"W-What are you talking about!?"

They thought it was an unreasonable demand, and to reject it, they were threatened with war. It was an utterly absurd situation, and Hiiro and the others vehemently protested.

However...

"If you dislike that, then agree to relinquish your sovereignty. This is actually a favor. Some among the surrounding countries argue that we should invade immediately."

The foremost advocate for such action was King Deceum of Arusheid. Having faced two attempts on the life of the Crown Princess, his anger was considerable.

Explaining somehow to calm the situation, both finally accepted Ekaterina's words. When Ekaterina mentioned that it was good they didn't resort to more forceful measures, Hiiro and the secretary felt a chill down their spines. The reason was clear: Ekaterina's eyes hinted that she had actually desired to invade Daam and reduce it to ashes.

Thus, Daam's sovereignty temporarily fell into the hands of East. Hiiro, who had slipped from the position of Prime Minister in an instant, seemed to age several years within these few minutes. He started muttering, "Why... how..."

Ekaterina, who had been looking at Hiiro with pity, suddenly shifted her gaze.

"What should we do? Shall we talk to him?"

It was not the authoritative attitude she had before, but rather a way of speaking to someone close. Hiiro, curious about whom the informal conversation partner of the Pope of the Creation God Religion could be, looked behind Ekaterina.

There he saw the person he despised the most in this world: Shin Wolford.

Has this guy even managed to win over the Pope of the Creation God Religion? Was this whole sovereignty change orchestrated by him? Hiiro misunderstood, thinking this way.

"Uh, long time no see, Hiiro-san. I'm Shin Wolford."

Shin spoke casually, and Hiiro felt like he could lose his temper due to anger.

"Um, there's something I really want to ask Hiiro-san... Is it okay?"

"What is it?"

Angry as he was, Ekaterina was present, and Hiiro somehow restrained his rising fury. Still, he responded in a voice that didn't sound friendly.

At that moment, Shin, realizing that Hiiro was angry, decided to ask the question he had been pondering for a while.

"Why did you decide to democratize so quickly? Hiiro-san, you're a hero in the Daam of the Demon King War, right? I thought it might have been better to take more time and do it more skillfully..."

The young man in front of him, who seemed like the protagonist of an isekai cheat story who had never faced any hardships, dared to speak with such a know-it-all attitude.

Unable to bear it any longer, Hiiro finally exploded in anger.

"What the hell do you understand?! You've got it easy, don't you?! You probably received some cheat from God, right!? What complaints do I have, who didn't receive anything?! I had no choice but to become Prime Minister to beat you, the one who didn't receive any cheats! That was the only chance I had!!"

Hiiro, who was extremely enraged, unintentionally shouted in Japanese, partly because Shin, the one in front of him, was a reincarnated individual.

Upon hearing this, Ekaterina and the others looked bewildered, but Shin widened his eyes significantly.

"...I'm sorry. Could everyone except for Ogh please leave the room?"

Shin, aware that he was a reincarnated individual and accompanied by August this time, requested that everyone else leave.

Naturally, Ekaterina tilted her head.

"Your Highness? Why?"

"That's... sorry, I'll talk about it later at home."

"I see... understood. Well then, you too, go."

Ekaterina also spoke to the dumbfounded secretary and left the room.

Confirming that the door was closed, Shin spoke to Hiiro.

"Hiiro-san... were you a reincarnated individual?"

This statement was evidence that Hiiro was unaware of Shin. Despite being so conscious of, jealous of, and hateful towards Shin, he wasn't even in Shin's field of vision.

"Shin, could it be..."

Although August couldn't understand Shin and Hiiro's conversation, he had a general idea from the situation.

"Oh, Hiiro-san is also a reincarnated individual."

"...I see."

With Shin's words, August seemed to understand various things.

"Hiiro-san, I'm sorry, but Ogh doesn't understand Japanese, so I'll speak in this language."

"Huh! Trying to show off your friendship with the crown prince of a great nation!? You cheater, acting all high and mighty without any cheats!"

Annoyed by those words, Shin unintentionally retorted to Hiiro.

"I haven't received any cheats."

"Don't lie, you bastard! Without receiving cheats from God, you wouldn't have become the strongest, married a beautiful wife, and even become friends with the crown prince of a great nation! It's all thanks to cheats!!"

Hiiro, in his anger, shouted with bloodshot eyes, spraying saliva.

Realizing the misunderstanding, Shin, who was quite irritated by it, started explaining.

"It's true. I haven't met God, and I haven't received any cheats. Of course, I can't see my status, and I don't have any skills. The only cheat is the connections of my grandpa and grandma."

"Oh!? Are you spouting such lies now!?"

"It's not a lie. So, Hiiro-san, can you see your status?"

"...I can't."

"Exactly. There's nothing like that. All my power is the result of my own efforts. I haven't received any power from anyone."

Shin explained that Hiiro's notion of cheats was a misunderstanding, but Hiiro was not convinced by such words.

"Even if our circumstances are different!! How privileged do you think you are?! And how much do you think I've suffered?! We're both reincarnated individuals, so why is our situation so different!? It's absurd!!"

"There's nothing absurd."

Hiiro's enraged words were promptly dismissed by August.

"Huh? What are you talking about, Prince? Of course, a privileged prince like you wouldn't understand!"

Despite the incredibly disrespectful attitude towards the crown prince of another country, Hiiro, who had lost his position as prime minister and had his established political system completely denied, had reached a point where he didn't care anymore and also lashed out at August.

However, August calmly responded without changing his expression.

"Certainly, I was born as royalty. I grew up in a privileged environment; that's undeniable. However, do you think I didn't make any effort?"

"Huh? How should I know about that!"

In response to Hiiro's words, August shrugged as if to say, "Oh, well."

"You criticize without knowing?"

"...!"

Certainly, that was true, and Hiiro couldn't refute it.

"What was the point of all this... Oh yes, it was about different circumstances. That's obvious, isn't it? Some are born as royalty like me, others into noble families. The majority are born as commoners, and among them, some are born into wealthy families, others into poor ones, some in families where they are loved, and others where they are not. There are even children who don't have parents. In the world, true equality doesn't exist."

Hiiro, once again, couldn't argue against August's statement.

"I don't know, and I'm not interested in how you were raised. What's important is how you make efforts in your circumstances. I, for one, have the pride of studying multiple times more than others to become king. What about you?"

When asked like that, Hiiro, feeling pressured by August, responded.

"Oh, even I did my best, you know! I've been practicing swordsmanship since I was a child! That's how I became a knight! I've put in the effort!"

"Well, then, isn't that good enough? Why do you need to be jealous of Shin, who had different circumstances?"

"It's a reincarnation into another world, damn it! I wanted to try using magic too! But I don't have the talent for it, while that guy over there has an overflowing talent for magic! It's unfair, isn't it?! It's enviable, isn't it?! There's no way not to be jealous!!"

With Hiiro's words, Shin and August were taken aback.

Hiiro had heard that Shin had risen to the top of the military using both swordsmanship and magic.

'Sword and Magic.'

"Hey, you couldn't use magic!?"

When August expressed his surprise and asked, Hiiro smirked.

"Yeah, that's right. But I devised a way for someone who couldn't use magic to use it! A method you guys don't know! I surpassed you guys!!"

As Hiiro shouted, his magical power became increasingly unstable.

"What have you done, Hiiro-san!? That was something you should never have done!"

"Jealous? Jealous of me who knows a method you don't know?"

Seeing Hiiro grinning at the flustered Shin, they were shocked by his next words.

"You drank magic stone powder, didn't you!? That was something you should never have done! We know the consequences of those who did that!"

Shin knew a method that only he should have known.

Just when he thought he could finally defeat Shin, Shin already knew about it.

In light of this fact, Hiiro's hatred grew even stronger.

"Ahh, detestable... Why not me? I hate you! Hate, hate, hate, hate!!!"

With each scream, the distorted magic power turned black.

With every increase in Hiiro's anger and hatred, the magic power visibly darkened.

Seeing this, Shin and August understood everything.

"Anger... hatred transforms magic power."

"No wonder... humans who become demons, spreading anger and hatred around them. That is the cause of demonization."

Shin and August discussed this as they watched the scene before them.

Finally, it happened right before their eyes.

Hiiro's demonization.
