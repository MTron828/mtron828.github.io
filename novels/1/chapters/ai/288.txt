Two attempted assassinations of Princess Consort Elizabeth.

As a result, there was forced intervention from various countries in Dam, leading to a change in the political structure once again.

Adults were scrambling to adapt to these significant changes, but there were those who had nothing to do with all of this.

Children.

The parents of the children attending the Royal Earlsheid Primary School in Earlsheid were mostly nobles. Some were wealthy from running businesses, and they were all busy dealing with the current chaos in Dam. However, this was a matter that didn't concern the children.

"Silver-kun."

In the classroom of the first-year class at the primary school, a girl called out to Sylvester, who had just entered the classroom.

Well, it was not just one girl but several girls.

"Good morning, everyone."

Sylvester greeted the girls one by one with a smile.

Sylvester had smooth silver hair, a well-proportioned face, and a slender figure. In addition to his excellent academic performance and athletic ability, he had a calm and gentle personality. His family was also 'that' Walford.

In other words, he was very popular among the girls.

The girls felt like they had just stepped out of a girls' novel, and Sylvester's smile left them breathless and weak in the knees.

The girls thought, "He's just like a prince."

In their age group, there was a princess but no prince. The current prince was Augustus, who was already married and had children, making him too old for romantic interest to these girls.

So, their prince was Sylvester, a commoner, but described as the 'hero of salvation,' 'demon lord,' or 'messenger of God' along with Sicily, who was called the 'saint,' and their son, who had exceptional looks.

However, describing Sylvester as a prince wouldn't be entirely incorrect, considering he was the son of Strom, who had the right to inherit the throne in the former empire.

In a different world, he might have been called the Crown Prince.

Nevertheless, this was a fact known to only a few people. Regardless of that, the girls saw Sylvester as their "prince."

Allen's mouth opened and closed in response to Sylvester's disrespectful comments.

While Allen maintained a casual attitude at the academy, he had received strict upbringing in loyalty and respect towards the royal family. Addressing members of the royal family with casual nicknames and terms like "aunt" was unthinkable for him.

Seeing Allen's reaction, Sylvester couldn't help but smile wryly.

"I thought the same way, so I asked, 'Should I call her "Her Highness the Consort"?' And she told me, 'Please stop. You can continue to call me "Aunt Ellie" as usual.'"

"Wow, really... That's the Walford family for you."

"Yeah, my dad's pretty amazing. He and Uncle Aug are best friends, so they didn't want their best friend's child to feel too formal."

The thought of calling the Crown Prince "uncle" crossed Allen's mind, but he decided not to delve into it any further. He reminded himself that this was the norm in the renowned Walford family.

"Oh, and there were other kids the same age as my sister who came over, so it was quite lively. So I wasn't bored."

"Who else came over?"

"Um, do you know the Bean Workshop?"

"Yeah, I know it. It's a huge workshop in Earlsheid, right?"

"That's right. There's this boy Max from there, and the son of one of my dad's old acquaintances named Rain."

"I see."

The Rain Sylvester mentioned was the son of Siegfried and Christina. He resembled Christina in looks and had a reserved personality.

"Sylvester's sister is three years old, right?"

"Yeah."

"There were a lot of kids her age... Must be a handful to watch over."

"Well, kind of. But they're all well-behaved kids, so it's not that tough."

"You're amazing, man."

"Really?"

"Yeah. I have younger relatives, but they're still too young for manners and stuff, so they make a lot of noise when they visit."

"Haha, I see."

"By the way, Sylvester's family has the Demon Lord, the Saint, the Sage, and the Priest too, right? That's pretty amazing."

Even kids of their age knew about the stories of the Sage and the Priest. They were figures greatly respected by the older generations, but the current generation was encouraged to read biographies and novels about these admirable individuals from a young age.

However, for the children of this generation, when they think of heroes, it's Sylvester Walford leading the Ultimate Magicians.

Allen never said it out loud, but he often thought, "Shin Walford, the Demon Lord, and Sicily, the Saint, as my parents... How lucky are they?"

Therefore, when Sylvester said the next words, it was somewhat unbelievable for Allen.

"If you'd like, would you come to my house next time?"

"Huh?"

"Oh, Allen, your family is from the marquess's house, right? So, you might have lessons and all. In that case, if it's inconvenient..."

"I'll go! I'll definitely go! I just need to let my parents know, but they'll definitely approve it! I can always change my plans for lessons!"

Seeing Allen's earnestness, Sylvester was slightly taken aback.

"R-really? Well, when you've decided on the schedule..."

"This weekend! I'll come this weekend during the break!"

"Uh, sure, got it. I'll let them know."

"Yeah!"

After Allen responded with a beaming smile, he muttered to himself, "Is this for real... Is it for real... I'm going to meet the Demon Lord and the Saint..."

Sylvester watched Allen with a wry smile, reaffirming that his parents were indeed remarkable.

As classes proceeded without issues, during the break, a girl from the same class approached Sylvester and Allen.

"Uh, Allen-sama..."

The girl who spoke during the break was a classmate named Cresta.

"What's up?"

Cresta was the daughter of the Manuel Marquess, and she was a childhood friend of Allen's. She appeared quite delicate, with light brown hair and matching-colored eyes.

Cresta approached Sylvester, who was chatting amicably with Allen, with a determined look on her face.

"Um, uh! Are you free this weekend!? If it's okay, would you come to my house!?"

With a bright red face, Cresta had a crush on her childhood friend, Allen. Both of their parents supported their relationship, and this time, it was Cresta's mother who proposed inviting Allen to their house.

So, Cresta extended the invitation to Allen...

"Huh? Uh..."

Allen had always readily accepted Cresta's invitations before. That was because when Cresta invited Allen, Allen's parents also helped clear his schedule. It should have been the case this time as well, but Allen looked uncomfortable and turned his face away.

"...Huh?"

Cresta couldn't have anticipated such a response, and she gazed at Allen in disbelief. She felt a sense of despair.

"Did, did I inconvenience you?"

Sulking and downcast, Cresta questioned, and Allen became flustered.

"No! Uh, it's not like that at all! It's just that I'm going to Silver's house this weekend, so it's not because I don't want to go with you!"

"Huh?"

Cresta uttered the same word again, but this time with entirely different emotions.

"Sylvester's house... Does that mean..."

"Uh, yeah. Sylvester suggested that I come over to his house. We just talked about it earlier."

"I see... I see..."

At this moment, Cresta's emotions were a mixture of dissatisfaction with Allen, who prioritized Sylvester over her, and envy of being invited to the renowned Walford family, a household known to everyone in the Earlsheid Kingdom, if not the entire world.

"So, um, there's no reason Cresta's invitation is inconvenient or anything, okay?"

Allen repeated his apologies, trying to make amends for the complex situation that had arisen. His intentions were evident, just by looking at how he was handling the situation. In short, both of them harbored feelings for each other.

Their mutual affection was blatantly obvious to everyone around them, including their parents and classmates who watched their relationship with lukewarm interest. The people around them were thinking, "Just get together already," but they were still just first-year students in the primary school, and they hadn't really started dating or anything of the sort yet.

Naturally, Sylvester, one of those quietly observing, was among those who wished them well.

"Come on! Opportunities like this don't come by often!"

"Right... you're correct."

"Do you understand!?"

"Yes... it's disappointing, but... I'll give up on this time..."

"Oh, then, Cresta-san, you have free time this weekend, right? If you want, you can come over to my house with Allen."

To Cresta, who was reluctantly resigning to giving up the meeting with Allen, a lifeline was suddenly extended. Furthermore, it was an invitation to the illustrious Walford family, which she had deeply envied just a moment ago.

"Is, is that really okay?"

Cresta looked at Sylvester with a shocked expression.

"Yeah, Cresta-san wanted to play with Allen, right? In that case, you can play together at my house. Oh, but, Cresta-san is the daughter of a Marquess, so it might not be appropriate for a commoner's house... 'That's not the case at all! I'm with Allen-sama! There's absolutely nothing inappropriate about it!'... Is that so?"

Cresta emphatically asserted her position, overlapping her words with Sylvester's. She was desperate.

"In that case, this weekend, both of you come to my house."

"Yeah!"

"Yes! I'm looking forward to it!"

And so, for the first time since enrolling in the primary school, Sylvester's friend was set to visit the Walford family's house.
