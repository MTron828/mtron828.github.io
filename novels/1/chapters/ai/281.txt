Accompanied by the maid who had come to report to us, we arrived at the room where Sicily was for childbirth, and our cheeks softened upon hearing the cries coming from inside.

We wanted to burst into the room immediately, but we held back and knocked on the door.

The door opened from the inside, and a female doctor in a white coat appeared.

"Oh, my lord and lady, please come in," the female doctor said, guiding us into the room.

Inside the room, maids were bustling around to take care of post-birth matters, so it was still quite busy.

Amidst all this, Sicily was lying on the bed, holding the baby.

"Shin-kun..."

Though she looked tired, the moment we saw Sicily's face, which was happier than anything else, relief and joy welled up.

"Good job. It was so sudden; I was surprised."

"Hehe, maybe this little one was surprised to come out too," Sicily said, glancing down at the baby she was holding.

The newborn baby had blue hair, just like Sicily. His eyes were still closed, so we didn't know their color. Since he was freshly born and his face was all wrinkled, it was hard to say which parent he resembled, but he was still adorable and precious.

I gently stroked the head of our child while he was in Sicily's arms, and he seemed to sense the touch as his mouth moved slightly.

Then, Shal leaned forward to get a glimpse of her newly born brother, and her eyes lit up as soon as she saw him.

"Wow! He's so cute!"

Shal's excitement at seeing her brother for the first time caused her to speak loudly. Startled by her big sister's voice, the baby started crying.

"Waaah! Aaah!"

Shal was at a loss as her brother suddenly started crying.

Sicily comforted the baby while speaking to Shal, "Shal, the baby got scared, so please speak softly."

Shal, aware that her voice had caused the crying, covered her mouth and nodded silently.

No, it's okay if you speak softly, you know?

It should be well-known that Sicily went into labor inside the castle, and the celebratory atmosphere in the room made it clear that she had given birth safely.

I'm grateful to Orto-san for taking the trouble to congratulate us, and as he received the deposition report, Aug started to move.

"Sorry for making you bring it all the way here, but let's review it in a different room. It wouldn't be right to disrupt this joyful atmosphere."

"Understood."

"Shin, you're going to read it too, right?"

"Yeah, of course."

And so, we left the room filled with happiness and entered a separate room.

"By the way, they used that magical tool for the interrogation, didn't they?"

"Yes, because it's a serious crime. There were no objections from anyone."

"Understood. Let me read it."

With that, Aug began reading the deposition report.

The mentioned magical tool was likely the truth-telling magical tool.

Aug stared at the content for a while, and his expression gradually became more serious.

As he continued reading the deposition report, Aug's expression turned puzzled.

Finally, after finishing reading it, he exhaled sharply and handed the report to me.

I glanced at the deposition report I was handed.

Since they used the truth-telling magical tool, all the information should be accurate. I read the contents accordingly.

There were two thieves, both 22 years old.

They were employed as civil servants and had a position that allowed them to freely enter and exit the royal castle.

When I read this, I couldn't have imagined that they would have entered the royal castle through legitimate means.

This was because the current royal castle had adopted a security system using the individual identification function of citizen cards.

Since the Ellie Attack Incident four years ago, the inspection of individuals entering and exiting the royal castle had become much stricter. If even the castle's personnel had gone through a rigorous screening, it would have created a situation where they would never be able to enter the castle.

In fact, such a situation had occurred.

As a result, they established a convenience gate that allowed smooth passage for people carrying citizen cards registered with the individual identification function.

This had eliminated the morning congestion at the castle gates.

The convenience gate could only be used by those who possessed a citizen card registered in their name.

So, they were completely under the radar.

As for their motive, it turned out to be resentment from failing the Ultimate Magicians' entrance exam three years ago.

For such a reason... My anger was about to make me tremble, but the crucial part was yet to come.

After failing the exam and causing problems within the magician guild they belonged to, they were dismissed. That's when a man approached them, asking if they wanted to take revenge on Earlsheid with the Ultimate Magicians. The thieves, who had resented the Ultimate Magicians for causing their life to take a turn for the worse, accepted the man's proposal. They took the civil servant exam for Earlsheid, passed, and that brings us to the present.

Here, I also noticed something odd.

If you were to work as a civil servant in Earlsheid's royal castle, your nationality should be Earlsheid. However, this thief had a history of causing problems within the magician guild and being dismissed. Would the highest institution of the country hire someone with such a track record?

With these questions in mind, I continued reading the deposition.

The thief claimed not to know the man's true identity. Furthermore, the information they wanted wasn't included.

"Aug, this..."

"You've noticed, haven't you?"

"Yeah. And the information we want isn't here."

"Understood. Should we go ask?"

"Right away."

"Okay."

Saying so, Aug opened the gate.

Since the royal castle is Aug's residence, he knows the layout of the security bureau's interrogation room. They normally wouldn't do something like this, but due to the urgency of the situation, we used the gate to move within the castle.

"So, Your Highness!?"

Because moving through the gate within the castle is not a common occurrence, the knights and security officers guarding the interrogation room were surprised by our sudden appearance.

"Is the suspect from the case here?"

"Yes, here he is!"

"I see. May we enter?"

"Of course!"

Saying this, the security officer opened the door to the interrogation room.

Inside the room, there was a man. He was of average build and height, but he appeared to have a strong physique for a civil servant. He was sitting in a chair with his hands bound behind his back, and a truth-telling magical tool was hanging around his neck.

The man stared us down as we entered and started cursing.

"Prince and hero, huh? My life's been a complete mess because of you guys! What are you going to do about it!?"

This was a statement made with the truth-telling magical tool, so he was speaking from his genuine feelings.

I couldn't help but wonder how someone could develop such thoughts.

Aug, seemingly used to these situations, remained calm and took a contemplative posture by pinching his chin with his hand.

"Hmm... you say it's our fault, but where exactly is it our fault?"

Without showing anger, Aug genuinely asked this question, which seemed to baffle the man. In response, the man got furious.

"Because you guys made me fail the damn exam, that's why all this happened! If there's any responsibility, it lies with you guys!"

Hearing these words, Aug tilted his head even more.

"Don't talk nonsense. So, are you saying that anyone who failed the Ultimate Magicians' entrance exam had their life turned upside down?"

"Yeah!? I don't know! It's not the same for everyone!"

"You must know. You said your life went to ruin because we made you fail the exam. In other words, does that mean everyone who failed the exam has had their life go to ruin? Is that not true?"

"I don't know about the others! I know that I became unhappy because you, the great me, made me fail!"

I don't know about this guy's life, but what he's saying is absurd.

Baffled by his selfish claims, Aug chuckled.

"You, excellent? You?"

Saying this as if he were mocking the man completely, the man's face turned even redder, and he attempted to voice his complaints.

However...

"Ah... ah..."

"As excellent as you? Stop being so conceited."

Aug enveloped himself with a large amount of magical power and intimidated the man.

Unable to resist this intimidation, the man started trembling violently.

"To be so terrified by this level of magical power. You had the nerve to call yourself excellent?"

Wow... this guy, Aug, completely shattered his spirit... I mean, it's broken.

Under Aug's magical power and words, the man was clearly belittled and trembling with a pale face.

"Hey, I have something to ask."

Taking over from Aug, who was still using magical intimidation, I decided to inquire about something I was curious about.

"Eh?"

Intimidated and teary-eyed, the man turned towards us. His previous arrogance was nowhere to be found.

This guy targeted Sicily and the children's lives. There's no room for sympathy.

"Where are you from?"

When I asked this, the security officer who was conducting the interrogation looked puzzled.

His expression was asking why we were asking such a question now.

However, both Aug and I had something we were particularly curious about.

"M-Maurice..."

"...?"

I've never heard that name before.

"What town is that in, and in which country?"

When I inquired once more, the man showed some initial resistance, but he couldn't resist the truth-eliciting magic tool and reluctantly revealed the name of the country.

"K... Kurt."

"Got it."

We got the information we needed. Now...

"His identification card?"

When I asked the security officer, he handed over the man's identification card, which they had seized after apprehending him.

With this, we had what we needed. Now we just needed to question the other person.

"Let's go, Aug."

"Yeah."

We conducted another interrogation and retrieved the identification card from the other person before returning to the original room. Ort, who had brought the statement report, was also present.

"But seriously, why do you need to know the home country and the identification card?"

Ort, who had listened to the previous interrogation, asked this question. However, before answering that question, I had something I wanted to ask as well.

"Ort, can you change your nationality easily?"

The thieves were aspiring civil servants in Earlshide, meaning they should have had Earlshide nationality. However, the thieves came from Kurt, which meant they had changed their nationality. So, when I asked this question, Ort nodded.

"Yes. It's not easy, but with the proper procedures and assessments, it is possible to change one's nationality."

"I see."

Now that I had the answer, I decided to respond to Ort's question. So, I picked up the confiscated identification card.

"Why the identification card? It won't activate without the person present..."

"Ort, the identification card only activates for viewing personal information, right?"

"Huh?"

"In other words, regarding all other information..."

As I said this, I passed my magical power through the identification card. During this process, I imagined the activation magic of the identification card floating up.

And then...

"W-What is this!?"

In front of us, letters began to appear.

This was the activation magic attached to the identification card.

From here on, we could not read the personal information of those men.

However, the analysis of the identification cards was quite complex, and as someone who was always interested in this kind of thing, I found something interesting in the information one day.

"Take a look here."

I pointed to the specific section, and Ort looked at it.

His expression displayed his puzzlement.

"Well... What is this?"

Ort couldn't read Japanese. This reaction was expected.

"Right here, it states where this identification card was issued."

"Huh!? Do identification cards have such information?"

"Yes."

The catalyst for this discovery was something minor. While I was fiddling with the identification card, Sicily was nearby and asked me to take a look at her identification card. As I examined it, I noticed a difference between hers and mine.

In the section where mine said 'Earlshide Capital,' Sicily's had 'Earlshide Claude.' I asked Sicily about it, and she explained that she was born in a territory, not the capital. Her identification card was registered there.

To confirm, I asked all the members of the Ultimate Magicians to show their identification cards. Aug and the commoners had 'Earlshide Capital,' while the nobles had 'Earlshide Territory Name.'

Well, it was a discovery, but at that time, I didn't think the location of identification card issuance was particularly important. However, it became crucial in this case.

Once again, I examined the registration issuance location on the identification cards the thieves had.

"I've finally got it."

I couldn't help but say that.

"What does it say?"

Aug asked me, and I told him the registration issuance location on the identification card.

'Darm Urst.'
