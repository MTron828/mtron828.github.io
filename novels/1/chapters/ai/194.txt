"I saw it, over there."

After floating for a while using levitation magic, Shaolin pointed forward and said.

Her face looked a bit downcast.

I guess Oug's words really weighed on her...

When we first started flying in the air, she looked like she was having fun, but after Oug brought up that topic, she clearly became more downcast.

It's a bit sad, but she had been hiding the information that Hao might have a powerful weapon.

It's understandable that her credibility would be affected.

But, why did she hide it in the first place?

...I wonder if it's because she was afraid that I would see the enchantment on Hao's weapon and try to replicate it?

But it was just a rumor, and I thought it didn't need to be mentioned until this situation happened.

So she decided to reveal the information now?

Certainly, if the ancient civilization's weapon enchantments are written in Chinese characters, it might be understandable if someone saw them.

But I promised not to create such weapons...

Well, we haven't known each other for long, and maybe we weren't trusted.

Oug also didn't seem to trust Shaolin.

Well, it's not easy to trust someone with unknown knowledge like mine.

...I'm getting a bit sad thinking about it.

In Oug's case, he's of royal blood, so it probably wasn't easy for him to trust people.

That's true... Huh?

"...What is it, Shin, why are you staring at people's faces?"

"Huh? Oh, no..."

Oug looked at me with suspicion, so I approached him and whispered.

"Oug, you still didn't trust Shaolin, did you?"

"Of course not."

"Is it because you've only recently met her?"

"That's part of it, but..."

"But when I first met you, didn't we quickly become friends?"

I said that, and Oug seemed to nod in agreement.

"I heard a lot about you from my father. It didn't feel like the first time we met. Plus, you're Marlin's grandson."

"Oh, I see."

"Strange. Even Sicily looks agitated. Maybe it's because she saw those people being devoured by the dragon earlier. She probably wants to confirm the dragon's situation as soon as possible. From her perspective, the gatekeeper's attitude just now might have seemed like an unconcerned response, as if he didn't understand the situation. In fact, Shaolin has visited this village before, and I trust her words. Maybe she went to confirm whether it's really okay to hunt dragons, even if it's true, because of that bill. But what about emergency situations? Would they still go to their superiors for confirmation in such cases? While pondering this, the gatekeeper from earlier returned with a man. Judging by his attire, it resembled the bureaucratic clothing I had seen in the Imperial Palace. Is he a permanent official in this village? I thought this, as I observed the man, and he said something to Shaolin. 'What!?' Shaolin exclaimed in surprise, and she protested something to the man who resembled an official. However, the man merely shook his head and completely ignored her. What's going on? 'Shaolin, what's happening?' 'W-well...,' Shaolin replied in a very uneasy tone when I asked. 'I told them that we need to thin out the dragons due to their excessive breeding, but they said it's not allowed...' 'What?' What is this? With that thought in mind, I looked at the man who resembled an official. His expression... clearly looked down upon us, and there was a mocking smile on his face. 'Shaolin, is this person an official?' 'Huh? Yes, he is. He's a resident official of this village.' '...Could he possibly be connected to Hao?' When I said that, Shaolin thought for a moment and replied, 'I can't be sure, but most likely...' Hmm, I see. Does that mean this guy is responsible for reporting when there are signs of a mass dragon occurrence? In other words, if there aren't individuals connected to Hao in each village, the communication network won't function."

So, they're thinking it's not good for anyone other than Hao to know that the number of dragons is increasing. Hence, they're refusing to authorize dragon hunting.

"Lord Shaolin, I apologize, but could you translate?" As I was pondering what to do, Oug stepped forward and asked Shaolin to translate.

When Oug is in charge of negotiations, it seems like we have no role to play. I quietly moved behind Oug.

Looking around, I noticed that everyone was watching Oug with expectant eyes.

"I am August von Arlsheid, the Crown Prince of the Arlsheid Kingdom beyond the Great Desert region to the west. And you are?"

When Shaolin translated, the official's eyes widened. It seemed like he was asking for an explanation, so Shaolin explained something, and he finally seemed to understand.

"I am the administrator of this village. So, what authority does a foreign Crown Prince have to be here?"

"Authority? No, we don't have any authority. We are here solely for humanitarian assistance."

Upon hearing Oug's words, the official laughed mockingly.

"Humanitarian assistance? This village has no need for such a thing."

"I see. But you know..."

"What is it?"

"Did you not ask the gatekeeper there about how we arrived in this village?"

"...Oh, I heard something about you flying here. It's a ridiculous tall tale."

"Unfortunately, it's the truth. Hey, Shin."

While Oug was talking to the official, he turned to face me.

Even though he didn't say anything, I interpreted it as a request to cast a levitation spell, so I did.

"What the...? Uwaaaahh!!!???"

Ah, I guess I didn't need translation for that one.

Anyway, since the official had witnessed it, I canceled the levitation spell.

"As you can see, it's a fact that we flew here."

The official, still in shock, hadn't quite recovered.

He needed to regain his composure quickly, or Oug's one-sided game would continue.

"So, on our way here, I observed the area from the sky..."

Oug paused there and let out a deep sigh.

"I witnessed a significant number of dragons heading towards this village."

"What...!?"

"And, in fact, before coming here, I visited another village..."

The official swallowed hard and listened intently to Oug's words.

Oh, I see...

"It was truly tragic... the remains of those devoured by the dragons... the cries of people being attacked heard from all around... it was like hell..."

Is that so? While we were puzzled by Oug's words, the official and the gatekeeper had pale faces.

They seem to believe it completely.

"When we arrived in this village and saw that it hadn't been attacked yet, I felt a deep sense of relief. Honestly, I was expecting to witness that hellish scene again."

Oug's speech continued.

"We can't let this village suffer the same fate as the other one. Will you cooperate with us?"

Upon hearing Oug's words, the official, who had previously had a different attitude, began to seriously consider it.

They were thoroughly threatened... although 90% of it was a lie.

And now, after giving it some thought, the official spoke up.

"Nevertheless, I cannot grant permission. There's a protection law in place concerning dragons. Breaking it lightly..."

Hmm, this is getting difficult.

Is Hao really that frightening?

Oug seemed to have sensed the official's thoughts and spoke a final, convincing word.

"Unfortunately, that law is expected to be repealed. Mr. Hao is said to be held responsible for proposing that law."

"What!? Mr. Hao!?"

Mr. Hao... so this person is indeed someone close to Hao.

"That's the situation. What will you do? Currently, the Imperial Court sees the mass dragon outbreak as a national crisis. Mr. Hao, who caused it, is considered a traitor. Which side do you think is more beneficial... you can figure that out, right?"

...There's a con artist among us.

While we watched Oug, who was expertly spinning his web of lies, with skeptical eyes from behind, the official was different.

He had the word of a foreign Crown Prince who was vouched for by Shaolin, who was familiar to the people of this village.

If the Crown Prince's words were to be believed without a doubt.

After much contemplation, the official finally spoke with a heavy heart.

"Very well... I'll grant permission."

Upon hearing those words, Oug couldn't help but smile.

"I see. You've made a wise decision. So, there's a favor I'd like to ask of you."

"A favor?"

"I see. We are going to hunt the dragons that have multiplied excessively. The area is quite extensive, and while we intend to be thorough, there's always a chance we might miss something. Could you position your troops around this village just in case?"

"I don't mind, but... is it alright? We won't be fighting."

"That's fine. We can fly, so it's more convenient for us alone."

"I see..."

Perhaps Oug intended to say that he wouldn't be a hindrance, but stating it directly could have caused tension. Therefore, he used the levitation magic demonstrated earlier as a reference to convince the official.

He's as crafty as ever.

"Then, let's head to thin out the dragons right away. Lord Shaolin, please take refuge in the village's fortress."

"Yes. I understand."

"Let's go."

After Oug said this, I cast the levitation spell once again, this time targeting everyone.

"Oh... Your Highness..."

Amidst this, Leafan, who still had a bitter expression, spoke to Oug.

"What's the matter?"

"I'm sorry, but I can't use magic without tools. Honestly, I think I'll only be a burden..."

Ah, I see. Leafan took Oug's words from earlier at face value.

"My apologies. What I said earlier was a ruse to convince that official. In reality, we will land and fight, so don't worry."

"Oh, I see..."

With the prospect of a ground battle, Leafan's tension eased slightly.

But still, it was quite a ruse.

"Earlier, you used that ruse quite a lot. Is it okay to tell such big lies?"

When I said this to Oug, he chuckled.

What's with that laugh? It's irritating, you know?

"I didn't tell any lies."

"No, no, you told nothing but lies!"

"They weren't lies. I haven't seen it myself, but I confirmed that there are a considerable number of strong magical reactions in this area."

"I did confirm that as well, but... what about the previous village?"

"That, too, was simply something we hadn't witnessed personally, but there's no doubt it was in that kind of situation."

"...What about Hao? He's not officially a traitor yet."

"Not 'yet.' It will happen very soon."

...I'm lost for words.

It's all based on predictions and assumptions.

But, when you think about it, it seems plausible.

This guy is really...

"Rather than that, we've wasted enough time on unnecessary matters. Let's thin out the dragons in this habitat quickly and head to the next village."

"Oh, I see. Understood."

"I'll tell everyone. We're only targeting carnivorous dragons. Avoid hunting herbivorous ones as much as possible. Also, don't exterminate them, okay? If all the carnivorous dragons disappear completely, that would be troublesome."

It's all about the food chain. When herbivorous dragons multiply excessively, it can lead to the depletion of forests and grasslands.

"Do you all understand? Alright... spread out!"

With Oug's signal, everyone rushed toward the dragons. Amidst the commotion, I...

"Leafan, I'll guide you to the location with the dragons' magical presence, so please follow me."

"Oh, I see."

I decided to accompany Leafan, who couldn't use detection magic. Well then, I'll be on my way too.
