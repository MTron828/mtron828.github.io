nd a dish
to impress a date who's a picky eater

The text you provided appears to be in Japanese. Here is the English translation:

"At Julius's hometown, Rittenheim Resort, everyone is having a barbecue for dinner on the first day.

Since appearing too serious would only make everyone uneasy, Oug and I returned to the group with a nonchalant attitude and joined everyone for dinner.

Just as the dinner was about to end, Uncle Dis made an announcement.

"Oh, I almost forgot. Ultimate Magicians, listen up."

"What's going on, Uncle Dis?"

"What is it, Father?"

"Yes, you've saved other countries from demons twice so far. And I've heard that you've defeated a considerable number of demons during those times."

"That's correct."

"So, here's the thing. It was decided today that your achievements are too significant, so a new medal will be created and awarded to you."

Ah, now I remember, there was talk about that.

I was too preoccupied with the demons' activities to pay much attention.

"My child getting a medal!?"

"That's amazing!"

"Truly... they've become quite distinguished... I was worried about how to straighten them out when they started saying they wanted to go to the Magic Academy..."

Among the genuinely delighted parents, Tony's mother was the only one with a different opinion.

Straighten them out... could that be in the physical sense?

"By the way... I completely forgot."

"You had more important things to worry about!"

"So, Father, when is this going to happen?"

"Well, I think it's best to do it before the fervor of demon-slaying cools down, so how about in a week or so? Oh, and you don't need to get new clothes. Please attend in the combat uniforms you're wearing. We want to honor your team's accomplishments as well."

With this announcement from Uncle Dis, the group's excitement surged again.

Especially the parents who heard this news for the first time seemed very happy.

This time, not only me but everyone else will be honored, so Grandpa and Grandma didn't say anything.

However... will this further strengthen the existing trend with this award ceremony?

It seems Oug was thinking the same thing, as he nodded when our eyes met and then walked toward Uncle Dis.

"Father, may I have a moment?"

"You can be a little more friendly, you know?"

"Let's save that for another time. We have something important to discuss."

"Something important...?"

Here is the English translation of the text you provided:

"Uncle Dis looked a little lonely, but we couldn't afford to pay much attention to that this time.

So, in a hushed tone, Oug informed Uncle Dis about the concerns I had just mentioned.

"I see... So it's because Shin and the others won so overwhelmingly that such misunderstandings have spread among the citizens."

"Demons are by no means weak. As evidence, the Swed Kingdom was on the defensive until we arrived, and they suffered significant damage. If people mistakenly believe that demons are weak and recklessly engage with them..."

"They might face a severe counterattack."

It seemed that the rumors had not reached the upper echelons of the country as much as they had among the common people.

However, if this trend permeated the military, there might be those who would attempt to subdue demons when they appeared.

Moreover, this trend might be further reinforced by the upcoming commendation ceremony.

To prevent that, I wanted Uncle Dis to issue a warning to the military.

"Understood. I will inform the military. 'The reason we were able to defeat demons this time was thanks to Shin=Walford, an exceptional individual, and it should not lead to the misunderstanding that demons are weak.'"

"There's one point that concerns me a bit, but... I guess that's the general idea."

Will this be enough? The soldiers who actually faced demons in the Swed Kingdom should have realized the demons' strength, but what about the soldiers of the Airstead Kingdom?

I heard that Strom had annihilated the Imperial Army "after" the battle.

However, they hadn't actually witnessed the demons' combat.

I hoped Uncle Dis's warning would make them more cautious.

Also, I didn't know how Els and Iys would react.

If they thought demons were not a big deal, they might refuse to help.

In that case, it would be a problem for the smaller countries around Airstead and the former Empire.

There was a possibility that they could lose control to the other side.

...I guess we'll have to rely on the scheming Crown Prince for this...

Honestly... it's enough that defeating demons leads to other problems...

"Shin, what's wrong?"

After finishing the meal and returning to the cottage, sitting on the living room sofa, Sicily asked while making tea.

"... Did I make a weird face?"

"It's more like... you had a worried look."

She placed the tea on the table and sat down next to me.

"If you have something to worry about, can you tell me? I want to be of help to you, even if just a little."

She said this while gently holding my hand.

"Alright, it's pointless to keep worrying by myself."

"Worries of Shin? That's scary to think about..."

"No... it's a pretty straightforward concern."

Despite being cautioned by Grandma, I explained the concerns I had shared with Oug and Uncle Dis.

"I see... Is that how it's going?"

"This is a rather complicated issue."

After explaining the situation, Grandpa and Grandma also had serious expressions.

"Could it be... we caused unnecessary trouble?"

"Don't be ridiculous, there's no way. If you guys hadn't defeated the demons, several countries might have been lost."

"That's right, it's unnecessary to worry about that. And if you've heard the story in the short time you were out shopping, it might be pretty widespread."

"By the way, Grandma, did you hear about it? When you were out shopping."

"I was so preoccupied with buying a swimsuit for the first time in a while."

I asked an unnecessary question.

"I hope it won't affect the Three Nations Conference..."

"It's something that depends on the other party, and we can't say anything until it starts."

I see, that's what's on their minds, after all.

The demons have already attacked the surrounding countries twice. Their intent to invade is clear.

So, if possible, we should take the initiative. For that, the World Alliance is indispensable, but not all large countries are as laid back as Airstead.

Especially Els is a merchant country. If they don't see any profit in it, they might not form an alliance.

...I want to believe that there won't be such problems in the face of a global crisis...

"Sigh..."

"This has become quite a problem."

After confiding my worries, we couldn't find a solution and the conversation ended with us relying on Oug's schemes.

Why did it come to this?

"Will we have to rely on Oug again?"

"Isn't it okay not to bear everything on your own?"

Sicily, who had come to the cottage's balcony to cool off with me, said this."

Here is the English translation of the text you provided:

"What do you mean?"

"Everyone has their own roles. Didn't Granny say so too? Selling your magical tools is the job of your brother and Alice's father, so you don't have to think about making money."

"I see... it's a matter of playing to one's strengths."

"To be honest, I don't think we can match Strom, who we saw at the guard post. Shin is truly one of a kind. That's why I think Shin should focus on defeating the immediate enemies and leave other matters to those who excel in them."

"I haven't relied on others, have I?"

"Negotiating with other countries is His Highness's specialty. In fact, he might get angry if Shin gets involved, right?"

"Haha, that's quite possible, 'Don't encroach on my territory,' and all."

That sounds like something Oug would say.

"We still think we can't rely on ourselves... but we're all trying to make ourselves dependable for Shin."

"Is that so?"

They had been thinking that way... I didn't know.

"I hope that one day, you'll also rely on me for healing."

"That's right... I hope it happens someday."

"Yes, so please teach me a lot from now on, okay?"

Sicily smiled and said that, and her smile was so dazzling... The words telling me not to carry it all alone made me happy.

"Oh..."

Before I knew it, I was hugging Sicily.

"Thank you... Sicily."

"You're welcome. If it lightens your emotional burden, that's a good thing."

"Did you heal my heart?"

"Hehe, yes, that's right. Healing your heart is my job. I won't entrust it to anyone else."

"Right... please, do it."

"Yes, I've been entrusted with it."

We gazed at each other up close.

And then...

When we returned to the cottage's living room, Granny said,

"... The bedroom is separate."

"... You were watching, weren't you?"

"Hau..."

Granny put a damper on the mood just when things were getting exciting.

In the end, we all slept in our respective bedrooms that day.

"I don't want to go back..."

"I know, right..."

On the first day, we all played together as a team, so the next day, we visited the Claude family.

As for the others, it seemed like they got really into beach volleyball and were playing with their families.

They were even talking about holding a tournament or something...

Here is the English translation of the text you provided:

Amidst all this, it seemed that Cecilia and Sylvia were busily engaged in hunting down the monsters that had been on the rise due to their duties in the Magic Corps. They didn't want to exert themselves even on their day off, so they brought deck chairs to the beach and relaxed in their swimsuits.

They really gave off the vibe of big sisters on vacation.

"I'm glad you're enjoying yourselves."

"Well, places like Rittenheim Resort aren't something we can visit often. We should make the most of it."

"Huh? You're a noble's daughter, aren't you?"

"That's true; my family is noble. But I'm independent now. When I go to have fun, I have to pay for it myself."

"Sure, the Magic Corps pays better than regular trade company employees, right? But that doesn't mean you can afford to come to Rittenheim Resort."

"I can't forget the envious glares we got when we submitted our vacation requests."

Sylvia said, trembling slightly as she recalled it.

...Her words are polite, but is she an "S"?

"Sigh... I don't want to go back!"

"What are you saying, Cecilia?"

"O-Oh, Mother!?"

Irene, dressed in a black bikini and wearing a parka, appeared, causing Cecilia to break out in a cold sweat.

"Did I...hear something I shouldn't have just now?"

"It's just...your imagination!"

"Y-Yes!"

"Is that so?"

"Yes, yes!"

"Alright then. But don't forget, I won't tolerate any slacking off on your duties because of your vacation."

"Yes! We understand!"

It sounds like a "Yes, Mom!" moment. Which is appropriate since they are both their moms.

"In that regard, Shin, you're amazing. Receiving a second commendation."

"I don't really have a sense of having done anything particularly extraordinary."

"Not getting conceited is also admirable. Truly, being able to marry Cecilia to such an exceptional person makes me happy."

"I haven't married her yet..."

"But that's what I wanted to discuss with her father. Once this commotion is over, you should have a wedding ceremony."

"What!?"

Did I just hear something incredible? Wasn't it supposed to be after graduating?

"Just watch, once this commotion is resolved, Shin will become a hero not only in this country, but in the whole world."

"Even now, you're already quite popular in the Magic Corps."

"It's on a different scale. With someone like that as your partner, it should be fine to have the wedding ceremony now. You'll earn even more in the future."

"So, that's why you arranged for the carriage and the cottage to be brought here?"

"That's right. I also talked to Lady Merida. I wanted Cecilia to get used to the Walford family, so I had you stay in the same cottage."

Grandma was on board as well.

As for Grandpa...well, I can only see a sad ending.

"But what about the Royal Academy of High Magic? I'm still a student..."

"You can continue attending. From the moment you enroll, you are legally an adult, so there's no reason you can't get married while you're still studying."

"Is that so?"

Come to think of it, that's true. They often treat us like children, and I forgot about that because this trip is with our guardians.

"In the first place, the primary reason people don't marry while they're students is economic. In that regard, Shin, your account balance must be quite impressive with the royalties from the Kingdom's standard equipment and communication device charges, right?"

"Well, yeah..."

"It's...quite impressive."

"I wonder how much it is..."

"So, honestly, there's no reason not to have a wedding ceremony. Keep that in mind."

"Alright, I understand."

By the way, Cecilia has been quiet for a while now.

I thought that and looked at Cecilia...

"Sigh..."

It seemed like she was spacing out.

"Being the wife of a wealthy hero..."

"How enviable..."

Her sisters-in-law were envious.

The same people who were saying, "Don't marry Cecilia!" just a while ago.

Does that mean she's truly recognized?

"You all should find husbands soon, too."

"We do have that intention, but..."

"After seeing such high-quality merchandise, nothing else seems appealing..."

"Shin isn't just high-quality merchandise; he's a special item. He's the grandson of a hero, a hero himself, yet he's not conceited in the slightest. On top of that, he's a genius in creating magical tools, and the company he started is sure to prosper... It's almost like a joke."

My existence has become the subject of jokes.

"There aren't many people who can compete with someone like that... Except for His Highness August, perhaps?"

"...That's true."

"Sigh, we need to face reality."

"That's right."

I hope my sisters-in-law find good partners too. If they become envious of our relationship, I wouldn't know how to handle it.

"By the way, Shin, sorry for the sudden question, but do you have a preference for the church? It's better to decide now."

"Oh, actually, I asked Aug to handle it, and we've already decided."

"Oh, impressive. You've already chosen a church. So, which church did you ask?"

"It's the Arlsheid Cathedral."

"...Huh?"

"Aug said it was okay when I asked him."

"Eeehhhh!?"

The screams of my mother-in-law and sisters-in-law echoed.

"I-Is that, um, really true!?"

"Yes, he said to let him know once we decide on a date."

I had some time during our trip preparations, so I asked Aug, and he readily agreed.

"A wedding at the Arlsheid Cathedral..."

"I'm really envious..."

"I'm envious too. They only hold weddings there for the royal family..."

"Is that so? You're lucky to have such a good relationship with Aug."

Feeling the privilege of the royal family, huh. It's nice once in a while.

"Maybe it's different, but..."

"Shin, Arlsheid Cathedral..."

Finally, Cecilia returned.

"When we attended a wedding at the Darm Cathedral, didn't we make a promise? That's why I asked Aug. I hope you don't mind that I didn't tell you?"

I was afraid to promise too easily and disappoint her if it didn't work out, so I'm glad it's settled.

Cecilia shook her head, then hugged me.

"Don't apologize. I'm so happy that it's actually happening. I'm about to burst with joy."

I'm glad she's happy. Now that the venue is decided, let's do our best to defeat the demons.

"Yes!"

Cecilia replied with a beaming smile.

I wonder if the surprise was successful.

Irene had a heartwarming smile in her eyes, while my sisters-in-law had complex expressions, seemingly happy and envious at the same time.

By the way, what about Cecil and Lois?

"Merlin, you're really something, getting everyone's attention with that outfit."

"Wearing something like that... aren't you afraid of getting scolded by Merida?"

"I'm not trying to stand out, you know? And besides, Merida knows that I turn completely tan when I come to the summer beach, so it's not an act of rebellion against her, you see?"

What am I doing...?

"...What are you two even doing?"

"Huh? No! Irene, well, you see..."

"Yes! We've been receiving precious lessons from Lord Merlin, my lady!"

"Despite Shin bringing such a wonderful story..."

Oh, Irene is trembling...

"Why are you ignoring your future son-in-law and brother-in-law while they're here? Sit down right there!"

"Huh? But we're on this scorched sand..."

"Sit... down."

"Yes, ma'am."

Irene started scolding my father-in-law and brother-in-law, so Cecilia and I decided to move away from the scene.

Grandpa seems to be fishing with the lure I gave him.

"Aah... Irene was quite intimidating."

"I've always been more afraid of Mom than Dad..."

"Even Cecilia gets scolded?"

"Yes, it does happen. She doesn't raise her voice, but when Mom quietly gets mad... just remembering it makes me feel uneasy..."

She clung to my arm, really trembling... How scary was her mother?

"I used to get scolded by Grandma all the time."

"I see... I can sort of imagine."

"Hey, isn't that cruel?"

"Hahaha, sorry!"

She laughed while moving away from me.

"Wait a minute!"

"Ahh!"

"Why are you doing this even here?"

As we chased each other, it seemed we had arrived at the beach volleyball tournament venue.

"Oh... it's still quite a spectacle."

"Really? His Highness's Thunder Strike is unstoppable..."

"Thunder Strike..."

I noticed Aug, who had enhanced his body and jumped high, activating his signature lightning magic to attack the beach ball. The ball enveloped in lightning made erratic movements and pierced the opponent's court.

"Lyn's Wind Strike can't be stopped either."

"Wind Strike..."

This time, Lyn activated wind magic and struck the ball. The ball, accelerated by the power of the wind, pierced the opponent's court at an incredible speed.

"They didn't have these fancy names for their attacks yesterday."

"Alice came up with names. She started calling her attack with fire 'Flame Attack'..."

"Take this! Flame Tornado!"

As she said that, Alice used composite magic, combining fire and wind, to create a spiral of flaming attack on the beach ball.

"I won't let you! Water Block!"

In order not to lose to the flames, Tony wrapped his arm in water magic to block.

"Ah! Damn it!"

"Leave it to me!"

Olivia, who had strengthened her body, jumped from a distance to retrieve the blocked ball.

"Julius!"

"Here I go! Power Bomb!"

With Thor's toss, Julius attacked at full power and pierced through the block, sending the ball into the opponent's court.

"Well done, Julius."

"Even if it's His Highness on the court, I won't hold back."

"Good point. Then I'll give it my all as well."

"Hehe, be prepared."

"It's my turn next."

"Let's go!"

...What's going on here?

"Wasn't this supposed to be a family tournament?"

"No one can keep up with something like this. Our family retired early."

"Why aren't Yuri and Maria in this?"

"It's four on four, so they're waiting their turn."

...Everyone is too obsessed!

And so... while creating new competitions and interacting with the family team, we were able to enjoy a brief vacation.

"We thoroughly enjoyed it!"

We spent three nights at Littenheim Resort, and our vacation was over.

In the end, we didn't share a bedroom because Grandma was keeping an eye on us.

It was a bit disappointing, but after three nights, Cecilia seemed to have become quite accustomed to living with us. She was already on good terms with Grandma, and she made sure to spend time with Grandpa, so both of them acted as if Cecilia being with us was perfectly normal.

We'll return to the capital by carriage, and as soon as we get back, we have the knighthood ceremony.

Now everyone will become famous.

Maybe it's time to teach them Gate Magic?

Once they become well-known, walking in the city can become quite troublesome...

Lately, I've tried to disguise myself or use optical camouflage magic when I walk in the city. Otherwise, I sometimes cause a commotion when people recognize me.

I don't like using optical camouflage magic much, as it's risky.

Since I can't see where I'm going, I occasionally bump into people.

Gate Magic, which Grandpa understood better, would be more suitable.

Considering the previous battles against the Demons and the Magical Volleyball match, they should have the basics down by now.

When I informed everyone about it, Lin, in particular, was delighted.

"It's finally here. I'll work hard to learn it!"

With a determined attitude, she was ready to get started.

"Where will we do this?"

"I'd like to teach the basics of the Gate Magic through visualization, ideally at the academy's research lab."

Even during the long vacation, the research society activities continued. The academy was still open for use, so after the knighthood ceremony, we decided that we would all practice Gate Magic together.

Three days after returning to the capital, when our travel fatigue had mostly worn off, we received a summons from the royal palace.

This time, since we were all receiving knighthood together, Grandpa and Grandma were going to participate with other family members.

"It's finally here..."

"Sigh... I'm so nervous..."

"It's nice that we're all together this time. Last time, it was just me."

"You managed to pull through well last time..."

At my house, Cecilia and Maria gathered, and the three of us got into the carriage, heading toward the royal palace.

Maybe it was because I had endured this ordeal alone last time, but I felt more relaxed than Cecilia and Maria.

Finally, when we arrived at the royal palace, other carriages had already arrived.

"Everyone! Good morning!"

"You're way too nervous, Alice."

"Even if you say that! It's the knighthood ceremony! I never thought I would have anything to do with it!"

"That's right... if you were still working as a waitress, you wouldn't have received knighthood..."

"You should give up already."

As the members of the team descended from the carriages, who had arrived, they were all gathering.

Although we've been to the royal palace more often recently, this time it's for the knighthood ceremony. It's only natural to feel nervous, right?

"Now, today is the knighthood ceremony, but the real challenge comes after that."

Originally living in the royal palace, Olg would come to see us after we entered the waiting room.

"After that?"

"Various people will approach you. Especially those who are single, be careful not to get involved with strange men."

"Yes!"

"It's not like we need a man."

After receiving knighthood, people will come to meet us... Especially Maria and others who said they want boyfriends need to be careful.

Lin remains as she always is.

More importantly, I wonder what will happen to the academy after the vacation ends?

Will our class be crowded with people?

Will Mark and Olivia be alright?

As we are advised by Olg about what's to come in the future...

"Ultimate Magicians, it's time."

Finally, the soldiers who came to welcome us have arrived.

Everyone seems to be at the peak of tension, frozen stiff.

Olivia, in particular, looks a bit pale...

However, since we've come this far, there's no use panicking, so we followed the lead of the soldiers who came to welcome us and reached the audience chamber.

While waiting in front of the doors to the audience chamber, we heard a voice saying, "Heroes who have saved not only Arlsheid but also various countries! The arrival of the Ultimate Magicians!"

After this resounding declaration, the doors opened.

It was the same as the last time. Nobles, officials, and military officers applauded and greeted us.

Except for Olg, who had seen this scene before, the rest of us were caught up in the atmosphere.

"Let's go."

With Olg's words, everyone snapped back to reality and started walking.

Today, since Olg was here as a member of the Ultimate Magicians, Mei and Aunt Julia were near the throne.

"His Majesty Deseum von Arlsheid, the entrance of the guests!"

Upon the appearance of Uncle Deseum, everyone in the audience chamber kneeled.

"Today, I am truly delighted to be able to celebrate the heroes who have appeared in Arlsheid. The accomplishments this time are unprecedented in history. Therefore, we have prepared a special medal."

The people present briefly stirred at his words.

"The Ultimate Magicians will be awarded the 'Golden Dragon Special Medal.'"

As soon as Uncle Deseum declared it, the attendees gasped. This was because the golden dragon is the symbol on the flag of the Arlsheid Kingdom.

They were being awarded a medal named after the Golden Dragon, a symbol of great honor for the people of Arlsheid.

I've only been in Arlsheid for a few months, so I don't quite grasp the significance of it.

By the way, dragons are mythical creatures and don't actually exist in this magical world.

Despite living in a world with magic, I still wish I could see a dragon...

"Now, I will award the medals to each of you."

With this announcement, names were called out one by one, and each of us received the medal from Uncle Deseum.

Everyone was very stiff, and Alice, for example, extended both her arms and legs at the same time.

One by one, the team members were called to receive their medals, and Olg was one of the last two to receive it.

"You've become quite distinguished, August. With this, I can entrust the country to you without worry."

"What are you saying, Father? You still have much to contribute. Please continue to do your best."

"August..."

Uncle Deseum seems moved by Olg's words, but I think it's something else. It's probably because taking the throne would mean a loss of personal freedom.

Somehow, I was called last to receive the medal.

"Receiving a second commendation in a few months is unprecedented in the history of the kingdom. It's a remarkable achievement."

"I am truly grateful."

In response to Uncle Deseum's kingly demeanor, I answered in a subject-like manner. Then, I received the medal and remembered something.

"Shin Wolford has become the king of the mages who is unrivaled in this world. Therefore, I bestow upon him the title of 'Demon King.' Let everyone praise it! It is the birth of the Demon King, Shin!"

...

What?! What just happened? Why does Uncle Deseum know about this?

Ah, Olg! Did Olg tell Uncle Deseum?!

I turned to look at Olg, who was looking down and trembling.

Why is he trying to hold back his laughter?

What... what did he do?

Thinking that, I tried to go to Olg when suddenly there was a loud cheer from the attendees.

It was so sudden that I was taken aback!

"The Mage King! Demon King Shin!"

"To be bestowed a title at this age!"

"Demon King! Demon King! Demon King!"

Everyone kept chanting the name Demon King.

Stop it! Please don't call me by that name!

Please... some names
for my cafe-by-day, bar-by-night business
