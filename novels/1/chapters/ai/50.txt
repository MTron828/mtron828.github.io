trip
to explore the nightlife scene in Bangkok

To report this matter to the King of Swied, I was allowed to enter the royal palace.

Still reeling from the despairing story I heard earlier, I walked through the Swied Kingdom's royal palace.

"Shin, don't look so tired."

"Whose fault is it?! Whose!"

"That's why you shouldn't talk like Lady Merida. Well, the desire to read your story is also the wish of the people, so give up and become an entertainer. You'll also get royalties, you know?"

"I don't need any more money!"

Even so, from the fees for defensive magical items to communication fees, usage fees, and the reward for this time, royalties will keep coming in, you know?"

"What's that! Shin, you're so lucky!"

"Would you like to do it instead, Alice?"

"Huh? Well... becoming a public figure throughout the kingdom is a bit..."

"So you'd rather be a public figure!"

"More importantly, if the hero who defeated the demon had such a tired look, everyone would be worried. Put on a brave face, even if you have to force it."

"...90% of the reason I'm tired is because of Oug, though..."

"Hahaha, whoops, it seems we've arrived at the king's office."

He laughed and deflected my questions!

I want to press him about Oug, but we've really arrived at the king's office, so I can't push further.

The soldier who guided me seemed extremely perplexed.

When that soldier knocked on the door of the office, a middle-aged man's voice could be heard from inside, giving permission to enter.

Inside the room, there was a well-built man with chestnut hair streaked with white and a mustache, sitting in a chair. Next to him was a blond man in armor and an elderly man who appeared to be a civil servant.

"It's been a while, King Swied."

"Oh! Your Highness August!"

It seemed like the well-built man was the king. King Swied stood up and shook August's hand, expressing his gratitude.

"For this matter, we received exceptional support from the Earlside Kingdom. If we couldn't call for help quickly with that communication device... If we couldn't defend against the demon's attack with that defensive magical item... And if Your Highness hadn't come to our aid... Swied Kingdom would have been reduced to ashes by now. Thank you so much!"

"No, demons are a threat to the world. I simply did what was expected of me as someone who lives in this world."

"Even so, it doesn't change the fact that you protected the country known as the Swied Kingdom in reality. Thank you again. Please convey my gratitude directly to His Majesty Diseum."

"Understood."

As I observed the interaction between King Swied and Oug, a blond soldier? Knight? who had been standing nearby approached and inquired, "And what about the person who made that defensive magical item, Shin Waldford?"

"Oh, I... it's me."

"Oh, it's you! Thanks to your magical item, we were able to protect this country. I've heard that it also minimized the casualties among our troops. I want to express my gratitude. Thank you."

He offered his thanks, but...

"No, I wish I could have come sooner..."

"You and your group arrived promptly. To be honest, it was faster than anyone could have imagined. It's greedy and harsh to expect more."

"Thank you," I replied, but there are still a significant number of people who lost their lives. It may seem arrogant, but it's something that continues to weigh heavily on my mind.

"Which one is Sicily von Claude?" The elderly civil servant who had been standing by also spoke up.

"Oh, that's me!"

"I heard that many lives were saved thanks to you. Thank you so much."

"No, there were still people we couldn't save..."

"It's impossible to save everyone. You did everything within your power. You saved more lives than others could have. Thank you. Allow me to express my gratitude on behalf of the citizens."

He bowed deeply as he said this.

"Please, don't bow like that!"

"Claude, I also want to thank you. Thank you."

"Your Majesty, that's too much!"

"Rumor has it that some people call you a saint."

"Oh, really?"

"Oh, that's embarrassing..."

Sicily was clearly uncomfortable with being called a saint.

"Oh, by the way, I heard that you, Claude, are engaged to Waldford, aren't you? A saint cannot have a husband, you know."

"How did you know?"

The civil servant questioned, and I couldn't help but wonder how he knew about our engagement, especially considering it involves someone from a foreign country and a non-noble.

"It seems you don't realize your own worth."

"That's right. This guy doesn't understand how amazing he is."

"Hey, Oug..."

Oug even chimed in with such comments.

Then, King Swied spoke to me, "You are not only of interest to the Earlside but also to other countries. People are curious about your actions, your relationships, and who you'll marry. I would have liked to have my daughter married to you."

Wait! Please spare me from royal matters!

"Well, with the Earlside King's declaration, that's no longer possible."

"But wasn't that declaration intended for the Earlside Kingdom's internal audience?"

"It's the same thing. Even if it's meant for domestic consumption, if foreign countries take advantage of it to propose marriage, it would alienate not only the Earlside but also other countries."

I see. It's quite a complicated situation.

"That's why I knew about your engagement, and I received a message from the ambassador in the Earlside Kingdom. I borrowed a communication device."

"I see. I was wondering how you knew when we just had our engagement party yesterday."

"That's a great tool. I'm trying to arrange a few for the Earlside Kingdom as well. Of course, I'll pay the fees for both the equipment and communication."

So, more money is coming in... I have no use for it.

"Well, that's how it is. I know about you guys. The fact that you're engaged means it's not an arranged marriage; you fell in love and got engaged."

"I see."

"Congratulations. I also offer my blessings."

"Thank you."

I received blessings from King Swied, even though we came here for a different purpose.

In this atmosphere of celebration, it's important to remember that I didn't come here for blessings.

"King Swied, I apologize for interrupting, but I have something to report regarding this incident."

"There are reports from the troops on the scene if you need to make a report."

"I want to report something that I know because I'm familiar with the leader of the demons, Oliver Stroh."

Oug's words made the three representatives from Swied tense up.

"In this recent demon attack... there were no monsters accompanying them."

"I heard about that."

"And... Stroh was not involved in this attack."

"What? The leader was not present?"

To attack a country without their leader and without powerful monsters to bolster their forces is still a threat to regular people.

However, Oug continued, "We have the power to counter the demons, but, respectfully, I don't believe your country has that capability. Considering that, it's not surprising..."

Certainly, it's not surprising if that's all there is to it.

But Oug looked at my face and continued.

"Shin here has been closing in on Strom, the leader of the demons, to the point of almost capturing him. To orchestrate an attack on the Empire, Strom had devised intricate strategies against both the Kingdom and the Empire. It's hard to believe that Strom, the greatest threat, would ignore Shin's presence."

"That's true..."

"So, Shin and I thought this might be a diversion, and we hurried back to Earlside, but..."

"You went back to Earlside?"

Ah, the gate...

"Yes, Shin can use teleportation magic. He can only go to specific locations..."

"What?! Teleportation magic?"

"Specific locations? Ah, I see, you've set a point in Earlside."

They're bending the truth ever so slightly... I can't really say that if I've been to a place once, I can go there using this magic.

...Now, I'm in the king's office.

"Yes, and we thought it might be a diversion to attack Earlside..."

"Since His Majesty is here, it seems there was no attack..."

Yes, that's the most puzzling part of this whole incident. Certainly, if we hadn't come, Swied Kingdom might have fallen to the demons, even without a full-scale attack. But if we hadn't come, and if we hadn't prepared for such an attack, would Strom have really considered such an action?

Could he have been planning the entire assault, including our preparations? That's why I believed this attack might be a diversion, and Earlside was the real target.

"As a result, this straightforward attack was all the demons did. I have no idea what it means..."

"So... we don't understand the demons' intentions... It's not safe to relax just because we repelled this attack... Is that what you're saying?"

"Exactly. This might be the end of the attack, or there might be another one. Since we don't know what Strom is thinking, we shouldn't let our guard down."

In the face of the demons' actions, which were entirely inscrutable, silence descended upon the king's office.

"There are also considerations for the future. Ideally, I'd like to form a united front by teaming up with other nations. Would you be willing to support this?"

"That's true... this is too heavy an issue for one nation to bear. We'll hold discussions, but it's fine for Swied Kingdom to consider joining the alliance."

"Thank you."

King Swied promised cooperation.

We'll need to continue discussions with other nations to advance the formation of the alliance.

If we all unite, I think we can shatter Strom's expectations.

I need to do my best as well...

"We are considering a summit with the heads of various countries in the near future. We will contact you once it's confirmed. Thank you."

"Understood. We'll be waiting for your call."

"That's all for the report. We'll take our leave then."

"We appreciate your valuable assistance in addition to the rescue. We'll also make regular reports through the communication device. It's quite convenient. Please convey my thanks to King Desoum for that."

"Understood."

With that, we left the king's office.

"Is something... happening?" Maria muttered. She must have felt uneasy after that conversation.

It's not unreasonable to think that way. Since we don't understand Strom's intentions, we have to consider all possibilities in our actions. For this reason, forming the alliance that Oug mentioned is the best option.

A world alliance... It's becoming quite grandiose.

"We'll discuss that and more when we return to Earlside. Shin, I'm counting on you."

"...Yeah."

It's the gate... right?

We can't afford to joke around at a time like this.

I connected the gate to the usual Earlside security station and we all jumped in.

Then...

"Oh! The Highnesses have returned!"

"Welcome back! Ultimate Magicians!"

"Welcome back!"

Many security personnel were waiting for us, and there was applause all around.

"Wow, this is surprising!"

Alice was surprised, and I agreed. Why are so many people gathered here?

"Welcome back, Your Highnesses. His Majesty is waiting for you."

"Yeah, understood. By the way, what's all the commotion?"

"Just a while ago, we received a report that His Highnesses repelled the demons from the Swied Kingdom, and those who had free time wanted to welcome you. And because His Highness's inauguration as Crown Prince was also celebrated, the entire capital is in an uproar. It'll probably continue for a few days."

I see, the report of our demon extermination in Swied Kingdom has already spread.

"Everyone is excited about the Ultimate Magicians' achievements!"

With that team name...

"It's going to be a festival for a while, but it can't be helped. The team name has become well-known, and it's for the best."

"Yes, given the uncertain situation ahead, your efforts will probably be rewarded with honors, won't they?"

"Huh? Honors? For us!?"

"This is getting incredible, isn't it..."

Well, that's true. I received a medal for defeating just one demon, so how many did we take down this time? In addition to that, there's no way we won't receive medals for saving a whole country from crisis.

As someone who has already received a medal once, I feel more relaxed than the others.

"We can discuss that later. Right now, there's something we need to discuss. Everyone, let's go."

"Yes!"

Under Oug's command, we left the security station and entered the royal castle.

As we passed by people inside the castle, we received words of congratulations and applause.

"You're amazing, Ultimate Magicians!"

"Great job, Your Highness! Ultimate Magicians!"

"Ultimate Magicians!"

The team name echoed through the hallways.

"Enough already..."

"Sh-Shin, hold on!"

"Leave it, Claude. He'll get used to it eventually."

Get used to it...?

I feel like that day will never come.

I was already exhausted before reaching Dis' office.

It seems that Dis is in a meeting room, not an audience hall, as he wants to hear the reports from all team members.

I heard this from one of the soldiers who went to report to Dis before us.

"Do we have to report too?"

"We were the ones who faced the group of demons. I'll report, and the rest of you can add any details if needed."

"Oh, I see."

We arrived at the meeting room, and a soldier standing at the door opened it for us.

"August-sama!"

"Big brother!"

In the meeting room, there were Dis and several high-ranking officials of the country. Among them, for some reason, Ellie and May-chan were also present.

As soon as we entered the meeting room, Ellie and May-chan rushed to Oug's side.

May-chan's magical talents had developed, allowing her to enhance her physical abilities, and she had reached Oug's side before Ellie. However, it was a very close call.

"Big brother!"

"August-sama!"

"Hugs!"

"Why are you two here? This isn't a place for you to be."

"Well, isn't it natural to be concerned about the well-being of your beloved fiance?"

"I didn't say that, but this is a meeting room. It's not a place for ordinary people."

"I was really worried... Ever since I heard that August-sama had repelled the demons in the Kingdom of Swiord, I couldn't sit still..."

"I gave them permission. They were really worried. But more importantly..."

"What is it, Father?"

"May, are you feeling a bit down?"

"Huh? Oh! May!"

"You... didn't notice?"

May-chan, who had reached Oug a bit earlier, clung to him. Ellie followed and hugged Oug, forming a sandwich with May-chan.

"May! Pull yourself together!"

"Eh..."

"Eh?"

"Ellie's bosom... is a weapon..."

She muttered and then slumped.

"Hey! Don't say weird things and pass out! May!? May!"

Ellie tried to shake May-chan awake.

A weapon...? Even with a dress on, is it really that remarkable...?

"It's so soft."

"Nothing we can do. It's our team, after all."

It seemed like it was going to be an emotional moment, but... typical of our team, I guess.

"Is it over now?"

"Sorry for the wait, Father. Someone, take them outside."

"Yes, sir!"

"Huh? Wait, this isn't how the reunion scene is supposed to end, is it!?"

"Just wait in your room, we'll visit you later."

"Come on..."

The door closed with a bang, and the reaction in the meeting room was a mix of "Yare Yare" from our team members and...

"Isn't that Lady Elizabeth from the Coral Duke family?"

"You've been waiting together all this time, haven't you?"

"Well, I've never seen Lady Elizabeth like that before..."

"Indeed..."

The higher-ups in the room seemed perplexed by the whole exchange.

"Hehe, whether it's August, May, Elizabeth, or Shin-kun, they all seem so lively when they're together. It's a good thing."

"More importantly, Father, it's time for the report on this matter."

"Can't we have a little more of a parent-child conversation..."

"We can do that later. For now, let's hear the report about the recent demon attack in the Kingdom of Swiord and its repulsion."

Ignoring Dis' downcast expression, Oug began his report.

...I'll have to follow up with him later.

Then, they made the same report to the King of Swiord and discussed the future.

"I see. Will the Kingdom of Swiord cooperate with the alliance?"

"Yes. Other countries bordering the Empire will likely cooperate as well. The problem is..."

"The Els Free Trade Union and the East Holy Kingdom, right?"

Els is a country ruled by merchants that was previously mentioned, and the East Holy Kingdom is the headquarters of the world's only religion, the Creation Faith.

The Creation Faith is a religion that worships the deity believed to have created this world. It teaches that through virtuous deeds, one can go to the deity's realm after death. Incidentally, the deity does not have a specific name.

In every country and town, there are churches that handle all aspects of life, from baptisms and weddings to funerals.

The name "East" belonged to a priest from the past. There was a country similar to the Empire that had oppressed the common people, and to free them from tyranny, he had fought in that country. In the end, he was executed.

After the execution of East, the remaining residents rose up and overthrew that country. The country they established later idolized East as the founding father and the Creation Faith took the lead. The head of the Creation Faith became the head of the nation, and this continues to the present day.

With Els and East added to Earlshide and the Empire, they were known as the "Four Great Powers." Since the Empire is no longer around, it's just the "Three Great Powers" now.

They were considered great powers for a reason...

"Will they compete for leadership..."

"That's likely."

"Really... At a time when humanity should join hands and cooperate..."

"I will handle those negotiations."

"Your Highness?"

Oug stepped forward to negotiate with Els and East.

"I am also a member of the Ultimate Magicians, so I should be in a good position to lead the negotiations."

"...You're right. August, can we count on you?"

"I'm on it. I'll work to successfully negotiate for the sake of humanity's survival."

"Good. Then send envoys to Els and East and arrange a meeting about the alliance in the near future."

"Yes, sir!"

"Well, we'll take our leave now."

"Ah, I understand. I'm sorry for this when everyone has just returned from defeating the demons. Please, take your time to rest."

"Yes! Thank you!"

Saying that, they left the meeting room.

"Phew... I was nervous..."

"Most of the people in there were prominent figures in the country. I was worried you might get too nervous and say something wrong."

"But in the end, it was mostly His Highness doing the talking."

"Still, just being in that place was nerve-wracking."

"I'm... just the daughter of a town's restaurant, so why was I there?"

"It feels surreal even now..."

They all seemed quite nervous. After leaving the meeting room, they began speaking one by one.

"Even though we're done for today... it seems like there's quite a commotion in the city. Knowing Father, he might be planning a parade."

"A parade!?"

"Hey, come on! Please stop!"

"Even so, we, the Ultimate Magicians, did something worthy of it. If there's a demand from the citizens, Father might consider it."

"Being called by our team name again, huh..."

"If they keep saying it so much, you might get used to it. It's not a bad opportunity."

"I feel like I'll die of embarrassment before getting used to it..."

"But everyone seems happy about it, and it's not a weird name!"

"Thanks, Sicily. You're really kind."

"Ehehe..."

I pet Sicily's head, soothing my agitated heart.

Sigh... I feel a bit calmer now.

"Damn... these idiots! They're so affectionate no matter where they are..."

...Maria's resentful glare sends shivers down my spine!

"L-look! Thanks to this incident, Maria might become famous too, or she might meet someone!"

"...Who'd want to meet someone after becoming famous?"

"D-do you think so?"

"Sigh... I wish I had a boyfriend..."

"I'm fine. Magic is my lover."

"That's true for Lynn..."

Sigh... I envy Sicily and Olivia...

They're all so cute. I wonder why I haven't had any encounters?

Listening to the girls' complaints, I arrived at Oug's room.

By the way, this is my first time coming to Oug's room.

"This is my room; make yourselves at home. Hey, come in!"

"Yes!"

I heard Mei-chan's voice from inside. It seems they've been waiting in Oug's room after being told to leave the meeting room.

And when I entered the room, I was welcomed by Ellie and Mei-chan.

"Welcome back, August-sama."

"Welcome back, Onii-sama!"

Oh, she didn't jump on me this time. Did she learn from earlier?

"I didn't expect to be kicked out this time..."

"I found myself sleeping in Onii-sama's bed!"

"I... have apologized multiple times for that..."

"Ellie-nee-sama, I was just relieved that Onii-sama was safe. So, don't worry about it."

"Ah, thank you..."

"But, Ellie-nee-sama's bosom is a weapon! It's dangerous!"

"That's right! Don't say weird things!"

"True... Ellie's bosom is indeed a weapon..."

"It's dangerous. Don't touch it!"

Ellie seems to have become close with our female members. I wonder if it's because they all bathed together?

"Leaving that aside, we need to discuss something important."

"Wait a moment, August-sama! Ignoring us is just cruel!"

"Oh, we can talk about it after everyone has left. Ellie would be embarrassed in front of everyone, wouldn't she?"

"...Y-You're right!"

What do you plan to do when everyone's around...

"I want to make it clear that we won't be doing what you're probably imagining. Public displays of affection are reserved for you."

"Ah..."

"Do they really display affection that much?"

Well, if they're a couple...

"...Don't call that 'displaying affection'... is that right!?"

"That's quite dreadful..."

"I guess we still need mosaic censorship!"

Why?

"There are normies here, too... But they're royal normies... Ugh! I can't say anything...!"

Maria's darkness runs deep.

"Anyway, about this important matter..."

"Yeah, I have a request for Shin."

"I see, I had a request as well."

"Oh? What is it...?"

"We want you to visit various countries."

"...Isn't that right?"

"You understand well."

"My request was the same. I'd like to accompany you on these visits."

"Visiting various countries..."

"That's the idea."

So, we have our next mission.

The training camp is temporarily suspended, and we'll travel to different countries to establish connections.

It seems communication devices are widely available, so we want to be able to respond quickly when we receive reports of demon appearances.

We won't make the same mistakes again!

"We seem to understand each other without saying much... It's suspicious after all..."

Why does it turn out like this?!
