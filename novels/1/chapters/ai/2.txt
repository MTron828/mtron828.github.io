When I woke up, I found myself inside a wooden house. I could smell the strong scent of wood, and I could hear the crackling sound of firewood. It seemed like I had been saved.

The pain in my body and the difficulty in breathing were gone, and I could open my eyes, which were probably filled with mud and couldn't be opened before.

As I looked around, I saw an old man with a white, luxuriant beard and long, white hair. Perhaps he was the headmaster of a school.

Setting aside any such comments, this person had undoubtedly helped me. I felt I should thank him and tried to speak.

"Ah, ah, oh."

My tongue still didn't cooperate.

The pain was gone, but I wondered if I had some kind of disability when I couldn't speak properly. Just then, the old man noticed my attempt to speak and came over.

"☆◎○▽◇□※▽△."

Once again, he spoke words that I didn't recognize.

As I blinked in confusion, the old man kindly smiled and brought a plate of soup to me, attempting to feed me. I felt embarrassed, so I tried to move my hand to eat by myself, but when I looked at my hand, I opened my eyes wide. There were chubby, childlike hands. I moved them hesitantly, and they were definitely my own hands.

I looked at the old man again and tilted my head in confusion.

"Is this guy too big?"

I thought.

As I stared blankly, the old man looked at me with a worried expression, so I drank the soup scooped up by the spoon he offered. When I finished the soup, he gently patted my head.

Once my stomach was full, I instantly felt sleepy and was put to bed. In the fading consciousness, I thought, "That old man is really big."

The next day, I woke up again and checked myself and my surroundings once more. It seemed like I had turned into a child.

No, no! What do you mean I've turned into a child? I thought. But it seemed like this was the reality. I had already experienced waking up and sleeping twice, so this didn't seem like a dream. If this was the reality, what did it mean that I had turned into a child? I pondered the question and surprisingly reached an answer rather quickly.

The old man who had likely saved me lit a fire from his hand when starting the fireplace.

Magic.

That word crossed my mind. As I looked around the house, I noticed that there were no modern conveniences. I wondered what kind of primitive life they were living, but it didn't seem like their standard of living was low.

In this mismatched situation for someone from the modern world, one possibility came to mind.

"This might not be Earth."

I had never seen magic on Earth. It's possible that I just didn't know about it, but the presence of magic as a given in this house made it seem likely that this wasn't Earth.

If that was the case, why was I here?

A world without magic on Earth.

My transformation into a child.

An unfamiliar language.

The answer I derived from this situation:

Reincarnation.

In this fantastical situation, I readily accepted this conclusion. My memories of my previous life's end were vague, so I probably had some sort of accident. I must have died without realizing it.

I couldn't help but feel a bit sad when I thought about it, but my parents had already passed away, and I didn't have a girlfriend. My life consisted of commuting between work and home, reading manga and light novels, watching anime, and occasionally going on motorcycle trips. I had always been anxious about the future, so my death wasn't that sad.

...It was a life that made me think that, which made me a little sad.

But more importantly, I had been reincarnated into a world with magic, experiencing something that everyone has likely thought about at least once: "What if I could go back to being a child with my current memories?"

Excitement filled me, and the old man who had helped me once again brought me soup.

And with a full belly, my consciousness began to fade as I drifted off to sleep. No matter how excited I was, I couldn't resist the drowsiness in this one-year-old body.
