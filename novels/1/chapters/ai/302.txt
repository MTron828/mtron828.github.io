They began the development of a magic-controlled car a few days ago.

For Bean Workshop, which originally created magic-powered vehicles, making a miniature version of it was a breeze.

Magic-powered vehicles also use motors for propulsion.

The control mechanism and operation closely followed the same format as the previous world's remote-controlled cars.

They created servos and used them for steering and acceleration.

This made the mechanism simpler, and the price was significantly reduced.

They quickly created a prototype and had children, Silver and Allen, who were the actual targets, test it.

They set up a simple course in the backyard for testing.

However, Max and Rain got very excited and wanted to play too, causing a fight over the two prototype cars they had.

In the end, they took turns playing with them, but they kept asking, "Is it my turn yet? Hurry up!"

Since this required the activation of magical tools, Sean, the youngest in their house at three years old, couldn't play and ended up crying.

He seemed to really want to play, declaring while crying, "I want to practice magic lots!"

This way, they could achieve the goal of playing with magical tools continuously.

However, they were told that having the same design as real magic-powered cars was tacky, so the majority of their time was spent on the exterior appearance.

Taking various opinions from the children, they finally came up with an appealing design for kids, and the magic-controlled car was completed.

As for the children's hair dryers, they were even simpler, and a prototype was created on the same day as the meeting to decide what to make.

They then had Sharl, Via, and Cresta, along with the new friend of Sharl, Alisha, use them as monitors from the perspective of actual users to identify any issues.

Since Via was a princess and did not usually set her own hair, she had never done it herself.

However, the purpose of this magical tool was to investigate whether the basic magical power level increases from using magical tools since childhood. Therefore, they decided that Via should actively use it as well.

So, Via also participated.

The evaluation from the four of them was perfect when it came to functionality and user-friendliness. Cresta and Alisha even expressed their intention to purchase the prototype immediately.

As for the issues, the girls unanimously mentioned that the appearance was not cute.

Well, the prototype magic-powered car and hairdryer were just scaled-down versions of adult products, so they might not have much appeal to children.

After discussing various ideas among the four of them, they managed to come up with a design that satisfied the girls, and the children's hair dryer was completed.

Once the finished products were ready to be shown, they contacted Aug.

"So, is this the completed toy?"

"Yes. This is a children's hair dryer, as you already know."

"I also participated in its development! This design was based on my suggestion, Father!"

"Did you create this, Your Highness?"

Beside Aug, Via proudly spoke to him. On the opposite side, there was a boy who looked just like Aug, albeit younger than Via, with wide eyes as he listened to Via's words.

He was Novak, Aug and Ellie's second child, the first prince. He was usually addressed as Novak by everyone.

Seeing Via's confident expression and the admiration in Novak's eyes, she held her head high.

Observing Via, Aug smiled and ruffled her hair.

"Indeed, it's a cute design for girls."

"Yes, you've done really well, Via."

"Your Highness, it's amazing!"

"Indeed."

Aug complimented Via while ruffling her hair, and Ellie joined in. Novak expressed his admiration. Via blushed but still proudly puffed out her chest.

"Now, here's the issue."

"Issue?"

Even Silver and Allen liked the magic-controlled car, and Shawn even mentioned practicing magic with it, so what was the problem?

When he looked at Aug with confusion, Aug sighed.

"You... You're using magic stones for this, right?"

"Yeah."

To move the motor and steering servo in the magic-controlled car, they used small magic stones. Otherwise, it wouldn't work.

"You... using magic stones for children's toys..."

Aug said with his head in his hands. Didn't he know?

"Didn't you know about the issues with importing a large number of magic stones from Kuang Long?"

"Issues with magic stone imports? Which one? There were various issues, so I'm not sure what you mean."

"The transportation issue."

"...Ah, you mean the damage to magic stones."

"Exactly."

That was the consultation I had received.

The import of magic stones from Kuang Long, which was the main attraction of their trade, had been causing problems.

I had received a consultation from Shaolin, who was responsible for handling this, about the magic stones colliding and getting damaged during transportation, resulting in small, unusable magic stones. My advice was to use cushioning material between the magic stones during transportation, but magic stones in Kuang Long were so abundant that they were practically given away. It was wasteful to use disposable cushioning material for such things. Even if they got damaged, they wouldn't become small enough to be inhaled by people, so there wasn't much danger. Therefore, my suggestion to use cushioning material was rejected by the Kuang Long head office.

As a result, a large number of small damaged magic stones, known as "Junk Magic Stones," were produced.

Junk Magic Stones were too small to be used in magic tools because they lacked sufficient output. However, these seemingly useless small magic stones were precisely what the magic-controlled toy, the Magicon Car, needed.

"I decided to use the Junk Magic Stones produced during the transportation of magic stones to cover the required output. Since magic stones are readily available and used for free, there's no additional cost, and no way to add it. As a result, it can be offered at a low price."

That's what I discussed with my father.

After I finished explaining, Aug finally seemed to understand, and he picked up the controller.

"I see. So, how do you play with this?"

"Well, first, you place the Magicon Car in a spacious area and try pushing the left thumb lever forward while infusing it with magic."

"Like this?"

Aug infused magic as I explained, and the Magicon Car started moving.

"Hmm, it's moving!?"

"If you tilt the right thumb lever to the left or right while infusing it with magic, it will turn in that direction."

"Like this?"

He followed my instructions, tilting the lever while infusing magic.

As Aug operated the controller as I had explained, the Magicon Car started moving freely around the room.

"When you push the left lever forward, it can also go in reverse."

"Hmm, I see. That could come in handy when it bumps into something."

That was the extent of the Magicon Car's controls.

Aug quickly grasped the knack of operating it and continued to drive the Magicon Car around the room for a while.

We all silently watched the Magicon Car racing around the room.

"Wow..."

Oh, Novak was the only one expressing his amazement.

The Magicon Car that had captivated Shawn, who was the same age as Novak, in their home seemed to have also enthralled Novak.

For a while, the only sounds in the room were Novak's exclamations of "Wow!" and "Amazing!"

Viola couldn't wait any longer and said, "Father, you're just like Max and Rain, never letting go of the controller."

Seeing Aug in the same state as his friends, Viola sighed in disbelief, "Even though you're an adult."

Perhaps her words had a subtle impact, as Aug, having become aware of that fact, finally operated the Magicon Car back to his feet and handed me the controller.

Novak begged, "Can I play too? I want to try!" but this was a magical tool.

Aug explained that it couldn't be used without activation. Novak, with a shocked expression, then declared seriously, holding back tears, "Then, I'll practice using magical tools!"

Aug was slightly wide-eyed, perhaps never expecting a three-year-old to say that he would practice using magical tools.

"I see. In that case, once you can properly activate magical tools, I'll buy one for Novak as well."

At these words, Novak's eyes sparkled.

"Alright! I promise, Dad!"

"Indeed."

Aug smiled, patted Novak's head, and handed the controller back to me.

"Hmm, it's quite an enjoyable toy. It should be well-received not only by children but even by upper-level students at the elementary academy."

"Adults would probably enjoy it too."

Viola responded coldly to Aug's feedback on the Magicon Car.

"No, no, Viola. This is actually quite remarkable, you know? It's something that not only children but also adults will surely get engrossed in."

"Indeed, other than when he's playing with Shin-san, it's rare to see Aug having so much fun."

"That's a testament to how amazing this magical toy is."

"May I try it too?"

"Yes, Ellie, go ahead."

With Aug's permission, Ellie was handed the controller.

Since she had heard the explanation earlier, Ellie was able to make the Magicon Car run smoothly. Even though she couldn't use magic, she could activate magical tools.

So, the Magicon Car started without any issues, but...

"Oh? Oh my!"

Being able to activate the magical tool and mastering its use were separate challenges.

Ellie couldn't control the Magicon Car as she intended.

As a result...

"Whoa!"

"Scream!"

The Magicon Car went on a rampage, involving the attendants, guards, and maids who were present in the room.

The attendants and maids were running in a panic. The guards, understandably, didn't run away, but they seemed hesitant to forcefully stop the Magicon Car controlled by Ellie.

Novak was excited by the unexpected rampage of the Magicon Car.

As a result, the room descended into chaos.

"Oh? Oh? Oh?"

"Ellie! Isn't that enough? Let go of the controller!"

"Huh? Oh, yes."

Ellie might have been in a mini-panic. When Aug told her to let go of the controller, she quickly spread her hands and released it.

"Whoa!"

I caught it quickly because dropping it from that height might have broken it.

"Oh, I'm sorry, Shin-san. I almost broke it."

"Oh, um, it's fine, no problem."

"But still... it's quite enjoyable, isn't it?"

"Huh?"

Even though she was clearly unable to control it properly... she found it fun?

"I mean, letting it run around freely like that gives a sense of exhilaration. Shin-san, may I also purchase one?"

"Oh, sure. That's fine, but..."

I hadn't expected her to express an intention to purchase one, so I looked at Aug, who seemed rather strained.

"...That's fine, but we should only use it once we've set up a dedicated track. Running it inside the castle could lead to accidents."

"Well then! Will you make a dedicated track for it? I'm looking forward to it from now on."

Ellie seemed unusually excited.

She must have really taken a liking to the Magicon Car...

Regardless of Aug, Ellie was truly unexpected. If the Crown Princess Consort enjoyed playing with it, it might become popular among the ladies too?

...Well, with her skills, it might be better to avoid showing it to everyone.

"Haha! Haha, cool!"

Seeing Ellie, who had let the Magicon Car go wild, Novak was still excited. What could have touched a chord with him like that?

I had no idea.

"Novak... you, uh..."

Even his sister, Viola, seemed to have no idea.

"Uhh, well, anyway, this is way beyond what I imagined. Let's release it immediately and see if it reveals any magical aptitude in the children."

"That's right. Should we also retest the children's magical aptitude?"

"We have to, or we won't have any way to verify it. Let's observe for a year and then retest."

And so, the Magicon Car and the children's hair dryer were approved for sale under the banner of the royal family's endorsement.

As a result, the Magicon Car and the children's hair dryer spread not only in Earlsheid but to all the surrounding countries in no time.

Now, I'm looking forward to seeing the results.nd a dish
