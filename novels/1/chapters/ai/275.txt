The sound of "karikari," "kashakasha," "karikari," and "kashakasha" echoes in the office.

The "karikari" sound is the noise of drafting documents with a pen.

The "kashakasha" sound is the noise of transcribing documents with a typewriter sold by the Bean Workshop.

The typewriter, funded by the government, was developed at an astonishing speed. Upon its release, it received massive orders from castles and trading companies worldwide.

It is said that office work is now impossible without it. Consumables such as paper tailored to the typewriter and typewriter ribbons are in high demand, keeping the production line in full operation.

Products other than metalwork, such as consumables, are commissioned from Uncle Tom's Hague Trading Company. Tom himself expresses gratitude for the substantial revenue generated through the sales.

While discussing in the office before deployment, listening to the now ubiquitous sound in offices worldwide,

"Is Tony's place due soon?"

When I ask, Tony's expression softens a bit.

"Yeah. It's scheduled for next month. Thor and Julius are also about ready, and there's a high chance the kids will be classmates, right?"

Yes, Tony is soon to marry Lilia. After graduating from the School of Economic Law, Lilia passed the bureaucratic exam for the Finance Bureau and became a financial bureaucrat.

Although they married relatively soon after graduation, they didn't have children right away, and Lilia became pregnant last year.

Currently, Arlsheid encourages women's social advancement, introducing maternity and childcare leave systems adopted by the Ultimate Magicians. There are still few examples, and Lilia seems to be a model case.

So, Lilia plans to return to work after maternity leave when it expires.

With that, it seems there's a need for the nationwide development of nurseries and kindergartens, and I am also consulted on that matter.

During casual conversation with Aug, I mentioned aspects of my previous life, such as the prevalence of dual-income households and discussions about nurseries and kindergartens. This led to a desire to introduce these practices in Arlsheid, and I was appointed as a consultant.

I'm serving as a consultant for the operation of fixed communication devices commonly installed in Arlsheid and households in various countries. There's no sign of getting free time anytime soon.

Technically, I should be working as the representative of the Ultimate Magicians, but I rarely go to the field, so I wonder which one is my main job?

"Isn't it about time for Shin and Mark? How are Cecily and Olivia doing now?"

"Oh, Olivia seems to be unwell today, so she's resting at home."

During Max's first pregnancy, Olivia couldn't stand the noise from the Bean Workshop and the smell of her parents' restaurant, so she took refuge in a different room. This time, with the second child, she's at Mark's house, and the issue seems to have resolved. However, being pregnant, there are days when she's not feeling well.

"By the way, Wolfo-kun, thanks for taking care of Max today."

Mark said with a slightly apologetic expression.

This morning, before going to work, Mark came to the house and left Max there. Even though there are parents at home, unfortunately, they can't be there today due to a gathering of the Chamber of Commerce. While there are houses like Mark's where you can leave your child, many others don't have that option. For such families, the prompt establishment of temporary childcare facilities is necessary.

...Why am I even thinking about social infrastructure?

With such a question in mind, I addressed Mark, who looked apologetic, not to worry.

"Yeah, it's totally fine. Shal also seems to have a playmate and looks happy. Today, Silver mentioned that they would go play at the castle together when he returns from the academy."

"A playmate for Princess Octavia? That's amazing. Maybe they'll be classmates of Her Royal Highness in the future?"

Shal, Via-chan, and Max are close in age, with birthdays approaching. Since infancy, they've been playing together, genuine childhood friends. Although Shal and Max are commoners, Shal, as Silver's sister, is treated as a target for protection, just like Silver. Max, now the heir to the largest workshop in Arlsheid, is likely to become a target for protection as well. As such, they plan to enroll in the Royal Arlsheid Elementary School attended by Aug and Mei-chan, and currently, Silver is also attending.

The academy, bearing the name of the country, is the most prestigious school in the nation.

The students attending here are from royal families, nobility, and affluent commoner families, so the security is quite tight.

Only those granted permission by the academy can enter or exit, and the citizen identification authentication system I developed is employed for management.

While the citizen ID authentication was previously only used for accessing personal information and bank accounts, it has now become applicable to other devices, enhancing its utility in security systems.

By presenting a pre-authenticated citizen ID, gates similar to those found on the platforms of train stations in my previous life open, allowing entry to the school.

This system is also adopted in the royal castle, and it has reportedly eased the morning congestion at the castle gates.

Incidentally, if there's a request from the royal family, we are allowed to enter the royal castle directly through the gate.

The justification for this is that it's for emergencies, as going through the entrance gate every time during urgent situations would be impractical. However, this is just a formality, and so far, the only request from the royal family has been Ellie's invitation for us to come and play.

Today, we're going to play at Ellie's request.

"Well, Oug and Ellie have known Shal and Max since they were babies. They know we're not giving them strange education, so they can trust us."

The nobility of Arlsheid, due to several generations of the royal family implementing a consciousness reform, mostly prioritize policies that favor the citizens and are aware of their own positions.

However, as seen in the past case of a noble daughter trying to eliminate Ellie, there are nobles who provide biased education.

Not everything goes as smoothly as ideal.

Finding a trustworthy playmate is also quite challenging.

"Were there no playmates like Thor and Julius?"

Come to think of it, Thor and Julius have been together as guards and attendants since before the five-year debut ceremony.

Does Via-chan not have such a companion?

"Is there a difference between a princess and a prince?"

"I wonder."

"It's a world we, commoners, don't understand."

By the way, all the male members currently stationed in the Ultimate Magicians are commoners.

There are things we just won't understand, even when commoners talk among themselves.

"Well, let's ask Aug about that another time. It's about time to go on the mission."

"Yeah."

"By the way, is Shin going out today, which is unusual?"

"Oh, yeah. Today, there's a request from a somewhat remote location. I'm the only one who can get there using levitation magic, so it's been a while since I went out on a mission."

"I see. Then, I'll go ahead on my own."

"I'll go too."

"Yeah, then I'll join as well."

And so, I headed to the field for the first time in a while.
