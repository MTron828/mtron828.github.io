"Hehe. Yes, I am pleased to see that His Highness' friendly relations are going well."

"Well... enough with the idle chatter; let's get on with it."

Augusto had just said that when suddenly, one of the individuals who had been cross-referencing magical sigil measurement devices stood up, toppling their chair.

Startled by the noise, Augusto interrupted his words and turned to the source of the sound.

In the hand of the person who had stood up were collected documents and the magical sigil measurement device collected from the scene.

"I found it."

The man who had risen said this softly and then, holding up the two magical sigil measurement devices, spoke again towards Augusto.

"I found it! It matches perfectly, Your Highness!"

"What?!"

"Is it true?"

As Augusto and Willer alternated shouting in disbelief, the man who had found the evidence hurried over to them.

"Yes! There's no mistake! This man's magical sigil perfectly matches with it!"

While saying this, the man handed over the investigative materials to the two of them.

Comparing the magical sigil measurement device attached to it with the one they had from the crime scene, the two of them exchanged glances.

"No doubt about it... it's him."

"Well done, Your Highness."

With the decisive evidence in hand, Willer was elated, believing they could now apprehend the culprit. Augusto, however, still had a difficult expression on his face.

"Your Highness?"

"We know who the perpetrator is now. The problem lies in what comes next."

"What do you mean?"

Just that question alone made it clear to Willer what Augusto meant.

"For now, let's head to this man's location."

"Yes, understood. Hey! All available investigators, come with us! Make sure he doesn't escape or harm himself!"

"Yes, sir!"

Following Willer's orders, the investigators, led by Augusto, left the investigation headquarters.

Their destination was...

The Mage Division.

"Excuse us."

Upon arriving at the Mage Division's barracks within the royal castle, Augusto ordered the investigators to wait in place while he and Willer proceeded alone.

It wouldn't do to storm in with a large group, as it would jeopardize the mission if the culprit managed to escape. So, they chose to visit with only a few people to keep their guard down.

They had come with only a few people to avoid drawing attention, but one of them was Prince Augusto.

The Mage Division's commander, Ruper Orglan, quickly arrived and addressed Augusto respectfully, despite his usual carefree demeanor. Orglan knelt before Augusto.

"Your Highness, you have honored us with your presence."

Seeing Orglan's display of respect, Augusto, while ensuring the matter wouldn't escalate, faced Orglan.

"Yes, I actually have something I'd like to ask you, Orglan. Would you mind lending me your ear?"

"Of course. What can I do for you?"

Orglan replied and stood up, moving closer to Augusto. Augusto also approached, leaning in to whisper discreetly.

"...We've identified the assailant from the attack on Ellie."

"What?!"

Orglan was momentarily at a loss for words at Augusto's revelation. Coming here after identifying the perpetrator implied that Augusto believed the assailant was within the Mage Division.

However, eyewitness testimonies were scarce, and those who had been affected by the approaching magic, including Elizabeth, the guards, and the maids, had their consciousness stolen, unable to get a proper look at the culprit.

So, how had they identified the assailant?

Augusto must have seen the doubt on Orglan's face, as he proceeded to explain the magical sigil measurement device.

"!! Such a device exists..."

"Yes, and over the past few days, I assume you conducted inspections to verify the magical power, correct?"

"Oh, yes, I did. But..."

"I apologize for the deceit, but I took the opportunity to measure the individual magical sigils during those inspections."

"Does that mean..."

By this point, Orglan had grasped the situation.

"Yes, the magical sigil collected at the crime scene perfectly matches the magical sigil of one of the Mage Division members."

"!!"

Orglan was left speechless in astonishment at Augusto's words. He hadn't anticipated that one of his subordinates could be involved in the attempted assassination of the prince's consort. Although shocked by this fact, Orglan eventually accepted it and once again knelt before Augusto.

"I apologize. This is all due to my inadequate supervision. I am willing to accept any punishment."

With a somber expression, Orglan made this confession, and Augusto responded without showing any change in his demeanor.

"That depends on the statement we get from the arrested suspect. Right now, we can't say much. But more importantly, where is this member, Daniel Flight?"

"Yes, please wait a moment."

Orglan said this and rushed into his office.

The Mage Division is a rather large organization. The head of the organization couldn't possibly keep track of every member's whereabouts, so he had gone to the office to check today's attendance records. Shortly after Orglan returned, he answered while looking at the records.

"Flight is on standby at the Mage Division barracks today. He's likely in the waiting room."

"I see. Orglan, please lead the way."

"Of course!"

Orglan said and began walking with Augusto through the Mage Division barracks. As they walked through the Mage Division barracks, members were surprised to see Orglan, the commander, leading Augusto and respectfully saluted from the side of the corridor. Augusto paid them little mind as he made his way towards the waiting room.

A few minutes later, Orglan stopped in front of a certain room.

"Is this it?"

"Yes, that's correct."

Orglan said and took a step back from the door. Instead, Augusto stepped forward, knocked on the waiting room door, and entered.

"Sorry for interrupting your standby duty. Please feel at ease."

Upon seeing Augusto, the members inside hurriedly knelt. Augusto gestured for them to rise. When they all lifted their heads, he approached the closest female member and addressed her.

"I'm sorry, but is there a member named Daniel Flight here?"

"Huh? D-Daniel?"

Augusto had asked the female member because it had been confirmed from the investigation materials that the perpetrator was male, and he wanted to avoid addressing the wrong person.

"Um, that would be him."

The flustered female member pointed at Daniel, using her gaze and finger to indicate his location. The member who was pointed at briefly startled and then quickly made a run for it.

"Don't let him escape!"

Upon witnessing this, Willer issued a command, and investigators stormed into the waiting room. However, Daniel's escape attempt was cut short as he was swiftly incapacitated by an electrical discharge and apprehended.

The electrical discharge was emitted by Augusto, and the members of the Mage Division present in the room were in awe, as they hadn't even sensed the magical power until just before the spell was cast. They were astonished at the use of an advanced electrical magic spell in that split second.

The investigators, who had entered with great enthusiasm but found themselves with no role to play, were briefly dumbfounded and then immediately composed themselves after looking at Augusto's expression. Initially, they had thought, "Do we even need to be here?" However, Augusto's demeanor was so intimidating that no one dared to voice any complaints.

"All right, we've captured him. Make sure to gag him, just in case."

"Yes!"

Following Augusto's command, the investigators put a gag on Daniel and, once it was secured, forcefully stood him up and dragged him in front of Augusto. Seeing Daniel still unable to move due to the lingering effects of the electrical shock, Augusto, with a cold and composed demeanor, leaned closer to him.

"We're going to have a little chat. We'll get everything out of you, including the person behind you... understood?"

As Augusto said this, Daniel momentarily widened his eyes, then slumped in resignation.

"Sorry for the disturbance, everyone. Our business here is finished. Please return to your duties."

With that, Augusto left the waiting room with Daniel.

In the waiting room after Augusto's departure, Mage Division members were discussing the recent capture.

"Hey, why was that Daniel guy taken away?"

"Even by Prince Augusto himself..."

"I wonder what he did?"

"More importantly, did you see His Highness' magic?"

"Yeah, I saw it. I couldn't even sense when he gathered magic power."

"Me neither..."

"Well, it was a low-power electrical shock to paralyze Daniel, I suppose..."

"So that's the magic of an Ultimate Magician..."

Initially, the conversation revolved around the captured Daniel, but in a place where magic users gathered, the discussion naturally shifted towards the magic used by Augusto. The capture of Daniel became less of a focal point.

Unexpectedly, Augusto had managed to avoid causing chaos at the scene, which was an unforeseen turn of events for him. And now, in the interrogation room where Augusto had brought Daniel, he sat across from him, staring intently, while Daniel's body remained immobilized due to the lingering effects of the shock. Though his body was numb and unresponsive, Daniel was conscious and felt overwhelmed by the wordless pressure.

As time passed and the numbness in Daniel's body faded, Augusto slowly began to speak.

"Now, do you know why you were captured?"

In response to Augusto's cold and chilling words, Daniel shivered to his core, but if he affirmed it here, he knew he wouldn't survive. So, he decided to play innocent.

"I don't understand. Why am I being treated like this?"

Upon hearing those words, Augusto exuded a deadly aura.

"Your Highness."

"I understand."

With a brief call from Willer, the aura dissipated immediately.

Daniel managed to maintain consciousness, but something was presented to him right in front of his eyes. He quickly realized that it was the device used during the recent magical inspection.

However, he couldn't fathom why it was being presented at this moment. Daniel must have appeared puzzled, prompting Augusto to explain further.

"This, you see, is a magical tool for individual magical identification."

"Huh?"

Daniel couldn't immediately grasp what Augusto had just said. The fact that citizen cards were used for individual magical identification was well-known, but the technology was considered too complex to be understood, let alone replicated. The fact that it had now been practically implemented and was right in front of him was beyond belief.

"I can see you find it hard to believe, but it's true. The prototype testing is already complete, and it's about to be deployed for practical use."

"I see."

However, Daniel still couldn't understand why this device was being shown to him here and now. Augusto's explanation continued.

"In fact, the person who developed this magical tool also conducted some other research out of curiosity."

"Other research...?"

"Yes. What do you think?"

To Augusto's question, Daniel couldn't offer an answer.

"Well... I really can't say."

Upon hearing this response, Augusto shook the measuring device in front of Daniel, as if to emphasize his point.

"You see, this magical tool not only identifies an individual's magical power, but it can also examine the residual magical power left after a spell is cast."

At the moment he heard those words, Daniel's spine went cold.

They can examine the residual magical power after a spell is cast.

Which means...

"This is the residual magical power collected right on the spot after Ellie was attacked," Augusto said, showing the measuring device.

"In this way, the magical pattern is perfectly recorded. And..."

As he said this, Augusto picked up another measuring device.

By this point, Daniel could understand. Those two devices...

"They are a perfect match."

Seeing two identical magical patterns recorded on the measuring devices, Daniel realized he had no way to escape. The evidence was now complete.

From this point on, no matter how he tried to explain, having physical evidence presented against him made it mere excuses. Understanding this, Daniel bowed his head and clenched his fists on his knees. Drops of water fell onto his clenched fists.

Observing his demeanor, Augusto sighed heavily and posed a new question to Daniel.

"Why did you attempt something so audacious? What's the reason for trying to harm Ellie?"

In response to this question, Daniel remained silent.

Or perhaps he couldn't answer. Sensing this, Augusto decided to change his approach.

"...Who asked you to do this?"

Upon hearing those words, Daniel suddenly raised his head, his face filled with more tears than before, and he began apologizing, rubbing his forehead against the interrogation room's desk.

"I-I'm so sorry! I'm really sorry!"

Seeing Daniel sobbing like this, Augusto cast a compassionate gaze upon him. However, he wasn't seeking apologies at this moment.

So, Augusto asked again.

"I'll ask again. Who asked you to do this?"

Despite being asked, Daniel still didn't say a word.

Based on Daniel's reaction a moment ago, it was evident that this wasn't solely Daniel's doing. Someone had commissioned him.

The attempted assassination of the Crown Princess was a major event.

If convicted, it would be a capital crime.

In such a situation, it's common to believe that testifying about someone who commissioned you, rather than taking sole responsibility, might lighten the punishment.

And yet, Daniel remained silent.

At that moment, Augusto realized the reason.

"...Are they holding someone hostage?"

Hearing those words, Daniel began sobbing uncontrollably.

"Willer, do not spread the news that we've arrested the assailant who attacked Ellie immediately. If the client learns that this person has been arrested, they might eliminate the hostage."

"Yes! Understood."

Willer relayed the orders to nearby security personnel and instructed those involved in the arrest and the mage division in the waiting room to maintain silence.

Once these orders were carried out, Augusto turned his attention back to Daniel.

"Now, you won't be exposed to your client anymore. Let's hear your story."

Following Augusto's words, Daniel finally spoke, relieving the burden he carried.

A name mentioned by Daniel that Augusto didn't recognize prompted him to instruct Willer to investigate. Meanwhile, Daniel was put in the custody of the security bureau for a while.

Based on Daniel's testimony, the hostage situation involved his own parents. While they weren't physically restrained, their house was constantly monitored by the client's henchmen. Any sign of betrayal from Daniel would lead to an immediate attack on his parents.

Given that Daniel's whereabouts were not restricted, Willer immediately headed to Daniel's home to protect his parents.

The individuals assigned to keep watch assumed that Daniel had betrayed them when they witnessed his parents being protected right before their eyes. They quickly departed to report this unexpected turn of events.

However, there was a reason behind Willer's actions. He knew that if he protected Daniel's parents right in front of the watchers, they would conclude that he was heading to report to the mastermind. In essence, they were the watchers of the watchers.

Willer's plan worked as expected, and the watchers eventually made their way to the mastermind's location. The moment they entered the building that served as the watchers' base, the investigative team made their move.

"Security Bureau! Surrender peacefully!"

The sudden entrance of the investigators left the watchers stunned.

"What!? Security Bureau?!"

They were caught completely off guard by the unexpected turn of events. Panicked, they tried to flee deeper into the room.

"Huh?"

And right there, they froze in place.

Of course, the investigators didn't let that opportunity slip by.

"Secure them!"

"Ugh!"

The guards who froze in front of the door were quickly overwhelmed by the investigators, and they were tied up in no time.

"Darn it!"

Bound securely with ropes, the guard couldn't help but curse.

Seeing the tied-up guard, the investigators asked about their previous behavior.

"Hey, why did you hesitate at the entrance to this room earlier? Is there something in this room?"

As the investigators questioned the guard, they looked inside the room the guard had attempted to enter, but there was nothing particularly surprising there. It was empty.

When they confirmed this, the investigators' faces turned pale.

No one was there.

This was supposed to be the base of the person who had threatened Daniel.

Naturally, they had assumed the mastermind would be here, but they couldn't find them.

The realization struck the guard into silence.

With this realization, an investigator grabbed the bound guard by the collar.

"Hey! Where's your boss?"

"I don't know! That bastard abandoned us and ran away!"

Upon hearing those words, the investigator quickly left the scene and took out a two-way radio device provided for the team.

"Director, this is the base assault team. We've protected Daniel's parents, and we've captured the guards at the base. However..."

"What happened?"

"The mastermind is not here! It seems they sensed something was wrong and left, abandoning the guards."

"What!?"

"Sorry! It's our failure!"

...

On the other side of the radio, Willer remained silent for a while before speaking.

"They were one step ahead, it seems. Well, it can't be helped. Did you secure the base, at least?"

"Yes."

"In that case, search the entire base meticulously. Don't miss anything."

"Understood!"

After ending the radio communication, the investigator returned to the tied-up guard.

"Listen here. You're going to tell us everything you know. If you try to give us false information, you understand the consequences, right?"

Under the pressure of the irritated investigators, the guard trembled and nodded repeatedly, affirming his understanding.

"Next, we'll conduct a search of this base! Summon a magician who can use extradimensional storage! We're taking everything!"

"Yes!"

And so, Daniel's parents, who had been taken as hostages, were safely rescued, and the perpetrator's base was secured.

Numerous pieces of evidence were collected, and the investigators returned to their headquarters.

Under the guise of a home search, they thoroughly examined the confiscated items brought back from the base, mobilizing all the investigators.

As a result of their efforts, it became clear that there was another mastermind involved.
