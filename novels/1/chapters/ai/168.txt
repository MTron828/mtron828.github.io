The day after the meeting with President Aaron and Ms. Shaolin, Sicily's special training began immediately.

Two days ago, we graduated from the Advanced Magic Academy, which finally allowed us to have time during weekdays in the daytime.

Until now, we could only find time after school or on the academy's holidays.

So, we promptly visited the treatment center where Sicily is being taken care of.

The treatment center attached to the church sees various people coming in â€“ those with injuries and those who are ill.

Normally, the priestesses of the Church of the Creator are stationed at the treatment center to provide treatment.

Among them, even injuries that could be life-threatening were somehow dealt with by the resident priestesses, thanks to the healing magic Sicily taught them, which I had taught her.

I proposed that it was strange to keep the technology to save people's lives a secret.

As a result, this technology spread to other treatment center priestesses, and Sicily became even more revered.

She's a bit embarrassed about it, though.

By the way, since it's known that this technique was passed on to Sicily from me, I was surprised to receive admiration as well.

I had thought that all the praise for this kind of medical work would go to Sicily.

Well, in any case, the reason we came to the treatment center today is not for the treatment of injuries.

It's for Sicily's special training.

When I explained the situation, the head of the treatment center agreed to allow patients who consented for the sole purpose of Sicily's training.

What we are about to do is essentially human experimentation, but surprisingly, most patients understood and consented willingly.

It seems there were many people, both young and old, who were willing to offer themselves for Sicily's skill improvement.

At that moment, I understood just how much Sicily is beloved by the people as a saint, and I was so happy I could cry.

Sicily herself was actually a little teary-eyed.

And so, our special training began.

The first patient to come in was a man who clearly seemed to have caught a cold.

Since Sicily can use body scanning magic, she began by examining the man's entire body.

Myself, Grandpa, Grandma, and the servants have been using body scanning magic when we are healthy, so we can tell the difference between healthy and unhealthy individuals.

As a result, we discovered that extremely tiny foreign objects had infiltrated the bodies.

Previously, as I did for Ms. Ekaterina, when I had purification magic applied to the blood, the man quickly recovered.

The man expressed excessive gratitude to Sicily and left.

After a few more patients like him, finally, a patient with a different issue appeared.

"Um... I've had a stomachache for a long time, and I can't bear it anymore."

A middle-aged woman uttered in pain.

Sicily immediately used her body scanning magic and, with a puzzled expression, talked to me.

"Shin, what's this?"

"What's wrong?"

"There's something unusual in her stomach. What is this?"

"Which one?"

Initially, I thought it might be gastritis or a stomach ulcer, but upon scanning, it turned out to be a tumor, not inflammation.

I'm not a medical expert, so I can't be sure, but if there is a tumor in the stomach causing pain and affecting the body's condition, it's probably correct.

"...It's this."

"!"

Sicily's reaction to my words was noticeable.

It was probably because this was the real deal for her training, and I had informed her that there was a high probability of fatality if I contracted the disease last time.

She became more serious, or rather, her expression became severe, like never before.

"Uh, what's wrong?"

I think it was because we suddenly had serious expressions.

The patient looked at us with an anxious expression.

I hesitated about whether to convey this, but we had come here today for training to treat this disease.

So, I gathered my courage and explained it to the patient.

"...We found a tumor in your abdomen. The reason we requested treatment for the sick today is to undergo special training to treat this disease. I assume you've already given your consent, but I'll ask again. Are you okay with Sicily treating you for her training?"

"Huh? Yes, it's okay, but... Am I really that sick?"

The patient's words momentarily left Sicily and me at a loss for words.

Should I say it or not...

I couldn't decide, so I decided to consult with the head of the center.

As a result, the patient was asked to be informed about the nature of the illness and what kind of treatment we intended to perform.

And also, what kind of treatment we intended to perform.

Upon hearing those words, I decided to inform the patient.

"Your illness, if left untreated, will undoubtedly be fatal."

"Huh..."

"There's a cellular division abnormality in your body... Um, an abnormal part has formed inside your body. The treatment we're going to perform now is to restore that abnormal part to normal."

"I see..."

The patient looked confused, so I hurriedly explained it in simpler terms.

However, the patient still seemed unclear, nodding vaguely.

Well, it couldn't be helped.

What was important was what came next.

"We will do our best. However... please be prepared for the worst."

When I said that, the patient was shocked and lowered their head.

That was to be expected.

They came to get their illness treated and received a death sentence instead.

After a while, the patient raised their head.

"I was lucky to come here today, right?"

"Huh?"

"Because, normally, the saint who treats injuries was here today, just for treating diseases. And the Demon Lord was here, too. I don't think there could be any greater luck."

Despite probably being full of anxiety, the patient said this with a smile.

"I understand. We'll do our best to make today a truly lucky day. Sicily."

"Yes!"

"Alright, I'll explain step by step. First..."

And so, I consciously explained the treatment method as clearly as possible to Sicily.

After numerous failures, and sometimes demonstrating the procedure myself, we continued the treatment.

"...The results of the reexamination show that the anomaly has disappeared. I'm sorry it took so long."

Sicily, although showing signs of exhaustion, managed to smile and inform the patient.

Finally, the treatment was successful.

"...It's true. All the physical discomfort I had is disappearing as if it was a lie!"

"That's great..."

The patient, happy to have their physical discomfort cured, and Sicily, relieved that the treatment went well, both breathed a sigh of relief.

Above all, it was fortunate that Sicily was able to learn the treatment method for this disease.

However, I have something important to convey to the patient.

"I'm glad we were able to treat you successfully. However, this illness has the potential to recur. If you experience any health issues in the future, please don't hesitate to come to the treatment center immediately."

"I-is that so?"

"Yes. Well, you may have realized it now, but treatment is possible. However, if you endure too much, and the condition progresses..."

"Understood! I'll come right away if I feel unwell!"

"Please do. Take care."

"You too."

"Yes, thank you very much."

I gave the patient a stern warning and sent them home.

Sicily then let out a deep sigh, unlike earlier.

"Whew... I'm relieved that we were able to treat them successfully..."

"That's true. But we shouldn't be complacent. If we find a few more patients with this illness, we'll treat them."

"Okay, understood."

"However, you must be tired from the previous treatment. Until the next patient arrives, I'll handle it, so take a break for a while."

"But... I..."

It's fine. Besides, isn't it almost Silver's lunchtime?"

"Oh! You're right! I'm sorry, Shin, I'll go take care of Silver."

Sicily said that and opened the gate, returning to our home.

I wonder if she gets a break from taking care of the child?

Still, without being told, responsible Sicily probably won't take a break.

After this, she'll continue with special training, so I want her to rest and recharge her energy.

Well, playing with Silver will likely rejuvenate her energy quickly.

And so, I took over after Sicily, conducting examinations and treatments.

Among the patients who entered the examination room, the disappointed expressions on the male patients' faces are probably something I won't forget in the near future.

I'm sorry, it's my fault.
