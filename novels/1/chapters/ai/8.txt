The day after the astonishing revelation that I hadn't been taught common sense in this world by my grandpa, we all gathered at a magical practice field in the wilderness where we were yesterday.

When we opened the "gate," everyone was so surprised that their jaws dropped.

Why did we come here? Because if you're as clueless as we are, you'd want to find out what kind of magic Grandpa taught us. That's what Dad said, and everyone else agreed, saying they wanted to see too.

"Hmm... just this magic alone is surprising, but to think we came all the way here to practice magic... I don't want to think about it too much."

"True, but Merida-sensei, we should confirm this because we don't know what kind of trouble Shin-kun might get into, so let's not give up and check."

... Grandpa and Uncle Dis are saying something rude. Oh well, let's not dwell on it. Let's go and watch with everyone.

And so, in addition to the "fire" magic I showed Grandpa yesterday, I used "water" to create a whip, froze it to shoot ice bullets, created a tsunami, used "wind" to create gales, vacuums, tornadoes, and downdrafts using pressure differences, generated electricity for lightning attacks, refracted "light" for optical camouflage, collected sunlight to shoot beams from the sky, created a super-hard wall using "earth," launched the surrounding soil like a barrage, and countered attackers by protruding conical stakes from the ground.

After demonstrating all the magic, I turned to everyone.

Everyone had a dry, resigned smile on their faces.

It's rare to see Chris-nē-chan with such a face.

As I was thinking that, Merida Grandma grabbed Grandpa.

"Merlin! Why... why didn't you teach this child to 'restrain' herself?!"

"Well, you see..."

"This is a bit much..."

Isn't everyone being a little too harsh?

"But, you know... I wanted to see how far they could go with what I taught them."

"What's with the 'they could go' part? That's creepy!"

Oh, Merida Grandma is really angry.

... Am I really exceptional?

"Moreover, admission to the Advanced Magic Academy starts at age fifteen. Don't you think it's a perfect opportunity for Shin, who hasn't interacted with peers of the same age so far, to make friends? Chris and Sieg are around the same age, so..."

Oh, Chris and Sieg are avoiding eye contact... and they started to glare at each other when their eyes met.

... So, I'm treated as "around the same age," huh?

"I see..."

"Indeed, Lord Merlin, you had a house in the royal capital, right? If Shin lives there, he can learn the common knowledge of the world, including how to handle money."

"Hmm... well, Shin."

"Hm? What is it?"

"I believe Lord Merlin has a point, and it seems like the best option. What do you say?"

Deceum? Who's that... Oh, right! It's Uncle Dis's real name!

"I'm fine with that. I'd like to try going to school, and I might make friends my age, right? I'm really looking forward to it because everyone is worried about me, but having friends my age and fooling around is something I want to experience."

"Alright, then I'll talk to the academy. However, formally, you'll need to take an entrance exam. Is that okay?"

"That's fine."

"I apologize. The class placement after admission is determined based on the entrance exam results, so there's no way around not taking the test. Our country's Advanced Magic Academy operates on a strict meritocracy that does not recognize the authority of nobles. I can't offer any conveniences."

"What happens if someone flaunts their noble authority?"

"They will be severely punished."

"Frightening!"

"Because it's an act of harvesting budding talented magicians, and it can be seen as an act of rebellion against the state. Shin, be careful too."

He said this with a smirk.

"I wouldn't do anything to cause trouble for my grandpa. But more importantly, what's with all this talk about 'our country' and having authority? Uncle Dis, who are you, really?"

I took this opportunity to ask something that had been on my mind.

"Oh, I forgot to mention it. My real name is 'Deceum von Arlsheid,' and I am the 'King' of the Arlsheid Kingdom."

... He's a king, of all things.

"So... what about Chris and Sieg?"

"I am a knight belonging to the Royal Guard, and I am here as His Majesty's bodyguard."

"I'm a mage belonging to the Royal Court Mage Division. I'm also His Majesty's bodyguard."

I didn't expect them to be the king's bodyguards.

"Wait a second, Chris-nē-chan may be one thing, but Sieg-nē-chan is lying!"

"Hold on! What's that about lying? Besides, Chris is one thing..."

"Haha, as expected, Shin has a discerning eye."

"What did you say, huh?"

"What is it? Hm?"

They started glaring at each other again.

"Never mind those two. Hey, Michelle-san?"

There's some commotion in the background, but let's leave that aside.

"I retired from the Knights a few years ago. Before retiring, I was the Captain of the Knights."

What? What's going on with all these important people from the kingdom?

"But why would a king like you come to visit my grandpa?"

"Hmm, even if you know I'm a king, you won't change your attitude?"

"Because I've known you since I was a kid. I've always thought of you as a distant uncle. So even if you tell me to change my attitude now, I can't do it."

"Hahaha, that's good. You're the only one who can have such a casual conversation with me. Please don't change."

He's quite an easygoing king.

"Alright, I understand. But why are you here?"

"Oh, right, I forgot. Shin, do you know the story of your grandfather, Lord Merlin, defeating a human-turned-demon, or rather, a demon, in the past?"

"Yeah, I've heard it from my grandpa. It's the story where several towns and villages disappeared, and the country was almost destroyed."

"Do you know the name of the country that was on the verge of destruction?"

"No, I haven't heard that... but..."

The flow of this conversation couldn't be...

"Yes, just as you suspected, it's our country."

"I see..."

"When I was still a student at the Advanced Magic Academy, a demon appeared in our country and destroyed a village. My father... the king at the time, and the upper echelons of the country were in a frenzy, repeatedly sending expeditionary forces only to be defeated each time. Finally, even the town was destroyed. The request for subjugation extended to young mages at the Magic Academy, and I joined the expedition team."

Can a prince do such a dangerous thing?

"Weren't you opposed to that?"

"Of course, there was strong opposition. By that time, I had already completed the Crown Prince ceremony and become the Crown Prince. But the pride of being an outstanding student in the merit-based Magic Academy didn't allow me to sit in a safe place while my friends were heading into danger. They were about to embark on a perilous journey, and I couldn't just stay safe."

Wow, Uncle Dis is really amazing.

"Oh..."

"But... fear still got the better of me. As the departure day approached, my friends couldn't sleep at night. Finally, we set out to face the demon. I still remember the despair of that time."

So, what happened?

"We, not just the students from the Magic Academy but even experienced warriors and mages, were overwhelmed by the demon. We were on the brink of giving up when..."

"Grandpa."

"And Merida-sensei appeared."

Wait, was Grandma there too?

"I'm an enchanter, so I'm more of a support role."

"That's still amazing."

"Is it really?"

Grandma seems a bit embarrassed. She's kind of cute.

"So, these two appeared, struggled but managed to defeat the demon in the end. They were admired by many for their valiant efforts. Merlin was facing the enemy with immense power, and Merida-sensei, with her enchanting appearance, wielded magical tools with grace. Many were inspired by their heroic actions."

Immensely powerful? Enchanting?

"Grandpa, Grandma..."

"You don't have to say anything. It was youthful folly..."

"What's that? I'm not finished yet."

Grandma...

"Anyway, they defeated the demon. Moreover, because I was there, I was recognized as a hero who saved the nation and even the Crown Prince, and I've been friends with Lord Merlin beyond our positions since then. This friendship continued even after my accession to the throne, and he still comes to me to listen to political grievances now and then."

I see...

"Grievances, huh?"

"Well, it comes with the job. Politics is my responsibility, even if I'm friends with Lord Merlin. I can't just shift that responsibility onto him."

Uncle Dis is really cool, as expected.

"So, in any case, you're the grandchild of someone who did us a great favor. I have no intention of using you for political or military purposes, so rest assured."

"Okay, got it. So when should I go?"

"Oh, there's an exam next month after the new year, so it would be appreciated if you could move to the royal capital before then."

So, I'll be moving to the royal capital. Grandpa will come with me because he needs to learn about societal norms.

It's a bit sad that Grandpa can't be apart from me, but I'm also a bit happy about it. I'm looking forward to the life waiting for me in the royal capital.

And finally, I asked about something that had been bothering me.

"By the way, Grandpa and Grandma used to be in the same party, right?"

As I said that, the atmosphere suddenly became awkward.

Huh? What's going on?

"Well, not just in the same party... but you two were married once, right?"

Chris-nē-chan dropped a massive bombshell.

"What?! No way!"

"Haha..."

"It was just a youthful mistake."
