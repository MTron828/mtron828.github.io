The day of the decisive battle, as designated by Strom, had finally arrived. In front of the wall built to contain catastrophic-level monsters, many people had gathered to challenge this battle.

Among them were knights and mages from various countries, each having trained extensively in preparation for this day. There were also the members of the "Og" group who had trained independently after failing to make a significant impact against Strom's faction of monsters in the previous battle. There was an elderly couple who seemed quite thrilled to be back on the battlefield after a while and Michelle.

Then there were Alice and Lynn, who had some fancy-looking magical girl outfits on.

"Hey, you magical girls."

"What is it!?"

"What's up with those outfits?"

"Are you kidding around even at a time like this?"

Previously, Mei had made matching outfits for Alice and Lynn, and the two of them had decided to wear them for this occasion.

"Are you still joking around at a time like this?"

"We're not joking around!"

"This is our strategy. The two of us will win."

"Both of you... I see, it's the helmet's communication feature."

Come to think of it, Mei had added something like a communication device to their helmets to make it easier for them to stay in contact.

"That's right! Lynn and I will defeat the monsters while staying in communication with each other!"

"This way, we'll be able to beat the monsters easily."

Well, they might indeed have excellent coordination using the communication device...

"Are you sure about it, Cutie Red? With those flashy outfits, won't the monsters target you?"

"Don't call me Red! It's fine; Lynn's got my back, and she'll inform me through the communicator."

"Hehe, it's a flawless plan."

I see, it was already accounted for.

But there's one more issue.

"Those outfits, unlike combat gear, don't have shorts, so your panties will be on full display, you know?"

Right, combat gear includes shorts to ensure that nothing distracts you during a battle. But Mei isn't going into combat, so she opted for a frilly mini skirt instead.

Alice and Lynn can now engage in combat with their jet boots, which means that with frilly mini skirts, everything underneath would be visible.

Getting distracted by that during a battle could put them at risk, which was why I warned them.

"Hehehe... that's covered too! I'm wearing shorts underneath!"

Alice said this and lifted the hem of her mini-skirt.

Indeed, she was wearing shorts underneath, but...

"Alice, you're daring. You're lifting your skirt like that in front of all these people."

"...Huh?"

As previously mentioned, there were soldiers from various countries gathered here. Not to be conceited, but we, who would be at the center of this decisive battle, naturally attracted attention.

"G-G..."

With Lynn's remark, Alice realized that everyone's eyes were on her.

"Gyaaaah!"

She let out a strange scream and hid behind Lynn.

"Haa... what are you doing before the battle..."

Ignoring Alice's self-inflicted embarrassment, I had another matter to check on.

"More importantly, why is Miranda here?"

At my words, Miranda flinched.

"I-It's probably inappropriate for me to be here, right?"

"Well, it's not that, but... why?"

"Th-That's... "

Certainly, Miranda was skilled enough to instruct the knights from various countries on how to use vibration swords. I had also heard that, thanks to Michelle's guidance, she had become the top-ranked student in the Knight Academy this year.

But Miranda was still a student.

Unlike us, who had special circumstances, she didn't need to participate in this decisive battle.

Yet, for some reason, she was standing alongside us, the Ultimate Magicians.

It's not unreasonable to question this.

"I brought her."

"Maria?"

As we were pondering this, Maria entered our conversation.

"It's my strategy. I can't activate multiple spells like Shin, and I can't build up enough attack power to defeat them in one blow in just a month. So I thought I'd use magic and have Miranda finish them off during the opening I create."

I see, that makes sense.

Maria, like Alice and Lynn, would also be fighting in pairs.

It's a good plan, but...

"Are you okay with this, Miranda?"

"Not really... I mean, this is a battle that risks the survival of humanity, right? The pressure is so intense I haven't been able to sleep properly for the past few days..."

"That's true..."

Even though she complained that simply instructing the knights from various countries on how to use vibration swords was stressful enough for her stomach, it was now a battle that staked the survival of humanity.

Moreover, teaming up with Maria meant that she would be constantly on the front lines. It's only natural that she couldn't sleep well.

"Are you okay, Miranda?"

Sicily asked Miranda, who mentioned that she hasn't been sleeping well, and gently cast a healing spell on her.

"Ugh... Thanks, Sicily."

"Sorry Maria pushed you into this."

"Hey, saying it like that makes it sound like I'm the bad guy!"

"I ended up like this because of you!"

"Don't worry, Miranda. With your skills, you're not likely to die easily."

"That's not the issue!"

"Maria, please don't say such things."

"Sicily, you're nice as always... Quite the opposite of Maria."

"What's that supposed to mean?"

"Hehe, how about it? Feeling better now?"

"Yeah, thanks."

"Now you can fight to your heart's content."

"...Huh?"

"Oh, and even if you get hurt, I'll heal you, so don't worry."

"Frightening! You're frightening, Sicily!"

"Huh?"

...They all seem so cheerful.

As I listened to the conversation of the three girls, Thor and Julius approached.

"It seems that we're all thinking alike."

"Does that mean you, Thor and Julius, are teaming up too?"

"We are."

"I see."

When I heard the details of the recent battle with the demons, they mentioned not being able to attack while defending against the demon's magic. Combining one person to block the demon's magic and another to attack seemed like an effective strategy.

"Come to think of it, I haven't checked what kind of countermeasures everyone has taken."

"Hey!"

But it's about to be the decisive battle, right!? Orge, even though he's about to confront the enemy, said he hadn't confirmed what kind of countermeasures everyone had taken.

Is it okay to be like this?

"I trusted everyone in this matter. I forgot to check."

"I'm glad you trust us, but you should still confirm."

"We're a team, but we fight individually. If we quickly confirm before it starts, it should be fine."

Certainly, the Ultimate Magicians were not fighting together as a team. But it's necessary to know what kind of battles each person will be fighting.

So Orge decided to confirm what kind of countermeasures everyone had taken before the battle begins.

"Thor and Julius, Corner and Hughes, and Messina and Wallace are all paired up. Does anyone else have a partner?"

"I'm not pairing up, but Sicily will be focusing on healing everyone, so she'll be near me most of the time."

"Yes. I might not be very useful in combat, but I'll do my best to heal everyone!"

A frontline healer.

This role requires a certain degree of combat ability, and Sicily is the perfect candidate. She has been studying healing magic at the clinic for a long time, and her healing magic ranks among the top in the world, not just in Earlsheid. With Sicily around, everyone can concentrate on the battle. My role is to protect them and defeat the demons.

"So, is everyone else going solo? Freid, what about you?"

"This is mine."

Saying so, Tony took out...

"Dual-wielding!?"

"I realized that one sword just isn't enough. I asked my dad to train me, and this sword is thin and lightweight."

I see, if you have only one sword, your attacks won't last long after they are defended. On the other hand, it's difficult to use magic while swinging a sword. The result is dual-wielding. I remember hearing that dual-wielding is not very practical, but Tony is using a vibration sword. It's a thin and lightweight sword, so it can be used with one hand. He takes advantage of that to dual-wield.

"I see, you've thought this through. This should be more than enough to handle the demons."

With Orge's approval, the next confirmation is...

"I'm using this."

Saying so, Yuri revealed a large number of staves hanging from her waist.

"Don't tell me all of these are magical instruments?"

"Yes, I asked the artisans at Bean Workshop to make a holster for me."

She showed the holster hanging from her waist. It had several small rings on the belt, and several short staffs were inserted into them.

I like this; it's so cool.

"Since I can't use multiple spells like you, Mr. Wolford, I use these staffs as substitutes."

"Hmm, with this many, it should be sufficient. Well done."

"Thank you."

Praised by Orge, Yuri looked pleased.

"Um, I'm not as strong as all of you, so I plan to focus on support."

"What kind of support are you going to provide, Stone?"

Next up is Olivia.

To be honest, I had expected her to team up with Mark, so it was surprising.

"I want to run around the battlefield and assist everyone in their fights. I don't think I can defeat those demons, but I can provide covering fire at least..."

I think that's modest, but having support fire from a sharpshooter on the battlefield is reassuring.

However...

"But, the battlefield will be chaotic, right? Will you be able to move to provide support?"

That's what I'm worried about.

But Olivia said it confidently.

"I'm good at moving around crowded restaurants! Plus, I'm good at identifying people who need help!"

I see, that makes sense.

Olivia's family runs a popular restaurant. As a waitress there, she's confident about moving around in a crowded restaurant. She probably takes the initiative to approach customers who seem to need assistance.

In a way, it might be the perfect role for Olivia.

"Now, what about Bean?"

"I'll fight with this."

She said, taking out a sword.

"What's this?"

"It's a magical tool. When I activate it..."

Oh, wow!

Magic enveloped the sword!

"It's a magic sword. I couldn't handle two at once, so I relied on a tool."

Amazing! A magic sword is so cool!

"I see, that's well thought out, but..."

"What's wrong?"

I was captivated by the magic sword that Mark had, and Orge was concerned about something else.

"Look, Shin is so excited. Bean, you might have done something amazing."

"Oh, yes..."

Wow! Orge aside, even Mark is looking like, "Oh no!" In fact, the fact that Orge still uses normal polite language is bothering me!

"Anyway, this is quite useful if Shin is so interested. Well done, Bean."

"Oh, thank you!"

He's as skillful as ever in making everyone feel good.

Finally, it's Orge himself. His strategy left everyone astonished.

"I have this."

He said and activated magic.

Fire magic on his 'right hand.'

"Left hand" with lightning magic.

He demonstrated simultaneous activation of magic.

"So, Your Highness! What's that!?"

Our reactions were like, "Wow," but the one who reacted the most was the Chief Mage, Olgran.

"Simultaneous magic activation, huh?"

"Th-that's just..."

"Hm? ... I see. I've seen Shin activate about three of them in parallel, so I thought this wouldn't be enough. So, you guys have astonishing skills."

Yes, it wasn't us but the members of the Mage Division and others who were astonished. Murmurs and exclamations could be heard here and there.

"Your Highness is amazing..."

"Your Highness is amazing, but the others too..."

"We can win with this... we can win!"

Someone nearby shouted that, and it triggered soldiers around to let out triumphant shouts.

"Heh, you managed to boost their morale effectively."

"When I heard that you hadn't confirmed our combat strength, I thought I might need to give you a lecture, even though you're the Crown Prince. But there was a hidden plan like this, huh?"

As the final battle against the demons approached, the morale on the side of humanity reached its peak.

Seeing this, the old man and the old lady praised Orge's leadership.

However, I didn't miss it.

When the old lady said she thought she might need to give him a lecture, sweat dripped from Orge's cheek.

... It couldn't be just a coincidence!
