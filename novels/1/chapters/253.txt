"By the way, how's the reputation of that guy?"

On a holiday a few days after delivering the magical sigil measuring device, listening devices, and recording materials to the security bureau, I asked Ogg, who had come to my house to hang out with Ellie, about the verification results at the security bureau.

These guys really come to my place every time they have a day off.

I wonder if the royal palace doesn't give them a break?

"Oh, the reputation from the security bureau is excellent. They are currently conducting verifications in various situations, but practical deployment should be coming soon. There's also talk of establishing a specialized department to handle it. I think we'll be receiving a large order for mass production soon."

"Oh, is that so? That's great."

A large order from the security bureau.

All I do is make magic stones, so Bean's workshop will get busy again.

As Ogg and I were having this conversation, Ellie joined in.

"Mr. Shin, the tools you make are truly useful. I've reevaluated them."

"What do you mean, huh?"

Why would she say something so disrespectful!

"Well, every time Mr. Shin makes something, Ogg and Thor make a fuss. I thought he was creating things that were beyond common sense, making a commotion in the world."

"That's not entirely wrong."

Wait a minute! Didn't Ogg already understand that I have memories from my previous life?

"Shin has memories from a different world, you know. It's understandable that there's a difference in common sense between that world and this one."

Oh, I see, so that's the understanding.

It's somewhat unavoidable that I have unconventional common sense.

"On the other hand, when it comes to magical tools in this world, I immediately think of combat tools, but Shin doesn't have that concept. It seems to have been a peaceful country in his previous world."

"Is that so? Um, what kind of things has Mr. Shin made until now..."

"The first thing that comes to mind is a communication device."

In response to Ogg's words, as Ellie tried to recall the things I had made so far, Sisley responded first.

"That's right. It's so convenient that life without it is almost unimaginable."

Both Ellie and Sisley nodded in agreement.

"And there's also the hairdryer with a brush and the hair iron. We use them every morning."

Originally, I made those two as birthday presents for Sisley and Maria, but Ellie's enthusiasm was incredible.

Now, she purchases the improved versions every time they come out.

Thank you very much, as always.

"Oh, and there's that too!"

"That? What is it?"

"What's that?"

It seems Ellie has remembered something, but she only refers to it as "that" without mentioning the product name.

What could that "that" be that she's mentioning loudly?

"Well, it's, uh... the... the bathroom..."

"Ah!"

A toilet seat with a bidet function.

Come to think of it, that was the first magical device I introduced to everyone.

Now it's being sold by the Walford Trading Company, and it has become commonplace throughout the country, so it's not as novel as it used to be.

Is that why it didn't come to mind immediately?

"Well, there are other things too, but everything Shin has made so far is non-combat magical tools. The only exception is the Vibration Sword."

"...Ah, that's true. It's definitely a lot of non-combat magical tools."

With Ogg's explanation, Ellie finally seemed to understand.

"In the previous world, even owning a small knife as a weapon was illegal. So the idea of having tools to attack something didn't really come to mind."

"I see. So, was Shin's previous world a conflict-free world?"

"No, it was just the country I was in. In other countries, they sold cheap weapons that could easily harm or kill people."

"Come to think of it, you mentioned that information was more accessible in your previous world. Is that why magic has a high lethality here?"

"Well, that might be a factor, but the biggest one is probably fiction."

"Fiction?"

All three of them tilted their heads in confusion.

"You know, like the novels Ellie used to read. In my previous world, magic was purely imaginary, but in fiction, it's quite popular."

I guess the desire to use it in fiction when you can't use it in reality is understandable.

Well, it's not just novels and manga; I'm sure games had a big influence too.

"In my previous life, magic was nothing more than a product of imagination. So being reborn in this world where I can use magic was a lot of fun."

"I see. So, that's why you developed magic out of curiosity?"

"Yeah, that's right..."

Since their conversation naturally flowed, I responded as usual, but the people here now are not just the three of us.

I turned around nervously, and there were Grandma and Grandpa.

"What on earth! Even if you didn't know, using magic so casually in front of a child like that..."

"Ho ho. Well, he's not learning magic one after another. He gets absorbed in what he likes."

As the two said, I had the best role models in Grandpa and Grandma.

Well, this was also the starting point for the misunderstanding that this was the normal magic in this world.

"Your knowledge of fiction from your previous life and the best role models, huh. It makes sense why Shin has turned out this way."

Sisley said that with a smile... Wait, is that a compliment?

"By the way, Shin, are the creations you make all related to using magic?"

"Hmm? Oh, it's true that the ones that sell well are mostly related to that, but of course, there are other things too."

"Like what, for example?"

"Let's see... there are pure literature novels, romance novels like the one Ellie was reading the other day, detective novels, and historical novels... Oh, and there's horror novels."

"H-Horror!?"

While listing them one by one, Ellie reacted with a loud voice to the mention of horror novels.

However, from Ellie's expression, it was clear that she didn't react because she was interested in the genre but because she found it scary.

"W-Why would there be a genre like that!?"

"Huh? There's horror novels here too, right?"

"Yes, there are! But why would anyone willingly want to experience something scary!!"

I could hear the scream from the depths of Ellie's soul.

Ah, she really doesn't like it.

"Uh, well, right! Shin, what's the mainstream in romance novels?"

Perhaps in consideration of the teary-eyed Ellie, Sisley tried her best to change the topic.

Ellie is in the early stages of pregnancy, and it's best not to make her emotionally unstable. So, I decided to go along with Sisley's topic change.

However, the mainstream in romance novels?

"Um... Oh, right... Oh! There are stories similar to the one Ellie was reading the other day."

"Is it about love between people of different social statuses?"

"That's right. Oh, and there are derivative patterns."

"Derivative patterns?"

"That's right. The one Ellie was reading, the protagonist is a commoner girl, right?"

"Yes, that's right."

"In the derivative pattern, the protagonist is the fiancée's daughter."

When I said that, Ellie tilted her head.

"Does that... make sense as a story?"

"It wouldn't work in the novels Ellie is reading, I suppose. Rather, the pattern is one where there's nothing wrong with the fiancée's daughter, and the problem lies with the man and the lower-class woman. Initially, the man and his mistress degrade the woman, break off the engagement, but then a higher-class man rescues her, and they get engaged again."

"I see."

"And, the classic is the pattern where the cheating man and woman face judgment in the end."

"Judgment, you say. What's that like?"

"That varies greatly. You could say there are as many stories as there are patterns of this type."

"I see."

And then, I remembered something.

"By the way, there's something I wanted to ask Ogg."

"What is it?"

"I heard from Sisley and Ellie that there were some incidents with other girls during your middle school days?"

"Don't phrase it in a way that creates misunderstandings! The incidents were mostly with Ellie, and I just helped resolve them!"

Oh, right. The way I phrased it makes it sound like Ogg had incidents with girls other than Ellie.

"Geez. Anyway, Ellie, did you talk about that matter?"

"Well, no. I only talked about it in detail."

"It came up naturally in the conversation... I was finding it hard to talk about it, so Sisley talked about it on my behalf."

"I see. Well, it can't be helped. Anyway, what's the big deal about it?"

"Oh, well, it reminded me of something. I was wondering what happened to that girl in the end."

When I said that, Ogg seemed to be trying to recall the events from that time. He closed his eyes, thought for a moment, and then spoke.

"The school headmistress at the time handed down an expulsion for causing disruptions in the academy."

"Huh!? Just for that!?"

What that girl did was just getting carried away with a delusion that she was dating Ogg, right?

When I mentioned this, Ogg spoke as if it were nothing.

"It's a trivial matter within the school, but the countess's daughter confronted the duchess's daughter. Unlike the Royal Academy, where it's a complete meritocracy, the Royal Academy clearly emphasizes social status differences."

Come to think of it, that's how it was.

Arsehide Advanced Magic Academy is completely merit-based.

Even if you're a royal, there's no favoritism.

As proof of that, in the entrance exam, I, a commoner, ranked first, and Ogg, a royal, ranked second.

This merit-based system applied to school life as well, and nobles using their power to oppress commoners was strictly prohibited.

This was to ensure that the talented commoner magic users had a chance to flourish.

"By any chance, is the Knight Academy the same?"

I asked this question to Miranda, who was standing upright behind Sisley.

"Yeah, it's the same as the Advanced Magic Academy. They said it's to discover talented individuals regardless of their social status."

"The Commercial Academy is the same."

"Oh, really, the specialized advanced academies are like that?"

"Well, yeah. To put it bluntly, only 'that' is like that."

"Just 'that'? Does that mean the others are different?"

When I said that, Ogg looked exasperated.

"Of course! What do you think the social hierarchy is for?"

"Huh? But isn't the social hierarchy in Arsehide pretty loose?"

After all, there's a former viscount's daughter, a former duke's daughter, the crown prince, and the crown princess, all gathered in a commoner's house.

Then, Ogg seemed somewhat deflated.

"This house... or rather, the Wolfort family and its surroundings are the exception. Lord Merlin and Lady Merida are the king's mentors, and you have the power to potentially rule the world. Complaining about disrespect at this point is meaningless."

After saying this, Ogg looked at me and added, "Besides."

"Aren't I your cousin?"

He said with a grin.

"O-Oh, right, that's true."

I've been thinking of Ogg as my cousin ever since I heard that my distant uncle had a child, even though it was quite a while ago.

I had completely forgotten about it.

As I felt embarrassed by the sudden reminder, I noticed that Ellie was glaring at us with an icy stare.

"Ogg... are you cheating on your wife during her pregnancy?"

"Shin, is that true?"

"Who's talking about cheating!!"

Ellie aside, Sisley was joking, right!?

"It's just a joke."

"Hehe, it's just a joke."

Ellie said with a straight face, and Sisley said with a smile.

Hah... Please, let's not joke about that.

By the way, how did we end up having this conversation?

"Oh, by the way, is that noble girl alright?"

"Alright? What do you mean?"

"Well, she was infatuated with Ogg to the point of confronting Ellie, who is a Duke's daughter. Isn't she holding a grudge against Ellie or something?"

When I said that, Ogg chuckled.

"Ever since that incident, her family, the earl's house, has fallen from grace. Even if a girl from such a family holds a grudge, it won't amount to much."

Ogg said confidently.

In the office of a certain noble's mansion, there was a young lady. She seemed very agitated, pacing around the room in rough, uncharacteristic strides while biting her nails.

"Natalie, calm down a little,"

Natalie, the young lady who was reprimanded by her father in the office, shot an angry look at her father with her eyes filled with rage.

"Calm down!? How can you ask me to calm down, Father!? How can you expect me to remain calm in this situation!?"

Natalie retorted with a fierce tone in response to her father's words.

"Why? Why is that detestable vixen still occupying the position of the Crown Prince's wife? Wasn't she supposed to step down from the position immediately?"

Hearing those words, her father frowned as well.

"Well... maybe I was deceived. Perhaps that merchant had a hand in it..."

Upon her father's words, Natalie's anger flared up even more.

"Surely that merchant and that vile vixen are colluding! How despicable!"

After saying those words, Natalie dramatically sighed.

"Oh, poor August! He must have been deceived by that vile vixen, tricked and driven to madness! Please wait, I will definitely rescue him! Our future, where I save him from Elizabeth and become his partner, is within sight!"

As she exclaimed, a look of ecstasy crossed Natalie's face, as if she envisioned a future where she rescued August from Elizabeth and became his wife.

Her father, observing his daughter in such a state, had a pitying expression on his face.

"Oh, poor Natalie. It seems His Highness really lacks discernment when it comes to women. He leaves behind someone as cute as you to marry a Duke's daughter."

"Father! Father! You must not insult August! His clouded judgment is not his own fault; he's been deceived by that vixen!"

"I see... I see."

"But, more importantly, we need to find a replacement for that useless merchant."

"Useless? That's a strong word."

As Natalie began to contemplate her next move, her train of thought was interrupted by a voice. A man entered the office.

"You... How dare you show your face here!"

The man who entered the room was the merchant who had proposed a business deal to Count Doville. He boldly stood before them, ignoring the count's stern tone.

"Well, it seems that the Crown Princess may have a rather peculiar constitution."

"Don't you dare refer to that woman as the Crown Princess!"

"A peculiar constitution? What do you mean?"

Ignoring Natalie's fury, the merchant answered Count Doville.

"I managed to introduce non-lethal poison into the Crown Princess's meals. It's something that wouldn't harm a regular person but has a high chance of causing a miscarriage if ingested by a pregnant woman."

The proposal the merchant had presented to Count Doville was to introduce non-lethal poison into Elizabeth's meals, causing a miscarriage. If successful, it could not only result in Elizabeth losing her child but also pose a significant risk to her life. If she survived, she might become unable to bear children in the future. In that case, she would be unfit to hold the position of the Crown Prince's wife, which was her duty. The vacant seat could then be offered to the Count's daughter.

In normal circumstances, even if the plan succeeded, Natalie, who had antagonized Elizabeth and earned the Crown Prince's displeasure, had almost no chance of becoming the next Crown Princess. However, Count Doville, a foolish father who doted on his foolish daughter, would undoubtedly support such a proposal. The merchant anticipated this and offered the proposal. Count Doville accepted it as planned. The merchant had requested Count Doville's assistance in obtaining the poison because, as a foreign merchant with no influence in Earlsheid, he had no means of acquiring such a special poison in the country. Using all his remaining connections, Count Doville obtained the poison and handed it over to the merchant.

Furthermore, the poison was not deadly; it was tasteless and odorless. This made it impossible for the tasters to detect the poison. The symptoms of ingesting the poison were similar to a severe cold. The taster concluded that the poison was present because they had to take a day off from work due to cold-like symptoms. However, Elizabeth showed no signs of illness. They repeated the testing multiple times, but Elizabeth remained unaffected. In return, the taster had to take multiple days off due to feigned illnesses, which was becoming increasingly suspicious. The situation was reported as such.

Upon hearing this report, Count Doville fell silent, crossing his arms and wearing a stern expression. However, Natalie couldn't stay silent.

"The poison doesn't affect her... Is she arrogant even with her body's constitution!? That vixen!"

Natalie muttered something while biting her nails and began pacing around the office.

"Well, that's why I came. We need to think of our next move soon. This is how things stand," the merchant explained, but Count Doville remained wordless.

No, he wasn't just silent. To discreetly harm and remove the threat from around Elizabeth without arousing suspicion, her current pregnancy was a golden opportunity. However, if the poison didn't work, there was little they could do. Even if they discussed the next steps, devising a method to harm the royal family wouldn't come to mind immediately. Should they give up?

But they couldn't just sadden Natalie...

Count Doville was lost in thought, but in the next moment, his contemplation was interrupted.

"That's it! It's because we're being so complicated that it's not working!"

Natalie suddenly shouted, then turned to her father and the merchant with a wide smile.

A few days later, the people of the capital city were astonished when news broke of an incident involving a high-profile victim.

It was the Crown Princess, Elizabeth, who had been attacked.
