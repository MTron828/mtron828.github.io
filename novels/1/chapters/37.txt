After staying overnight in another town along the way, I finally arrived in the town that was the Claude family's estate, my destination.

It was quite a hassle in the town where I stayed overnight on the way. After all, a member of the royal family and a renowned hero were staying there. Due to concerns about causing a disturbance in a regular inn, I had no choice but to book the best inn in that town.

The governor who governed that town had offered to invite me to his mansion, but I declined due to the private nature of my journey and the impact of hosting a member of the royal family.

I had tried to keep my identity low-key, but somehow, word got out, and there was a huge crowd in front of the inn. Thanks to this, despite coming to a different town, I couldn't leave the inn at all.

Well, being called the best inn in town, they didn't allow anyone other than staff and guests inside the building. They had even rented out the entire top floor and had security guards stationed at the staircase to protect the guests.

Receiving such special treatment was a bit nice, but it also felt a bit restrictive...

After that one-night stay, I arrived in the town ruled by Sicily's father, known as "Claude's Town." Basically, the name of the noble who governs a place becomes the name of the town for clarity and to instill pride and responsibility in the governing noble.

Claude's Town is known for its hot springs, and steam rises from various places in the town. As soon as you enter through the town's gate, there are public bathhouses and inns that anyone can use, while the general residents live a bit further into the town.

The lord's mansion is located deep within the town, with the back side facing the mountain, making it difficult for intruders to enter from that side.

When I showed my citizen's identification at the town's entrance, it seemed that news of my arrival had already spread, and I was met by the lord's daughter and a procession of royal heroes and special individuals. But they didn't seem particularly surprised. Instead, there was an atmosphere of relief that I had arrived safely.

Well, it's understandable; it would be quite a predicament if something were to happen. Though, with this group, it's unlikely that anything would go wrong...

And right away, they sent a messenger to the lord's mansion. Normally, carriages would only go to the carriage station, but they offered to take us all the way to the lord's mansion as a special service.

"Welcome back, Miss Sicily," they said, and the servants, who had been forewarned, welcomed us with open arms.

I'm back, Miss Sicily. And welcome, Your Highness Augustus. Additionally, it's an honor to meet the Wise One, the Reverend, and all your fellow students. And the new hero, Mr. Shin.

Perhaps, instead of Sicily's father, the deputy in charge of this place greeted everyone and then looked at me.

What's going on?

"We have been eagerly awaiting your arrival. Please make yourselves comfortable."

"Thank you."

All the servants bowed their heads to me. What's going on here?

"Come on, everyone, you're being overly dramatic!"

"But, Miss Sicily, it's only natural to greet someone who will be a part of our future."

"What are you talking about?"

Sicily was in a state of panic. It's quite unusual to see her like this.

As I watched her with a smile, she glanced in my direction.

"Why are you laughing?"

"Well, Sicily, you raising your voice and panicking like that is quite rare, so..."

"Oh... that's enough!"

"Haha, sorry, sorry. There, cheer up."

I stroked Sicily's head as she blushed and had teary eyes, and she gradually calmed down.

"Ugh... there's no helping it."

"It's just that your panicked appearance is cute, that's all. Sorry?"

"Cute..."

Oh, she's blushing again.

I suddenly felt someone's gaze, so I looked around, and not just the members of the research group but also the servants were all grinning.

"What's going on?"

"Well, they probably think you're still being lovey-dovey."

"Haha, you've been doing this throughout the training, right? People say you're always so affectionate."

"Yeah, it's embarrassing to do it in front of male students with a nine-to-one male-to-female ratio..."

"Miss, you still need to greet properly."

"Ugh."

Sicily turned even redder and hid behind me.

Since Sicily seemed unable to recover for a while, the deputy in charge began to continue with the conversation.

"I am Camille Brandley, serving as the deputy in charge of this area on behalf of Lord Cecil. While I am not living in this mansion, I will entrust your care to the servants."

"Eh? You don't live here?"

"This is the residence of Viscount Claude. I am only here for official business. I do not enter the residential area."

I see, I thought he lived here.

"Your Highness Augustus, welcome as well."

"Yes, but I want to emphasize that I came here this time solely for the research group's training camp, so there's no need for hospitality."

"I understand. It was a wise decision to accompany the hero as a guardian this time."

Huh? Why?

I must have had a confused look on my face because Aug explained it to me.

"Since I am of royal blood, some people may say various things if I personally visit a noble's mansion."

"I know that, but why is it a good decision to bring Grandpa and Grandma with me?"

"In this country, the fame of Lord Merlin and Lady Merida is significant. When it's known that the two of them accompanied as guardians, people won't say, 'The prince visited a noble's mansion,' but rather, 'The Wise One and the Reverend accompanied as guardians for their grandchild's research camp. It seems the prince is also among them.' The impression is different."

The content is the same, but the impression is different. Did Grandpa and Grandma calculate this and volunteered to be guardians?

Thinking that, I looked at the two of them, and both of them averted their gaze.

...It's just a coincidence, huh?

Afterward, the other members introduced themselves, and since everyone was tired from the long journey, they decided to take a bath in the hot springs and relax, with activities starting tomorrow.

Sicily was still blushing, but she managed to recover and took the female members to their rooms and the hot springs.

As for us male members, an elderly maid guided us.

Each of us was given a private room, and Grandpa and Grandma shared a room.

And now, it's time for the hot springs.

Well, it's not that unusual to take a bath in a regular world with public baths. Besides, my body is still young, so I don't have a strong desire to soak in hot springs to relieve fatigue.

But I wanted to bring Grandpa and Grandma here since there was a hot spring. That would make them happy.

The hot spring was inside the mansion. Even the regular baths in this mansion were hot springs. How luxurious! Is this one of the privileges of a hot spring town?

Since they often host guests, the hot springs were separate for men and women. It really is a traditional hot spring inn.

And when we all undressed and entered the bath...

"It's huge!"

Yes, I thought my home's bath was spacious, but this was even more so. There were two separate baths for men and women... The Claude Viscount family really means business!

"Oh, this is amazing."

"I've never been in such an incredible bath!"

"It's larger than my own mansion."

"Our place is even bigger."

"Well, if we're going to talk about it, our place is a public bath..."

Tony's place is a public bath. It's not particularly unusual, and having a bath at home is more unusual.

Well, Mark's place is a workshop, so he probably built the bath himself.

And as for Grandpa, he seemed very pleased with the hot spring.

"This is quite something. I never imagined I'd get to bathe in a hot spring like this."

With a broad smile on his face, he washed himself and sank into the bath.

"Ah, it's rejuvenating..."

"Phew, it feels so good..."

After the long journey by carriage, it seemed that fatigue had accumulated, and it was as if the fatigue was being drawn out of the body. Everyone seemed to feel the same.

"Ah, this is nice..."

"Yes, it is..."

"It's really pleasant..."

"I might fall asleep..."

"You'd die if you fell asleep, you know?"

Each of them seemed to be enjoying the hot spring.

After enjoying the hot spring for a while, Grandpa suddenly started talking.

"Thank you, everyone, for accompanying Shin."

"Huh? Wise One?"

"This child, he has been living in the deep mountains for a long time, and he doesn't have any friends of the same age."

Everyone listened attentively to Grandpa's words.

"From a young age, he had an extraordinary memory. As I taught him various things, he grew up, and I never noticed how quickly he became an adult."

Huh? Was he not paying attention?

"Since I realized that, I've been feeling sorry for him... Hoping he would make friends at the academy."

I see, so he came to the royal capital with me, knowing it would attract attention, out of a sense of guilt...

"So, having made friends like this as soon as he entered the academy, I am truly grateful. Thank you, everyone."

With these words, Grandpa bowed to everyone.

"Please stop it, Lord Merlin. Rather, I should be the one to express thanks and apologies."

Augustus replied.

"That child, having lived in the mountains for so long, never had a friend of the same age."

Everyone listened to him intently.

"From a young age, he had an extraordinary memory. As I taught him various things, he grew up, and I never noticed how quickly he became an adult."

Huh? Was he not paying attention either?

"Since I realized that, I've been feeling sorry for him... Hoping he would make friends at the academy."

I see, so he came to the royal capital with me, knowing it would attract attention, out of a sense of guilt...

"So, having made friends like this as soon as he entered the academy, I am truly grateful. Thank you, everyone."

Grandpa said, bowing to everyone.

"I am the first prince of this country. I had never had any equal friends, and I had resigned myself to my position. However, Shin treated me as an equal, saying that I was like a cousin to him. It was an unexpectedly joyful experience for me."

Oh, I've never heard Aug's true feelings before.

"And now, I'm relying on Shin's kindness to create the power needed to deal with the current situation. I know that it's a dangerous path and that it will involve Shin. I feel extremely sorry about that, especially towards Lord Merlin and Lady Merida, who are trying to protect Shin. I apologize."

I'm the one who's doing this on my own. In fact, I feel guilty for making them clean up my mess.

"Well, don't worry about it. I've heard about it from Diseum. They say that it's not to use that power for the kingdom's selfish interests, and after it's over, it will be used for the peace of the world."

Even Uncle Dis knows about this. It's really become a national project.

"I'm sorry for making you worry like this, but if possible, I want you to continue being friends with Shin as usual."

"Of course, for me, he's the first friend I've been able to interact with without hesitation... no, he's like a cousin."

The others nodded at his words.

"We've been so indebted to you, Walford. If it's okay with you, I hope we can continue to be friends!"

"While it can be exasperating to be with Shin, it's also fun, so I would appreciate it if you would take care of me."

"I'm the same. I'm often seen with a strange gaze by other nobles, but Shin treats me normally. I'm really happy about that."

"Yeah, Shin doesn't judge people based on their background or anything like that. He doesn't say things like 'You're too carefree.' He likes girls, but having male friends is also nice."

Everyone said that.

"Is that so? I've been feeling sorry because I thought I caused trouble for all of you by doing what I thought was right..."

"You did what you thought was right, didn't you? We don't have any complaints about that. Rather, we're grateful that you've raised us from ordinary people to a group that saves the world."

"Really?"

"I'm a guy, after all, so I have a hero complex too."

Everyone nodded in agreement with Thor's words.

"Well, Thor, you're more like a boy than a guy."

"Don't say that! I care about it!"

Everyone is laughing. I'm really blessed with great friends.

"Grandpa."

"What is it?"

"I'm grateful, you know, for all the training you've given me. If I hadn't stayed in the mountains all that time and ventured into town, I probably wouldn't be here now. So, don't worry too much. Thanks to that, I've made so many friends."

"Shin..."

"Thank you, Grandpa."

"Ugh..."

Oh, Grandpa is crying again. marketing strategies
