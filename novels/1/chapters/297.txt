Now, there's something I need to talk to all of you about first. In this academy, there are students from various backgrounds, including royalty, nobility, and commoners. While we can't completely forget about our social statuses, we must not use them to look down on others. Furthermore, we shouldn't take advantage of our status in a negative way. Do you understand?

Catreia's words seemed challenging to the new first-year students, and they all tilted their heads in confusion.

While understanding their confusion, Catreia gave examples to clarify her point.

"For instance, children with higher titles should not look down on or act arrogantly towards those with lower titles or commoner children. Allowing this behavior would make commoner children feel powerless, like slaves to the noble children, right?"

The students nodded in agreement with Catreia's words.

"So, especially those from noble families, please be careful. Everyone is fellow students at the same academy."

In response to her words, Octavia, the highest-ranking royal in the class, agreed, saying, "Understood."

With Octavia's agreement, other noble children also voiced their agreement one by one.

Watching this, the commoner children breathed a sigh of relief.

Observing the commoner children, Catreia spoke once more.

"On the other hand, that doesn't mean children with lower status can be rude to those with higher status. Allowing such behavior would leave the higher-status children with no way to respond, right?"

Catreia said this, and one of the students shouted, "Oh, I know!"

It was Charlotte.

"In this academy, we're all supposed to be equal, right? So why discriminate against commoners? That's so mean!"

For some reason, Charlotte had a peculiar way of speaking, drawing out the end of her sentences, and it annoyed the others, making them giggle.

"Yes, yes, it's a scene you often see in stories, isn't it? You're quite familiar with it, aren't you?"

"I saw it in a play I went to with my dad the other day! People call the one acting like a heroine 'Hyde-in' or something like that!"

The classroom erupted in laughter in response to Charlotte's words.

"That's a good point. That's right. In other words, children with lower status should respect those with higher status, and children with higher status should protect those with lower status. In essence, let's all get along, okay? Do you understand?"

When Catreia said this, the children responded with a resounding "Yes!"

Thanks to Charlotte's earlier comment that had lightened the mood with laughter, the tension in the room seemed to have eased considerably.

"Now, let's wrap things up after everyone's self-introductions. Please go ahead in order."

And so, the children's self-introductions began. Introducing an entire class of students involved a considerable number of individuals, making it impossible to remember all of them at once. Most of the time, you'd only develop a vague awareness of who's who.

However, amidst it all, some children stood out and managed to have their faces and names remembered in one go.

"I'm Octavia von Arlsheid. My father is Crown Prince Augustus. But I have many commoner friends, so I'd appreciate it if you all could get along as well."

The fact that Octavia, the firstborn of Crown Prince Augustus of the Arlsheid Kingdom, didn't need to introduce herself; everyone knew who she was.

The classmates who had become friends with this royal princess were surprised by the number of commoner friends she had, but at the same time, they saw hope in it. If commoners could become friends with her, maybe they could be friends with her as well?

Particularly among the boys, the hope arose that if they became close to Octavia, they might secure a future position as a royal spouse.

"I'm Max Bein. We run a workshop called Bein Workshop. If you'd like, feel free to come shopping with your parents!"

Max's self-introduction caused a stir as well.

After the incident in the morning, they were aware of his close relationship with Princess Octavia. However, with the exception of Mark and Olivia, their classmates didn't recognize his face.

So, they were wondering which child he might be.

It turns out he was from Bein Workshop.

Bein Workshop was a major workshop, known to all the citizens of the capital, with deep ties to the Ultimate Magicians' representatives, including Shin. Furthermore, both of his parents were members of the Ultimate Magicians.

The fact that the son of such a prominent workshop was their classmate took them by surprise.

"...I'm Rain Marques. Nice to meet you."

During Rain's self-introduction, everyone was puzzled, thinking, "Huh? Is that all?"

His self-introduction had an air of lackadaisical or free-spirited nonchalance, as if he didn't care about making an impression or having people remember his name.

However, the children had witnessed Rain socializing with Octavia, much like Max.

He may be a commoner, but I felt like he must be the child of well-known parents.

The reason for this was that although Rain's parents were famous in their generation, the children didn't know about Christina and Siegfried, who were Rain's parents. With his overly concise self-introduction, his classmates were left wondering, "Who is this kid, after all?"

Finally, it was time for the student that everyone was most curious about.

"I'm Charlotte Wolford! I'm friends with Via-chan, Max, and Rain, and I want to be friends with everyone! Nice to meet you!"

Charlotte's greeting was full of energy. Nobility raised to be ladylike might receive frowns for such a greeting, but Charlotte was a commoner, and above all, the name "Wolford" she mentioned outshone everything.

That's right! She's from the Wolford family! She's the child of the Demon Lord and the Saint!

The children's thoughts were each dominated by such emotions, and they paid little attention to Charlotte's behavior.

The legends of heroes read to them from birth.

The living legend that is Shin, the child of the heroes, was right in front of them and now their classmate.

The children were all thinking of ways to get closer to her, except for one child.

Once all the students had finished their self-introductions, Catreia looked out at everyone.

"All right, thank you, everyone. I know you won't be able to remember everyone at once, but since we're in the same class for a year, you'll eventually get to know each other if you get along. That's it for today. Tomorrow, after discussing our plans from now on, we'll have a tour of the school, so look forward to it. Well then, parents, please join us in the auditorium. Goodbye."

Catreia said this and left the classroom.

The auditorium was the place they had been just a moment ago.

It wasn't a complicated route, and the auditorium itself was visible. There was no need to worry about getting lost, and starting from tomorrow, the students would act on their own.

It was a relatively strict decision for elementary school newcomers, but all the students at this academy were either nobles or the children of wealthy merchants.

It was a stance that they should be able to do at least that much.

As soon as the teacher left the classroom, it immediately became noisy.

Children started chatting with those sitting in front of them or beside them. Some were unsure of what to do and appeared lost. There were various reactions, but no one attempted to leave the classroom.

Everyone was hoping for an opportunity to get closer to Octavia and Charlotte.

Charlotte, as soon as Catreia left, went straight to Octavia.

"Via-chan, let's go home!"

Charlotte's words made everyone in the room stir.

"Via-chan."

She used a pet name to address Octavia, who was, after all, a princess.

No wonder she's from the Wolford family. Their parents are close friends.

Everyone seemed to accept this fact, but...

"Hey, you!!"

One female student approached Charlotte, raising her eyebrows.

"Huh? Me?"

"Yes, you! You didn't hear what the teacher said earlier, did you!?"

The girl pointed firmly at Charlotte while scolding her.

"High-ranking nobles, especially someone like Princess Octavia from the royal family, can't be addressed with a nickname. It's outrageous to use such a term!"

The girl scolded Charlotte, but Charlotte didn't understand why she was being scolded.

"Huh? Via-chan is Via-chan, right? I've been calling her that forever."

What's wrong with calling Via "Via"?

Charlotte had been with Octavia since she could remember, and she had never used any other name for her.

So, Charlotte was genuinely perplexed by the girl's indignation.

The girl, seeing Charlotte's confusion, seemed to feel even angrier and was about to say something else, but Octavia intervened.

"Um, I believe your name is Alicia, right?"

The female student called by Princess Octavia... Alicia was completely flustered, and her face turned red, not out of anger but for a different reason.

"Y-Yes! That's right! I'm Alicia von Weimar! To have Princess Octavia call me by name..."

Alicia, the noble's daughter, was overwhelmed by the fact that she had not only gotten Octavia, a member of the royal family, to remember her name but also to call her by it. She had tears in her eyes.

Seeing Alicia's reaction, Octavia smiled gently. In response, Alicia was even more touched, and Octavia spoke to her.

"Shal and I have been friends since we were babies. We've grown up like sisters. That's why Shal has never called me anything other than 'Via.' So, could you please overlook this?"

As Alicia, even though their parents were close friends, the difference between nobility and commoners was significant. For Alicia, a noble's daughter of the Arlsheid family, a member of the royal family was the utmost authority, and even if she were the daughter of a hero, using a nickname was an unacceptable act.

However, when Octavia herself said it, Alicia couldn't object any further. So, biting her lip, Alicia nodded in response to Octavia's words, although she didn't seem entirely convinced.

Observing Alicia's seemingly dissatisfied expression despite her agreement, Octavia looked slightly troubled.

But then, a voice came from a different direction.

"Via-chan, don't look like that. We've never had anyone complain about Shal doing whatever she wants before, right? Isn't that a good thing?"

"Via, these kinds of kids are rare. Shal never listens to what we say."

Max and Rain had been at the mercy of Charlotte, who was always acting as she pleased. While they often lectured her because of their status as relatives, other adults couldn't criticize her due to her parents being too influential.

In this context, Alicia, who had criticized Charlotte's actions head-on, appeared to be a welcome presence for Max and Rain.

However, when they were told this, Alicia reacted with anger.

"W-What's going on with you two?! Addressing us informally, not to mention using nicknames!? Where are you from...?"

Alicia, her face contorted in anger, looked at Max and Rain, but she stopped mid-sentence. Max and Rain watched her in bewilderment while she remained motionless, still facing their way.

Alicia, who had suddenly frozen, seemed to gradually lose her angry expression and started to appear flustered for some reason.

"What's... wrong?"

"Are you okay? Did you burst a blood vessel?"

Seeing Alicia's sudden change, Max seemed genuinely concerned, but Rain, who had been watching Alicia's expressions change from anger to amazement, was wondering if a blood vessel had actually burst. He had been feeling both irritated and moved by the situation.

Alicia, with her face still red, responded to the words of concern from both of them, "N-No, I haven't burst any!"

"Good, I'm relieved."

"That's a relief."

Seeing that Alicia seemed to be okay, Max and Rain breathed sighs of relief. Alicia, understanding that she had been a cause for concern, kept her head down, her face still flushed.

Max and Rain approached her.

"Um, Alicia, right? I'm Max. Max Bean, nice to meet you."

"I'm Rain Marques."

The two of them introduced themselves to Alicia once more.

"You know, Shal always rushes headlong into things, so we'd be happy if someone like you could become friends with her."

"The role of the stopper is essential."

"W-What? Me, her friend?"

Alicia, surprised by Max's proposal, looked up.

"Yeah, as Via-chan said earlier, we've been together since we were babies, so Shal doesn't really listen to what we say."

"What she did earlier was amazing."

"I-It was indeed..."

Alicia, who had lost her earlier momentum, replied in a muffled voice.

"W-Well, um, if you say so, then I'm fine with being your friend!"

"Eh, Alicia-chan, you'll be my friend!?"

Despite having complained just a while ago, Charlotte happily approached Alicia, who spoke condescendingly.

"N-Not really! You two asked me to! Besides, there might be things I need to teach you!"

Facing Charlotte, who approached her with a beaming smile, Alicia responded while averting her face.

In Octavia's eyes, it was clear that Alicia hadn't accepted Charlotte. Nevertheless, she had readily agreed to become Charlotte's friend.

Is it a tactic to get closer to me, or...?

After seeing Alicia's attitude earlier, Octavia smiled.

"Then, you're my friend too."

"Wha!? O-O-Princess Octavia!?"

Alicia suddenly broke down.

She had tried to eliminate those who were disrespectful to her beloved Octavia, but for some reason, she had become Octavia's friend. Confused and not understanding the meaning of it, Alicia stammered, "W-Why..."

"Hehe. As I said earlier, Shal and I are like sisters. Well, eventually..."

"Huh?"

Octavia cut her sentence short there. Eventually, what?

Alicia thought this, but Octavia looked away, gazing at the entrance.

"Hmm?"

What was it?

Alicia turned around to see a male student who appeared to be an upperclassman standing there.

With silver hair and remarkably handsome, the male student looked around the classroom and then stopped his gaze in their direction.

"Oh, there he is."

"Huh?"

Who was he?

But her confusion was short-lived as his true identity became clear.

"Oh! Big Bro Silver!"

First, Charlotte tried to shout and run towards him, but Octavia pushed her aside and ran towards Silver.

"Hey, Via-chan. Congratulations on enrolling."

"Thank you, Big Bro Silver! Did you come to congratulate Via?!"

"Yeah, that too, but I thought we could all go home together."

The male student, Sylvester, Charlotte's brother, said, and Octavia nodded with a beaming smile.

"Yes! Let's go home together!"

"Hey, Via-chan! That was mean to push me away like that!"

"Oh? I'm sorry, Shal. I didn't see you there."

"Come on! Big bro, how about congratulating Shal too?"

"Sure, congratulations on enrolling, Shal!"

Sylvester said and ruffled Charlotte's head.

"Eek!"

While watching this scene, Alicia thought about something.

Earlier, Octavia referred to that male student as "big brother," but August's eldest child is Octavia, and she doesn't have a brother.

So, he must be Charlotte's brother.

That's also evident from his casual attitude towards Charlotte.

And the words Octavia started earlier...

"Charlotte and I are like sisters. Well, eventually..."

This line, combined with Octavia's gaze towards the male student called Silver...

Could it be that I've accidentally uncovered a secret I shouldn't know?

Alicia started to sweat nervously, but Octavia's behavior suggested that there wasn't any significant secret being hidden.

It seemed unlikely that it was a secret.

"Max, Rain, do you want to go home together too?"

"Yeah!"

"Sure."

When Sylvester called them, Max and Rain ran happily to his side.

"Oh, um..."

"Hmm?"

"What is it?"

"Well, uh..."

Alicia stopped them involuntarily but didn't know what to say and just fidgeted.

Nonetheless, she gathered her courage and finally spoke up.

"From tomorrow, please take care of me!"

"Sure thing!"

"Likewise."

They responded and then dashed off towards Sylvester.

"Uh, by the way!"

"Hmm?"

"What is it?"

"Uh, well, you see..."

Alicia couldn't find the right words and felt a little uneasy.

Still, she mustered the courage to speak.

"Uh, from tomorrow, please take care of me!"

"Of course."

"Likewise."

They replied and then ran over to Sylvester.

As she watched their retreating backs with a longing gaze, Octavia muttered, "I wonder which one."

Her expression, similar to her father August's, seemed to be full of delight.

Seeing Octavia smiling happily as she looked at Alicia, Sylvester, who was talking with Max and Rain, noticed Alicia.

"Who is that girl? Isn't she a friend?"

"Huh? Uh, yes, that's right. She's Alicia, the friend we just made."

"She's Shal's friend!"

"I see."

Sylvester said that and directed his gaze towards Alicia.

"Um, Alicia, right?"

"Yes."

"I'm sorry to spring this on you, but I'm Sylvester Wolford. I'm Charlotte's brother. Alicia, you became Charlotte's friend, right?"

"Yes, I did."

"I see, thanks. Well, how about going to the auditorium together?"

"!!"

To Alicia's surprise, Sylvester made an unexpected suggestion, causing her heart to skip a beat.

"I see. It would have been nice if we had gone together. You really are cool, Silver."

"Yeah, Silver's cool."

It seemed that Sylvester was well-liked not just by Charlotte but also by Max and Rain.

He was the one Octavia had directed her heated gaze at, Charlotte's brother. Unlike his sister, Sylvester had a calm and gentle demeanor.

Alicia couldn't refuse an invitation from such a person.

"Nice to meet you."

"Yeah. Let's go. Our parents are probably tired of waiting."

"Okay!"

With an enthusiastic reply, Octavia looked at Alicia, almost as if to provoke her.

Feeling the icy sensation down her spine from Octavia's gaze, Alicia shook her head vigorously.

Seeing Alicia's reaction, Octavia smiled and clung to Sylvester's left arm.

Surprised by the princess's actions, Alicia couldn't hide her astonishment.

But Sylvester and Octavia themselves...

"Viachan, it's hard to walk."

"Oh my! Silver Oniisama, aren't you going to escort Via?"

"Really now. Shall we go, Your Highness?"

"Hehe, yes. Thank you."

For some reason, a pretend escort began right before their eyes.

And then, in the next moment:

"Oniichan!! You're leaving Charlotte again!!"

Charlotte clung to Sylvester's right arm.

"Make sure to take care of Charlotte too!"

"Oh boy, Charlotte is so spoiled."

"She's my little sister! It's okay to spoil her!"

"Come on, Charlotte! Don't interrupt Silver Oniisama's time!"

"Unfair, Viachan! Charlotte wants to be with oniichan too!"

"Get away!"

"No!"

"Come on, both of you, stop fighting. Shall I leave you behind?"

"No way!"

In response to Sylvester's words, Charlotte and Octavia clung even tighter to his arms.

Astonished, Alicia watched the scene unfold.

"Is it okay...?"

"Huh? Oh, this is just business as usual."

"Business as usual."

"That's right."

Max, Rain, and Alicia walked behind the three of them, and Alicia was already beginning to regret getting involved with Charlotte back in the classroom.

It seems like you didn't provide any text for translation. If you have any text you'd like me to translate, please provide it, and I'd be happy to help.
