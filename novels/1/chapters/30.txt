"What? Are you saying that initially only the students of the Knight Academy will defeat monsters?"

"Yes, it's the wish of the Knight Academy students. It seems that the significance of this training can't be understood with words alone."

Og explains the background to Zig and the others.

Both Zig and Chris wear expressions of disbelief.

"Well... it's the pride of students who don't know the battlefield."

"What are you thinking? You guys!"

"Well, we are the top students of the Knight Academy! We'll defeat monsters even without the support of magic users!"

The students from the Knight Academy, who were criticized by the two, insisted on defeating monsters on their own as they had already committed themselves.

"That's not the kind of training we're talking about!"

"Zig, that's enough. As His Highness says, if words don't work, they should try experiencing it."

"But still!"

"This training is a first-time attempt. Moreover, it's common for new recruits who just joined the military to not want knights or swordsmen to require support from magic users, or for magic users to require support from knights or swordsmen."

"It may be common, but..."

"Just think of it as happening a little earlier. Such measures are often taken in these cases."

"So, it's to gain experience as students so that there won't be any trouble once they enter the military."

"That's right, and Shin is also participating in this training. There shouldn't be any issues."

"That's true."

Oh, Zig and Chris agree with each other.

Concerning me...

I'm not quite satisfied, but for now, it's decided that the Knight Academy students will be the ones to defeat the monsters.

"The students from the Magic Academy don't have to deal with this, do they?"

"Well, there is one who doesn't seem convinced."

Saying that, Og looks at Maria.

"What is it?"

"No, I thought Messina might understand the purpose of this training well."

"I do understand. After being shown that twice... I can't do anything on my own; I need the support of knights and swordsmen... It's frustrating, but that's the reality."

"I see. So, Maria-chan, right? You saw Shin fighting the demon?"

"Yes, that's right! I did! Something like that can only be done by Shin, who can use both magic and a sword."

"Yes, that's right! I did! Something like that can only be done by Shin, who can use both magic and a sword."

"What? Can Walford use a sword too?"

"It's probably nothing special."

"After all, he's just a magician."

...Why am I the target?

"Cook, well, it's a fair assessment, isn't it?"

"You'll understand that soon enough. Now, there's no point in staying here forever. Let's go."

Under Chris's command, they finally made their way to the training location.

Just departing took up so much time... I wonder what lies ahead...

They arrived in the forest and went further in. The deeper into the forest, the less human activity, which means that powerful monsters are more likely to remain. So today, their target is medium to large-sized monsters.

While using detection magic, they walked, and everyone became quieter after entering the forest.

"What's wrong? Why the sudden silence?"

"It's only natural. It's their first time fighting monsters. It would be strange not to be nervous."

"Shin, you were nervous the first time you fought a monster, right?"

"...I wonder?"

"Oh, I've heard about that from Merlin-sama, that story."

"I have too."

"What? What kind of story is it?"

"...I think it's better not to ask."

"You'll definitely lose confidence."

"In that case, I'm even more curious!"

"We want to hear it too. Christina-sama, could you tell us?"

"Me!?"

"Yes."

"I'm being ignored!"

"Hmm, you're quite noisy. In that case, you tell the story."

"I was planning to do that anyway... Oh well. Do you know that Shin was living deep in the forest here until recently?"

"Yes, I've been there."

"We want to hear the story too..."

"Is that the kind of life you led in the depths of the forest? Apparently, Shin became skilled enough in hunting to consider teaching monster subjugation. So, he taught them detection magic and immediately found a monster."

"So, what did Shin do?"

"Upon finding the monster... without any hesitation, he dashed towards the monster."

"No hesitation?"

At that time, I just thought I needed to defeat it as quickly as possible.

"Was there something like that before Shin's story?"

"What's that story? We don't know."

"Then let me continue. Shin, who headed towards the monster, saw... Shin, what kind of monster was it?"

"It was a three-meter tall, red-furred bear-like monster."

"That's..."

"No way... a Red Grizzly..."

"I heard it from Merlin-sama, so it's confirmed. It seems even Merlin-sama was puzzled by the unexpected situation. To think that for his first monster subjugation, he'd face such a formidable opponent... But this guy..."

Saying that, Zig and Chris took turns to speak, looking at me.

"Shin, once again without any hesitation, jumped at the Red Grizzly monster and instantly killed it by cutting off its arms and neck."

"A Red Grizzly is something that even the military can barely defeat with several people..."

"He cut it off!?"

"Does that mean... he defeated it with a sword, not magic?"

"Even though he's the top student at the Magic Academy, can he wield a sword?"

"And furthermore..."

"Is there more to this story?"

"At that time, Shin was ten years old."

"Ten!?"

Og and the others had heard the story once before, so they weren't too surprised, but the Knight Academy students were left speechless.

Maybe it was too much for a ten-year-old to face a bear?

"That's why, when it comes to monster subjugation, he probably never felt nervous, did he?"

"Well, certainly...!"

While they were having that conversation, the detection magic picked up a monster's response, and it was heading straight towards them.

"Zig-ni-chan."

"Yeah, I get it. All right! It's your turn, Knight Academy students!"

Upon hearing Zig-ni-chan's words, everyone tensed up.

For now, I'll let Chris and the others handle it. Of course, I'll be prepared to ensure their safety.

"A monster will appear just beyond that thicket soon. Prepare for combat."

In response to Zig-ni-chan's words, Chris and the other Knight Academy students drew their swords and got ready. And...

"Roar!"

What appeared was a two-meter-tall wild boar.

It looks quite delicious if it wasn't turned into a monster. What a waste. When they turn into monsters, their magical power changes, and they can't be eaten anymore.

"Shin, are you... thinking of something weird?"

How did he figure it out!? Og's intuition has been so sharp lately; it's scary.

And the Knight Academy students, while trembling with fear, gathered their resolve.

"Don't be scared! We'll show the strength of the top students of the Knight Academy! Let's go!"

"Yeah!"

And so, Chris and the others charged at the oncoming wild boar.

They tried to strike while slipping past it, but the boar was faster.

"Roar!"

"Uwaaa!"

They couldn't avoid it, and they were sent flying. It's like being hit by a car, but at least it wasn't a head-on collision.

The boar that had thrown Chris and the others turned back and spotted them pointing their swords at it.

Chris and the others hadn't fully recovered from the shock of being thrown.

They could only watch with a look of despair as the boar charged at them again.

I wonder if they've learned their lesson now.

I stood in front of the charging boar and drew my vibration sword. I avoided the charge, swung the vibration sword from bottom to top, aiming for the neck as we passed each other.

The boar's head was cleanly chopped off, and it slid to a stop in front of Chris and the others.

"Hiyaa!"

"An... a single strike!"

Oh, Chris and the others couldn't move, and they were super shocked to see the monster's dead body right in front of them.

"When did he...?"

"Indeed, well done."

"Th-thank you, but shouldn't we heal the Knight Academy students?"

"Wait, Cecily. I will talk to them while the pain is still fresh."

Saying that, Chris approached Chris and the others.

"It's quite disgraceful. That monster was weak even for a medium-sized one. Yet, you were boasting so much, and look at you now."

Chris and the others had pained expressions, and their confidence had been shattered.

"Do you understand now? You may have been the top of the Knight Academy, but in the end, you're just students who don't know the battlefield. Join the military, and you'll see that you're the weakest. You won't even be able to match the new recruits who joined last year."

Chris and the others became even more dejected.

"Even you guys, with a little magic user support, can defeat such monsters. You are weak. Join the rest of the training while keeping this in mind."

"Yes."

Chris and the others seemed like they were on the verge of tears. Maybe I overdid it a little?

While Chris and the others were feeling down, Cecily ran over to them.

"Um, from now on, I'll cast healing magic, so please stay still."

Saying that, she used healing magic.

"We... looked down on you..."

"I'm not concerned about that. We're in the same party now, so this is natural."

"You..."

Cecily smiled while casting healing magic.

...What is it? Chris and the others looking at Cecily seem strange. And it's making me quite annoyed.

After being healed by the recovery magic, Chris and the others looked in my direction.

"...We owe you thanks, Walford."

"...It's okay, don't worry about it. Cecily said it too, we're a party."

"Yeah, that's right. Still, to think that was a single strike... I'm embarrassed for being jealous of Walford."

"It was amazing."

"Next time, we'll cooperate properly and subdue the monsters."

"Yeah, that's right."

Jealousy, huh. I guess it's because once again, a magician subjugated a monster, and the knight trainees didn't find it interesting.

This time, I turned to Cecily.

"You... you're like a saint."

"I've never received such kindness from a girl before..."

"All the girls around us..."

"What? What are you trying to say?"

"No, it's just..."

"I've awakened, and from now on, I'll fight to protect you."

"I won't let you get hurt, not even a scratch!"

"By the way, what's your name..."

"I'm Cecily von Claude..."

"Cecily, I'll protect you!"

"What are you saying! I'll protect you!"

"No, I will!"

...Those guys who have no immunity to kind girls seem to have taken a liking to Cecily.

What is it...? Even though they seemed to be getting ready to cooperate, this jealousy won't go away. ideas
