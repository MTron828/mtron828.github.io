about how to plan my New Years resolutions

"Romantic Entanglement?"

I don't know what Tony thought as he watched our interaction, but he said something like that.

"Yeah. Human grudges can sometimes stem from romantic entanglements, not just unfair treatment."

"Oh... Tony was almost there, wasn't he?"

"Hey, can you please stop that? I've narrowed it down to one person now."

"Do I sense extra danger, or is it just my imagination?"

The girl who wasn't chosen might hold a grudge...

"It's possible, so could you really stop?"

"My bad, I teased too much."

"Seriously... Let's get back to the topic. Kyle-san, who has become a demon, was together with the Sage and High Priest since their student days, right?"

"Yeah, that's what he said."

"And the Sage and High Priest got married."

"That's right."

...Could it be?

"Is this about a love triangle involving Grandma?"

"There's a possibility, isn't there?"

A romantic entanglement involving Grandma...

"No way, I can't imagine that, and I don't want to."

"Well, Shin is family, and we only know the two of you now."

"We can easily imagine it by looking at old pictures."

"The High Priest's appearance from the past is quite beautiful."

Family romantic entanglements. My brain is rejecting the idea of it involving Grandma, but from what Maria, Thor, and Yuri are saying, it seems easy to imagine.

"Oh, Grandma was an ideal woman, beautiful, noble, and a dignified role model for women. She supported Grandpa, and she's an ideal female figure for men too."

Sicily finally peeked out from the sheets and joined the conversation as she came back to life.

"Not scary, just a bit different from what I initially thought, after getting to know the real Lady Merida."

"It's Shin-dono, so it can't be helped, can it?"

"Haha, that's right!"

"No doubt about that."

"Don't switch to insults so casually!"

It was so natural that it surprised me!

"But, I have to admit that Tony's words make sense."

But if that's the case...

"Would an Imperial noble bear a grudge against the Empire? In a nation that privileges the nobility?"

Is that even possible?

"We don't know, so they might be struggling."

"That could be the case."

Oh, well. It seems like we're left with more questions than answers in the end.

In the end, that day concluded without reaching any conclusions.

"Leaving things unknown... it's uncomfortable."

"Haha. Shin, you've always been like that. If there's something you don't know, you can't be satisfied until you thoroughly investigate it."

"Dis-san, do you know anything about the demons too?"

"I don't know anything beyond what Lord Merlin and Lady Merida said."

"Is that so?"

"It was only later that it became clear from your testimonies that Mr. Kyle, who became a demon, was a former member of the Magic Corps. No one mentioned he used to be a magician until then."

"Even though he was as skilled as Grandpa?"

"That's precisely why it's a disgrace to the Magic Corps back then. They mistreated and undervalued magicians on par with Lord Merlin, burying them. The higher-ups weren't even aware of the existence of such magicians."

So the Magic Corps desperately covered it up.

Organizational cover-ups seem to be common everywhere.

"That's why both the Magic Corps and the Knights underwent audits. To ensure there's no corruption or unfair evaluations."

That's how bit by bit the organizations were purified, even in this seemingly prosperous kingdom.

"More importantly, what's the matter?"

"Huh? Oh, I'm thinking about making communication devices available to the public soon."

"I see."

"For that, we need substantial equipment investments and personnel. I was wondering if we could ask the country for help with that."

"Oh? What do you mean?"

"Current communication devices can only communicate with a pair of devices, right? I want to create an exchange where various communication devices can be connected."

When you transmit from a communication device, it connects to an exchange first, and that exchange then connects to the assigned communication device.

There's no automatic technology to handle this exchange, so it has to be done manually.

For that, we need extensive facilities.

Since it deals with information, I want it to be operated under the government's supervision.

I wanted to make a request to Dis-san.

"Because it's connected by human hands, you can also track the connection time, right? We can charge based on that time. I want our company to handle the system, but I'd like the operation to be government-run. With communication fees coming in, it will be profitable, right?"

What do you think?

"Hmm. There's a need for some initial investment, but it can be recovered afterward. Shin, you've come up with a good business idea."

Actually, all that's needed is infrastructure investment and labor costs.

The rest is generating revenue from something invisible like communication.

When you think about it, the information and communication industry is quite an interesting business.

"But is this okay? If you operate it through the Walford Company, you could make a huge profit."

Even if we make that much profit, there's no use for it. Regarding the distribution of profits from the communication business, after this incident is over, I'm thinking of using it for entertainment services.

"That's a luxurious concern."

"And it's about handling conversations as information. If one company monopolizes it, it might lead to misunderstandings."

"That's true. It seems like it will generate a sufficient profit, and we promise that the government will handle the operation."

"Thank you. I'll be counting on you."

"Haha. The one to thank is me. This will generate immense profits. After all, the cost is limited to the initial investment and labor costs."

Dis-san accepted this proposal with great enthusiasm.

All that's left is to add a function to notify incoming calls on the communication devices and develop the exchange facilities.

"So, Dad. I'm going to work on improving the communication devices and developing the exchange facilities from now on, so I'm counting on you."

"Yeah, that's fine, but..."

"What is it?"

Mr. Bean, who I had addressed, seemed hesitant.

I wondered what was going on, and he leaned in, speaking in a low voice.

"Why am I here for a discussion about a national project like this!?"

"Well, you're the one who's going to create the project's facilities, right?"

"True, but if that's the case! Why do I have to be present for this discussion?"

"Well, isn't it easier to develop if you understand the project's details?"

"That's... well, I guess that's true... I mean, not true!"

What's going on? Is there something else?

"Why is the meeting place for this discussion in my workshop?"

The three of them, Dis-san, Dad, and Mr. Bean, were in a room at Bean Workshop.

Since Dis-san happened to drop by our place, I thought it was a good opportunity and brought him to Bean Workshop to discuss the recent conversation.

Once this is done, he'll return to my place. Discussing it here is more convenient.

After explaining this, my dad looked exasperated.

"More convenient... It's His Majesty, you know? King, His Majesty! Why are you treating him like this?"

"Oh, Master of the workshop. Shin and I have a casual relationship, so don't worry about it."

"Yeah, right!"

Oh, the imposing Mr. Bean Workshop's dad is very humble.

Seeing this, I realized that Dis-san is indeed the king.

"Is our conversation over? If so, could you take me home soon? I want to cool down with a cold ale."

He's still just a relative, after all.

He lacks the dignity he has at home.

"Sure. By the way, you're always at our place, right? Is it okay to leave Julia and others behind?"

"Oh, they went to Claude's territory with May today."

"Sicily's place?"

"There's a royal villa there. They took May there using a gate. They say the hot springs are good for the skin."

Oh, so even August gets used as a taxi...

When you can use a gate, it naturally leads to that kind of treatment.

"Alright then, Dad. I'll come back later to finalize the details."

"Alright... I got it. Just hurry up and take His Majesty with you. Don't keep him waiting."

"Alright, Master of the workshop. I'm counting on you."

"Yes! I understand!"

I take Dis-san back home through the gate.

When we arrive at my place, I bring up something I couldn't discuss earlier.

"About the magic stone mining... They've mined enough to reflect the verification results."

"Oh, I see."

"Is that all you can say? This is a groundbreaking discovery of the century, you know? Well, I guess someone who can create magic stones by themselves wouldn't understand."

Well, I didn't even know about the existence of magic stones until recently.

I don't grasp how rare they are.

"We're going to publish these verification results worldwide through the Magic Academy. This should greatly accelerate magical tool development."

"I hope it turns out that way."

"Oh, Grandma, I'm back."

"Welcome back."

While discussing with Dis-san about magic stones, Grandma, who was at home, joined the conversation.

He's a leading figure in magical tool development, so I wonder if he's interested now that magic stones are more affordable?

"Grandma, are you going to work on magical tool development again?"

"Me? Spare me the joke. There's no future in the magical tool world for an old lady like me. It's the young ones who will do something about it."

"Is that so?"

"What are the young talents saying? You have to lead the young ones, don't you?"

"Me?"

"...No, never mind. If you were to lead the young ones, who knows what would happen to the magical tool world?"

"Hey! What do you mean?"

"I mean exactly what I said! You... aren't thinking of making some crazy magical tool again, are you?"

The communication device is already developed, so besides that...

"I gave up on two-wheel and four-wheel transportation."

"I see... So you finally gave up on it. Giving up on that means you finally exercised some restraint, right?"

"No, I just forgot something important."

"Something important?"

"I forgot to put brakes on them."

"...If they had brakes, you would have made them, right?"

"Yeah, I... oops."

I accidentally blurted out "yeah."

What a skillful leading question!

"You... seriously need to put some brakes on that thought of yours!"

"Well done!"

"Not well done! Really, you..."

Oh, today, Grandma is as scary as ever.

I can't imagine anyone competing for her.

Or maybe she was different when she was younger?

"What is it? Why are you staring at me?"

"Huh? Oh, no."

Curious, I ended up staring at Grandma.

But what's the truth?

"Are you concerned about yesterday's conversation?"

"Oh, Sicily, thanks."

"Your Majesty, please help yourself."

"Oh, I'm sorry, Sicily. I'll have some."

As I was wondering about Grandma's younger days, Sicily joined the conversation while making tea.

"Yesterday's conversation?"

"Yeah. We were all talking about it after Tony mentioned the entanglement of romantic feelings."

Grandma seemed perplexed when we discussed the romantic entanglement Tony had mentioned.

"Well... I've never heard anything like that from Kyle."

"What about Grandpa?"

"I haven't heard anything either."

Just as I thought. Everyone is overthinking it.

"But..."

"What is it, Grandpa?"

As Grandpa, who mentioned that he had never heard Kyle say he liked Grandma, continued speaking.

"Kyle wasn't the type to openly broadcast his feelings to others. He might have hidden his true feelings in his heart."

"Huh? Seriously?"

Keeping his feelings to himself... Maybe Kyle was the type of person who would internalize his worries and frustrations.

"This old lady, although she looks so intimidating now, was a bit more charming back in the day and was quite popular, I reckon."

"Really... That's surprising."

"Younger girls used to call her 'big sister.'"

"Big sister!"

Oh, this is hilarious.

"Sh-Shin, you guys..."

"Huh?"

"You..."

Oh, Grandma is trembling.

"You need to stop it!"

Yep, she's still intimidating!

I can't believe she had a charming side.
