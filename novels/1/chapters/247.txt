"Huh!? Individual identification of magic power!?"

The following week, along with Mark and Yuri, I had discovered that there were individual waves of magic power and conducted various verifications. I had come to the royal castle to report to Aug.

Thanks to the king, who is believed to be a reincarnator, the entire Kingdom of Earlsheid has implemented a two-day weekend system.

Even government officials, in other words, those working in the royal castle, have days off, so the royal castle is also closed.

When I contacted Aug, I was told that today he was relaxing in his room with Ellie, so I visited with Granny.

"I'm sorry, Your Highness. After hearing from Shin, I thought it was an urgent matter that I needed to inform you about. I apologize for bothering you on your day off, but could you accompany me for a bit?"

"If it's a request from Lord Merida, of course, I won't refuse... But why did Shin discover something like that in the first place?"

"Well, you see..."

Since Aug asked, I told him about the exchange I had with Bean's workshop last week.

Upon hearing this, Aug sighed deeply, placing his hand on his forehead.

"Analyzing the citizen's ID, you...!"

"Let me make it clear, I haven't modified it."

"Of course not! Even if it hasn't been applied before, tampering with a citizen's ID is a crime! Don't ever do it!!"

"I won't! And to be precise, I can't do it."

"You can't?"

"Yeah. If I rewrite anything on that citizen's ID, it might stop functioning properly."

"Rewrite and it stops functioning...?"

My words puzzled Granny.

Granny rarely gets confused, but even for her, my words must have been unexpected.

"The citizen's ID functions through a complex combination of various grants. Therefore, if you rewrite any one of them, it might not work properly. Adding new information like a name and personal magic power is undoubtedly possible, but..."

"Even you can't do it?"

"I can't. I don't have that specialized knowledge. I was an ordinary person in my previous life."

"You were an ordinary person...?"

Aug had a bewildered expression, but that was the truth.

"If I had more specialized knowledge, I might have accomplished something even more incredible."

"For example...?"

To understand its meaning, you first need to learn it from the language, or the effects won't work as an endowed spell.

"Over a thousand characters, Shin? Do you remember them all?"

"I can read all of them, but there are many characters I can't write."

Especially as an adult, I had fewer opportunities to write characters, and when composing text, I relied heavily on the conversion functions of computers and smartphones. I've even forgotten quite a few by now. In fact, when trying to endow the Vibration Sword, I couldn't recall the character "æŒ¯" for "vibration" and had to rewrite it several times. And that's within less than ten years since my reincarnation. Imagine after eighteen years.

"Difficult characters are already forgotten, so even if I were to teach you, I wouldn't be able to do it properly."

"I see. Well, that's disappointing."

Granny seemed somewhat relieved despite her disappointment. I wonder if she's thinking that if I've forgotten difficult characters, I won't be able to create any more unusual endowments. Although challenging characters don't necessarily translate to challenging endowments, I won't complicate matters by explaining that.

As I quietly resolved myself to that, Aug asked me with a curious expression.

"So, what's next? While I do think this is a historic discovery, why did you choose me? This should be a matter to bring to the Magic Academy."

Indeed, that's true, but something from the conversation when I discovered the magic sigils came up, so I tried it out of curiosity. Then... unexpected results followed.

"Hey, could you let your magic flow through this first?"

I said that and handed Aug a magic sigil measuring device about the size of a smartphone.

"Like this?"

Aug obediently let his magic flow through it, and the measurement device displayed Aug's magic sigil on its surface.

"Wow, so this is Aug's magic sigil?"

Ellie, who was next to Aug, peered into the measurement device and murmured.

"I can measure yours too."

"What!? But I don't have any aptitude for magic, you know?"

"Even if you can't interfere with the outside world as magic, you still have magic, right? Try it as if you were activating your citizen's ID."

I said that and took out another measurement device, handing it to Ellie.

"Um, like this?"

While saying that, when she let her magic flow through, Ellie's magic sigil appeared on the measurement device.

Seeing this, Ellie had an unexpectedly moved expression.

"Well... this is my magic sigil."

Ellie muttered, showing the measurement device to Aug.

"Aug! Look at this! This is my magic sigil!"

"Ah, it's quite beautiful."

"Hehe."

It seemed she was delighted by the visible form of her internal magic. Ellie is the only one among our friends who can't use magic. We don't mind, but she herself feels a slight sense of exclusion. For Ellie, having her magic visualized seemed to be a cause for great happiness. She gazed happily at the measurement device displaying her magic sigil.

"So, what's the point of this?"

While Ellie remained content, Aug prompted for the next step.

"Right, then could you use magic, even something simple?"

"Hmm? Oh, sure, but..."

As Aug said this, he conjured a small flame at his fingertip.

"Okay, that's enough."

"What in the world is this?"

When I told him it was fine to extinguish the magic, Aug extinguished the flame with a puzzled expression. Paying no mind to Aug's baffled expression, I took out another measurement device.

"Just watch..."

I said this while holding up the measurement device near the spot where Aug had used magic earlier. And then...

"Hey, Shin! What's this!?"

Aug yelled out as he saw the measurement device.

It was no wonder he reacted that way, as the measurement device displayed a pattern.

"This is... mine..."

Aug muttered as he looked at the measurement device in his hand and then at the one I was holding up. The same pattern as Aug's magic sigil was displayed there.

"I've been wondering about this for a long time."

As I looked at the surprised Aug, I talked about something I had been pondering for a while.

"We gather magical energy from the atmosphere to create magic. But what happens to the magic after we cast it?"

While I was talking, Aug stared at me intently without offering any comments.

"I've been thinking that maybe, after magic manifests, magic power is returned to the atmosphere as magical energy," I said.

I looked at the measurement device in my hand.

"How long does it take for it to be converted back to magical energy in the atmosphere? And how long does it remain as magic power during that time?"

Saying this, I gently shook the measurement device.

"Since I happened to create something like this by chance, I thought of trying it out. As expected, the magic power remains for a while after using magic."

Then, I looked intently at Aug.

"Retaining the magic sigil of the person who used the magic."

After I said that, Aug continued to look at the measurement device that detected the magic sigil that appeared after he cast magic, but he didn't say anything.

At this point, Ellie, who was simply impressed, spoke up.

"Well, this is another incredible discovery, isn't it? Shin, will you leave your name in the history of magic once again?"

"That's not all," Aug finally spoke after taking over Ellie's words.

"What do you mean by 'not all'?"

"Well, if you use this magic sigil measuring device, you can find traces of magic, and you can even identify the person who cast the spell."

As Aug said this, Ellie looked surprised.

"What does that mean?"

In response to Ellie's question, Aug slumped his shoulders.

"It means that we can now gather evidence of magic-related crimes that were previously unsolvable."

At those words, Ellie's eyes widened in amazement.

"What a major discovery!"

"That's right. So Shin brought it to me instead of the Magic Academy, right?"

"That's right. Will this be useful for the Security Bureau's criminal investigations?"

"It's not just useful; it's going to revolutionize criminal investigations."

Aug said this with a serious expression and then asked me.

"Can these measurement devices that show the magic sigils be made permanent?"

"Yes, if you put them in this box and let magic flow through, they will be made permanent."

I said this and handed Aug a box that was just the right size to fit the measurement device.

"Thank you. This way, we can preserve the evidence. By the way, how much residual magic power is left?"

"The experiment took a whole day. It didn't matter whether it was a large or small spell."

"So, it's a race to preserve the evidence within a day of a crime occurring. What if it's discovered later?"

"There's not much we can do about that. We can't defy the laws of nature."

"That's true."

Aug said this and took out a radio communication device to contact someone.

"Is this Willer? It's me. I'm sorry to bother you on your day off, but could you come to the royal castle right away? It's a very important matter. Oh, sorry about that. We can meet in the usual conference room. Alright, then."

After ending the call, Aug turned to Ellie with an apologetic expression.

"Ellie, I'm sorry. I have to have a meeting with Willer now."

Upon hearing this, Ellie let out a small sigh and responded to Aug's words.

"Yes, I understand. The Security Bureau works around the clock, day and night. You want to deploy this measurement device as soon as possible, right?"

"I'm sorry."

"That's why I understand."

They had been spending a leisurely holiday together, just the two of them, so this was a bit unfortunate. However, this was a matter that needed to be conveyed to Aug urgently.

"I'm off then. Shin, I'm counting on you for the rest."

"Huh?"

Saying this, Aug left the room.

"Counting on me for what?"

As I looked around the room, I noticed that Ellie, who had been quite content earlier, was now wearing a very sulky expression.

"Oh, um, Ellie, you seemed to understand..."

As I said that, Ellie gave me a sharp look.

"I understand the situation, but I'm not happy about it!! We finally had a relaxing time with Aug after a long time!!"

Oh, she definitely didn't understand. As the Crown Princess and the actions of the Crown Prince Aug, she could understand, but on a personal level, Ellie was really upset about having her leisure time with her husband interrupted.

"Shin."

"Yes!"

"Take responsibility and bring me back home."

"Huh? To my place?"

"Yes. I'll have Shishily entertain me. Is that alright?"

"Yes, of course..."

Well, since I was the one who brought up this matter. I can't just spoil Aug and Ellie's time and then spend my time with Shishily alone. After opening the gate to take Ellie home, I looked at Grandma, who was trembling.

"Why are you laughing, Grandma?"

"Oh, I was just wondering why the men in the Walford family always seem to be under a woman's thumb."
