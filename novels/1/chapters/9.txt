"I learned a shocking fact.

Grandpa and grandma were once married.

Well, I always thought they had a close relationship, but I never imagined they were actually married.

Moreover, the fact that it's 'former' implies that something must have happened, but I want to know more about it, yet I can't bring myself to ask, and it's bothering me.

Well, I guess they'll tell me when the opportunity arises, so I'll wait until then.

With that said, we're in the middle of moving. Packing is super easy thanks to the extra-dimensional storage. In this world, moving is a magician's exclusive domain.

Moving is over in no time, and we're soon heading to the capital. I'm looking forward to what kind of life awaits us there.

I've lived in this house for fourteen years, so I'm quite attached to it.

By the way, they're planning to leave this house as it is. They'll cast protective barriers for both intruders and maintenance, so it won't deteriorate. Hooray for magic.

And, it was Grandma Merida who prepared those magical tools.

She really takes care of us.

So, I made this suggestion:

'Grandpa, how big is the house in the capital?'

'Well, it's quite large since it was granted by the country. I can't remember how many rooms there were.'

Seriously?

'Uh, Grandpa, could you... give me some details?'

'Hmm, let's see. There are twenty rooms, a small hall for evening gatherings, a large reception room. A big living room with a large fireplace and a sofa that can seat ten people. A dining room where about twenty people can have a meal, and there's also a bathroom. Plus, it's not just a kitchen; it has a full-fledged kitchen.'

Seriously, it's huge!

'Grandma, you know a lot about it, don't you?'

'Well, I was briefly married to that old man, and we received the mansion when we were still together. I lived there too.'

'I see. Hey, Grandma?'

'Hmm? What is it?'

'Would you consider living there with us?'

'You fool!!'

'Wha-what are you saying?'

Grandpa spit out his tea upon hearing a certain goalkeeper's name, and Grandma, blushing, shouted.

'But, I mean, if you remember the layout in such detail, it means you were in charge of the house when you lived there with Grandpa, right? Having a grandma who knows her way around such a mansion would be really helpful.'

A brief silence."

"While I was still perplexed by their titles, the people around us began to buzz.

'So they are the Wise One!?'

'Is that true?'

'It seems the High Priestess is here too!'

'Wise One! High Priestess!'

Wow! The surroundings were getting noisy.

'Sorry, but it seems things are about to get rowdy here. Can we expedite this process?'

'Yes, please. And, um... what about this young one?'

Young one! That's the first time I've been called that! My rear end is itching now.

'Oh, this child is Shin. Shin Walford. We're his grandparents.'

'Oh, your grandchild, I see! Please go ahead.'

'Ah, thank you. Good work, sir.'

'Ah, thank you!'

That soldier was on the verge of tears. It's amazing, Grandpa and Grandma are still considered heroes in this country. It's not about me, but it's incredibly heartwarming.

Amid the attention from the crowd, we headed towards the house in the capital. Truly, the capital was bustling with people. Despite being a former Japanese person and knowing the crowds of Tokyo, this was my first time seeing such a large number of people in this world in nearly fourteen years.

As we navigated the streets while glancing around at the crowd, I couldn't help but notice the beautiful cityscape. The roads were all cobblestone, and the buildings were all made of stone. If you looked closely, you could see that concrete was used as well. It didn't feel out of place, given that concrete was also used in ancient Rome in my previous life. There was no litter, and it had that typical European-style urban environment, even in modern times.

After about thirty minutes of carriage ride, I realized how vast the capital was. The royal castle was still visible in the distance. Surrounding the castle, there were large estates where nobles and wealthy merchants resided, and beyond that, there were districts where commoners lived.

The house we were heading to was located in the commoners' district, known as the Commoners' Quarter. There wasn't a strict division between the Commoners' Quarter and the Noble Quarter, but it was explained that nobles who frequently visited the royal castle tended to build their residences closer, while commoners who had no business with the castle settled in the outskirts, resulting in the city's layout we were witnessing.

Finally, we arrived at the estate. I gaped in awe at the sheer size of it. This was like one of those houses where you can't live unless you've done something bad, even in my past life."

As I pondered such things in front of the mansion gate:

"Welcome back, Merlin-sama, Merida-sama, and nice to meet you, Shin-sama," a soldier in impressive armor emerged from the side of the gate.

"Wait, Shin-sama...?"

"He is the honored grandson of our respected hero. It's only natural to address him as Shin-sama."

Seriously? Why does everyone keep saying that?

"Well, this child isn't used to such treatment. Could you not be too formal with him?"

"Yes, of course."

No, that's still pretty formal.

The gatekeeper? opened the gate and the carriage entered the estate.

It really is a massive house. Two stories high, symmetrically designed, probably with five rooms on the right and five on the left on the second floor, totaling twenty rooms. And when we opened the huge gate...

"Welcome back."

A row of maids and butlers welcomed us.

"Huh? What's going on?"

"Haha, Diaseum sent them over."

"Ah, so that's why they're here."
