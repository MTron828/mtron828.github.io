"（You must not make Max anxious）"

With that thought in mind, Sylvester forced a smile.

"Yeah, it's a big castle."

"Yeah."

Sylvester advanced, feeling a little comforted by Max's innocent smile. This place was secluded, and they couldn't ask the adults for directions. So, they decided to move towards where people were.

With that in mind, they continued walking and suddenly emerged into an open area. It looked like a garden within the royal castle, well-maintained but devoid of people. However, the fact that it was well-maintained meant that people did come here. Sylvester felt a bit relieved and then reacted sharply.

"Big brother?"

"I... I hear voices."

There were people. Finally, they could find their way back to their original location. With that reassurance, Sylvester walked toward the direction of the voices.

And when they finally saw figures and were about to call out...

"!"

Sylvester hastily hid behind a nearby pillar.

"Big..."

"Shh!"

Max, who was about to call for Sylvester, was surprised by Sylvester's serious expression as he pressed a finger to his lips and nodded in understanding.

Relieved by Max's reaction, Sylvester shifted his attention to the figures. There were not one but two of them, engaged in a conversation. Sylvester had hidden because he overheard their conversation.

And that conversation was...

"What's the plan? When are we going to attack Elizabeth?"

"Well, Elizabeth is with the saint and the kids now. Today, with so many kids, it's the perfect time to strike."

"Hostages, huh?"

"Yeah, well, we can't let both of them live."

It was a plan to attack Princess Elizabeth, the Crown Prince's wife. What's more, these people weren't just targeting Elizabeth but also their mother and themselves.

Terrifying.

Until now, Sylvester had been warned about the danger of being targeted in the city because they were the children of the affluent Walford family in Arlsheid.

As a result, when they went out, they had many guards with them, and there had apparently been attacks. However, Sylvester had never witnessed these attacks firsthand, so he didn't feel the reality of it.

But now, right in front of them, the culprits were discussing a plan to kill them. Why? Wasn't the royal castle supposed to be safe? Such questions raced through Sylvester's mind.

In any case, they had to find a way to get away from here and inform their mother about the attack plan. However, if they moved recklessly, the men might discover them. The fear immobilized Sylvester. What should they do?

It was in the midst of these thoughts when two figures ran towards them, loudly calling their names.

"Big brother!"
"Sylvie onii-sama!"

In the corner of their field of vision, Sylvester saw Charlotte and Octavia. It seemed that the knight and maid couldn't catch the two of them, and like Sylvester, they had also become lost. Spotting Sylvester's figure, they ran toward him, relieved.

"Charlotte! Via-chan! You shouldn't have come!"

"!!"

Sylvester's loud warning made Charlotte and Octavia stop in their tracks, startled. Given that Charlotte had shouted earlier and likely revealed their presence, Sylvester thought it would be better for them to stay apart and have him approach. Sylvester quickly scooped up Max and ran toward the two of them.

"What? Are these the brats we were talking about?"
"How did they...?"

The sudden appearance of the children surprised the men who had been discussing their plan. After all, they had been planning to kill these children, including Sylvester, just a moment ago. They never expected the children to come to this place alone or to eavesdrop on their conversation. As Sylvester faced Charlotte and Octavia with Max on his back, the men exchanged a few words and wore sly smiles.

"Well, well, Princess Octavia. You shouldn't have come to a place like this."
"That's right. Now, let us escort you to Her Majesty."

The two men spoke with condescension, assuming that the children couldn't understand the contents of their conversation.

In that case, they had thought of entering the room under the pretext of sending the children to their mother and carrying out their plan.

In reality, Octavia, who had been lost for a while, looked relieved and attempted to approach the two of them. However, Sylvester intervened.

"Don't go, Via-chan! Those people are bad!"

Sylvester's loud voice made Octavia, who had been trying to approach the men, stop in her tracks, and she once again hid behind Sylvester.

"Hey, don't say strange things, kid."

"Yeah. We're just good people trying to take you back to your mother, right?"

Grinning, the men said this, but Sylvester was resolute.

"It's a lie! I heard what you said earlier! You're planning to kill our moms and us! You said it's a chance now!"

In response to Sylvester's words, the men scoffed. They never expected that Sylvester would understand their earlier conversation.

"Big brother, is that true?"
"Sylvie big brother?"
"It's true."

Charlotte and Octavia noticed that Sylvester was trembling slightly. Max had been clinging to Sylvester, trembling as well. It was true.

Faced with such terror, Charlotte and Octavia found themselves paralyzed with fear. Seeing this, the men went from expressions of astonishment and sneering back to their smirking faces.

"Well, it might have saved us some trouble."
"That's right. If we can just kill the princess, the rest should be easy."
"Yeah, after all, there are no witnesses."

They were talking about a massacre. The children couldn't stop trembling from the overwhelming fear. Sylvester unconsciously reached for the pendant he received from his father, thinking it might help dispel the fear.

Simultaneously, as the men believed that using magic would draw attention to them, they lunged at Sylvester with knives drawn from their chests.

"!!!"

Charlotte, Octavia, and Max instinctively squeezed their eyes shut.

"Waaaah!"

Sylvester poured energy into the pendant.

And then...

"What? A barrier!?"

The men exclaimed in surprise.

The pendant that Sylvester possessed automatically deploys a barrier when it senses something approaching at a certain speed. However, it doesn't activate just because someone gets close.

That's because people wouldn't be able to approach if it did. So, to activate the barrier now, they had to manually activate the magical device.

Sylvester had recently learned how to use this magical device from Shin. He had been so delighted to receive this magical tool that he practiced using it over and over again. The result of that practice was now evident.

"Ugh! What the heck is this!?"

"Damn! Is that one of the Walford kids?! They're carrying a troublesome magical device!"

The men repeatedly swung their knives at the barrier Sylvester had deployed. Each time, there was a "clang" as the knives were blocked by the barrier. The sound and the sight of knives being drawn were terrifying, causing the children to desperately cling to Sylvester.

Sylvester knew that the barrier would disappear if he let his guard down, so he trembled with fear at the knives coming at him but desperately activated the magical device.

Someone, anyone, please help!

While deploying the barrier with the magical device, Sylvester realized that he couldn't counterattack or escape and prayed desperately in his heart.

"You damn brat! Get rid of this barrier already!"

"For heaven's sake, just accept that you're going to be killed!"

Frustrated by their inability to break the seemingly indestructible barrier, the men began hurling insults at Sylvester. Sylvester's heart was on the verge of breaking due to the verbal abuse, something he had never experienced before.

That's when it happened.

"Who are you planning to kill?"

A strangely calm voice echoed in the room.

Sylvester turned his head in surprise at the voice, which he recognized all too well.

And there she was.

"Mom..."

His mother, Cecily, was standing there. She smiled reassuringly at Sylvester's exhausted face and then turned to face the men again.

"Answer me. Who are you planning to kill?"

The sudden appearance of Cecily left the men momentarily flustered, but they quickly composed themselves. The person who had appeared was Cecily, said to be the Saint. She was a woman specializing in healing within the Ultimate Magicians, and she was currently pregnant, making her movements difficult.

The men thought that they could defeat her if it was Cecily who had appeared.

"Hehe, that's the Saint..."

"You and... those kids!"

With those words, both men charged at Cecily.

"Mom!!"

Their mother was always so kind. Even when they misbehaved, she gently scolded them and never got angry. She lovingly caressed her growing belly, smiled, and told them to protect it. Their beloved mother.

These thugs were attacking their mother. Sylvester couldn't help but scream, anticipating the worst possible outcome.

But...

"Huh?"

Sylvester couldn't believe his eyes.

A surge of magical power was emitted from Cecily, visible even to his eyes, which hadn't learned magic yet.

"What!?"

"Oh, my legs!"

The men who had screamed in this way found their legs frozen. Cecily had cast an ice magic spell in that split second.

Impressed, Sylvester looked at Cecily and saw an expression he had never seen before.

"Who... who are you planning to kill?"

"Ugh!"

In response to Cecily's emotionless voice and expression, the men involuntarily let out a scream.

Regardless of the men's reactions, Cecily approached them step by step.

"We might be one thing... but are you planning to kill the children? Silver, Charlotte, Via-chan, and even Max?"

While saying this, Cecily drew closer, her expression devoid of emotion, and her pupils dilated more and more.

She's angry! Mom is incredibly angry!

Seeing their mother's anger for the first time, Sylvester and Charlotte stared at Cecily's face in astonishment, forgetting their earlier fear.

"Don't come any closer!"

"Help us..."

The men, gradually freezing at their feet, pathetically pleaded with Cecily.

In response to their words, Cecily smiled gently, her pupils still wide open.

"I... won't... forgive you."

Saying that, Cecily released a surge of magic power and froze the men's entire bodies in ice.

"That's enough, Lady Walford!"

August, who had rushed to the scene just in time, stopped Cecily.

When addressed, Cecily slowly turned to face August.

"Why, Your Highness? These people were trying to kill my precious children!"

"I understand! I won't forgive them! But there are things we need to find out from them!"

August desperately tried to persuade Cecily.

Listening to August's words, Cecily closed her eyes and exhaled slowly.

"...Well, if there's no other way. Your Highness, please make sure to get the information, okay?"

Cecily said with a smile, and even August, as steadfast as he was, could only grimace and reply, "A-alright, leave it to me."

As Cecily dispelled the magic and melted the ice, the fallen men were immediately restrained. They grumbled with resentment.

"D-Damn! Why is the Saint so strong!?"

Upon hearing these words, August couldn't hide his exasperation.

"She specializes in healing magic, but her offensive capabilities are not that different from ours. Didn't you know that?"

"What?!"

The men, upon hearing August's words, were taken aback, as they hadn't heard such information before.

Subsequently, they were gagged, and the men were led away.

Meanwhile, Cecily, who had terrified the men to the core of their beings, turned her attention to Sylvester.

"Silver, are you okay? You did really well."

Saying that, she hugged Sylvester, who had become the hero of the moment.

"I-I... I..."

"Thank you for protecting everyone. You truly are everyone's big brother."

While Cecily spoke and stroked Sylvester's head, he burst into tears, releasing all the emotions he had been holding in.

"Waaaah!"

Sylvester, who rarely cried or acted spoiled, clung to Cecily, sobbing uncontrollably.

Cecily gently patted his back repeatedly to comfort him.

"It's okay, it's okay. Mama's here. Everything's okay now."

"Mom! Mommy!"

Seeing Sylvester, their usually reliable big brother, crying like this, even the younger children's tear ducts started to loosen.

"Waaah, I was scared, mommy!"

"Madam!"

"Waaah!"

Charlotte, Octavia, and Max also clung to Cecily, crying.

August watched them with a complex expression. "Via... your father is also here."

Octavia, who had just realized that her father was present, glanced briefly at August. However, she quickly returned to hugging Cecily.

"Oh dear."

Cecily smiled wryly and embraced Octavia again, even though she had assumed Octavia would go to her father, August. August mumbled, "Well, it was actually Lady Wolford who saved them," and decided to let Octavia do as she pleased.

Once the children finally began to stop crying, they started praising Cecily one by one.

"Mom, you were amazing!"

"Mom, you're so cool!"

"Lady, you were wonderful..."

"Auntie, you're awesome!"

Their tears from earlier had transformed into sparkling eyes full of admiration.

Cecily received their admiration with a smile. "Well, hehe, thank..."

However, Cecily suddenly clutched her belly and groaned.

"Mom!? What's wrong!?"

"Mom!?"

"Lady!"

"Auntie!"

The children panicked at the sudden change from her smiling face to one filled with pain.

"What's wrong, Lady Wolford!?"

Even August, typically unflappable, was alarmed. He couldn't help but wonder if the men from earlier had harmed her in some way. If that were the case, it could spell disaster for Shin.

However, it turned out...

"Ugh..."

"Ugh!?"

"Ugh... I'm... giving birth."

With those words, panic overtook the adults, including August.

"Someone! Get a doctor! Now!"

From the tone of his voice, it was clear that August was in a rare state of panic. Even the knights who had forcibly brought the doctor were in a significant state of panic.

Before the doctor had a chance to assess the situation, it was evident that Cecily's water had broken, and she was on the verge of giving birth.

"What are you all doing? Hurry, take the Holy Lady to the infirmary... No, the guest room!"

"Yes, sir!"

"And bring the Crown Prince Consort's personal female physician and midwife! Immediately!"

"Of course!"

"You and you, bring a stretcher! Gently carry the Holy Lady, do you understand?"

"Understood!"

The knights, who were utterly incompetent and useless, had no choice but to obey the doctor's furious orders.

After watching Cecily being carried out, the doctor turned to August with an exasperated expression.

"Goodness... what on earth were you and His Highness August doing?"

He criticized the Crown Prince, who was usually considered a treasure of Earlsheid, for being completely unhelpful.

"...You're right. It was the first time I've ever witnessed a scene where a woman was in labor, so I was thrown off."

"Well, when it comes to childbirth, women tend to handle it better than men. It's a fact that many men are helpless when faced with a woman in labor... Were you told to fetch a doctor?"

"Ugh..."

"How flustered were you..."

Even the doctor couldn't help but chuckle at the rare mistake of the usually competent Crown Prince.

"No... well, I thought that Lady Wolford might have been harmed by those bandits. If that happened..."

August couldn't continue speaking, as he was too terrified of what might come next.

Even without words, the doctor understood.

"I see... it's no wonder you were so flustered."

While they were discussing this, a voice interrupted.

"Uncle! Is Mom okay? Is Mom okay!?"

"Uncle Oug... Is Mom...?"

Their daughter and son, who were tearfully witnessing Cecily collapse, approached August with anxious expressions.

There was no way that children wouldn't be concerned when their mother collapsed right before their eyes.

August, who had neglected these children in his panic, finally realized his mistake. He knelt before Charlotte and Silvester, making eye contact with them, and gently stroked their heads to reassure them.

"It's alright. There are skilled doctors and midwives in the royal castle. You don't need to worry. Just focus on the baby brother or sister who will be born."

"But..."

"Mom looked like she was in pain..."

Despite August's words, the siblings still appeared concerned. August decided to resort to a last-ditch effort.

"Besides, I'm going to contact Shin right away... your father, so he can come right away."

As soon as he said this, the children's mood changed.

"Dad! We'll feel safe if Dad's here!"

"Father... I'm glad..."

Although their own words didn't ease their anxiety, knowing that Shin was coming made them completely relieved.

August, who was amused to see his siblings transition from being anxious to happily talking about Shin, had his clothes tugged.

"Hmm?"

August followed the direction of the tugging, and there was Octavia. Her expression was indescribably sharp.

"Father... You look uncool."

"Grr..."

Although August felt utterly defeated by Octavia's single comment, he couldn't retort since he was aware of his lack of composure. With drooping shoulders, he took out a wireless communication device to contact Shin.nd a dish
