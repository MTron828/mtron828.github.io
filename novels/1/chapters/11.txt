to explore the nightlife scene in Bangkok

I parted ways with Sicily and Maria, and returned home.

"Welcome back, Master Shin," greeted Alex, the gatekeeper. Although there were several other gatekeepers working on a rotational basis, Alex was the winner of the previous staff competition for gatekeepers, making him the head of security.

So, there's a competition for staff positions!

"I'm back, Alex."

"Master Shin, do you have to go out on foot? I worry for your safety, and I..."

"It's okay, I had a little run-in with some thugs in town earlier, but there was no problem."

"Thugs! Did you engage in such a dangerous activity?"

"That's why I said it's okay. As long as the opponents aren't stronger than Michelle, there's no issue."

"Michelle... the former Knight Order Commander..."

"Yes, that's right. So, don't worry so much. Thanks for your hard work."

"Very well..."

Phew, the staff members are overly protective. I used to deal with wild animals in the forest not long ago. Well, I appreciate their concern, though.

Upon entering the mansion, the butler, Steve, welcomed me.

"Welcome back, Master Shin."

"I'm back, Steve."

"Just a moment ago, we received this from the Advanced Magic Academy."

"What is it? This?"

"It's your entrance exam ticket for the Advanced Magic Academy."

Oh, right, I was wondering what happened to Uncle Dis since he said, "I'll tell you later." He's been doing his job properly, it seems.

"I see. It feels like something big is about to happen."

"You don't need to feel pressured, Master Shin. You should be able to aim for the top spot."

Hmmm, from what Maria mentioned earlier today, I already seem to stand out, and I'm not sure if I want to draw even more attention. But if I barely pass, they might say something about me being the grandson of the old man. I also don't want to tarnish Uncle Dis's reputation.

Alright! Decision made! I'll give it my all in the exam.

"Understood. Thanks, Steve."

"No problem. Please do your best. The entire staff will be rooting for you."

And as the new year arrived, an exclusive New Year's party was held.

Truly exclusive.

Now, even if it's not that big, this is a school, so for someone coming here for the first time, it's still a reasonably large building. You don't know where everything is, so I'm searching for the examination room using the guideboard.

"Hey, move out of the way."

But wow, there are so many people. Are they really using all the classrooms for this?

"Hey! You there! Can't you hear me?"

Hmm, let's see... Ah, there it is.

"This ruffian!"

Someone grabbed my shoulder from behind. So, I grabbed the arm that was grabbing my shoulder and twisted it back to put them in a wrist lock. They've been making a ruckus for a while, what's this person's deal?

"Ugh! What are you doing? Let go!"

"Why have you been grabbing people's shoulders out of the blue?"

As I released their arm and asked, a blond, blue-eyed, cheeky kid glared at me.

"You! I am Kurt von Ritzburg!"

"?? Okay, I'm Shin."

He introduced himself suddenly. I wonder why?

People around us are chuckling. What's going on?

"You! I am the eldest son of the Count Ritzburg!"

"?? Oh, I see."

"You! Do you think you can get away with defying me?"

It finally dawned on me as he said that. Is this noble brat trying to flex his power on me? I didn't expect this to happen within a magic academy. But still...

"Hey, um, Kurt-kun, isn't it better to stop this? Isn't it strictly prohibited for nobles to abuse their power here? I heard there are severe consequences."

"Just a mere teacher at a magic academy has no right to judge me!"

He's making provocative statements. Didn't Uncle Dis mention something about being charged with treason?

Is this getting a little tricky? As I was thinking about it, someone from the side spoke up.

"That's enough."

"Wha... Who are you?"

Who might you be?

"At the Advanced Magic Academy, using one's power to harm other magicians is an act of stifling the potential of talented magicians. Those who break this rule will face severe punishment. This should not only be part of the school regulations but also a law established by the royal family."

"Th-that..."

Oh? Kurt-kun suddenly got quiet. Could this person be a higher-ranking noble than him?

"Or perhaps your earlier statement was an act of rebellion against the royal family?"

"N-no, I didn't mean that!"

"Then cease causing a commotion. This is the entrance examination site. Do not disrupt everyone's peace."

"Ha... ha, understood."

And then, he gave me a resentful look and walked away.

Why?

"That was quite something. Are you okay?"

"Huh? Oh, I'm perfectly fine. I didn't even notice at first because I didn't expect someone at the magic academy to act like that."

"Heh, returning that self-introduction was a masterpiece."

A high-ranking noble-looking boy was laughing happily. He's about the same height as me, around 175 centimeters. His hair is a sandy blond, and he has blue eyes and fair, almost translucent skin. He's a strikingly handsome young man.

"By the way, even though the Advanced Magic Academy doesn't tolerate noble arrogance, in practice, most people tend to become intimidated when faced with it."

"Yeah, well, I'm not in a position of authority, and I don't think it's appropriate to call that intimidation. It doesn't have much impact."

"Hmm, as they say, it seems you're quite detached from this world."

"As they say?"

To whom?

"Oh, right, I haven't introduced myself yet. My name is August. August von Arlsheid. Those close to me call me 'Oug.' Shin, I've heard various things about you from my father."

"Huh!? Wait, does that mean you're Uncle Dis's son?"

Oh? The people around us went silent.

"Hehe, Uncle Dis's son... It's the first time someone called me that way. Once people know I'm a prince, they start to flatter me right away."

"Well, you see, I always thought of Uncle Dis as a relative, like a cousin or something. So, saying 'Uncle Dis's son' makes me feel like we're more like cousins."

"Hehehe, hahaha!"

They burst into laughter.

"I see, I see, cousins. When my father told me about you, I had a strange feeling. Even if you're called my cousin, it doesn't feel out of place. In fact, I quite like that idea. So, we're cousins."

"I'm glad you're happy about it."

"Haha, it's finally nice to meet you. I'd like to talk more... but we should probably head to the examination room soon, right?"

"Oh, right! We need to go now."

"Well then, let's both do our best. Maybe we'll meet again at the entrance ceremony?"

"Haha, I'll do my best for that to happen. By the way, feel free to come visit our house sometime?"

"As the prince who is about to undergo the Crown Prince's Ascension Ceremony soon, I can't just go out and about casually."

"Is that so? Uncle Dis visits us all the time."

"Father..."

With that, I parted ways with the dejected August and headed for the examination room.

Shin, Kurt, and August were surrounded by onlookers, and among them were Maria and Sicily.

"Hey, I finally thought I found Shin, and why is he being bothered by that guy?"

It seems Kurt had just approached him.

"Oh, is Shin all right..."

"That guy is like a walking embodiment of elitism... I hope it doesn't lead to any trouble."

These two seemed to know about Kurt.

"Huh? Wait a minute! Isn't that...?"

"Could it be, Your Highness August!?"

Then, August stepped in, diffusing the situation, and the onlookers dispersed to the examination room.

While riding the wave of the crowd, Maria and Sicily continued their conversation.

"I wonder who Shin is, really?"

"Yeah, I've never seen August have such a good time talking with anyone."

"Yeah."

"But more importantly... the problem is that guy. I never expected him to come to this academy."

"That's true..."

"Listen, Sicily. If anything happens with that guy, you need to tell someone immediately, okay? No, even if nothing happens, you should still tell someone."

"Even if nothing happens..."

"Well, how about this! Sicily, just stay with Shin! If you say you're being followed by a nasty guy, he'll definitely help you out. He's strong and doesn't even flinch in front of nobles and even royals!"

"But... it would definitely be a hassle for him."

"It's fine. I'm sure Shin isn't the type to abandon a girl in distress. I became convinced of that after what happened the other day. He might even willingly protect you, don't you think?"

"But it feels like... they're prying into Shin's kindness..."

"True, they are, but Shin is a good guy, I believe. But you're more important to me."

"Maria..."

"Plus, if you're together, your relationship might develop!"

"What? Wait! Enough!!"

Unbeknownst to Shin, the girls had a plan in motion.

After that, I took the written exam at the examination site. It was packed with people as I expected.

It's over.

What more can I say about the written test?

And then, the practical exam began.

The test took place in an indoor practice area, and the goal was to destroy the targets set up. Even if you couldn't destroy them, it seemed they would assess your magical control. Examinees entered the indoor practice area in groups of five, and each person demonstrated their magic one by one.

I was the last in the group of five.

The first person was handing over their examination ticket and citizen card to the examining teacher.

The examining teacher was a woman with black hair that reached her shoulders, wearing a black robe and glasses. If she had worn a black suit, she would have looked like a secretary.

"Now, release your most powerful magic to the best of your ability."

"Yes! Thank you very much!"

Oh, it's the first magic from someone my age. I wonder what kind of magic they'll use?

"Burning flames that consume everything! Gather in my hands and strike down the enemy!"

"Fireball!"

Boom!

Phew.

Embarrassing! What was that? Is that how incantations work? And on top of that, "Fireball"? It's so clich√©! It looked flashy until it was fired, but its effect was weak! And why the smug expression?

This is bad. I thought I'd give it my all to meet everyone's expectations, but if I go all out, I'll definitely be looked at strangely. I should refrain from giving it my all.

And the exam continued.

"Raging water currents, gather and dance to sweep everything away!"

"Water Shoot!"

"Wind, dance! Wind, sway! Create a gust of wind that will calm everything!"

"Wind Storm!"

"Mother Earth, lend me your strength! Become gravel to repel the enemy!"

"Earth Blast!"

Ugh... this is tough... what is this chuunibyou performance?

Just listening to it is bringing back memories of my cringeworthy past...

Unbeknownst to anyone, I was suffering a mental blow. After the previous four people had finished, it was my turn. Now, what kind of magic should I use?

"Now, next is..."

The examining teacher momentarily widened her eyes upon seeing my examination ticket and citizen card.

"You... I see. Well then, it's usual to say 'use your most powerful magic to the best of your ability,' but in your case, let me give you a special warning."

A warning? Why?

"You can use magic with the power to destroy that target. Please be careful not to use magic that would destroy this practice area."

...Uncle Dis, what kind of conversation did you have?

Feeling somewhat down about receiving special treatment, I took my designated position.

Now, the target had a shape resembling a mannequin with no arms or legs. It seemed reasonably durable, having withstood previous magic attacks. And since new targets were provided each time to ensure fairness, they probably weren't using particularly expensive ones. In that case... that should do it.

I produced a single small pale-blue flame without an incantation. The fact that I manifested this phenomenon without an incantation created a stir in the surroundings. I then molded it into a slender shape and shot it like a bullet.

The high-speed shot of the pale-blue flaming bullet traced a line through the air before being absorbed by the target.

Boom!

The target exploded with a deafening noise. The flame bullet that had shattered the target continued undiminished and hit the back wall. Uh-oh.

Kaboom!

It struck the magic barrier on the wall, causing the entire practice area to shake violently. When everything settled, the reactions of those around were nothing short of stunned. Would I get scolded for this?

"May I ask one thing... did you use your full power for that magic?"

"No? I held back quite a bit because the teacher told me not to destroy the practice area."

"D-Did you hold back quite a bit with that?"

"Yes."

"...I see. Understood. The exam is over now. Everyone, good work."

Phew, I got away without getting scolded.

Relieved, I forgot to look for Maria and Sisily and went back home.

Oh no! What am I doing?

All the exams were over, and the teachers gathered at the magic academy.

"Was he really that amazing, the 'Wise Man's Grandchild'?"

"It wasn't amazing at all. He held back considerably, and I thought the practice area would be destroyed with the magic he considered as light."

"S-So much?"

"Yes, and he cast it without incantation. It was also fired in an instant."

"Hey, do we have anything to teach him? Actually, we should be the ones wanting to learn."

"I feel the same way. His Majesty also mentioned that he enrolled to learn how to interact with people. During class, he can serve as an example for everyone, and then in the research lab, we can create a place for socializing and teach him how to interact with people."

"Oh, that sounds good. In the research lab, even if we come and go, it won't be suspicious."

"That's true. Shall we go in that direction?"

"Yes. By the way, how did he do in the entrance exam?"

"I saw the written exam. It's still being graded, but it seems like he got almost a perfect score."

"In that case..."

"Yes, this year's 'top of the entrance exam' has been decided."a database schema
