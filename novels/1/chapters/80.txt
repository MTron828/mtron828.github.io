It's still early in the night before the operation begins, in the late hours of the night, to be exact.

At that time, they were awakened by the news that demons had started to move.

"What's going on!? Just a moment ago, they didn't show any signs of action at all!"

Og, who had jumped out of the tent, confronted the soldiers outside.

"Well, I don't know! I heard the sounds of battle coming from the town, and then there were explosions... After that, it seems the demons began to gather in one place in the town!"

"Sounds of battle!? No way! Did someone jump the gun!?"

"Well, I don't know!"

Listening to the soldier cornered by Og's questions, they realized something. Come to think of it, there was someone who wanted to gain recognition for demon subjugation.

"What about Darm's commander!? Is Ralph here!?"

"Darm's commander?"

"Yeah, according to Darm's soldiers, Commander Ralph wanted recognition for demon subjugation. I can't believe it, but..."

"Damn! Did he actually take action!? Hey!"

"Yes!"

"Go to Darm's tent! We're heading to the town first!"

"Understood!"

Watching the departing soldier, they prepared for battle.

"We're running out of time. Shin, use levitation magic to fly to the town!"

"Got it!"

Activating the levitation magic and lifting everyone, they each activated wind magic and quickly flew to the town.

To think something like this would happen in the most critical moment...

They flew through the sky, hoping that the demons hadn't left the town yet.

Soldiers instructed to investigate Darm's commander's tent from August first visited the commander of Isth, who was like a spiritual homeland.

Even though they were told to investigate the tent, the other party was a commander of a nation. It was a heavy task for an ordinary soldier.

So, they thought of asking the commander of Isth, who had a kind of mental alliance with their homeland, to investigate Darm's tent.

"What did you say!? Darm's Commander Ralph!?"

"His Highness August seems to think so..."

"I see. It's His Highness August, there must be some basis for this. Hey! Let's go to Darm's tent!"

The commander of East, accompanied by a few subordinates, headed towards the tent designated for Darm's commander.

Upon reaching the tent, it was closed tightly amidst the commotion in the camp.

Darm's soldiers were also looking perplexed at the absence of their commander.

"Hey! Where is Commander Ralph!?"

"W-Well, he... he hasn't come out of the tent..."

"What!?"

The East commander became convinced that August's concerns were nearly accurate.

"Hey! Commander Ralph! Are you there!?"

He called out loudly, but there was no response.

"Open it!"

After a brief word, the East commander stepped inside the tent.

"Ugh!"

"W-What is this!?"

The first thing they noticed upon entering the tent was the overpowering smell of blood. Upon examining the source, they found the bodies of several slain soldiers left behind.

Among the bodies, Ralph was nowhere to be seen.

"What... What in the world happened here!"

"I don't know, but... the fact remains that Commander Ralph is not here. We should temporarily take over Darm's command in this situation."

"You're right... Unraveling the truth can wait. Demon subjugation is the top priority, and East will temporarily assume Darm's command. Inform Darm of this."

"Yes!"

"Nevertheless... why are there bodies in this tent?"

This was a tent meant for Darm's commander.

Why were there bodies here?

The story goes back a bit...

Long before Shin and the others took action in the early night, Ralph and his group had slipped out of the camp to carry out demon subjugation. To avoid suspicion, they had gradually gathered in the tent from the evening.

When they all gathered and were about to take action, one of the soldiers raised his voice.

"Wait a moment, Commander Ralph. Perhaps, this action should be stopped."

"What? Are you... defying the will of the Creator God, the god of the Church!?"

Ralph, who already believed that their actions were the will of the gods, looked at the soldier opposing him as if he were a heretic.

"That's not it! But I don't think this is the Creator God's will!"

"What...!"

Ralph shook with anger.

"Although their titles are unacceptable, their abilities are genuine! We should entrust this to them and avoid needlessly provoking the demons!"

"Yes! Please reconsider, Lord Ralph!"

"Lord Ralph!"

A few soldiers raised their voices to stop Ralph and were so desperate in their persuasion that they neglected to pay attention to their surroundings.

"I see... Fine."

"Lord... Ralph!"

Ralph accepted their arguments. The soldiers who had opposed demon subjugation breathed a sigh of relief.

However...

"I understand. You are not needed."

"Lord Ralph?"

Just after Ralph said this...

"Gah!"

"Lord Ralph... What are you..."

"I told you, you're not needed."

"Lord Ralph, no... Gah!"

The soldiers who were still trying to speak were mercilessly impaled by the soldiers around them.

Ralph Portman was a highly respected figure within the Darm Kingdom, known for treating everyone fairly and without discrimination.

He probably never imagined that he would commit such an atrocity.

"Opposing the will of the gods and trying to interfere with our actions as the messengers of God. You are heretics."

"S-Such... we never... like that..."

"Quiet."

"Lord Ralph, please..."

The soldiers who had tried to speak were pierced one by one by the surrounding soldiers.

With expressions of shock and sorrow, the soldiers who had appealed to stop the demon subjugation were all killed.

As a result, there was no one left in the tent who opposed Ralph's actions.

"Damn! Picking a fight right before the expedition... well, never mind. Let's go."

"Yes!"

With no dissenting voices, Ralph informed everyone left behind to head out for the subjugation.

In this camp's night watch, personnel are assigned in pairs to the connecting parts of magical tools. However, this is not for both individuals to be on alert simultaneously; it's meant to allow one person to rest while the other is on guard duty.

The role of the night watch includes guarding the camp's perimeter, but it also involves continuously channeling magical power into magical tools that repel creatures. Without periodically switching, one cannot sustain channeling magical power into the magical tools all night, so pairs are assigned.

Moreover, the idea that someone might try to leave the camp altogether was entirely unexpected.

Under orders to go to bed early, Ralph and his group quietly moved away from the camp, slipping through the completely unguarded night watch, and made their way out of the camp.

The group of about fifty people who successfully slipped out of the camp headed towards the town where the demons had gathered.

Based on the reconnaissance team's report, it had been confirmed that there were no sentinels or guards in the town.

Upon reaching the town, the city walls had been considerably damaged, possibly due to the wrath of the demons, and there were gaps through which they could easily infiltrate the town.

Despite being clouded by fanatical devotion, they were still the commanders of a nation's army. Thus far, everything had gone according to plan.

The problem lay ahead â€“ how to actually subdue the demons. Ralph, however, hadn't trusted Shin's report, believing that defeating the demons would be straightforward.

Upon infiltrating the town, Ralph's group used a mage's reconnaissance magic to locate the positions of the demons and moved to that location.

In this town with many ruined buildings due to the demons, it was rather convenient for them to hide.

Ralph, feeling that even this was guided by the will of the gods, grew increasingly confident in the success of the demon subjugation, and decided to initiate the attack on the demons.

Observing the situation from a collapsed building, they saw the demons engaged in conversation.

From those demons, Ralph could not sense the overwhelming magical power described in Merlin's tales, even from the magic users. He concluded that these demons were not as formidable as they were made out to be and were being exaggerated to enhance their accomplishments.

This judgment caused the words "mission abort" to completely vanish from Ralph's mind.

Ralph's group finally prepared to strike. The targeted demons showed no signs of noticing.

Ralph was now completely convinced of success.

He waited for the right moment to strike, while concealing their presence.

And then...

(Go)

Ralph gave the command for the attack through hand signals.

As magical attacks would give away their surprise, soldiers wielding swords emerged from the shadows of the buildings.

The soldiers who rushed forward swung their swords at the demons without hesitation.

However, just when it seemed the soldiers' swinging swords would reach the demons, one of the demons turned and caught the sword with their bare hand.

"What the...!?"

The soldier shouted in astonishment.

The demon who had caught the sword with their bare hand grinned.

"Hehehe, you thought you could sneak into the town with such a large group and not get caught?"

"Your magical power is pathetic, by the way. Do you really think you can defeat us with that?"

The demons had been aware of Ralph and his group since the moment they entered the town, even though they believed they had gone unnoticed.

In other words...

"L-Lord Ralph! There are demons all around... all around us!"

"W-What...?"

"All those guys hiding there, they know about it all!"

Ralph and his group were completely surrounded by the buildings they had thought to use for cover.

What Ralph and his group had forgotten was that they were originally humans who could control magic.

And they had the will to control magic.

This led the demons to make a mistaken judgment about the group's weakness.

"Man, they were so scared of us that they wasted time, and now the humans have found out about this place."

"Why is that guy acting like a leader?"

"You know, he was the one who first defied Strom, right?"

"Let's blame him for getting us exposed to the humans and try to pull him down from the leader position. We've been stuck here for months because of him."

"That's right. But before that..."

The demons who were expressing their dissatisfaction among themselves suddenly turned their attention towards Ralph and his group.

"Ah..."

"First... we need to get rid of them."

Ralph and his group were surrounded by the group of demons.

Those surrounded felt despair.

Those surrounding them felt pleasure.

Both expressions were evident.

And then...

It wasn't a battle between demons and soldiers, but rather a one-sided massacre of humans by the demons.

"What are we going to do now?"

After finishing the massacre of Ralph and his group, the demons began discussing their future actions.

"Bring that guy who acts like a leader. If we show him the situation, we can blame him for exposing this place."

"That makes sense. Just wait a moment."

"Seriously, come over here... Acting like a superior and thinking the underlings should deal with the trouble."

The demons, who had been stuck in this place for a long time, had built up frustration and now felt a sense of excitement as they anticipated a change in the situation.

Their realization was that if humans had discovered this place, it meant that human forces were approaching. And among them were Shin and his group.

The reason they had stayed in this location was because they had been thwarted twice by Shin and the Ultimate Magicians, an unconventional human group. The second time, they had even been ambushed, which had made the leader of the demons hesitate to take further action. Although the ambush was entirely accidental, the demons felt a significant threat from Shin and his group.

For these demons, who had not received proper education and had not developed logical thinking, it was unimaginable that Shin and his group might be nearby.

After a while, the leader of the demons arrived and looked down at Ralph and his group's bodies.

"What! Human soldiers!?"

The appearance of the leader demon had a profound impact when he realized that humans had been in this location.

"That's right. Because you were dilly-dallying, the humans found this place."

"Why are you talking so calmly? Do you understand what this means?"

The leader demon was annoyed by the statement, which showed a lack of understanding of the gravity of the situation.

"Oh? It's just because of you that the humans found this place, right? Take responsibility."

"Are you seriously talking about that now? If the humans found this place, then isn't it possible that they're also here?"

"These guys haven't attacked us for a while, so they probably aren't here."

"Do you not understand anything I'm saying? You idiots!"

"Oh? You're blaming your own mistake on us?"

"Enough! I'm getting out of here! You should run too!"

"Don't mess around! If you want to run, do it on your own. We're going to conquer the world just like this."

"Kuh! Do as you please!"

With the demons who seemed unable to comprehend anything, the leader demon and a few others decided to leave the scene.

"What's with them... being such cowards."

"Well, it's fine. This means that they've retreated. They won't have their arrogance anymore."

"That's true. All right! Let's get started on conquering the world with the new demon army!"

"Hooray!"

With this, they could once again dream of world conquest. Unlike when Ralph and his group had infiltrated, they were now exhilarated about the future.

As a result, they had neglected their surveillance using scouting magic. It was when they had renewed their determination for world conquest...

A powerful magic spell rained down from above.

Upon receiving reports that the demons had started moving, we rushed towards the city. What we saw were demons gathered in one place, shouting something.

"What's going on? What are they doing?"

"It's definitely intriguing, but we don't have time to think about it. Let's keep moving!"

"So, does that mean..."

"We'll go straight through the front. It might be a trap, but we'll crush it all!"

"Understood!"

The demons had gathered conveniently in one place.

I thought we might miss the chance to capture them, but it turned out to be an opportunity!

"The demons are gathered in one place. Don't miss this chance! We must annihilate them!"

"Hooray!"

"I'll deactivate the levitation magic! Get ready with the jet boots!"

"Go!"

With the open-channel wireless communication device, Ogh gave the command, and everyone responded. I deactivated the levitation magic.

From here, each person would use jet boots to move freely while engaging in battle.

At Ogh's command, a simultaneous barrage of fire bullets, ice spears, wind blades, and lightning strikes was unleashed upon the demons.

"Ugh! W-what's happening?"

"Oh no! It's them! They've come!"

"Why are they here?"

"Enough complaining! Counterattack!"

The demons, unable to escape because they had been gathered in one place, reacted differently this time, launching a counterattack.

"Whoa! Watch out!"

"This guy!"

Alice defended herself against the incoming magic using her magical accessory and her own magical barrier. She also retaliated with a magic attack.

Similar scenes were unfolding in various places, but providing defensive magic-imbued accessories had been a good idea. While the demons' magic couldn't penetrate her doubled barrier, the magic from the team members was significantly weakening the demons' barriers.

Although they hadn't completely penetrated them yet...

"Sorry from behind."

"What!? You...!"

Tony struck the desperate demon from behind with his vibration sword.

This time, Julius and Ogh had also joined the close combat group.

The same strategy of holding the demons at bay with magic while closing in for close-range attacks, which had been employed in the Kingdom of Swid, was being executed here.

While everyone was successfully subduing the demons, what was I doing?

"Damn it! I can't keep up with this!"

"You think you can escape?"

"Ugh..."

I had left the battle area to deal with demons trying to escape. Starting from the outskirts of the city, we gradually narrowed the encirclement, and from the beginning, the demons had gathered in this formation. I didn't know why, but I couldn't let the demons escape from such a great opportunity. Everyone seemed to understand this and continued to cast spells with all their might.

"Damn, what power!"

"Are you only focused on that side?"

"What...argh!"

As the number of demons diminished, not only the close combat team but also those who had been defending against the demons with magic began to subdue the demons from different angles with magic.

"Take this!"

"Hiyah!"

Even Cecily and Yuri, who weren't particularly skilled in offensive magic, did their best to cast spells and defeat the demons.

These demons were truly nothing special. Perhaps it was because they were mass-produced demons, but it seemed like we could easily eliminate them. All that remained was to find and defeat Strom, and the situation would be resolved quickly.

"Damn! Damn it! I finally obtained power! All because of that guy!"

"That guy? What is he talking about?"

As we wondered, the demon who had been speaking was struck by someone's magic.

The demon's collapsing form and the words he had just uttered froze me in my tracks.

"Uh... it's all because of Strom's incompetence..."

"Strom's fault?"

I rushed over to the fallen demon to find out the truth. Even though so many of his subordinates had been defeated, Strom was nowhere to be seen. The city was in chaos with magic flying everywhere, making it impossible to detect Strom using conventional scouting spells. However, Strom's malevolent and ominous magic was unmistakable.

And then the words the demon had just uttered, "Strom's fault."

Could it be...

"Hey! Where's Strom!? Is he not here!?"

I grabbed the collar of the severely injured demon using magic, demanding to know Strom's whereabouts. My voice echoed loudly in the city, which had fallen silent after we eliminated all the demons.

"Hey, Shin. What's going on?"

"This guy said something that caught my attention. Hey! Is Strom here or not!?"

The demon, gasping for breath, responded to my question.

"That... useless... how could he... be here... someone... who would be... satisfied... just by... destroying the empire... like that..."

"Satisfied just by destroying the empire? Hey! Then why did you attack the neighboring countries?"

"For world conquest... it's obvious... as long as you're not there... as long as... you're not..."

With these words, the demon turned his gaze filled with resentment towards us.

Strom was satisfied with just destroying the empire. But the demons attacked the neighboring countries.

And Strom was not present here.

Could it be...

"You guys... have had a falling out?"

The demon reacted strongly to those words.

"Damn it! If that bastard was here! If you guys weren't here! Everything would've gone perfectly!"

Saying this, the demon suddenly began gathering magical power.

It seemed like he wasn't converting that magical power into magic.

This is bad!

"Deploy magical barriers and retreat at full speed! He's planning to make his magical power go wild!"

A self-destruct!

Maybe because their ambitions had crumbled, he was trying to self-destruct and take everyone down with him.

Ogh, realizing this, instructed everyone to retreat.

However, if I allowed him to self-destruct here, it would blow away the bodies of what seemed to be Commander Ralph's men that had gathered near the demons.

To prevent this, I swung my Vibrationsword, as I did with Kurt, before it went berserk.

"Idiot! Shin, run!"

But...

"Shin-kun! No!"

I couldn't make it in time.

Magical power went berserk, causing a massive explosion that engulfed the surroundings.

Ah, darn it! I couldn't make it!

I remained unscathed thanks to the magical barriers and the effects of my combat gear. However, the demons we had defeated and the bodies that appeared to be Commander Ralph's men had all been blown away.

As the smoke cleared from the explosion, I regretted my failure. Nevertheless, I changed my mindset, realizing that what happened couldn't be undone, and decided to use scouting magic to search the area for any surviving demons.

Soon, I detected a response coming towards me.

"Shin-kun!"

It was Cecily. I was relieved to see she was unharmed.

"Are you okay, Cecily?"

"Are you okay? No! Why do you always take such reckless actions!?"

Cecily was very angry, and rightfully so.

"Well, I thought if he self-destructed, it would blow up a lot of things..."

"Even so! First, prioritize your own safety, please! If something were to happen to you, I..."

Oh no, I made Cecily cry!

I tried to comfort her as the others gathered around.

"Good grief... It's certainly not good that we can't recover the bodies, but it's even worse if something happens to you."

"Sorry..."

"In the end, everything got blown away."

"That's right..."

I couldn't confirm it, but there were probably some bodies that looked like they were the vanguard of Commander Ralph, who seemed to have rushed ahead. We couldn't recover those bodies either, and all evidence of their premature actions was gone.

In the end, I only worried Cecily and the others for nothing...

"Well, more importantly, if what that demon said is true, the situation is over."

"Strom had nothing to do with the attacks on these neighboring countries, it seems."

"I see. Strom's goal was likely just to destroy the Empire. Dissatisfaction with that might have caused some of them to defect. That would explain this series of clumsy attacks."

"What do you mean?"

"Did I mention that every time Strom attacked the city, there were more demons?"

"Yeah."

"Probably, he transformed the common people into demons. And those civilians turned demons might have defected."

I see.

Unlike in Arlsheid, the Empire's commoners are not given an education. They lack the wisdom to plan strategies, so they kept launching attacks haphazardly. After two consecutive failures, they probably didn't know what to do next.

"Now that I understand, it's a pretty ridiculous reason..."

"Under normal circumstances, the plan for world conquest would still have succeeded. But you were here. That was their misfortune and our luck."

Og blushed and said something serious.

What's that all about? He's usually teasing, but he's suddenly so serious.

"As for handling Strom... He doesn't seem interested in anything other than the Empire, so he'll probably negotiate a non-aggression agreement and be done with it."

"Is that okay? What about the things he did in Arlsheid?"

"If he were a regular human, I'd want to hold him accountable for his crimes. But he's the leader of willed demons. It's not wise to provoke him; it could endanger the world again."

"...So we're prioritizing the big picture over the small one?"

"That's right. Well then, should I go tell everyone that we defeated the demons?"

After saying that, Og walked toward the outskirts of the city.

I guess there's no helping it. This is no longer a matter of personal crimes; it's on a different level.

I finally released Cecily, who had stopped crying, and we followed Og.

"At last, it's over."

"Yes, it's great that everything has been resolved."

By the way, once this commotion is over...

"Next is... the wedding."

"Eh!? Oh, y-yeah, that's right!"

I've been told by Eileen that we should have a wedding after this commotion is over.

We still don't know what will happen with Strom, and the ceremony will have to be prepared and adjusted for the arrival of Pope Ekaterina. So it'll be a little while, but once this demon commotion is over, the next major event will be the wedding.

"A wedding... a bride..."

Leading Cecily, who was starting to trip, we headed outside the city.

There, members of the allied forces had gathered.

"Listen, everyone! We have successfully defeated all the demons who were hiding in this city!"

Og declared using amplifying magic, and the cheers that followed felt like an earthquake.

"Although we couldn't find Oliver Strom, who was presumed to be the leader of the demons, we have now learned the reason for his absence. With this, the commotion comes to an end..."

"Please wait!"

Just as Og was about to declare the conclusion, a scout interrupted.

"What's wrong?" Og asked.

The amplifying magic still made his voice loud and clear.

"I have a report! A few minutes before Your Highness and the others launched an attack on the demons, we confirmed the presence of a figure breaking away from the demons."

"What? What do you mean? How many?"

"It was too fast to be sure, but we believe it was probably three figures."

"Darn it! And then? Which way did they head?"

"That way!"

The direction the scout pointed to was...

"That direction... isn't it towards Arlsheid?"

The commotion was not yet over.
