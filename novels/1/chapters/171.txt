 airplane turbulence
to someone who has never flown before

When we reached the airspace above Arleshide, we made a U-turn, and that's where I handed over the controls to Aaron.

What I realized there was that it was impossible to simultaneously operate by flowing magic into both the control stick for lift and the propulsion lever. According to Aaron, if you flow magic into one, the other would lose power. He said it required a highly skilled magician to operate this way, sounding quite frustrated.

Despite how we may look, we all graduated from the Arleshide Academy of Magic, so we can activate multiple magical tools simultaneously.

We also had the pilot who was traveling with us take control, but the constant alternation between floating and propelling, creating a bumpy ride, made everyone on board feel nauseous.

In the end, we concluded that it required two pilots, and we reached out to those who were next in line for the pilot selection.

When we returned to Els and landed in our original location, I overheard a conversation between Aaron and the pilot. I decided to make a suggestion.

"In that case, how about using magistones?"

"Magofu? Shin, what are you talking about?"

"Well, I..."

As I was about to make my suggestion, I received a powerful punch to my side.

Thanks to that, I probably seemed like quite the oddball.

I glared at the direction the impact came from, but my grandma was giving me an even more intimidating stare.

I quickly looked away, and then my grandma pulled on my ear and led me away from the crowd.

"Ouch, hey, grandma, that hurts!"

Ignoring my protests, my grandma continued to pull me along. It wasn't until we had walked far enough away that I could barely hear any conversation that she finally let go of my ear.

"What's the matter, grandma..."

"Quiet! Didn't you try to suggest using magistones just now?"

"Well, yeah, but..."

"I knew it. Listen, Shin, it's true that thanks to your discovery of how to create magistones, their distribution has increased. However, they are still a scarce resource."

"I understand that, but..."

"No, you don't. Certainly, as you said, with magistones, even one person can pilot that airship. But what will you do when the magistones run out?"

"Well, then we can use spare magistones."

"What if you can't secure enough spare magistones?"

"...Wait, are they still that rare?"

As I said that, my grandma let out a deep sigh.

"You can make magistones yourself, so you might not know. The frequency of magistones in circulation has increased compared to before, but once they hit the market, they sell out quickly."

"Is that so?"

"That's because magic tool craftsmen are eagerly waiting for magistones. Besides, it's a flying vessel, right? If you can't obtain spare magistones but have to depart for trade, what happens when the magistones' effects run out?"

"...A crash."

"If you fall from such a height, there's no chance of survival. Everyone on board would die."

Upon hearing those words, a chill ran down my spine.

Indeed, it was a vehicle meant for trade. If it were powered by magistones, it was entirely possible that it might set sail before enough magistones were ready. All for the sake of profit. In that case, the worst-case scenario my grandma mentioned was entirely conceivable.

...Sigh, I really lack foresight.

I could only think of dealing with the immediate problem for now.

"For now, it's better to fly that airship with manpower, even if it requires more people. It's just a makeshift solution, and we can continue to improve it."

"...Yeah. I understand. Thanks, grandma."

"Well, it's a grandmother's duty to set her grandchild straight, after all."

After expressing my gratitude to my grandma, she seemed a bit embarrassed. Come to think of it, as my grandpa mentioned before, my grandma doesn't readily accept compliments, does she? Is she a tsundere?

Putting that aside, since my grandma's lecture was over, I decided to return to where everyone else was.

At that moment, I asked my grandma something that had been on my mind.

"Hey, grandma, you're not against building the airship, are you?"

"Well, yes. It's stated in official documents that we won't use it for anything other than trade with Quanlong, so I don't object to that."

"Then why did you come along? Just to see the airship?"

"That's part of it, but..."

My grandma said that and looked at Aaron.

"One word, just wanted to make a point."

"A point?"

"It's about this. Look, Silver is looking at us with a puzzled expression. Go to him already."

"Oh, okay."

With that, I was freed from my grandma's grip and returned to Sisily and Silver.

Upon my return, Silver reached out his hand to me.

As I received Silver from Sisily, she asked me a question.

"What was your grandma talking about?"

"Huh? Oh, I wanted to suggest using magistones for the airship's propulsion, but she stopped me and explained the reason."

"Is that so?"

"Yep, grandma's amazing. She's way better at foreseeing the future than I am. Ouch, ouch!"

While I was talking to Sisily, I suddenly felt a sharp pain in my ear. Silver, whom I was holding, was pulling on my ear.

"Oh, no, Silver! You can't pull on daddy's ear!"

"Huh?"

Sisily hurriedly removed Silver from me, but Silver pointed to a person in the distance with a puzzled look.

"Grandma."

Over there, my grandma was having a conversation with Aaron. She's imitating my grandma!

Seriously, how much of a grandma's boy have I become?

"Come on. Silver probably doesn't like having his ears pulled either."

Sisily said that as she lightly tugged on Silver's ear.

But, because it was so light, Silver, who thought it was a form of affection, unexpectedly became happy.

"Kyah! You mischievous little one!"

Elated, Silver reached for Sisily's ear this time.

It seemed that Sisily found it ticklish, as she let out a short scream and then looked at Silver with an angry expression.

It's heartwarming.

In the midst of this, someone called out to me.

"Um, Lord Shin."

"Hmm? What is it? Shaolin-san."

"I'm sorry for interrupting your family time. There's something I wanted to ask about... It's regarding the magical enchantment from earlier."

"Oh, yeah... I'm sorry, but I've kept it a secret for now, so I can't provide more details."

"I see. I understand. I'm sorry."

"No problem."

With that, Shaolin-san retreated gracefully.

"What's up? I thought you were going to ask me to make a magic tool..."

"You surprisingly backed down quite easily."

"Yeah, I wonder what that was all about?"

"I don't know..."

As Sisily and I tilted our heads in confusion, Silver protested.

"Mama, food!"

Oh, it's already lunchtime. Silver, with an empty stomach, is requesting a meal.

I'm hungry too, so for now, let's call it a day for our maiden flight. Since the control is relatively simple, we can increase the number of pilots and have them conduct test flights repeatedly.

With that in mind, I went to speak to everyone.

"Aaron, can I have a word?"

"Yes? What is it, Master?"

Merida, who had separated from Shin, approached Aaron, who was discussing the reselection of pilots and test flights with the nation's dignitaries.

"How did the discussion over there go?"

"It's all finished. So, what's up?"

"Come with me for a moment."

"Uh, sure..."

Reluctantly, Aaron followed Merida, recalling the memories of being summoned for lectures in the past.

After walking a short distance, Merida stopped and faced Aaron.

Seeing her stance, Aaron straightened up nervously.

Merida gave a wry smile at Aaron's tense demeanor.

"No need to be so nervous. I didn't call you here to complain about this matter."

"Is that so..."

With a sigh of relief, Aaron's anxiety leaked out.

"Creating the airship was ultimately for your benefit, I suppose. But it ended up helping that girl Shaolin. There's nothing to complain about."

"Thank you."

Aaron was somewhat moved, as he hadn't received many compliments from Merida before.

"Besides, you also reached out to Sisily to help that girl's sister with her illness, right? I assume it's to improve your future relationship, but it's a commendable decision to help someone in need."

"Well... I've been president for a long time, so I can handle that much."

"As someone who knows the you from the past, who was a bit of a fool, that alone is quite moving."

"F-fool...?"

"But, well, I didn't come here to talk about that."

"Huh?"

Aaron, who had been moved by the praise, suddenly blinked away his welling tears.

"I'm here to drive a point home."

"A point... a big one?"

"I didn't oppose this discussion just for Els' benefit. If it had been solely about Els' interests, I would have opposed it. But when it involves helping people, there's no way I could object."

"Well, I thought you might say that, Master."

"You've spent a fair amount of time with me, so you should know about those things."

"Yes."

"But what about the others?"

"..."

To Merida's question, Aaron couldn't provide an answer.

"This time, Shin casually created something like a flying vehicle, something that was only found in fantasies. If we can recreate such a fantastical vehicle, don't you think others might consider it too? Especially the Els merchants like you, driven by profit."

"I can't say that it's impossible..."

"I thought so. That's why I'm driving the point home. It's understandable that Shin, acting on his own will, created something. I've almost given up on that."

"...Even you, Master?"

"I've finally realized that it's pointless to tell that kid anything. She just makes what she wants herself, without even considering how far it deviates from common sense."

"She really is quite unconventional..."

"Absolutely. I'm almost tempted to ask the academy what her time there was for. There are plenty of things she's made but can't release to the public."

"What!?"

Aaron eagerly responded to Merida's words, but he quickly fell silent under her piercing gaze.

"I said she can't release them. I mean it, can't. If we did, it would cause chaos in various places."

"Well... you've had your share of troubles, Master..."

"Indeed..."

Merida responded with a deep sigh to Aaron's comforting words.

"That's the kind of child she is. If she's asked to create something like this, she'll easily do it. And once that's done, she'll move on to the next thing."

"It's easy to imagine that future."

"So, that's why I came on this trip. This time, after extensive discussions with you, Shaolin, and our highnesses, we decided to request Shin's help, right?"

"Yes."

"In the future, whenever you ask for Shin's help, make sure to go through these steps. I won't allow individual merchants to approach Shin for transactions."

"..."

"Well, I'm just Shin's grandmother. I know I don't have the authority to enforce such things. Nevertheless, Shin is my grandson. I'll have my say."

"Y-yes..."

"If you're dissatisfied, you can send assassins or whatever you like. Just be prepared to face the consequences."

Merida said this, smiling at Aaron.

"I'll give them a taste of their own medicine."

The expression on Merida's face as she said this was a chilling grin.

Seeing that expression, Aaron was deeply shaken.

In the world today, the term "hero" referred to Shin and the Ultimate Magicians. However, Merida, despite being an older hero, was still an active one. Aaron came to realize this deep within himself.

"I-I will make sure to enforce it..."

That was all Aaron could manage to say.

Satisfied with Aaron's response, Merida displayed a more ordinary smile.

"I'm counting on you."

Seeing her expression, Aaron finally breathed a sigh of relief.

Then, due to his sense of relief, he couldn't help but make a careless remark.

"Nevertheless, you're still a doting grandmother."

"What!?"

"Eek!"

As soon as he said it, Aaron regretted his words. It wasn't the right time to bring that up.

He braced himself for the scolding he was about to receive, but surprisingly, Merida didn't say anything of the sort.

"Hmph. Right now, I'm more like a 'great-grandchild doting' person. That child... Silver is obedient and adorable... He's my treasure."

In fact, she had a gentle expression while watching Silver playing with Shin and Sisily. Seeing that expression, Aaron couldn't help but feel surprised.

"I've never seen that side of you, Master. You've always shown a stern face to Shin, and to that guy... Slaine."

Upon hearing Aaron's words, Merida briefly displayed a somewhat melancholic expression, but she quickly regained her composure.

"Even for Shin, even for that child, in their infancy, I used to show them a gentle face. You just didn't know."

"Well, when you put it that way..."

"That's why I want Silver to grow up as a normal child, not a nonconformist like Shin. However, I also want to give him the means to protect himself from becoming like that. That's my current top priority."

"I see..."

With mixed feelings, Aaron and Merida watched Silver, who was being scolded by Sisily while having his ear pulled.

Merlin had been with them all along but remained silent.

"Leifan, have you noticed?"

"Yes, Miss."

Shaolin spoke to Leifan away from the others, and Leifan immediately realized that this was a conversation she didn't want overheard. In the same words, Leifan replied.

As Leifan expected, the content of Shaolin's conversation was sensitive and not something to be heard by others.

"The enchanted characters that Shin used. Those... they looked like ancient characters that haven't been used in our country for a long time."

The characters she was referring to were the ones Shin used when he enchanted the flying boat earlier.

Shaolin and Leifan were taken aback when they saw those characters.

How did they know about those characters?

They desperately wanted to ask, but if enchanted magic itself was considered a secret, there was no way they could ask further.

Nevertheless, they wanted to find out.

"Those characters... they resembled the ancient characters that no one in our country uses anymore. Why can Shin from this western country use them?"

"I don't know, but objects enchanted with ancient characters still outperform modern ones."

"Yes, but I really want to find out that secret..."

As Shaolin said this, she looked at Shin, who was playing with Silver.

"I wonder if he would tell us the secret willingly..."

"...What do you think?"

This muttered exchange didn't reach anyone except Leifan.
