Chapter 1002: Girls Should Be Cute

“I’ve already stated my condition. Miss Shen, you’d better go and talk to Madam Mo. As long as she’s willing to agree to my request, I can fulfill it anytime. If Miss Shen doesn’t have anything else, I’ll take my leave first. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Oh right, you’re a guest. Treat today’s coffee as my treat.”

Just then, a waitress walked past their table.

Qiao Mianmian called the waitress over.

The waitress knew who she was and asked politely, “Miss Qiao, what can I do for you?”

Miss Qiao was Chairman Mo’s girlfriend.

Chairman Mo’s first girlfriend in over 20 years.

Whether she could marry into the Mo family or not.

Just based on her unique personality, they couldn’t afford to neglect her.

Moreover, she might even be lucky enough to marry into a rich family. Although the story of Cinderella was just a fairy tale, it wasn’t impossible in real life.

Hence, it was necessary to be polite.

Qiao Mianmian picked up her cup and finished the last mouthful of coffee. She put it down and said, “Miss Shen’s expenses at the Mo Corporation are free today. Go to the counter and say that. Don’t let Miss Shen spend too much.”

The waitress was stunned. He looked at Shen Rou’s dark expression and hesitated for a few seconds before replying respectfully, “Yes, I’ll talk to the counter immediately.”

Qiao Mianmian picked up her bag.

She looked at Shen Rou’s dark expression and smiled. “Miss Shen, I hope you can consider my suggestion seriously. I’ve already made my condition clear. If you don’t think you can do it, don’t look for me anymore.

“I only have one condition. Whether it’s now or in the future, it won’t change.

“Oh right, the desserts here are pretty good. I suggest that Miss Shen give them a try. You’ll feel better if you eat more desserts. You’ll also be cute when you’re in a good mood. Girls should be cute.”

The waitress was shocked by Qiao Mianmian’s words.

He even stole a few glances at her.

Looking at Shen Rou’s expression, she felt that her face was a little distorted.

She didn’t seem like a woman now.

Her expression was scary.

Qiao Mianmian smiled and left.

She’d only taken a few steps when she heard a “Bam!” and the waitress’s panicked voice. “Miss Shen, are you alright?”

Qiao Mianmian turned around.

The cup of coffee in front of Shen Rou had fallen to the ground.

The cup shattered, spilling coffee all over the floor.

...

Not long after Qiao Mianmian left the cafe, Shen Rou also got up and left.

The two of them entered and left one after another.

And when they left, one was smiling, while the other’s expression was dark. It made people wonder what they’d been talking about.

When Shen Rou left, the waitress immediately joined the girls and they started gossiping excitedly.

“Wow, don’t you guys think that Chairman Mo’s girlfriend... look like an obedient and gentle fairy?”
