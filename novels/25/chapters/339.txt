Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

The hustle caught the attention of all the passers-by.

It was a pretty big deal to see two actresses fighting each other.

Especially when one of them was Qiao Anxin, who was hot news these days.

Some of them were already taking out their cell phones to record this scene on video.

In the changing room at a golf course.

A young man changed into his sports attire and then walked out with a 40-odd-year-old man.

“I’ve heard about how good Director Zhang is at golf. I’ll finally get to witness it today.”

They got to the golf course.

The young man took a golf club from one of the employees. He then bent over and tried out the swinging motion.

The older man beside him took a club as well and said, “It’s been more than a year since I last played. I’m afraid I’ll lose to you today, Chairman Su.”

“Director Zhang is too humble.” Su Ze smiled kindly and went on with some civilities. “It wouldn’t take more than a few balls for Director Zhang to get back your momentum. Director Zhang, please show mercy later. Don’t let me trail too badly.”

“Hahaha.” Director Zhang swung his club, and the golf ball landed right in the hole.

Su Ze immediately applauded and exclaimed, “You said you’ve lost it? You must be invincible if you were in your top form, then.”

“There’s always someone better out there. I’m really not that good.”

“Oh?” Su Ze was a little shocked. “There’s someone in the industry who plays better than Director Zhang? You’re referring to...”

Director Zhang swung the club again and scored another hole in one swing before handing his club to the employee.

He took a sip of water and then said with a smile, “It’s a young man. He’s pretty impressive. I played with him once. I would’ve lost terribly if he hadn’t shown me mercy. Well, the young will surpass us someday.” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Su Ze and Director Zhang had worked together for many years, but this was the first time he’d heard Director Zhang praise someone this way.

He got curious.

“This young man Director Zhang is talking about... do I know him?”

“It’s the newly appointed Chairman of the Mo Corporation. Chairman Su, have you worked with him before?”

Su Ze was a little stunned.

The Su family did have some dealings with the Mo Corporation. But to the Mo Corporation, they were but small deals.

It didn’t require him to speak directly to the Chairman.

Hence, he never really had the chance to work with him directly before.

He did hope to have an opportunity to do so. But given the gap between the Su and Mo families, it wasn’t up to him to get to know Chairman Mo personally.

“Director Zhang, you must be kidding.” Su Ze smiled. “Given Chairman Mo’s status, not everyone has the chance to deal with him directly. I heard that he’s a young Chairman, only 20-odd years in age. Is that true?”

“Mm. He’s very young, indeed.” Director Zhang said, “He’s very good-looking and has a unique charisma and aura. He really is the son of the greatest beauty out there. I’d say he’s the most outstanding of this generation of businessmen.

“He’s flawless in terms of appearance and capability. Although he’s young, he’s a pretty impressive chap who’s managed the Mo Corporation well so far.”

Su Ze kept silent for a while as a strange glint flashed in his eyes.

Hearing the person Director Zhang described led him to think about the man he saw at the private clubhouse.
