Chapter 54: Did Mo Yesi Not Date Before?

“I, I don’t use any perfume.” Being held by him like this, she blushed and said shyly, “Mo Yesi, let me go.”

Several maids stood in the dining room.

They were full of shock and envy at this scene.

This unidentified young lady seemed to be very much loved by the young master.

Although she looked very beautiful, she was still very young and was still a student. They really didn’t expect that the young master would like this little girl.

Mo Yesi not only held onto her, but he also clutched her jaw and rubbed on it gently. His voice deepened as he said, “You hugged me all night last night, so why can’t I hug you now?”

Qiao Mianmian’s eyes widened. “I... last night...” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Yes.” Mo Yesi caressed her cheek with his fingertips and whispered softly, “You were like an octopus, entangling me and refusing to let go. You slept sweetly, but I didn’t sleep at all last night.”

Qiao Mianmian blushed even more.

She was so tired yesterday that she had fallen asleep in his car.

She didn’t remember anything after that.

The thought of the two fo them sleeping in the same bed overnight made her heart rate accelerate.

She felt fortunate that she had fallen asleep early yesterday, so she didn’t have to face the embarrassment of sleeping in the same bed as him.

She blushed and asked, “These clothes...”

“Of course I changed it for you. You are my woman, so only I can look at you.”

“You, did you change it for me?” Qiao Mianmian’s eyes widened. Her face seemed to be burning and her entire face was red.

“You’re shy again?” Mo Yesi pinched her jaw and looked at her coquettish look. He couldn’t help but smirk and chuckle. “Why are you shy so easily? Baby, I’m your husband. Isn’t it normal for me to change your clothes?”

“Mo Yesi, stop talking...”

As he said these words that made her blush and her heart beat faster, Qiao Mianmian felt like her face was almost burning.

Especially when he called her baby, she felt even more bewitched, and even her innermost feelings had turned soft.

Right now.

Qiao Mianmian seriously doubted whether the words Uncle Li told her were true.

Had Mo Yesi never dated before?

Then how was he so flirty?

A woman who had been in love before was already so bewitched by him and couldn’t even stop her heart from beating faster.

“Baby, do you know what I want to do now?” Mo Yesi got closer to her. His warm breath spilled into her ears and he lowered his voice. “I want to...”

His words could only be heard by the two of them.

Qiao Mianmian was so provoked that her heart felt like it was going to burst.

She raised her head with watery eyes. “Mo Yesi, I’m hungry, I want to have breakfast.”

At this time, the maid brought Qiao Mianmian’s breakfast.

There were Chinese food, Western food, and various fruit pastries. In short, it was very sumptuous.

Mo Yesi didn’t intend on letting her go.
