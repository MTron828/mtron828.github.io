Chapter 746: I Will Change Whatever You Don’t Like

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

What was the difference?

Mo Yesi probably thought about these two things as well, and his expression turned unnatural. He coughed lightly and said, “That guy with the surname Tu really has bad intentions. You should stay away from him.

“Alright, I think I understand what you mean. I’ll slowly change it in the future, alright? Qiao Mianmian, I know that many things about me aren’t so likable. If you don’t like it, I’ll change it. But, give me some time.

“I’ll change it. I’ll change whatever you don’t like.”

Mo Yesi was a possessive and controlling man.

He was already very restrained in front of Qiao Mianmian.

If he revealed his true self to her, she might be scared off.

Just what he was showing now was enough to make her feel pressured and tired.

How could he dare to let her know that he had already restrained himself a lot?

The man was practically begging her.

Qiao Mianmian looked up and was touched by his cautious and nervous expression.

This was Mo Yesi.

He’d grown up with a silver spoon in his mouth, and only others begged him. He couldn’t possibly beg anyone, and he didn’t have to beg anyone.

But now...

But he was being so humble and begging her.

When had he begged anyone like this?

She didn’t like him to be too domineering and possessive.

But if he didn’t care so much about her, he wouldn’t even look at her when he was cold and aloof.

Was it wrong to care about someone?

Could she control herself if she liked someone?

Qiao Mianmian’s heart softened.

Yes, she knew what kind of person he was when she first met him.

His personality was developed from a young age.

He’d been like this for over 20 years, how could he change so quickly?

She had to give him time.

He had to give himself time.

“Alright, I promise.”

She looked at him, and the coldness in her eyes faded a little. She reached out and gestured for him to lower his head.

Mo Yesi did as he was told.

Qiao Mianmian reached out again and placed her soft hands on his handsome face. She stroked his well-defined brows and high nose bridge and finally landed on his warm and soft lips.

She looked up and met his eyes. After a few seconds of silence, she said softly, “Mo Yesi, can you promise me something too?”

The man looked at her deeply and nodded. “Alright, go ahead.” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

No matter what she requested, he’d agree to it.

Did he ever reject her whenever she asked something?

Even if she wanted the stars in the sky, he would find a way to get them for her.

“You’re not allowed to be so impulsive in the future.” Qiao Mianmian frowned slightly as she recalled his actions just now. She couldn’t help but sigh. “Mo Yesi, since I’m already married to you, I’m your wife. From now on, the only person I like is you.

“I can’t promise what others think, but I can promise this.”

The man’s eyes lit up when he heard her say “like.”

“So, don’t always worry about me being taken away by someone else. Don’t you have confidence in yourself? Do you think that any man can beat you in terms of charm?”
