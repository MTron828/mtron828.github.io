Chapter 2067: I Think You Can Give It a Try

“I have evidence here to prove that Qiao Anxin is behind this. Sister Xie, can you get someone to do it?”

“Of course. If you have concrete evidence, we can do it too.”

“Alright, I’ll send you the document.”

After hanging up, Qiao Mianmian sent the document to Linda.

Linda received it and sent her a WeChat message after 10 minutes.

Linda: [I’ve finished reading it. Your evidence is very complete. I’ll get someone to do it. This time, we have to make sure Qiao Anxin doesn’t turn over. Otherwise, she’ll cause trouble in the future.]

Qiao Mianmian had no objections.

She was already tolerating Qiao Anxin on account of Father Qiao.

Initially, she didn’t mind that Qiao Anxin was up to no good.

But Qiao Anxin didn’t think so.

Qiao Mianmian felt that she didn’t have to worry anymore.

After all, Qiao Anxin was most likely not Father Qiao’s daughter.

Without this relationship, Qiao Mianmian couldn’t think of a reason why she had to tolerate her.

Qiao Mianmian’s cell phone rang again.

It was Bai Yusheng.

She picked it up. “Brother.”

“Mianmian, do you remember when I brought you to see Mo Nan?”

Mo Nan?

Qiao Mianmian quickly recalled.

Bai Yusheng had brought her to see Mo Nan when she was still filming in F City.

Back then, Mo Nan even said that he wanted to create an album for her.

After Qiao Mianmian left F City, she didn’t have much contact with Mo Nan.

Bai Yusheng said, “The new show is about to start airing, but the opening theme and the interlude have yet to be done. I mean, do you want to try? Mo Nan said he wrote two good songs, very suitable for my new show.

“He hasn’t found a suitable singer yet. I think you can give it a try.”

Qiao Mianmian hesitated.

Bai Yusheng continued, “If you agree, we can go over and try it out today. Mo Nan said that he thinks you’re very suitable to sing those two songs.”

“Can we come back today?”

Mo Yesi wanted to have dinner with her.

She’d already missed the appointment last night.

She couldn’t possibly go back on her word.

She felt like she’d gone overboard.

“Of course. It’s just a test, it won’t take much time. If you’re suitable for the songs, the official recording definitely won’t be today.”

“Alright.”

Qiao Mianmian agreed. “Then, let’s go now and come back early.” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Bai Yusheng chuckled. “You want to come back so soon. Have you made an appointment with my brother-in-law? Are you afraid that you’ll delay your date?”

She didn’t have anything to be shy about with her brother, so she admitted it directly. “Mm, I’ve already made an appointment with him for dinner. I’ve already gone back on my word today, so I can’t let him down tonight.

“Otherwise, he’ll be angry.”

“Alright. Then come back early. Do you want me to pick you up or…”

“No need, let’s meet at the airport.”

“Alright.”
