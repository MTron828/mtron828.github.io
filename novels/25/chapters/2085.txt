Chapter 2088: That Means That You Care About Me

“Chairman Mo.” Wei Zheng turned around and said apologetically, “I really didn’t expect Assistant Yang to be so persistent.”

“I told her that Chairman Mo wouldn’t see her again, but she still…

“Chairman Mo, this is my mistake. If Chairman Mo wants to punish me, I’ll accept it.”

Wei Zheng didn’t expect Assistant Yang to be so thick-skinned.

He had made things clear enough, but she still came to look for Chairman Mo.

Moreover, Young Madam was present.

No wonder Chairman Mo was so angry.

If Young Madam misunderstood and got upset because of this, things would become serious.

Mo Yesi looked at him coldly. “It’s not entirely your fault. Forget it this time. If something like this happens again, I won’t let you off.”

“Yes, Chairman Mo.” Wei Zheng wiped the cold sweat off his forehead. “I promise this won’t happen again.”

“Replace Assistant Yang.” Mo Yesi frowned.

“Yes, Chairman Mo. I’ll call Chairman Chen immediately.”

Ding!

Mo Yesi’s private elevator arrived.

Mo Yesi didn’t say anything else and led Qiao Mianmian into the elevator.

Wei Zheng wiped the cold sweat off his forehead.

Damn.

He was almost harmed by Assistant Yang.

In the elevator.

Mo Yesi looked at Qiao Mianmian, who had been silent the whole time. After a while, she still didn’t ask him anything.

He couldn’t hold it in anymore.

“Baby, don’t you have anything to ask me?” he asked.

Qiao Mianmian looked up at him. “No.”

Mo Yesi was speechless.

“Really?”

Qiao Mianmian thought about it seriously and shook her head. “No.”

“…”

Qiao Mianmian looked as if nothing had happened, but Mo Yesi was not so calm. He frowned. “You don’t need me to explain?”

“Explain?” Qiao Mianmian blinked at him. “You mean… about Assistant Yang?”

Mo Yesi replied. “…Mm.”

Qiao Mianmian thought for a while and said, “Didn’t you already explain it to me? She’s just someone doing business with you, nothing else. I know she’s interested in you, but I also know that you’re not interested in her at all. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“So, I don’t need you to explain anything to me. And I know that you didn’t even allow her to look for you. She insisted on coming up to see you. This isn’t your fault. I’m not such an unreasonable person.

“Even if I was jealous, I wouldn’t be so unreasonable.”

Mo Yesi kept quiet for a while before sighing.

“Baby, I hope you can be unreasonable and jealous of me.”

He wished that she wasn’t as calm and rational.

She was too calm and rational, making him feel that she didn’t care about him enough.

Because he could be calm and rational in everything except for things related to her.

Unless he didn’t care enough about her.

Qiao Mianmian was stunned. “If I act unreasonable with you, won’t you find me annoying?”

“No.” Mo Yesi rubbed her head. “I’ll be happy. That means that you care about me.”
