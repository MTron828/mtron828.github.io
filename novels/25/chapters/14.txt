Chapter 15: Give You Everything You Want

Recalling last night, his eyes became more intense as he stared at her.

As Qiao Mianmian met his eyes, her heartbeat sped up and she started to panic.

The man’s eyes were full of obvious desire and possession as if she was already in his pocket.

She even had the illusion that he had already grasped everything in his hands and had known that she would come to him today.

“Mr. Mo.”

She bit her lip and was silent for a moment. Then, she looked at him and said, “You can ask for anything other than marrying me...”

Before she finished speaking, he said coldly, “Then we have nothing to talk about. You can go.”

Qiao Mianmian clenched her fists.

She stood still.

Mo Yesi did not drive her away.

Both of them were silent.

After a while, Qiao Mianmian took a deep breath, her voice trembling. “If I marry you, will you help me with the surgery?”

Mo Yesi narrowed his eyes. “You agree?”

Qiao Mianmian smiled bitterly. “Isn’t that what Mr. Mo asked? As long as you can cure Chen Chen, I... I’ll marry you.”

Looking at her bitter and helpless smile, Mo Yesi frowned, showing an unhappy expression on his face. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

He walked up to her.

He reached out and pressed his hands lightly on her weak shoulders, his deep black eyes deep with seriousness. Word by word, like a promise, he said, “Marry me. I promise you won’t regret it. I will do whatever I can to give you all the affection you want, and we’ll share everything.”

They got a marriage certificate quickly.

At the Civil Affairs Bureau, there were people waiting to receive them outside.

They had special services and within a few minutes, the marriage certificate was ready.

They came out of the Civil Affairs Bureau.

Qiao Mianmian looked at the small red book in her hand, stunned.

She felt like she was dreaming.

Did she... just get married?

She had imagined it millions of times and had expected it millions of times. But she didn’t expect it to occur under such circumstances.

After getting in the car.

Qiao Mianmian looked as if she was dreaming.

Beside her, her new husband Mo Yesi turned his head and glanced at her. “Qiao Mianmian, don’t look like you’ve lost something. You married a rich and beautiful man, who will give you all the honor and affection you want in the future. You didn’t lose anything.”

Although the marriage was apparently intentional, he was still very uncomfortable looking at her depressed face.

Qiao Mianmian listened to him and turned her head.

The man’s side face was also extremely handsome. His eyes were half-squinted, and the texture of the black shirt neckline button was unbuttoned to reveal his sexy collarbone.

In the backlight, his handsome features became deeper and deeper. His rolling Adam’s apple was sexy yet exuded a strong sense of abstinence.

She had to agree that he looked very good.

Moreover, he was also rich.

At first, she had thought he was a senior at the Mo firm.

But now she knew he was much more prominent than she had thought.

He was the President and the sole heir of the top giant firm.

The Su family could also be regarded as a prestigious family in Yuncheng, but ten Su families were still no better than one Mo family.

Objectively speaking, in this marriage, the person who had taken advantage was indeed her.

The disparity between them was too big. They belonged to two different classes that shouldn’t have contact at all. Even if he was looking for a wife, he should have been looking at a lady from a prestigious family, not an ordinary person like her.

Thinking of this, Qiao Mianmian pursed her lips and said nothing.
