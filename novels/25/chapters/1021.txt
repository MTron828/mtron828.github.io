Chapter 1023: She Didn’t Agree to Move In!

It would be such a pity if such an outstanding man like Mister never got married.

Sister Lin had been worrying for many years. As Mo Yesi got older, she got more and more worried.

Sometimes, she couldn’t even sleep.

Now that Mo Shixiu had finally brought a woman back, how could Sister Lin not be happy?

She knew Mo Shixiu’s personality.

He had never been in a relationship, nor had he had any experience with women.

Although the conditions were good, Sister Lin was worried that Jiang Luoli wouldn’t like his boring personality.

After all, girls liked romance and sweetness.

And Mister was obviously not good at this.

As someone who hoped that he would be able to marry soon, she had to help him whenever she could.

She wanted to settle Mister’s marriage as soon as possible.

Jiang Luoli blushed at Sister Lin’s blunt words. As a tomboy, she looked a little shy.

Seeing her like this, Sister Lin decided to strike while the iron was hot. “Mister values Miss Jiang more than this. He even got someone to rush to decorate Miss Jiang’s room today. You should know that Mister is usually very busy, but when he decorated Miss Jiang’s room today, he was always there to watch.

“This is the first time I’ve seen Mister spend his time on other things. Only Miss Jiang has such treatment. Because of Miss Jiang, Mister has been coming home more frequently.

“In the past, this used to be an empty house. Mister rarely came back.”

“Is-is that so?” Jiang Luoli didn’t know if Sister Lin was telling the truth, but she could feel her heart racing.

“That’s right. You don’t even know how long it has been since Mister came back. As you know, he’s busy with work all year and spends most of his time outside. It’s already good enough that he comes back once or twice a month.

“But after knowing Miss Jiang, Mister has been back for the past few days.

“Although he didn’t say it, if not for Miss Jiang, why would he suddenly come back so frequently? Thanks to Miss Jiang, this house is finally not as empty as before.

“When Miss Jiang moves over, Mister will definitely stay here often.”

When she met Mo Shixiu that time, Jiang Luoli didn’t feel that he cared much about her.

In her opinion, he treated her pretty well that night.

He felt like he owed her.

He only wanted to make it up to her.

But now that Sister Lin mentioned it, Mo Shixiu seemed to really like her.

Jiang Luoli was a newbie in relationships.

Mo Shixiu was someone she admired. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

How did it feel to be liked by her idol?

Even though she felt that Sister Lin might have misunderstood Mo Shixiu’s behavior, her heart still pounded.

“Miss Jiang, Mister will be back a little later. He instructed us to treat you well. Miss Jiang, do you want to take a look at your bedroom now? Mister arranged it personally, you’ll definitely like it.”

Jiang Luoli was speechless.

She never agreed to move in!

Mo Shixiu was too domineering.

She didn’t want to look at the room, but she couldn’t bear to reject Sister Lin’s expectant gaze.
