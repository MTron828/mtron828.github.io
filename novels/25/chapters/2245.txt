Chapter 2247: Qiao Mianmian, We Meet Again

But now that Lin Huizhen and Qiao Anxin had left Father Qiao, and she and Qiao Chen couldn’t stay by his side, Father Qiao suddenly became alone. Qiao Mianmian felt pity for him.

His wife had betrayed him, and his daughter wasn’t his.

This was a terrible blow to anyone.

Qiao Mianmian was still worried about Father Qiao’s health.

Hence, she would visit him whenever she was free.

She bought some nutrients and fruits and got Uncle Li to send her to the hospital.

…

Renxin Hospital.

In Father Qiao’s VIP ward, a tall and slender man was standing by the bed.

In the vase on the bedside table was a bouquet of fresh carnations and some expensive supplements.

Father Qiao rested his head on a pillow and looked at the man by the bed gratefully. “Young Master Gong, you’re too polite. I’m already very honored that you came to the hospital to see me. Why did you buy so many things?

“These things are pretty expensive, aren’t they?”

“They’re not worth much.” The person standing by the bed was Gong Zeli. He said calmly, “Who would visit a patient empty-handed?”

“Anyway, thank you very much, Young Master Gong.” Father Qiao was very polite. “I’m really sorry, I don’t have anything to entertain Young Master Gong here. Please take a seat first.” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“No need.” Gong Zeli’s expression was cold, and his voice was emotionless. “I have something on. I’ll leave in a while.”

As he spoke, he looked around, then looked back at Father Qiao. “Has no one come to see you? Where’s your wife? Why isn’t she with you?”

Father Qiao’s expression changed.

He held it in for a while before saying, “Young Master Gong, something happened in my family. But you can’t spread it. Forgive me for not being able to tell Young Master Gong what happened. Actually, someone has been here recently. Mianmian comes to see me often.”

Gong Zeli’s expression changed slightly at the mention of Qiao Mianmian.

“Qiao Mianmian comes to see you often?” He took a deep breath and asked calmly.

“Yes.” Father Qiao nodded. “Mianmian is a very filial child. She even called me just now and said she was coming to see me.”

Gong Zeli’s eyes flickered. “She called you just now? She’s coming to see you today?”

“Yeah, she’ll be here soon.”

Gong Zeli kept quiet for a while and then turned around.

Father Qiao thought that he was about to leave, but then he sat down on the sofa.

Father Qiao was stunned.

At this moment, the door was pushed open.

Gong Zeli held his cell phone tightly and slowly turned around.

His gaze met Qiao Mianmian’s.

When she saw Gong Zeli inside Father Qiao’s ward, she was stunned for a while and thought something was wrong with her eyes.

Or perhaps she had entered the wrong room.

“Mianmian, you’re here.” Father Qiao finally smiled when he saw her. Seeing that she was staring at Gong Zeli, he immediately introduced him. “Mianmian, this is Young Master Gong. You should know him.

“Young Master Gong, this is…”

“Old Master Qiao, I know Miss Qiao.” Gong Zeli looked at Qiao Mianmian and smiled. “Qiao Mianmian, we meet again.”
