Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Nana pointed a finger at her. “Then, what are you? This is the set, not a place for you to throw a tantrum. Mianmian isn’t a vixen, you’re the vixen.”

The woman in pink was also a rich girl.

She was like a high school gangster.

How could she tolerate Nana scolding her like this?

Her expression changed as she reached out to slap Nana.

However, her hand was grabbed by someone.

Qiao Mianmian walked out from behind Nana.

The woman in pink’s face scrunched up in pain as she struggled to free her hand.

“Ah, it hurts. B*tch, let go!”

She struggled even harder when she saw who it was.

Qiao Mianmian sneered. After struggling for a while and seeing that she was crying from the pain, she let her off.

The woman staggered two steps back and almost fell to the ground.

Fortunately, Shangguan Qing held her.

After she steadied herself, she looked at her red wrist and gritted her teeth. “Qingqing, this vixen is too arrogant. You can’t let her off.”

Shangguan Qing couldn’t tolerate seeing her best friend being bullied like this.

She turned around and looked at Qiao Mianmian with a dark expression. “You’re just a newbie in the entertainment industry, how dare you be so arrogant? Do you believe that I can get someone to ban you with just one sentence?

“Do you think you can do whatever you want just because you seduced a few men with your looks?

“Do you know who we are?”

Qiao Mianmian looked at her coldly. “I don’t care who you are or why you’re here. Now, please leave immediately, or I’ll get someone to chase you away.”

“Are you crazy?” Shangguan Qing didn’t know about Qiao Mianmian’s background and only thought that she was a newbie who could be bullied easily.

Qiao Mianmian’s attitude was extremely arrogant.

She had to teach this arrogant vixen a lesson. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“You shameless woman, who gave you the guts to be so arrogant?! Do you know who I am? How dare you talk to me like this?”

Qiao Mianmian was expressionless. “Of course I know who you are.”

Shangguan Qing was stunned for a while before saying coldly, “Since you know who I am, why don’t you kneel and kowtow to Bao’er and me? If your attitude is good enough, I might forgive you this time.

“Otherwise, you won’t be able to bear the consequences!”

“It seems like Fourth Hospital’s door wasn’t closed properly, that’s why you came out. Nana, quickly call the hospital and tell them that their patient came to our set. Get them to arrange for someone to bring these two patients back.”

Nana cooperated. “Alright, I’ll call immediately.”

It took Shangguan Qing a few seconds to realize that Qiao Mianmian was calling them crazy.

Fourth Hospital was a very famous psychiatric hospital.

Qiao Mianmian was calling them crazy.

Both of them looked awful.

“B*tch, you’re courting death!”

Shangguan Qing was so angry that she wanted to hit Qiao Mianmian.

“You’re the one courting death. You dare to touch her?” Bai Yusheng suddenly appeared and grabbed her hand.
