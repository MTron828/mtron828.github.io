Chapter 338: Miss Qiao’s Temper Is Out of Control for Me

If they were looking at awards that she’d have to earn on her own accord, she surely wasn’t good enough.

Moreover, Qiao Anxin wasn’t obedient at all and wouldn’t act according to her manager’s plan for her career progression. How was she going to groom her this way?

If she continued to stay in Star Splendor, she’d definitely only have Qiao Anxin alone under her wing.

But she couldn’t see any more hope in Qiao Anxin.

“Linda, did you hear me!”

A high-pitched voice rang out by her ear, snapping Linda out of her daze. She looked up and saw Qiao Anxin’s angry glare, and then heard her instruct her as if she was a housemaid, “If you can’t even get such a simple thing done, then don’t be my manager anymore!

“I don’t need such a useless manager!”

Qiao Anxin’s attitude was already bad usually, but she’d never gone this far.

This time, she’d lost all rationality after being angered by Qiao Mianmian.

She completely embarrassed Linda.

Linda was a highly-regarded manager in the industry, after all.

Su Ze himself had to put in a few kind words to get her to groom Qiao Anxin alone and no one else.

But now Qiao Anxin was calling her a useless manager.

She’d been tolerating Qiao Anxin all this time only because of Su Ze.

But she couldn’t deal with this any longer.

The moment Qiao Anxin said that she saw Linda’s face darkened. Linda’s attitude and tone changed, and she was no longer as polite as before. “Qiao Anxin, I’m your manager, not your subordinate. Watch your tone.”

“W-What did you say?” Qiao Anxin was stunned for a few moments before her expression turned awful. “What’s with you, do you have to be so fierce? You’re the one who has to watch your tone, not me. I’m your Lady Boss.

“Are you supposed to be talking to your Lady Boss like this?”

“Lady Boss?” Linda finally understood why Qiao Anxin had never treated her like a manager. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

She’d been seeing her as a subordinate all this while.

Linda smirked. “Qiao Anxin, if I remember correctly, you’re not married to Chairman Su yet, are you? If so, how are you my Lady Boss?”

Linda didn’t see a need to mince her words any longer.

She couldn’t tolerate Qiao Anxin’s terrible temper.

She was bent on giving up this job, even if Su Ze was offended by her decision.

As a highly-regarded manager, it made no sense for her to put herself through all this because of Qiao Anxin.

“Linda, what do you mean by this?” Qiao Anxin could tell that Linda was planning on calling this partnership off. Otherwise, she wouldn’t have used such a tone.

Linda eyed her directly. “Miss Qiao’s temper is out of control for me. If you think I’m useless, then get Chairman Su to find you a useful manager. We can end our partnership here.

“I will let Chairman Su know about this personally. I believe that Chairman Su will be able to find an excellent manager for Miss Qiao, one who will act according to all your wishes. But since we’ve been working together for so long, I see a need to offer you some advice. Whether you want to internalize it or not is up to you.”

Qiao Anxin was dumbfounded.

She’d never imagined that Linda would have the guts.

She was Su Ze’s woman, the future Lady Boss of Star Splendor.

Was this small fry not afraid that she’d have Su Ze fire her right away?
