Chapter 491: You’d Better Not Be Thinking of Getting Into a Relationship or Anything

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Qiao Mianmian waved at him and then walked towards the elevator.

“Miss, please hold up.”

Tu Yilei called out to her just before she got into the elevator.

Qiao Mianmian turned around. “Mm?”

Tu Yilei pointed at her. “Your name? I don’t know what your name is yet.”

“Qiao Mianmian.” Qiao Mianmian smiled sweetly. “I’m Qiao Mianmian.”

Her smile got Tu Yilei lost in a daze for a moment.

He was still looking in that direction even after Qiao Mianmian entered the elevator.

Seeing his expression, his manager suddenly felt a sense of crisis. He got serious the moment the elevator doors closed and said sternly, “Little Tu Tu, I’m telling you, your career is picking up very well right now.

“You’d better not be thinking of getting into a relationship or anything!”

If it was any other female celebrity, Michael wouldn’t even be worried.

But the newbie Qiao Mianmian they just encountered was simply too beautiful.

Even Michael, who had been in the industry for so long, had hardly seen a girl so beautiful and with such a pure and innocent aura.

Michael couldn’t help but think about his first love the moment he saw her.

He had to admit that his heart swooned a little.

Not to mention a young man like Tu Yilei.

Although he was a megastar, he was still a boy without prior experience in romance. He was practically a blank slate.

It was only natural that he swooned in the presence of such a pure and pretty little girl. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

The entertainment industry wasn’t short of beautiful women.

But it really was rare to find one with such a clean aura.

As Tu Yilei’s manager, Michael certainly knew what sort of girls he liked.

Qiao Mianmian was his ideal type!

His eyes were fixated on her when she smiled at him.

“Michael, what are you thinking.” Tu Yilei took his cap off and casually ruffled his hair. He sounded casual. “I’m not interested in that right now. I will tell you about it if I think about dating anytime soon.

“But for now, that’s not on my list.”

Michael was a little stunned, but he then narrowed his eyes skeptically. “Really?”

“Yes, really.” Tu Yilei turned to look at him straight in the eye.

“That Mian girl... you don’t like her?”

Tu Yilei kept a straight face. “I do.”

Michael’s expression changed right away. He was all ready to chide him when he heard Tu Yilei chuckle. “Who wouldn’t like such a pretty girl? Do you not like her?”

“When you say you like her...”

“I mean I admire her looks, that’s all.” Tu Yilei was 1.86m tall. He looked down and placed a hand on Michael’s shoulder as he raised a brow. “I know what you’re worried about. Don’t worry, I won’t do it. Alright, don’t think too much about this. Let’s head in.”

Qiao Mianmian sent Jiang Luoli a message when she got into the elevator: [Luo Luo, I saw Tu Yilei just now. He’s soooo handsome in person. His face is so small, and his features are exquisite. His complexion is amazing too, and he’s so approachable and not the least bit arrogant.]

Jiang Luoli responded immediately: [Really? Damn, send me a photo. Get a better angle so I can use it as my home screen!!]
