Chapter 671: Too Late

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

And the makeup and hairstyle would have to be done at least two hours earlier.

When she reached the dressing room, she saw that everyone had already put on their makeup and changed into their costumes.

She was the only one not done yet.

The other actresses in the dressing room were well aware of what was going on. Some of them looked at her with sympathy, while others gloated.

Now, everyone in the crew knew that Bai Yusheng had his eyes on a newbie.

As a popular artiste in the entertainment industry, Huang Yilin was the one who wanted to sleep with him the most. Many female artists liked him and wanted to hook up with him.

Qiao Mianmian naturally became their public enemy.

Most people gloated at her misfortune.

“How could this be.” Nana was so angry that her face was red. “We just received the notification. How could we make it in time when they suddenly said that the shoot would start in half an hour? Sister Mianmian hasn’t put on makeup, done her hair, and dressed.

“Half an hour isn’t enough.”

Just her hairstyle alone took more than half an hour.

Qiao Mianmian looked at the group of female artistes in the dressing room expressionlessly and quickly understood what was going on.

She was... being pranked.

It wasn’t hard to guess who it was.

After a moment of shock, she quickly regained her composure.

From the moment she offended Huang Yilin, she knew that she wouldn’t be able to live in peace for the next few months.

But she didn’t expect Huang Yilin to be so impatient on the first day.

“Ha, everyone received the notice two hours in advance. You’re saying you only received the notice now?” One of the female artistes looked at Qiao Mianmian with a mocking smile. “You mean, someone is deliberately messing with you?”

Nana was stunned. “I didn’t say that. We did receive the notice just now. Otherwise, how could we have come so late? As for why we only received the notice now, only the person who informed us would know.”

Nana quickly guessed that it was Huang Yilin.

All the female artistes in the crew were informed two hours in advance.

Only they were late.

It was too obvious.

She knew what was going on.

“Aren’t you saying that because you feel someone is out to mess with you?” The female artiste sneered again and rolled her eyes at Nana. “Who knows why you’re only here now? Who knows if you’re being arrogant.

“After all, some people are already on good terms with others. So what if they’re late? It’s fine if they just act coquettishly and say nice things. Unlike you, we don’t dare to be late for even a second. After all, we don’t have such powerful backing. If we don’t do a good job, we’ll lose our jobs.” Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

As soon as she said that, the other female artistes around her also said sarcastically, “Yeah, we’re not as lucky as you. We can’t be as wilful.”

“You...” Nana was both anxious and angry.

Seeing that time was running out, she said anxiously, “Sister Mianmian, what should we do? We don’t have time.”

Qiao Mianmian didn’t bother about them. She quickly scanned the room and walked to an empty dressing table. “You’re all done with your makeup, right? No one else is using it?”
