Chapter 1130: Help You Realize Everything in Your Heart

It had to be said that Shen Rou had analyzed her psychology thoroughly.

Whatever she was thinking was right.

Yes, she hated Qiao Mianmian.

Ever since she could remember, she had detested her half-sister.

No, Qiao Mianmian wasn’t even her sister.

She used to wonder why she could not get intimate with this sister.

After Lin Huizhen told her the truth, she finally understood.

Qiao Mianmian wasn’t even her sister.

They were not related by blood.

But she couldn’t understand why Father Qiao treated a daughter who was not related to him by blood better than her.

It made Qiao Mianmian look like she really was his biological daughter.

She felt unbalanced.

Later, Qiao Mianmian became more and more beautiful.

In addition, her grades were outstanding, and the teachers often praised her. Father Qiao liked her more and more.

His biological daughter had been cast aside.

The most hateful thing was that Qiao Mianmian had stolen her first love.

That was the first time she was moved by a boy. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

But when she gathered her courage to confess to him, he said that the person he liked was Qiao Mianmian.

He even handed her a love letter, asking her to pass it to Qiao Mianmian.

This was a great humiliation to her!

How could she not hate Qiao Mianmian?!

Hence, from then on, she would snatch away anything that Qiao Mianmian cared about.

Seeing that she was silent, Shen Rou smiled again. “As long as you’re willing, I can help you realize everything in your heart. Didn’t you want to be better than Qiao Mianmian in every aspect?

“As long as you cooperate with me and listen to me, everything will be done according to my instructions. I promise that very soon, your life will be a hundred times better than it is now. Your status and identity will also change drastically.”

Qiao Anxin’s eyes flickered, obviously moved by her words. She gripped the edge of the table tightly and suppressed her excitement. “What does Miss Shen want me to do?”

“Answer me something first.” Shen Rou looked at her, her eyes flickering. “Is Qiao Mianmian not from the Qiao family? She has a different father and mother from you, right?”

Qiao Anxin looked up in shock.

Shen Rou looked at her reaction and knew that she was right.

Her expression darkened and she clenched her fists tightly.

She had guessed correctly.

Qiao Mianmian... really wasn’t from the Qiao family.

“It seems like she really isn’t from the Qiao family.” Shen Rou suddenly recalled the birthmark that Madam Bai had mentioned. She leaned towards Qiao Anxin with an anxious and excited expression.

“No matter how bad your relationship with Qiao Mianmian is, you two grew up together. Do you know that she has a birthmark on her?”

“Birthmark?” Qiao Anxin was stunned.

“That’s right, a birthmark.” Shen Rou took a deep breath. “A red birthmark. Have you seen any part of her body that has a birthmark like this? Don’t worry, think carefully.”

Qiao Anxin looked at Shen Rou’s anxious expression and hesitated before asking, “Miss Shen, do you... know who my sister’s biological parents are?”

How did Shen Rou know that Qiao Mianmian wasn’t from the Qiao family? Although Qiao Anxin was puzzled, she wasn’t particularly surprised.
