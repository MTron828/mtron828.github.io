Now, their child was born.

It wasn’t too early to start discussing the wedding because it had to be prepared a few months in advance.

Especially for rich families like the Mo family.

Mo Shixiu would definitely give Jiang Luoli a grand wedding.

“Me?” Jiang Luoli sniffed.

Mo Shixiu found this action cute. He couldn’t help but pinch the tip of her nose. But he didn’t dare to exert any force, as if he was touching something fragile.

“Mm, what’s your favorite wedding like?”

Jiang Luoli thought about it seriously and then said, “I prefer the outdoors. Pick a sunny day, one that isn’t cold or hot, preferably with a breeze, and our wedding venue will be somewhere beautiful.”

Her eyes were filled with longing as she imagined the beautiful scene. “Don’t invite too many people, just some close friends and relatives. As for the format, I prefer Western-style. It feels more beautiful and romantic.”

Mo Shixiu listened to her seriously and imagined the scene with her. After a while, he smiled gently and said, “It sounds wonderful. If you like such a wedding, we’ll do it this way.”

“What about you?” Jiang Luoli looked up at him and smiled. “Don’t you have your own thoughts? What kind of wedding do you like?”

“What you like is what I like.” Mo Shixiu’s voice was soft and gentle. He reached out and brushed away a few strands of hair on her cheek. “I don’t have any thoughts. Your thoughts are my thoughts.”

Jiang Luoli was speechless.

Her heart pounded when she saw the gentleness in his eyes.

This man had always been like this.

He was… completely obedient to her.

Jiang Luoli felt that Mo Shixiu was spoiling her.

Ever since she moved to Mo Shixiu’s place and started living with this man, she had been living a good life. Yes, it was nice to call it a good life. If she was more direct, she felt like she was living a useless life.

After being with Mo Shixiu, she even lost her basic life skills.

It seemed like no matter what request she made, whether it was reasonable or unreasonable, he never rejected her.

His temper was so good that Jiang Luoli felt that he didn’t have a temper.

But she had seen what Mo Shixiu was like in front of others.

She had seen how he scolded his subordinates.

Even Assistant Xu, who had been with him for many years, was in awe of him.

It seemed like she was the only one who wasn’t afraid of Mo Shixiu.

Not only was she not afraid, but Jiang Luoli would also flare up at him from time to time.

But he was still tolerant of her wilfulness.

He pampered her so much that she couldn’t help but think about how could she, Jiang Luoli, be able to meet a man who pampered and loved her so much? Most importantly, this man was f*cking good! Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Mo Shixiu, aren’t you afraid of spoiling me?”
