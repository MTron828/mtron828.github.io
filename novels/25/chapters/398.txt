Chapter 399: Oh, Our Beauty Queen Is Back?

“Huh?” Jiang Luoli was stunned. She thought for a while and replied, “There aren’t a lot of people openly hostile towards you. Shen Yueyue and Zhao Wanting are still in custody, so they couldn’t have posted it. It might be Bai Xiao.

“This post was created last evening. We argued with Bai Xiao before the post was released. She also said some nasty things. Don’t you think that the speech pattern of the post creator is similar to Bai Xiao’s?

“I think... there’s a high chance that it’s her.”

Qiao Mianmian nodded and said, “Yes, I think so too.”

Bai Xiao was definitely the prime suspect.

But, Bai Xiao couldn’t be so stupid.

Bai Xiao couldn’t have misunderstood that she would be the prime suspect if something like this happened.

If she wanted to destroy her, she wouldn’t do it now as well.

It would’ve been too easy.

“Wouldn’t it be too obvious if she chose to do this now?” Qiao Mianmian asked.

Jiang Luoli was slightly shocked. “That’s true as well. Now that I think about it, it might not be her. But who else would write such things about you?”

Qiao Mianmian shook her. “I don’t know.”

“Baby, what are you going to do?” Jiang Luoli asked. “The post is gaining traction. Bad news spreads really quickly. Some people might actually believe it.”

Even though they knew that the content was false and defamatory. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

But the public didn’t know any better.

People would really believe that Qiao Mianmian had a scandalous past and even got an abortion.

A rumor like going through abortion was really defamatory for a girl.

And it would really tarnish her reputation.

Especially for her since she was still in the honeymoon period with her Prince Charming. If he were to see this post, it would definitely strain their relationship even if he trusted her.

If he was insecure, he might even break up with her over this.

The post creator was a really horrible person.

Qiao Mianmian thought for a while, smiled, and said, “Find the person behind it all, of course.”

Jiang Luoli nodded. “I agree. But how? Should we ask Prince Charming?”

“No need for that.” Qiao Mianmian smiled again. Her anger reached a point that she managed to calm her emotions down. “No need to trouble him. Chen Chen can settle this for me.”

“Chen Chen?” Jiang Luoli was shocked. “Are you planning on...?”

“Luo Luo, have I told you that Chen Chen is not just a good gamer, he’s quite good with IT as well?”

“No. Are you telling me that Chen Chen is a hacker?”

“He’s not that good.” Qiao Mianmian laughed as she picked up her phone and looked coldly at the post. “But he can easily find the IP address of the post creator.”

She was really curious about the identity of the post creator.

“That’s great. Send him a message and ask him to figure it out. I can’t wait to find out who that bitch is and murder her.”

...

The two of them stayed in the library for a while longer and then headed to class.

On the way, they met Bai Xiao and Zhang Yuwei.

When they met, Bai Xiao scoffed and looked at her with disdain. “Oh, our beauty queen is back?”
