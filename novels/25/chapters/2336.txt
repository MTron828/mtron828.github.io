Chapter 2337: Only in Front of Qiao Mianmian

She was drinking the yogurt that the waiter had just sent over. It was strawberry-flavored and especially delicious.

Suddenly, Lin Wanwan came over to toast her.

And she said so much.

A 16-year-old girl was rather cute. She even said that she wanted to know her and be friends with her.

Qiao Mianmian felt that it wasn’t appropriate to reject her.

She looked at the wine glass left in front of Mo Yesi and was about to pick it up when someone grabbed her hand.

She blinked and looked up into a pair of dark and charming eyes.

“Didn’t I tell you not to drink alcohol?” The handsome man held her hand and put the wine glass aside.

“Uh…” Qiao Mianmian was stunned. “But, she wants to toast me. I…”

She couldn’t possibly not drink it.

If she didn’t drink it, people would think that she wasn’t willing to give the other party face.

“That won’t do,” Mo Yesi said domineeringly. “I said not to drink it, not even a drop.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

Mo Yesi was domineering a second ago, but the next moment, he patted her head and coaxed her gently. “Didn’t I get you a few bottles of yogurt? Drink it. If you want to drink alcohol, I’ll drink with you. You’re not allowed to drink outside.”

At least when she was drunk at home, only he could see her alluring side.

“But…” Qiao Mianmian looked up at Lin Wanwan, who was still holding the wine glass, but now looking a little upset.

Mo Yesi looked up too.

Not as embarrassed as Qiao Mianmian, he said coldly, “She doesn’t drink. If you want a toast, you can toast others.”

Lin Wanwan’s face was still hot and a little shy when she met his gaze.

But Mo Yesi’s words embarrassed her.

She tightened her grip on the wine glass as tears welled up in her eyes. She looked at this extremely handsome but cold man with a grievance.

Just a moment ago, when he was talking to the woman in his arms, his eyes were still so gentle.

But in the next second, his eyes were this cold.

“Second Bro.” Yan Shaoqing watched from the side. Seeing the tears in his little cousin’s eyes, he came out to help her. “Don’t be so fierce. You scared Wanwan.”

With that, he waved at Lin Wanwan. “Wanwan, come over to Second Cousin. Your Sis-in-law really doesn’t drink outside. Come over, Second Bro will drink with you.” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Lin Wanwan stood still, looking aggrieved.

She blinked, causing tears to fall.

Yan Shaoqing frowned. “Wanwan, you’re really crying. Second Bro is like this to everyone. Don’t cry.”

When Mo Yesi first got together with Qiao Mianmian, Yan Shaoqing thought that he had recovered.

But he later realized that Mo Yesi’s illness wasn’t cured at all.

Besides Qiao Mianmian, his attitude towards other women was no different from before.

He only showed his gentle side in front of Qiao Mianmian.

In front of other women, he was still the cold and arrogant “freak” who had no interest in women.

Mo Yesi had always been this cold to women.
