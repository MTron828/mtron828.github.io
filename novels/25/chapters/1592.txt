Chapter 1593: Don’t Let Her Think of Giving Up

Beside her, Shangguan Qing saw her expression and asked with disappointment, “Aunt, is Brother Zeli not coming back?” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Madam Gong turned around, held her hand, and sighed. “I’m afraid he won’t be coming back today. He encountered an important matter at work and has to settle it personally, so there’s no choice.

“Qingqing, you’re so understanding. I’m sure you can understand. To men, their career is very important.”

Even if Shangguan Qing was unhappy, she had to pretend to be considerate and sensible. She held back her unhappiness and nodded. “Aunt, I understand.”

“What a good child.” Madam Gong praised her. “Zeli needs a gentle, sensible, and thoughtful woman by his side. If you two could be together, that would be great. I wouldn’t have to worry about him not having a woman to take care of him in the future.”

Shangguan Qing was elated to hear that. She said shyly, “Aunt, I-I’m willing to take care of Brother Zeli. But... he seems to have someone he likes already.

“Even if I’m willing to take care of him, he doesn’t need me.”

“Who said that?” Madam Gong immediately said. “Qingqing, you’re such a gentle, kind, and cute girl. Everyone likes you. Who wouldn’t like you? It’s not that your Brother Zeli doesn’t like you, it’s just that he always hates us interfering in his relationship matters.

“So, no matter how good you are, he’s still against it.

“It’s not that he doesn’t like you, but he’s protesting to me and his dad in this manner.”

Shangguan Qing was a little stunned.

“Is that so?” She was elated. “Brother Zeli said that he doesn’t like me because of you and Uncle?”

“Mm, he’s my son. How could I not understand him?”

Madam Gong lied to her.

In fact, she knew very well that Gong Zeli wasn’t interested in Shangguan Qing.

But Madam Gong couldn’t say that to her.

She was very satisfied with Shangguan Qing.

The Shangguan Family was slightly inferior to the Gong Family.

But apart from the fallen Shen Family, they were the most compatible family with the Gong Family.

The Yan, Mo, and Lu families were naturally compatible with the Gong Family, especially the Mo Family.

But none of them had daughters.

Shangguan Qing was the only daughter of the Shangguan Family and she had been pampered since she was young.

Her personality was a little different.

But this was nothing to Madam Gong.

This girl was smitten by her son. She had a bad temper, but in front of her son, she was definitely a good girl.

Hence, Madam Gong had to calm Shangguan Qing down and prevent her from giving up.

“Then, then, even if Brother Zeli likes me, he’ll deliberately show that he doesn’t like me because he’s angry with you?”

“Mm.” Madam Gong lied without batting an eyelid. “Qingqing, the girl Zeli liked since he was young is your type. So, how could he not like you? Believe me, he’s lying and deliberately going against me and your uncle.

“Auntie will definitely call him back tomorrow night. You two should spend more time together and develop your relationship. Anyway, the daughter-in-law that Auntie has chosen is you.”
