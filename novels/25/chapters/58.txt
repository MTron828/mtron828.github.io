Chapter 59: Don’t Mess with Him, Don’t Mess with Me

Watching her come in, the other two roommates looked at each other and couldn’t help asking, “Mianmian, are you really not hiding?”

Jiang Luoli was also worried. “Baby, you have time to go now.”

Qiao Mianmian squatted down and took her things one by one up to her bed.

She said calmly to Jiang Luoli, “Luo Luo, when have you seen me suffer?”

Jiang Luoli thought for a while. She really hadn’t.

Qiao Mianmian looked like a very soft and beautiful young girl. She gave the illusion that she was also very soft and cute and easily bullied.

But anyone who knew her knew that her soft and cute appearance was just an illusion.

Otherwise, she wouldn’t have made Shen Yueyue and Zhao Wanting cry just now.

However... But...

“Baby, Shen Yueyue’s godbrother isn’t someone you want to mess with. I heard that he’s involved with the gangsters. You really don’t have to be stubborn.”

“If I shouldn’t mess with him, he shouldn’t mess with me either.”

With Mo Yesi’s personal guarantee, she didn’t feel afraid.

Her husband was also very impressive, ok!

He was ten, one hundred times more impressive than Shen Yueyue’s godbrother.

Jiang Luoli: “...”

“Relax, Lou Luo.”

Qiao Mianmian slowly stood up and reached out and patted her shoulder. “I’m not stupid, I’ve also asked for help. Shen Yueyue can’t take advantage of me.”

“You also asked for help?” Jiang Luoli remembered the call she just made, and her eyes were full of curiosity. “So, did you just call someone for help? Who did you ask? Is it reliable?”

“Very reliable. No one is more reliable than him.”

Jiang Luoli looked at her calm and unworried look and wanted to ask if she had called Su Ze just now.

If it was Su Ze, then she really didn’t need to worry about anything.

Shen Yueyue’s godbrother’s home was still inferior to Su Ze’s. In any case, the Su family was also one of the top ten prestigious families in Yuncheng.

But she thought it was impossible.

With Qiao Mianmian’s temper and the fact that Su Ze had betrayed her, she could never ask him for help again.

So who was it?

At the Mo Firm.

In an oversized conference room.

The seniors trembled and were so scared that they couldn’t breathe.

Just a moment ago, Chairman Mo had rejected their plan, but the team had worked overtime until midnight and had taken a whole month to finalize it.

But Chairman Mo had looked at it for less than a minute.

Before he had even read all the contents, he had rejected it.

Rejected it...

The seniors wanted to cry.

Did they have to work overtime for another month?

After working overtime like this, they felt like the few hairs on their heads were about to fall out.

But if Chairman Mo had said no, then it was a no.

No one dared to refute it.

To this young CEO who had just turned 25, even an old man who had been in the company for decades dare not look down on him.

“This is the idea that you spent a month to come up with? This kind of thing is nothing new and can be done by a few college students. Don’t you feel embarrassed to show it to me?

“It seems that Mo Firm has raised too many idlers and it’s time for a large number of layoffs.”

As soon as this was said, all the faces of the seniors in the conference room were frightened.

“Toot...”

At this moment, Mo Yesi’s mobile phone resting on the desktop vibrated.

In previous meetings, he wouldn’t even look at his phone, but this time, he immediately lowered his head and picked it up.

Then, he picked it up in seconds.

After answering the phone, he didn’t explain anything, just got up and walked outside the conference room.

After he went out.

A group of seniors discussed heatedly. “Who called Chairman Mo? He actually answered so fast?”
