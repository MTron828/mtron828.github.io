Chapter 1595: Looks Like I Have to Get Prepared

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Even if the person in the video was her husband.

Even though this wasn’t the first time Qiao Mianmian saw him like this, she still felt her heart race as she looked at his perfect figure.

Mo Yesi’s figure was even better than the models on the runway.

If this man wasn’t already her husband.

If she hadn’t seen this scene many times.

Qiao Mianmian felt that she wouldn’t be able to resist it.

“If I wasn’t on a business trip, I would’ve come to celebrate with you.”

“Are you on a business trip?” Qiao Mianmian noticed that he was in a hotel.

“Mm, I’ll be out for a few days. I’ll look for you after this business trip.”

“Chen Chen’s birthday is in a few days.” Qiao Mianmian thought for a while and said, “Let me go back. Let’s celebrate Chen Chen’s birthday together.”

“Chen Chen’s birthday?”

“Mm.”

“Isn’t your birthday coming soon?”

“Mm.”

Qiao Mianmian and Qiao Chen were born in the same month, and their birthdays were only 10 days apart.

Mo Yesi nodded and smiled. “It seems like I have to prepare in advance.”

Qiao Mianmian smiled. “What’s there to prepare? Birthdays are held every year, it’s not a special day. I want to pick a gift for Mom on her birthday. My birthday is her day of suffering.”

Mo Yesi chuckled. “This is our first birthday together. It’s very meaningful, so we have to give you a good present. As for choosing one for Mother-in-law, it’s only right. Let’s pick it together.”

Qiao Mianmian couldn’t help but laugh when she heard him call her mother “mother-in-law”. “You call her mother-in-law so smoothly.”

“Your mother is naturally my mother-in-law. What’s there to be embarrassed about? I was wondering if I should find a time to sweep my other mother-in-law’s grave? You haven’t officially introduced me to her.”

Mo Yesi was referring to Qiao Mianmian’s adoptive mother.

She was also one of Qiao Mianmian’s closest relatives.

Qiao Mianmian realized that she hadn’t brought Mo Yesi to visit Madam Qiao’s grave.

They were already married.

She should have brought Mo Yesi to pay respects.

They chatted for more than an hour before ending the video call.

...

Qiao Anxin received the news that Boss Huang had been beaten up to the point of having a concussion and quickly found someone to understand the situation.

She couldn’t help but panic when she found out that Boss Huang was hospitalized because of Qiao Mianmian.

Gong Zeli beat him up.

This meant that Mo Yesi and Bai Yusheng would know about this soon.

Qiao Anxin thought about the consequences and turned pale.

She had just gotten close to Boss Huang and gotten some resources.

If anything happened to him, would she have a good time?

She was now under Boss Huang’s name. If anything happened to him, she would definitely be affected.

She’d lost her chance to audition and wanted to get Boss Huang to make an exception for her. Who knew that something like this would happen?

Qiao Anxin had just finished a job.

Song Fang said, “The rest of the company has already gone to the hospital to visit him. You should go too.”Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m
