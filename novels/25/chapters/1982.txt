Chapter 1983: Don’t Want to Lose Face in Front of Qiao Mianmian

The first publicity event was held in Yuncheng City.

Half an hour later, Bai Yusheng parked his car in the underground parking lot of a hotel.

The publicity was being held at a five-star hotel. All the major media outlets in Yuncheng City had already arrived. Qiao Mianmian and Bai Yusheng got out of the car and went to take the elevator when they bumped into Qiao Anxin.

Qiao Anxin was dressed to the nines in a tight black dress. Even through her sunglasses, her thick makeup was obvious.

Her hair was down, covering most of her face. Coupled with the sunglasses on her nose bridge, it almost covered her entire face.

It was difficult for ordinary people to recognize her.

But Qiao Mianmian recognized her immediately.𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

She and Qiao Anxin had lived under the same roof for so many years, she could recognize her even if her face was covered.

Qiao Anxin wasn’t alone.

A man looking to be in his fifties was beside her. He was short and fat, and his facial features were all squeezed together. He was half a head shorter than her.

The man’s arm was around her waist.

Qiao Anxin was chatting happily with the man.

But when she saw Qiao Mianmian, she stiffened.

The man beside her seemed to sense her abnormality and looked at her. “What’s wrong, Baby?”

Qiao Mianmian looked at the man and then at Qiao Anxin. She smiled.

She had heard about this before.

But this was the first time she was seeing it.

At this point, Qiao Mianmian felt that Qiao Anxin was really harsh on herself.

She had been with Su Ze for a while.

No matter what, Su Ze was much better than this short and fat old man.

She could force herself to be with such a man just to be popular.

He looked even older than Father Qiao.

Qiao Anxin didn’t expect to meet Qiao Mianmian here.

And they even bumped into each other.

She knew that Qiao Mianmian must have recognized her.

Qiao Anxin felt a deep sense of shame and anger.

Especially Qiao Mianmian’s gaze. It made her feel like she was being despised.

It was harder for Qiao Anxin to accept this than to accompany old men.

She could embarrass herself in front of anyone.

She just didn’t want to embarrass herself in front of Qiao Mianmian.

“Baby?” The man saw that she didn’t say anything and looked at her curiously. He then followed Qiao Anxin’s gaze to Qiao Mianmian.

The moment the man’s gaze landed on Qiao Mianmian, his eyes lit up.

He seemed to have lost his soul as he stared at her.

The man’s reaction made Qiao Anxin even angrier.

Even though she detested this old man.

But seeing how he seemed to have lost his soul when he saw Qiao Mianmian and didn’t even look at her again, she was furious.

Why were all these men like this when they saw Qiao Mianmian?

It was as if their souls had been hooked.

Qiao Mianmian was a vixen who specialized in seducing men.
