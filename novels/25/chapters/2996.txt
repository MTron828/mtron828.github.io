Qiao Mianmian saw that he was still wearing a thin shirt. “Aren’t you cold?”

“Mm, I’m not cold.” Mo Yesi put on the coat for Qiao Mianmian and wrapped an arm around her waist. He pulled her into his arms and half-carried her into the car. “Men

are more resistant to cold than women. You only recovered after about a month from your last cold. How can you not be careful?”

Qiao Mianmian teased him. “So, you’re afraid that I’ll catch a cold and you’ll have to take care of me.”

Mo Yesi reached out and flicked her forehead, but he didn’t use much strength. He only symbolically made a gesture and smiled. “Heartless little girl, have I not taken care

of you enough? Do you not know if I’m afraid of trouble or my heart aches for you?

“Tell me, if you catch a cold during our honeymoon and end up lying on the hotel bed, will you complain to me about this for the rest of your life?”

Qiao Mianmian chuckled. “Alright, I was just joking with you. Hubby, where are we going to play after putting our luggage in the hotel?”

“Where do you want to go first?”

Qiao Mianmian’s eyes sparkled. “We can go to the water world first. | heard that the seafood there is super delicious. Then, we can go to the snow mountain tomorrow. I

saw a picture of the snow mountain on Weibo previously. It’s super beautiful.

“We can sit by the French window and eat roasted sweet potatoes while drinking hot coffee and watching the snow outside. Just thinking about it makes it especially Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

meaningful. What do you think?”

“Mn, it’s very artistic. But I think…” Mo Yesi deliberately paused and looked down at the woman in his arms.

“But what?” Qiao Mianmian immediately asked.

Mo Yesi smiled again and whispered into her ear.

Qiao Mianmian’s fair face got slightly red. She bit her lip, punched the man’s chest, and glared at him. “Hooligan! What are you thinking about all day!”

“How can I be a hooligan to my wife?” Mo Yesi’s voice was low and sexy. “Moreover, I can’t control my emotions when I see you. I can’t help but think of that… Is this my

fault?

“You can only blame yourself. Baby, you’re too charming.

“Moreover, did I say anything wrong? Don’t you think that what I just said is more meaningful and…”

Qiao Mianmian covered his mouth. “Don’t speak anymore!”

Mo Yesi, this old hooligan!

He actually told her that they could watch the snow outside while standing in front of the window naked.

This man didn’t know how cold and abstinent he was, but in front of her, Qiao Mianmian couldn’t even bear to look at him.

He was a hooligan!

A hooligan with unhealthy thoughts all day long!

The honeymoon period passed quickly.

Qiao Mianmian felt like only a day had passed, but in the blink of an eye, it was already time to return.

On the day of their return, the plane was a little bumpy due to the weather. Qiao Mianmian couldn’t help but vomit three times.

Still feeling sick after getting off the plane, she vomited again when he returned to Lu Shan Courtyard..
