Chapter 3014 Platonic Mode

Qiao Mianmian looked up and met the man’s dark and passionate eyes. Her heartbeat quickened.

They had been married for so long, it was obvious what they were thinking. Speaking of which, ever since she got pregnant, she and Mo Yesi had been chatting under the blanket. Their intimate actions had stopped at kissing

Although the doctor said that it wouldn’t be a problem to be careful after the first three months, Mo Yesi didn’t dare to try it at all. He was usually very careful and nervous. He often made Qiao Mianmian feel like he was the one pregnant and not her.

Although Mo Yesi was very self-aware and restrained, Qiao Mianmian knew that he must be having a hard time.

Before she got pregnant, he restrained himself enough, and they practically…

But he had endured it for a few months now. It was obvious how torturous it was.

“The last time I did a fetal examination, the doctor said that the baby in my belly is already very stable. Actually… if we pay more attention, it should be possible.” Qiao Mianmian blushed slightly and said softly.

“No.” Mo Yesi squeezed her waist and said hoarsely, “There are only three months left, we can’t take the risk. Baby, I’m fine, you don’t have to worry about me. Go to sleep first, I’ll take a shower.”

With that, he slowly let go of her waist and got off the bed.

Seeing that he was walking towards the bathroom, Qiao Mianmian sat up too. “You’re taking a cold shower again?” Mo Yesi had been taking cold showers more and more frequently recently.

And the shower was getting longer.

“Why are you up?” Mo Yesi turned around and patted her head. “Didn’t I tell you to sleep first? Don’t bother about me.”

Qiao Mianmian held his hand and squeezed it. “Don’t take a cold shower, I’ll help you.”

Mo Yesi was stunned. He looked down and asked in a low and hoarse voice, “Help me?”

“Mm.” Qiao Mianmian lowered her head and blushed. “I’ll help you.”

Two hours later.

Mo Yesi came out of the bathroom in a black bathrobe. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

When he got back to bed, it was almost midnight.

The man had just taken a shower, and he smelled like fresh shower gel. It was Qiao Mianmian’s favorite lemon scent.

Mo Yesi had just laid on the bed when Qiao Mianmian turned around and snuggled into his arms.

“Are you sleepy? Go to sleep if you are.” Mo Yesi reached out to hold her gently and kissed her on the forehead. Qiao Mianmian said, “Mm, I’m sleepy.” She was very sleepy during her pregnancy. She usually slept early. As compared to usual, she had been delayed for more than two hours and was already very sleepy.

“Hubby.” Qiao Mianmian’s voice was soft and sweet.

Mo Yesi replied gently, “Mm?” Looking up at the man’s beautiful jawline and snuggling into his arms, Qiao Mianmian asked softly, “Are you not so uncomfortable now?” “Mm.” Mo Yesi chuckled. “Much better.”

“Tell me if you feel uncomfortable next time.” Qiao Mianmian scratched his chest. “I can help

you.”

“Alright.” Mo Yesi kissed her again.

“Hubby.” “Mm?” “I’m so sleepy, I really need to sleep.” “Mm, go to sleep. Goodnight, Baby.”
