Chapter 468: The Way He Looked at Her Was a Little Weird

Gong Zeli and Yan Shaoqing were around.

Shen Rou wouldn’t vent her anger in the open no matter what.

Qiao Mianmian used to think about maintaining a civil relationship with Shen Rou.

Even if they couldn’t be truly good friends, they could be ordinary acquaintances.

After all, Shen Rou and Mo Yesi were friends for so many years.

She didn’t want to ruin their friendship with her appearance.

But she’d changed her mind.

She gave up thinking about maintaining a superficial friendship with Shen Rou ever since she insulted her brother.

She looked at the three people entering and turned towards Shen Rou. After eyeing her for a few seconds, she smiled and said, “Miss Shen, we aren’t that familiar with each other. I think you should address me as Miss Qiao. As for what Luo Luo just said, excuse me, I don’t think she was overboard.”

Shen Rou stiffened. “You...”

“Everyone has the right to like or dislike others. Miss Shen cannot think that Luo Luo is overboard just because she dislikes you. After all, the only thing that everyone loves is the Chinese yuan, isn’t it?”

Shen Rou went pale.

A few seconds later, she turned around almost helplessly and bit her lip. “It seems like I’m not welcome here. I- I’ll take my leave first, then.”

If Shen Rou had said this in the past, Gong Zeli and Yan Shaoqing would surely stop her from leaving and stand up for her.

But this time, none of them seemed to be making a move to keep her here.

Not a single one of them was going to speak up for her too.

Yan Shaoqing even nodded. “Mm, Rourou, you can leave first. I have some things to say to Sis-in-law. I’ll look for you later.”

“Zeli, are you accompanying Rourou?”

Yan Shaoqing saw that Gong Zeli was glancing at Qiao Mianmian.

The way he looked at her was a little weird.

Gong Zeli seemed not to have heard him. He didn’t respond.

Yan Shaoqing suddenly felt his heart sink as a strange thought emerged in his head.

No way.

Why is Fourth Bro looking at Sis-in-law like this?

It’s such a weird look.

Could he have... fallen for Sis-in-law because she’s so beautiful?

Yan Shaoqing shocked himself with this thought.

If this was true, it’d be terrible.

There would be a world war.

Shen Rou noticed Gong Zeli’s odd silence too. She turned around and saw him looking at Qiao Mianmian in a daze.

He was so distracted that he hadn’t responded to Yan Shaoqing. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Shen Rou’s expression changed instantly.

She felt threatened.

Gong Zeli never used to look at Qiao Mianmian like this.

Shen Rou could see very clearly that there wasn’t a single trace of despise in Gong Zeli’s eyes. He had a completely different attitude towards Qiao Mianmian now.

She felt an unprecedented sense of panic.

Why was this happening?

Hadn’t Gong Zeli detested Qiao Mianmian because of her?

As of now, only Gong Zeli was willing to stand by her side, to help her and protect her. If even he...

“Zeli.” She couldn’t stop herself from calling out to him.

But Gong Zeli seemed not to have heard her.

His eyes were still on Qiao Mianmian’s.
