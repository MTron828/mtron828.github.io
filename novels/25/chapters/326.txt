Chapter 327 When This Is All Over, We Can Talk It Out Calmly

“Ah Si, do you have to do this?” Shen Rou looked hurt as she said, “The few of us have always gotten along fine. Why have you become like this after you returned?”

There was a subtext to her statement.

Ever since Qiao Mianmian knew that Shen Rou saw her as a rival, she was able to understand the deeper meanings of her comments.

She was trying to say that Qiao Mianmian was the culprit behind their strained friendship.

If it weren’t for her, none of this would have happened.

Qiao Mianmian used to think that she might actually affect their friendship.

And she’d felt guilty about it.

But now...

She didn’t feel so bad anymore.

She wasn’t the one in the wrong, after all. Why did she have to feel guilty?

She’d never been the one to pick the fight or sabotage anyone.

If Gong Zeli and Shen Rou really ended up having a strained relationship with Mo Yesi, they only had themselves to blame.

In any case, Qiao Mianmian couldn’t understand what they’d been doing.

Any normal person would try their best to respect their good friend’s significant other, wouldn’t they?

Weren’t they creating trouble by doing just the opposite?

It didn’t even have to be someone’s wife.

Given her friendship with Jiang Luoli, even if someone talked bad about Jiang Luoli in front of her, she’d lose it too.

Mo Yesi didn’t say anything, but the way he looked at her said enough.

“Rourou, let’s go.” Gong Zeli grabbed Shen Rou’s hand and smiled mockingly. “What’s the point of asking him? Don’t you already have the answer? He’s already made his choice so clearly, why do you still hold on to any hope?”

Shen Rou looked at Mo Yesi with teary eyes. “Ah Si, I know you didn’t mean what you just said. I won’t take it for real, and neither will Zeli. You’re in a fit of anger now, nothing we say will get to you.T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“When this is all over, we can talk it out calmly.”

Gong Zeli smirked and seemed like he wanted to say more.

But Shen Rou tugged at him and shook her head pleadingly.

Gong Zeli saw the look on her face and clenched his fists. He took a deep breath to suppress the anger and, at the same time, swallowed the words he was about to spit out.

He’d never been able to reject Shen Rou’s requests.

Especially when she looked at him with such teary eyes.

Since she didn’t want him to say more, he wouldn’t.

“Zeli, let’s go.” Shen Rou tugged at his arm gently.

She wanted to leave.

She wouldn’t be able to bear it if she stayed any longer.

Seeing how protective Mo Yesi was of Qiao Mianmian, she could feel her heart being ripped apart over and over.

It hurt so badly.

She felt as if she could barely breathe.

“Alright, let’s go.” Gong Zeli shot Mo Yesi a cold glare and then eyed Qiao Mianmian deeply before leaving with Shen Rou.

Shen Xin stood rooted for a while.

She looked up at Qiao Chen with her swollen and reddened eyes and asked softly, “Qiao Chen, I’m going to ask you a question. I hope you can be honest with me, alright?”

Qiao Chen felt a little suffocated as he saw how upset she looked. “What is it?”
