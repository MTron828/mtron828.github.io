Chapter 582: I Really Hope You Can Give Me a Chance

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

But the moment he reached out, she took a step away in disgust.

Su Ze’s expression stiffened.

“Mr. Su, did you get it wrong? I’m not interested at all in your relationship with that woman, and it has nothing to do with me, anyway. If you want to explain things, you’ve come to the wrong person.” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

If Qiao Mianmian was considered mildly disgusted by Su Ze previously...

She was extremely disgusted by him right now.

She questioned her past judgment once again.

How could she not have realized that this man was this much of a scum?

She couldn’t believe that she once saw Su Ze as a rare good man.

And that as a rich second-generation heir, he barely had any vices that most other wealthy guys had.

She thought of him as being different from men who cheated women of their feelings and enjoyed hopping from one woman to the next.

Perhaps she really was blind in the past.

She finally believed this statement.

All men were trash.

They were all the same.

Not a single one was spared.

She hadn’t realized before only because he’d hid it well.

Otherwise, given how long he and Qiao Anxin had been together, how could she not have known?

Had Qiao Anxin not come up to her back then, she’d probably still be kept in the dark.

That thought angered Qiao Mianmian.

The way she evaded his touch and glared at Su Ze agitated him.

She could lie beneath another man and derive happiness from him, but she couldn’t even bear to be touched by him?

Did she hate him that much?

“Mianmian, I know you’re still angry with me.” Su Ze looked at her and took a deep breath. He suppressed his anger and tried his best to remain calm. “I know I’m in the wrong. I let you down.

“No matter what I say and do, I’ll never be able to make up for my mistake.

“But, I really hope you can give me a chance.”

He was finally clear of something.

He still loved Qiao Mianmian.

She was the only woman who really moved him.

In his entire life, he’d probably not be able to find another woman he loved this much.

Hence, he really didn’t want to give up just yet.

He wanted to get her back.

He’d already decided. Once Qiao Anxin was discharged, he would break up with her.

After the breakup, he’d be a single man again.

By then, he could openly woo her again.

He’d once made a mistake out of folly and caused her great hurt.

From now on, he’d be good to her, he’d make up for his mistake.

“That woman has nothing to do with me. She’s just an uncle’s daughter who came back from overseas. My mom told me to take her around and familiarize her with the surroundings. We only went for a meal, nothing more.”

“When you saw us just now, she was just about to slip. I only held her out of courtesy.”

Su Ze felt a need to explain things, despite how disinterested Qiao Mianmian seemed.

He didn’t want her to misunderstand him.

What he said was essentially the truth.

He had no interest in the woman and only agreed to this blind date because Mother Su asked him time and again.

It was all out of formality.

His heart was with Qiao Mianmian, how could he possibly be interested in other women?
