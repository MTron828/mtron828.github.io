After seeing him with her own eyes, she finally understood why Young Lady Shen was so obsessed with him.

This man… was really one of a kind.

The best.

Even though she knew that this man would never have anything to do with her in this lifetime, the woman couldn’t help but steal glances at him. She felt that if she didn’t see it with her own eyes, she wouldn’t dare to believe that such a man actually existed in reality.

This face, this body…

They were the best of the best.

Seeing such a perfect man and then looking at the man beside her, the woman couldn’t help but show a hint of disdain.

If it wasn’t for money, how could she follow this old man?

But if she had to serve someone like Mo Yesi, she was willing to pay to be with him.

It was worth it to sleep with such a top-notch man.

Mo Yesi could feel the young woman’s gaze on him. He looked up and saw that she was looking at him as if she was a little girl in love.

The woman was stunned when she met Mo Yesi’s eyes. She looked down shyly, but after a few seconds, she looked up and winked at him.

Even though she knew that a man like Mo Yesi was beyond her reach, she didn’t want to miss any chance.

No matter how powerful a man was, it was inevitable that he would have some problems.

They were all the same.

Although she heard that this young and promising Chairman Mo was already married and that Madam Mo was a very beautiful female celebrity, so what? After seeing her for a long time, wasn’t it just that?

Many men married beautiful female celebrities and kept mistresses outside.

Many of their mistresses weren’t even as pretty as their original partners.

So, if she didn’t give it a try, how would she know if she had a chance?

Compared to serving old men, she naturally hoped to be with such a young, handsome, rich, and powerful man.

Mo Yesi’s eyes turned cold the moment she looked at him.

The coldness in his eyes made the woman feel a chill down her spine. When she looked up and saw the disgust in Mo Yesi’s eyes, she felt as if her body was frozen. She couldn’t help but feel afraid.

She’d been trying to seduce Mo Yesi a second ago, but now, all such thoughts were gone.

The middle-aged man didn’t know what his little lover had just done, but seeing that Mo Yesi’s expression suddenly turned cold, he asked curiously, “Chairman Mo, did you encounter something troubling?”

“It’s nothing,” Mo Yesi said calmly. “Although I shouldn’t interfere with Chairman Zhao’s family matters, I hope that Chairman Zhao won’t bring anyone he shouldn’t. I don’t want anyone unrelated to be here.”

The middle-aged man was stunned. When he understood what Mo Yesi meant, he immediately patted his little lover’s hand. “Manli, there’s nothing for you to do here. Go back first. I’ll look for you when I’m free.

“Didn’t you say you wanted a bag? Buy it later. Take it as a gift from me..”
