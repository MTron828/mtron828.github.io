Chapter 2621: Expectation

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Although the Mo family kept a low profile most of the time, it didn’t mean that these reporters didn’t know the Mo family’s unique symbol.

Everyone knew that the female artiste Qiao Mianmian was married to the Mo Corporation’s Chairman Mo Yesi.

Hence, it was obvious who was inside the Rolls-Royce.

At this time, most of the female artistes had already walked the red carpet.

Qiao Mianmian appeared very late.

In this red carpet show that was about to end, Song Fei made a name for herself with her limited-edition C brand evening gown and became the most eye-catching person. She was even chosen by some fashion magazines as the most stunning female artiste tonight.

Everyone was thinking that Song Fei must have won the Golden Globe Award for Best Female Artist.

Even Shen Fei was outshone by her.

After all, even if she was a B-list idol, she was wearing a limited edition C brand gown.

Moreover, she was the only female artiste in Country A to wear a limited edition C brand piece.

Not everyone could do it.

There were only a few spots each year, and they gave it to Shen Fei last year.

This year, it was given to Song Fei.

The others could only wait until next year to see if they could qualify.

Hence, it wasn’t surprising that Song Fei’s fans were showing off. If it was any other artiste, they would definitely do the same.

It was just a competition between women.

Honestly, they felt that Qiao Mianmian was definitely prettier.

Song Fei was beautiful, but she wasn’t as exquisite as Qiao Mianmian.

But tonight, Song Fei was already in the limelight.

She had “murdered” many reporters.

Although she wasn’t as pretty as Qiao Mianmian, female celebrities couldn’t win with their looks.

It seemed like Song Fei had won the war on Weibo.

What about the war on the red carpet?

Who would win?

Qiao Mianmian was the wife and daughter of two rich families. In terms of background, she was much more impressive than Song Fei.

If she lost to her in both matters, it would be a slap in the face.

Hence, the moment Qiao Mianmian’s Rolls-Royce appeared, it attracted all the reporters’ attention.

They eagerly waited. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

What was Qiao Mianmian wearing tonight?

Song Fei was wearing a limited edition C brand gown.

How would Qiao Mianmian win against her?

The moment Qiao Mianmian got out of the car, countless cameras were focused on her.

They first saw a pair of sparkling blue high heels.

Further up was a pair of slender and fair legs. The owner of the legs had delicate and exquisite ankles. Her pair of royal blue high heels made everyone feel like they were looking at the crystal shoes that Cinderella wore in the fairy tale.

It was just a pair of high heels, and just the part of her ankle that was exposed was already so beautiful.
