Chapter 2169: A Voice Kissed by an Angel

But the more it was like this, the more curious the netizens became.

Many netizens analyzed who the singer might be, but the people they guessed were all wrong.

Although no one could guess that the singer was Qiao Mianmian, the songs were already very popular.

It had only been a day, but she was already in the top three of many rankings.

She wasn’t a professional singer, but this result was something that many professional singers envied.

It wasn’t just the netizens who were curious about the two songs.

Even people like Zhan Bo were curious.

After recording “The Meaning of Traveling”, Qiao Mianmian still had contact with Zhan Bo, Su Mufei, and the rest. Among them, she had the most contact with Zhan Bo.

From time to time, they would exchange messages on WeChat.

Hence, Qiao Mianmian couldn’t help but comment on Zhan Bo’s Weibo post about her new songs.

Zhan Bo: [These songs can calm people down. I like them very much. I recommend everyone to listen to them.]

Qiao Mianmian commented: [You like the songs?]

Zhan Bo was probably bored and was scrolling through his WeChat friend circle. He replied almost instantly: [Mm, these songs are the interlude in the television drama you starred in. Do you know who the singer is?]

Qiao Mianmian hesitated for a while before replying: [More or less.]

Bai Yusheng was afraid that the haters would slander her if they knew she was the singer.

Hence, he kept it a secret.

It turned out that he made the right decision.

Not knowing who the singer was, the netizens discussed it ardently. Qiao Mianmian’s two songs were on the trending list almost 24 hours a day, and even the television drama was about to air.

Many netizens said that this was deliberately hyping up the drama’s popularity.

But even so, this hype was undoubtedly very successful.

According to Bai Yusheng, a corresponding press conference would be held before the new show was broadcast. At that time, the reporters would definitely ask about this, and then they could publicly announce that Qiao Mianmian was the singer.

Hence, Qiao Mianmian had to cooperate with him and not reveal it.

She wouldn’t tell the netizens.

But she didn’t intend to hide it from Zhan Bo.

She quickly received a private message from him.

Zhan Bo: [Do you know who the singer is? Tell me, I’m so curious.]

Qiao Mianmian didn’t answer him immediately. Instead, she asked: [Do you like this person’s songs?]

Zhan Bo: [Mm, I think her voice must have been kissed by an angel. I haven’t heard such a touching voice in a long time. Is she a newbie? Are they trying to hype her up? Why hasn’t she announced her identity?] Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

She felt goosebumps all over when he praised her for being an angel.

Although it was a compliment, she felt that Zhan Bo would become stunned if he found out.

Qiao Mianmian: [Actually, the singer is someone you know.]

Zhan Bo: [Someone I know? Who? Why don’t I know anyone who can sing so well?]
