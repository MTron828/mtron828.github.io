Chapter 781: Forcing Me to Do It?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“But I didn’t have feelings for him. Even though he’s very outstanding, I was not willing to marry a stranger.

“He was the one who exchanged the condition for my brother’s surgery. That’s why I agreed to register our marriage.”

Qiao Mianmian didn’t want to talk about it.

But she didn’t want Madam Mo to think that she was the one who got Mo Yesi to register their marriage.

Mo Yesi was the one who suggested the marriage certificate.

Back then, she wasn’t willing.

Why did she have to bear the responsibility of “lying”?

She wanted Madam Mo to know about this.

She didn’t coax Mo Yesi into marriage. It was he who forced her to marry him in exchange for the surgery.

“W-What did you say?” Madam Mo furrowed her brows and looked shocked.

In her heart, her son was the best in the world.

Only women would harass her son and seduce him.

How could her son pester a woman?

She’d long believed that Qiao Mianmian had tricked her son into registering for the marriage.

Hence, Qiao Mianmian’s words really shocked her.

“Mom, I just wanted to tell you that Mo Yesi was the one who initiated the marriage. I didn’t lie to him, nor did I force him to do it. I didn’t play tricks just because I was afraid you wouldn’t agree to it.

“If it wasn’t for the fact that I needed him to perform the surgery for my brother, I wouldn’t have had any contact with him, much less marry him.

“I know that no matter what I say, it won’t change my impression of you. But I still want to clarify things. Whether you believe me or not isn’t something I can control.”

Madam Mo looked at her in shock and kept quiet for a while before sneering. “So, Ah Si was the one clinging onto you and insisting on marrying you?”

Qiao Mianmian hesitated for a while before nodding honestly. “Mm, it was like that back then.”

If it wasn’t for Qiao Chen’s surgery.

She would never marry Mo Yesi.

No matter how outstanding and attractive he was, he was just a stranger to her.

No woman would want to marry a stranger.

After all, marriage was a huge matter.

“You...” Madam Mo didn’t expect such an answer.

How could there be such a shameless woman?

She actually nodded!

Why was she so thick-skinned?

What sort of person was her son to cling to a little girl like her?

“Mom, when I married him back then, we both had our own needs. I needed him to perform the surgery for Qiao Chen, but he saw how special I was to him, so we hit it off. If you wanted me to divorce him at that time, I would’ve agreed without hesitation.

“But I like him a lot now.” Qiao Mianmian smiled as if she didn’t see Madam Mo’s expression getting darker. “So, I can’t agree to leave him.”

“You...”Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Madam Mo felt that she had never seen such a shameless woman.

She was so angry that her fingers were shaking as she reached for the coffee cup on the table. “I’m trying to talk you out of it, but you won’t listen. Do you really want me to hit you? Qiao Mianmian, let me ask you one last time, are you going to divorce Ah Si?”
