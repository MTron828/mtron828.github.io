Chapter 1113: You’re an Ingrate!

He said all sorts of unbearable words. “I was too naive to think that you would care about your old relationship. Hehe, those few years of our old relationship are nothing to you. You’re true to whoever has more money. Why didn’t I realize earlier that you’re such a snobbish woman?”

Even though Qiao Mianmian already knew what kind of man he was, her hands still trembled from anger.

No matter how much of a jerk Su Ze was in the past, he had never said such unbearable words to her.

Su Ze continued to scold her. “You’re so cruel. The Su family and I treated you well back then. Now, you want to kill the Su family. To think that my mother dotes on you like her own daughter. You’re an ingrate!”

“Su Ze, I don’t know what’s wrong with you! But I have nothing to say to a mad dog like you. Don’t call me anymore. If you call me again, I’ll block you.” Qiao Mianmian hung up.

She then blacklisted Su Ze’s new phone number.

She was still trembling with anger after hanging up.

She had never thought that a person could be so disgusting.

When she thought that she had already seen the worst side of him, he used his actions to tell her that she had underestimated how disgusting and shameless he was.

Her understanding of him after all those years was like a joke.

She had known him for ten whole years.

But she had never truly understood what kind of person he was.

Qiao Mianmian had just blocked Su Ze’s number when her phone beeped twice.

She looked down and saw that it was a message from an unknown number. “Qiao Mianmian, no matter how unhappy you are with me, my parents didn’t offend you, right? Are you really going to destroy the Su family? Do you know that my parents are so worried that they can’t eat and are crying? Do you really have to be so cruel?”

It was from Su Ze again.

Qiao Mianmian deleted the message and blocked the new number.

She hated Su Ze to the core.

However, she had never been biased against her parents.

Su Ze was the one who let her down.

It was not Father and Mother Su. She could still tell that.

So, even though Qiao Mianmian had blocked Su Ze’s number, she still wanted to ask Mo Yesi about what had happened.

It sounded like the Su Corporation had suffered a blow.

He said that Gong Zeli did it.

But Qiao Mianmian knew very well that if someone had really done something to the Su Corporation, it couldn’t be Gong Zeli.

It could only be Mo Yesi.

And Mo Yesi was already unhappy with Su Ze.

He was afraid that after hearing what Linda told him that day, he already had thoughts of attacking the Su Corporation.

Qiao Mianmian couldn’t fall asleep after being woken up by Su Ze’s call.

She got out of bed, washed up, and went downstairs with her phone.

“Good morning, Young Madam.” Butler Lin greeted her respectfully when he saw her. “Young Madam, do you want to have breakfast now? I’ll get the kitchen to prepare it.” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Qiao Mianmian nodded and slowly walked towards the dining room.

A few minutes after she sat down at the dining table, the servant brought breakfast over.

Even though she was the only one eating, the breakfast was still sumptuous. There were fruits, desserts, Chinese and Western dishes.

While eating, she asked Butler Lin, “Has Mo Yesi been at the company for a long time? When did he leave?”
