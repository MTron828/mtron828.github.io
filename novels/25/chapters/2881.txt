Chapter 2882: You Should Have a Child Too

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

After lunch, Qiao Mianmian went to look for Jiang Luoli.

Jiang Luoli was taking care of her child at home every day, and Qiao Mianmian hadn’t seen her in a while. Both of them were very happy to meet.

“Baby, aren’t you still filming a variety show? Why are you back?”

Jiang Luoli finally had the time to talk to her sister. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Although the servants were helping her with the child, she did it herself most of the time.

Although it wasn’t so easy, she enjoyed it.

“I came back to settle some matters, so I took a day off. I haven’t seen you and Yueyue for a while, so I came to see you. Yueyue grew really fast. It’s been less than a month since I last saw her, but she’s already grown so much.”

“That’s right.” Jiang Luoli’s eyes were filled with happiness as she talked about her daughter. “Shixiu also said that she’s growing so quickly that the clothes we bought previously don’t fit her anymore. They say that children are difficult to take care of and are troublesome, but I think Yueyue is especially obedient and not difficult to take care of.

“She just eats and sleeps. She’s quiet all day. Besides the day she was born, she barely cries. Baby, seriously, you should have a child soon.”

Qiao Mianmian looked at Jiang Luoli’s sincere expression and found it funny. “Why? You’re going to join the production team too? I remember that someone once said that children are the most troublesome creatures in the world. If you get married in the future, you won’t want children early.”

“I’m not rushing you to give birth.” Jiang Luoli thought about it seriously and smiled. “I used to think that children were very troublesome and didn’t like them very much. But after giving birth to Yueyue, my attitude changed completely.

“Every day I look at her, I wonder how such a cute baby can exist in this world. With Yueyue, I feel especially happy and satisfied now. I have no regrets in my life. When you have your own baby in the future, your thoughts will definitely change.

“Moreover, didn’t you tell me that you’re already preparing for pregnancy? If you give birth soon, your baby can play with Yueyue in the future.”

Speaking of preparing for pregnancy, Qiao Mianmian touched her belly. “Mm, preparing for it. But there hasn’t been any results.”

Jiang Luoli looked down at her belly and frowned. After a few seconds of hesitation, she asked, “You’ve been preparing for pregnancy for a while, right? And from what you said, Prince Charming is also very active in this matter. Is there a problem?”

“I went for a checkup with him, and the doctor said that our bodies are fine.” Qiao Mianmian sighed. “It’s probably because the baby doesn’t want to come to this world too early. Anyway, I don’t really want a child now, so I’ll just let nature take its course.”

“That’s true.” Jiang Luoli nodded. “You and Prince Charming are still young, it’s not too late to have a child a few years later. Oh right, I saw the news today. Is that Jiang Xinyue really Qiao Anxin? What exactly is going on?”

Qiao Mianmian told her everything from Qiao Anxin’s identity to Bai Yusheng and Qiao Chen investigating her.

Jiang Luoli was shocked and afraid. “She had plastic surgery to look like you. She must be up to no good to get close to you as soon as she returned. Thankfully, you’re fine. But I’m worried that she’ll hate you even more now that you exposed her.. She might do something crazy.”
