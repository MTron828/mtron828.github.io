Chapter 2451: Untitled

Wasn’t this indirectly saying that the Shen Corporation’s jewelry wasn’t good enough?

But Shen Fei was probably regretting it now.

After knowing that Henry Zhou had become the designer of this batch of jewelry, would she still feel that the Shen Corporation’s jewelry wasn’t good enough?

“What ulterior motives could I have?” Qiao Mianmian was amused. “I’m just reminding Miss Shen to watch her words. What do you think Henry Zhou would think if he heard what you said?

“Would he still be willing to design jewelry for your Shen Corporation? With his temper, I don’t think he’d be willing.”

Shen Rou’s expression changed again. “Are you threatening me? Do you think it’s useful? So what if I said that? Mr. Henry isn’t even here. Moreover, you know that I’m not talking about him.

“You think you can scare me? What a joke.”

Qiao Mianmian couldn’t be bothered to talk to her anymore.

Anyway, she had already gotten what she wanted.

She hadn’t intended to teach Shen Rou a lesson.

But since she had already taken the initiative to bump into her and was still shouting so arrogantly in front of her, wouldn’t she be letting down this good opportunity if she didn’t do something?

She wouldn’t take the initiative to cause trouble.

But if someone wanted to cause trouble and wanted to ride on her head, she wouldn’t be a pushover.

It was time for her to teach Shen Rou a lesson.

“Whatever you think. Ah Si is still waiting for me. I don’t have time to continue chatting with Miss Shen. Do as you wish.” Qiao Mianmian turned to look for Mo Yesi.

Shen Rou’s expression darkened.

Mo Yesi was here too?

He was shopping with this slut?

When Shen Rou first entered, she was immediately led to this area by the shop assistants. She didn’t see Mo Yesi sitting in the rest area.

Even when she saw Qiao Mianmian, she didn’t think that Mo Yesi was here with her.

She knew how much Mo Yesi hated shopping.

When Madam Mo called Mo Yesi over while she was shopping with her, he found an excuse to leave in less than 10 minutes.

He was so impatient even with his mother.

But… he had the patience to accompany this slut!

Shen Rou couldn’t suppress her jealousy and hatred.

She didn’t even dare to dream about it, but now, Mo Yesi was doing it with this little slut.

Qiao Mianmian turned to look for Mo Yesi, so she didn’t see Shen Rou’s dark expression.

“Why are you taking so long? Didn’t you say you were going to change your clothes?”

Qiao Mianmian turned around and smelled a familiar scent.

The person behind her hooked his arm around her waist and pulled her towards him.

It was Mo Yesi.

Qiao Mianmian’s back was against the man’s warm chest. She looked up at him and was about to push him away, but when she felt a resentful gaze land on her, she smiled and leaned against Mo Yesi lazily.

Then, she said coquettishly, “I was going to change. However, I bumped into someone I know, so we chatted for a while.”

“Familiar?” Mo Yesi raised an eyebrow and looked at Shen Rou coldly.
