Chapter 1592: She Didn’t Seem to Like Him That Much

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

A gentle and pleasant voice sounded above her head.

Qiao Mianmian looked up and saw a woman in a black Hepburn mini-skirt standing in front of her. She was about 24 or 25 years old and not particularly beautiful, but her temperament was very good.

She looked like a well-versed lady.

It was strange.

The woman wasn’t very beautiful, but she had an attractive aura.

Qiao Mianmian couldn’t help but look at her.

“I’m fine. I accidentally bumped into you. Are you alright?”

The woman smiled and shook her head.

Qiao Mianmian felt bad and apologized again before leaving.

When she left the diagnosis room, the woman was still standing at the door, looking at her back in deep thought.

Qiao Mianmian...

They finally met.

She was the woman who captivated Mo Yesi.

She was indeed beautiful.

But she believed that just being beautiful wasn’t enough to take down a man like Mo Yesi.

Qiao Mianmian was already a distance away, but she could still feel a gaze following her.

She couldn’t help but turn around and saw that the woman she’d bumped into was still standing there looking at her.

That gaze was strange.

Qiao Mianmian frowned.

She was sure she didn’t know that woman.

But the way that woman looked at her gave her the illusion that they knew each other.

A few seconds later, the woman finally retracted her gaze and walked into the treatment room.

Qiao Mianmian didn’t think too much about it. Although she felt that this woman was a little strange, she didn’t take it to heart and turned to leave.

A few minutes later, she found Gong Zeli and Linda.

“Mianmian, are you alright?” Linda asked.

Qiao Mianmian shook her head. “I’m fine.”

Gong Zeli was relieved to hear that.

“Mr. Gong, I’ve already been checked. The doctor said that I’m very healthy and there’s nothing wrong with me.” Qiao Mianmian looked at Gong Zeli, who was waiting by the side, and picked up her cell phone to look at the time. She then said, “It’s getting late. Mr. Gong, you should have something else to do, right? Go on with your work, Sister Xie and I are going back.” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

At this moment, Gong Zeli’s cell phone rang.

He picked up the call. After a while, Qiao Mianmian saw that his expression had darkened, and his eyes were filled with impatience.

“I told you, I’m not interested in her.

“If you bring her to me again, don’t blame me for being rude to her.

“I don’t need anyone to worry about me. I’m hanging up. Don’t call me again.”

Gong Zeli’s expression was dark.

He pursed his lips and looked unhappy.

At this moment, another subordinate walked over and whispered into his ear.

Gong Zeli looked up at Qiao Mianmian. “I have something on, I can’t send you back. You...”

“It’s alright, go on with your work. Sister Xie can send me back.”

“Yes, Young Master Gong, I can send Mianmian home.”

Gong Zeli pursed his lips.

He was a little upset that Qiao Mianmian agreed so quickly.

She still didn’t seem to like him.

...

At the Gong Family.

Madam Gong didn’t look too good after Gong Zeli hung up.
