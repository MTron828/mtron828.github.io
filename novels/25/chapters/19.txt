Chapter 20: In Marrying Him, I’m the One Who Has to Gain

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Sister, what exactly is going on? Was this some speed-dating going on?”

He was worried that Qiao Mianmian had casually married another man in the spur of the moment because she’d been triggered by Su Ze’s betrayal.

But...

That brother-in-law of his didn’t seem like someone who’d easily agree to something so important.

“Chen Chen, you don’t have to worry about all these. What matters most to me now is that you can be treated. Your brother-in-law... he’s a cerebrovascular specialist. With him performing surgery on you, your chances of recovery are a lot higher.”

Upon hearing this, Qiao Chen fully understood what was going on.

“Sister,” His eyes went red, “you married him for my sake? Is that the case?”

He hadn’t expected his sister to exchange her lifetime of happiness in order to get him treated.

Even if he fully recovered, he’d feel guilty about it.

“Chen Chen.” Qiao Mianmian sighed softly. She put the knife down, took a sheet of tissue and held Qiao Chen’s hand. “Honestly, I’m not that aggrieved. Your brother-in-law isn’t some old, ugly, perverted man, tons of girls are dying to marry him. Truth be told, in marrying him, I’m the one who has to gain.”

“Sister...”

“Compare him to Su Ze, who has better qualities?”

“... O-Of course it’s Brother-in-law.”

“Exactly.” Qiao Mianmian wiped the tears with the tissue and smiled. “I found a better man than Su Ze, you should be happy for me. Otherwise, wouldn’t it be really sad if I was left alone after being abandoned?”

Outside the ward.

The siblings did not know that somebody had sent Mo Yesi their conversation.

At the Mo Firm.

Mo Yesi had just commenced an important meeting.

Cell phones had to be on silent mode during meetings. When vibration was heard, everybody in the meeting room exchanged glances and tried to locate its source.

A few seconds later, they saw the President picking up his cell phone to read a message.

Everyone was speechless.

Wasn’t it against the rule to be reading messages during meetings?

This was odd enough, but odder things awaited.

They actually caught President Mo smiling.

It was a brief one, but they did see it!

Mo Yesi was reading the messages Lu Rao sent.

Lu Rao: [!! I heard that girl say you’re married, don’t tell me this is true!!!]

Lu Rao: [You made her sign the marriage certificate by promising to perform surgery on her brother in exchange? I can’t believe you’re such a person.]

Lu Rao: [That girl actually said she’s the one who’s got to gain in this marriage.]

Lu Rao: [She even said that you’re better than her ex. No, wait, she asked her brother, her brother was the one who said that.]

After reading all the messages, Mo Yesi’s lips curled up. It was a lapse of his default seriousness in the meeting.

He replied with one word: [Yup.]

Lu Rao immediately replied: [Yup? What does ‘yup’ mean? You really made her sign the certificate in exchange for the surgery?]

Mo Yesi: [I’m better than her ex.]

Lu Rao: [...]

A few moments later, Lu Rao sent another message: [You’re really married?]

Mo Yesi: [How can anyone lie about marriage?]

Lu Rao: [Impossible!!] Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Six o’clock in the evening.

Mo Yesi’s chauffeur drove to the hospital to pick her up punctually.

The chauffeur was extremely polite. Upon seeing Qiao Mianmian, he courteously greeted. “Young Madam.”
