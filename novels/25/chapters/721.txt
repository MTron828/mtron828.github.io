Mo Residence.

Madam Mo’s expression darkened as she looked at the news on her cell phone. The bird’s nest porridge that the housemaid handed her was spilled. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

The ceramic bowl fell onto the carpet. The bowl was fine, but the porridge spilled out.

“I’m sorry, Madam.”

The housemaid immediately apologized and knelt on the floor. She quickly cleaned up the dirty carpet and changed into another one.

“Aunt Mo, don’t hurt yourself.” Shen Rou sat beside Madam Mo and placed a hand on her chest. “It’s not worth it to hurt your body because of this.”

“I’ll get you another bowl of porridge.”

“What porridge?” Madam Mo’s face was pale. “I’m so angry now. It’s only been such a short time, and she’s already having a scandal with another man. One moment, it’s your ex-fiancé, and the next moment, it’s a male actor.

“Who is Qiao Mianmian? She’s already married into the Mo family, why is she still so restless?

“She’s actually involved with so many men.

“How could a woman like her deserve to enter the Mo family?”

Shen Rou smiled and said, “Aunt Mo, is there a misunderstanding? I don’t think Mianmian is such a person.

“Ah Si dotes on her so much, and you and Grandma Mo treat her so well too. What else is she dissatisfied with? If it was me, I’d be so happy to be able to marry into such a family. I’d definitely be wholeheartedly dedicated to this family for the rest of my life, how could I still be involved with men outside?

“I think there must be some misunderstanding. Mianmian isn’t such a loose woman.”

“She’s not a loose woman?” Madam Mo sneered. “What’s so good about a woman in the entertainment industry? If she was a good woman, would she have been able to coax Ah Si to secretly get married to her? I knew she wasn’t a good person, but I didn’t expect her to be so insecure.

“This woman can’t stay in the Mo family anymore.

“Otherwise, our Mo family will be humiliated sooner or later.”

Shen Rou’s eyes flickered as she tried to hide her excitement.

“But no matter what, Ah Si still likes her a lot,” she said softly. “Otherwise, he wouldn’t have gotten married to her so quickly. Even if... Aunt Mo doesn’t agree to them being together, it’s useless.

“Ah Si is a very opinionated person. He... won’t listen to others.”

“So, Rourou, Aunt Mo needs your help.” Madam Mo turned around and grabbed Shen Rou’s hand. “I can’t tolerate this woman staying in the Mo family. Rourou, can you be Aunt Mo’s daughter-in-law?”

Shen Rou furrowed her brows and looked troubled. “But Aunt Mo, Ah Si can’t possibly divorce her. No matter how much I like Ah Si, I can’t ruin his family. Aren’t I a third party?”

“Of course, Aunt Mo won’t let you suffer like this.” Madam Mo was silent for a while before she clenched her teeth. “Whether Ah Si is willing or not, he has to divorce that woman!”

“Aunt Mo, what do you want me to do?” Shen Rou kept quiet for a while and pretended to be in a difficult position. “Although I like Brother Ah Si a lot, I don’t think it’s right to force myself on him. Brother Ah Si doesn’t like me. If I continue to pester him, he’ll only hate me more.”
