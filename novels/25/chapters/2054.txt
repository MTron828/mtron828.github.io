Chapter 2055: Do You Have What I Want?

Qiao Anxin’s expression changed. “Su Ze, you!

“You’re here to talk about this?” Qiao Anxin’s face was pale. “Then, it seems like we have nothing to talk about. I was really crazy to come. I should have known that there was nothing to talk about with a jerk like you.”

She prepared to leave.

“Qiao Anxin, don’t you want to get out of this situation?” Su Ze stopped her.

Qiao Anxin stopped in her tracks.

Su Ze added, “We can work together.”

Qiao Anxin stood at the door for a while before slowly turning around.

She looked at him expressionlessly. “Cooperate? How? Su Ze, you can’t even protect yourself now, right? What’s the point of working with you?”

Su Ze’s expression stiffened, but he quickly smiled. “You don’t believe me?”

“It’s not that I don’t believe you.” Qiao Anxin looked at him and said bluntly, “I’m speaking the truth. The Su Corporation was acquired by the Mo Corporation, and you were sent to Country F by Mo Yesi. Although you said you were going to manage the branch company, you know very well whether you have the power.

“You don’t even have a decent job now, how are you going to work with me? Do you have what I want?”

“Of course I do.” Su Ze’s expression was a little awful after being bettiled by her. He said in a low voice, “I won’t bother about the Su Corporation anymore. I’ve already resigned. Mo Yesi won’t be able to control me anymore.

“I have a new company now, and I’m planning to sign some artistes. If you’re willing to come to my company, I can give you all the best resources.”

“What?! You opened a new company?”

“That’s right.” Su Ze was full of ambition as he talked about his new company. “Although it’s just been established, I can guarantee that it’ll surpass Star Splendor in the future.

“If you’re willing to sign a contract with me, you’ll be the most valuable among the first batch of artistes. How about it, do you want to consider it?”

Qiao Anxin looked at him suspiciously.

“From what I know, the Su family doesn’t have much money after the Su Corporation was acquired. And you still have money… to open a company? Where did you get the resources?”

“Qiao Anxin, you don’t trust me, but you should trust the Gong family’s capability.”

“The Gong family?!” Qiao Anxin was shocked.

“That’s right, the Gong family.” Su Ze smiled coldly. “You must have heard about the breakup between the Gong and Mo families. Now that the two families are like fire and water, they’ve become enemies.

“Gong Zeli opened a new entertainment company and intends to snatch the market share of the Mo Corporation’s entertainment company. Now, I’m the main person in charge of this new company. Gong Zeli has given me most of his rights.

“So, you don’t have to worry about resources. The company is backed by the Gong Corporation. As long as you work hard, you can get all kinds of resources.”

Qiao Anxin was tempted.

“But why would Gong Zeli…” She hesitated for a while before saying, “Hasn’t he always been helping Qiao Mianmian? He handed the company to you to manage, and you want to sign with me. Does he not mind?

“He just wants to deal with Mo Yesi.

“Gong Zeli and Mo Yesi have known each other for many years and have always been good friends. How did things suddenly turn out like this? Everyone says that their relationship broke because of Qiao Mianmian. It seems like Qiao Mianmian is really a femme fatale.” Qiao Anxin’s eyes were filled with jealousy.
