Chapter 2585: Her Husband Is Really a Domineering CEO

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

It wasn’t the usual him Qiao Mianmian knew.

“Baby, don’t try to plead for mercy. Even if this incident didn’t cause any serious consequences, I won’t let her off just like that. I’ve said it before, I want to protect you. I won’t let you fall into any danger again. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“So, even if you plead for mercy, I won’t change my decision.”

She was just an unimportant artiste.

Mo Yesi didn’t think it was overboard to blacklist her.

She touched the person he loved the most.

This punishment was already considered light.

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

She looked at Mo Yesi’s serious expression and found it funny. “You’re overthinking it. I won’t plead on her behalf. But she seems to be the pillar of their company. They can’t just blacklist her.

“Are they willing to do this?”

Little Xiao was the breadwinner of their agency.

Although her popularity wasn’t so high now, the company wouldn’t abandon her so easily.

After all, there was still a chance to make a comeback in the future.

It was common in this industry.

Mo Yesi smiled. “Whether you’re willing or not, you have to listen to your husband. Otherwise, I have a thousand ways to destroy her agency, let alone a small artiste like her.

“So, her agency better be sensible and know what to do. If they really want to go against the Mo Corporation for a small artiste, there’s no need to keep them.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

If he didn’t say such arrogant words, she would think that he was bragging.

But Mo Yesi…

She knew that he definitely had the ability to make these words come true.

She still remembered how Sheng Hui went bankrupt overnight.

It was all because of Mo Yesi.

Such a huge corporation went bankrupt just like that.

Alright, her husband was really a domineering CEO.

What else could she say with such a domineering husband?

If she was in a game, he would probably be the kind of super-god who could easily get five kills and then let a salted fish like her cheat.

“Alright.” Qiao Mianmian touched the tip of her nose. “This is good, too. It can serve as a deterrent. When others want to defame me in the future, they’ll probably think twice.”

There were too many messy things in this industry.

There were also many people who got red-eyed.

Someone like Little Xiao wouldn’t be the first or the last.

If blacklisting Little Xiao could serve as a warning to others, it would be good to lessen her troubles in the future.

“Mm, leave this to me. You don’t have to worry.” Mo Yesi was talking to her, but his eyes were always on her plate. When he saw that it was empty again, he habitually picked up some food and put it on her plate.

“Have a good meal and don’t think about anything else. Where do you want to go after eating? I’ll accompany you.”

…

Qiao Mianmian’s trending topics were quickly removed.

The related topics were also quickly deleted.

A while later, she reposted the post from the Golden Globe Awards’ official Weibo account with a caption.
