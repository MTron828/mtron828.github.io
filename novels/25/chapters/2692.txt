Chapter 2693: Mo Yesi, I Can’t Bear to Leave You Too

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

She felt so lucky to have a husband who loved her so much.

A wave of sweetness filled her heart. She couldn’t help but stand on her tiptoes and hook her slender arms around the man’s neck. Her black and soft eyes were fixed on the handsome and dazzling man in front of her. “Mo Yesi, I can’t bear to leave you too. I know you’re worried about me, but I’m already an adult, and I have basic life skills. I really can take good care of myself.

“Moreover, Sister Xie and Nana will come with me this time. They’ll take care of me, too. So, don’t worry. I won’t let myself live badly. And I heard that our production team is very generous this time. They gave special treatment to the actors. Whether it’s food or accommodation, it’s very high standards.

“Don’t think that I’m going there to suffer. Actually, filming isn’t as tough as you think. Moreover, everyone knows that I’m Chairman Mo’s wife and your precious. Do you think anyone dares to treat me badly?

“Even if they’re not afraid of offending me, they wouldn’t dare to offend you, Chairman Mo!” Qiao Mianmian said cheekily.

Mo Yesi was amused. He smiled and looked down at her. “You don’t mind others thinking that you’re a string-puller now?”

Qiao Mianmian said, “I didn’t mind it for a long time!”

“Mm? You don’t mind it?”

“Mm! I didn’t mind it for a long time! So what if I’m a string-puller? Anyway, I don’t care what others say. I just have to do my job well. I believe that as long as I work hard, others will definitely see my worth! If some people still think I’m a string-puller, then it can only mean that I haven’t done well enough. One day, I’ll rely on my strength to remove this label!” She clenched her fists with firm eyes and voice.

Mm, this was her goal.

She believed that it would come true someday.

By then, no one would think that she became popular because of the Bai or Mo families.

“Alright.” Mo Yesi’s eyes were full of love as he looked at his enthusiastic and energetic wife. He reached out to pat her head and said gently, “I believe you can do it. Baby, you can do it.”

“Mm, I’ll do my best!”

“I know a few old acquaintances in Country Y. I’ll talk to them later. If you need anything, you can contact them to settle it.”

Qiao Mianmian smiled and nodded. “Alright.”

“Of course, you can call me too. It’s the same if you ask your husband for help. Although I can’t rush over immediately, I’ll help you settle it.”

“Alright.” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“If you’re not used to the food there, I can arrange for a chef to cook for you.”

“Alright.”

“You might not be able to adapt to the weather in Country Y. If there’s any problem, don’t force yourself. You have to see a doctor immediately.”

“Alright.”

“It’s not very safe there at night. Stay in the hotel after work. Don’t go out at night.”

“Alright.”

“You have to video call me every day to let me know your situation.”

“Alright.”

The man explained carefully.

He was worried about her.

After a moment of silence, he seemed to be thinking about whether he had anything else to say.
