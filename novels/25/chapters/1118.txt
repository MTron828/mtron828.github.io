Chapter 1119: Are You Chasing That Newbie?

“Yes, Young Master Gong. Miss Qiao and her manager are in the clubhouse right now. I’ll go over right away. Are you going as well?” The CEO thought that Gong Zeli would definitely go.

Otherwise, he wouldn’t have come.

He came especially for Miss Qiao.

It seemed like Young Master Gong was really interested in that newbie.

The CEO thought that he would have to be more polite to the newbie when he went over later.

Perhaps one day, that newbie would become Young Master Gong’s girlfriend.

“No.” Gong Zeli was silent for a while before rejecting him.

The CEO looked surprised. “Aren’t you going? Miss Qiao is also...”

Before he could finish speaking, Gong Zeli glared at him coldly. He was so frightened that he immediately swallowed his words.

“Yes, Young Master Gong. I understand.” The CEO didn’t dare to say anything else. He was afraid that if he said another word, he would anger his boss.

Everyone knew that the young master of the Gong family had a bad temper.

“Then, Young Master Gong, shall I go over now?” The CEO looked at him and asked carefully.

“Okay.” Gong Zeli waved his hand. “Go.”

“Yes, Young Master Gong.”

The CEO immediately turned around and walked out. When he reached the door, he was stopped by Gong Zeli.

He immediately turned around. “Does Young Master Gong have any other instructions?”

Gong Zeli thought about it and said, “Help them pay the bill and get someone to send over some good food and drinks. Oh right, prepare a bouquet of fresh flowers. Remember, don’t reveal my identity.”

The CEO: “... Yes.”

What did Young Master Gong mean?

Was he chasing after that newbie?

Then, why didn’t he want to show himself?

Furthermore, he didn’t let the newbie know that he was the one who did all these.

How did it end up like a crush?

However, with Young Master Gong’s status, was it necessary for him to have a crush on any woman? He could get any woman he wanted with just a word.

Not to mention a newcomer with no background.

He felt that if Young Master Gong liked it, he could just play with her.

There was no need to give her any status.

However, he couldn’t understand Young Master Gong’s current actions.

Why did it seem like a crush?

He was Gong Zeli.

He could just chase any woman he liked.

The CEO left with a stomach full of questions.

He didn’t know what President Gong was thinking and didn’t dare to ask.

As a qualified subordinate, he would do whatever was asked of him.

...

After the CEO left, Gong Zeli asked the others in the room to leave as well.

He sat alone in the large private room, staring out the window with unfocused eyes.

The memories of that night replayed in his mind like a movie.

But this time, the blurry white figure in his mind became clearer.

The blurry face had a clear outline.

He could no longer remember how many times he had regretted not finding out the truth earlier.

Why was it too late when he learned the truth and wanted to make it right?

Why didn’t he discover the truth earlier?

Why!

Why was it that now that he finally had a woman he liked and wanted to treat well, he no longer had a chance?

Why was it that the person she married was his good brother!

Even if he didn’t care if she was married, could he snatch his brother’s woman?
