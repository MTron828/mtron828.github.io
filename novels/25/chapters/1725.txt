Chapter 1728: Shen Rou Is Gong Zeli’s Savior

Jiang Luoli nodded. “I think he treats you differently from others. Don’t you feel that he’s... very good to you? Whether he marries Shangguan Qing or not, the way he treats her in public will affect the relationship between their families.”

And everything he did was because of Qiao Mianmian.

Jiang Luoli felt that he was only willing to help Qiao Mianmian because of his friendship with Mo Yesi.

Moreover, there was something wrong with the way he looked at her.

He didn’t look like he was looking at an ordinary friend.

Jiang Luoli also hoped that she was overthinking. After all, Gong Zeli and Mo Yesi were very good friends. If Gong Zeli really had feelings for Qiao Mianmian, it definitely wasn’t a good thing.

But she didn’t think too much about it.

Qiao Mianmian kept quiet for a while.

Jiang Luoli wasn’t the only one who felt that Gong Zeli treated her differently.

Initially, she thought that he was especially nice to her because he felt guilty towards her.

But now that Jiang Luoli said that...

“I don’t think so.” After a while, she analyzed it in her heart and felt that the possibility of Gong Zeli liking her was rather low. She bit her lip and analyzed her thoughts for Jiang Luoli. “Gong Zeli has someone he likes, he can’t possibly like me.

“He must have helped me because of his friendship with Mo Yesi.”

Jiang Luoli didn’t believe it.

She raised an eyebrow. “Gong Zeli likes someone? Who?”

“Shen Rou.” Qiao Mianmian knew this. So, she felt that Gong Zeli wouldn’t like her.

“I heard it from Yan Shaoqing, too. He said that Gong Zeli has liked Shen Rou for many years and only has her in his heart. He’s been waiting for her. As long as she’s willing, he can marry her immediately.

“And you know, Shen Rou means a lot to him.”

“Means a lot to him? In what way?”

“Shen Rou is Gong Zeli’s life savior. I heard from Yan Shaoqing that Gong Zeli fell into the pool when he was little and almost drowned. It was Shen Rou who saved him. Gong Zeli is very grateful to her, so Shen Rou’s place in his heart is different.”

Jiang Luoli was stunned. “There’s such a thing? Shen Rou is Gong Zeli’s savior?” 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

She believed that Gong Zeli liked Shen Rou.

She still remembered how he protected her at the restaurant.

He had fallen out with Mo Yesi because of Shen Rou.

But Shen Rou saved Gong Zeli? This surprised Jiang Luoli.

“Mm. That’s why Gong Zeli’s feelings for her won’t change so easily.”

“If that’s the case, it might be because of his friendship with Prince Charming. But...”

“But what?”

“But if Shen Rou is so different in Gong Zeli’s heart and even saved her, why didn’t the Gong Family help when something happened to her family? Gong Zeli should be in charge of the family now. If he wants to help, he can at least help a little.

“Don’t you find it strange?”

Qiao Mianmian felt that something was amiss.

Because some time ago, Shen Rou went on blind dates because of her family situation.

She knew that Gong Zeli liked her, so she could have married him.
