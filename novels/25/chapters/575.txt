Chapter 576: A Bad Premonition Keeps Getting Stronger

Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Mo Yesi carried Qiao Mianmian out of the bathroom.

Her eyes were red and filled with tears. She glared at Mo Yesi.

Mo Yesi coaxed her with a low and gentle voice. “Baby, it was my fault. It’s painful to see you cry.

“Swollen eyes don’t look good on you.”

Qiao Mianmian did not reply but continued glaring at him.

This silence was worse than her crying. Mo Yesi didn’t know what he should do.

But he knew that he went overboard this time.

So, he was quick to admit his mistake and apologize. “It’s my fault. Please hit or scold me. You can do anything you want, but please stop crying.

“Good girl, don’t cry anymore.

“What must I do for you to forgive me?”

Thinking back on how badly he bullied her, she didn’t want to forgive him that easily.

She rolled her eyes and gave him a sly look.

“Well, since you said it, I can do anything I want?”

Mo Yesi nodded. “Yes.”

Qiao Mianmian stared at his beautiful face and said, smirking, “Alright, then. This is what we’ve agreed on. You cannot change your mind again later.”

Mo Yesi suddenly had a premonition. Looking at Qiao Mianmian grinning in his arms, he couldn’t resist and asked, “Baby, what do you want me to do? Don’t tell me you’re planning to play tricks on me?”

“No, no, I won’t.” Qiao Mianmian licked her lips, secretly rejoicing. Suppressing her excitement, she replied, “I’m not that kind of person.”

Mo Yesi was speechless.

He thought that she was exactly that kind of person.

“Then, tell me. What would you like me to do?’”

“It’s actually very simple and will be an easy feat for you.”

“Which is?”

What exactly did she want him to do?

He wanted to know immediately.

Qiao Mianmian said with a mysterious expression, “There’s no need for you to do anything. When the time comes, I will let you know.”

Mo Yesi was confused.

His premonition kept getting stronger.

...

The second day, as she didn’t have to attend school, Qiao Mianmian woke up very late.

When she was done washing up and headed downstairs, Mo Yesi had already finished breakfast and left for the office.

Qiao Mianmian had arranged with Linda to meet at a cafe in the city area. After breakfast, she called the chauffeur to fetch her to the meeting location.

As she alighted, she coincidentally bumped into Linda alighting from a BMW.

The two met at the car park. Seeing Qiao Mianmian, Linda froze and glanced at the Rolls Royce behind her.

When Linda was still working as Qiao Anxin’s manager, she already knew that Qiao Mianmian was dating a very rich man.

At one point in time, it made Qiao Anxin very jealous.

The other time, she saw that the man drove a limited edition Lamborghini.

This time, Qiao Mianmian alighted from a limited edition Rolls Royce.

Having one limited edition luxury car was already very impressive, but this time, it was...

It was another limited edition luxury car.

Although Linda could not afford these cars, she knew the status of the people who owned such cars.

Moreover...

She saw the man’s looks the other day.

Thinking back, Linda still found it astonishing.

She had been in the entertainment industry for almost 10 years. Having managed countless artistes, she had seen many good-looking people.

But even the most handsome artiste under her wasn’t close to that man’s looks.

The emphasis wasn’t solely on looks, but more on charisma.

That domineering aura was hard to find.

He wouldn’t have developed such an aura if he didn’t grow up in a wealthy, nurturing environment.

Su Ze was also born from a rich family.

His looks and skills were comparable to others with similar status, from the same generation.

However, even he wasn’t up to par.

Comparing him with the man she saw, she truly understood the vast difference in social standing.
