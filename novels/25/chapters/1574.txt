Chapter 1575: Don’t Even Think of Raising Your Head in Your Life!

Later, Jiang Luo left the city to study in high school and stayed in school. The siblings saw each other less and less, and Jiang Hai had no one to control him anymore.

Coupled with Mother and Father Jiang’s pampering, Jiang Hai completely let himself loose and got together with those hooligans outside.

But now, Jiang Hai was willing to listen to Jiang Luoli.

In his eyes, Jiang Luoli was nicer to him than her parents.

Jiang Hai had never cried in front of his parents, but he did in front of Jiang Luoli. “Sister, I know you’re the only one who’s true to me. I’m wrong, I really know my mistake. If I can get out this time, I won’t make the same mistake again.

“Sister, if only you’d stayed at home all those years ago. I definitely wouldn’t be like this now.”

“I hate Dad and Mom. If it wasn’t for them, would I be like this?”

Jiang Luoli kept quiet.

If she hadn’t gone to the city to study and had gone to high school in the county, perhaps everything would have been different.

But “maybe” and “ifs” didn’t exist in the world.

...

She left the police station.

Father Jiang and Mother Jiang were waiting outside. When they saw Jiang Luoli, they immediately got up and walked towards her.

Mother Jiang was the most agitated. She grabbed Jiang Luoli’s hand and asked anxiously, “How is it? What did you and Xiao Hai talk about?”

Jiang Luoli looked at her calmly. “Mom, I can’t get Xiao Hai out for now.”

Mother Jiang got anxious when she heard this. “What do you mean? Do you still want Xiao Hai to stay inside? Xiao Hai has never suffered at home since he was young. He’s been in there for so many days. He looks thinner and haggard.

“If he stays there, his body won’t be able to take it.”

Jiang Luoli pursed her lips. “It’s not that I want him to stay locked up, but that I can’t get him out. I went to see Xiao Hai just now. He’s a little skinny, but he’s in good spirits. You don’t have to worry too much. He’s not as weak as you think.”

“Jiang Luoli, are you even human?” Mother Jiang raised her hand and said angrily, “That’s your biological brother, how could you say such inhumane things?”

“What are you doing, don’t be rash!”

Father Jiang immediately grabbed her hand. “We’re outside, control your temper.

“Moreover, Ah Li didn’t say that she doesn’t care about Xiao Hai.” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“She hasn’t said anything yet. She doesn’t want to bother about Xiao Hai!”

Mother Jiang’s face was pale. She gritted her teeth and said, “Anyway, I only have one son. If anything happens to Xiao Hai, I’ll die. At that time, I’ll die in front of you, Jiang Luoli. I want everyone to know that you’re unfilial, forcing your own mother to death!

“Don’t even think about raising your head in this lifetime!”

Mother Jiang gritted her teeth in hatred. It was as if Jiang Luoli wasn’t her biological daughter, but her enemy.

Jiang Luoli walked past her calmly.

Mother Jiang got even angrier.

Mother Jiang wanted to continue scolding her, but Father Jiang stopped her.

“Why are you holding me! You saw it, I shouldn’t have given birth to such an unfilial daughter. Anyway, if anything happens to Xiao Hai, I won’t let her off.”
