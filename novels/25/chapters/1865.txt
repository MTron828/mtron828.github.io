Chapter 1866: Wedding Gift

“Actually, I also hope that our relationship can be blessed by our elders. I will work hard to do this well.”

She had tried to get along well with Madam Mo before.

However, some things could not be changed just because she worked hard.

For example, Madam Mo’s concept of family status was already deeply ingrained. No matter how much she tried to curry favor with her, it couldn’t change her attitude and concept.

Unless, one day, she transformed into a rich young lady.

But that was impossible.

So, there was no need for her to mend her relationship with Madam Mo.

...

They bought the diamond ring and walked out of the jewelry store.

“What should we do next? Are we going to take wedding photos?” Mo Shixiu asked Jiang Luoli after he received a message from Assistant Xu.

He actually knew nothing about marriage.

So, he asked Assistant Xu.

Assistant Xu told him that wedding photos were required before the wedding.

“Wedding photos? Now?” Jiang Luoli looked at him in astonishment.

Mo Shixiu was about to answer when he received another message from Assistant Xu.

[Minister, it might take some time before you can take the wedding photos. Madam’s wedding dress and your gown have not been custom-made yet, and you still need to customize a set of jewelry for her, right? Taking wedding photos is also a very important matter, you can’t take them casually.]

After Mo Shixiu finished looking at it, he put away his phone and said to Jiang Luoli, “We won’t do it today. Today is a very special day. We’ve collected our marriage certificate, we’re husband and wife now. Do you want to celebrate?”

“Celebrate?” Jiang Luoli blinked and looked a little confused. “How?”

“You can celebrate as much as you want.

“I’ll accompany you wherever you want to go.”

Jiang Luoli really didn’t know how to celebrate.

If Qiao Mianmian was in Yun Cheng, she would probably drag her out for a meal.

But she was in another city.

“Luoli, do you have anything you want?” Seeing that she did not say anything for a long time, Mo Shixiu asked another question.

“Something I want?”

“Yes, is there anything you want?”

He wanted to give his wife a present.

A wedding gift.

No matter what she wanted, as long as he could get it for her, he would give it to her.

Jiang Luoli thought about it seriously and felt that she didn’t lack anything.

For a moment, she really could not think of anything she especially wanted.

“No?” Mo Shixiu waited for a while. He lowered his head and thought for a few seconds. Then, he smiled gently and said, “Since you can’t think of it, let me decide for you.”

An hour later.

Jiang Luoli never expected that Mo Shixiu’s wedding gift would be a house and a car.

She looked at the booklet in her hand and was stunned for a while.

A villa in Repulse Bay cost hundreds of millions yuan.

“I’ve thought about it. For a girl, the safest gift should be a house and a car. The environment at Repulse Bay is pretty good. You should like it. As for this Lamborghini, I’ve asked Assistant Xu. He said that girls will definitely like it.

“I got someone to paint it this color. Do you like it?

“If you find anything unsatisfactory, you can tell me.”

Jiang Luoli looked at the pink Lamborghini beside her. “You reserved this car long ago, right?”
