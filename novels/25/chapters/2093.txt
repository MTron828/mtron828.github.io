Chapter 2094: He Was Already Possessed

“That’s right, that’s right.” Yan Shaoqing immediately added, “That dessert is very good. Sis-in-law, you mustn’t miss it! Second Bro, Sis-in-law said that she’ll leave after eating it. Wait a while more.”

Yan Shaoqing pulled Mo Yesi back.

Gong Zeli didn’t move, but he didn’t look too good.

Yan Shaoqing pulled them back and looked at the two of them sitting there silently. He hesitated for a while and sighed. “Second Bro, Fourth Bro, I’m sure you know why I set up this meal today.

“We’ve been brothers for so many years, can we talk about it openly? If there’s a problem, solve it. No matter what, we’ve been brothers for so many years, there’s no need to end up like this.

“We’re good brothers, not enemies. Do you know how f*cking awful it feels to be stuck in the middle like this!”

Yan Shaoqing had thought about it, too.

Instead of beating around the bush and stammering, it was better to be direct.

Lu Rao kept quiet for a while before saying, “That’s right, let’s talk it out. We’ve known each other for so many years, it’s really hard for everyone to be in this state. Is it really so serious that it has to be like this? Is there no way to salvage it?”

“Fourth Bro, Second Bro, say something.” Yan Shaoqing was getting anxious. “Second Bro, I know Fourth Bro is in the wrong, but he…”

Yan Shaoqing pursed his lips when he saw Qiao Mianmian.

“Second Bro, Fourth Bro is in the wrong, but I don’t think he’s totally in the wrong. Can’t you… give him a chance to change?”

“Fourth Bro.” Yan Shaoqing shot Gong Zeli a look. “Hurry and tell Second Bro. Tell him you know your mistake. You won’t do that again.”

Seeing how indifferent Gong Zeli was, Yan Shaoqing panicked.

What was Fourth Bro thinking!

The two parties didn’t react at all. He was the only one anxious.

“Shaoqing, that’s enough.” Gong Zeli turned to look at Mo Yesi and said coldly, “There are some things you don’t understand. You shouldn’t have gotten involved. My relationship with Mo Yesi is over, and we can’t go back to the past.

“This meal you set up today is meaningless.

“If you called me here just for this, then you’re wasting your time.”

Gong Zeli smiled self-mockingly.

How was he going to change it?

Someone was already living in his heart. He couldn’t make that person disappear just because he wanted to.

Just like when he entered the private room and found her here, he couldn’t help but look at her.

Even though he knew that he shouldn’t be staring at her.

Even if he knew that he should control his feelings.

But there were some things that he couldn’t control.

Even though he knew that this wasn’t the right time, he still couldn’t help but look in her direction.

He was already possessed.

In his heart, that devil had become a powerful enemy he couldn’t defeat.

Because he knew his feelings, Gong Zeli knew very well that he and Mo Yesi could never go back to their previous relationship.

Unless he didn’t care about Qiao Mianmian anymore.
