Chapter 535: Young Madam Will Be Spoilt by You Soon

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

He could control her body. But he could never control her heart.

But, who could control anyone’s heart?

“Young Master, that’s all there is to the matter. You shouldn’t worry any further.” Uncle Li felt pity for his young master as Mo Yesi looked worried about his relationship. “Furthermore, Young Madam has already gotten married to you. She’s your wife now. What’s there to worry about?”

Mo Yesi bit on his lip and kept quiet for a moment. Then, he nodded and said, “You’re right. I have nothing to worry about. She’s mine, now and forever.”

He was never going to let her go, even if she didn’t fall in love with him.

She was going to be his forever.

Uncle Li heard what he said and was relieved. He smiled and suggested. “Young Master, if you’re still concerned, you can openly declare your relationship with Young Madam.

“No one would dare to go near her.”

Who would dare to approach Mrs. President of the Mo Corporation?

Whoever that dared to approach her must be seeking death.

“She doesn’t want to declare our relationship.”

Mo Yesi didn’t like to voice his thoughts.

No one would know what he was thinking easily. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

But Uncle Li was someone he trusted.

Uncle Li had been working for the Mo family for more than twenty years. Even though he was technically his chauffeur, Mo Yesi had always treated him as a senior family member.

Hence, he didn’t hide his thoughts from Uncle Li and blurted them out. “She feels that she’s still young and doesn’t want others to know that she got married at such a young age. She wants to focus on her career, and being married will hinder her efforts. I don’t want to force it on her as I don’t want to make her unhappy.”

The industry was more accommodating nowadays and wouldn’t forbid the idols from getting into relationships. Fans were also more willing to accept it if their idols were to get married too. But these were based on the assumption that the idol was popular enough.

If she announced her marriage before she was even a third-rated idol, it would hinder her career development in the future.

Mo Yesi was already aware of it, so he didn’t want to make the announcement.

If she desired to focus on her career, he was going to do everything in his power to help her.

If she didn’t wish to disclose their relationship, then so be it.

These... weren’t important.

What was more important was that she would remain by his side.

That was all he asked for.

Uncle Li kept quiet for a moment before sighing and continuing, “Young Master, you’re spoiling Young Madam. If you’re going to give in to her every request, she will be spoilt soon.”

“She’s my wife. Who else should I be spoiling?” Mo Yesi replied smilingly. “She’s still young, she’s practically a child when compared to me. There’s nothing wrong in giving in to her.”

Uncle Li was speechless.

Alright, whatever floats your boat.

It’s your wife, anyway. It’s up to you to decide how you want to spoil her.

“Let’s go back to the company.”

Mo Yesi waited until Qiao Mianmian was out of sight before shifting his vision back from the car window.

“Yes, Young Master.”

Uncle Li started the car swiftly and joined the traffic.

After being on the road for a few minutes, Mo Yesi saw the pharmacy that they went to as he glanced out the window and immediately frowned.

He was reminded of what the middle-aged woman said.
