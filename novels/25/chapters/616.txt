Chapter 619: Are You Prepared to Be a Bachelor for Life?

She could hit his buttocks when he was younger, and she could still do it now.

Old Madam glared at him with feigned anger. “Ask yourself, how often do you come back? Your work is like your life. No, your work seems more important than your life.

“It’s so hard to get you to come home to see me.

“Having a grandson like you makes me angry. How do I dote on you?”

Old Madam patted Qiao Mianmian’s hand lightly and went all gentle again. “My granddaughter-in-law is so much more obedient.”

“Yes, yes, yes.” Mo Shixiu wasn’t rebutting her. “It’s my fault for upsetting Grandma. I’ve been busy though, and I can’t really find the time to come home. When I’m less busy in the future, I’ll surely come home more often to see you.”

“Hmph.” Old Madam glared at him again. “I’m done listening to you. When have you meant it?”

Mo Shixiu pushed his glasses up his nose bridge and said a little helplessly, “Grandma...”

“Alright, alright. You’re a workaholic who feels ill without your work. I won’t expect you to be free or anything, but when you have the time, settle your personal issues first. That way, your mom and I can set our hearts at ease...”

Mo Shixiu, who’d just been hurried to get married, was speechless.

Old Madam went on, “Once you get married and have a wife at home, you won’t be so hard at work anymore. Ah Si used to be like you too, but now that he’s married, I don’t have to nag at him anymore. He knows he has to spend more time with his wife.”

“I think the best way to cure you of your ‘workaholism’ would be for you to get married.”

Mo Shixiu seemed so helpless.

“Wenpei, he’s not young anymore. It’s about time you started finding a girl for him.”

Mo Shixiu seemed like he really didn’t want Madam Mo to find him a girl. “Mom, Grandma, I don’t have any intention to get married at the moment. Please don’t arrange it for me.

“Do you think I’ll have the time to date anyone, given my state now?”

Old Madam furrowed her brows. “You’ll be 30 in another two years. If you aren’t planning to get married soon, then when? Are you prepared to be a bachelor for life?”

Old Madam was getting upset. “If it were up to me, I’d say give up the Presidency. Given where the Mo family is right now, getting the Presidency would be a bonus, but we can well do without it. You’re already so busy, if you’re really elected as President, I doubt I’ll even get to see you once a year.”

Mo Shixiu dared not say anything more as he saw that Old Madam was genuinely upset.

He swallowed his rebuttal.

He picked up his teacup and slowly sipped some tea.

“Grandma.” Mo Yesi finally stood forward and brought Qiao Mianmian back into his arms. “Big Brother’s issue isn’t urgent, you can talk to him about it again in the future. When Mianmian knew that we were coming over tonight, she especially went to pick a gift for you and Mom. Do you want to take a look?”
