Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Wow, so many of the invited guests this week are my favorites. The lineup is so attractive.”

“Hahaha, I can see Qiao Mianmian and Zhan Bo being funny on the show again.”

“I’m so happy to see Xie Heng. I really like him!”

“Wow, the invited guests for this episode are great. They’re all my favorites. I feel like this episode will definitely be super good. I’m looking forward to it!”

After the official Weibo account of “My Intern Parents” announced the guest recording for the next episode, the invited guests all reposted it.

Qin Han: [It’s my first time doing a variety show. I’m a little nervous. I hope I won’t disappoint everyone.]

Zhan Bo: [I only have one request for this show. I hope that the tasks given to me won’t be too difficult.]

Xie Heng: [I’m very honored to be invited as a guest for the next episode of “My Intern Parents”.]

Xu Min’er: [Baby, you have to lock onto the next episode of “My Internal Parents”.]

Zhizhi: [Sigh, I’m so happy to be able to record this episode with so many seniors.]

Qiao Mianmian reposted it too: [I’m looking forward to it, but I’m also a little afraid. I hope I can be a qualified intern mother.]

After she reposted it, her fans mocked her in the comment section.

Baby Qiao: [Hahaha, Mianbao, are you afraid that you don’t know how to take care of children?]

Mianbao’s Little Wife: [Mianbao will have experience in raising children after this episode. I can consider having a baby with Chairman Mo when I get back!]

Mo Qiao’s CP remained the same for a hundred years: [Why would Mianmian suddenly participate in this show? Is she really planning to have a baby with Chairman Mo! Mianmian and Chairman Mo are both so good-looking, you have to have more babies. Otherwise, it’ll be a waste of your exceptional genes!] Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

The comment section was filled with comments asking Qiao Mianmian and Mo Yesi to have more babies.

Some even said that Qiao Mianmian had to go through menopause.

Qiao Mianmian: “…”

The fans were too controlling.

They tried to control the world, and now they were even trying to control her childbirth.

What was worse was that they said she had to give birth to eight or ten children.

Qiao Mianmian didn’t know that not only were her fans making a furor on her post, but they were also rushing Mo Yesi’s Weibo.

A bunch of fans posted on Mo Yesi’s Weibo account, asking him when he was planning to have a baby with Qiao Mianmian.

When Qiao Mianmian found out that her fans actually went to Mo Yesi’s Weibo to urge him to give birth, she was angry and amused.

She thought Mo Yesi was going to complain to her.

Unexpectedly, the man smiled and said, “Your fan’s suggestion isn’t wrong. With good genes, we should have a few more children.”

Qiao Mianmian couldn’t believe her ears. “Mo Yesi, you actually agree with them? Don’t tell me you really want me to give you more children?”

“That’s not it.” Mo Yesi had just finished dealing with a few documents. He threw his pen aside, got up, and slowly sat down beside her. He reached out and gently pulled her into his arms.

“I can’t bear to let you suffer a few more times.”
