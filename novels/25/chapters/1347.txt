Chapter 1350: Have You Thought It Over?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Bai Yusheng was speechless.

He really had to take his hat off to her.

They’d just gotten married, and she was already talking about divorce.

She didn’t have to love her daughter so much.

He felt that if Qiao Mianmian hadn’t been given to the Qiao family when she was young, she’d probably have been pampered to no end.

...

Madam Bai lived opposite Qiao Mianmian, so Qiao Mianmian wasn’t in a hurry to go back.

She chatted with Madam Bai for a long time.

If Bai Yusheng hadn’t said that Qiao Mianmian had to wake up the next morning, Madam Bai wouldn’t have let her go.

It was almost 10 pm when Qiao Mianmian left Madam Bai’s place.

She returned to her room and took a shower.

As she walked out of the bathroom, she heard her cell phone ringing.

It was Mo Yesi.

She wiped her hair and hands and picked it up.

“Baby, what are you doing?” The man’s voice was low and magnetic.

“I was showering.”

“Showering?”

“Mm.”

A video invitation popped up on WeChat.

It was from Mo Yesi. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Qiao Mianmian accepted it, then a handsome face appeared on the screen.

Mo Yesi must have just showered. His hair was still wet, and he was wearing a black sleeping robe.

He was drying his hair with a towel.

After Qiao Mianmian accepted the video call, Mo Yesi threw the towel aside.

“You just showered too?” Qiao Mianmian asked.

“Mm.” Mo Yesi narrowed his eyes. Through the screen, Qiao Mianmian could feel the man’s burning gaze.

“Why are you wearing so little?” Mo Yesi’s voice seemed a little hoarse.

Wearing so little?

Qiao Mianmian looked down at her nightgown.

She was wearing a purple negligee that could be worn at home or out.

Besides revealing her shoulder and collarbone, there was nothing else.

She... was wearing a lot.

Moreover, she was at home. She could wear whatever she liked.

“What did you eat tonight? Did the shoot go well today?” Mo Yesi quickly changed the topic.

Qiao Mianmian didn’t probe further and answered him honestly.

“You ate with someone else tonight?” Mo Yesi asked.

Qiao Mianmian nodded.

She told Mo Yesi about Madam Bai flying to City F.

Mo Yesi wasn’t surprised.

It was normal for Madam Bai to do this.

He could tell that she treasured Qiao Mianmian so much.

She must not want to be apart from her daughter for too long.

Mo Yesi felt more at ease with Madam Bai taking care of Qiao Mianmian.

“Mo Yesi...”

“Mm?”

“I want to tell you something.”

“Mm, go ahead.”

“I’ve decided to return to the Bai family. Mom and Brother treat me especially well. They’ve always hoped that I can return. My parents were forced to do so back then, so they can’t be blamed. They’re my relatives by blood, and they’ve never done anything to let me down. I... have no reason to deny them.”

Mo Yesi nodded and asked, “Have you thought it through?”

“Mm, I’ve thought it through. Actually, I’ve been thinking about it since that day.”

“It’s good that you’ve thought it through. Chen Chen has already talked to my second uncle, and he agreed to return to the Mo family. Grandma said that it’d be easier for Chen Chen to acknowledge his ancestors and come back in glory.”
