Chapter 787: I’ll Give You One

“Alright.”

Qiao Mianmian knew better than to ask.

“Mr. Gong, are you done?” Qiao Mianmian picked up the blindfold again. “If there’s nothing else, I’d like to sleep for a while.”

She was holding a pink cartoon eye mask.

It looked so cute.

Gong Zeli thought that he must have gone crazy because he asked, “Where did you get that eye mask? It’s pretty cute, I want one too.”

He wanted to slap himself.

Damn, retard!

Why did he ask such a stupid question?

What was he thinking?

Qiao Mianmian’s hand trembled as well.

Why did she feel like Gong Zeli was acting weird today?

He was completely different from the person she knew.

She felt that she was more used to his cold self.

At least, she would think that he was normal.

But now...

It was scary. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“This eye mask... I bought it on Taobao. I can buy three for 10 yuan.” Qiao Mianmian thought for a while and reached into her bag.

After a while, Gong Zeli saw her take out a new eye mask from her bag.

It was also pink, but it was a bunny’s cartoon eye mask.

She handed the bunny eye mask to him and said shyly, “If Mr. Gong likes it, I’ll give you one. Just take it as...”

Qiao Mianmian stopped mid-sentence.

She wanted to say it as repayment for helping her.

But after thinking about it, she felt that it was a little insulting for her to use a 10 yuan eye mask for Gong Zeli’s help.

People like them couldn’t even be bothered to look at others even if they begged for help.

After all, they were all rich and powerful.

He was willing to help because of their friendship.

Her ten yuan eye mask... was too shabby.

Just as she was starting to regret it and was about to take the blindfold back, Gong Zeli suddenly reached out and took it away before she could react.

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

Wasn’t this too fast?

“Mr. Gong, you...” Before she could retract her hand, the eye mask was gone.

“Ahem.” Gong Zeli also felt that his actions didn’t match his identity. He covered his mouth and coughed twice before turning around to put the little bunny eye mask on.

“I happen to need an eye mask. Although it’s a little feminine, it can still be used. Erm... thank you.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

She sounded as if she was forcing him to use it.

He was the one who snatched it just now.

Forget it, she couldn’t be bothered to argue with him.

It was only 10 yuan, so she didn’t feel bad giving it away.

Qiao Mianmian was a little sleepy too.

She stayed up late with Mo Yesi last night and woke up early in the morning. She didn’t have enough sleep.

She closed her eyes and put on the blindfold before turning around and falling asleep with her back facing Gong Zeli.

She was really sleepy.

Soon, she fell asleep.
