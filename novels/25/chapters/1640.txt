Chapter 1641: I’ll Take You Away Now, Let’s Go Home

What if this traumatized him?

Hence, Assistant Xu looked at Xie Zewen with hostility.

“Luo Li’s here.” Xie Zewen took a deep breath and mustered his courage to look at Mo Shixiu again. He hesitated for a while and asked softly, “May I ask if the gentleman behind is Mr. Mo Shixiu?”

Mo Shixiu looked at him and nodded. Anxious to see Jiang Luoli, he asked directly, “Mister, are you Luoli’s friend? I’m very worried about her. Can I go in and look for her?”

Even though Mo Shixiu was in a high position, he didn’t show any superiority in front of Xie Zewen.

He stood outside and didn’t enter without Xie Zewen’s permission.

Xie Zewen felt this too.

Mo Shixiu’s behavior made him even more upset.

He had to admit that this was a very outstanding man.

If he was Jiang Luoli, who would he choose?

The answer was obvious.

In front of a man like Mo Shixiu, could women still see other men?

Xie Zewen finally gave up.

He stood aside and gave up. “Of course, Luoli is inside. Mr. Mo, please come in.”

With his permission, Mo Shixiu didn’t delay for a second. He nodded and immediately entered the room.

He saw Jiang Luoli walking out of a bedroom.

Their eyes met.

Jiang Luoli stared at him for a few seconds before running towards him.

“Mo Shixiu.”

She cried out in an aggrieved voice and hugged him tightly.

Mo Shixiu would usually push her away if someone else was around.

Deep down, he was a rather conservative person and felt that public intimacy wasn’t good.

But at this moment, Mo Shixiu hugged the girl tightly.

Jiang Luoli leaned against his chest and heard his steady heartbeat accelerate.

She smelled the familiar scent of the man and felt a sense of security return. The uneasiness in her heart vanished.

Mo Shixiu really came to look for her.

At this moment, Jiang Luoli felt extremely at ease in his arms. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

She knew that as long as Mo Shixiu was by her side, no one could hurt her.

He would protect her well.

Even if they hadn’t been together for long, even if she didn’t know this man very well.

But she trusted him.

“Luoli, don’t be afraid.” Mo Shixiu hugged the girl in his arms and felt at ease.

On the plane, he thought of countless possibilities.

Every possibility scared him.

Although he wouldn’t leave her no matter what happened, if she was hurt, it wouldn’t be easy to make up for it.

But thankfully, nothing happened.

She looked fine and was in his arms.

“Luoli, don’t be afraid. I’m already by your side. With me around, no one can hurt you.” Mo Shixiu reached out and patted her head. His voice was unprecedentedly gentle. “I’ll take you away now. Let’s go home.”
