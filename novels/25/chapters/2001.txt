Chapter 2004: My Heart Hurts More for My Daughter

“Mianmian, why are you here?” Madam Bai turned around and looked at her daughter affectionately. “Are you hungry? Do you want to eat something first? I’ll be done in 10 minutes at most. If you’re hungry, you can...”

“Mom, I’m not hungry.” Qiao Mianmian walked to Madam Bai and looked at the dishes on the table. She rolled up her sleeves and said, “Let me help you.”

“Go, go, go. Go out quickly.” Madam Bai reached out and gently pushed her. “You can just go out and wait. Don’t smell like oil and smoke.”

“Mom, I have nothing to do anyway.” Qiao Mianmian called a housemaid over and got her to get an apron. She put it on and started cutting the vegetables. “You’ve always been the one cooking for me. I’ll make two dishes for you today. But my culinary skills aren’t as good as yours. Mom, don’t mind me.”

Madam Bai didn’t stop her anymore.

When she heard that her daughter wanted to cook for her, she said in relief, “How could I dislike it? As long as it’s made by you, I’ll like it no matter what it is. I just feel that you must be tired after just coming back and want you to rest more.”

“I’m not tired.” Qiao Mianmian turned around and smiled at her. “Mom, I’m really not tired at all. I’ll cook the remaining two dishes, you go rest.”

Madam Bai felt heartache as she watched her skillful cutting.

If it was another family’s daughter, she wouldn’t do this.

Every one of them had been served since they were young.

Not to mention cooking, if Qiao Mianmian had grown up in the Bai family, she would be like a child who grew up in a honey pot. She wouldn’t have to learn to do such trivial household chores.

As she thought about it, Madam Bai’s heart ached for her daughter.

“Mianmian, why don’t you move back here for a while? This way, I can help you recuperate. We can spend a few more days together. Mom really can’t bear for you to leave so soon. We’ve been apart for more than 10 years, and you’re rarely home. Mom misses you and can’t see you often.”

Qiao Mianmian couldn’t agree to Madam Bai’s request.

She wasn’t alone.

Moreover, she had promised Mo Yesi that she would accompany him after this.

If she stayed in the Bai family, Mo Yesi would definitely feel uncomfortable even if he didn’t say anything.

“Mom, I’ve already made an appointment with Mo Yesi. He’ll take me overseas to play. I’ve already let him down once, I don’t want to fail him again. I’ll come back often to accompany you when I’m free in the future, alright?”

Madam Bai looked disappointed.

But she knew that her request was inappropriate.

Her daughter was married.

It wasn’t realistic for her to abandon her husband and return to her parents’ house.Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

That would be unreasonable.

If Qiao Mianmian really agreed to move back, the Mo family would definitely object.

“Mom is just saying. Take it that I didn’t say anything.” Madam Bai went forward and held her hand. “As long as my Little Seven is happy and comes back to see me occasionally, Mom will be satisfied.”

...

After eating, Qiao Mianmian took a nap before leaving the Bai family.

She scrolled through Weibo in the car.

She was shocked to see that, after Mo Yesi’s post, the news disappeared.
