Chapter 883: Quickly Send Him to the Hospital

But it was already a serious injury. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

To an artiste, every part of their body was important.

Especially the face and the hands.

What really made Michael angry wasn’t that he felt that his future interests would be affected, but that he really felt sorry for Tu Yilei.

He was the one who groomed this artiste.

It was as if he was raising his own child. It wasn’t easy to bring this child up.

But this happened all of a sudden.

This damn child valued love more than anything else. He didn’t even cherish his body anymore.

This was what angered Michael the most.

If he helped to block the sulfuric acid now, why would he help in the future?

If Qiao Mianmian was in danger and needed his help, would he be willing to risk his life?

“I’ve said it before, I did it willingly. It has nothing to do with Miss Qiao.” Tu Yilei took a deep breath and endured the burning pain. “If you continue to talk bad about Miss Qiao, you’re forcing me to be angry with you.

“Under such circumstances, if I don’t help, do I have to watch her pour the acid on Miss Qiao’s face?”

Tu Yilei looked up at Qiao Mianmian standing not too far away unscathed and smiled. “Thank goodness Miss Qiao is alright.”

The wound on the back of his hand was worth it.

Qiao Mianmian’s heart ached when she heard this.

She recalled how she’d deliberately distanced herself from him and avoided him for various reasons.

She was so cold to him.

Their relationship was worse than that of ordinary friends.

But at this critical moment, he still chose to stand in front of her despite knowing the consequences.

He had taken that blow for her.

Michael was right. The sulfuric acid was supposed to hit her.

The injured person should have been her.

If Tu Yilei hadn’t pushed her away and stood in front of her, she wouldn’t be unscathed.

Even though he did it willingly.

But he did help her.

And she... owed him a huge favor.

She didn’t know how to repay him.

“Senior Tu.” Qiao Mianmian felt guilty and even more ashamed of her previous actions. Her eyes were slightly red as she said, “I’m sorry, it’s all because of me that you...”

“It’s alright.” Tu Yilei’s pale lips curled into a gentle smile as he comforted her softly. “I’ve said it before, I did it willingly. Under such circumstances, any man would choose to do the same.”

Michael was practically smoking.

Damn it. “Under those circumstances, any man would choose to do the same.” He wasn’t one of them.

If it was him, he wouldn’t take the risk of being disfigured.

No other man would.

Only a fool like him would do that.

He’d already done it. Did he think other men were as silly as him!

He was practically a fool who was blinded by love. Who knew when he would throw his life away.

There was such a huge commotion.

Soon, the rest of the crew arrived.

Bai Yusheng hurried towards them. When he saw the burn on the back of Tu Yilei’s hand, his expression changed slightly. “What’s going on? What are you waiting for? Quickly send him to the hospital.”
