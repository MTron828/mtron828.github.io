Chapter 713: He Likes This Girl

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Even if he was angry or jealous, he should be reasonable.

“You still haven’t picked it up?” Bai Yusheng looked at the girl beside him, whose eyes were red as if she was going to cry at any moment. He didn’t know why, but his heart ached for her.

But it had nothing to do with love.

It had nothing to do with friendship.

He and Qiao Mianmian weren’t friends.

But he could feel that he liked this girl.

When he was with her, he would feel relaxed and happy.

He couldn’t help but want to be more intimate with her.

For example, now he wanted to pat her on the head and console her.

Bai Yusheng had always been a man of action. Just as he thought of this, he placed a hand on Qiao Mianmian’s head and rubbed it gently. “What’s there to be sad about? If your boyfriend didn’t pick up your call because he’s angry, it shows that he cares a lot about you.

“That’s why he’s jealous.

“This is just his normal reaction. If he weren’t angry and didn’t mind it at all, you’d be really sad. When he’s over it, he’ll come and look for you. You’re already so old, don’t cry so easily, okay?

“If he doesn’t pick up your call, then don’t call him anymore. When he wants to look for you, he’ll look for you.”

Bai Yusheng was a little upset with Mo Yesi.

He was a grown man, and yet he was angry with his woman over such a trivial matter.

What kind of man was he?

When he was neglecting his woman, had he never thought that doing this would hurt her?

Bai Yusheng decided to teach Mo Yesi a lesson.

He wanted him to be even more arrogant.

He hated it when women shed tears.

Especially when this little girl’s eyes turned red. He suddenly felt uncomfortable.

Qiao Mianmian was about to call him again, but after hearing what Bai Yusheng said, she blinked her teary eyes and asked skeptically, “Is this alright? He must be angry with me now and is waiting for me to coax him. If I ignore him, won’t he be even angrier?” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“No.”

Bai Yusheng said firmly, “I’m a man. I know better than you what a man thinks. Listen to me, don’t bother about him from now on. Don’t call him or text him. If he comes to look for you, don’t bother about him.

“Let him off for a while. I promise he won’t do this to you again.”

“He’s looking for me, but I’m ignoring him? Isn’t this a little inappropriate?”

“There’s nothing bad about it.” Bai Yusheng looked very experienced. “Men are cheap. The more you don’t take him seriously, the more he’ll take you seriously. The more you show concern for him, the smugger he’ll be.

“Listen to me, at least keep him cold for a night. If he looks for you tomorrow, you can talk to him.

“If he cared enough about you, he wouldn’t have stopped looking for you just because you ignored him the whole night.

“Just treat it as a test for him.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

She felt that what Bai Yusheng said made sense.

Moreover, he didn’t have to lie to her.

Men knew men better.

But was she really going to do this?

She was worried that Mo Yesi would be even angrier if she did that.

“Why, you don’t trust me?” Bai Yusheng raised an eyebrow.

“No.” Qiao Mianmian hurriedly shook her head. “I just feel that my boyfriend is different from other men. I’m afraid he’ll be even angrier if I do this.”
