Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Let me change my approach. When was the last time you two did it?”

Mo Yesi froze and became uneasy. He stayed silent for a while before replying unwillingly, “We have never done it ever since that night.”

Yan Shaoqing was speechless.

“That can’t be, Second Bro. You’re so lousy. You two were married yet didn’t do it? Could it be that she didn’t want to do it with you?”

Mo Yesi was speechless.

He wasn’t going to admit to something so embarrassing.

“She really didn’t want to do it with you?” Yan Shaoqing laughed as he couldn’t contain his laughter any further. “That can’t be. Second Bro, you’re so handsome and have such a nice body. No woman can resist you, right?

“Sis-in-law rejected you? How could she bear to reject you? Could it be that you performed really badly that night and she was traumatized by it, and...”

Mo Yesi frowned and interrupted him impatiently. “She’s not aware of what happened that night.”

There was no response.

Yan Shaoqing was speechless.

“That can’t be, Second Bro. What’s the matter with you two?” Yan Shaoqing was puzzled. “You mean that she doesn’t know that she did it with you that night? Aren’t you planning on telling her?” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Mo Yesi fell silent for a while before replying, “She hates everything that happened that night. I’m worried that if I told her everything, she would hate me.”

“But you can’t keep her in the dark forever.”

“I know.”

“Second Bro, you messed up.” Yan Shaoqing sighed.

Mo Yesi blinked. “What do you mean?”

Yan Shaoqing sighed again. “The way I see it, you care way more about Sis-in-law than Sis-in-law cares about you. It’s because of how much you care about her feelings that you are so worried.

“You’re worried that if you confess to her about this matter, she would hate you and leave you, right?”

Mo Yesi fell silent.

So, he was afraid all along.

“I knew it. Everyone becomes insecure when they fall in love. I never thought this would happen to you.”

Yan Shaoqing wasn’t making fun of him.

He was just surprised.

In the past, Mo Yesi was always calm and composed. He didn’t seem to have any desires and would never fall in love with anyone.

Who would’ve thought that it would be like this when he fell in love?

He was such a prideful man.

But he was still afraid of losing the one he loved.

“Don’t worry too much about it, Second Bro. Everyone performs badly occasionally. Why don’t you try again? Just keep doing it. There’s no way that it won’t work out.”

Then, he continued to share his previous experiences.

By the time Mo Yesi hung up the call, he realized that the conversation actually lasted for 46 minutes and 58 seconds.

...

When Mo Yesi went downstairs, he couldn’t find Qiao Mianmian.

He looked for Lei En and asked, “Where is Young Madam?”

Lei En was puzzled. “Young Madam mentioned that she had to sign a contract today. Hence, she didn’t wait for you. Did she not mention it to you?”

Lei En was puzzled.

Did Young Master and Young Madam fight?

Mo Yesi was surprised. “She left already?”

“Yes.”

Lei En could feel Mo Yesi’s anger the moment he ended his sentence.
