Chapter 1740: Deal With This Little Star Immediately

“Gong Zeli actually dared to hit Qingqing.

“Back then, the Gong’s agreed to take good care of Qingqing, so I let her stay there. Is this how they treat Qingqing? They’re really disrespecting her.”

“Chairman, please calm down.” Xu Jie saw that Shangguan Hua was red with anger and quickly tried to persuade him. “I’m afraid this can’t be blamed on the rest of the Gong Family. Even Madam Gong can’t control Young Master Gong’s temper. Madam Gong must really like Miss, but Young Master Gong...

“I saw that the little celebrity in the video is pretty. Young Master Gong might have done something so irrational because he was bewitched by her.”

Shangguan Hua watched the video again and glared at Qiao Mianmian. “Who is this woman?”

Xu Jie followed his gaze and replied, “It’s a small celebrity. She seems to have known Young Master Gong for a long time. Young Master Gong had a few scandals with her previously.”

“A small star?” Shangguan Hua sneered. “Since when did my daughter have to be bullied by an actress? Get rid of this small star immediately.”

Xu Jie hesitated. “Then, about Young Master Gong...”

“What’s wrong with him? I don’t believe he’ll make trouble with my Shangguan Family for a small celebrity. Since my precious daughter was wronged because of her, I have to teach her a lesson. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Since she’s in the entertainment industry, let her disappear completely.”

“Yes, Chairman. I’ll arrange it right away.”

Half an hour later.

Xu Jie hurriedly knocked on the Chairman’s office door.

“Chairman.”

He quickly walked to the desk.

Shangguan Hua put down the document in his hand and looked up at him. “What’s wrong? Have you done what I asked you to do? Was that little celebrity banned?”

“Chairman, we can’t ban her.” Xu Jie recalled the information he had found. When he met Shangguan Hua’s dissatisfied and confused gaze, he hurriedly said, “I just checked on that small star. Not only does she have a backing, but that backing is actually Mo Yesi.

“I think the reason why the Mo Corporation suddenly canceled their collaboration with our Heng Yuan Corporation is related to that little celebrity?

“Mo Yesi wanted to stand up for her, so he canceled the cooperation.

“Correspondingly, the cooperation was indeed canceled after Miss and that celebrity had a conflict.”

Shangguan Hua was shocked.

He stood up and placed a hand on the table. “You’re saying that the celebrity’s backing is Mo Yesi?”

“Yes. Also, she’s Mo Yesi’s girlfriend. Mo Yesi takes this girlfriend very seriously. Previously, Boss Huang flirted with her, and his company was suddenly investigated.

“And the Su Corporation’s acquisition seems to be because of this little celebrity, too.

“Initially, the Mo Corporation and our Heng Yuan Corporation had already agreed on the project, and they would officially sign the contract in two days. If it wasn’t for this suddenly happening and Mo Yesi getting angry, he wouldn’t have canceled the cooperation at this point.

“After thinking about it, it should be because of this.”

Shangguan Hua didn’t expect that the Mo Corporation would suddenly cancel the cooperation because of a woman.

What surprised him even more was that Mo Yesi was actually such a person.
