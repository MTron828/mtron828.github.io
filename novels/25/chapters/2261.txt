Chapter 2262: Really Famous

In just three days, Qiao Mianmian’s fans had risen by a few million.

Linda had received countless advertisement and variety show offers. Moreover, the advertisement invitations had already reached the eight-figure range.

This was a treatment only popular A-list celebrities received.

Qiao Mianmian was really popular.

Linda took the opportunity to accept a high-end jewelry advertisement.

The jewelry brand’s name was ONE, and it focused on the theme and concept of “the one and only” in this lifetime. Previously, the people who endorsed ONE were all A-list or S-list celebrities. Qiao Mianmian taking this endorsement meant that her value had risen.

In the luxuriously decorated office, Shen Rou was listening to a report.

“Chairman Shen, our jewelry store is ready to sign Little Xiao as this season’s spokesperson. Little Xiao is now a popular star in the entertainment industry. She recently participated in a variety show, and the reception is very good. We’ll use her rise in popularity to increase our sales.

“Moreover, Little Xiao’s appearance and temperament are very suitable for the image of our Weiai Jewelry. Little Xiao is known as the Queen of Goods in the industry. The few brands she signed previously have very good sales results.

“Weiai’s new product is on the market, we need to publicize it. We all think that signing Little Xiao is a good choice. Moreover, Little Xiao’s price is very low this time. We’ll be gaining on both ends.”

“Little Xiao?”

“Yes.” The assistant nodded and handed her a document. “Chairman Shen, this is Little Xiao’s personal information. Is it suitable for you to take a look?”

Shen Rou took it and flipped through a few pages before placing it on the desk.

She narrowed her eyes. “Mm, it looks good. But why does this name sound familiar?”

“Little Xiao is a popular celebrity. Chairman Shen might have seen her on the news before.”

Shen Rou narrowed her eyes and thought for a while.

Wasn’t this Little Xiao the female artiste who had a conflict with Qiao Mianmian?

Shen Rou didn’t care about the entertainment industry, but she couldn’t help but pay attention to Qiao Mianmian.

When she remembered who Little Xiao was, she looked up and said, “Mm, let’s sign her.”

“Alright, Chairman Shen. I’ll do it right away.”

Shen Rou nodded and said, “Let me know the day you sign the contract with her. I’ll go and take a look.”

“Yes, Chairman Shen.

“Also, we’ve managed to get the cooperation we stole from the Mo Corporation. If nothing goes wrong, we should be able to sign the contract in a few days.”

“Is that so?” Shen Rou smiled. “That’s good. You have to discuss this with him personally. You can’t make any mistakes at this juncture.”

“Yes, Chairman Shen.” The assistant looked up at her and hesitated. “But, Chairman Shen…”

“But what?” Shen Rou picked up the cup of coffee and took a sip. Because of what her assistant had just reported, she felt much better.

She wanted to deal with the Mo Corporation.
