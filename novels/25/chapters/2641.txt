Chapter 2642: Is She Crazy?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“If you don’t come on stage, I’ll take your trophy away.”

Shen Fei’s joke made the audience burst into laughter.

“Qiao Mianmian, congratulations.” The artiste sitting beside Qiao Mianmian smiled and congratulated her. Seeing that she was still in a daze, she smiled and reminded her. “Go on stage to receive the award.”

Only then did Qiao Mianmian confirm that she hadn’t heard wrongly.

It was really her.

She looked at the artiste beside her and then at Shen Fei, who was standing on stage and gesturing at her. Although she was sure that she’d won the award, she was still puzzled and couldn’t figure out what was going on.

How did she get the award?

She only received the Best Female Lead nomination.

But now wasn’t the time to be confused. After Qiao Mianmian confirmed that she’d won the award, she quickly composed her expression and walked up the stage.

In the back row.

Song Fei looked at Qiao Mianmian as she took the trophy from Shen Fei. In her extreme anger and unwillingness, she actually lost her rationality and stood up. She shouted towards the stage, “There’s a conspiracy, there must be a conspiracy behind this award.

“It can’t be Qiao Mianmian. There must be something behind this. I object. I don’t accept this outcome.”

Everyone was silent for two seconds. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Everyone looked at her in shock.

The Golden Globe Awards had been held so many times.

This had never happened before.

An artiste actually didn’t acknowledge the outcome of the judging panel and directly protested at the venue, saying that there was a conspiracy.

Which artiste was this?

Was she crazy?

Did she know what she was doing?

No one questioned the fairness of the judges.

She actually said such things during the live broadcast.

Wasn’t this saying that the judges were unfair?

What level were the judges of the Golden Globe Awards?

They were all big shots in the industry.

Did she not want to work in this industry anymore?

Song Fei’s manager was also present. Seeing her actions, her manager was about to have a heart attack.

She also felt that Song Fei was crazy.

It didn’t matter if there was a conspiracy behind this award. She couldn’t possibly say it out loud.

Everyone was watching.

How many eyes watching it?

Was she out of her mind?

How could there be such a stupid artiste under her?

Did she think she was still in the office?

That everyone had to listen to her and take her seriously?

After a few seconds of silence.

The emcee was the first to react. Her mind raced as she thought about how to save the situation.

After all, this was the first time such a thing happened in her hosting career.

Hence, she was stunned for a while.

“Erm, is the person speaking from below the stage Song Fei?” The emcee tried to appear natural. “Stop joking with us. Haha, is everyone shocked? This is a segment that our production crew arranged beforehand. It seems like the effect is good, hahaha.

“Alright, this little episode is over.. Song Fei, sit down. We—”
