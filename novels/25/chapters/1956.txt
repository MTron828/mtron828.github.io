Chapter 1959: Would She Really Care About Me That Much?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

That day when Mo Shixiu brought her back to the Mo Residence, Madam Mo had mentioned this matter.

At that time, Jiang Luoli thought that Madam Mo was just acting and pretending to care for her. She didn’t really want her to stay at the Mo Residence.

But now that Madam Mo mentioned this matter again, Jiang Luoli felt that something was wrong.

Madam Mo really wanted her to move to the Mo Residence.

However, Jiang Luoli didn’t think that she was really worried about her and wanted her to move over.

Although she didn’t know what Madam Mo’s motive was, she was still wary of her.

She directly rejected Madam Mo’s suggestion.

.

She smiled and said, “Mom, I’m living quite well here. Sister Lin has been taking care of me and there are many people at home. Don’t worry.”

Since she wasn’t willing to go, Madam Mo couldn’t force her either.

However, after Jiang Luoli tactfully rejected her, Madam Mo’s expression clearly turned ugly.

“Yes, Madam.” Sister Lin glanced at Madam Mo’s expression and smiled. “Madam, don’t worry. Everyone here will do our best to take care of Young Madam.”

“Of course I’m not worried.” Madam Mo curved her lips, but there was no smile in her eyes. “I’m just suggesting that she can stay wherever she likes.”

...

Madam Mo didn’t stay for long. She left before half an hour had passed.

After she left, Jiang Luoli frowned and asked Qiao Mianmian, “Baby, what do you think she meant? Why does she want me to move in with them so badly?”

“Is she worried about your baby? Will she be able to see you every day after you move in and take care of you?” Qiao Mianmian analyzed for her.

“I think so, too. But do you think that’s possible? It’s not like you don’t know... how much she doesn’t like me. Would she really care about me that much?”

Jiang Luoli was referring to Madam Mo.

Qiao Mianmian fell silent.

Actually, she didn’t believe that Madam Mo would really care so much about Jiang Luoli.

After Jiang Luoli rejected Madam Mo’s suggestion, Qiao Mianmian saw that her expression had darkened.

Obviously, Madam Mo did not ask Jiang Luoli to move in with her out of concern. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Then, why did Madam Mo do it?

Qiao Mianmian couldn’t think of a reason, and neither could Jiang Luoli.

Even Madam Mo’s sudden change in attitude was something they couldn’t figure out.

After thinking about it, it should be because of the baby.

“You also think it’s impossible, right?” Jiang Luoli smiled, but her eyes were mocking. “She has always looked down on me. Even though I’m pregnant now, she still looks down on me.

“I can feel it.

“But that’s nothing.” Jiang Luoli smiled again and said indifferently, “As long as Mo Shixiu treats me well.”

...

Qiao Mianmian had wanted to stay over for dinner at Jiang Luoli’s place, but her plans changed after Linda called her.

At a café.

Qiao Mianmian walked into a private booth and Linda waved at her.

She sat down and removed her mask. “Sister Xie.”

“Mianmian, I originally wanted to give you a few more days off, so that you can spend more time with President Mo. However, the television drama you’re starring in is about to start airing soon, so you have to cooperate with the production team in the publicity these few days. This is your upcoming schedule, take a look.”
