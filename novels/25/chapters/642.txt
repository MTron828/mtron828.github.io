Chapter 643: I Don’t Want to See Another Woman, I Just Want to See You

Mo Yesi looked down at her. “I heard everything. Congratulations, you have an assistant now.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

This was his reaction?

“Have you seen it?”

“What are you looking at?”

“My assistant.”

Qiao Mianmian waved the cell phone in front of him and then pointed at the girl on the screen. “This girl is my assistant, Nana. How is she, isn’t she cute?”

Qiao Mianmian really found her adorable.

Nana looked like a little loli with a round face and dimples when she smiled.

Especially cute. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

If she was a boy, she would definitely like girls like Nana.

It made people want to protect her.

Mo Yesi wasn’t interested in any other woman besides Qiao Mianmian.

In order not to dampen her spirits, he glanced at her.

“How is it, isn’t she cute?” Qiao Mianmian immediately asked.

Mo Yesi was speechless.

He wondered if this was a test.

Was he trying to test if he was interested in other women?

With that thought in mind, he immediately replied, “Average. Not as cute as my wife.”

He really thought so too.

In his eyes, his wife was the cutest.

No one could compare.

It didn’t matter to him whether other women were sexy, cute, or innocent.

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

“What’s with the look in your eyes?” She looked at him in disdain. “She’s so cute. Shouldn’t a girl like her be the type that you straight men like the most? Do you really think she’s average? Take a good look at her.”

“Straight guy?” Mo Yesi was unfamiliar with this rank.

Qiao Mianmian replied, “It’s what a normal guy would think.”

Mo Yesi nodded. “Then, I might be abnormal.”

Qiao Mianmian was confused.

Mo Yesi looked at her with his deep and dark eyes and said seriously, “It’s the same no matter how many times I look at her. She’s not as good-looking as my wife. I don’t know what type straight guys like, I just know that you’re my type.”

He looked serious when he said this.

Qiao Mianmian’s heart skipped a beat as he stared at him.

She got flirted with again.

“I don’t want to see other women, I just want to see you.” The man continued to tease her. “My wife is the most beautiful woman in the world.”

“Mo Yesi, can you...” Qiao Mianmian blushed.

“Mm?”

“Don’t exaggerate.”

“How is it an exaggeration?”

“Just now, you...” She bit her lip and wanted to repeat what he’d just said, but she felt a little embarrassed. “You said something about me being the most beautiful in the world.”

“I’m not exaggerating.” Mo Yesi looked serious. “In my eyes, you’re the most beautiful woman in the world.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

Damn it, her heart was racing again.

Did he really not do it on purpose?

“Ahem, alright.” Qiao Mianmian touched her cheeks and bit her lip. “You can say that in private, but don’t say it in front of outsiders.”

“Why?” Mo Yesi raised an eyebrow. “What’s there not to say?”

Qiao Mianmian said, “... Keep a low profile, do you understand?”
