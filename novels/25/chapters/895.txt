Chapter 896: He’s Your Benefactor Now, No One Can Talk About Him

“I didn’t sound so nice just now. Did I scare you? Why are you crying? Don’t cry, alright?”

“Mo Yesi, you’re being mean to me!” Qiao Mianmian couldn’t help but tear up after being coaxed by him. She bit her lip and scolded. “I was so scared, why are you still being mean to me?

“Do you know how dangerous it was? I almost... almost got disfigured.” nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Disfigurement was worse than death for girls.

Qiao Mianmian still felt a lingering fear at the mention of this.

If Tu Yilei hadn’t stood in front of her.

She didn’t dare to think about the consequences...

The thought of it sent shivers down her spine.

She felt even more aggrieved now that she was afraid. “You don’t even know how to console me. How could you be so mean to me?

“You’re too much...

“I don’t want to talk to you anymore...”

“Baby, don’t cry anymore. It’s my fault.” Mo Yesi wasn’t afraid of anything. He was most afraid of Qiao Mianmian’s tears. When he heard her crying, he immediately comforted her.

No matter who was at fault.

It was his fault for making his wife cry.

Since he was in the wrong, he had to apologize.

“You weren’t good, to begin with!” Qiao Mianmian wiped her tears and said aggrievedly, “You were fierce to me!”

“I’m sorry, Baby.”

“You blame me for not calling you immediately. You blame me for not telling you when something happened. But if I didn’t want you to worry and delay your work, would I not have told you?

“Mo Yesi, I just don’t want to affect you and bring you too much trouble.”

“I know, Baby. I was wrong.” Mo Yesi apologized profusely. “I didn’t mean to scold you. I was too worried about you, so I couldn’t control my emotions. Do you know how scared I was when I heard that you were almost splashed with acid?”

“You’re blaming yourself?” Qiao Mianmian wiped her tears and snorted. “Why are you blaming yourself?”

“I blame myself for not standing up for you and protecting you at such a time. It wasn’t me but an outsider.” Mo Yesi’s tone was a little sour. “Now, you’re full of gratitude towards that Tu brat. Hmph, he’s really smart. He chose to shield you at that time. Now, it’s a blessing in disguise.”

Qiao Mianmian said, “... What do you mean by a blessing in disguise? Mo Yesi, don’t think of him as such... He’s an artiste. If it wasn’t for his good luck this time, he would have scars on his hands. Scars have a huge impact on artistes.

“It’s only right that I’m grateful to him. If it wasn’t for him, the acid would have hit me.” Qiao Mianmian was a little unhappy with what he’d just said. She frowned and said, “Mo Yesi, he took a hit for me. I don’t expect you to be as grateful to him as I am, but can you not say that about him? He sacrificed a lot this time. You didn’t see how terrible the wound on his hand was.”

“I knew it would be like this.” Mo Yesi was silent for a few seconds, and his tone became even sourer. “He’s your benefactor now, no one can say anything about him. He saved you and took the brunt of the sulfuric acid for you. I’m grateful to him too. If it wasn’t for him, you’d be the one injured.”
