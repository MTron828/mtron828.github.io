Chapter 637: You Want to Investigate Her Biological Parents?

Why was this slut so lucky?

God was so biased towards her.

Sending so many outstanding men to her.

What about her?

She couldn’t even get Su Ze to stay!

She was filled with hatred and jealousy.

She wasn’t any worse than Qiao Mianmian.

Were these men blind? RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

All of them actually liked a woman whose parents were in the dark. No, Qiao Mianmian’s biological parents might have died long ago. She was just an orphan.

“I won’t let her succeed!”

Qiao Anxin suddenly turned around and looked at Lin Huizhen with hatred and jealousy. “Mom, do you think Qiao Mianmian’s biological parents escaped overseas because of something?

“What if they are criminals?”

She got excited at the thought of this possibility. “That’s right, her biological parents must be criminals. They committed serious crimes and escaped overseas. So, she’s the daughter of a criminal.

“If Young Master Gong and that man knew she was a criminal’s daughter, they wouldn’t have helped her.

“Who would like a criminal’s daughter?

“Mom, we have to get to the bottom of this.” Qiao Anxin grabbed Lin Huizhen’s arm as if she saw hope again. Her eyes flickered and she sneered. “If we find out that Qiao Mianmian’s biological parents are criminals who escaped, let’s see how she’s going to seduce them.

“When the time comes, I want everyone to know that she’s the criminal’s daughter!

“I want everyone to keep a distance from her.”

Lin Huizhen was stunned for a while before coming back to her senses. “Y-You’re going to investigate her biological parents?”

“That’s right.” Qiao Anxin clenched her fist. “Mom, think about it. What exactly did they do that they had to leave the country leaving their child behind? If they didn’t commit a major crime, they must have offended someone they shouldn’t have.

“No matter what it is, finding out about it would make Qiao Mianmian feel bad.”

Lin Huizhen’s eyes lit up. “You’re right. If her parents were really criminals, who would want her? This way, we can stop her from marrying into the Su family. Su Ze wouldn’t have broken up with you.”

“Hmph. Mom, you’re wrong.”

Qiao Anxin’s expression darkened. “I’m not doing this to stop her from marrying into the Su family.”

The Su family was nothing.

Qiao Anxin no longer liked them.

In the past, she felt that the Su family was very good, and Su Ze was also very outstanding.

But there was no harm in comparing.

How could Su Ze compare to Young Master Gong? Even a hundred Su Ze’s couldn’t compare to a single Gong Zeli.

Even Qiao Mianmian could seduce Young Master Gong.

She could do it too.

In the past, she’d been able to snatch Su Ze away from Qiao Mianmian. She didn’t believe that she couldn’t do it this time.

Lin Huizhen was stunned. “If you’re not trying to stop her from marrying into the Su family, then what are you doing it for? Anxin, you mustn’t let her marry into the Su family. Otherwise, both of us will be done for. Su Ze did let you down, but if you break up with him, you won’t be able to find such a good man in the future.”
