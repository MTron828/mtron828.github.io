Chapter 999: I Advise You to Be Smart

“I wonder what you want to talk to me about.”

“Ha.” Shen Rou looked at her mockingly. “Qiao Mianmian, why are you feigning ignorance? You know what I want to talk to you about. I don’t like to beat around the bush, so I’ll be frank.

“To tell you the truth, Aunt Mo came here today to persuade Ah Si to leave you. I believe you know very well that Aunt Mo doesn’t like you. You married into the Mo family behind her back. If Ah Si hadn’t secretly gotten a marriage certificate with you, you wouldn’t have been able to marry into the family.

“You should know this very well.”

Shen Rou despised Qiao Mianmian from the bottom of her heart.

In her eyes, Qiao Mianmian came from a humble background and wasn’t worthy of her attention.

If it wasn’t for Mo Yesi, someone like Qiao Mianmian wouldn’t even have the right to talk to her.

And from the moment she was born, she was a noble lady.

Hence, she always felt superior to Qiao Mianmian.

She always seemed high and mighty.

Even when she spoke, it was with an air of superiority.

“So.” Qiao Mianmian’s expression didn’t change at all. She smiled and said casually, “What exactly is Miss Shen trying to say?” Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Shen Rou sneered when she saw that Qiao Mianmian was still feigning ignorance. “Qiao Mianmian, I really don’t know what you’re thinking. You know that Aunt Mo doesn’t like you, and Ah Si married you only because you have a certain effect on his misogyny. Why are you still clinging to him shamelessly?

“Is it because you can’t bear to let go of your position as the Second Young Madam of the Mo family?

“But you have to be clear about one thing. Your position as the Second Young Madam of the Mo family isn’t secure just because you’re married to Ah Si. Aunt Mo is Ah Si’s biological mother, after all. Even if they have some friction, it’s only temporary. Ah Si treats you well now, but that’s because you’ve only been together for a while. He’s still fresh to you, and you’re still useful to him.

“Before that, he won’t consider divorcing you.

“But what about the future?” Shen Rou’s eyes were full of malice. “When you two are together for a long time, will he still find you fresh? When his illness is cured, will you still have any value to him?

“When that happens, he won’t hesitate to kick you out.”

“Oh, is that so?” Qiao Mianmian didn’t seem to take her words seriously. “I’m really curious about what Miss Shen wants to say to me.”

Shen Rou felt that Qiao Mianmian was feigning ignorance.

She knew what she was trying to say, but she pretended not to.

She clenched her teeth and said hatefully, “If you’re smart and leave him now, you’ll get a lot of compensation. Otherwise, when he gets tired of you, you might not get a single cent.

“Qiao Mianmian, I advise you to be smarter. The compensation you’ll receive now is enough to last you for the rest of your life. If you insist on staying in the Mo family, nothing good will come of it.”

Qiao Mianmian couldn’t help but laugh.
