They didn’t dare to say anything else.

Moreover, none of them were as stupid as Qiao Anxin.

She lost her audition slot.

She was really stupid. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“Since no one has any objections, we’ll stick to the original arrangement.” The employee turned to Qiao Mianmian and said politely, “Miss Qiao, sorry for the wait. Please follow me.”

Qiao Mianmian nodded and left with him.

Seeing this scene, the others couldn’t help but sigh. “This Qiao Mianmian has such a strong backing. Even Director Cheng’s assistant is so polite to her. I wonder what status her boyfriend has to have such an honor.”

“That man was Director Cheng’s assistant?!”

“Director Cheng is famous for being arrogant, and his assistant is also very cold. To be treated like this by his assistant, her boyfriend must be especially impressive.”

“Her boyfriend is so powerful. Even Young Master Yan calls him Boss. Although he hasn’t revealed his identity, think about it. To be able to play with Young Master Yan and Young Master Gong, their families must be equally matched.”

“Based on what you said, she might really be able to audition. Although Director Cheng hates people with connections the most, if her boyfriend is especially powerful, Director Cheng wouldn’t dare to slight her.”

As the discussion heated up, an official employee walked out and informed: “Miss Shen Fei, please enter for the audition.”

Shen Fei was one of the actors who came for the audition today.

She was around 30 years old this year. She wasn’t considered young anymore and had won two Best Actress awards.

Her acting was universally acknowledged.

When they informed Shen Fei to go in, the others were shocked. “They want to audition together?”

“Two people auditioning together? That newbie was the one who went in just now. Doesn’t that mean Shen Fei is auditioning with that newbie? Hahaha, Shen Fei has won the Best Actress award twice. In front of her, the newbie will be crushed.”

“I think Director Cheng did it on purpose. She came because of her connections, so Director Cheng couldn’t directly say no, so he arranged for her and Shen Fei to audition together. When the time comes, he has reason to say that he doesn’t want her anymore.”

“That might be the case.”

...

At the audition hall.

When Qiao Mianmian found out that she was going to audition with another person, she started guessing who it was.

Qiao Mianmian was shocked to see Shen Fei.

She knew her.

Shen Fei was a true powerhouse.

Qiao Mianmian had watched many of her shows and was impressed by her acting.

She knew that most of the people here today were capable.

But she hadn’t expected Shen Fei to audition with her.

At the judges’ table were the producer, director, and scriptwriter.

Seeing Shen Fei enter, the director greeted her. “I arranged for a newbie to audition with you. Do you have any objections?”

Shen Fei smiled. “Director Cheng, what can I say? You should ask the young lady.”

Shen Fei looked very approachable. Just like what the online news said, she was a big shot.

“Hello, I’m Shen Fei.” Shen Fei walked toward Qiao Mianmian and extended her hand.

Qiao Mianmian quickly shook her hand. “Hello, Senior Shen. I’m Qiao Mianmian.”
