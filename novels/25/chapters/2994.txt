Anyway, ever since she married Mo Yesi, her shopping hobby was basically canceled.

She had everything she wanted at home and many more.

She didn’t have any desire to shop anymore.

“Then, what do I have to do so that my baby won’t cry?” Mo Yesi seemed confused. He frowned slightly and then smiled. “I’ve thought of something. I’ll tell you something

that will make you happy immediately. Do you want to know?”

Qiao Mianmian nodded immediately. “What is it?”

“It’s about your brother.” The man’s well-defined fingers landed on the little woman’s porcelain face. He gently wiped away a tear from the corner of her eye and smiled.

“This time, you might really have a sister-in-law.”

Qiao Mianmian jumped out of his arms. “My brother has a girlfriend?”

He hasn’t officially confirmed their relationship, but it should be soon.”

How did you know? Why didn’t he tell me?”

“Shaogqing saw him being intimate with a woman. Oh right, you know that woman too.”

“I know her?” Qiao Mianmian was stunned again and quickly guessed who it was. She was a little excited. “Is it the young lady I saw at the auction that night?”

“Mm.” Mo Yesi nodded. “It’s her.”

“How do you know that Brother is going to be with her soon? Shaoqing saw it too?”

“Shaogqing accidentally bumped into them and asked him privately. He said it himself.”

As expected, Qiao Mianmian was happy and immediately threw the teen romance film aside. “Then, it’s true. I knew that Brother and that lady had an extraordinary

relationship. I didn’t expect them to really get together.

“That’s great. If Mom finds out about this, she’ll be so happy. She’s been worried about Brother’s marriage for so long. This won’t do. When I get off the plane, I’ll call him and

ask him.”

“You’re happy now?” Mo Yesi pinched her cheek. “You’re not sad anymore?”

Qiao Mianmian smiled. “Mm, I’m not sad anymore.”

Mo Yesi patted her head and turned off the TV. He covered her head with a small blanket and pressed her against his chest. “I won’t watch a movie that affects my mood.

We still have five hours before we arrive in Country M. We might as well have a good sleep.

“Didn’t you say you were going to eat local delicacies? If you don’t rest well, you’ll only want to sleep in the hotel when you get off the plane.”

Qiao Mianmian placed her face on his warm chest and wrapped her arms around his waist. She thought for a while and nodded.

Mo Yesi stroked her head again and hugged her like a bear. His low and magnetic voice was filled with gentleness and affection. He lowered his head and kissed her between

her brows. “Then sleep.”

Five hours later, the plane arrived in Country M.

As Qiao Mianmian had slept for a few hours, she was full of energy after getting off the plane. She didn’t look tired at all from the long flight.

The temperature was a little low outside.

Mo Yesi took out the thin jacket he had prepared for her.

“Wear this jacket, don’t catch a cold.”.Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎
