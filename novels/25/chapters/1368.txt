Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Was it you who did that to Anxin’s Weibo? She doesn’t want to live anymore, do you know that?

“If anything happens to Anxin, I’ll never let you off!”

Qiao Mianmian kept quiet for a while as she listened to Lin Huizhen’s angry voice. “Aunt Lin, what are you talking about? I don’t understand. What has Qiao Anxin’s death got to do with me? How did it become me trying to force her to death?”

“Qiao Mianmian, Anxin is in the hospital! She’s still unconscious!” Lin Huizhen said angrily. “It’s all because of you. If anything happens to Anxin, I won’t let you off.”

“Are you done?” Qiao Mianmian’s voice was emotionless.

“Qiao Mianmian, I want you to clarify immediately that you and Su Ze have broken up a long time ago. Anxin has never gotten involved with the two of you. Let’s not talk about anything else, but on account of the Qiao family’s gratitude for raising you, you can’t treat Anxin like this.

“She’s the only flesh and blood of the Qiao family. If something happens to her because of you, would you be worthy of the Qiao family’s years of kindness? Because of you, she and Su Ze have already broken up, and her child is gone. Do you still want to ruin her career and leave her with nothing?

“Are you really going to force her to death?

“As long as you make a statement to prove that she didn’t cheat on you, we’ll let bygones be bygones.”

Qiao Mianmian found it funny. “Aunt Lin, the Qiao family has done me a favor, but this has nothing to do with you. Qiao Anxin only has herself to blame for what happened to her. It’s not that I want her to have nothing, it’s you and your daughter who want me to have nothing. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“It’s just that your wishful thinking has failed.

“Whether she wants to die or live has nothing to do with me. You don’t have to call me anymore. I won’t answer your call.”

With that, Qiao Mianmian hung up without waiting for Lin Huizhen’s reply.

She then blacklisted Lin Huizhen’s number.

Qiao Anxin must have really been hospitalized.

But even if Qiao Anxin really wanted to die, it had nothing to do with her.

...

In the hospital.

Lin Huizhen’s expression darkened.

She immediately called again and realized that Qiao Mianmian had blacklisted her.

“Little slut!”

She almost smashed her cell phone.

The door was pushed open.

Qiao Ruhai walked in anxiously and saw Qiao Anxin lying on the bed with her eyes closed. He quickly walked to Lin Huizhen and asked worriedly, “What’s wrong with Anxin? Is she still unconscious?”

Lin Huizhen looked up at him with tears in her eyes.

Her tears fell.

Qiao Ruhai’s heart sank.

He asked anxiously, “What happened to Anxin? What did the doctor say?”

“Old Qiao, your daughter is being bullied. Our family raised an ingrate. She wants Anxin dead!”

Qiao Ruhai was stunned. “Anxin was bullied? Who bullied her?”

“It’s all because of that ingrate you raised. Now that she’s found her biological parents and has a better backing, she’s starting to trample on the Qiao family. All these years, you’ve treated her like your own daughter. Even Anxin’s treatment here has to be pushed aside.

“But what about her? How did she repay you? Your only biological daughter has been bullied by her until she’s unconscious and hospitalized. She even wants to die. I called her and begged her to let Anxin off. She even said that it’s best if Anxin dies. She can’t wait for Anxin to die.”
