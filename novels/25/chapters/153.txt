Chapter 156: You Rebellious Girl!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“It looks like my existence is really a mistake. I shouldn’t have returned and disturbed your happy family of three.”

“Qiao Mianmian!” Qiao Ruhai frowned. “What nonsense are you talking about!” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Qiao Mianmian smirked again, even more mockingly this time. “Am I wrong? The moment I came back, the family fell into a great commotion. I really shouldn’t have come back. But do you think I came back willingly because I liked it?”

While talking, her voice gradually chilled and her eyes also deepened. She glanced coldly at Qiao Anxin. “If it weren’t for someone eying Mom’s room, I’m really not interested in coming back to this home.

“Dad, I don’t care what you promised them. I’ll never allow Qiao Anxin to move in!

“Mom’s room must be left as it is, and no one is allowed to move in. You promised her yourself! Are you going back on your words now?”

Qiao Ruhai’s expression changed instantly and he looked even worse.

Pursing his lips tightly, he was silent for a few seconds before saying angrily, “This is a special case for Anxin! She’ll live here for a year, and once her child is born, she’ll move back. Your mom was an understanding woman in her time. If she was still here, she would certainly understand my approach. You, on the other hand, Mianmian, when did you become so aggressive? Anxin isn’t an outsider, she’s your own sister!”

“Oh.” Qiao Mianmian laughed in ridicule. “No matter how empathetic my mom is, she might not want to vacate her room for a mistress. As for her being my sister...”

She glanced coldly at Qiao Anxin and said word by word while sneering coldly, “I don’t have such a younger sister who ruined her own sister’s relationship.”

Slap—

As soon as Qiao Mianmian finished speaking, she was slapped in the face.

This slap was so powerful that her face directly swayed to the side.

A bloody smell permeated between her lips and teeth.

Her ears buzzed at the impact and she experienced a short period of tinnitus. Five bright red fingerprint marks appeared quickly on her face.

Her fair cheeks swelled instantly.

Qiao Ruhai was still furious. He pointed at her nose and scolded viciously. “You rebellious girl! Aunt Lin is your senior, your stepmother, how could you say such disgraceful words! How did I raise such a heartless daughter!”

Lin Huizhen and Qiao Anxin were stunned for a few seconds.

Neither of them thought that Father Qiao would actually hit her.

After all, he was still very affectionate towards Qiao Mianmian and had never once beaten her.

This was probably the first time he hit her.

But after recovering from the shock, Qiao Anxin’s face lit up with a delighted smile.

Watching Qiao Mianmian get hit was to her heart’s content.

Qiao Ruhai’s slap stunned Qiao Mianmian.

She took a few seconds to return to her senses.

Her ears were still buzzing and her sight was spinning. She covered her half-swollen face and slowly turned around.

At first, she felt hurt and disbelief. But after a while, it all turned to ice-cold sarcasm and indifference.

Father Qiao felt regretful for a few seconds after the slap.

He had lost his reason at that moment.

But after the slap, his mind became much clearer.

He had never once hit Qiao Mianmian.

But now that he had Lin Huizhen and her daughter, his love for his daughter was much less than before. However, the affection between father and daughter couldn’t be neglected so easily.
