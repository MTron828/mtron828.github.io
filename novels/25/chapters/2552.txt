Father Shen was shocked. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

At this moment, he felt that his daughter was so foreign.

She wasn’t the obedient and filial daughter he remembered.

She was so domineering that it was scary.

“Rourou, w-why are you talking to your dad and me like this?” Madam Shen was stunned for a while. Her face was pale as she asked angrily.

Shen Rou looked at her coldly without any respect. She didn’t look at Madam Shen like she was her mother.

Madam Shen felt a chill down her spine.

She really felt like this daughter was a different person.

She was so foreign and scary.

At this moment, someone’s cell phone rang.

It was Shen Rou’s cell phone.

She picked it up and frowned when she saw the caller ID. She picked it up after a while.

Not long after picking up the call, Shen Rou’s expression turned awful.

She gripped her cell phone tightly, her expression as dark as a storm. She suppressed her anger and growled. “What did you say? Everything was fine, why did she leave? Didn’t you think of a way to make her stay?

“Damn it, go to the airport and stop her. I’ll rush over immediately. No matter what, we can’t let her go.

“If she leaves, you don’t have to stay in the company anymore.”

After a while, Shen Rou hung up.

She had just received a call from her assistant.

He said that Henry Zhou’s assistant suddenly decided to leave. No matter how they tried to get her to stay, she insisted on returning to M Nation.

The assistant had no choice but to call Shen Rou.

Shen Rou was in a terrible mood.

She regretted being on such bad terms with Tang Ya.

How could she have forgotten?

Henry Zhou was hired with Tang Ya’s help.

Since she had fallen out with Tang Ya, she wouldn’t help her anymore.

Hence, Henry Zhou’s assistant leaving must have something to do with Tang Ya.

Although she wasn’t surprised that Tang Ya would do this, she couldn’t mess this up.

Henry Zhou was the Shen Corporation’s trump card.

If used well, the Shen Corporation would be able to recover from its current disadvantage.

They had already lost a few businesses.

Their stock price was also affected again.

The only way to salvage the situation now was for Henry Zhou to design a new batch of jewelry.

“Rourou, did something happen at the company?” Father Shen looked at her expression and asked worriedly.

He wasn’t going to ask about the company anymore.

When he decided to hand the Shen Corporation over to his daughter, he was a little worried that she wouldn’t be able to manage the company.

Unexpectedly, Shen Rou’s performance was much better than he imagined.

She managed the company well and signed a few good deals in a short period of time.

After that, Father Shen felt relieved.

But now that something like this happened, Father Shen couldn’t possibly remain unworried.

“Mm, there’s something. I have to go out immediately.” Shen Rou frowned and walked out quickly.

Soon, she disappeared from the hall.

Madam Shen looked in the direction she left for a while. When she couldn’t see anyone, she slowly retracted her gaze.

“I wonder what happened.”
