Chapter 21: Our Young Master Has “Anti-Women Disorder”

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Qiao Mianmian gently nodded at him.

She wasn’t used to the term “Young Madam” yet, and it felt a little odd to be addressed this way.

The chauffeur opened the door to the backseat and only got into the driver’s seat after she’d boarded.

Qiao Mianmian realized that Mo Yesi wasn’t in the car.

She casually asked, “Is your Young Master busy?”

The chauffeur replied, “Someone looked for Young Master to discuss some matters, so he got me to pick you up first.”

“Oh.”

On the way.

Qiao Mianmian felt that the chauffeur was stealing glances at her. She hadn’t noticed it initially, but the more he did it, the more disturbed she felt.

At a red light, she noticed that the driver was catching a glance at her again. She couldn’t help but ask, “Well... you keep looking at me, is there something wrong?”

“Ah?” The chauffeur was a little stunned by her question. He tensely responded, “Young Madam, please don’t get it wrong. I don’t mean anything. I’m just curious...” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“Curious?” Qiao Mianmian was confused.

What was he curious about?

“Yes, c-curious.” The chauffeur looked at her in the rearview mirror again before going on. “Before Young Madam appeared, Young Master has never had a woman with him. He hasn’t even been in a relationship before. Madam introduced many wealthy beauties and belles to him, but none caught his eye. Madam and Old Master are getting so anxious over it.”

Qiao Mianmian was surprised. “Are you serious? He’s never been in a relationship?”

For someone of such caliber, he should’ve been an ideal target since he was young.

How could he not have been in a relationship before?

The chauffeur sighed. “Young Madam, you probably don’t know this, but our Young Master has ‘Anti-Women Disorder’.”

“Anti-Women Disorder?!” Qiao Mianmian was stunned.

What sort of disorder was this?

The chauffeur explained, “He detests women and is unwilling to be in contact with them. Besides Madam and Old Madam, Young Master has stayed away from all other women. That was why he remained single despite being so outstanding.

“Young Master’s disorder is very rare, and all the doctors he’s been to were unable to treat him. Hence, I was very shocked when I found out that you and the Young Master got married.”

Qiao Mianmian was shocked. She took a while to process the information before asking, “Then what happens if he’s in physical contact with women?”

The driver’s expression darkened as he uttered each word solemnly, “Young Master would develop an allergy. If it’s mild, he’ll develop rashes. If it’s serious, he’ll get dizzy spells, start shivering and even puke.”

Qiao Mianmian was shaken.

What??

What sort of strange disease was this?

B-But this couldn’t be right!

He’d voluntarily held her before, and nothing happened to him.

As if reading her mind, the chauffeur said, “Young Master doesn’t seem to be allergic to you.”

That was probably why Young Master decided to get married so soon.

Moreover, this Young Madam was rather pretty. He found her likable too.

But...

Madam and Old Master likely hadn’t found out about the marriage yet, and Madam had been trying to bring Young Master and Miss Shen Rou together.

Who knew how they’d react if they found out.

The chauffeur drove to a shopping mall.

After getting off, he said to Qiao Mianmian, “Young Master said to let Young Madam shop around in the mall first. This mall is owned by their family, you can just take with you anything you lay your eyes on.”
