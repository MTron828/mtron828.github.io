Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Tell us the price of the wedding dress. Let us peasants broaden our horizons.”

A few minutes later, Sheng Sheng replied to one of the netizens who asked about the price of the wedding dress.

Sheng Sheng didn’t mind: “The wedding dress cost more than 50 million yuan, and the diamond tiara cost close to 100 million yuan. Moreover, this is only the wedding dress’ price. I heard that the jewelry she’s wearing on her wedding day was personally designed by Mo Yesi. This jewelry set is much more

valuable than the wedding dress. However, these are only the wearing dress and the jewelry. The other expenses of the wedding haven’t been counted. I reckon that for this wedding, it will cost more than one billion yuan.”

This reply made the girls shed tears of envy.

“Tm so jealous of her. I can’t even imagine myself being treated this way.”

“Spending a billion yuan just for a wedding? The world of the rich is indeed unimaginable to us poor people. I won’t be able to earn this amount in ten lifetimes, no... tens of lifetimes. But this is just the cost of a wedding.”

“Tm curious about what a wedding that costs more than a billion yuan looks like. I remember that Bai Wei’s wedding cost about 100 million yuan back then. Then, the various media outlets rushed to report that her wedding cost a huge sum of money. If 100 million yuan is enough to make people think it’s

an astronomical sum, then what kind of wedding is this?”

“Previously, someone said that Qiao Mianmian wasn’t liked by the elders of the Mo family, so they never allowed her to have a wedding with Mo Yesi. If this news is true... are those who said that Qiao Mianmian isn’t valued badly slapped?”

“My Prince Charming and my goddess are finally having a wedding. Congratulations, it’s a blissful marriage.”

There were many blessings.

There were also many envious comments.

But amidst the blessings and envy, there were always a few discordant voices that wanted to ruin the atmosphere.

“What’s so good about spending a few billion yuan on a wedding? It’d be more admirable if this money was donated to the children in the mountains. There are so many children in the mountains who can’t afford to eat or study, but someone can spend a few billion yuan on a wedding. I really don’t

understand this world.”

“I suggest we find out the source of the money.”

“I find it ironic when I think of those homeless people who don’t have enough to eat, wear warm clothes, or even starve to death on the streets. Most of the rich people in this world are heartless. There aren’t many with a conscience.”

Such comments were mixed in the originally harmonious comments section.

Some netizens couldn’t take it anymore and started insulting them.

“Thate moral coercion the most. You think the children in the mountains and the homeless are pitiful. Donate more yourself. As long as their money isn’t stolen or earned illegally, they can spend it however they want. It’s none of your business.”

“I’s here, people with the moral high ground.”

“What do you mean by finding out the source of the money? Are you trying to be funny? Do you know who Mo Yesi is? Do you know how much the Mo Corporation earns every year? You don’t know anything, but you’re trying to defame him.”
