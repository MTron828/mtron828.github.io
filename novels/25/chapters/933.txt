Chapter 934: This Is My Boyfriend, His Surname Is Mo

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Tu Yilei, Tu Yilei, why didn’t you consider it properly before doing it? Why were you so impulsive? You’ve created such a terrible situation now, how am I going to clean up your mess?

“Forget it, you still have money to pay for it. At most, we’ll just treat it as a waste of time. But do you know what your current silence means? Even if you remain silent for a month, people will forget about you very soon, much less a year or so.

“In a year’s time, you’ll have nothing to eat.

“I think Qiao Mianmian is your nemesis. You’ve been so lucky in the past few years to have met such an unlucky woman. You should stay away from her.

“She’s good. She was the one Huang Yilin went after, but she’s fine now. You’ve suffered so much because of her, but she’s not even that grateful. Hmph, you can only be touched by yourself. Do you think she’ll remember your kindness?”

“Michael!” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Did I say anything wrong? You’re a fool! What can you get in return for your wishful thinking? I don’t think you can do anything.

“You ruined your career and future for a woman. All my hard work to get you to where you are now has been in vain! If I’d known that you didn’t cherish what you have now, I wouldn’t have wasted so much time and effort on you.

“You’re really infuriating!”

Outside the ward.

Mo Yesi’s expression darkened as he listened to their conversation.

He held Qiao Mianmian’s waist and pushed the door open.

In the room.

The two of them were stunned.

Michael turned around and was about to ask who was so rude to enter without knocking. But when he saw Mo Yesi entering expressionlessly, he swallowed his words.

His anger turned to shock.

He’d only seen Mo Yesi once.

That time at the hotel.

But he had a deep impression of him.

The moment his gaze landed on Mo Yesi’s face, he immediately recognized him.

It was impossible to forget a man’s unique aura.

When he saw Qiao Mianmian enter with Mo Yesi, his expression stiffened again. He thought about how they might have heard what he said just now, and his expression changed several times in a short period of time.

On the hospital bed.

Tu Yilei’s expression stiffened when he saw the two of them entering hand in hand. But very quickly, his expression returned to normal.

“Good morning, Miss Qiao.” He greeted her politely as if it was his first time meeting Mo Yesi. “How should I address this gentleman beside you?”

“Senior Tu, good morning.” Qiao Mianmian thought for a while and then introduced Mo Yesi with a smile. “This is my boyfriend, his surname is Mo. Knowing that Senior Tu was injured because of me, he said he must come with me to thank you in person.”

“Mo?”

Tu Yilei’s expression changed when he saw Mo Yesi’s handsome face and natural air of nobility.

He was shocked by the possibility.

When he looked up at Mo Yesi again, his eyes were full of curiosity. He asked tentatively, “I wonder if Mr. Mo is related to the Mo Corporation?”
