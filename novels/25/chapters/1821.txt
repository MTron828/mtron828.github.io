Chapter 1824: Everything Seems to Have Returned to Its Starting Point

Qiao Anxin saw it, too.

Her expression turned ugly. “It looks like everyone likes Qiao Mianmian.”

All the boys in the team seemed to like her.

Even Han Yan, who was in the same group as them, had “betrayed” them.

Qiao Anxin hated this feeling.

Just like when she was young, whenever Qiao Mianmian was around, her limelight would be stolen.

And the person in the limelight would always be Qiao Mianmian.

As long as Qiao Mianmian was around, everyone’s attention would be on her, and she would be completely ignored.

The sentence she had heard the most was: Mianmian is so pretty, prettier than Anxin.

And the biggest blow she had suffered was that the people she liked all liked Qiao Mianmian.

At that time, she secretly swore that she would surpass Qiao Mianmian one day.

She wanted everything Qiao Mianmian owned.

Later, she really did it.

She snatched Su Ze from her.

She stole a lot of resources that should have belonged to Qiao Mianmian.

She had already won against her.

But now...

Everything seemed to have returned to the beginning, back to the time when Qiao Mianmian had crushed her in every aspect.

She hated this feeling.

“That’s because she has her ways,” Song Ke said angrily. “A bunch of men like fools, being fooled by her. That idiot Han Yan was bribed with a meal.”

“No matter what methods she uses, it’s all because of her ability,” Little Xiao said lightly. “Other than the few of us, everyone else is on her side now. She really knows how to get on people’s good side. I saw Zhan Bo send a bowl of rice to Sister Fei just now. It must be Qiao Mianmian’s idea.

“Sister Fei must be very grateful for that.”

When Song Ke heard that, she gritted her teeth and whispered, “Hmph, a scheming b*tch. She’s like a bootlicker. All she knows is to curry Sister Fei’s favor.”

“Of course, she has to curry favor with Sister Fei.” Little Xiao said faintly, “In our group, only Sister Fei is the most useful to her. She’s smart. She knows that if she builds a good relationship with Sister Fei, she won’t have to worry about resources in the future.”

Qiao Anxin listened to their conversation and didn’t think much of it. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

If it was in the past, she would have thought the same.

But now, Qiao Mianmian didn’t need to suck up to Shen Fei for resources.

Mo Yesi was her boyfriend and Bai Yusheng was her brother. She was also the daughter of the Bai family.

She could easily get whatever resources she wanted.

However, Qiao Anxin didn’t say anything.

Because she knew that if Song Ke and the rest found out about Qiao Mianmian’s background, they would side with her.

...

The first day’s recording was relatively simple. The afternoon’s task was about the same as the morning. They also helped the villagers pick vegetables and fruits to sell in town.

The task in the afternoon was much simpler. Shen Fei’s team also successfully completed it.

After the results were out, Qiao Mianmian’s team obviously won.

The production team was very generous to the winner. Not only did they reward Qiao Mianmian and the rest with hotpot, but they also gave them a 50 yuan bonus.

It wasn’t a lot of money, but to their currently poor selves, it was enough for a day’s worth of food.

Shen Fei’s team lost and was punished.

Their punishment was to go to the mountains to harvest some pigweed[1] to feed the pigs.

[1] any weedy plants which may be used as pig fodder.
