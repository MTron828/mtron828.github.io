Chapter 1026: She Didn’t Even Have the Desire to Talk Anymore

Jiang Luoli knew what he meant.

He was talking to her about dating again.

Mo Shixiu was undeniably a charming man.

And he especially tempted her.

It was really, really hard to reject a man like him.

But at this moment, Jiang Luoli’s mind was clear and rational. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

She knew that no matter how attractive he was, she couldn’t accept him.

In front of her was a trap full of tempting candy.

It was both tempting and dangerous.

If she accidentally fell in, she wouldn’t be able to get out.

Jiang Luoli took a deep breath and asked calmly, “Mr. Mo, when will you be back?”

“I’m already in the car. Miss Jiang, do you want to see me sooner?” The man sounded serious.

Jiang Luoli was speechless.

Was Mo Shixiu... flirting with her?

Or was he just saying that she was overthinking?

Thinking about his personality, Jiang Luoli felt that she was overthinking.

How could a man like him flirt with women?

If Mo Shixiu knew how to flirt with women, he wouldn’t be single now.

He’d already be married.

The only reason he was still single was that he was too mature and didn’t attract women.

And he was very straight.

From the moment he invited her to look at the stars on the mountain to setting up a pink room for her, all of these actions were done by a very straight man.

How many women would like a straight man?

“When will Mr. Mo be home?” Jiang Luoli ignored his question.

“If Miss Jiang is in a hurry, I’ll get the chauffeur to drive faster. We’ll be there in about 40 minutes.”

Jiang Luoli said, “... I’m not in a hurry.”

The man didn’t seem to have heard her. He chuckled and said, “Miss Jiang, if you’re bored, you can go to my study room to read and pass the time. Or you can go to the gym to exercise. The last time I saw you, I felt that your constitution wasn’t very good. Exercising frequently can improve your constitution and improve your mental health.”

Jiang Luoli was speechless.

She didn’t even have the desire to talk anymore.

Mo Shixiu was really a straight man!

He actually wanted her to read books and exercise to pass the time?

How did this man think?

Was he serious?

And he even said that her constitution wasn’t good.

She dared to say that with his personality, if he didn’t have a good background and good looks, no one would be able to match up to him in the blind date market.

He was definitely the sort of man who wouldn’t say anything after he was done with her.

“Miss Jiang, you should eat more. I know that you girls like to look slim, but it’s not good for your health. No matter what, you should put health first.

“But it’s alright. I’ll get the nutritionist to help you recuperate if Miss Jiang stays here.”

Jiang Luoli was speechless.

How was she skinny?

She had the most perfect and healthy figure.

Although she was skinny, she didn’t look shriveled at all. She was filled in the right places.

Her figure had been praised and envied by many.

So far.

Only Mo Shixiu, a straight man, despised her figure.
