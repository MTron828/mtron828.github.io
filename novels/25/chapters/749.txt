Chapter 751: I’m Yours, What Is It That You Can’t Touch?

But just because she didn’t think much of it didn’t mean that others thought the same.

This was a direct insult to her. If she didn’t reciprocate, she’d think she was easy to bully.

Especially since it was Shen Rou who provoked her.

Qiao Mianmian had tolerated her for a long time.

“Alright.” Shen Rou sneered. “Prove it to me. Don’t delete your call history.”

“Of course not.” Qiao Mianmian glanced into the bathroom and smiled. “My husband is coming out soon. I’ll ask him if I can answer his call.”

The bathroom door opened with a click.

After a cold shower, the man walked out of the bathroom with a towel wrapped around him.

His wet hair was still dripping.

The beads of water rolled down his face and onto his sexy lips.

The towel only covered his lower body.

The exposed upper body, chest muscles, and abdominal muscles were even more attractive.

There were still water droplets on his body. As he walked, the water droplets rolled down his chest and into his abs.

Qiao Mianmian looked at the captivating “picture of a handsome man” and swallowed her saliva.

Although she’d just had a “deep” experience of how wonderful this man’s body was, she was still tempted every time she saw it.

Mo Yesi... had such a good figure.

She was tempted every time she saw it.

“Baby?”

Mo Yesi was stunned to see her standing at the door. He quickly walked to her and held her in his arms. “Why are you still standing here? Didn’t you say you were tired?”

“Oh.”

Qiao Mianmian snapped out of her daze and waved her cell phone at him. “When you were showering just now, Miss Shen called you and I picked it up for you. Oh right, I haven’t hung up yet. I’ll give it to you?”

“Shen Rou called?” Mo Yesi looked at his cell phone screen and saw that the call was still ongoing.

“Mm.” Qiao Mianmian nodded and handed it to him. “I picked up Miss Shen’s call without your permission. You don’t mind, right?”

Mo Yesi took the phone and frowned when he saw that the call hadn’t ended. “Why would I mind?”

“Really? You don’t mind?” Qiao Mianmian smiled and raised her voice. “But Miss Shen said that you hate it when people touch your things without permission. She said you’d definitely be angry. So I was waiting outside just now, afraid that you’d be angry.”

Mo Yesi looked down at her and quickly understood that she was talking to Shen Rou. He raised his voice and said gently, “You’re my wife. Don’t talk about my things. I’m yours, what is it that you can’t touch?”

Qiao Mianmian was very satisfied with his cooperation and performance.

Hence, she didn’t mind rewarding him.

She tiptoed and kissed him lightly on the lips. She blinked and looked at the screen. “Hubby, when did you become so sweet?”

Mo Yesi’s Adam’s apple bobbed when he heard her say that. He tightened his grip on her shoulders. “Mm? You don’t like it?”
