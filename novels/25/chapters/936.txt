Many people in the industry had to address him as Brother.

Many people respected and feared him. They felt that he wasn’t someone to be trifled with.

But such a person actually felt a little afraid when Mo Yesi glanced at him.

He didn’t dare to look into his eyes for too long.

“No, that’s right.” Michael could tell that Mo Yesi was trying to make up for Tu Yilei’s loss. Even though he was a little afraid of him, he still mustered up the courage to say, “Our Little Tu Tu was injured because he wanted to save Mr. Mo’s girlfriend. He’s an artiste, so he has to show his hand in many of the commercials he signed. But now that he’s injured, this is...”

“You’re Tu Yilei’s manager?” Mo Yesi cut him off impatiently. “I don’t care about what you’re saying. Tell me directly, how much did he lose?”

“W-Why is your attitude like this?” Michael felt that Mo Yesi’s attitude was extremely bad and was a little angered, but he didn’t dare to flare up at him. He didn’t even dare to look down and said weakly, “Our Little Tu is your girlfriend’s benefactor. H-How could you say that?”

“Even if- even if you’re a member of the Mo family, you can’t be like this. If it wasn’t for our Little Tu, this girl’s pretty face might have been ruined. Do you think you can just give him money?”

“Michael.” Tu Yilei’s expression darkened. “I’ve said it before, you don’t have to bother about me. If you continue like this, get out.”

“Little Tu Tu, do you still have a conscience?” Michael was so angry that his face turned green. “I’m doing this for your own good. Look at his attitude, he makes it sound like he’s doing you a favor. But if you weren’t trying to help Qiao Mianmian, would you be as unlucky as you are now?

“I’ve said it before, people might not be grateful for your wishful thinking. Do you see it now?”

“Michael!”

“I’m speaking the truth. Am I wrong?” Michael pointed at Mo Yesi and said angrily, “Mr. Mo, you said you want to compensate him, but so what if you do? Because of the injury on his hand, our Little Tu not only has to terminate many of his contracts, but he probably won’t be able to take on any jobs for the next year. Money is a small matter. If he disappears for a year, even if he returns in the future, do you think he can still be as popular as he is now?

“He’s the most popular artiste in the industry now. If he leaves the public eye at this time, do you think the impact this will have on him is just money? Do you think we lack that money?”

The more Michael spoke, the angrier he got. “Mr. Mo, do you think you can compensate for this?”

Qiao Mianmian felt bad about Tu Yilei.

The guilt deepened after hearing what Michael said.

She said apologetically, “Mr. Michael, I’m sorry. I know this will definitely have a huge impact on Senior Tu, but my boyfriend will do his best to make it up to you. Please trust him, alright? He’ll really do his best to make it up to you.”

“Ha, Miss Qiao, I know that your boyfriend is a member of the Mo family and is very capable. But even the members of the Mo family are divided into different levels. Some things can’t be made up for just because he wants to.”

Michael glanced at Mo Yesi and snorted.
