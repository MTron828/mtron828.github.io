He was envious of a girl who could make him put on the leather rope.

Qiao Mianmian couldn’t help but smile.

Mo Yesi didn’t queue for too long.

After he went over, he found someone and said a few words to him, and that person gave up his spot.

A few minutes later, he returned with the ice cream.

“You ate spicy food just now. You can’t eat too much ice, or you’ll get diarrhea.” Mo Yesi handed her the half-filled box of ice cream. “I got the employee to add another mango. After this, you’re not allowed to eat anything else.”

Qiao Mianmian took the ice cream from him, scooped a spoonful, and fed it to him.

The sweet fragrance of the ice cream caused the man to frown. He looked down at the girl’s expectant expression and swallowed the words “I don’t like this.”

He opened his mouth cooperatively.

Mo Yesi didn’t like to eat anything too sweet. The moment the ice cream entered his mouth, he was so sick of it that he wanted to spit it out.

But he forced himself to swallow it.

Qiao Mianmian blinked. “Is it good?”

“Mm, not bad.” Mo Yesi swallowed the ice cream in his mouth and said something against his conscience.

“How much did you spend on this box of ice cream?” Qiao Mianmian waved the ice cream in her hand and asked.

He would have to queue for at least half an hour.

If that person was willing to let him cut the queue, he must have given him something.

Anyway, there was nothing that money couldn’t solve with Mo Yesi.

Qiao Mianmian felt that her ice cream must be several times more expensive. No, it might be tens or even hundreds of times more expensive.

Anyway, according to Mo Yesi’s style of spending money to solve problems, it didn’t matter how much money he spent.

“It’s not much, eat it quickly. It’ll melt in a while.” Mo Yesi reached out and took a leaf off Qiao Mianmian’s head. He then rubbed her head and turned her around. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Not far away.

The girls who asked Mo Yesi for his contact details were taking photos of them.

They looked envious.

After Qiao Mianmian and Mo Yesi left, they uploaded the photos onto Weibo.

Little Bottle Cap: “I met a super handsome little brother at a dessert shop today. He’s even more handsome than a celebrity! I plucked up my courage to ask for Little Brother’s contact details, but he didn’t say a word and just rolled up his sleeves to show us the small rubber band on his hand. It turns out that Little Brother has a little ancestor. (Heartbroken) And he dotes on his girlfriend so much, queuing up to buy ice cream for her on such a hot day. Little Brother looks at his girlfriend so lovingly. I’m so envious.”

The girl photoshopped the photo of Mo Yesi picking leaves for Qiao Mianmian and feeding her ice cream.

Mo Yesi’s profile was in both of the photos she sent.

Not long after the Weibo post was posted, it was reposted by a marketing account.

The marketing account had millions of fans.

As soon as the marketing account reposted it, other marketing accounts reposted it as well. In less than half an hour, the Weibo reposts from Little Bottle Cap reached more than 5,000.

The number of reposts and comments continued to increase.
