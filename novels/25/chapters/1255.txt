Chapter 1257: Her Words and Actions Are Really Hard to Like

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“What if...”

“Mm?”

“What do you think?”

Qiao Mianmian was stunned.

She had never thought of such a possibility.

Even though the Qiao family already had a child of the Mo family, she never thought that she also wasn’t from the Qiao family.

“Forget it, you’d better not think about it.” Mo Yesi looked at her stunned expression and rubbed her head. “Anyway, whether you’re from the Qiao family or the Bai family, you’re already mine.

“Be it the daughter of the Bai family or the daughter of the Qiao family, you’re my treasure.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

Without warning, she was aroused again.

Mo Yesi was too good at flirting and sweet-talking.

...

Later.

Mo Yesi got off work early and followed Qiao Mianmian to buy some gifts before driving to the Bai family.

40 minutes later, at the Bai Residence.

The butler came out to pick them up. As he welcomed them in respectfully, he said, “Madam said that she will personally prepare a few dishes tonight. She’s still in the kitchen now, so she arranged for me to pick Mr. Mo and Miss Qiao up.”

Mo Yesi handed him the gift. “Madam Bai is too polite. Why is she cooking personally?”

The butler immediately took the gift and hesitated for a while before saying with a smile, “Mr. Mo and Miss Qiao are the polite ones. It’s just a meal, there’s no need to prepare a gift. Madam rarely cooks, and she’s happy today.”

“Miss Qiao and Mr. Mo don’t know yet, right? Our Madam has finally found her daughter after more than 10 years.”

The butler didn’t look too happy.

It was as if it was a normal message.

The butler had been in the Bai family for decades and had long treated it as his home.

He should be happy that Miss, who they had been searching for more than 10 years, had finally reunited with Madam and the rest.

But...

The butler frowned at the thought of the newly acknowledged Miss.

It had only been half a day, but he already felt that the Miss he just acknowledged wasn’t easy to get along with.

Her temper wasn’t good.

She’d just acknowledged the Bai family and was already putting on airs as a rich missy.

She ordered her subordinates to do this and that.

Although she was the daughter of the Bai family and had the right to do that.

But even Madam and Young Master had never used such disrespectful words to order anyone around. She had just reunited with the family, but she actually treated them as her subordinates.

Her words and actions were really hard to like.

He could tell that Madam didn’t like her too.

But since she was her biological daughter, she had no choice but to bear with it. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Madam had even called him aside and told him that he had suffered today. She even said that Miss Anxin had grown up outside for more than 10 years, and it was normal for her to have inappropriate behavior. She wanted him to bear with it.

“Aunt Bai found her daughter?” Qiao Mianmian widened her eyes in shock.

Mo Yesi was stunned too.

“Yes.” The butler spoke of Qiao Anxin calmly. “Madam Bai suddenly found her and did a paternity test. It was confirmed that it’s the Bai family’s blood. But...”

The butler paused and frowned again. “This new lady is quite different from what I imagined.”
