Gong Zeli was like an outsider. “Why should I mind? What do you want me to say?”

“Damn.” Yan Shaoqing looked at him and frowned. “You don’t mind? You’ve liked her for so many years, how could you not mind? Fourth Bro, what conflict did you have? Why haven’t you reconciled after so long?”

Lu Rao found it interesting and asked curiously, “Young Master Gong and Miss Shen have a conflict? This is really rare.”

Gong Zeli looked at them coldly. “When did you become so nosy?”

“No, Fourth Bro, what are you thinking?” Yan Shaoqing frowned again. “You really don’t care about Shen Rou?”

“Why should I care about her?”

Yan Shaoqing was speechless. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Don’t you f*cking like her?” Yan Shaoqing was getting a little agitated. He scratched his head. “The Shen family is in a hurry to get her to go on blind dates now because they want to get some support through the marriage. If you’re willing to help the Shen family now, you and her...”

“I can’t be with her. Never.”

Before Yan Shaoqing could finish, Gong Zeli interrupted him without hesitation.

He sounded firm and decisive.

Yan Shaoqing was stunned. “Why?”

“No reason.” Gong Zeli threw the water bottle to the woman with the bunny ears and picked up the club.

He bent down and aimed at a ball. “If you talk about such depressing things, I’ll leave.”

Yan Shaoqing was speechless.

He turned to look at Lu Rao. Both of them knew Gong Zeli’s temper. If he said he would leave, then he really would.

Yan Shaoqing didn’t want Gong Zeli to leave.

Although he was curious, he didn’t ask about Shen Rou anymore.

Anyway, he didn’t have a good relationship with Shen Rou.

Gong Zeli didn’t seem anxious at all. What was there to be anxious about as an unrelated person?

The next morning, Mo Yesi returned to Yuncheng City.

The next week, the shoot went smoothly. Qiao Mianmian finished a few scenes in advance, and Bai Yusheng even gave her two days off.

The banquet the Mo family prepared for Qiao Chen was scheduled for a week later.

Qiao Mianmian booked the flight ticket and went back to Yuncheng City.

Back in Yuncheng City, Qiao Chen picked her up at the airport.

Qiao Mianmian and Qiao Chen hadn’t seen each other in a while.

When the siblings met again, Qiao Mianmian realized that Qiao Chen had changed.

His dressing was different from before.

Although it was a simple outfit, the clothes looked expensive.

The Mo family’s bloodline was still different.

In the past, Qiao Chen didn’t like to dress himself up and was very casual about it. If it wasn’t for his looks, he would have been dressed like a man.

He was the Young Master of the Mo family now.

He couldn’t dress as casually as before.

Every day, a team would help him match his outfit.

The handsome young man even changed his hairstyle. His previous hairstyle made him look weak and cute.

Now that he had short hair, he looked like a wolf.
