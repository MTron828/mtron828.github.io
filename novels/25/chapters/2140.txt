Chapter 2142: How Dare They Frame Her

“I’m fine with anything. Brother-in-law can’t eat spicy food, so let’s pick a restaurant with a lighter taste.”

Qiao Chen still remembered the first time Mo Yesi ate hot pot with them.

“This is your day. Don’t bother about me, pick what you like.”

…

In the end, they found a restaurant with light food.

After lunch, they sent Qiao Chen back to school.

On the way back.

Qiao Mianmian received a notification on Weibo.

Most Popular News:?Shocking! Qiao Mianmian’s adoptive mother cried and complained that she and her daughter were chased out of the house by Qiao Mianmian. Now, they’ve been reduced to being homeless!

Qiao Mianmian was stunned for a few seconds when she saw the news and then checked it again to make sure she wasn’t seeing things.

The news should have just been released.

Qiao Mianmian clicked on it and saw that it was a news article from 10 minutes ago.

There was also an interview.

Qiao Mianmian read the news first. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

It was written in the news that Lin Huizhen found a reporter and cried to them that she and her daughter had been chased out of the house by her adopted daughter. Now, the mother and daughter had no home to return to. Not only that, but Qiao Mianmian also used underhanded means to frame her daughter, causing her daughter’s reputation to be ruined and her career to suffer a blow.

Qiao Mianmian hadn’t seen the interview yet, but she could already imagine how Lin Huizhen would complain about her.

Just as Qiao Mianmian finished reading the news, Linda called.

Qiao Mianmian picked it up. “Sister Xie.”

“Mianmian, did you see the news? Your stepmother told the reporters that she and Qiao Anxin have been chased out of the house by you and are now homeless.”

“Mm, I saw it.”

“What exactly happened?”

“She and Qiao Anxin did leave the Qiao Residence, but I didn’t chase them away.”

Qiao Mianmian found it funny.

Was Lin Huizhen really not afraid that she would expose their scandals?

How dare they frame her.

“Then, this…”

“Sister Xie, I’ll settle this myself. Don’t worry.”

“Alright. I’m just afraid that they’ll get desperate and cause trouble. After Qiao Anxin’s scandal was exposed, the endorsement she signed previously has been withdrawn. She’ll probably have to pay a lot of compensation now.

“She must hate you so much now. But you have Chairman Mo protecting you and the Bai family as your backing. No matter how much she hates you, she can’t do anything to you.”

“What happened?” Mo Yesi asked.

Qiao Mianmian handed him her cell phone.

Mo Yesi looked down at it in confusion. Qiao Mianmian saw that he was frowning.

“I don’t know where Lin Huizhen got her courage from.” Qiao Mianmian couldn’t understand. “She actually complained first.”

“She probably thinks that you won’t tell anyone about her. After all, family scandals shouldn’t be made public. Others might laugh at Father-in-law because of this.”

“Even if others laugh at her, they’re laughing at her. She’s the one who did something wrong, not Dad.” Qiao Mianmian was angry at what she’d just read. “She thinks I won’t expose them, huh.”
