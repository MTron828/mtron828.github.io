Chapter 1731: I’ll Make Her Pay!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“But you’re so smitten by her that you don’t even know what you’re doing. Such a pest can’t stay by your side anymore.”

“Mom, what are you trying to do?” Gong Zeli exuded a cold aura. “Our relationship isn’t what you think it is. Don’t mess around.”

“What do I want? Even if you’re not with Qingqing, you can’t be with such a lowly woman. She dared to seduce my son, I’ll make her pay!”

Madam Gong hung up angrily.

Gong Zeli clenched his fists.

...

Qiao Mianmian and Jiang Luoli had just finished eating and were walking out of the hot pot restaurant when they saw the car that came to pick them up parked by the street.

Mo Yesi drove a black Bentley.

Mo Shixiu’s black Rolls Royce came to pick Jiang Luoli up.

They said their goodbyes and got into the car.

Once Jiang Luoli got into the car, the chauffeur said, “Miss Jiang, Mister said that he has something on tonight, so he’ll be back later. He told you not to wait for him. If you’re tired, you can sleep first.”

Jiang Luoli nodded. “Mm, I got it.”

Mo Shixiu’s work determined that he wasn’t going to be home early. Jiang Luoli was already used to him coming home late.

The chauffeur drove off.

On the other side.

Qiao Mianmian realized that Mo Yesi was a little different from usual.

In the past, he would always get out of the car and wait for her outside.

He would help her buckle her seatbelt.

On days like today, he would even ask if she had fun with Jiang Luoli.

But today... Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Not only did he sit in the car, but he also didn’t react when Qiao Mianmian got in.

He didn’t buckle her seatbelt like before.

He didn’t say a word to her.

If Qiao Mianmian hadn’t confirmed that he was in the driver’s seat, she would have suspected that she got into the wrong car.

She had just buckled her seatbelt when she heard the car start.

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

She was even more certain now that something was wrong with Mo Yesi.

He must have been paying attention to her, but he didn’t say a word.

Qiao Mianmian thought about it and felt that he was angry with her.

But why?

Qiao Mianmian thought for a while and suddenly came up with a possibility.

She immediately took out her cell phone and opened Weibo.

As expected, she soon saw her name on the trending list.

# Qiao Mianmian intervenes in someone else’s relationship #

# Qiao Mianmian’s third party #

Just as she had guessed, she was trending again because of negative news. Even the headlines were similar to what she thought.

She clicked on the hot searches and saw that someone had recorded what happened.

The video also included Gong Zeli together with her.

After watching the video and reading the comments, Qiao Mianmian roughly knew why Mo Yesi was angry.

He must have seen this video, too.

He saw Gong Zeli standing up for her and sending her to the hospital.

Qiao Mianmian knew Mo Yesi well.

He minded her previous scandals with Gong Zeli very much.

He would probably be even more offended after seeing the trending topics today.

The car had been driving for a few minutes, but the man beside her still didn’t say a word.

Qiao Mianmian thought for a while and decided to break this stalemate.

She turned around and was about to speak when the car stopped.

Qiao Mianmian looked up and saw a red light.
