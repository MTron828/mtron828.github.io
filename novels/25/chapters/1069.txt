Chapter 1070: I Don’t Like It When People Scheme in Front of Me

Why didn’t he know?

Shen Rou looked like she wanted to say something, but hesitated. After a while, she said softly, “I heard that Brother Bai likes an actress in your crew. In order to get someone to take care of that actress, Brother Bai even claimed that she’s your cousin?”

Bai Yusheng’s expression changed.

His expression darkened, and his tone was no longer polite. “Miss Shen, where did you hear this nonsense from? Who told you this?”

“Brother Bai, are... are you angry?”

Shen Rou looked at him innocently and nervously. “I’m sorry, I think I said something I shouldn’t have. Brother Bai, you’re angry. I-I heard it from someone else too. I don’t know if it’s true.

“I only brought this up to Brother Bai because that actress is someone I know.”

“You heard it from someone else?”

“Y-Yes.”

“Who are you talking about? Who told you?”

“This...” Shen Rou looked troubled. “I heard it when I was chatting with my friends. I didn’t pay attention to who said it. Brother Bai, if this topic makes you unhappy, then... then let’s not talk about it anymore.

“Just pretend I didn’t say anything, alright?”

Bai Yusheng narrowed his eyes and said, “Miss Shen, I think we should get straight to the point. I don’t like to hide or beat around the bush. Miss Shen, I’m afraid you didn’t just mention it casually.”

He lowered his voice and asked sharply, “Miss Shen, what exactly are you trying to say?”

Shen Rou’s expression changed. “Brother Bai, I...”

“I’ve said it before, I don’t like people scheming in front of me. Shen Rou, what exactly are you trying to say?” Bai Yusheng cut her off impatiently. He was no longer polite and gentlemanly and addressed her by her full name.

Shen Rou’s expression changed again, and the unnatural smile on her lips became even more fake.

She stared at Bai Yusheng for a while and then suddenly laughed.

“Alright, Bai Yusheng. I don’t like to hide it from others. Since you’ve said it, I’ll just say it directly. That so-called rumor isn’t really just a rumor, right?” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Bai Yusheng narrowed his eyes and asked expressionlessly, “What do you mean?”

Shen Rou smiled and sat down on the bench. She looked up at him and said, “Actually, you like Qiao Mianmian, right? If you didn’t, you wouldn’t have done so much for her.

“You’re promoting her as the female lead and telling everyone that she’s your cousin. Don’t tell me you did this because Ah Si told you to.

“Bai Yusheng, I know what kind of person you are. Moreover, your relationship with Ah Si isn’t good enough for you to help him so much. Ha, Qiao Mianmian is really amazing. The most outstanding men in Yuncheng City’s four major families are about to be smitten by her.

“Can you tell me what you like about her? Her face?”

Shen Rou’s eyes were full of jealousy.

She really didn’t understand.

Why did all the men in the world seem to like Qiao Mianmian?

All the eligible men around her liked her.
