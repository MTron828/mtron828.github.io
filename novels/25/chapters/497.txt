Chapter 498:

Can the Trial Period End Yet?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Don’t worry. I will never let you down or do anything to hurt you.

“Although you don’t mind it, I think I should still explain things to you. The female secretaries weren’t hired by me. They’ve been working here for years even before I took over the Mo Corporation.

“I kept them because they’re really capable.”

“Mm, I got it.” Qiao Mianmian smiled and hugged him back.

Although she hadn’t suspected anything, it was nice that Mo Yesi took the initiative to clear things up.

This sort of man gave women a lot of security.

Most women were so suspicious and paranoid because men weren’t as sensitive as Mo Yesi.

“Baby.”

“Mm?”

“Can the trial period end yet?”

They’d already gotten so intimate that morning.

It’d be weird if he was still “pursuing” her.

Of course, the most important thing was that he could do anything he wanted once they were officially together.

Just like he was doing now, hugging and kissing her as he wished.

Qiao Mianmian recalled what happened this morning.

She sighed deep inside.

He’d only just started wooing her, and now they’d already done “it”?

She felt that it would be a little too much if he still asked to chase her, even after they’d already gotten intimate.

Then again, she felt that it wasn’t enough yet.

He said he’d pursue her properly.

It had only been two days. Wouldn’t it be such a loss on her part if she accepted him so soon?

She had barely enjoyed it.

Mo Yesi seemed to know what she was thinking. He chuckled and said, “Baby, I just want us to return to what we were before. If you like this feeling, I can continue to pursue you.

“I’ll use whichever means you prefer.

“I can pursue you for as long as you like, even if it takes a lifetime.”

Qiao Mianmian was stunned. “But... we’re already together. Is there a need to continue?” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Of course.” Mo Yesi said tenderly, “Who says I can’t continue wooing you after we’re together? If you like it, I’ll still do it.”

Qiao Mianmian locked eyes with him for a few seconds. Just as she was about to say something, her cell phone rang.

She picked it up immediately when she saw that it was Jiang Luoli.

“Wah! Baby, what’s with Prince Charming?”

“What do you mean?” Qiao Mianmian looked up at the man before her.

“He sent you 999 roses yesterday, why did he send you an even larger bouquet today? Is he going to send you this many every day? We can’t fit them all in our rooms.”

“I know Prince Charming is very rich, but could you tell him not to send this many flowers the next time. It’s such a waste to throw them away, and we have no idea what to do with them if we keep them.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

After she hung up, she asked Mo Yesi, “You sent me flowers again?”

“Mm.” Mo Yesi nodded.

He made Wei Zheng order 1314 pink roses yesterday. They had just been delivered.
