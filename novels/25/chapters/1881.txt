Chapter 1884: Come Back With Me

What did Qiao Anxin say to Song Ke?

...

After knowing that Mo Yesi was the one who came to visit her, Qiao Mianmian felt a little uneasy.

She stood at the door for a while before gently pushing it open. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

She guessed that Mo Yesi must have seen the news.

Indeed, this matter had blown up.

How could Mo Yesi not know?

He had always disapproved of her participating in this show. She was afraid that once he knew about this, he would be even more against it.

Qiao Mianmian was a little worried about what he would do if Mo Yesi objected strongly.

The moment the door was pushed open, the man sitting inside turned around and looked straight at her.

Their eyes met.

Qiao Mianmian paused and continued walking inside.

“Mo Yesi, why are you here? What about the company?” Qiao Mianmian asked, feigning ignorance.

The man’s handsome face was expressionless, and Qiao Mianmian could even feel that his expression was a little dark.

It was completely different from his gentle and doting smile.

Qiao Mianmian walked up to him and opened her mouth to speak, but he reached out and pulled her into his arms.

She lost her footing and let out a soft cry. She fell against him, and he held her firmly.

“Come back with me.” Mo Yesi’s tone was domineering.

Qiao Mianmian was about to cuddle him when she heard this.

Mo Yesi looked down at her coldly. “Mianmian, come back with me. Forget this show.”

Qiao Mianmian knew that Mo Yesi would definitely object to her continuing filming.

Unexpectedly, the moment they met, he immediately brought up this matter.

She looked up. “Mo Yesi, did you see... that news? Actually, you don’t have to worry. I’m fine now. I...”

“You’re fine now because you’re lucky. But have you ever thought about what would have happened otherwise? The police found a drug on that person. Have you ever thought about the consequences if you were drugged?

“Are you trying to tell me that you’re fine so that I don’t have to worry?

“Qiao Mianmian, do you know how worried I was? I shouldn’t have agreed to let you participate in this lousy show. Come with me right now, I won’t let you take any more risks. I’ll get someone to help you choose a suitable variety show.”

The man’s tone was not good. It was no longer the gentle tone he usually used when talking to her.

He had no intention of discussing it with her.

He was here to take her away.

With that, he stood up and pulled her away.

“Mo Yesi, wait, listen to me.” Qiao Mianmian reached out to hold him back. “Let’s discuss this matter again.”

Mo Yesi looked at her with a dark expression. “What else is there to discuss? Do you think I’ll allow you to continue staying here after something like this has happened? Mianmian, I support your work and allow you to do some things because I know you really like doing it. I can’t deprive you of your interests.

“But this doesn’t mean that I can continue to tolerate it even after something like this happened to you. There’s no room for negotiation. You have to come back with me.

“You like variety shows, so I’ll get someone to select a few more for you. You don’t have to worry about resources, I can give you whatever resources you want.”

It had been a long time since Mo Yesi reacted this strongly.
