Chapter 2271: But Shen Rou Didn’t Think So

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“You don’t have to respond to this. I’ll handle it.” Mo Yesi looked at his cell phone again and saw the news.

He had never thought of going against the Shen Corporation.

After all, he had no feud with the Shen family.

He had already taught her a lesson.

But Shen Rou’s actions and what happened today…

Mo Yesi’s eyes turned cold.

He didn’t want to do anything to the Shen family, but Shen Rou didn’t think so.

In that case, he wouldn’t show them mercy. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“What are you going to do?” Qiao Mianmian asked curiously.

Mo Yesi was about to answer her when Wei Zheng entered.

“Chairman Mo, our collaboration with Yu Lin has indeed been cut off. The Shen Corporation moved Yu Lin with a very low price. If nothing goes wrong, Yu Lin will sign the contract with them.”

“Is that so?” Mo Yesi smiled after hearing his report. “Just as I guessed. How much is the Shen Corporation offering?”

“300 million.”

“300 million? Can this price be done? I’m afraid they’ll lose money in the end.”

“Yes. This price is considered good even if we don’t earn a single cent. The possibility of losing money is very high. Chairman Mo, we…”

“Don’t worry about it. Since Yu Lin has chosen the Shen Corporation, let them work together smoothly. Such an unstable partner isn’t the best for our Mo Corporation’s long-term goal.”

“Yes, but I just received news that the Shen Corporation has made a move on our other business partners.” Wei Zheng paused for a while before continuing, “It seems like the Shen Corporation is deliberately going against us. Chairman Mo, what should we do next?”

Mo Yesi narrowed his eyes. “Nothing.”

Wei Zheng was stunned. “Nothing?”

“If the Shen Corporation wants to snatch our business, they have to offer a lower price. Otherwise, their chances of winning aren’t high. Although the Shen Corporation’s economic situation is improving, it won’t be able to last long if they keep making losses.

“Even if she loses eight hundred yuan, she might not be able to make me lose one hundred yuan. She’s just making things difficult for me.”

“I understand, Chairman Mo.”

“But there’s something you have to investigate.” Mo Yesi recalled what Yan Shaoqing told him a few days ago, and his eyes darkened. “Get someone to investigate Tang Ya. If you can’t find out through normal means, then use some special means.

“Perhaps she’s the main focus of our attention, not the Shen Corporation.”

Wei Zheng nodded. “Yes, Chairman Mo. I’ll get it done immediately.”

He then quickly left.

Qiao Mianmian asked impatiently, “What did Wei Zheng say just now? Is the Shen Corporation targeting the Mo Corporation?”

“Don’t worry.” Mo Yesi rubbed her head and said casually, “The Mo Corporation isn’t so easy to deal with. I can handle it.”

Qiao Mianmian believed that too.

It wasn’t surprising that Shen Rou would do something so extreme.

Qiao Mianmian was even more curious about something else.

“You got Wei Zheng to investigate Tang Ya. Is there something wrong with her?”

“Mm.” Mo Yesi nodded. “This person is very problematic. But we haven’t found out her background yet.”

Qiao Mianmian kept quiet for a while before saying, “I think this Tang Ya is a little strange, too.”
