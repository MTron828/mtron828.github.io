Chapter 897: When Have I Not Been Serious?

“But Mianmian, have you ever thought about why he took such a huge risk to shield you from the acid? There are some things I don’t want to say too clearly, but if I don’t say them, I’m afraid someone will take the opportunity to abduct my wife.”

Qiao Mianmian said, “Mo Yesi...”

“Mianmian, that guy likes you, and he has deep feelings for you. That’s why he took such a huge risk to shield you. You said it yourself, he made a huge sacrifice, and he can definitely think of the things you thought of, but he still chose to shield you.

“Would he do that if you were just friends?

“In front of human nature, everything is transparent. If it was someone else, he definitely wouldn’t do that.

“Face is very important to ordinary people, not to mention that your industry depends on looks.”

Qiao Mianmian kept quiet.

How could she not know how Tu Yilei felt towards her?

If she wasn’t sure before, she was sure now.

But Tu Yilei was her benefactor.

Even if she knew what he was thinking, she couldn’t possibly ignore him.

“But I can’t just ignore him. Mo Yesi, I owe him a huge favor...”

“I didn’t ask you to leave him alone. He really sacrificed a lot this time. If you just leave him like this, it really doesn’t make sense.”

“Then, you...”

Mo Yesi seemed to smile. “I do, how can I not? He helped my wife block a bullet. Such a huge favor, we both owe him. So, if you go to the hospital again, I’ll go with you.

“No matter what, I have to thank him in person.”

Qiao Mianmian was stunned. “You’re coming with me?”

“Mm, didn’t you say that you have to accompany him at the hospital? I’ll accompany you.”

“... But, don’t you have to work?”

“The documents can be sent to my email and the meeting can be done via video. As for the contract that needs to be discussed, if the other party is sincere, they will naturally come to F City to talk to me.”

Qiao Mianmian asked, “... Are you serious?”

Was this man crazy?

Mo Yesi said, “When have I not been serious? That fellow surnamed Tu wants to take this opportunity to develop his relationship. He’s thinking too much. I won’t let him have such an opportunity.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

“You’re still in the hospital?” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“Y-Yes.”

“Then, come out.”

“Come out?” Qiao Mianmian was stunned. “What do you mean?”

Mo Yesi said calmly, “I’m outside the hospital now. Should I look for you, or are you coming out to look for me?”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

...

Ten minutes later, at the hospital entrance.

Qiao Mianmian saw Mo Yesi standing by the glass door.

The hospital was always crowded, but when she glanced at the crowd, she saw him.

Mo Yesi was too eye-catching.

No matter how casual he was, his face, his figure, and aura were all there.

Just like now, he was only wearing a simple white shirt paired with his usual black pants. His long and straight legs were extremely eye-catching. Qiao Mianmian’s eyes were filled with his charming long legs.

Seeing him, she wondered why there was such a huge gap between people.
