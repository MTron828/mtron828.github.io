Chapter 2442: Untitled

So, Chairman Mo was just taking his fiancée shopping.

It wasn’t a surprise check?

After thinking it through, they heaved a huge sigh of relief.

“Chairman Mo, I’m sorry. We didn’t mean to scare Miss Qiao.”

They quickly apologized to Qiao Mianmian. “Miss Qiao, we’re really sorry for scaring you.”

“It’s alright, I’m not shocked.” Qiao Mianmian looked at the men who were old enough to be her dad and softened her tone. “I don’t mean to blame you.”

Qiao Mianmian wasn’t afraid of Mo Yesi.

But she knew that he was a terrifying existence in the Mo Corporation.

His subordinates were all afraid of him.

Even his right-hand man, Wei Zheng, was afraid of him.

Not to mention the high-level executives who rarely saw him.

The others also knew that their boss was here, so they hurried over to welcome him. They were afraid of being blamed for being late.

After all, if they knew that their boss was here but didn’t welcome him. Did they want to quit?

Mo Yesi scared them with just a few words.

Qiao Mianmian couldn’t bear to see the cold sweat on their foreheads.

Mo Yesi was too much.

Why did he scare them?

“Thank you for your understanding, Miss Qiao.” The executives heaved a sigh of relief. They thought that it was a good thing that this future Madam President had a good personality and didn’t deliberately make things difficult for them or put on airs in front of them.

“Alright, why are you still standing here?” Mo Yesi looked at the few executives who obviously didn’t know how to read expressions and frowned in disdain. “Go and do what you have to do. Also, Mianmian and I are just here for a walk. Don’t make it public.”

“Yes, Chairman Mo, Miss Qiao. Then, we… we’ll take our leave first.” The few executives finally saw the disdain in his eyes. Although their reactions were slow, they could tell that Mo Yesi despised them for being the third wheel here and disturbing him and his fiancée.

He was on a date with his fiancée, so it didn’t seem appropriate for them to follow them.

The few of them quickly left.

Qiao Mianmian couldn’t help but laugh as she watched them run away. She glared at Mo Yesi. “Your image in your subordinates’ hearts is too scary. They’re all so afraid of you.

“What did you do to make them so afraid?”

Mo Yesi wiped the coldness off his face and patted her head. “My image isn’t important to others, as long as you’re not afraid of me.”

Qiao Mianmian wasn’t afraid of Mo Yesi anymore.

But thinking back to when she first met him, she was actually a little afraid.

But now… T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

She could ride on his head and do whatever she wanted.

“Alright, let’s go to the stores first. There are clothes, shoes, bags, jewelry, and cosmetics that women like on this floor. Buy anything you like. Don’t think of saving money, alright?”

Mo Yesi wasn’t afraid of Qiao Mianmian squandering.

He was afraid that she wouldn’t be willing to squander.

He enjoyed spending money on her.
