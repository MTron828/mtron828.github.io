Chapter 1233: Family Competition

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Qiao Mianmian wasn’t hungry at all.

But she knew that Mo Yesi didn’t eat much at the banquet. He must be hungry.

She nodded. “Alright.”

They went downstairs hand in hand.

“Young Master, Young Madam.”

The maid placed the freshly cooked supper on the table.

The supper wasn’t too complicated. It was just two bowls of light seafood dumplings. Qiao Mianmian could smell the dumplings the moment she reached the dining room.

Mo Yesi held her hand and they sat down.

Qiao Mianmian wasn’t hungry at all, but she ate two to three of them in one go.

Mo Yesi ate for a while and recalled what happened at the banquet, as well as Madam Bai’s reluctance when they left...

He swallowed his words and looked up at Qiao Mianmian. “Aunt Bai took you away for a while. What did you talk about?”

“Mm?”

Qiao Mianmian had just swallowed her words. She wiped her lips with a napkin. “Nothing much, just chatting.”

“Nothing?” Mo Yesi’s eyes flickered.

Was he wrong?

Madam Bai didn’t take Qiao Mianmian away on purpose. Was she really just taking her out for a meal?

But Mo Yesi felt that his intuition wouldn’t be wrong.

Madam Bai’s behavior tonight wasn’t normal. She was too passionate about Qiao Mianmian and liked her too much.

This kind of enthusiasm and liking was beyond normal.

“Oh, not really. Aunt Bai told me something about her daughter. Mo Yesi, do you know what happened to Aunt Bai’s family back then to make her give her own daughter to someone else?”

Qiao Mianmian thought that Mo Yesi and Bai Yusheng had known each other for a few years and were good friends. Perhaps he knew about this.

Mo Yesi did know about this.

He pondered for a while and then said, “It’s just a family conflict. It’s the same as the ancient emperors killing their parents and brothers for the throne. In order to save their lives, their family had no choice but to flee overseas. At that time, Uncle Bai and Aunt Bai didn’t know if they could successfully escape. Under the situation where they could lose their lives at any time, they chose to give their daughter to a trusted subordinate.

“After that, they successfully escaped, but it was still unsafe overseas. They hid for many years. When they finally stabilized and wanted to take their daughter back, they lost contact with that subordinate for a long time.

“After that, they searched for more than 10 years. They always thought that the subordinate must have left Yuncheng City, so they’ve been searching for him all these years. You know, finding someone without any clues is like finding a needle in a haystack. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“That’s why they couldn’t find her even after more than 10 years.

“It was only recently that we found out that the subordinate might be in Yuncheng City.”

Qiao Mianmian was stunned for a while before whispering, “So, their daughter might be in Yuncheng City?”

“Mm.” Mo Yesi looked at Qiao Mianmian deeply. “Do you know why Aunt Bai was especially passionate about you tonight?”

“Because I look like her daughter?” Qiao Mianmian blinked.

“This is only one of the reasons.” Mo Yesi looked at her deeply again. “The main reason is that I’m guessing she thinks you’re her long-lost daughter.”
