Chapter 210: Don’t Poke Your Nose Into Other Affairs!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Lei En was a big man, and he couldn’t help but feel abashed hearing about it.

He coughed lightly to mask in embarrassment before asking, “Young Master is in the kitchen brewing a brown sugar drink or something. Do you know what that’s for?”

He felt like it had something to do with Young Madam.

After all, only matters concerning Young Madam would have Young Master act so strangely.

“Brown sugar drink?” The housemaid was stunned for a moment before a look of envy replaced the shock. She nodded and said, “Of course, that’s what girls drink on the few days of discomfort each month. Young Master should be preparing it for Young Madam.” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Gosh.

She was so envious!

Young Master was such an honorable man, but he was actually willing to do this himself.

Although it wasn’t that troublesome, this was the Young Master!

The Young Master who was born with a silver spoon and who never had to do any chores on his own!

It wouldn’t be shocking if an average person did this.

But this was a man like Young Master, of a completely different status! That made this action rare.

He didn’t have to do this.

Couldn’t he have instructed the employees in the kitchen to prepare it instead?

There could only be one reason that Young Master was willing to personally prepare the brown sugar drink for Young Madam.

He must really love her.

The housemaid was about to burst into tears from the envy!

After all, to the housemaids, Mo Yesi was like a divine being.

How could a divine being fall in love with a mortal?

Having found out what the brown sugar drink was for, Lei En was taken aback too.

Young Master was really making such an exception for Young Madam?

Although Lei En already knew that Mo Yesi valued Qiao Mianmian a lot since the first time he brought her home, he was even surer about it now.

He really hadn’t expected Young Master to view Young Madam with such importance.

It surpassed their imaginations.

It seemed like the rest of them had best take Young Madam and her matters seriously too!

They couldn’t afford to slip up at all.

It seemed like it was a greater mistake to offend Young Madam than Young Master now.

“Butler Lei En.” The housemaid looked very curious. “Do you know who exactly our Young Madam is? How did he suddenly get married to her without any hint or warning prior to that?”

They’d all thought that their future Young Madam would be Miss Shen Rou.

After all, Miss Shen Rou and Young Master could be considered childhood sweethearts.

The Shen family and Mo family were well-matched in social status, and the parents on both sides were on good terms.

Moreover, Madam really liked Miss Shen Rou and treated her like a biological daughter.

Madam must have wished that it was Miss Shen Rou whom Young Master married to.

Did Madam even know about Young Master’s marriage, let alone that the other party wasn’t Miss Shen Rou?

Lei En frowned the moment he heard her question. He told her off quietly, “This isn’t something you should be asking! Don’t look up on Young Master and Young Madam, it’s none of your business.

“Don’t blame me for not reminding you. Just do your job well and not poke your nose into other affairs!”

Lei En’s fierce tone shut the housemaid up immediately.

A few seconds later, she said meekly, “I-I got it. I won’t ask anymore.”
