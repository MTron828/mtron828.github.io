The elevator went directly to the 37th floor.

Outside the president’s office, Wei Zheng knocked on the door.

Qiao Mianmian heard a deep, cold voice inside, full of magnetism, with a bit of majesty that superior people possessed.

“Come in.”

Just listening to this voice made people feel that the person inside wasn’t easy to get close to.

She followed Wei Zheng into the office nervously.

“Chairman Mo, Ms. Qiao has arrived.”

After Wei Zheng said this, he turned and left.

The door was gently closed again.

At once, Qiao Mianmian and the man sitting at his desk reading documents were left in the huge office.

This was a masculine office, most of the furniture inside was black or grey.

The color was simple and a bit dull.

Only a few potted plants were placed to slightly alleviate its monotony.

The man was buried at the black desk... 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Qiao Mianmian raised her eyes and glanced at him secretly. She could feel the powerful aura he exuded.

He was in good shape and was wearing a black shirt. Because he had his head lowered, Qiao Mianmian could only see the rough outline of his features.

But she could still see that his features were deep and three-dimensional.

As she continued to look around him, the man suddenly raised his head.

Qiao Mianmian met a pair of deep cold eyes.

Shocked, her eyes fell on the man’s handsome face, and her heart suddenly skipped two beats.

She had never seen such a good-looking man.

The man’s face was sculptured finely. Every part of his face and every line was perfect and flawless.

His facial features were very three-dimensional and deep, with a pair of cold and deep eyes, a tall nose bridge, and sexy and alluring thin, tight lips.

He had a noble temperament and exuded a cold aura from all over.

There was no expression on his face, and his eyebrows were very cold. Even at a distance, Qiao Mianmian could feel the cold air coming from him.

When those cold eyes stared at her, she stopped breathing for several seconds.

She stared at him for a moment, her head blank.

Until a cold magnetic voice sounded in her ear. “Ms. Qiao.”

Qiao Mianmian returned to her senses.

Thinking of how she had just stared at him as if she was lovestruck, her face turned red and she bit her lip. Flustered, she said, “Hi, hello, Mr. Mo.”

“I wonder what’s the matter, Ms. Qiao?”

Qiao Mianmian seemed to return to her senses only now.

After hearing his question, she remembered her purpose of coming here today.

She suppressed the strange emotion in her heart, sorted out her thoughts, and said, “Mr. Mo, I would like to ask you to do me a favor.”

Mo Yesi raised an eyebrow.

Qiao Mianmian also knew that it was a strange thing for her to ask a stranger for help suddenly, but for Qiao Chen, she couldn’t care less.

After a few seconds of silence, she said, “My brother has a heart disease and needs an operation right away. I heard that Mr. Mo was previously experienced in such operations. I hope, hope that...”

“Hope that I can help your brother with this operation?” Looking at her swollen flushed face, Mo Yesi said the next difficult words for her.

“Yes.” Qiao Mianmian exhaled and looked at him pleadingly. “Mr. Mo, please help my brother. He is only 19...”
