Chapter 22: My Baby Looks Good in Anything

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Qiao Mianmian went quiet.

What a bold statement.

Her husband was truly wealthy.

“Also...” The chauffeur took a Black Card out of his bag and handed it to her. “Young Master wanted me to hand this to you. It’s Young Master’s subsidiary card, you can use it however you like.”

“For me?” Qiao Mianmian looked at the card for a moment, still reeling from the surprise. “It’s alright, I don’t need it.”

She never had the habit of spending a man’s money.

This man was her husband in name.

But Qiao Mianmian wasn’t able to truly see and treat him as her husband.

“Young Madam, Young Master will punish me if I don’t carry out his instructions properly.” The chauffeur pleaded with her. “If Young Madam doesn’t accept this card, I can’t answer to Young Master.”

Seeing how bothered he was by it, Qiao Mianmian accepted it after some hesitation.

But she didn’t intend to use it.

When she saw Mo Yesi later, she’d return it to him, along with the watch. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

A few people welcomed her when she arrived.

They were the senior employees of the mall. They stood around Qiao Mianmian politely.

Qiao Mianmian shopped around for a while, a little uncomfortable at having so many people around her at all times. “You don’t have to follow me around, I wish to do this shopping on my own.”

The few of them exchanged glances and hesitated for a moment before backing off.

This was a high-end mall that mainly sold branded goods.

The whole building was full of luxury items.

When the Qiao family was still doing well, Qiao Mianmian would buy these luxury items occasionally.

After the Qiao family lost their standing, she hadn’t been to places like these in a long time.

She walked into a female lingerie shop.

Seeing that she was dressed so ordinarily, the employees didn’t even bother to entertain her. Instead, they looked away and served the other customers.

Qiao Mianmian did not mind it either as she took her time to look around.

She wasn’t planning to buy anything, but it was a good pastime while she waited for Mo Yesi to be done with his matters.

A moment later.

She was about to leave when she heard a familiar voice.

The woman sounded coquettish, and it was obvious she was talking to a man. “Brother Ze, do I look good in this dress?”

Qiao Mianmian stopped in her tracks.

She turned around slowly and saw a young couple standing before the full-length mirror of a fitting room.

One was her ex-fiancé, the other was her stepsister.

Qiao Anxin had just put on a dress and was looking at herself in the mirror.

“Yup, you look good.” The man looked and sounded very gentle. He reached out to pat her head. “My baby looks good in anything.”

All the employees nearby looked on in envy as he addressed her as “baby” so affectionately.

One of them added, “That’s right. Miss Qiao is so beautiful and has such a nice figure. You look good in anything. Mr. Su is also good-looking! Miss Qiao and Mr. Su really are a match made in heaven.”

Qiao Anxin’s smile got even more radiant. She turned around and looked at Su Ze sweetly. “Brother Ze, look how good they are at talking. Now I’ll feel bad if I don’t buy this dress.”

“We’re just speaking the truth. Miss Qiao is a recognized beauty in the entertainment circle,” the employee said sweetly.

Su Ze felt his heart swell with pride as he listened to her.
