Chapter 1227: She Doesn’t Seem to Believe Me

Now, she had already revealed so much information and her red mark...

Had Madam Bai not thought about it?

But if she had thought about it, why would she have such a reaction?

Madam Bai finally spoke after a moment of silence.

She said calmly, “Mm, change your clothes. There’s something downstairs, I’ll go down first.”

With that, Madam Bai turned and walked out of the bedroom.

Qiao Anxin widened her eyes in disbelief.

...

Madam Bai went downstairs with a heavy heart.

Her friends came over to talk to her, but she looked distracted. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

The banquet had already begun.

Such a banquet was basically a high-end social gathering. A lot of people wanted to get to know them, and the banquet hall was filled with laughter.

Madam Bai searched the hall and saw Qiao Mianmian standing in a corner.

She was with Mo Yesi, and they were talking about something.

The thought of her daughter not being Qiao Mianmian but Qiao Anxin made Madam Bai feel terrible.

She had been looking for her daughter for over a decade.

She seemed to have finally found it.

But she wasn’t happy at all.

Shen Rou saw that Madam Bai came down alone and couldn’t help but frown. She hesitated for a few seconds before turning and walking upstairs.

...

Upstairs, Shen Rou opened the door and saw that Qiao Anxin had already changed and was walking out.

She closed the door.

“How is it? Does she believe that you’re her daughter now?” Shen Rou had just seen Madam Bai come downstairs alone and felt that this might not go as smoothly as she’d expected. She was still worried and came up.

Her guess was confirmed when she saw Qiao Anxin’s darkened expression.

She frowned and said unhappily, “What’s wrong? Did it not go well?”

“I don’t know.” Qiao Anxin thought of Madam Bai’s reaction and said, “She doesn’t seem to believe me. Miss Shen, didn’t you say that as long as I do this, she’ll definitely believe that I’m her daughter?

“But I didn’t see any joy on her face. Do you know that she has been doubting me from the start? Miss Shen, are you sure our plan will succeed?” Qiao Anxin’s confidence and smugness turned uneasy.

She realized that Madam Bai wasn’t as easy to fool as she thought. Instead, she was a very smart woman.

She couldn’t imagine the consequences if she was found out.

By then, Shen Rou would still be Young Lady Shen.

The Bai family wouldn’t do anything to her.

But her.

Qiao Anxin’s face went pale. “I think Madam Bai is suspecting me. Do you think she’ll investigate me? If she finds out...”

“It’s just a small matter, why are you so scared?”

Shen Rou looked at her in disdain and said coldly, “It’s normal for her to suspect you. You’re not her daughter, and you don’t look like her. But no matter how she doubts you now, as long as the paternity test results are out, she won’t doubt your identity anymore.”

“But she didn’t say anything about the paternity test.”
