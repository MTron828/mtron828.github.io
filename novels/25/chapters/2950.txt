He hesitated for a few seconds, but in the end, he made up his mind. “Ive already decided. Let’s get a divorce.”

“Why?” Madam Mo cried. “Is it because of Yueyue? I know I did something wrong. I won’t do it again. I’ve never thought of divorcing you. I want to be your wife for the rest of my life. I don’t want to divorce you.”

‘Mo Yunchen had pampered her for over 20 years.

Listening to her sobbing on the phone, he felt as if something was tugging at his heart.

But he still steeled his heart. “Wenpei, I’m calling you just to let you know my decision. I’ve already decided on the divorce. I won’t change my mind. After this call, I’ll get my lawyer to settle the divorce papers. If you have any other requests, you can raise them now.”

Madam Mo cried for a while more before stopping.

“You’ve made up your mind to divorce me, right?” Madam Mo’s voice seemed to calm down.

Mo Yunchen looked at Tang Ya and remembered how much he owed her. “Wenpei, I’m sorry.”

“Alright, I agree to divorce you. But you have to tell me why you suddenly want to divorce me. Is it because of Yueyue… or Tang Wanqiu?”

“Wenpei…”

“Answer me. Mo Yunchen, do you want to divorce me because of Yueyue or because of Tang Wangiu? You saw Tang Ya, right? What did she say to you? Did she tell you about Tang Wanqiu?

“Did Tang Ya ask you to divorce me, or did you think of it yourself?”

Mo Yunchen took a deep breath. “It’s my decision.”

“You decided it yourself?”

“Yes.”

“Mo Yunchen, say it again. Did you really decide it yourself?”

“Yes.”

“Alright, I agree to the divorce. If you really want to divorce me, then let’s divorce.”

Madam Mo hung up.

“Have you settled it?” Tang Ya looked at the defeated Mo Yunchen and asked indifferently.

He looked at the black screen and replied, “Yes.”

“Is your wife willing to divorce you?”

“She agreed.”

“Then, you can get someone to settle the divorce papers now.” Tang Ya sneered when she saw Mo Yunchen’s dejected expression. “The Mo family will get the divorce papers faster than the average person.

“Once you get the divorce certificate, this matter will be over.”

Mo Yunchen looked up at her and didn’t say anything. He picked up his cell phone and made another call.

“T’s me. Go to the Civil Affairs Bureau now.

“To settle my divorce with Madam.

“You didn’t hear wrongly. Get it done right away.”

A moment later, Mo Yunchen ended the call.

“Tve already gotten someone to start the divorce procedures. We have to wait for half an hour.” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“Alright, we’ll talk about other things when you get the divorce certificate.”

“TIl do whatever you say. But before that, shouldn’t you let me see Yueyue? Otherwise, how would I know if she’s safe?”

“Of course.” Tang Ya bent down and picked up her cell phone from the sofa. She then opened a video app and threw the phone to him..
