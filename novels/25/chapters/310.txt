Chapter 311: What a Terrifyingly Rich Person!

Mo Yesi had given her a Black Card, and she’d barely used it.

But now, she’d thought things out.

Since she’d decided to accept him, then she’d treat him like a real husband. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

So, wasn’t it only right for a wife to use her husband’s money?

Especially when her husband was so rich?

She didn’t feel so bad spending his money anymore.

In fact, if she didn’t spend a single cent, she felt that Mo Yesi would take issue with it.

“Baby, are you sure you want to give me a treat here?”

Jiang Luoli flipped through the menu and was a little startled by the prices.

This revolving restaurant was very famous.

Bai Yusheng had taken her here once when he met a few people to discuss a deal. The six of them spent about a million yuan in total.

It left a lasting impression on her.

“Of course. Do I look like I’m kidding?”

“But it’s really expensive here...”

Jiang Luoli used the menu to cover the side of her face as she whispered, “If it’s Prince Charming treating us, I wouldn’t mind any expensive place. But you? Did you bring enough money?”

Jiang Luoli was very clear about Qiao Mianmian’s financial situation.

The last time they ate at a private club, it was Mo Yesi’s treat.

So she didn’t have to worry about Qiao Mianmian footing the bill.

Even though this place was slightly cheaper than the private clubhouse, it would rack up a six-figure bill for the three of them.

Qiao Mianmian did not say anything. She simply reached for the wallet in her bag and then took out the Black Card.

She placed it on the table. “Baby, don’t worry. Just eat in peace. There’s enough money in this card for this meal.”

“Damn, a Black Card?”

Jiang Luoli widened her eyes and picked up the card, scanning both sides. She lowered her voice but could not contain her excitement as she asked, “Baby, did Prince Charming give it to you?”

“Yes.”

“How much money is there in this card?”

Qiao Mianmian told her honestly, “About a million yuan per month. He said it’s my allowance.”

“Damn, a million yuan a month for an allowance?” Jiang Luoli was about to drool.

“Mm, that’s right. He said I wasn’t good enough at being a spendthrift, so he’s giving me less first.”

Jiang Luoli was speechless.

What a terrifyingly rich person!

Even the allowance was a seven-digit figure.

“Baby, tell me, does Prince Charming have a brother? Any brother, as long as he isn’t underage. Ah, I want a boyfriend who can give me a million yuan a month too! I suddenly want to be in love. What do I do?”

She wouldn’t have to fight for anything else in life if she had a boyfriend who gave her a million yuan a month.

It was no secret that her life goal was to be a blissful leech that didn’t have to worry about working. She simply wanted to eat well, sleep well, and play all she liked.

Qiao Mianmian thought of Mo Shixiu and got a little excited. After a short pause, she said, “He does have an elder brother?”

“Elder brother? That’s good.” Jiang Luoli grinned. “Are they biological brothers? From the same womb?”

“Mm, biological brothers.” And he’s your other male crush, Qiao Mianmian added in her head.

“Have you seen him? Is he handsome? How’s his physique? Is it as good as Prince Charming’s?”

Qiao Mianmian considered it carefully before saying, “He’s rather handsome, and his physique is pretty good too. As for whether he’s as good as your Prince Charming...”
