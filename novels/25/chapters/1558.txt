Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Nana went to get Qiao Mianmian her favorite strawberry flavor.

“Mianmian, who do you think the crush is?” Nana couldn’t help but exclaim as she sipped on her milk tea. “It’s been almost a month, and he’s been sending so many afternoon teas over every day. What exactly is he doing?

“He wants to bribe the entire crew with this method. We’ll understand when the time comes? When that time comes, we, who have enjoyed many benefits from him, will speak up for him. His chances of confessing and seeking love will be higher.

“I think so. Mianmian, what do you think?”

Qiao Mianmian bit on a piece of strawberry meat and couldn’t deny it. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

She was also curious about the mysterious person who had invited the entire crew for more than a month of afternoon tea.

Actually, she wasn’t the only one curious. The entire crew was curious too.

Everyone was guessing who it was.

Was she really someone’s crush?

But this person was always like this and refused to show his face. The hotel that sent afternoon tea also kept his identity a secret.

She really couldn’t guess who he was.

“Who cares who he is.” Qiao Mianmian shook the strawberry milkshake in her hand and bit the straw. “I hope he can confess later. In that case, we can continue drinking afternoon tea.

“The strawberry milkshakes are really good.”

...

The next day.

Knowing that Qiao Mianmian was going to audition for the movie, Linda rushed over from Yuncheng City to personally accompany her.

In the car.

Linda knew that Qin Han was the one who helped Qiao Mianmian with the audition. She couldn’t help but say, “Qin Han is really nice to you. He’s even willing to introduce you to an audition for such a role. He really helped you.

“If it wasn’t for his recommendation, given your current popularity, you definitely wouldn’t have gotten the chance to audition.”

Even the A-list celebrities had to audition for the role.

Anyone who failed the audition would be eliminated, no matter how popular they were.

Hence, today’s audition was definitely a test of the actors’ abilities.

Some of the male idols and female artistes didn’t even dare to come for the audition.

Qiao Mianmian had acting skills.

But Linda still felt that her chances of being chosen were slim.

After all, she was a newbie.

There was no shortage of capable actors in this industry.

“Yes, Qin Han treats me very well, so I’m very grateful that he gave me this opportunity. Actually, I don’t have much hope this time. Just take it that I’m here to gain experience. It’s not bad to see so many big shot seniors.”

“It’s good that you think that way. You’re right. Whether you can be chosen or not, it’s already good enough that you can attend the audition. It’s not easy to enter the movie industry. Many big shots from television dramas have long wanted to enter the movie industry, but they haven’t succeeded. Moreover, you’re still a newbie.” Linda was afraid that she wouldn’t perform well on the spot due to the pressure. Hearing her say this, she felt more at ease.

Although she sounded nonchalant about the audition, she still had hope.

Perhaps a miracle would happen.

What if they liked Qiao Mianmian?

Linda felt that besides her lack of fame, Qiao Mianmian’s other qualities were very good.

Her looks were outstanding and her acting wasn’t bad. She was the type that would definitely become popular if given a chance.
