Chapter 55: Did I Allow You to Leave?

He held her in one hand, held up a glass of milk on the table, and fed it to her mouth. “Come, drink some milk first.”

Qiao Mianmian went quiet.

“Can I do it myself...”

“Huh?” The man raised his eyebrows, and his devilishly handsome face revealed a demonic smirk. “You don’t like it this way? Do you want me to feed it to you mouth to mouth?”

“...”

Qiao Mianmian whined and didn’t dare to ask for anything. She blushed as she drank the milk from the man’s hand.

The maids behind were so envious that they were about to cry.

Oh, Madam was too blessed.

There would be no regret in her life to be able to receive such affection from the young master!

At the same time, several people also knew more clearly what position Qiao Mianmian occupied in Mo Yesi’s heart.

This young lady was so loved by the young master that she must be treated with respect.

While eating breakfast, Qiao Mianmian’s heartbeat accelerated.

Mo Yesi seemed to be addicted to feeding her. Qiao Mianmian didn’t feed herself at all during the meal.

After eating, Mo Yesi went upstairs to change his clothes, and Qiao Mianmian sat in the living room waiting for him.

More than ten minutes later, Mo Yesi changed his clothes and went downstairs.

The moment she saw him, Qiao Mianmian was stunned.

The high-end hand-made suit was fitted to outline his wide shoulders, narrow waist, and long legs. It made his originally perfect model figure even more attractive and alluring.

His pair of straight and powerful long legs were extremely visually striking.

In a suit and leather shoes, his temperament was cold and arrogant, and his body was full of asceticism.

Looking at his handsome and deep face, Qiao Mianmian’s heartbeat suddenly quickened.

“Master, the car is ready,” Lei En came over and said respectfully.

“Okay.” Mo Yesi arranged the buttons on his sleeves and walked towards Qiao Mianmian. “Let’s go. Let me send you to school.”

She didn’t know if it was because Mo Yesi hadn’t slept well last night, but he rested his eyes the whole way.

Only at this time was Qiao Mianmian bolder.

From time to time, while he was asleep, she turned her head to sneak glances at him.

As soon as she thought of the intimate moves he had done to herself before, her face flushed hotly.

Her heartbeat also quickened.

Near the school, Qiao Mianmian asked Uncle Li to park his car in a less eye-catching place.

Although she was married to Mo Yesi, she didn’t want to let too many people know about the marriage.

Uncle Li parked his car.

Qiao Mianmian was thinking about saying goodbye to Mo Yesi when she saw the man beside her slowly open his eyes.

Those eyes, which were darker than the night, stared at her, and he said in a slightly husky voice, “We’ve reached?”

“Yes.” Qiao Mianmian nodded. “I’m going to get off the car. Then... I’ll see you another day.” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

After speaking, Qiao Mianmian opened the door and was about to get off.

“Have I allowed you to go?”

Behind her, the man’s voice was faint, but it made Qiao Mianmian freeze.

She turned her head and asked, “... is there anything else?”

The handsome and exquisite man frowned and said in dissatisfaction, “Come here.”

Qiao Mianmian hesitated but still moved her body.

As soon as she approached, Mo Yesi pulled her into his arms. Before she could react, the man’s hot kiss fell down on her.

When Qiao Mianmian was about to pass out from lack of breath, the man let go of her.

His long fingers pressed against her lips, and he said in a husky voice, “This is a farewell kiss.”

Qiao Mianmian’s legs were soft when she got out of the car.

She covered her hot cheeks, waited for the people in the car while feeling embarrassed and shy before turning away.
