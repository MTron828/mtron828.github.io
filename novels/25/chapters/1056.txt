Chapter 1057: Unconsciously Flirting

Jiang Luoli immediately took another sip and smiled. “Mr. Mo, this red wine is really good. Is this bottle of red wine very expensive? Have you ever seen anyone drink as fast as me?”

She had already finished her drink.

But Mo Shixiu still had more than half of his left.

She heard that good wine had to be savored slowly. It seemed like she was too fast.

Mo Shixiu was stunned for a while before he shook his head and smiled. “Miss Jiang, there’s nothing bad about your personality. It doesn’t matter whether the wine is expensive or not. What matters is whether you like it. If Miss Jiang likes it, it’s fine even if it costs a lot.”

Jiang Luoli was speechless.

Damn.

Her heart started racing again.

She seriously suspected whether Mo Shixiu had never been in a relationship before.

She didn’t think so.

If he had never been in a relationship, why was he always flirting with women?

As long as she liked it, it didn’t matter if it cost a lot...

This was too alluring.

How could a man with no experience in love say that?

Most importantly, he said it so naturally.

Although he was saying sweet nothings, he still looked serious. The contrast between the two made her wonder if she was overthinking it.

He wasn’t flirting with her at all.

She just felt like she’d been seduced.

Perhaps he didn’t know that his words were so alluring?

What did this belong to?

Unconsciously flirting?

Even though Mo Shixiu wasn’t really flirting with her, Jiang Luoli thought so.

Her heart started pounding again.

She couldn’t help but panic.

“Miss Jiang, you shouldn’t drink too much.” Mo Shixiu saw the blush on her face and thought that it was caused by drinking. He couldn’t help but worry. “The red wine isn’t high in alcohol content, but it has a strong aftertaste. This bottle of wine has been kept for a long time, so it’s easy to get drunk.

“Miss Jiang, don’t drink anymore.”

“I’m fine.” Jiang Luoli patted her burning cheeks and glanced at him quickly. Her face burned again as she hurriedly lowered her head. “I won’t get drunk from drinking red wine. It’s only two glasses, I can hold my liquor in one bottle.

“This bit of wine is nothing to me.”

Mo Shixiu frowned slightly. “Anyway, don’t drink too much.”

Jiang Luoli stuffed a piece of steak into her mouth and chewed it. After swallowing it, she looked up at him and joked. “Mr. Mo, are you afraid that I’ll drink too much and finish this bottle of expensive wine?” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Mo Shixiu was stunned. “How could that be?”

“So, I can drink as much as I want?”

“Of course, but...”

“Then, Mr. Mo, don’t bother about how much I drink. Anyway, I still have you when I’m drunk.” Jiang Luoli suddenly felt like teasing him when she saw how serious and cold he looked.

Perhaps it was because of the wine.

Jiang Luoli suddenly became more daring.

She didn’t dare to look him in the eye just now. But now she looked at him and teased him. “Mr. Mo is a gentleman. When I’m with you, I’m not worried about getting drunk at all. I believe that even if I’m drunk, Mr. Mo will be a gentleman to the end and won’t do anything wrong to me, right?”
