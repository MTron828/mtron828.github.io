Chapter 2596: Let’s Die Together

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Back then, she took the risk to accompany them in order to get two roles.

She’d thought that she’d done a good job keeping it a secret.

In fact, no one noticed it.

Otherwise, she would have long been exposed.

She thought that no one would know about this. It had been so many years, and it was impossible for anyone to have any evidence against her.

But the person she offended this time was Mo Yesi.

Nothing was impossible to him.

“Qiao Mianmian, it must be that slut.

“That b*tch wants to kill me!

“Even if I die, I’ll drag you down with me! Qiao Mianmian, you’ve hurt me so much. You’ve ruined everything. I won’t let you off. I want you to die, I want you to die!”

Little Xiao seemed to have lost her mind as she screamed crazily.

Her eyes were filled with hatred.

There was only one thought in her mind.

If she was ruined, she wouldn’t let Qiao Mianmian have it easy.

She was already in such a terrible state.

She’d been hurt so badly by Qiao Mianmian that she’d never have a chance to make a comeback in her life.

She could already see how terrible her future would be.

What was so scary about someone who had lost everything?

Even her last hope was ruined by that slut.

She had nothing to fear now.

She didn’t have to worry anymore.

Since that slut wasn’t willing to let her live, then let’s die together.

A look of hatred flashed past her eyes.

…

“Did you get someone to expose Little Xiao’s photos and videos?”

Qiao Mianmian asked Mo Yesi when she saw Little Xiao’s trending topics.

“Mm, what’s wrong?” Mo Yesi nodded and admitted it. “Since she’s not sensible, of course she has to be taught a lesson.”

“Where did you get those photos and videos?” Qiao Mianmian was curious. “I didn’t know she had this past.”

“This isn’t difficult.”

Mo Yesi walked to her side and took the script away from her. He put his arm around her waist and chuckled. “They bought it from someone else when they had the money and the ability to use it. They even filmed it themselves. This is easier to find. It can be solved with some technology.

“If she apologized to you properly, this matter would have ended there. But since she dared to pour dirty water on you and get people to scold you, then I decided to teach her a lesson.”

Qiao Mianmian kept quiet for a while.

“What’s wrong? Do you think I went overboard?” Mo Yesi pinched her chin and looked at her gently.

“No.” Qiao Mianmian shook her head. She leaned against him and rested her head on his exposed chest. “I don’t think it’s overboard at all. You did this for me, how could you go overboard?

“She did attack me. Moreover, the photos and videos aren’t fake. If she didn’t do those things, she wouldn’t have anything to worry about.

“She flirted with so many married men. She’s no different from a third party. This kind of immoral person should be taught a lesson.”

Mo Yesi looked at her in shock.Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com
