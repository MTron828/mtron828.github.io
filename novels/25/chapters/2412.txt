Chapter 2415: Yan Shaoqing Is Your Cousin?

Qiao Chen would only wake up after a while.

Now, Mo Xingshu was guarding him.

With so many professionals taking turns to take care of him, she had nothing to worry about. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“I’ll get Wei Zheng to check for good food around the hospital.” Mo Yesi took out his cell phone and sent Wei Zheng a WeChat message.

Wei Zheng replied within two to three minutes.

He sent him the names of all the shops that had good taste and let Mo Yesi pick it himself.

Mo Yesi handed the cell phone to her. “See what you want to eat. Wei Zheng said that these are all good.”

Qiao Mianmian chose a restaurant with light food and drove there.

…

When they reached the restaurant, they heard an argument behind them.

Qiao Mianmian found the voice of a girl familiar and turned around curiously.

Then, she saw a familiar face.

They weren’t really acquaintances.

It was Lin Wanwan, Yan Shaoqing’s cousin.

She seemed to be in trouble.

A few men in their twenties and dressed like rich playboys were standing opposite her. The man in the lead looked at Lin Wanwan maliciously and teased her.

“Little girl, don’t be angry. I really like you. Don’t be afraid. I just want you to have a meal with me, not eat you. If you make us happy, I’ll buy you nice clothes and bags, alright?

“I’ll get you whatever you like.”

“I don’t need it, I have the money to buy it myself. If you continue like this, I-I’ll call the police.” Lin Wanwan looked flustered as she yelled at them, obviously afraid of these older guys.

Hence, she used her voice to hide her fear.

“Call the police?” The men laughed.

“Aiyo, little sister, are you calling the police? We’re so scared.”

“Yes, we’re really afraid of death.”

“Little girl, can you not call the police?”

The few of them said a few strange words and then laughed.

Lin Wanwan was young. Although she was usually arrogant and domineering, it was only in front of people she knew.

These men obviously didn’t know her.

Or rather, even if they knew each other, they didn’t take her seriously.

Lin Wanwan saw that they weren’t afraid of the police and took a step back.

“Little girl, don’t go. You haven’t eaten with us.”

A rich playboy smiled, stepped forward, and reached out to pull her. “Don’t be afraid. We’re all good people. We’ll only dote on you and will not hurt you.”

“Don’t touch me.”

Lin Wanwan screamed and slapped his hand away. “My cousin is Yan Shaoqing, the Second Young Master of the Yan family. Get lost, or I’ll call my cousin over and let him beat you to death!”

The man’s expression darkened. He was about to get rough when he heard Yan Shaoqing’s name.

The others were also stunned.

“Yan Shaoqing is your cousin?” These rich playboys were obviously afraid of Yan Shaoqing and didn’t dare to do anything to her.
