But his body quickly relaxed and his hug turned warm.

Mo Yesi’s voice was hoarse. “Mianmian, have you missed me?”

“Mo Yesi.” Qiao Mianmian’s face went red the moment she thought about the fact that they were at the female dormitory and many people were watching. “Let me go, alright. A lot of people are looking at us.”

With that, she tried to struggle.

She wasn’t against him getting close to her.

But it bothered her that so many people were watching.

“Baby, don’t move.” Mo Yesi tightened his arms around her and rested his head on her chin. “I’m so tired, just let me hold you for a while. Just a minute will do.”

Hearing the fatigue in his voice, Qiao Mianmian hesitated for a while and decided to let him have it.

So many people were looking at them in confusion.

He had been so cold to all the girls just a moment ago and was now so gentle and warm to the girl in his arms. Many of the onlookers watched in envy.

They wished they could be in Qiao Mianmian’s place, experiencing the embrace of such a hunk.

A minute later.

Mo Yesi released Qiao Mianmian like a lion who had just had his fill.

The exhaustion on his face faded slightly.

It seemed like the one minute of recuperation helped significantly.

When he spoke again, it was with less fatigue. “Have you had lunch?”

Qiao Mianmian shook her head. “Not yet.”

She was just about to have her lunch when he came along.

“W-What are you doing here?” Qiao Mianmian was still a little confused.

He had come to look for her during school hours two days in a row. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Hm... did he have so much free time at work?

She knew he was the big boss and his work hours were more flexible, unlike the nine to five jobs.

But she felt that he was a very disciplined and organized person. Be it at work or in other areas of his life, he always had things planned out properly and would stick to them.

It didn’t seem like his style to be out of the office for personal matters in the middle of the day.

Mo Yesi looked at her deeply and then said, “I wanted to see you, so I came.”

“Uh...”

Qiao Mianmian’s heart pounded.

I wanted to see you, so I came...

Qiao Mianmian understood this as him missing her.

She looked at that handsome face and got even more flustered.

He paused for a while and then added, “You weren’t around last night. I couldn’t sleep.”

Qiao Mianmian went quiet.

She didn’t know that he had problems sleeping.

She thought he was just teasing her.

Her cheeks burned as her heart raced.

But the fact was that Mo Yesi really did not have a good sleep.

He had woken up in the middle of the night several times, and even when he was asleep, he had nightmares.

It was the nightmare that had haunted him for 20 years. It was just like a monster that came after him whenever he was unconscious.

Only when she was around could he breathe in peace.

Qiao Mianmian looked up, still flushed, and could see that his eyes were slightly bloodshot.

It seemed like he really didn’t have a good rest.
