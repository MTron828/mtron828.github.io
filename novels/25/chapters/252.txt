Chapter 253: Almost Had a Heart Attack

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Qiao Mianmian felt like the place where Mo Yesi lived was big enough.

But only when the car drove into the Mo family’s villa did she realize what it meant by poverty limiting one’s imagination.

The Mo family’s old villa was just like a forest park. It took more than ten minutes to reach the residential area after entering the gate.

Towering trees reaching high into the sky and pavilions could be seen everywhere.

She had the illusion of walking into an ancient palace compound. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

The architectural style of the old villa of the Mo family was very classical. It was obvious that the plants and trees here were all years old.

It was a real old villa.

From this, it could be seen that the Mo family was prestigious.

They were definitely different from those rich upstarts.

At least three generations or more of the Mo family had been very rich.

In comparison, the Su family really wasn’t enough.

After driving for a while, the car stopped in front of a courtyard.

Uncle Li got out of the car and opened the rear compartment door.

Mo Yesi got off first.

The old butler of the Mo family’s house had already been informed long ago and was waiting at the side. He immediately came forward when he saw Mo Yesi and greeted him respectfully. “Second Young Master.”

Nodding, Mo Yesi turned around and stretched out a hand into the car.

Upon seeing this, the old butler looked over curiously.

Was there someone in the car?

But who was sitting in the car to make the Young Master suddenly behave so gentlemanly?

After a few seconds, the old butler saw a white and tender hand reach out from inside the car and place itself on the Young Master’s hand.

His Young Master held the white, tender hand.

Old butler: “!!!”

What was going on?

There was a woman in the Young Master’s car??!!

And the Young Master was being so caring towards her?!!!

Before she even got out of the car, the old butler was already staring at her with widened eyes and a gaping mouth.

Even though he had been in the Mo family’s house for decades, and no matter how good his mental quality was, he still couldn’t remain calm at this time.

After a few more seconds, under the shocked eyes of the old butler, the person in the car finally got off.

When his eyes fell on Qiao Mianmian, the old butler’s eyes once again revealed a look of shock and astonishment.

Not only was there a woman in the Young Master’s car, but it was a very young girl!

The little girl had a particularly beautiful face, with delicate features, big eyes, and a small face. Her face was probably only as big as his palm.

Under the sun, her delicate skin was white and shiny.

She wasn’t very exquisitely dressed but was still so beautiful that people were unable to avert their eyes away.

The old butler had a good taste and could tell at one glance that this little girl was different from the pretty and flirtatious girls outside.

She had a clean temperament and was very likable and fresh.

But the old butler was further shocked by what followed.

After he saw the little girl get out of the car, his Young Master reached out to grab her waist.

Old butler: “!!!”

“Young- Young Master, this is...” His eyes widened as if he had just seen an alien, and he stared at Qiao Mianmian with a shocked, novel expression.

Mo Yesi put his arms around Qiao Mianmian’s waist and looked down at her. He said in an affectionate tone, “This is the Young Madam.”

Then, he introduced the old butler to Qiao Mianmian, who was obviously still a little nervous. “Mianmian, this is Uncle Zhang. He’s the old butler of the Mo family’s house.”

Uncle Zhang almost fainted when he heard the words “Young Madam”.

He almost had a heart attack.

“Young- Young Madam?” Uncle Zhang felt like the stimulation he just received was more than the past ten years accumulated.
