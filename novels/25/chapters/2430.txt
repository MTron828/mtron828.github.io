Chapter 2433: Men Can Look So Good When They Smile

Few people could compare to him in terms of looks, but those who could were far inferior in other aspects.

No one could compare to him.

“Is that Chairman Mo? Gosh, he’s so handsome.”

“He’s so classy. His coat is high-end, right? I can’t tell what brand it is, but it looks so expensive.”

“No wonder someone said that if the Chairman of the Mo Corporation debuted with his looks, he would definitely become popular immediately and beat all the young hunks. Seeing him in person, it’s not an exaggeration. Tsk tsk, this figure, this face, this aura, it’s really one in a million.”

“The thing he’s wearing… Am I seeing things? It looks like a girl’s leather band?”

“You didn’t see it wrongly, I saw it too. It’s indeed a girl’s leather band. I didn’t expect a man like him to be willing to wear this. It seems like he really likes Qiao Mianmian.”

Girls knew the significance of this band.

Because they had boyfriends too.

But they were still a little shocked when they saw the leather band on Mo Yesi’s wrist.

His status was different.

A man of high status like him usually cared about his face and wouldn’t be willing to wear a girl’s accessory.

If he was willing to wear it, it meant that the girl who put the leather band on him was someone he cared about.

The girls were envious of Qiao Mianmian. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

She had such a handsome, rich man who liked her fiancé so much, and his fiancé was a super rich young master…

Her career was doing well, and she was the daughter of the Bai family.

She was practically a winner in life.

It was so enviable.

As the female employees looked at Mo Yesi enviously, they suddenly saw the man’s dark eyes lit up as he looked in a certain direction. His sexy thin lips curled up, and a gentle smile appeared in his eyes.

This smile was so beautiful.

The female employees were confused.

Damn, men could look so good when they smiled.

He was devastatingly beautiful.

Following Mo Yesi’s gaze, they immediately understood when they saw Qiao Mianmian walking over in a huge down jacket.

No wonder the iceberg melted instantly.

He saw the person he liked.

It turned out that a cold man like Mo Yesi had such a gentle and loving side when he saw the woman he liked.

And this gentleness only belonged to one person.

The female employees looked at Qiao Mianmian with envy.

This exclusive gentleness was too romantic and blissful.

As cold as ice a second ago, the man now walked towards her with an affectionate smile.

Qiao Mianmian had just reached Mo Yesi when he pulled her into his arms, then opened his coat and wrapped her in it.

Qiao Mianmian was instantly enveloped by his warmth.

“Are you cold?” Mo Yesi asked gently.

“No.” Qiao Mianmian raised her gloved hands and touched her scarf. “I’m fully armed today, I’m not cold at all.”

“Mm, it’s snowing.” Mo Yesi smiled. “I thought about it. This weather is very suitable for hot pot.”
