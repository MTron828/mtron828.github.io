Chapter 1773: The Big-Headed Tiger Insisted

Qiao Mianmian had some understanding of Zhan Bo’s personality now.

Thus, she wasn’t polite when she rejected him directly. “It’s alright. I’m afraid to give you another chance. I lost twice in a row. It wasn’t easy for me to get to diamond, I don’t want to drop all the way to gold.”

Zhan Bo’s lips twitched. “Do you have so little confidence in me?”

Qiao Mianmian sighed and turned to look at him seriously. “What do you think, don’t you know how you played in those two rounds?”

Zhan Bo: “...”

He thought about his 1-5-9, 2-10-10 [1. Kills-Assists-Deaths] battle results, and his less than 10% damage output in each match and fell silent.

His performance in those two rounds was indeed...

He wanted to tell Qiao Mianmian that those two rounds were accidents and that he was targeted.

If he was given another chance, he would definitely be able to turn the tables!

But Qiao Mianmian was obviously unwilling to give him the chance to prove himself.

He didn’t succeed in carrying her and was even ridiculed. Zhan Bo sighed and logged out of the game.

“Qiao Mianmian, this is your first time participating in such a show, right?” Zhan Bo hadn’t interacted with her for long, only for two games. But even so, his impression of Qiao Mianmian was already pretty good.

He felt that this girl was rather cute.

Completely different from the rumors about her online.

Although Zhan Bo was young, he had entered the industry a few years earlier than Qiao Mianmian.

His eyes were sharp. He could already tell a person’s nature. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Qiao Mianmian’s eyes were clear and clean.

This was a pair of eyes that had never been polluted. Someone scheming and incapable wouldn’t have such a pair of clear eyes.

And Zhan Bo was from this industry.

Hence, it was clear that most of the news was fake.

There were many unscrupulous media outlets now.

In order to attract people’s attention and gain more traffic, they could turn black into white. There were many times where they created rumors and slandered others.

But under normal circumstances, if things didn’t blow up, the artistes wouldn’t want to argue with them.

After all, being too calculative in this industry would make others feel that you weren’t easy to get along with. If anything happened in the future, the media would definitely punish you.

“Mm, this is my first time participating. What about you?” Qiao Mianmian felt that Zhan Bo was a sunny boy, very similar to Qiao Chen.

She heard that Zhan Bo entered the entertainment industry at the age of 14.

Back then, he studied and worked.

Although Zhan Bo had been in the industry for almost five years and could be considered Qiao Mianmian’s senior, the current Zhan Bo was actually a few months younger than Qiao Mianmian.

“It’s my first time participating, too.” Zhan Bo pursed his lips. He first looked around and saw that there were no cameras around them, then lowered his voice and said, “I heard that this episode’s guests will be badly tortured by the production crew. I didn’t want to participate initially, but the big-headed tiger insisted.”

Big-headed tiger?

Qiao Mianmian was stunned for a few seconds before realizing he was referring to his manager.

His manager was called Li Hu, a fat uncle.

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.
