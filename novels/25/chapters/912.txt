Chapter 913: Was She Out of Her Mind?

Although he looked calm on the surface, he was actually a little nervous.

It was just that he never showed his true emotions.

At the mention of that night, he hesitated for a while. He first looked at Jiang Luoli’s reaction and didn’t feel that she was against this topic. Then, he continued gently, “I’m very sorry. The situation was special back then, and I did something irrational.

“Although I know it’s meaningless to say this now, I still want to apologize to you in person.”

That night was her first time.

The first time was very important to girls.

But he still wanted her under such circumstances. Even if he made it up to her afterward, he still felt like he owed her.

She definitely wanted to do that with the person she liked.

And to her, he was just a stranger.

This was why he decided to see her in the end.

He couldn’t take her and not even let her know what the person she did it with looked like.

This was too much.

Jiang Luoli looked up in surprise.

Mo Shixiu’s eyes were gentle. “Miss Jiang, I still have to apologize to you for the way I compensated you previously. That was the worst decision I made. It was also the first time I encountered such a thing. I was a little confused at that time and didn’t think about it rationally, so I got Assistant Xu to look for you.

“I regretted it when I calmed down.”

“You’re a good girl. That’s an insult to you. I hope you can accept my apology and let me make it up to you again, alright?”

Jiang Luoli looked into his warm and sincere eyes and said without thinking, “I don’t think that’s an insult. You don’t have to feel sorry for me. And speaking of which, I should actually make it up to you. After all, I’ve always wanted to sleep with you. I...”

Mo Shixiu had just picked up the coffee on the table when his hand trembled, and the coffee almost spilled out.

He looked at Jiang Luoli in shock. “Miss Jiang, you...”

Jiang Luoli suddenly realized something.

When she realized what she’d said, she was stunned.

“No, Mr. Mo, I...” She hurriedly explained, her face burning up. “I didn’t mean that. I meant that you don’t have to feel sorry for me. That night... that night, you didn’t force me. I-I did it willingly.”

Damn it.

Was she out of her mind?

What did she say?

She actually said what she was thinking.

Ahhh, she wanted to dig a hole and hide.

How embarrassing.

Mo Shixiu must have heard everything. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

He must have heard it. Otherwise, why would he have such an expression?

Jiang Luoli’s face was getting warmer and warmer. She felt like she was trying to cover it up.

She felt like her brain couldn’t function properly the moment she saw Mo Shixiu.

She had no idea what she was talking about.

She was in a daze.

Mo Shixiu looked at her in shock for a while and saw her lower and lower her head...

It was as if she wanted to bury herself.
