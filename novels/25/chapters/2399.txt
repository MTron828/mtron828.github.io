Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“You treated me to a few meals.” Qiao Chen pursed his lips as he recalled the past, and a gentle smile appeared in his eyes. “I remember you asking the waiter to get you a cappuccino every time.” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Shen Xin’s heart raced when she saw the smile in his eyes.

She bit her lip, her eyes filled with disbelief. “So, y-you’ve been paying attention to me since a long time ago?”

“Mm.”

Qiao Chen nodded calmly. “To be precise, when you first confessed that you liked me, I started paying attention to you.”

Shen Xin was completely stunned.

He had been paying attention to her since then?

But she thought he wasn’t interested in her at all.

“Shen Xin.” Qiao Chen’s gaze was fixed on the girl sitting opposite him, and his eyes were apologetic. “I’m sorry. I rejected you because I felt that it was impossible between us from the start. I didn’t want you to have any fantasies, so… I deliberately treated you coldly.

“I thought that you wouldn’t be interested in me anymore after what I did to you. Actually, I know very well how good you are to me. It’s just that I didn’t have money or power, and I was ill back then. I didn’t dare to hope for anything.

“I don’t have the right to expect anything.

“You’re very good, you shouldn’t be delayed by someone like me. Moreover, our social classes were too different, and many of our concepts were different. Your casual meal, a piece of clothing, a pair of shoes, and even the money for a hairdo might be my annual living expenses.

“If we really got together, what could I have done for you? Perhaps I couldn’t even afford to treat you to a meal at a high-end restaurant.

“Soon, you’d feel that it was meaningless to be with a poor guy like me.”

“No, Qiao Chen, I…”

“Shen Xin, let me finish.” Qiao Chen smiled at her. “I believe you really like me. But have you heard of this saying? Reality defeats love. Your love for me can’t compare to reality.”

“I…” Shen Xin opened her mouth to deny it.

If she despised him for being poor, she wouldn’t have liked him.

“Shen Xin, let me ask you, why did you chase me back then? What part of me did you like? Or rather, what part of me attracted you?” Qiao Chen still had a smile on his face as he asked softly.

Shen Xin was stunned.

What did she like about Qiao Chen?

She looked at the young man’s exquisite face and suddenly blushed. She bit her lip and said a little embarrassedly, “Do you want to tell the truth?”

“Of course.”

“Alright.” Shen Xin pursed her lips and touched her slightly hot cheeks. “I chased you back then because… because I thought you were very good-looking.”

She was so superficial!

Back then, Qiao Chen was just a poor boy, and Shen Xin wasn’t short of money. The only thing that could attract her was his looks.

She fell in love with Qiao Chen’s looks at first sight.

At that time, she thought that such a good-looking guy must be her boyfriend.

She thought it was a simple matter.

She, Shen Xin, was good-looking, had a good family background, and excelled in her studies.. If she pursued him, she thought that no guy would reject her.
