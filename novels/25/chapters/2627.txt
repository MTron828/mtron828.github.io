Chapter 2630: As if She’d Been Hit in the Head

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Many people think that MR.S might be a fictional person. Hence, he slowly became a legend.

“But now, the legendary person has appeared again. Since you’re wearing his design, it means that this person really exists. But you said that the jewelry was given to you by Mr. Mo, and you don’t know anything. It seems like the only person who knows about MR.S’s whereabouts is Mr. Mo.”

“Perhaps.” Qiao Mianmian slowly recovered from her shock. Although she still had many questions, she decided to ask Mo Yesi after the party ended.

“Then, can you tell us what’s the situation with MR.S?” The reporter finally asked.

“Well, I don’t know what exactly is going on, so I can’t promise you on his behalf. But I’ll relay your words and ask for his opinion. If he thinks it’s alright, I’m willing to tell everyone.

“The event is starting, please make way.”

…

In the venue.

Scrolling through Weibo, Song Fei saw the post telling what Qiao Mianmian was wearing tonight.

After reading the post, Song Fei felt awful.

She’d been so proud of herself and thought that she’d won, but now she felt like she’d been hit in the head.

It was a hard blow.

It almost knocked her unconscious.

She opened her eyes wide and read the post over and over again.

She read every word carefully.

After confirming that she hadn’t read wrong, her expression darkened.

She stared at the cell phone screen as if she wanted to bore a hole in it.

How was that possible?

Was that dress really designed by Aaron Smith?

Was the jewelry she was wearing really designed by MR.S?

How was that possible?

Not to mention Aaron Smith, but the legendary MR.S? He had disappeared for a long time. Had he ever designed jewelry for anyone?

Why did he appear again…

He even designed such a beautiful piece of blue diamond jewelry for Qiao Mianmian.

Previously, Song Fei was so proud of herself that she thought she had the upper hand. But now, it seemed like she was no longer popular.

All her sense of superiority vanished.

Song Fei was like a balloon that had deflated after being poked by a needle.

She thought that she would be the most popular one tonight.

The same as the previous times.

If it wasn’t for Qiao Mianmian…

Just a moment ago, she was still on the top trending topics on Weibo.

# Song Fei and the Most Beautiful Encounter #

# Golden Globe Awards for Best Dress Song Fei #

# Song Fei is elegant and charming #

She made it to a few trending searches with her C brand dress. Even big shots like Shen Fei were outshone by her. No one could surpass her popularity, and she became the talk of the town. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

But the moment Qiao Mianmian appeared… the trend on Weibo immediately changed.

Song Fei, the so-called “queen of topics”, was quickly replaced by Qiao Mianmian in less than ten minutes.

All the topics about her were replaced by topics talking about Qiao Mianmian.
