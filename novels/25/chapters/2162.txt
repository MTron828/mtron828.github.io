Chapter 2163: Is This Alright?

“I want a goodnight kiss.” Jiang Luoli looked up at him.

Mo Shixiu smiled and kissed her on the forehead. “Good night.”

“Not there.” Jiang Luoli bit her lip. “Here. I want a goodnight kiss like this.”

She pouted.

Mo Shixiu was stunned. He looked at the girl’s red lips and smiled affectionately. He lowered his head and kissed her gently.

This kiss lasted for more than 10 seconds.

When they separated, Jiang Luoli’s face was red.

She was the one who initiated the kiss, but she was acting like a shy little girl now.

But that kiss… felt really good.

What a gentle kiss.

Jiang Luoli liked the gentleness and love that Mo Shixiu showed when he kissed her. She could feel that he loved her very much.

Although most of the time, she was the one who took the initiative when it came to their intimacy, as long as she asked, Mo Shixiu would satisfy all her requests.

Like a goodnight kiss every night.

Jiang Luoli felt that since they were already married and she intended to benefit from him, it was necessary to cultivate their relationship.

She didn’t like the way they got along.

Mo Shixiu fulfilled all her requirements. She was married to him and was pregnant with his child. If nothing went wrong, they would be together for the rest of their lives.

Even so, Jiang Luoli couldn’t possibly be husband and wife with this man.

She wanted to be a real couple with him.

She wanted them to live together sweetly.

Jiang Luoli was the kind of person who would work hard for a goal.

Mo Shixiu was more reserved. She couldn’t count on him to take the initiative.

Hence, she took the initiative.

Thankfully, although Mo Shixiu wasn’t proactive, he was very cooperative.

Hence, Jiang Luoli felt that it wasn’t a problem for her to take the initiative.

What they feared the most was the lack of response.

If she was the only one taking the initiative, she probably wouldn’t be able to last much longer.

“Is this alright?” Mo Shixiu asked hoarsely.

“Mm.” Jiang Luoli nodded in satisfaction. “Alright.”

Actually, she wanted more.

But she knew that it was better for her to behave.

She couldn’t put out the fire for Mo Shixiu.

“Mm, then go to sleep.” Mo Shixiu stroked her head. “Have a good dream.”

“Sure.” Jiang Luoli hugged his neck and exerted force on her arm. When Mo Shixiu lowered his head, she leaned over and kissed him. “Good night to you, too.”

Mo Shixiu saw that she had fallen asleep and turned off the lights.

He lay down beside her and listened to her breathing in the dark. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

About half an hour later.

After confirming that she was asleep, Mo Shixiu gently lifted the blanket and got off the bed.

…

Mo Shixiu walked out of the bedroom and closed the door gently, then walked towards the study on the second floor.

On the way, he bumped into Sister Lin.

“Mister.” Sister Lin went forward. “Are you going to the study? Do you need me to prepare supper for you?”
