Chapter 192: Miss Qiao Is So Capable

Before she could finish speaking, he cut her off too. “You don’t say anything too. This is between me and him.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

The man’s voice wasn’t as gentle as before.

Although he sounded a lot kinder than when he spoke to Yan Shaoqing, Qiao Mianmian still shuddered at the way he spoke.

She was used to his tenderness and was slightly taken aback by this side of him. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

She’d intended to persuade him, but seeing his stone-cold look, she decided not to.

After a moment of silence.

Shen Rou saw that Mo Yesi wasn’t going to leave any room for negotiation. As awful as she felt, she had to persuade Gong Zeli quietly. “Zeli, just admit your mistake to Ah Si. Do you really want to fall out with him over this one incident?”

Gong Zeli bit his lip and then turned around slowly.

His cold gaze landed on Qiao Mianmian. After eyeing her for a few seconds, he smiled. “Miss Qiao is so capable. Your arrival has turned our brotherly relationship of over 10 years so sour. Don’t you feel a sense of achievement?”

Qiao Mianmian widened her eyes.

What... had this got to do with her?

She hadn’t done anything.

“I heard Miss Qiao is still a student? Ha, she’s so young but so capable.”

The moment he said that he saw a wine glass incoming. He quickly evaded it.

The wine glass that could’ve hit him shattered against the glass wall.

The shards fell to the ground.

“Ah!” Shen Rou shrieked.

Gong Zeli looked up at Mo Yesi slowly and in disbelief.

“Scram.” Mo Yesi’s voice was deep and cold as if lined with ice. “Get out of my sight now. Don’t make me do it myself.”

“Ah Si, you...”

Shen Rou still couldn’t believe that he’d hurled a wine glass at Gong Zeli.

Just because of Qiao Mianmian?!

Was that woman that important?

More important than his brother whom he’d known for so many years?

At this point, Shen Rou felt as if she did not know Mo Yesi anymore.

He was different from the person she’d known all along.

Mo Yesi did not look at her. He simply kept his eyes on Gong Zeli as he went on. “You didn’t hear me? Scram.”

Gong Zeli’s expression darkened before he let out a sneer. “Well, very well. Mo Yesi, you’re a f**king jerk! Fine, since this woman is more important than anyone else, then take it that we’ve known each other in vain. You don’t need brothers anymore. You just need your woman for the rest of your life.”

Once he was done, he stormed out.

“Zeli, hold up...”

Shen Rou looked deeply at Mo Yesi, let out a sigh, and then chased up.

Yan Shaoqing sighed as well. He was tired of all that had happened.

Well, what he feared most finally happened.

...

Leaving the clubhouse.

“Second Bro, I don’t know what’s wrong with Fourth Bro today too. But you know that he’s always been rather erratic and would lose his temper for no reason sometimes. Just think of him as having a midlife crisis, don’t stoop to his level.

“Once he’s cooled down, he’d definitely recognize his faults and apologize to you.

“I’ll talk to him too. And Sis-in-law, let me apologize to you on Fourth Bro’s behalf.”
