Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Qiao Mianmian couldn’t refuse further, so she nodded and turned to walk out with Mother Su.

Qiao Anxin saw this scene and was fuming with rage.

What was so good about this little bitch Qiao Mianmian?

Why did Mother Su like her so much?

Seeing Mother Su’s attitude towards Qiao Mianmian and then comparing it to her own treatment, Qiao Anxin’s blood boiled and she was foaming at the mouth.

She had already told them about her pregnancy.

She thought that Mother Su would compromise now that she had the Su family’s blood in her belly.

Unexpectedly, that damn old thing still disagreed to her marrying Su Ze, and even said she would only acknowledge Qiao Mianmian as her daughter-in-law.

“Brother Ah Ze, did I do something wrong?”

Squeezing her fingers and looking down, Qiao Anxin quickly concealed her resentful eyes. When she looked up again, she was delicate and lovely again.

Su Ze couldn’t help feeling anxious when he saw Qiao Mianmian leaving.

Looking down at her, he said perfunctorily, “What did you do wrong?”

Qiao Anxin bit her lip, and a layer of mist formed in her eyes. “Auntie likes my sister very much. She only wants her as her daughter-in-law. Maybe I shouldn’t have gotten involved between you and Sister. If it wasn’t because of me, you and Sister would be getting married soon.

“Auntie will only be satisfied if you marry my sister.”

“Don’t overthink it. Mom just can’t accept our affair for now. With her grandson in your belly, she’ll accept you sooner or later.”

Qiao Mianmian had gone farther and farther and was even about to walk out of the hall.

Su Ze couldn’t bear it anymore and stood up abruptly.

“Brother Ah Ze, you...” Qiao Anxin stared at him in surprise.

“Wait for me here, I’ll go and see.”

Without any further explanation, he stepped forward to chase after her.

Sitting on the sofa, Qiao Anxin was stunned for a few seconds. When she realized that Su Ze was chasing after Qiao Mianmian, her expression turned ugly.

...

“Mianmian, don’t worry, I won’t agree to Ah Ze being together with your sister.”

After sending her to the gate, Mother Su looked at her reluctantly, holding her hand and not letting go.

Her eyes were full of regret, and she said with reddened eyes, “I really want to crack open that bastard’s head and see what’s in his mind. You’re so good, how could he...”

“Auntie, don’t be sad.” Qiao Mianmian didn’t know what to say.

She turned and glanced out the door towards the black Rolls Royce, still parked under a Wutong tree across the road.

Thinking of the two men waiting for her in the car, she was silent for a while, before sighing softly. “Auntie, I’m leaving.”

Mother Su was reluctant but didn’t keep her.

She nodded with red eyes and said in a choking voice, “Take good care of yourself, and tell me if you face any difficulties. Although you and Ah Ze have broken up, you’ll never be an outsider in my eyes.”

Qiao Mianmian’s eyes flashed red. “Okay, I know.”

Mother Su was really good to her.

If Su Ze hadn’t cheated on her, and if they had really gotten married, she would have been incredibly blissful to have a mother-in-law like Mother Su.

What a pity...

It was impossible for her to have such a relationship with Mother Su now.

Qiao Mianmian urged Mother Su to take care of her body, before turning to leave.

“Mianmian.”

As soon as she stepped forward, she heard a very distasteful voice call her from behind.
