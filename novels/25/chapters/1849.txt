“You want to do a good job, but I think your sister is a ruthless person. She might not let you off easily.” Song Ke was a little afraid when she thought of how Qiao Mianmian had smashed Third Chen’s face.

Qiao Mianmian was too ruthless.

Song Ke had always been against Qiao Mianmian and was always picking on her.

But now, she was a little afraid.

“Anyway, we shouldn’t offend her so easily.” Little Xiao glanced at Qiao Mianmian. “She has someone to back her up. If we provoke her, her backer might just shut us out with a word. The Su Corporation is such a big corporation, but they just buy it over like that, not to mention small celebrities like us.”

“Who exactly is the man behind her?” Song Ke thought of what her sugar daddy had told her and asked curiously, “Isn’t he just a relative of the Mo family? Why is he so powerful?

“Even if he’s working in the Mo Corporation, he can’t just take over a company as he pleases. The CEO of the Mo Corporation must be the one behind it, right?”

Little Xiao and Qiao Anxin both knew Mo Yesi’s true identity.

The two of them thought, Isn’t he the CEO of the Mo Corporation?!

She didn’t know how the rumors spread online that he had become a relative of the Mo Family.

He was just one of the side family members. How could he have so much power?

How could Gong Zeli, Yan Shaoqing, and all the other young masters from wealthy families stand in line?

But neither of them spoke.

They knew Qiao Mianmian’s backing and didn’t dare to offend her.

Of the few of them, the only one who wasn’t clear was Song Ke.

They needed Song Ke to make things difficult for Qiao Mianmian, but if she knew that Mo Yesi was the CEO of the Mo Corporation, she probably wouldn’t dare to offend Qiao Mianmian anymore.

...

Back in the room.

Qiao Mianmian didn’t sleep much after what happened.

No matter how strong she was mentally, this was the first time she had encountered something like this, and the impact was not light.

She finally managed to get through to the morning. After sleeping for an hour or two, she was woken up by the ringing of her phone.

Qiao Mianmian took out her phone. When she saw that it was Jiang Luoli calling, she remembered what she said yesterday and immediately picked up.

“Hello, Luo Luo. Are the test results out? How is it? Are you pregnant?”

“Baby, it’s not about me. It’s about you.” Jiang Luoli’s voice was full of worry. “I saw the news. Are you okay?”

“News? What news?”

“Didn’t an old bachelor from the village sneak into your room? God, it’s so scary. I was scared to death when I saw the news. How could this happen? What is the production team doing? Can’t they even ensure the safety of the artistes?

“I don’t think you should participate in such a program anymore. Come back quickly.

“You’re so good-looking. I’m worried that you’ll be targeted by some bad guy again. Baby, I’m really worried about you now. Come back quickly.”

Qiao Mianmian was stunned for a few seconds.

But then, she felt that it was normal.

After what happened last night, it would definitely be on the news today.

“Luo Luo, don’t worry. I’m fine.”

“What do you mean ‘fine’?” Jiang Luoli was extremely anxious. “I was scared to death when I saw the news. You were lucky this time. But if there’s a next time... I don’t dare to think about the consequences.”
