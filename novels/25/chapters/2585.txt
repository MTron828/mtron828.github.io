Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

This included many top-notch and capable actors. Not only that, but there were also all sorts of top-notch scriptwriters, producers, directors, and songwriters. It could be said that the most capable people in the entertainment industry were included. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

This group of people’s reposts had a shocking amount of traffic.

Many fans followed suit.

In less than 10 minutes, the announcement was reposted by hundreds of thousands of people.

Qin Han reposted it too.

Moreover, unlike other artistes, he and Zhan Bo posted their own Weibos.

Qin Han: [I’ve said it before, I admire Qiao Mianmian’s acting. She’s a very smart actress. As the person in the show who has the most experience with her acting, I know best her acting skills. It’s more convincing to criticize her for being a big shot and having a bad temper than to criticize her acting. The Golden Globe Awards’ fairness goes without saying. If a Golden Globe Award can be obtained through connections, wouldn’t that be questioning every winner and insulting the judges’ professionalism?]

Zhan Bo: [Who set the rule that newbies can’t be nominated? Who set the rule that those on their first work can’t be nominated? You can’t be thinking that Qiao Mianmian is just a pretty face and doesn’t have any acting skills, right? Not to mention anything else, just based on her gaming skills and ability to fly me, I have to say something for her. I don’t care about other people, but my fans and babies definitely can’t participate in those dirty things. Qiao Mianmian is my master in the game, you support her means you support me.]

Zhan Bo: [Alright, my teammates are still waiting for me to play. That’s it. Be good, everyone. Don’t cause trouble for me.]

Qin Han and Zhan Bo both represented the absolute traffic in the industry.

One was a talent, while the other was top-notch.

Their posts showed their support for Qiao Mianmian.

Especially Qin Han.

He had won a few Best Actor awards.

His evaluation of Qiao Mianmian’s acting was even more convincing.

How could her acting skills not be good?

Moreover, someone said that Qin Han supported Qiao Mianmian because of the power of the Mo and Bai families.

But now…

He was afraid that people would make an issue out of this again, so he added a subtext to show that he wasn’t being forced.

Hence, if anyone wanted to say that Qin Han was forced to speak up for Qiao Mianmian, it wouldn’t make sense.

“LOL, Qin Han’s nickname is hilarious. I’m afraid that some people will use him again.”

“I’m dying of laughter too. Hahahaha. But you can’t blame Qin Han for thinking too much. Didn’t someone say that he had no choice but to side with Qiao Mianmian because he was forced? If he doesn’t make a statement this time, he might really be used as an article.”

“Let’s not comment on Qiao Mianmian’s acting first. I think she’s a good person. But can Qin Han and Zhan Bo be friends with her? Whenever she has something on, Qin Han and Zhan Bo stand up for her. They must be very close in private.”

“Yes, I can tell that Qiao Mianmian has a good relationship with people. Not to mention anything else, her character must be pretty good.”

“My friend is a photographer. He told me that Qiao Mianmian is a very good person, has a good temper, and treats people well. He doesn’t think that she’s superior to others just because she’s a rich missy.. She even knows how to cook.”
