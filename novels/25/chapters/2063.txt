Chapter 2064: Stay by My Side, Alright?

He looked more mature.

But this was probably the case.

No matter how she looked at her husband, he looked the best.

Mo Yesi didn’t hear Qiao Mianmian’s reply. He looked down and met her eyes.

He followed her gaze and couldn’t help but smile.

He sat down beside her and pulled her into his arms. “Baby, do I look good?”

Qiao Mianmian snapped back to her senses.

She felt her face burn as she met his teasing gaze.

She… was smitten with her husband again.

“Ahem, you’re done.”

Qiao Mianmian buried her head in his arms and took a deep breath.

She liked Mo Yesi’s scent, especially since he’d just showered. The faint lemon scent was very pleasant.

“Mm.” Mo Yesi looked at the woman in his arms sniffing him like a puppy and found it funny. “Who were you chatting with just now? You were so engrossed.”

“Chen Chen.”

“Chen Chen? What did you talk about?” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“Mo Yesi, can you help me with something?” Qiao Mianmian looked up.

“Mm?”

“I want you to help me find something, but I’m not sure if you can.”

“What is it?”

Qiao Mianmian thought for a while and said, “I want to find some dirt about Qiao Anxin.”

“Just this?” Mo Yesi raised an eyebrow.

“Mm, that’s it.”

“I thought it was something difficult. This is a simple matter. Is there anything else?”

“Not for now.”

Mo Yesi smiled. “Alright, I’ll get Wei Zheng to investigate it for you. Have you thought about how to deal with Qiao Anxin now? Do you need me to help you with this?”

“I’ll do it myself, I should be able to settle it myself.” Qiao Mianmian rolled her eyes and got up. “If I need your help, I’ll let you know. Your hair is still wet, I’ll get a hairdryer for you.”

Mo Yesi stroked his damp hair and nodded. “Alright.”

A moment later.

Qiao Mianmian blew his hair slowly.

The girl’s soft hand gently stroked his head, and the warm wind blew down. Mo Yesi heard her say softly, “When I wasn’t around, did you dry your hair before sleeping? Remember, you have to dry your hair. You can’t sleep with it wet. Otherwise, you’ll definitely have a headache.”

She reminded him like a child.

Mo Yesi didn’t feel that she was long-winded. Instead, he felt warm inside.

After Qiao Mianmian blew his hair for a while, he suddenly called her. “Mianmian.”

His voice was low and gentle.

“Mm,” Qiao Mianmian responded softly.

Mo Yesi turned around and took the hairdryer from her. He turned it off and placed it on the bedside table before pulling her onto his lap.

He rubbed her head and looked at her. “Stay by my side, alright?”

“Stay with me forever and never leave me.”

Qiao Mianmian was stunned.

“Why are you suddenly talking about this?”

“Promise me first.”

Qiao Mianmian said, “…Mm, I promise you. I’ll be with you forever and never leave you.”

Mo Yesi lifted her chin and kissed her.
