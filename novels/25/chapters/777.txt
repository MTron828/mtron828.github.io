Chapter 778: Meeting Madam Mo

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

It was probably because of her scandal.

When Mo Yesi sent her to the set this morning, Old Madam had called to ask about the scandal.

If Old Madam knew about it, how could Madam Mo not know?

Judging from Madam Mo’s attitude towards her previously, she was probably here to condemn her.

At the hotel.

Qiao Mianmian and Nana got out of the car and entered the elevator. She pressed the floor of the cafe.

“Eh, Sister Mianmian, this isn’t our...”

“Oh, I’m going to meet a friend,” Qiao Mianmian said casually. “You can go back first. It’s the day off today, you can do whatever you want. Don’t bother about me.”

“Alright, then. I’m going out to meet a friend too. I’ll be back later tonight. Sister Mianmian, call me if you need anything. I’ll be back soon.”

“Mm.”

Qiao Mianmian walked out of the elevator first.

The cafe was on the tenth floor.

After exiting the elevator, she saw Madam Mo waiting for her by the window.

Madam Mo was indeed a prestigious madam.

The elegance and classiness that she had nurtured since young was clearly different from ordinary people.

Qiao Mianmian saw her right away.

Her sitting posture was very elegant, and the way she held the coffee cup was also very classy. Her face was well-maintained, and it was impossible to tell her actual age. At first glance, she was a very attractive young woman.

Many men in the cafe were secretly sizing her up.

But no one dared to approach her.

Madam Mo had a cold temperament and looked like a cold beauty. Most men would be interested in her, but they wouldn’t dare to pursue her easily. Moreover, she didn’t seem like an ordinary rich girl. This alone was enough to make many men flinch.

“Hello, Miss. May I ask...”

“I have an appointment.”

Qiao Mianmian looked at the waiter and quickly walked towards Madam Mo.

As she approached, Madam Mo, who was looking out the window at first, turned around and looked at her.

Her eyes were cold and sharp.

Qiao Mianmian couldn’t help but stop in her tracks.

She hesitated for a few seconds before saying, “Mom...”

Disgust flashed in Madam Mo’s eyes when she heard the way she addressed her. She smiled coldly and pointed to the seat opposite her. “You’re here. Have a seat first.”

Qiao Mianmian didn’t ignore the disgust in Madam Mo’s eyes.

She knew that Madam Mo didn’t like her.

But Qiao Mianmian felt as if her heart had been stabbed by something. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

But she still appeared nonchalant.

She sat down opposite Madam Mo and asked for a cup of coffee from the waiter. She turned to look at Madam Mo and hesitated for a while before deciding to ask, “Mom, why are you looking for me?”

Madam Mo took a sip of her coffee and frowned in disgust.

The coffee here probably wasn’t to her liking.

She took a sip and put it down.

Although this was a five-star hotel, it was considered pretty good for ordinary people.

But in the eyes of a rich madam like Madam Mo, the things here weren’t worthy of her attention.
