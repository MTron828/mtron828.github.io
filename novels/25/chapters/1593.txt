Chapter 1594: I Hope You Can Take the Initiative

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

With Madam Gong’s words, Shangguan Qing had more confidence in herself.

She knew it. How could Gong Zeli not like her?

Every man that Shangguan Qing liked would bow down to her in the end.

Although Gong Zeli was different from the men who supported her previously, he was more handsome, had a higher status, and had a more arrogant personality. But wasn’t it a sense of achievement to conquer such a man?

Besides her, who else could be so compatible with him?

She’d been determined to marry him since she was little.

How could she give up on him so easily?

She was definitely going to be the Young Madam of the Gong Family!

“Qingqing, Zeli has been spoiled by girls since he was little. He’s very proud when it comes to women. He has never taken the initiative to pursue any girl. Even if he meets the girl he likes, he won’t take the initiative.

“So, Auntie hopes that you can take the initiative. As the saying goes, there’s a mountain of difference between a man and a woman. If you can take the initiative, I believe Zeli will be more passionate about you.”

Shangguan Qing bit her lip and said shyly, “B-But I don’t know how to take the initiative. Auntie, I-I’ve never taken the initiative to pursue a guy.”

“It’s not difficult.”

Madam Gong held her hand and taught her gently. “Men all like virtuous women. You can occasionally cook for him and send him to the company. You can often send him messages and call him to show concern. He’ll know how you treat him.”

“Can I do this?” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Of course. He’s my son, don’t I know him well enough? Zeli likes gentle and virtuous women.”

“But I don’t have Brother Zeli’s cell phone number.”

“Auntie will give it to you, and also his WeChat account. This way, it’ll be easier for you to interact with each other in the future. With more interactions and more time to get to know each other, he’ll slowly become warmer towards you.”

Shangguan Qing nodded enthusiastically.

...

On the other side.

Qiao Mianmian and Linda went home early because of Boss Huang.

She received a video call from Mo Yesi the moment she got home.

Qiao Mianmian opened the door, turned on the lights, changed into her slippers, and placed the keys on the shelf.

She clicked on the video as she walked in.

A second later.

An extremely handsome face appeared on the screen. The man’s facial features were well-defined as if they were carved by a knife. He looked so good even without makeup that it made people’s hearts tremble.

Qiao Mianmian walked to the living room and sat on the sofa. She grabbed a pillow and hugged it, leaning lazily against a corner.

“Just got home?” Mo Yesi asked gently.

“Mm.” Qiao Mianmian reported her schedule for the night. “After work, I invited Sister Xie and Brother to have a meal. Then, Sister Xie and I sang for a while and went home.”

She didn’t tell Mo Yesi about Boss Huang.

Since the matter was already resolved and she wasn’t hurt, Qiao Mianmian didn’t tell him, lest he became worried.

“We should have a meal to celebrate.” Mo Yesi had just taken a shower, and in the video, he was wrapped in a towel. There were still water droplets on his body, and he was drying his hair with a towel.
