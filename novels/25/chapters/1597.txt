Chapter 1598: Can’t Be Affected Because of Him

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

If it was just Qiao Mianmian’s own scandals, she wouldn’t care too much.

After all, this wasn’t the first time she’d been defamed.

But with Gong Zeli involved and many people misunderstanding him, she couldn’t sit back and do nothing.

Especially when she saw the Weibo posts about Gong Zeli being sick and bullying others, Qiao Mianmian felt that she had to clarify this matter.

She told Linda about it.

Linda was there last night too, so she knew the truth.

“We have to clarify this matter. Otherwise, someone will definitely make an issue out of it. It won’t have a good impact on you and Young Master Gong. How about this, let the Public Relations Department handle this. Huan Yu will post on Weibo to clarify.”

“Don’t you need me to do anything?”

“Not for now. Wait for the company’s post.”

“Alright.”

Linda said she could settle it, so Qiao Mianmian didn’t harp on it.

...

Gong Zeli saw the news too.

In the luxurious office.

Gong Zeli leaned against the black leather chair and narrowed his eyes. After listening to his assistant’s report, his eyes turned cold.

The assistant said, “Chairman Gong, should we get the public relations department to settle this? If the public opinion continues to spread, it will affect you.”

The man’s handsome face was nonchalant as he scoffed. “Affect, affect what?”

“Someone on Weibo is trying to frame you. If we don’t explain it, it’ll affect your reputation. Moreover...”

Gong Zeli looked up. “Moreover what?”

“It will affect the lady with you.”

Gong Zeli’s expression changed slightly.

He never thought of giving the public an explanation, but now...

If this would affect Qiao Mianmian, he had to reconsider.

He didn’t care what others thought of him.

But Qiao Mianmian was an artiste.

She was a public figure, her image couldn’t be affected.

She couldn’t be affected by him.

After a moment of silence, Gong Zeli changed his mind. “Then, let the public relations department handle it.”

“Yes, Chairman Gong. I’ll get it done right away.”

The assistant left quickly.

Gong Zeli took out his cell phone and checked Weibo. When he saw the comments about his ambiguous relationship with Qiao Mianmian, he pursed his lips and read them a few times.

His intention was to help her.

But he seemed to have brought her trouble. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

He didn’t care what others said about him, but he didn’t want others to say anything bad about her.

Her cell phone rang.

Gong Zeli picked it up a few seconds later.

“Fourth Bro, what happened on Weibo? Did you hit someone?”

Gong Zeli guessed that Yan Shaoqing was calling because of this. “Mm, it’s what you saw.”

“You were with Sis-in-law last night?”

“I went over to discuss something. I didn’t know she was there.”

“Weibo said that you hit someone because of Sis-in-law. Is that true?”

“Mm, a jerk was bullying her. I couldn’t sit back and do nothing.”

“Which jerk? Boss Huang?”

“Mm.”

“Damn, did that old thing eat a bear’s heart and leopard’s guts? He actually dared to bully Sis-in-law. Good beating. I wasn’t there. If I was, I’d have given that old thing a good beating too.

“But...” Yan Shaoqing changed the topic
