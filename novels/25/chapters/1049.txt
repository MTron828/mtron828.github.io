Chapter 1050: Make Her as Happy as Possible

The man ignored her and continued walking.

They went back to his car.

Mo Yesi rolled up the window, opened a tube of medicine, and carefully applied it on her face.

“Ouch.” His actions were gentle enough, but Qiao Mianmian still frowned in pain.

Mo Yesi immediately stopped and asked nervously, “Did I hurt you?”

“Thankfully, it doesn’t hurt so much now.”

The moment the ointment was applied, it hurt a little. But soon, Qiao Mianmian felt that her face was cold and the pain eased a lot.

“Then, I’ll continue?”

“Mm.”

Mo Yesi picked up the cotton swab and continued to wipe the red and swollen areas on her face. He was even more gentle and careful with his actions.

It was as if he was treating a precious gem. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

His eyes were full of love.

After applying the ointment, he cupped her face again and said, “The swelling should subside tomorrow. I’ll do it again before you sleep.”

“Mm.” Qiao Mianmian nodded. She smiled and said casually, “I’m not in pain anymore. This medicine is cool and comfortable.”

Mo Yesi looked at her silently.

“Alright, alright. I’m really fine now. Let’s go eat, alright? It’s already so late, aren’t you hungry?”

“Mm, let’s go eat.” Mo Yesi kept quiet for a few more seconds before rubbing her head. “After we’re done eating, do you want to watch a movie? Or do you want to do something else? Anyway, no matter what you want to do, I’ll accompany you.”

“Watch a movie?” Qiao Mianmian thought for a while and nodded. “Mm, then I’ll pick a good movie later. We’ll watch it after dinner.”

Some overseas blockbusters were rather popular recently.

Qiao Mianmian thought that she could go with Mo Yesi later.

“Besides watching a movie?” Mo Yesi was silent for a while before saying, “Do you want to do something else?”

He wanted to have a good date with Qiao Mianmian.

But besides eating, watching movies, and shopping, he didn’t know how to date.

He looked it up online. It seemed like this was how ordinary people usually went on dates.

But he felt that it was too boring for her to eat, watch movies, and shop every time.

She was still young and romantic.

He was afraid that she would feel too bored with him.

He didn’t know how boys her age would date girls.

He was six years older than her.

Although he wasn’t that old, he was much older than her.

He was afraid of the generation gap between them.

He wanted to make her happy as much as possible.

So that she would feel that being with him was a wonderful thing.

“Other things?” Qiao Mianmian was stunned. She thought for a while and shook her head. “I haven’t thought about it yet. Do you not want to watch a movie, or do you want to do something else? Actually, I don’t have to watch a movie.”

“No.” Mo Yesi pursed his lips and sighed. “I’ll do as you wish. I’ll do whatever you like. Mianmian, I’m afraid you’ll feel bored. Do you find it boring to go on a date with me?”

“How could that be?”
