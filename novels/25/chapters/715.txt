Chapter 716: We’ve Been Looking for Her

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

She didn’t feel repulsed or disgusted.

Instead, it felt warm.

Although she didn’t have a brother, that was how she felt at that moment.

After hearing Bai Yusheng’s explanation, she felt as if a huge burden had been lifted off her shoulders.

No matter what, Bai Yusheng was a director she admired.

She didn’t want to alienate him because of some things.

“Director Bai...”

“If you don’t mind, you can call me Big Brother Bai in private.” Bai Yusheng looked at the girl beside him and said, “I’ll be happier if you call me that.”

Qiao Mianmian’s heart warmed up again when she met his gaze. She hesitated for a while before asking softly, “Brother... Bai?”

Bai Yusheng smiled. “Hearing you call me that makes me feel like an older brother. If my sister hadn’t been separated from us, she would be around your age now.”

He looked a little regretful as he said, “I wonder how she’s doing now. Does she have a good life? Does her family treat her well? Did she grow up happily? Sigh, if she’s doing well, I’ll feel much better. If she’s not doing well...”

“Don’t worry, Brother Bai. I think she must be living a blissful life.” Qiao Mianmian felt that Bai Yusheng was a little down and comforted him. “You might be able to see her again someday.”

“I hope so.” Bai Yusheng sighed. “Actually, we’ve been looking for her all these years. It’s just that the family that adopted her seemed to have hidden their identities. They’re no longer living in the same place.

“We searched for her for so many years, but we still couldn’t find her.

“But no matter how long we have to search, we won’t give up. I have a feeling that my sister will come home one day. Our family will definitely be reunited someday.”

“Mm, of course.”

Qiao Mianmian was actually very curious about how her sister had broken up with them.

But thinking about it, if it wasn’t under special circumstances, how could the family be forced to separate?

Hence, it must be an unspeakable reason.

At least, he couldn’t tell an outsider like her.

No matter how curious she was, she couldn’t ask.

“I have a picture of my sister when she was younger.” Bai Yusheng narrowed his eyes as if he was recalling something. “My mom took it for her when she was just born. Speaking of which, you look a little like my sister.”

Qiao Mianmian was stunned. “I look like your sister?”

Bai Yusheng looked at her and nodded. “Mm, your eyes and nose are alike.

“My sister has been a beauty since she was a child. My mom said that she’s especially beautiful. You two are too different in age, so even if you look alike, there are many differences. But I feel that she’ll definitely look like you when she grows up.”

“Big Brother Bai, I believe your family can be reunited!”

“I hope so.” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Bai Yusheng turned to look out the window. “If we can’t meet again, I hope that she can live a happy life in this lifetime. It doesn’t matter if she’s rich or poor, as long as she’s happy.”

Bai Yusheng felt his cell phone vibrate again.

He looked down and finally replied.

The other party replied instantly: [How is she now? Did you send her back to the hotel safely?]

Bai Yusheng wanted to roll his eyes.
