Chapter 996: You Can Do Anything With Me

“Only you know if you’re sleeping or not.”

Madam Mo hadn’t thought so much.

But after hearing what Shen Rou said, she was instantly unhappy with Qiao Mianmian.

She felt that Qiao Mianmian did it on purpose.

Knowing that she was here, she hid inside on purpose.

She was getting increasingly dissatisfied with how arrogant and disrespectful her daughter-in-law was.

She knew that nothing good would come from a small family.

It was either a good match or a bad match.

If her daughter-in-law was Rourou, she wouldn’t be so dissatisfied. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

The outstanding son she’d raised was taken away by this woman. How hateful.

Mo Yesi frowned. “Mom, you...”

“Mom, I was really sleeping.” Qiao Mianmian grabbed Mo Yesi’s arm tightly and looked up at him with a “don’t be impatient” look. She then smiled and said to Madam Mo, “I was waiting for Ah Si to have dinner together. He can’t accompany me when he’s busy with work, and I didn’t want to affect him. So, I went in for a nap.

“I really didn’t know you were here. I only found out when he woke me up.

“If I made Mom uncomfortable, I’ll apologize to you.”

Madam Mo opened her mouth, but before she could say anything, Mo Yesi said coldly, “What are you apologizing for, you didn’t do it on purpose. What’s wrong with this time, why can’t we sleep? Who made the rule about when we have to sleep?

“You’re the Lady Boss of the Mo Corporation. Even if you find someone to play mahjong in the office, no one would dare to say anything about you, let alone sleep in your own company.”

Shen Rou’s face went pale.

Mo Yesi’s words were directed at her.

This was a slap to her face.

It was bad enough that Mo Yesi didn’t want to give her face, but to be so disrespectful in front of Qiao Mianmian, Shen Rou’s face turned pale.

Qiao Mianmian was very satisfied with her husband’s strong support.

She said cooperatively, “Can I really get someone to share a table in your office?”

Mo Yesi lowered his head and didn’t care about what Madam Mo and Shen Rou thought. “Of course you can. I’ve said it before, you can do whatever you want with me.”

“Hubby, you’re so nice. Thank you for being so nice to me. I’m really happy and satisfied to be your wife.” Qiao Mianmian glanced at Madam Mo and Shen Rou’s dark expressions and felt that she could work harder to make them feel even worse.

She understood it, anyway.

Madam Mo’s hatred for her was already ingrained.

No matter what she said or did, this wouldn’t change.

Hence, she couldn’t be bothered to try to get on his good side.

All she had to do was to do what was on the surface.

This was also to make things difficult for Mo Yesi.

No matter how much she disliked Madam Mo, she was still Mo Yesi’s biological mother.

This relationship would never change.

She couldn’t possibly let Mo Yesi abandon his own mother for her.

Mo Yesi had already seen through her intentions, but he didn’t expose her. His handsome face was full of indulgence as he stroked her head cooperatively. “I’m very happy and satisfied to be able to marry you and be your husband.”
