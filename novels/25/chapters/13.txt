Chapter 14: I Want a Wife

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Mo Yesi raised her hand and interrupted her.

“Since Ms. Qiao has come to me, you should know that I haven’t done an operation in many years.”

“I know.” Qiao Mianmian nodded. “But I believe that Mr. Mo is a good man and will never let an innocent man die.”

“A good guy?”

Mo Yesi seemed to have heard something interesting and laughed.

He put down the document in his hand, stood up, and slowly walked towards Qiao Mianmian.

He stopped in front of her.

Qiao Mianmian found out now that this man was also very in shape. He was very tall, about 1.88 meters.

Because she was 1.68 meters—which was not a short height for women—standing in front of him she was barely at his neck.

She had to raise her head to look at him.

They were standing too close.

The clear smell of the man’s body drifted to her nose, full of attractive male hormones. Qiao Mianmian stared at him with a flushed face, her heart beating fast.

She couldn’t help taking a step back.

Blushing and biting her lip, she said, “Mr. Mo...”

“Ms. Qiao, I’m a businessman.” Mo Yesi stared at her with thin lips. “Let’s talk business. Since Ms. Qiao wants me to help you, what benefit can you give me?”

Qiao Mianmian hesitated.

Benefit?

He looked like a person who had everything. What benefits could she possibly give him?

“Mr. Mo, I don’t know what you want...”

Mo Yesi looked at her tender and lovely face and said one word at a time with certainty, “What if I want a wife? Will Ms. Qiao be willing?”

“What?!” Qiao Mianmian looked up in shock.

Mo Yesi looked calm and said lightly, “There is no free lunch in the world. Ms. Qiao, I can agree to your request to help to perform the operation on your brother. However, you must marry me.”

This time, Qiao Mianmian was sure she didn’t hear anything wrong.

She was too shocked to react.

In any case, she had never expected that his request would be to marry him.

This was too... ridiculous.

She couldn’t believe it. “Mr. Mo, are you serious?”

Mo Yesi raised an eyebrow and asked, “Do you think I’m joking?”

“Why?”

He had such good qualifications, couldn’t he find a wife?

He actually wanted to marry a woman that he met for the first time?

Or was there anything inexplicable about him?

She stared involuntarily at him.

Mo Yesi noticed that and, after guessing what she was thinking, frowned, his expression turning dark for a moment.

Then, he was amused again and pulled her over in a good mood. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Ah!” Qiao Mianmian bumped into his arms, her head hitting his warm and strong chest. She felt like she had hit a rock and her nose even turned red.

Before responding, her hand was pulled and moved downwards.

Above her head, his sexy low voice was full of amusement. “Ms. Qiao, you don’t have to worry about being a grass widow when we get married. You can now check if I am normal.”

Qiao Mianmian blushed and shoved him away.

“Mr. Mo, please, please respect yourself!”

She didn’t expect this man, who seemed cold and abstinent, to play hooligan with her.

Mo Yesi looked at her flushed face and his eyes deepened.

She seemed to love blushing, and it had been the same last night. She had cried for mercy with her white skin turning an alluring pink color.
