“When we reached the temple, Madam said that the accomplished monk doesn’t see outsiders, so we need to hand Little Miss over to him. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“How would Eldest Young Madam know that Madam would actually hand her own granddaughter over to an outsider to be taken away? Eldest Young Madam waited for a long time, but Little Miss did not come out. She barged in without caring about anyone, only to realize that the so-called accomplished

monk and Little Miss were no longer around.”

“Madam is really muddle-headed.” Even Uncle Zhang felt that Madam Mo was crazy to do such a thing.

She was Little Miss’s biological grandmother.

It wasn’t easy for the Mo Family to have new blood, and everyone doted on her like a treasure. They couldn’t even dote on her enough, but who would have thought that a biological grandmother would be so ruthless as to give her own granddaughter to someone else?

Even though Madam and Young Madam did have a conflict, and everyone in the family knew about this, however, even if Madam had something against Young Madam, she couldn’t do that.

Little Miss was of the Mo Family’s bloodline!

If she wasn’t crazy, how could she do such a thing?

Old Madam fainted from anger.

Young Madam cried so hard that she almost fainted. Her eyes were so swollen that anyone who saw them would feel heartache.

Now, the Eldest Young Master had personally gone after the “accomplished monk’.

“Isn’t she worried that the bad guys will hurt Little Miss?

“Little Miss is her biological granddaughter!”

Mo Yesi pursed his lips tightly and did not say anything, but he knew what to do.

It wasn’t hard to guess who could make Madam Mo do such a stupid thing.

“sister-in-law, don’t worry. Big Brother will definitely find Yueyue.” After finding out the reason, Mo Yesi turned around and walked towards the still crying Qiao Mianmian and Jiang Luoli.

Among the crowd, he was the only one who was calm. “The person who took Yueyue away shouldn’t hurt her.”

Upon hearing his voice, Jiang Luoli looked as if she had seen her savior. She rushed to Mo Yesi and gripped his arm tightly. “Prince Charming, you said that the person who took Yueyue away wouldn’t hurt her. Is that true? Did you find out something?

“Why did that monk take Yueyue away? Who is he?

“Where is Yueyue now? Is she safe?

“Prince Charming, you’ve always been very capable. I believe everything you say.. Nothing will happen to Yueyue, you’ll definitely be able to get her back, right?”
