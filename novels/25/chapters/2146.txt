Chapter 2148: Which Goddess Sang This Song?

If it wasn’t for Qiao Anxin, he wouldn’t have broken up with Qiao Mianmian.

If they hadn’t broken up, Qiao Mianmian wouldn’t have had the chance to meet Mo Yesi.

It was all because of Qiao Anxin.

The more Su Ze thought about it, the angrier he got. But thinking about how Qiao Anxin could let him do whatever he wanted when she went overseas, he felt better.

He had just taken over an entertainment company and needed to sign some artistes.

He originally thought that Qiao Anxin wasn’t bad and wanted to groom her.

Qiao Anxin didn’t have much value now, but she was still useful.

He could still earn some money by making a few films overseas.

They chatted for a while before leaving.

As they were leaving, Qiao Anxin suddenly asked, “Su Ze, are you willing?”

Su Ze stopped in his tracks and looked at her. “What do you mean?”

“Are you willing to see Qiao Mianmian marry another man? Su Ze, you still love her, right? I mean, with Qiao Mianmian’s current status, she’s very likely to marry Mo Yesi. If you hesitate any longer, she’ll really become someone else’s wife.

“It’ll be too late, then.”

Qiao Anxin pretended not to know that Qiao Mianmian and Mo Yesi were already married.

She couldn’t do anything to her now.

But she didn’t want that slut to live too comfortably.

Su Ze’s expression changed slightly as he pursed his lips.

Qiao Anxin didn’t say anything else.

Some words were enough.

…

The two songs that Qiao Mianmian recorded at Mo Nan’s place were quickly produced.

Bai Yusheng got someone to post one of the songs on Weibo.

He didn’t say who sang it, just that it was an interlude song in the drama.

The drama’s official Weibo account posted the song.

Half an hour later.

The post exploded.

That Weibo post had tens of thousands of comments and reposts in just half an hour.

The comment section exploded.

“Wow, it’s so nice. I love this voice.”

“Damn, heavenly music? Is this a show? It’s so nice.”

“It’s the voice I like. It’s so clean and ethereal. This song’s lyrics and melody are also very outstanding. Who sang this song? Why isn’t it indicated? Is it a newbie? The voice doesn’t sound familiar.”

“Why do I feel like this song has Mo Nan’s tune? But Mo Nan is almost in a semi-retired state now and hasn’t produced a song in many years. If it isn’t Mo Nan’s work, then this songwriter is rather impressive to be able to create such a good song.”

“Ahhhh, Mr. Official, which goddess sang this song? Please tell me!!! I want to be her fan!!”

“I haven’t heard such a clean voice in a long time. It’s really nice!” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“Wow, this song is so nice. I’m curious too. Who sang this song? Did the official Weibo account forget to @ the singer?”

“This voice sounds like the queen of the music industry, Zhang Aixin, from 20 years ago. And I think it sounds more ethereal and clear than Zhang Aixin’s voice. Anyway, I like this voice more. Please tell me which singer this is, I want to be a fan too.”

Many in the comment section asked who the singer was.

Because this voice was different from the popular singers they were familiar with.

Some of the new singers who were getting popular didn’t have such a voice.
