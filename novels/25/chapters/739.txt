Chapter 740: She Was Just... Hungry

“Don’t go too far. I’m... preferably closer to here.”

“Alright, get ready now.”

A minute later, he hung up and tossed his cell phone aside. He turned around and pulled Qiao Mianmian into his arms.

“Baby, it’s done. Shall we pack up and head over now?”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

“What did you get someone to do?”

“Looking for a house, buying ingredients, these are all small problems. It’s already done.”

“...”

“You really got someone to look for a house?”

“Otherwise?” The man raised an eyebrow and kissed her on the lips. “Didn’t you say that there’s no place to cook and no ingredients? If you want me to cook for you, you have to prepare the basic facilities, right?”

Qiao Mianmian didn’t expect him to be so efficient.

It was just a phone call, and he’d already found the house.

This... was too easy.

As expected, the world of the rich and ordinary people were two completely different worlds.

It was so easy if one was rich and powerful.

It was easy to do anything.

When Mo Yesi was done with everything and was ready to cook for her, Qiao Mianmian hesitated. “Why don’t we order takeout and do this another day?”

She was rather hungry.

She guessed that by the time Mo Yesi was done with the sweet-and-sour spare ribs, she would have fainted from hunger.

“Don’t you want to eat my sweet-and-sour spare ribs?” Mo Yesi picked her up and carried her to the bathroom. “I promised to make it for you, so I’ll definitely do it. I’ve already gotten someone to prepare it. When we’re done packing up, it’ll definitely be ready.

“I even got someone to buy something else. If you’re hungry, you can eat it first.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

Was he bent on cooking?

She suddenly regretted it.

She shouldn’t have made such a request.

Wasn’t he setting himself up?

Couldn’t she just order some food and eat before torturing him?

“Mo Yesi, do we have to do it today?” Qiao Mianmian wanted to discuss it further. “It’s getting late, I think...”

“Baby, don’t you want to eat it now?”

“I want to eat it now, but...”

“Then, let’s do it today.” Mo Yesi kicked open the bathroom door and carried her in. He then opened the showerhead. “Baby, I don’t find it troublesome for you. You’ve fed me enough, it’s time for me to feed you.”

Qiao Mianmian’s lips twitched.

She didn’t want to trouble him, so she asked him to do it another day.

She was just... hungry.

So hungry.

She wanted to eat right away.

In the end, he still ordered the food.

Qiao Mianmian was so tired that she didn’t even want to move her fingers.

Mo Yesi carried her to the bed and used a towel to dry her hair. After drying her hair for a while, he found a place to blow-dry her hair.

Throughout the entire process, Qiao Mianmian laid motionless on the bed, allowing the man to serve her tenderly.

After drying her hair, Mo Yesi reached out and pulled her into his arms. Smelling the sweet scent on her body, he couldn’t help but lower his head and peck her on the lips. He said gently, “I ordered takeaway, they’re all your favorite. Wait a while more, we’ll be able to eat it soon.”
