Translator: Atlas StudiosEditor: Atlas Studios

He couldn’t help but sigh when he saw the hatred in Tang Ya’s eyes. He smiled bitterly and said, “You said that I took poison, and I’ll die soon. I’m about to die, why should I care about anyone hypocritically?

“Xiao Ya, it’s alright if you hate me and don’t want to forgive me.” Mo Yunchen retracted his hand and slowly stood up. “I’ve said it before. If it can remove the hatred in your heart and make you stop living with hatred, my death is worth it.”

Tang Ya was stunned. She thought of something and bit her lip.

“Dad, what nonsense are you talking about?” Mo Shixiu frowned. “Ah Si and I will take you to the hospital now.”

“No need.” Mo Yunchen shook his head. “This is what I owe Wangqiu. I’m willing to pay with my life.” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Tang Ya looked up in surprise.

‘Mo Shixiu was anxious and angry. “Back then, it was Madam Tang who saved your life. You say you want to repay her with your life, so I won’t refute you. But don’t forget, your life was given to you by Grandma.

“If you repay it to someone else, what about Grandma?

“What are you going to repay her with? Ever since Grandfather passed away, Grandma has been in poor health because of sadness. Do you want her to die now? Have you never asked yourself if her body can still take such a blow?”

Mo Yunchen seemed to have been enlightened, and his expression changed.

Mo Yesi took out his cell phone. “I’ll get Lu Rao to get here immediately. Dad, regardless of whether you really owe Tang Wangqiu, you can’t use your life to repay her.”

At this moment, there was a flurry of footsteps outside.

The next moment, a group of people in police uniforms rushed in holding guns.

“Mr. Mo, are you alright?” The leading police officer scanned the room and saw Tang Ya lying on the ground. He waved at the police officers behind him. “The suspect in the kidnapping has been found. Bring her back!”

The police officers immediately went forward and picked Tang Ya up from the ground. Tang Ya didn’t move or ask anyone for help.

She seemed to have expected this outcome and was willing to accept it.

She was even smiling, As she was escorted by the police officers past Mo Yunchen, she whispered, “Mom said your name before she died. I think she must really want to see you again. I buried her in the cemetery in the place where she was born according to her wishes. If you still have feelings for her, go

and see her when you’re free.”

Soon, the police officers left with Tang Ya.

Mo Yesi’s cell phone rang, He looked down and picked it up immediately.

“Chairman Mo, we’ve found Miss Yueyue. She’s fine. We didn’t detect any external injuries. Should we send Miss Yueyue back to the Mo Residence now?”

“Call the Mo Residence and tell them that she’s safe. Send her back immediately.”

“Yes.”

Mo Yesi hung up and turned to Mo Shixiu. “Big Brother, they’ve found Yueyue. Yueyue is doing well now, we can rest assured. I think Sister-in-law wants to see Yueyue as soon as possible, so I got someone to send her back to the Mo Residence first.

“Now that everything is settled, we can go back..”
