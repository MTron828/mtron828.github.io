Chapter 478: M-Mo Yesi?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Just because she didn’t agree to accompany him at night.

This man... was so petty.

He was supposed to be pursuing her, but this was all wrong.

He wasn’t even giving in to her at all.

And he was actually ignoring her because of such a trivial matter.

Which woman would want to get together with a man like him!

This was the first time Qiao Mianmian had been ignored by him for this long. As she thought about how he’d been pampering her and doting on her, her eyes turned a little wet.

There was a bottle of beer on the coffee table. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Jiang Luoli had ordered it.

Qiao Mianmian didn’t like drinking, and her tolerance was pretty low too, so she hardly touched alcohol. But at this point, she suddenly felt like tasting the beer right there.

...

When Mo Yesi entered, this was exactly what he saw.

A girl was hugging her knees and sitting on the couch. Her head was down and her shoulders were shaking slightly.

She looked up when she heard someone enter.

The moment she turned around and looked at him, he felt as if something stabbed him in the heart.

She was crying?

Why was she crying?

Was it because of him?

He quickened his steps towards her as his heart ached.

All the unhappiness he felt previously dissipated when he saw her tears.

All that was left were frustration and self-reproach.

He shouldn’t have pitted himself against her.

He shouldn’t have ignored her messages on purpose or avoided calling her.

He shouldn’t have... been this cold towards her on purpose.

The thought of her sitting and crying in the private room alone hurt him so much.

Meanwhile, Qiao Mianmian was completely stunned when she saw Mo Yesi.

She looked up at him, teary-eyed and with damp cheeks.

Her head was a little foggy from the drinks.

She had to blink a few times to be sure she was seeing right. The figure got closer and closer...

Then, he stopped right before her.

Qiao Mianmian squinted, then her eyes widened. That ridiculously handsome face was just above her. “M-Mo Yesi?”

Was she hallucinating?

Otherwise, why was she seeing him right there?

Was she delusional now because she was thinking about him too much?

The man looked down at her teary eyes and paused for a moment, before squatting down slowly.

Now that he was closer to her, he could smell the alcohol.

She was really tipsy...

Under the light, the tears on her eyelashes glistened. They were almost like little diamonds sparkling.

Her nose was a little red, and he could see that she’d bitten her lip.

Mo Yesi felt that he was a little sadistic.

He actually felt that she looked especially pitiful but also adorable.

In fact, he felt like pulling her into an embrace and giving her a passionate kiss.

He reached out and wiped the tears off her eyes, and then cupped her little face in his hands for a while.
