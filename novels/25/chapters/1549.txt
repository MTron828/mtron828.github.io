Chapter 1550: It’s Completely Out of Her Style

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

If her schedule was full every day, Mo Yesi probably wouldn’t let her stay in the entertainment industry anymore.

Qiao Mianmian felt like the money Xue Shiya gave her was free.

She was pleasantly surprised.

Although it wasn’t a lot, it was a form of affirmation for her. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

She immediately sent Jiang Luoli a WeChat message: [Luo Luo, I’ve received my first endorsement fee. They think my endorsed product is selling very well and even gave me a bonus. I’ll treat you to a meal when I get back!]

Jiang Luoli replied quickly: [A bonus? Is it a lot?]

Qiao Mianmian: [It’s not a lot of money, but it’s definitely not a problem to treat you to a big meal. You can bring that person along.]

Jiang Luoli: [He’s been very busy recently. I haven’t seen him for days. I’ll tell him the next time we meet.]

Qiao Mianmian: [Oh right, did Madam Mo look for you recently?]

Jiang Luoli: [No.]

Qiao Mianmian: [Then, did she do anything else?]

Jiang Luoli: [I don’t think so...]

Qiao Mianmian was deep in thought.

It shouldn’t be.

Madam Mo strongly objected to Jiang Luoli and Mo Shixiu being together. She wanted to use money to get rid of Jiang Luoli, but was she willing to let it go?

Qiao Mianmian felt that Madam Mo wasn’t someone who would give up so easily.

It wasn’t her style to do nothing.

...

On the other side.

Jiang Luoli had just replied to Qiao Mianmian’s message when someone called her.

She saw the caller ID and her expression changed. She picked it up after a few seconds.

A sobbing voice came from the phone. “Ah Li, your brother is in trouble. You have to save him.”

...

Jiang Luoli took the fastest flight back home.

Today was Friday.

According to her usual habit, she went to Mo Shixiu’s house for the weekend.

Before she boarded the plane, she sent Sister Lin a WeChat message, telling her not to prepare her dinner tonight. She also told Sister Lin that she had returned to her hometown and wouldn’t be there for the weekend.

Coincidentally.

After she got on the plane and turned off her cell phone, Mo Shixiu’s Rolls-Royce slowly drove into the house.

After getting off the car.

Sister Lin was waiting outside the building as usual.

Mo Shixiu handed the laptop to Assistant Xu. Seeing Sister Lin standing outside alone, he looked at the time and asked curiously, “Sister Lin, Luoli didn’t come today?”

Sister Lin sighed.

Mister had been very busy recently and hadn’t been back for a long time.

He finally came back today, but Miss Jiang wasn’t around.

They missed each other.

She wondered when Mister would return next.

If he got busy, he wouldn’t be able to see her for half a month.

“Miss Jiang said she has something to attend to at home, so she won’t be here this weekend.”

“Back home?”

Mo Shixiu took out his cell phone and called Jiang Luoli. A robotic female voice came from the cell phone, indicating that Jiang Luoli’s cell phone was off.

Mo Shixiu frowned and hung up. “Did she say what it was?”

Sister Lin shook her head. “No.”

Mo Shixiu pursed his lips and kept quiet for a while. He then turned around and asked Assistant Xu, “You checked her information before. Do you remember where her hometown is?”

Assistant Xu thought for a while and nodded. “I remember. Miss Jiang’s hometown is a small county called Hui Ning.”
