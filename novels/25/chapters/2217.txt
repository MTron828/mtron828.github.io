Chapter 2220: You’re My True Love

“We don’t know what’s going on between them. Sometimes, being nice might help. What do you think?”

Qiao Mianmian thought for a while and nodded.

Alright.

She just wanted her brother to get into a relationship as soon as possible.

Mo Yesi made sense.

“I’m just afraid that my brother won’t be able to see through his heart and will do something he’ll regret. Since you say so, I won’t bother.”

Mo Yesi smiled. “If he really can’t see his own heart, it means that this relationship isn’t fated to be. Many things rely on fate. For example, you, Big Brother, and Jiang Luoli. When fate comes, what’s yours will always be yours. What shouldn’t belong to you can’t be forced.” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Wow.” Qiao Mianmian blinked and sighed.

“Mm?” Mo Yesi raised an eyebrow. “What’s wrong?”

Qiao Mianmian couldn’t help but laugh. “Your words are so philosophical. I didn’t expect you to believe in fate, too. I thought you wouldn’t be so superstitious.”

“Mm? This isn’t superstition.” Mo Yesi knocked her on the head lightly. “I didn’t believe in this at first, but ever since I met you, I feel that fate does exist.”

Otherwise, how could he explain that he was allergic to other women but not her?

How could it be explained that after Mo Shixiu being single for 30 years and not liking anyone, Mo Shixiu found Qiao Mianmian’s best friend, Jiang Luoli?

He married Qiao Mianmian, and Mo Shixiu married Jiang Luoli.

And Qiao Mianmian and Jiang Luoli were best friends.

Some things were so coincidental that he had to believe in fate.

“Is that so?” Qiao Mianmian looked up and smiled. “So, you believe that I’m your destined one?”

“Mm, I do.” Mo Yesi smiled, looking at her with eyes full of love. “Baby, you’re my true love.”

Qiao Mianmian smiled in satisfaction and kissed him on the lips. “Then, you’re my true love too.”

“Oh right, how’s Chen Chen’s surgery going?” Qiao Chen was done with his college entrance examination and the surgery time was set. Although Mo Yesi was the chief surgeon and he promised her that the surgery would be successful, Qiao Mianmian was getting more worried as the surgery day approached.

She trusted Mo Yesi’s skills.

But she was too worried about Qiao Chen.

“Of course not.” Mo Yesi smiled and pinched her cheek. “Baby, didn’t I tell you? Don’t worry, Chen Chen’s surgery will definitely be successful. After the surgery, he’ll be like any normal person.”

“I know.” Qiao Mianmian sighed. “I just can’t control myself and can’t help but worry. Do you find me annoying? I’ve asked you so many times, but I still don’t believe you.”

“No.” Mo Yesi’s eyes were gentle. “You’re worried about him because you care too much about Chen Chen. I understand.”

Qiao Mianmian leaned into his arms. “Mm. Although Chen Chen isn’t my biological brother, in my eyes, he’s no different from one. Ever since our adoptive mother and grandmother passed away, Chen Chen and I practically relied on each other in the Qiao family. Chen Chen had a harder time than me when he was young, and now that he’s back in the Mo family, he’s really doing well, but his situation isn’t very good. I really hope Chen Chen’s life will get better.”
