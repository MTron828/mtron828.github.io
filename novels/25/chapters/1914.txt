Chapter 1917: Killing the Shangguan Family

Could he have been angered by Young Madam?

But that wasn’t right, either.

If he had been angered by Young Madam, there was no need for him to target the Shangguan family.

He didn’t even care about his relationship with the Gong family anymore.

Wei Zheng became more curious.

What exactly did President Mo encounter? No, it should be said that the Shangguan family did something that made him so angry.

As soon as he returned, he wanted to eliminate them.

In addition, Wei Zheng had a feeling that the Gong family had something to do with President Mo’s anger.

When he said that he would cut off all business dealings with them, he didn’t hesitate at all.

If the Gong family hadn’t done something to make him unhappy, he wouldn’t be like this.

They left the airport.

The chauffeur was waiting outside. When he saw them come out, he quickly stepped forward and called out respectfully, “President Mo.”

Mo Yesi got into the car expressionlessly.

After he got into the car, Wei Zheng thought that he would go directly to the office or go home, but Mo Yesi told the chauffeur, “To the Gong family.”

“Yes, President Mo.”

Wei Zheng sat in the passenger seat and looked at Mo Yesi through the rearview mirror. He felt that this matter was not as simple as it seemed.

He might have guessed correctly just now.

The Gong family might have done something that made President Mo unhappy.

And this matter was probably quite serious.

Otherwise, President Mo wouldn’t have rushed over to the Gong Family the moment he got off the plane.

Thinking of the scandal between Qiao Mianmian and Gong Zeli, many guesses surfaced in Wei Zheng’s mind.

He looked at Mo Yesi’s gloomy face in the rearview mirror again and couldn’t help but feel worried.

No matter how he looked at it, President Mo seemed to be suppressing his temper and was about to explode.

Moreover, once it erupted, it would definitely be terrifying.

If President Mo got into a fight with the Gong family, should he try to calm him?

...

At the Gong residence.

When the maid informed Madam Gong that Mo Yesi had arrived, Madam Gong, who was pruning the flowers, almost cut her hand.

She looked up and was stunned for a while before asking, “Mo Yesi is here? What’s he doing here?”

The maid shook her head. “Mr. Mo didn’t say anything. He only said that he had something to discuss with Madam.”

Madam Gong’s expression changed again.

She put down the scissors, and the maid quickly went over to help her up.

Madam Gong didn’t look good.

Mo Yesi had never looked for her alone, and she only had a few words with this junior at some banquets. Apart from that, they had no other contact.

But now...

Mo Yesi suddenly came to the Gong residence and said he was looking for her.

He must be here for something. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

And if it wasn’t something important, he wouldn’t have personally come.

Thinking about some things, Madam Gong’s expression turned even uglier. She started to panic.

She asked the maid, “How did he look when you saw him?”

The maid answered truthfully, “I don’t think Mr. Mo is very happy. He didn’t look too good.”

Madam Gong bit her lip.

She hesitated for a few seconds before saying, “Invite him in.”

“Yes, ma’am.”

Madam Gong was very uneasy as she waited.

She could roughly guess why Mo Yesi was looking for her, but she was hoping that he wouldn’t find out so easily.

After a while, Madam Gong heard footsteps.

“Madam, Mr. Mo is here.” The maid brought Mo Yesi into the hall.
