Chapter 1602: Since When Did Chairman Gong Have a Fiancée?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Although she wasn’t with Gong Zeli yet, with Madam Gong’s words, Shangguan Qing already saw herself as half a lady boss.

“Miss, are you looking for Chairman Gong?”

Hearing her address Gong Zeli so intimately, the receptionist was stunned and sized her up again.

Shangguan Qing raised her chin. “That’s right. Is he in the office?”

“Chairman Gong is here, but...”

“But what?” Shangguan Qing looked a little impatient.

“Miss, do you have an appointment? If you do, I can help you confirm it. If Chairman Gong agrees, you can go up.”

“Do I need an appointment to look for Brother Zeli?” Shangguan Qing’s expression darkened. “Do you know who I am?”

The few receptionists looked at each other for a few seconds before shaking their heads. “Miss, may I know what your relationship with Chairman Gong is...”

Shangguan Qing said arrogantly, “I’m Brother Zeli’s fiancée.”

“You’re Chairman Gong’s fiancée?!” The female employees were shocked.

Since when did Chairman Gong have a fiancée?

But looking at Shangguan Qing’s dressing and temperament, they felt that she wasn’t lying.

Shangguan Qing looked like a rich girl.

They thought that maybe Gong Zeli really had a fiancée.

After all, it was normal for him to have a fiancée at his age.

Not all wealthy families were high-profile and would publicize this.

“Of course I’m Brother Zeli’s fiancée. Why, do you think I’m lying? Do you want me to call Brother Zeli in person and let you confirm it?”

Shangguan Qing lied and said that she was Gong Zeli’s fiancée because she felt that she would definitely marry him in the future.

Hence, she had to let these restless women know her identity.

She didn’t want them to have any designs on Gong Zeli.

None of the female employees suspected that she was lying.

They were even more polite to Shangguan Qing now.

“Miss, please go up. Chairman Gong is upstairs.”

Shangguan Qing snorted, turned around, and left proudly.

After she left.

The female employees started discussing.

“Is that really Chairman Gong’s fiancée? Wouldn’t it be bad if we just let her up?”

“I guess so. It doesn’t look like she’s lying.”

“Didn’t Chairman Gong like Miss Shen? Why would he be engaged to another woman? I thought he would definitely marry Miss Shen in the future.” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“The Shen Family can’t do it anymore. Even if Chairman Gong still likes Miss Shen, his family won’t agree to it.”

“That’s true. The Shen Family now can’t even take the better families, let alone our Chairman Gong.”

...

When Gong Zeli heard the knock, he thought it was his assistant and said, “Come in.”

The office door was pushed open.

The sound of high heels on the ground could be heard, and then a soft voice sounded. “Brother Zeli.”

Shangguan Qing walked into the office with the lunch box. When she saw Gong Zeli, her heart raced and she called out to him.

At the black desk.

Reading a document, the man stiffened and slowly looked up.
