Chapter 911: This Man... Is Really Mo Shixiu

She seemed to be rooted to the ground as her eyes widened in shock. She stared at Mo Shixiu for a while before rubbing her eyes and shaking her head.

When she opened her eyes again and saw that the man was still standing in front of her, looking at her with gentle eyes and a slight smile, she was finally sure that she wasn’t dreaming, nor was she hallucinating.

This man was real.

He was really... Mo Shixiu.

She really... saw Mo Shixiu.

But she still couldn’t recover from this shock. She still felt that this was unbelievable and didn’t feel real at all.

The man Assistant Xu was referring to was Mo Shixiu?!

The man she had a moment with that night was Mo Shixiu?!!

How was that possible?

Even in her dreams, she couldn’t possibly dream of something so absurd and ridiculous.

“Miss Jiang, nice to meet you. I’m sorry for asking you to come over. Let me introduce myself first. I’m Mo Shixiu, 29 years old this year. I’m still single and don’t have any bad habits. I don’t have any illnesses.”

Jiang Luoli looked at him blankly.

Her mind was still blank.

This man... was really Mo Shixiu.

Mo Shixiu, the man she had once idolized and fantasized about for several nights.

The man she felt was as distant and sacred as a god.

He was the Prince Charming in the dreams of all the women in Country A. He used to be the man most wanted to sleep with.

Back then, Jiang Luoli’s dream in life was to sleep with him once.

She never thought that her dream would come true.

She really slept with Mo Shixiu.

She wanted someone to tell her that she wasn’t dreaming.

She really slept with Mo Shixiu.

Mo Shixiu looked at her stunned expression and couldn’t help but laugh. “Miss Jiang, do you have anything to say to me? If you feel it’s inconvenient, I’ll get them to leave first. We can have a private chat.”

With that, Mo Shixiu shot Assistant Xu a look, signaling him to disappear.

Assistant Xu looked worried and angry.

He knew that Jiang Luoli would react this way when she saw the Minister.

What should he do now?

This woman must be thinking about how to seduce the minister. She might even be dreaming of marrying the minister and becoming his wife.

The minister was just a blank piece of paper when it came to relationships, and this woman surnamed Jiang was obviously a familiar face. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

He was worried that the minister would fall into her trap.

“Minister, you...” Assistant Xu wanted to remind him.

Mo Shixiu glanced at him coldly. “Have you finished what I asked you to do today?”

Assistant Xu replied, “... No.”

“Then, why are you still standing here? Do you need me to remind you what to do?”

The man’s voice was still gentle, but Assistant Xu shuddered and dared not say another word.

“Yes, Minister. I’ll get it done right away.”

...

After Assistant Xu left, Mo Shixiu got the housemaids to leave too.

Sister Lin served the coffee and left.

Only Mo Shixiu and Jiang Luoli were left in the huge living room.
