Chapter 63: You’re Qiao Mianmian?

Shen Yueyue already had a bad memory from the fall previously.

She hadn’t expected Qiao Mianmian to have such a fighting spirit, given her usual gentle demeanor.

Qiao Mianmian’s arm stopped in mid-air. Glaring at Qiao Mianmian coldly, she felt fear inside.

She intuitively took a step back.

But the moment she realized that everyone was still looking at her, she tossed another insult. “Bitch!”

She went on and sent a slap towards Qiao Mianmian’s face.

But how could Qiao Mianmian allow that? She grabbed her hand before Shen Yueyue could hit her.

“Ah, it hurts. Bitch, let go!” Shen Yueyue yelled the moment her wrist was grabbed. Struggling, her face distorted with pain.

Qiao Mianmian was using a lot of force.

Even a man might not beat her in an arm-wrestling match.

Let alone a pampered girl like Shen Yueyue.

She had only used a little force and Shen Yueyue’s face had already gone red. “Qiao Mianmian, bitch. Let go of me! I’m going to fight you!”

“Oh, sure.”

Qiao Mianmian nodded and released her.

But her sudden release had Shen Yueyue lose her balance from the struggle.

She fell to the ground instantly and landed at Qiao Mianmian’s feet.

Qiao Mianmian couldn’t help but laugh. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

She shook her head and sighed as she looked down at Shen Yueyue. “Hey, Shen Yueyue, you don’t have to be so respectful to me. That’s too much for me to bear.”

The people around erupted with laughter again as they saw Shen Yueyue’s pathetic state.

“Shen Yueyue is so daring to provoke Qiao Mianmian. Isn’t she afraid that Young Master Su will get angry with her?”

“I heard Young Master Su and Qiao Mianmian have broken up.”

“What? My idol has finally called it off with this little slut? Is this news reliable? I heard that Young Master Su really likes her, why would they suddenly break up?”

“Qiao Mianmian apparently cheated on him.”

“Young Master Su is such an outstanding boyfriend, and she actually cheated on him? Young Master Su was so nice to her, how heartless of her.”

The crowd began talking about it.

Fuming with embarrassment, Shen Yueyue yelled at the few young men who had come along with her. “Why are you guys still standing there? Hurry and teach this bitch a lesson!”

“Qiao Mianmian, you’re too much!” Zhao Wanting looked aggrieved. She said coquettishly to the man beside her, “Brother Du Ze, you’ve seen it for yourself! Qiao Mianmian is really too much, you’ve got to help Yue Yue and me out.”

The man called Du Ze had a stick of cigarette in his mouth as he narrowed his eyes. He sized Qiao Mianmian up openly.

Then, he gave an evil grin.

“You’re Qiao Mianmian?” There was unmistakable awe in his eyes.

The girl standing before him was dressed very simply, just like an ordinary student. But she had such a beautiful face.

Her facial features were so exquisite that one couldn’t find a single flaw.

Especially that perfect complexion—tender and fair.
