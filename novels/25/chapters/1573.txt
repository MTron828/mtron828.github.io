Chapter 1574: Perhaps You Still Have a Little Hope of Leaving

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Jiang Hai looked haggard. His face was pale, and the dark circles under his eyes were obvious.

It was obvious that he hadn’t slept well the past few days.

It’d be strange if he could sleep well in such a place.

After all, he was her biological brother. They used to be close when they were young.

Jiang Luoli felt bad for him.

But even so, she still felt that Jiang Hai deserved it.

“Since you don’t want to stay here, why didn’t you think of this day when you took someone else’s money?”

“Sister, I-I was wrong.” Jiang Hai held Jiang Luoli’s hand tightly and cried. “I know my mistake now. I won’t dare to do it again. Can you save me? I’m your biological brother.

“You can’t bear to see me locked up, right?”

Jiang Luoli pulled her hand out of his grasp.

Jiang Hai was stunned and looked at her in a panic. “Sister.”

“Xiao Hai, you’re not a three-year-old child anymore. When people do something wrong, they have to bear the consequences.

“You should know that you don’t owe 12,000 yuan. Do you think I can fork out 10 million yuan to pay your debt?”

“Sister...”

“I didn’t come here today to take you away. I can’t take you away, either. If you want to be released, it’s best you tell me everything from the beginning to the end. Don’t miss a single word. Perhaps you still have a chance.”

Jiang Luoli was furious.

But after calming down, she felt that this matter was indeed strange.

It wasn’t as if the casino didn’t have such tricks.

But that was because they had asked about the other party’s wealth and made sure that the other party had the ability to repay it.

The person who lent Jiang Hai 10 million yuan must have heard about the Jiang family.

It’d be abnormal if they lent the money to Jiang Hai knowing about the Jiang family’s situation.

Jiang Hai had never been locked up like this.

He immediately told Jiang Luoli everything that happened.

Then, he tugged Jiang Luoli’s sleeve with tears in his eyes. “Sister, I’ve told you everything. I promise that everything I said is true. He said that he would definitely be able to bring me money. I thought that if I could win a sum of money, I could improve our family’s life.

“I could buy a big house and a good car. You wouldn’t have to worry about me anymore.

“Sister, I really didn’t expect that I would...”

“Alright.” Jiang Luoli raised her hand and interrupted him. “When people gamble, they only think they will win. They never think they will lose. You’ve already been tricked many times and suffered many losses. Haven’t you learned your lesson?

“Don’t say you’re thinking for the Jiang family. You’re just too greedy, that’s why you fell into someone else’s trap.

“Even if the other party deliberately set you up, it’s because you can’t resist the temptation.”

Jiang Luoli sighed as she looked at the crying Jiang Hai.

Jiang Hai wasn’t a bad person.

He was rather obedient and sensible when he was young. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

It was all because of their indulgence.

Jiang Luoli used to discipline Jiang Hai when she lived at home. He was willing to listen to her and didn’t go too far.
