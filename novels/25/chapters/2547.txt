“Xiao Xin is still young, so it’s understandable that she isn’t considerate enough. She did something wrong, can’t she just salvage it?

“You’re biological sisters. Talk nicely. Don’t hit her so easily.”

Madam Shen’s protective behavior made Shen Rou even angrier. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

She glared at Shen Xin. “What do you mean young? She’s not considerate enough. She doesn’t even care about her family anymore because of Qiao Chen.

“I’m her biological sister, but she actually helped that slut Qiao Mianmian! I think she’s blinded by love. She doesn’t even care about her family anymore.”

Shen Xin didn’t react to Shen Rou’s slap. She just covered her face and listened to the scolding.

She only looked up when Shen Rou mentioned Qiao Mianmian and Qiao Chen.

The girl looked at Shen Rou expressionlessly.

“Do you see that!” Shen Rou was even more furious when she saw her reaction. She pointed at her nose and sneered. “She didn’t react to everything I said. Now that I mention Qiao Chen, she looks at me like that.

“What’s wrong? Are you unhappy that I said that about him? Shen Xin, don’t forget your surname. Are you going to turn against your sister for a man? Let me tell you, the Shen family is relying on me now. If anything happens to me, do you think you can still have a good life?

“Do you think that Qiao Chen would still think highly of you if the Shen family falls from power?

“Do you think that by helping Qiao Mianmian this time, he’ll be grateful to you, develop a good impression of you, and fall in love with you? Stop dreaming. He didn’t like you when he was still a poor boy. Now that he’s the Young Master of the Mo family, he can’t possibly like you.

“Everything you’ve done was just to move him. He’s willing to interact with you now because he feels that you still have some value. Do you believe that after this incident, he won’t bother about you anymore? I really can’t understand how I have such a stupid sister like you. He’s just a man, and you’re already so infatuated with him that you don’t even care about your family.

Shen Rou’s words were harsh.

Shen Xin’s face turned pale.

“Sister, Qiao Chen isn’t this kind of person.” Shen Xin didn’t defend herself, but she couldn’t tolerate Shen Rou talking about Qiao Chen like this.

She knew very well what kind of person Qiao Chen was.

He had never used her.

“He’s not?” Shen Rou said angrily. “You’re confused by him, that’s why you can’t see clearly. The siblings are the same kind of people, they’re not good people. They use any means to get close to the rich and powerful.

“These two lowly people used tricks and schemes, and now they’ve become upper-class people.”

“Sister, you’re biased against them.” Shen Xin shook her head. “Qiao Chen has never used me, and he never asked me to do anything. I did everything willingly.

“I don’t agree with you.”
