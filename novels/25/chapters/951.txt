Chapter 953: No More Cooperation

The topic of Qiao Mianmian getting out of the entertainment industry, Qiao Mianmian being a kept woman, Qiao Mianmian seducing the director of the production crew, and so on were all trending topics that day.

All the official Weibo accounts of the entertainment industry had also been reposted by the “insider”. When she refreshed her Weibo, it was almost all news related to her.

Almost all of the trending topics were filled with Tu Yilei’s fans.

The fans seemed to hate her to the core and were all clamoring for her to get out of the entertainment industry. They wanted to boycott her and make her unable to survive in the entertainment industry.

Countless fans even privately messaged her, threatening and cursing her. They said that if Tu Yilei really had to leave the entertainment industry for a year because he was seriously injured after saving her, they would pay back the losses he suffered.

Qiao Mianmian logged out of Weibo after a few minutes.

Although she wasn’t a fragile person, she couldn’t remain calm in the face of so many insults and threats.

Most of the fans were young, and it was easy for them to lose control of their emotions.

Qiao Mianmian was a little afraid when she saw the comments that claimed that they wanted to beat her up.

She’d seen a lot of things that happened because of online violence.

In her opinion, online violence was really scary.

It was even scarier for her.

Just as she logged out of Weibo, her cell phone rang. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

It was Linda.

Qiao Mianmian hesitated for a while before picking it up. “Sister Xie.”

There was no response from the other end for a while. Qiao Mianmian waited for a while, wondering if Linda had disconnected. Then, Linda finally said, “Mianmian, have you seen the news?”

Qiao Mianmian kept quiet for a few seconds before replying softly.

“Have you thought about how this got out?” Linda sounded a little serious.

“I don’t know.” Qiao Mianmian kept quiet for a while before saying softly, “Sister Xie, I’m sorry. I seem to be causing trouble all the time. I’m really sorry, even though I know it’s useless to apologize.”

She felt a little ashamed.

She’d caused so much trouble ever since she signed the contract.

Although it wasn’t her intention, it was all because of her.

She had an undeniable responsibility.

“It’s not your fault.” Linda sighed. “You weren’t the one who got Tu Yilei to help you. You weren’t the one who pushed him to help you. He did it willingly. You didn’t do anything wrong. It’s just that his fans are too protective of their idol, that’s why they attacked you on Weibo.

“No one is at fault in this matter. The only one at fault is Huang Yilin. She’s already been arrested.”

“But... I caused you trouble again,” Qiao Mianmian said guiltily. “Sister Xie, am I the most troublesome artiste you’ve ever signed?”

“Mianmian.” Linda sighed again. “I’m sorry, the company has other ideas about the contract. I’m afraid we can’t continue working together.

“I’m really sorry and regretful. I have high hopes for you, but the company... I’m just a manager, I can’t decide everything.”
