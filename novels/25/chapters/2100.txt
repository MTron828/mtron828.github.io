Chapter 2103: Is It Because You Already Have Someone in Your Heart?

“I feel bad for making Sister Shen unhappy.

“I’ll teach him a lesson later.”

Madam Shen smiled coldly. “Madam Gong, you’re being too serious.”

With that, she turned to leave.

“Mom, hold on.”

Shen Rou tugged at her and looked up. She clenched her fists and said, “I have something to say to Zeli.” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Madam Shen was stunned.

“What else do you have to say to him? Wasn’t he clear enough?” Madam Shen looked at her daughter, a little angry. “He already said that he isn’t willing to marry you. Do you want to be humiliated by him again?”

Madam Gong was embarrassed.

She wanted to explain, but seeing how angry Madam Shen was, she decided against it.

Shen Rou’s expression stiffened.

Biting her lip, she suppressed her anger, took a deep breath, and said, “Mom, I know how to handle my own matters. Wait for me.”

With that, she went upstairs to look for Gong Zeli.

…

“What are you doing here?” Gong Zeli looked at Shen Rou, who entered his bedroom without knocking.

“Zeli, I want to talk to you.” Shen Rou stopped in front of him.

“I don’t think we have anything to talk about,” Gong Zeli said coldly. “Please leave now. I didn’t allow you to enter my room. Miss Shen, you’re from a prestigious family. Don’t you know you’re supposed to knock before entering someone’s room?”

Shen Rou’s expression stiffened.

She bit her lip. “Zeli, I want to talk to you about the marriage. I ask you to reconsider it. Given the current situation, if we marry, it will be beneficial to both our families.

“You know very well that with our backgrounds, we’ll have to marry someone with the same status in the future. Since we can’t avoid marriage, isn’t it better to marry someone we know? Isn’t it better to be with someone we grew up with and understand?

“Moreover, in terms of family background, the Shen and Gong families are the most compatible. Recently, our Shen family has just opened up a new project. If our two families ally and work on this project together, I guarantee that we will definitely make a huge profit.

“Zeli, reconsider it. Even… even if you don’t like me anymore, just treat it as a business. The marriage is only for outsiders to see. After marrying, we can still live our own lives and not interfere with each other.”

Shen Rou lowered her voice and said humbly, “Zeli, I only need the status of Mrs. Gong.”

But even so, Gong Zeli rejected her without hesitation.

He narrowed his eyes. “I can’t give you this identity. Find someone else.”

Shen Rou’s breathing tightened. Her face turned pale at his direct rejection.

She clenched her fists and asked, “Why? You don’t want to get married because you already have someone in your heart? If you don’t want to marry me, who do you want to marry? Your savior?”
