Su Ze froze for a few seconds.

He stared at Qiao Mianmian’s mockingly sorrowful eyes and frowned, a trace of guilt finally appearing in his eyes. However, he continued hugging the woman in his arms tightly. “I’m sorry, Mianmian. Anxin is pregnant with my child, I have to take responsibility for her.”

“Ha.” Qiao Mianmian felt like she had just heard a big joke.

“You have to take responsibility for her? What about me? Su Ze, what am I?”

Su Ze pursed his lips tightly. He looked down at Qiao Anxin’s pale face and trembling body. He tightened his embrace and held her firmly in his arms.

Qiao Anxin also hugged onto him tightly, still appearing very attached to him. She called gently, “Brother Ah Ze.”

Su Ze reached out and touched her head, then raised his head to look at Qiao Mianmian. After a long silence, he said hoarsely, “Mianmian, I’m sorry. The person I love is Anxin. I can’t deceive myself, and I don’t want to deceive you.”

After listening to his apology, Qiao Mianmian felt extremely cold and disappointed.

She just wanted to laugh now.

In the beginning, he had said that he would stay with her for a lifetime and would never let her down.

He had also said that he would only love her in his life.

But now, what was all this?

He just said that he was in love with Qiao Anxin.

Qiao Mianmian’s lips twitched a little ironically and she laughed.

Qiao Anxin turned and smirked slightly, revealing a smile of victory.

Her lips moved, and although no sound came out from her mouth, Qiao Mianmian understood what she was saying.

She was saying: Sister, I won again.

Qiao Mianmian looked at the two embracing each other, the disappointment and sadness fading a little.

After a moment, she nodded. “Okay, Su Ze.”

She looked at the familiar but strange face in front of her. There were no emotions in his eyes except for indifference. “As you wish, we will break the engagement.

“Su Ze, from this moment on, we go our separate ways. If we see each other in the future, we are strangers!”

After that, she turned and walked out.

Her footsteps were decisive and without a trace of nostalgia.

Su Ze looked at her resolute back and panicked, moving to chase after her.

“Mianmian...”

“Brother Ah Ze!”

At this time, he heard a painful moaning sound behind him. “My stomach suddenly hurts...”

Su Ze’s expression changed, and he hurriedly turned around and quickly walked to her.

He held her. “Anxin, what’s wrong with you?”

Qiao Anxin covered her stomach with one hand and frowned. “My stomach feels uncomfortable suddenly, it hurts so much. Brother Ah Ze, could something be wrong with our baby?”

At the mention of the baby being in trouble, Su Ze focused all his attention on Qiao Anxin.

He never thought about Qiao Mianmian again.

With a tense expression on his face, he said, “No, absolutely not. Don’t worry about it, Anxin, our baby will definitely be healthy. I’ll take you to the hospital right away.”

Qiao Mianmian walked to the door.

Hearing the movement behind her, she paused.

But soon, she pushed the door and went out.
