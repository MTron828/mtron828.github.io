Chapter 625: I’m the Outsider, You Guys Are the Real Family

“The family has enough troubles already. Are you doing this to create more trouble for all of us?”

“Grandma, don’t be upset,” Mo Shixiu said, immediately getting up and going to Old Madam’s side. He started to pat her back, worried that she would get too agitated. “It’s just a misunderstanding. Now that everything is explained properly, everything is fine.”

“Mom,” Mo Shixiu said with a frown after he coaxed Old Madam. “You must have misunderstood Sis-in-law. I believe she isn’t someone that would do such things. Let’s not talk about this anymore. She’s a part of the family already. Stop addressing her as an outsider.”

Mo Shixiu had always been in a position of power. He held an important role in the ministry of defense despite his young age. Hence, he gave off a frightening aura when he was serious. Madam Mo was actually a bit fearful of him even though he was her son.

But she wasn’t going to be reprimanded in such a manner in front of everyone.

She was the mother-in-law. Why couldn’t she comment when her daughter-in-law was seen together with her ex-boyfriend in public?

Was she not allowed to ask?

How did she wrong her daughter-in-law?

She must be faking it.

She wanted to ruin the relationship between her and her son.

Madam Mo always perceived Qiao Mianmian as a manipulative woman. She must have tricked her son into marrying her in such a short time.

She was really upset by the matter. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

If it wasn’t for Old Madam, she wasn’t going to readily accept Qiao Mianmian as her daughter-in-law.

She was never going to let such a manipulative woman enter the Mo family.

Hence, since she was prejudiced against Qiao Mianmian, she naturally thought that Qiao Mianmian was vicious and her actions had hidden agendas.

They were just acts that showed how manipulative she was.

It was like the saying “If you didn’t like someone, you would find fault in everything he does.”

She hated Qiao Mianmian even more after she saw Old Madam and her sons supporting her.

She had already created so much trouble in the family in such a short period of time.

Who knew what other tricks she had up her sleeve?

“Alright.” Madam Mo stood up in anger. She suddenly felt that she was isolated as even her sons would not support her. She then continued furiously, “It’s all my fault. I’ve misunderstood her. I’ve hurt her feelings. She’s completely innocent. She has done nothing wrong.

“I’m the evil mother-in-law.

“I was wrong just now. I’m the outsider, you guys are the real family.”

After she screamed the final sentence, Madam Mo left the dining hall.

“Such horrible behavior! Such horrible behavior. How could she, as a senior, behave in such a manner! This must be because of your father. He treated her too well. She’s spoilt!” Old Madam’s anger rose as she saw Madam Mo storm out of the dining hall.

She was so angry that she was having trouble breathing.

“Old Madam, calm down. You must take care of your body.” Uncle Zhang was shocked when he saw that Old Madam was having trouble breathing. He immediately fished out her medication and got the servant to fetch a cup of warm water.

Old Madam was old. Even though she had taken good care of her body, she still had minor ailments.
