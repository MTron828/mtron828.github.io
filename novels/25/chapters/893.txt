Chapter 894: You... You Understand?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Alright. I’ll wait for you, then.” Tu Yilei cut her off before she could finish her sentence. “Come over tomorrow, we can continue acting together. I feel that something isn’t right today. Come over tomorrow and we can study it together.”

...

Qiao Mianmian received a call from Mo Yesi the moment she left the ward.

On the other end of the line, the man’s low and magnetic voice could be heard. “What are you doing, have you eaten?”

Qiao Mianmian turned to look at the ward and hesitated for a few seconds before saying, “I’m in the hospital. I haven’t eaten. I’m about to go out.”

“In the hospital? What’s wrong?”

“It’s nothing, I...” Qiao Mianmian was about to say something when she changed her mind.” I’m fine. The male artiste from the same crew was injured, so I came to the hospital to see him.

“I’m going back now.”

“Which male artiste?”

Mo Yesi had always been good at getting to the point. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Qiao Mianmian knew his personality and didn’t intend to hide it from him. After some thought, she told him everything that happened on the set.

“If he didn’t shield me, I might have...” Qiao Mianmian took a deep breath and paused for a few seconds before continuing, “So I’m very grateful to him. While he’s in the hospital, I might have come to accompany him for a while.

“Mo Yesi, I know you mind him a lot. But the situation is special now, I can’t just ignore him. I owe him a huge favor, and I don’t know how to repay him. If I ignore him like before, I... I can’t do it.

“But I only feel gratitude towards him, nothing else. You... you can understand, right?” she asked cautiously.

Although she knew that he would mind, she still chose to tell him everything.

She didn’t want to hide it from him.

Even if she didn’t say it, he would find out sooner or later.

If she deliberately hid it, it would only make him feel worse.

Mo Yesi kept quiet after she said that.

After a minute of silence, he finally spoke. The man’s voice was low and gentle as usual. “Why didn’t you tell me about this immediately?

“If I didn’t call you, were you planning on not telling me?

“Qiao Mianmian, do you know that I’ve been waiting for your call? I thought that you’d call me soon. I thought that you’d tell me how scared you were and ask me to rush to your side immediately. That you wanted to see me very much.

“I waited until this morning, but you haven’t called or sent me a single message. And now you’re telling me that you’ve been accompanying that man with the surname Tu? Qiao Mianmian, in your heart, am I still your husband? Have you ever treated me as your other half?

“Even if it’s not convenient for you to call me, don’t tell me you didn’t even have the time to send me a message? You didn’t say a word after such a huge thing happened. Are you blaming me because I wasn’t by your side when you were in danger?”

Qiao Mianmian was stunned by his words.

“No, Mo Yesi, I didn’t...” She quickly explained, “I don’t blame you.”
