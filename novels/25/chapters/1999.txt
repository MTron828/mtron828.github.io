Chapter 2001: This Way of Handling Mo Yesi

Gong Zeli clarified it on Weibo?

Qiao Mianmian hung up and opened Weibo.

Soon, she saw his post.

Gong Zeli used his Weibo account.

He didn’t explain much.

Gong Zeli: [Don’t overdo it. There’s no competition. Why don’t you be the scriptwriter?]

After Gong Zeli posted it, the comment section was flooded with comments.

“What does Young Master Gong mean? Are those in District T spreading rumors?”

“He just denied that they were fighting over a woman. He didn’t deny that the Mo and Gong corporations halt cooperation. Is their cooperation really finished?”

“There’s no smoke without fire. This isn’t the first time you and Qiao Mianmian are involved in a scandal. If you two weren’t involved, would others need to act so much? This clarification seems like a cover-up to me.”

“I did. I only denied that he didn’t fight with his brother for a woman, but I didn’t deny that the two families are in conflict. It seems like there’s really something wrong with the Mo and Gong families.”

Qiao Mianmian turned to look at Mo Yesi.

“What did your manager say?” he asked.

Qiao Mianmian told him about Linda’s suggestion.

“You want me to clarify things on Weibo?” Mo Yesi took out his cell phone and opened the app. He quickly created a post.

After he was done typing, he handed her his cell phone. “Take a look and see if it’s suitable. If you see anything wrong, just change it.”

“There’s no need. You can just post it.”

“Take a look.”

At Mo Yesi’s insistence, Qiao Mianmian took the cell phone.

Mo Yesi’s post was also very short.

Nameless: “I’ll give you an hour to delete the post. Otherwise, bear the consequences.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

Very good, this was how Mo Yesi handled things.

Without any explanation, he simply said, “bear the consequences.”

This method was domineering, arrogant, and condescending, but the effect would definitely be good.

Qiao Mianmian felt that she had nothing to change, so she directly sent it and returned the phone to him.

She couldn’t help but ask, “Mo Yesi, is there really no room for negotiation with the Gong Corporation? Actually, I think...”

Before she could finish, Mo Yesi interrupted her coldly. “Don’t bother about this. I know what to do. The Gong family bullied my people. If I can pretend nothing happened, they’ll think that I don’t value you.

“Next time, they’ll definitely hurt you even more.

“Everything else can be discussed. But there’s nothing to discuss about this. Don’t worry. After this period of time, you can give yourself a good vacation. If you want to worry, you can think about our future wedding.”

“Wedding?” Qiao Mianmian was stunned.

“You said that we’ll hold a wedding after you graduate. I’ve always remembered this. You haven’t forgotten, right?”

Qiao Mianmian didn’t forget.

She remembered saying that, too.Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

But if Mo Yesi hadn’t reminded her, she would have forgotten about it.

“Think about what kind of wedding you want and where you want to hold it. After you’ve thought about it, we can start the preparations.”
