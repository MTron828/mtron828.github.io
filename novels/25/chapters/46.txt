Chapter 47: My Patience Is Also Limited

Qiao Mianmian managed to catch her breath. She looked up with her lost black watery eyes and glared at him, annoyed. “How could you...”

“Of course I can.”

Mo Yesi reached out and tucked a strand of her hair behind her ears. He said with a smirk, “Mianmian, I’m your husband. We are now husband and wife. Do you think I can?

“So, Mianmian... you better adapt to me as soon as possible. My patience is also limited, you know?”

Qiao Mianmian watched the man’s exquisitely beautiful face suddenly enlarge before her eyes. When his warm and moist breath spilled onto her lips, her heart started beating wildly again.

Qiao Mianmian was still a student. She was in junior year and would enter the internship period in the second half of the year.

She usually lived on campus.

The two-day weekend was over, and classes would start tomorrow.

After getting in the car, she was still confused when thinking of the kiss just now, and she couldn’t calm down for a long time.

Men’s kisses were too hot and overbearing.

Qiao Mianmian had never experienced such a strong kiss before. Whenever Su Ze had kissed her, it had been very gentle. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

She was a little scared.

At that moment, she didn’t know how to face the man beside her.

Panic-stricken, she heard Uncle Li ask in the driver’s seat, “Master, are we going back directly?”

Mo Yesi glanced at the blushing woman next to him and said lightly, “Yes.”

After Uncle Li had clarified, he drove away.

Qiao Mianmian suddenly looked back and turned to Mo Yesi. “Where are we going now?”

Mo Yesi opened his notebook and briefly returned two words. “Back home.”

Qiao Mianmian’s expression changed. “Go home? Whose home?”

“What do you think?” As if he thought the question was funny, Mo Yesi looked up at her and smirked. “Why, we are already married, didn’t you ever think that you would be living together with me?”

Qiao Mianmian went quiet.

She really hadn’t thought about that.

Hearing how she would be living together with him, she suddenly felt panicked.

“But, I’m still going to school,” she said anxiously. “I have to live in the school dorm. Our school has rules that we can’t rent a house outside.”

At first, she had thought that since she was still studying and usually lived in the school, they wouldn’t see each other much.

Therefore, she had felt very relieved when signing her name on the marriage application.

She had thought that he was only interested in her on a whim. If they didn’t meet often, he would forget about her soon.

Mo Yesi didn’t say anything. He stared at her with his dark eyes for a few seconds, and his thin lips curled up slightly.

He seemed to have seen through her thoughts, for he closed his notebook, stretched out his long arm, and brought the petite woman beside him into his arms.

He held Qiao Mianmian’s jaw with his other hand and said near to her, “If I remember correctly, today is a weekend. You’ll only have to go to school tomorrow, no?”

The woman in his arms was so small, soft, and fragrant. Mo Yesi lowered his head and breathed in the faint fragrance in her hair. “Come back with me at night, I’ll send you to school tomorrow.”

Suddenly being held in his arms like this and sitting in this posture again, Qiao Mianmian blushed instantly.

She reached out and pushed him away. “Mo Yesi, let me go...”
