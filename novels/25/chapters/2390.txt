Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“You have to know that many boys in our class are still asking their parents for pocket money. But you can already work in the company. Qiao Chen, you’re really amazing. You’re practically my idol.”

“That’s right, Qiao Chen. You’re so amazing. We all admire you.”

“Qiao Chen, you’re amazing. You got first place in the country in the exams, and now you’re entering the company. How do you know everything? You’re an all-rounder genius.”

The boys were speechless seeing the group of girls swooning over him.

They had become invisible.

The girls only had eyes for Qiao Chen.

But they weren’t jealous.

They had to admit that Qiao Chen was more outstanding than them.

They were speechless because the girls’ motives were too obvious.

All of them wanted to be Young Madam Mo, right?

They were all fighting to get closer to Qiao Chen.

It wasn’t that they were jealous. If they were Qiao Chen, they definitely wouldn’t like any of them.

He had good looks, a good family background, and was a top student.

Such an outstanding person had to be matched with a girl as outstanding as him.

Not one of these female students was not smitten with him.

Speaking of which, it wasn’t impossible to find a female classmate worthy of Qiao Chen.

They felt that Shen Xin was pretty good. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

She was good-looking, came from a rich family, and had excellent grades.

But Qiao Chen didn’t like her. So, even if she was worthy of him, it was meaningless.

At the thought of Shen Xin, someone couldn’t help but mutter, “Eh, didn’t they say that Shen Xin was coming today? Why haven’t we seen her?”

“Yeah, why isn’t Shen Xin here?”

If Qiao Chen was the girls’ Prince Charming, then Shen Xin was the boys’ goddess.

Before Shen Xin transferred schools, almost two-thirds of the boys in the class had a crush on her.

The remaining one-third actually had a crush on her, but they hid it very well.

“Are you sure Shen Xin will be here today?”

It had been a long time since they last saw their goddess. The boys were still looking forward to her arrival.

Qiao Chen was casually chatting with someone when he heard Shen Xin’s name.

That’s right.

Everyone was here, why wasn’t Shen Xin here yet?

She said she would come.

She even told him that they would meet at the class gathering.

Although she had a bad temper and was very particular about her cards, she wasn’t someone who didn’t have a sense of time.

She was always punctual in the past.

Did something happen on the way?

Qiao Chen’s expression changed.

He took out his cell phone and quickly typed a message.

Qiao Chen: [Shen Xin, why are you not here yet?]

He added “We’re all waiting for you” before sending the message.

Not long after, his cell phone vibrated.

It was Shen Xin’s reply.

Shen Xin: [I’ve already entered the elevator, I’ll be there soon. There was a car accident on the way, so the traffic was jammed.]

Qiao Chen’s heart returned to calmness, and his eyes lost their panic.

At this moment, he suddenly heard a strange laugh. “Could it be that she doesn’t dare to come?”
