Mo Yesi was full of self-reproach. “Morning-after pills aren’t good for the body. I’m sorry for my negligence. Now you have to suffer for it.”

“Mo Yesi, are you angry?”

Qiao Mianmian detected the unhappiness on his face a moment ago.

He seemed unhappy.

Mo Yesi shook his head. “Baby, I’m not angry at you. I’m angry at myself. I should’ve thought of this sooner.”

“It’s actually not an issue if I eat it once in a while.” Mianmian was relieved to find that he wasn’t angry. “It’s only harmful to the body if I eat it often. If you don’t want me to eat it again, then you’ve got to take precautions in the future.

“Otherwise, don’t even think of touching me.”

Qiao Mianmian actually did wonder if Mo Yesi did it on purpose.

If the two times in the office were accidents.

Then what about the time in the morning.

Did he not prepare for that too?

If this was someone else, she would believe that they really forgot.

But since this was Mo Yesi...

Qiao Mianmian was worried that he would do this again in the future, so she made things a little harsher.

She was only 19.

She hadn’t graduated from university yet, nor had she carved a career for herself. She didn’t want to be a mom so soon.

Mo Yesi was very nice about it since he knew that it was wrong on his part. “Alright, I promise that this will never happen again.

“If I’m not well-prepared in the future, you can reject me.”

Mo Yesi knew that these morning-after pills weren’t that harmful if one ate it just once.

But drugs were drugs, after all.

There would be some effect on her body no matter what.

“I will surely reject you,” Qiao Mianmian said firmly. “Mo Yesi, I don’t have any plans to have a child at this point. If you want a child, you’ve got to wait for me to see some results in my career, alright?

“You’re not rushing for a child either, are you?”

Mo Yesi looked up at her. “Then, when do you plan to have a child? A year from now? Two years, or three?”

In fact, Mo Yesi himself wasn’t in a hurry to have a child.

He didn’t particularly like children.

Perhaps he even had some dislike towards them.

In his eyes, children were troublesome. He felt that raising children did not bring much joy, but came with a lot of problems.

He hadn’t had enough couple time with Qiao Mianmian yet.

Why would he want a child to be in the way?

The only reason he wanted one was to keep Qiao Mianmian with him.

He felt that having a baby would keep her heart by his side.

Qiao Mianmian said, “I don’t know yet. I don’t think I’d one want in the next couple of years. Mo Yesi, I really don’t want a child too young. But I promise you, I’ll bear you a child before you turn 30, alright?

“Plus, it’s painful to get pregnant and give birth to a child, and I’m scared. Give me some time to mentally prepare myself, okay?”

She sounded so soft and meek.

Acting coquettishly.

Mo Yesi felt his heart sway.

She had no idea how alluring she looked at this moment.

There was no problem agreeing to her not having a child right now.
