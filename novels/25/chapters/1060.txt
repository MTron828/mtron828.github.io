Chapter 1062: You’re So Pretty

Even though they already had that night.

But he was still not used to the intimacy of the opposite sex.

The girl leaned all her weight against him.

Mo Shixiu had to support her from falling.

This way, they had more physical contact.

Jiang Luoli leaned against him and shook his arm. “Mo Shixiu, my head is spinning.”

Mo Shixiu’s body was tense, and he didn’t dare to move. He said tightly, “Miss Jiang, you’re drunk. Let me send you home, alright? Have a good rest and you won’t feel so bad.”

“But I don’t wanna go home.”

Jiang Luoli bit her lip and looked up at him. Her cheeks were red and her eyes were blurred. “Mo Shixiu, I want to go to the mountain to enjoy the breeze. Can you take me there? Didn’t you say you’d take me to the mountain to see the stars? Can we go now?

“I haven’t seen the stars in a long time.

“The stars tonight must be especially beautiful.”

Mo Shixiu was stunned. “You want to go to the mountains to look at the stars?”

She actually remembered this.

“Can’t I?” Jiang Luoli was getting dizzy. She felt more and more uncomfortable, and her whole body grew soft and weak.

She pressed her temple with one hand, and her face scrunched up in pain. “I’m dizzy and uncomfortable. I want to go to the mountain to enjoy the breeze. I want to go to the mountain to look at the stars. Mo Shixiu, quickly bring me there.

“Why are you ignoring me? Didn’t you say you wanted to make me happy?”

The girl’s soft body was against him, and her soft voice rang in his ears. One of her hands was even reaching out to touch his face.

Her fair and soft fingers were like a paintbrush, lightly tracing the contours of his face. Her starry eyes were half-opened, and her blurred gaze landed on his handsome and noble face. As she looked at him, a hint of infatuation appeared in her eyes.

“Mo Shixiu, you’re so pretty.”

Jiang Luoli’s fingers slid down the man’s nose bridge and gently pressed on his soft lips.

Mo Shixiu’s expression immediately changed. His Adam’s apple bobbed as he said hoarsely, “Miss Jiang...” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

The man’s lips were thin but full.

It felt good.

Jiang Luoli looked at his glistening lips and licked her lips. “Mo Shixiu, I want to kiss you.”

His lips looked moist. It must feel good to kiss them.

Mo Shixiu didn’t react at first.

But as she got closer, his expression changed.

Mo Shixiu could feel his face heating up. His heartbeat quickened as he panicked. “Miss Jiang, you’re drunk. I’ll send you home immediately.”

Jiang Luoli’s lips were already very close to his.

He could feel her breath on his lips.

Mo Shixiu’s heart was disturbed by the warm and moist scent of alcohol. He, who had always kept a straight face no matter what happened, panicked.

He’d never been so flustered before.

He was in his thirties, but he was being teased by a 19-year-old girl.

And a drunk girl at that.
