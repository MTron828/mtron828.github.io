Chapter 1311: Don’t Overthink

Su Ze immediately turned around. His expression was still dark, but there was a hint of joy in his eyes. “Mianmian, you...”

“Don’t overthink it.” Qiao Mianmian knew what he wanted to say and interrupted him coldly. “I’m doing this on account of Uncle and Aunt Su. I don’t want them to be sad anymore. Su Ze, this is my last warning. If you don’t want the Su family to be destroyed in your hands, don’t let me see you again.”

“Are you threatening me?”

“I believe you know very well whether it’s a threat or not. Su Ze, you’re the one who caused the Su family to end up in such a state. You’re the culprit.”

With that, Qiao Mianmian walked past him.

When Qiao Mianmian entered the elevator, she heard Su Ze’s indignant shout. “Qiao Mianmian, you’ll regret it. One day, you’ll regret treating me like this. Besides me, no one has ever been true to you. They’re just playing with you.

“Qiao Mianmian, you’re an ingrate!”

...

Qiao Mianmian finally couldn’t hear his voice anymore. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

She recalled her interactions with Su Ze.

From their first meeting until now.

She couldn’t help but feel emotional.

She never thought that Su Ze would become like this one day.

Even she didn’t know if Su Ze’s original character was like this or if he changed so much because of the shock.

But no matter what, she really didn’t want to see this man anymore.

At the underground parking lot.

The bodyguard led her to a silver Lamborghini.

Qiao Mianmian walked to the car and saw the headlights flash twice. The passenger door slowly opened.

She looked inside and saw Gong Zeli sitting in the car.

He had one hand on the steering wheel, and the sleeves of his black shirt were rolled up halfway. As it was hot, the shirt’s buttons were not fully buttoned, and half of them were loose.

Gong Zeli’s skin was very fair.

But his lips were extremely red.

Coupled with his feminine and handsome face, he looked like a vampire from the Middle Ages.

According to legend, vampires were especially beautiful.

Both men and women were much more good-looking than ordinary people.

Gong Zeli’s looks matched this.

Qiao Mianmian didn’t really dislike Gong Zeli, but she definitely didn’t like him.

But from an objective point of view, she had to admit that Gong Zeli was indeed very good.

If Jiang Luoli saw him, she would definitely have another Prince Charming.

But in Qiao Mianmian’s heart, Mo Yesi was still the most handsome.

She was stunned when she saw Gong Zeli.

She hadn’t expected him to be waiting downstairs.

She thought that the bodyguards would bring her to him.

Gong Zeli looked up, and his gaze landed on her exquisite face. After a few seconds, he looked away unnaturally.

He coughed lightly. “Get in. I got someone to book a restaurant. Let’s talk over there.”

Qiao Mianmian hesitated for a while. Although Gong Zeli wasn’t a likable person and was sometimes detestable, he shouldn’t be a bad person.

She didn’t have to worry about him doing anything bad.
