Chapter 2061: An Ulterior Motive

“Hello, Chairman Mo. Are you busy right now? Am I disturbing you?”

A woman?

Qiao Mianmian pricked up her ears.

It was rare for a woman to call Mo Yesi. Only Shen Rou called him in the past.

Qiao Mianmian saw Mo Yesi frown and ask unhappily, “What’s the matter?”

“Oh, yes, it’s like this. Chairman Mo, I took a look at the proposal today and felt that there are a few areas that can be changed. The revised proposal will be better than before. So, I want to ask Chairman Mo if you have time right now. I can show you the revised proposal.”

Qiao Mianmian found the woman’s voice familiar.

She suddenly recalled something.

Wasn’t this the woman she saw in Mo Yesi’s office?

If she wasn’t mistaken, the woman was Assistant Yang.

Qiao Mianmian took out her cell phone and saw that it was 10:30 PM.

She was speechless.

Why would a woman ask a man out at such a time? She probably had an ulterior motive.

Qiao Mianmian was rather calm about a woman asking her husband out to “discuss official business”. She turned around and looked at Mo Yesi calmly, waiting to see how he would reply.

Anyway, she wasn’t worried.

After all, Mo Yesi never made her unhappy when he handled such matters.

He was always quick to cut the Gordian knot.

He even tossed Shen Rou away, whom he’d known for over 20 years.

It would definitely be easier to deal with Assistant Yang.

The next moment, Qiao Mianmian heard her husband’s cold voice as expected. “Assistant Yang, do you need me to teach you how to handle work matters? I gave you my cell phone number because it was convenient to communicate at work, not because I wanted you to call me in private.”

“Chairman Mo, I-I thought you weren’t busy.” The woman sounded flustered.

“You thought?” Mo Yesi rebuked her rudely. “Whether I’m busy or not, it’s not your personal time to call me. Assistant Yang, I’m married. If you call me at night and ask me out to discuss work, my wife will misunderstand.

“I hope this will be the last time.

“If you don’t split the time between work and private matters, I’ll get Chairman Yang to change the contract.”

“What, you’re married?! Isn’t that your girlfriend?! How could…” The woman’s shocked voice sounded from the phone.

But Mo Yesi didn’t intend to explain.

He hung up before she could finish speaking.

He looked down and met Qiao Mianmian’s eyes.

“It’s an employee arranged by a cooperative company. She just called me because of some work matters.” Mo Yesi took the initiative to confess before Qiao Mianmian could ask. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“I didn’t know she was so insensible to call at this time.”

“The woman who went to the office to look for you today?” Qiao Mianmian thought that this wasn’t being insensible. She wasn’t really asking him out to talk about work. It was just an excuse.
