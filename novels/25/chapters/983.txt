Chapter 984: What a Hateful Move

“Both Ah Si and Old Madam are unhappy with me. She thinks that I’m not magnanimous enough to accept my own daughter-in-law. But if my daughter-in-law was you, there wouldn’t be so many problems.

“I can’t accept such a scheming and impure woman as my daughter-in-law!”

At this point, Madam Mo looked at Shen Rou regretfully and unwillingly. “Rourou, if only you were my daughter-in-law. Then, all the conflicts wouldn’t exist anymore. What do you think Ah Si is doing? He doesn’t like this good girl, but he likes that...

“What else does that woman have other than her good looks? Rourou, you’re so outstanding, you surpass her in all aspects. Ah Si must be blind.

“I watched the two of you grow up together. I thought that if the Mo and Shen families were to get together through marriage, we would be even closer in the future. Who knew that Ah Si would lose his mind to a woman from a small family and get married to her without a word?

“This move is too hateful. I couldn’t stop it even if I wanted to.”

As Madam Mo spoke, her chest heaved again.

Shen Rou’s eyes flickered, and she quickly reached out to caress her heart a few times. She looked worried and anxious. “Aunt Mo, calm down. Don’t anger yourself because of someone who doesn’t deserve it. Now that things have already been decided, it’s useless to be angry. It’s better to...”

“No.”

Madam Mo grabbed her hand and said excitedly, “Rourou, as long as you haven’t given up on Ah Si, it’s not too late. Aunt Mo said she’d help you, you can’t back off now.”

Shen Rou frowned and looked troubled. “But Aunt Mo, it’s not that I want to give up, but it’s really impossible between Ah Si and me.

“I also thought that as long as I persevered, as long as I didn’t give up, we might still have a chance. But...” Shen Rou suddenly choked on her words as her eyes reddened.

She said sadly, “Aunt Mo, there’s something I’m hiding from you. I don’t dare to say it. I’m afraid that if I do, Aunt Mo won’t like me anymore. You’ll think I’m a bad girl.

“Aunt Mo is like my mother to me. If you stop liking me one day, I’ll be sad.”

Madam Mo saw that her eyes were red and quickly took out a handkerchief from her bag to wipe her tears. “Rourou, what’s wrong with you? Don’t cry, tell Aunt Mo what happened first. No matter what happened, Aunt Mo won’t dislike you.”

Madam Mo really liked Shen Rou.

She really wanted another daughter.

But because of her health, her wish never came true.

Shen Rou had always been close to her since she was a child. She was respectful and obedient in front of her, and she was loved by everyone. Although she didn’t treat her as her own daughter, Madam Mo’s love for her was real. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

She really wanted Shen Rou to be her daughter-in-law.

In her opinion, no one was more suitable than Shen Rou to be the Second Young Madam of the Mo family.

She’d always thought that the two families could get married.

Until Mo Yesi suddenly brought Qiao Mianmian home and told them about their marriage...
