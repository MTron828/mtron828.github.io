How could he do this?

She didn’t even dare to move in his arms.

“Baby, you can feel it, right? I feel very distressed now, help me...” His voice became muffled and unspeakably sultry. Just listening to his voice was enough to make Qiao Mianmian’s heart tremble.

Her face turned red and hot, but she didn’t dare to move. Her eyes were flushed with anxiety as she stuttered, “You- You can solve it yourself.”

Didn’t men know how to please themselves already?

He could do that too.

Why did she have to help him?

“Honey.” The man buried his head in her neck and rubbed against her, whining. “I don’t want to solve it by myself. Help me.”

Hearing him call her “Honey” was enough to make her heart jump wildly again.

...

In the end, she still failed to resist Mo Yesi’s repeated temptations and pitiful expressions. She ended up using another method to solve the problem for him.

After washing her hands, the man carried her out of the bathroom. Her face was still red and her eyes were full of complaints.

She shouldn’t have promised him!

Her hands... were so sore.

Moreover, if she hadn’t urged him repeatedly, he wouldn’t have ended it so soon.

If she hadn’t urged him, according to his normal timing, her hands would probably cramp.

Mo Yesi was full of satisfaction at this moment.

Although this method wasn’t completely satisfactory, it was much better than holding back.

He was finally not so uncomfortable now.

The satisfied man glanced at the resentful petite woman in his arms and happily smirked. He coaxed softly, “Baby, are your hands still sore? I’ll massage them for you?”

When Qiao Mianmian thought of the shameful scene just now, she felt both ashamed and annoyed. She didn’t want to talk to him at all.

He was... too despicable!

He looked so innocent and restrained, but during that time, he changed into a completely different person and frightened her with his passion.

She ignored him, but Mo Yesi didn’t mind at all.

At such a time, a man’s patience was incredible.

He carried her to the bed and was about to place her on it when there was a knock on the door.

“Young Madam, Young Master. Lunch is ready.”

Lei En’s voice sounded outside the door. “Mr. Qiao Chen is waiting for you to have lunch together.”

Mo Yesi stopped and turned around while holding her.

He looked down at her and smirked. “Baby, are you hungry? Shall we go down and eat?”

Still annoyed by the incident, Qiao Mianmian glared at him and said, “Put me down, I can walk by myself. I don’t want you to carry me.”

Qiao Chen was also there.

She was too embarrassed to let him carry her down.

Otherwise, Qiao Chen would tease her about it again.

Most importantly, Qiao Mianmian really didn’t want to talk to him now.

At the sight of him, she couldn’t help remembering what had just happened in the bathroom.

Mo Yesi also knew that she was still awkward about such matters and didn’t want to annoy her further, so he immediately put her down.

As soon as her feet landed on the ground, she walked quickly out the door, as if someone was chasing her from behind.

She rushed out of the bedroom without looking back.

Staring at the petite escaping figure, Mo Yesi stood in place with the corner of his lips curled up slightly. A gloomy light flashed at the bottom of his deep eyes.

Heh, she thought she could escape.

He was only letting her go for a while.

When the day came where he could touch her again, he would return with greater intensity.
