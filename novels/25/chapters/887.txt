Chapter 888: Things Weren’t Going the Worst

“Doctor, be gentle. Look, Little Tu’s sweating. Are you hurting him?

“Doctor, why aren’t you saying anything? How’s my Little Tu’s condition? Is it very serious? He can’t recover from his injuries, right? Don’t scare me. We have money. No matter how much it costs, you have to treat his injuries.”

When Qiao Mianmian entered the doctor’s diagnosis room, she heard Michael’s nagging.

The doctor’s assistant probably felt that Michael was too noisy and couldn’t take it anymore. He couldn’t help but say, “Mister, please don’t be anxious, alright? Doctor Zhao is currently treating Mr. Tu. If you speak beside him, it will affect his judgment.”

Even Tu Yilei felt that he was too noisy and couldn’t stand him anymore. He turned to look at him and frowned. “Michael, be quiet. How are you going to let the doctor see me like this? I’m in so much pain, and you’re still arguing non-stop. Are you worried about me, or are you deliberately torturing me?”

“Little Tu Tu, I...”

“Alright, let’s talk later.”

“... Alright, doctor. I won’t talk anymore. Quickly take a look at him.” Michael looked at Tu Yilei’s bloody hand and shut his mouth.

The doctor checked Tu Yilei again.

After a while, he took off his gloves and said, “I handled it well when I first arrived at the hospital, so the burn on the back of Mr. Tu’s hand isn’t very serious.”

When Michael heard this, he couldn’t help but ask, “You said that the burn on the back of Little Tu’s hand isn’t very serious. Does it mean that it can be healed?”

The doctor nodded. “It should be treatable.”

“Gosh, thank God, thank God!” Michael held his hands together in joy.

Tu Yilei heaved a sigh of relief when he heard what the doctor said.

He didn’t regret rushing over to block the acid for Qiao Mianmian.

If he had another choice, he would still do it.

But regret was one thing.

It was impossible for him not to feel anything when his hand was so badly burned.

He would be sad too.

He was worried that his career would be affected.

He wasn’t a strong-willed person. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Outside the treatment room.

Qiao Mianmian heaved a sigh of relief when she heard the doctor’s words. It was as if the burden in her heart had been lifted.

The depression in her heart vanished.

Fortunately, she heard the good news.

Things didn’t turn out the worst.

If the burn on the back of Tu Yilei’s hand couldn’t be treated and it left a scar in the future, she would probably feel guilty for the rest of her life.

“This is good news. As long as it can be treated.” Bai Yusheng glanced at Qiao Mianmian and walked in first. “Doctor, treat him well. He’s an artiste. If his exposed skin is scarred, it will affect him.

“I’ll have to trouble you guys to spend more time on this.”

The doctor looked up and saw that it was Bai Yusheng. His attitude became more respectful as he quickly replied, “Mr. Bai, don’t worry. We will do our best to treat the burn on the back of Mr. Tu’s hand.”

“Mm.” Bai Yusheng nodded. “I trust you.”

Tu Yilei saw Bai Yusheng and instinctively looked towards the door. He smiled at Qiao Mianmian when he saw her. “Miss Qiao, you’re here too.”
