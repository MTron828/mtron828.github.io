Chapter 960: Get Lost, Stay Away From Me

He was probably right.

No matter how much a man liked a woman, the day would come when he wanted to let her go.

No matter how much he liked her, it was a hopeless situation.

Gong Zeli had persevered for so many years.

He was probably tired now.

Gong Zeli pursed his lips and turned to look at the sea. “In any case, we’re practically strangers from now on. Don’t mention her if there’s nothing. I don’t want to hear anything about her.”

“... Alright.”

Yan Shaoqing nodded. “I know, I know. In the future... I’ll try my best not to mention her in front of you. But are you really going to be strangers? With so many feelings, it’d be a pity if you were to be strangers.”

“I don’t know.”

Gong Zeli narrowed his eyes. “At least, for now, I don’t want to see her again.” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Whenever he saw Shen Rou, he would be reminded of how she’d lied to him.

He couldn’t possibly not mind.

But they had been friends for so many years, and the Shen and Gong families were long-time friends. He couldn’t do anything to Shen Rou.

He couldn’t punish her or forgive her...

Then, he’d never see her again.

At least, when he didn’t see her, he wouldn’t think that she’d lied to him.

“Since you’re in a bad mood, you should come out and relax.” Yan Shaoqing waved to a young model standing not too far behind him, gesturing for her to come over. When she came over, he used his eyes to signal the young model to accompany Gong Zeli.

The model looked at Gong Zeli’s handsome and feminine face and immediately blushed. She walked towards him and said coquettishly, “Young Master Gong, what’s the point of drinking alone? Let Shasha drink with you.”

Accompanying these rich second-generation heirs was a huge gain for these young models.

Especially for rich second-generation heirs like Gong Zeli and Yan Shaoqing, their looks were comparable to celebrities.

He was so much better than the rich and powerful men they used to spend time with.

Although they couldn’t be their official girlfriends, it was still a blessing to have a long-term lover.

After all, both of them were famous for being generous.

Unexpectedly, before the model even reached Gong Zeli, she was frightened by his cold gaze and dared not move forward.

She called out fearfully, “Young Master Gong...”

Gong Zeli looked at her with disgust. “Get lost, stay away from me.”

The model wanted to seduce him, but before she could do it, her face turned pale and she started trembling uncontrollably.

She was afraid that Gong Zeli would lose his temper.

Everyone knew that the Young Master of the Gong family was rich, powerful, and good-looking. He could be said to be the perfect lover for many women.

Unfortunately, no one was perfect.

Just his bad temper alone was enough to scare many people.

She couldn’t even control her emotions. He sounded so scary.

Yan Shaoqing looked at the trembling model and waved her away.

The model turned around and left quickly.

After she left, Yan Shaoqing looked at Gong Zeli with a frown. “Fourth Bro, you scared her just now.”
