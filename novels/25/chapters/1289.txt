Chapter 1290: Unprecedented Gentleness

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Mo Yesi is very outstanding and is worthy of our Little Seven. But what’s the point of being outstanding? The most important thing is to know how to take care of others.

“I’d rather Little Seven find a man who isn’t as good as him but values her.”

“Then, you can be even more rest assured.” Bai Yusheng narrowed his eyes and smiled. “Your son-in-law definitely dotes on your daughter. I’ve known Mo Yesi for so many years, but I’ve never seen him care so much about anyone.

“I’m not worried about Mianmian marrying him.” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

...

Qiao Mianmian woke up and received a message from Bai Yusheng.

The male lead had already been decided. If nothing went wrong, the shoot would start tomorrow after everyone was back.

Bai Yusheng told her to prepare well. The male lead was definitely capable.

After Qiao Mianmian saw Bai Yusheng’s post, she immediately searched for the new male lead on Weibo.

She was shocked when she found it.

She was pleasantly surprised.

Bai Yusheng’s new male lead was actually an actor she’d always admired.

He was an A-list celebrity.

He was considered young in the industry, but many people addressed him as “Brother”.

He was only 27 years old but had already won three Best Actor awards.

It could be said that the new male lead was stronger and more influential than Tu Yilei.

Most importantly, Qiao Mianmian’s dream was to act with Qin Han one day.

Bai Yusheng had actually fulfilled her wish.

She was about to close Weibo when she saw a familiar name.

It was a piece of financial news. The news reported that the Su Corporation had just been acquired by the largest company in Yuncheng City, the Mo Corporation.

Qiao Mianmian was stunned for a few seconds.

She continued reading.

After reading the entire news report, she didn’t feel much. Other than the initial shock, she felt that everything else was normal.

This was Mo Yesi’s style.

First, he acquired the Su Corporation overnight. Then, he appointed Young Master Su Ze as the vice president of a branch company and got him to report to that branch company.

The title of the Vice-President of a branch of the Mo Corporation didn’t sound bad.

But that branch was in Country F.

Country F was a place no one wanted to go to. It wasn’t as exaggerated as a bird not pooping, but it was pretty much the same.

Hence, even though Su Ze was said to be the vice president, he would definitely suffer in the future.

After Qiao Mianmian saw the news, she guessed that it must be Mo Yesi’s doing.

She was about to ask Mo Yesi when her cell phone rang.

It was an unknown number.

Qiao Mianmian picked it up, but Madam Mo’s voice came from the other end.

Her tone was unprecedentedly gentle.

Madam Mo asked her to return to the Mo Residence. She said that she had something important to discuss with her.

In the end, she even said that Old Madam missed her and wanted her to go back for lunch.

She hung up.

Qiao Mianmian thought that since Old Madam was around in broad daylight, she wasn’t afraid of Madam Mo causing trouble.

She sent Mo Yesi a WeChat message and got someone to send her to the Mo Residence.

...

At the Mo Residence.

Uncle Zhang came out to pick her up.

Qiao Mianmian was relieved to see him.
