Chapter 1095: Are You Going Back With Me?

Mo Yesi stopped the car and reached out to gently hold one of her hands. He held her palm and comforted her. “If it was someone else, I can’t guarantee the success rate, nor can I guarantee that there won’t be any risk. But the surgery will be personally handled by me. I promise you that there won’t be any risk.

“I’ll make Chen Chen a normal person. Trust me, baby.”

Qiao Mianmian’s worry and anxiety slowly dissipated under his firm promise.

She believed him.

If he said there was no problem, then there was definitely no problem.

Qiao Mianmian felt much better when she thought about how Qiao Chen would soon become like a normal person and would no longer have to worry about his heart attacks.

She looked at the man beside her and smiled happily. “Yes, Mo Yesi, I believe you.”

...

Two minutes later.

Mo Yesi’s car stopped at the entrance of Yun Cheng First Middle School.

Qiao Chen recognized the car.

He walked over just as the car pulled up.

Seeing him walk over, Qiao Mianmian lowered the window and waved at him. “Chen Chen, get in.”

After Qiao Chen got into the car, he called her Sister and Brother-in-law.

Mo Yesi replied gently, “Your sister and I haven’t decided what to eat tonight. If you have anything you want to eat, we’ll take you there.”

The high school that Qiao Chen attended was a closed management model.

Other than weekends, the students usually stayed on campus.

Moreover, he wasn’t allowed to leave the school during his stay.

He usually ate at the school canteen. Although the food in the canteen wasn’t bad, he was sick of eating it every day.

He could finally improve his meals today, so he didn’t stand on ceremony with his sister and brother-in-law. Instead, he told them about a rotisserie that he had always wanted to visit but was reluctant to.

The cost of a barbeque restaurant was quite high for most people.

But to Mo Yesi, it wasn’t a high expenditure.

He wasn’t interested in barbeque. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

I don’t think it’s healthy.

But since it was something his brother-in-law wanted to eat, no matter how much he disliked it, he had to accompany the siblings.

After confirming the location, he was about to ask Wei Zheng to book a table in advance when he received a call from Madam Mo.

Mo Yesi answered the call for a few minutes. After hanging up, he frowned and said, “I might not be able to go to the barbecue restaurant tonight. I’ll have to go another day.”

Qiao Chen said sensibly, “Brother-in-law. If you have something to do, go on. We can eat the roasted meat anytime.”

His brother-in-law was someone who did great things.

He naturally had to prioritize his career.

He could understand!

“What’s the matter?” Qiao Mianmian also thought that he had encountered something at work, so she said very considerately, “If you have work to do, go do your thing. I’ll have dinner with Chen Chen tonight.”

“It’s not about work.”

Mo Yesi looked at Qiao Chen through the rearview mirror and said, “Mom called just now. She asked me to come home for dinner. She said that Grandma hasn’t seen me for a few days and misses me.”

Qiao Mianmian fell silent.

At the mention of Madam Mo, all she could think of was unhappy memories.

Mo Yesi also knew that Madam Mo had gone overboard in some of her actions, causing his wife to suffer a lot.

He looked at Qiao Mianmian in silence for a while before saying, “Do you want to go back with me? Grandma hasn’t seen you in a while, and she was asking about you on the phone.”
