After hearing her words, Tu Yilei lowered his eyes and remained silent for a while before nodding.

Qiao Mianmian talked to him about her future plans.

After about half an hour, she was ready to leave.

“Miss Qiao, can I ask you a personal question?”

Qiao Mianmian was already at the door when Tu Yilei suddenly called out to her.

Qiao Mianmian stopped and turned to look at him. “What does Senior Tu want to ask me?”

After hesitating for a few seconds, Tu Yilei met her gaze and asked softly, “Miss Qiao, is your boyfriend... good to you? Are you happy with him?”

Qiao Mianmian was a little surprised. “Senior Tu...”

Tu Yilei immediately said, “If Miss Qiao doesn’t want to answer, you can pretend that I didn’t ask.”

Qiao Mianmian felt that it was a good opportunity to clarify things with him.

If he really had any feelings for her, he could give up on her earlier.

After pondering for a moment, she said, “Senior Tu, do you want to hear the truth?”

Tu Yilei: “Of course.”

Qiao Mianmian smiled and nodded. “He’s very good to me, and I’m very happy to be with him. Actually, there’s something that even my manager doesn’t know, but I think Senior Tu will definitely keep it a secret for me, so I’ve decided to tell you.

“Senior Tu, actually, I’m already married. My boyfriend is my husband. Because I signed a contract with the company, our relationship cannot be made public for the time being.”

Tu Yilei’s expression changed as he looked at her in disbelief. “You’re already married?”

“Mm.” Qiao Mianmian nodded calmly.

Tu Yilei maintained his stunned expression and did not speak for a long time.

His already haggard face turned even paler.

...

After seeing Tu Yilei, Qiao Mianmian flew back to Yun Cheng.

After getting off the plane, she followed Wei Zheng to the Mo Corporation.

When she arrived at the Mo Corporation, she realized that Mo Yesi wasn’t in the company. Instead, he had gone out to talk to someone.

Qiao Mianmian was waiting for him in his office.

She woke up early in the morning and flew back and forth for a few more hours, waiting and falling asleep in his office.

When she woke up again, she opened her eyes and found herself sleeping on the small bed in the lounge.

She knew that Mo Yesi was back.

She slept for more than three hours and felt much more rested after waking up.

She walked out of the lounge and saw Mo Yesi sitting at his desk, his eyes focused on the computer screen and his fingers typing furiously on the keyboard.

He was clearly working very seriously.

But as soon as Qiao Mianmian walked out of the lounge, he turned around and looked straight at her. Before he could say anything, a doting smile appeared in his eyes. “Baby, you’re awake. Did you sleep well?”

Qiao Mianmian walked towards him.

She was still half a meter away from him when he reached out and pulled her into his arms.

She fell onto the man’s lap and his strong arms wrapped around her waist.

Before she could say anything, he pinched her chin and kissed her.

He pressed his warm and moist lips against hers and kissed her slowly and gently.

The kiss wasn’t intense at all.

Qiao Mianmian, on the other hand, was in his arms, moaning softly.

She was forced to endure it with her eyes closed and gradually started to respond.

Mo Yesi kissed her for a few minutes before ending the kiss unhappily.

He was afraid that if he continued kissing her, he wouldn’t be able to stop there.
