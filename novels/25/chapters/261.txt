He hadn’t even greeted her just now.

In the past, he would never be like this.

His attitude made Shen Rou feel sad and frightened, and her resentment towards Qiao Mianmian deepened.

She felt like Mo Yesi’s changes were all because of Qiao Mianmian.

Before Qiao Mianmian, they had gotten along so well.

But now that this woman appeared, everything had changed.

“Ah Si, are you still angry? It’s all my fault...” Shen Rou blinked and her eyes reddened. “I told you to come out for dinner that day. If it weren’t for my welcome dinner, it wouldn’t...”

“It has nothing to do with you.”

She was, after all, a girl he had known for more than 20 years. Mo Yesi’s tone was softer as he gazed at her. “I don’t blame you, so don’t overthink it.”

“Really?” Shen Rou felt wronged. At the thought of how Mo Yesi had ignored her just now, she wanted to cry out of grievance. “I thought you were still angry with me.”

Mo Yesi was especially patient towards Qiao Mianmian, but his patience didn’t last long for others.

After comforting Shen Rou with a few words, he was about to leave. “I already said so, so don’t think too much about it. This is a matter between me and Fourth Bro, don’t get involved anymore.”

After that, he held Qiao Mianmian and turned to leave.

Shen Rou stood on the ground, watching him walk away slowly with red eyes.

He had really changed.

Even if he said he wasn’t angry with her, his attitude towards her was still a little alienated.

He was deliberately alienating her.

Before, he had never been like this.

Was he deliberately alienating her to show Qiao Mianmian?

Did Qiao Mianmian make him do that?

In just one minute, Shen Rou had a thousand thoughts in her mind.

In the end, she put all the blame on Qiao Mianmian.

Mo Yesi had changed after getting married.

If he hadn’t gotten married, if he was still single now, they wouldn’t have become like this. They would get along as they did in the past and live happily and harmoniously.

Her resentful eyes couldn’t be concealed.

For the first time in her life, she was jealous of a woman.

“Rou Rou?” Someone sounded confused behind her. “What happened between you and Ah Si?”

Madam Mo looked confused after seeing the scene just now.

Blinking, Shen Rou hurriedly concealed the emotion in her eyes and turned around. She smiled casually to Madam Mo. “Aunt Mo, it’s nothing. It was just a little misunderstanding. I’ve already cleared the air with Ah Si.”

Madam Mo looked at her red eyes and frowned. “What happened? What did Ah Si and Xiao Gong argue about? Was their fight serious?”

The Old Madam heard their conversation and glanced at them.

“What happened between Ah Si and Xiao Gong? What are you talking about?”

“It’s nothing, Grandma Mo.” Shen Rou turned around and smiled at the Old Madam’s questioning eyes. “It’s a small thing, you needn’t worry about it. It’s late, Grandma Mo. You have the habit of taking a nap, right? I’ll help you back to your room to rest.”

After staring at her for a few seconds, the Old Madam nodded. “Okay, I’ll go back to rest.”

Shen Rou immediately went over.
