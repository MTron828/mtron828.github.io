Chapter 360:

What Kind of Impressive Figure

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Glancing over from the corner of her eyes, the other parts of their faces also looked alike.

It was just that Qiao Chen was a little thinner and had no meat on his face. Otherwise, with a little more meat to support it, they would look even more alike.

At the sight of Mo Yesi patiently introducing the performance and structure of each car to Qiao Chen without the slightest hint of impatience, Qiao Mianmian pursed her lips and felt very relieved.

When she married him, she hadn’t expected him to treat Qiao Chen so well and was fine as long as he treated him normally.

But he was really good.

He treated Qiao Chen far better than she expected.

He said he would love her and her family, and he really did so.

Regardless of whether his kindness to Qiao Mianmian came out of sincerity, she still felt very touched and happy.

She increasingly felt like this husband was really good. Marrying Mo Yesi was a choice she would never regret.

She was quite satisfied with her current life.

She thought that if Mo Yesi didn’t cheat on her by having a one-night stand or engage in domestic violence in the future, she probably wouldn’t divorce him.

Unless he regretted it and wanted to leave.

“Wow, brother-in-law, this car is so cool. A good car is indeed different.

“I already thought this car was super cool when I saw it in a magazine before. But the real thing is a hundred times better! Brother-in-law, you’re too awesome. This is a global limited-edition car and can’t be bought with money, but you actually have one.

“No more than two people in the whole of Country A can get this car, right?”

Qiao Chen was young, and his emotions surged and receded quickly.

At this moment, his mind was focused on the global limited-edition Bugatti Veyron. His previously low spirits had all but been swept away, replaced with vigor and shining eyes.

To finally drive the luxury car he dreamed of, he felt like he was in a dream.

What kind of impressive figure was his brother-in-law to have gotten such a difficult car?

He wasn’t dreaming, was he?

“Chen Chen, calm down.” Qiao Mianmian nervously glanced at him stiffly. “Concentrate on driving, don’t get too excited.”

She didn’t know what Mo Yesi was thinking. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

How could he actually let Qiao Chen drive this car?

Qiao Chen indeed had a driver’s license, but he hadn’t touched a car for a year since he fell ill.

He had never touched a luxury car like the Bugatti Veyron before.

Although Qiao Mianmian didn’t know much about it, she knew how shocking the price of this car must be.

Qiao Chen also said there were only two of them in Country A?

With such an expensive car, wasn’t he worried that Qiao Chen’s crappy driving skills would bump it up?

Qiao Mianmian felt like he was too lenient towards Qiao Chen.

“Sister, don’t worry. Brother-in-law’s car is so valuable, I wouldn’t dare to lose focus.” Qiao Chen was afraid of bumping this limited-edition Bugatti Veyron worth tens of millions, so he drove particularly slowly.

He drove it like a newbie.

Glancing at Qiao Mianmian’s nervous expression, Mo Yesi turned and comforted her with a smile. “Don’t worry. Since I let him drive it, I’m not afraid of bumping it. Insurance is enough, I won’t ask him to pay for the maintenance fees.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

She glared at him. “I didn’t mean that. Also, even if you have insurance, we shouldn’t casually bump it up. Insurance premiums are also very expensive. What if Chen Chen doesn’t take it seriously and really bump it?”
