Chapter 769: Your Jealous Lover Can Even Eat You

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“The female lead role has been given to you, and now the third female role has been vacated. I haven’t thought of anyone suitable for the third female role yet. Moreover, you aren’t familiar with the female lead role yet. You should familiarize yourself with the script first.”

“Mm.”

Qiao Mianmian felt like she was dreaming.

No.

Even in her dreams, she had never dreamed of such a good thing.

Not far away.

When the crew and actors saw Bai Yusheng petting Qiao Mianmian’s head, they exchanged glances.

Director Bai and that newbie... were already together?

They were already so intimate.

It seemed like Director Bai really liked this newbie.

He didn’t even bother to look at the other actresses who tried to seduce him.

But now, he seemed to dote on this newbie.

In the future, they had to be more polite to her.

If she had that kind of luck, she might even become the Director’s wife.

Everyone was speculating that they were already dating. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

But the two of them had no idea.

“Big Brother Bai, it’s all because of me that Mo Yesi got someone to expose Huang Yilin’s scandals. Now that the female lead is going to be replaced, the filming for the past few days is going to be dropped. The financial losses must be huge.”

Qiao Mianmian said apologetically, “I know it’s just an apology, but...”

“You don’t have to apologize to me.” Bai Yusheng raised his brows and looked at her. “Do you think I’ll let myself be at a disadvantage? Huang Yilin caused such a mess and affected the entire production crew. She has to compensate me for the breach of contract. The compensation is enough to offset the other fees.”

Compensation fees?

Qiao Mianmian widened her eyes in shock. “She has to pay the compensation fee?”

She thought Bai Yusheng would compensate Huang Yilin instead.

After all, he had changed Huang Yilin’s female lead role.

In the end, it was Huang Yilin who had to pay the compensation?

“Of course, that’s what happened in the contract. If the artistes have a negative image during the shoot and the entire show is affected, I have the right to terminate the contract and ask for compensation.”

Qiao Mianmian widened her eyes even more.

She hadn’t noticed this when she was looking at the contract.

It turned out that the scandals during the shoot were actually paid for the breach of contract?

Then, her scandal with Tu Yilei...

She suddenly felt unwell.

Was she going to pay the compensation too?

She panicked. “Brother Bai, then I...”

“Scared?” Bai Yusheng knew what she was thinking and couldn’t help but laugh. “Of course, you don’t have to pay the compensation fee. Your scandal with Tu Yilei is different from Huang Yilin’s.”

“Her image has dropped drastically after the scandals were exposed. I can’t use her as the female lead anymore. Although I’m not in need of money, I’m not a charitable person. I don’t want to lose money because of her.”

Qiao Mianmian heaved a sigh of relief.

She patted her chest. “Thank goodness, thank goodness. You scared me.”

Bai Yusheng was amused. “What are you worried about? You’re worried that I’ll make you pay the compensation fee?”

“Uh, yes.”

“If you really have a scandal as big as Huang Yilin’s, you won’t have to worry about compensation anymore. That jealous lover of yours will eat you up.”
