“I’ll do whatever you ask me to.”

“Very good. Wait for my arrangements.”

…

Along the way, Old Madam called and asked Mo Yesi and Qiao Mianmian to go back.

She said she had something to tell them.

After the call, Mo Yesi got Uncle Li to change the route.

Qiao Mianmian looked at Mo Yesi uneasily. “Grandma called? What did she say? Did Grandma learn about the Mo Corporation and the Gong Corporation breaking ties?”

“I think so.” Mo Yesi pondered for a while and then said, “It’s such a big deal, it’s impossible for Grandma not to know. She probably wants me to tell her what happened.”

Qiao Mianmian felt even more uneasy.

If Old Madam knew that it was because of her, would she become a femme fatale in her eyes?

After all, the relationship between the Gong and Mo families had always been good.

But now this happened because of her.

Qiao Mianmian still cared about Old Madam’s opinion of her.

“Then, if Grandma knows it’s because of me…” she said worriedly.

“Are you afraid that Grandma will blame you?”

“Mm, I don’t want Grandma to dislike me.”

“Didn’t I tell you that Grandma isn’t this kind of person? If she knows the reason, she won’t say anything. Moreover, I’ll think of another reason to tell Grandma. I won’t let her blame you.

“Don’t worry, I’ll settle this.”

“Alright.” Qiao Mianmian felt more at ease with Mo Yesi’s promise.

…

“Second Young Master, Second Young Madam.”

When they arrived at the Mo Residence, Uncle Zhang came out to welcome them.

“How’s Grandma doing recently?” Mo Yesi held Qiao Mianmian’s hand as he walked into the living room.

Uncle Zhang followed behind them and smiled. “Old Madam has been doing well recently. She’s eating well and sleeping well. The doctor gave her a checkup yesterday and said that Old Madam gained a few pounds.”

Mo Yesi smiled. “Is that so? That’s good. You have to pay more attention to her.”

“Yes, Second Young Master. Don’t worry. We’ll do our best to take good care of Old Madam.”

They entered the living room.

“Old Madam, Madam, Second Young Master and Second Young Madam are back.”

Old Madam and Madam Mo were sitting in the living room. Madam Mo didn’t look too good. When she heard Uncle Zhang’s voice, she looked up at Qiao Mianmian sharply.

“Grandma, Mom.” Mo Yesi held Qiao Mianmian’s hand and walked over. He smiled and said, “Grandma, what’s the rush? You wanted Mianmian and me to come back immediately. Is everything alright at home?”

“Don’t jinx it. The house is fine, what could happen?” Old Madam glanced at him and smiled. “Can’t it be that Grandma misses you and wants to see you?”

“Of course. Grandma, just say the word and I’ll bring Mianmian back to see you.”

“You brat, you only know how to talk nonsense with me.” Old Madam was very happy to see her grandson and granddaughter-in-law return.

Qiao Mianmian was still a little uneasy.

She was worried that Old Madam would be unhappy when she returned.

But Old Madam didn’t look angry at all. Instead, she was full of smiles.

She heaved a sigh of relief.

Old Madam didn’t look like she was going to condemn them.
