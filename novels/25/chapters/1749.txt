Chapter 1752: I’ll Marry Her

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Your two sons are adults. Even if you’re their mother, you have no right to interfere in their love life. Luoli is my best friend. I won’t let you hurt her again.

“I think you know your two sons better than I do. If you continue being so stubborn, I’m sure you know the consequences.”

Madam Mo’s expression stiffened.

After a while, she gritted her teeth and said, “Continue being stubborn? You want me to let Jiang Luoli and Shixiu be together? I’m telling you, this is impossible. I’ll never accept the Jiang Family.

“Shixiu’s future is limitless. If he runs for President, his future wife will definitely be a noble daughter from a prestigious family. That girl from the Jiang Family? What right does she have to be with Shixiu? Since you mentioned her, then tell her that if she knows her place, she should take the initiative to leave Shixiu. Otherwise, I won’t be so gentle next time.”

“So, you really did it last time?” Qiao Mianmian’s expression darkened.

Madam Mo sneered. “That’s right, I did it. I’ve said it before, I will never agree to that girl surnamed Jiang being with Shixiu. If she thinks Shixiu is interested in her and can take the opportunity to marry him, then she’s wrong.”

Qiao Mianmian was about to flare up when she heard a voice from outside.

“Is that so? So you really did it.”

Madam Mo’s expression changed, and she quickly turned around.

Qiao Mianmian looked towards the door in shock.

Mo Shixiu stood at the door with a dark expression. He had obviously heard what Madam Mo said.

Shocked, Madam Mo was stunned for a while before murmuring, “Shixiu, weren’t you overseas? Why are you here?”

Mo Shixiu didn’t answer her.

He walked into the ward with a dark expression. “I don’t need anyone to agree to my relationship with Luoli. I know what kind of partner I should find in the future, and I don’t need anyone to worry about me. Mom, my wife is someone who will spend the rest of her life with me. This person will be chosen by me, not you.

“Whether you like Luoli or not, I’ve already decided on her.

“I’ll marry her.” Mo Shixiu’s tone was firm as he looked at Madam Mo’s awful expression. “It’s best if you can accept it. Even if you don’t, don’t do anything to hurt Luoli.

“Otherwise, your son might do something to upset you.”

“You want to marry Jiang Luoli?” Madam Mo was furious. “Are you crazy? Do you know what you’re saying?”

Mo Shixiu looked at her and said calmly, “I know very well what I’m talking about. Mom, I haven’t liked anyone for 30 years. If she wasn’t the person I wanted, do you think I’d casually date her?

“You know my personality. I’m telling you this because I don’t want things to worsen. Luoli doesn’t have a good family background, but I don’t need that. In the future, I’ll be her best family background.

“Because you’re my mother, and because Luoli was lucky and didn’t get hurt, I won’t pursue what happened previously. But if there’s a next time, your son can only be unfilial.”
