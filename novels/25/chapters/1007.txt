Chapter 1008: She Hated That Feeling of Losing Herself

“Someone I know? Who is it?”

“... Mo Shixiu, your husband’s brother.”

“Cough, cough, cough!”

Qiao Mianmian coughed violently.

She coughed until her face was red and her eyes widened in disbelief. “You said... who?”

She must have heard wrongly.

How could it be... Mo Shixiu? Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Jiang Luoli looked at her reaction and sighed. “You think it’s incredible too, right? Actually, I still find it unbelievable, as if I’m dreaming. Do you know how I felt when I saw him?

“I thought I was hallucinating.

“He’s Mo Shixiu. How could the person with me that night be... him?

“He told me that he went to his friend’s party that night. In the end, he was set up by someone. Someone wanted to take a video of his private life so that his election would be affected. Someone had already arranged for another woman for him, but he accidentally met me.

“He also said that I did him a huge favor. Hence, he felt that 50 million wasn’t enough. He hoped that I could make other requests.”

She swore.

That night, she really said those words in a moment of folly.

She really wanted Mo Shixiu.

If this man could become her boyfriend, she would smile even in her sleep.

But even though she drooled over him, she knew very well what kind of condition she was in.

It was alright to joke around, but she didn’t dare to expect too much.

The gap between them was the kind that could be seen from the start.

No matter how much she coveted this man, she dared to go against him.

She knew very well that a man like Mo Shixiu would definitely be addicted to it.

An addiction that was hard to get rid of.

She wasn’t afraid of anything, but she was afraid that she would fall.

She dared to touch anything except her feelings.

This was because once someone touched it and fell for it, they would no longer be themselves.

She hated the feeling of losing herself.

“Baby, what do you think I should do?” Jiang Luoli had never been so annoyed before. “I never thought of making him my boyfriend. We’re from two different worlds, we’re not suitable for each other.”

Qiao Mianmian thought about it for a while before asking seriously, “Luo Luo, do you not want to be with him because you feel that you are not suited to each other? If we exclude his identity and he wants to date you, would you still feel the same way?”

Jiang Luoli thought about it seriously for a while before replying, “Baby, do you know that if he wasn’t Mo Shixiu, even if he was just a rich second-generation heir, I think we could give it a try.

“But, he’s Mo Shixiu.

“If he makes it to the elections this time, he’ll be the President of Country A. Can you imagine how it feels to date a President? Anyway, I think it’s pretty scary.

“I just feel that this man is too high class and is from a different world from me. How can I be in love with a deity? I’ll feel guilty.”

Qiao Mianmian was silent for a few seconds before nodding. “I roughly understand what you mean. Then, what does he think? Have you told him your thoughts?”
