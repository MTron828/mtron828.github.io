Chapter 240: It Bore a Very Different Meaning

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Her heart was pounding wildly against her chest.

It was with a force that threatened to burst her ribs open.

She quickly placed her hand on her chest in an attempt to calm it.

This was her first time taking the initiative to kiss a man.

She’d never dared to do something so daring.

Even when she was with Su Ze, he had been the one making the move.

She herself had no idea what got over her at that moment that would cause her to do that.

In hindsight, it was really embarrassing.

It was a moment where her guts and impulse met.

If she could go back in time, she didn’t think she could bring herself to kiss Mo Yesi again.

Outside the car, Qiao Mianmian was recovering from the agitation.

Inside the car, the man who’d been kissed was stunned.

Mo Yesi was still in the same position, with the same expression. He hadn’t moved an inch.

It was just a peck on his lips. It probably wouldn’t even qualify as a proper “kiss”.

That was only a split moment of contact.

But even that “kiss” could stun Mo Yesi for a long time.

He looked like a boy who’d never done anything like this.

In his head, the scene where Qiao Mianmian kissed him kept replaying.

She’d always been a shy and timid woman.

It must’ve taken so much courage for her to do that.

This was Qiao Mianmian’s first time kissing him of her own accord.

This kiss bore a very different meaning for Mo Yesi.

A whole minute later, he turned around and looked out the window with a smile.

His fingers touched his lips where the kiss had been planted.

Qiao Chen, sitting in the front passenger’s seat, after witnessing the scene through the rearview mirror, was in shock as well. He even wondered if that girl really was his sister.

Since when had his sister become so proactive in a relationship?

She probably hadn’t done such a thing with Su Ze before too.

But Qiao Chen felt comforted by that thought.

It seemed like his sister was finally opening up.

She was learning to take the initiative with the man she liked.

Mm, this was good.

Men liked it when women took the initiative sometimes.

And the way his brother-in-law smiled said it all.

“Brother-in-law.”

Qiao Mianmian looked out of the window too and saw Qiao Mianmian entering the Su household. “We really don’t have to follow her in?”

“Mm, let’s just wait here.”

That kiss lifted Mo Yesi’s spirits and the joy could be heard in his clear voice. “When your sister has settled this, I’ll take you to have a look at the cars. Just let me know which you like, it’ll my gift to you.

“But don’t let your sister know about it. She doesn’t really approve of me giving you a car.”

Initially, Qiao Chen had thought that Mo Yesi only casually mentioned buying him a car as part of small talk.

He didn’t think he meant it.

But now that he realized Mo Yesi really had that intention, he asked excitedly, “Brother-in-law, y-you’re really getting me a car?”
