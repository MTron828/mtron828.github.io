Chapter 2457: Untitled

“He has had this problem since he was young. Other than his relatives, no other woman can come into contact with him. The one who had been treating his illness was Lu Rao. If you want to know about this, you can ask him.

“But after meeting you, he stopped looking for Lu Rao to treat his illness.”

“But if he’s willing to continue treating him, this illness can be cured. Of course, if you’re afraid and don’t dare to prove his feelings for you, this illness indeed can’t be cured.

“It’s good that you’ve been lying to yourself all your life.”

Mo Yesi’s expression darkened.

Just as he was about to speak, Qiao Mianmian squeezed his palm and gave him a “calm down” look.

Mo Yesi looked at her and chose to remain silent.

Qiao Mianmian comforted him and turned to look at Shen Rou. “This is between Ah Si and me, it has nothing to do with an outsider like you. Miss Shen, you’re worrying too much.”

“Qiao Mianmian, you don’t dare to let him continue receiving treatment, right?” Shen Rou smiled. “Because you know very well that once he recovers, he won’t be like this anymore. You’re afraid of losing your uniqueness…” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“Shen Rou, it’s useless to goad me.” Qiao Mianmian looked at her as if she was a joke. “Do you know when a woman is the ugliest?”

Shen Rou frowned.

Qiao Mianmian looked at her tear-stained face calmly and pursed her lips. She then shook her head and sighed. “Women are the ugliest when they’re blinded by jealousy.

“You should be carrying a mirror with you. I suggest you open it and take a good look at yourself. You look really scary. If someone takes a picture of your terrible side, I’m afraid it’ll affect the Shen Corporation’s image.”

“Qiao Mianmian, what did you say?” Shen Rou was stunned.

Her words were meant to agitate Qiao Mianmian.

Unexpectedly, Qiao Mianmian didn’t react at all and even mocked her.

What was hateful was that she was affected by Qiao Mianmian’s words.

She really wanted to take out the mirror and look at herself.

That slut must have done it on purpose.

She definitely cared, but she pretended not to.

“Miss Shen is arrogant and probably doesn’t care about harassing others. So, please don’t chase Ah Si anymore. Although there aren’t many people now, it’s not like there aren’t people watching. If anyone sees Miss Shen chasing a man, I’m afraid the headlines tomorrow won’t look good.

“We don’t have to trouble an outsider like Miss Shen to worry about us. Please let us through.”

Shen Rou only remembered that she was in the mall now.

The entire floor was filled with luxury brands.

And they were all expensive.

Hence, not many people came to this floor.

Moreover, there were even fewer people at this time.

But it wasn’t just them.

There were a few more people.

Shen Rou turned around and saw a few people standing not too far away. They seemed to be looking at her and taking photos.
