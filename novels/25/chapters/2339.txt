Chapter 2340: She Didn’t Care About Him

Mo Yesi didn’t react to Lin Wanwan’s actions. His gaze landed on the petite wife in his arms. Seeing that she had finished a bottle of yogurt, he took another bottle and opened the cap before handing it to her. “Do you want more?”

Qiao Mianmian took it out of habit and took a sip.

This bottle of yogurt was mango-flavored.

She took a sip of the yogurt before looking up. “Mo Yesi, did you anger the girl away? Aren’t you going overboard with your words? Did she offend you when I wasn’t around?”

Qiao Mianmian couldn’t think of any other reason.

Why was Mo Yesi competing with a little girl?

Even if he was cold to others, he shouldn’t be like this.

“She didn’t offend me.” Mo Yesi’s voice was calm.

“Then, why did you…” Qiao Mianmian frowned slightly. “Girls have thin skin, and she’s just a teenage girl. Your words must have hurt her pride.

“She’s Shaoqing’s cousin. You really… shouldn’t be like that.”

Mo Yesi pursed his lips and looked down at her. He rubbed her head and sighed.

His wife seemed different from other women. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Didn’t they say that women had very sharp instincts when facing a love rival?

Didn’t she know what he was thinking?

But why didn’t his wife notice anything?

Otherwise, she wouldn’t blame him like this.

“Baby, can’t you tell?” Mo Yesi had to remind his slow-witted wife.

“Mm?” Qiao Mianmian blinked. “See what?”

Mo Yesi was speechless.

He shook his head and smiled bitterly. “It seems like you don’t care about me at all.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

Why did it suddenly have to do with whether she cared about him or not?

She looked confused. “Mo Yesi, what are you trying to say? I don’t understand… what do you mean?”

Mo Yesi didn’t intend to continue.

“Forget it, it’s fine if you don’t understand.” Mo Yesi sighed again.

It was enough that he understood.

He just had to be self-aware.

Anyway, even if she understood, she wouldn’t do anything.

Shen Rou and he grew up together. She knew that Shen Rou liked him, but she had never been jealous of her.

Others definitely wouldn’t make her jealous.

Sometimes, Mo Yesi wanted Qiao Mianmian to be a petty woman. He hoped that she would be like other women, jealous of the women trying to get close to her husband.

She’d said she liked him too.

But she had never been jealous of him. Mo Yesi felt that she didn’t care about him that much.

He cared about her, so he would mind any man around her.

But she didn’t care.

She didn’t seem to care about other women around him.

The reason she gave him was that she trusted him.

But Mo Yesi felt that this reason wasn’t enough.

He trusted her, too.

But he would still mind other men coveting her, just like how he minded Su Ze and Gong Zeli. Seeing them appear in scandals with her made him very angry.
