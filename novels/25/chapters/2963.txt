Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Her apology was only to make herself feel better.

“Shixiu, Mom has let you down too.” Madam Mo felt terrible when she saw that her two sons, who were usually filial to her, no longer respected her. She couldn’t help but cry.

But who could she blame?

She had it coming.

She was the one who ruined her happy family bit by bit.

In the past, she was the winner in life.

But now she had nothing left.

She had lost her husband, two sons, and a happy family.

She really regretted it.

“The person you’re most sorry to is Luoli.” After Madam Mo had stirred up so much trouble, Mo Shixiu’s feelings for her had faded a lot. “You were right just now. Some things can’t be solved with just one apology.

“Luoli won’t forgive you, and neither will I.”

“Tknow.” Mo Shixiu’s coldness made Madam Mo’s eyes turn red again. “I’m not trying to seek forgiveness. I just want to apologize to all of you. I was possessed previously and went overboard many times. I’ve let down Luoli and Mianmian. I’ve let down everyone in this family.

“Idon’t deserve your forgiveness, either.

“But even if you don’t forgive me, I feel better after apologizing, Alright, I’m leaving. When I leave this house, it won’t be as messy as before.

“Shixiu, Yesi, both of you must take good care of yourselves and the people around you. When I’m not by your dad’s side in the future, both of you should take care of him for me. As for Old Madam... when you’re free, take some time to come back and accompany her. She’s getting on in years, and she

misses younger people like you the most.”

Madam Mo went on and on. In the end, she kept looking back as she left. Anyone could tell how much she was unwilling to leave.

However, no one did.

Her back view revealed deep disappointment.

Looking at Madam Mo’s reluctant back view, Qiao Mianmian sighed. At this point, she was very touched.

Madam Mo looked very pitiful.

However, the things she did were unforgivable.

Qiao Mianmian could tell that Madam Mo really knew her mistake and regretted it.

However, there was no medicine for regret in this world.

The date of “Phoenix in Flight” was confirmed, and so was the date of Qiao Mianmian and Mo Yesi’s wedding.

The movie would be screened on the day of Chinese Valentine’s Day.

Qiao Mianmian and Mo Yesi’s wedding was also to be held on Chinese Valentine’s Day.

Jiang Luoli and Mo Shixiu were also holding their wedding on the same day.

Qiao Mianmian had previously agreed with Jiang Luoli that their wedding would be held together. Mo Yesi and Mo Shixiu were both henchmen who would listen to their wives’ arrangements. They naturally had no objections when their wives said that they wanted to hold their weddings together.

On the eve of the wedding, the wedding dress that had been custom-made for half a year was finally done. Qiao Mianmian was notified to try it on.

Jiang Luoli was with her.

Mo Yesi and Mo Shixiu were naturally with their wives.

Every woman had imagined their future wedding countless times, and Qiao Mianmian was no exception.
