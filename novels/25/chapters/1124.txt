Linda immediately walked over and introduced her. “Mianmian, this is MC’s CEO Zhang. He’s in charge of all the matters in MC’s cosmetics brands.”

Qiao Mianmian immediately shook his hand. “Hello, President Zhang. I’m Qiao Mianmian.”

“I’ve seen Miss Qiao’s photo before.” President Zhang looked up at Qiao Mianmian and thought to himself, No wonder Young Master Gong changed his mind and gave up on such an outstanding woman like Miss Shen to fall for a newbie in the entertainment industry.

Tsk tsk, this newbie is much prettier than in the photos.

She was already a fairy in the photo.

She was even more fairy-like in person.

Even the first time he saw her, he felt a little moved.

“Miss Qiao looks much better in person than in the photos. Your appearance and aura are very suitable for our MC’s brand image. It’s our MC’s honor to be able to work with Miss Qiao. I hope we can work well together.”

Knowing that Gong Zeli was really interested in this newbie, CEO Zhang didn’t dare to be negligent.

He did not dare to treat her as a newbie.

And when he saw Qiao Mianmian in person, the dissatisfaction in his heart lessened.

Although she was just a newbie with no fame.

But she was really pretty.

Her temperament and appearance were all top-notch.

MC had never used a newbie before, but it wasn’t completely impossible.

He didn’t need new people because he didn’t want to take risks.

President Zhang’s attitude made Qiao Mianmian a little uncomfortable.

She felt flattered.

She quickly said, “President Zhang, you flatter me. It’s my honor to be able to work with MC. Thank you for giving me the chance. I will perform well.”

“I believe Miss Qiao’s performance won’t disappoint us.” President Zhang followed Gong Zeli’s instructions and took the flowers from his secretary. He then handed them to Qiao Mianmian with a smile. “Then, I wish us a happy cooperation.”

Qiao Mianmian was stunned again when she saw the flowers.

She was stunned for a few seconds before she received the flowers from President Zhang under Linda’s gaze.

“Thank you, CEO Zhang.”

After receiving the flowers, she felt that something was wrong.

But at that moment, she couldn’t figure out what was wrong.

...

On the other side.

It was also a private clubhouse.

Qiao Anxin walked out of a red Maserati. The waiter at the door saw her and immediately stepped forward. “Hello, are you Miss Qiao Anxin?”

Qiao Anxin nodded.

The waiter smiled and said, “Miss Qiao, please follow me.”

Qiao Anxin followed the waiter into the clubhouse. The waiter brought her to a private room and knocked on the door.

After getting permission from the person inside, the waiter opened the door and made an inviting gesture. “Miss Qiao, please come in.”

Qiao Anxin hesitated for a moment before pushing the door open and entering.

After she entered the room, the waiter closed the door from outside.

Qiao Anxin looked at Shen Rou, who was sitting on the sofa. She stood at the door for a few seconds before walking towards her.

“Miss Qiao, you’re here.” Shen Rou looked up at her and smiled. “Miss Qiao, please take a seat.”

Qiao Anxin walked towards her and sat down opposite her. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“Miss Shen.” Qiao Anxin was well aware of Shen Rou’s identity. When she spoke to her, she was very polite. “May I know why Miss Shen is looking for me?”

Qiao Anxin was confused.
