Her Little Seven was especially beautiful when she was born. She was fair, chubby, and tender.

Her facial features were very well-defined.

Unlike other children who were born with wrinkled faces and eyebrows that had yet to grow out, looking like little old men.

At that time, she knew that her Little Seven would definitely be very beautiful when she grew up. Who knew how many boys would chase after her?

Madam Bai felt that her daughter would be like Qiao Mianmian when she grew up.

It was obvious at a glance that she was an exceptionally beautiful, adorable, and lovable little girl.

Before she could confirm whether Qiao Mianmian was her daughter or not, Madam Bai already saw her as half a daughter.

She refused to let go of her hand.

“Mianmian, Aunt Bai likes you very much. Don’t you think this is what they call eye contact? Yesi has to be with his friend later. If you’re bored, you can stay with Aunt Bai. Anyway, you don’t have to be reserved here. Just treat it as your own home.

“Oh, right. You didn’t eat dinner, did you? Are you hungry? Thirsty? Do you have anything you want to eat? You look so skinny. Do you usually eat very little? Your appetite isn’t very good.

“If you want to eat something, tell Auntie Bai. Auntie Bai will get someone to prepare it for you.

“Anyway, you don’t have to be polite in front of Auntie Bai, got it?”

Madam Bai was afraid that Qiao Mianmian would be hungry, so she brought it up.

Her way of treating guests was a little too warm.

Qiao Mianmian looked at Bai Yusheng helplessly.

She thought that these wealthy ladies would at least put on airs.

Unexpectedly, not only did Madam Bai not put on any airs, but she was also as friendly as her real aunt.

“Mom.” Even Bai Yusheng felt that Madam Bai was being overly enthusiastic. Although he could understand what she was doing and how she felt, wasn’t Madam Bai scaring her?

He pulled Madam Bai away. “No matter how much you like Mianmian, can you control yourself? You’ll scare her.”

After Madam Bai was pulled away, she calmed down a little when she saw Qiao Mianmian’s helpless expression. She had been too enthusiastic just now.

She couldn’t stop herself.

She was afraid that Qiao Mianmian would really be frightened, so she didn’t dare show any more enthusiasm. Suppressing her excitement, she said, “Mianmian, don’t be afraid. Aunt Bai is just a little agitated because I think my lost child looks like you.”

“No, I’m not scared.” Qiao Mianmian quickly said, “Aunt Bai likes me and cares about me, that’s why she said those things to me. How could I be scared? And I really like Aunt Bai too.”

“Really?”

Upon hearing her words, Madam Bai became excited again. Her eyes lit up as she asked, “You like Auntie Bai too?”

“Mm.” Qiao Mianmian nodded.

She felt that Madam Bai was especially amiable.

She didn’t have the airs of a wealthy lady at all.

Moreover, she seemed to like her so much. How could she not like such an elder?

She knew that Bai Yusheng was such a nice person.

His mother was definitely a good person as well.

“These are the happiest words that Auntie Bai has heard today.” Madam Bai was all smiles and accidentally revealed her true feelings. “Aiya, the more I look at you, the more I like you. If only you were my daughter.”
