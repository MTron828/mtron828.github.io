Chapter 216: He’s So Cute When He’s Jealous

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Qiao Mianmian was stunned and stared at him for a few seconds before coming to a realization.

Was he... jealous?!

He was jealous of Qiao Chen?

But Qiao Chen was her own brother!

This man was even jealous of his own brother-in-law?!

It didn’t mean anything even if Qiao Chen and her opened couple accounts.

Amused, she blinked and grinned. “Mo Yesi, did you ask me to give you my phone to break the relationship between Qiao Chen and I in the game?”

Mo Yesi stared at her and answered matter-of-factly, “Am I not allowed?”

“... It’s not like that.”

“You and Qiao Chen aren’t lovers, so what are you doing with couple accounts?” The man was clearly dissatisfied. “Break it immediately. I’ll register an account, you can open a couple account with me then.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

He was indeed sensitive about this.

She suddenly wanted to burst out laughing.

She really didn’t expect a man like Mo Yesi to show such a childish side.

But he was actually really cute when he was jealous.

She couldn’t help but laugh. “Then, can you take me to the King level too?”

Mo Yesi was speechless. “...”

Although he didn’t know what the King level was, if his brother-in-law was able to accomplish it, then he could do it as her husband too. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

How could he lose to his brother-in-law?

After two or three seconds of silence, he nodded and said, “Of course.”

“Really?” Qiao Mianmian looked at him teasingly. “You have never played this game before, are you sure?”

“I rarely play mobile games, but I’ve played a lot of computer games.” Mo Yesi licked his lips, his eyes confident. “It doesn’t mean I’m bad at it if I’ve never played it before. I can do it. Baby, you must have confidence in me.”

“... Okay.”

“So can you cancel the couple account with Qiao Chen now?”

The man persistently reached out for her phone again.

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

He really was intent on this matter.

It seemed like if she didn’t solve this matter immediately, he would really still be hung up on it.

She held back her laughter and picked up her phone. Logging into the game that she hadn’t played for a long time, she quickly unbound the couple account with Qiao Chen.

“I’ve removed it.”

She shook her phone in front of him and spoke as if she had just completed an errand.

Satisfied, Mo Yesi took out his own phone and handed it to her. “Help me register an account, and then bind us as couple accounts.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

She completed the task a few minutes later and handed the phone back to him.

Taking it, Mo Yesi glanced at his phone and then asked, “Are we couple accounts now?”

“Yes.”

“Can others see that we’re a couple?”

“... Yes, couple accounts have hearts when playing games together. Other people in the game will be able to see it.”

Glancing at his phone again, he looked rather satisfied with the setting and nodded. “Yeah, this setting isn’t bad. It can help put an end to those who harbor malicious intentions.”

There was no response.

...

After drinking the bowl of brown sugar water, Qiao Mianmian felt a lot more comfortable, and her complexion was much better than before.

Lei En brought a hot water bottle over, which Mo Yesi used to apply on Qiao Mianmian’s stomach. Together, they laid down on the bed for more than an hour.

His arms were warm, and the hot water bottle on her belly was also warm.

Color gradually returned to Qiao Mianmian’s face.

Mo Yesi cradled her delicate face that was a little flushed now and asked in a low voice, “Are you feeling better now?”
