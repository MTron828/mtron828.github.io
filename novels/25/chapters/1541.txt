Chapter 1542: Out of Eyes, Out of Heart

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“In fact, I eat a lot on set. I even gained 1 kg.”

“What psychological effect?”

Old Madam wasn’t satisfied with this explanation and glared at the siblings. “I think you’ve lost weight. I say, work and studies are important, but your health is also important. You can’t fall behind in any aspect.”

“Alright, alright, alright.” Qiao Mianmian covered her mouth and smiled. “Grandma is right, we’ll listen to Grandma. Didn’t we bring Chen Chen over to Grandma’s place today?”

“I got the kitchen to prepare your favorite dishes.” Old Madam’s eyes were full of love and affection. “See if I missed anything later. Tell the kitchen and let them cook.”

“Grandma has a granddaughter-in-law and a grandson. This grandson of yours seems unnecessary.” Mo Yesi sounded like he was complaining, but there wasn’t a hint of it in his eyes.

He was very happy to see Old Madam and Qiao Mianmian getting along so well.

The more Old Madam doted on Qiao Mianmian, the happier he was.

He couldn’t wait for more people to pamper his wife.

Madam Mo’s presence was unnecessary.

Madam Mo, who was being ignored, looked awful. It was fine that Qiao Chen and Qiao Mianmian didn’t greet her.

Even her own son ignored her.

“I think I’m the extra one.” Madam Mo had intended to wait for Qiao Mianmian and Mo Yesi to come back this time and take the opportunity to mend the relationship between mother and son and daughter-in-law. But when she saw their attitude, she was instantly filled with anger.

She couldn’t help but mock. “Do I have no place in this family anymore? Even my own son sees me as an invisible person.”

The moment Madam Mo spoke, the warm atmosphere changed.

Old Madam’s expression changed first. She frowned and said angrily, “Do you have to create trouble every time Ah Si and them come back? Since you know you’re superfluous, then don’t stay here!

“I don’t want to affect everyone’s good mood!”

Madam Mo’s face turned pale. “Mom, I...”

“Tell me, when have you not been like this? I’ve said so much to you, but you didn’t take it to heart. Are you trying to make Mianmian and the rest never come back?

“Are you trying to make it difficult for an old woman like me to see her grandchildren in the future?”

“No, Mom...”

“I think that’s what you think!” Old Madam was so angry that her breathing was a little hurried. “Why don’t you think about why Ah Si and they are treating you like this? Don’t you know what you’ve done?”

Madam Mo was speechless.

She didn’t dare to say anything.

But she wasn’t convinced.

“Alright, you’d better go upstairs and rest.” Old Madam didn’t leave her any face this time. She said directly to her in front of everyone in the room, “Everyone doesn’t want to see you.

“You’re not happy to see them too.

“In that case, it’s better not to see them.”

Madam Mo’s expression darkened.

Old Madam didn’t care if she agreed or not. She waved her hand and called a housemaid over. “Tell the kitchen that Madam is having dinner upstairs tonight. Get them to send it upstairs.”
