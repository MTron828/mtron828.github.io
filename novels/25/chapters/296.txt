Chapter 298: She Isn’t My Sister!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

She’d thought that her work life would be a lot easier with just one artiste on hand.

Who knew that Qiao Anxin was so wilful and demanding, treating her like an assistant at her beck and call with little respect.

Linda had never had to deal with such treatment before this.

Even artistes way more popular than Qiao Anxin wouldn’t treat her with such little regard.

If it wasn’t for Qiao Anxin’s relationship with Su Ze, she wouldn’t have swallowed this unhappiness.

“How was I to know that the slut Qiao Mianmian was going to audition for Bai Yusheng’s new show!” Qiao Anxin’s expression darkened. “No wonder she rejected the offer as a stunt double. She was eyeing this role.”

“She’s just a walk-on actor with no other experience, and she dares to try out for this role? Does she even know what she’s worth?” Qiao Anxin didn’t like such artistic films, but she knew how famous Bai Yusheng was in the circle.

She felt threatened because she knew Bai Yusheng as a director and that he liked to groom newbies.

Since Bai Yusheng didn’t care for the actors’ current level of fame, that slut really might have a chance at this.

After all, she did look pretty and was capable of seducing men.

Once this girl had a chance to show her face...

No, she had to find a way to prevent that.

She couldn’t possibly let Qiao Mianmian have the chance to get famous.

“Your sister is trying out for Bai Yusheng’s show? Linda was a little shocked to hear that.

“She isn’t my sister!” Qiao Anxin looked like a cat who had its tail stepped on. She lost her cool and said, “How can that slut be my sister. She and I have nothing to do with each other.”

Just as Linda thought that she was only saying that because she detested Qiao Mianmian, she added angrily, “She’s just a bastard child from the orphanage. A bastard child who doesn’t even have parents isn’t fit to be my sister!”

So what if she took Su Ze away from her?

That bastard child wasn’t worthy of marrying into the Su family anyway.

She was the First Miss of the Qiao family instead.

How could that bastard child be doing better than her in life? RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

All that she had now was rightfully hers, to begin with.

Linda was stunned.

Qiao Anxin had never mentioned this before.

Qiao Mianmian... wasn’t actually the Qiao family’s biological child?

It wasn’t so surprising after a while.

The two Qiao sisters weren’t similar.

In fact, they weren’t similar in any aspect.

She kept the surprise inside as she asked casually, “Then, that brother of yours...”

Linda did have some understanding of Qiao Anxin’s family after being her manager for two years.

She knew that her relationship with Qiao Mianmian and Qiao Chen wasn’t any good.

“You mean that sickly Qiao Chen?” Qiao Anxin was full of disgust when she mentioned him. “He and Qiao Mianmian are the same. They’re bastard kids from the orphanage.”

Linda guessed so.

It wasn’t so surprising to hear this news.

She thought for a while and then asked, “Qiao Mianmian and Qiao Chen aren’t biological siblings too?”

They didn’t look alike at all.

“No.” Qiao Anxin didn’t find it inappropriate to spill all of these secrets she’d kept for years. In fact, she felt good about it. “They’re both from the orphanage and were adopted by the Qiao family when they were a little more than a year old.”
