Chapter 1510: Are You Sure You’re Not Teasing Me?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“You’re not planning to continue like this, are you? Wake up, it’s impossible between you and Qiao Mianmian. You can’t wait any longer.”

Gong Zeli kept quiet for a while.

A moment later, he called out, “Second Bro.”

“Mm, I’m listening.”

“You should know that I accidentally fell into the pool 10 years ago. It was Shen Rou who saved me. I was grateful to her for saving my life and swore to treat her well for the rest of my life. I also promised to marry her if she was willing.”

“That? I know. Why are you suddenly talking about this?”

“Actually, I don’t like Shen Rou.” Gong Zeli closed his eyes. “I’ve never liked her. I’ve never been clear about whether my feelings for her were because I liked her or because I was grateful that she saved me.

“But now, I’m clear.”

“What’s the difference?”

“I’ve always been grateful to her, but I never liked her. I was good to her only because she saved me. I’d thought about it. Whether I really liked her or not, as long as she was willing to marry me, I’d make her the happiest bride in the world.”

“Fourth Bro, what are you trying to say?”

“I can tolerate that there’s no love between us. But I can’t tolerate her lying to me. I was grateful to her for 10 years, but she lied to me for 10 years. I was foolish enough to realize that she lied to me 10 years ago. She wasn’t the one who saved me that night.

“You don’t want to know what happened between us. That’s the answer.”

“You’re saying... the person who saved you that night wasn’t Shen Rou?”

“Mm, right.”

“Who was it, then?! Do you know who saved you? Wait, Fourth Bro, don’t tell me...”

“The person who really saved me that night was Qiao Mianmian.”

“Damn! This is too melodramatic. Are you kidding me?!”

Yan Shaoqing was shocked.

“So, you’ve fallen for someone else because of this? Just because you know that the person who saved you is Qiao Mianmian, you think you’ve fallen for her? Fourth Bro, you’re doing this out of gratitude, right? This isn’t true love.”

“No.” Gong Zeli rubbed his temple. “I’ve made myself clear this time.”

Yan Shaoqing kept quiet for a few minutes.

“Fourth Bro, I think...” He spoke again and deliberated over his tone. “No matter how special she is to you, it’s too late. Perhaps the two of you are destined not to be together, that’s why you were deceived by Shen Rou for 10 years.

“If you’re grateful to her and want to repay her, there are many things you can do. But it’s really impossible between you and her. You know Second Bro’s personality. He won’t let go of what he has set his mind on. Don’t let him know about this if you still want to be his brother.

“I’ll bring a group of beauties in a few days. I guarantee you’ll have fun. Your feelings for her will fade.”

He hung up.

Gong Zeli thought about what Yan Shaoqing said and couldn’t help but smirk.

If only it was as easy as that.

He had tried it before.

But the truth was that no matter how many beauties were around him, he would lose interest.

With that person in mind, all the other women were vulgar.

He didn’t even want to look at them.

Yan Shaoqing hung up and sent him another message.
