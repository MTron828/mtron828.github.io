Chapter 907: I’ll Bring Her In Right Now

But she didn’t owe him money.

She hadn’t done anything to offend him.

Who was he trying to show his ugly face to?

Was he so upset just because his Sir gave her 50 million yuan?

He wasn’t the one who took the money.

What was he unhappy about!

Of course, Jiang Luoli knew that Assistant Xu wasn’t gay. She was just saying those words to spite him. Who asked this man to be so annoying?

If he didn’t make her unhappy, she wouldn’t make him feel good either!

“Y-You’re talking nonsense!” Assistant Xu was fuming. He raised his fist as if he was going to pick a fight with Jiang Luoli. “Jiang, you’re spreading rumors and slandering me! Don’t blame me for being nasty if you continue!”

Any straight guy would hate being called gay.

And to Assistant Xu, Mo Shixiu was someone he admired. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

He would never allow Jiang Luoli to tarnish his idol like this!

Jiang Luoli stood rooted to the ground. “I’m talking nonsense? If you didn’t like your husband, why are you acting like I’m your enemy? Assistant Xu, you don’t have to be so angry. I don’t discriminate against gays. Moreover, I’m not interested in your husband. You don’t have to treat me as your love rival.

“Moreover, your husband’s sexual orientation is normal. Even if I didn’t have that night with him, it wouldn’t be your turn to have another woman. Sigh, just listen to me and give up.”

“Jiang Luoli, you can insult me, but you can’t insult my boss.” Assistant Xu’s face was pale as he clenched his fists. “If you say another word, I won’t hold back.”

“Alright.” Jiang Luoli crossed her arms and looked at him provocatively. “I’d like to see how you’re going to be rude.”

“You...”

“Assistant Xu, Mister is asking if she has arrived. If she has, quickly bring her in.” Another person walked out of the white building. She looked like an honest and approachable woman of about 50 years old.

The woman was wearing an apron and looked like she was cooking.

After she walked out, she sized Jiang Luoli up from head to toe. After that, her expression didn’t change much, and it was hard to tell what she was thinking.

Assistant Xu’s anger slowly dissipated when he saw this woman.

He was very polite to this woman. “Sister Lin, she’s here. I’ll bring her in now.”

The woman called Sister Lin nodded and shifted her gaze to Jiang Luoli again. She looked at her for a few seconds and smiled. “This must be Miss Jiang. Mister is already waiting for you. Miss Jiang, follow us in.”

Seeing how Assistant Xu treated Sister Lin, Jiang Luoli guessed that Sister Lin must have a high status here.

She smiled and nodded. “Thank you, Sister Lin.”

“Miss Jiang, you’re too kind. It’s no trouble at all.” Sister Lin seemed like an easygoing person. She kept a smile on her face and spoke in a friendly manner. “You’re our VIP today. Mister told us to treat you well.”

“... Is that so?” Jiang Luoli smiled insincerely and turned to look at Assistant Xu mockingly.

Assistant Xu met her gaze, and his face turned cold. It was like she owed him a lot of money.
