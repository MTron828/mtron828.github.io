Chapter 244: You’ve Seen That Man Before?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Sister never used to wear such expensive dresses. Now that she’s with a rich man, everything has changed.” Qiao Anxin felt threatened when she saw the way Su Ze looked at Qiao Mianmian.

Although her feelings for Su Ze weren’t so intense anymore after she met that mysterious man, she still had to keep her relationship with Su Ze secure before she managed to win over that man.

Just in case.

In the worst-case scenario, she’d still be able to be a Young Madam of a rich family, as long as she still had Su Ze’s heart.

Qiao Anxin was clear about this.

She wasn’t going to risk losing Su Ze without getting hold of that man. She wouldn’t let herself end up with nothing to her name.

Even with all her other intentions, she wasn’t going to allow her current man to look at another woman with such eyes.

Especially not when that woman was his ex-girlfriend!

Her words successfully changed Su Ze’s expression.

He turned away from her as his expression darkened. “You’re saying that man bought her the dress she’s wearing?” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Qiao Anxin blinked and acted innocent. “I’m not too sure. But it costs a few hundred thousand yuan per piece. I doubt Sister can get it for herself. Moreover, the shoes she’s wearing are also equally expensive. Brother Ah Ze, back when Sister was with you, she didn’t dress up in such expensive goods, right?

“That man is rather generous towards her. It seems like he really likes Sister.”

Su Ze pursed his lips as his expression turned a little awful.

He thought about the time they met at the clubhouse.

The person he thought was a grimy old man turned out to be a handsome and charismatic young man.

He’d always been confident that after their breakup, Qiao Mianmian would someday regret it and come begging to get back together with him.

He thought she’d never find a better man.

Although she was very beautiful, the Qiao family was almost in shambles now and she didn’t have a good career carved for herself. Even if a rich second-generation heir fell for her, he wouldn’t consider marrying her. He’d probably treat her as a plaything at best.

It was practically impossible for her to find another man as eligible as he was.

But that man...

Su Ze’s confidence plummeted when he thought about that man.

It was hard for any woman not to fall for such a man.

Could Qiao Mianmian have fallen for him?

Would she have a change of heart?

With that thought, Su Ze panicked.

He felt as if someone was taking away something that belonged to him.

Even though he’d thrown it away, he didn’t wish for anyone to pick it up.

“I thought it was a dirty old man, but when I saw him again, I realized that he looked rather young. The man is good-looking and so generous towards Sister, do you think she’ll love him?”

Su Ze’s expression turned a shade nastier as Qiao Anxin said each word.

By the time she was done, Su Ze’s face was dark.

He seemed furious as he clenched his fist. “You’ve seen that man before?”

“Yup.” Qiao Anxin sounded casual. “He looks like a rich second-generation heir. The last time Sister caused trouble back at home, that man even came to help her out. It was because of that man that my mom and I got beaten up.”

Qiao Anxin’s voice was filled with a vengeance as she recounted the incident.
