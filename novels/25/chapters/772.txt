She turned around and asked her manager angrily, “Why can’t we take it down? Why are those topics still on the hot searches?

“Why are there more and more people reposting it? Didn’t you say you’d find a way to get rid of it?

“But why isn’t the search ranking down? Why is it getting higher and higher? Is the person you found so unreliable? Or is the money not enough? I don’t care how much you spend, you have to settle this.

“I can’t be destroyed because of this.

“It wasn’t easy for me to get to where I am today. I can’t be ruined by those scandals. I can’t!”

Towards the end of her sentence, her expression had already turned ferocious.

The manager was fuming as well. “Why are you being so fierce to me? Do you think I’m not anxious? You’re my artiste, what good will it do me if you get infamous? It’s not that I don’t want to drop this hot search, it’s that I can’t!”

“Why not?” Huang Yilin’s face was pale. “In the past, all the scandals could be settled with money. Did they ask for a lot of money this time?”

The manager’s expression wasn’t any better. He said coldly, “If it can be settled with money, that’s great. We can spend as much money as we want.”

“What do you mean?” Huang Yilin was stunned for a moment and frowned. “Could it be that this matter can’t be settled with money?”

“Of course.”

The manager said with a serious expression, “I spent money to get Weibo to remove the trending searches, but soon, your negative news was uploaded again. Also, I just called to ask about the situation there. The other party said that the person who exposed you has a huge background. They can’t afford to offend them.

“So, money isn’t the only solution. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Yilin, I’m afraid you’ll have to ask Young Master Yan for help. Only he can help.”

Huang Yilin widened her eyes in disbelief. “We can’t even use our relationship? Who exactly is he?”

The manager shook his head. “They didn’t say it explicitly, as if they were afraid. Yilin, who exactly did you offend?”

“I-I don’t know, either.”

Huang Yilin’s face was a little pale. She furrowed her brows and thought for a while. Then, she clenched her teeth and said, “There’s only one person I can think of. But she couldn’t have gotten someone to do it. She doesn’t have the ability.”

“Who?”

“Qiao Mianmian.” At the mention of this name, Huang Yilin’s eyes turned even colder. “But how could she have such a powerful backer to help her? If she did, she wouldn’t have only gotten the third female role.”

“That might not be the case.” The manager narrowed his eyes. “She didn’t have it before, but she does now, right?”

“You’re saying...” Huang Yilin’s expression turned awful when she thought of that person. “Bai Yusheng did this?”

“Besides him, who else has the capability to do that? He must have found out that the scandal between Tu Yilei and Qiao Mianmian was caused by you. That’s why he wants to stand up for her. He’s the Young Master of the Bai family, it’s easy to find out about your past scandals.

“Other than him, I can’t think of anyone else who’s so capable. He’s so interested in Qiao Mianmian now, it’s not surprising that he would help her do something like this. Anyway, it’s not a big deal to him.”
