Chapter 2346: Mo Shixiu’s Level Is Too High

“No.” Jiang Luoli shook her head. “I wasn’t really asleep.

“Mo Shixiu.”

“Mm?”

Jiang Luoli blinked. “What… did you talk to Grandma about?”

“Nothing important.” Mo Shixiu smiled. “Are you hungry? Do you want to eat something?”

Jiang Luoli frowned. “You haven’t answered my question.”

“Mm?”

“What did you and Grandma talk about?” Jiang Luoli had more or less guessed it. Old Madam specially called Mo Shixiu to her room to talk to him alone. What else could they talk about besides that?

This time, they were called back because of Mo Shixiu’s withdrawal from the election.

Although Old Madam didn’t blame her, it didn’t mean that her feelings for her hadn’t changed.

Jiang Luoli cared about this.

“You should have guessed it.” Mo Shixiu looked at her gently. “Grandma asked me why I withdrew from the election, and I told her the reason. That’s all.”

“What did you say?” Jiang Luoli looked at him without blinking.

“Of course, I told the truth.” Mo Shixiu felt her nervousness and stroked the top of her head warmly. He said lightly, “I told Grandma that I’m thinking for the entire Mo family. I already had the idea of withdrawing before we met.

“Moreover, you’re pregnant now. I hope to spend more time with you. So, I made up my mind.”

Jiang Luoli blinked. “Grandma believed it?”

“Mm.”

“She didn’t doubt you?”

“What’s there to doubt?” Mo Shixiu chuckled. “I didn’t lie to her. I told the truth.”

“Then, Grandma… didn’t she blame me?” Jiang Luoli asked hesitantly.

“Why would she blame you? I’ve said it before, Grandma isn’t unreasonable.”

Mo Shixiu looked especially good when he smiled. His cold eyes were filled with a faint smile, and they seemed to warm up.

He looked so warm and gentle.

There was a saying that a woman was beautiful when she smiled gently.

Jiang Luoli felt that Mo Shixiu’s smile was worthy of this description.

At this moment, Jiang Luoli looked at the handsome face in front of her, and her heartbeat quickened.

The highest level of being a good-looking man was to be able to sleep with the person he felt was the most impossible in his life.

Like Mo Shixiu.

Before she got together with him, she never imagined that they would be married one day.

After all, Mo Shixiu’s level was too high for her.

He was a man she didn’t even dare to think about.

Back then, Mo Shixiu was like a god in her heart.

How could a mortal dare think about a Heavenly God? Just thinking about it was blasphemy.

But now…

This man, whom she thought she would never interact with in her life, had become her husband.

She even gave him a baby.

It was amazing.

Even though they were already married, Jiang Luoli often felt a little dazed.
