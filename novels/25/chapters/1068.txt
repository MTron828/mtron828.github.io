At night, even in summer, the mountains were still a little cold.

Shen Rou sneezed as she walked.

“Miss Shen, do you feel cold?” Bai Yusheng stopped in his tracks and looked at the sleeveless black short skirt she was wearing. He asked thoughtfully, “Do you want me to get someone to get a cloak for you? Or I can bring Miss Shen to change clothes.”

“No need, I...” Shen Rou declined softly.

Before she could finish speaking, Bai Yusheng called a housemaid over and got her to get a cloak.

After instructing the housemaid, he looked down and smiled at Shen Rou. “It’s cold at night, Miss Shen, don’t catch a cold. If you catch a cold because you came out with me, my mom will say that I didn’t treat you well.”

Shen Rou smiled and said, “If Brother Bai has a girlfriend, he’ll definitely be a kind and thoughtful boyfriend. He’ll take good care of her.”

Bai Yusheng smiled. “Miss Shen, if you have a boyfriend, you’ll definitely be more caring and gentle than me.”

At the mention of this topic, Bai Yusheng recalled what the butler said. He kept quiet for a while and then looked back at her. “Miss Shen, I actually have something to say to you. Can I ask Miss Shen a question?”

“Of course,” Shen Rou said generously. “What do you want to ask me, Brother Bai? I’ll answer if I know.”

Bai Yusheng didn’t beat around the bush. He looked straight at her and said, “I wonder if Miss Shen can tell that my mom and your mom seem to want to pair us up. I don’t intend to consider my personal matters now. What do you think, Miss Shen?”

Shen Rou pretended to be shocked and said, “Brother Bai, you’re saying that my mom and Aunt Bai want to pair us up?”

Bai Yusheng sneered when he saw her shocked expression.

He didn’t believe that Shen Rou really didn’t know.

“Miss Shen, can’t you tell?” He had never liked women who liked to pretend. The smile on his face faded a little, and so did his tone.

Shen Rou was a smart woman.

She immediately sensed Bai Yusheng’s coldness.

Of course, she knew why he was so cold to her.

“It’s not that I couldn’t tell, it’s just that I didn’t dare to guess in that direction.” Realizing that it was easy for him to see through her tricks, Shen Rou stopped pretending.

She smiled. “Brother Bai, are you worried that they’ll play matchmaker? Actually, you don’t have to worry. What my mom and the rest think isn’t important. This isn’t the old era of arranged marriages. If we’re unwilling, it doesn’t matter what they think.”

“Moreover...” Shen Rou paused as if she was about to say something sensitive.

Bai Yusheng looked at her with dark eyes. “Miss Shen, you can just say it.”

“If my words make Brother Bai uncomfortable, I’ll apologize in advance. Since Brother Bai wants me to be direct, then I’ll... just say it.”

Shen Rou hesitated for a while before saying, “I know that Big Brother Bai already has someone he likes, right?”

Bai Yusheng was stunned for a few seconds. “I have a woman I like?”
