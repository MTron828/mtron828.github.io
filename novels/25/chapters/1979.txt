The next morning, Qiao Mianmian woke up early.

After washing up, she followed Mo Yesi downstairs.

“Miss, Young Master.” The housemaid greeted them respectfully.

Just then, Madam Bai walked out of the kitchen in an apron.

“Mianmian, you’re up.” Madam Bai walked towards them. “Just nice, I’ve just finished preparing breakfast. Go and sit in the dining room, I’ll get someone to bring it out.”

“Mom, why did you cook yourself?” Qiao Mianmian asked as she looked at Madam Bai’s apron..

“I woke up early. I didn’t have anything to do anyway, so I decided to make breakfast for you. I don’t know what you like to eat, so I made some. Go and try it to see if it’s suitable.”

Madam Bai rarely cooked.

Qiao Mianmian knew this.

Hence, she was a little touched to see that Madam Bai cooked breakfast for her.

She walked over and gently held her hand. “Mom, you don’t have to cook personally in the future. I’ll just eat a little in the morning.”

“You’re not always at home. If I can make you a meal, I’ll make it. Moreover, you have to have a good breakfast, you can’t be casual about this.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

“Alright, go on. I’ll go back to the kitchen.”

With that, Madam Bai went back to the kitchen.

Qiao Mianmian looked at Madam Bai’s busy figure and felt a little upset.

She felt that she had to come back to visit her more often.

“Your mom treats you very well,” Mo Yesi said.

“Mm.” Qiao Mianmian nodded. “She always felt sorry for me and said that she wanted to make it up to me. Oh right, Mom gave me a card last night. She said that she didn’t give me anything when we got married and to just treat it as a wedding gift.”

Qiao Mianmian didn’t have to tell Mo Yesi about this, but she did.

She felt that they were a family after marriage.

Mo Yesi smiled. “Take what Mom gave you. As for how you want to use it, that’s up to you.”

Qiao Mianmian nodded. “I think so, too.”

“Take it, it’ll make you feel better. Let’s go.”

...

Madam Bai prepared a sumptuous breakfast.

There were Western and Chinese dishes.

Although Madam Bai rarely cooked, her culinary skills were very good. Even the picky Mo Yesi praised it.

After dinner, Qiao Mianmian received a call from Bai Yusheng. He said that he would be home in a few minutes and told her to get ready.

Madam Bai was naturally reluctant to part with her.

She told her to take care of her body and not work too hard.

Five minutes later, Bai Yusheng arrived. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

As Qiao Mianmian was attending the publicity meeting with Bai Yusheng, so Mo Yesi didn’t have to send her.

Mo Yesi was still a little unhappy about this.

After all, with him around, he didn’t need anyone to pick his wife up.

Qiao Mianmian got into Bai Yusheng’s car and he brought her to a styling center.

The stylist and Bai Yusheng knew each other. When he saw him bringing a pretty girl over, he joked. “Is Young Master Bai bringing his girlfriend to a banquet? This girl is really beautiful and seems rather young. Where did you abduct her from?”

Bai Yusheng immediately kicked him. “What girlfriend? This is my sister. If you continue spouting nonsense, I’ll tear you a new one.”
