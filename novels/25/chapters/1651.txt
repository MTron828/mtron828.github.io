Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“In my opinion, you’re a little better than Shen Xing back then.”

This compliment made Qiao Mianmian feel a little giddy.

“Brother, don’t praise me anymore.” She covered her slightly hot face. “If you praise me like this again, I’ll be really embarrassed. How could I dare to compare to Senior Shen?”

“Why not?”

Bai Yusheng patted her on the head and said affectionately, “My sister is more qualified than anyone else.

“After this shoot, you can give yourself a break. Don’t rush to take on another job. You and Ah Si are newlyweds, you need more time to develop your relationship. It’s not good if you film outside all year round.” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Although her career was important, Bai Yusheng still hoped that his sister’s family would be harmonious.

“Mm, I know.” Qiao Mianmian nodded obediently.

Seeing her like this, Bai Yusheng’s heart softened. He couldn’t help but reach out and touch the top of her head. “Mom talks about you all day. When you go back, find a time to come home.”

“Mm.”

Madam Bai had no time to stay in F City.

But even though she wasn’t around, her calls never stopped coming.

Qiao Mianmian video chatted with her for more than an hour every day, and Madam Bai called her at least two times a day.

“Oh right, your sister...” Bai Yusheng frowned. “Did she change targets again?”

“Huh?”

“I heard she was with Boss Huang, but I saw her entering the entertainment venue with another man last night,” Bai Yusheng said in disdain.

Thankfully, Qiao Mianmian wasn’t affected by that woman.

Qiao Mianmian quickly regained her composure.

Qiao Anxin was someone who would do anything to achieve her goals.

Back when she hooked up with Su Ze, besides wanting to snatch him from her, the main reason was that Su Ze could groom her.

After the Su Corporation was acquired, Su Ze was assigned elsewhere.

Then, she went under Boss Huang.

Now that Boss Huang had fallen, wasn’t it normal for her to change her target?

She just didn’t know what kind of man she’d picked this time.

Just as Qiao Mianmian was thinking this, she heard Bai Yusheng say, “The person she’s following this time isn’t good. She’s very daring. I think she’ll definitely suffer a lot in the future.”

“Who is she following?” Qiao Mianmian couldn’t help but ask.

“Quan Dong. This person is known to have mental problems. A few female artistes that have been with him were sent to the hospital.”

Quan Dong?

Qiao Mianmian was no stranger to this name.

Quan Dong had a lot of power and influence in the entertainment industry.

As long as he was willing to groom someone, they would definitely succeed.

Just as Bai Yusheng said, this person was a pervert.

Qiao Mianmian heard that a few female artistes were tortured by Quan Dong. Although they managed to get good resources, they still paid a huge price.

Qiao Anxin dared to follow Quan Dong for fame.

She really didn’t want her life anymore.

...

After the filming was completed, the production crew held a wrap-up party and posted a picture of the actors on the official Weibo.

Every actor posted a picture.

Qiao Mianmian also posted one.

Qiao Mianmian V: [We’re finally done. After spending a few months together, everyone is like family. I can’t bear to part with them. I have to especially thank Senior Qin Han. I have so much to say, thank you very much.]
