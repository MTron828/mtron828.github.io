Chapter 1869: The Mo Family’s Men Are All Overbearing

Was he trying to stop her from shopping in the future?

Wouldn’t she be so bored that she would explode in the next few months?

Jiang Luoli wasn’t the kind of girl who liked to stay quiet. She wouldn’t be able to stand it if she stayed at home for a day.

If it was the entire pregnancy...

She felt that she had chosen to die on the spot.

“Then what are you going to do? You can’t take a taxi.”

Mo Shixiu had a special identity.

Many people knew him.

He had been recognized at the Civil Affairs Bureau.

Jiang Luoli could guarantee that if he got out of the car now, he would be recognized soon.

Mo Shixiu looked at the time on his watch and said, “I’ll send you first.”

“Don’t you have something to do?”

“It can wait.”

Mo Shixiu did not tell her that it was Madam Mo who called just now.

Madam Mo called to say that she had something important to see him about and asked him to go over immediately.

...

Jiang Luoli wanted to go shopping in the mall, but Mo Shixiu stopped her.

He sent her back home.

Looking at the unhappy expression on the little woman’s face, he reached out to rub her head and gently consoled her. “You went for a checkup this morning. You definitely didn’t sleep well. Rest at home first. If there’s really a place you want to go, I’ll accompany you when I come back.”

Jiang Luoli turned her face away and ignored him.

Why were the Mo Family’s men so overbearing?

Mo Shixiu was usually very obedient to her. Whatever she wanted to do, he would agree unconditionally and always looked gentle as if he had no temper.

But that was under normal times.

If something really happened, he would be domineering without any room for discussion.

Like now.

No matter what Jiang Luoli said, she did not move him.

Mo Shixiu saw her throwing a tantrum and his eyes were filled with a loving smile. He reached out, gently rubbed her head, and said gently, “Luoli, be good. Don’t be willful now, okay?

“It’s not that I don’t want you to go, it’s just that it’s too dangerous for you to go alone. The doctor said that the first three months are the most dangerous period, so you have to stabilize your pregnancy. I know that this will make you feel like you’re not free and you’ll feel bored, but bear with it for now, okay?

“If you want to go shopping, wait for me to go with you. Or let Sister Lin and the rest accompany you. In short, you can’t go shopping alone.

“When I’m done with my work, I’ll rest for half a month. When that time comes, I’ll bring you overseas to play, okay? Do you have anywhere you want to go?”

Jiang Luoli: “...” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

What else could she be angry about?

She felt that she’d be unreasonable if she continued to argue with him.

Besides, he was nervous because he cared about her and the baby in her stomach.

If he didn’t care, what would happen to her?

Actually, Jiang Luoli wasn’t really angry. She was just a little depressed.

“Alright, you don’t have to worry about me anymore. Go and do your things. If I really want to go out, I’ll ask Sister Lin to accompany me.”

“You’re not angry anymore?” Mo Shixiu looked down at her.

“I wasn’t angry in the first place.”

“I’ll get going, then. Do you have anything you want to eat? I’ll bring it back for you later.”

Without waiting for her answer, he smiled and said, “I heard that pregnant women like to eat sour things. Is that true?”
