Chapter 862: I’ll Test Her

He would definitely dote on such an obedient sister.

...

Half an hour later.

They arrived at a high-end condominium.

The condominium was in the city center, a place where every inch of land was worth its weight in gold. It was a well-known neighborhood for the rich.

As Qiao Mianmian and Bai Yusheng waited for Mo Nan to open the door, she couldn’t help but tense up.

The door opened, and Mo Nan stuck his head out.

He first looked at Bai Yusheng, and when his gaze landed on Qiao Mianmian, his brows furrowed slightly, but quickly returned to normal.

But because of that, Qiao Mianmian got even more nervous.

Her heart was racing uncontrollably. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

When she saw Mo Yesi, her heart would beat faster because of his charm.

But in front of Mo Nan, she was just afraid.

Mo Nan was almost 50 years old.

He was wearing loose pajamas, and his hair was a little messy. He hadn’t even shaved.

He looked rather unkempt.

When he looked at people, his gaze was a little sharp. Moreover, he wasn’t the kind of person who looked approachable. Qiao Mianmian couldn’t help but lean towards Bai Yusheng.

Bai Yusheng seemed to sense her nervousness too. He patted her head in front of Mo Nan and smiled as he introduced her to him. “This is the girl I told you about. Don’t show that picky look of yours. She’s young and timid, you’ll scare her if you’re too serious.”

Mo Nan’s expression softened a little when he heard that.

Although he still didn’t look like he was easy to approach, he didn’t look as scary as before.

“Come in.” He turned around and looked at Qiao Mianmian’s exquisite and beautiful face. He couldn’t help but frown and doubt Bai Yusheng’s words.

Could this little girl be the person he was looking for?

Although Mo Nan was already halfway out of the industry, he hadn’t completely left it.

He had always been in contact with Bai Yusheng and some of his friends in the industry.

Hence, she’d heard some rumors about Bai Yusheng and Qiao Mianmian.

Now that he saw that Bai Yusheng actually brought such a beautiful girl over, he was a little suspicious.

Did this guy want him to support this little girl?

If that was the case, he’d be wrong.

Although they had a good relationship, if this little girl didn’t satisfy him, it didn’t matter how good their relationship was.

...

Mo Nan was a slovenly person.

The place he lived in wasn’t any better.

It wasn’t very dirty, but it was messy.

Qiao Mianmian smelled smoke the moment she entered.

It wasn’t pungent, but it wasn’t pleasant either.

Thankfully, besides the smell of cigarettes, there was no other unbearable smell.

The apartment was rather large, and the living room was rather empty because there wasn’t much furniture.

Mo Nan closed the door and walked into the living room. He then said to Bai Yusheng, “I’ll test her. Do you have any objections?”

He was a very active person.

He didn’t want to waste time.

Bai Yusheng knew his personality too. He looked down at Qiao Mianmian and said gently, “Mianmian, are you alright? Are you ready?”
