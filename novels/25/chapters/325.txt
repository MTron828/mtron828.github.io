Chapter 326: It’s a Warning This Time

All the times they’d gotten physical were out of fun.

But this time, Mo Yesi hit him out of anger.

He’d punched his closest buddy for the sake of that woman he’d married while barely knowing her.

Gong Zeli cupped his swollen eye and slowly looked up.

He looked at Mo Yesi with anger and disappointment, and then shifted his gaze to Qiao Mianmian and smiled.

A cold and sinister smile. “Mo Yesi, you did this to your buddy for this woman?”

Mo Yesi looked at him calmly. “Whatever you did wasn’t something a buddy of mine would do.”

“So, you’re saying you don’t see me as a buddy anymore? You want to sever ties with me?” Gong Zeli asked through clenched teeth.

“This is your choice.” Mo Yesi seemed unfazed. “It’s a warning this time. If this happens again, it won’t be settled so simply.”

Gong Zeli had a look of disbelief. “Our ten-odd years of friendship mean nothing to you?”

“If it wasn’t for these ten-odd years of friendship, do you think you’d still be standing right now?” Mo Yesi sounded calm but cold. “Gong Zeli, this is the last time I’m warning you. You’d better be more respectful to my wife.”

Mo Yesi’s distant expression made it clear to Gong Zeli that he wanted nothing to do with him anymore.

He really didn’t care about their bond at all.

He was completely charmed by Qiao Mianmian.

His buddies and friends meant nothing to him.

Right now, Qiao Mianmian was his everything.

Nobody could say a word about her. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Now that this had come to a close, Gong Zeli’s heart hardened.

His gaze still, and a while later, he suddenly sneered. “Very well. Mo Yesi, I finally f**king understand what it means to value sex over friendship. It actually took me more than ten years to see through you.

“I must’ve been f**king blind to be a buddy to such a heartless person for so many years.

“Fine. Since you don’t think we should remain buddies, then let’s call it off from here.”

“Ze Li, don’t be rash...” Shen Rou hurriedly dissuaded him.

Gong Zeli smirked. “I’m not being rash at all. Rourou, don’t you see, he isn’t the Ah Si we knew anymore. Besides this woman, who else does he even care about?

“We thought that our friendship and bond ran deep with him, but it seems like it means nothing in his eyes. He can give us up anytime.

“He trampled all over your dignity and got violent with me because of this woman. Do you think there’s a need to remain friends with such a person any longer?”

Shen Rou’s eyes were red as tears welled up. She bit her lip silently.

That’s right.

The Mo Yesi now wasn’t the Mo Yesi they knew anymore.

The person he was now felt very foreign to her.

She’d thought of leaving him for good when she was especially angry and upset too.

But, how could she bear to?

He was the man she’d liked for over two decades.

He had long become the most important person in her life. How could she just give him up like that?

Moreover, she was indignant to back out just like that. If she gave up without giving it her best shot, wasn’t she going too easy on Qiao Mianmian?
