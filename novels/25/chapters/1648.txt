Chapter 1649: This Is Good, Treat It as a Test

“If he’s really biased towards Madam Mo, then you must indeed reconsider your relationship.”

It was an unequal relationship.

With the huge disparity in their statuses, if Mo Shixiu wasn’t on her side, this relationship would be difficult to carry on.

And it wouldn’t end well.

If Mo Shixiu couldn’t give Jiang Luoli happiness, Qiao Mianmian naturally didn’t want them to continue being together.

This wouldn’t be the last time.

If Madam Mo failed the first time, there would be a second and a third time.

If Mo Shixiu didn’t protect Jiang Luoli, she would be in danger.

Jiang Luoli kept quiet for a while before saying, “Mm. Baby, I know what I should do. Actually, when I first got together with Mo Shixiu, I knew that we would definitely face some problems in the future. But I didn’t expect it to come so early.

“That’s good too. Let’s take it as a test.

“If we can pass, then we will continue to be together. If we can’t pass, it’s good to break up early. Anyway, our relationship isn’t very deep now. If we separate... it won’t be too hard,” Jiang Luoli said casually.

But how could Qiao Mianmian not know what she was feeling?

Mo Shixiu was Jiang Luoli’s ideal type.

If they really separated, Jiang Luoli would definitely be upset.

Moreover, this was Jiang Luoli’s first relationship, and the meaning was very different.

Hence, Qiao Mianmian still hoped for a good outcome.

“Luo Luo, have a good talk with Mo Shixiu.”

“Mm, I will. Baby, are you filming tomorrow? Go to sleep quickly.” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“What about you? Aren’t you sleeping?”

“I’m not sleepy. I’m going to the kitchen to make supper for Mo Shixiu. Baby, I’m hanging up. Good night, have a good dream.”

“Alright, good night. Call me if you need anything.”

“Mm.”

Qiao Mianmian hung up and thought for a while. Just as she was about to return to the room, she saw Mo Yesi standing behind her.

Shocked, she lightly punched his chest. “You’re awake? When did you wake up? Why were you so quiet? You scared me.”

Mo Shixiu held her soft hand and smiled. “I just woke up. It’s not that I was silent, but you were too engrossed in your conversation and didn’t notice me. Who called you at this time, Jiang Luoli?”

“Mm.”

“Why is she calling you at this time?”

Qiao Mianmian hesitated for a while before looking up at him. “Mo Yesi, do you know what happened to Luo Luo’s brother this time? He owed someone money and was caught at the police station.”

Mo Shixiu knew that she wasn’t asking casually. “Did she say something to you?”

“Mm, Luo Luo called to tell me something.”

“What is it?”

Knowing that Mo Yesi wasn’t filial to the extreme, Qiao Mianmian didn’t hide it from him. “Luo Luo told me that her brother was set up by someone. And the person behind it... might be Mom.”

Mo Yesi was stunned. “Mom set this up?”

“Mm. She did this to separate Luo Luo and Big Brother. She was already very dissatisfied with my family background back then, but you took the initiative to register our marriage, so she couldn’t stop you in time. But Luo Luo and Big Brother aren’t married yet, and she definitely doesn’t want Luo Luo to marry Big Brother.”
