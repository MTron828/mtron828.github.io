Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Mm, my baby is very powerful.” Mo Yesi looked at his wife affectionately. “So fishing isn’t difficult. If you like fishing, I’ll bring you out often when I’m free.”

“Mm!” Qiao Mianmian nodded with sparkling eyes. “This is the first time I’ve found fishing so fun. Let’s continue fishing, I’ll definitely catch a bigger fish next time.”

“You’re not eating?” Mo Yesi rubbed her head and laughed. “Why don’t you eat first and play after you’re full?”

“No.” Qiao Mianmian was too excited to agree. “I want to catch a few more fish. Mo Yesi, get someone to store the fish I caught later. Don’t roast it.”

Mo Yesi asked curiously, “No? Then why did you catch it?”

“I’m raising them,” Qiao Mianmian said seriously. “In memory of catching my first fish, I want to raise all the fish I catch today.”

The man was stunned for a moment before smiling affectionately. “Alright, I won’t eat it. I’ll take care of it.”

As long as his wife was happy, he could even raise a bear, let alone fish.

It wasn’t as if he didn’t have the qualifications.

Qiao Mianmian was in high spirits. With Mo Yesi’s guidance, she caught a few more fish, including two shrimps.

Mo Yesi got someone to get them all into the fish tank.

After dinner.

Qiao Mianmian lay on the deck and looked up at the dark blue night sky. The wind on the sea wouldn’t be too cold.

The slightly humid sea breeze was very comfortable.

On the deck, only she and Mo Yesi were there. The crew had been dismissed.

The starry sky above was beautiful. Qiao Mianmian squinted, a little entranced.

“Mianmian.”

Mo Yesi lay beside her and squeezed her hand.

Qiao Mianmian nodded. “Mm.”

“Are you happy?” Mo Yesi asked.

“Mm.” Qiao Mianmian turned around and faced him. “I’m very happy.”

Mo Yesi looked at her deeply and held her soft palm for a few seconds before saying softly, “Mianmian, let’s have a baby.”

Qiao Mianmian widened her eyes.

She didn’t know why Mo Yesi would request such a serious matter.

He suddenly talked about having a baby.

Qiao Mianmian was still young and had never thought of giving birth at this age.

She’d already told Mo Yesi about it.

Hence, Qiao Mianmian was shocked when he mentioned it.

“A baby?” she asked with uncertainty.

“Mm.” Mo Yesi looked straight at her. “If you want a baby that belongs to us, both boys and girls are fine. I know you don’t have any plans to have a baby for now. If you’re worried about not taking good care of the baby, you don’t have to worry about anything else. I’ll take care of the baby.”

Mo Yesi hadn’t thought of this all of a sudden. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

With a child, their relationship would be even more stable.

Qiao Mianmian looked at him blankly.

In order to move her, Mo Yesi told her about the benefits of having a child early.

For example, when the baby grew up, she would still be a hot mom.

Moreover, they were both good-looking, so their babies would definitely be especially beautiful.

There was no such thing as fast recovery.
