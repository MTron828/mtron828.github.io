Chapter 2253: She’s Actually Playing a Corpse

Father Qiao was stunned and slowly looked up. Qiao Mianmian saw that his eyes were red.

Tears rolled down his cheeks. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

He probably felt that a man couldn’t shed tears, so he tried his best to hold it in.

He grabbed Qiao Mianmian’s hand and nodded. “Alright, we’re father and daughter forever.”

At this moment, Father Qiao felt guilty as he looked at the sincere Qiao Mianmian sitting by the bed.

He wasn’t a qualified father.

He was more biased towards his wife and supposed biological daughter.

Before Mother Qiao passed away, he still valued Qiao Mianmian.

But after Mother Qiao died, he married Lin Huizhen and had Qiao Anxin. He started to neglect his eldest daughter.

Even if he didn’t do it on purpose, he did ignore Qiao Mianmian.

And then, because of Qiao Anxin and her mother, he did many wrong things.

He felt that he had gone overboard.

But now, this daughter who wasn’t related to him by blood actually said this to him.

She was the only one who visited him in the hospital.

He was able to live in such a good ward, enjoy the best treatment in the hospital, and have so many professionals take care of him, all because of her.

Lin Huizhen and her daughter were long gone.

They didn’t call him even once.

His wife and daughter, whom he thought were reliable, seemed like a joke now.

…

Lin Huizhen and Qiao Anxin were no longer in Yuncheng City.

Qiao Anxin followed Su Ze’s instructions and went overseas.

But everything didn’t go as smoothly as she thought.

Her fame didn’t follow her after she left the country. Her looks weren’t too good, either. She entered the local entertainment industry as a newbie again, and without the support of the company, this was the first time she felt the so-called treatment of a newbie.

Qiao Anxin tried all the setbacks Qiao Mianmian faced.

This was the first time she knew how it felt to be a walk-on actor.

“Hey, why are you in a daze? Come over, it’s your turn soon.”

On the set.

Qiao Anxin took on the role of a walk-on. Just as she was done changing, a crew member came over and called her. “Lie face down there later, don’t show your face. You don’t have to do anything, just lie there, get it?”

Qiao Anxin took the role of a “corpse”.

She wanted to play the role of the female lead’s sister for many years, but when the female lead found her, she was already killed.

Her death would agitate the female lead in the show. It would become a crucial turning point for the entire show.

Speaking of which, her role was very important.

When Su Ze asked her to act in this role, he said that it was an important role.

But when Qiao Anxin arrived, she realized that she was playing a corpse.

As she was just an extra, he couldn’t possibly give her the script in advance.

Qiao Anxin was furious.

Ever since she debuted, she got the second female role in her first production with Su Ze’s help.

After she got together with him, she even won the female lead role.

And now, he wanted her to play a “corpse”?
