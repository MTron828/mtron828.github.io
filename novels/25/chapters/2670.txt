Chapter 2672: Honey Trap

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

No one would believe it.

They would feel that she was bragging.

“What are you looking at, why are you smiling so happily?” A familiar scent came from behind her. The next second, Qiao Mianmian was pulled into a pair of strong and warm arms.

She leaned against Mo Yesi’s chest and smiled. “Look, the netizens are praising you. They even asked me to tell them how I managed to seduce you.

“Tell me, did I flirt with you back then?”

Mo Yesi glanced at her cell phone and casually read the comments. He slowly smiled. “Then, you can tell them that your secret is that you used a honey trap to make me fall in love with you at first sight.”

“I used a honey trap on you?”

“Mm.”

“You fell in love with me at first sight?”

“Mm.”

“Then, aren’t you attracted to me? You want me to tell others that you’re a superficial man who’s easily charmed by beauty?”

Mo Yesi chuckled again.

Qiao Mianmian could feel his warm breath on her cheek as Mo Yesi whispered into her ear, “Baby, you’re right. I… do have feelings for you. In front of you, I’m a superficial man who’s easily charmed by your beauty.

“So, you don’t have to do anything to seduce me.

“This is your secret. Besides you, no one else can learn it.”

His low and magnetic voice was alluring. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Even Qiao Mianmian wasn’t immune to his voice.

Her ears burned.

Qiao Mianmian’s heart couldn’t take it anymore.

His voice was still teasing her, and it was getting deeper and deeper. “Baby, I filled the bathtub. Do you want to take a bath?

“I put your favorite essential oils in the water.”

When the man spoke, a soft touch brushed past Qiao Mianmian’s ear. It seemed unintentional, but also seemed intentional.

“I’ll scrub your back later, alright?”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

This familiar rhythm.

It seemed like someone was getting restless again.

She took a deep breath and didn’t let him tease her. After suppressing the fluttering in her heart, she wrapped his arm around her waist and started to become restless too. She slowly turned around in his arms. “No need, I can wash myself.

“Your hand is injured, so it’s not convenient.”

Mo Yesi refused to let go of her waist. “I can use my uninjured hand.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

This man was really thick-skinned.

Qiao Mianmian took another deep breath and shook her head decisively. She then slowly pulled his hand away from her waist and looked up. “I’ll shower by myself.”

He looked disappointed, but he still fought for it. “You really don’t need me to scrub your back?”

“No need.” Qiao Mianmian shook her head. “I can do it myself.”

“Alright.” Mo Yesi sighed in disappointment. “Go on, then.. The water will get cold soon.”
