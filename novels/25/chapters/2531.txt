Chapter 2532: How Can She Be So Arrogant?

She thought that Tang Ya would be worried after what she said.

“Shen Rou, is that why you’re not convinced when I say you’re stupid?” Tang Ya laughed, but her laughter was full of disdain. “Do you think you need to say anything about this? Do you think others are as stupid as you? Ha, Mo Yesi already knows that I was the one who helped your Shen family behind the scenes. You’re really stupid to threaten me with this.” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Shen Rou was stunned.

Mo Yesi already knew?

If Mo Yesi really knew about it, her only weakness would be useless.

She couldn’t do anything to Tang Ya.

Shen Rou panicked.

She thought she could still control Tang Ya, but she didn’t expect her to be so fearless.

“On account that we’re partners, I might as well tell you that the few businesses this time were ruined because of you. You touched Qiao Mianmian and angered Mo Yesi, so he got someone to intercept your deals.

“If you weren’t stupid, this wouldn’t have happened.

“Previously, the Shen Corporation stole a few businesses from the Mo Corporation, but they didn’t do anything. Do you think Mo Yesi is so easy to deal with? It’s not that he can’t do anything to the Shen Corporation, but he feels that there’s no need for him to do anything about the business you stole.

“Perhaps he still cares about the friendship between the Shen and Mo families.

“Otherwise, given the Shen Corporation’s current situation, it’s a piece of cake for him to deal with you. I’ve said it before, we have to take it slow and not be too anxious. But you’ve already messed up. You’ve touched the person you shouldn’t have touched. Mo Yesi is about to start dealing with the Shen Corporation, and I can’t do anything about it now.”

That “you touched the person you shouldn’t have touched” angered Shen Rou. She couldn’t suppress the jealousy in her heart and gritted her teeth. “Why can’t I touch Qiao Mianmian? It’s just a woman. Does he want to kill our Shen Corporation just for her?

“Moreover, didn’t you say that you could deal with the Mo Corporation? Why are you saying that now? Tang Ya, at the end of the day, you’re just afraid of Mo Yesi. If you told me earlier that you were afraid of him, I wouldn’t have listened to your arrangements like a fool. Now that the Shen Corporation is in trouble, you have an unavoidable responsibility. If you leave the Shen Corporation like this, I won’t let you off!”

Shen Rou had no choice but to threaten Tang Ya.

She gritted her teeth and said, “No matter how powerful you are, Yuncheng City isn’t your territory. I’m inferior to you, but I have a way to make you unable to leave Yuncheng City and make your life here difficult!”

Now, Shen Rou didn’t care about the conflict.

She knew that if Tang Ya didn’t care about the Shen Corporation, it would really be over.

“Really?” Her threat angered Tang Ya.

Her casual tone turned cold when she spoke again. “You can try. I’ll wait.”

Tang Ya hung up.

“Damn it, Tang Ya, you…”

Shen Rou’s expression darkened.

This damn Tang Ya.

How could she be so arrogant?
