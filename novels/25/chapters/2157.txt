Chapter 2160: I Said I Like You

She always felt that Mo Shixiu was a gentleman.

But no matter how much of a gentleman, he was still a man.

“Alright.” Jiang Luoli knew that she shouldn’t go overboard.

Otherwise, she wouldn’t be able to do anything if Mo Shixiu got aroused.

She stopped in time.

“But you smell really good.” Jiang Luoli seemed to be hugging a fragrant toy. “You smell especially good. Mo Shixiu, I like your scent.

“Why do you smell so good?”

Mo Shixiu couldn’t help but laugh. “What’s the fragrance on me?”

“I don’t know,” Jiang Luoli said firmly. “Anyway, it’s definitely not the fragrance of shower gel, shampoo, or the perfume you use. I can’t describe it. It just smells especially good.”

Jiang Luoli had forgotten what she’d read before.

The general idea was that when you liked someone, you could smell a nice fragrance from him.

That aura didn’t belong to anyone else.

Not everyone could smell it.

Only when you really liked that person could you smell it on him.

He couldn’t smell it himself.

Jiang Luoli’s heart skipped a beat.

So, she liked Mo Shixiu?

Although this wasn’t surprising, she suddenly realized something.

She was sure that she liked Mo Shixiu.

But she didn’t know how much she’d fallen for him.

“Mo Shixiu,” Jiang Luoli called out.

“Mm, I’m here.” A gentle voice came from above.

“I discovered something.”

“What is it?”

“I realized that I’ve fallen for you.”

Mo Shixiu was stunned. “What did you say?”

Jiang Luoli looked up at him. “I said I like you. That’s why you smell so good.

“Although I don’t know how much I like you, I definitely do. Mo Shixiu, do you know? When I was with you, I told myself that I couldn’t like you.

“But I still failed.”

Mo Shixiu couldn’t describe his feelings.

This was the first time he met a girl like Jiang Luoli. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

She liked someone so openly.

She liked him, so she told him directly.

There was no beating around the bush.

Her honesty caught him off guard.

He didn’t expect her to confess under such circumstances.

Although they were already married and had a baby coming, Mo Shixiu wasn’t sure that Jiang Luoli liked him.

Their marriage was different from normal people’s.

“Sigh, why are you so good to me?” Jiang Luoli continued. “It’s because you’re too good to me that I couldn’t control my heart and fell for you.

“I thought I could control my feelings.

“So, I’m not as powerful as I thought.

“Forget it, it’s fine if I like you. Anyway, it’s not embarrassing to like someone. Mo Shixiu, don’t think that you can stop caring about me just because I said I like you.”
