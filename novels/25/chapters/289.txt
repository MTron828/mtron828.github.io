Chapter 292: Adapt to This Intimacy

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Madam Mo was astonished. “Mom, what did you say to Rourou?” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“Of course I told her to find another good man and give up on our Ah Si.”

“Mom, you...” Madam Mo was upset to hear that.

She didn’t know what Old Madam had said to her.

But it couldn’t have been anything good.

Otherwise, Shen Rou wouldn’t have left in the afternoon with reddened eyes.

What if Old Madam’s words hurt Shen Rou too deeply, and she really gave up on Ah Si?

She was never going to find a more suitable and outstanding girl than Shen Rou for her son.

“Wenpei!” Old Madam called her out sternly when she saw that Madam Mo obviously wasn’t internalizing what she’d said. “Remember what I just said. I like Mianmian as my granddaughter-in-law and I won’t tolerate anyone ruining things for the family.

“Given Ah Si’s weird disorder, it’s already a huge blessing that he could find a suitable girl for him to spend the rest of his life with. You’ve got to thank God for it.”

Madam Mo’s lips quivered as she thought of rebutting.

But she kept it in.

Thank God, what for?

Her son was “cured” of the disorder, sure, but what had that got to do with Qiao Mianmian?

It was thanks to the doctor.

But she wouldn’t dare say this to Old Madam.

“Alright, let’s go back in.”

Old Madam couldn’t wait to start planning for the banquet.

She’d always been envious of others, whose grandchildren were getting married and bearing them great-grandchildren. After so many years of envying others, her time had finally come.

Old Madam could feel the warmth and sweetness at the thought of it.

Hmph, this was her turn to show others just how pretty and likable her granddaughter-in-law was.

Now nobody could speculate her precious grandson’s sexuality anymore.

On the way back.

Qiao Mianmian fiddled with the box that Old Madam gave her. The box looked exquisite; even the carving patterns were designed with gold.

It was evidently classy.

She didn’t open it to see what was inside. She decided that she’d look at it when she was back home.

Mo Yesi saw that she was looking curiously at it from all angles and couldn’t help but smile at her. “You want to know what’s inside? Just open it up, what are you hesitating about?”

Qiao Mianmian looked up at him.

She was so close to him, she could see the thin layer of stubble on his chin. She could even smell the fragrance of his shaving cream.

She was wrapped in his embrace and leaning against his chest now.

Mo Yesi really liked hugging her recently.

He held her in his arms the moment they got in the car.

Qiao Mianmian wasn’t used to it initially.

But as time went by, she slowly got used to it and was less conscious of it.

After all, she and Mo Yesi were already husband and wife.

It wasn’t anything embarrassing to be hugged by her own husband.

Moreover, since she’d already decided to try and accept him, then she had to adapt to this intimacy.

Of course, besides these reasons, she also had to admit that she enjoyed the feeling of being wrapped in his arms.

She felt warm and secure to be surrounded by his scent and cushioned by his chest.
