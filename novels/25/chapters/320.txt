Chapter 321: I Want Miss Shen to Make a Public Apology

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

No matter what she did, she wasn’t going to be able to change her role as the “love rival” in Shen Rou’s eyes.

Shen Rou’s attitude towards her wouldn’t change as well.

This brother of hers was Qiao Mianmian’s precious.

Otherwise, she wouldn’t have agreed to marry Mo Yesi for the sake of Qiao Chen’s surgery back then. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The brother she doted on the most had been insulted so terribly by Shen Rou. It wasn’t strange that she would lose her cool.

She smiled coldly and responded to Jiang Luoli’s comment, “That’s right. This is the Young Miss of the Shen family. Given that the Shen family has some cultural background and foundation, I’d expected their children to at least be reasonably respectful.

“But looking at Miss Shen’s mannerism, it really shocks me.”

Jiang Luoli appeared to be in deep thought as she said, “Some people think they’re so much better just because their family is more well-off, and that anyone who gives them a second look is seeking connections.

“But she doesn’t know that she’s just a joke to people. Ha, what renowned family? I don’t give a crap how good you are, our Chen Chen just doesn’t care for it. Oh, and I think I heard that it was Young Lady Shen’s younger sister who pursued our Chen Chen first?”

She imitated Shen Rou’s previous look of disdain and mocked. “Some people are just blind and deaf and insist on distorting obvious facts. Who even saw Chen Chen harassing her sister?”

Shen Rou’s expression darkened.

Jiang Luoli didn’t speak softly.

Many people had turned around when they heard her telling Shen Rou off.

Some of them knew Shen Rou and began engaging in private conversations.

Shen Rou had to watch her image now and couldn’t use equally harsh words to retaliate. She tried to force her anger down as she said, “Miss Qiao, what happened just now was all a misunderstanding. Indeed, I jumped to conclusions before getting things clear and maligned your brother. I apologize for that.”

More people turned to look at her.

Shen Rou had no choice but to apologize despite her indignance.

She had to maintain her image as the classy and gracious Young Lady Shen who didn’t pick fights with others in public.

But Qiao Mianmian never intended to accept this patronizing apology.

She sneered. “Miss Shen used such harsh words to insult my brother. You think you can brush it off by saying it’s just a misunderstanding?”

Shen Rou frowned when she saw that Qiao Mianmian didn’t give her an out. “What do you want, then?”

Qiao Mianmian eyed her directly. “Miss Shen humiliated my brother, and everyone here heard it. So, I want Miss Shen to make a public apology.”

She pointed at the piano stage and said, “There’s a microphone there. If Miss Shen is sincere about apologizing, please do so on stage.”

Shen Rou’s eyes widened as if completely shaken. “You want me to apologize on stage?”

“That’s right.”

Qiao Mianmian sounded assertive and left no room for negotiation. “Go onto the stage and apologize to my brother. Say that you maligned him, and apologize to him directly.

“This sort of apology would be considered sincere.”

Shen Rou clenched her fists and her jaw. “Qiao Mianmian, don’t go overboard.”

“Overboard?” Qiao Mianmian smirked. “I don’t think I’ve gone as far as Young Lady Shen. Look at the way you told my brother off with those crude and rude words. Why don’t you say that you’ve gone overboard instead?”
