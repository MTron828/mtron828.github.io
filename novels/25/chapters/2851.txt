She didn’t want to be ruthless, but they had crossed the line now.

She just wanted to kill those two damn reporters.

Because the person who leaked the news described what happened last night clearly, with photos and videos as evidence, and someone claiming to know the inside story even appeared in the comment section. He said that Gong Zeli and Qiao Mianmian were already having an affair, and everyone in their circle knew about it.

Most of the people who didn’t know the truth actually believed this.

They criticized them for being immoral.

The netizens were the ones who scolded Qiao Mianmian the most.

They all scolded her for being unfaithful and shameless. She had such an outstanding husband, but she still wasn’t satisfied. She even wanted to cheat on another man.

Many netizens also tagged Gong Zeli’s Weibo and told him to leave her alone.

“Qiao Mianmian is too disgusting. Her husband is so outstanding and perfect, how could she not be satisfied? Moreover, she cheated on him with Gong Zeli. Gong Zeli and Mo Yesi have been good friends for many years, a rabbit wouldn’t eat the grass by its nest.”

“I now believe that Gong Zeli and Mo Yesi broke up because of Qiao Mianmian. Ahhh, these two are my Prince Charming, but why are their taste so bad? They actually fell for such a shameless woman.”

“What kind of woman can’t the Young Master of the Gong family get? How did he fall for a married woman? The two male Gods of Yuncheng City have fallen for her. I wonder what’s her charm. She must be a vixen.”

“If I were Mo Yesi, I’d definitely divorce her.”

“Now that their private meeting has been exposed, Mo Yesi definitely can’t tolerate it. The entire internet knows that he’s been cheated on. He won’t be able to keep his face if he doesn’t divorce Qiao Mianmian.”

In the comment section, many people were already predicting that Qiao Mianmian and Mo Yesi would definitely divorce.

Some even said that Mo Yesi should have chosen Shen Rou.

She had liked him for so many years and was devoted to him. She definitely wouldn’t betray him.

“Sigh, it’s such a pity for Young Lady Shen.”

“Yes, I also think that Young Lady Shen and Mo Yesi are more compatible. If they were together, this definitely wouldn’t have happened.”

“What a pity. I heard that Young Lady Shen has gone crazy. Even if Mo Yesi divorces, they probably won’t be together anymore.”

“Sigh, it’s a pity.”

Qiao Mianmian looked at the time.

She opened WeChat and then looked at the call history.

Mo Yesi didn’t even contact her.

Mo Yesi would always send her WeChat messages in the morning, afternoon, and evening.

The post was posted an hour ago.

Mo Yesi’s WeChat and phone call usually came at this time.

But now…

Qiao Mianmian didn’t know if it was because Mo Yesi had seen the post.

Would he believe what the news said?

She thought for a while and sent a WeChat message.

Qiao Mianmian: [Have you seen my scandal with Gong Zeli? It’s not true, I can explain it to you.]

Mo Yesi replied almost immediately.

Mo Yesi: [Alright. Explain.]

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

It seemed like she wasn’t overthinking.

He was really angry with her.
