Chapter 2196: If You Don’t Answer Me, I Won’t Let Go

Gu Sheng frowned. “Bai Yusheng, please respect others. What bald head? He has a name.”

“If he’s not bald, what is he? Ha, are you anxious because I’m saying that he’s bald? Gu Sheng, could it be that you like that baldy? I remember that you didn’t have such low standards in the past.”

Gu Sheng’s expression changed.

She said angrily, “Bai Yusheng, I’ve taken a liking to him. What has it got to do with you? My low standards have nothing to do with you. Get out of my way. I have nothing to say to you.”

Gu Sheng could hardly believe that Bai Yusheng had become like this.

In her impression, he wasn’t such a foul-mouthed person.

Bai Yusheng stood still.

Seeing that he showed no reaction, Gu Sheng got even angrier. “Bai Yusheng, what are you trying to do?”

“Why did you say to that baldy that you’re not familiar with me? Also, why did you agree to have dinner with him? Gu Sheng, that man isn’t suitable for you. He’s not worthy of you. No matter how much you want marriage, you can’t get together with someone like that.”

Bai Yusheng didn’t know what he was trying to do.

He didn’t even know why he came over to speak to Gu Sheng.

It didn’t matter what kind of man Gu Sheng wanted, that was her own business.

But Bai Yusheng felt that that baldy wasn’t worthy of her. As Gu Sheng’s friend, he couldn’t watch her fall into the pit.

Women were sometimes blinded by love.

As a friend, he had to remind her.

That baldy didn’t look good, and his character wasn’t good either. He was looking at Gu Sheng with eyes full of lust.

He was obviously a bad person.

Gu Sheng was stunned for a few seconds.

“What has all of this got to do with you? So what if that man isn’t good enough for me? Does this have anything to do with you? What kind of man I want to get together with is my business, it has nothing to do with you. Also, did I say something wrong? Are we very familiar with each other? I’m sorry, we only know each other, and we’re just ordinary friends.

“Please move aside, I have something on.”

Gu Sheng tried to push him aside, but Bai Yusheng grabbed her wrist. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Gu Sheng was stunned for a while and then growled angrily. “Bai Yusheng, what are you doing? Let go of me.”

“Then, answer me. Will you really have dinner with that baldy?”

“It has nothing to do with you. Let go!”

“If you don’t answer me, I won’t let go.”

“Why do I have to answer you? I’m not your woman. If you don’t let go, I’ll scream that you’re molesting me.”

“Then, do it.” Bai Yusheng didn’t panic at all. He continued holding her wrist. “Scream. I want to see if anyone will believe that I’m molesting you.”

Gu Sheng didn’t expect him to be so thick-skinned.

She struggled a little, but it was useless. In her anger, she grabbed his hand and bit it.

Bai Yusheng didn’t expect her to do this. Gu Sheng bit him hard on the back of his hand, making him grunt in pain.

“Brother.”

Qiao Mianmian was shocked to see this.

Bai Yusheng turned around in shock.

At this moment, Gu Sheng freed her hand from his grasp and ran away.
