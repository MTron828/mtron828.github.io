Chapter 1610: Young Master’s So Good-Looking

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

At night, Gong Zeli drove back to the Gong Residence.

Like Mo Yesi, he had his own place.

He only went home occasionally.

Madam Gong only had one son, Gong Zeli.

Hence, she had pampered and doted on him since he was little. Gong Zeli didn’t come home often, and Madam Gong would make all sorts of preparations when he did.

“Madam, Young Master is back.”

Just as Madam Gong was greeting them in the kitchen, a housemaid entered and reported.

“Zeli is back?” Madam Gong looked happy and called for the kitchen. “Young Master is back, hurry up. Bring out a bowl of the soup I made. Let him drink it to relieve the heat.”

“Oh right, Qingqing.” Madam Gong turned to look at Shangguan Qing and held her hand. “Bring the soup to Zeli later.”

Shangguan Qing was also very happy to know that Gong Zeli was back. But when she thought about his coldness and alienation towards her yesterday, she felt a little uneasy.

“Auntie, will Brother Zeli be unhappy to see me in your house?”

“How could that be?”

Madam Gong smiled and said, “He’ll only be happy. Moreover, you’re my guest, why do you care if he’s happy or not?”

“But...” Qiao Mianmian’s face appeared in Shangguan Qing’s mind.

Qiao Mianmian, that vixen.

As the rumors said, she and Bai Yusheng had something going on.

Yesterday, Bai Yusheng actually protected her and said that she was his sister.

That slut was using her looks to seduce men.

Shameless!

Slut!

Gong Zeli was her man. She wouldn’t let him be seduced by any vixen. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

She had to find a chance to teach that shameless slut a lesson.

“Just listen to me. Don’t you want to marry Zeli?”

Shangguan Qing immediately nodded. “Of course.”

“Then listen to me. I won’t hurt you.”

Shangguan Qing pursed her lips and nodded shyly after a few seconds of silence.

...

“Hello, Young Master.”

When Gong Zeli walked into the living room, all the housemaids greeted him respectfully.

After greeting him, one of the maids secretly looked up and then looked away.

Young Master was really good-looking.

Even though they’d been in the Gong Residence for many years and had seen Gong Zeli many times, their hearts would still flutter every time they saw him.

Everyone knew that Gong Zeli had a bad temper.

Everyone in the residence knew this.

Hence, the servants were respectful and afraid of him. But this didn’t stop them from being smitten by him.

Besides personality.

Gong Zeli did have a beautiful face.

He looked like Madam Gong.

And Madam Gong, like Madam Mo, was a socialite.

Gong Zeli walked to the lobby and looked around. He found a housemaid and asked, “Where’s Madam? Why isn’t she here?”

The housemaid replied, “Madam is preparing dinner for Young Master.”

“Why go through so much trouble? Just get the kitchen to prepare something.”

Just as Gong Zeli finished speaking, he heard Madam Gong’s voice behind him.

She greeted him affectionately. “Zeli, you’re back. Are you hungry? Are you thirsty?”

Shangguan Qing followed behind her holding a bowl of soup.
