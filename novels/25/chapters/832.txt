Chapter 833: I Don’t Trust You Anymore

“When I found you, you were lying by the pool, completely drenched and motionless. I was so afraid that you wouldn’t wake up.

“I immediately went to look for someone else. When you were saved, I saw you looking at me with gratitude. Then, you asked if I saved you...” Shen Rou recalled what happened that night and cried even harder.

“We had fought, so I thought that you wouldn’t be angry with me if I admitted it.”

“So, you lied to me?”

Although he already knew that Shen Rou lied to him, Gong Zeli couldn’t help but feel angry when she admitted it.

“Yes.” Shen Rou wiped the tears from the corner of her eyes and cried until her voice was hoarse. “I didn’t think too much at that time. I just hoped that you could forgive me as soon as possible and not be angry with me anymore. The moment I nodded and saw the look in your eyes, I knew that you had forgiven me.

“After that, whenever I wanted to tell you that I wasn’t the one who saved you that night, I would be afraid that you’d get angry with me again. There were so many times I really wanted to tell you, but I didn’t have the courage.

“And do you know, ever since I lied to you and told you that I was the one who saved you that night, I realized that you treated me much better than before. You got more patient and gentle with me. Before, many of the things I did would make you angry. But after that, even if I did the same thing, you would tolerate me and wouldn’t lose your temper with me.

“You suddenly started to treat me so well and pamper me. I was afraid that I’d lose everything if I told you the truth.

“When someone treats you too well, you get used to it and can’t bear to lose it.”

Gong Zeli couldn’t help but sneer. “So, this is your reason for lying to me?”

Shen Rou shook her head as tears rolled down her cheeks. “I never thought of lying to you...”

Gong Zeli looked down at her expressionlessly. “But you lied to me for 10 years.”

“I didn’t do it on purpose...” Shen Rou seemed to be at a loss for words. “I really didn’t do it on purpose. Ze Li, can you forgive me? I didn’t dare to tell you the truth because I cared too much about you and was afraid of losing you.

“Don’t tell me that our friendship over the past decade is nothing? We’ve known each other for so many years, is it not as important as that woman whose name and appearance you even know?

“Just because she saved you, she’s more important to you than me, right?”

“If you still care about our friendship of more than 10 years, you shouldn’t have lied to me. Shen Rou, do you still not know where you’re wrong? It’s not that I don’t cherish you as a friend, but your actions make me feel that there’s no need to cherish you anymore.

“Because I don’t know if you’re lying to me about anything else. I don’t trust you anymore.”

And without trust, how could they still be friends?

“No, this is the only thing I lied to you about.” Shen Rou grabbed his arm tightly as if she was holding onto a life-saving straw. “Believe me, this is the only thing I’ve ever lied to you about.”F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com
