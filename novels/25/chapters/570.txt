Chapter 571: You’re Always Right Because You’re the Boss

Recalling the results of his search just now, he hesitated. After that, he begrudgingly responded to the message: [Send it to me.]

Yan Shaoqing was quick to respond.

In a matter of minutes, he sent a large zip file to Mo Yesi’s mailbox.

He then replied on WeChat: [I’ve sent it to you already, Second Bro. There are ten videos in total, and they’re all classics. I can personally guarantee that your sex life with Sis-in-law will get better after watching them. Tell me when you’re done watching them. I have quite a collection in my catalog. Good things are meant to be shared. I’ll send it to you next time.]

Mo Yesi frowned as he read the message and replied in denial: [It doesn’t have to do with your sis-in-law. Stop with the nonsense.]

I Am Your Master Yan: [Hehe. Don’t try to lie to me, Second Bro. There’s nothing wrong with learning some ways to please your wife. Don’t need to be shy. Admit it.]

Mo Yesi: [Shut up.] Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

I Am Your Master Yan: [Alright, I’ll shut up. You’re always right since you’re the boss.]

Mo Yesi didn’t want to continue the conversation. But just as he was about to exit WeChat, Yan Shaoqing sent more messages: [Second Bro, are you going to continue ignoring Fourth Bro? I’ve met him previously and asked him about it. He understood that he was in the wrong, but...]

A few moments later, he continued: [He didn’t have anything against Sis-in-law actually. He just... felt that Rourou was wronged and wanted to seek justice for her. You know that he had been so protective of her all this while, but he really does treasure our friendship. I think he knows that he’s in the wrong already. But his pride is preventing him from apologizing. Why don’t we head out for dinner together tomorrow and let... bygones be bygones?]

The sound of running water stopped.

The door opened and steam escaped from the inside.

Mo Yesi couldn’t help but be drawn towards it.

The steam thinned out as Qiao Mianmian exited from the bathroom after her shower.

She was wearing a silk nightgown, and her hair was tied up as she walked towards the vanity table.

As she had just showered, her skin seemed to be glowing.

A hint of pink could also be seen in her skin as she had just emerged from a hot shower. She looked like a peach ready to be eaten.

Mo Yesi wanted to sink his teeth into it.

He could smell her fragrance even at a distance.

Mo Yesi stared at her silky-smooth back as his desire for her grew. He turned and started to walk towards her.

Meanwhile on WeChat.

Yan Shaoqing sent another text as Mo Yesi didn’t reply: [Reply me, Second Bro. Can you bring Sis-in-law out for the meal tomorrow?]

Mo Yesi couldn’t be bothered about him right now.

He locked his phone and threw it onto the bed. He then slowly approached Qiao Mianmian.

As he got closer, the fragrance grew more intense. It was like an addictive drug that caused him to lose control of himself. He could feel his thirst for her growing.

Qiao Mianmian was currently applying her skincare products.

Just as she was about to apply her night cream, she noticed a long shadow appear in the mirror behind her.
