Chapter 1489: Miss Qiao, Why Don’t We Talk Over There?

“Director Zhao.”

But the director didn’t seem to hear her.

Qiao Anxin got even angrier. She bit her lip and called out again, “Director Zhao.”

At this moment, the director finally looked away from Qiao Mianmian.

But he still ignored Qiao Anxin and looked back at Qiao Mianmian. “Miss Qiao, I see that your skin is very good. I want to ask, can you do the shooting bare-faced?

“I think you can add points to the product by showing it to the audience.”

It was rare for an artiste to appear on screen without makeup.

Most female artistes wouldn’t agree.

Actually, the director wouldn’t usually make such a request.

Hence, he regretted it the next moment.

But he felt that Qiao Mianmian’s skin was especially good, and heavy makeup wasn’t suitable. It would be more acceptable if she didn’t wear makeup.

With her looks, she could fight even without makeup.

She was completely different from Qiao Anxin, who needed cosmetics to look good.

That was why the director suggested going on screen without makeup.

This request stunned Qiao Anxin.

But she wasn’t happy.

She knew Qiao Mianmian looked without makeup.

“Film without makeup? Alright.” Qiao Mianmian nodded without much consideration.

She agreed too quickly.

The director was stunned and asked with uncertainty, “Are you sure? I want a bare face. No makeup at all.”

Qiao Mianmian nodded. “Mm, I’m sure. Didn’t you just ask that? Is there a problem?”

Of course.

The director only confirmed it with her because he was too shocked.

After all, Qiao Mianmian was the first to agree to his request.

Other female celebrities would actually put on light makeup even if they said they were bare-faced.

It wasn’t a real face, but a fake one.

Hence, Qiao Mianmian was the first female artiste to agree to his request.

“No problem!” After confirming that she was really willing to shoot the commercial bare-faced, the director seemed a little agitated. “Miss Qiao, regarding the filming situation later, I think we can talk about it in detail now. Miss Qiao, why don’t we talk over there?”

The director wanted them to talk somewhere else.

Qiao Anxin’s expression darkened.

She was fuming.

Before Qiao Mianmian came, she was still chatting with the director.

But when Qiao Mianmian arrived, the director seemed to have completely forgotten about her.

Qiao Anxin thought that her fame and status in the entertainment industry were way higher than Qiao Mianmian’s. She felt that the director would definitely prioritize her and not take Qiao Mianmian seriously.

But now, the director seemed very interested in Qiao Mianmian.

She was the one being neglected.

She looked like a newbie.

This made Qiao Anxin extremely upset.

It was fine if she couldn’t compare to Qiao Mianmian in other places. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

But Qiao Mianmian was just a newbie, why should the director value her?
