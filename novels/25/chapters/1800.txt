Chapter 1803: This Person Was Simply Ridiculous

Moreover, she felt that someone like Gong Zeli wouldn’t lie like this.

She broke out in cold sweat again.

“You saw someone following me? Who is it?”

“A man in his forties. He’s not very tall, and he looks ordinary. You’d forget him the moment you saw him. After you walked to the opposite street, he probably knew you’d found out about him and left.”

Qiao Mianmian’s expression changed.

“It might be a resident.” Gong Zeli analyzed. “Seeing a pretty girl walking alone on the streets, he might have some ill intentions. Why are you out alone at night?”

Gong Zeli frowned. “Don’t you know it’s dangerous?”

Did she not know what she looked like?

She was so ostentatious and even wandered the streets alone at night.

And in such a small town.

Gong Zeli wasn’t lying to her. This was indeed a chance encounter.

He was indeed here to settle something. He didn’t expect to meet her here.

He just glanced out the window when he saw her.

When he saw her, he noticed a man following behind her. That man looked sneaky and was obviously following her. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

He was so shocked that he didn’t even have time to say a word before coming down to look for her.

At the thought of the danger she was in, Gong Zeli’s expression darkened. “Do you know how dangerous it is to encounter such a thing? In a foreign place, and you being a weak woman. If someone really... Do you know how terrible the consequences would be?”

Because he was worried and anxious, his voice sounded a little fierce.

He seemed to be criticizing her.

Qiao Mianmian frowned. “Gong Zeli, why are you yelling at me? Even if I’m in danger, what has it got to do with you?

“Also, I didn’t come alone. I came with the rest of the crew. I’m not stupid. How could I wander here alone at night?”

She felt that this person was ridiculous.

Was she close to him?

What was their relationship?

Gong Zeli was stunned. Seeing that she seemed a little angry, he frowned and narrowed his eyes. “Qiao Mianmian, I’m not yelling at you. You’re right, this has nothing to do with me. But...”

But she was the person he liked.

How could he not worry about her?

When he saw that she was being followed, his heart tightened. He was afraid that she would be hurt, so he ran all the way down.

He heaved a sigh of relief when he saw that she was safe and sound.

He had never been so worried about anyone.

But she... seemed to have grabbed his heart. He couldn’t ignore her every move.

Qiao Mianmian looked at him solemnly. “But what?”

Gong Zeli pursed his thin lips and his eyes flickered. He avoided her dark eyes. “It’s nothing. Your matter has nothing to do with me. It’s just that you’re Ah Si’s woman. I can’t just watch you be in danger and pretend not to see it. If Ah Si finds out, what will he think?”

He finally thought of a suitable reason.
