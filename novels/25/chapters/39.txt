Chapter 40: Only Qiao Mianmian in His Eyes

The corners of the lips of the handsome and noble man slightly lifted up.

The layer of coldness and alienation that enveloped him faded away instantly. He slowly straightened up, opened his long legs, and walked towards the astonished Qiao Mianmen step by step.

Before Qiao Mianmian had recovered, the man’s slender figure was in front of her, his falling shadow blocking her.

Mo Yesi took her into his arms, his voice low. “Baby, why did you go to the bathroom for so long? If you hadn’t come out again, I would have gone in to find you.”

Not far away.

Seeing this scene, what else did the woman not understand?

After looking at Qiao Mianmian enviously, she turned awkwardly and left.

Qiao Mianmian couldn’t help but look at the woman. She hesitated and asked, “Who is that, was it someone you know?”

It was a very beautiful woman.

Mo Yesi followed her gaze and looked indifferently back at her. “I don’t know her.”

“But I just saw you guys talking?”

“Huh?” The man froze, then a low, soft chuckle sounded in his throat. “Are you jealous?”

Qiao Mianmian’s face turned red.

“No... no.” She immediately denied. “I was just asking casually. I’m not so petty to be jealous of you talking to someone else.”

Besides, she knew her identity very well.

They just married for some convenient reason, not because they loved each other.

To put it plainly, they were just a couple in name.

How could she be qualified to be jealous?

The moment Qiao Mianmian got the marriage certificate from him, she knew clearly that she wouldn’t do anything she shouldn’t do.

“You can be petty.” The man’s deep eyes looked down at her intensely. “Qiao Mianmian, we are now married and are a couple. You are my wife, so if you feel that I’m too close with another woman, you have all the rights to be jealous and angry.”

Qiao Mianmian looked up into the dark eyes of the man and her heart skipped a beat. Her heartbeat accelerated.

“But you really don’t need to mind the woman just now.” Mo Yesi chuckled again and turned her around to return to the restaurant. “I really don’t know her, and she came over to chat with me, but I have no interest in her.

“You see that she’s gone now too.”

“Now that we are married, I will adhere to the attitude that a husband should have. So rest assured that I won’t mess around with other women outside. Furthermore...”

The man’s voice paused and he went silent. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“Furthermore?” Qiao Mianmian looked up at him and asked curiously.

“Furthermore...” Mo Yesi turned his head and looked down, his deep eyes falling on her beautiful and delicate face. The bottom of his eyes flashed a very strange color quickly. “That woman is less than one-tenth of you. My standards are not so low.”

At this moment, Qiao Mianmian’s heartbeat, which had just calmed down, suddenly began to beat wildly.
