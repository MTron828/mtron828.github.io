Chapter 1127: My Sister Is Indeed Unusual With Young Master Gong

Did she want to find out the truth through her?

If that was the case, she couldn’t miss this opportunity.

Qiao Mianmian, that little b*tch, had been too smug recently. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

If Eldest Miss Shen wanted to teach her a lesson, even if she managed to cozy up to Young Master Gong, he would definitely side with her.

She could make use of Eldest Miss Shen to teach that b*tch a lesson!

At this thought, Qiao Anxin’s attitude became warmer, and the wariness in her eyes lessened. “If Miss Shen wants to know anything from me, I won’t hide anything that I know.”

Shen Rou smiled and looked at Qiao Anxin with a deeper meaning in her eyes. “Miss Qiao is indeed a smart person. I love dealing with smart people because it’s not tiring to talk to them.

“Since Miss Qiao has already guessed the purpose of my meeting with you, I won’t beat around the bush with you.”

Qiao Anxin was elated to see that she had guessed correctly.

Great, this Eldest Miss Shen had indeed asked her out because of Qiao Mianmian.

It seemed like it was really because of the little b*tch’s scandal with the Gong family’s young master.

This little b*tch deserved to be unlucky.

She could have provoked anyone’s man, but she had to provoke Eldest Miss Shen’s man.

Even if Eldest Miss Shen and Gong Zeli weren’t together.

However, their relationship must be ambiguous.

Miss Shen would never allow her admirers to have an ambiguous relationship with other women.

Since the little b*tch wanted to die.

She didn’t mind letting her die faster!

“Miss Shen, are you asking me if the rumors about my sister and Young Master Gong are true?” Qiao Anxin thought that she had guessed correctly and said eagerly, “I know about this. Those rumors are true. My sister’s relationship with Young Master Gong is indeed extraordinary.”

Actually, Qiao Anxin didn’t know the relationship between Gong Zeli and Qiao Mianmian.

Like the other netizens, her understanding of this matter was based on the rumors on Weibo.

However, in front of Shen Rou, she acted as though she knew the whole story. She lied without even blinking her eyes. “Actually, Young Master Gong wasn’t interested in her at the start, but my sister never gives up until she has achieved her goal. She will do everything she can to get her hands on the man she fancies. She relies on her good looks and is especially proactive. She successfully seduced countless men since she was young. Miss Shen, you should know that it is very difficult for men to reject a woman who is good-looking and very proactive.

“I’m guessing Young Master Gong is just playing with her, but...”

As Qiao Anxin spoke, she stole a glance at Shen Rou’s expression. Seeing that Shen Rou’s face had darkened, it was obvious that she was angry. Secretly delighted, she continued, “My sister is a very scheming woman, especially willing to go all out. When that time comes, I’m afraid that Young Master Gong will get sick of her and want to kick her, but she won’t let go of him.”

Even if Gong Zeli was just playing with Qiao Mianmian, Qiao Anxin would still feel upset.

Qiao Mianmian was such a b*tch. What was so good about her other than her good looks?

What right did she have to attract a superior man like Gong Zeli?

After Qiao Anxin finished speaking, Shen Rou’s expression darkened.
