Chapter 247: Missing the Previous Soft and Cute Girl

Frowning, she originally wanted to ignore him, but she didn’t want him to follow after her. As soon as she walked out of the Su family’s door, Su Ze caught up with her.

He stood in front of her, blocking her path.

“Mianmian, let’s talk.”

Qiao Mianmian looked up and glanced coldly at him. “Make way.”

Su Ze didn’t move and just stared at the girl in front of him. He said in a strained voice, “Mianmian, can we talk? I have something to say to you.”

“I have nothing to say to you,” Qiao Mianmian said with disgust, her voice cold.

Su Ze felt very hurt by her indifference and the disgust in her eyes.

Qiao Mianmian was now a hedgehog covered with pricks.

Her thorns stood up at the sight of him.

She refused to communicate with him.

She was more indifferent and alienated to him than to strangers.

Su Ze was unaccustomed to it and found it very difficult to accept.

He started to miss the soft and cute girl from the past.

“Mianmian, don’t be like this.” Su Ze looked very hurt. “I know I have let you down, and I’ve also thought of making it up to you. But you’re not willing to give me a chance to make it up to you. Tell me, what can I do for you to forgive me?”

Qiao Mianmian didn’t expect Su Ze to have the face to say such things.

He still wanted to gain her forgiveness?

How thick was his skin for him to say such shameless words?

He was so shameless that even Mother Su couldn’t stand it anymore.

Stepping forward, Mother Su simply slapped him on the head. “You bastard. After everything you’ve done, you still have the face to ask Mianmian for forgiveness? Go back quickly and don’t come out again to embarrass yourself!”

“Mom.”

Su Ze avoided Mother Su’s slap and said angrily, “I really have something to say to Mianmian. You don’t understand anything, so don’t mess with my affairs.”

Mother Su slapped him again, her body shaking with rage. “I don’t understand? You have even made that shameless vixen pregnant, so am I wronging you? Let me tell you, don’t think that she can enter our Su family just because she has a child. She won’t succeed as long as I’m alive.”

“Mom, that’s your grandson!”

“What grandson? I won’t acknowledge him! She’s such a casual woman. If she can seduce you shamelessly, she can seduce other men as well. Who knows who the baby in her belly belongs to. Do you believe her that much?”

“Mom, what are you talking about? Other than me, Anxin doesn’t have another man. Who else could the baby be other than your grandson?”

They started quarreling.

Qiao Mianmian stood aside and watched for a few seconds, before giving up the idea of mediating between them and simply turning to leave. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Scum like Su Ze should be taught a lesson by Mother Su.

She had no reason to stop Mother Su.

Walking quickly across the road, she headed towards the black Rolls Royce that was parked quietly under the Wutong tree.

As soon as she walked to the door, the car door opened with a “click”.

The man sitting in the back compartment looked up, revealing a handsome and noble face. His dark and deep eyes fell on her, and he stared tenderly at her.

Meeting his gaze, Qiao Mianmian’s lips curled up involuntarily.

She bent down and got into the car.

The moment she got on, the strong man pulled her into his embrace.

He wrapped his slender arms around her waist, encircling her possessively.

“Is everything resolved?”

The man said in a low, magnetic voice when the car door closed.
