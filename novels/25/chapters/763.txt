Chapter 764: Mm... Honey, Are You Happy?

“This negative news is too much. It can kill her directly. And the person who posted it seems to have a strong backing. He doesn’t seem afraid at all.

“I think your boyfriend’s real identity must be really impressive.

“I heard that the sugar daddy behind Huang Yilin is rather powerful. He’s the Young Master of the Yan family, one of the four most powerful families in Yuncheng City. I wonder how Young Master Yan treats her and whether he’ll help her. If Young Master Yan is willing to help her, I think he can settle this matter.”

“Cough, cough, cough...”

Qiao Mianmian started coughing.

The sugar daddy behind Huang Yilin was Yan Shaoqing?

Was this true?

“Sister Mianmian, what’s wrong? Are you alright?” Seeing her coughing so badly, Nana patted her back a few times.

“I’m fine.” Qiao Mianmian took a deep breath and waved at her. She then looked up with teary eyes. “You said that her sugar daddy is Young Master Yan? Is it Yan Shaoqing?”

“Yes.”

Nana nodded. “The Young Master of the Yan family. The Yan family is very powerful. If he wants to help Huang Yilin, he can definitely settle this matter. But I heard that this Young Master Yan is rather fickle, and he has more than one lover. So, it’s hard to say if he will help her. Unless Huang Yilin is especially favored by him.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

If it was Mo Yesi who got someone to do it.

Yan Shaoqing wouldn’t interfere.

Just as she thought this, her cell phone vibrated. She looked down and saw that Mo Yesi had replied to her on WeChat.

He replied: [Mm... Honey, are you happy?]

Qiao Mianmian was speechless. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

It really was him.

Of course... she was happy.

When Huang Yilin got someone to hype up her scandal with Tu Yilei, she wanted to kill her.

If she was just a newbie without any backing and had such a scandal with Tu Yilei, and Tu Yilei didn’t speak up for her, what would her ending be?

She’d have been forced out of the industry by Tu Yilei’s fans.

Now that someone was taking revenge for her, how could she not be happy?

After reading Mo Yesi’s reply, she smiled and replied: [Mm... Happy.]

Mo Yesi instantly replied: [Call me Hubby, then.]

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

Mo Yesi: [Honey, I want to hear it.]

She’d already said it in person, so there was nothing to be embarrassed about.

Qiao Mianmian didn’t mind rewarding him since he performed so well.

She sent him a message: [Hubby.]

Mo Yesi quickly replied: [Baby, I want a voice message. Can you send me a voice message: If you want to hear my baby’s voice, call me Hubby.]

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

This man was going overboard.

She looked at Nana still standing by the side and pursed her lips. Her cheeks burned as she replied: [I’m on set, there’s someone beside me.]

Mo Yesi: [Then, when you get back, we’ll video call each other, alright? Baby, when I’m not by your side, you have to take good care of yourself. Remember, no matter what happens, Hubby will always have your back. If anyone dares to bully you, I’ll pay them back a hundred times over.]

Qiao Mianmian felt warm inside as she read the message.

Yes, she wasn’t alone anymore.

She had a family, a husband, and someone she could rely on.
