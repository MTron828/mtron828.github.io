Chapter 500: Are You Saying That This Person Is a Man?

She was wearing a plain white t-shirt, pale blue denim, and a pair of white shoes. It suited her age and looked well on her.

But she looked as though she was just eighteen years old.

Way younger than her actual age.

It made him feel as though he was dating an underage girl.

Mo Yesi wasn’t sure what kind of woman he would find attractive.

But he was sure of it now.

He was attracted to girls like Qiao Mianmian that had a girl-next-door look.

She looked so sweet.

She tasted... even sweeter.

It was the kind of sweetness that was addictive.

Once you tried it, you would crave for it all the time.

Mo Yesi didn’t even realize his expression when looking at Qiao Mianmian.

Anyone walking in now would be shocked by what they saw.

They would be shocked by how their cool Chairman Mo could be so gentle.

Mo Yesi kept quiet as he stared at the girl on the sofa. He then stood up and approached her gently.

Qiao Mianmian was focused on her game.

She didn’t even notice that Mo Yesi was already next to her.

Mo Yesi kept quiet and continued to look at her while he stood next to her.

Only when Qiao Mianmian was done with her game and stretched did she notice the man next to her.

“You’re done with your work?” She took a look at the time on her cell phone. It was already half past 11.

“Yes.”

Mo Yesi sat down next to her and pulled her into his arms.

He liked holding Qiao Mianmian this way.

The lady in his arms was soft and smelled really good. As he held her, he understood what it meant to be in love.

It could be addicting to hug someone.

“You were playing a game just now?” His voice was raspy, as he spoke near her, she could feel his warm breath on her cheeks.

Qiao Mianmian nodded. “Mm.”

“What games was it? Is it Honor of Kings you mentioned previously?”

“Yes,” Qiao Mianmian replied enthusiastically as she recalled it. “The new season just started, and there are a lot of good players playing ranked games. Just now, we died in the gank fight. But one person survived and managed to kill-steal the dragon that the opponent was trying to kill. He also successfully killed off all the members of the opposing team.

“After that, he managed to win the match with just minions.

“That was so amazing!

“He was so good. I wanted to add him as a friend. But he didn’t allow it. He feels like an older brother with a really cool personality.

“His gaming ID was interesting too, ‘Luxurious Dream in Changan.’”

Mo Yesi started to get jealous as he listened to her talk about the person.

She even called him her older brother?

She hadn’t even addressed him that way before.

His hand on her hip tightened as he asked, “Are you saying that this person is a man?”

“Of course he’s a guy. It’s rare for a girl to be so good. Plus, girls rarely play assassin characters too,” Qiao Mianmian continued, unaware of Mo Yesi’s jealousy.

He then took her phone without a word.
