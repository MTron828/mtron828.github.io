Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Especially when the post was released, the comments were so numerous that they couldn’t be seen clearly.

The fans were screaming non-stop.

“Feibao is out. Gosh, Feibao is so beautiful tonight.”

“If I’m not wrong, Feibao’s dress is a limited edition C brand. I heard that this dress is very expensive. A few top-tier actresses went to borrow it from the C brand, but they didn’t agree. Feibao is actually wearing this dress now. C brand really has good taste. Feibao’s aura really matches it.”

“The fact that C brand lent this dress to Feibao shows that they acknowledge her popularity and capability. It turns out that Card C’s judgment is right. Only Feibao can pull it off so well.”

“That’s right, that’s right. Feibao is so beautiful tonight. I think our Feibao is going to be the best-dressed winner tonight.”

The moment a young girl in a white tutu dress, with curly hair and a crystal crown on her head walked onto the red carpet, the live stream started flooding again.

Screams could also be heard.

Many fans waved at the young girl and screamed. “Song Fei, Song Fei!”

“Feibao, you’re so beautiful tonight!”

“Feibao, we’ll love you forever!” nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“Feibao, ah, Mom doesn’t allow you to be so skinny. Eat more!”

The young girl turned around and waved at her fans.

The fans got even more excited.

“Gosh, Feibao smiled at me. She’s so beautiful when she smiles.”

“I’m going to faint from happiness. Feibao looked at me, Feibao looked at me.”

On the red carpet, the female artiste whom the fans affectionately called “Feibao” was called Song Fei.

Song Fei was the captain of a singing group.

There were five people in the female group.

Song Fei was the best one.

She was attending the gala as one of the best performers of a certain drama.

In other words, the judges had chosen a few theme songs for the television series, and Song Fei’s song was considered one of the best.

This was a very good result for her.

She was considered a newbie in the entertainment industry.

If she could win this year’s Golden Globe Award, her future would be completely different.

Although she was popular now, it wasn’t that stable.

If she won the award, it would be equivalent to being under the government’s seal. The resources she could come into contact with in the future would definitely be much better than now.

Song Fei was 18 this year and a university student. As she debuted in an idol group, her looks were passable.

Her group was called MoonStar.

Song Fei was both the captain and the best-looking girl in the group.

She had the most fans.

The live stream was full of praises for her. The screen was filled with comments such as “Sister Fairy”, “Goddess Looks”, and “The Most Beautiful Little Fairy”.

With this similar praise, a certain netizen’s unique comment was very abrupt and eye-catching.

If you scold me, I’ll hit you: [Uh, in terms of looks, Qiao Mianmian is still number one in my heart. Song Fei is also rather good-looking, but compared to Qiao Mianmian, she isn’t exquisite enough. The praises from the fans are a little embarrassing..]
