Chapter 1545: Nothing Is More Important Than a Family Reunion

But compared to Mo Yesi and Mo Shixiu, who grew up in the Mo family, there was still a huge gap.

Qiao Chen was good-looking, had a sweet mouth, and excelled in his studies.

Although he had just reunited with her, Old Madam really liked him.

She was naturally very concerned about Qiao Chen.

“Mm, Dad wants me to learn and familiarize myself with the company’s business. I’ll go to the company with him when I’m free.”

Old Madam nodded. “The children of the Mo family can handle a lot of things very early. Your brother-in-law and your Big Cousin are the same. It’s not bad to familiarize yourself with them now. When you graduate, you can enter the company directly.

“Your dad only has you, so you’ll have to manage the company in the future. Our Mo family’s company can’t fall into the hands of outsiders.”

“Mm, Grandma is right.”

“A few years ago, your dad didn’t have a child, and Aunt Wen sent her nephew to the company. I had nothing to say then. But now that I have a biological grandson, I have to manage some things.

“Also, your Aunt Wen is very jealous. You’re not her biological child, so she has some opinions about you. If you feel aggrieved, tell Grandma. Grandma will help you talk to her. Anyway, remember, Grandma will always protect you, okay?”

Qiao Chen smiled. “Mm. I got it, Grandma. Actually, Aunt Wen is fine. She didn’t give me any grievances.”

“That’s good.”

“Mianmian, how are you getting along with your biological parents? I can see that your mother is a very gentle person. I can tell that she loves you very much.”

“Mm, Mom treats me very well.” Qiao Mianmian’s eyes warmed at the mention of Madam Bai. “Brother treats me very well too.”

“They’ve been looking for you for more than 10 years and haven’t given up. They must care a lot about you. Now that your family of four is reunited, it’s a happy thing. But, are you not planning to publicize this matter?”

Qiao Mianmian shook her head. “Mm, no. I think it’s fine as long as we’re a family. It’s not important if others know.”

“That’s true.” Old Madam sighed. “Nothing is more important than a family reunion. But even if it’s not made public, we still have to hold a small banquet and let some family and friends know about you.”

Qiao Mianmian had no objections to this. “Mom said so, too. Let’s find a time to hold it.”

“Speaking of finding someone, you should think about your wedding with Ah Si. I remember you saying that you’ll hold a wedding after graduation? You’re about to graduate, too.”

Qiao Mianmian was stunned. Now that Old Madam mentioned it, she realized that she was indeed going to graduate soon. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

She had said that she would hold the wedding after graduation.

“I think it’s time for Sister and Brother-in-law’s wedding too.” Qiao Chen agreed.

“I’ve already thought about the wedding.” Mo Yesi turned to look at Qiao Mianmian. “We’ll see what kind of wedding Mianmian likes.

“I think the suggestion given by my in-laws is not bad. The Bai family will hold one, and the Mo family will hold another.”

“In that case, we’ll have both Chinese- and Western-style weddings. Of course, this is your wedding, as long as it’s up to you.”

“Grandma, it’s still early.” Mo Yesi smiled. “We can discuss it later.”
