Chapter 2505: Shen Rou Will Definitely Deny It

He paused for a few seconds before continuing, “I’m not looking for a wife. What has it got to do with me?”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

Zhang Feng left after saying a few words.

Just as he left, Qiao Mianmian saw Linda walking towards her with a shocked expression.

“Mianmian…” Linda stopped in front of her and showed her the cell phone.

“Sister Xie, what’s wrong?” Qiao Mianmian took the cell phone and looked down. Then, she became shocked.

“Mianmian, about you and Gong Zeli. He came out personally to refute the rumors. Is what he said true? You really saved him in the past? You’re his savior?” Linda asked curiously.

Qiao Mianmian looked at Gong Zeli’s post and didn’t say anything. After a while, she looked up in surprise.

“You saw his post, right?” Linda asked.

“Mm.” Qiao Mianmian nodded. “I did.”

“Is what he said true?” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Qiao Mianmian hesitated for a few seconds before nodding. “I guess so.”

Linda asked, “You guess?”

Qiao Mianmian returned the cell phone to her. “I got into a car accident many years ago and forgot some things. I don’t remember saving him, but he said that I saved him that night. My dad also said that he took me to the Gong family banquet that night. I disappeared for a while, and when I returned, I was drenched.

“So, I think this is true.”

Linda was speechless.

After a long silence, she sighed. “I really didn’t expect you to be Young Master Gong’s savior. That Shen Rou is really disgusting. Not only did she take your credit, but she even spread rumors about you and Young Master Gong.

“I think she’s done for. Hmph, she deserves it. She shot herself in the foot. But it’s surprising that Gong Zeli is so heartless.

“Even if you were the one who saved him back then, he and Shen Rou must have known each other for many years. Their relationship was so ambiguous. I thought Gong Zeli wouldn’t do this.”

Qiao Mianmian kept quiet for a few seconds before smiling. “I didn’t expect it, either.”

“But this will save you a lot of trouble,” Linda said. “At least, you don’t have to clarify anything. I wonder how many people will believe Gong Zeli’s statement.”

Gong Zeli’s move surprised Qiao Mianmian.

It did solve a problem for her.

After he did this, he and Shen Rou would probably never be able to return to their former relationship.

Although Qiao Mianmian was grateful to him, she couldn’t help but frown when she thought about his feelings for her.

Gong Zeli’s post was unexpected.

Qiao Mianmian had already thought of how to resolve this.

But Gong Zeli’s Weibo post would be helpful to her. When the time came, she could beat Shen Rou even harder.

“Shen Rou will definitely deny it.” Qiao Mianmian thought about it and voiced her opinion. “It’s been so long since that incident. If she denies it, no one can find evidence that she’s lying.

“Even though the surveillance cameras recorded what happened that night, no one saved it.”
