Chapter 2484: If We Wait Anymore, Public Opinion Will Be Hard to Suppress

Based on Gong Zeli’s feelings for Shen Rou, he couldn’t possibly refuse to help her.

Unless he had a change of heart and liked someone else.

That person didn’t allow him to help the Shen family.

Another example.

Mo Yesi and Gong Zeli’s conflict was because of a woman.

Later, it was refuted.

But now that they thought about it, perhaps the rumors were true.

Gong Zeli and Mo Yesi had been buddies for so many years, but they suddenly fell out.

What unforgivable thing had happened for them to end up like this?

It made sense if it was because Qiao Mianmian and Gong Zeli had an affair.

No man could tolerate being made a cuckold.

And by his best friend, no less.

Everything that the person revealed was very reasonable and didn’t seem to be made up.

The netizens analyzed it and believed in their own judgment, believing that the information revealed was the truth.

At once, Qiao Mianmian became the target of public criticism.

The insults being hurled at her were getting more and more vicious.

Linda turned pale from anger.

She couldn’t imagine how angry Qiao Mianmian would be if she saw it.

“Mianmian, we can’t let Shen Rou’s Internet Water Army defame you like this. I’ll talk to the public relations department immediately and get them to remove the trending topics. Shen Rou hired the Internet Water Army to defame you, so we have to hire the Internet Water Army to control the comments.”

Unlike Linda’s anger, Qiao Mianmian was surprisingly calm. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“Sister Xie,” she called out to her softly. After a few seconds of silence, she said, “Don’t worry about this. I’ll handle it myself.”

“You’ll handle it yourself?” Linda was stunned.

“Mm, I can handle it myself. I don’t think there’s a need to rush. Let’s wait and see.”

“You still want to wait?” Linda was puzzled. “Many netizens believe what the whistle-blower said. Things now are disadvantageous to you. Get someone to delete the trending topics immediately and block the whistle-blower’s account. We must suppress this as soon as possible.

“If we wait any longer, it won’t be easy to suppress the public opinion.”

“We’ll see.” Qiao Mianmian narrowed her eyes. “I want to see what else that person has. I’ll wait for her to expose everything she has.”

Linda said, “But…”

“Sister Xie, trust me. I can definitely settle this. I’m not a fool. I won’t let others defame me without doing anything.”

Linda was silent for a while.

“Sigh, alright. Then, we’ll do as you say and wait a while more. But are you sure you can settle this? You really don’t need the company’s help?”

“I’m sure. Sister Xie, have you forgotten? I’m not alone. Don’t you always say that I have powerful backers? Even if I don’t handle it well, you should believe that the Bai and Mo families can handle this well.”

Qiao Mianmian paused for a while before saying, “I just feel that since we’re going to settle it, it’s best to settle it once and for all. Otherwise, if another whistle-blower appears in a few days, wouldn’t it be endless?”
