Chapter 339: She and Her Manager Are in Conflict?

Linda could guess what Qiao Anxin was thinking. But at this point, she didn’t care anymore.

Since she’d made up her mind, she was ready to face the consequences.

Given her reputation and capability, it wouldn’t be hard for her to find another company after leaving Star Splendor.

There was nothing to fear.

Moreover, she’d been wanting to leave Star Splendor for a while.

Ever since Su Ze took over, her authority had diminished significantly.

She used to have the final say regarding most artistes under Star Splendor.

But now, only Su Ze had the right to make the call. Su Ze was a rather proud man, and he never considered her input.

She’d had her grievances for a while already.

But she’d stayed for the time being, mainly because she did have some sense of belonging at Star Splendor after all these years.

“Qiao Anxin, if you wish to make it big in the entertainment circle, you definitely have to put in more effort and take your job seriously. Otherwise, even if Chairman Su supports you and gives you all the available opportunities, you’d still fall short.

“Also, your looks actually aren’t very suitable for the film and drama industry. I suggest you take on some variety shows and such. You might shine in this area more than you do in acting.”

Linda meant every word she said.

Qiao Anxin’s acting was decent for idol dramas riding on the actors’ and actresses’ popularity.

But for blockbusters or shows requiring more technique, her flaws would only be amplified.

She’d brought this up to Su Ze before, but he supported Qiao Anxin in acting because he said that that was her dream. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Back then, Linda went with it since Qiao Anxin’s acting wasn’t that terrible, and she had Su Ze’s backing.

She didn’t say anything anymore.

But now that she’d decided to resign, she might as well speak the truth.

Qiao Anxin was furious and addressed her by her full name. “Xie Linda, do you even want to keep your job? Do you know the consequences of saying all these? I just need to put in a word and I can get you out of Star Splendor immediately.”

Was this a threat?

Linda smiled and shrugged. “It doesn’t matter to me. Those were my honest sentiments. Consider them seriously.”

The elevator reached the first floor.

“Ding.” The doors opened. Linda walked out without taking a second look at Qiao Anxin’s now menacing expression.

Seeing how she just left without a moment of hesitation, Qiao Anxin’s jaw dropped.

“Xie Linda, don’t you regret this!” She yelled at the distant figure.

There were still a few audition candidates in the main lobby of the first floor.

With Qiao Anxin’s current level of popularity, most of them could recognize her.

Linda was also a renowned manager who had a wide network.

Seeing how one of them was still in the elevator while the other was already leaving the building, both of them with awful expressions, those standing around began speculating. “Is that Qiao Anxin? She and her manager are in conflict?”

“It seems like it. She’s really got the guts to make her manager this angry. Is she not worried about the consequences?”

“Consequences? I heard the Chairman of Star Splendor is her boyfriend, what does she have to be afraid of?”

“The Star Splendor Chairman is her boyfriend? Do you mean Young Master Su? But I heard that Young Master Su has a fianceé. Is Qiao Anxin the one?”
