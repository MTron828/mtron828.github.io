Chapter 411: Baby, Why Are You So Adorable

Qiao Mianmian corrected him while walking out. “Mr. Mo, you’re still pursuing me. Please watch the way you address me.”

He chuckled endearingly. “Mm. Thank you for correcting me, Miss Qiao. I’ll watch myself.”

Qiao Mianmian tried to keep herself from smiling as she closed her room door.

She headed downstairs quickly.

A sweet and fuzzy feeling crept into her heart as she thought about the man waiting for her downstairs. She was still talking to him over the phone as she made her way down. “Didn’t you say you’d take 20 minutes? Why are you here so soon?”

She looked at the time. It had only been 14 minutes. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“Mm... I wanted to see you sooner, so I dashed past a few red lights to get here early.”

Qiao Mianmian was stunned.

She immediately frowned when she heard this. “Mo Yesi, you beat the red light? You can’t do this, it’s wrong!

“How could you beat the red light, you know that’s dangerous. I’d rather wait for a few hours than have you do that.”

And it wasn’t just one, it was a few!

That was terrible!

She was a law-abiding citizen who wouldn’t approve of this.

Not even if he was her husband.

She was yelling into the phone, but when she was done, the man chuckled. The way he laughed sent electric shocks through her veins.

“What are you laughing about.” Qiao Mianmian was too mad to feel attracted by that. “It’s wrong, you can’t do this again in the future.”

“Mianmian.”

The man laughed for a while before he quietened. When he said her name, it was with a hint of affection.

Qiao Mianmian’s heart skipped a beat. “W-What...”

The man sounded increasingly flirtatious. “You’re worried about me?”

Qiao Mianmian placed a hand on her chest and took a deep breath to maintain her composure. “Don’t overthink it. I was worried about the pedestrians. They’re in danger when you do that.”

He was pursuing her now.

Qiao Mianmian didn’t want to admit that she was worried about him.

Otherwise, he’d be so smug.

“Is it?” Mo Yesi asked in his low voice. “You aren’t worried about me at all?”

“... What is there to worry about.”

Qiao Mianmian realized that they had gone off-tangent from what she meant to say earlier. She firmly reiterated, “Mo Yesi, don’t get cheeky with me. Did you hear what I said?”

“Mm, I did.”

The man laughed again, and at that moment, she felt as if he was right by her ear.

Qiao Mianmian tried to regulate her racing heart. She bit her lip and said, “That’s all that matters. Don’t do that again.”

“Baby, why are you so adorable.”

The man sounded very happy and loving. “You believe everything I say. Do you trust me that much?”

Qiao Mianmian was shocked. “... You were kidding?”
