Chapter 286: This Was a Strange Cause for Jealousy

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

He was so busy, he probably didn’t have time to be home much.

“He’s your Big Brother too.” Mo Yesi corrected her.

“Uh, so Big Brother is rarely at home?”

Mo Yesi looked at her. “You seem to be very concerned about Big Brother?”

He sounded calm and usual.

But for Qiao Mianmian, who already knew him well, she could sense some jealousy.

She didn’t know what to say.

Was he jealous of his brother? ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

She was just asking casually.

She’d never even met Mo Shixiu.

This was a strange cause for jealousy.

“... Nah, I’m just casually asking. You don’t have to answer me.”

Mo Yesi eyed her for a while and smiled before saying, “Big Brother is very busy. It’d be good if he could even spend one or two days at home each month. If you wish to see him, I’ll let him know. He could make time to come back.”

Qiao Mianmian dared not ask for anything in front of Mo Yesi.

He was already getting jealous when she asked casual questions.

If she asked to meet Mo Shixiu now, he’d probably lose it.

“Uh, it’s fine. Since Big Brother is busy, we shouldn’t bother him at work. I don’t particularly want to see him.”

She felt bad to put it that way, and so quickly added, “What I mean is that I can meet when he has the time, he doesn’t have to specially make time for it.”

He was the Minister of the Military Department.

It wouldn’t be nice to get him back just to meet a common person.

Even if Mo Shixiu was willing to do that, she wasn’t ready to accept such special treatment.

Moreover, she did think she might be afraid of Mo Shixiu when she saw him.

He looked so serious on television, he was definitely even more intimidating upfront.

“Wenpei, look at this young couple, it’s really so nice to be newlyweds. They can’t stop whispering to each other, I wonder what it’s about.” Old Madam smiled as she watched the two of them interact.

To her, nothing was better than seeing the young ones settle down in marriage and being loving with their partners.

Of course, things would be even more complete for the family if they could bear her some great-grandchildren.

All her wishes would be fulfilled then.

Madam Mo smiled insincerely. “Y-You’re right.”

She was unhappy about it, but it wasn’t a wise move to show it.

Old Madam was very satisfied with Qiao Mianmian as a granddaughter-in-law now.

If she displayed any unhappiness now or said anything that wasn’t in her favor, she’d be pitting herself against Old Madam.

Although she was the mother-in-law, Old Madam had the final say in the Mo family.

There wasn’t much she could say in her position.

“Grandma, I was telling Mianmian that you really like her.” Mo Yesi came over with Qiao Mianmian and the housemaid immediately pulled the chairs for them.

“Is it?” Old Madam was smiling.

“Mm, Mianmian’s happy to hear that.”

At the table, Mo Yesi glanced at the seat beside Old Madam and said to Qiao Mianmian, “Go ahead and sit beside Grandma. I used to be the only person who received such treatment, but now there’s you.”
