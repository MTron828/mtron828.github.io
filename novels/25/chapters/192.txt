Her heart was pumping wildly.

“Call me Hubby, mm?” He coaxed and lured her.

Qiao Mianmian could actually feel the depths of her heart shuddering.

This man before her was incredibly handsome, his voice incredibly captivating, and his aura... incredibly charming.

Qiao Mianmian felt herself going dizzy.

Her face was burning up.

“M-Mo Yesi...”

Call him Hubby?

Ahhh.

She was too embarrassed.

Although he already was her husband on paper.

She found it a little mushy and awkward to address him this way.

She felt like... she wasn’t up for it.

“Mm. Baby, I’m here.” The man leaned in closer, his voice deeper than before.

Qiao Mianmian’s heart could barely deal with it.

She swallowed her saliva. “I... I can’t bring myself to say it.”

She really couldn’t. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

It felt too mushy.

“You haven’t tried, how would you know.”

There was no response.

“Call me twice and you’ll get used to it. Come on, try it.”

Qiao Mianmian was about to tear up. “I-I really can’t. Can you give me some time?”

Mo Yesi was a little disappointed that she was about to tear up from the pressure. But he didn’t push her further. “Alright, I’ll give you some time. But if I agree to it, can you accede to a small request of mine too?”

“What?” Qiao Mianmian heaved a sigh of relief and looked up at him curiously.

Mo Yesi smiled. “If you don’t call me Hubby, then call me Dear.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

“Otherwise, call me Hubby. Your choice.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

Both sounded equally bad!

But in comparison, it seemed like “Dear” sounded slightly better. It was easier to make herself say it.

“A-Alright.” She took a deep breath and tried to suppress her embarrassment as she said quietly, “Dear...”

Her voice was so soft and tender.

Mo Yesi suddenly felt a rush in his veins.

His eyes darkened. “Baby, call me once more. Louder.”

“Dear... Uh...”

He kissed Qiao Mianmian’s lips. It was passionate, burning...

He did it with depth and force.

Soon, all the air was taken from her. She felt the oxygen in her lungs deplete slowly.

Just as Qiao Mianmian was about to pass out from lack of oxygen, Mo Yesi finally let her go.

“Baby.”

The man’s voice was hoarse and filled with thickened desire. He cupped her face in his hands. “Remember our one-week deal? Are you ready?”

Qiao Mianmian, still recovering from the kiss, got another shock.

The one-week deal?

What one-week deal?

The man’s sexy voice rang out by her ear, “Today’s the deadline. Don’t tell me you still aren’t ready.”

This time, he wasn’t planning on letting her off, whether she was ready or not.

When Qiao Mianmian finally recalled it, her eyes widened and her body stiffened.

I-It was so soon?
