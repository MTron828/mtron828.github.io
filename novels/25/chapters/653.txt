Chapter 655: It’s Good to Be a Relative

She wanted to live more comfortably.

She wasn’t living in the presidential suite, anyway.

Not many people would notice it.

“Wow, we can even see the sea from here. That’s amazing.” Nana walked into the room and placed her luggage properly before looking around.

She threw herself onto the huge, soft bed and hugged the pillow. “This bed is so good and soft. This is great, we can sleep well for the next few months. The production crew is so generous, I thought we were living in an ordinary room.”

Qiao Mianmian pursed her lips and kept quiet.

If it wasn’t for Bai Yusheng, she would be living in a normal room.

At a time like this, she felt that it was good to be a person with connections.

“Sister Mianmian, should we pack up or eat first?”

Nana rolled around for a while on the bed and then slowly sat up.

Qiao Mianmian was about to answer when her WeChat rang.

She opened it and saw that it was a message from Mo Yesi: [Have you reached your place of residence? Have you eaten? Remember to eat, don’t go hungry.]

She stared at it for a while and couldn’t help but smile. Her heart was filled with sweetness.

It felt so good to be remembered.

She thought for a while and quickly replied: [I just arrived at the hotel room and packed my luggage. I’m going out for dinner. What about you?]

Mo Yesi replied instantly: [I’m going to eat too. How’s the environment? Are you satisfied?]

Qiao Mianmian: [I’m very satisfied. The commercial suite that the crew arranged for us is near the sea. We can see the sea view anytime. Did you get Yan Shaoqing to arrange this?]

Mo Yesi: [Mm, you have to stay in a better place when you’re out. If it wasn’t for the fact that it might affect you too much, I would’ve arranged a presidential suite for you.]

Qiao Mianmian: [No, this is good enough.]

Mo Yesi: [It’s almost 1 pm, let’s go eat.]

Qiao Mianmian: [Alright. I’ll go, then. Oh right, what are you having for lunch?]

Mo Yesi: [I don’t know yet. What are you eating?]

Qiao Mianmian thought for a while and replied: [I don’t know, I’ll take a look downstairs.]

Mo Yesi: [Alright, then. Take a picture of what you’re eating before we eat.]

Qiao Mianmian: [Alright. Then, take a picture for me too. I want to see what you’re eating.]

Mo Yesi: [Alright.]

Downstairs.

Qiao Mianmian and Nana searched the surroundings and found a river snail store.

Both of them liked snail noodles, so they decided to have it for lunch.

The moment she entered the store, she smelled something unpleasant.

Nana took a deep breath and looked intoxicated. “I haven’t had river snails for a long time. I’m craving for them just by smelling them. In a while, I’ll get Boss to add more sour bamboo shoots for me. I love eating river snails.”

They found a seat and sat down.

Then, they each ordered a family meal.

There were a lot of side dishes in the family meal.

They loved it.

After a while, the employee came out with two huge bowls. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

After placing it on the table, Nana couldn’t wait any longer. She picked up a piece of noodles with her chopsticks and sighed in satisfaction. “This is the taste, it’s so good!”

Qiao Mianmian thought about her promise to Mo Yesi and sent him a photo.

A few seconds later, he replied: [What’s this?]
