Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Even the members of the opposing team commented, “What the hell, the person controlling Li Bai is really good.”

Even though he was praised, he remained composed and destroyed the enemy’s headquarters.

Qiao Mianmian was still shocked until the victory logo was shown.

After he finished the game, he opened up his match statistics and handed the phone over to Qiao Mianmian. He then said, “I’ve won. I’ve done what I promised you already. Isn’t it time that you keep your end of the bargain?”

Qiao Mianmian took over the cell phone while still in shock.

She took a look at the statistics for Li Bai. “5 kills, 3 deaths, 5 assists.”

“How, how, how did you do it?” She stared at her phone for a while before raising her head and exclaiming.

He was so trashy at the start.

However, he managed to get a penta kill just after a few minutes!

Was he pretending to be trashy at the game since the beginning?

Mo Yesi was satisfied with her reaction.

She finally realized the capable side of him.

He then explained nonchalantly, “It’s possible once you get used to the character. It’s quite simple, actually.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

“Is this really your first time playing this game?”

She was suspicious.

How could someone be so good the first time he played a game?

Unless he was a genius!

“Yes,” Mo Yesi answered nonchalantly. “It’s my first time playing. Why?”

Qiao Mianmian stared at him for a while before believing him.

She felt that Mo Yesi didn’t need to lie to her. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

He was so preoccupied with work and the social gatherings after work that he couldn’t have the time to game.

His time was precious, and he would never have wasted it on games.

It felt as though no matter how much effort you put in, you would be bested by someone with talent.

She played the game for more than two years already.

And yet, a noob picking up the game for the first time performed better than her.

Who could she complain to?

She felt demoralized.

“Baby, let’s get back on track.” Mo Yesi reached out and pulled Qiao Mianmian into his arms. He then lifted her chin and said, “I want to hear you call me Older Brother Yesi.”

Qiao Mianmian blushed.

She agreed to it without much thought as she felt that it was impossible for him.

But he did it.

She felt that it was mushy to address someone as Older Brother.

How could Mo Yesi ask such a thing?

He liked it when people addressed him as an older brother?

“Baby?” Mo Yesi’s asked smilingly with his low raspy voice. “Are you trying to back out of our agreement?”

“No.” Qiao Mianmian suppressed her shame as she touched her face. She took a deep breath, closed her eyes, and yelled, “Older Brother... Ye... Yesi...”

Her voice was sweet.

Because of her shyness, her yell was barely audible.

After she yelled, she blushed even more and felt as though her face was on fire.

It sounded so cute, like a kitten meowing.

She didn’t realize how alluring her voice was.

But when Mo Yesi heard it, he tensed up, and you could see the lust in his eyes.

He tightened his hold on her chin and said, “Baby, say it one more time.”
