Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Mo Yesi didn’t like playing games, but that didn’t mean he couldn’t.

It also didn’t mean he didn’t play well.

He used to play a client-side game when he was a student. It was similar to the mobile game he just played.

But the client-side game was much harder.

When he played Duan You, he won through the rankings.

It wasn’t difficult to play such a simple game.

Previously, when Qiao Mianmian said that she wanted to play games, he had practiced a few times in private.

“H-How did you do it?” Qiao Mianmian was still in disbelief, especially after seeing his amazing moves. “Didn’t you say that you’ve never played this game before?”

She was the one who helped him download the game app on his cell phone.

“Mm, I’ve never played before.” Mo Yesi smiled and said casually, “I played a few times after that. It was pretty simple.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

He’d only played a few times, but he could already play so well.

So, it was easier for people with high IQ to do anything than ordinary people? Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

She’d played this game for a long time, but she was still a rookie.

“I won’t play games for now. Didn’t you say you were going to eat?” Mo Yesi rubbed his wife’s head again. “Have you thought about what to eat?”

Qiao Mianmian was still in shock.

Mo Yesi smiled. “Since you haven’t thought about it, I’ll take you to eat something nice? Let’s go, I know a good place. I’ll take you there now.”

...

Qiao Mianmian was led out of the study by Mo Yesi.

They bumped into Gong Zeli walking towards them.

Gong Zeli narrowed his eyes when he saw their interlocked fingers. He then said nonchalantly, “Are you going out?”

Qiao Mianmian could feel that Mo Yesi’s aura turned colder when Gong Zeli appeared.

Gong Zeli’s expression was a little unnatural.

The atmosphere between them was strange.

But Qiao Mianmian didn’t know why.

“Mm.” Mo Yesi replied calmly, “I’ll take your sister-in-law out for dinner.”

Gong Zeli pursed his lips and clenched his fists.

Mo Yesi looked at him again. “So, you don’t have to prepare dinner tonight. Your sister-in-law won’t be staying here tonight.”

With that, he turned to Qiao Mianmian and whispered, “Let’s go.”

Qiao Mianmian looked at Gong Zeli and then at the man beside her.

She wasn’t overthinking.

Mo Yesi and Gong Zeli were really weird.

“Mm.” Although she was puzzled, she didn’t ask further. She nodded and left with Mo Yesi.

The two of them walked out of the white building.

Gong Zeli stood rooted to the ground as he watched them leave.

He clenched his teeth as his blood surged. It was as if something was blocking his body.

He knew that Mo Yesi did that on purpose.

Constantly reminding him that Qiao Mianmian was his sister-in-law.

Hence, he couldn’t have any improper thoughts.

He knew. He knew everything.

“Young Master.”

At this moment, a housemaid walked over. She glanced at him and asked cautiously, “Should we get the kitchen to prepare dinner?”

Gong Zeli didn’t reply. He stood there for another 10 seconds before turning around and leaving.
