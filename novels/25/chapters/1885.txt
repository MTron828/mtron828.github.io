Qiao Mianmian looked at the man and then at Zhao Yuan. “Brother Zhao, I’d like to take two hours off, is that okay?”

“Of course you can, of course you can.” Zhao Yuan was extremely easy to talk to. “You can take as long as you want. Since Mr. Mo is here to see you, you should accompany him.”

Mo Yesi invested 500 million yuan and became this episode’s biggest investor.

Furthermore, Zhao Yuan had just found out Mo Yesi’s true identity.

He was so shocked to see Mo Yesi in person that he didn’t even dare to breathe.

Someone had previously said that Qiao Mianmian had used her connections to participate in this show.

Zhao Yuan had thought so, too.

But now, he no longer had such thoughts.

With Mo Yesi’s status, he could get Qiao Mianmian on any show she wanted.

No matter how good the resources were, they could easily obtain them.

Although “The Meaning of Traveling” was a variety show with excellent ratings and many artistes wanted to appear on it, it was not so popular that Mo Yesi’s connections were needed.

With Mo Yesi’s connections, Qiao Mianmian could be the female lead of a top-notch IP franchise movie.

When it came to relationships, only people like Song Ke would use connections.

Speaking of which, Qiao Mianmian was really good at hiding.

Her boyfriend was such an awesome existence. She was totally the kind of person who could do whatever she wanted. However, in the few days that she had been with the production team, not only did she not seem pretentious at all, she was also very hardworking.

Compared to Song Ke and Little Xiao, she was simply much better.

Zhao Yuan had tasted Qiao Mianmian’s cooking before. She was definitely one of the best girls he knew.

Who would have thought that her boyfriend would be Mo Yesi?

What kind of concept was this?

It was just a group of contestants participating in a PK advancement match. While others were still worrying about how to clear the PK matches, she directly obtained the person who would advance to the last round. Furthermore, that person was internally decided to be the champion.

Other people participated in this program because they hoped to use this program to increase their popularity.

But to Qiao Mianmian, she could choose whether she wanted to participate or not.

After all, any resource was easy for her to obtain. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“That’s right, you should spend more time with Mr. Mo,” the man next to Zhao Yuan said. “Two hours might not be enough. How about this, you don’t have to come back today. Get a day off.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

Why did she find it so easy to apply for leave?

In the previous episode, some people also wanted to apply for leave. Zhao Yuan and the others were not so easy to talk to.

She silently looked at the man beside her. After looking at him for a while, she couldn’t help but feel that being rich and powerful was really good.

It could make anyone easy to talk to.

Mo Yesi took it for granted.

After all, this was his daily treatment. He was used to being treated like this.

“Mm, then let’s have a day off. Let’s go.” Mo Yesi held her hand and led her out.

“Mr. Mo, take care. Be careful of the steps.”

Behind them, Zhao Yuan and the man beside him sent them to the door. They stood at the door and watched them leave respectfully.
