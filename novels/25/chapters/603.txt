Chapter 604: I Didn’t Know Young Master Gong Was Your Friend

He was so engrossed in his wife during office hours.

Wei Zheng felt like this sort of man, who’d gone their whole lives being disinterested in women, had a much stronger and scarier reaction after touching women than normal men did.

Chairman Mo was the best example.

Men like this were the most clingy once they got into a relationship.

“Ahem, Chairman Mo, Young Madam.” Wei Zheng didn’t want to look directly at them.

He was a single man witnessing such an intimate scene.

Mo Yesi saw how awkward he looked and felt like kicking him out of the office.

But considering that this lad was still rather useful and reliable, he resisted it.

“Check something out.” He glanced at the woman on his lap and decided to find out who it was that started this mess online. He said seriously, “Investigate the account that first made the post on Weibo.

“Also, inform the Public Relations Department to remove all that nonsense in the next hour. If I still see any news that upsets me, you can tell them to prepare their resignation letters.”

Wei Zheng replied, “... Yes, Chairman Mo.”

“Alright, get on to it.” Mo Yesi waved him away.

Wei Zheng knew that Chairman Mo despised his presence.

He was an extra in the office that Chairman Mo couldn’t tolerate, as long as Young Madam was around. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

He left, slightly upset but very self-aware.

Once he left.

Qiao Mianmian looked at Mo Yesi and asked, “You’re going to help me find out who did this to me?”

“Of course.”

Mo Yesi looked down at her and said a little coldly, “Someone is spreading rumors about my wife, am I supposed to sit back and just watch? I can’t possibly let you think that you married a useless husband.

“Baby, I’ve said it before, you’re Mrs. Mo now. You’ve got more power than you can imagine. You’re entitled to all the resources in the Mo family. And getting your husband to help you to do things is part of your authority.

“You can get me to help you settle anything.

“Just one word from you and I’ll do it.”

The man ruffled her hair, his eyes full of affection.

Just a word from her, and he was willing to do anything.

She had no idea how much she meant to him.

At this moment, Qiao Mianmian was truly touched.

She felt all warm and fuzzy inside. But just as she was about to say something, her cell phone rang.

It was Linda calling.

“Let me take this call.” Qiao Mianmian laid on Mo Yesi’s chest and received the call.

“Hello, Sister Xie.”

“Mianmian, the eyewitness you saw just now was Young Master Gong?” Linda sounded shocked.

Qiao Mianmian was shocked to hear that too. “How did you know that, Sister Xie?”

She remembered that she didn’t name him.

“You haven’t heard?” Linda asked in return. “Young Master Gong reposted the original post and cleared your name. Mianmian, I didn’t know Young Master Gong was your friend. Why didn’t you tell me?

“Having such an impressive friend to clear your name is amazing. A lot of the verified accounts saw his post and took their original reposts down, for fear of offending him. In this case, the company won’t have to get Public Relations to settle this for you anymore.”
