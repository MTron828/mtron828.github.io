Chapter 1794: She Can Get Whatever Others Want

Shen Fei, Zhan Bo, and the rest came alone.

Qiao Anxin’s enthusiasm stunned Shen Fei for a while. She then looked at her and said, “Is that so? Of course, it’s fine to take a picture. But you’ve just arrived, you should unpack your luggage first.

“Oh right, we’re going to have dinner in town later. Are you guys going? If you are, tidy up and come along.”

Qiao Anxin wouldn’t let go of the opportunity to get close to Shen Fei.

She immediately nodded and said, “Yes, of course. Sister Fei, wait for me, I’ll unpack right away.” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Shen Fei nodded. “Mm, go on.”

Qiao Anxin was about to leave happily when she saw Qiao Mianmian standing not too far behind Shen Fei.

Her smile froze.

Her expression froze.

Then, a trace of coldness and hatred flashed past her eyes.

Qiao Mianmian smiled and walked towards Shen Fei. “Sister Shen, I’m done. I want to take a look around first. I’ll be back soon.”

“How about this? Anxin and Mufei just arrived. They might need some time to unpack their luggage, so let’s set off in an hour.”

Shen Fei asked, “Anxin, Mufei, can you finish unpacking in an hour?”

Su Mufei was a handsome boy who seemed to have just turned 18. He was also a student.

He looked like a good boy. He replied to her obediently, “Sure, Sister Fei.”

“Alright, then quickly find Zhao Yuan and get him to arrange a room for you. Mianmian, I’ll call you before we leave. Oh right, what’s your cell phone number and WeChat? I’ll add you.”

Seeing Shen Fei take out her cell phone and ask Qiao Mianmian for her WeChat and cell phone number, Qiao Anxin was shocked and jealous. She looked at Qiao Mianmian even more unkindly.

Everyone knew that Shen Fei looked amiable on the surface.

But in fact, she wasn’t someone who would casually make friends.

Not many people could enter Shen Fei’s circle of friends.

That she took the initiative to ask Qiao Mianmian for her contact details... Just thinking about it made Qiao Anxin jealous.

Who didn’t want to be friends with Shen Fei?

Why was Qiao Mianmian so lucky about everything?

It was as if God was secretly helping her.

She could easily get what others wanted.

Qiao Anxin really hated such a person. And this person was Qiao Mianmian, this little slut.

Qiao Anxin saw Shen Fei take out her cell phone and wanted to seize the opportunity. She said shamelessly, “Sister Fei, I’ll add your WeChat and cell phone number too. This way, we can contact each other in the future.”

Taking the opportunity that Shen Fei was stunned, Qiao Anxin took out her cell phone and said affectionately, “Sister Fei, what’s your WeChat QR code? Let me scan it.”

Shen Fei couldn’t reject her since she already said so. Even though she wasn’t willing, she still sent Qiao Anxin a WeChat message.

Qiao Anxin immediately added her.

“Sister Fei, I’ll go unpack my luggage first. See you later.”

Qiao Anxin didn’t even greet Qiao Mianmian. She just glanced at her coldly and turned around to get her assistant to bring her luggage to Zhao Yuan.
