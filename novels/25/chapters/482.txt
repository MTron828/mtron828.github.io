Chapter 483: Why Was His Performance So Bad Today?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

And they did it at least six to seven times a night.

Qiao Mianmian didn’t have experience in this area. The only man she’d had experience with was Mo Yesi. She didn’t even remember that mess of a night when she had her first time.

So, she actually had nobody to compare him with.

She had no idea whether Mo Yesi was considered fast.

After all, the novels were always exaggerating. It wasn’t a good reference.

Just as Qiao Mianmian was wondering whether Mo Yesi was too quick at it, the man got stunned too.

Qiao Mianmian couldn’t see him, but there was a look of disbelief on his face.

He couldn’t believe he ended so quickly.

He had a good rest last night, so lack of sleep wasn’t a good reason.

Also, he wasn’t especially stressed out recently.

He didn’t feel unwell or restless.

And this wasn’t his first time with Qiao Mianmian, either.

No matter how he looked at it, he shouldn’t have been so quick to finish it.

And being “quick” was a terrible blow to men.

Especially men like Mo Yesi.

He was good in every way, practically a gift from heaven, a near-perfect man.

But if he wasn’t good at the one important thing to a man, then he just wasn’t good enough.

He’d planned to do well today.

He really wanted to give Qiao Mianmian an enjoyable experience.

But he hadn’t expected... that he would end so soon.

He didn’t know how to react to it.

He dared not even look at Qiao Mianmian’s expression.

Would she feel that... he wasn’t good in that area? Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Would she despise him for it?

After all, if a man couldn’t satisfy his wife in that way, was he truly a man?

Mo Yesi was in agony.

He did so well the other night, why was his performance so bad today?

And it was when Qiao Mianmian was conscious.

He showed her that he couldn’t do it when she was conscious!

The man lay beside her in silence for a little too long.

So long that Qiao Mianmian found it strange.

She turned to look at him, a little confused. She then asked cautiously, “So... you’re done? Could you get up for a while so I can take a shower?”

She had sweated a lot and was uncomfortable with it.

Qiao Mianmian felt that she was being cautious enough and taking care of his emotions well enough too.

After all, she knew that this might hurt a man’s dignity. So, she didn’t even mention the word “quick” or “fast” to him.

But the moment she said it, Mo Yesi stiffened.

A few moments later, he got off the bed expressionlessly.

Nothing was covering him.

Qiao Mianmian took just a glance and quickly covered her eyes in embarrassment.

But she could sense that Mo Yesi’s eyes were on her.

“Mm, you can go shower. Do you need me to carry you to the bathroom? We can...” The man’s voice was hoarse.

“N-No need.” Qiao Mianmian dared not have him carry her. She was afraid that he’d get into the mood again and put her through another round of torment.
