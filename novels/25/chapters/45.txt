Chapter 46: In Your Eyes, Am I Still Just an Outsider?

Qiao Mianmian immediately blushed. After standing firmly, she hurriedly reached out and pushed him away.

She had been discovered...

It was so embarrassing!

Biting the corner of her lips, she was so anxious that she didn’t dare to look at him. She blushed and said, “Just now... thank you.”

“Thank you?” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Mo Yesi stopped.

The man turned around and his tall, slender figure shone down. His large shadow covered the petite figure in front of him.

He looked down at her, squinting his two good-looking eyes. “Do you like to say thank you to me so much? In your eyes, am I still an outsider?”

Qiao Mianmian blinked. “I...”

Just after saying a word, the man reached out and pulled her into his arms again.

His sturdy arm was tightly tied around her waist.

His other hand held her small jaw and he raised it slightly, forcing her to stare at him.

Staring into his bottomless dark eyes, Qiao Mianmian’s eyes showed a little panic. “Mo Yesi...”

Mo Yesi squinted for a moment, his eyes falling on her pale pink sakura lips and darkening a little.

When he spoke, his voice was low. “Qiao Mianmian, I’m your husband, you must get used to me as soon as possible. I will give you a week to adapt. One week later, if you still cannot adapt, I will deal with our relationship in my own way.”

After he said this, his breath approached and under Qiao Mianmian’s astonished eyes, he bowed his head and kissed her lips.

A contented sigh came from his throat and passed between his lips and his teeth.

Her lips were as sweet as he remembered.

Once tasted, it became addictive.

Kissed by him, Qiao Mianmian’s body froze and her brain had a few seconds of blank space.

She opened her eyes wide and looked at the handsome face in front of her. She felt dizzy for a few seconds.

Her heart beat incredibly fast and her entire chest shook as if her heart would pop out of her throat in the next second.

“Close your eyes while kissing.” The man’s warm, dry palms covered her eyes.

Qiao Mianmian was kissed until her body was soft and her cheeks were red. Mo Yesi slowly ended the kiss when she felt that she was about to pass out due to hypoxia.

He bit her in the corner of her lips reluctantly before releasing her.

Qiao Mianmian softly panted in his arms.

Mo Yesi looked down at her, his eyes glowing. He said in an incredibly low and husky voice, “Don’t you know how to breathe while kissing? Didn’t your ex-fiancé teach you?”

Her inexperience was beyond his expectation.

Be it the inexperience of that night, or of now, he was surprised.

He remembered that night had been her first time.

After being with Su Ze for so many years, how could she still be so inexperienced in these kinds of things?

He already felt tortured trying to keep himself from touching her, so he couldn’t believe that Su Ze had restrained himself so well.
