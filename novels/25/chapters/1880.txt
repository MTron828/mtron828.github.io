Chapter 1881: Your Solicitude Is Wasted

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

She had taken him down.

In this world, no man was truly determined. How could there be a cat that did not cheat?

Mo Yesi was just a little difficult.

It would just take a little longer. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

She wouldn’t give up just like that.

If she could snatch Su Ze from Qiao Mianmian, she could also snatch Mo Yesi from her.

Qiao Anxin raised her head and looked at the face that moved her. She took a deep breath and forced a smile. “Mr. Mo, you must be tired from rushing here. Since you don’t want to go out, you should rest well.

“Call me if you need anything. I’ll be right there.”

Mo Yesi looked at her coldly and slammed the door shut.

Qiao Anxin almost got snubbed.

The moment the door closed, her face darkened.

“Are you trying to express your goodwill but got rejected?” A sarcastic voice came from behind. Song Ke saw the scene of Qiao Anxin serving tea to Mo Yesi and couldn’t help but say sarcastically, “It looks like you’re really not familiar with Qiao Mianmian’s boyfriend. His attitude towards you is worse than a stranger’s.”

Song Ke was interested in Mo Yesi.

Seeing Qiao Anxin fawning over him just now made her uncomfortable.

Qiao Anxin fumed. She turned around and saw Song Ke’s gloating expression. “This has nothing to do with you.”

“Yes, it has nothing to do with me.” Song Ke curled her lips, but her eyes were filled with mockery. “I just find it funny. Some people don’t even know how to hide their thoughts. It’s obvious at a glance. There are so many men in this world. It’s not very good to target your sister’s man. Even a rabbit doesn’t eat the grass by its nest.”

Qiao Anxin flew into a rage. “Song Ke, don’t talk nonsense.”

“You know very well whether it’s nonsense or not.” Song Ke curled her lips in disdain and said with a smile, “I’m not the only one who can tell. Everyone saw it, right? You were so eager to curry favor just now. We’re not blind, we can’t see anything.

“However, your efforts were wasted. I don’t think he’s interested in you at all.”

“Song Ke!” Qiao Anxin and Song Ke were on the same side. After all, they didn’t like Qiao Mianmian.

But now, for a man, the two of them had turned against each other.

“Song Ke, if you’re in the mood to worry about these things, you might as well focus on the matter of you spreading rumors about Qiao Mianmian. When the time comes, some people will be finished. I don’t know what the netizens will think of you, but I know that Qiao Mianmian won’t let you off easily.

“With one word from her, you can forget about continuing in the entertainment industry.

“Just wait to be banned. I’ll see if you’re still in the mood to laugh then.”

At this point, Qiao Anxin seemed to have seen Song Ke’s terrible state when she was banned. She smiled, feeling much better.

Song Ke’s smile froze.

“Qiao Anxin, what nonsense are you spouting?” There was a hint of panic in her eyes. “What does Qiao Mianmian’s matter have to do with me? Don’t spout nonsense.”
