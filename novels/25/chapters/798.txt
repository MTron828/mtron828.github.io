Chapter 799: He Couldn’t Not See Her

“In principle, it’s like this.” Wei Zheng smiled politely. “Miss Shen, you can give Chairman Mo a call before you come. Chairman Mo will inform me, and I’ll go to the front desk to say hi. Miss Shen can go up to Chairman Mo directly.”

Shen Rou took a deep breath and smiled. “Do I have to make an appointment with him now?”

“How about this, I’ll call Chairman Mo?” Wei Zheng looked at her angry expression and felt that she was pitiful.

Actually, if Chairman Mo wasn’t with Young Madam, he felt that Shen Rou was a good choice.

The Shen and Mo families were well-matched, and Shen Rou had known Chairman Mo for so many years.

Moreover, she was the only girl by Chairman Mo’s side ever.

If Young Madam hadn’t appeared, Chairman Mo’s final marriage partner would probably be Shen Rou.

She’d been single for over 20 years, but in the end, she’d watched the man she liked marry another woman.

How pitiful.

But the smarter ones should have kept their distance after that.

She shouldn’t have any unrealistic thoughts.

Shen Rou was supposed to be a smart woman.

But for some reason, she became irrational when it came to relationships.

What she was doing now was slowly diminishing the friendship between Chairman Mo and her.

Especially when she targeted Young Madam.

Chairman Mo doted on Young Madam so much, he probably couldn’t tolerate her.

If she stopped now, it wouldn’t be too late.

If this continued, she might end up as a stranger with Chairman Mo.

Wei Zheng took out his cell phone and called Mo Yesi.

When the call got through, he said respectfully, “Chairman Mo, I met Miss Shen in the lobby. She said she has something to discuss with you. Do you want to meet her?”

Wei Zheng thought that Mo Yesi would reject it.

The last time, Chairman Mo told him not to let anyone go up.

Wasn’t he referring to Shen Rou?

Unexpectedly, he heard Mo Yesi said to let Shen Rou go up.

Wei Zheng was shocked and asked again, “Let Miss Shen go up?”

After receiving another affirmation, he was a little confused.

But he knew that Chairman Mo’s decision couldn’t be wrong.

He must have his reasons for letting Shen Rou go up.

Wei Zheng kept his cell phone and walked towards Shen Rou. He smiled and said, “Miss Shen, come up with me. Chairman Mo is almost done with his meeting. You can see him then.” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Shen Rou smiled when she heard that.

She knew that she had a different place in Mo Yesi.

He couldn’t possibly not see her.

She tightened her grip on the thermos and smiled at him. “Alright, we can wait for him to come out. We can have some soup that I brewed for him.”

“Uh...” Wei Zheng looked down and saw Shen Rou holding a thermos.

He kept quiet for a few seconds before asking, “Miss Shen made soup for Chairman Mo?”

“Mm.” Shen Rou smiled and said, “I made this myself. I’ve been cooking for hours. The pheasant stewed with ginseng is the best. Ah Si must be tired after such a long meeting. It’s the best soup for him.”
