Chapter 470: What Play Is Fourth Bro Acting In?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Gong Zeli didn’t seem to share that sentiment. He shook Yan Shaoqing off and looked straight at Qiao Mianmian. “You really don’t use any perfume? Then, what about the fragrance on you?”

He so badly wanted to know the answer.

Qiao Mianmian found it a little strange now. She furrowed her brows and said, “I’ve already answered you.”

“Then, why do you have a fragrance?”

Yan Shaoqing said, “Fourth Bro, are you out of your mind? What are you doing?”

Gong Zeli was very stubborn. “You just have to tell me how you got that scent. If it’s not perfume, what is it?”

Qiao Mianmian was a little angered now, and she responded coldly, “Mr. Gong, this is very disrespectful.”

“I know, but I really need to know the answer. Your answer is very important to me. Miss Qiao, take this as a favor. Please, can you tell me?”

He sounded so polite, Qiao Mianmian could barely believe that it was Gong Zeli speaking to her.

He looked so lost and confused, even helpless.

Qiao Mianmian looked at his handsome face and felt like she disliked him a little less now.

She had to admit that Gong Zeli was pretty good-looking under usual circumstances.

She could tell that this was very important to him.

Otherwise, he wouldn’t be talking to her so nicely, given his dislike for her.

And honestly, she didn’t hate him whatsoever. She just didn’t have a very positive feeling towards him.

She felt like being a nice person since he was being civil. “Perhaps, it’s my shampoo?”

Mo Yesi also told her that she smelt good and asked her what perfume she used.

But she couldn’t detect it on herself.

She thought about it and guessed that it could be the residual fragrance of her shampoo. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Shampoo?” Gong Zeli blinked. “What brand is that?”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

“And that shampoo, is it still in production?”

There was no response.

Gong Zeli asked these strange questions and then left.

Yan Shaoqing stood at the door and watched him leave. He was puzzled.

When he was finally out of sight, he couldn’t keep it in any longer. “Damn, what play is Fourth Bro acting in?”

He had no idea, and Qiao Mianmian was all the more confused about it.

“Sis-in-law, you’re not keeping a secret with Fourth Bro that we don’t know about, right?” Yan Shaoqing had so many questions. He eyed Qiao Mianmian, a little skeptical.

Qiao Mianmian said, “... Does it seem like he and I would have a secret?”

Yan Shaoqing replied, “... No.”

“Young Master Yan, let’s not talk about Mr. Gong for now. We’ve got something more interesting to talk about.” Qiao Mianmian bent over and picked up the bouquet of red roses on the table. She smiled sweetly and added, “... Like this bouquet of roses?”

Yan Shaoqing’s expression stiffened immediately.

When he saw Qiao Mianmian sitting in the private room, he already knew what went on.

At that point, he was so frustrated.

And full of regret.

He thought that he’d really met his soulmate, but as it turned out...

He tried to force a smile. “It’s a misunderstanding, Sis-in-law, it really is. My flowers here...”
