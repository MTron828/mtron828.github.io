Chapter 1686: If You Don’t Answer, It’s a Tacit Agreement

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Seeing how sly and cheeky she was, his heartbeat quickened.

She looked good when she smiled.

It felt warm and wonderful.

His heart raced when she smiled.

“Alright, you don’t have to answer. I already know.” Jiang Luoli couldn’t help but laugh when she saw how nervous the man was. “You must like me more and more, right? After all, I’m so beautiful and cute. It’s normal for you to fall for me.”

Mo Shixiu was speechless.

“If you don’t answer, it’s a tacit agreement.”

“...”

Mo Shixiu still didn’t say anything.

He felt that Jiang Luoli was indeed pretty and cute.

He couldn’t help but like her.

Initially, he wanted to date her out of responsibility.

But now, his desire to be with her had nothing to do with that.

“You’ve really fallen deeply in love with me.” Jiang Luoli touched her face. “I knew it. You can’t resist my charm.”

Mo Shixiu was speechless.

Everyone loved her.

Thankfully, she was thick-skinned enough to say it.

But he didn’t want so many people to like her.

It was enough that he liked her.

“Mo Shixiu, why aren’t you saying anything?” Jiang Luoli pouted unhappily and glared at him. “Do you think I’m overthinking, so you don’t want to talk to me? Do you not like me at all?”

Mo Shixiu quickly said, “No.”

“No? So you like me?”

“...”

“Say something? Do you like me or not?” Jiang Luoli asked.

It wasn’t easy to force a man like Mo Shixiu to say that he liked her.

She had been with him for a while.

He treated her very well and was willing to give her many things. It wasn’t too much to say that he doted on her.

But Jiang Luoli had never heard him say that he liked her.

Mo Shixiu was a little helpless. His face burned as he pursed his lips and said uncomfortably, “I do.”

Jiang Luoli felt sweet inside.

She wrapped her arms around his neck and quickly pecked him on the lips.

“Mm, I like you too.”

Mo Shixiu was stunned. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Jiang Luoli blinked innocently. “What? You don’t like it?”

“...No.”

“So, you like the way I treat you?”

“...Luoli.”

Mo Shixiu blushed. He didn’t know what to do with her.

Because she was his girlfriend.

It was normal for her to be intimate with him.

He couldn’t possibly keep a distance from his girlfriend.

But this was the first time he met a girl like Jiang Luoli.

This was the first time he was teased by a girl.

And it was his turn to tell her he liked her.

“Tell me.” Jiang Luoli giggled. “Do you like me or not?”

Mo Shixiu had no choice but to reply. “Mm.”
