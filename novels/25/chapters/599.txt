Chapter 600: You Don’t Seem Too Happy?

Qiao Mianmian understood where she was coming from. “Mm, go ahead, Sister Xie.”

“You and Su Ze... what do you think about it?” Linda asked only after thinking about it for a while.

Qiao Mianmian was taken aback. “Sister Xie, what do you mean?”

“You’re not reconciling with him, right?”

“... no, I won’t.”

“That’s good.” Linda hesitated before going on. “Mianmian, I know you and he have known each other for a long time. Perhaps, you’d still...”

“Sister Xie, you’re thinking too much.” Qiao Mianmian cut her off and said a little coldly, “I’m not that cheap yet.”

“... I’m sorry, I really thought too much. Mianmian, I just meant to say that Su Ze really is a scumbag. Do you know he was the one who caused Qiao Anxin’s miscarriage? It was Qiao Anxin’s fault for coming between you and him, but the moment Qiao Anxin had a miscarriage, he immediately went looking for you. This is absurd.

“He’s practically inhuman.

“He seems fine on the outside, but the things he does... truly terrible.

“But I guess Qiao Anxin deserved what she got too, perhaps this is her retribution. After all, she was the one who snatched someone else’s fiancé back then, and now she’s paying for it by being abandoned so cruelly.”

Qiao Mianmian was shocked. “What did you say, Qiao Anxin had a miscarriage?”

“Mm.” Linda went on. “Although I’ve left Star Splendor, I still keep in contact with some of them there. I heard that Qiao Anxin and Su Ze got into an argument, and then some people heard her screaming in his office.

“When they went in, they saw her lying on the floor and bleeding from between her legs.

“Su Ze carried her to the hospital, and the doctor said it was a miscarriage.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

This was shocking enough.

If what Linda had said was completely true, that Su Ze had really come to reconcile with her right after Qiao Anxin’s miscarriage... he really was another level of scum.

She didn’t know she could get even more disgusted by him, until now.

Qiao Mianmian thought about all the things he’d said earlier today and felt her stomach turn.

It was disgusting.

No wonder Su Ze came looking for her all of a sudden.

It was all because Qiao Anxin had already had a miscarriage.

At this moment, her aversion towards Su Ze reached a new high.

...

After chatting with Linda for over 10 minutes, Qiao Mianmian hung up and walked out of the lounge.

She saw that Wei Zheng was also in the office when she came out.

He seemed to be saying something to Mo Yesi.

Behind the black desk, the man’s handsome face was cold and serious.

Wei Zheng saw that Qiao Mianmian was around too and greeted her. “Young Madam.”

Qiao Mianmian nodded and then walked towards Mo Yesi.

He turned to look at her.

His expression seemed a little off, and he wasn’t looking at her in the same gentle way he usually did.

There was an eerie air around him.

Qiao Mianmian stopped in her tracks as she met his cold glance. She couldn’t help but feel a little apprehensive.

“What’s wrong?”

She went to him and looked down at his face. “You don’t seem too happy?”

Mo Yesi didn’t say a thing. He simply looked at her seriously for a while.

Qiao Mianmian felt oddly stressed out by his look and furrowed her brows a little uncomfortably. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

She was so used to his gentleness that this seemed a little odd.

He seemed... strange.

Mo Yesi did not respond to her. He simply turned to Wei Zheng and said, “You can leave first.”
