Chapter 1441: It Was All for Their Good

“I’ve already asked around about that Jiang girl. Do you know what her family is like?

“Even if her family situation was normal, I wouldn’t be so against it. But she was born in a family with gamblers, and she has a younger brother who was arrested several times for theft. How can I accept such a family?

“I’ve groomed such an outstanding son. Even if he doesn’t find someone of equal social status, he can’t find someone like this, right? You can’t let him find any woman just because Shixiu is willing to have a girlfriend.

“I’d rather Shixiu remain single than date someone like her.

“Anyway, I won’t agree to Shixiu dating that Jiang girl.” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“You don’t agree?” The Old Madam sneered. “Shangguan Wenpei, do you think your two sons will listen to you? If you don’t agree, they’ll listen to you and find someone you’re satisfied with?

“I advise you that since you can’t change some things, you might as well change your mindset and try to accept it slowly.

“Otherwise, you won’t be able to get anything in the end. You and Ah Si are already in this state, haven’t you figured it out yet?

“You’ll only be satisfied if your two sons break up with you?

“I don’t think you’re stupid. Why are you so stubborn about this? Yes, I’m not satisfied with the girl’s background. Are the two children satisfied?”

Madam Mo pursed her lips and kept quiet for a while before saying firmly, “No matter what, I won’t let my son marry such a woman. Mom, don’t persuade me. I gave birth to my son. I just can’t accept it.

“Shixiu is someone who’s going to do big things in the future. If he’s chosen, do you think that girl Jiang’s family background is suitable to be the woman by his side? Even if Shixiu doesn’t find someone of equal social status, it can’t be too bad. Mom, don’t worry about this anymore. I know what to do.”

Old Madam looked at her stubbornness and sneered. “Alright, I don’t care anymore. I can’t be bothered to say anything about you in the future. Just don’t cry to me when you regret it.”

“I won’t regret it,” Madam Mo said stubbornly. “Everything I’ve done is for their own good. It’s alright even if they don’t understand me now. They’ll understand one day.”

“At the end of the day, what you care about is family background. But the world is unpredictable. Back then, you only wanted to matchmake Ah Si and Shen Rou because you felt that the Shen and Mo families were compatible. But what’s the situation with the Shen family now? Would you still want Ah Si to marry the Shen family’s daughter?

“You’re against Mianmian because you think her family background is too ordinary. But now that she’s the apple of the Bai family’s eye, she’s the most compatible with Ah Si. Are you satisfied now? You’ve already hurt the harmony in the family. Family harmony is everything. To me, there’s nothing more important than family harmony. Think about it yourself. This is the last time I’m saying this to you.”

With that, Old Madam got someone to help her leave.

Madam Mo stood rooted to the ground with a complicated expression.

She was still thinking about what Old Madam said.

In the past, Shen Rou was her favorite daughter-in-law.

She watched Shen Rou grow up. The two families knew each other well and their families were compatible. There was no woman more suitable for her son than Shen Rou.
