Chapter 475: I Didn’t Expect to See You

She had booked the room for two hours, and it had been less than an hour so far.

It was rather expensive, so she didn’t think it was worth it to leave halfway.

Since she was already there, there was no point in wasting the money. She decided to sing for the full two hours before leaving.

She picked some songs that she liked and sang them one after the next.

After just over 10 minutes, she heard someone knocking on the door from outside.

Thinking it was the waiter, she spoke into the microphone, “Come in.”

When the door opened, Qiao Mianmian suddenly heard a familiar voice. “Qiao Mianmian, it’s you...”

She looked up and got a slight shock. “Linda, it’s you...”

It was Linda who entered.

She was meeting someone for an appointment here.

But she heard a really good voice when she was passing by this private room, and she couldn’t hold herself back from finding out who it was.

Linda had just signed under Huan Yu. Although Huan Yu did appoint a few artistes for her to manage, she wanted to take on some artistes of her own.

After all, the artistes whom Huan Yu assigned her weren’t under her from the start of their career. It still felt different.

She hadn’t expected the person singing in the private room to be Qiao Mianmian.

Qiao Mianmian was shocked to see Linda, but Linda was even more surprised to see Qiao Mianmian. There was a huge look of disbelief on her face. “It was... you singing?”

Qiao Mianmian hesitated for a few seconds before nodding. “Yes. Why?”

Linda sized her up from her head to her toes, and then looked back up at her. “Your voice is good. I was impressed by your voice when I heard it from outside, so I came in to see how this person looked.”

“I didn’t expect to see you.” Linda’s eyes were almost sparkling.

She really hadn’t expected this.

After all, she’d never heard Qiao Mianmian sing.

She didn’t think that her voice was so good. She’d already planned to take Qiao Mianmian under her wing, and now that she discovered another talent of hers, she was even more pleasantly surprised.

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

It was as if Linda had found a treasure chest.

“Mianmian, have you considered what we spoke about?” Linda addressed her differently now. She sounded more endearing. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Qiao Mianmian wasn’t used to this change.

“Uh, I...”

“Tell me, what are your concerns?” Linda seemed very afraid that Mianmian would reject her. “Is it because I used to be Qiao Anxin’s manager, and I used to work at Star Splendor for many years, so you’re worried I’d return?

“If this is your concern, I can tell you for certain that I’m never going back to Star Splendor, even if Su Ze begs me someday. That jerk actually said that I was the one spreading rumors about you on your school’s forum, just because he was trying to defend Qiao Anxin. He’s inhuman! I had already left Star Splendor at that time, but he didn’t let me off.

“The next time I see him, he’s going to get it from me!”

Linda looked so angry that she was practically heaving.

She was even clenching her teeth towards the end.

As if she was talking about her father’s killer.
