Chapter 2891: Beaten Up Badly

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Yes, hurry up and apologize. It’s not worth it to lose your job over this.”

The crowd couldn’t bear to see them lose their jobs.

Everyone made mistakes.

It was fine as long as she could correct her mistakes.

The front desk girl saw that everyone was speaking up for Lin Huizhen and Qiao Anxin, and her eyes reddened. “I won’t apologize. I don’t want to apologize to her. Her daughter is a bad person. She stole someone else’s boyfriend and spread rumors.

“I don’t want such a bad woman to stay in our hotel.”

“Who are you calling a bad woman! Say it again and I’ll tear your mouth apart!” Lin Huizhen was so angry that her face turned green.

“She’s a bad woman. She’s shameless. She stole someone else’s boyfriend and even had plastic surgery to look like someone else. She’s even spreading rumors about others!” The girl was furious too. She pointed at Qiao Anxin and scolded her. “Your daughter is immoral. Everyone in the country knows how shameless she is now. If you have the ability, shut the mouths of everyone in the country!”

“That’s right. Shameless.” The other girl also started scolding her.

Lin Huizhen was so angry that she was about to hit her.

Seeing this, the crowd quickly stopped the fight.

Qiao Anxin lost her rationality and followed Lin Huizhen to hit the two receptionists.

The crowd stopped them.

“She gave birth to such a shameless woman and still has the cheek to hit someone.”

“If the upper beam isn’t straight, the lower beam will be crooked. No wonder she raised such a shameless daughter. So, as a mother, she’s nothing good.” The two girls weren’t to be outdone as they scolded her.

Lin Huizhen was so angry that smoke was coming out of her ears. She reached out to push the two of them. “You two little b*tches, I’m going to skin you alive today. Let go, don’t hold me, let me tear their mouths apart.”

At this moment, Qiao Mianmian’s fans walked over.

Everyone’s expressions changed as they stared at Qiao Anxin.

“You’re Qiao Anxin?”

“No wonder she looks so much like our Mianbao. It’s you.”

“You’re really Qiao Anxin?”

The two receptionists saw the fans walking over and immediately said, “She’s Qiao Anxin! Are you Mianbao’s fans too? Then, help us judge it. We didn’t do anything wrong, right? We’re not letting her stay here for the sake of the hotel’s image.”

After the fans confirmed Qiao Anxin’s identity, the group of pretty girls looked at her as if she was their enemy.

“You’re really Qiao Anxin. Alright, you’ve bullied Mianbao time and time again. Today, we’ve finally met you. We’ll teach you a lesson on Mianbao’s behalf.”

Qiao Anxin’s expression changed when she saw the group of fans walking towards her. “What are you doing, don’t come over!”

…

Half an hour later, at the police station.

“Alright, since your injuries aren’t serious and both sides fought, this matter is over. Hand over the fine and you can leave.”

Qiao Anxin’s face was bruised.

She cried and told the police about her grievances and helplessness. Hearing the police’s decision, her eyes widened in disbelief. “This isn’t serious? Can’t you see that I’ve been beaten up badly? FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“What do you mean by fighting each other? They’ve been hitting me all along. I didn’t even have a chance to fight back!”
