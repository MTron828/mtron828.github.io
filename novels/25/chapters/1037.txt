Chapter 1038: Only I Can Give You Happiness

“Mianmian, you...”

Before Su Ze could finish, Qiao Mianmian sneered and looked at him as if he was a joke. “Does Mr. Su think that you’re more handsome than my boyfriend, that you have a better figure than him, or that you’re richer and more powerful than him?

“Besides being better than him in terms of scum, what else are you better than him in?

“My boyfriend is so much better than you in every aspect. You actually think that I’m with him to spite you?” Qiao Mianmian couldn’t help but laugh. “Mr. Su, you’re overconfident.

“I have a good relationship with my boyfriend. I don’t want him to see you with me again. Mr. Su, please don’t look for me anymore. I really don’t want to see you anymore.” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Su Ze’s expression darkened with every word Qiao Mianmian said.

By the time she was done, Su Ze’s expression was already extremely dark.

He clenched his fists. “Qiao Mianmian, you...”

“I’m sorry if my words make Mr. Su uncomfortable.” Qiao Mianmian looked at him expressionlessly. “But if I don’t say it, I’m afraid Mr. Su won’t be able to see himself clearly.”

“Su Ze.” Qiao Mianmian suddenly changed the way she addressed him. “Don’t pester me anymore, and don’t think that I still have feelings for you. I’m very happy now, and I love my boyfriend.

“I’ve already said it the day we broke up. I’ll go my own way in the future, and you’ll go your own way. We’ll have nothing to do with each other in the future. This is the last time I’m saying this to you. I hope you can save some face for yourself and not do such a terrible thing like harassing me.

“I think the president of Star Splendor doesn’t lack women around him. It’s too ugly for you to cling onto me like this.”

“Yes, I don’t lack women around me.” Su Ze suddenly became agitated. He took a step forward and grabbed Qiao Mianmian’s hand. “But Qiao Mianmian, I only want you. The only woman I want to marry is you.

“Please give me another chance, please don’t give up on me.

“Mianmian, I love you. I can’t live without you.”

Qiao Mianmian felt as if she was on fire the moment Su Ze grabbed her hand. She immediately tried to shake his hand off.

But Su Ze grabbed her tightly.

“Su Ze, are you crazy? Let go of me.” Qiao Mianmian couldn’t imagine how this man could be so shameless. Just a moment ago, he was still holding onto another woman, and now he was asking her to give him a chance.

How could he say something like that!

She realized that ever since she broke up with Su Ze, this man was always so shameless.

She didn’t know if it was because of his good disguise or because she was too blind.

She hadn’t seen his true colors for 10 whole years.

She thought he was a rare good man.

His touch disgusted her.

Qiao Mianmian struggled to free her hand, but Su Ze seemed to have lost his rationality. He tightened his grip on her wrist, and even his eyes turned red. “Mianmian, give me another chance. Only I can give you happiness.”
