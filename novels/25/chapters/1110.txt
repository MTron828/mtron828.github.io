Chapter 1111: Is Her Name Qiao Anxin?

If she got pregnant one day, wouldn’t she dominate the Mo Family?

Would she still have a place in the Mo Family in the future?

As the matriarch of the Mo Family, what right did she have to speak?

At the thought of all the possible consequences, her gaze turned cold and determined. She swore to herself that no matter what, she would make Qiao Mianmian leave the Mo family and her son.

Since persuading her to leave was useless, then don’t blame her for being merciless.

She didn’t believe that she, Shangguan Wenpei, could not do anything to such a small character.

...

On the other side.

Shen Rou received a document.

She spent half an hour going through all the information the private investigator had gathered.

After reading it, she pursed her lips and tightened her grip on the information she had just finished reading.

The person who had given her the information looked at her expression and said hesitantly, “Miss Shen, during our investigation, we discovered something else.”

Shen Rou took a deep breath and looked up. “What is it?”

“We found out that other people are also investigating the matter of the daughter of the Bai family who was left outside.”

Shen Rou paused and frowned. “Others? Are they from the Bai family?”

“No.” The man next to her immediately said, “If it was someone from the Bai family, then there’s no need to especially tell Miss Shen. According to our investigation, we found that those people seem to be from the Qiao family.”

“The Qiao family?” Shen Rou’s eyes were filled with surprise. She instantly perked up. “You said that the Qiao family is also investigating this matter? Do you know who?” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“We followed the clues and checked. If there’s nothing wrong, it should be the Qiao family’s second daughter.”

“The second daughter of the Qiao family?” Shen Rou was stunned. A strange look flashed across her eyes and she clenched her fists. “Is she called Qiao Anxin?”

From the moment Shen Rou treated Qiao Mianmian as her love rival, she had already investigated Qiao Mianmian.

At that time, Gong Zeli had helped her investigate.

Hence, Shen Rou knew that Qiao Mianmian and Su Ze had dated before.

She also knew that Su Ze broke up with her because of her stepsister.

“Yes, her name is Qiao Anxin.” The man beside her thought for a while and said in a low voice, “If Miss Shen still wants to know more details, I can help you find out more. However, those people are private detectives. If you want to know everything from them, Miss Shen might...”

Before the man could finish speaking, Shen Rou interrupted him in a low voice. “Go and find out immediately. You can pay as much as you want. I want to know why Qiao Anxin wants to know about the Bai family.”

“Yes, Miss Shen. I’ll go do it now.”

After accepting the mission, the man left immediately.

Shen Rou held the stack of documents in her hands and thought about what the man had just said. Her face turned cold.

She bit her lip, hatred evident in her eyes.

No, that was impossible.

Things were definitely not what she thought.

How could Qiao Mianmian be related to the Bai family?

Other than her age, what else did she have to do with that daughter of the Bai family?

If she could be the daughter of the Bai family just because they were of the same age, then many people in Yun Cheng could be the daughter of the Bai family.
