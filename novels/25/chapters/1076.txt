Chapter 1078: You Have to Sacrifice Your Family

“You...” Madam Shen was livid.

“Mom, don’t argue with Sister.” Shen Xin, who had been silent all this while, suddenly said, “I think Sister is right. Marriage is a big event in one’s life. How can you marry someone you don’t like?”

“Shut up.” Madam Shen was in a fit of anger and didn’t stand on ceremony with her. “What is liking? Can it be eaten? If I thought the same way back then, would the two of you still be able to live such a good life?”

“Shen Rou, let me tell you. I don’t care if you like Bai Yusheng or not. You have to find a way to marry him.” Madam Shen’s tone suddenly became forceful.

Shen Rou’s temper rose as well. “Mom, I’ll tell you now that I won’t marry him. My life is up to me.”

“It’s not up to you,” Madam Shen said angrily. “You have received the Shen family’s favor for so many years. Now that your family is in trouble, you have the obligation to help us tide through this crisis. You’re not going to marry, right? If you don’t, then don’t even think about being the Shen family’s daughter anymore.”

Shen Xin was stunned. Then, she asked curiously, “Mom, what do you mean? What’s wrong with our family?”

Shen Rou frowned and looked at Madam Shen in confusion. “Mom, what did you mean by that?”

Madam Shen was silent for a long time before finally saying, “Now that things have come to this, I don’t want to hide it from you anymore. There’s a problem with our family’s company, and we need to find a reliable partner to work with. And the most reliable partnership is when the two families become in-laws.

“In that case, we will all suffer together.

“Don’t worry. Of all the aristocratic families in Yun Cheng compatible with our Shen family, only the son of the Bai family is the most suitable for Rourou. Rourou, it’s not that I want to force you, but you’re the daughter of the Shen family. Now that the Shen family is in trouble, you have the obligation to help your family survive this crisis.

“Besides, marrying into the Bai family is not a big deal for you. Even if the Shen family isn’t in trouble, marrying into the Bai family is a good choice.”

Shen Rou and Shen Xin were stunned.

Neither of them had thought that the Shen family would encounter any difficulties.

“If the Shen family can’t overcome this crisis, it will be a huge blow to the Shen Enterprise’s economy. It will be difficult to think about it in the future. If the Shen family falls from grace, do you think you can still live the same way as you live now?

“At that time, would others still take our Shen family seriously?”

When Madam Shen said this, she sighed softly. She grabbed Shen Rou’s hand and said, “Rourou, for the sake of the Shen family, you have to be together with Bai Yusheng. Your father and I have loved you since we were young. If it wasn’t for this incident at home, I wouldn’t force you.

“But now, you have to make some sacrifices for your family.”

Shen Rou’s face instantly turned pale.

“Mom, you’re not lying to me, right? Our Shen family is really...” Her voice trembled. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

The only thing that supported her pride was her status as the eldest daughter of the Shen family.

If one day, even this identity was no longer important, she couldn’t imagine what it would be like.

“Rourou, whether the Shen family can survive this ordeal will depend on you.” Madam Shen looked at her with a serious expression and said, “You have to think of a way to settle the marriage with Bai Yusheng as soon as possible and release the news that the Bai and Shen families are becoming in-laws.”
