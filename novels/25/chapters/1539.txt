Chapter 1540: I’m Doing This for Your Good, I’m Afraid You...

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Before she could finish, Qiao Chen interrupted her coldly. “It doesn’t matter what you think, but don’t judge a person without understanding her.”

“Qiao Chen, are you helping Shen Xin? Do you think I’ve wronged her?” Lin Xiaoya looked at him in disbelief. “I wasn’t the only one who said this. Everyone in school did. If she wasn’t like this, why would everyone say this about her?

“I’m doing this for your own good. I’m afraid you...”

“There’s no need to worry,” Qiao Chen said coldly. “We’re just classmates. I’ll handle my own matters, no one else has to worry.”

His words were like a slap to Lin Xiaoya’s face.

Her expression turned awful.

She couldn’t understand why Qiao Chen was so nice to her.

Why did he suddenly become so cold?

Just because she mentioned Shen Xin?

But everyone in school said that he hated her.

But his behavior today didn’t seem like he disliked Shen Xin at all. Instead, it seemed like...

Lin Xiaoya widened her eyes in disbelief.

Could he...

Qiao Chen ignored her and walked towards the car.

...

In the car.

Qiao Chen called out, “Sister, Brother-in-law.”

Qiao Mianmian sat in the front passenger seat and looked at Qiao Chen’s expression through the rearview mirror. She asked casually, “Chen Chen, I just saw you walking with a girl. Is that your classmate?”

“Mm, we’re from the same school but different classes.” Qiao Chen looked calm.

“Different classes? How did you meet?”

“We met during rehearsals.”

“Oh, I see. That girl is pretty.” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“Sister, we’re just ordinary friends.” Qiao Chen grew up with Qiao Mianmian, so how could he not know what his sister was thinking? “As for whether she’s pretty or not, I didn’t notice.”

“You didn’t notice?” Qiao Mianmian was amused. “Don’t tell me you don’t remember what she looks like.”

“Mm, I can’t remember,” Qiao Chen replied honestly. “I don’t want to remember.”

“Then, do you remember what Shen Xin looks like?”

Qiao Chen kept quiet.

“I think Shen Xin is prettier than that girl.” Qiao Mianmian looked at him in the rearview mirror and said, “Her temperament is better than hers too. She’s just a little taller than Shen Xin, but Shen Xin isn’t short.

“Just being pretty isn’t enough. I think moral values are more important.”

“Sister, I just want to study well now. I won’t consider anything else.” Qiao Chen was a little speechless. He rubbed his forehead and said helplessly, “So, you don’t have to tell me this. I know what to do and what not to do.”

“I’m not against you dating.” Qiao Mianmian said seriously, “As long as it doesn’t affect your studies, there’s nothing wrong with it. I just hope that your future girlfriend will at least be a girl with good character. No matter how good she is in other aspects, she can’t have a bad character.”

Qiao Chen quickly guessed that Qiao Mianmian was referring to Lin Xiaoya.

It seemed like she had heard what Lin Xiaoya said to him.

“Chen Chen is already so old, do you think he’s still a child?” Mo Yesi listened to their conversation and smiled. “A girl who can make Chen Chen fall for her definitely isn’t the kind of girl you’re talking about.”
