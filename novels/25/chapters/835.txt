Chapter 836: I Don’t Care How Much You Have to Pay, Just Settle It for Me

The waiter quickly said, “Miss Shen, don’t worry, I won’t dare to say anything.”

...

After Gong Zeli left, he drove around aimlessly for a long time.

He didn’t know where he was going.

He found the truth so quickly.

After finding out what was important to him, he didn’t know what he was going to do.

If Qiao Mianmian was still single, he could look for her immediately.

He could pursue her crazily.

He could do many things.

But it was too late.

So late... that he couldn’t do anything.

She already had someone by her side who treated her well. She didn’t need him anymore.

But was he not going to do anything?

She was his savior.

She saved his life.

It was fine if he didn’t know the truth, but since he knew, he had to do something.

Her cell phone suddenly rang.

He looked down and picked up the call. “Young Master, we have some leads on the matter you asked us to investigate previously. Then...”

“There’s no need to investigate further.” Gong Zeli looked out of the window and narrowed his eyes. “I’ve already made things clear.”

“Yes, Young Master.”

Just as the person was about to hang up, Gong Zeli suddenly called out. “Wait.”

“Young Master, do you have any other instructions?”

Gong Zeli narrowed his eyes and thought for a while. “Do the Gong Corporation’s businesses have any new products?”

“New product?”

The subordinate was stunned for a while before replying, “There are a lot of new products coming out recently. I wonder which aspect Young Master Gong is more interested in?”

Gong Zeli thought for a while. “What product do you think is suitable for female celebrities to shoot commercials for?”

“This... suitable for female celebrities to shoot commercials? Probably jewelry or cosmetics.”

“Jewelry and cosmetics?”

“Yes. Young Master... why are you suddenly asking about this?”

“Go to the company and ask if the spokesperson has been signed. If not, I’ll personally decide on the candidate. If it is, tell them to change it.”

The subordinate was stunned for a few seconds. “Change it? Young Master, if you change it, you’ll have to pay the compensation fee.”

The Gong Corporation would definitely choose the most popular artiste to advertise.

If he breached the contract, he would have to pay a huge sum.

Although the Gong Consortium could easily afford that amount of money, it was best not to exchange for it unless there was a special reason.

No matter how rich he was, it didn’t come easily.

“Then pay the compensation fee.” Gong Zeli tapped on the car window lightly and said disapprovingly, “We don’t lack that bit of money. Remember, if you sign the contract, get them to contact someone to terminate it immediately.F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“I don’t care how much you pay for the breach of contract, just settle it.”

“... Yes.”

Although the subordinate was confused, he had no choice but to follow his Young Master’s instructions.

After hanging up, Gong Zeli looked out the window again.

This was probably all he could give her.

He couldn’t give her some things openly, and given her personality, she definitely wouldn’t accept it.

Hence, this was the best way.

...

Mo Yesi got off work early.

After work, Qiao Mianmian accompanied him to a nearby mall to get him a mask.
