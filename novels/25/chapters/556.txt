Chapter 558: What Am I to Him?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Am I?” Shen Rou chuckled.

The bartender nodded and said in agitation, as if afraid she wouldn’t believe it, “It’s true. Miss Shen is the most beautiful woman I’ve ever seen.”

When Shen Rou heard the words “most beautiful,” she picked up the cocktail on the counter and finished it all.

“Then, do you like me?” Shen Rou smiled at the bartender and pinched his cheek a little.

“Miss Shen, you...” the bartender looked at her, stunned. This young bartender was unable to resist women like Shen Rou—rich, beautiful, and of “premium grade.” He was delighted to think that she had an interest in him.

He immediately said, “I do, of course, I do. Miss Shen is the goddess in every man’s heart. Every man likes you.”

“Is it? No man would dislike me?” Shen Rou looked at the bartender in feigned shock, but tears welled up in her eyes the moment she thought of Mo Yesi’s cold and heartless expression.

So all men would like her.

But that did not include him.

But besides him, who else did she care for.

She just wanted him, just him, to like her.

And yet, his heart was already with another woman.

He was willing to sacrifice her and have her heart bleed, just for that woman’s sake.

He didn’t care how much pain she felt.

Nor did he care about the wounds he’d leave on her.

He didn’t give a hoot about 20 years of her contribution and feelings.

All because of that woman Qiao Mianmian.

She knew that at this point, she should just let go of him and walk away with her head up high.

She was Young Lady Shen, the ideal partner of many and the envy of many more.

She was the winner in life in everyone’s eyes.

How could she harass a man at the expense of her dignity?

She’d be a laughing stock if anyone found out.

The First Miss of the Shen family couldn’t possibly do something so low.

But she felt indignant.

He was taken away just like that.

When she’d found out, it was all too late.

He saved on all the dating and went straight for marriage with that woman.

All of a sudden, he was a man with a wife.

All of a sudden, he had become someone else’s husband.

And then, he started to draw boundaries, distancing himself from her.

“So all men would like me... but why doesn’t he? Why did he choose a woman he’d known for less than a month, over me?

“What am I to him?

“Why did he marry a woman like that instead of considering me?”

She was so, so indignant.

How could she be willing to back off after being defeated by a woman like that?

She was full of anger.

Anger towards herself for not being proactive all this while. Why did she have to save that pride, to be so passive as she waited in expectation of the day he would confess to her?

If she’d put down her pride and pursued him back then. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Perhaps, she wouldn’t have lost him.

She wasn’t sure if it was too late to realize this now and to do it all over again. But she knew that she couldn’t just let go of him like this.

20 years of feelings for him.

If she let go, it was going to feel as if she’d lost a part of her heart.

Although she wouldn’t die immediately, she’d be living in pain.

“Miss Shen, you should stop drinking,” the bartender said out of concern as he watched her down one drink after another. “You’ve drunk enough. You’ll get really drunk if you go on like this.”
