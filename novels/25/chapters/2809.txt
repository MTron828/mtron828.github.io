Chapter 2810: So What If You Don’t Like It

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Then, she saw Jiang Xinyue’s expression change. She was shocked and flustered.

She had a huge reaction to what Qiao Mianmian said.

She widened her eyes and looked at Qiao Mianmian in disbelief.

This reaction made Qiao Mianmian very clear that her guess was probably true.

Otherwise… Jiang Xinyue wouldn’t have had such a huge reaction.

If she hadn’t had plastic surgery… if she hadn’t done it herself… 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Otherwise, Qiao Mianmian’s words wouldn’t be a humiliation to her, and her first reaction would definitely not be like this.

Qiao Mianmian was shocked.

If her guess was true, then Jiang Xinyue’s true identity… was very suspicious.

It wasn’t strange she did plastic surgery.

But Qiao Mianmian saw Qiao Anxin in this person, so she couldn’t think about it normally.

“W-What nonsense are you talking about!” After a moment of panic, Qiao Anxin forced herself to remain calm and denied it. “Qiao Mianmian, I respect you as a senior, that’s why I’m so polite to you. But this doesn’t mean that you can humiliate me as you wish.

“You’re too much.

“What makes you think I did plastic surgery? Just because we look alike? Qiao Mianmian, aren’t you too narcissistic? There are so many people in the world who look alike. Did they all do plastic surgery?”

Qiao Anxin panicked.

She was afraid that Qiao Mianmian would recognize her.

If she was recognized…

Qiao Mianmian would never tolerate her.

She hadn’t found a strong backing yet, so she didn’t have the capital to go against her.

Qiao Mianmian’s words were enough to ruin all her efforts.

“Miss Jiang, don’t tell me you think others can’t tell that you did plastic surgery?” Qiao Mianmian continued to provoke her. “Some things are fake. Even if you use some methods to make it look real, it doesn’t mean it’s real.

“There are indeed many people in the world who look alike, but you were definitely not born this way. You were modeled after me, do you think I can’t tell? I have to say that the doctor who did the plastic surgery is indeed skilled. But you’re a fake. Where did you get the courage to be on the same show as me? You said I humiliated you. Ha, looking at your face, I feel like I’m the one being humiliated!”

“Qiao Mianmian, you’re too much!” Qiao Anxin was indeed angered. “Who do you think you are! If you hadn’t married Mo Yesi, you’d be nothing now!

“Besides this face, what else do you have!”

Qiao Mianmian saw that Qiao Anxin’s face was turning green from anger, and her attitude became even more arrogant. She continued to provoke her. “But I’m married to Mo Yesi. With him doting on me, so what if you don’t like it?

“I can only rely on my looks to make a living. So what if you’re unhappy? Didn’t you do plastic surgery because you think my face is good? You want to make it as good as mine and then rely on your face to make a living?”

Qiao Mianmian raised her chin arrogantly.

“Moreover, even if I’m not married to Mo Yesi, I’m still the daughter of the Bai family. I have parents and a brother who dote on me.. I can get whatever I want easily.”
