Chapter 1821: Qiao Mianmian Was in the limelight Alone

She felt that Qiao Mianmian was in the limelight.

Everyone in the team seemed to admire Qiao Mianmian.

It was just a little something.

What was so amazing about that?

She would do these things too.

Song Ke’s expression darkened when she saw Han Yan.

She considered Han Xin to be on the same side as them, so Han Yan’s actions were a betrayal to her.

“Alright, we’ve successfully completed the mission. It’s all thanks to Mianmian this time. If it wasn’t for her, we’d definitely have failed this mission.” Shen Fei held Qiao Mianmian’s hand and said gently, “When there’s a chance, I’ll definitely treat you to a meal.”

“Sister Shen, you’re too kind.” Qiao Mianmian smiled. “You helped me before.”

“Can we go back for lunch now?” Zhan Bo touched his stomach. “I’m hungry. Mianmian, what are we having for lunch?”

Qiao Mianmian turned around and met four pairs of expectant eyes.

Su Mufei looked at her expectantly. “Yes, Sister Mianmian. What are we having for lunch?”

Qiao Mianmian’s breakfast made them think about her culinary skills. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Qiao Mianmian looked at them in amusement. “That depends on how much we earn from the commission. If the income is good, I can consider making two meat dishes for you in the afternoon. But don’t think of sitting and enjoying the benefits. When the time comes, come to the kitchen and help me.”

“No problem. You’re in charge of cooking, and we’re in charge of cleaning up after meals. So, are we going back now?”

Qiao Mianmian looked at the time and nodded. “Mm, let’s go back first.”

...

Qiao Mianmian’s team made over 50 yuan from selling lotus roots.

Not only did Shen Fei not make any money, but she even made a huge loss. However, the boss still gave her 20 yuan.

20 yuan wasn’t enough for five people.

After receiving the money, each person could only buy a bag of instant noodles and a sausage for lunch.

Meanwhile, Qiao Mianmian went to the market and bought a lot of groceries with the 50 yuan.

She bought half a kilogram of meat, a fish, and a lot of vegetables. Zhan Bo and Su Mufei became her sidekicks. They each carried a bag and happily returned to their courtyard house.

“Make a sweet and sour fish for lunch, braised pork, and two vegetable dishes. Four dishes should be enough for the five of us. We can cook noodles for the rest of the dishes tonight. What do you think?”

Fifty yuan was enough for them to eat for a day.

“There’s sweet and sour fish and red braised pork for lunch?” Su Mufei was as happy as a fatty. “This is too awesome, I think it’s very good.”

“I think so too.”

“Aren’t we going overboard?” Ren Jun walked into the kitchen and said in a low voice, “I saw Han Yan and the rest eating instant noodles. Do you think our sweet and sour fish and red braised pork will agitate them?”

“They’re so pitiful, eating instant noodles? Then, we seem a little overboard. But what has this got to do with us? Everyone eats with their own abilities. Speaking of which, if Mianmian hadn’t helped them, I think they wouldn’t even have been able to eat instant noodles.”

Qiao Mianmian looked at the chattering men and said in amusement, “Alright, are you done? Come over and help if you’re done. Zhan Bo, go wash this vegetable. Su Mufei, boil the water. The meat has to be boiled.”
