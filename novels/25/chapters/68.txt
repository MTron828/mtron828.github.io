Chapter 69: Hasn’t He Gone to Work?

“Qiao Mianmian, you’re a slut!”

Qiao Mianmian was completely unfazed by the insults.

Jiang Luoli was worried that those words would trigger her.

After all, it hadn’t been long since the break-up.

Jiang Luoli was about to comfort her when she heard a gasp among the crowd. Some even screamed with excitement.

“Whoa, who’s that guy, he’s so handsome!”

“He’s so tall, maybe 1.88m or so? And his physique is fantastic. He looks so attractive in that black shirt.”

“Damn, he’s so handsome. I think he’s better looking than the most handsome boy in school.”

Jiang Luoli was stunned for a while as she followed their gazes.

She saw the tall figure standing not too far away and was caught by surprise.

Qiao Mianmian turned around as well, and her jaw dropped upon seeing him.

The man walking over was extremely good-looking and charismatic. His eyes looked sharp and the black shirt and pants he was wearing made him appear cool and distant.

He also seemed to have a unique aura around him that captured everyone’s attention at first glance.

Even Jiang Luoli was appealed.

She quickly grabbed Qiao Mianmian’s arm. “Damn, Mianmian, did you see that. There’s a super hunk in front.”

Qiao Mianmian opened her mouth but couldn’t say a word. Jiang Luoli went on squealing. “Ah, Mianmian, he’s walking towards us. He seems to be looking at us.”

“Oh no, oh no. I can’t deal with this. Tell me, am I overthinking this or is that hunk looking at us?!”

Qiao Mianmian went quiet.

She looked at how excited Jiang Luoli had gone and didn’t know what to say.

Jiang Luoli was easily drawn by looks.

She was the sort who would whistle at handsome men on the street.

And her level of excitement was proportionate to how good-looking the person was.

This was Qiao Mianmian’s first time seeing her get this excited.

She was losing her mind.

But she wasn’t the only one.

The other girls were also yelling and squealing.

A few of them standing behind Qiao Mianmian were saying the same thing, “He’s walking towards us. Is he going to talk to us?”

“Ahhh! I think I’m going to pass out. He’s so handsome.”

“He isn’t a student here, right? He looks rather mature.”

That man’s appearance changed the entire atmosphere among the girls.

The only person who appeared calm and normal was Qiao Mianmian.

But she was only calm on the surface.

Her heart had been flipped a few times over the moment she saw Mo Yesi arrive.

What’s he doing here?!

Hasn’t he gone to work?

Qiao Mianmian found it rather surreal that she was seeing him right here in the female dormitory.

She stood there completely stunned as Mo Yesi approached her.

The distance between them got smaller... Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Ah, Mianmian, he’s coming. I’m so nervous! Should we make the move to say hi first? But what else are we going to say?” Jiang Luoli looked toward him expectantly.
