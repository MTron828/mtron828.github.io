Chapter 1776: Zhan Bo Doesn’t Like Her At All

Little Xiao nodded.

Zhan Bo debuted before them.

Speaking of which, as their seniors, they had to take the initiative to greet them.

Moreover, in this batch of guests, besides Shen Fei, Zhan Bo was the most popular. Song Ke and Little Xiao wanted to build a good relationship with him.

The two of them walked towards him.

“Senior.” Ignoring the fact that Zhan Bo looked like he was sleeping, Song Ke softened her voice and said coquettishly, “Senior, are you sleeping?”

Zhan Bo was a light sleeper.

He couldn’t sleep in the car. Just as he was about to fall asleep, someone suddenly called him.

It woke him up.

He opened his amber eyes and saw a face with exquisite makeup looking at him with a charming smile.

Zhan Bo looked at Song Ke’s bright smile and wanted to tear it apart.

He hated being woken up from his sleep.

Especially when he was about to fall asleep. If anyone woke him up, he would kill them.

Song Ke wasn’t familiar with him, so how could she know that he had a morning temper? Seeing that he opened his eyes, she asked idiotically, “Senior, did I wake you up? Were you asleep?”

Zhan Bo looked at Song Ke as if she was a fool. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Who else could it be?

You still have the cheek to ask?

Zhan Bo was unhappy, but he didn’t show it. He retracted his gaze and rubbed his eyes. In a few seconds, his expression returned to normal.

He scolded Song Ke for being “stupid” in his heart, but he smiled and said, “I wasn’t asleep, you didn’t wake me up.”

Zhan Bo and Song Ke had been on other shows together and had met a few times.

But they weren’t close.

Hence, Zhan Bo didn’t have much of an impression of her.

But now, because Song Ke woke him up just as he was about to fall asleep, Zhan Bo got angry and didn’t have a good impression of her.

And first impressions were very important.

Song Ke, who wanted to come over and be nice, didn’t know that she earned Zhan Bo’s displeasure.

“That’s good. I was afraid of disturbing Senior. It’s hot outside. Senior, are you thirsty? Do you want some water?” With that, she handed a bottle of mineral water to him.

Song Ke looked sweet, just like her name.

She was known as the “Goddess of Love”.

And the most attractive thing about her was her sweet smile.

Song Ke smiled sweetly at Zhan Bo.

Although she was also a popular actress, in terms of fame and real popularity, she was far inferior to Zhan Bo.

Moreover, Song Ke was still young. In front of a senior who was more famous and good-looking than her, she couldn’t help but harbor some thoughts.

In the backseat.

Qiao Mianmian looked up and saw Song Ke’s expression. As a woman, she knew what Song Ke was thinking.

Her eyes were full of charm.

But it was useless for Song Ke to hide her thoughts. Because Zhan Bo wouldn’t fall for it.
