Chapter 2469: Untitled

After informing Wei Zheng, he looked down at the little woman sleeping soundly in his arms. His slender and fair fingers gently landed on her delicate face, and his dark eyes revealed a hint of coldness.

No one could hurt his baby.

…

At the Mo Corporation.

When they got out of the car, Mo Yesi glanced at Qiao Mianmian sleeping soundly and couldn’t bear to wake her up.

He thought for a while, unbuckled his seatbelt, opened the door, and gently picked her up.

Qiao Mianmian was in a deep sleep. Mo Yesi carried her out of the car, but she still didn’t wake up.

Mo Yesi carried her into the elevator.

On the 37th floor, Mo Yesi walked out of the elevator with his coat and her head against his chest.

When they passed by the secretaries’ desks, Mo Yesi stopped them from speaking in case they awakened her.

The secretaries met his gaze and immediately kept quiet. Then, they saw the person in his arms.

Mo Yesi carried Qiao Mianmian into the office quickly.

After he left, the few secretaries who didn’t even dare to breathe gathered together and started discussing.

“Chairman Mo is so considerate. He was afraid that we’d wake Miss Qiao, so he didn’t let us make a sound.”

“Wow, Chairman Mo’s princess carry really hit my heart. He’s so careful.”

“I really didn’t expect Chairman Mo to pamper his woman so well. Miss Qiao is so lucky to receive Chairman Mo’s love.”

“Yes, I can tell that Chairman Mo really loves Miss Qiao. That’s why he’s so good to her.”

“It seems like the trending topics on Weibo were deliberately created to mislead the public. Chairman Mo and Miss Qiao have a good relationship, but they made it seem like they are about to break up. I wonder what their intentions are.”

“Exactly. Chairman Mo and Miss Qiao have always had a good relationship, and Chairman Mo has always pampered Miss Qiao. He even got me to specially buy desserts downstairs today. He doesn’t like desserts, so he must have bought them for Miss Qiao. He pampers Miss Qiao so much, how could he regret being with her?”

“I took a look at the trending topics. Someone is deliberately trying to make the netizens feel that Chairman Mo and Miss Qiao aren’t on good terms. I’m not saying that Chairman Mo is so powerful that he doesn’t need to find a woman who can help him, alright? If he needed to find such a woman, he wouldn’t be with Miss Qiao. Moreover, Miss Qiao isn’t bad. She’s super beautiful, and she acts well. She’s also the daughter of the Bai family. I think she’s rather compatible with Chairman Mo.” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“I also think that Miss Qiao is more suitable for Chairman Mo. I feel that Chairman Mo likes petite women, not strong women. Otherwise, he would have gotten together with Miss Shen long ago.”

The female secretaries discussed heatedly for a while, then recalled the trending topics they saw on Weibo. The more they thought about it, the more uncomfortable they felt. Hence, they went to Weibo anonymously and posted something.

Find out what I know: “It feels so funny to see the trending topics today. Some people are always thinking about my boss and his fiancée. I want to say that you don’t have to worry about them. My boss and his fiancée are doing well. Those who want to see them break up will definitely be disappointed.”
