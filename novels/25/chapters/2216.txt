Chapter 2217: Are You Still in Contact With Qiao Chen?

Shen Xin went upstairs and stood outside Shen Rou’s room for a while before gently knocking on the door.

“Who?”

“Sister, it’s me. Can I come in?”

The person in the room was silent for a while before saying, “Mm, come in.”

Shen Xin pushed the door open and entered Shen Rou’s bedroom.

Shen Rou had already changed out of her dress. She was wearing a purple silk robe and was removing her makeup.

“Sister.” Shen Xin stopped behind her.

Shen Rou didn’t turn around. “Is there something you need?”

Shen Xin felt bad hearing her cold voice.

Actually, she already felt that Shen Rou had something against her.

Although her sister hadn’t pampered her much since she was young, Shen Rou used to treat her pretty well.

She wasn’t as cold and distant as now.

Shen Rou’s attitude towards her changed, probably because she knew about Qiao Chen and her.

Then, something happened to the Shen family.

Because she spoke up for Qiao Chen, Shen Rou felt that she was siding with an outsider.

“Mm. Sister, Mom is worried about you, so she asked me to come up and take a look.”

“Mom is worried about me?” Shen Rou was removing her eye makeup. After removing it from one eye, she threw the dirty cotton on the table and turned around. Her red lips curled into a mocking smile. “Xiao Xin, do you know that you’re not good at lying? Because once you lie, your expression will change.

“Others might not be able to tell, but we’ve lived together for more than 10 years.”

Shen Xin’s expression stiffened. “Sister, Mom is indeed worried about you. Why do you think I’m lying?”

“Ha, worried about me? When did she worry about me? She’s only worried about you. After all, you’re her precious daughter.”

Her words put Shen Xin in an awkward position.

“Sister, why do you say that? Mom loves you, too.”

“Yes, she dotes on me. But compared to her precious daughter, she doesn’t dote on me that much.” Shen Rou couldn’t bear to think about how her parents forced her to go on blind dates when the family was in trouble.

Shen Xin bit her lip and didn’t know what to say.

Shen Rou looked up at her and thought of Qiao Mianmian.

That slut was the same.

She looked so charming and innocent and harmless.

She could tell that she was a scheming bitch.

But so many men took the bait.

She was a born vixen.

Shen Rou got angry.

Shen Xin’s heart skipped a beat when she saw the vicious look in her sister’s eyes.

She felt that Shen Rou had changed.

This person in front of her was her sister from the same father and mother, but at this time, she felt like a stranger.

“Xiao Xin.” Shen Rou suddenly called her. “Are you still in contact with Qiao Chen?”

Shen Xin panicked.

Shen Rou saw her reaction, and her eyes turned even colder. “You’re still in contact with him, right? Didn’t I tell you not to contact him anymore? Didn’t you hear me?”
