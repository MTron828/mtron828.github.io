She was still nervous.

She squeezed Mo Yesi’s hand tightly.

Squeezing her hand back, Mo Yesi gently massaged her palm, and then led her over.

“Mom, Grandma.” He led Qiao Mianmian over to the Old Madam, caressing her head affectionately, and then saying, “This is my wife, Qiao Mianmian. We have already obtained our marriage certificate. I brought her back today to see you.”

There were several seconds of silence.

After Mo Yesi introduced Qiao Mianmian, nobody spoke.

Mo Yesi didn’t seem concerned and just calmly introduced them to Qiao Mianmian. “Mianmian, this is my Grandma.”

Qiao Mianmian followed his gaze and looked at the Old Madam of the Mo family. She fell silent, took a deep breath, and squeezed a smile from the corner of his lips. She then called sweetly, “Hello, Grandma.”

The Old Madam squeezed her eyes, sizing her up.

She glanced from the bottom to the top, and then from top to bottom, carefully sizing her up. Then, a satisfied smile appeared on her face.

She was a neat and clean girl.

Very pleasing to look at.

The Old Madam had already fancied her, but after hearing her call “Grandma”, her smile widened involuntarily.

“Good girl.” She waved to Qiao Mianmian and said in a gentle voice, “Come here, let me take a closer look at you.”

Qiao Mianmian turned and looked at Mo Yesi inquiringly.

“Go.” Mo Yesi caressed her head affectionately and whispered with a smile, “Grandma likes you. Don’t be afraid, just go over for her to take a good look at you.”

The Old Madam of the Mo family liked her?

Qiao Mianmian couldn’t help but heave a sigh of relief. She felt like she had just received affirmation from one of the interviewers with the most powerful voice. She relaxed completely and didn’t feel as nervous as before.

Nodding slightly towards Mo Yesi, she took a deep breath, let go of his hand, and walked towards the Old Madam slowly.

As soon as she approached, the Old Madam grabbed her hand.

The Old Madam took her hand and looked at her from head to toe again. The smile on her face widened in satisfaction.

“Oh, this kid is so good-looking.”

Old Madam Mo glanced at Qiao Mianmian’s fair and tender skin and couldn’t help but sing praises. “Your skin is also weirdly good, how come it’s so fair? No one in our Mo family is so fair. Now that you’re married to Ah Si, you can help improve the Mo family’s genes.”

Qiao Mianmian blushed in her praise.

She could also tell that the Old Madam seemed to like her.

She thought that the elders of this kind of big family weren’t easy to get along with, but she didn’t expect this Old Madam to be so friendly.

She slowly became less nervous.

She was no longer helpless and at a loss.

She seemed to see her own grandmother from the Old Madam’s gentle and loving smile.

All of a sudden, she felt very close and dear.

Relaxing immediately, she took the Old Madam’s hand and said sweetly, “Grandma, your skin is also very fair. And you look so young, not like his Grandma at all. If he hadn’t introduced you in advance, I would have thought you were his aunt.”

She was obviously flattering her.

But the Old Madam was very soothed and smiled happily. She reached out and patted Qiao Mianmian’s hand lightly, then turned and said to Mo Yesi, “Ah Si, look at your wife, she has such a sweet mouth. Where did you go to find such a delightful granddaughter-in-law?
