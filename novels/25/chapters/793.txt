Chapter 794: Did She Offend the Director?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Many artistes had their own teams to manage their Weibo accounts.

Qiao Mianmian’s current status wasn’t high enough, so she didn’t have a professional team to help her manage it. Hence, she managed her own Weibo account.

“It’s not very good, but it depends on the specific situation. What you did today not only has no negative impact on you, but it can also help you gain a good impression. Because it warmed the hearts of fans and made it easy for passersby to have a good impression of you.”

“Is that so?” Qiao Mianmian patted her chest and heaved a sigh of relief.

She didn’t know the consequences before doing that.

She was rather impulsive.

But now that Linda mentioned it, it seemed like she was right?

“Mm, at least the comments and Weibo posts I see now are all praising you. They’re saying that you’re true to yourself and that protecting your fans is very heartwarming. But even though you did the right thing this time, you have to be careful in the future.”

After Linda was done with her praises, it was time for her to criticize and educate her. “Ask me what you want to post next time. Don’t make your own decisions. You were lucky this time. If you’re unlucky next time, just a casual sentence might kill you.”

Qiao Mianmian knew that she was impulsive this time.

Although it didn’t lead to any consequences and seemed like a good reaction, it didn’t mean that she was right. She couldn’t continue doing it in the future.

Hence, she accepted the criticism and said obediently, “Mm, I got it. I’ll ask you about it in the future.”

Linda was about to hang up.

Qiao Mianmian suddenly recalled something and called out to her. “Sister Xie.”

“Anything else?”

“Mm, there’s something. Uh... my third female role is gone.”

“What did you say?” Linda raised her voice. “What happened? How did you lose your role? Did you offend the director?”

“Uh, no. Director Bai said that I’m rather suitable for the female lead, so he asked me if I wanted to do it. Then, I agreed.”

Mm, Linda was her manager.

She had to tell her manager about this.

After Qiao Mianmian said that, there was no response.

She waited for a while, but there was still no reaction.

“Sister Xie?” She called out softly. “Are you still there? Did you hear what I said?”

Linda gasped before speaking again. “You’re saying that Bai Yusheng wants you to be the female lead?”

“Mm. I’m sorry, Sister Xie. I agreed to it without discussing it with you.” Qiao Mianmian felt that she was being disrespectful to her manager. Under normal circumstances, she would have to discuss it with her manager before deciding whether to take a role.

But she didn’t think too much about it.

She was so happy.

“Sister Xie, are you angry?” Qiao Mianmian asked anxiously when she realized that Linda was silent again.

“No.”

After a few seconds, Linda spoke again. “I’m not unhappy. I’m more than happy that you took the female lead role. Why would I be angry with you? But are you sure Bai Yusheng wants you to be the female lead? Has this matter been decided?”

Everyone in the industry knew that Huang Yilin had created a huge scandal.

It wasn’t surprising that Bai Yusheng would change the female lead role. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

After what happened, the female lead definitely couldn’t be played by a female artiste with negative scandals.
