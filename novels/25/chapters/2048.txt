Chapter 2049: What Right Does She Have to Stand in the C Position?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Previously, a female artiste deliberately stood in the C position at an event. Later on, she was scolded badly by the other artistes’ fans. She even released a video apologizing, but the fans still refused to accept it. They continued to scold her and directly shut her out.

Qiao Mianmian remembered that this female artiste left the industry.

At this thought, Qiao Mianmian was a little afraid of the so-called “C position”.

She didn’t want to be scolded by other fans like that female artiste.

She had already seen how crazy fans were.

As she hesitated, the emcee walked towards her and asked, “Miss Qiao, do you have any questions?”

Qiao Mianmian nodded.. “Did you make a mistake? That seat isn’t mine, right?”

“That’s your seat.” The emcee smiled and explained, “Miss Qiao is the person who donated the most at our party, so it’s normal for you to be in the C position. Miss Qiao, we’re about to take a big picture, come with me.”

Qiao Mianmian was still a little hesitant.

But seeing that everyone was waiting for her, she didn’t want to waste any more time. Although she still felt that it was a little inappropriate, she still followed the emcee.

She’d thought that Shen Rou would also be in the C position.

After all, she had donated a lot of money.

But when Qiao Mianmian went over, she realized that Shen Rou didn’t receive the same treatment as her. Her position wasn’t bad, but it wasn’t a C position.

At this moment.

The live stream was also very lively.

Because Qiao Mianmian was a newbie, some netizens started criticizing her.

“Qiao Mianmian is too self-conscious. She’s just a newbie, but she actually went to the C position. What right does she have to be in the C position? What are her achievements, what about her works? What right does she have to be treated the same as Shen Fei and the rest?”

“That’s right. I’m shocked. What right does she have to be in the C position? She really doesn’t know her place.”

“It’s already very nice being able to take a picture with so many seniors. As a newbie, she really doesn’t follow the rules.”

“Pfft, Qiao Mianmian is so shameless. In order to be in the limelight, she went to fight with the seniors for the C position. I think that Chairman Mo is blind. He actually took a liking to such a scheming woman. Young Lady Shen is so outstanding, who knows how many times better than this scheming bitch. How can his taste be so bad?”

“She’s just a passerby, she doesn’t stand on anyone’s side. As a newbie, Qiao Mianmian really shouldn’t fight for the C position. She’s obviously doing this because Chairman Mo is her backing, so no one dares to do anything to her. She’s trying to get more attention, but such behavior is really revolting.”

“Oh my, she’s openly fighting for the C position. She really doesn’t want her face anymore. I’ll like to see how her fans are going to spin this in her favor. Do you think she was forced to stand there?”

The live stream was filled with scolding.

They were all criticizing Qiao Mianmian.

As a newbie, it was very scandalous of her to snatch a position that didn’t belong to her. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Moreover, there were always haters defaming her.

They wouldn’t let go of such an opportunity.

“I believe Mianmian must have a reason for doing this! Don’t worry, Mianmian will definitely give us an explanation.”

“Mianmian didn’t go there herself. The emcee asked her to.”
