Chapter 2343: Help Me Think of a Way

But Xiaoyu didn’t dare to speak the truth.

Lin Wanwan was a competitive person and would definitely not allow herself to be inferior.

“Why aren’t you saying anything?” Lin Wanwan was unhappy with her silence. “Do you think Qiao Mianmian looks better?”

“No.” Xiaoyu immediately said, “I don’t think you’re the same type. You’re both pretty.”

She couldn’t go against her conscience and say that Lin Wanwan looked better.

But this answer didn’t satisfy Lin Wanwan.

She was still unhappy. “If you have to choose someone, who will you choose?”

“Wanwan…”

“Who will you choose? Who do you think is better? I don’t want to hear anything nice. I want you to choose someone.”

Xiaoyu looked at Lin Wanwan’s angry face and swallowed her saliva. She felt that her best friend had become a stranger.

She was a little afraid.

“Of course, Wanwan, you’re better looking. Wanwan, you’re the school belle. Your background is good too. How can others compare to you?”

“Is that so?”

“Of course!”

Lin Wanwan finally looked satisfied. She raised her chin like a proud peacock. “That’s more like it. It seems like there’s nothing wrong with your eyes. So what if Qiao Mianmian is good-looking? She’s already an old woman. Men don’t like old women.”

Xiaoyu wanted to remind her that Qiao Mianmian was only 20. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

She was only four years older than them.

She wasn’t an old woman.

But seeing how abnormal Lin Wanwan looked now, she kept quiet.

“Then, tell me, since I’m prettier than Qiao Mianmian, why does Brother Yesi only have eyes for that old woman?” Recalling Mo Yesi’s coldness, Lin Wanwan’s expression darkened again. “That old woman is really shameless. She keeps sticking to Brother Yesi. Does she have any sense of shame?”

Xiaoyu was stunned.

She couldn’t help but say, “But, but they’re husband and wife. Isn’t that normal?”

It was normal for couples to hug each other.

Not to mention a married couple.

That could only mean that they were harmonious and loving.

How was this related to shamelessness?

“So what?” Lin Wanwan seemed a little angry and growled. “Even if they’re husband and wife, they should pay attention outside. That old woman is so shameless. She keeps clinging to Brother Yesi like she has no bones.”

“…”

“Xiaoyu, help me think of a way.”

“…What, what way?”

“What do you think will make Brother Yesi like me?”

“Wanwan, you, you…” Xiaoyu was shocked speechless again.

Had she guessed correctly?

Wanwan really liked Mo Yesi?

“What are you talking about?” Lin Wanwan glared at her. “What’s there to be shocked about? Brother Yesi is such a perfect man, who wouldn’t like him? He’s so handsome, mature, elegant, and charismatic…

“Can you find a better man?”
