Chapter 555: She Could Never Be a Threat

It could never be compared to his wife.

If Shen Rou was a bit more logical, everyone could have continued this friendship peacefully.

But obviously, she was illogical this time.

From Wei Zheng’s experience, anyone who argued with Chairman Mo would end up losing.

Wait, no.

There wasn’t anyone that could win against him in the past, but there was Young Madam now.

But Shen Rou wasn’t the Young Madam.

Hence, Young Master would not give in to her.

His patience was reserved for Young Madam only.

Shen Rou bit on her lip as tears began to run down her cheeks again. Before she left, she glared one last time at Qiao Mianmian.

...

After they left, Mo Yesi pulled Qiao Mianmian into his arms.

“I wasn’t aware that she would be here.” He started to explain Shen Rou’s sudden appearance. “She told me an hour again that she wanted to see me. I said no, but she came, out of my expectations.

“What did she tell you when I wasn’t here?”

Mo Yesi looked down, and you could see the nervousness in his eyes.

“You’ve heard it all, right?” Qiao Mianmian replied as she leaned into his chest. As she listened to his heartbeat, she said jokingly, “You said that you rejected her, so she should have understood it. But from the way I see it, it doesn’t look like it.

“Did you lie to me?”

“No,” Mo Yesi instantly replied. “I would never lie to you. Everything that I’ve said is true. I have rejected her. But I can’t control how she reacted to it.”

“I just know that what she thinks and how she reacts doesn’t concern me. You’re the only person that can be my wife. No one can be Madam Mo other than you.”

Qiao Mianmian could feel her heart racing as she saw the determination in his eyes.

“Have you really, never liked Shen Rou before?” she asked after hesitating for a while.

From her perspective, Shen Rou was a really good catch.

She was the type that could make men fall for her easily.

She was pretty, had a good family background, and graduated from a top university. She was even a famous fashion designer in the industry.

She was a great match for Mo Yesi in every way.

They also grew up together.

Was it possible that Mo Yesi never liked her before?

Actually, Qiao Mianmian asked to satisfy her own curiosity.

There was no other intention.

But Mo Yesi thought that she was testing him and immediately attempted to clear up the relationship. He quickly denied. “Never, she isn’t my type. We were just friends.”

“She isn’t your type?” Qiao Mianmian was surprised by the reply. She blinked a few times before continuing her questioning. “Her qualities are perfect, and yet she isn’t your type? So, what is your type?”

After she asked, she felt a strong glare on her. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Baby, you’re my type,” Mo Yesi answered as he lifted her chin. He then looked at her in the eye and continued, “I’ve waited for over twenty years for you. Can’t you feel my sincerity? Don’t worry, she could never be a threat.”

Qiao Mianmian started to blush and replied, “I’m... I’m not worried.”

Who said that she was worried.
