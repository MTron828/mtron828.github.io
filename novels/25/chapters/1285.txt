Chapter 1287: Isn’t She Going Too Far?

She hesitated for a while before grabbing Qiao Mianmian’s hand. “Mianmian, are you really... not blaming me? Do you really understand what I did back then?”

Madam Bai was still worried.

She was afraid that Qiao Mianmian would say that she didn’t mind it but still blamed her inside.

She was afraid that her daughter wouldn’t acknowledge her.

“Mm.” Qiao Mianmian nodded. “Aunt, I really don’t blame you. I know everything you did was for my own good. You didn’t have a choice back then. I can understand.”

“That’s good, that’s good.” Madam Bai’s eyes were a little moist. “As long as you don’t blame me. Mianmian, I know you can’t accept this right now, so I won’t force you. You can go back and think about it slowly.

“But no matter what you decide in the end, I still hope that you can give me a chance to make it up to you as a mother. Even if you don’t want to acknowledge me, at least give me a chance to make it up to you.

“Otherwise, I’ll feel bad for the rest of my life.”

...

Leaving the Bai family.

Qiao Mianmian sat in the car and waited for the car to drive a distance away. She turned to look out of the window and could still see Madam Bai watching them leave.

She looked away after a while.

“What are you thinking about?” Beside her, Mo Yesi followed her gaze and reached out to pull her into his arms, gently rubbing the top of her head.

Qiao Mianmian leaned against his chest and listened to his steady heartbeat. She kept quiet for a while and then said unhappily, “Mo Yesi, I suddenly feel bad. Do you think I went overboard?”

She could tell how reluctant Madam Bai was.

She could tell that Madam Bai was upset too.

She knew that Madam Bai wanted to acknowledge her as her daughter immediately.

At that moment, Madam Bai stood rooted to the ground and watched them leave. Even though their car was already very far away, she still didn’t leave.

At that moment, she wondered if she’d gone overboard.

“Why are you upset?” Mo Yesi asked gently as he caressed her silky hair.

“I just feel terrible. I feel... that Aunt Bai is a little pitiful. I’m wondering if I’ve gone overboard. Should I not do anything to her? But...” Qiao Mianmian looked up and said blankly, “I’m not ready to acknowledge her.

“Mo Yesi, do you know?

“Actually, my mom treated me very well too. She was my adoptive mother, but she really doted on me, and I loved her very much. So now, I...” She didn’t know how to express her feelings.

But Mo Yesi understood.

He knew what she wanted to say. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

The man kept quiet for a few seconds before running his fingers through her hair. “Do you think you’ll let your adoptive mother down if you acknowledge Aunt Bai?”

Qiao Mianmian was silent for a while. “That’s one of the reasons. I just feel that Aunt Bai is a very warm and gentle elder to me. I like her too, but if she suddenly becomes my mother, I feel strange.”

“But you can’t bear to see her sad?”

“...Mm.”

“The Bai family has been looking for you for more than 10 years. They finally found you.”
