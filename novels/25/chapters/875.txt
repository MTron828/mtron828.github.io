Chapter 876: Everyone Kicks a Man Who’s Down

Those scandals were more complete and explosive than the ones he found. They could even kill Huang Yilin.

He got someone to investigate who released them.

But even after his men investigated for a long time, they still couldn’t find out who the culprit was.

The only thing he was clear about was that the person behind all this must be helping Qiao Mianmian.

Huang Yilin must have known that the person behind this was helping Qiao Mianmian.

Hence, she was definitely up to no good today.

She was definitely here to cause trouble for Qiao Mianmian.

Tu Yilei was worried that it wouldn’t be safe for her to go over now.

Qiao Mianmian thought about it too.Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

She knew very well why Huang Yilin was exposed.

After those scandals were exposed, the hot searches hadn’t been taken down yet.

Moreover, the account that exposed the news today had some new scandals. It could be said that Huang Yilin’s persona was completely destroyed.

There was no way to clean it up.

No matter how many fans she had, it was useless.

As the evidence was sufficient, the videos were also very clear. Moreover, not only were there videos and audio as evidence, but some so-called peers also opened their accounts to expose a lot of Huang Yilin’s scandals.

For example, she used her status as the top female artiste in the company to bully newbies.

Also, she’d slept with many young hunks in the industry, and even an underaged one.

Many people in the industry didn’t like Huang Yilin.

But before she got into trouble, no one could touch her easily.

Hence, no one dared to provoke her, afraid that she would retaliate.

But it was different now.

Anyone could tell that the person who messed with Huang Yilin must have a powerful background.

Otherwise, Huang Yilin would have gotten someone to suppress the negative news a long time ago. She wouldn’t have been at the top of Weibo’s trending list until now.

She’d obviously offended someone she shouldn’t have.

This time, no one could help her. She would probably crumble.

Everyone kicks a man who is down.

Previously, no one dared to offend her because of the power behind her. Now that she was about to die, who would be afraid of her?

In an instant, many of the so-called small accounts in the industry appeared on Weibo.

In any case, Huang Yilin’s scandals came one after another. The hot topics were endless 24 hours a day. Although it wasn’t completely cold yet, it wouldn’t be long before it was completely so.

Now that she was in this state, the advertisement contracts she signed were probably going to be terminated.

And because of her, she had to pay for it.

Huang Yilin signed all sorts of big-name endorsement deals, and each termination fee was at least tens of millions. If she compensated them one by one, she could lose everything she had.

She must be living a terrible life now.

If the dirt was related to Qiao Mianmian.

She must be here to find trouble with her.

Qiao Mianmian knew the seriousness of the matter and nodded. “Mm, I got it.”

“Then, stay here for now. I’ll go over and take a look.” Tu Yilei turned around and was about to leave. But after taking two steps, he turned back and reminded her again, “Remember, don’t go over first. I’ll go and see what’s going on.”

After reminding her again, Tu Yilei turned and left.

...

Qiao Mianmian stood there for more than 10 minutes. Just as she was wondering if Huang Yilin had left, she suddenly heard footsteps approaching.
