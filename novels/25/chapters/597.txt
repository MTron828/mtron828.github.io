Chapter 598: Someone Was Trying to Defame Her

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“I understand. But I was worried that you might fall prey to his sweet talk and get back with him. You have a long history with him, after all.”

“So what if I have a long history with him? An unreliable person will remain unreliable. Time won’t change that. I must have been blind to date him back then. Now that I know what kind of person he is, do you think I’ll get back together with him?

“It doesn’t matter if Mo Yesi and I will stay together as a couple. It’s impossible for Su Ze and I to get back together.”

She wasn’t sure why.

As she realized there was a possibility that Mo Yesi and her would break up, she felt heartbroken.

As she hung up the phone, Qiao Mianmian logged onto Weibo.

As she refreshed her browser, she saw that an entertainment account had reposted the post that defamed her.

It was just as Jiang Luoli said. The original was posted by a “common netizen” who claimed that she was a fan of Qiao Anxin. The fan had created the post as she was furious that her idol got cheated on.

The original post even had some photos that showed Su Ze getting physical with her.

It looked as though their relationship was beyond friends.

The other photos showed Su Ze kneeling down and begging for forgiveness from her using the diamond ring.

Qiao Mianmian examined the original post again. After that, she was sure that someone was trying to defame her.

Because, if this fan was really there, she would have known that Su Ze was rejected by Qiao Anxin.

She would have also known that it was Su Ze clinging onto Qiao Mianmian.

However, the post on Weibo portrayed a completely different picture. There was no mention that Qiao Mianmian rejected Su Ze.

It purposely portrayed her as a third party that interfered with the relationship.

She then clicked onto the comment section. It was just as Jiang Luoli described. The comments were mostly written by bots.

The person that wanted to sabotage her actually paid for bots to write defamatory comments about her.

All the comments in the comment section were trying to insult her.

They exposed her Weibo account as well.

Qiao Mianmian had never verified her real-life identity when she registered for Weibo.

Further, she was just a nobody in the industry.

Hence, not many people followed her Weibo.

But someone had managed to expose her account.

She found out as she saw that one of her latest posts suddenly had thousands of comments.

The comments were mostly scolding her for interfering with the relationship of others.

Qiao Mianmian read a few of the comments and tapped away immediately.

Just as she was trying to come out with a solution, her phone rang.

It was from Linda.

Linda was her manager now. Qiao Mianmian thought that she must have called when she saw the defamatory post.

She had generated such negative publicity after signing the contract.

Qiao Mianmian felt bad about it.

Even though it was because someone wanted to sabotage her.

But such publicity would definitely affect the celebrity.

Qiao sighed and picked up the call.

“Mianmian, what’s with the news online?” Linda asked directly. “Are you and Su Ze really...”

Linda was aware of their relationship. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Hence, she was shocked when she saw the news.

Worried, she immediately called Qiao Mianmian.

Qiao Mianmian knew her concern the moment she heard her question.
