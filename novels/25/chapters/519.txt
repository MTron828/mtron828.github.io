Chapter 520: I Don’t Care What You Heard, Just Forget All of It

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

No matter how down and out the Qiao family might be, she was going to be a thousand times better than a child from the orphanage.

But if Qiao Mianmian’s background was better than hers too, then she’d have lost in that one aspect she thought she was superior in.

How could she accept this?

Seeing how angry and menacing she looked, Father Qiao’s voice went cold. “This has nothing to do with you. I don’t care what you heard, just forget all of it. Don’t bring it up ever again.”

The more he defended Qiao Mianmian, the more jealous Qiao Anxin got. She bit her lip and said, “Why can’t I bring it up? Are her biological parents murderers or what? Is that why her past is so shameful?”

“Shut up! She’s your sister, a child of the Qiao family. If I hear such nonsense from you again, I won’t let you off.” Father Qiao was agitated.

“Dad, you’re biased.” Qiao Anxin growled. “I’m the biological daughter here. What’s so good about Qiao Mianmian? Why do you treat that feral child better than your flesh and blood, why!”

Upon hearing the words “feral child,” Father Qiao lost his cool and raised his arm, ready to give her a tight slap. But when he saw how pale she looked, he remembered that she was still a patient.

He took a deep breath and put his arm down. “She’s your sister, not a feral child. You have the cheek to ask me why? If you hadn’t shamelessly taken Su Ze from her, would she have had to break up with him?

“If she hadn’t broken up with Su Ze, she’d surely marry into the Su family. Su Ze’s parents have always liked her and seen her as their daughter-in-law already. Now that this has happened, Su Ze might have other ideas, and his parents might not accept you.

“If he really decides to break up with you, you can cry all you want.” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Father Qiao was heaving in anger as he spoke.

“Brother Ah Ze doesn’t like her anymore, what has that to do with me?” Qiao Anxin’s eyes were red as she grumbled. “She’s incapable. She can’t even keep a man by her side. That’s not my problem. If Brother Ah Ze really loved her, there was no way anyone could have taken him away from her.”

Father Qiao’s hands shook as he pointed a finger at her. “Ridiculous! Shameless!”

Qiao Anxin sneered as tears rolled down her cheek. “I’m speaking the truth. Even if I hadn’t come along, there’d be other women. If I’m the one with Brother Ah Ze, at least I can ensure that no one else benefits. I’d still be able to keep the interests of the Qiao family.

“Dad, since you think I’m shameless and have let Sister down, why won’t you let me break up with Su Ze? At the end of the day, you’re afraid that our family will be in shambles if I break up with him. If that’s the case, then Qiao Mianmian isn’t all that important to you too. Your interests outweigh anything.”

“You...”

“Stop fighting.” Lin Huizhen held Qiao Anxin close and looked toward Father Qiao with a pained expression. “Old Master, Anxin just regained consciousness, and she’s still unwell from her miscarriage. Can’t you just go easy on your daughter?”
