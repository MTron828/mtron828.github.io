Chapter 1908: Slapped in the Face

“Not here?” Qiao Mianmian was stunned again.

“Mm, I don’t want to sleep here.” Mo Yesi opened the suitcase and was already helping her pack. “We’ll go to Ning City. It’ll be convenient for you to go to the airport tomorrow.”

“But can we do this? Should we apply for leave from the production team?”

“Of course you can do that. I’m now the biggest sponsor of your variety show. Everything I say works.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

Alright, although his words were a little arrogant, he was indeed the biggest sponsor now.

Who would dare to disobey him?

Mo Yesi was quick, and Qiao Mianmian didn’t bring much luggage with her. In half an hour, she was done packing.

Mo Yesi dragged the luggage with one hand and held Qiao Mianmian’s hand with the other.

After coming out, he bumped into Zhan Bo, Su Mufei, and the others.

Usually, they would greet Qiao Mianmian immediately.

But this time, the two of them just stood where they were and had no intention of going forward to greet her.

It wasn’t that they didn’t want to greet her.

But when they were about to, they were stopped by a cold and unfriendly gaze.

The man’s eyes seemed to be saying, “Do not approach us.”

His body was also filled with the same cold aura.

Although he didn’t say anything, just his eyes were enough to make people feel pressured.

It was probably a kind of powerful aura that a person who had been in a high position for a long time would naturally possess. Ordinary people would involuntarily feel fear upon seeing it.

Mo Yesi led Qiao Mianmian away before they started discussing softly.

“Is that Qiao Mianmian’s boyfriend? He doesn’t seem like a good-tempered person.”

“I heard he’s a young master from a wealthy family. It’s normal for him to have a temper.”

“Don’t you guys feel that her boyfriend seems to be a little hostile toward us? That look just now was really scary. But honestly, he’s quite handsome. I thought he was a rich man with ordinary looks, but I didn’t expect him to be so good-looking.”

The others agreed with this point.

Qiao Mianmian’s boyfriend was indeed good-looking.

As men, they all thought that her boyfriend was quite good-looking.

Behind them.

A few women from the staff were also discussing softly.

“Wow, Qiao Mianmian’s boyfriend is so handsome and has such a good figure. He’s also very charismatic.”

“Qiao Mianmian is also very beautiful. She and her boyfriend are really a combination made in heaven. Her boyfriend is like a clear stream among the rich second-generation heirs. Finally, not a combination of beauty and a beast.”

“Her boyfriend treats her very well. I feel like he has been holding her hand the whole time. He even helped her carry her luggage.”

“Shouldn’t a boyfriend help his girlfriend carry her luggage?”

“I just think that her boyfriend is willing to do this because he likes her a lot. When Han Jiajia went out with her husband, he didn’t help her carry her luggage. In comparison, I think Qiao Mianmian’s boyfriend is really good to her.” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“If he’s not good to her, why would he come all the way here to see her? To be honest, I’m so envious of Qiao Mianmian. Her boyfriend is handsome, rich, and treats her so well. But I can’t be envious. We’re not as good-looking as her.”

“I heard that when her boyfriend first came over today, Qiao Anxin even tried to curry favor with him. But now that she’s been slapped in the face, it’s quite funny.”
