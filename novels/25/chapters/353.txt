Chapter 354: Naked Seduction!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“There’s no problem. It’s just that Chen Chen is in a bad mood. Will he be willing to go out with us? I don’t know how he’s doing now.”

“He has to go out for a walk since he’s in a bad mood.”

After entering the locker room, Mo Yesi carried her to the single sofa at the side, before gently putting her down.

He turned and walked to the closet and took out a shirt and trousers from inside.

Glancing up, she saw that the shirt and trousers in his hand were all black again. She couldn’t help but say, “Do you only have black shirts and pants in your closet? Don’t you have other colors?”

Mo Yesi liked wearing black shirts and trousers.

Qiao Mianmian had glanced into his closet just now and saw mostly black clothes.

Although she still thought he looked good in black shirts and trousers, in an enticing and sexy way, wasn’t it too much to wear dull and monotonous clothing every day?

He had taken this outfit out to change into it.

Hearing this, he pondered again, before putting the shirt and trousers back in their original spot.

Then, he changed into a white shirt and black trousers.

“How’s this outfit?” He turned around and asked with the clothes in his hand.

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

She thought... they looked about the same.

She realized that the color of his clothes was particularly monotonous, as if only in black and white.

Just like his bedroom decoration, there were only three colors: black, white, and gray.

She wanted to say that it was identical, but after glancing at his faintly expectant eyes while waiting for her comment, she thought about it and changed her tune. “It’s not bad.”

“Okay. This outfit, then.”

With her affirmation, he reached out to untie his bathrobe, then picked up the fine white shirt to put it on. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

As the bathrobe fell, it revealed his strong and slender body. This man’s proportion was particularly good. His limbs were slender and strong, the muscles on his waist and abdomen powerful, and the V-line extending down. Further down was the place that induced fanciful thoughts.

Wrapped in tight black underwear, that place was particularly eye-catching.

Qiao Mianmian only glanced at it and felt her heart beat faster and her face grow hot.

She was very clear how scary he was there.

Whenever she helped him with her hand... she couldn’t even hold it...

It wasn’t her first time seeing him naked.

But every time she looked at him, she felt like a deer caught in headlights. Her face felt hot, and she felt a sense of seduction.

He clearly wasn’t doing anything.

But by showing off his sexy body full of male hormones in front of her, wasn’t it pure seduction!

This was naked seduction!

“Mo Yesi, what are you doing?” Blushing, her eyes darted around, and she said shyly, “Why don’t you tell me before you change your clothes?”

Even though they were husband and wife and had done intimate stuff before, she still couldn’t calmly face his undressing in front of her.

After all, this man’s body was too good and sexy.

She felt like he was deliberately trying to seduce her.

She almost couldn’t control herself just now. Her mind was overwhelmed with the desire to reach out to touch his chest and abdominal muscles.

Such thoughts made her feel like a pervert.

As Mo Yesi buttoned his shirt up, his chest was still half-exposed and his muscles faintly discernible, making him even more sexy and attractive.
