Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Mo Yesi didn’t care if Qiao Mianmian agreed. He took the cell phone and handed it to the housemaid.

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

Alright. Anyway, there was no rule that she had to do the live stream herself.

It was the same for others.

Qiao Mianmian walked over and said a few words to the housemaid before walking hand in hand with Mo Yesi to the dining room.

The crew was eating in another dining room.

Hence, only Mo Yesi and Qiao Mianmian were in this dining room.

A sumptuous breakfast was already on the table.

There was Western and Chinese food. This was because Qiao Mianmian and Mo Yesi had different tastes and habits. Mo Yesi had been overseas for many years and was used to Western food, but Qiao Mianmian wasn’t used to it. To her, eating soy milk, fried dough sticks, and eggs in the morning was the most suitable.

Hence, Chinese food was made according to her taste.

Of course, besides these, there were also her favorite pastries and fruits.

These were all things Mo Yesi didn’t like to eat. Before he was with Qiao Mianmian, Mo Yesi never had these on his table.

The housemaid followed them into the dining room.

Everyone watching the broadcast swallowed their saliva when they saw the sumptuous food on the table.

Damn, wasn’t this breakfast too tempting?

There were only two of them, but the table was full.

Could they finish it?

The steak was freshly fried, right? The meat looked especially good, so tender and delicious.

There were also a few side dishes and a bowl of steaming seafood porridge.

And those cakes, biscuits, fruit juice, milk, and so many fruits...

Everything looked delicious.

Most importantly, there were only two of them at such a huge table!

This was too extravagant.

“Wow, is this what rich people eat in the morning? How can two people eat so much?” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“I definitely can’t finish it. I don’t mind eating leftovers. Can you pack the leftovers for me!!!”

“I don’t mind eating leftovers! Boohoo, I like that steak. I want to take a bite. It must taste really good!”

“Then, I’ll give you the steak. I prefer the dishes and seafood porridge. I like porridge in the morning.”

“Am I the only one who thinks that this is too extravagant? Do two people need to do so much? Can they finish it? If they can’t finish it, won’t they have to throw it away? I feel heartache when I think about how there are so many children in the mountains who can’t even eat their fill. I hate such wasteful behavior.”

“Everyone, be careful. A moral b*tch has appeared again. I really hate people who like moral coercion so much. If you pity the children in the mountains, donate more. Why are you trying to coerce others?”

“That’s right. She cares so much about the children in the mountains.”

People started arguing in the comment section again because of the sumptuous breakfast.

Of course, Qiao Mianmian couldn’t see this.

At this point, the number of viewers in the live stream had surpassed three million.

...

The production crew was paying attention to the statistics of the live stream. Initially, everyone thought that many people were either sleeping or busy waking up to go to the office early in the morning, so not many people would have the time to watch it.

Hence, the production crew initially estimated that not many people would watch the live stream this morning.
