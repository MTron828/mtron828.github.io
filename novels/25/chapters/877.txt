Her lips quivered. “You don’t have to know who he is. In any case, you just have to know that he’s someone who can easily destroy us.”

Tu Yilei frowned slightly. Seeing that she wasn’t willing to tell him, he didn’t continue asking.

“Why are you looking for Qiao Mianmian?”

“I’ve said it before, I’m not here to find trouble with her.” Huang Yilin’s expression darkened, and she said unhappily, “Now, I just want to beg her to let me live. Tu Yilei, you’re just like me, you’ve gone from a nobody newbie to where you are today. So, you can definitely understand how I feel, right? I can’t lose everything I have now. If my career is gone, my whole life will be gone too.”

Tu Yilei looked at her with a frown. “Yes, I can understand how you feel. But when you did those things, did you consider her feelings? If she’s just a newbie with no background, if no one is willing to help her, do you know that her career might be ruined?”

Huang Yilin was stunned for a while, and her expression turned a little awful. “You’re speaking up for her? Yes, I admit that what I did previously wasn’t very good, but that’s because she provoked me. If she was just acting in her role obediently, would I dare to hit her?”

Tu Yilei actually pitied her current situation.

Hearing that, the little bit of sympathy in his heart vanished.

He shook his head and sighed. “By provoking you, you mean that Bai Yusheng has taken a liking to her? Not to mention that her relationship with Bai Yusheng isn’t what you think it is, even if it is, it’s his freedom to like anyone. How did it become Qiao Mianmian’s fault?

“Did she force Bai Yusheng to like her?

“Why don’t you think that it’s Bai Yusheng’s fault? To put it bluntly, you just think that Qiao Mianmian is a newbie and easy to bully. So, you can only vent your anger on her.”

Huang Yilin flew into a rage. “Tu Yilei, how dare you say that you’re not interested in her? You’re always defending her and speaking up for her. When have you ever helped another female artiste like this?

“Do you think she’ll be grateful and like you just because you helped her?

“That’s right, your qualifications are really good for many women. But can you compare to the sugar daddy behind her? Tu Yilei, I advise you to give up. She’s with a man like that, she can’t possibly consider you anymore.”

“So, Miss Huang felt that I wasn’t obedient enough, that’s why she taught me a lesson. But I really want to ask you in person, what exactly did Miss Huang think I did wrong to offend you?”

Huang Yilin’s and Tu Yilei’s expressions changed when they heard Qiao Mianmian’s voice. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Seeing her walk over, Tu Yilei frowned and immediately walked towards her.

Walking in front of her, he lowered his head and whispered disapprovingly, “Didn’t I tell you... why did you...”

Qiao Mianmian looked up at him. “Senior Tu, I thought about it just now and felt that I should settle my own matters. I can’t hide from her forever. Moreover, I didn’t do anything wrong, why should I be afraid of her?”

With that, she turned and walked towards Huang Yilin.

Seeing her, Huang Yilin’s expression changed again, and hatred flashed in her eyes.
