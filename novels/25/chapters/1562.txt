Chapter 1563: You Really Don’t Know Your Own Limits

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Linda didn’t have much hope for Qiao Mianmian.

It was too difficult.

Before coming, she’d thought that Qiao Mianmian had a chance of being chosen.

But now...

Even the best actresses were here for the audition. Qiao Mianmian’s chances of being chosen were almost zero.

Linda was a little disappointed.

This was a huge production, be it the producers, investors, directors, scriptwriters...

All the accessories were top-notch, aiming for at least a billion yuan.

Even if the female lead and second female lead weren’t fated to be Qiao Mianmian’s, it was already good enough if she could show her face for a minute or two.

But it seemed like she wouldn’t even be able to do that. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Linda felt disappointed, but she couldn’t show it to Qiao Mianmian. She could only say some words of encouragement and comfort.

Qiao Mianmian knew that her chances were slim. She nodded and said, “Mm, I’ll do my best.”

To Qiao Mianmian, she felt much more relaxed after feeling hopeless.

She wasn’t so stressed anymore.

She was here to see the world. This time, she saw many big shots and celebrities. She felt that she profited.

Qiao Mianmian’s appearance attracted a lot of attention.

Seeing that it was a new face, many people discussed it curiously. “Who is that? Why haven’t we seen her before?”

“She looks unfamiliar. Is she a newbie? But newbies won’t be able to come for today’s audition.”

“I think she looks a little familiar. I think I’ve seen her somewhere before. I remember now, she’s really a newbie. She’s the newbie that was always trending a while ago.”

“She’s really a newbie? Then, she must have a powerful background to be able to attend today’s audition.”

“I heard that she has a rich and powerful boyfriend. Her boyfriend and Young Master Gong know each other.”

“So it’s because of her connections. But it’s useless even if she has connections. Everyone knows that Director Cheng hates people with connections. She got the audition slot through connections, but whether she can succeed or not isn’t determined by her connections.”

“That’s right. Director Cheng hates those with connections the most. If she doesn’t have any acting skills, it’s useless to rely on connections.”

“Let’s wait and see. This kind of person really doesn’t have any self-awareness. Does she think she can get the role just because of her connections? What a joke.”

Qiao Anxin was also in the audition crowd.

When she saw Qiao Mianmian, she was stunned for a moment before smiling mockingly.

She slowly walked towards her. “Qiao Mianmian, you’re so nice to come up. Do you see now? The worst artiste here is a B-list celebrity. Don’t you feel anxious standing here?

“How much hope do you think you have?

“You really don’t have any self-awareness.”

Qiao Mianmian glanced at her and smiled. “If you dare to come, why wouldn’t I dare? I don’t know how much hope I have of being chosen, but I know you definitely don’t have any.

“But it doesn’t matter. It’s not bad to have one or two more people.”

“You!” Qiao Anxin’s face turned green.

“Miss Qiao, please follow me. Your audition is the first. It’ll start in five minutes.”
