“Mm.” Mo Yesi nodded. “I have the right to make this decision. How is it? Do you like this birthday gift?”

Qiao Chen’s fingers trembled.

A few seconds later, he looked up and said excitedly, “I like it, I really like it. I really like this birthday gift. Thank you, Brother-in-law.”

It was obvious that Qiao Chen preferred the letter Mo Yesi gave him.

Qiao Mianmian was curious. What did Mo Yesi give Qiao Chen?

He was so happy.

It was obvious that Qiao Chen was really happy. He even smiled brightly.

At this moment, Qiao Chen looked like the carefree and happy young man from before.

“As long as you like it.”

Qiao Chen kept the letter and held it tightly in his hand.

This made Qiao Mianmian even more curious.

She nudged Mo Yesi with her elbow and looked up at him. “What did you give Chen Chen? You made him so happy.”

“You want to know?”

“Of course I want to know.” Qiao Mianmian pursed her lips and said, a little jealous, “He wasn’t this happy with the watch. As his brother-in-law, what surprise did you prepare for him?”

“I’ll tell you later.” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Old Madam was happy to see the juniors getting along so well.

To her, harmony was the best.

But the moment she thought of Madam Mo, who hadn’t returned yet, Old Madam’s mood was affected.

At this moment, a housemaid came over.

The housemaid looked at them and said, “Old Madam, Madam is back.”

The happy atmosphere froze for a few seconds. The conversation stopped. Old Madam frowned and turned to look at the housemaid. “Madam is back?”

“Yes.”

Old Madam couldn’t help but sneer. “She still knows to come back.”

“Old Madam.” The housemaid hesitated for a while before saying, “Madam didn’t come back alone.”

“She didn’t come back alone?” Old Madam was stunned. “Did she bring someone back?”

“There’s another lady with Madam.”

“What lady? Is it someone we know?”

“That lady looks unfamiliar. She hasn’t been here before.”

Old Madam frowned again.

Qiao Mianmian saw Madam Mo walking out of the lobby.

She didn’t come back alone.

She was accompanied by a young woman who looked to be about 24 or 25 years old. She wasn’t very beautiful, but she had a good temperament and was dressed very well.

She looked like a rich girl.

Madam Mo chatted with the woman as she walked with a smile on her face.

Madam Mo saw Old Madam sitting on the sofa and then looked at Qiao Mianmian and Qiao Chen. Her smile faded.

She stopped in her tracks and looked at Old Madam. “Mom.”

The woman beside her stopped too.

Old Madam looked at Madam Mo and then at the woman standing beside her. Although she was angry, she suppressed it when she thought about Qiao Chen’s birthday.
