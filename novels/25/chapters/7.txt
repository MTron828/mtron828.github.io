Chapter 8: Changing the Ward

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Everything had been fine.

However, at the sports meeting on Qiao Chen’s third year of high school, he had fainted all of a sudden in the running competition.

Then it was discovered that he had congenital heart disease.

This disease was very dangerous once it struck. He was in shock today and almost couldn’t be rescued.

Qiao Chen saw that she was worried and his pale lips rose in a slight smile. He reached out and patted her on the back of the hand, pretending to be relaxed. “I’m really fine, don’t you think I’m fine now?”

“Chen Chen, you...”

Qiao Mianmian’s eyes were red and she was about to say something when the door of the ward was pushed open.

A group of doctors and nurses came in.

Qiao Mianmian recognized the person in front. It was the vice president of the hospital.

She looked at the group of people in shock and frowned slightly. “You...”

“Ms. Qiao, we are here to change Mr. Qiao’s ward.”

The vice president was very polite and was even respectful.

Qiao Mianmian was surprised again. Her heart skipped a beat and her expression changed. “Change the ward? Where?”

It seemed like the Qiao family already knew about her break up with Su Ze.

Father Qiao had been unwilling to treat Qiao Chen initially. He thought that it was a waste of money to spend money on treating his incurable illness.

But since she was engaged to Su Ze, he didn’t dare to make a big fuss.

Now that she and Su Ze had broken up, naturally, he didn’t have to worry about anything anymore.

Oh, this was reality.

Qiao Mianmian felt both angry and sad. Sometimes, she really doubted whether she and Qiao Chen had been adopted from outside, and Qiao Anxin was Father Qiao’s real daughter.

The vice present said, “Mr. Qiao has suffered staying in this ward. We will transfer him to the VIP ward immediately, and then arrange the most professional medical team to treat Mr. Qiao.”

After speaking, the vice president commanded. “Hurry and send Mr. Qiao to the VIP ward.”

Qiao Mianmian didn’t expect this outcome.

Her eyes widened in surprise and she stared at the vice president.

Qiao Chen, lying on the bed, was also puzzled. He whispered, “Sister, what’s going on?”

Qiao Mianmian blinked, her face blank. “I don’t know...”

The condition of the VIP ward was much better than that of the ordinary ward.

It was a room for one person, and there was also a set.

There was a bedroom, a living room, a kitchen and a bathroom in the ward. It could be described as fully equipped. Opening the windows, a large green scenery could be seen outside.

The smell of sterilizing water did not permeate the air, a faint pleasant fragrance could be smelled instead. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“Ms. Qiao, Mr. Qiao, are you satisfied?” The vice president bowed his head respectfully. “If you have any dissatisfaction, we will fix it immediately.”

Qiao Mianmian: “... we are very satisfied, thank you!”

The vice president looked relieved. “That’s good. Then, we won’t disturb your rest. If you need anything, press the service bell, and someone will come to serve you soon.”

After the vice president left with the group of doctors and nurses, Qiao Chen looked around and was surprised. “Sister, why did they change me to such a good ward? Is it my brother-in-law’s arrangement?”
