Chapter 1465: I Won’t Let Myself Suffer a Loss

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Otherwise, how could he and Mo Yesi be biological brothers?

Growing up in the same environment and having the same blood, how could his personality be different?

It was just that Mo Shixiu was older than Mo Yesi by a few years and had such a job, so he looked more mature and reserved.

But the brothers were essentially similar in many ways.

Hence, even if Jiang Luoli really agreed to leave Mo Shixiu, he wouldn’t let her go easily.

Qiao Mianmian thought of Madam Mo’s personality and frowned. She sent Jiang Luoli another message: [Luo Luo, send me the address when you get there. Call me immediately if anything happens.]

She felt that Madam Mo wouldn’t do anything to Jiang Luoli.

No matter how unhappy she was with Jiang Luoli, she wouldn’t do anything openly.

She reminded Jiang Luoli just in case.

Jiang Luoli replied quickly: [Mm, I know. Don’t worry, I won’t let myself suffer.]

Qiao Mianmian looked at her reply and was a little worried.

Jiang Luoli wasn’t a pushover.

But Madam Mo wasn’t a simple character.

...

Jiang Luoli changed her clothes and was about to leave. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

On the weekend, she didn’t stay in school like before. Instead, she stayed with Mo Shixiu.

When she went downstairs, Sister Lin saw that she was going out and asked, “Miss Jiang, are you going out? Are you coming back for dinner?”

Jiang Luoli thought for a while and nodded. “Mm, I should be back. I’ll call you then.”

“Alright.”

Sister Lin got the chauffeur to send her off.

...

Madam Mo arranged for them to meet at a high-end clubhouse.

When Jiang Luoli got out of the car, a waiter came forward and asked, “Miss Jiang?”

Jiang Luoli looked at the waiter and nodded. “Yes.”

“Please follow me.” The waiter made an inviting gesture and led the way.

Jiang Luoli followed her into the clubhouse.

The clubhouse was huge. After walking for a few minutes, the waiter stopped outside a private room.

She bowed slightly and smiled. “Miss Jiang, Madam Mo is waiting for you inside. Please come in.”

She opened the door slightly.

Jiang Luoli stood outside for a few seconds before taking a deep breath and pushing the door open.

She saw Madam Mo sitting inside.

This was the second time Jiang Luoli saw her.

On the night of the banquet, Madam Mo was dressed elegantly.

Even though she was wearing her usual casual clothes, she still couldn’t hide her elegance.

Jiang Luoli was instinctively afraid of rich women.

The moment she saw Madam Mo, she thought of the melodramatic plot in the domineering CEO’s novel.

She was ready to be thrown a check.

“Miss Jiang, you’re here.”

Madam Mo was rather polite when she saw Jiang Luoli. She didn’t give her a hard time.

Her expression was kind.

But Jiang Luoli wasn’t stupid enough to think that Madam Mo was a kind person.

If she was really kind, she wouldn’t have asked to meet her this time.

It wasn’t like she hadn’t seen people who hid daggers in their smiles.
