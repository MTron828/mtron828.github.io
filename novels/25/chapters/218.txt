Chapter 219: Why Are You Hiding, Sister?

They might even have a divorce in the future.

After asking, Qiao Chen waited nervously for Mo Yesi’s reply.

“Wedding?” Mo Yesi repeated his words. His lips curled up and he turned to look at Qiao Mianmian. “Your brother just asked us when we will have a wedding. What do you think?”

“Uh...”

“I also think that we should arrange a wedding soon. We’ve already gotten our marriage certificate, and it seems a little unreasonable to not have a wedding.”

There was no response.

“You can think about this matter carefully, then tell me. I’ll compromise with you at any time.”

There was no response.

Qiao Mianmian was going a little crazy.

They had mentioned the wedding again.

She was completely unprepared.

“Cough, cough. Let’s talk about this when we get back.” Qiao Mianmian quickly changed the subject. She reached out to pat Qiao Chen’s shoulder and said with a smile, “Chen Chen, to celebrate your discharge from the hospital, we’ll have a big meal in the evening.

“Your brother-in-law said he will treat us. Just tell him what you want to eat.”

Qiao Chen was speechless.

He could tell now that it wasn’t his brother-in-law who didn’t want a wedding.

The person who didn’t want to have a wedding was his sister.

Qiao Chen couldn’t understand his sister.

His brother-in-law was so handsome and rich and would be worth showing off wherever.

So why was his sister hiding?

Could it be... his sister was still hung up over Su Ze, that bastard? Hence, she was refusing to hold a wedding with Brother-in-law?

At the thought of this, Qiao Chen felt like it was entirely possible.

No matter how indifferent Qiao Mianmian appeared on the surface, she had known Su Ze for many years, after all.

How could she really disregard him?

Maybe the reason why she looked for someone to marry immediately wasn’t because of his illness, but because of Su Ze.

Su Ze’s betrayal had hurt her and stimulated her...

But if this was the case, it was too unfair for his brother-in-law.

Qiao Chen immediately came to a decision to lend a hand and help his brother-in-law win his sister’s heart as soon as possible.

...

Outside the hospital.

Uncle Li was standing next to a black Rolls Royce.

Seeing Mo Yesi and the rest walking out, he immediately stepped forward and greeted respectfully. “Young Master, Young Madam.” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Then, he glanced at the young man standing beside Qiao Mianmian, a tall and slender boy with delicate and beautiful eyebrows. He bent down respectfully and greeted. “Hello, Mr. Qiao.”

Qiao Chen was taken aback at the deep bow from someone who looked much older than him.

He immediately took a step back and turned around to look at Qiao Mianmian, a little bewildered.

“This is Uncle Li.” Qiao Mianmian introduced him.

She could understand Qiao Chen’s reaction.

She had also felt very uncomfortable in the beginning and was still not completely accustomed to it now.

She felt a little uncomfortable at being called Young Madam.

“Hello, Uncle Li.” Qiao Chen greeted politely.

Uncle Li took another look at him and felt amiable towards him.

Young Madam’s brother was similar to her and had a very likable personality.

Both of them looked good.

Qiao Chen was a little thinner but was impeccable in other aspects.

Uncle Li felt like this young lad looked even better than many male stars on TV.

Although he wore ordinary clothes, he had a good temperament and exuded the image of a clean and refreshing sunny boy.

He was sure to be popular amongst girls in school.

But Young Madam’s brother didn’t look like her at all. Uncle Li guessed that she resembled their mother, while he resembled their father.
