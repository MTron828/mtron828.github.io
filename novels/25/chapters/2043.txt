This voice…

She looked down and saw Wei Zheng walking towards the stage.

Wei Zheng’s appearance shocked everyone.

The emcee on stage was also shocked.

Looking smug and thinking that she’d won, Shen Rou turned pale the moment he appeared.

Wei Zheng slowly walked onto the stage.

“Mister, you…” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

The emcee was still in a daze.

Who was this?

.

Where did he come from?

Why was he on stage?

“I’m Wei Zheng, the special assistant of the Chairman of the Mo Corporation.” Wei Zheng introduced himself as he walked towards Qiao Mianmian.

Qiao Mianmian was also confused.

When he approached, she asked, “Wei Zheng, why are you here?”

Qiao Mianmian’s first reaction was to quickly search the stage again.

Did that mean Mo Yesi was here too?

“Chairman Mo asked me to come.” Wei Zheng looked down at the stage and then up at Qiao Mianmian. He smiled and said, “Chairman Mo said that the bracelet is a love token he gave Miss Qiao. It has extraordinary meaning. Miss Qiao, you mustn’t auction it off.

“Chairman Mo is willing to donate 300 million yuan on Miss Qiao’s behalf to contribute to tonight’s charity banquet.

“Chairman Mo has already gotten someone to send the details to the charity banquet’s donation account. The relevant personnel will know after checking the accounts.”

300 million…

300 million yuan…

Everyone started discussing.

This should be the highest individual donation in so many years.

Shen Rou’s 50 million was already surprising.

And now, another 300 million.

“Miss Qiao, Chairman Mo wanted to come personally. It’s just that he had something on at the last minute and couldn’t come, so he got me to come. Chairman Mo said that he’ll come and pick Miss Qiao up after the banquet. He told Miss Qiao not to go back alone. Don’t forget that you guys have agreed to have supper together.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

“Miss Qiao, I’ll get going first.”

Wei Zheng turned around and left the stage.

Even after he left, the emcee was still a little confused.

Below stage.

Shen Rou’s expression was awful.

She felt as if someone had slapped her.

And in front of so many people.

She was extremely embarrassed and furious.

She even felt that Mo Yesi did it on purpose.

He wanted to embarrass her.

Initially, she was the one in the limelight, successfully attracting everyone’s attention.

But now, because of Wei Zheng’s appearance, because of the 300-million-yuan donation, and because of Mo Yesi’s public protection and love.

Everyone was focused on Qiao Mianmian.

Then, what had she done?

Was he setting Qiao Mianmian up?

…

In the live stream.

Wei Zheng’s appearance made the netizens uneasy.

“Am I reading a domineering CEO novel? This plot is too romantic. The female lead is about to be slapped in the face, and the male lead arranged for his assistant to save the situation. Not only did he save the female lead’s face, but he also slapped the second female lead’s face?!”

“The show is too exciting!”
