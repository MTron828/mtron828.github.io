Chapter 905: Our Master Is a Dragon Among Men

Before getting out of the car, Jiang Luoli quickly replied with an “Okay”.

She’d just sent Qiao Mianmian a message when the chauffeur opened the car door.

“Miss Jiang, please get off.”

The person who picked Jiang Luoli up this time wasn’t Assistant Xu, but Uncle Chen.

Uncle Chen was about 50 years old. Compared to Assistant Xu, he was much more polite to Jiang Luoli.

Jiang Luoli and Qiao Mianmian had the same personality.

If others treated her well, she would treat them well too.

If anyone treated her badly, she wouldn’t treat them well either.

Although it was just a short interaction, Jiang Luoli felt that Uncle Chen was a nice person. After getting off the car, she thanked him and hesitated for a few seconds before asking, “Uncle Chen, can I ask you something?”

Uncle Chen nodded. “Miss Jiang, what do you want to ask?” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Jiang Luoli hesitated for a few seconds before asking, “Your master... isn’t too old, right?”

She thought about how she felt that night. It must have been a young man.

And one who often exercised.

Otherwise, he wouldn’t have so many muscles.

But she still wanted to find out more about him before meeting him.

She didn’t want him to be too different from what she imagined.

Uncle Chen was stunned for a moment before laughing out loud. “Miss Jiang, don’t worry. Mister is in his prime. He’s a young and promising young man, not old at all.”

Jiang Luoli felt a little more at ease.

At least it wasn’t an old man.

“Then... how does he look?”

As long as he wasn’t too ugly, she... could accept it.

Although she was obsessed with looks, she really hoped that the man she had a moment with that night would be a super hunk. It would be best if she fell in love with him at first sight.

But she didn’t think she’d be so lucky.

Uncle Chen was stunned again. After a few seconds of silence, his smile widened. “Miss Jiang, you can rest assured. Our Sir...”

Uncle Chen paused for a while and seemed to be thinking about how to describe him. “Our Sir is a dragon among men. He’s one in a million. Miss Jiang will know when she sees him later. All the women who have seen our Sir are attracted to him.”

Jiang Luoli was a little worried after hearing Uncle Chen’s words.

He was one in a million.

And every woman who saw him was attracted to him.

This was too exaggerated.

She felt that Uncle Chen was using his subordinates as a filter. He felt that his boss was the most handsome man in the world. Hence, no matter how ugly that man was, he was still a super hunk in his subordinate’s eyes.

Whenever a woman saw his boss, he would feel that she was attracted to him.

But in fact, that man might be an ugly freak.

Jiang Luoli’s heart sank.

She didn’t expect that man to be a super hunk.

But at least she wasn’t an ugly girl.

Her first time was for someone she liked.

Uncle Chen knew that she didn’t believe him.

Not saying anything, he just said, “Miss Jiang, Mister is already waiting for you. Let’s go.”

They were already there.

Jiang Luoli had no choice but to follow him.
