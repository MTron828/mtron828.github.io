Chapter 882: Don’t You Think You’ve Hurt Him Enough!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Are you blind! I wasn’t the one who hurt him, it was Qiao Mianmian!” Huang Yilin’s eyes were filled with hatred as she looked at Qiao Mianmian indignantly. “If it wasn’t for him standing in front of this slut, this slut’s face would have been ruined. Since he wants to be a busybody, he deserves it!”

“Take her away, take her away!” Michael was shaking with anger. “I don’t want to see this crazy woman again. Take her away immediately.”

The security officers dragged Huang Yilin away.

“Little Tu Tu, bear with it. We’ll go to the hospital immediately.” Michael looked at the back of Tu Yilei’s hand, which was corroded by sulfuric acid. His tears fell uncontrollably, and his face was full of heartache. “How could this happen. I wasn’t around for a while, how did you end up like this?

“You silly boy, if that acid was splashed on your face, do you know that your life would be over?

“Why don’t you consider the consequences of your actions? If anything happens to you, what do you want me to do? Tu Yilei, I’ve spent so much time and money to get you to where you are today. Shouldn’t you at least consider it for me?

“Am I not important to you at all?”

Michael cried his eyes out. It was very different from his usual shrewd and capable image.

He was really scared.

His heart ached.

He was so anxious that he didn’t care about his image.

Qiao Mianmian knew that Tu Yilei was hurt because of her, and she felt so guilty.

Her eyes reddened as she looked at the back of his hand.

She wanted to ask him.

Ask him how he was doing.

Ask him... if it hurt a lot.

But just as she took a step towards Tu Yilei, Michael turned around and glared at her. “Don’t come over! It’s all because of you that Little Tu got injured and ended up in such a terrible state. Why are you still here?

“Don’t you think you’ve hurt him enough!

“If it wasn’t for you, Little Tu wouldn’t have been injured at all.”

Qiao Mianmian froze.

She looked into Michael’s angry eyes and said, “I’m sorry.”

“Sorry!” Michael said angrily. “What’s the point of apologizing? Look at what you’ve done to Little Tu. Do you know how badly his hand is injured?

“Many of the endorsements he signed have to be redressed. If his hand... what’s the point of saying sorry!!

“Qiao Mianmian, Little Tu is in trouble this time!” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“That’s enough, Michael.” The burn on the back of Tu Yilei’s hand was obviously very painful. His face was much paler, and a cold sweat broke out on his forehead. He endured the pain and said hoarsely, “Don’t blame Miss Qiao, this has nothing to do with her. I was the one who wanted to do this, she didn’t do anything wrong.”

Michael was red with anger. “You’re still defending her even at this point. How could it have nothing to do with her? You were the one who took the hit for her. The acid should’ve been on her.

“If it wasn’t for her, would you be injured?”

The silver lining was that Tu Yilei’s face wasn’t hurt.
