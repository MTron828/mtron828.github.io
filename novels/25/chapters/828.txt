Chapter 829: What’s Wrong With You? Are You Angry With Me?

But she was married to his best buddy.

What else could he do?

Was he going to destroy their brotherhood?

Moreover, he knew too well that he couldn’t win against Mo Yesi.

He and Mo Yesi were essentially the same type of people.

They were possessive.

They would never give others a chance to snatch something they cared about.

In front of others, he had absolute confidence.

But in front of Mo Yesi, he had to admit that this was a very threatening opponent.

He might not be able to win against him. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Otherwise, Shen Rou wouldn’t have been so devoted to Mo Yesi.

No matter how well she treated him, he never wavered.

An hour later.

Gong Zeli sent Qiao Ruhai off.

He sat alone in the pavilion for a long time. Finally, he took out his cell phone and called Shen Rou.

“Rourou, let’s meet up now. Where are you? I’ll pick you up.”

...

At the agreed place.

The waiter led Gong Zeli to a private room and said respectfully, “Young Master Gong, Miss Shen is drinking alone inside. She ordered a lot of drinks. We tried to persuade her, but she refused to listen to us.

“You’re here at the right time. Come in and take a look at her. We’re really worried that something might happen to her.”

Gong Zeli stood outside the private room for a few seconds before pushing the door open.

The lights in the private room were dim.

Shen Rou was leaning against the sofa with a wine glass in her hand.

She looked up when she heard the door open and saw Gong Zeli walking in. She smiled and raised her glass to toast him. “Zeli, you’re here. Come and have a drink with me. I’m bored drinking alone.”

Gong Zeli closed the door and walked towards her.

“Why are you drinking alone?”

Although the truth was out, Gong Zeli’s attitude was still the same.

He walked towards Shen Rou and looked down at her for a few seconds before taking the wine glass away.

“It’s not good to drink too much. It won’t solve anything.”

“What are you doing?”

Shen Rou furrowed her brows and got up to snatch the wine glass. “Give it back to me. I can drink it if I want to. It’s none of your business.”

“Yeah, it’s none of my business.”

Gong Zeli smiled. The thought of the woman he doted on and pampered all these years lying to him was ridiculous.

But who could he blame?

Even if Shen Rou lied to him, it had nothing to do with his brain.

He knew very well that he didn’t have feelings for Shen Rou. He had wondered why, but he never thought that he might have gotten the wrong person.

He never thought that Shen Rou would lie to him.

He deserved it for being lied to for so many years.

“Gong Zeli, aren’t you annoying?” Shen Rou reached out to grab the wine glass and said unhappily, “I asked you to come over because I want you to drink with me. If you’re unwilling, then don’t hinder me.

“You know, I hate being controlled by others.”

“Mm, I know.” This time, Gong Zeli didn’t stop her.

Shen Rou successfully snatched the wine glass back.

She then looked up at him and frowned. “What’s wrong? Are you angry with me?”
