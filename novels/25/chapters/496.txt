Chapter 497: I’ll Belong to Only You for the Rest of My Life

“Yes, Young Master.”

Qiao Mianmian wanted to object to it but felt that it was best not to for now.

She wasn’t busy, anyway.

She didn’t mind following him to his office, as long as she wouldn’t be a bother.

...

At the Mo Corporation.

Mo Yesi took her straight to his office on the 37th floor.

They walked out of the elevator hand in hand. Some of the female secretaries widened their eyes so much, their eyeballs almost fell out of their sockets.

Some of their jaws dropped, and they only snapped out of their shock and greeted “Chairman Mo” when Mo Yesi walked past them.

Mo Yesi didn’t even give them a second look. He brought Qiao Mianmian to his office.

It was Qiao Mianmian who looked at the female secretaries around. When they reached his office, she asked casually, “Are all of them your secretaries?”

“Mm, why?”

Mo Yesi didn’t let go of her hand even after they entered the office.

It was summer.

Qiao Mianmian could feel the sweat on her palm and wasn’t so inclined to hold his hand for so long. But Mo Yesi didn’t seem to feel it.

“Nothing much. I just find all of them rather pretty.”

Qiao Mianmian meant it from the bottom of her heart.

In all honesty, the employees at the Mo Corporation all looked pretty good.

The few female secretaries outside were all at least 1.65m tall, and each of them was fair and slim.

Mo Yesi suddenly turned to look at her. “If you don’t like it, I’ll get the HR department to dismiss them right away.”

Qiao Mianmian was slightly confused.

She said, “Why wouldn’t I like it? And why would you dismiss them for no reason?”

Mo Yesi narrowed his eyes. “You just said they were pretty.”

“Yup, I do find them pretty. What’s wrong with that?”

“You’re not saying that you mind it?”

“... No.” Qiao Mianmian looked at how serious he was and quickly explained herself. “I just think they look nice, and that every employee in the Mo Corporation is pleasant-looking.

“I really don’t mind it. Really, I swear!”

She was afraid that Mo Yesi would get the wrong idea and dismiss his workers who’d done nothing wrong at all.

She would’ve had to bear the responsibility of their unemployment, then.

Mo Yesi looked at her for a while more to make sure that she really didn’t mind it. He then smiled and said, “Since you don’t mind it, then alright, I won’t dismiss them. But, you really aren’t worried at all? Are you not afraid that I won’t be able to resist temptations?”

He felt oddly annoyed at that fact.

How could she not be worried about him having other ideas?

She just wasn’t worried at all?

This time, Qiao Mianmian could tell that he was overthinking things again. After thinking for a bit, she hurriedly said, “I’m not, because I trust you.”

She held his hand tight and looked deep into his eyes. “I know you’re not that sort of person, so I have faith in you.

“If I don’t even trust you, how could I be your wife.”

Mo Yesi was a little stunned by her response, but his lips soon curled up.

He hugged her and planted a kiss on her forehead. “Baby, I’ll belong to only you for the rest of my life. My body and my heart are yours alone.”
