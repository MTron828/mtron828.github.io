Chapter 3015 Accompanied Her for a Week

Qiao Mianmian was hospitalized a week before her due date.

This week, Mo Yesi pushed away everything and handed most of the company’s matters to Wei Zheng and the Vice President. If there was anything especially important, he would get Wei Zheng to send the contract to the hospital for him to handle personally.

Qiao Mianmian stayed in the hospital for a week.

Mo Yesi accompanied for a week.

Before Qiao Mianmian gave birth, she was still arguing with Mo Yesi that she wanted spicy crayfish and she wanted him to buy it for her. She kept pestering him and in the end, Mo Yesi had no choice but to agree.

Just as she was about to get some crayfish, Qiao Mianmian suddenly yelled that her stomach hurt.

Already prepared, Mo Yesi forced himself to calm down and called for the doctor and nurse.

Qiao Mianmian was staying in the VIP ward. The medical team had been on standby for the past few days to serve her alone. Soon, the doctor and nurse came over to check on her condition. After confirming that she was about to give birth, they quickly helped her into the delivery room.

The door closed.

Mo Yesi stood outside and stared at the tightly shut door. He was so nervous that his palms were sweaty.

The best doctors were in the delivery room. Although he knew that nothing could go wrong, he couldn’t help but feel nervous. His palms were sweating, and his heart was in a mess. He couldn’t wait to rush into the delivery room.

If Qiao Mianmian hadn’t told him in advance that she wasn’t willing to let him accompany her in the delivery room, Mo Yesi would have really rushed in.

Qiao Mianmian had a natural birth.

She suggested it herself.

Mo Yesi had done a lot of homework while she was pregnant. He knew that she could give birth painlessly now, and it wouldn’t hurt so much after the injection. This way, she wouldn’t suffer as much.

But no matter how much he knew and prepared, he was still nervous and worried.

It was said that women went through hell to give birth to children.

Madam Mo almost had a miscarriage when she gave birth to him.

Back then, the doctor who delivered him was also the best in the OB/GYN Department, but an accident almost happened. Mo Yesi couldn’t help but worry when he thought about it. Even though Lu Rao had repeatedly assured him that Madam Mo’s situation would never repeat itself on Qiao Mianmian. “Ah Si, don’t worry. We’ve done so many prenatal examinations for Sis-in-law. Don’t worry, everything will go smoothly.” Lu Rao rushed over when he received the news. Seeing Mo Yesi pacing back and forth outside the delivery room, he went forward and patted him on the shoulder.

“I know.” Mo Yesi frowned. “But why isn’t there any news?”

Lu Rao smiled. “What do you think?”

Mo Yesi pursed his lips and frowned. “Don’t they always scream when giving birth?” But since Qiao Mianmian entered the delivery room, it had been quiet. Not a single sound could be heard. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Mo Yesi felt even more uneasy.

Lu Rao was stunned for a while before laughing. “Ah Si, you’ve watched too many television dramas. Nowadays, almost all childbirth is painless. Sis-in-law has been given painkillers, so she won’t feel pain. Of course, she won’t yell.”
