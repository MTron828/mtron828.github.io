Chapter 2349: He Likes Her

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Just because she had gained weight, she could think of so many impossible things.

“Luoli.” Mo Shixiu smiled and looked at the woman in his arms lovingly. He said gently, “No matter what you become, I’ll still like you. It’s not a bad thing to be a little chubby. You’re quite cute.

“I won’t cheat on you, don’t think too much.”

Mo Shixiu felt that Jiang Luoli was doing well.

But he thought she was too skinny.

He wanted to tell her that her worries were unnecessary.

He liked her.

Her weight gain wouldn’t affect him at all.

Because he’d still like her no matter how fat or skinny she was.

If it wasn’t the woman he liked, he wouldn’t feel anything even if she was a top-notch beauty.

He’d been tempted a lot in the past.

If he gave in to such a temptation, he wouldn’t have come this far with her.

The man’s words didn’t comfort Jiang Luoli.

“Even if you don’t mind, I do. I don’t want to be chubby and cute. Anyway, I don’t care. From today onwards, I won’t eat supper anymore.”

“Luoli…” Mo Shixiu looked at her helplessly. “Don’t be childish. You should know that you’re not alone now. Even if you don’t want to eat it, what about the baby? ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“Even if you’re not hungry, the baby will be. Can you bear to starve our baby?”

Jiang Luoli was speechless.

Mo Shixiu was really good at controlling people.

Jiang Luoli’s determination wavered again.

“There’s really nothing bad about being a little fatter.” Mo Shixiu pinched her waist gently and coaxed her like she was a child. “Moreover, I think you’re still as good-looking as before. You haven’t changed at all.”

“No way.” Jiang Luoli didn’t believe him. She bit her lip and hesitated for a while before saying softly, “Then, how did you…”

“Mm?” Mo Shixiu looked at her. “What about me?”

Jiang Luoli looked at his handsome face and felt her heart race. “Why did you reject me the previous two times? You’re obviously despising my figure.”

Mo Shixiu was stunned and took a while to react.

“So, you think I rejected you because you’ve gained weight?”

“Of course.” Jiang Luoli was upset. “Why else? Don’t say you didn’t want to, I clearly felt it…”

The girl blushed. Even though they were already husband and wife, she still felt a little embarrassed when it came to that.

After all, she had only done it with him twice.

Mo Shixiu didn’t expect Jiang Luoli to care about this.

He didn’t expect her to think he rejected her because of her figure.

If she hadn’t said it herself, he would probably never think of this.

He was stunned for a moment before realizing that he had to explain this matter seriously. Otherwise, she would really think that he despised her figure.

“Luoli.” Mo Shixiu kept quiet for a while before looking down at the girl in his arms.. Then, he said with a serious expression, “Your figure has nothing to do with the reason I rejected you the previous two times.”
