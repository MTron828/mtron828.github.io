Chapter 336: We Have to Take That Role From Qiao Mianmian

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

But this prejudice against him had diminished drastically the moment he saw Mo Yesi.

This man in a suit before him was so very different from how he’d expected.

Not only was he far from the inexperienced-looking young man he’d pictured in his head, but his presence was also so domineering that everyone felt a little intimidated.

This was the first time in his life that a young man caught him off-guard.

Now, he dared not underestimate this man any longer.

He’d been in the industry long enough to know at first glance that this young man wasn’t so simple.

Mo Yesi shook hands with him very briefly. “Chairman Chen is too kind. Mo Corporation chose to work with Heng Tong because Heng Tong is good enough.”

Chairman Chen went on with a few more diplomatic words, and Mo Yesi did the same.

The two men exchanged some more civilities before being led to the golf course.

On the other side.

Qiao Anxin’s face was black as thunder as she left the audition hall.

She erupted the moment she entered the elevator and yelled at Linda, “That slut actually made it through the auditions. Linda, did you hear that? They said they’d already settled on that character.

“What do I do now? What do I do now?!” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

She grabbed Linda’s arm as her eyes filled with worry and anger. “Help me think of something, quick! You’ve got to help me. I can’t let that slut have a chance to show her face to the world. Tell me how I can stop her.

“How can she play the third female role?

“If she’s the third female role, wouldn’t that mean she’ll have a chance at becoming famous? There are so many scenes for that character. How could she get it?!”

“Anxin, calm down.” Linda frowned and tried to resist flaring up. “This isn’t a tragedy, don’t get so flustered. Calm down first. We’ll think of something.”

“How is this not a tragedy?”

Qiao Anxin was deeply upset by her attitude. “Do you know the consequences of giving her a chance to show her face to the world?”

“Of course I do.” Linda actually felt some contempt towards Qiao Anxin at her current attitude.

She knew what Qiao Anxin was worried about.

Qiao Mianmian’s appearance was so outstanding. As long as somebody was willing to groom her, she’d definitely make it big.

She was the sort who could make a name for herself even if she just played a small character.

What made it even worse for Qiao Anxin was that Qiao Mianmian was also very talented in acting, besides just having good looks.

If it wasn’t for her ruining things for Qiao Mianmian all these years, Qiao Mianmian would probably be a megastar by now.

Back then, she’d wanted to sign Qiao Mianmian under her wing when she first saw her.

If it wasn’t for Su Ze forcing her to take Qiao Anxin, she’d probably be managing Qiao Mianmian now.

Had Qiao Mianmian been given the same resources, she’d definitely be way more successful than Qiao Anxin.

Qiao Anxin knew this very well too. That explained her strong reaction.

“You know it, so think of something to stop her!” Qiao Anxin glared at her. “I don’t care what it takes. We have to take that role from Qiao Mianmian!”

Linda was a little speechless. She didn’t know how to respond to such a demand. “If we really get that third female role, are you seriously going to take it up? Don’t you forget, you’ve already signed the female lead role for ‘Imperial Palace.’ You’re going to have to pay a huge compensation fee if you go back on it, and you’ll end up offending a lot of people.”
