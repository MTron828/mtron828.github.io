Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Mo Yesi smiled. “I’m afraid they can’t afford it.”

“Oh right, Lu Rao, why didn’t you bring your wife along? Didn’t you say you wanted to bring her out to meet us?”

Lu Rao waved the teacup. “She’s having a gathering with her colleagues tonight. I’ll treat you guys to a meal another day.”

“Lu Rao’s wife?” Yan Shaoqing was talking to Qiao Mianmian, but his ears didn’t miss the conversation between Mo Yesi and Lu Rao. He turned around and smiled. “Heh, I’ve already seen her. Second Bro, let me tell you, Lu Rao is so lucky. His wife is so beautiful.

“She has a special temperament. It’s that kind of… feeling of a well-bred young lady from ancient times. And she’s so gentle and talented. No wonder Lu Rao got married so quickly. If he didn’t get his hands on such an outstanding wife sooner, he probably wouldn’t have had the chance.

“Second Bro, you and Sis-in-law got married too.

“I understand now that I’ve met a good wife. I have to do it immediately. I have to learn from you.”

Lu Rao glared at him. “You’ve finally come to your senses? What were you doing? It’s too late.”

It was fine if Lu Rao didn’t say anything, but the moment he did, he stabbed Yan Shaoqing in the heart.

Yan Shaoqing’s expression changed.

A few seconds later, he snorted. “It’s not too late to realize it now. When I meet a beauty who makes me fall in love at first sight, I can take her down immediately.”

Lu Rao wanted to say something.

But in the end, he didn’t say anything.

Forget it.

Why was he getting involved in someone else’s relationship?

Anyway, Yan Shaoqing had already messed things up. It was probably impossible to salvage the situation. There was no need for him to add salt to his wounds.

He knew Yan Shaoqing well.

This person usually looked like a playboy, like his feelings were like a game.

But this time, he was really sincere.

He was just playing around, but in the end, he played with his heart and the person he liked.

Everyone knew that he regretted it now.

He just didn’t want to admit it.

Hence, such people often suffered because of their pride.

“President Lu is married?” Qiao Mianmian looked at Lu Rao in shock.

When she knew Lu Rao, he was still single. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Seeing that Lu Rao came alone today, she didn’t expect him to be married.

“Mm.” Lu Rao smiled at her. “I told Ah Si, he didn’t tell you?”

Qiao Mianmian shook her head and smiled. “Congratulations, President Lu. When will I be able to eat your wedding cake?”

“The wedding will be held next month. Sis-in-law and Ah Si must come to support us.”

“Of course.” Qiao Mianmian turned to look at Mo Yesi. “Why didn’t you tell me that President Lu is married?”

Mo Yesi looked at her calmly. “Why should I tell you?”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

“You’ll know when he sends the invitation,” Mo Yesi said.

“…”

“Oh right, Sis-in-law.. When is your wedding with Second Bro going to be held?” Yan Shaoqing’s voice came through. “You’ve already made it public, right? Is there a need to continue keeping the marriage secret?”
