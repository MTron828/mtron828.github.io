Chapter 80: What on Earth Happened?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“The two of you have been in a relationship for so many years, so she must have a special place in your heart. I’m afraid that you’ll regret being together with me.”

“Don’t be silly. Why would I regret it? Meeting you and being together with you is the least regretful thing in my life.” The more anxious Qiao Anxin appeared, the more satisfied Su Ze felt inside. This made him feel like Qiao Anxin desperately needed him and could not live without him.

And he did indeed think so.

Qiao Anxin was very weak and needed a man she could rely on. If nobody took care of her, her life would surely be in complete shambles.

However, Qiao Mianmian was different.

She appeared soft, delicate, and triggered protective instincts from others, but in reality, she was an extremely independent woman.

Even without him, she could still have a good life.

But if Qiao Anxin didn’t have him...

“Really?” Qiao Anxin looked up teary-eyed and sobbed. “Then can you promise me something?”

“Yes, what is it?” Su Ze asked endearingly, feeling distressed at her woeful look. “Whatever it is, I will give you my promise.”

“Since my sister is still clinging onto you, could you try not to meet her in the future? Brother Ah Ze, you’re my boyfriend now, so I don’t want you to meet other women.”

She pouted and added sourly, “Even if that woman is my sister, I’ll still be jealous.” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Su Ze had originally felt unhappy at her request, but after he looked down and saw how alluringly jealous she looked, the unhappiness in his heart instantly dissipated.

It was all because she cherished him too much.

She wouldn’t be so uptight if she wasn’t so in love with him.

The fondness in Su Ze’s heart multiplied at this thought, and he nodded with any further hesitation. “Okay, I promise you.”

A hint of satisfaction flashed past Qiao Anxin’s eyes. “Then now...”

“I won’t go.” Su Ze caressed her head and said gently, “It’s just a small dispute, I don’t have to step in. Let me continue picking out accessories with you.”

“Brother Ah Ze, you’re so good to me.”

Qiao Anxin tiptoed and pecked him on the lips, full of satisfaction.

Ha! Qiao Mianmian, so what if you and Su Ze have many years of feelings?

I’m more important in his heart!

Mo Yesi sent Qiao Mianmian to school.

He watched her enter the school gates before letting Uncle Li drive back to the company.

Once he arrived, he paged for Wei Zheng.

“Chairman Mo,” Wei Zheng entered the Chairman’s office and greeted him respectfully.

Mo Yesi was focused on the document in his hand. “Go to Sheng Hui Corporation tomorrow to talk about the acquisition arrangements.”

Wei Zheng was stunned. “Acquisition? Chairman Mo, are you acquiring Sheng Hui Corporation?”

This was a bolt out from the blue.

He had never divulged such an intention before.

“Yes.” Mo Yesi flipped through the document and added, “Also, give the Film School’s headmaster in Yun Cheng a call later. Tell him that he has to expel two female students for improper moral conduct.”

Wei Zheng was left speechless.

So, Chairman Mo wanted to acquire a company and expel students after coming back from a break?

What on earth happened?

The school wasn’t difficult to deal with.

Mo Corporation held a significant share of Yun Cheng Film School’s stocks. In other words, Mo Corporation was the school’s board of directors.
