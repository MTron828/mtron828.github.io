Chapter 707: For Your Safety, Don’t Go Out for Now

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Even if she offended him.

Offending him alone was better than offending his female fans.

“Sister Mianmian, did you read the comments just now?” Nana asked.

Those comments were really scary.

She was shocked.

“Mm.” Qiao Mianmian exited Weibo and didn’t want to read the comments anymore. “Are all male celebrities’ fans so scary now?”

“Not really.”

Nana thought for a while and said, “Female fans have always been scary, but Tu Yilei’s female fans are so many times scarier than other male celebrities. Although he doesn’t walk the path of an idol, his face is enough to make girls go crazy.”

Qiao Mianmian still had a lingering fear at the thought of those terrible comments.

She now felt that Linda’s “throwing rotten eggs” was already considered a light punishment.

When the fans went crazy, they weren’t just throwing rotten eggs.

They could probably even commit murder and arson.

Qiao Mianmian was a little afraid when she heard Linda talk about how crazy they were.

When she saw the negative comments, she was even more frightened.

What trouble had she gotten herself into?

It was much worse than Su Ze’s.

Qiao Anxin’s fans weren’t as scary as Tu Yilei’s.

“Miss Qiao, Brother Tu asked me to come over and let you know. Please don’t leave the set for now.” Hui Hui was walking towards them.

Qiao Mianmian was shocked by Tu Yilei’s fans.

So much so that she was a little afraid of anyone related to him.

When she saw Hui Hui, she immediately looked behind him. When she didn’t see anyone else, she heaved a sigh of relief.

She could roughly guess what was going on.

She pretended to be calm despite her fear and panic. “Why? Is someone waiting for me outside?”

Hui Hui nodded. “Yes. I’m sure Miss Qiao has already seen the scandal between you and Brother Tu. The people waiting for you outside are Brother Tu’s fans, and they’re very agitated. They might do something.

“For your safety, don’t go out for now.”

What she was afraid of came true.

Qiao Mianmian went pale. “A lot of people?”

Hui Hui nodded again. “About a dozen. The workers are blocking them now, so they can’t enter. Moreover, Director Bai already got someone to call the police. They’ll be here soon. But before that, don’t leave.”

“Alright, I got it.”

Qiao Mianmian didn’t dare to go out.

Nana was furious. “Your Brother Tu’s fans are too scary. Sister Mianmian has nothing to do with him at all. He just helped Sister Mianmian a little, and they’re saying that Sister Mianmian seduced him on purpose to gain his popularity.

“The fans are still looking for Sister Mianmian.”

Hui Hui rubbed his nose and said innocently, “You can’t blame Brother Tu for this. He’s not behind the scandal. He blames himself for this. He feels that he caused Miss Qiao harm.”

“Oh right, Miss Qiao.” Hui Hui turned to Qiao Mianmian and said, “Brother Tu asked me to pass you a message. He said that this was caused by him, so he’s very sorry.”𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com
