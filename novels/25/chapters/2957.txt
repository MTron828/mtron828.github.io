Chapter 2958: Pay the Price for What She’s Done

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

If he wanted to confess, so be it. But he made it so formal and affectionate, making her heart race abnormally again.

“Ahem, um... let’s talk about this when we get home.” Qiao Mianmian blushed as she looked at Jiang Luoli and Mo Shixiu behind them.

This was the umpteenth time Mo Yesi had confessed to her, but she still felt tempted every time.

Mo Yesi also saw Jiang Luoli and Mo Shixiu walking over. He smiled and hugged his thin-skinned wife. He lowered his voice and chuckled. “Mm, let’s talk when we get home. It’s really inconvenient to say some things here.

“TI tell you slowly when we’re back and there’s only the two of us.”

The man’s voice was low and deliberately alluring as he whispered into Qiao Mianmian’s ear. As he spoke, his voice got lower and lower, but his breath got warmer.

Qiao Mianmian’s face warmed.

Mo Yesi was really... getting more and more indecent!

Qiao Mianmian saw Madam Mo again a week later.

‘The Mo Residence called and said that they had something important to announce.

Qiao Mianmian and Mo Yesi arrived at the Mo Residence and found that Jiang Luoli and Mo Shixiu were there, too.

Jiang Luoli and the rest received the same call.

“Baby, do you know why Old Madam called us back? I heard from Shixiu that Second Uncle and the rest were called back, too.” Jiang Luoli held Qiao Mianmian’s hand and asked softly.

The entire family had been called back. They must have something important to announce.

“Tm not sure, either. Grandma only told us to come back, she didn’t say anything else.” Qiao Mianmian guessed that this had something to do with Madam Mo.

Madam Mo almost killed her own granddaughter with Tang Ya. Even if it was a false alarm, she couldn’t just pretend that nothing happened.

Tang Ya was punished.

Madam Mo had to pay for what she’d done.

Old Madam called the whole family back today. Madam Mo’s punishment must have been decided.

A moment later, they entered the hall.

Qiao Mianmian immediately saw Old Madam sitting with a serious expression. Mo Xingshu and Second Madam were sitting on Old Madam’s left, and Mo Yunchen was sitting on her right.

Just as Qiao Mianmian guessed, Madam Mo, who had disappeared for a few days, was also there, but she was the only one standing.

At this moment, Madam Mo didn’t have her usual aura. She stood in front of the Old Madam with a pale face, and her hands were clasped together uneasily. Perhaps it was because she hadn’t rested well, but she looked haggard. Even the makeup couldn’t hide her tiredness.

She usually dressed well and had exquisite makeup. It was rare for her to be dressed so casually. Even her hair looked a little messy.

She didn’t even have the mood to do her hair.

This was the first time Qiao Mianmian saw Madam Mo so “slovenly”.

“Old Madam. Young Master and Young Madam are back.”

Old Madam looked up at Qiao Mianmian and the rest. She seemed to be in low spirits, too. She rubbed her temple and said tiredly, “The children are back. Sit down first. I have something to tell you..”
