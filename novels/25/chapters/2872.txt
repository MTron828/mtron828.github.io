“Do you want to force me to admit that I’m your stepsister so that you can clear your name and make others think that I’m slandering you?

“Qiao Mianmian, you’re too scheming. But it’s useless to play these tricks in front of me. I can tell what you’re scheming. I won’t let you succeed!”

Qiao Anxin still felt guilty when she said this.

She wasn’t sure if Qiao Mianmian was lying, but she felt that she didn’t show any flaws.

And she looked completely different now.

Qiao Mianmian only suspected her.

It was impossible to find out anything.

Yes, she couldn’t fall for it.

Qiao Mianmian was definitely trying to trick her.

If she revealed anything now, the little slut might really confirm who she was.

Once she knew her true identity, the little slut would definitely not let her off!

“You know very well whether I’m talking nonsense or not.” Compared to Qiao Anxin’s panic and guilt, Qiao Mianmian was very calm. She looked at Qiao Anxin as if she had seen through her and said calmly, “It’s fine if you don’t admit it. Anyway, I have all the evidence I need. I know where you had your plastic surgery, where you got your name changed, and all the communication history between you and Su Ze. I’ve checked everything thoroughly.

“If you still think I’m talking nonsense, then you know Doctor Xie from Yu Chan Beauty Salon, right? She was the one who performed your ten plastic surgeries. Oh right, she did your vocal cords surgery too, right?”

Qiao Anxin’s expression changed when Qiao Mianmian mentioned Yu Chan Beauty Salon.

She panicked when she heard Qiao Mianmian mention the plastic surgeon.

She had guessed that Qiao Mianmian was just bluffing.

Now, she was sure that Qiao Mianmian had really investigated her.

Qiao Anxin did plastic surgery partly because she couldn’t enter the entertainment industry with her previous identity, and partly because she was afraid that Qiao Mianmian would take revenge on her.

Seducing Gong Zeli was also one of the reasons.

But the main reason was that she was afraid of Qiao Mianmian.

Now that Qiao Mianmian knew her true identity, she couldn’t hide it anymore.

She bit her lip and glared at her. “That’s right, I’m Qiao Anxin. Qiao Mianmian, since you’ve already investigated everything, why are you still asking? What are you here for, to settle scores with me?

“What do you want? Do you want to force my mom and me to leave Yuncheng City again?” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“Settle scores?” Qiao Mianmian chuckled. “Qiao Anxin, we should indeed settle our scores.”

Stunned, a hint of panic appeared in Qiao Anxin’s eyes. But she didn’t want to show her fear in front of her. She forced herself to say, “Alright, do it. Do you think I’m afraid of you? Qiao Mianmian, don’t think you’re so amazing now that you can do whatever you want.

“I can’t leave this time.”

Qiao Mianmian laughed. “You think I’ll force you to leave Yuncheng City? Qiao Anxin, you’re wrong.. This time it won’t be as simple as just leaving Yuncheng City.”
