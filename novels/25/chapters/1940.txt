Chapter 1941: I Didn’t Expect to Meet You Here

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Exactly. Sister Mianmian’s cooking is delicious, and everyone loves it. That’s why our restaurant’s business was so good. If it was someone else cooking, I think the restaurant would close in three days at most.”

Qiao Anxin stood not far behind them. She clenched her fists tightly as she watched Qiao Mianmian being surrounded by Zhan Bo and the rest.

The episode ended.

She could finally stop being with Qiao Mianmian.

To Qiao Anxin, every day was torture.

She was Qiao Mianmian’s foil.

If it weren’t for the fact that she wanted to use this program to increase her popularity, she wouldn’t have been able to stay any longer.

“We’ll be going home tomorrow. Let’s have a good gathering tonight,” Shen Fei suggested.

The others naturally had no objections.

Hence, the gathering was set to be at seven in the evening at a famous five-star hotel in Weihai.

Qiao Mianmian arrived at the hotel punctually at 7:00 PM.

Halfway through the meal, Qiao Mianmian went to the washroom.

When she came out and had just turned the corner, she heard a familiar and surprised voice behind her.

“Mianmian, is that you?”

Qiao Mianmian stopped in her tracks.

Seeing her stop, the voice behind her became even more surprised. “Mianmian, it’s really you, isn’t it? I didn’t expect to meet you here.”

Footsteps approached and stopped behind her.

Su Ze’s excited and surprised voice sounded again. “Mianmian, you’re the person I want to see the most after returning to the country. I heard that you were filming here, so I wanted to try my luck and see if I could meet you.

“I didn’t expect to run into you here.”

Su Ze sounded very excited.

Qiao Mianmian turned around and saw his flushed face.

Su Ze’s appearance and words had always been gentle and refined, giving off a gentle feeling.

Qiao Mianmian used to like that about him.

She had always thought that she liked gentlemen.

Until she met Mo Yesi.

Qiao Mianmian didn’t know if it was because she had been through the Su family and had spent half a year in a remote place like Country F, but when she saw Su Ze again, she almost couldn’t recognize him.

Su Ze’s aura was completely different from before.

In the past, he looked like a gentle and elegant young master. Now, his aura was completely gone, and he exuded a dispirited aura. Furthermore, because of the strong sun rays in Country F, Su Ze was tanned, causing his looks to drop by a few degrees.

Even Qiao Mianmian almost couldn’t recognize him.

If it were someone not familiar with him, they would probably not recognize him.

Qiao Mianmian didn’t expect to meet Su Ze here, either.

When she saw him again, she felt nothing but disgust.

She said coldly, “Then, I’m really unlucky. I should have looked at the almanac before I left.”

She made no effort to hide her disgust.

Su Ze’s expression froze. He met Qiao Mianmian’s cold and disgusted eyes and looked hurt.

Now, Su Ze knew very well that Qiao Mianmian really had no interest in him.
