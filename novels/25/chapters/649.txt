Chapter 650: Baby, I Love You

The man cupped her face and pecked her on the lips before reluctantly letting go of her.

When Qiao Mianmian walked to her side, Nana said enviously, “Wow, Sister Mianmian. You have a good relationship with your boyfriend. I can tell that your boyfriend loves you very much. You’re so lucky to have such a handsome boyfriend who loves you so much.”

Mo Yesi was still standing there.

Qiao Mianmian turned to look at him.

The huge living room was crowded with people.

But he was the most eye-catching one.

Anyone who walked past him, whether male or female, would look at him.

Everyone was looking at him, but he only had eyes for her.

Seeing her turn around, he smiled and waved at her.

Qiao Mianmian couldn’t hear what he was saying.

But she understood his lips.

He was saying: Baby, I love you.

At this moment, Qiao Mianmian’s eyes were moist.

She really felt reluctant to part.

She had the urge to run back to him.

“Sister Mianmian, are you crying?” Nana saw that Qiao Mianmian’s eyes were red and turned to look at Mo Yesi, who was still standing at the same spot. She asked softly, “Are you reluctant to part with your boyfriend? He seems to be reluctant to part with you too. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Your relationship is really good. I’m so envious of you.

“Sister Mianmian, is this your first time separating from your boyfriend?”

“No.” Qiao Mianmian sniffled and forced her tears back. “We were apart before, but I didn’t go overseas.”

Moreover, they wouldn’t have been apart for so long.

“No wonder.” Nana understood. “But F City isn’t too far from Yuncheng City, so he can go and see you. Your boyfriend works, right?”

“Mm.”

“Then, he can come and see you this weekend. That way, you can meet each other every week. Hmm, his income should be okay, right?”

Qiao Mianmian replied, “Mm, it’s alright.”

“That won’t be a problem, then. He can afford the air tickets for every week.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

Mo Yesi’s income wasn’t just enough to cover his monthly air tickets.

He could afford air tickets every day.

“Sister Mianmian, what does your boyfriend do for a living?” Nala was a curious girl and kept asking. “Does he own a company, or does he work for others? He should be the boss of his own company, right? I don’t think he works for others.”

“Mm, he opened a small company.”

“Small company?” Nana was stunned for a moment before frowning. “I feel like your boyfriend has someone bigger.”

Qiao Mianmian was amused and asked, “What does he look like?”

“He seems like a super-rich and domineering president,” Nana thought for a while and replied seriously. “For example, the heir of a large corporation or something. He’s the sort of rich young master in an idol drama.”

Seeing that Qiao Mianmian was smiling, she emphasized again seriously. “It’s true, it’s super alike. Is it possible that he’s actually a Young Master from a rich family? Then, in order to find his true love, he hid his true identity and told you that he runs a small company.”

This time, Qiao Mianmian couldn’t help but laugh.

“Nana, do you like to read domineering CEO novels?”
