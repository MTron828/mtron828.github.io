Chapter 1615: It Must Be Because of Qiao Mianmian

“Maybe Brother Zeli encountered something troubling today and is in a bad mood. That’s why his temper is bad.

“Or maybe he misunderstood me.

“In any case, I can understand. I won’t give up on him just because of this. Auntie, I-I still want to be with Brother Zeli. I want to marry him. I’m not afraid of anything. I’m just afraid that he likes someone else and doesn’t want to be with me.”

Shangguan Qing’s eyes turned red.

Madam Gong immediately comforted her. “How could that be? Qingqing, you’re so good. As long as you’re willing to persevere, Zeli will definitely feel your sincerity. Auntie will also help you and make him like you sooner.

“Only you are the most suitable for Zeli. Auntie doesn’t like other girls.”

Because of what Madam Gong said, Shangguan Qing felt a little smug.

Yes, she was the most suitable for Gong Zeli.

In terms of family background, looks, and other qualities, she was the most suitable for Gong Zeli.

Hence, the position of Young Madam could only be hers.

“But Brother Zeli doesn’t seem to like me...”

“It’s alright, child. Feelings can be nurtured. Back then, your uncle and I didn’t have feelings for each other from the start. They were slowly nurtured. Aren’t your uncle and I rather loving now?

“If you want to get Zeli’s heart, you have to be patient. I’ve said it before, he has no lack of girls around him since he was little. He’s just passive in relationships, and he needs the other party to take the initiative.

“Chase after him and hold on for a while. He’s not made of steel, how can he remain indifferent?”

Even though Shangguan Qing had been traumatized by Gong Zeli, she never thought of giving up.

She’d liked him for so many years.

Of course, she wouldn’t give up so easily.

Besides Gong Zeli, she had never thought of marrying another man.

“Auntie, I’ll work hard.” Shangguan Qing took a deep breath and clenched her fists. “I’ll definitely work hard to make Brother Zeli like me.”

Qiao Mianmian and Gong Zeli’s time on the hot searches passed very quickly.

She thought that this matter was over and didn’t take it to heart. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

But when she opened her eyes the next day, she saw a piece of news.

It was about Boss Huang’s management company.

The news said that Boss Huang’s company was suddenly found to have a problem with taxes. The company was temporarily under investigation. If it was confirmed that Boss Huang evaded taxes, he might even be arrested.

Because of this, Qiao Mianmian was trending again.

The netizens on Weibo were discussing how Boss Huang’s company had no problems before, but it suddenly had a problem now.

It must be because of Qiao Mianmian.

Everyone knew that Qiao Mianmian was harassed and molested by Boss Huang at the KTV that night.

After he was exposed for harassing her, a problem with the company’s taxes arose.

What a coincidence.

Wasn’t it obvious that someone wanted to stand up for Qiao Mianmian?

And this person was most likely Qiao Mianmian’s mysterious boyfriend.

The netizens left comments on Mo Yesi’s Weibo.

“@Nameless, are you trying to protect your wife? Boss Huang’s company was found to have tax issues. Did you do it?”
