Chapter 256: Do You Know the Woman Who Ah Si Brought Home?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Seeing how much Old Madam liked Qiao Mianmian, Mo Yesi smiled and said, “Since Grandma likes her so much, shouldn’t there be a welcome gift?”

“You brat.”

Old Madam glared at him but with love and affection. “Don’t you think your Grandma would know this? Don’t worry, I won’t deprive your wife of anything. Grandma has got it all prepared.”

Old Madam had gotten someone to bring the gift here the moment the butler informed her.

She’d prepared this gift a long time ago.

It had been years, but there hadn’t been a suitable recipient.

Her precious grandson had never been interested in women and had remained single for way too long.

She was worried that the gifts would never be given out.

But now, things were different.

Old Madam could finally be at ease now that she’d met Qiao Mianmian.

She was satisfied with this granddaughter-in-law.

Her grandson had rather good judgment indeed. He picked a really beautiful granddaughter-in-law for her.

She had a pretty little face that lifted spirits when others saw her.

Well, only a girl with such looks could match up to her precious grandson.

Besides Mo Yesi, the others in the Mo family had no idea that Old Madam Mo actually placed much importance on appearances.

It wasn’t difficult to please her. One just needed to look good.

The more good-looking one was, the more she liked them.

Qiao Mianmian didn’t just look good, she was just the type that Old Madam liked.

Even Qiao Mianmian herself didn’t know that she’d easily gotten Old Madam’s approval with that face of hers.

If she knew, she would definitely find an opportunity to introduce Jiang Luoli to this Old Madam.

After all, both of them were of the same type. Even though they were decades apart in age, they would be able to have a conversation on similar topics of interest.

“Go, bring me the gift I prepared for Mianmian.” Having approved of her, even the way she addressed her had changed. She sounded so much more intimate calling her Mianmian.

The atmosphere here was so lively.

While on the other side, Madam Mo and Shen Rou weren’t looking too happy.

Shen Rou was the daughter-in-law Madam Mo wanted.

She’d been trying to matchmake Mo Yesi and Shen Rou for the longest time. And yet, he just did not have a thing for her.

Even with all the opportunities she’d created for them to interact, their relationship hadn’t improved much.

Even so, Madam Mo still felt that Shen Rou was the most suitable daughter-in-law she could have.

In fact, she’d long treated Shen Rou as her daughter-in-law.

But who would’ve known that her son would suddenly bring another woman home and announce that they’d already gotten married?

They only knew about it now.

Madam Mo was very upset with the way Mo Yesi only informed them after everything had been finalized. But with Old Madam around, and given how much she seemed to like Qiao Mianmian, it wasn’t appropriate to say anything else at this point.

Old Madam was definitely the one with the most say in the Mo family.

Madam Mo had actually somewhat feared Old Madam all these years.

She never really dared to offend Old Madam.

But she couldn’t fully accept this daughter-in-law who appeared out of the blue too.

She asked Shen Rou with a rather cold expression, “Rou Rou, do you know the woman who Ah Si brought home?”

Shen Rou’s eyes had been on Mo Yesi the moment he entered the living room with Qiao Mianmian.

Seeing how affectionately he looked at Qiao Mianmian and patted her on the head, Shen Rou felt as if her heart had been ripped in half.
