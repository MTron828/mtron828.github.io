Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Mo Yesi felt her change and laughed. “You’re so afraid of me? I said I wouldn’t touch you, so I won’t. Even if I tired you before, I already let you rest long enough. Your body is so delicate, hasn’t it recovered?”

The petite woman in his arms shifted her body like a worm and turned to face him. “Yes, I’m delicate, but I haven’t recovered! I’ve said it before, don’t even think about it before your hand recovers.”

Mo Yesi raised an eyebrow. “Baby, I remember telling you that my hand has recovered. Even Lu Rao said that my hand can be used normally. It’s fine if you don’t believe me, but you don’t believe Lu Rao?”

As Mo Yesi spoke, he showed that his hand had already scabbed and had a new layer of skin. “If you still don’t believe me, how about checking it?”

Qiao Mianmian looked down and smiled. “Mm, It’s fine now. But you just said that you won’t touch me tonight. Mo Yesi, you can’t go back on your words. I have to wake up early tomorrow, so I have to sleep early.”

She heard an even more helpless sigh. “Yes, what did I promise you? I just want to hug you and talk to you. Is that alright?”

“Mm, sure.” Qiao Mianmian snuggled into his arms and leaned against his chest comfortably. “What do you want to talk about?”

“Let’s talk about our wedding. I want to hold our wedding after you’re done with the movie.” Mo Yesi had been thinking about this for a long time. Now that he and Qiao Mianmian had made it public, everyone knew that they were already married, but he still owed her a grand wedding.

There was no need to hide their relationship.

Everything had to be done properly.

“Wedding?”

“Mm.”

Qiao Mianmian thought for a while and nodded. “Mm, I think so too. Let’s hold the wedding after I’m done with this movie.”

Even though he knew that she wouldn’t reject him, the moment she agreed, Mo Yesi couldn’t help but smile charmingly. “I remember you saying that you like weddings by the sea?” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Mm.”

“Have you thought of the specific address for the wedding?”

Qiao Mianmian was stunned. “Not yet…”

“Do you want to choose the place yourself, or do you want me to help you?”

“You do it.” Qiao Mianmian looked up and smiled sweetly. “Mo Yesi, can I be a lazy person who doesn’t participate in the process and only enjoys the finished product? I think your taste is good. I like everything you pick, so I think it’s good to let you organize our wedding.

“It’s fine as long as it’s your decision.”

Mo Yesi was stunned for a while. Then, he chuckled and looked at the woman in his arms affectionately. “You’re a little lazy. I thought you’d like to organize our wedding.”

“With you around, it’s fine even if I’m lazy.” Qiao Mianmian hooked her arms around his neck and smiled. “My husband is too capable. He can do anything and everything well.”

She acted coquettishly.

The man was complaining, but he really liked how sweet she looked.. He was even more attracted to her.
