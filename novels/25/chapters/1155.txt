Chapter 1158: Never Let Her Down

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Although Su Ze had let her down, Mother Su had always treated her well.

Hence, even though Qiao Mianmian hated Su Ze, she was still very polite to Mother Su. She smiled and said, “Aunt Su, what a coincidence to meet you here.”

“Yes, what a coincidence.” Mother Su endured her heartache and said, “I haven’t seen you in a while, I miss you so much. Mianmian, I’ve said it before, even if it’s you and Ah... the Su family, you can still go anytime.”

When she saw Mo Yesi standing beside Qiao Mianmian, Mother Su immediately felt awkward.

She immediately changed the topic. “Mianmian, this gentleman is... aren’t you going to introduce him to Aunt Su?”

“Oh, Auntie Su, I forgot to introduce you.”

Qiao Mianmian could feel Su Ze’s gaze on her.

He kept staring at her.

However, she treated him like air and didn’t even look at him. She held Mo Yesi’s arm affectionately and introduced him to Mother Su. “Auntie Su, this is my... boyfriend. His name is Mo Yesi. Ah Si, this is Auntie Su.”

Qiao Mianmian almost said “I used to play at her house when I was young”, but she stopped herself in time.

If she really said it, Mo Yesi would definitely feel uncomfortable.

Hence, she gave a simple introduction.

Fortunately, Mo Yesi was still very supportive at the critical moment. Even though he minded Su Ze a lot, he was very generous at this moment. He smiled at Mother Su and said, “Hello, Aunt Su. I’ve heard Mianmian mention you before. Thanks to you taking care of Mianmian all those years ago.”

Mo Yesi wasn’t unreasonable.

He naturally detested Su Ze.

However, he knew from Qiao Mianmian that Mother Su and Father Su had treated her well and never mistreated her. He wouldn’t turn his hatred towards Su Ze onto his parents.

He would give face to anyone that Qiao Mianmian cared about.

It was the same for Mother Su.

Mother Su was also magnanimous.

Even if Qiao Mianmian didn’t become her daughter-in-law, she was still glad to see her so happy.

She looked at Mo Yesi with admiration. “Mr. Mo is a talented man, you’re really compatible with Mianmian. Mr. Mo, Mianmian can be considered a child I’ve watched grow up. She’s a very, very good child. I hope Mr. Mo can treat her well and not let her down.” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Mo Yesi smiled and looked down at the girl beside him. “Auntie Su, don’t worry. Mianmian is a treasure I want to cherish for the rest of my life. I will treat her well and never let her down.”

This was a public display of affection.

Qiao Mianmian felt a little embarrassed in front of the elders and glared at him shyly.

In Su Ze’s eyes, this was a sign of affection.

Seeing the woman who once belonged to him being so intimate with another man and not even looking him in the eye, Su Ze’s eyes burned with anger. He couldn’t take it anymore and pulled Mother Su to the side, glaring at Mo Yesi with a livid expression. “Mom, do you know who he is? You even call him Mr. Mo. It’s the good girl in your eyes who colluded with this person and caused the Su Corporation to become like this. You’re still so polite to them!”

Mother Su was stunned, and her expression changed. “Ah Ze, what did you say?”
