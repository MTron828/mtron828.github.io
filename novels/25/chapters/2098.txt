Chapter 2100: We’re Going to Be a Family Soon

“What are you talking about?” Madam Gong was anxious and angry. “No matter what it is, it’s someone else’s kindness. It’s the rarest of intentions. Even if Aunt Shen and Rourou came empty-handed, Mom would be happy too.”

“It’s fine, it’s fine.” Madam Shen’s expression returned to normal. She smiled and tried to smooth things over. “Zeli is right. These are indeed common things. But families like ours have eaten all the good things, and this is the best. These daily meals are pretty good.

“Actually, bird’s nest is secondary. This ginseng is the rarest thing. It’s many years old, and it’s especially nourishing. Our family only got two of them. I heard that Sister Gong was unwell, so I brought one over.”

Just as Madam Gong was about to thank her, Gong Zeli spoke first. “Since ginseng is such a rare and good thing, why didn’t you bring two of them? My mom has been recuperating recently, how can one be enough?”

“Zeli!” Madam Gong was furious.

Madam Shen wasn’t any better.

No matter how patient she was, she couldn’t take it anymore.

Especially when Gong Zeli was deliberately targeting her.

But when she thought of their purpose in coming to the Gong family today, even if Madam Shen was unhappy, she suppressed her anger.

“It’s fine, it’s fine.” She was furious, but she put on a magnanimous expression. “Zeli is right. I didn’t consider it well. When I return, I’ll get someone to send another ginseng over.”

“Sister Shen, ignore him.” Madam Gong looked embarrassed. “I’m already very happy that Sister Shen came to see me. Nothing else is important.”

“Zeli, you haven’t greeted your Aunt Shen and Rourou.”

Madam Gong was also full of anger, but she suppressed it when she thought of her purpose in coming over today.

Gong Zeli walked over slowly.

With a nonchalant expression, he glanced at Shen Rou sitting beside Madam Shen and said, “Didn’t we just greet each other? Our Gong and Shen families are old acquaintances, there’s no need to be so polite.”

Madam Gong’s face turned green. “Zeli, you…”

“It’s alright, it’s alright.” Madam Shen smiled and said, “Zeli is right. Our families aren’t outsiders anymore, there’s no need to be so polite. Moreover, we’re going to be a family soon, there’s no need to be so polite.”

Gong Zeli’s smile froze.

His eyes narrowed. “Aunt Shen, what do you mean?”

Madam Shen was about to speak when Madam Gong walked to Gong Zeli.

She tugged at his arm. “Zeli, sit down first.”

Gong Zeli didn’t move.

He turned around and said expressionlessly, “Mom, what did Aunt Shen mean by that? Our Gong and Shen families are about to become a family?”

“Zeli, your Aunt Shen…”

“Mom, you just have to tell me what it means for the Gong and Shen families to become a family soon.” Gong Zeli’s tone was forceful.

Madam Gong was speechless. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com
