His deep eyes were full of love, as if there was a vortex in them that could suck her in.

Qiao Mianmian’s heart raced.

It was as if they were meeting for the first time. Facing this husband who was with her all the time, she would be nervous, moved, and even… shy.

“Baby, you’re very beautiful today.” Mo Yesi’s gaze was still on Qiao Mianmian. From the moment he saw her, he never looked away from her.

The man lowered his voice and looked at her passionately.

Qiao Mianmian’s heart pounded.

The man continued to say sweet nothings. “You’re so beautiful, I can’t take my eyes off you.”

“Mo Yesi…”

Qiao Mianmian bit her lip and blushed.

“I’m telling the truth. You’re so beautiful. | can’t wait to kiss you.”

Qiao Mianmian blushed even more.

He loved her shy side.

His eyes darkened as he watched her face turn red. He couldn’t help but recall the first night they met.

That night, she was the same…

ot only was her face red, but her porcelain skin was also pink like a tender rose…

Jiang Luoli turned to look at the handsome man beside her and smiled. “I’m willing!”

The priest smiled and asked again, “Then, groom Mo Yesi, are you willing to let the bride, Qiao Mianmian, become your wife and love her for the rest of her life, protecting

her for the rest of her life, regardless of poverty, wealth, health, and illnesses, to love her forever and accompany her for the rest of her life?”

Mo Yesi held Qiao Mianmian’s hand tightly and looked down at the person beside him. His eyes were filled with nothing but desire for her.

The man smiled and said, “I’m willing to love her, dote on her, and accompany her until my life ends.”

At night.

In the VIP room, the coffee table was full of alcohol, and a few empty bottles could be seen on the floor.

A person was sitting crookedly on the black sofa.
