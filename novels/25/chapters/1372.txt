Chapter 1374: Repay My Kindness? You’re Not Worthy

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Dad, I have something on. I’ll get going first.”

Qiao Mianmian didn’t want to say another word.

She felt tired.

Even though she knew that Lin Huizhen was trying to sow discord between them again, she still felt disappointed.

Lin Huizhen’s success in sowing discord meant that Father Qiao had such thoughts too.

Otherwise, he wouldn’t have believed her.

This wasn’t the first time this happened.

When she was still living in the Qiao family, Lin Huizhen often sowed discord between them.

Her relationship with Qiao Ruhai worsened because of Lin Huizhen’s instigation.

Qiao Mianmian was willing to explain a few times.

In the end, she didn’t even want to explain.

Just like now.

She could explain it clearly.

But she felt that there was no need to.

“Qiao Mianmian, stop right there!”

The door was pushed open and Lin Huizhen walked out angrily. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“Do you want to leave just like that? You haven’t settled Anxin’s matter, you’re not allowed to leave!” With Qiao Ruhai around, Lin Huizhen’s attitude was very arrogant. She rushed over and grabbed Qiao Mianmian’s arm, not allowing her to leave.

Her voice was loud and sharp as if someone had stepped on her tail. “You’re not leaving until you settle Anxin’s matter today!”

“Let go.” Qiao Mianmian turned around and glared at her.

Lin Huizhen met her gaze and was shocked.

But with Qiao Ruhai by her side, she straightened her back and exaggerated again. “Why are you so fierce? I’m your elder. How can you treat your elder like this? Are you the daughter of the Bai family now? You don’t even respect your elders anymore.

“Qiao Mianmian, don’t forget who raised you!

“It’s time for you to repay me.”

Qiao Mianmian looked at Lin Huizhen’s opening and closing mouth, and her anger was almost at its limit. She took a deep breath and looked at her in disgust. “Repay your kindness? You’re not worthy.”

“You!” Lin Huizhen was so angry that she wanted to slap her.

Qiao Mianmian wouldn’t let her have her way.

Lin Huizhen’s hand was still in mid-air when she stopped it.

She grabbed Lin Huizhen’s hand and slapped her.

Lin Huizhen was left with five finger marks on her face.

Qiao Mianmian pushed her away.

Lin Huizhen staggered two steps back. If Qiao Ruhai hadn’t held her, she would have fallen to the ground.

She covered her face and looked up, her eyes full of disbelief and anger. “Qiao Mianmian, I’m your mother, how dare you hit me!”

“You’re not my mother.” Qiao Mianmian looked at her coldly. “You found this slap yourself.”

“You...”

Lin Huizhen covered her face and was about to go crazy. She pushed Qiao Ruhai away and raised her hand to return the slap.

But this time, she failed.

She had just reached out when she saw someone walking towards her from the corner of the corridor. He quickly stepped forward and grabbed her hand.

Lin Huizhen took a step back in shock and fear.
