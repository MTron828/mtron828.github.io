Chapter 1338: There’s No Way to Stop Her

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

She felt that this trip wasn’t wasted.

She was determined to stay in F City to take care of her daughter.

She’d been absent for over a decade, so she wouldn’t be absent anymore.

“Mom, can you go back now? Mianmian and I are going back to the set soon, we won’t have time to accompany you. You don’t have many friends here, you’ll be bored if you stay here. You should go back.”

Bai Yusheng was worried about Madam Bai staying here.

His mother was delicate and had been pampered since she was young. Even when she married into the Bai family, she didn’t do anything.

Servants took care of everything for her at home.

How could she compare to her family here?

But Madam Bai was determined to be a good mother. “I’m not going back. I want to stay and take care of Mianmian. I’m worried about leaving Mianmian here alone.”

Bai Yusheng had a headache. “Why is Mianmian here alone? Doesn’t she have me? Don’t worry, I’ll take good care of her.”

“You’re a man. How can you take good care of your sister if you can’t even take care of yourself? Don’t speak anymore. I’ve already decided to stay. I’ve already gotten someone to find a place to stay. You don’t have to care so much.”

“Mom...”

Bai Yusheng saw that he couldn’t persuade her no matter what and could only turn to Qiao Mianmian for help. “Mianmian, persuade Mom. I can’t persuade her. I guess she’ll only listen to you now.”

Qiao Mianmian also felt that Madam Bai was worrying.

She thought for a while and said gently, “Aunt Bai, Brother Bai and I usually stay on set all day. We can’t take care of you alone. Brother Bai and I will be worried about you.

“You’d better listen to Brother Bai and go back first.

“If Auntie misses me, you can call me or video call me.

“Don’t worry, I’ll take good care of myself. I’ll see you after the shoot.”

“But I’m worried about you.” Madam Bai held Qiao Mianmian’s hand, her eyes full of heartache. “I know filming is very tiring. I can still take care of you here. I’m not a child anymore, I can take care of myself. You guys can do your own things, don’t worry about me.”

“Seeing you in the video is not as good as seeing you in person.

“Do you not like Auntie staying here and feel that I’ve caused trouble for you?”

“Auntie, no...”

Qiao Mianmian didn’t know what to do with Madam Bai. She looked at Bai Yusheng pleadingly.

Bai Yusheng was also helpless. “Mom, we’re filming in this location for a few months. You can’t stay here forever, right? Dad will be back in a while, are you going to leave him alone in Yuncheng City?”

Madam Bai kept quiet for a while and frowned. “Then, can I stay here before your dad comes back?”

Bai Yusheng was speechless.

Forget it.

He felt that he couldn’t do anything to her.

His mother had just acknowledged her daughter and was extremely agitated. She wanted to do something for her daughter.

There was no way to stop her.

By then, he could only arrange for a few more people to be by her side.

...

After lunch, they returned to the set. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Madam Bai separated from them when they arrived.

In the car.

Bai Yusheng was afraid that Qiao Mianmian would think that Madam Bai was too clingy, so he explained it to her. “Mianmian, if Mom’s behavior bothers you—”
