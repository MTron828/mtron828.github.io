Chapter 788: Dreamscape

Meanwhile, Gong Zeli wasn’t sleepy at all.

The rabbit’s eye mask was stained with the girl’s sweet scent, and it would enter his nose from time to time.

It was as if a kitten was scratching his heart.

It tickled his heart.

He finally understood why everyone said girls were fragrant.

He had many women around him, but he didn’t like their perfume.

It felt a little pungent.

But the sweet scent on Qiao Mianmian didn’t make him feel uncomfortable or sick of it. He liked it.

It was faint.

He remembered this sweet scent for 10 years.

Even though it had been so many years, he could immediately remember it once he smelled it.

He suddenly recalled that he’d asked Shen Rou before.

Why didn’t she use this perfume anymore?

Shen Rou’s answer was that she didn’t like that smell anymore.

Then, the perfume stopped production.

He’d asked Shen Rou what brand of perfume it was and thought that he could get a bottle.

He really liked that sweet scent.

How did Shen Rou answer him?

She seemed to be referring to the perfume she picked when she was overseas. She had forgotten the brand.

After that, he never asked her again.

Although it was a pity that he couldn’t find that perfume, he felt that it wasn’t important.

The person with the perfume was right by his side. Nothing else mattered.

Until he smelled it again.

Until he realized that Shen Rou might have lied to him.

If that perfume had stopped production long ago.

How could he smell it on Qiao Mianmian?

If it hadn’t stopped production yet, why would Shen Rou lie to him?

There were too many questions in his heart, and he desperately wanted an answer.

He felt like he was getting closer to the truth ...

...

Gong Zeli had a very short dream.

He dreamt about that night 10 years ago.

In his dream, he fell into the pool. He choked on the water because he couldn’t swim, and his body sank bit by bit uncontrollably.

The water seeped into his nose.

He found it hard to breathe.

He struggled in the water and called for help.

But there was only silence.

Besides his cry for help, he couldn’t hear anything else.

No one heard his repeated calls for help.

The air in his chest was getting thinner and thinner. The darkness was approaching him, and he was gradually unable to make a sound.

Even though he knew that he was dreaming, Gong Zeli was still afraid.

The fear of death made him uncontrollably afraid.

He wanted to call for help, but he couldn’t make a sound.

Help, who could save him?

He really didn’t want to die.

Tears rolled down his face. He could feel death approaching.

Just as he was about to die from despair, a white light lit up in the darkness. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

He opened his eyes and saw someone swimming towards him.

He couldn’t see what that person looked like.

She was wearing a white dress, and her hair was very long. When it swayed in the water, it looked like seaweed.
