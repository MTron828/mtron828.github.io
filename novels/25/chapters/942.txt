Chapter 943: You’ve Finally Figured It Out?

He turned around and looked at Tu Yilei in shock, handing him the cell phone.

Tu Yilei took it and looked down. In an instant, his grip on the cell phone stiffened.

Even his body stiffened.

It was really him.

How could it be him?

Michael was shocked for a while before recovering.

But his eyes were still filled with disbelief. He looked at Tu Yilei in shock. “Little Tu Tu, that Mo guy is really the Chairman of the Mo Corporation. Didn’t they say that the Second Young Master of the Mo family doesn’t get close to women? But he was clearly...”

Michael wanted to say that they were obviously intimate, but halfway through, he saw Tu Yilei’s awful expression and swallowed his words.

But he still had doubts.

Could the rumors be false?

The Second Young Master of the Mo family didn’t have misogyny?

Otherwise, what was going on between him and that girl?

He already felt that his Little Tu had no hope.

But now, Qiao Mianmian’s boyfriend was actually the Chairman of the Mo Corporation.

The Second Young Master Mo of the Mo family.

At such a young age, he was already in charge of the economy of Country A.

It was no wonder that he could promise so many so-called compensations. To him, those were just words.

So, Second Young Master Mo was the mastermind behind Huang Yilin’s downfall? CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

It wasn’t unjustified at all.

She fell in the hands of the Mo Corporation’s Chairman, what else could she be wronged for?

This was a clear death sentence.

Moreover, it was her honor to be taught a lesson by Second Young Master Mo.

“Yilei.” Michael kept quiet for a while. Although he knew that Tu Yilei didn’t like what he was about to say, he still tried his best to persuade him. “You... just give up. You’ll never win against him.

“Moreover, he’s someone we can’t afford to offend.

“You... you can forget about that girl.”

Following such an outstanding man.

No woman could tolerate another man.

Although he felt that his Little Tu was especially outstanding, he had to admit that compared to Mo Yesi, his Little Tu was still inferior.

In fact, 98% of the men in Country A couldn’t compare to Mo Yesi.

This sort of man, who was blessed in all aspects, was God’s favorite.

How could others compare?

Tu Yilei pursed his lips and kept quiet for a long time.

It was so long that Michael couldn’t take it anymore. Just as he was about to continue persuading him, Tu Yilei finally spoke. His voice was cold and emotionless. “Michael, inform my Weibo operations team to post a Weibo later.”

Michael asked, “What do you want to post?”

Tu Yilei turned around and looked into the distance again with determination in his eyes. “Just say that I’ve decided to go overseas for a year. A year later, I’ll return to the entertainment industry.”

Michael was stunned for a few seconds before his face lit up. “Little Tu Tu, you’ve finally thought it through?”

Tu Yilei leaned against the window and smiled bitterly. “Otherwise, how am I going to compete with others?”
