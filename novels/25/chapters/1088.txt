Chapter 1089: Why Are You Here?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

As he thought about this, Mike looked at Wei Zheng and smiled. “Assistant Wei, you’re too polite. Although our Little Tu and Miss Qiao don’t have a good relationship and rarely interact with each other on set, we’re still colleagues.

“Under such circumstances, how could Little Tu watch Miss Qiao get hurt? Even if it wasn’t Miss Qiao, he would have done the same if it were someone else in the production team. Our Little Tu has always been a warm-hearted and kind-hearted child.”

These two sentences clearly explained the relationship between Qiao Mianmian and Tu Yilei.

The two of them had a very ordinary relationship.

Although he was talking to Wei Zheng, he was actually talking to Mo Yesi.

His Little Tu needed the help of that man surnamed Mo.

He couldn’t allow this to affect Little Tu’s future career.

Wei Zheng immediately understood.

He smiled and nodded. “Mr. Tu is really a good person.”

Mike: “...”

...

When Qiao Mianmian entered the ward, she saw Tu Yilei reading a book.

Hearing footsteps, he looked up.

When he saw that it was Qiao Mianmian, he was clearly stunned.

Qiao Mianmian walked over to the bed with the flowers she bought and placed them in a vase on the bedside table. She then greeted him. “Senior Tu, I didn’t affect your rest, right?”

Tu Yilei stared at her blankly. After a while, he came back to his senses. “I just woke up a while ago. Why are you here?”

“I wanted to see how you’re doing.” After knowing what Tu Yilei was thinking about her, Qiao Mianmian felt a little uncomfortable seeing him again.

Especially when they were alone in a room.

After some idle chatter, she didn’t know what else to say. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Senior Tu, how are doing now? Does your wound still hurt?” Qiao Mianmian looked at his injured hand. The burn on the back of his hand was still shocking.

She couldn’t help but feel guilty.

If it wasn’t for her, he wouldn’t have suffered like this.

Although he didn’t say anything, she knew that his hand had been corroded very badly. It must be very painful.

Tu Yilei could see her guilt and self-blame, and a relaxed smile appeared on his face. He smiled and said to her, “I’m much better now, it doesn’t hurt anymore. In a few days, I can be discharged from the hospital for treatment.

“Miss Qiao, I’m glad you came to see me. You really don’t have to worry about me. I’m fine.”

The more he said he was fine, the more Qiao Mianmian felt bad.

But she didn’t know what to say to him.

For a moment, the two of them seemed to be at a loss for words. They were both silent.

After a minute, Tu Yilei said, “Miss Qiao, I’m really sorry about what my fans did. I didn’t expect them to react so strongly and attack you. If they affected you, I’ll apologize on their behalf.”

He was talking about his fans attacking her previously.

It was impossible to say that it did not affect her at all.

She wasn’t mentally strong enough to ignore the insults and attacks.

But there was a reason.

The fans were too worried and felt sorry for their idol.

Qiao Mianmian felt that her injuries were nothing compared to Tu Yilei’s.

“Senior Tu, you don’t have to feel sorry for me. Your fans’ behavior is not something you can control. Besides, they’re too heartbroken for you. I can understand. Besides, that matter has been resolved, so you don’t have to take it to heart anymore.”
