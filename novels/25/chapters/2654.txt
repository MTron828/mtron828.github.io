Chapter 2657: Is She Crazy?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

There was a murderous look in his eyes.

Even from a distance, the people around could feel the terrifying aura coming from him.

No one dared to approach him.

No one dared to say a word.

No one expected Little Xiao to do such a crazy thing.

Using a sharp weapon to hurt someone in public?

Was she crazy?

Didn’t she know the consequences?

But as an adult, how could she not know the consequences?

She knew the consequences, but she still did it. It could only mean that she hated Qiao Mianmian to the core.

Was she really forced to leave the entertainment industry by Qiao Mianmian?

That was why she hated Qiao Mianmian so much?

“Mo Yesi, your hand is injured.” Qiao Mianmian got out of the car and saw that his palm was bleeding. Her heart skipped a beat. She grabbed his injured hand and looked at it. “Your palm has a very deep cut. You have to go to the hospital to bandage it immediately.”

Mo Yesi still stood there without saying a word.

His murderous eyes were still looking at the trembling Little Xiao.

“Damn, is Little Xiao crazy? She actually tried to stab Qiao Mianmian.”

“If Mo Yesi hadn’t pushed her away in time, Qiao Mianmian would definitely have been stabbed by her. Mo Yesi’s expression is so scary. Why do I feel like he wants to kill Little Xiao?”

“Aren’t you talking nonsense? If it was your wife who was almost stabbed to death, wouldn’t you want to kill the perpetrator? Little Xiao is really in trouble now. She angered Mo Yesi, and it’s not just as easy as leaving the industry.”

Even Qiao Mianmian was a little shocked by Mo Yesi’s murderous aura.

It was like he was a stranger to her.

Because he always showed his most gentle side to her, Qiao Mianmian almost forgot that Mo Yesi was a ruthless man.

She had heard of his ruthless methods in the business world.

If he wasn’t ruthless enough, he wouldn’t be able to make everyone in the company respect him so much in such a short period of time.

…

At the hospital.

“How did you do this? How could you cut your palm so accidentally?”

Lu Rao wrapped the last piece of gauze and cut off the rest.

Mo Yesi turned his wrist and said indifferently, “It’s nothing, I just accidentally cut it.” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Accidentally? What did you do to make such a deep cut?” Lu Rao obviously didn’t believe him. It was obvious that the wound wasn’t made by himself.

“Don’t let your hand get wet for the next few days, and don’t use force. Otherwise, your wound won’t heal well.

“You should eat lighter food, too. I don’t think you can do that. You usually eat lighter food.”

“Got it.” Mo Yesi nodded and stood up. “Go on, Mianmian and I will go back.”

With that, he reached out to Qiao Mianmian. “Mianmian, let’s go.”

Qiao Mianmian looked at his bandaged hand and felt a little guilty.

She stood up quietly and extended her hand to him. Mo Yesi held her hand and walked out of Lu Rao’s office.

They had just reached the door when Lu Rao’s voice sounded from behind them. “Ah Si..”
