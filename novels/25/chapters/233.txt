Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

She explained it to Mo Yesi because she thought that he wasn’t willing to let her go. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Eat first.”

The man led her to the dining table and the housemaid immediately pulled the chair for her.

He pressed on her shoulders gently to get her to sit.

The man tapped his slender fingers on the white table and then looked into her eyes. “I’ll send you there after we eat.”

Qiao Mianmian was a little shocked. “It’s alright, I can go there on my own.”

He detested Su Ze so much.

She was afraid they might fight if they met.

Mo Yesi looked at her deeply and smiled. “Baby, do you think I’ll let you go there alone?”

Qiao Mianmian: “Uh...”

She didn’t think so.

He wouldn’t want her to.

“There’s nothing to discuss here.” The man smiled tenderly but sounded firm. “I’ll send you there.”

“Sis, I’ll go with you too!”

Qiao Chen heard them speaking and added, “Brother-in-law and I will send you there together to support you. If the Su family is mean to you, I’ll beat them up.”

Qiao Chen waved a fist.

He wasn’t worried about Su Ze’s parents being mean to his sister.

It was that jerk Su Ze he was worried about.

“Yes.”

Mo Yesi scooped some food into Qiao Mianmian’s bowl and nodded. “You come along too. We’ll support her together.”

“That’s right!”

Qiao Chen scooped some fish into Qiao Mianmian’s bowl as well and smiled. “Sister, how could Brother-in-law and I possibly let you do this alone? If anything happens, we’d be too far away to help you.

“Let us come along with you.”

Qiao Mianmian looked at the man beside her and Qiao Chen opposite her. After hesitating for a few seconds, she nodded helplessly.

“Alright then.”

It didn’t seem like she could disagree anyway.

But she felt a need to preempt them before going over.

She said to Qiao Chen, “Chen Chen. When we get there, you’ve got to hold your temper and not do anything rash.”

She wasn’t afraid that Qiao Chen would hurt the Su family.

She was worried that Qiao Chen’s heart wouldn’t be able to take it if he got agitated.

After all, he’d only just been discharged.

Qiao Chen knew what she was worried about too and nodded sensibly. “Sister, don’t worry. I won’t neglect my health.”

...

At the Su household.

Mother Su hung up the phone and looked at Su Ze standing before her. Her eyes were bloodshot as she asked, “Ah Ze, why exactly did you and Mianmian break up? Did you let her down or betray her in any way?

“Tell me honestly!”

Su Ze looked a little guilty for a while, but he quickly recovered. “Mom, Mianmian and I just lost feelings for each other, so we broke up amicably.

“You should know that feelings can’t be forced. I know you and Dad like her a lot and hope that we can get married. But we’ve really lost feelings for each other.”

“Lost feelings?” Mother Su glared at him. “The both of you were just discussing your marriage not too long ago, and now you tell me you’ve lost feelings? Ah Ze, I’m your mom, the one who raised you since you were born. Do you think I don’t know my son? You really think I’ll buy this?”
