Chapter 523: Dream on

Upon the mention of his name, Qiao Anxin’s smile vanished.

Lin Huizhen cautiously said, “Anxin, Mom knows that you feel aggrieved. But you should know our family’s situation now. If you really break up with Su Ze, it’d be hard for you to find another man as eligible as him.

“You need to consider this carefully.”

“Mom, it’s not that I want to break up with him.” Qiao Anxin bit her lip as her eyes turned red. “He’s the one who wants to break up with me. He’s still thinking of that slut Qiao Mianmian. He can’t wait to break up with me so he can go back to her.”

Lin Huizhen was startled. “Isn’t that slut with that wild man? Doesn’t Su Ze know about it?”

“He does.” Qiao Anxin was even angrier as she thought about it. “But he feels that Qiao Mianmian was forced to it, and he wants to save her from that.”

“Then, now what?” Lin Huizhen was even more flustered now. “You’re signed under his company. If you break up, then...” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Mom, can you stop?” Qiao Anxin was frustrated and sounded extremely rude. “I’m troubled enough as it is. Can you leave first, I want to cool off on my own.”

“Anxin...”

Qiao Anxin covered her head with the pillow.

Lin Huizhen stood by her bed for a while and then left helplessly.

After she left, Qiao Anxin gave Su Ze a call. It rang for a long while but nobody picked up.

She ended the call and dialed it again, but still, nobody picked it up.

Qiao Anxin was so mad, she hurled her cell phone to the ground.

Su Ze really did want to break up with her.

Was it because he wanted to look for Qiao Mianmian as soon as possible?

Dream on.

She wouldn’t let him off just yet.

Never!

When Qiao Mianmian woke up, she saw a brand new outfit placed by her bedside.

There was even a note in the bag saying that the undergarments had been sterilized, so she could wear them without worry.

Qiao Mianmian smiled as she read the note and felt that Wei Zheng was really thoughtful.

She took the bag to the washroom and put it on after washing up.

The dress that Wei Zheng bought had a rather low neckline.

Qiao Mianmian looked at herself in the mirror after putting it on and found that the marks on her neck and chest area were very obvious.

They were all red hickeys.

There were so many of them all around, it was a pretty scary sight.

They were all left by Mo Yesi in the heat of the moment.

When he was into it, he couldn’t stop kissing her and calling her Baby.

He didn’t kiss her very hard or forcefully, but Qiao Mianmian’s skin was too tender.

Seeing all the marks he’d left, she furrowed her brows slightly and put her hair to the front, covering most of the marks.

Only when she found that they were less eye-catching did she leave the lounge.

She saw Mo Yesi sitting at his desk, a fitting silver-grey shirt wrapped around his perfect figure in the most flattering manner. He even left the top few buttons undone, revealing a sexy collarbone.

Those long legs were crossed elegantly.

Resting his head on one hand, he was looking through a document in his other hand very seriously.
