Chapter 1647: You Want to Leave Now?

Jiang Luoli’s voice was surprisingly calm and cold. “I heard everything you said. I’m telling you now, I won’t go back to that so-called home.”

“What did you say?” Mother Jiang was like a cat whose tail had been stepped on. “Say it again, what did you mean?

“What do you mean you won’t come back? Do you not want your home anymore?”

Jiang Luoli sneered. “When you made your choice, you didn’t treat me as your daughter. In your eyes, only Xiao Hai is your child. As for me...

“I’m dispensable.

“Since I’m dispensable in your hearts, what’s the point of me returning to that so-called home?

“The only thing I should be thankful for now is that you handed me to Brother Zewen and not another man. Otherwise, who knows what would have happened to me.

Mother Jiang didn’t expect her to say this.

After a while, she said angrily, “What’s wrong with Zewen? Our families have known each other for many years, and you grew up with him. He’s such an outstanding child, how is he not good enough for you? Do you really think that you’re a big star just because you went to some Film Academy?

“I saw that the child was reliable, and our families knew each other well, so I entrusted you to him. How could you say that I didn’t treat you as a daughter? Jiang Luoli, do you have a conscience? I gave birth to you after 10 months, suffered difficult labor, and raised you. Is this how you repay me?

“You don’t care anymore?! Do you have a conscience!!”

Jiang Luoli’s voice was still very calm. “I’ll settle this. If there’s nothing else, I’ll hang up.”

She hung up before Mother Jiang could respond.

She then blocked her number.

After doing all of this, her eyes and nose suddenly felt a little sour.

She couldn’t completely ignore it.

She was still sad about her parents’ favoritism.

Even if they had been so biased for more than 10 years.

But she had lived in the Jiang Family for so many years.

Even if she didn’t seem to care, how could she really not do so?

Jiang Luoli felt terrible and wanted to talk to someone.

She called Qiao Mianmian.

...

It was already very late when Qiao Mianmian received Jiang Luoli’s call.

She was already asleep when her cell phone vibrated.

She took the cell phone and saw that it was an unknown number. She wanted to hang up, but her fingers accidentally clicked on the “Accept” button.

A familiar voice sounded. “Baby, it’s me.”

“Luo Luo?” Qiao Mianmian looked at the time. It was already 1 AM.

She looked at the man sleeping soundly beside her. Not wanting to disturb him, she tiptoed out of bed and went to the balcony to answer the call.

“Luo Luo, what’s wrong? Are you crying?”

In the afternoon, she contacted Jiang Luoli and was relieved to know that Mo Shixiu had found her.

But now she was worried after hearing Jiang Luoli crying on the phone.
