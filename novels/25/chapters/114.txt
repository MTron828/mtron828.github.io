Chapter 116: She Cried?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Mo Yesi lowered his head.

His sexy, warm, thin lips were only a centimeter away from her lips.

As he spoke, his exhaled heat fell onto the corner of her lips.

Rubbing his fingers gently against her jaw, his charming and cold eyes narrowed slightly, he asked with a little coldness, “Why was Su Ze at the banquet? You just happened to eat in the same place?”

The man seemed to be asking a random question, but the sensitive Qiao Mianmian immediately picked up on his meaning from his words.

She froze, blinked, and an inexplicable annoyance immediately rushed to her head as she frowned. “Do you suspect that I made an appointment with him?”

Mo Yesi pressed down to increase the strength of his fingers on her jaw, his eyes were deep and unpredictable. “Why, are you angry? I just feel that it was a bit of a coincidence.”

He clearly did not feel that way.

He obviously suspected that she and Su Ze had agreed to meet in advance.

Qiao Mianmian did not expect that he would think of her that way.

The moment she decided to break up with Su Ze, she could never look back.

Moreover, she married him. She was his wife.

Regardless of whether they had feelings involved in their marriage, she would follow her duty and be a qualified wife.

It was impossible for her to do something she should not before their marriage was over.

Looking at the man’s skeptical eyes, Qiao Mianmian’s heart seemed to be stabbed by something, and she felt inexplicably uncomfortable.

At the same time, feelings of anger and disappointment also surged in her heart.

In anger, she slapped his hand holding her jaw away and then pushed him off.

Before Mo Yesi could respond, she got out of his arms, grabbed the satchel that was set aside, and pushed open the car door before getting off.

What Qiao Mianmian hated most was being distrusted.

Mo Yesi’s skeptical look reminded her of Su Ze.

She thought back to how she was framed by Qiao Anxin that day, but Su Ze did not even give her a chance to explain and immediately chose to believe Qiao Anxin.

She now felt the disappointment at that moment again.

With grievances buried in her heart, as she pulled the door open, her vision became blurred.

At this moment, she did not even want to explain, she just wanted to leave immediately.

Just after one step, the man behind her grabbed her arm and pulled her back.

She crashed into the man’s arms again. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

The powerful arm immediately wrapped around her and hugged her tightly.

“Let me go!”

Qiao Mianmian struggled immediately, her small hands thumping on his sturdy chest, and she growled angrily. “Mo Yesi, what are you doing. Let me go, let me get off.”

The woman’s voice, which became sharp because she was angry, also had a hint of tears.

Mo Yesi froze, his long fingers tipping her jaw, forcing her to raise her head.

He frowned in surprise when he saw the pair of misty eyes.

She cried?

He just saw her ex-boyfriend and felt a little uncomfortable, so he asked.

As long as she said everything was just a coincidence, he would believe her.

And would not continue to pursue this matter.

All he wanted was a word of reassurance from her.

But he did not expect that his sentence would make her so angry that she actually cried...

The girl’s eyes were bright with tears and a little red. They were still filled with grievances and anger, full of complaints.
