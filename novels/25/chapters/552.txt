Chapter 553: I’m Willing to Do Anything for You

She thought that he would hold her in high regard no matter what happened because of their long friendship.

However, she was wrong. It was only at this moment that she realized it.

She was wrong the entire time.

Suddenly, Shen Rou could only feel hatred towards Mo Yesi.

She was the person that understood him the best. She was the one most suitable for him and the one who gave her heart to him.

She had loved him for over twenty years.

It was love at first sight, and it became a single-sided affection that lasted for more than twenty years. She was practically obsessed with him.

Even though he never reciprocated in the same manner.

She remained hopeful.

She was hoping that one day, he would change his mind and be touched by her dedication.

He would also realize that she was the woman most suitable for him.

They were born to be together.

She was going to be his bride, and she didn’t care how long she would have to wait.

That wishful thinking of hers sustained her to remain by his side all this while.

She didn’t mind the suffering along the way to get to her happy ever after.

But now, the hope that she clung onto all this while was dashed.

He suddenly got married, and she wasn’t the wife.

It was an unpopular actress who didn’t have any background. She only knew him for less than a month.

How could she take it?

She hated it.

“Wei Zheng.” Mo Yesi dialed the company hotline and called for Wei Zheng coldly. Every word that he spoke was engraved into Shen Rou’s mind. “Come over and escort Miss Shen out.”

He then hung up the phone and looked coldly towards Shen Rou, who was crying hysterically. He continued, “Wei Zheng will escort you out. From now onwards, don’t look for me unless you have important matters.

“I’m really busy recently and don’t have the time to entertain you.”

“No time to entertain me?” Shen Rou chuckled sarcastically. She glared at Qiao Mianmian and continued, “But if Qiao Mianmian wants to see you, you will have time to entertain her, right?”

Mo Yesi snapped impatiently. “I’ve said it already. You two are different.”

“Yes, you have said it already...” Shen Rou said sarcastically as she wiped her tears. “I was wrong all this while. If I knew this would be the outcome, I would have...”

She stopped in the middle of her speech and smiled again.

She gently wiped her tears away and continued, “Ah Si, you must have felt my feelings towards you all this while. Everything that I’ve done was for you. I’m willing to do anything for you too.

“I’m the only person on this earth that will never hurt you. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Qiao Mianmian...”

Shen Rou smiled as she glanced at Qiao Mianmian and continued, “You’ll find out eventually who is really looking out for you. Some people are just with you to use your power.”

Mo Yesi frowned, and just when he was about to snap, Qiao Mianmian spoke. “Miss Shen, are you saying that I’m only with Mo Yesi because I was attracted to his power and social status?”

Shen Rou gave her a look of condemnation and replied, “What other reason could there be? How long have you known him? Do you actually know who he really is? Are you saying that you married him because you loved him?”

“Of course not.” Qiao Mianmian quickly denied.

Shen Rou was shocked.
