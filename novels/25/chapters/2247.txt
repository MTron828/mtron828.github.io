Chapter 2250: I’m Not That Cheap

Perhaps God felt that Gong Zeli’s life was too smooth, so he suffered such a setback in his relationship.

He was always the one who despised others and found them annoying.

But now, everything was the opposite.

His pride and dignity were trampled under Qiao Mianmian’s feet.

In front of her, he was so pitiful.

He didn’t get anything in return.

All he saw was her avoidance and dislike.

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

She wanted to say that she didn’t hate Gong Zeli, but she really didn’t want to have anything to do with him anymore.

Before knowing his feelings for her, they might still be friends.

But now… they could only be strangers.

She had to consider Mo Yesi’s feelings.

“Qiao Mianmian, I promised you before that I wouldn’t pester you anymore. I’ll do what I say. But you can’t control who I want to interact with or what I want to do.

“Don’t you already treat me as a stranger? Then, why do you care?”

Qiao Mianmian pursed her lips and didn’t know what to say.

She couldn’t refute Gong Zeli’s words.

Yes, if Gong Zeli was just a stranger to her, why should she care?

She felt embarrassed. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

She felt that she was overthinking.

She thought that Gong Zeli must have helped Father Qiao because of her.

But he denied it.

She was overthinking.

Gong Zeli looked at Qiao Mianmian’s blushing cheeks, and a strange look flashed past his eyes. He kept quiet for a few seconds before turning around. “Since you don’t want to see me so much, I’ll leave now. Don’t worry, I, Gong Zeli, am not so cheap. I don’t have to be with anyone. You saved me, and I owe you a favor. This is a fact. But since you don’t care for this favor and don’t want to receive any repayment from me, then we’ll write this off.

“But remember, it’s not that I don’t want to repay your kindness, it’s that you don’t want it.”

With that, Gong Zeli left.

Qiao Mianmian stood rooted to the ground and watched him leave. She suddenly felt guilty as if she’d done something wrong.

She seemed to have hurt Gong Zeli.

But that was all she could do.

She couldn’t be friends with a man who had such feelings for her.

This person was Mo Yesi’s brother.

Hence, even if she really hurt Gong Zeli, she had no other choice.

She hoped that he would give up on her.

Just as he said, with his status, he didn’t have to be so humble.

In the future, a girl suitable for him would definitely appear.

…

Qiao Mianmian returned to the ward.

Father Qiao watched her enter alone. After a while, he asked, “Where’s Young Master Gong?”

“He’s gone.” Qiao Mianmian walked to the bed and picked up the cup on the bedside table. “Dad, are you thirsty? I’ll get you some water.”

Father Qiao nodded.

Qiao Mianmian turned around to get a glass of water. “Dad, it’s a little hot. Drink slowly.”

Father Qiao looked up at her and took a sip.

After drinking some water, Father Qiao placed the glass on the cabinet.
