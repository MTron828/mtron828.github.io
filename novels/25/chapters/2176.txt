Chapter 2178: Three Women Make a Scene

The sudden discussion in the crowd pulled Yan Shaoqing out of his depression.

He looked towards the entrance of the hall when he heard that Shen Rou was the topic of discussion.

Shen Rou was dressed to the nines. She was wearing a limited-edition black tube top dress with a fork at the end, revealing her long and slender legs.

Her jewelry was expensive and her makeup exquisite.

Shen Rou was pretty.

She was also known as a beauty in the upper-class society.

Shen Rou used to be the center of attention at all events.

But after the Shen family fell, she rarely appeared in these events.

Now that they were out of danger and she had become the glamorous Young Lady Shen again, she naturally had to attend these banquets again.

It was fine if Shen Rou didn’t appear.

As long as she appeared, she would be the center of attention.

She wanted to beat all the other socialites.

And she really did it.

In the entire hall, Shen Rou was the most outstanding woman.

All eyes were on her.

The men were stunned.

The women were envious and jealous.

This Shen Rou used to steal their limelight.

When they saw that the Shen family had fallen and Shen Rou had also fallen from her goddess’s pedestal, they were secretly overjoyed.

But now, Shen Rou was showing off again.

Three women made a scene.

Moreover, there were so many women today.

And most of these women were once jealous of Shen Rou.

Hence, when they saw that all the men’s eyes were on Shen Rou, they couldn’t help but feel jealous. “Haha, Miss Shen is still the same as before. Many men come whenever she attends a banquet, and she dresses as if she’s going to a national banquet. Does she want all the men’s eyes to be on her alone?”

“Exactly. She’s dressed like that just to attract men’s attention.”

“It’s a pity that no matter how pretty she dresses up, the man she pines for doesn’t like her back. Have you heard? Second Young Master Mo found a girlfriend in the entertainment industry. I heard that she’s pretty, prettier than Shen Rou.”

“She’s definitely prettier than Shen Rou. Otherwise, why wouldn’t Second Young Master Mo choose Shen Rou?”

“I wonder if the Mo family will come tonight. If Second Young Master Mo brings his girlfriend along, how nice it’ll be.” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

The group of women gathered together and spoke sourly.

They suddenly lowered their voices.

“Stop it, Shen Rou seems to have heard us talking about her. She’s here.”

“So be it. Are you afraid of her?” The other woman said as if she wasn’t afraid of anything, but when she saw Shen Rou really walking towards them, she lowered her voice.

They looked a little flustered as Shen Rou approached.

They thought that Shen Rou heard them talking about her.

But Shen Rou walked past them.

“Shaoqing.” Shen Rou stopped in front of Yan Shaoqing and greeted him. “Are you here for the banquet, too?”
