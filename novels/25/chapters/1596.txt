Gong Zeli’s identity was originally a hot topic. With the label “rich second-generation heir hitting someone”, the topic was immediately brought up.

Moreover, Qiao Mianmian was involved.

She had been appearing on the hot searches recently, so she was easily noticed.

Moreover, Gong Zeli hit someone because of her.

They already caused a scandal in the past, so this attracted even more attention.

A so-called insider revealed that Gong Zeli hit someone because of Qiao Mianmian. He even said that Gong Zeli was crazy and everyone in the room was shocked by him. No one dared to stop him, and it was Qiao Mianmian who managed to stop him.

“Do you know that with Young Master Gong’s personality, no one dared to hold him back when he got angry? But Qiao Mianmian pulled him back and told him not to fight anymore. And he really stopped.”

“Thinking about the rumors between the two of them in the past, and after clarifying that they were friends, I feel that there might really be something between them. Anyway, Gong Zeli’s reaction is like his woman was bullied, not just because of friendship.”

“Gong Zeli is too scary in the video. Did he relapse? Did he kill that person?”

“I think so too. He could have killed him.”

“Too scary. Although he’s handsome and rich, no one dares to marry him. If I marry him, will I be beaten to death because of some fight in the future? I’m afraid of death. No matter how good this man is, I’ll stay away.”

“Why did no one stop him? Everyone just watched.”

“Didn’t someone say they were all shocked? He doesn’t have much rationality during his relapses, right? What if they went to help and got hit?”

“I feel like Gong Zeli was too agitated. He really doesn’t seem like an ordinary friend. Previously, I thought that he and Qiao Mianmian had an ambiguous relationship, but now it seems like...”

“Gong Zeli and Qiao Mianmian’s boyfriend know each other, right? If he has an ambiguous relationship with Qiao Mianmian, wouldn’t he be stealing his buddy’s girlfriend?”

The two trending topics #Gong Zeli Hits Someone and #Qiao Mianmian and Gong Zeli’s ambiguous relationship got higher and higher on the trending list. Soon, they reached the top three trending topics in 24 hours.
