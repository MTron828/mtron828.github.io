The man’s expression changed when he saw Shangguan Qing standing in the office.

“Why are you here? Who let you up?” Gong Zeli’s cold voice was laced with anger.

Shangguan Qing was stunned. She glanced at his expression and felt a little guilty.

“Brother Zeli, can’t I come and see you?” She bit her lip and sounded aggrieved. “I thought you must be working hard at the company, so I personally made some soup and brought it over.

“This is my first time cooking.”

At this point, Shangguan Qing felt even more aggrieved.

“In order to make soup for you, I even scalded my fingers.” As she spoke, she showed the blisters on her fair fingers. “Brother Zeli, these blisters hurt. But for you, it’s all worth it.

“Brother Zeli, this is my first time cooking. Try this soup. How does it taste? I’ll get you a bowl, alright?”

Shangguan Qing thought about what Madam Gong said, that Gong Zeli liked gentle and virtuous women, so she wanted to show this side to him.

She ignored Gong Zeli’s dark expression and walked to the desk, putting the lunch box down.

Just as she was about to open it, she heard an extremely cold voice. “Take your things and leave my office.”

Shangguan Qing looked up in shock. “Brother Zeli.”

Gong Zeli’s expression was extremely cold. “You didn’t hear me clearly? Do you want me to say it again? Leave—my—office—immediately

.”

“Brother Zeli.” Shangguan Qing widened her eyes in shock. “I-I came especially to see you.”

“Shangguan Qing.” Gong Zeli looked annoyed. “I thought I made myself clear, and you should know it too. It seems like I have to tell you again.

“I don’t care what the Gong family and your Shangguan family think. I will never listen to them. I won’t marry anyone unless it’s the woman I choose. I’m not interested in you. You’re not my type.

“No matter what you do, it won’t change anything.

“So, I advise you not to do these meaningless things anymore. I don’t want to make things too ugly. Don’t look for me again, and I won’t see you again. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“You can leave now.”

Shangguan Qing looked at him in disbelief.

“Brother Zeli, is what you said true? You really... don’t like me?”

But Madam Gong had said that she was his type.

Gong Zeli’s eyes were cold and distant. “I’m not interested in you. Don’t waste your time on me. It’s meaningless.”

Afraid that she would continue to pester him, Gong Zeli decided to not leave her any hope. He said coldly, “I have a woman I like. Besides her, I won’t marry another woman. She’s the only woman in my heart, and I can’t tolerate another woman. Shangguan Qing, you’re not bad yourself. Find a man suitable for you and stop wasting your time on me.”

With that, he called his assistant in.

“Send Miss Shangguan out. Also, inform the Human Resources Department and the Finance Department that all the front desk employees have been dismissed. If anyone dares to let anyone up again, fire them immediately.”

Gong Zeli didn’t look at Shangguan Qing anymore and went back to work.
