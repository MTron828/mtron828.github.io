Chapter 844: Like a Crazy Woman

Even an unattainable man like Gong Zeli was successfully seduced by her.

Without this face...

Or was she going to be able to seduce a man if she lost her looks?

As this thought came to Qiao Anxin’s mind, she reached out to grab Qiao Mianmian’s face.

She wanted to tear her face apart.

What right did Qiao Mianmian have to seduce so many men?

It was all because of her face.

Thankfully, Qiao Mianmian took a step back in time.

Otherwise, her face would be ruined.

Qiao Anxin then went even crazier.

“Qiao Mianmian, hand over the recording!” She tried to snatch Qiao Mianmian’s cell phone away again and pounced on her. She looked like she wanted to fight it out with her.

Qiao Mianmian was a little shocked and took a few steps back. “Qiao Anxin, are you crazy! I told you, I didn’t record it. Don’t come over. Otherwise, don’t blame me for being nasty.”

But Qiao Anxin wouldn’t listen to her. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

She stared at Qiao Mianmian’s cell phone and tried to snatch it away.

Qiao Mianmian took a few more steps back and only stopped when she had nowhere to go.

The moment she stopped, Qiao Anxin pounced on her. “Give me the cell phone, there must be a recording!”

Qiao Mianmian couldn’t take it anymore. Just as she was about to make a move, Su Ze quickly walked over and pulled Qiao Anxin away.

He glared at her, his eyes full of disgust. “Are you crazy? Didn’t Mianmian already say that she didn’t record it? Do you know what you look like right now? Like a crazy woman. Aren’t you afraid of being seen and posted online?

“Qiao Anxin, you’re still a signed artiste under Star Splendor. Watch your image!”

Qiao Anxin had always been gentle and obedient in front of him.

This was what Su Ze wanted too. He felt that he needed an obedient woman so that she wouldn’t cause trouble for him.

Qiao Anxin wasn’t as pretty as Qiao Mianmian.

But he felt good about a gentle and obedient woman.

He didn’t like women with too much personality.

That would make it difficult for him to master her.

Back then, he didn’t think that Qiao Anxin’s gentleness was all an act.

Hence, he was shocked by her actions now.

This was completely different from the Qiao Anxin he knew.

But he quickly realized that this might be Qiao Anxin’s true side.

A person’s personality couldn’t change so drastically all of a sudden.

It wouldn’t be strange if that was her personality.

Su Ze was furious at the thought of being deceived by her for so many years.

He actually broke up with Qiao Mianmian because of this woman. Was he blind back then?

Why couldn’t he tell that she was faking it?

Not only was she pretending, but even her pregnancy was fake.

Especially the latter, which made Su Ze feel like a fool.

He used to be so satisfied with Qiao Anxin, but now he hated this woman.

“What did you say?!” Qiao Anxin tried to snatch Qiao Mianmian’s cell phone away from Su Ze, but her arm was held tightly by him.
