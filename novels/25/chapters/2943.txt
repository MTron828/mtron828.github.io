Translator: Atlas StudiosEditor: Atlas Studios

“Tang Wangqiu?” Mo Shixiu was stunned. He found the name familiar.

“The woman who saved your father 20 years ago.”

Mo Shixiu remembered her now.

They knew about what happened 20 years ago. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

He had heard of Tang Wanqiu.

This woman saved his father and had a relationship with him.

“Tang Ya approached the Mo family, got close to you, and took Yueyue away because of Tang Wanqiu?” Mo Shixiu quickly connected the dots. “Her surname is also Tang. Who is she to Tang Wanqiu?”

“I don’t know, but… she must be very close to her.”

Mo Yesi also received a call from Madam Mo, and she also told him about Tang Ya’s request for Mo Yunchen to go alone. She also told him about Tang Wangiu.

At the same time, he received a call from Father Mo asking him and Mo Shixiu not to look for Tang Ya.

But whether it was Mo Shixiu or Mo Yesi, they couldn’t do as he said.

Mo Yesi called Mo Shixiu. “Brother, did Mom call you? Did she tell you that Dad is going to look for Tang Ya alone?”

“Mm, she did.”

“Then, your plan is…”

“Dad can’t go alone. He’ll be in danger,” Mo Shixiu replied. “I suspect that Tang Ya might be Tang Wangiu’s daughter. If that’s the case, she feels that Dad has let her mother down and wants to stand up for her.

“The person she’s targeting is Dad.”

“ve checked on Tang Ya. She’s most likely Tang Wangiu’s daughter.” Mo Yesi immediately decided. “Then, we’ll rush over now.”

Mo Yesi and Mo Shixiu arrived at the same time.

Two minutes later.

Two extremely handsome and elegant men stood downstairs of a villa, their expressions equally grave.

They had just seen Father Mo’s car.

Obviously, Father Mo found Tang Ya before them.

He must have met Tang Ya already.

“You’re really bold to come alone. You’re from the Mo family, indeed.”

Tang Ya made a pot of tea for herself. The tea was just done. She poured a cup of tea and took two sips from the jade porcelain cup. Then, she looked up at Mo Yunchen.

The moment her gaze landed on him, her grip on the teacup tightened. Although her expression didn’t change, her eyes flickered.

Mo Yunchen wasn’t young anymore, but in the eyes of many girls, he was still a rather charming and handsome mature uncle.

Even though he was over 50 years old, his temperament and looks were still outstanding.

It wasn’t hard to see how outstanding he was when he was young.

After meeting him in person, Tang Ya finally understood why her mother was so obsessed with him,

She met a stunning man when she was young and had a romantic relationship with him. From then on, she couldn’t look at anyone else.

It was this man who ruined her mother’s life.

Tang Ya’s eyes were filled with hatred as she recalled what her mother did before she died.

Although her mother told her that what happened back then wasn’t Mo Yunchen’s fault and she didn’t hate him, Tang Ya still couldn’t forgive this man who ruined her mother’s life..
