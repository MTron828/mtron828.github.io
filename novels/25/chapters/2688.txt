She looked at her cold husband and then at the old lady beside him. A few seconds later, she suddenly sneered. Retreating, she gritted her teeth and said, “Alright, are you and your son going to work together to deal with me?

“I can tell that I’m an extra in this house now. You guys can’t wait for me to leave, right?

“Old Madam despises me, my two sons despise me, and now even my husband despises me!”

Mo Yunchen frowned. “Wenpei, I don’t despise you. What’s wrong with you? Why are you saying this?”

“Ha.” Madam Mo sneered. “I heard what you said. Mo Yunchen, you regret marrying me. Do you think I can’t tell?

“I’m doing this for the good of this family. I don’t want my son to marry a useless woman. Did I do something wrong! Jiang Luoli is a jinx. If it wasn’t for her, Shixiu wouldn’t have withdrawn from this year’s elections! He could have been chosen to be the president this year! She’s the one who harmed Shixiu and the entire Mo family. She’s a jinx. As long as she’s in this family, we won’t have a day of peace!

“Why are you all protecting that jinx? Have you all been tricked by her!

“Alright, my good intentions have been treated as ill intentions by you! Now, you all want to deal with me for that jinx. I can’t stay in this family anymore. Since you don’t want to see me and think that I ruined the family’s harmony, I’ll leave now!

“But Mo Yunchen, don’t be happy too soon. Even if I don’t stay in the Mo family, I won’t let you marry the vixen outside!” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Mo Yunchen was speechless as he looked at his wife who had lost her rationality.

He had never seen his wife so unreasonable and terrifying.

This was his wife, but Mo Yunchen felt that she was so foreign.

They’d lived together for decades, but he suddenly realized that he didn’t know her well enough.

He always thought that she was gentle, elegant, and weak…

She was so weak that she needed to rely on her husband to survive.

Mo Yunchen felt that his wife was a weak and beautiful flower.

But he didn’t expect that she would become a tigress one day.

“You’re all protecting that jinx now. Just wait and see, you’ll regret it one day! You’ll know that I’m right, you’ll regret treating me like this!”

Madam Mo turned and ran out of the hall after saying that.

Mo Yunchen was stunned for a few seconds before remembering to chase after her.

But Old Madam stopped him.

“Yunchen, let her go.”

Mo Yunchen hesitated. “But Wenpei isn’t safe outside. She can’t take good care of herself.”

Old Madam sneered. “Do you still think your wife is weak and easy to bully? Don’t worry, this isn’t the first time she left home. She’s Madam Mo, she won’t suffer anywhere.

“There’s nothing unsafe about having bodyguards protecting her.

“If she wants to leave, let her go.. When she’s alone for a while, she might be able to figure it out. I hope she’ll suffer a little so that she can recognize herself! She won’t be so unreasonable then!”
