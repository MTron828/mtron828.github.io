Chapter 1628: Mo Yesi’s Feelings

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

She knew that Mo Yesi would react to her intimate act with Qin Han.

But she didn’t expect him to make such a request.

He would be Qin Han’s substitute!

Was he serious?

Qiao Mianmian looked at him in shock. “Mo Yesi, don’t joke around. You’re Qin Han’s substitute? But you don’t know how to act.”

“I’m not.”

The man looked down at her seriously. “I’ve seen the scene, I think I can do it.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

“But...”

“Since Mr. Mo is willing to be my substitute, I can’t ask for more.” Qin Han suddenly said, “Then, according to Mr. Mo’s wishes, Mr. Mo will complete the next scene for me. I don’t have any problems here. Mianmian, what do you think?”

Qin Han felt Mo Yesi’s hostility towards him.

Now, he was sure that Mo Yesi was really hostile towards him.

He must have known that it was going to be an intimate scene between him and Qiao Mianmian.

That was why he made such a request.

He was a possessive man.

But Qin Han could understand.

Mo Yesi wasn’t from their circle, so it was normal that he couldn’t accept his girlfriend acting intimate with another man.

If it was him.

If it was someone he liked, even if he knew it was for work, he would mind. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Hence, Qin Han was a little surprised by Mo Yesi’s request, but he quickly understood.

On the contrary, Qiao Mianmian felt embarrassed.

She looked at Qin Han apologetically. “Brother Han...”

Qiao Mianmian didn’t want to affect the progress of the entire crew because of her.

But Mo Yesi’s actions would definitely affect it.

Qiao Mianmian had a terrible headache.

She didn’t know what to do with him.

He would get angry again if she talked about him.

“Mianmian, it’s alright with me,” Qin Han said magnanimously. “I think we’ll do as Mr. Mo says. Since he says it’s fine, it should be fine. Let him try it. It won’t take too much time.”

“Mr. Mo.” Qin Han turned to Mo Yesi. “Shall we change now?”

Mo Yesi kept quiet and looked down at Qiao Mianmian.

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

What else could she say?

She knew Mo Yesi too well.

If she didn’t agree, she probably wouldn’t be able to coax him for a month.

Qin Han and Bai Yusheng had agreed, and she was the only one against it. It seemed like she really wanted to shoot that intimate scene with Qin Han.

“Go ahead.” Qiao Mianmian had no choice but to compromise.

Mo Yesi nodded at Qin Han and followed him to the changing room.

...

A moment later, Mo Yesi changed into Qin Han’s clothes.

He was about the same height as Qin Han, about the same weight, and about the same hairstyle.

Without looking at his face, his back view was really similar to Qin Han’s.

Bai Yusheng stared at Mo Yesi for a few seconds before giving him a thumbs up.

Because he didn’t want his wife to film an intimate scene with another actor, he actually did it himself.

Besides Mo Yesi, there was probably no one else.

Seeing how much he cared about Qiao Mianmian, Bai Yusheng felt that he had nothing to worry about.

It seemed like Mo Yesi had put in much effort.
