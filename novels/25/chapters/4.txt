Chapter 5: I’m Sorry, Mianmian

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

With that slap, a red mark in the shape of a hand appeared on Qiao Anxin’s pretty face.

The slap shocked Qiao Anxin.

She held a hand to her cheek as a look of disbelief emerged on her face. When she snapped back to her senses, she lifted her arm, all ready to return the slap.

Then, a familiar figure appeared in the corner of her eye. She hurriedly retracted her hand and pretended to stagger backward.

Qiao Mianmian had not understood what was going on, but her sister suddenly looked afraid, even traumatized, as she looked at her. “Sister, I’m sorry, I know I’m in the wrong. But I can’t control my feelings, I really love Brother Ah Ze. Sister, please forgive me, please don’t hurt my child.”

She looked like she was about to fall to the ground. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Out of the blue, the door was pushed open swiftly as a man dashed in. “Anxin!”

The man hurriedly held Qiao Anxin tightly.

“Anxin, are you alright?”

The man was Su Ze.

Qiao Anxin leaned on him and looked up with teary eyes. She then called out in the most pitiful manner, “Brother Ah Ze.”

“I’m so afraid. Our baby almost...”

She began trembling as she spoke, and tears now rolled down her cheeks. “Brother Ah Ze, I know I’ve let Sister down, and I won’t dare expect nor ask for her forgiveness. She can scold or even hit me and I’d be willing to take all of it. But our baby is innocent! How could she...”

Qiao Anxin’s cheek was still swollen from the hit.

The handprint had not faded.

Even her eyes were swollen.

She seemed so startled by what had just happened as she shivered in his embrace.

Su Ze’s heart went out to her as he saw how terrified she looked.

When he turned around to face Qiao Mianmian, his face was lined with despise and disappointment. “Qiao Mianmian, the baby Anxin is carrying is only about a month old. This is the most unstable period. Given the way you shoved her, if she really did fall to the ground, do you know what the consequences would be?”

“I always thought you were kind and gentle, why have you become so vicious!”

“I’m vicious?”

Qiao Mianmian felt herself sway as she stared at the man in disbelief.

He was clad in a full white outfit. This handsome, charismatic man was like a prince.

This face, she’d admired for so many years.

But at this point, this face seemed all too foreign and unrecognizable.

She was his fiancée.

They had known each other for 10 whole years!

And yet he instantly chose to believe Qiao Anxin’s words.

10 years... was that all there was to his trust towards her?

In Su Ze’s eyes, she was just a vicious woman!

Seeing the way he held Qiao Anxin tightly in his arms, and how differently he looked at her, her heart went cold as disappointment filled her eyes. “Su Ze, have you forgotten whose fiancé you are? And who the woman in your arms is?”
