Chapter 932: Mo Yesi’s Such a Spendthrift

She went to the hospital every day, so it was easy to expose it.

Just as Linda said, if Tu Yilei’s fans knew that she was the reason for his injury, she would probably be attacked by them.

Most importantly, she didn’t want to give Tu Yilei any hope.

After confirming that Tu Yilei had feelings for her, she thought of keeping a distance from him.

But he was injured because of her, and it seemed too unkind of her to keep a distance from him.

But with him having such feelings for her, it was easy for him to have other thoughts when she went to the hospital to take care of him every day.

Hence, getting Mo Yesi to follow her to the hospital was the best solution.

And Mo Yesi knew that he was going to the hospital today, so he deliberately left so many hickeys on her neck. So childish.

But this wasn’t the first time Qiao Mianmian found out that he was childish.

Hence, she was used to it.

Whenever Mo Yesi became childish, she was 100% sure that he was jealous.

Qiao Mianmian went straight to the dining room after washing up.

Mo Yesi had already brought out all of his breakfast. The table was full of her favorite dishes.

“Come here.” He waved at her.

After Qiao Mianmian sat down, he placed a bowl of seafood porridge before her. “Have some porridge first to warm your stomach. Then, eat something else.”

“Oh.”

Qiao Mianmian was hungry. She took a spoonful of the porridge.

Her appetite was whetted after just one bite.

The seafood porridge Mo Yesi bought was especially fresh. It was made from fresh seafood, so the taste was especially strong.

He was such a picky person. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

If it wasn’t the freshest, he definitely wouldn’t want it.

Qiao Mianmian ate half a bowl in one go.

Mo Yesi saw that she had been eating porridge, so he picked up some other dishes and placed them in her bowl. “Don’t just eat porridge. Try this dumpling, it tastes pretty good too. And this bun, I heard the store has been open for over 50 years. When I went to buy it, there were a lot of people in the queue.”

Qiao Mianmian couldn’t help but look up at him. “You queued up to buy this bun? How long did you queue for?”

She couldn’t imagine Mo Yesi standing in line outside a bun shop.

It didn’t seem like his style.

“No.” The man placed a bun in her bowl and took a sip of the milk before saying calmly, “I cut the queue and got the boss to sell it to me first.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless. “... Cough, cough, cough, did you cut the queue? Nobody said anything about you?”

“No.” Mo Yesi took another sip of milk and said slowly, “I gave them compensation, and they were very happy and agreed to let me be the first.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

“So, how much did you spend on this bun?”

“Not much,” Mo Yesi said casually. “Don’t bother about how much the bun cost. Try it and see how it tastes.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

She felt like the buns would cost a fortune.

Mo Yesi was such a spendthrift.

Fortunately, he was rich, so he could be wilful.

Qiao Mianmian took a bite of the breakfast that he specially bought for her.
