Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

He wouldn’t feel at ease without someone by her side.

Qiao Mianmian knew what he was worried about.

Hence, she didn’t reject his arrangement.

Moreover, she didn’t want him to worry.

She nodded. “Alright. But if you give me your bodyguards, you...”

“Of course, I don’t only have them.”

Knowing that she was worried about him, Mo Yesi’s heart warmed up. “Don’t worry about me. I’ll protect myself even if it’s for you.”

Qiao Mianmian couldn’t help but be entranced by the gentleness in his eyes.

At the set.

Mo Yesi kissed Qiao Mianmian for a while before putting her down.

She’d just gotten out of the car and had only taken a few steps when she heard footsteps approaching. She turned around and was pulled into his arms.

She looked up in confusion. “Mo Yesi, why are you...”

“Mm...”

Before she could finish her sentence, he kissed her forcefully.

Her lips were still swollen. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Her tongue was numb from the kiss in the car.

When the man kissed her again, she couldn’t help but grab his shirt collar. She straightened her jaw and let out a soft moan.

Mo Yesi kissed her deeply and forcefully.

He forced her lips apart and intertwined his tongue with hers.

This kiss was even more intense than the one in the car.

Qiao Mianmian tried to push him away.

This was the entrance of the production crew.

Someone could pass by anytime.

She didn’t want anyone to see her kissing a man here.

But the more she tried to push him away, the tighter he wrapped his arm around her waist.

“Mm, Mo Yesi...”

Qiao Mianmian started to struggle.

What was wrong with him?

Why did he suddenly...

She could feel that something was wrong with Mo Yesi.

This kiss was too strange.

But the more she tried to break free from his embrace, the stronger he got.

He even bit her lip as a form of punishment.

Qiao Mianmian frowned in pain.

There was the sound of an emergency braking.

The wheels rubbed against the ground, making a sharp sound.

Someone was here?

Qiao Mianmian panicked even more. She opened her eyes and pushed the man away.

She was a little angry and bit him on the lips.

Mo Yesi groaned in pain and finally let go of her.

Qiao Mianmian immediately pushed him away.

She covered her burning lips and glared at the man in front of her. “Mo Yesi, what are you doing? What’s wrong with you?”

The man kept quiet.

But then, he reached and pulled her into his arms again.

Qiao Mianmian struggled for a while, but he bit her ear and whispered, “Don’t move, let me hug you again.”

“Mo Yesi, you...”

Qiao Mianmian was about to ask him what was wrong, but when she saw Tu Yilei standing not too far away, she swallowed her words.

She knew it. Why did he suddenly become so strange?

Because...

He must have seen Tu Yilei a long time ago.
