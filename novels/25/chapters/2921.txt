Tang Ya then glanced at Mo Yesi.

Her words expressed her admiration for him.

Her son-in-law was excellent, which meant that her daughter had good taste and married well. Hearing this, Mother Bai smiled in satisfaction. “Yesi is good, you’re good too. You’re both very outstanding people.”

Tang Ya also smiled. “Mianmian is also very outstanding. She’s already a popular star in the new generation at such a young age. I’ve seen the television drama that Mianmian acted in, she did very well. She’s very talented in acting.”

“Both of you are very outstanding and have your own strengths.” In Mother Bai’s heart, her daughter was naturally the best. She praised Qiao Mianmian generously. “Mianmian is indeed very talented in acting, Her brother also said that she’s very suitable as an actress.

“This child sings pretty well, too. She casually recorded two songs and even won an award. Originally, your uncle and I wanted her to work at the Bai Corporation, but she only likes acting and is unwilling to go to the company. Of course, we won’t force her. Everything is up to her.

“It doesn’t matter if she likes acting or singing, as long as she’s happy. In the future, if she’s sick of acting, she can do whatever she wants. Anyway, our family doesn’t lack anything, so we’ll do whatever makes us happy.”

Another meaning behind Mother Bai’s words was that the Bai family did not lack money.

So, her daughter could do whatever she wanted.

Her thinking was different from Madam Mo’s.

If it were Madam Mo, she would think that it was a disgrace for her daughter-in-law to go into the entertainment industry.

Because Madam Mo despised the entertainment industry.

Even if she won the Best Actress Award, she was just a high-end actress in Madam Mo’s eyes.

‘The Bai family was also a top-notch family that had existed for several generations.

Even though Mother Bai did not think the entertainment industry was a good place, she did not discriminate against professionals.

As long as it was not something illegal like murder or arson, Mother Bai felt that it was nothing worth arguing over.

Besides, her children were both in the entertainment industry. One was a director and the other an actress. She wouldn’t discriminate against the entertainment industry.

“Mom, don’t flatter me.” Qiao Mianmian sat down on the other seat next to her and said shyly, “There are many people better than me, and my results aren’t even good enough. Even if you think your daughter is the best in the world, you should be more modest in front of so many people.”

“Okay, okay.” Mother Bai looked at her daughter dotingly. “I won’t speak anymore. Anyway, I think my daughter is the best.”

“Let’s eat.” As the head of the family, Father Bai put food into Mother Bai’s bowl. “Mianmian and Xiao Ya must be hungry. Well talk later.”

“Yes, yes, yes. Let’s eat.” Mother Bai smiled at Tang Ya and said lovingly, “I made some of my signature dishes today. Xiao Ya, have a taste.”

“Yusheng said that you don’t have any taboos, so I don’t know if these dishes are to your liking. If you find anything you don’t like, just tell me. I won’t cook it next time.”

Tang Ya picked up her chopsticks and said obediently, “Aunt, you’re such a good cook. I think every dish is delicious. I think the dishes on the table are all very good. Aunt has put ina lot of effort to make this meal. Thank you..”
