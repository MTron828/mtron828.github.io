Chapter 1362: So Explosive

The siblings chatted for a while more until Nana reminded Qiao Mianmian that the next scene was about to start filming. Qiao Mianmian then hung up.

What happened online didn’t affect her performance during filming.

With a capable senior like Qin Han leading her and the other actors Bai Yusheng found, the following shoot went smoothly.

Most scenes were shot once.

Even if there was an NG, it wouldn’t surpass three times. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Qiao Mianmian didn’t have many scenes the next day.

She finished all the scenes in half a day.

Qiao Chen’s progress was also very fast.

Not long after Qiao Mianmian was done filming, Qiao Chen sent a document to her inbox.

He told her on WeChat: [Sister, everything you need is in that document. Is it enough? If it’s not enough, tell me.]

Qiao Mianmian: [Alright, I’ll go take a look first.]

She went to read the email after replying to Qiao Chen.

She opened the email and opened the file that Qiao Chen sent her.

Not only were there photos in the compressed bag, but there were also many videos. Moreover, Qiao Chen had arranged the photos in order. Qiao Mianmian looked at the time of each photo. Even though she had no feelings for Su Ze, her eyes were still filled with anger.

Most of these photos were taken by Qiao Anxin.

Su Ze didn’t like taking photos.

But Qiao Anxin was someone who liked to show off. Hence, from the day she got together with Su Ze, she took many photos with him.

These photos were enough for Qiao Mianmian to use as evidence.

Ding!

Qiao Mianmian had just finished looking at the photos when a notification sounded.

It was from Qiao Chen.

[Sister, take a look at this unexpected gain too. You’ll be shocked.]

Qiao Mianmian opened it curiously.

When she saw the first photo, her eyes widened in shock.

A minute later, Qiao Chen sent him a message: [Sister, have you seen the email I just sent you?]

Qiao Mianmian was still in shock.

She looked down at the dozens of photos in the email again.

Qiao Chen: [Sister? Are you busy?]

This time, Qiao Mianmian finally recovered a little. She closed the email and replied to Qiao Chen’s WeChat: [I’m not busy now. I was looking at the email you sent me. Chen Chen, where did you get those photos?]

Qiao Chen: [Sister, I saw the video of Lin Huizhen’s interview. She defamed you so badly in the video, of course I can’t let her off. I thought that since I’ve already gotten Qiao Anxin’s photos, I might as well see if she has anything useful. I didn’t expect it to be so explosive. I seriously suspect that Qiao Anxin isn’t Dad’s biological daughter. She looks so similar to the man in the photo.]

Qiao Mianmian thought about the man’s appearance in the photo and kept quiet for a while before replying, [Qiao Chen, no matter what the truth is, don’t let Dad know first. He’s not in good health now. I’m worried that if he finds out... he’ll be angry.]

Qiao Chen: [Mm, I know. I won’t tell him now. But Lin Huizhen can’t keep Dad in the dark about what she did. It’s unfair to him.]

Qiao Mianmian: [Of course I have to tell him, but now isn’t the time. Let’s wait for a while more.]
