Chapter 698: I’ll Probably Lose Interest in It in a Few Days

This aura wasn’t present in many actors.

Even though her acting skills weren’t as good as Huang Yilin and the rest, the aura she exuded was already very attractive.

Bai Yusheng got excited as he watched her act.

On the day of the audition, he had taken a liking to Qiao Mianmian’s looks and the aura she exuded.

He felt that her looks were very similar to the third female lead in the book.

Hence, he decided on her without even seeing her acting skills.

He trusted his judgment.

Some people were born to be actors.

This was the first time he saw Qiao Mianmian.

As it turned out, he was right.

Qiao Mianmian didn’t have too many scenes as the third female lead.

After her scenes were done, Bai Yusheng went to look for the scriptwriter. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Huang Yilin found out about this very quickly.

In the van.

Huang Yilin was so angry that she pushed the fruit her assistant brought over and slammed her cell phone on the ground.

She clenched her fists and bit her lip. “That vixen! Director Bai has never done anything like this for a female artiste. How could he let the scriptwriter...

“Why should he?

“She’s just a third female lead. Is Director Bai trying to make her the female lead?”

Actually, Huang Yilin already felt threatened when she was acting with Qiao Mianmian yesterday.

It was just a few minutes.

Speaking of which, the performance wasn’t too difficult.

But Qiao Mianmian was a newbie, and yet she managed to get past it in one go. This was enough to show the problems.

Bai Yusheng was a very demanding person.

No matter how simple a scene was, it wouldn’t be easy for them.

Under normal circumstances, Qiao Mianmian would NG at least three times.

Today’s scene would be a test of their acting skills and time.

Huang Yilin could feel Qiao Mianmian’s acting better when she was acting with her.

To her, Qiao Mianmian’s acting wasn’t particularly good. Moreover, she made a few mistakes today, and it wasn’t as bad as yesterday.

But Huang Yilin still felt threatened.

Qiao Mianmian was still a newbie.

It was normal to make mistakes and performances that weren’t mature enough.

But it wasn’t normal for her to see that aura in a newcomer.

She knew very well what Qiao Mianmian’s magical energy meant.

“Sister Yilin, calm down. No matter how much Director Bai favors her, he can’t possibly let her surpass you. She must have used a trick to get Director Bai to add scenes for her. Director Bai must have been left with no choice.

“Director Bai will be sick of a woman like her in a few days. By then, Sister Yilin, you can do whatever you want to her.”

Huang Yilin looked up at her assistant. “Director Bai will get sick of her in a few days?”

“Of course.” The assistant smiled and said, “Think about it, how many men would like a woman who takes the initiative to ask for something? She only managed to catch Director Bai’s eye because of her pretty face.

“But how fresh can a woman be with just her looks? Especially a picky man like Director Bai, he’ll probably become disinterested after a few days.”
