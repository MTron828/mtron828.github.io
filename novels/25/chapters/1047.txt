Chapter 1048: I’m Scared Everytime You Act Like This

“Yes.” Linda nodded. “That woman seems to be Su Ze’s new partner. Initially, Su Ze refused to let go of Mianmian and kept pestering her. But his new partner mistook it for Mianmian clinging onto Su Ze, so she made a move. When she suddenly rushed over, we didn’t have time to react.”

Linda hated Su Ze to the core.

Hence, if she could bring him down, she wouldn’t be merciful.

Seeing that Mo Yesi’s expression was getting colder and darker, she added fuel to the fire. “Su Ze is really shameless. Back then, he betrayed Mianmian and broke up with her. Now, he actually wants to go back and harass Mianmian again and again. Mr. Mo, you don’t know how disgusting he is. He said so many things to insult Mianmian.

“But he was also slapped in the face by Young Master Gong. In front of Young Master Gong, he was as cowardly as a grandson. He didn’t even dare to let out a single fart. It was so satisfying to see him like that, hahaha.”

“Young Master Gong, are you talking about Gong Zeli? He was here just now?” Mo Yesi frowned.

“Yes, Young Master Gong...” Linda stopped mid-sentence.

She realized that she’d said something she shouldn’t have.

“Erm... Mr. Mo, Mianmian, I have something to attend to, so I’ll take my leave first. I won’t disturb your time together.” Linda felt the man’s pressure getting lower and lower, and decided to leave first.

“Mianmian, call me if you need anything.” Linda made a hand gesture and then got a cab.

Mo Yesi’s expression was still dark.

Qiao Mianmian stood beside him and felt his cold aura. She bit her lip and hesitated for a while before tugging his sleeve. “Are you still angry? Is it because of Su Ze? I didn’t expect to meet him here.”

Mo Yesi looked at her coldly. “You think I’m angry because of Su Ze?”

“Isn’t it?” Qiao Mianmian touched her swollen face and looked up at his face. After hesitating for a few seconds, she asked softly, “Or are you angry because I was hit?”

Mo Yesi pursed his lips and didn’t say anything. His gaze landed on the place where she was hit, and his eyes darkened.

“Mo Yesi, y-you have to talk to me.” Qiao Mianmian tugged his sleeve again. “Why are you angry? Tell me.

“I feel afraid every time you look like this.”

“I’m not angry at you.” Mo Yesi sighed and turned around to hug her.

He caressed her cheek gently and carefully. “I was just thinking that I wasn’t by your side when you were hurt. I didn’t protect you well and let you be bullied time and time again. I’m really not a good husband.” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“It’s not your fault.” Qiao Mianmian hugged him too. “And I returned the slap. Don’t worry, I won’t let myself suffer.”

“But you were slapped.” Mo Yesi recalled what Linda told and said coldly, “How can you just return a slap? I’ll make that woman pay.”
