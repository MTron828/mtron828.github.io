Chapter 1242: The Results Could Not Be Wrong

“Alright.”

Mo Yesi narrowed his eyes and kept quiet for a few seconds before saying, “Chen Chen, this has something to do with your background.”

“It has something to do with my background?” Qiao Chen was confused. “Sister, what does Brother-in-law mean?”

“Chen Chen, you...” Qiao Mianmian took a deep breath. When she calmed down a little, she met his gaze and thought for a while before telling him directly, “Do you remember that day when we went to your brother-in-law’s house, there was an uncle who looked like you?”

Qiao Chen replied, “I remember.”

It was because he looked like him that he had a deep impression of him.

Qiao Mianmian kept quiet for a while before continuing, “Chen Chen, he’s actually... your biological father.”

Seeing Qiao Chen’s shocked and widened eyes, Mo Yesi gently patted the back of Qiao Mianmian’s hand and said the following words for her, “Chen Chen, I’m sorry to hide something from you. The person you saw that day was my Second Uncle. He once had a son, but he was carried away not long after he was born. His whereabouts were unknown.

“All these years, my Second Uncle has looked for him, but it’s undoubtedly as difficult as finding a needle in a haystack.

“And the reason why that child was taken away was because of some internal strife. He was taken away by a bad person, so our family didn’t have much hope for that child. Everyone thought that he might have passed away long ago.

“When I brought you back that day, Grandma realized that you looked very similar to Second Uncle. You’re also about the same age as Second Uncle’s missing son. Grandma got suspicious and asked me to investigate something.

“Chen Chen.” Mo Yesi looked at Qiao Chen’s expression of disbelief and paused. “My men found out that you were carried back by the Qiao family from the orphanage. Also, without your knowledge, I took your hair and did a paternity test with Second Uncle.

“The results show that you’re father and son.”

Mo Yesi looked at Qiao Mianmian.

Qiao Mianmian took out the report from her bag.

She looked at Qiao Chen with a complicated gaze. With concern and worry in her eyes, she handed the report over. “Chen Chen, this is the report. Take a look.”

Qiao Chen looked at her in shock and then looked down at the report in her hand.

After a while, he slowly reached out and took the report.

A moment later.

Qiao Mianmian looked at Qiao Chen’s trembling fingers.

She and Mo Yesi didn’t say anything as they waited for him to finish reading.

Qiao Chen should have seen it already.

But from his reaction, he couldn’t accept this fact.

After a few minutes, Qiao Chen slowly looked up and finally reacted. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“Sister, so, we aren’t siblings?” Qiao Chen’s eyes were a little red as he clenched his fists.

“Chen Chen, whether we’re related by blood or not, you’re my biological brother in my heart. You will always be,” Qiao Mianmian said word by word.

Qiao Chen pursed his lips and looked down at the paternity test again.

It was written clearly.

The results couldn’t be wrong.
