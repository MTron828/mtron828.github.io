Chapter 2145: Hatred from Love Is the Most Terrifying

“Then, who is my biological father? What kind of person is he?”

“Your biological father…” Lin Huizhen’s expression changed as she hesitated. “He, he’s not a very impressive person. He’s just an ordinary person. If, if you want to meet him, I can arrange it.”

Qiao Anxin’s expression darkened when she heard that.

When Lin Huizhen was done, she said coldly, “I don’t want to see him. It’ll only make me feel ashamed.”

Lin Huizhen’s face turned pale. “But, but no matter what, he’s still your biological father. How can you say that?”

“Why can’t I!” Qiao Anxin looked up, her eyes full of hatred and disgust. “Did I beg you to give birth to me? Why aren’t you people as good as Qiao Mianmian’s biological parents? Her biological parents could make her a rich young lady and have everything. But mine?

“My biological mother doesn’t know anything, and my biological father is just an ordinary person. What have you brought to me as parents? Besides humiliating me, embarrassing me, and needing my help when in trouble, what else have you done for me? If it wasn’t for you messing around outside, would I be mocked by the entire Internet now?”

Lin Huizhen’s face turned pale.

“Anxin, it’s not like that…”

“Enough, I don’t want to hear anything more from you.” Qiao Anxin interrupted her angrily. “The situation is already so terrible, what do you want me to do! I’m about to die, do you know that!”

Qiao Anxin yelled at her mother.

Lin Huizhen was so aggrieved that she didn’t dare to say a word.

Just then, Qiao Anxin’s cell phone rang.

She picked it up, and after a while, her expression turned ugly.

After answering the call, she sat on the bed.

Lin Huizhen asked softly, “What’s wrong?”

Qiao Anxin kept quiet.

After a few seconds, she looked up with a despairing gaze. “Just force me to death. They’re all asking me to terminate the contract. They’re all asking me to pay the compensation fee. Where do I get so much money? Are they trying to force me to death?”

“Compensation fee?” Lin Huizhen’s expression changed when she heard that. “Why do we have to pay the compensation fee? How much?” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

The mother and daughter were currently staying in a hotel.

Qiao Anxin had spent all her money.

Because of the negative news, she had to pay a lot of compensation.

That time, she was practically emptied.

After her comeback, she took on some commercials and even went on variety shows. But because her popularity after her comeback wasn’t as good as before, the compensation she received was less than half. Hence, she hadn’t earned much money since her comeback.

All the money she earned was used to repay her debts.

She didn’t have the money to compensate for the breach of contract.

There was a huge pile of termination advertisements and compensation waiting for her. She was in the limelight now and couldn’t get a new job. With all the scolding online, Qiao Anxin completely broke down.

“Why do I have to pay the compensation fee? It’s all because of Qiao Mianmian!” Qiao Anxin gritted her teeth. “That slut ruined my reputation and made me a hated figure. Who would want to work with someone with a negative image!”
