Chapter 477: Was He Really Ignoring Her?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Did Qiao Anxin have a secret that even Su Ze didn’t know about?

Qiao Mianmian didn’t really have the mood to continue singing after Linda left.

She was considering Linda’s invitation.

She logged into Weibo, saw Star Splendor’s public declaration, and was shocked by Su Ze and Qiao Anxin’s shamelessness.

Qiao Mianmian actually knew how horrid they were.

But she was still shocked by that level of shamelessness.

It was limitless.

Star Splendor really pushed most of the blame to Linda. They claimed that Linda was responsible for the demeaning post on the forum and had dismissed her because of it.

They even denied that Qiao Anxin came between her relationship with Su Ze.

In other words, they denied that Su Ze had cheated on her.

Star Splendor even attached their lawyer’s letter on the post and said they would sue whoever continued to defame their company and artistes.

As there wasn’t any concrete evidence of Qiao Anxin being a third party, many of her fans actually left comments supporting her once Star Splendor’s declaration was posted. They even wanted Star Splendor to find out and reveal the person behind the posts demeaning Qiao Anxin.

This would be an effective measure.

As prevention for future occurrences.

At the same time, some fans even asked for Star Splendor to get Linda back. They said that Linda was a very good manager, and she only did it because she stuck up for Qiao Anxin against her sister.

Star Splendor should not have dismissed such a good manager.

Some fans also left comments against Qiao Mianmian. They were sure that it was she who said Qiao Anxin was a third party.

They believed that Qiao Mianmian was jealous of her younger sister, who was now a top-tier artiste with a rich second-generation heir as a boyfriend. She must have been feeling upset as a newbie that no one knew about, while her sister was doing so well in her relationship and her career.

Quite a number of them said that.

Qiao Mianmian was the victim, but now she was portrayed as a scheming girl who slandered her sister out of jealousy.

Qiao Mianmian laughed in anger at these comments.

But she didn’t quite bother about these fans.

Since they were fans, it was only natural that they defended their idol no matter what. After all, this was the entertainment industry. She had to be prepared for this if she were to join it. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

If she was going to lose her temper just because of a few people saying mean things, then she’d probably die of anger someday.

The more popular one got, the more doubts and hateful comments one would receive too.

It was common.

Almost every popular artiste had been in bad light once before.

Some of them were obviously false and created for the sake of getting back at the artiste.

As such, this was also one of the reasons she didn’t really like going on Weibo. There was so much negative energy online.

Qiao Mianmian scrolled for a few minutes and then logged out from the platform of negative comments.

It had been almost three hours since she sent Mo Yesi the message.

He still hadn’t replied to her.

Neither had he called.

Qiao Mianmian opened their chat and looked at it for a while. She bit her lip, feeling a little sad and aggrieved.

Was he really ignoring her?
