Chapter 1638: He’s My Boyfriend

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Jiang Luoli kept quiet for a while before saying, “He’s my boyfriend.”

If she didn’t know how Xie Zewen felt about her, she might have chosen to hide it.

But now, she felt that it was better to tell him.

This way, he wouldn’t have any thoughts about her, and he wouldn’t have to waste time on her.

Xie Zewen guessed that Mo Shixiu and Jiang Luoli had an unusual relationship.

But he was shocked upon hearing that Mo Shixiu was Jiang Luoli’s boyfriend.

He looked incredulous.

“Mo Shixiu is your boyfriend? Luoli, are you kidding me?”

It wasn’t that he didn’t believe it, but with Mo Shixiu’s status, he was from a completely different world from Jiang Luoli.

With their social status, they would never be able to interact with people like Mo Shixiu.

It was like he lived in the sky.

And they lived underground.

How could Mo Shixiu be Jiang Luoli’s boyfriend? This was unbelievable.

How did they get together?

Jiang Luoli looked straight at him and said, “Brother Zewen, I’m not joking with you. He’s really my boyfriend. I know many people won’t believe this. It’s not convenient for me to tell you how I met him, but I won’t joke about this.”

How could Xie Zewen not know?

He knew that Jiang Luoli wouldn’t joke about this.

He just didn’t want to believe it.

If Jiang Luoli’s boyfriend was just an ordinary person, he still had a chance.

But Mo Shixiu...

How could Xie Zewen not know how outstanding this man was?

This was someone he could never surpass, no matter how hard he tried.

If Jiang Luoli’s boyfriend was Mo Shixiu, he wouldn’t stand a chance.

“Luoli, have you thought about it?” Xie Zewen kept quiet for a while before looking up. “Your status is too different from his. You... you won’t have a good outcome. Do you think he’ll marry you? Maybe his parents got someone to do this.

“He’s Mo Shixiu, one of the candidates for the next president.

“His wife must be a girl of equal social status to him. Aren’t you afraid of getting hurt when you’re with him?”

Jiang Luoli smiled. “So what if there’s no good outcome? It’s enough to be with the person you like, even if it’s difficult. Even if an ordinary person is in a relationship, it’s not guaranteed to have a good ending.

“There are many unfulfilled relationships.

“So, I don’t think there’s a need to think so much. I just want to be happy. Brother Zewen, what do you think?”

Xie Zewen looked at her, speechless.

He realized that Jiang Luoli’s eyes lit up when she talked about Mo Shixiu.

She really liked him.

Since she didn’t care about the future, what else could he say?

“Luoli, since you’ve made up your mind, then... I wish you happiness.”

“Thank you, Brother Zewen.”

Xie Zewen kept quiet for a few seconds before asking, “Did Mo Shixiu come to look for you?”

“Mm.” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“Then, are you waiting for him here?”

“Mm.”

“Alright, then y-you can wait for him here. You must be hungry after sleeping for so long. I’ll get you something to eat.

“Call me if you need anything. I’ll be outside.”
