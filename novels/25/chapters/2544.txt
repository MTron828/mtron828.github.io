Chapter 2545: God Wants Her Dead!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Some netizens noticed that Yan Shaoqing had quietly reposted Shen Xin’s post.

He even added a sentence: [Xiao Xin is a good girl, I like you.]

Lu Rao reposted it at the same time as Yan Shaoqing.

Doctor Lu is a good doctor: [I believe that Xiao Xin’s decision isn’t easy. No matter what, I’ll support you.]

None of them reposted Shen Rou’s post.

But they reposted Shen Xin’s post.

This represented their attitude.

They all thought that Shen Rou was lying.

…

Qiao Mianmian was shocked when she heard the truth from Linda.

She thought she heard wrong.

“Sister Xie, you said that Shen Xin posted on Weibo saying that Shen Rou is lying?”

“Mm, are you very shocked? When I first found out, I found it unbelievable too. I really didn’t expect a person like Shen Rou to have such a righteous sister. This time, it’s all thanks to her sister ‘placing righteousness before family’. Otherwise, Shen Rou would have been cleared of all charges.

“God wants her dead! God probably can’t stand it anymore, so He decided to teach her a lesson.

“In any case, she can forget about clearing her name. Most of the netizens believe in Shen Xin now. Moreover, a few famous verified accounts have expressed their support for Shen Xin. It won’t be easy for Shen Rou to clear her name.”

Qiao Mianmian was very surprised.

She was still thinking about how to settle this.

Unexpectedly, Shen Xin became the biggest help.

She solved the problem instantly.

Shen Xin was Shen Rou’s biological sister.

Qiao Mianmian was really surprised that she would do this.

“Oh right, let me tell you another piece of good news.” Linda seemed to be in a good mood. She smiled and said, “Do you know that Shen Rou is really unlucky this time? Not only has her reputation been ruined, but the Shen Corporation is also going to suffer with her.

“Henry Zhou was originally coming to Yuncheng City at the end of the month, but he has already canceled his itinerary. Do you know what this means? It must be because of Shen Rou’s matter that he’s unwilling to work with her after knowing her true character.

“This was the Shen family’s biggest trump card. Now, it’s gone.

“Also, the Shen Corporation’s stock price has been affected too. It has fallen a lot.

“Shen Rou must be furious now. Let’s see what excuse she’s going to give this time!” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Henry Zhou wanted to cancel his collaboration with the Shen Corporation?

This news surprised Qiao Mianmian.

Mo Yesi told her that the Shen Corporation must have something to do with Tang Ya to be able to invite Henry Zhou.

If Henry Zhou really canceled his collaboration with the Shen Corporation, what would happen to Tang Ya?

Was she not going to help Shen Rou anymore?

“Sister Xie, are you sure Henry Zhou canceled his trip to Yuncheng City?”

“I’m sure.” Linda was certain. “Moreover, the reason is definitely related to the Shen Corporation’s upcoming cooperation.

“Henry Zhou arranged for his assistant to come over for an inspection before the week ended. I’ve just received news that his assistant has decided to return to M Nation at the last minute. This also proves that the collaboration between Henry Zhou and the Shen Corporation has probably failed.

“Otherwise, his assistant wouldn’t have returned so quickly.

“She shot herself in the foot this time. If she’s not careful, the Shen Corporation might be ruined by her. I remember that the Shen Corporation’s share price kept falling, and it almost went bankrupt because of that. If the Shen Corporation goes bankrupt because of her, she’ll be a real sinner.”

Linda rambled on.

Half an hour later, the call ended.

…

Qiao Mianmian was energetic after the call.

She immediately opened Weibo and searched for Shen Xin’s post.

Shen Xin’s Weibo post had been reposted more than 200,000 times.

And the titles of the trending topics changed.

# Shen Rou’s sister exposed the truth on video #

# Shen Rou Lying #

# Shen Rou failed to clear her name #

# Exposing Best Actress Shen Rou’s True Colors #

A few minutes later.

Qiao Mianmian finished watching Shen Xin’s video.

She had mixed feelings.

Shen Xin and Shen Rou had different personalities.

This was what she knew.

Although Qiao Mianmian didn’t like Shen Rou, she wasn’t biased against Shen Xin.

On the contrary, she actually had a good impression of her.

Especially during this period, Shen Xin often went to the hospital to help take care of Qiao Chen.

She had already accepted that Qiao Chen and Shen Xin would be together.

She didn’t know if Shen Xin had chosen to step forward because of Qiao Chen, but she knew that with Shen Rou’s personality, Shen Xin would probably not have it easy in the Shen family.

Qiao Mianmian called Qiao Chen.

“Sister.” Qiao Chen picked up quickly.

Qiao Mianmian said directly, “Chen Chen, do you know that Shen Xin posted on Weibo and exposed Shen Rou’s lie? Did she tell you about this beforehand?”

“Mm, I know. Shen Xin came to see me this afternoon and told me about it.”

“Is she still with you?”

Qiao Chen was silent for a few seconds before saying, “She just went home.”

“She went home?”

“Mm.”

“Chen Chen, Shen Xin’s family will definitely be very angry about her post. Shen Rou won’t let it go so easily. She’ll definitely make a scene. Shen Xin’s life won’t be good when she gets home.”

Qiao Chen kept quiet for a few more seconds. “Mm, I know. Sister, I’ve told her that if she feels unhappy living at home, she can move out. Dad bought two properties for me. She can live anywhere she wants.

“In any case, I’ll take care of her. Even if she leaves the Shen family, she still has me.”

“Chen Chen…” Qiao Mianmian hesitated.

“Sister, what are you trying to say?”

“Chen Chen, your brother-in-law was very angry this time, so he taught the Shen Corporation a lesson. Now that the Shen Corporation’s share price has dropped drastically, and your brother-in-law lost a few big deals, the Shen Corporation might suffer a huge blow this time.

“Shen Xin will definitely know about this later. Although I don’t object to your relationship and I don’t have any objections if you two want to be together, the feud between the two families has indeed been formed. Can you really put aside this feud and continue to interact with her?”

Qiao Mianmian was worried that her brother was too deeply involved.

It would be a pity if it didn’t end well.

Qiao Chen would definitely be hurt too.

Previously, because the Mo family didn’t help and because of Shen Rou, the two families already had some grudges.

After this, the Shen family’s hatred towards the Mo family would probably deepen.
