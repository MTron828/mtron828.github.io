Chapter 84: I’ll Get Better in Time to Come

She furrowed her brows. “Then why don’t you stay home and rest for today? You’re the boss, you don’t have to go to the office every day.”

Mo Yesi’s lips curled up as he patted her on the head. “Your heart aches for me?”

She was speechless.

“There’s no need. I can’t fall asleep at home, anyway. I might as well go to work.”

“Aren’t you sleepy?”

He shook his head. “I’m not.”

No matter how little he slept, he wouldn’t feel sleepy in the day. He would just be a little less energetic and alert.

Qiao Mianmian was shocked. “You don’t feel tired even when you lose sleep?”

Each time that happened to her, she would be beat the next day.

Was there anyone else like him?

Mo Yesi shook his head. “I’ll be a little tired, but I won’t feel sleepy.”

Even the terrible sleep he had each night that didn’t last more than four hours was made possible only with sleeping pills.

“Does this always happen when you lose sleep?”

“Mm.”

“Doesn’t it feel terrible?”

“Mm.” Mo Yesi kept quiet for a few seconds as if he had been immersed in some memory. He then sighed and said, “It’s terrible.”

“Then, does this happen a lot?”

“Mm, a lot.”

Qiao Mianmian felt bad for him.

She already felt terrible to lose sleep every once in a while and always needed a few days to recover from it.

Wasn’t it much worse for him?

She felt that the worst thing in the world was to be unable to get a good sleep.

She used to think that God had been so biased as to give him the best of everything. Who knew...

Mo Yesi looked down and saw that the girl before him was looking at him like her heart went out to him.

He suddenly felt a part of his heart go soft.

He reached out and stroked her head. “I’ll get better in the time to come.”

“Ah?”

“I guess God took pity on me. That’s why he arranged for you to be with me.”

Qiao Mianmian blinked her eyes in confusion.

What did his sleep have to do with her?

It wasn’t as if she was a doctor or expert in this area.

Mo Yesi did not explain further, despite seeing the confusion in her eyes.

He held her hand with his and intertwined his fingers with hers. “It’s about noon now. Let’s have lunch.”

Mo Yesi had driven himself here today.

He was in a Lamborghini that was extremely eye-catching in the car park.

In the car.

Qiao Mianmian asked, “Where’s Uncle Li?” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Mo Yesi turned to look at her and smiled. “I told him I’d like some alone time with my wife, and there are things that would be inappropriate if he was around. So, he isn’t here today.”

Qiao Mianmian started coughing.

Her face went red from it.

She shouldn’t have asked!

Seeing how red she went, Mo Yesi smiled and added, “I thought you were thinking about this too. You used to feel embarrassed every time I got near you. Now it’s just the two of us, can I hug and kiss you as much as I want to?”

He leaned towards her as he said that.

That handsome face got closer and closer to her...
