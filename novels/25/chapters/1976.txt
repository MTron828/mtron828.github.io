Chapter 1977: Whether You Lack Money or Not, Accept It

“Mom, I...”

“Listen to me first. You work outside most of the time. Although Yesi supports you, you have a family after all. It’s not good to be outside all the time. Yesi won’t say anything, but he’ll certainly be unhappy.

“No man would like his wife to be outside all year round. Moreover, Yesi cares so much about you. You have to care more about his feelings. Although a career is important, Mom feels that family is the most important.

“You can’t affect family harmony because of your career, right?”

Madam Bai was a traditional woman.

She felt that women shouldn’t appear in public often, and should prioritize family.

Moreover, she felt that both the Mo and Bai families could give Qiao Mianmian the best material life. Her precious daughter didn’t have to work so hard outside.

“Mm, I know.” Qiao Mianmian didn’t rebut Madam Bai because she knew that she was saying this for her own good.

She was afraid that her work would affect her family.

“Also, when are you and Yesi planning to have a child?” Madam Bai thought for a while and said, “Although it’s still too early, having a child early has its benefits. It’s good to have a child at your age; you’ll recover quickly.

“When the child grows up, you’ll be a beautiful and hot mom. This is good, too.”

Actually, Madam Bai didn’t want Qiao Mianmian to have a baby so early.

In her eyes, Qiao Mianmian was just a child.

But she felt that if she had a child, she could focus more on her family in the future. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

It wouldn’t be as busy and tiring as now.

In Madam Bai’s opinion, being in the entertainment industry wasn’t a good choice.

Her son was disobedient and became a director. She was so angry back then.

Now, her daughter had become an actress.

Madam Bai was a little upset that her children were involved in the entertainment industry.

Qiao Mianmian kept quiet for a while.

“Mom, I’ve discussed it with Yesi. We’re not in a rush for this, let nature take its course.”

“You’re all still young, there’s no need to rush. I think we can consider this.”

“Mm, it depends on fate. If I do get pregnant, I’ll give birth to the baby.”

Madam Bai wanted to say more, but after thinking about it, she kept quiet.

She knew she couldn’t force it.

As parents, they could at most give some suggestions.

...

After they walked for a while, Madam Bai said she had something to give her. After Qiao Mianmian followed her into the bedroom, Madam Bai walked to the bedside cabinet and bent over to take something out.

“Mianmian, take this. This is a little gift from Mom.”

Madam Bai stuffed a card into Qiao Mianmian’s hand.

Qiao Mianmian looked down and was stunned. “Mom, I have money.”

It was a black card.

Although she didn’t know how much money was in it, it definitely wasn’t a small sum.

“Mom knows you’re rich.” Madam Bai smiled gently and lovingly. “But this is a little gift from me as your mother. Whether you lack money or not, accept it. Mom will feel more at ease if you have it.

“Actually, this amount of money is nothing. You’re the daughter of the Bai family. Half of the family’s business is yours.”
