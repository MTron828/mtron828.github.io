Chapter 1701: There’s No Need for any Restraint

Qiao Chen’s mind was blank. “You have to leave?”

Shen Xin nodded. “My family has arranged everything. I can’t be willful.

“Qiao Chen, you know my family’s situation very well. My parents are already working hard for this family. I don’t want them to worry about me anymore. Our family will probably fall just like this. There’s no hope of getting back up.”

“Shen Xin, I begged Brother-in-law for you.” Qiao Chen didn’t want her to misunderstand. “Maybe it’s because of my sister. Brother-in-law...”

“I know you must have helped.” Shen Xin interrupted him before he could finish. “Actually, I can understand why Brother Yesi isn’t willing to help. The Shen Corporation has suffered too many losses and needs too much capital. From Brother Yesi’s point of view, it’s normal that he isn’t willing to take this risk.

“Moreover, my sister did some bad things to your sister previously. I can see that Brother Yesi dotes on your sister very much, so I can understand. Our family falling to such a state can’t be blamed on anyone. The company’s internal problems haven’t been resolved, so it’s only a matter of time before it goes bankrupt.

“It’s just because the stock price suddenly fell that we went bankrupt.”

“You don’t blame my brother-in-law?”

“Mm, it’s not strange. If the Shen Corporation had good management, even if they met with difficulties, they could solve it themselves. Not being able to solve it this time means there’s a problem with their management. Even if your family helps, they might still face the same problem in the future.”

Shen Xin smiled as if she didn’t care about all this wealth. “Anyway, to me, as long as our family is still around, it’s enough.”

Qiao Chen knew that he couldn’t keep Shen Xin.

His heart felt empty as if a part was missing. “Then, where are you transferring to?”

Shen Xin was silent for a while. “It’s better not to know. Qiao Chen, I hope to leave cleanly. I hope that after I leave Yuncheng City, I can live a new life. As for everything here, it will become a beautiful memory in the future.”

Since it was impossible between them, Shen Xin didn’t want to give herself any hope.

She didn’t want to give him any hope.

She knew very well what it felt like to yearn for someone.

She’d suffered for three years and didn’t want Qiao Chen to walk her old path.

He didn’t have deep feelings for her, so as long as she left, he wouldn’t have to wait long before he forgot about her.

And she would try her best to forget him.

Hence, there was no need for them to be tied down. Forgetting each other was the best choice.

Qiao Chen clenched his fists and kept quiet.

Shen Xin pursed her lips and kept quiet for a few minutes. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“I’m a little sleepy.” Shen Xin broke the silence. “Qiao Chen, thank you for coming to see me. You’d better go back quickly. It’s not good to let others find out that you’re not around.”

Shen Xin yawned as she spoke, looking really tired.

Qiao Chen moved slightly, and his lips parted. He had a lot to say.

But in the end, he swallowed his words.

“Alright.” He spoke again with a hoarse voice. “Rest well, then. You can tell me when you’re leaving, right?”

Meeting her gaze, he pursed his lips and smiled bitterly. “We’re classmates, it shouldn’t be a problem for me to send you off.”
