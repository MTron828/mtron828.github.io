She knew that he was jealous.

She knew that he got upset every time Gong Zeli was mentioned.

Why did she have to be honest with him?

Couldn’t she lie to him?

He couldn’t really ask Madam Gong, anyway.

“He and Madam Gong were just angry at each other. I called him to give hima

way out.” Qiao Mianmian glanced at Mo Yesi’s expression and deliberated over

her words. “I just conveyed Madam Gong’s intention. It was Madam Gong who

spoke to him.”

This meant that Gong Zeli agreeing to go back had nothing to do with her.

It wasn’t because of her. Hence, she hoped that a certain jealous lover wouldn’t get jealous again.

“That’s all?”

She didn’t know if Mo Yesi believed her, but she could tell from his tone.

As for his expression, it seemeda little better than before.

“Yes.” Qiao Mianmian quickly nodded. “That’s all. I only spoke less than five

sentences to him.”

“Hmph, forget it this time.” “The man snorted and pinched her slender waist

again. “In the future, don’t get involved in his matters. Moreover, this is an Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

internal matter of the Gong family, it has nothing to do with you.

“Whatever happens between them has nothing to do with you. If something

like this happens again, don’t bother about it.”

“Mm, I won’t bother about it in the future.” Qiao Mianmian was like an

obedient child. She listened to whatever Mo Yesi said. “I couldn’t bear to see

Madam Gong cry so sadly this time.

“But you’re right. This is between mother and son, it has nothing to do with

Anyway, I won’t interfere in other people’s business anymore.”

At least, she wouldn’t bother about Gong Zeli anymore

Although she and Gong Zeli were innocent, since Mo Yesi minded it, shed

better keep a distance.

After all, family harmo

was more important than anything else.

Her husband was the most important.

Seeing that her attitude was very good, Mo Yesi finally didn’t continue to be

cold towards her. His stern face also eased up a lot, and his thin lips curled up

slightly. “Mm, Baby, good.”

Qiao Mianmian heaved a sigh of relief.

She wrapped her arms around the man’s neck and said coquettishly, “You

haven’t tried the pastries I made. Try them and see if they taste good. I spent

two whole hours making them. It was tiring”

“Alright.”

Mo Yesi let go of her and opened the lunchb0x, taking out a green bean cake.

The lunchbox was heat-insulated, so the green bean calke was still warm.

Under Qiao Mianmian’s expectant gaze, Mo Yesi tooka bite of the cake.

“How is it, is it good?” Qjao Mianmian blinked and waited for his comment.

“Mm.” Mo Yesi swallowed the food and smiled. “The sweetness is just right, not

bad.”

Qiao Mianmian was instantly happy. “I know you don’t like it to0 sweet, soI

added just a little sugar. I didn’t want to add any sugar at first, but I felt that it

wouldn’t taste good if I didn’t add any sugar at all.”

Mo Yesi had eaten all sorts of delicacies, so Qjao Mianmian’s culinary skills

naturally couldn’t compare to those chefs who had served him before.

But he felt that his wife’s pastries were the best in the world.

After Mo Yesi got off work, Qjao Mianmian was discussing with him what to

eat for dinner when someone from the Mo Residence called.

It was Uncle Zhang.

Qjao Mianmian watched as Mo Yesi picked up the call.
