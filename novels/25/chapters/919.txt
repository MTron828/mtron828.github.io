Chapter 920: When Have You Ever Made Me Worry?

“The two of us should cook faster. You cook one dish, and I’ll cook another. We can have a taste of each other’s dishes later.

“Don’t you find this interesting?

“Also, I don’t think you’ve eaten my food before. Although I only know how to make home-cooked dishes, the taste isn’t too bad. If you don’t mind...”

“How could I?” Mo Yesi said. “Honey, your food must be the best in the world. I’m the happiest man in the world to be able to eat your food.”

The man’s words were sweet to Qiao Mianmian.

She glared at him. “You’re exaggerating.”

Mo Yesi said seriously, “I’m not exaggerating at all. I’m speaking from the bottom of my heart. My wife’s food is the most delicious food in the world.”

Qiao Mianmian couldn’t help but laugh and hit his chest lightly. “Mo Yesi, why do I feel like you’re getting better at sweet-talking now? Did someone teach you?”

“No one taught me.”

Mo Yesi smiled and wiped his big, wet hands on his apron. He then reached out and pulled her into his arms, looked down at her lovingly, and said, “Baby, seeing you, I’ve learned without a teacher. If I have to say who taught me, then my teacher is you.”

Qiao Mianmian couldn’t take it anymore.

She couldn’t help but smile as she leaned against his chest and took a deep breath. “Hmph, another sweet talker. I didn’t teach you to be so glib. I wonder which woman taught you that.”

“Mrs. Mo, are you doubting me?” Mo Yesi chuckled. He pinched her chin and kissed her gently. “Besides you, who else is there for me? Your husband is already under your control. I’ve given you my whole heart, what else do you have to worry about?

“But you always make me worry. I’m worried about you.” The man furrowed his brows as if he was complaining to her. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Qiao Mianmian looked up at him. “How did I make you worry?”

The man looked at her deeply. “How is it that I’m not worried? Su Ze alone is enough to give me a headache, and now there’s Tu Yilei. And that Bai Yusheng guy, he’s obviously up to no good. Tell me, when have you ever not made me worry?”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

This jealous lover was going back on his words.

Moreover, why did he mention Bai Yusheng again?

Qiao Mianmian said helplessly, “I only treat Bai Yusheng as an older brother. Moreover, he only treats me as a younger sister. Mo Yesi, can you not be jealous? There’s really nothing between Brother Bai and me.”

Mo Yesi scoffed. “I believe you just think he’s your brother, but that guy...”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

“Baby, how long have you known him for? I’ve known him for six to seven years. I know him better than you do. He has never casually acknowledged any brother or sister, nor has he taken special care of any actress. Even if that guy doesn’t like you, he must have other intentions.

“I regret entrusting you to him now. If I’d known that he had such evil intentions, I wouldn’t have let you join his show.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

“But I really believe that he only sees me as a sister.” Qiao Mianmian kept quiet for a while before saying, “I can feel that he doesn’t have any other feelings for me.”
