Chapter 280: You Went to Look for Mianmian?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

On that thought, she calmed herself down.

She placed the cup on the table and smiled at Uncle Zhang. “Alright, I’ll go over now.”

She then turned towards Madam Mo apologetically. “Aunt Mo, apologies. I’ll excuse myself from the afternoon tea for now.”

Madam Mo smiled when she realized that Mo Yesi asked to speak to her. “Go on, go on. You and Ah Si have been close since you were kids. After a whole year without meeting each other, he surely has a lot to talk to you about. Have a good talk, don’t worry about me.”

Madam Mo didn’t think of accepting Qiao Mianmian as her daughter-in-law.

She still preferred Shen Rou.

The way she saw it, her son was so outstanding that it wouldn’t affect his status much even if he got a divorce and a second marriage.

Moreover, Shen Rou was so devoted to her son.

Hence, she still wished to bring Shen Rou and Mo Yesi together even though Mo Yesi was already married.

She couldn’t be happier that they were going to spend some time with just each other.

“Aunt Mo, I’ll get going first.”

Shen Rou smiled presentably and then got up slowly, taking her leave with Uncle Zhang.

...

On the way.

Shen Rou tried to sound Uncle Zhang out casually.

Uncle Zhang had been with the Mo family for tens of years.

He did have some capability to get into his current role as the butler.

He knew exactly what Shen Rou was trying to find out.

It seemed like she’d also guessed why Young Master was looking for her.

Uncle Zhang thought for a while and decided to remind her. “Young Master didn’t look too good just now. He seemed angry about something.”

Shen Rou’s expression changed slightly. “... Oh, is it? He seemed very angry?”

“I guess.” Uncle Zhang deliberately made things sound strange. “I wonder what’s with Second Young Master. He was alright just now, but his expression suddenly changed.”

Shen Rou clenched her fist by her side and got a little panicky.

She was losing her composure again.

She got more nervous when she thought about Mo Yesi’s temper.

...

At the study room, Uncle Zhang knocked on the door and said, “Second Young Master, Miss Shen is here.”

“Let her in.”

The voice from inside the study was exceptionally cold.

Upon hearing that, Shen Rou’s confidence dwindled immediately.

Uncle Zhang held the door open and bowed. “Miss Shen, please enter.” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Shen Rou stops at the door for a few seconds before taking a deep breath and finally walking in.

Uncle Zhang pulled the door back but did not close it entirely. He left a small gap.

Shen Rou felt the cold air surround her when she entered. She seemed to see a thin layer of ice on his handsome face.

“Ah Si, you’re looking for me?”

She forced a smile and tried to act as if nothing had happened. “Is anything the matter?”

Mo Yesi eyed her coldly. “You went to look for Mianmian?”

Shen Rou’s expression stiffened.

She hadn’t expected Mo Yesi to be so direct.

But, after all, she was a rich girl who’d had much exposure throughout her growing years. She was able to remain calm and composed, different from most girls out there.

She smiled again and casually said, “Yeah, I went to look for her just now. Did Mianmian tell you about it?”
