Chapter 950: Qiao Mianmian, Get Out of the Entertainment Industry

But that slut didn’t affect her at all. She was even the female lead now.

Boycott Bitch Qiao. Get out of the entertainment industry: My brother sacrificed so much for this woman, but she didn’t even thank him on Weibo. This woman is too disgusting. Why is my brother’s career and future so affected by her, but she can pretend that nothing happened? This slut wants to continue in the entertainment industry? Everyone, boycott her and get this slut out of the entertainment industry.

Initially, Tu Yilei’s fans were still scolding Qiao Mianmian under the post of “insider”. After scolding her for a while, they changed their target and searched for Qiao Mianmian’s Weibo account. Then, they scolded her crazily under her latest post.

At the same time, as if to prove the authenticity of the “insider”‘s words, a so-called insider revealed that Huang Yilin was indeed at the police station and was detained on the charge of deliberately hurting others.

It was usually more serious when it came to criminal detainment.

Some people also revealed that Tu Yilei had indeed terminated his commercial contract with his company for some reason. They said that he couldn’t shoot any commercials for now.

These so-called posts proved that the “insider” post was very real.

Instantly, more and more fans went to Qiao Mianmian’s Weibo post and started commenting.

The comment section was a mess.

Many people were asking Qiao Mianmian to die and get out of the entertainment industry.

In fact, the topic of “Qiao Mianmian get out of the entertainment industry” was trending.

The situation was getting out of control. All sorts of topics about Qiao Mianmian even surpassed Tu Yilei’s trending topics.

Someone started to dig out who Qiao Mianmian’s sugar daddy was.

Someone even started to dig up Qiao Mianmian’s past.

Even the rumors about her and Bai Yusheng were treated like dirt. They said that the moment she entered the production team, she seduced the director and wanted to be the female lead. But Huang Yilin’s status was much higher than hers, and she couldn’t seduce her, so she came up with this despicable method.

Once Huang Yilin’s scandals came out, she was the female lead the next day.

Huang Yilin went to look for her with sulfuric acid in her anger.

The acid should have been on her.

But because Tu Yilei stepped forward, all the damage was taken by him.

Another so-called hospital employee revealed that Tu Yilei was still recuperating in the hospital. His manager was the only one with him, and Qiao Mianmian wasn’t around.

Once this post was released, Tu Yilei’s fans were even more enraged.

On Weibo, many comments denounced Qiao Mianmian.

Some even suggested teaming up to beat Qiao Mianmian up.

Someone knocked on the door.

She told the person outside to come in, and the person greeted her politely.

Linda looked at him. “What is it?”

“Sister Linda, Chairman Zhao wants you to go to his office. He said he has something to discuss with you.”

Linda frowned and nodded. “I got it. I’ll be right there.”
