Chapter 1504: Mo Yesi’s Narration Was Only For Her

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

If the facial masks she endorsed sold well, it would help her take on more endorsements.

She wasn’t as unreasonable as before, wanting to rely on herself and being unwilling to accept help from others. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Mo Yesi was her husband, the person closest to her.

She could accept her husband’s help.

Ever since she figured this out, Qiao Mianmian didn’t have any psychological barriers.

The original resources were also a resource.

Otherwise, if she was born into a rich and powerful family, would she have to break away from them just to prove that she could make it without relying on her parents?

Only a fool would do such a thing.

“Hubby, thank you,” Qiao Mianmian said softly.

Mo Yesi was silent.

His silence was a little long, so long that Qiao Mianmian thought he was doing something else. She couldn’t help but call out softly, “Mo Yesi, are you still there?”

“Mm.”

Qiao Mianmian asked, “Why didn’t you say anything just now?”

“I’m thinking about something.”

“What is it?”

“Should I look for you?”

“...”

“Baby, I can’t control myself when you call me Hubby.”

“...” Qiao Mianmian blushed even though she knew that he couldn’t see her.

Her ears were a little red.

Mo Yesi was really...

“Sigh, forget it. I’ll bear with it.” After a few seconds, the man sighed helplessly.

“Chairman Mo, Chairman Lin from Sheng Fei is here.”

Qiao Mianmian heard Wei Zheng’s voice and said, “Go on with your work, I’ll call you tonight.”

“Mm, then I’ll get back to work. Remember to eat on time, don’t mind the trouble.”

“Alright, I got it.”

They talked on the phone three times a day.

And the video chat.

Mo Yesi became very naggy in front of her, telling her to eat well every day.

Although Qiao Mianmian felt that he nagged a little, she still felt sweet inside.

Because Mo Yesi only nagged at her.

He worried about her, valued her, and cared about her. That was why he reminded her of such trivial matters every day.

...

At Xue Shiya.

Throughout the day, Qiao Mianmian’s sales exceeded Qiao Anxin’s by five times.

The woman complaining about signing Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

The first endorsement that Qiao Mianmian signed had a sales volume of over 50,000 yuan.

This was a number that many A-list celebrities might not achieve.

As a newbie, her first advertisement was already so good, attracting the attention of many brands in the industry.

The next day, Linda called her happily and told her that many advertisers were looking for her to endorse their products.

Qiao Mianmian asked her and found that the brands consisted of snacks, shampoo, shower gel, and fast food.

Linda analyzed. “These brands aren’t bad. If it was in the past, I would suggest you take them. But now, I think we can take on more high-end ones. So, I rejected them all.

“Your first commercial is a second-tier skincare product. Even if you’re not even a third-tier artiste now, you can’t lower your standards to shoot a third-tier product. People strive for greater things. Don’t accept anything lower than a second-tier product in the future.”
