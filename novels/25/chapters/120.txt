Chapter 122: Do You Think I Should Be Angry?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Qiao Mianmian didn’t know how to respond to him.

She couldn’t tell what he was thinking.

Was he angry at her for fighting?

On that thought, she realized that ever since their marriage, she had been causing all sorts of problems. And each time, he would have to clean up after her.

Was he thinking that she was too much of a trouble? Was that why he was getting angry?

“Um, are you... angry?” Qiao Mianmian bit her lip and asked apprehensively.

If he really was angry with her, she would understand it too.

She tried looking from his perspective. If she had married a troublesome wife, she would probably be annoyed too.

The man’s voice got even colder. “We’ve only just been apart for a while and something so serious happened. Do you think I should be angry?”

Qiao Mianmian tightened her grip around her cell phone.

As she guessed, he was really finding her too much of a trouble.

“I’m sorry.” She truly felt bad about it and apologized meekly. “I didn’t do it on purpose, I know...”

Before she finished her sentence, the man’s voice cut her off. “Baby, I don’t mean to blame you at all. I’m angry because you’ve been bullied the moment I left. I wasn’t there for you when someone was putting you down.

“I said that I’d protect you well and wouldn’t let you be aggrieved or hurt. But I failed to do that.”

Qiao Mianmian’s eyes widened in shock.

He was angry... but not because she was causing trouble.

It was because he wasn’t protecting her well enough.

She felt all warm and fuzzy in her heart when she processed it.

“It has nothing to do with you,” Qiao Mianmian said tenderly. “You can’t possibly be by my side 24 hours a day, watching over me. And you wouldn’t know what to expect after you leave me. How could you be blamed for this?

“Moreover, I really wasn’t bullied by anyone. I’m so good at fighting, I’m the one bullying others.” Qiao Mianmian regretted her words the moment she uttered them. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

The man on the line seemed to be smiling. “Good at fighting, hm? Baby, did you use to fight a lot?”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

She accidentally revealed something.

After a short moment of silence, the man sighed. “Baby, I really wish you could be by my side 24 hours a day. That way, I’ll be able to see you every minute and every second. Otherwise, I can’t feel at ease.”

...

The call ended.

Qiao Mianmian could feel herself burning up at her cheeks as she thought about Mo Yesi’s final words on the call.

He murmured in that deep alluring voice: Baby, I want to hug and kiss you so bad. Hubby misses you so much without Baby here.

Her heart was going numb from that gentle voice.

“Baby, what did Prince Charming say to you? Why’s your face so red?” Jiang Luoli smiled cheekily at her.

Qiao Mianmian turned away and snapped. “Go find yourself a guy if you’re so curious. You’ll know, then.”

“Hmph, forget it.” Both of them got up after enough rest.

Jiang Luoli patted the dirt off her clothes. “Rather than waste my time dating some average man, I might as well figure out how to earn big bucks. Besides money, I’m not interested in anything.”
