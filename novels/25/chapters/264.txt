Chapter 265: I Want All the Information on Qiao Mianmian

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

The maids started chatting and became excited.

After all, their Young Master used to avoid females.

They had even wondered if he was gay.

But now, the Young Master was married and was still so affectionate with the Young Madam. It was enough to prove that his sexual orientation was normal.

It seemed like the Young Master’s indifference towards women in the past was not because he wasn’t interested in women, but because he hadn’t met a woman he liked.

In front of the woman he liked, he still behaved like a normal man.

Shen Rou’s face turned colder and colder as the maids continued chatting...

As the maids chatted, they suddenly felt a pair of cold eyes falling on them. They looked up and felt a thud in their hearts when they saw Shen Rou’s icy-cold face staring at them. Frightened, they quickly closed their mouths.

They exchanged glances in regret.

How could they have forgotten that Miss Shen liked their Young Master?

She had liked the Young Master for so many years, but he still had no affection for her.

Now that the Young Master was suddenly married, she must be in a bad mood.

What they had just said was undoubtedly sprinkling salt on the wound in her heart.

However, Shen Rou had always seemed sweet-tempered, noble, and elegant.

The maids were a little shocked to see her gloomy face that was suddenly worlds apart from how she usually looked.

“Miss Shen, I- I’m going to send the brown sugar water to the Young Madam.”

The maid holding the bowl of brown sugar water bowed and quickly walked upstairs.

The other maids also made various excuses and left one after the other.

Shen Rou stood on the spot, thinking of their words, her teeth biting into her lips tightly.

Even if she knew that Mo Yesi and that woman wouldn’t last long, she still found their current happiness unbearable.

Who was Qiao Mianmian!

What qualifications did she have to make Mo Yesi treat her so well!

Standing still for a while, Shen Rou felt more unwilling the more she thought about it. She took out her mobile phone and sent a message: [Ze Li, I want all the information on Qiao Mianmian. Send it to me as soon as possible.]

She knew that Gong Zeli would definitely help her.

Because he liked her.

She had always known that.

...

In the bedroom.

Mo Yesi carried Qiao Mianmian to the bed.

“Are you sleepy?”

He reached out to caress her head. “Sleep for a while if you’re sleepy. I’ll wake you when it’s dinnertime.”

Qiao Mianmian was indeed sleepy.

She easily got tired during Summer and was in low spirits due to her menstruation.

Just now, she had focused all of her attention on dealing with the Old Madam and Madam Mo. After that, she had relaxed completely and was now lacking energy.

“Yes.” She nodded gently and yawned. Her voice was muffled as she said, “I’m a little sleepy.”

Mo Yesi carried her and put her on the bed gently. “Sleep for a while.”

“What about you?”

Qiao Mianmian couldn’t help but yawn a few times.

“I’m going to the study room for a while.” Mo Yesi sat down on the bed and tucked her in. “I have to settle some of the company’s matters.”

He was always very natural and casual when he did such things.

He was very skilled.

As if he had been taking care of her for a long time.

Qiao Mianmian’s eyes drooped and she pursed her lips as he covered her with the thin blanket. A sweet smile appeared on the corner of her lips.
