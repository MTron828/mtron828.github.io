Chapter 864: So, It’s a Deal?

People not capable couldn’t control it well.

Mo Nan was already very satisfied and pleasantly surprised by Qiao Mianmian’s voice.

But he hoped that she could give him more surprises.

He felt that the song just now wasn’t difficult enough. If Qiao Mianmian could sing this song well, he would be able to confirm her talent.

Qiao Mianmian didn’t expect him to let her sing a second song.

She thought that after the song was over, Mo Nan might say something polite and then get her to wait for the news.

Anyway, she never expected him to like her.

She met Mo Nan’s eyes once again, which were filled with suppressed excitement and enthusiasm. She vaguely guessed some possibilities and couldn’t help but feel a little excited.

“I know how to sing it.” Qiao Mianmian clenched her fists and tried her best to suppress her excitement. She reached out to hold the microphone and adjusted her voice before singing again.

Compared to the song just now, this song was more suitable for Acappella.

To most people, this song had a certain difficulty.

But to Qiao Mianmian, she could control it easily.

She was only halfway through when Mo Nan told her to stop.

Qiao Mianmian didn’t know what he meant. She looked at Bai Yusheng helplessly.

“Old Mo, just say it directly.” Bai Yusheng said directly, “Whether it works or not, just say it.”

Mo Nan was also very direct. He nodded and said, “That’s right, it’s her.”

“Are you sure?”

“Mm, when can she start recording?”

“This girl just took on one of my shows. I don’t think she has much time for now. How about this, when she has fewer shows, I’ll get her to come over and record. What do you think?”

“Mm, that’s fine too. Good things are worth waiting for, I can wait for her.”

“Alright. Then, it’s a deal?”

“Alright, it’s a deal.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

She hadn’t expressed her opinion yet.

How did they manage to settle this as if it had nothing to do with her?

Although she definitely wouldn’t reject it, shouldn’t they at least ask her?

“Mianmian, what do you think?” The two of them seemed to have just recalled that she was still around. They turned to look at her and asked for her opinion.

Qiao Mianmian said, “... I’m fine.”

“Alright. It’s settled, then.” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Bai Yusheng walked toward and patted her on the head. “I knew you could do it. Make this album with Mo Nan, it’ll definitely sell well.”

“Hmph, which one of my albums don’t sell well?” Mo Nan said proudly. “With my years of experience in grooming people, if I still can’t make this little girl popular, then all my years of work would have been for nothing. I can wash my hands and leave the industry.

“I’ve been preparing for this album for three whole years. It can be said that every song in this album is top-notch.

“I’m confident that once the album comes out, it’ll definitely be my most stunning work.”

Bai Yusheng smiled and didn’t comment on his confidence. “Of course, I’ve never doubted your ability. Every song you’ve produced is top-notch. It’s Mianmian’s honor to be able to sing your work.”
