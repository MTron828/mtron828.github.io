“Perhaps, I haven’t been working hard enough recently, so you have the time to think about this?” The man’s voice was low and hoarse. His fingers that were rubbing her scalp gradually heated up, and a layer of warmth spread in his eyes.

Qiao Mianmian knew what he meant by “haven’t been working hard enough”.

Her face flushed red.

This hooligan!

He was already very hardworking.

If he tried harder, she would probably be crippled.

She wasn’t afraid of anything but Mo Yesi’s “hard work.”

“No, I didn’t…” She didn’t dare to make him work hard.

“Then, don’t let your thoughts run wild.” Mo Yesi tidied her messy hair and gently rubbed her head. “Aren’t you tired? Lie against me and sleep for a while.”

“Oh.” Qiao Mianmian nodded.

She leaned against him lazily, put her head on his shoulder, and slowly closed her eyes.

“Mo Yesi.”

A few seconds later, she suddenly opened her eyes and looked up at him. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Mm? Anything else?” Mo Yesi met her eyes.

“Do you know MR.S?” Qiao Mianmian asked curiously.

Then, she saw that he was stunned.

He narrowed his eyes and looked at her for a while before saying, “MR.S? Why are you suddenly asking about this?”

“People are discussing him on Weibo. They say that he’s very good, even better than Henry Zhou. If the Mo Corporation can hire him, they’ll definitely win against the Shen Corporation. Do you know… this person?”

Qiao Mianmian felt that Mo Yesi definitely knew more about this person than she did.

Mo Yesi was so calm this time and didn’t panic at all. He even said that he could handle the Shen Corporation. Could it be that he managed to get MR.S?

But that was impossible.

The netizens said that this MR.S was especially mysterious. No one knew his true identity.

“You’re… very curious about this person?” Mo Yesi didn’t answer her question immediately.

Qiao Mianmian nodded and didn’t hide her curiosity. “Yes, I’m very curious. I heard that he participated in an international jewelry competition previously and even beat Henry Zhou. Everyone says that he’s a genius jewelry designer with limitless potential. But besides that competition, he doesn’t have any other works. Moreover, he’s very mysterious. Even the award was received on his behalf. No one knows who he is.”

Mo Yesi’s eyes flickered. “I guess so. What do you want to know about him?”

Qiao Mianmian’s eyes lit up. “Mo Yesi, you do know him, don’t you?”

“Mm, I do,” Mo Yesi replied casually.

Qiao Mianmian widened her eyes. “Really?”

Mo Yesi looked into her excited eyes and smiled. “Of course. What’s there to lie about? This is a strange thing, why are you so shocked?”

Qiao Mianmian never expected Mo Yesi to know that MR.S.

So, was she right?

Was Mo Yesi so calm because he managed to get MR.S?
