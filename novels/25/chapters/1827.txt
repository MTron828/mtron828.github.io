Chapter 1830: I’ll Make a Choice

He lowered his eyes and thought for a moment before raising his head to look at Jiang Luoli. He answered her earlier question, “I will weigh my work and family. I will definitely do what I promised you. If I really reach the point where I can’t balance it out, I will make a choice.”

Jiang Luoli’s heart skipped a beat. “What do you mean by ‘make a choice’? Are you choosing between work and family?”

Mo Shixiu nodded.

Jiang Luoli’s heart was beating fast. “Then, if it really comes to the point where it becomes unbalanced, you... which one will you give up?”

Actually, she already had an answer in her heart.

Mo Shixiu valued his career very much.

Even if she occupied a certain position in his heart, it was impossible for him to give up his career for family or love.

Even ordinary people might not be able to do it. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

In real life, how many men were willing to give up their careers for their families? Almost none.

Let alone a man like Mo Shixiu. His career was also different from that of ordinary people.

He was going to be the president.

Anyone would find it ridiculous asking the president to resign because he wanted to go home and take care of his child.

She understood the logic.

However, she still felt a little depressed when she thought about some things.

This time, Mo Shixiu did not answer her.

He was silent for a long time, so long that Jiang Luoli thought he wouldn’t answer her. However, he finally said, “Luoli, I won’t be going to work tomorrow. I’ll accompany you to the hospital for a checkup. I’ll answer your question tomorrow when the results are out, okay?”

“Okay.”

Mo Shixiu did not answer her question, and Jiang Luoli did not ask further.

She regretted asking that question.

Why did she ask such a difficult question?

She didn’t know how to answer it.

Family was important to her, but so was her career.

If having one meant giving up on the other, she felt that it wouldn’t be true happiness no matter what.

Why would she let Mo Shixiu do something that she herself could not do?

“Mo Shixiu.”

“Yeah?”

Jiang Luoli thought for a while and held his hand gently. “Forget about it.”

Mo Shixiu was stunned. “Why?”

“Because I feel that the answer is no longer important.” Jiang Luoli really felt that.

“Luoli, are you... angry?” Mo Shixiu misunderstood her. “I didn’t answer, so you got angry? It’s not that I don’t want to answer you, but...”

“I’m not angry.” Jiang Luoli saw that the man was explaining to her seriously as if he was really worried that she would be angry. Her heart warmed and she took the initiative to go into his arms and hug him. “Mo Shixiu, I’m not angry. I said that I don’t need your answer because I feel that it’s not that important to me anymore. No matter what you choose, I can understand.

“Also, I thought about it just now. I don’t want you to give up your career for the sake of your family. I don’t think such a decision will make you happy. Actually, it’s still too early to say all these, isn’t it? Perhaps, I’m not even pregnant.

“And you might not even become the president. Er, are you angry?”
