Chapter 1065: When We Get Back... I’ll Let You Kiss Me

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

He came from the prestigious Mo family and had been outstanding since he was a child. He was one in a million in terms of looks and abilities. He was almost perfect in every aspect.

Such a man was the dream lover of many women.

How many women dreamed of marrying him and becoming his wife?

But they’d never seen him with a woman other than in work.

They’d never heard of him having an ambiguous relationship with any woman.

He was almost 30 years old.

This was the age to start a family.

Hence, it could be said that Mo Shixiu’s personal life was being watched by the entire country.

If it was revealed that he had a girlfriend, it would cause a huge sensation.

But at the same time, even if they knew about this sensational news, no one dared to expose it.

Unless Mo Shixiu made it public.

“Miss Jiang, you...” Mo Shixiu was having a headache.

He never expected Jiang Luoli to be like this when she was drunk.

It was completely different from when she was conscious.

It was as if she was a completely different person.

He still couldn’t do anything to her.

“Call me Baby!” Jiang Luoli glared at him and corrected him. “I’m your girlfriend, you’re not allowed to call me Miss Jiang anymore. Call me Baby from now on!”

“Ba...” Mo Shixiu opened his mouth but couldn’t bring himself to say it.

It wasn’t appropriate to continue calling her Miss Jiang, but he really couldn’t call her Baby.

He thought for a while and finally said, “Luoli.”

Jiang Luoli frowned and said unhappily, “I want to hear you call me Baby! Mo Shixiu, it’s fine if you don’t kiss me, but you won’t even call me Baby. I don’t like you anymore! I don’t want to be your girlfriend anymore!”

Mo Shixiu felt a headache coming on. “Luoli, be good. Let’s go back first...”

“Then, when we get back, will you kiss me and call me Baby?”

Mo Shixiu was speechless.

“If you don’t give me a kiss or call me Baby, then I won’t go back!”

Mo Shixiu was speechless.

Jiang Luoli felt that her body was getting warmer, and her stomach was getting upset. She leaned against Mo Shixiu’s chest and said pitifully, “Mo Shixiu, I feel so bad. My head is spinning, and it hurts...”

“That’s because you’re drunk. That’s why I’m sending you home now.”

“I don’t want to go home. You’re not even giving me a kiss.”

“...” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Mo Shixiu realized that if he didn’t agree to kiss her, this matter wouldn’t be resolved. He kept quiet for a while before sighing helplessly.

He gave up resisting.

No matter what, he had to coax her back first.

He was afraid that if he didn’t take her away, she would do something even worse in public.

Mo Shixiu didn’t even dare to think about what else she would do.

“Alright. When we get back... I’ll let you kiss me,” he said the last few words with much difficulty. When he was done, his face burned.

He couldn’t believe that he would say this to a woman.

“Really?” Jiang Luoli was overjoyed, and even her headache seemed to have lessened. She looked at the man’s handsome face and then at his sexy lips.

Mo Shixiu felt his heart racing again as she stared at him.
