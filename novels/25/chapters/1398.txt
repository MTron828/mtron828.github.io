Chapter 1399: The Jiang Family Is So Worse Than The Qiao Family

“Not a harassment call.”

“Not a harassment call?” Jiang Luoli was stunned. “Baby, what exactly are you asking me?” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Qiao Mianmian looked at her confused expression and guessed that Madam Mo hadn’t looked for her.

Perhaps Madam Mo didn’t know that her eldest son was dating Jiang Luoli.

But if Mo Shixiu brought Jiang Luoli to Qiao Chen’s banquet tonight, Madam Mo would definitely know about her.

Qiao Mianmian frowned.

She knew very well that Madam Mo would never like Jiang Luoli.

She wanted a daughter-in-law of equal social status.

Jiang Luoli obviously wouldn’t satisfy her.

But she couldn’t tell Jiang Luoli about this.

If Jiang Luoli ran away, what would Mo Shixiu do?

Perhaps she was overthinking.

With Mo Shixiu around, Madam Mo couldn’t do anything to Jiang Luoli.

And so many people would be watching at the banquet.

Madam Mo had to care about her image.

“Nothing. I’m just afraid that you’ll be targeted because of Big Brother’s identity.”

Jiang Luoli’s expression changed. “You mean someone is targeting Mo Shixiu? Is he in a dangerous situation now?”

“Luo Luo, don’t worry. Big Brother has a lot of bodyguards around him, and all of them are experienced experts. They’ll definitely protect him well. Even if someone has their eyes on him, they can’t do anything to him. I’m afraid that those people won’t know where to start and will target you instead.”

Jiang Luoli heaved a sigh of relief.

It was good that Mo Shixiu was fine.

As for her, she had nothing to be afraid of.

“Hahaha, don’t worry about me. This house is very safe, and he arranged bodyguards for me as well. He said that those bodyguards are very powerful people and can protect me well.”

“Mm, that’s good.”

Qiao Mianmian kept quiet for a while and then asked, “Luo Luo, are you going to the banquet tonight?”

“I’m going. It’s a banquet specially organized for Chen Chen. I have to go no matter what.”

Going to the Mo family meant that she would meet Mo Shixiu’s family.

Jiang Luoli was actually very conflicted.

She didn’t want to meet Mo Shixiu’s family so early.

She and Mo Shixiu had just confirmed their relationship.

Things were going too fast for her.

And she was a little afraid.

She wondered what kind of person Mo Shixiu’s parents were and if they were easy to get along with.

“Baby, tell me about Mo Shixiu’s family.” Jiang Luoli thought for a while and asked, “Are his parents easy to get along with? How are you getting along with them? Are they the kind of people who value family status?”

Jiang Luoli had always been worried about the Jiang family.

If the Qiao family’s situation was bad.

The Jiang family was in a much worse state.

No matter how badly Qiao Mianmian’s stepmother treated her, her father at least doted on her.

But her family...

Jiang Luoli clenched her fists and pursed her lips.

Qiao Mianmian kept quiet for a while before saying, “Most of the rich and powerful families pay attention to their family backgrounds. I heard from Mo Yesi that my father-in-law has gone overseas for an inspection and will only be back at the end of the year. As for my mother-in-law, I’ve only followed Mo Yesi back to the old residence two or three times. I haven’t interacted much with her.

“Grandma is pretty nice and warm. But I don’t know much about the rest.”
