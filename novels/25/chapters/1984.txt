Chapter 1986: All Because of Qiao Mianmian

“Tell President Quan that we can meet again another day. I’ll treat you to a meal another day.

“I really have something urgent to attend to, I have to go immediately.”

Qiao Anxin’s expression changed. “President Fang, what’s the urgent matter? You’ve already made an appointment with President Quan. He’s still waiting for you.”

“Baby, I do have something important. Be good, I’ll make it up to you next time.”

The old man quickly left as if he was afraid that Qiao Anxin would continue to pester him.

He didn’t give her any time to respond.

By the time Qiao Anxin reacted, the old man had already left.

Qiao Anxin stood rooted to the ground. When she realized what had happened, her expression darkened.

At this moment, her cell phone rang.

When she saw that it was Quan Dong, she gripped her cell phone tightly.

The phone rang for a while before she picked it up.

A gloomy voice came from the other end. “I told you to fetch Chairman Fang. Why haven’t you brought him here yet?”

Qiao Anxin was a little afraid of Quan Dong.

Now that the old man was gone, it meant that she hadn’t completed her task and even made Quan Dong wait for so long.

She stammered, “Chairman Fang said... he said he had something urgent to attend to and just left.”

“Fang Jie left?” Quan Dong kept quiet for a while before saying angrily, “Didn’t I tell you to bring him here? Didn’t you tell him that I was waiting for him?”DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“I said that.” Qiao Anxin’s face was pale. She bit her lip and replied a few seconds later, “B-But Chairman Fang said that he had something important to attend to and had to leave immediately. He said that he’ll treat Chairman Quan to a meal another day.”

“You fool. There’s no next time.” Quan Dong was furious. “If he leaves now, there won’t be a next time. If you can’t even do such a simple thing, what’s the use of you?”

“President Quan, I...”

“You don’t have to come up.”

Qiao Anxin panicked when she heard his cold voice. “President Quan, my endorsement...”

Quan Dong had previously promised her that he would give her an endorsement.

“You still want an endorsement? Your workload has been decreasing recently. We’ll see how you perform in the future. That’s it, you can go back.” Quan Dong hung up.

Qiao Anxin was so angry that she almost smashed her cell phone on the ground.

That A-list endorsement had already been decided for her.

It was almost certain.

But now, her endorsement was gone.

All because of Qiao Mianmian.

It was only after meeting that slut that Fang Jie suddenly turned cold to her and asked to leave.

Qiao Anxin was angry at first, but after that, she was more afraid and worried.

Quan Dong wanted to reduce her workload.

But her exposure wasn’t high enough. If her workload was reduced, her popularity would drop drastically.

In the entertainment industry where there were so many newbies, once one’s popularity fell, they were very likely to be replaced.

...

In the elevator.

Bai Yusheng saw that Qiao Mianmian was silent and thought that she was angry about what happened just now. He comforted her. “Mianmian, if you’re unhappy, Brother will help you teach that Fang Jie a lesson. You can teach him a lesson however you want.”

“Brother, I’m not unhappy.” Qiao Mianmian looked up thoughtfully. After a while, she continued, “I’m just thinking about something.”
