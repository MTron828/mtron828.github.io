“Jiang Luoli, you’re really being fearless just because you’re a woman, huh. Do you think I don’t dare hit women?” Su Ze flared up and glared at her.

“Haha, you wouldn’t dare!”

Jiang Luoli was enjoying the moment. “My Prince Charming is here. If you dare touch me, he’ll definitely get someone to beat you up.”

Seeing that she was Qiao Mianmian’s good friend, Mo Yesi played along.

He held Qiao Mianmian close. “You want to lay a finger on her in front of me? Mr. Su, would you like to follow in the footsteps of Sheng Hui Corporation? You want a taste of bankruptcy?”

Mo Yesi’s casual words had Su Ze’s expression change drastically.

His eyes widened. “Sheng Hui Corporation’s bankruptcy... was by you...”

Mo Yesi said easily, “Sheng Hui held out for 18 hours before declaring bankruptcy. Given the Su Mandate’s capability, I guess it could hold out for a few hours more.”

Su Ze went a little pale.

Of course he knew about Sheng Hui Corporation’s bankruptcy.

It made the headlines. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

The company was well-managed, and it just collapsed.

Moreover, it happened within a night.

It made many other competitors worried too.

Even the Su Mandate was privately investigating what was going on.

But nothing had been found.

Su Ze hadn’t expected that the one person who caused their bankruptcy was standing before him right now.

“Who exactly are you?!” Su Ze was shaken.

This person could mess up Sheng Hui’s stocks and shares overnight, causing a bankruptcy with immediate effect. This just showed how financially powerful he was.

Even the Su Mandate did not have such power.

Who was this man?

If he really was a big shot, why hadn’t he seen him before?

He knew practically all of the VIPs and respected people in Yuncheng City.

Mo Yesi looked at him with despise, as if he was just an ant. “You don’t need to know who I am, but you do need to be clear about one thing. Qiao Mianmian is my woman, and any man who bothers her is courting death.

“I don’t care what your relationship with her was in the past. But since you’ve broken up, her life is none of your business. If I find out that you’re harassing her, I’ll make sure the Su Mandate goes down faster than Sheng Hui did.”

With that, he turned away, not bothering to look at Su Ze any longer.

If he wasn’t Qiao Mianmian’s ex-fiancé, he wouldn’t even be in the position to speak with him.

The Su family was known to be powerful and wealthy in the eyes of most.

But to the Mo family, they were nothing.

“Baby, let’s go.”

Mo Yesi guided Qiao Mianmian out, with his arm around her waist.

Su Ze’s bodyguards were about to stop them from leaving, but the moment they made a move, they could hear a flurry of footsteps approaching.

The in-charge of the clubhouse had rushed up with a herd of security officers.

“Chase out whoever’s making trouble here!”

The in-charge saw Su Ze’s bodyguards and coldly said, “How daring of you to find trouble here. Don’t you know where this is? Get this group of people out immediately!”

The security officers nodded and got to it quickly.

Su Ze had only brought four bodyguards.
