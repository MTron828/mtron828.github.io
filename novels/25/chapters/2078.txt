Chapter 2079: The Aura Was Instantly Different

“I thought about it and felt that I should save some face for you, so I didn’t get him to replace you.

“But if you still don’t realize it, there’s no need to give you any more face.

“Also, since you know that I’m Young Madam Mo, you should be more polite when talking to me. My temper isn’t as good as you think. If you make me unhappy, I might get your boss to fire you.

“Do you think your boss would offend me for a mere assistant?”

After Qiao Mianmian said that, the woman’s expression changed from anger and disdain to shock and fear.

“Y-You…” She looked at Qiao Mianmian with a pale face.

Initially, she thought that Qiao Mianmian looked like a weak and easy to bully girl.

Hence, she didn’t take her seriously.

Unexpectedly, her face changed in the blink of an eye. Her words had a viciousness that didn’t match her looks.

Qiao Mianmian’s aura changed instantly.

Her face was still the same, and she still looked like a little girl.

But her gaze was completely different. The coldness in her eyes made the woman feel a chill down her spine. It was so cold that she had goosebumps all over.

The little girl she didn’t take seriously a moment ago now made her feel afraid.

Especially when Qiao Mianmian looked at her like she was Mo Yesi.

“Also…”

Qiao Mianmian looked at the elevator and said coldly, “Assistant Yang, you should take the elevator next door. This is reserved for the CEO. Please take a good look before entering the next elevator.

“If there’s nothing else, please leave.”

Qiao Mianmian’s expression was very polite, but her tone wasn’t polite at all.

The woman’s expression turned awful.

She then noticed that the elevator she entered today was indeed different from the previous one.

It looked much more spacious and imposing.

She saw Qiao Mianmian standing in the elevator and didn’t notice anything else.

This was the President’s personal elevator?

She was hurt by Qiao Mianmian’s words. She wanted to retort, but when she looked up and saw Qiao Mianmian’s cold gaze, she couldn’t say a word.

She couldn’t believe it.

How did this weak and easily bullied girl change so quickly?

Moreover, Qiao Mianmian’s expression and eyes resembled Mo Yesi’s.

She didn’t seem angry, and her expression was calm.

But it was scary.

Scarier than if she was angry.

The woman left the elevator dejectedly.

After she left the elevator, Qiao Mianmian pressed the button for the top floor. Soon, the door closed.

The woman was still standing outside the elevator, thinking about what Qiao Mianmian had just said to her.

She didn’t understand why she was intimidated by a little girl.

Obviously, even if Mo Yesi really married that girl, he wouldn’t value her.
