Chapter 914: He Didn’t Want to Be Affected Anymore

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

He couldn’t help but find it funny that girls were so shy.

He suddenly recalled that night. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

She was also very shy. When he wanted her, she was covered in a layer of pink from head to toe, her body trembling.

It was like a flower blooming beneath him.

She looked so alluring.

Mo Shixiu didn’t know much about women. He just felt that they were weaker than men.

He knew nothing about relationships.

As she had never experienced pleasure before, she could control her desires very well.

She was used to living a life without desires.

But it was fine if he didn’t try it. Once he tried it, he would get addicted.

This was what it meant to have a taste for food.

He had always been indifferent towards such matters, but he actually had a wet dream these few nights.

He woke up in the middle of the night, and the strange feeling in his body made him feel confused and ashamed.

At the same time, he felt that he was a beast.

That was because he’d dreamt of the woman he’d spent the night with.

In his dream, he relived that night.

If that night was an accident because he was drugged, why did he have such a dream?

He was confused. He didn’t know why he would still dream of her and do such things with her in the dream.

This confusion had affected him for days, making him unable to focus on his work.

Sometimes, when he closed his eyes, all he saw was that night.

Hence, he wanted to get to the bottom of this. He didn’t want to be affected anymore.

This was another reason why he suddenly wanted to see her.

He thought that since the dream started because of her, meeting her might solve the doubts in his heart.

At the thought of that dream, he felt a little ashamed. At the same time, he felt that he was a little dirty.

He actually thought about things he shouldn’t have in front of her.

This was gangster behavior.

Mo Shixiu felt a little ashamed and said apologetically, “I’m sorry, Miss Jiang.”

“Mr. Mo, why are you apologizing to me again? Didn’t I say that I was willing that night? You didn’t force me.” Jiang Luoli already had a good impression of Mo Shixiu. His apology made her feel even better about him.

He was indeed her Prince Charming.

His character was impeccable.

He hadn’t forced her that night. They were both willing parties, and he didn’t even have to compensate her.

But not only did he give it to her, but he was also very generous.

And now he was apologizing to her again and again.

He didn’t act superior in front of her just because of his status, even though he could have done it himself.

He didn’t have to apologize to her.

He hadn’t done anything to let her down.

“It’s not because of what happened that night.” Mo Shixiu looked at the girl’s youthful and flamboyant face. For the first time in his life, he felt embarrassed and uncomfortable. “I thought of offending Miss Jiang just now. This is very inappropriate and ungentlemanly behavior. I want to apologize for my actions just now.”

Jiang Luoli was stunned. “Mr. Mo, what were you thinking about?”

Mo Shixiu was stunned. His expression changed slightly, and he coughed lightly. “Miss Jiang, it’s better if you don’t know.”
