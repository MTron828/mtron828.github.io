Chapter 2226: What’s This Girl Trying to Do? Is She Trying to Defame Herself?

“I’m shocked. Qiao Mianmian is actually the singer. Qiao Mianmian’s singing is too good. She doesn’t lose to professional singers at all.”

“I think Qiao Mianmian might as well enter the music industry. Then, she’ll definitely be more popular than as an actress.”

“I don’t know if the drama she’s starring in will be popular, but she’s already very popular with those two songs.”

# Qiao Mianmian enters the music industry #

With Bai Yusheng’s exposure, Qiao Mianmian was quickly trending.

The netizens were shocked when they found out that she was the one who sang those two songs.

These two songs had already accumulated a lot of fans. Although most netizens didn’t expect Qiao Mianmian to be the original singer behind the scenes, they still praised her after knowing the truth.

“Based on her voice, I’ve decided to be her fan.”

But many haters also took the opportunity to sneak out and try to set the pace in the comment section.

“Qiao Mianmian can sing such a nice song? I’m afraid her voice has been fixed more than a hundred times before it became like this.”

“Haha, a vocals card is a good thing. You deserve it. I can only say that the voice actors must earn at least 10 million yuan. Even a male duck’s voice can help you master Decadent Voice.”

“Unless Qiao Mianmian is willing to sing an acapella for us to hear. Otherwise, I don’t believe that the voice is really hers.”

“That’s right. If she has such a nice voice when singing acapella, we will believe that she really sang those two songs. Otherwise, her voice was definitely edited. I have a friend who works with music. He told me that Qiao Mianmian’s voice was edited.”

It had to be said that the haters were doing well.

Many people in the comment section suspected that Qiao Mianmian’s voice had been edited.

Everyone’s comments were similar.

They simply felt that Qiao Mianmian’s voice was too nice. If her voice hadn’t been edited, it wouldn’t have been so nice.

…

At the venue.

As the promotion was broadcasted live, netizens’ comments could be seen.

The emcee scrolled through the comments and then picked one to show on the big screen.

The comment the emcee picked was a question asking whether Qiao Mianmian’s voice had been edited.

Qiao Mianmian saw it too.

“Miss Qiao, the netizens now know that you’re the singer. But some of them are still doubtful. They feel that your voice was edited, and your original voice wasn’t like that.

“Miss Qiao, what do you think?”

Qiao Mianmian looked at the comment that questioned her on the big screen and replied calmly, “When a singer records a song, no matter how they sing, they will definitely change it in the later stages. So, I won’t deny that my voice was edited in the later stages.”

Bai Yusheng frowned and turned to look at her.

What was this girl trying to do? Was she trying to defame herself?

The emcee was also stunned. She probably didn’t expect Qiao Mianmian to admit it so directly.

Although it was normal to do voice modification in the later stages, not many singers would admit it in public.
