Chapter 2831: Higher Chances

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Qiao Anxin was very happy.

Because the more Gong Zeli was interested in that slut, the higher her chances were.

Tonight was a great opportunity.

It was easy for a man to get drunk.

As long as Gong Zeli was drunk, her chances would be even greater.

To Qiao Anxin, success or failure depended on tonight. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

If everything went well… she could become Gong Zeli’s woman tonight.

She naturally had countless ways to make him unable to leave her.

Just like Su Ze.

Qiao Anxin had always known that she couldn’t compare to Qiao Mianmian in terms of looks. Even if she deliberately did plastic surgery to look like her, she was still inferior.

Hence, she was more willing to work on other things.

To men, looks were only temporary.

But if… she could satisfy him, it would be different.

She couldn’t compare to Qiao Mianmian in terms of looks.

But in other aspects… she was confident.

That slut looked as boring as a block of wood. It was just that she hadn’t taken Mo Yesi down yet. Otherwise, any man she’d served before wouldn’t be interested in such a block of wood.

Qiao Anxin walked to the elevator with a smile.

A moment later, the elevator doors opened and two men walked out.

At this moment, Qiao Anxin only had Gong Zeli in her mind, and she didn’t have the mood to pay attention to others.

She wasn’t in the mood to notice them, but the two men in the elevator noticed her quickly.

Both of them looked at her at the same time. They were shocked to see Qiao Anxin’s face, but they quickly looked away.

Then, they walked out of the elevator.

Qiao Anxin didn’t even look at them. She was thinking about her “big plan” as she walked into the elevator in high spirits.

The elevator doors were about to close when one of the two men took out his cell phone and quickly took a picture of her.

Qiao Anxin was so immersed in her plan that she didn’t realize it.

The elevator doors closed, and the two men exchanged glances. They changed their minds and pressed the elevator button on the other side.

…

Qiao Mianmian returned to the private room.

Zhan Bo sized her up and asked, “Qiao Mianmian, where did you go? Why did you take so long to come back? If you took a few more minutes, Brother Han and I would have gone out to look for you.”

“Didn’t I say that I went to the washroom?” Qiao Mianmian didn’t intend to tell them about her meeting with Gong Zeli and being secretly photographed by the paparazzi.

Anyway, the matter was settled.

She sat back down and took a sip of the juice.

“You’ve been there too long.” Zhan Bo frowned.

“A long time? Maybe I took too long.” She lied.

“You girls are so troublesome. Brother Han and I are the only ones here. Who are you prettying up to? Alright, alright, let’s continue. I don’t believe I’ll keep losing. If I don’t beat you tonight, I won’t be called Zhan Bo. I’ll be called Bo Zhan from now on!”

Zhan Bo lost.

His face was full of turtles.

Qiao Mianmian had just sat down when he impatiently pulled her to continue playing cards.

…

Qiao Anxin exited the elevator and saw a waiter carrying a bottle of wine and a fruit platter towards Gong Zeli’s private room.

She caught up with the waiter and said something.
