Chapter 1521: I Have to See You Immediately

Gong Zeli didn’t move. “I’m just telling the truth. Ah Si, I actually met her 10 years ago, but I’m not as lucky as you. God gave me a chance, but I didn’t grab it.

“So, you have to be good to her. You have to be good to her for the rest of your life. If you have a change of heart one day and treat her badly, I won’t have to worry so much.”

Gong Zeli was punched in the face.

Mo Yesi pushed him away coldly. “Stop dreaming. You’ll never have the chance.”

Gong Zeli’s mouth was bleeding.

He wiped it clean without care, looked up, and smiled. “Is that so? It’s best that way. Ah Si, I hope I don’t have such a chance too. So, you have to treat her well and pamper her forever.

“You have to make her the happiest woman in the world.

“This way, I won’t have the chance to take advantage of you.”

Only when he and Qiao Mianmian got happier would he slowly give up.

...

“Miss Qiao, someone is looking for you.”

Qiao Mianmian was resting when a housemaid walked over.

Qiao Mianmian was confused. “Do you know who it is?”

The housemaid recalled the handsome man she’d just met and blushed. She looked at Qiao Mianmian with envy. “It’s a young gentleman. He said he’s your family member.”

“My family?”

Qiao Mianmian was even more confused.

The young man said he was her family member... The first person she thought of was Qiao Chen.

But she didn’t think it was him.

It wasn’t the weekend, and Qiao Chen was still in school.

Moreover, it wasn’t anything special. He didn’t have to come and see her at this time.

Qiao Mianmian left with the housemaid.

A moment later.

When she saw Mo Yesi, she thought she was hallucinating.

The man stood there with his back facing her.

When Qiao Mianmian opened the door, the man standing by the window slowly turned around.

“Mo... Mo Yesi?” Qiao Mianmian widened her eyes in shock.

She couldn’t believe that the man who spoke to her on the phone a few hours ago was now standing in front of her.

Qiao Mianmian was too shocked to move.

Mo Yesi quickly walked towards her and pulled her into the bedroom. He then closed the door gently.

In the blink of an eye, Qiao Mianmian could smell the familiar scent as she was pulled into his arms. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Qiao Mianmian leaned against the man’s sturdy chest and heard his clear and strong heartbeat. After a while, she slowly came back to her senses.

“How did you...”

She looked up and was about to speak when Mo Yesi pinched her chin and forced her to meet his dark eyes.

“I’m worried about you.”

“You’re worried about me?” Qiao Mianmian blinked. “I’m fine, why are you worried about me?”

Mo Yesi pursed his thin lips and didn’t answer her. Instead, he said, “Why, you’re unhappy to see me? I came to accompany you, you don’t like it?”

“...No.”

“That’s enough.” Mo Yesi hugged her again and gently pushed a strand of hair away from her forehead. “No matter why I’m here, just take it that I miss you and can’t stop thinking about you. I have to see you immediately.”
