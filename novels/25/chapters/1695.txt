Qiao Chen frowned.

“Shouldn’t you be at the banquet?” Shen Xin looked at him and asked softly, “Why are you here?”

​

Qiao Chen said, “I...”

Before he could say anything, she smiled and continued, “Qiao Chen, you’re really making me misunderstand. Don’t tell me... you really like me.”

Shen Xin was just teasing him, but Qiao Chen’s expression changed.

He clenched his fists and kept quiet.

Shen Xin looked up in surprise.

Qiao Chen should have retorted.

But he didn’t.

She couldn’t help but get her hopes up.

“Qiao Chen, y-you really like me?”

Qiao Chen was still silent. He clenched his fists even tighter. Under the girl’s shocked and disbelieving gaze, the young man’s delicate face turned a little red.

Shen Xin was shocked by his reaction.

Although she felt that it was impossible.

Even when she asked, she didn’t have any hope.

But his silence made Shen Xin realize something.

Her eyes widened in disbelief. “Qiao Chen, w-why aren’t you saying anything?” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

She would really overthink if he kept quiet.

“Shen Xin.” Qiao Chen hesitated for a long time, but once he made up his mind, his eyes filled with determination. He looked at the girl on the bed and said, “You asked me if I liked you, but I’m not sure.

“I don’t know if that counts as liking you. But I know that after hearing you were injured in a car accident, I got very anxious and worried. I was even... a little afraid. I thought I had to come here tonight no matter what. I’d only feel more at ease when I saw you safe.

“So, I left the banquet early.

“On the way here, I felt uneasy and a little panicked. Brother-in-law told me that you only had a slight fracture and it wasn’t serious, but I was still worried. No matter how light the injury is, to a delicate girl like you, you’ll still be in pain.

“You seem especially afraid of pain.

“I feel bad when I think about you crying.”

Shen Xin’s eyes widened. She thought she was hallucinating for a moment.

She couldn’t believe her ears.

Qiao Chen looked at her shocked expression, and the young man’s pale lips twitched. Although his face was getting redder and his ears were also turning red, he didn’t avoid her gaze.

Qiao Chen was the kind of person who would fight for what he wanted.

From the moment he confirmed that he liked Shen Xin, he made a series of plans.

He never thought of hiding his feelings from her.

In the past, he wasn’t sure, or maybe he was a little sure, but because of the difference in their statuses, he didn’t dare to do anything.

But now, he didn’t have to worry anymore.

He could follow his heart.

“Shen Xin, I’ve thought about this for a long time. I don’t know if I like you. But I know I care about you.”

If he didn’t, why would his feelings fluctuate so much?
