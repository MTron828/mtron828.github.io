Chapter 1565: You’ve Been Disqualified

“Hence, I’m very dissatisfied with this kind of public backdoor insertion. I believe it’s not just me. Everyone present today is dissatisfied, right?”

No one responded to her.

She was silly, but others weren’t.

Since Qiao Mianmian could use this backdoor, it must have been approved by the higher-ups. It definitely wasn’t something a small employee could decide.

Who would dare to offend the higher-ups?

Qiao Anxin was shocked to see that no one was on her team. She panicked.

Only then did she realize that she had done something she shouldn’t have.

But it was too late.

The crew member’s expression darkened.

“Miss Qiao, please wait.” The employee ignored Qiao Anxin and turned to Qiao Mianmian. “I have something to settle here, it’ll be done soon.”

With that, he said to Qiao Anxin, “I’ll come back to you.”

The crew left quickly.

Qiao Anxin thought that her words had worked and couldn’t help but feel smug. She looked at Qiao Mianmian smugly and said, “I just can’t stand people like you who don’t abide by the rules. Do you think you’re a big deal? You have to follow the rules.”

The others started discussing after the crew member left.

“This works too?”

“I thought she was so stupid to offend someone. I didn’t expect it to be like this.”

“But it’s so satisfying to watch. I don’t like people who use underhanded means.”

“Hahaha, it’s pretty good. A nobody wants to be the first. So many seniors are here, are there no rules?”

“She thinks she’s invincible by relying on men. She doesn’t even respect her seniors. It’s good to have someone teach her a lesson.”

“Don’t think that Qiao Anxin is anything good. She isn’t trying to uphold justice for everyone. She’s just jealous.”

“Oh, what do you mean?”

“She’s one of Old Huang’s harem members. A few days ago, someone said that he saw her and Old Huang overseas. In broad daylight, the two of them...”

“So disgusting? Speaking of which, Qiao Anxin’s ex-boyfriend is the president of Star Splendor, right? She can even do that to Boss Huang? Damn, I heard that Boss Huang has a special hobby. Can she take it?” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“For the sake of your career, you have to bear with it.”

“In that case, I think Qiao Mianmian is much better than her. At least, her boyfriend is rich and handsome. He’s also young, a thousand times better than Boss Huang.”

“Who would be willing to serve Boss Huang?”

The group of them discussed for a few minutes before the employee who left appeared again.

That person walked towards Qiao Anxin.

Qiao Anxin saw him and immediately put on an aggressive look. “So, did you tell your superior? Did he tell you what to do?”

“Mm, I’ve reported it to the leader.” The employee smiled and said slowly, “Miss, the leader asked me to inform you that you can leave.”

“W-What?” Qiao Anxin was stunned. “What did you say?”

“Miss, you’ve been disqualified. Please leave immediately. Don’t affect the others’ auditions.”
