Chapter 1806: What’s With Her Attitude?

She didn’t tell Mo Yesi about being followed and meeting Gong Zeli.

She felt that if she said it, he would definitely worry about her.

On the other hand, if he knew that Gong Zeli was in Ning City, he would definitely be unhappy.

The two of them chatted for more than 10 minutes. Qiao Mianmian saw that there were still some unfinished documents on his desk and ended the conversation.

After hanging up, she thought of the person following her today and her expression darkened. She only hoped that the person followed her on the spur of the moment. She didn’t want to think if it was planned.

Qiao Mianmian thought for a while and still felt a little uneasy.

She was about to wash up when she heard a scream.

This scream sounded especially piercing in the quiet night.

Qiao Mianmian knew who it was.

After a while, there was movement in the courtyard.

Qiao Mianmian opened the door and saw Qiao Anxin running out of the courtyard.

The others heard her scream and walked out of their rooms.

“What’s wrong?”

Shen Fei looked at her pale face and quickly asked, “What happened?”

“Pig.”

Qiao Anxin was so shocked that she was a little incoherent. “I-I went to the washroom just now and saw pigs there. So many pigs, so huge. When I went over, they were all screaming. It was too scary.”

She patted her chest as she spoke. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“Pig?”

Song Ke and Little Xiao’s expressions changed. “Are there pigs in the toilet?”

“Yes.” Qiao Anxin was still in shock. “Moreover, there aren’t any toiletries.”

Little Xiao and Song Ke were about to go to the toilet when they heard that. They were a little shocked.

They had lived in a big city since they were young, how could they have the chance to see live pigs?

That was why Qiao Anxin was shocked.

Her expression was awful. “How can we use that kind of place? Isn’t there anything better?”

Shen Fei turned to look at Qiao Mianmian.

The only good place was Qiao Mianmian’s bathroom.

When Shen Fei looked at Qiao Mianmian, Little Xiao and Song Ke also looked at her.

They knew that Qiao Mianmian’s room had a washroom.

No matter how bad it was, it was still better than the place with pigs.

“Qiao Mianmian, your room has an independent washroom, right?” Song Ke and Little Xiao didn’t dare to go to the washroom there. They looked at Qiao Mianmian. “It should be usable.”

Qiao Mianmian could tell what they were thinking. She smiled and said casually, “Mm, my room indeed has a washroom.”

Song Ke heaved a sigh of relief. Just as she was about to speak, Qiao Mianmian yawned and said, “But I don’t have the habit of sharing it with others. I’m sleepy, I’m going to sleep. You guys can chat.”

With that, she turned around and returned to her room.

Without waiting for Song Ke and Little Xiao to speak again, she closed the door.

What a joke. Even if she didn’t mind others using her bathroom, she wouldn’t let Song Ke and Qiao Anxin use it.

Outside.

Song Ke’s expression darkened.

She said unhappily, “What’s with her attitude? Is she not letting us use it? She said she’s not used to sharing it with others, but this isn’t her bathroom alone, why can’t she let us use it?”
