Chapter 790: Hello, Are You... Qiao Mianmian?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

He didn’t believe in such coincidences.

In his opinion, there were very few coincidences. If one found too many coincidences, perhaps everything was never a coincidence, to begin with.

That incident 10 years ago.

He had to find out...

...

Three hours later.

The plane landed at Yuncheng City Airport on time.

Qiao Mianmian woke up on time.

She took off her eye mask and rubbed her eyes. She felt much better after a nap.

She received a few WeChat messages from Mo Yesi and two missed calls.

Qiao Mianmian opened WeChat and saw that Mo Yesi had sent her three messages.

Mo Yesi: [Honey, I’m at the office.]

Mo Yesi: [Honey, I have a meeting.]

Mo Yesi: [Honey, I just finished my meeting. Why aren’t you replying to me, what are you doing?] RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

The two missed calls were from Jiang Luoli.

Qiao Mianmian thought for a while and sent Jiang Luoli a message: [Luo Luo, what’s the matter? I just landed.]

She waited for a while, but Jiang Luoli didn’t reply.

Just as she was about to reply to Mo Yesi on WeChat, she felt a cold gaze on her.

She looked up and saw Gong Zeli standing beside her with a dark expression. He seemed to have shifted his gaze away from her cell phone.

Qiao Mianmian thought that he was unhappy because she was in his way.

She immediately stepped aside and gave up her spot.

Unexpectedly, her actions made Gong Zeli’s expression turn even uglier. It was as if she’d done something to anger him, and his previously gloomy expression instantly turned into a five-fold one.

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

She didn’t know what she’d done wrong.

Didn’t she already give up her seat?

Why did this man look even worse?

But she didn’t think too much about it.

In her opinion, Gong Zeli was a volatile person, to begin with. He was so nice and easy-going previously.

It was as if his personality had changed.

In the blink of an eye, he returned to his familiar self.

But she hadn’t intended to befriend him, so she didn’t feel much about his sudden change in attitude.

Qiao Mianmian didn’t bother about him anymore. She picked up her bag and got off the plane with the other passengers.

Gong Zeli stood rooted to the ground.

Seeing her petite figure being squeezed into the crowd and quickly disappearing from his sight, his expression darkened.

Recalling the message he saw on her cell phone, he felt uncomfortable.

Even though it was a normal message.

...

Qiao Mianmian got off the plane and followed the crowd to the ferry.

After taking a few steps, she heard a cautious and uncertain voice behind her. “Hello, are you... Qiao Mianmian?”

It was a young girl’s voice.

Qiao Mianmian turned around in surprise and saw a youthful face.

Behind her stood a little girl of about 16 or 17 years old. She had two ponytails, and her face was a little chubby. When she smiled, her face was full of collagen, and she looked especially cute.

Qiao Mianmian stared at the girl for a few seconds and confirmed that she didn’t know her.

She was puzzled. “You are?”

“Are you Qiao Mianmian?” The girl ignored her question and asked again. Her round eyes scanned her from head to toe.
