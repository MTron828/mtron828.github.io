Chapter 1971: The Good Child

“Okay,” Qiao Mianmian replied obediently.

“Let’s go in first,” Mrs. White said. “Your brother and your father are here, waiting for you.”

“Auntie, wait a minute.”

Mo Yesi walked towards the trunk and took out the gift he had bought.

Madam Bai was stunned when she saw the bags in his hands. “Ye Si, what did you buy?”

Mo Yesi walked over to Qiao Mianmian. “Mom, these are some gifts for you and Dad. I don’t know what you like, so I just bought some.”

“So be it. Why are you buying gifts? We’re family. Why are you being so polite?” Although Madam Bai said that, her eyes revealed her satisfaction.

This son-in-law was well-mannered.

This was also a sign that he valued their daughter.

Madam Bai was a little unhappy about Qiao Mianmian getting married too early.

After all, she had just found her daughter and wanted Qiao Mianmian to stay by her side for a few more years.

She also thought that getting married too early was not a good thing.

He was too young and did not understand many things. Choosing at this time might not be the wisest choice. There would be times when he would regret it in the future.

If she met a good husband, she would be considered lucky.

If they encountered something bad, it would be a tragedy.

Fortunately, the two children from the Mo Family looked reliable.

Madam Bai asked the butler behind her to take the gift bag from Mo Yesi and said with a smile, “Don’t buy anything from now on. It’s good that you’re back. Don’t spend so much money on these things.”

“Mom, that’s what I told him too. But he said he couldn’t come back empty-handed and insisted on going to the mall to buy these things.”

Madam Bai chuckled. “This means that Ye Si is a well-mannered child.”

...

Qiao Mianmian walked in front with Madam Bai.

Mo Yesi followed behind them.

The mother-daughter pair hadn’t seen each other in a while, and Madam Bai kept talking to Qiao Mianmian.

Mo Yesi followed behind and listened as Madam Bai kept asking about Qiao Mianmian.

He didn’t feel that he had been neglected. Instead, he felt gratified to see how much Madam Bai doted on Qiao Mianmian.

They walked into the hall.

Qiao Mianmian saw Bai Yusheng and a middle-aged man sitting on the sofa.

The middle-aged man was handsome and had a calm temperament. He exuded the charm of a mature man.

Qiao Mianmian immediately confirmed his identity. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

This was because Bai Yusheng, who was sitting beside him, was at least fifty percent similar to the middle-aged man.

Qiao Mianmian became nervous.

“Mianmian.” Madam Bai held her hand and looked at the middle-aged man. “That’s your father.”

She led Qiao Mianmian over.

When they walked into the hall, Bai Yusheng and Father Bai saw them.

When Madam Bai led Qiao Mianmian to Father Bai, he stood up.

The man seemed to be trying his best to suppress his emotions, but there was an uncontrollable excitement in his eyes.

He looked at Qiao Mianmian and moved his lips several times without making a sound.

“Dad,” Qiao Mianmian called out.

The man got even more excited.

His lips quivered. “You’re Mianmian?”

“Mm.” Qiao Mianmian nodded.

Then, she saw that Father Bai’s eyes were a little moist. He looked at her with mixed feelings.
