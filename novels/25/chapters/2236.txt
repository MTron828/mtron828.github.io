Chapter 2238: She Must Find Trouble

“He went to Second Uncle’s company for less than a month and managed to clinch a few deals. He made a lot of money for the company.

“Chen Chen did better than many of Second Uncle’s employees.

“Really? Chen Chen is so good?”

“Of course.” Mo Yesi smiled. “I believe that if Second Uncle puts the company into Chen Chen’s hands in the future, Chen Chen will definitely be able to manage the company better and better. Grandma, don’t forget that Chen Chen is a member of the Mo family. Some things are innate.”

The Old Madam looked relieved. “You’re right. The men of our Mo family are outstanding no matter what. You and your brother are like this. Chen Chen has such good results this time, he must be heavily rewarded.”

“Yes.” Mo Yesi nodded. “Mianmian and I will reward him, too. He deserves it.”

“That’s right.” Old Madam nodded. “Chen Chen performed so well, he deserves a reward.”

As the Old Madam spoke, she turned to look at Madam Mo. “Wenpei, don’t say those words to dampen our spirits. Everyone was originally happy, but did you have to ruin the atmosphere? If you feel uncomfortable anywhere, you can go back to your room to rest.

“Today is a good day. I just want the family to be harmonious and happy. If anyone says anything to dampen the mood, don’t blame me for not giving you face.”

Old Madam was extremely dissatisfied with Madam Mo.

In Old Madam’s opinion, the Mo family was at its best.

Her two grandsons had already formed a family. Her grandchild, who she thought she was no longer in this world, had returned to the Mo family. Another grandchild was also on the way.

Her days were getting better and better.

But Madam Mo had to do it now.

Everyone was happy.

She had to be unhappy.

Old Madam had advised her and warned her so many times. Seeing that Madam Mo was still like this, she was extremely disappointed in her.

She couldn’t be bothered to talk to her anymore.

Madam Mo had just slapped her two sons in the face, and now the Old Madam was scolding her without giving her face. Her expression turned even uglier.

Besides her husband, no one else in the family was willing to stand on her side.

Even her two sons were unreliable.

They were a classic example of forgetting their mother when they found a wife!

“Alright, Wenpei. Don’t say anymore,” Mo Yunchen whispered. “Let’s talk about it later. Don’t make Mom unhappy. She’s not fully recovered yet. What if she worsens?”

Madam Mo didn’t say anything else.

What else could she say?

She could tell that Old Madam was biased towards Qiao Mianmian and her brother.

Hence, no matter what she said, Old Madam would definitely protect them.

She was filled with anger, but she had nowhere to vent it.

“Go upstairs and change your clothes first.” Mo Yunchen patted her shoulder. “It’s my son’s birthday today, be happy. Don’t keep a straight face.” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Madam Mo went upstairs reluctantly.

…

During the meal.

Old Madam asked the juniors about their situation and was shocked when she found out that Qiao Chen, who had the highest score in the national college entrance examination, only applied for Z University.

Although Z University was a good key university, it couldn’t compare to Yuncheng University, not to mention the top universities overseas.

And Qiao Chen’s score was enough for him to study at a good university overseas.
