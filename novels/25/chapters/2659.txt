Chapter 2660: Rogue!

“Baby, don’t you feel sorry for me? I thought about it. If you really feel bad, I’ll give you a chance to make it up to me. I’ve just made a request, and I think it’s a normal request. I’m not making things difficult for you.

“You said that my hand was injured because of you. You can’t possibly leave me in the lurch.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

She felt like Mo Yesi was a rogue!

No one would believe it.

The cold and aloof Chairman Mo had such a thick skin.

He didn’t care about his pride anymore.

Qiao Mianmian felt that Mo Yesi’s public image was just a facade!

What aloof Prince Charming?

What pure heart?

None of them existed with her.

In fact, this man was as passionate as fire.

As for being pure and innocent… that was even more nonsense.

If Mo Yesi really had no desires, her back and legs wouldn’t ache every day.

“Hmph, I’m not talking to you anymore.” Qiao Mianmian pushed him. “Mo Yesi, do your employees know how thick-skinned you are? Do you dare to let your employees know what kind of person their boss is?”

“So what if they know?”

Mo Yesi didn’t care. He went forward and held her hand. “My wife is too thin-skinned. If I wasn’t more thick-skinned, I wouldn’t even be able to get the most basic benefits. Compared to my benefits, nothing else is important.

“But seriously.” His warm breath came close to Qiao Mianmian again, and his low and alluring voice seemed to blow into her ear. “Why hasn’t anything happened even though I’ve been working so hard recently? Is it because I haven’t been working hard enough?”

Mo Yesi glanced at her abdomen.

Ever since Qiao Mianmian agreed to have their baby, Mo Yesi had put a lot of effort into their relationship.

Their three meals a day were specially ordered by nutritionists.

She usually ate food that was suitable for pregnancy.

In order to make himself healthier, Mo Yesi didn’t even sleep late.

He’d been working out more recently. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

He even decided to quit drinking coffee.

In any case, before Qiao Mianmian became pregnant with their child, he planned to quit everything that was detrimental to him.

Qiao Mianmian felt her legs go weak.

How could he not be working hard enough!

She couldn’t take it anymore!

Sometimes, pregnancy depended on fate, not hard work.

Take Jiang Luoli and Mo Shixiu, for example.

“You’re too anxious.” Qiao Mianmian couldn’t help but complain. “I didn’t want to get pregnant in the first place. Moreover, don’t you know that pregnancy is a very mystical thing?”

Mo Yesi was stunned. “Mystical? What is it?”

“It’s just that you can’t be anxious about getting pregnant. The more anxious you are, the harder it is to get pregnant. You have to let nature take its course and not think about it every day. I might even get pregnant very soon.

“Look at Big Brother and Luo Luo, they’re like this.” Qiao Mianmian gave him an example. “Big Brother and Luo Luo got pregnant in one go. It was because they never thought of having a child that everything went so smoothly..”
