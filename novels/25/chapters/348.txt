Chapter 351: Did Hubby Do Well?

If he was socializing, why didn’t he just eat dinner outside?

Mo Yesi said in a low voice, “Mm. I promised you that I’d be back before you wake up, so I have to get it done. Baby, did Hubby do well? Do you want to reward me?”

The man’s voice was captivating, to begin with. And it was all the more alluring when he intentionally made it hoarser.

His lips were still pressed against hers.

Qiao Mianmian felt as if she’d gone all soft in his arms. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Even her ears were going numb.

She was panting from all the kissing. “W-What reward?”

Qiao Mianmian was feeling a little warm when she was sleeping and had tugged at her pajamas subconsciously.

A few of her buttons had come undone, but she hadn’t noticed it herself.

Now that she was in Mo Yesi’s arms, he could see her chest’s fair skin the moment he looked down.

It was pure and smooth. He couldn’t take his eyes off it.

Mo Yesi’s eyes were getting warmer by the second. He grabbed her hand and placed it down there, saying, “I’ve held it in the whole day. It feels awful. Baby, help your Hubby out, alright?”

Qiao Mianmian felt the warm bulge against her palm and instinctively tried to take her hand away.

But Mo Yesi didn’t allow her to.

The man pressed it down and said by her ear, “Just once. You can’t possibly feel good watching me feel bad.”

Qiao Mianmian said, “But, my hand will be so sore...”

“No.” The man coaxed. “I’ll try to finish faster.”

Qiao Mianmian’s face was a little distorted with reluctance.

He was a liar.

He said that the last time.

But the outcome was that... her arm had ached for days.

When he meant “finish faster”... it still took half an hour at least.

“Baby, just once, mm?” Mo Yesi swept some of her hair behind her ears and kissed her earlobe. “Help me just once and I’ll give you a surprise, how’s that?”

“W-What surprise...” Qiao Mianmian couldn’t help but stiffen up.

But she still felt weak in his arms.

Mo Yesi’s voice got deeper. “Baby, help me out first...”

Eventually, after Mo Yesi’s coaxing, Qiao Mianmian agreed to use her hand.

An hour later.

He was in a bathrobe and carrying her out of the bathroom.

Qiao Mianmian’s reddened face was buried in his chest. Her cheeks were still burning as she thought about what had just happened.

That man’s low and hoarse panting...

And the moans he had let out when he reached the climax.

Qiao Mianmian’s heart raced each time she thought about it.

Moreover, when she was helping him with it, he looked so sexy she almost went ahead to kiss him first.

Qiao Mianmian felt even more embarrassed upon thinking about that.

Why did she feel so corrupted these days?

No, no. She wouldn’t believe that she’d changed.

It was all Mo Yesi’s fault.

He was always making things especially hard for her to resist.

He was so handsome, and his figure was so good, any normal woman would harbor some designs about him when they engaged in such an activity with him...
