Chapter 872: I’m Just Kissing You, Nothing Else

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Qiao Mianmian didn’t trust him very much. Seeing that the man was getting closer and closer, she pushed him gently. “Mo Yesi, I have to wake up early tomorrow.”

“Mm, I know.”

“You should sleep early too.”

“Mm, I know.”

“So, you can’t...”

“Mm, I know.”

When she said the last word, the man’s hot lips landed on hers, and he said slowly, “Baby, I’m just kissing you, nothing else.”

...

This kiss lasted for a long time.

It was getting out of hand.

Thankfully, Mo Yesi kept his word this time. Although he almost lost control, he managed to hold it in at the crucial moment.

Qiao Mianmian was lying on the bed reading her script with her face flushed. She could hear the sound of running water from the bathroom and guessed that Mo Yesi must have gone to take a cold shower again.

It was rare for him to tolerate it tonight.

She’d been so distracted by him just now. If he insisted, she definitely wouldn’t reject him.

When had she not been seduced by this man...

...

Early the next morning.

Mo Yesi woke up at five in the morning.

He had flown over to see Qiao Mianmian during work hours. In order not to delay his work progress, he had to fly back before dawn.

Qiao Mianmian opened her eyes groggily when he woke up.

She was stunned for a while when she saw the slender figure beside her.

She rubbed her eyes and was about to get up when the man said gently, “You don’t have to get up. Go back to sleep. I’ll leave after I’m done.”

Qiao Mianmian was indeed very tired.

But when she thought about how he was working so hard for her, how could she continue sleeping peacefully?

She had just woken up, and her voice was still hoarse. “Wait for me, I’ll send you to the airport.”

“No need.”

Mo Yesi pressed her back down and covered her with the blanket. He then bent down and kissed her on the forehead. “Baby, continue sleeping. You don’t have to send me off. I have to leave soon, I might not have time to wait for you.

“Be good and continue sleeping. I’ll call you when I get there.”

Just as he said that his cell phone rang.

He hung up after a minute.

“Baby, I have to go.” Mo Yesi’s eyes were filled with reluctance as he kissed Qiao Mianmian on the lips again. “I’ve called for breakfast for you. You have to eat it before going to the set.”

“... Alright.”

Seeing that he was really busy, Qiao Mianmian gave up on the idea.

“I’ll get going, then.” Mo Yesi patted her head. “I’ll come and see you when I’m free.”

“Mo Yesi...” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Qiao Mianmian suddenly felt bad for him.

He definitely didn’t sleep well last night.

She was already sleeping late and had to get up so early.

She could see the dark shadows under his eyes.

“Mm?” Mo Yesi sat by the bed and looked at her tenderly. “Baby, do you have anything else to say to me?”

“Actually, you don’t have to run every day like this.” Although she was happy to see him every day, Qiao Mianmian couldn’t bear to see him work so hard.
