Chapter 464:

I’m So Sorry to Make You Spend So Much Money Again

Yan Shaoqing’s interest was aroused, and he asked, “Are you sure about that?”

Gong Zeli scoffed. “It’s just a car, who would even joke over it.”

“Alright!” Yan Shaoqing agreed to the bet excitedly. He then said confidently, “You’re gonna lose Fourth Bro. Let me thank you first. I’m so sorry to make you spend so much money again.”

Gong Zeli chuckled in reply.

...

In the room on the opposite side.

Qiao Mianmian was really willing to spend today. She booked the deluxe room. There was only Jiang Luoli and her in the gigantic room.

As this karaoke was the best in Yuncheng City, the speakers’ quality here was spectacular.

Jiang Luoli clapped excitedly after Qiao Mianmian sang the first few sentences of a song that she used to sing. She then exclaimed, “Wow, Baby. You were awesome. I’m pretty sure the original singer is nowhere as good as you.”

As of now.

Jiang Luoli was like Qiao Mianmian’s fan, staring starstruck at her.

Qiao Mianmian was embarrassed by her compliment.

“How so? The original singer is so much better than me.”

“I’m serious, Baby. It was better than the original,” Jiang Luoli exclaimed uncontrollably. “Baby, you have such a nice voice. It’s a pity that you’re not utilizing your talent. I’m sure that you will be the champion in any competition.

“Of course, if the winners weren’t already decided beforehand, you would be the champion.” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

It was the first time that Jiang Luoli heard Qiao Mianmian sang, and she was shocked.

She couldn’t decide how to describe her voice.

Qiao Mianmian’s voice wasn’t just nice. It was clean sounding and had a calming effect.

It was a unique voice. Everyone who listened to her would remember it for a long time.

This was such a god-given ability in the singing world.

Everyone could be trained to sing well. But not everyone had such a unique voice.

The same logic could be applied to actors. A lot of them were attractive, but few were capable of capturing the hearts of the audience.

Someone would be instantly popular with a voice as unique as hers.

But sadly, Qiao Mianmian wasn’t interested in singing even with such a nice voice.

Her interest was in acting.

Jiang Luoli felt that it was such a pity.

Qiao Mianmian was done with the song and put the microphone onto the coffee table.

“Baby, did you really not think of joining singing competitions? You can enter one even if your dream is to be an actress. You can change into being an actress after gaining popularity as a singer.”

Jiang Luoli didn’t want Qiao Mianmian’s beautiful voice to go to waste.

It would be like throwing away delicacy.

Qiao Mianmian shook her head and refused. “It’s alright. I don’t think it would suit me. I just want to focus on acting.”

Jiang Luoli was speechless.

She had such a nice voice and yet dared to say that singing wasn’t suitable for her.

Was she trying to taunt people like her who weren’t musically inclined?

She would shock herself to death if she had a voice like that.

As the music came on, Jiang Luoli picked up the microphone and was about to start singing. At that moment, someone knocked on the door and then entered. A waiter holding a big bouquet of roses came in.

“Hello, Ma’am. May I know the person singing just now?”

The waiter was shocked by their beauty.

Jiang Luoli and Qiao Mianmian looked at each other in confusion. Qiao Mianmian then stood up and answered, “It’s me. May I know what’s wrong?”

The waiter stepped forward and passed her the bouquet of roses. He smiled and continued, “A guy that was shocked by your voice and requested for this bouquet to be delivered to you. It’s his way of showing his appreciation of your beautiful voice.”
