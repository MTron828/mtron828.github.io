Chapter 480: Baby, Is Your Period Over?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

As they kissed, Mo Yesi pinned her onto the sofa. His hands caressed her hair as they continued to kiss.

Qiao Mianmian couldn’t handle the intensity and opened her mouth to breathe. When that happened, Mo Yesi immediately filled her mouth with his tongue and kissed her more intensely.

“Mo Yesi...”

Qiao Mianmian couldn’t control herself. She was losing consciousness from the kiss.

The alcohol in her system wasn’t helping as well. It was taking over what was left of her self-control.

She started to moan, and then she tried to push him away. They broke off to take a breather. But in the next moment, Mo Yesi started to kiss her passionately again.

The room was getting warmer.

Qiao Mianmian was losing control of her actions.

Mo Yesi’s kisses started to move downwards. He started to roam his hands in her clothes. Qiao Mianmian shivered as his warm hands touched her sensitive skin.

She was no longer aware of her own actions.

She tried to stop him. But she couldn’t muster up the strength. Hence, even though she was trying to reject his advances, it didn’t look that way at all.

Mo Yesi’s breath became heavy as he continued to kiss her. He panted as he lifted his head and looked as if he was trying to restraint himself as he touched her face. He then asked with a raspy voice, “Baby, is your period over?”

“Period?”

Qiao Mianmian opened her eyes, looked at him affectionately, and nodded.

His eyes lit up when he saw that. He kissed her lightly as he lifted her.

He took a deep breath to calm the raging desires within him, tidied her hair, and buttoned up her clothes. He sat her up and said, “Let’s go back, Mianmian. Our first time shouldn’t be here.”

It wasn’t the first time that they had done it.

But the previous time, they didn’t know each other. She wasn’t conscious at that point as well.

This time, he hoped that they could do it when both of them were conscious.

He hoped that she could clearly feel how much he loved her.

This was so important to him that he couldn’t do it in a place like this.

That wouldn’t do her justice.

...

Back at Lu Shan Gardens.

After parking his car, Mo Yesi turned around and saw that Qiao Mianmian had fallen asleep.

Even though she was sleeping, the alcohol in her system maintained the blush on her face. She looked like a ripe apple ready for consumption.

Her long lashes covered her eyes, casting a light shadow on her face. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

With her long hair covering part of her face, her small face looked even more exquisite now.

Her lips were still sore, and there were even some obvious bite marks on it.

They were caused by Mo Yesi when he was kissing her. He couldn’t control himself in his excitement and bit her.

There were a few marks on her neck as well.

She had really tender skin. As a result, it didn’t take much effort to leave a mark on her body.

As Mo Yesi saw the marks he left on her, his hormones began raging again.

He wanted... her.

He wanted to leave marks all over her body.
