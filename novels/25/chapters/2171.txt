Chapter 2172: A Familiar Figure

Hence, once there was a chance to get to know them, no one would waste such a good opportunity.

Yan Shaoqing was surrounded by a few socialites.

All of them had good figures and looks.

Surrounded by beauties, Yan Shaoqing looked like he was enjoying himself as he circled around.

A few other socialites raised their glasses and wanted to look for Gong Zeli. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

But the moment they did, they were shocked by Gong Zeli’s dark expression.

Gong Zeli didn’t have a good reputation in Yuncheng City.

Everyone knew that he had a bad temper, and he wasn’t a gentle person.

But they still couldn’t resist his good looks and family background. Even though they knew that his personality wasn’t good, they couldn’t stop trying to get close to him.

After all, every woman would think that she was special when she wasn’t frustrated by him.

A woman was standing beside Bai Yusheng.

She looked very charming and was dressed in a very feminine way. She looked at Bai Yusheng boldly and smiled charmingly. “I wonder, should I call you Young Master Bai or Director Bai?”

Bai Yusheng looked down at her.

The woman didn’t wait for him to answer. She smiled and said, “I’ll call you Director Bai. You must be more used to being called that way. Let me introduce myself. I’m Tang Ni, the daughter of the Chairman of the Tang Corporation. I’ve been studying overseas for the past few years, and I just returned this year to take over my dad’s company.

“I just saw Director Bai standing here alone, so I wanted to come over and say hi. I feel like Director Bai has an affinity with me. I wonder if I can have the honor to be friends with you?”

The girl from overseas was very daring.

Her eyes, expression, and even her words clearly showed her interest in Bai Yusheng.

Bai Yusheng’s expression was calm as he looked at this bold woman. “Chairman Tang’s daughter?”

“Yes.” Tang Ni looked at him and said, “Actually, this isn’t the first time Director Bai and I met. I saw you at a gala before, but I was too timid to greet you.”

“Is that so?”

“Yes. I wanted to get to know you back then, but alas, I was too timid. I’m a lot braver now, so I came to look for you.” The woman looked at Bai Yusheng and shook the wine glass in her hand, smiling sweetly.

“Director Bai, want a drink?”

Bai Yusheng naturally had no impression of this woman.

He wasn’t interested in making friends.

But as a gentleman, he wouldn’t reject her.

Unless it was someone he hated.

Hence, he raised his wine glass and was about to take a sip when he saw a familiar figure in the crowd.

Bai Yusheng’s expression changed.

It had been a few years since they last saw each other, but she was still as gentle as before.

She liked wearing white dresses, had long hair, and even had rose-colored lipstick on her lips.

She wasn’t the sort of woman who would attract attention.

But Bai Yusheng still found her in the crowd.

When he confirmed that the woman in the white dress was Gu Sheng, Bai Yusheng narrowed his eyes.
