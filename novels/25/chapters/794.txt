Chapter 796: What Happened

“That’s why I’m willing to send you. Since you’ve already called for a car, pretend I didn’t say anything. I’ll get going first.”

With that, he wound up the car window and quickly drove away.

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

She felt like Gong Zeli was angry.

Was it because she rejected him?

She couldn’t understand this man anymore.

But so be it.

In any case, she didn’t want to gain any affection from him.

Ten minutes later.

Qiao Mianmian got into the car and saw that Jiang Luoli still hadn’t replied to her WeChat. She furrowed her brows and dialed a number.

The call went through after a few rings.

After the call, she immediately asked, “Luo Luo, where are you? What are you doing now?”

“Oh, Baby...” Jiang Luoli’s sobbing voice could be heard.

Qiao Mianmian’s expression changed and her heart skipped a beat. “Luo Luo, what’s wrong?”

Jiang Luoli was a very headstrong girl.

Qiao Mianmian had never seen her cry.

Hence, she was shocked and worried when she heard Jiang Luoli’s cries.

“Uh, Baby, I-I...” Jiang Luoli stammered.” I-I don’t know how to tell you. I-I’m just, um...”

“What’s wrong?” Qiao Mianmian was getting anxious.

Jiang Luoli was such a straightforward person.

This was the first time she saw her stammer.

“I don’t know what to say to you.” Jiang Luoli kept quiet for a while before sighing. “I never thought that this would happen to me. Sigh, I’ll just tell you directly. I... I slept with a man.”

Qiao Mianmian was shocked.

“What did you say? Luo Luo, are you kidding me?”

“How could I joke about something like this? I... hope it’s just a joke,” Jiang Luoli said sadly. “It happened last night. I was bored and went to a banquet.”

“And?” Qiao Mianmian was shocked.

“Then, I got drunk.” Jiang Luoli sighed again. “Someone seemed to have tampered with that glass of wine. I was so dizzy and scared and wanted to leave. But I didn’t know how I ended up in a dark place.”

Qiao Mianmian asked, “... And then?”

“Then, I met a man there.”

“... Mm, and then?”

“Then, he took me away. I don’t have much of an impression of what happened next. Anyway, when I woke up, I was lying in a strange place, on a huge, unfamiliar bed.

“Then, someone called Assistant Xu gave me a check. He even said that his master was very sorry for sleeping with me, but because of some special reasons, he couldn’t take responsibility for me, so he could only compensate me with money.”

Jiang Luoli suddenly laughed.

“That man is rather generous. Do you know how much he gave me?”

Without waiting for Qiao Mianmian to ask her, she answered herself. “50 million. Is this sum really not too little? I can get 50 million just by sleeping for a night. It seems pretty good.

“I never thought that my first time would be so valuable.”
