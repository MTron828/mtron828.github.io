Chapter 679: Would He Help Qiao Mianmian?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

In the end, it was her turn in the afternoon.

She only had one scene today.

It was a scene between her and Huang Yilin.

There weren’t many scenes, just one. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

She and Huang Yilin’s female lead would get into an argument because of a misunderstanding. The argument would only last for a few minutes.

“How is it, are you ready?” Bai Yusheng was in a good mood since the first day. When it was Qiao Mianmian’s turn to go on stage, he walked to her side and asked her with a smile, ignoring everyone’s stares.

Qiao Mianmian nodded. “Mm, I’m ready.”

“You can do it.” Bai Yusheng encouraged her. “Try your best and you’ll pass.”

“Thank you, Director Bai. I’ll do my best.”

Qiao Mianmian took a deep breath and clenched her fists.

She still felt pressured after seeing Huang Yilin and Tu Yilei’s acting.

She just hoped that she wouldn’t drag the crew down.

Even if she couldn’t pass it once, she didn’t want to NG too many times.

Now, everyone knew that she was the third female lead that Bai Yusheng had personally chosen at the audition.

If she performed too badly, not only would she embarrass herself, but Bai Yusheng as well.

“I believe in you. After all, my judgment isn’t wrong.” Bai Yusheng looked at the time and turned around. “Get ready, we’ll start filming in five minutes.”

It was supposed to be a few minutes long, but after more than 10 minutes, it still hadn’t passed.

After another NG, Bai Yusheng’s expression darkened. “Yilin, what’s wrong with you? Didn’t I tell you that you accidentally pushed it onto her and didn’t do it on purpose? Why do you always make it seem like you did it on purpose?”

“I’m sorry, Director Bai.”

Huang Yilin quickly turned around and apologized. “I don’t know what happened, either. I don’t seem to be in the right state. I’ll be more careful next time.”

Bai Yusheng narrowed his eyes.

He didn’t say anything else and turned to look at Qiao Mianmian, who was slowly getting up from the sand.

Because of their argument, the female lead would accidentally push Qiao Mianmian to the ground.

Then, she turned and ran.

Huang Yilin didn’t find it difficult at all.

Qiao Mianmian’s performance wasn’t a problem at all.

This was supposed to be a one-time pass.

But because Huang Yilin kept making mistakes, she had already made three NGs.

She was supposed to accidentally push her.

But she always acted very deliberately, so they had to re-shoot it.

It was normal for newbies to act this way.

After all, she had no experience in acting.

But for a capable actor, this kind of performance was too subpar.

It didn’t seem like a normal performance.

Many people present could tell that Huang Yilin was doing this on purpose.

She was a winner of the Best Actress Award, how could she not perform such a simple act?

If even they could tell, the director must also be able to.

Everyone turned to look at Bai Yusheng and Qiao Mianmian.

They were all wondering if he would help her.

It could also be used to test his interest in this newbie.
