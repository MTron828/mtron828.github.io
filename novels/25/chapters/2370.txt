Chapter 2373: Do You Remember Tang Ya?

Forget it. Whatever he said.

She couldn’t be bothered to explain.

She thought for a while. She and Zhan Bo rarely contacted each other. If it wasn’t for work arrangements, they probably wouldn’t see each other often.

“Really?” Mo Yesi raised her chin and made her look him in the eye.

“Mm.” Qiao Mianmian nodded. “I’ll stay away from him in the future.”

“I’ll accompany you to the party next time.”

Mo Yesi wanted to accompany her tonight, but he had to personally discuss an important contract, so he couldn’t accompany her.

That brat was so lucky.

“You’ll go with me in the future?” Qiao Mianmian was shocked.

“Mm.”

“I thought you didn’t like those events?”

“I don’t.” Mo Yesi continued to blow-dry her hair. His slender fingers gently ran through her strawberry-scented hair. “I can tolerate it if I accompany you.”

He didn’t want her to have another partner next time.

He wanted to go with her.

She was his woman.

If anyone dared to lay a finger on her, he would rip that person’s head off.

“Alright, then come with me next time. That way, I’ll have a male companion.” Qiao Mianmian naturally hoped that he would accompany her. Previously, she felt that Mo Yesi didn’t like such events because he didn’t like being too high-profile, so she never made such a request to him.

Of course, she wouldn’t reject him.Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Oh, right. Mo Yesi, do you know that the Shen Corporation hired Henry Zhou to design new jewelry for them?” Qiao Mianmian suddenly recalled this and immediately asked Mo Yesi for confirmation.

Mo Yesi finished drying one side of her hair and started blowing on the other. “Mm.”

“Really?” Qiao Mianmian was rather shocked.

She thought that the rumors were fake.

After all, it was very difficult to invite Henry.

Wasn’t this a matter of money?

Henry was rich, so it was impossible to hire him.

But what else could the Shen Corporation do besides spend money?

“It’s true.”

Since Mo Yesi said it was true, it couldn’t be false.

Qiao Mianmian was curious. “Is the Shen family so powerful? They actually managed to invite Henry Zhou. Didn’t they say that he only designed jewelry for the royal family and the people he admired? Previously, an internationally renowned jewelry company spent more than a billion to invite him to design jewelry for them, but he didn’t agree.

“The Shen Corporation is still far from that jewelry company, but Henry Zhou…”

It was too unexpected.

Did Shen Rou know Henry Zhou?

She felt that even the Mo Corporation might not be able to invite him.

“It’s a little surprising.” Mo Yesi narrowed his eyes. Qiao Mianmian didn’t see the coldness in his eyes. “Henry Zhou wasn’t invited by the Shen Corporation, but he did agree to design new jewelry for them.”

Stunned, Qiao Mianmian became even more curious. “It wasn’t them? Then, who was it?”

“Baby.” Mo Yesi stroked her silky hair and said, “Do you remember Tang Ya?”

“Tang Ya? The Miss Tang Mom brought home previously?”

“Mm.”

“What has this got to do with her?”
