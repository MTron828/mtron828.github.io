Chapter 567: Today’s Movie Was Very Enjoyable

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

“It’s true, Young Madam. From now on, please come and visit Chairman Mo regularly.” Wei Zheng sincerely advised. “Although Young Master did not express it, he hopes that Young Madam can come and accompany him more often.

“Personal Assistant Wei, actually....” Qiao Mianmian glanced at him.

“Young Madam?”

“Actually, you are the one who wants me to visit.”

Wei Zheng giggled.

Qiao Mianmian exposed his wishful thinking and said, “This way, you can leave work early.”

Wei Zheng giggled even more.

...

Qiao Mianmian waited for Mo Yesi to end work. They went for a candlelight dinner and a movie afterward.

They bought the movie tickets for the last row seats of the cinema.

The movie started, and the lights were dimmed. The cinema was pitch-black.

After a short while, Qiao Mianmian heard some noises from the side. She followed the sound and took a peek, awkwardly realizing that the couple beside them were kissing passionately.

Another couple was sitting on the other side.

They were also kissing.

Feeling awkward, she quickly turned back, but she could feel a strong gaze on her in the dark.

Looking up, she saw Mo Yesi staring deeply into her eyes.

She could see Mo Yesi’s glowing eyes.

Qiao Mianmian matched his gaze, gulped nervously, and said with a low voice, “Why are you looking at me instead of watching the movie?”

His jaw tightened while squeezing his cool, slender fingers. He lowered his head and answered with the same low voice, “Baby, why didn’t you tell me previously that we should watch a movie like this?”

“Mmm?” Qiao Mianmian blinked.

He let out a warm breath.

Then, he leaned in towards her.

Mo Yesi chuckled. “You saw what happened just now. Did you pick the last row seats because of this?”

Immediately after, he kissed her, softly biting her lips.

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

He misunderstood her intentions.

She picked the last row seats as they were the only tickets available.

“No, I...”

“Shh...”

He chuckled and bit her lips again softly while holding onto her face. While biting her lips, he said, “Shh, don’t speak, people are watching us.”

“Ah!” Qiao Mianmian exclaimed as she thought it was real. Her mouth opened wide, giving Mo Yesi the chance to kiss her deeply.

After a deep kiss, she laid on his chest panting.

Unbeknownst to her, Mo Yesi pulled her onto his lap, facing him, and hugged her flirtatiously.

She was getting dizzy by his actions.

She had no idea what the movie was about.

Mo Yesi was unsatisfied, but he licked his lips and whispered in her ears, “Today’s movie was really enjoyable.”

...

It was already 10 pm when the movie ended.

When they alighted from the car, they walked hand-in-hand into the villa.

After they headed upstairs, the maids whispered amongst themselves. “Young Master and Young Madam have such a loving relationship. They always look madly in love. I never knew that the Young Master could be so proactive when he’s interested in someone.”
