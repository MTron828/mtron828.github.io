Chapter 2514: She Even Sent an Audio

“Then, we can fight back officially?” Linda was excited.

“Mm.”

“Alright, I’ll go to the office immediately. Just let me know what you need.”

…

At the Shen Corporation.

After Shen Rou picked up Qiao Mianmian’s call, she sneered and said to herself, “You still want to fight with me with this little trick. Qiao Mianmian, don’t even think about making a comeback this time. I won’t give you the chance.

“Don’t you think you’re already a winner in life? I want you to know that you can’t be glorious forever. I’ll be satisfied even if I can’t completely overthrow you and make you despised by everyone.”

Shen Rou had always been clear that she couldn’t completely defeat Qiao Mianmian.

Although the Shen family was much better now with Tang Ya’s help, the family was still in its prime.

As for the Bai family, they and the Shen family used to be on par.

Now that the Shen family was recovering, they were no longer comparable to them.

Qiao Mianmian had the Bai family behind her and Mo Yesi protecting her.

No matter how much she hated her, she had to know the truth.

But to her, ruining Qiao Mianmian’s reputation was a form of revenge.

She would be happy as long as she could make that slut unhappy. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

That slut called just now to get her to talk.

Of course, she wouldn’t let that slut have her way.

That slut wanted to turn over a new leaf, but she refused to let her!

Shen Rou’s lips curled into a cold smile. She opened Weibo and posted the content she had already edited. She even attached an audio clip.

After doing all of this, she turned off her computer.

She coldly muttered, “Gong Zeli, remember, you forced me to do this.”

…

“Gosh, there’s a new melon. Everyone, take a look!”

“Shen Rou personally posted on Weibo to deny Gong Zeli’s words. She said that Gong Zeli is defending Qiao Mianmian and framing her. Moreover, she even posted an audio clip. I heard it just now. The man’s voice was really Gong Zeli’s. He actually admitted that he fell in love with Qiao Mianmian!”

“Gosh, really? This is too exciting. I’ll go take a look immediately.”

“The person who listened to the audio clip came back. A technical expert analyzed it and confirmed that it wasn’t made in post-production. I didn’t expect Gong Zeli and Qiao Mianmian to really have an ambiguous relationship. Gong Zeli actually framed Shen Rou for her. He’s too heartless. No matter what, Shen Rou has known him for many years. Doesn’t he care about their relationship at all? It’s too scary to frame someone for a new woman.”

“I also think that a man like Gong Zeli is so scary. I heard that he treated Shen Rou especially well previously. Many people in the industry think that he really loved her. Sigh, now he doesn’t care about his old love for his new lover. No man is reliable in this day and age.”

“I think Shen Rou is very pitiful. The man who used to dote on her changed his heart and fell in love with another woman. Not only did he cut ties with her because of this, but now he’s framing her for that woman.”
