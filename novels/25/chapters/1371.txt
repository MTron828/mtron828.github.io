Chapter 1372: It’s All My Fault?

When she walked past Lin Huizhen, she glared at her.

Qiao Mianmian pretended not to see it and followed Qiao Ruhai out of the ward.

...

Qiao Mianmian closed the door.

She looked at Qiao Ruhai and walked over. “Dad.”

Qiao Ruhai turned around.

They hadn’t seen each other for a long time.

Because of the previous conflict, they didn’t have any contact.

They were both angry.

Seeing Qiao Ruhai’s haggard face, Qiao Mianmian felt a little sour and worried. She kept quiet for a while before saying, “Dad, how have you been recently? I heard from Aunt Lin that you’re sick. Have you been to the hospital? What did the doctor say?”

After such a long time, her anger and resentment were long gone.

Qiao Mianmian was grateful to Qiao Ruhai.

She wasn’t his biological daughter.

But Qiao Ruhai treated her pretty well.

He doted on her and Qiao Chen too.

When Madam Qiao passed away and he married Lin Huizhen, he started to neglect them.

But as a father, he did his part.

“It’s just the same, why would I want to see a doctor?”

After a while, Qiao Ruhai realized that his eldest daughter had changed a lot.

In the past, Qiao Mianmian was born with good looks. Everyone would praise him for having a daughter who looked like a fairy.

Qiao Mianmian was even prettier now.

Although her facial features were still the same, she looked even more stunning than before.

Even his eyes lit up.

Her dressing was different from before.

The clothes were simple, but it was obvious that they were good.

Her eyes were brighter than before.

Qiao Ruhai recalled what Lin Huizhen said and couldn’t help but feel disappointed.

His daughter.

Even if she wasn’t his biological daughter, he knew that his daughter wasn’t the sort to cling to the rich and powerful.

Hence, he felt that Qiao Mianmian couldn’t possibly not tell him about her return to the Bai family because she was afraid that he would stop her.

But if she really acknowledged her biological parents and didn’t tell him about it, Qiao Ruhai would feel hurt.

“What exactly happened to your sister?” Qiao Ruhai frowned as he thought of Qiao Anxin, who was still unconscious. “Is there a misunderstanding between you two? We’re family, can’t you just sit down and clear things up? Must things turn out this way?

“Your sister hasn’t woken up yet. Mianmian, even if you and Anxin aren’t biological sisters, you two grew up together and are both my daughters. Don’t you have any feelings for her?

“What kind of misunderstanding could be so serious? Are you still blaming Anxin for being with Su Ze? Do you think Anxin snatched Su Ze away?”

Qiao Mianmian looked up in disbelief and hurt.

“Dad, is that what you think of me?”

She couldn’t believe that Father Qiao would say such a thing.

He was biased towards Qiao Anxin.

“Do you think I haven’t treated Qiao Anxin well enough, that I didn’t treat as a sister? Do you think it’s my fault that she’s hospitalized now?” Qiao Mianmian’s heart turned colder with every word.Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates
