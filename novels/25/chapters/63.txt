Chapter 64: What a Vixen

She didn’t have makeup on, but she looked better than many women who did.

Du Ze had seen so many beauties, but all of them together weren’t even as beautiful as her alone.

And that was coming from someone who had played with many women.

Hence, he could tell at one glance that Qiao Mianmian was not only pretty but also had a great figure.

With such a beauty standing before him, Du Ze was almost swooning. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

He decided on the spot that he wanted this gorgeous girl.

The desire in Du Ze’s eyes was so evident that Qiao Mianmian furrowed her brows when she noticed it. She shot him a look of disgust and coldly said, “I am. You’re Shen Yueyue’s godbrother? Are you here to stand up for her?”

Du Ze smiled. “Yue Yue said you’re bullying her. Is that true?”

“Brother Du Ze, you’ve gotta help me teach this woman a lesson!” Shen Yueyue got up when she realized that someone was out to defend her and looked at Qiao Mianmian with hatred in her eyes.

Qiao Mianmian was expressionless. “So what if I was? And so what if I wasn’t?”

Du Ze did not say anything.

He looked at Qiao Mianmian with obvious ill-intentions. A while later, his lips curled up. “Yue Yue and Ting Ting are my sisters. If you’ve bullied them, then, as their brother, how could I take it lying down?”

“But...” His smile looked even more distorted now. “You’re all good friends from the same dormitory room. I’m guessing there must be some misunderstanding here, right?”

“Brother Du Ze, you...”

Upon hearing his words, Shen Yueyue’s and Zhao Wanting’s expressions darkened.

They could recognize the look in Du Ze’s eyes. That was obviously the look of a man attracted to a woman.

They cursed Qiao Mianmian in their hearts.

What a vixen.

She seduces every man she sees.

Du Ze was here to help them out, but now this bitch had seduced him.

Shen Yueyue was about to explode in anger. “Brother Du Ze, there’s no misunderstanding. You saw with your own eyes how she treated me. You already said you were going to help us, you can’t go back on your word.”

But at this point, Du Ze was already strongly attracted to Qiao Mianmian.

He couldn’t be bothered with them.

Ignoring Shen Yueyue, he looked at Qiao Mianmian with a motive. “Student Qiao, why don’t we find somewhere to have a chat? I’m Du Ze, and my father is Du Hai, the Chairman of Sheng Hui Corporation. I believe you’ve heard of this name.”

Du Ze had a domineering stance when he said that.

He looked at Qiao Mianmian’s dressing and guessed that she must be from an ordinary family.

She wouldn’t reject a rich second-generation heir’s advances.

These types of girls were simply materialistic people.

He was proven right with every girl he pursued.

“Brother Du Ze, how could you do this. You were supposed to help us!” Shen Yueyue and Zhao Wanting did not expect him to be so awed by Qiao Mianmian.

Du Ze shot them an impatient look and chided. “Shut up. I’m not talking to you, so keep quiet!”

With that, he turned to Qiao Mianmian and raised a brow. “So, Student Qiao, how about a lunch together? What do you like, I’ll get someone to reserve a place right now.”
