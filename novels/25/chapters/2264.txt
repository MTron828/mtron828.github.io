Chapter 2265: The Romance Fairy Tale Is Actually Fake

Knock, knock.

Suddenly, someone knocked on the door, pulling Shen Rou back from her anger. She looked up and took a deep breath. “Come in.”

The door opened and the secretary walked in.

“What is it?”

“Chairman Shen, there are few reporters downstairs. They said they’re from some television station and that they want to interview Chairman Shen.”

“Reporters?” Shen Rou frowned. “What reporters? Why do they want to interview me?”

“They didn’t share the details, they just said they want to interview Chairman Shen,” the reporter replied.

Shen Rou was too distracted to be in the mood for an interview.

She said directly, “Tell them that I don’t have time for an interview. Tell them to leave.”

“Yes, Chairman Shen.”

The secretary turned around and was about to leave when Shen Rou suddenly thought of something and stopped him. “Wait.”

The secretary stopped in his tracks. “Chairman Shen.”

Shen Rou’s eyes flickered. After a few seconds of silence, she said, “I’ll accept the interview. Let them come up.”

…

Not long after the news about Qiao Mianmian and Mo Yesi’s wedding was released, another piece of news related to the two of them appeared.

#Shocking! The romance fairy tale is actually fake. Someone in the know revealed that there is another reason for the two of them to be together. It definitely has nothing to do with love

Qiao Mianmian was a very popular artiste. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Moreover, she and Mo Yesi had only been on the hot search for a while, and the netizens were still talking about their wedding. With this title, many people naturally paid attention.

This news was quickly trending.

“Could this news be true? Mo Yesi really got together with Qiao Mianmian because of this? But I think I’ve heard about him having misogyny. I found it strange when I found out that he was with Qiao Mianmian. I even thought that he wasn’t attracted to women.”

“I think this news is credible. Everyone knows that Second Young Master Mo doesn’t like women. I think for a normal rich and powerful man, if it isn’t for some problem, it’s impossible for him to not have a woman by his side since he was young. Perhaps he’s really allergic to women, that’s why he didn’t get together with Young Lady Shen. Perhaps it’s also because he’s allergic to Young Lady Shen. Otherwise, with the two of them being childhood sweethearts, and Young Lady Shen being beautiful and infatuated with him, how could he not feel anything?”

“But I think it’d be more believable if someone else exposed it. Since it was Shen Rou who exposed it, I don’t think it’s so believable. She might have deliberately made it up because of jealousy. She wants people to think that Mo Yesi doesn’t like Qiao Mianmian and is just using her. I feel that she’s very scheming.”

“Hehe, I don’t believe what Shen Rou said. She probably hates Qiao Mianmian a lot now. Can you believe what she said?”

“Shen Rou and Mo Yesi have known each other for over 20 years. She must know him very well. I feel that at least half of what she said is true. Mo Yesi is allergic to women. But he definitely isn’t allergic to Qiao Mianmian. As for why, how can I know?”

“Gosh, today’s is so exciting. Wave after wave, it’s like watching a television series.”
