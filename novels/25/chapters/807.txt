Chapter 808: 50 Million Yuan as Compensation

“Sisters are the best.”

The smile on her face faded as Jiang Luoli sighed and put down her chopsticks.

She finished the rest of the beer in one gulp.

“Baby, let me ask you something.”

“Mm, go ahead.”

Jiang Luoli rubbed her temple and kept quiet for a while before saying, “If I tell you that I accepted the check, would you think that... I’m a money-grubber?

“If I had some backbone, shouldn’t I tear the cheque apart in front of him and tell him not to trample on my dignity? Actually, I thought of doing that, but later on, I felt that I had the right to accept it.

“If he dares to give it to me, why wouldn’t I dare to accept it? Just to show that I’m very proud and have a lot of self-esteem, I’m going to push the 50 million yuan away? Wouldn’t I be a fool?

“In any case, we probably won’t meet again in the future. Since he feels guilty towards me and is willing to make it up to me, I’ll accept that sum of money. To be honest, I still have a lot of money to spend in the future. With that 50 million, I can solve many problems.

“Moreover, I’m trying to get investors for a script, and I’m short of money. His money came just in time.”

Qiao Mianmian thought for a while. “I think if it was me...”

“Mm, what would you do?” Jiang Luoli looked at her steadily.

Qiao Mianmian thought for a while and said honestly, “I’d accept the money too.”

Things like tearing the check apart only existed in the novels of domineering presidents.

Who could resist the temptation of 50 million yuan?

And it was delivered voluntarily.

Only a fool would reject such a huge sum of money for their dignity.

But the man who had a one-night stand with Jiang Luoli last night must be someone important.

Not many people could give 50 million in one go.

A man would be willing to pay tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of yuan for a love affair.

But 50 million...

It was indeed a huge sum.

Although it wasn’t obvious just from the money.

But since that man was willing to give Jiang Luoli so much money, he probably liked her a little.

Otherwise, he was very satisfied with her.

But he didn’t even show his face. He got his assistant to bring the money over because he didn’t want her to know his identity.

Or rather, Jiang Luoli would know who he was the moment she saw him.

Hence, Qiao Mianmian guessed that she might know that man too.

He might be a well-known figure. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“You really think so?” Jiang Luoli looked a little better now.

“Mm.” Qiao Mianmian nodded. “50 million, not 5,000. I don’t think anyone can reject this temptation. Anyway, I can’t reject it. As you said, he gave it willingly. Why shouldn’t you take it?”

“Mm, I think so too.”

Jiang Luoli smiled again. “That’s why I accepted it without hesitation. Hahaha, do you know the expression on Assistant Xu’s face? He probably thought I’d be angry and reject him. In the end, I happily accepted the money.

“Anyway, I saw his face darken.”

Qiao Mianmian couldn’t help but laugh as she imagined it.

“Did Assistant Xu read too many novels? Otherwise, why would he think that you would reject the money?”
