Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“I-I’m not angry.” Qiao Mianmian’s face was red. As he inched closer, she felt difficulty breathing.

“Is that so?” Mo Yesi moved towards her again by two centimeters. His warm and gentle breath was against her lips. His fingers were placed on her chin, lightly caressing it. “Kiss me and I’ll believe you.”

“Wait, what?!”

Qiao Mianmian’s eyes widened in shock.

Mo Yesi looked at her slightly opened mouth. He squinted as his eyes flickered in a different light.

Her lips felt amazing.

It had a sweet taste.

He tasted it many times that night.

Thinking of what happened that night, his eyes came even more alive.

Seeing the burning fire in his eyes, Qiao Mianmian got nervous and pushed him away.

She shifted to the side to keep a distance from him. Red as a tomato, she said, “Mo Yesi, can you be more serious?”

She was extremely flustered by his actions.

She even had the urge to run away.

She was like a shocked rabbit with her ears straightened up.

She wasn’t just blushing on her cheek, even her fair ears had now gone pink.

Mo Yesi had to overcome the impulse to pinch her ear affectionately. He didn’t want to make her even shyer than she already was.

After all, he and his little wife were only married for less than a day.

He did not want to scare her too much.

“Ok.” Mo Yesi straightened up and adjusted his buttons. He said with a serious face, “Let’s eat first. We will do the deed after the meal.”

Boom...

Qiao Mianmian’s face reddened as blood rushed to her face.

She could feel her face burning.

From the outside, he looked so solemn and cold.

How was that deep inside, he was so cheeky?

Was he like this in front of others?

On the driver’s seat.

Uncle Li’s face reddened when he heard their conversation.

Gosh, who knew Young Master was such a flirt.

He initially thought that Young Master would not know how to get along with Young Madam.

It seemed like his worries were unnecessary.

They ate at a high-class revolving restaurant.

On the 68th floor of the skyscraper.

The best seat in the restaurant was specially reserved for Mo Yesi at all times.

The manager came to welcome him and greeted respectfully. “Young Master Mo.”

“Mm.” Mo Yesi nodded in reply.

The manager looked at Qiao Mianmian, who exited the lift with Mo Yesi. Seeing her student-like demeanor, he got stunned and asked, “Young Master Mo, this is...?”

“I...”

Before she could say anything more, he wrapped his arm around her waist and pulled her closer forcefully. “This is my wife.”

“Y-Young Madam Mo?!”

The manager stood rooted in shock.

He looked at Qiao Mianmian in disbelief, as if someone just told him doomsday was tomorrow. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

A few seconds later, he came back to his senses and hurriedly bowed towards Qiao Mianmian. “Young Madam Mo, good evening to you.”

“Ahem, good evening.”

It was her first time having people greet her by bowing down.

She seemed a little uneasy.

Mo Yesi looked at her, smirked and walked forward, holding tightly onto her slender waist.

After a couple of steps, Qiao Mianmian suddenly felt a warm breath spilling onto her ears. The fragrance of the man also rushed into her nose.
