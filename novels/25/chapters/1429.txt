Chapter 1432: How Deep Could Such Love Be?

In the car.

Jiang Luoli turned to look out of the window and didn’t say anything.

The man’s low and magnetic voice rang in her ear. “Are you unhappy?”

Jiang Luoli turned around slowly.

Mo Shixiu looked at her intently. “Is it because of my mom?”

Jiang Luoli was stunned again.

Actually, she wasn’t in a bad mood. After all, she was already mentally prepared before she came. She had already expected all sorts of possible outcomes.

But she wasn’t in a good mood.

Madam Mo’s unhappiness and disdain for her were written all over her face. After greeting her, she never spoke to her again.

Madam Mo was Mo Shixiu’s mother.

Jiang Luoli still hoped to get her approval.

Mo Shixiu knew that he was right.

After a moment of silence, he said softly, “Luoli, I hope that my family will like you. But my mom... she has a very strong sense of family background. When Ah Si brought Sister-in-law home, she wasn’t satisfied with her.

“She always hoped that Ah Si and I could find wives of equal social status. But Ah Si and I didn’t like the girls she was satisfied with.

“I can’t correct her opinion, nor can I force her to like you. But I want to say that regardless of whether my family is satisfied with you, since you’re the person I’ve decided on, whether they like you or not, it won’t affect my feelings for you.

“My heart won’t waver.

“Unless you waver first.”

Jiang Luoli looked at him in shock. Her heart started racing uncontrollably.

“I’ll have a good talk with Mom.” Mo Shixiu didn’t seem to know how much his words affected Jiang Luoli. He also didn’t know how disturbed her heart was.

He said seriously, “It’s best if she accepts you. If not, then don’t bother about her. If meeting her makes you unhappy, then if it’s not necessary, you don’t have to meet her in the future.”

Jiang Luoli was shocked.

“Mo Shixiu, don’t you mind that your mom doesn’t like me?”

“Why would I mind?” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“She’s your mother. Don’t you care about her opinion at all? If she’s still dissatisfied with me and can’t accept me, and wants you to find a girl who’s compatible with the Mo family, what... will you do?”

Jiang Luoli liked Mo Shixiu.

But it wasn’t to the point where she couldn’t leave him.

She was a good-looking person.

Liking Mo Shixiu was just love at first sight.

How much could he like her?

Hence, she felt that it was better to clarify things now.

If Mo Shixiu cared about Madam Mo’s opinion and was the kind of man who listened to his mother, she could break up with him early.

It was better to be quick.

She would feel a little reluctant to break up with him now, but it was better than being apart in the future.

Jiang Luoli had never suffered any emotional blow, nor had she been tormented by love.

But she had seen how others felt when they were emotionally affected.

She didn’t want to experience that feeling at all.

Mo Shixiu pondered for a moment as if he was seriously considering her question.
