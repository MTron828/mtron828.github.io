Chapter 444: Didn’t He Just Give Her a Bouquet Earlier That Day?

“Qiao Mianmian, don’t be too smug. We’ll wait and see!”

Bai Xiao said through clenched teeth and turned around to leave.

“Qiao Mianmian, do you really want to be this heartless?” Zhang Yuwei tossed her a final question before leaving the classroom behind Bai Xiao.

The crowd of students slowly dissipated when they realized that the “show” had ended.

All of a sudden, the classroom filled to the brim emptied out.

Qiao Mianmian stood rooted to the ground with her brows furrowed, then slowly made her way out.

“Bloody hell, I really want to punch Bai Xiao in the face! She said she’s going to expose you. Something’s wrong with her brain.” Jiang Luoli felt upset on Qiao Mianmian’s behalf.

Qiao Mianmian smiled. “Let them be. I didn’t do anything against my conscience, so I’m not afraid of her.”

“I just think she’s way too shameless.”

They left the classroom.

Jiang Luoli was still murmuring unhappily. “Honestly, she deserves to be expelled. We’re in the same school and faculty as such a disgusting person. If she doesn’t leave school, won’t we have to see her often?

“It irks me.”

Jiang Luoli seemed to detest them more than Qiao Mianmian did.

She couldn’t stop complaining about them.

Qiao Mianmian listened to her silently before breaking a helpless smile. “They’re really vile, and I have no intention to forgive them. But, isn’t expulsion a little excessive?”

Jiang Luoli widened her eyes. “Mianmian, are you trying to be a saint?”

Qiao Mianmian said, “... I never thought that way.”

“That’s good.” Jiang Luoli said, “Don’t be too nice to them. Just think of what they did to you; if they hadn’t been found out and threatened with expulsion, do you think they’d ever apologize to you?

“Didn’t you see how insincere Bai Xiao was?

“People like them won’t feel gratitude towards you at all even if you let them off.

“For all you know, they might be even more unhappy with you and find other chances to get back at you.

“Since they’ll never appreciate your kindness, you might as well not treat them with any.”

Qiao Mianmian went quiet for a while. “I know. But, I feel like Zhang Yuwei isn’t that mean.”

The person who left those mean comments about her was mainly Bai Xiao.

Zhang Yuwei took part too, but she wasn’t half as bad.

“Zhang Yuwei is just that wee bit better. You can consider her words and pleas. But for Bai Xiao, I don’t think there’s a need to think further.” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

As they spoke, Qiao Mianmian’s cell phone began to ring.

She saw that it was an unknown caller and picked it up. It was a male voice. “Hi, is this Miss Qiao Mianmian?”

“I am. Uh, you are...”

“I’m the florist from Love of a Lifetime. Someone has ordered a bouquet of flowers for you. May I know where you are now, so I can send it over to you?”

A while later.

Qiao Mianmian hung up.

She rubbed her temple, a little confused.

Why did Mo Yesi send her flowers again?

Didn’t he just give her a bouquet earlier that day?

Although she did like flowers, receiving them a few times a day was excessive.

The flowers were inedible and non-functional. It was too much of a waste to let them rot in her room.

“Why, who was that?” Jiang Luoli asked curiously.
