“You haven’t even gone home to see him once.

“Qiao Mianmian, you’re such an ingrate. Your dad treated you so well since you were young. Even if you aren’t his biological daughter, he never mistreated you. Is this how you repay him now?”

Qiao Mianmian frowned when she heard that Father Qiao was sick.

“Aunt Lin, why are you looking for me?” Qiao Mianmian looked at Lin Huizhen’s flamboyant expression and said, “If Aunt Lin is just here to tell me this, then I already know. I’ll call Dad later to ask about his current situation. If there’s nothing else, then I’ll leave.”

With that, she turned around.

“Stop right there.” Lin Huizhen’s angry voice reached her ears. “You know why I’m here. Qiao Mianmian, I don’t care who you are or how impressive you are. If you dare to bully Anxin, I won’t let you have it easy.

“The Qiao family is your benefactor. Do you still have a conscience to bully us like this?”

Qiao Mianmian stopped in her tracks and turned around.

The smile on her face was gone. She said coldly, “Aunt Lin, why don’t I understand what you mean? I’m sure you know what your daughter did. I should be the one saying that.

“Aunt Lin knows very well who’s the one bullying who, isn’t it? Even if you’re biased, you can’t be inverted. I definitely have a conscience, but your daughter might not.

“If she did, she wouldn’t have done such terrible things.

“When she snatched her sister’s boyfriend, did she have a conscience? When she pretended to be her sister and wanted to replace her sister, did she have a conscience? As long as she had a conscience, she wouldn’t do such a thing.

“Now, you’re asking me if I have a conscience?” Qiao Mianmian sneered and took a step forward.

Lin Huizhen’s expression changed, and she immediately took a step back. She looked at her cautiously and said, “What are you trying to do? Qiao Mianmian, this is your workplace. If you dare to mess around, you’ll be on the headlines immediately!”

“Oh, is that so?” Qiao Mianmian looked nonchalant. “I’ve been on the news too many times. I don’t care this time.

“Aunt Lin.” Qiao Mianmian’s voice turned cold. “You know very well what Qiao Anxin has done. I remember the Qiao family’s kindness and didn’t go too far because of Dad.”

“You didn’t go too far?” Lin Huizhen was furious when she heard this. “You got someone to ban Anxin and wanted to cut off her future, how is that not going too far? Even if Anxin did something wrong, without her, would you be where you are today? Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“If you didn’t break up with Su Ze, would you know another man? If it wasn’t for her impersonation, would the Bai family know of your existence? Speaking of which, you have to thank Anxin. Everything you have now is all thanks to Anxin.”

“What ban?” Qiao Mianmian was stunned. “I didn’t get anyone to ban Qiao Anxin.”

“Stop pretending.” Lin Huizhen grabbed her hand and glared at her. “Do you dare to say that you didn’t do it? You’re trying to ruin Anxin. Qiao Mianmian, let me tell you, don’t think that I can’t do anything to you just because you’re the daughter of the Bai family now.”
