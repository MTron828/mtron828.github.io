Chapter 123: Why Is the Counselor Acting Weird?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“But...” She suddenly smiled and said, “Things would be different if I can find a man as outstanding as Prince Charming. If that happens, I guess I could spend some time being in love. But the chances of it happening are too slim. So, I think it’s best I remain single.”

“Mm, our Luo Luo is so outstanding. If you don’t find a good enough man, how could he be fitting for you?” Qiao Mianmian nodded. “It’s better to be single than to be with a man who isn’t suitable.”

Qiao Mianmian felt that not many men were good enough for Jiang Luoli.

Jiang Luoli was beautiful. She was 1.70m in height and had a great figure. She was the sort of beauty that stood out at first glance.

She and Qiao Mianmian were different sorts of women.

Qiao Mianmian was more simple and elegant, like a little goddess.

Jiang Luoli was like a cheerful fairy.

One was a passive kind of beauty while the other seemed more active. They were known as the “Beautiful Duo” by some boys in school.

Moreover, Jiang Luoli was a very independent girl. Her family wasn’t very well-off, and even her three years of college fees were earned on her own.

Her appearance was outstanding, and many online stores engaged her as a model. Most of the clothing styles she modeled sold very well.

Hence, she was rather known in that field and made pretty good money out of it.

Although she wasn’t a celebrity, her earnings were better than most average people.

...

After their rest, they headed back.

When they arrived at their door, they saw a silhouette rushing out.

Qiao Mianmian and Jiang Luoli had a scare.

Before they saw the person’s face, they heard a polite voice, “Student Qiao, Student Jiang, you’re finally back.”

Qiao Mianmian and Jiang Luoli had no idea what was going on.

Wasn’t that... the counselor’s voice?

Both of them looked up and saw a polite, apprehensive man standing before them. Wasn’t that their counselor?

He looked so much less stern and firm than before.

His hands were clasped together and he looked as if he was facing two superiors rather than students. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Qiao Mianmian and Jiang Luoli exchanged looks of confusion.

What was going on?

Why was the counselor acting weird?

And did he just address them politely, as if they were his respected elders?

Before they figured out what was happening, the counselor suddenly took a step back and bowed towards them. “Student Qiao, Student Jiang, I was in the wrong previously. It wasn’t right of me to punish you for others’ wrongdoings. After my self-reflection, I’ve realized my mistake. I will never make such a mistake again, so please give me a chance to correct myself. Please forgive me.”

With that, he bowed again at them.

Both of them remained silent and in shock.

What... was going on?!

Why was the counselor doing self-reflection and apologizing instead?

Seeing that they weren’t reacting, the counselor panicked. “Student Qiao, Student Jiang, I’ve really realized my mistake!”
