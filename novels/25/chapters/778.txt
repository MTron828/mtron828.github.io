Chapter 779: What Must I Do for You to Leave My Son?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

She still despised it.

It was obvious how much she despised her daughter-in-law.

If she hadn’t collected the marriage certificate with Mo Yesi before he brought her home, Madam Mo definitely wouldn’t have agreed to Mo Yesi marrying her.

Madam Mo’s favorite daughter-in-law was Shen Rou.

The Shen and Mo families were indeed compatible.

Shen Rou and Mo Yesi were very compatible. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

And they grew up together.

This was very rare.

Everyone around them probably thought that they would end up together.

Madam Mo thought so too.

But who would’ve thought that Mo Yesi would suddenly marry without telling them? He even found her a daughter-in-law that she was extremely dissatisfied with.

Naturally, Madam Mo didn’t like her at all.

She might even think that she was the one who instigated Mo Yesi to get married first and that she was a scheming woman.

“Qiao Mianmian, I’m not a person who likes to beat around the bush, so I’ll be frank with you.” Madam Mo’s eyes were cold and impatient as if saying anything more to her would make her uncomfortable.

Her voice was cold. “Tell me, what must I do for you to leave my son?

“How much do you want? Give me a number. As long as you don’t ask for too much, I can satisfy you.”

Her tone was full of sympathy.

Qiao Mianmian’s heart sank.

Initially, she thought that Madam Mo came because of her scandal.

Unexpectedly, she was here to persuade her to leave Mo Yesi.

In the end, it was she who ended up breaking up the couple.

Qiao Mianmian was shocked for a moment, but she quickly calmed down.

She kept quiet for a while, looked at Madam Mo, and said calmly, “Mom, are you kidding me? Mo Yesi and I are already married, and we don’t have any relationship problems. How could I leave him?”

Madam Mo’s expression darkened.

She glared at Qiao Mianmian for a few seconds before saying coldly, “Don’t play dumb with me. Don’t pretend that you don’t understand what I’m saying. Your marriage with Ah Si didn’t even get the approval of us elders. Do you think that by coaxing him to get the certificate, we can only accept this?

“Let me tell you clearly, I won’t accept you. Ah Si’s other half can’t possibly be a woman like you. If you still have some self-awareness, you can get a huge sum of money, enough for you to live a luxurious life.

“If you still want to cling onto Ah Si and fantasize about something that doesn’t belong to you, then the final outcome might be nothing.

“I advise you to be smart.”

Qiao Mianmian pursed her lips at Madam Mo’s arrogance. “Mom, I didn’t coax Mo Yesi to marry me. He was the one who suggested it.

“I’ve never thought of harassing him. I’m with him because I like him and want to be with him.”

Even if her initial intention wasn’t like this, she wanted to be with him now because she liked him.

It was only then that they expressed their feelings for each other.
