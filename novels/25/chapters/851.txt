Chapter 853: Acting on the Spur of the Moment

But everyone in the crew knew that this newbie had Bai Yusheng by her side. Moreover, he doted on her a lot.

Any female artiste that Bai Yusheng wanted to groom, how could he not be able to?

Moreover, this newbie’s looks were really outstanding. There was a high chance that she would become popular in the future.

Hence, whether it was because of Bai Yusheng or for other reasons, it wasn’t wrong to be polite to her now.

...

Qiao Mianmian changed and left the dressing room.

The female artistes previously with Huang Yilin now walked towards her and greeted her. “Hi, Mianmian. Are you done with your makeup? Wow, you’re so beautiful.”

“Yes, it suits you very well.”

“Director Bai has good taste. Mianmian, you’re very suitable for the female lead role.”

“Actually, I felt that Mianmian was more suitable for the female lead role than Huang Yilin. It’s just that Huang Yilin is more popular. Thankfully, Director Bai likes to use newbies. Otherwise, it’d be a pity if Mianmian missed this role.”

The few of them went on and on praising her.

They didn’t look embarrassed at all.

But Qiao Mianmian was embarrassed.

Although these female artistes didn’t do anything to harm her, they did ostracize her with Huang Yilin previously.

And now they were acting as if nothing had happened and chatting with her as if they were close.

She was really embarrassed.

She felt that these people were too realistic.

“Wow, you guys are so shameless. Weren’t you ignoring Sister Mianmian just now? You were so close to Huang Yilin back then, why are you criticizing her now?”

“Your decisiveness is really impressive.”

Nana handed Qiao Mianmian a glass of water and mocked them. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Nana saw how they treated Qiao Mianmian previously.

Now that they were bootlicking her, she was annoyed.

The few female artistes’ expressions changed when they heard her insult.

They looked like they wanted to flare up, but they had to hold it in.

“Alright, Nana. That’s enough.” Qiao Mianmian didn’t want to bother with these female artistes, but she didn’t want to offend them.

Nana said a few words and felt a little regretful when she saw the female artistes’ expressions darken.

She was irrational again.

It was a good thing that these female artistes didn’t have much of a reputation. They were just small characters in the production crew and weren’t as threatening as Huang Yilin.

The few female artistes were here to flatter Qiao Mianmian.

Seeing how Qiao Mianmian ignored them and was scolded by Nana, they felt bored and left.

Nana watched them leave and couldn’t help but sneer. “Hmph, bootlickers. I hate people who act according to the situation the most. Previously, they were still following Huang Yilin, but now that she’s in trouble, they immediately ran to you.”

“Sister Mianmian, don’t bother about them.”

Qiao Mianmian nodded. “I didn’t intend to bother about them.”

“Sister Mianmian, you look especially good with this makeup,” said Nana, looking away from them.
