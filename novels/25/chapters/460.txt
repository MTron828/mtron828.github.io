Chapter 461: So Why Do You Dislike Her?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Fourth Bro? Fourth Bro!” Yan Shaoqing said as he realized that Gong Zeli wasn’t responding to him. He looked at Gong Zeli and realized that he was spacing out.

He wasn’t aware of what was going on in his head. But Gong Zeli was putting a lot of thought into it.

Yan Shaoqing was speechless. He waved his hand in front of Gong Zeli’s eyes and said, “What are you thinking of?”

Finally, Gong Zeli stopped spacing out.

He then looked at Shen Rou puzzledly.

He already didn’t remember clearly what happened when he was ten years old.

But he was sure about the smell. It was rooted in his brain, and even after all these years, he could still remember.

He already forgot what perfume Shen Rou was using that night.

But after all these years, Shen Rou already stopped using that perfume.

He did ask her before, but she replied coldly that she didn’t like the smell anymore and that the perfume already ceased production.

But he noticed the same smell on Qiao Mianmian.

If the perfume already ceased production, how could Qiao Mianmian still have it?

He had many questions, and he needed answers.

Maybe he should clarify things with Qiao Mianmian.

He wasn’t sure whether the smell played a part, but he found that he didn’t dislike her that much anymore.

But he still didn’t like her though.

“It’s nothing.”

Gong Zeli stopped looking at Shen Rou, got up, and said, “I’ll be going to the bathroom, you two can continue the talk.”

After saying that, he turned and exited the room.

Yan Shaoqing thought for a while as he saw Gong Zeli leave the room. He stood up and said smilingly to Shen Rou, “Rourou, I need to use the bathroom too. Just order anything you want, I’ll foot the bill for tonight.

“Oh right, there are some new hosts. They are handsome with a good figure, would you want them too?”

Shen Rou glared at him, threw the pillow at him, and screamed. “Yan Shaoqing, you are asking for death!”

Yan Shaoqing replied innocently, “Whatever floats your boat, then.”

...

Outside of the room.

Gong Zeli didn’t go to the bathroom. Instead, he leaned against the walls of the walkway. He stuck his hands in his pockets and raised his head to look at the lights.

The lights were blinding. He had to close his eyes before slowly opening them after a while. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

The door of the room opened again.

It was Yan Shaoqing. He was shocked when he saw Gong Zeli but quickly closed the door with a smile.

“What’s wrong, weren’t you heading to the bathroom?”

Gong Zeli looked at him before replying coldly, “The atmosphere inside was too suffocating. I needed a change in the environment.”

“Me too.”

Yan Shaoqing put one of his hands into his pocket and stood next to Gong Zeli. After a moment of silence, he said, “What did Rourou tell you?”

Gong Zeli bit his lip and replied, “She didn’t say much.”

“It has to do with Second Bro, right?” Yan Shaoqing could’ve guessed it without Gong Zeli’s help. “What’s she thinking? Why can’t she let go? Second Bro is married already. You have seen for yourself how much he cares about Sis-in-law. Fourth Bro, if you keep this up, our friendship won’t last much longer.”

Yan Shaoqing usually had a jovial demeanor. However, he had a serious look now and said, “I can understand why Rourou doesn’t like Sis-in-law, but what’s your reason for not liking her?

“I don’t think she offended you previously. So why do you dislike her?”
