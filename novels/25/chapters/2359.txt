Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

After the reporter asked this question, even Zhan Bo turned around and waited for her answer curiously.

He knew about this too. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Zhan Bo was a gossipy person.

His verified Weibo account was managed by a company team, but he had another account.

He often logged into his alternate account and scrolled through Weibo’s trending topics.

Qiao Mianmian remained calm. She didn’t show any anger or other emotions.

After a few seconds of silence, she smiled and answered, “I don’t have any opinion. Everyone has different standards for judging a person’s acting skills. Moreover, I know that I’m lacking in some areas, so I’ll work harder in the future and give everyone better performances.

“Although I can’t satisfy everyone, I hope to satisfy at least 80% of the viewers. This is a goal I set for myself. I’ll work hard to achieve it.”

She answered gracefully and even humbly.

She didn’t belittle Shen Rou at all.

In comparison, Shen Rou’s evaluation was too petty.

…

After the interview, Qiao Mianmian entered the venue and found her seat.

After a while, Shen Rou also walked the red carpet and was interviewed by the reporters.

A reporter said, “Miss Shen, Qiao Mianmian just said that her wedding with Chairman Mo will be held next year. Everyone knows that the Mo and Shen families are long-time friends. Miss Shen and Chairman Mo have been friends for many years. So, I want to ask Miss Shen, will you be attending the wedding?”

Shen Rou was posing and letting the reporters take photos with a business-like smile. However, the moment the reporter asked this question, the smile on her face froze and her entire face stiffened.

A few seconds later, her expression returned to normal.

But it was still a little stiff and unnatural.

“If they invite me, of course I’ll go.” She tried her best to appear nonchalant about it. Just like how she repeatedly told herself that she no longer cared about Mo Yesi, she still couldn’t help but pay attention to his every move. Her mood would still be affected by him.

Even though she knew that Mo Yesi and Qiao Mianmian were already married, she still got sad and jealous after hearing the reporters mention their wedding.

She realized that she still cared about him.

The man she’d liked for over 20 years.

She hated him now, but she still loved him.

If there was no love, where would the hatred come from?

Her feelings for Mo Yesi were intertwined with love and hatred. She felt that she hated this man to death and wanted to destroy his happiness with everything she had. She wanted him to experience pain too.

She missed him terribly. She even had that unrealistic hope that they had a future together.

She couldn’t let go of him.

She couldn’t possibly like another man.

Although she used to think that Gong Zeli was good and that she liked him too, when it came down to it, she only liked him.

But she loved Mo Yesi.
