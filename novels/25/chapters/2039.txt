Chapter 2040: Watch Your Face

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Qiao Mianmian was stunned and turned to look at her.

Shen Rou smiled. “You relied on Ah Si to attend this party, right? After all, you’re not qualified enough. Tell me, you’re the only newbie among all the guests today. Aren’t you embarrassed?”

“Shen Rou.” Qiao Mianmian smiled and called her name.

“It’s been a long time. I don’t think we’ve seen each other since your Shen family’s problem. I heard that your family suddenly pulled in an investor and now you’re back in the game. Seems like it’s true.

“Otherwise, some people wouldn’t have the face to see others and would continue hiding at home..”

“How can you be like this?”

Shen Rou narrowed her eyes. “Qiao Mianmian, who are you talking about!”

“Whoever you think it is.” Qiao Mianmian looked nonchalant.

“You!”

“Miss Shen, I advise you to watch your expression. After all, there are so many cameras at the scene, and you’re already making such a face. Miss Shen’s so-called elegant demeanor as a rich young lady is gone,” Qiao Mianmian said slowly. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Shen Rou’s expression changed as she looked around.

When she saw that there were indeed many cameras, her expression changed again.

Qiao Mianmian ignored her.

A few minutes later, the emcee went on stage and announced the start of the charity banquet.

Typically, such charity banquets would firstly increase its influence and appeal through the artistes before raising a sum of money. The money would then be donated by all the artistes present.

But this didn’t have high requirements for the artistes.

Usually, an artiste would auction off a personal item and then donate the money to a charity organization.

These were all processes. Generally, the donated personal items weren’t too expensive. It was all about participation.

In such a way, the final buyers were basically the fans.

Some fans bought their idol’s personal belongings. An ordinary T-shirt could sometimes be sold for tens of thousands.

For example, Zhan Bo.

He took out a necklace that he’d worn during the previous events. He’d just displayed it when someone outside the live-stream offered 10,000 yuan.

And the necklace’s original price was only 1,000 yuan.

Zhan Bo had worn it before, so there was naturally no shortage of rich female fans who spent a huge sum to buy it.

Soon, the bid surpassed 30,000 yuan.

In the end, it was sold for 100,000 yuan.

“Our Zhan Bo’s fans are so rich.” The emcee was shocked by how generous the Zhan Bo’s fans were and couldn’t help but sigh. “This necklace was auctioned at a price many times higher than we expected. I hope the results of the auction will get better.

“Let’s thank Zhan Bo for supporting our gala and for the donation. This money will be used to help poor children all over the country.”

After the emcee shook hands with Zhan Bo and thanked him, Zhan Bo bowed to the people below the stage and then returned.

“Next, let us invite Miss Shen Rou to the stage.”
