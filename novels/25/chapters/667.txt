Chapter 668: What Sin Have I Committed

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Qiao Mianmian was stunned.

Beside her, Nana was deep in thought.

After a few seconds of shock, Qiao Mianmian said politely, “Thank you, Mr. Tu.”

“No need to thank me. From today onwards, you can treat me as a friend. It’s only right for friends to help each other.” Tu Yilei smiled after he said that. He looked really good when he smiled, revealing eight neat and white teeth. He looked especially youthful, sunny, and energetic.

He was a young man.

At that moment, it reminded her of the guy she liked for the first time.

Even Qiao Mianmian felt that Tu Yilei looked really good when he smiled.

Although her husband was also a super hunk.

But Tu Yilei and Mo Yesi were two completely different types.

One was a mature elite.

The other a clean and sunny young man.

The former was the type that women liked the most.

The latter was a girl’s favorite type.

“Little Tu Tu, I’ve been looking for you for a long time. So you’re here.

“Why are you with that girl again?

“You left so quickly, I couldn’t see you in the blink of an eye. Could it be that you came to look for her?”

Not too far away, Michael hurried over.

Just as he reached Tu Yilei, he pulled him behind him like a mother hen protecting her chick.

Then, he glared at Qiao Mianmian with a look of wariness. He was so angry that his brows were about to explode. “Hey, what’s wrong with you, little girl? Why is our Little Tu with you again?

“Don’t use your good looks to attract our Little Tu Tu to look for you. Let me tell you, our Little Tu Tu is on the rise now. I won’t allow him to date!!”

“Ahem, Michael, shut up!” Tu Yilei walked out from behind him awkwardly and covered his mouth. “What are you talking about, didn’t I tell you that I don’t have any plans to date now!

“If you keep acting like this, I’ll change managers!”

“Uh... Little Tu... Let go.” Michael pushed his hand away angrily and stomped his foot. “You said you don’t like this little girl. You even said something like changing managers for her. Sob, what sin have I committed for such a little ingrate to appear?

“Think about it, I went through so much trouble to turn you from a nobody to a top rookie. Is this how you treat me? Ah? You actually said you wanted to replace me. You actually...

“I’m so sad...

“You heartless boy. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“I’d rather have a piece of you.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

Nana was speechless.

Tu Yilei was speechless.

“Ahem, don’t take it to heart.” Tu Yilei rubbed his temple and said helplessly, “Michael occasionally has bouts of madness, but he’ll be fine in a while. If he scared you, I’ll apologize on his behalf.”

“Little brat, who did you say has bouts.” Michael exploded again.

He reached out to hit him.

Tu Yilei ducked.

“Alright, Michael.” He took a deep breath and said, “Let’s talk somewhere else, alright?”
