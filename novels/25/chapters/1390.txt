Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Sister, rest in the living room for a while. Watch the television and eat some fruit snacks. I’m going to the kitchen.”

“Then, let me help you.”

Qiao Mianmian wanted to be with him.

Qiao Chen sat her down. “No need, I can do it alone. Sister, don’t bother about anything. Just wait for me to cook for you. I haven’t cooked for you in a long time, so let me perform well.”

He then rolled up his sleeves and walked towards the kitchen.

...

An hour later, the table was filled with a sumptuous lunch.

Every dish was delicious.

Qiao Chen handed Qiao Mianmian a pair of chopsticks and sat down beside her. He then scooped a bowl of soup for her.

“Sister, have some soup first. I haven’t cooked in a while, I wonder if my culinary skills have deteriorated.”

Qiao Mianmian took the soup from him and took a sip. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Mm, it’s delicious.” Qiao Mianmian finished half a bowl in one go. She looked at the table full of dishes, then at the young man’s exquisite and handsome face. Qiao Mianmian couldn’t help but think that whoever married Qiao Chen in the future would definitely be pampered like a princess.

Her brother was good-looking, had a good personality, and knew how to dote on others.

He was still the Young Master of the Mo family.

The only flaw was that he was still sick.

But his illness could be cured.

When he was cured, he wouldn’t have any flaws.

Qiao Mianmian didn’t know if they would spend more time together after Qiao Chen officially returned to the Mo family.

She was even more afraid that Qiao Chen would change after returning to the Mo family.

She wasn’t worried that Qiao Chen would change.

She was just afraid that he would be forced to change.

Qiao Chen looked the same as before, but Qiao Mianmian could feel that his smile wasn’t as pure as before.

His eyes weren’t as pure as before.

She couldn’t tell what had changed in him, but she could feel that Qiao Chen was a little different from before.

He didn’t look as sunny as before.

There was a hint of gloominess in the teenager’s eyes.

“Sister.”

Qiao Chen put some more food into Qiao Mianmian’s bowl. He didn’t eat much himself and was just putting food into Qiao Mianmian’s bowl.

“Mm?” Qiao Mianmian swallowed a piece of fish and looked up at him.

Qiao Chen smiled. Seeing that she liked fish, he placed another piece in her bowl.

He put down his chopsticks and looked straight into Qiao Mianmian’s eyes. “I’ve decided not to join a professional team in the future. I’ll go to Dad’s company to train first. After graduating from university, I’ll start working.”

Qiao Mianmian was stunned.

She was shocked. “You’re not going to join a professional team?”

“Mm.” Qiao Chen replied calmly. “I’m not going.”

But Qiao Mianmian knew that playing in a professional team was his dream.

He wasn’t going?

No matter how nonchalant he sounded, Qiao Mianmian knew that he must be very upset.

He didn’t really want to go to work.

This was definitely not the choice he wanted.

“Chen Chen, have you thought it through?” Qiao Mianmian put down her chopsticks and said seriously, “Do you know what your choice means? Can you get used to working at your dad’s company? Do you like that life?”
