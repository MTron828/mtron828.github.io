Chapter 1658: She Didn’t Want to Be That Pitiful

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

How could this be?

Why was this little slut so lucky?

Shen Fei actually stood up for her, and the scriptwriter even said that Qiao Mianmian was the second female lead she picked.

The public opinion was already bad for that slut.

But the moment Shen Fei and the scriptwriter appeared, the situation changed.

The negative comments about that slut were gone.

Qiao Anxin couldn’t take it lying down.

She didn’t understand why that slut was so lucky.

Qiao Anxin knew what kind of person Shen Fei was. This had nothing to do with Shen Fei at all. She could have stood up for her. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

There was no such thing as being forced by power.

There was no such thing as trying to please Qiao Mianmian.

With Shen Fei’s personality and her current status in the entertainment industry, she didn’t need to please anyone.

And that movie scriptwriter was famous for being cold and aloof. Because her scripts, whether it was a movie or a television drama, they exploded with every statistic. Even if she had a bad temper, she didn’t lack people begging her to write their script.

She didn’t lack money or fame.

Like Shen Fei, she didn’t need to gain resources by pleasing others.

Hence, they had to be willing to help Qiao Mianmian.

But why?

Why would Shen Fei be willing to help a newbie?

She didn’t have much of a relationship with Qiao Mianmian.

Thinking about it, Qiao Mianmian was the only one with good luck.

Qiao Anxin didn’t know that Qiao Mianmian’s audition was a success.

She only found out today when she saw the list of actors posted on the official account.

She hadn’t even auditioned, but that slut Qiao Mianmian could get the second female lead role.

Qiao Anxin knew what the second female lead role meant.

After that movie, Qiao Mianmian’s value would be completely different.

As for her.

Qiao Mianmian’s resources were getting better, but hers were getting worse.

It wasn’t easy to connect to a B-list commercial now.

Most of the scripts given to her were online dramas for silly and sweet female leads. There wasn’t even one television drama.

If this continued...

She had been struggling to maintain her status as a first-tier actress, but she would soon fall to the second-tier, the third-tier...

Then, she would be forgotten by the audience.

Qiao Anxin was terrified.

She didn’t want to be forgotten.

She didn’t want to become such a pitiful person.

As long as she could become popular, she would pay any price.

She’d already lost to that slut in other aspects.

She couldn’t lose to that slut in her career.

Qiao Anxin bit her lip with eyes full of ambition.

The bathroom door opened.

A skinny man about 1.8 meters tall walked out.

The man was wrapped in a towel. He wasn’t very handsome, but he looked very masculine.

Especially the scar that ran from his forehead to the corner of his eye was even more vicious. This man was obviously not someone to be trifled with.

Qiao Anxin immediately adjusted her expression and walked towards him with a smile.

“Young Master Quan.” She walked to the man and greeted him.

Quan Dong reached out and pulled her into his arms. “Can’t wait?”
