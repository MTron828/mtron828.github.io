Chapter 640: Are You Trying to Starve Me to Death?

Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Qiao Mianmian’s heart palpitated wildly.

Mo Yesi... was flirting with her again.

But every time he did, her heart wouldn’t listen to him.

One moment, she was very slow, the next, she was very fast. The next moment, she didn’t seem to be moving at all.

She really was a good-for-nothing.

But was Mo Yesi a normal man?

No one would be able to handle such a handsome and flirtatious husband.

“Ahem! Alright, I won’t joke anymore. The film studio isn’t too far from Yuncheng City. I promise you, I’ll come back to see you whenever I have the time, alright?” Qiao Mianmian actually couldn’t bear to leave for so long.

Their relationship was on the rise, and they couldn’t bear to be apart for so long.

But love and career were equally important.

Actually, Qiao Mianmian felt very stressed after marrying Mo Yesi.

It was much more stressful than when she was single.

This pressure wasn’t financial but from the gap between them.

The more outstanding he was, the more pressure she felt.

He would think that she wasn’t good enough for him.

Hence, she hoped to achieve some results as soon as possible. Even if those results weren’t worth mentioning in front of him, at least she could see herself improving.

She wanted to earn a sum of money to give her a sense of security.

The girl hung her arms around his neck and looked at him with her dark and watery eyes. Her voice was also soft and gentle.

How could Mo Yesi say no to her?

Although unhappy, he still nodded. “Alright.”

“I knew you were the best.”

Qiao Mianmian took the opportunity to kiss him.

She pecked him lightly and was about to back off when Mo Yesi held her waist and pressed her against him. He then lowered his head and kissed her hard.

“Mm...”

Qiao Mianmian struggled for a while before stammering. “Mo Yesi, I-I still have to pack my luggage.”

“Don’t worry about it, I’ll help you with it later.” The man’s voice was low and hoarse. His arm around her waist was getting warmer and warmer. He pinched her chin and kissed her deeply again.

“No... I-I need to sleep early...”

“It’s only seven o’clock now. Go to bed at ten and pack your luggage for another hour. We still have two hours...”

“B-But...” Her lips were once again sealed.

“Baby, you’re leaving for a few months tomorrow, and you don’t even want to feed your husband properly. Are you trying to starve me to death?”

“I...”

“Shh... Baby, we don’t have much time left. Let’s not waste it on meaningless conversations.”

The man carried her out of the walk-in closet.

** *

Mo Yesi didn’t waste a single minute of the two hours.

It had been two hours since he placed Qiao Mianmian on the huge black bed.

When the last time ended, her voice was hoarse.

She was drenched in sweat as if someone had scooped her up from the water.

She had no energy left.

It was as if the fox demon had drained her of all her blood. She stayed in the bathtub and allowed Mo Yesi to clean her up.

After he finished showering her, he wrapped her in a towel and carried her back to the bed. She was so tired that she fell asleep soon after.
