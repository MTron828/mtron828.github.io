The man looked at her steadily but gently.

Qiao Mianmian’s heart actually skipped a beat. “Mo Yesi...”

He placed his hand on her head lightly and stroked her hair. “I don’t know how others date and how they behave in a relationship, but I will try to understand more. I hope to give you as normal an experience as possible.

“Mianmian, I owe you the whole dating process. Could you give me a chance to make up for it?”

Qiao Mianmian couldn’t express how she felt right then.

Something was tugging at her heartstrings for sure when Mo Yesi said all these to her.

It was true.

She and Mo Yesi got married too quickly.

They’d gotten their marriage certificate after knowing each other for less than a day.

She had to move back into her dormitory thereafter, so they had very little time together.

They barely had time to meet, much less go out on dates.

Moreover, there wasn’t much of a need to date since they were already married.

At least, that was what she expected Mo Yesi to think.

He said he owed her a dating experience.

He said he wanted her to give him a chance.

Qiao Mianmian eyed him for a while. “You really think this way?”

Mo Yesi held her little hand and kissed it. “Mm.”

“If you put it this way, then you owe me more than just the dating experience.”

“Mm?” The man raised a brow.

Qiao Mianmian looked at him and said, “If we’re going by the conventional process, then you’ve got to pursue me first. Only after I agree to get together with you can we start dating.”

Mo Yesi was stunned for several seconds.

“You want me to pursue you?” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Qiao Mianmian raised a brow too. “Why, you’re not willing to?”

For some reason, Mo Yesi didn’t feel so good when he looked into her questioning eyes.

Hence, he hesitated and deliberated silently.

“Ding!”

They got to the sixth floor, and the doors opened.

Qiao Mianmian sighed. “Forget I said that.”

She wasn’t surprised.

They were already officially married, why would he still have to pursue her.

This was a little... silly.

She turned around and was about to get off the elevator when she felt his coarse hand on hers.

She heard him say, “Alright, I’ll pursue you first. Whichever you like.”

Qiao Mianmian was taken aback. She blinked a few times and asked, “You agreed to it?”

Mo Yesi smiled. “Mm. If you like it this way, we’ll do it this way.”

“You said it yourself.” Qiao Mianmian smiled too. She then pulled her hand out of his and said cheekily, “From now on, you’re just pursuing me. Before I agree to be with you, you can’t just hold my hand as you wish.”

Mo Yesi, in his new role, was at a loss.

Qiao Mianmian looked at his confused expression and tried to suppress her laughter. “You’re the one who said you wanted to pursue me. I didn’t force it on you.”

Mo Yesi was speechless.

“Mr. Mo, you need patience to pursue a woman.” Qiao Mianmian spoke to him matter-of-factly. “It’s your probation period now, and it’s for me to see whether you’re a suitable boyfriend for me. So, you’d better treat me better and pass on your first attempt.”

There was no response.

“Aren’t we going to watch a movie?” Qiao Mianmian pointed at the long queue before them. “Let’s go get the tickets.”
