“Young Master Quan, you’re so mean.” Qiao Anxin playfully punched the man’s chest. “I didn’t mean that.”

Qiao Anxin looked delicate and pretty.

She looked so charming.

If it was a man with little experience in love, he would definitely be charmed by her appearance.

But Quan Dong was a veteran.

Looking at the woman in his arms pretending to be shy and innocent, the corners of his lips curled up in disdain. Then, he carried her horizontally without any emotion in his eyes.

...

Two hours later.

Quan Dong was leaning against the bed frame and smoking.

“Young Master Quan, there’s been a rather popular variety show recently. I heard that the variety show is selecting the next episode’s guest. I don’t have much work on hand, can you arrange for me to be in the next episode?”

Qiao Anxin knelt beside him and massaged his legs.

Quan Dong had a cigarette in his mouth. “Which variety show?”

“The Meaning of Traveling.” Qiao Anxin’s answer was immediate. With that, she massaged Quan Dong’s legs even harder. “There are five slots for each episode. I heard that three male and three female guests have already been chosen. Two slots are left.

“This show is very popular. The artistes who appear on it are all first- and second-tier. Moreover, some newbies became popular through this show. In short, being able to go on this variety show is very helpful to increase your fame.

“Young Master Quan, I want to go on this variety show.” Qiao Anxin looked up pitifully. “Can you arrange for me to go? I really want to go.”

Quan Dong was more powerful than Boss Huang.

He was the big brother of the entertainment industry.

Hence, even though everyone knew that Quan Dong was a pervert and that it was dangerous to follow him, many women who wanted to be popular still followed him.

Qiao Anxin was one of them.

She was willing to pay any price to be popular.

“You want to go?” Quan Dong took a puff, lowered his head, and blew a puff of smoke on her face.

Qiao Anxin started coughing.

Coughing until her eyes were red, she nodded vigorously. “Mm, I want to go.”

“It’s not impossible.” Quan Dong narrowed his eyes.

Qiao Anxin was elated. “Young Master Quan, is this a promise?”

Quan Dong smiled. “A few business partners have taken a liking to you. Help me receive them and sign the contract. I’ll let you go on the variety show, then.”

Qiao Anxin was stunned.

She widened her eyes in disbelief. “Young Master Quan, w-what did you say? You want me to accompany someone else?”

Quan Dong looked at her shocked expression and smiled. “The opportunity is right in front of you. It’s up to you whether you can grasp it or not. I won’t force you.

“I hate forcing others. If you’re unwilling to do this, I can always find someone else.”

Qiao Anxin paled.

She knew that Quan Dong wasn’t a good person.

Compared to Boss Huang, Quan Dong was more dangerous and cruel.

Boss Huang was just a little perverted in some ways. At least her life wouldn’t be in danger.
