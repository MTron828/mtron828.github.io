Chapter 2295: Is Someone Targeting the Mo Family?

When a man and a woman were together, they would make the most passionate promises.

But a change of heart was inevitable.

No matter how many times he swore, it was useless.

If it was so easy to make an oath, many unfaithful men would die from it.

“Mo Shixiu.”

“Mm?”

“Have you really decided to drop out of the election?” Jiang Luoli hesitated and looked up at him. “Aren’t you going to reconsider it? Actually, I don’t need you to accompany me often. I can take care of myself. Moreover, I plan to continue my studies when the baby is one year old.

“When I start getting busy, I won’t be home often.”

Jiang Luoli never thought that she would be a good wife and mother after giving birth.

She wasn’t such a woman.

She wanted to have a career too.

She was still young. She couldn’t possibly be trapped at home and spend her days with her husband and child.

Although she definitely loved them, she had to have her own goals and dreams.

To her, marriage and children were just a part of life.

If Mo Shixiu only wanted to spend more time with her and the child, she didn’t think it was necessary.

If becoming a good director, filming many good movies, and having many people praise her was her life’s dream, then what about Mo Shixiu’s life dream?

Was becoming the president his dream?

What would he do if she wasn’t willing to give up her dream?

She didn’t want him to give up because of her.

“I’ve said it before, it’s not entirely because of you and the child.” Mo Shixiu smiled and said, “I have my own considerations. Actually, it might not be a good thing to be in that position. The family hopes that I can be chosen because this way, the Mo family’s position will be more stable.

“But it’s not a good thing to be in the limelight.”

Jiang Luoli was stunned for a while and then quickly understood what he meant.

She got up from his arms and blinked. “Mo Shixiu, did something happen? What did you mean by that? Is someone targeting the Mo family?”

Mo Shixiu had no secrets from her.

He could share his work with his wife.

He thought for a few seconds and nodded. “Mm, someone is indeed targeting the Mo family.”

Jiang Luoli’s expression changed. “Is it related to your election?”

“Mm.”

“If you don’t drop out of the election, will the Mo family be in danger?”

Jiang Luoli didn’t know much about politics. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

But even if she hadn’t eaten pork, she’d seen pigs run.

In the past, she’d read a lot of palace novels. Sometimes, real life fights were more exciting and complicated than novels.

“Not really.” Mo Shixiu looked at her nervous expression and smiled. “Not just anyone can pose a serious threat to the Mo family. No one dares to attack us because they know the consequences. They can’t bear it.

“But…”

“But what?”

Mo Shixiu looked at her with his deep and dark eyes. “If I was still alone, I wouldn’t be afraid of anything. But now, I have you and our baby. I can’t be as fearless as before.”
