Chapter 585: It Was Actually Gong Zeli

Su Ze realized that the public was watching them. He wasn’t embarrassed by the attention, so he raised his voice and said, “Mianmian, I was wrong. I will never do anything that would hurt you in the future. I can swear in front of everyone.

“Everyone, please be my witness. Let the heavens strike me if I don’t treat my girlfriend well in the future.”

The pedestrians thought that they were fighting.

They thought that the guy was at fault.

But because of Su Ze’s good looks and good attitude, they took his side and helped him. “Miss, you can see that your boyfriend is really sincere in his apology. He really cares about you. Just forgive him.”

“That’s right. Every couple fights. It’s a part of a healthy relationship.”

“Young lady, you should forgive your boyfriend. I feel that he’s close to tears already.”

“I agree. Young lady, you...”

The other pedestrians joined in the commotion.

Seeing that the crowd was on his side, Su Ze smiled, and a sense of smugness flashed across his eyes.

As he saw that more people were getting drawn to him, he wanted to take the opportunity to get back together with Qiao Mianmian. He then kneeled down.

“Mianmian, forgive me,” Su Ze said as he reached for something in his pocket. He then fished out a little red box.

The crowd went wild as they witnessed this scene. He handed the box to Qiao Mianmian, looked up at her, and said, “Will you marry me? Let me take care of you for the rest of your life.”

Then, he opened the box.

It was a diamond ring. The glitter was blinding. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

The crowd lost their mind as they saw its size.

“Marry him, marry him.”

“Marry him!”

Su Ze bought it yesterday.

He bought it when he wanted to get back together with Qiao Mianmian.

The diamond must have cost millions judging by its size.

It was the most expensive gift that Su Ze had ever bought.

But to him, it was all worth it. If it meant getting back together with the woman he loved.

He didn’t plan to propose to her in such a condition.

He had already planned for a more romantic way to propose to her.

But it felt like the perfect situation now.

He just had to make his move.

As she heard the roaring crowd and saw the man kneeling in front of her, Qiao Mianmian fumed with anger.

Just as she was about to give Su Ze a tight slap, she heard a cold voice from afar. “I never knew that the person taking over the Su Mandate would be so despicable. He even dares to force a girl to marry him in front of a crowd.

“Isn’t it obvious that she isn’t willing to marry you? How could you do such laughable stuff?”

That voice...

Qiao Mianmian lifted her head in shock.

All of a sudden, the crowd split into two and created a path.

A slender figure then walked over.

Qiao Mianmian could finally recognize the person as he approached her. She was shocked.

Her jaw dropped as she exclaimed. “Gong...”

It was Gong Zeli.

Once Gong Zeli appeared, the excited crowd started to calm down.

Gong Zeli could spoil the wildest party.

His face practically screamed: “I’ll kill anyone who dares to mess with me.”
