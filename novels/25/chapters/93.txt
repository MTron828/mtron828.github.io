But if he was really some big shot, how could Qiao Mianmian be associated with him?

What tactic did she use to attach herself to him?

This was the first time Qiao Anxin was given the slip by a man. Furthermore, it was by a man she was attracted to, so she was even more reluctant to let it go.

If Qiao Mianmian could manage to wangle this man, then she also could do so without a doubt!

She had already snatched Su Ze from Qiao Mianmian, so this handsome and noble man would face a similar fate.

Although she had taken a blow from the man’s nonchalant indifference, her desire to conquer was also ignited.

A man with such good conditions was not easy to obtain, after all.

Not to mention how extraordinary and elite he looked.

It was absolutely normal for him to be arrogant.

Her desire to obtain him was parallel with his level of arrogance and indifference.

She didn’t believe she would ever fail to obtain a man.

“Sister Zhao.”

Qiao Anxin detested Qiao Mianmian and naturally didn’t want her to live a good life. She turned around and said to Linda, “Have you found my body double yet?”

“Not yet.” Linda was puzzled over the mention of this topic, but she still answered her question. “But didn’t your body double from last time do well? She didn’t cause an accident, so we can just use her for your next film.

“Anxin, why are you concerned about your body double out of the blue?”

She never inquired about such small matters before.

Qiao Anxin narrowed her eyes coldly. “My sister has been free recently, let her do this.”

“Your sister?” Linda thought of Qiao Mianmian’s face and frowned in disagreement. “She doesn’t look like you, I don’t think it’s suitable to use her as your body double. Furthermore, with your sister’s appearance, I’m afraid that once she reveals her face...”

As a manager, Linda was very clear that Qiao Mianmian was destined to join the entertainment industry.

Such beauty as hers was rare in the entertainment industry.

Her arrogance and aloofness played a part in her lack of popularity, along with her unwillingness to accept unwritten rules.

However, many investors were watering at their mouths to obtain her. If she decided to take the plunge, need she worry about a lack of investment propping her up?

Linda felt like Qiao Mianmian was a dangerous ticking time bomb.

This ticking time bomb couldn’t be placed beside them.

Qiao Anxin just sneered coldly. “Then don’t let her show her face. Sister Zhao, what are you afraid of? She doesn’t even have a company now, what’s there to be afraid of? It’s settled, then. Inform the production crew to notify my sister.”

“... Okay.” Linda was Qiao Anxin’s manager, but in reality, she went along with Qiao Anxin’s decision on many matters.

On another perspective, Qiao Anxin was her lady boss.

The management company Qiao Anxin previously signed with was under the Su Corporation. They supported her and gave all their best resources to her alone.

Linda also thought she was overthinking it.

With Qiao Anxin’s current resources, no other artist could match up to her.

Even if Qiao Mianmian really had the opportunity to develop in the entertainment world, how could she possibly defeat Anxin in popularity?

No matter how beautiful, it was impossible to become famous without the right resources.

Qiao Mianmian returned to her bedroom, only to be pulled aside by Jiang Luoli.

Jiang Luoli’s eyes were gleaming with the excitement of gossip. “Mianmian, did prince charming came to find you?”
