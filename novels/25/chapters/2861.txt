Chapter 2864: Why Do I Feel Like Jiang Xinyue Has a Huge Grudge Against You?

Zhan Bo was more agitated and angry than Qiao Mianmian.

It was as if he was the one who had been defamed.

On the contrary, Qiao Mianmian looked a little too calm after watching the video.

It was as if the video had nothing to do with her.

Zhan Bo turned around and saw Qiao Mianmian’s nonchalant expression. He couldn’t help but frown. “Qiao Mianmian, did you watch the video? Why don’t you seem angry at all?”

“Mm, I’ve finished watching the video.” Qiao Mianmian turned around and met his puzzled gaze. “I’m not okay, I’m quite angry.”

Zhan Bo: “…”

She was angry, but she didn’t react at all?

He was really curious to know how she looked when she was angry.

“You’re angry?”

“Mm, I’m angry.”

“But you don’t look angry at all.”

“You don’t have to show your anger.” Qiao Mianmian pursed her lips and closed the video. “Do you know that sometimes silence is scarier?”

Zhan Bo: “…”

“Alright, what do you plan to do? I saw the comments. Many people actually believed what she said. The current comments aren’t very good for you. Why do I feel like Jiang Xinyue has a huge grudge against you?

“Didn’t you say that you’ve never seen her before?

“It feels like she wants you to die. Just because she thinks you caused her contract to be terminated?”

Of course not.

But Qiao Mianmian couldn’t tell anyone the truth yet.

She thought for a while and said, “She thinks that I ruined her future, so it’s normal for her to hate me. Someone even tried to stab me to death previously. Compared to that, Jiang Xinyue’s actions are nothing.”

Qiao Mianmian was speaking the truth.

To her, Qiao Anxin’s actions were already considered good.

At least it wasn’t that extreme.

Previously, Song Fei and Huang Yilin wanted to stab her with a knife and pour sulfuric acid on her. These were much scarier than what Qiao Anxin was doing now.

Qiao Anxin was just trying to ruin her reputation.

Her life wasn’t in danger.

Zhan Bo was speechless.

Qiao Mianmian was probably the only person who could remain so calm in the face of her own scandals.

Other female celebrities would be furious.

But their backgrounds couldn’t compare to Qiao Mianmian’s.

Qiao Mianmian was so calm and composed, probably because this matter was a piece of cake for her.

All the posts would be deleted with a few casual words from her husband.

Qin Han had also finished watching the video. As a veteran in the industry, he thought for a while and suggested, “Mianmian, although Mr. Mo can delete all the negative news about you with just one sentence, I think it’s better to settle this as soon as possible. You’d better respond first, in case others say that you’re guilty and don’t even have an explanation.

“Most netizens don’t have their own judgment and are led by the nose. Even if what Jiang Xinyue said isn’t true, it’s not good for you if more people believe it.”

Qiao Mianmian nodded. “Mm, I know what to do. I’ll make a post on Weibo now..”Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com
