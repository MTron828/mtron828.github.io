Chapter 1074: It’s Fine Even If You Come From a Low-Level Family

When Bai Yusheng heard this, he couldn’t help but sneer. “A good temperament? Mom, are you sure?”

Mrs. Bai could tell that there was another meaning behind his words. She was stunned for a moment and asked, “Little Five, what do you mean? You don’t seem to agree with this? You came back not long after you went out with her. Did something happen during that time?”

After all, she had watched his son grow up.

Madam Bai felt that Bai Yusheng didn’t seem to like Shen Rou.

There was even some disgust in this dislike.

Everything was fine before.

But now...

After thinking for a while, she figured that something must have happened while they were out.

“It’s nothing.” Bai Yusheng saw what kind of woman Shen Rou was, but he didn’t intend to tell Madam Bai about this. He turned around and walked to Madam Bai’s side, gently patting her shoulder. “Mom, just don’t get involved in this matter.”

Mrs. Bai was silent for a while before nodding and saying, “Alright, I won’t interfere if you don’t want me to. But Little Five, you’re not young anymore. You’ll be in your thirties next year. Other people your age already know how to cook.

“But you don’t even have anyone by your side now. Tell me, what type of girl do you like? I’ll help you look for her. Seeing you grow day by day, I’m worried.”

Bai Yusheng said with a headache, “Mom, didn’t I say that when I have someone I like, I will bring her home to show you?”

Madam Bai snorted and said unhappily, “How many times have you said this? When has what you said ever counts? Have you ever brought a girl home all these years? As long as you bring one, I don’t need to be so anxious.”

“I haven’t found her yet.”

“That’s why I asked what type of girl you like. I’ve introduced so many girls to you, but none of them caught your eye. Do you want to find a Heaven Immortal beauty to be satisfied? Ah?” Speaking up to this point, Madam Bai suddenly thought of something.

She thought of a possibility and her expression changed slightly. She changed the topic. “Are you and that actress from your production team really...”

“That’s not true.” Before she could finish, Bai Yusheng interrupted her with a frown. “Mom, don’t listen to the rumors outside. It’s not like you don’t know that the entertainment industry loves to make groundless news.”

“Really?” Madam Bai obviously didn’t believe him. “The news was very detailed. I saw that girl. She’s quite pretty, even prettier than the Shen family’s child.

“If you really like her, it’s not something you need to hide. You know that our Bai family doesn’t care about family status. As long as she’s a good girl with a good character, it doesn’t matter even if she comes from a humble background. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“The most important thing is that you like her. Although we don’t really like her profession, your father and I are not difficult parents to get along with. We will treat the person you like well.”

Mrs. Bai felt that it would be good enough if her son could find a partner.

As for whether she was born in a good family, whether she had a good career, or whether she was good-looking, those were secondary.

In any case, the Bai family’s status was already stable enough. If they could find someone of equal social status, it would naturally be the icing on the cake.
