Chapter 465: It Was a Very Pretty Lady

“I hope that you will accept it.”

As the waiter spoke, he looked at her again. He thought that Qiao Mianmian was about to get really lucky.

She was capable of charming Young Master Yan with just her voice.

If he saw her, he would definitely want to claim her as his own.

Which guy could resist such a beautiful lady?

Everyone knew that Young Master Yan was a generous man. He was even more generous to girls that he was attracted to.

A small gift from him could cost as much as what someone could earn in a lifetime.

Qiao Mianmian was puzzled and asked, “Someone requested for this to be delivered to me?”

“Yes.” The waiter thought for a moment before continuing, “The person is our VIP here. I’m not at liberty to disclose his identity. He’s in the room opposite now, and he hopes to speak with you for a short while.

“If you want, I could bring you there right now.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

Was she being picked up right now?

“VIP, which VIP?” Jiang Luoli asked as she looked at the bouquet. Suddenly, she had an idea and exclaimed, “Baby, could it be Prince Charming? Is he trying to make it up to you?”

Qiao Mianmian was stunned.

Mo Yesi?

It couldn’t be. How could he know where she was? ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

She didn’t inform him at all.

She looked at the waiter puzzledly and asked, “May I know his name?”

The waiter smiled and answered, “He’s the Young Master of the Yan family, Yan Shaoqing. I believe you have heard of him before.”

The waiter thought that Qiao Mianmian would be shocked and elated after hearing the name.

Yan Shaoqing was the symbol of riches and power, after all.

No one could resist him.

But he was about to be disappointed.

Qiao Mianmian was surprised after hearing the name. But her face afterward wasn’t one of elation.

It was... a really weird smile.

“Yan Shaoqing! Are you sure?”

“... Yes.”

“Alright, I will accept the flowers. Could you help me to pass him a message, please?”

...

A few minutes later.

The waiter exited the room with a strange expression.

He walked to room 888 and knocked on the door lightly.

Someone responded immediately, “Come in.”

As the waiter entered the room, he saw Yan Shaoqing drinking a bottle of red wine.

He approached him slowly and greeted respectfully. “Young Master Yan.”

As he entered, the people in the room looked towards him.

Gong Zeli was holding a glass of wine too and joked. “So, how was it? Was it a pretty girl or an ugly one?”

The waiter looked at Gong Zeli before replying respectfully, “Young Master Gong, it was a very pretty lady.”

To be accurate. It was a very, very pretty lady.

He had never seen a prettier lady in his many years of working in the clubhouse.

She was prettier than most celebrities.

Gong Zeli froze, frowned, and asked, “Are you sure she was pretty?”

“She was really pretty.” The waiter recalled. “She was like a goddess.”

“Hahaha.” Yan Shaoqing laughed and clapped. He then said joyfully, “I knew it. My instincts have never failed me. You lost the bet, Fourth Bro. Don’t forget what you promised.”
