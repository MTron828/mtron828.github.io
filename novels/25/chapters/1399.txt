Chapter 1401: We Can’t Let the Mo Family Have Another Joke

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“The neighbor really liked her. Her parents wanted her to be with that man, but she rejected them.”

Madam Mo’s eyes lit up as she smiled. “Continue.”

“Yes, Madam.” The man paused for a while before continuing, “This young lady and Young Master have just gotten together, so their relationship must be unstable. If she creates a misunderstanding at this time, I’m afraid Young Master won’t like her so much.

“Think about it, Madam. What do men mind the most?”

Madam Mo was stunned again. Then, her eyes widened.

“You mean...”

“That’s right. If Madam doesn’t worry about me, you can leave this to me. I promise to settle this and solve Madam’s troubles.”

Madam Mo’s heart raced as she hesitated.

“Madam wants to cut off this ill-fated relationship with Young Master as soon as possible. She can’t hesitate anymore. If she gets pregnant with Young Master’s child, things will be difficult. If Old Madam finds out about the pregnancy, she’ll definitely let her in for the child.

“Our Young Master is someone who wants to do big things, and his future status will be even more distinguished. How is she worthy of Young Master? Madam is doing this for Young Master’s good. I believe Young Master will understand Madam’s painstaking efforts.

“Young Master has always been filial. He won’t get into a fight with Madam over a small woman. Madam, you don’t have to worry too much.”

Madam Mo was a little hesitant.

Mo Yesi was already on bad terms with her.

Before this, she didn’t believe that her filial second son would make such a fuss over a woman.

But now...

What was she going to do if her eldest son broke up with her?

But she had no choice.

The Mo family already had a joke.

She couldn’t let the Mo family take in another joke.

Even if her two sons blamed her in the future, she could just do it with a clear conscience. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Everything she did was for their own good.

Even if they couldn’t understand it now, they would understand her good intentions one day.

At this thought, Madam Mo no longer hesitated.

“Alright, go and do it immediately. You have to be careful and not let anyone find out. Especially the Young Master. He’s at the most crucial moment now, don’t let him get distracted.”

A moment later, the man left the piano room.

Madam Mo turned to look out the window and sighed softly. “Shixiu, don’t blame Mom. Ah Si has already done wrong. I can’t let you make the same mistake.”

...

A little while later, Mo Yesi drove to Mo Shixiu’s house to pick Qiao Mianmian up.

Mo Shixiu arrived a few minutes later.

Qiao Mianmian and Jiang Luoli were playing a game together. Sister Lin knocked on the door and entered the bedroom. She said to them, “Miss Jiang, Second Madam. Young Master and Second Young Master are back.”

Two tall figures walked in at the same time.

Sister Lin greeted them respectfully. “Young Master, Second Young Master.”

Jiang Luoli and Qiao Mianmian looked up at the same time.

The handsome and elegant brothers slowly approached them.

Qiao Mianmian and Mo Yesi were like an old couple. They smiled at each other, and Mo Yesi reached out. Qiao Mianmian placed her hand on his.
