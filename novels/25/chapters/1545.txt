Chapter 1546: Helping the Shen Family

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Anyway, whether it’s Chinese or Western, I want to give Mianmian a grand wedding.”

“That’s what I should do. Your and Shixiu’s weddings will be so grand. Oh right, I heard that the girlfriend Shixiu brought back is good friends with Mianmian? Mianmian, is this true?”

“Mm, yes. Luo Luo and I share a room. We’ve always been close.”

“Then, we’re really fated. One of you two sisters is married to Ah Si, and the other is with Shixiu. If your friend marries Shixiu, your best friend will become your sister-in-law. You’ll become a true family, and your relationship will be even closer in the future.”

If Madam Mo said this, Qiao Mianmian wouldn’t think that it was a good thing.

But Old Madam’s words were true.

“Yes, I hope that Luo Luo can marry Big Brother in the end. That way, she’ll be my sister-in-law.”

“This year has been the most relaxing. In the past, Ah Si and your brother’s marriage always worried me so much that I couldn’t sleep well. I was always worried that they’d be alone for the rest of their lives.

“Thankfully, God has been good to our Mo family and has resolved their personal problems this year. When Shixiu gets married, I won’t have anything to worry about anymore.”

...

The Old Madam was old and weak.

After dinner, she chatted with Qiao Mianmian and the others for a while before saying that she was tired and wanted to rest.

After Uncle Zhang helped Old Madam to her room, Qiao Chen thought of something, got up, and said to Mo Yesi, “Brother-in-law, I have something to talk to you about. Can I talk to you alone?”

Mo Yesi glanced at Qiao Mianmian.

Qiao Mianmian got up and said, “I’m going to the garden for a walk. You can talk to Chen Chen.”

With that, she turned and walked out of the hall.

“Chen Chen, follow me.”

Mo Yesi went upstairs to the study room.

Qiao Chen quickly followed.

He closed the door gently after entering the study.

Mo Yesi sat on the sofa and pointed at the seat opposite him. “Sit down first.”

Qiao Chen walked over slowly.

After he sat down, Mo Yesi turned around and asked, “What do you want to talk to me about?”

“Brother-in-law, did the Shen family ask you for help?” Qiao Chen didn’t want to beat around the bush with Mo Yesi. He had promised Shen Xin that he would help her plead for mercy. Whether Mo Yesi was willing to help or not, he just had to fulfill his promise.

Mo Yesi frowned.

He could guess what happened when Shen Xin looked for Qiao Chen.

“You wanted to talk about the Shen family? Did Shen Xin ask you to plead for her family?”

Qiao Chen looked up in shock.

“Shen Xin looked for you this afternoon. Did she look for you because of the Shen family?”

Qiao Chen kept quiet for a while before nodding. “Mm.”

“So, you want me to help the Shen family?” Mo Yesi raised an eyebrow.

“Brother-in-law, are you unwilling to help the Shen family because of what Shen Rou did to Sister?” Qiao Chen asked.

“I guess.”

“I know you’re standing up for Sister, but... the rest of the Shen family should be innocent. I heard that the Shen and Mo families have a good relationship. Brother-in-law, are you really not going to help the Shen family?”Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m
