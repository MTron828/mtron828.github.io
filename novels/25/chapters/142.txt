Chapter 144: It’s a Shock and a Surprise

Mo Yesi took a deep breath and said in his deep voice, “I just want to hug you to sleep, I won’t do anything else. But if you continue moving about against me, I won’t be able to control myself.” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Qiao Mianmian was immediately shocked into keeping still.

The man’s breathing against the back of her head was a little hurried at first. But a minute later, it slowed and steadied.

He planted a kiss on her head.

Mo Yesi then closed his eyes in satisfaction and said, “Baby, go to sleep.”

Her fragrant scent put him at ease.

Every time he was about to go to sleep, he would feel especially anxious and frustrated.

It was as if the nerves in his brain were taut and tense.

Each night he would feel like he was having a fight with himself.

Whether he won or lost, he would eventually be dragged into that world of darkness.

A world without any light at all, a boundless void.

Each time he woke up from that world and was back to reality, he would feel especially tired.

Physically and emotionally tired.

He had gone to doctors before, both locally and internationally. Even renowned psychologists had spoken to him, but they were all unable to help him out of this terrible dreamscape that had been haunting him for over 20 years.

Eventually, he gave up.

He was ready to resign to this for the rest of his life.

That was when Qiao Mianmian appeared.

She was a shock and a surprise to him, a floating plank in the vast sea.

She was his savior...

If he hadn’t met her, the rest of his life wouldn’t have seemed worth living.

But since she had appeared in his life and he met her, he was not going to let her go no matter what.

...

The following day.

Qiao Mianmian woke up and saw that the other half of the bed was empty.

She rubbed her eyes, sat up, and then reached for her cell phone.

Mo Yesi: [Baby, I’m off to the office. Didn’t want to wake you up as you were sleeping soundly.]

Mo Yesi: [I’ll fetch you tonight, wait for me.]

Mo Yesi: [I got Wei Zheng to buy you both some breakfast. Have it before going to class.]

Qiao Mianmian couldn’t help but smile as she read the messages. She felt warm and fuzzy in her heart.

He really had her in mind all the time. He had even prepared breakfast for her.

She happily replied: [Mm, I got it. Remember to have your breakfast too!]

Mo Yesi did not respond instantly.

Qiao Mianmian put her phone aside and went to wash up after sending the message.

When she was done, she checked her cell phone again, but Mo Yesi hadn’t replied.

She didn’t bother too much.

It was early in the morning and he was probably too busy in the office.

He had either not seen her message yet or hadn’t had the time to respond.

...

Qiao Mianmian heard the knock on the front door.

She opened it and saw Wei Zheng standing right there in a suit.

With a few bags in his hand, he greeted her politely. “Young Madam.”

He handed the bags to Qiao Mianmian. “Young Madam, this is the breakfast that Young Master has specially instructed me to get for you.”
