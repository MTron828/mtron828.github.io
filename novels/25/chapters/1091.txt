Chapter 1092: Is It Wrong to Like Someone?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

She had thought about giving up.

He was also determined to give up.

A person who didn’t like her, why did she have to keep pestering him?

In his eyes, the infatuation she thought she had was nothing more than an annoying pestering.

She didn’t want to lose her last bit of self-esteem just because she liked someone.

However, it was really difficult to give up on someone that she had liked for so many years.

Every time she saw him, her heart would still flutter, and she couldn’t help but pay attention to him.

She also felt that she was very disappointing.

She, Shen Xin, was not so bad that no one liked her or wanted her. Why did she continue to use her hot face to stick to other people’s cold buttocks?

Why did she have to like someone who would never like her no matter how hard she tried?

But she knew everything.

Once they met, her mood would be affected uncontrollably.

His coldness and distance were like a sharp weapon that pierced through her heart, making her want to cry.

Her eyes were already wet, but she would never cry in front of him.

She was Shen Xin, the second daughter of the Shen family.

She would never show her inferior side in front of a man. It was enough to do such a lowly thing once.

“Mm.” Qiao Chen nodded and didn’t say anything else.

Shen Xin felt that at this point, she should leave.

He clearly didn’t want to talk to her anymore.

Her pride was telling her she should leave right away.

There was no need for her to stay and make others find her annoying.

Her rationality was clear, but her body didn’t listen to her.

She looked at Qiao Chen with a pale face and was silent for a while. Perhaps it was because her heart hurt so much that even when her nails dug into her palms, she didn’t feel any pain.

She looked at him for a while and pursed her lips. “Qiao Chen, do you... hate me? Don’t you find me annoying?”

Qiao Chen paused and frowned slightly. “No, why would you think that?”

He never hated her.

Shen Xin’s lips were also a little pale. “No? But I feel that... you hate me.”

Every time he saw her, he would pretend to ignore her.

Either his attitude was very cold. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

He was clearly not like this to others.

He had a good personality and was friendly to all his classmates.

Only towards her...

His attitude was so cold that they didn’t seem like classmates who had been deskmates for years but more like strangers.

Perhaps he wouldn’t be so cold to strangers.

She didn’t know what she did wrong for him to treat her like this.

Was it because she liked him?

Was it wrong to like someone?

Did her liking disgust him so much?

Shen Xin was also the apple of Father and Mother Shen’s eyes at home. Because of her status as the second daughter of the Shen family, she was brought up by others.

She didn’t lack boys trying to please her.

She didn’t even know why she was so cheap. She treated him so well that she didn’t like anyone, but she liked someone who didn’t take her seriously.

“No.” Even if Qiao Chen didn’t want to give Shen Xin any hope, he didn’t want her to think that he hated her. “Shen Xin, I don’t hate you. I didn’t in the past, and I don’t now. Don’t think too much.”

“Then, why are you so cold to me?”

Thinking about how cold he had been recently, Shen Xin felt wronged and upset. She held back her tears and said, “Qiao Chen, I know you don’t like me.”
