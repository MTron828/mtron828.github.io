L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Not only did he not put on airs in front of her, but he was also nice to her. If she rejected him, wouldn’t she seem like a fool?

She reached out to take it.

“Thank you, Mr. Tu.” She smiled sweetly at him.

Tu Yilei clenched his fists by his side and looked at the sweet smile on her lips. He couldn’t help but pause for a few seconds and suddenly felt his heart race.

This was... a feeling he’d never felt before.

It turned out that there was a type of girl who looked so good when she smiled.

She smiled, and it was as if the whole world had become beautiful.

His heart warmed as if it had been kissed by the sun.

For the first time in his life, he felt that girls were really adorable creatures.

How could she be so cute?

Qiao Mianmian was so adorable.

“You’re reading the script?” Tu Yilei glanced at the script in her hand, not intending to leave.

Qiao Mianmian nodded and felt a little better.

“How do you feel? Can you play your role well?”

Tu Yilei was leaning against the tree casually, asking about his work. But his eyes were on Qiao Mianmian’s hair.

A gust of wind blew.

A faint fragrance entered his nose.

He took a deep breath and could smell the sweet scent of flowers.

It smelled good.

The girl sitting under the shade had a sweet smile, and even her scent was sweet.

So sweet... he wanted to take a bite.

Tu Yilei knew that it wasn’t good for him to stay anymore.

Someone would notice them.

Previously, because of Bai Yusheng’s actions, Qiao Mianmian had already become the most eye-catching person on set.

If he continued to stay here, she would only attract more attention.

More and more people were criticizing her.

It wasn’t good for her or himself.

But he just didn’t want to leave.

He wanted to spend more time with her.

This was the first time he liked a girl.

He was excited, worried, and nervous.

He didn’t know what to do.

He didn’t dare to express his feelings too obviously in front of her, but he didn’t want her to think that he was just showing concern for her.

As he hesitated, many people saw him and Qiao Mianmian talking.

The female artistes already unhappy with Qiao Mianmian were about to explode.

“Does Tu Yilei know Qiao Mianmian? Why is he with her?”

“I saw Tu Yilei pass the water to her just now. He even gave her a small fan. That’s Tu Yilei’s fan, right? Gosh, does he like her too?”

“What? Bai Yusheng and Tu Yilei are my two male idols. She seduced one of my male idols in the morning and now another one? She’s so shameless. Does she have to seduce all the outstanding men in the crew?”

“No way, how could Tu Yilei like her? She’s not even a C-lister. Even if Tu Yilei wants to find a girlfriend in the same industry, she should at least be a B-lister.”

“Tu Yilei’s career is already good enough, maybe he doesn’t have high expectations for his other half? To be honest, Qiao Mianmian’s face is really pretty. Don’t you think that her looks are very popular among men? She looks so delicate and weak, it’s easy to arouse a man’s desire to protect her.”
