Chapter 1604: This Is My Business, It Has Nothing to Do With You

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Shangguan Qing’s face went pale.

“Brother Zeli, do you really have someone you like?” She clenched her fists in disbelief.

Gong Zeli didn’t even look up. “I’ve already made myself clear. You can leave now.”

“Who’s it? Who’s she?”

Shangguan Qing refused to believe it.

She didn’t believe that there was anyone more suitable than her.

“Is it Shen Rou?” Shangguan Qing suddenly thought of someone, and her expression darkened.

How could she have forgotten about Shen Rou?

Shangguan Qing had always thought that no woman was better than her.

But she was convinced by Shen Rou.

But that was before the Shen family fell.

Shen Rou’s and the Shen family’s situation wasn’t good anymore.

Was he still in love with her? Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Seeing his cold expression, Shangguan Qing felt a blow to her heart. She couldn’t help but ask, “Brother Zeli, is the woman you like Shen Rou? But the Shen family is no longer worthy of the Gong family. You can’t be together. Uncle will also not agree to you being with her.

“I heard from my dad that the Shen family might go bankrupt this time. Even the Mo family didn’t interfere with the Shen family’s matters. Brother Zeli, are you thinking of taking over the Shen family’s mess?”

“This is my business, it has nothing to do with you.”

Gong Zeli frowned. Having obviously run out of patience, he said to his assistant, “What are you still standing there for? Escort her out.”

“Yes, Chairman Gong.”

Seeing Gong Zeli’s expression change, the assistant dared not delay any further. He immediately turned to Shangguan Qing and said, “Miss, please follow me out. Don’t disturb Chairman Gong’s work.”

Shangguan Qing pursed her lips and looked awful.

She wanted to flare up.

But she recalled what Madam Gong had said. Gong Zeli liked gentle and virtuous women. He liked obedient and clever girls, and he disliked aggressive and violent girls.

Although Shangguan Qing was full of anger, she held it in to not leave a bad impression on him.

“Then, Brother Zeli, I-I’ll take my leave first. Don’t work too hard. I made soup for you, drink some when you’re free. That soup is very nourishing, it’s me...”

“Take it away.” The man didn’t even look up.

“What?”

“Take what you brought with you. I don’t need it.”

The assistant saw a pink lunch box on the desk and immediately picked it up. “Miss, is this yours?”

Shangguan Qing bit her lip and her eyes turned red.

She was the only daughter of the Shangguan family and had been pampered since she was little.

Besides Gong Zeli, she had never felt aggrieved before. She felt so aggrieved and upset now.

The men around her all flattered her.

Only Gong Zeli didn’t take her seriously.

But she liked him. No matter how cold he was to her, she still liked him.

She still wanted to marry him and become his wife.

Shangguan Qing stood there and looked at Gong Zeli with reddened eyes for a while. She then reached out and took the pink lunch box from the assistant, turned around, and ran away.

Gong Zeli never looked up at her.

Shangguan Qing left the Gong Corporation building and cried in the car for a while.
