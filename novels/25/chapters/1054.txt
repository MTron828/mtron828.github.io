Chapter 1056: It’ll Make Her Lose Her Ability to Think Normally

A little girl who made him want to take good care of her and dote on her.

At work, he usually interacted with mature women around his age, and they mostly talked about work matters.

He really didn’t know how to interact with a girl like Jiang Luoli.

And because she was so much younger than him, he felt that it was alright to accommodate her more.

She was just a young girl.

She was just born when he was 10.

He was willing to accommodate and be patient with such a young girl.

This was his duty.

Jiang Luoli blushed and looked up at him. “N-No. It has nothing to do with you, Mr. Mo. You didn’t say anything wrong.”

He hadn’t said anything wrong.

He was just saying some very alluring things.

It made her heart race, and she didn’t dare to look at him.

Her heart raced even faster when she saw him.

Her face burned even more.

She felt a little giddy as if she was drunk.

“Then, Miss Jiang, you...” Mo Shixiu looked at Jiang Luoli’s reaction and behavior in confusion.

She didn’t seem normal.

She didn’t even look at him.

Was she really not angry with him?

“Cough, cough, cough. Mr. Mo, let’s eat something first.” Jiang Luoli touched her burning face. She picked up the knife and fork on the table and swallowed a piece of steak and then lowered her head to hide her panic.

She couldn’t look at Mo Shixiu anymore.

She wasn’t immune to his face at all.

As her gaze landed on his handsome face, her mind went blank. She couldn’t think, and then she felt dizzy and didn’t know what she was doing.

This man would make her lose her rationality.

No wonder there was such a saying.

It was the same for men.

It turned out that in front of such a beautiful face, people would really become stupid and lose their rationality.

“Alright, let’s eat something first.” Mo Shixiu got a waiter to open the red wine on the table and poured a glass for Jiang Luoli. He placed it gently on the table and said, “Miss Jiang, try this red wine. It’s a perfect match for the steak. It will bring a pleasant surprise when combined.”

Jiang Luoli swallowed the steak and took a sip of red wine.

Mo Shixiu smiled and asked, “How is it?” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“Mm, it’s not bad.” Jiang Luoli wanted to try the wine, but she couldn’t stop after taking a sip.

The red wine was rich and fragrant.

She didn’t know much about wines, but she could tell that it was definitely of high quality.

The steak was fresh and tender, and it melted in the mouth. Coupled with a mouthful of red wine, it was a unique delicacy.

Jiang Luoli enjoyed her steak and wine.

She drank quickly.

Mo Shixiu was shocked.

“Can I have another glass of wine?”

Soon, Jiang Luoli finished the red wine in her glass. She held the empty glass in front of Mo Shixiu and shook it.

Mo Shixiu hesitated for a while before pouring her another glass.
