Chapter 2702: I Don’t Want to Take Any More Work

Besides Qiao Mianmian, Mo Yesi had never taken the initiative to give other women his contact details.

He gave it to Linda only because he was still worried.

Linda couldn’t contact Wei Zheng as quickly as she could. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Linda was stunned for a few more seconds. Seeing Mo Yesi frown impatiently, she snapped back to her senses. She immediately unlocked her cell phone and saved Mo Yesi’s cell phone number in her contact list.

…

Qiao Mianmian felt a little lost after they boarded the plane.

She looked out of the window.

“You can’t bear to part with Chairman Mo?” Linda smiled and said, “This time, you are really going overseas. You’ll probably only meet once in a long time. It’s normal that you can’t bear to part with him.

“But there’s a first time for everything. You’ll have to get used to this life when you go overseas for filming in the future. In this industry, you’ll be apart from each other many times. Actually, I’m surprised that Chairman Mo supports you in your acting career.”

When other female celebrities married into rich families, they basically left the industry.

Unless something happened to their marriage and they didn’t have a good future, they might choose to come back and earn money.

After all, the rich cared a lot about their image. They felt that it wasn’t good for female celebrities to continue showing their faces after marriage.

Moreover, the concepts of rich families were mostly traditional.

After marrying someone, they would ask you to stay at home to provide for your husband and children.

Especially the Mo family.

The older generation in the family probably didn’t want Qiao Mianmian to continue staying in the entertainment industry.

As for Mo Yesi…

Although she hadn’t seen him so many times, Linda felt that Mo Yesi was very possessive of Qiao Mianmian.

He definitely didn’t like his wife acting with other men.

But Qiao Mianmian was still in the entertainment industry, which meant that Mo Yesi really liked her.

“Sister Xie, he actually doesn’t like my job,” Qiao Mianmian said honestly. “But I insisted, so he had to agree.”

“That means Chairman Mo cares a lot about you.” Linda looked at her enviously. “Mianmian, Chairman Mo treats you really well. A few artistes under me have married into rich families. They and their husbands look like a loving couple on the surface, but do you know, they often complain to me in private that their husbands have several mistresses outside and even have illegitimate children? Even if they know, they can only feign ignorance.

“Few female celebrities are truly happy to marry into a rich family, but many feel wronged. This is the first time I’ve seen someone as loving as you and Chairman Mo.”

“Mm, he’s really good to me.” Qiao Mianmian smiled blissfully. “That’s why he compromised for me. I want to compromise for him, too. Sister Xie, I’ve never told you that I’m preparing for pregnancy now. After this movie, I should have a long vacation.

“Mo Yesi really wants a baby, so I don’t intend to take on any more jobs.”

Linda was shocked.

“You’re preparing for pregnancy?” Qiao Mianmian hadn’t told her about this before.

“Mm. I’m sorry to only tell you now.” Qiao Mianmian looked apologetic. “But I only agreed to it recently. If you have any good resources on hand, you can assign them to newbies with potential. I know you just brought one..”
