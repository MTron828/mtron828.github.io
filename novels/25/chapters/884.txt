“Huang Yilin’s target was me, not him. He should be fine.”

“So, you think you’ve hurt him?”

“I already hurt him.”

“But, would you rather hurt yourself than him?”

“Yes...”

In that case, she wouldn’t have to blame herself so much.

She wouldn’t feel so tormented now.

“Mianmian, he did it willingly. You didn’t force him to do it.” Bai Yusheng analyzed it for her objectively. “Moreover, it happened so suddenly. You didn’t expect him to do it, right?”

“... Mm.”

“So, how can you blame yourself? Although this happened because of you, he made the choice himself. I know that no matter what, you’ll definitely feel guilty. But you have to know that you didn’t do anything wrong.

“If anyone has to be blamed, it’s Huang Yilin. She was the one who splashed the acid. She was the one who hurt him. Alright, actually, I’ve seen the burn on the back of Tu Yilei’s hand. It’s not as serious as you think. He should be considered lucky in his misfortune. If I’m right, the concentration of the acid isn’t very high.”

If it was very concentrated sulfuric acid, definitely not a single piece of meat on the back of Tu Yilei’s hand would be left.

His injuries would have definitely been much worse.

Qiao Mianmian was stunned. “That bottle of sulfuric acid isn’t high in concentration?”

Bai Yusheng nodded. “It must have been diluted. The wound on the back of his hand looks scary, but it should be able to recover.”

“Really? Can he really recover?” Qiao Mianmian’s dull eyes finally lit up a little. “Brother Bai, you’re not lying to me, right? Can Tu Yilei really recover his hand? Won’t it affect his career development?”

Bai Yusheng didn’t dare to say it too bluntly. He thought for a while before saying, “The possibility of recovery is very high. In any case, it’s not as serious as you think. So, you don’t have to blame yourself too much. But I’m rather grateful that he shielded you.”

“Mm?” Qiao Mianmian was stunned.

“If he didn’t shield you, you’d be the one injured.” Bai Yusheng hesitated for a while before looking at her. He sighed and said, “Mianmian, if you were the one injured, I think my heart would ache.”

Qiao Mianmian widened her eyes. “Brother Bai.”

“I’ve been thinking about something for the past few days.” Bai Yusheng looked into her dark eyes with a hint of complex emotions. After a moment of silence, he slowly said, “How good would it be if my sister was you. Do you know, my parents recently found some clues. Perhaps, I’ll be able to find my long-lost sister soon.”

“You found some clues?” Qiao Mianmian was shocked. “What did you find? Do you know where your sister is?”

“Not really, but I do know a little.” Bai Yusheng didn’t intend to hide it from Qiao Mianmian at all. He told her everything he’d found out. “According to the current information, she’s very likely in Yuncheng City.

“I really didn’t expect her to live under our watch after so many years of investigation.

“I always thought that she must have moved somewhere else, so I placed my focus elsewhere.”
