Chapter 889: Letting Qiao Mianmian Leave

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Of course I came.” Qiao Mianmian walked towards him gratefully. After a moment of silence, she said softly, “How are you feeling now? Does your wound still hurt?”

Tu Yilei treated the burn on the back of his hand as soon as he arrived at the hospital.

But it still looked a little scary.

Tu Yilei saw the concern and self-reproach in her eyes, and his heart warmed. He felt that the pain on the back of his hand wasn’t so unbearable anymore.

He looked at her even more gently and said, “The doctor applied the ointment just now. It’s much better now.”

Michael’s lips quivered.

What did he mean by “it doesn’t hurt so much”? He was clearly in so much pain that his face was pale and covered in a cold sweat.

He was already in so much pain, but he was acting as if nothing had happened in front of the woman he liked.

He was in such a terrible state, and he was still trying to console her.

He didn’t know what to say.

“Alright, Miss Qiao, you don’t have to worry about me. The doctor just said that the burn on the back of my hand can be healed. Don’t worry, I’ll be fine.” To show that he was really fine, Tu Yilei smiled brightly at her. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

It was as if nothing had happened.

“Mr. Tu, we have to disinfect you now. We need you to be in the hospital for a few days. The ward has been arranged. Do you want to go over now?” The doctor reminded him.

“Transfer him to another ward and get Xiao Tu disinfected immediately. If the wound gets inflamed, it’ll be troublesome.” Before anyone else said anything, Michael helped Tu Yilei up and said that he wanted to give him an infusion immediately.

Actually, Michael was very unhappy with Qiao Mianmian.

If it wasn’t for Bai Yusheng, he would have told Qiao Mianmian to leave.

Hmph, it was because of this girl that his Little Tu became like this.

Although the doctor said that it could be treated, he was still unhappy with this little girl.

Initially, his Little Tu didn’t need to suffer this.

How painful it must be for his skin to be corroded by the acid.

Moreover, with the injury on the back of his hand, he definitely couldn’t act for the time being.

He still had other jobs and commercials to do, so he had to drag it out.

In any case, because of his injury, a lot of work had to be delayed.

That was because Michael didn’t have a good attitude towards Qiao Mianmian. As he helped Tu Yilei walk past her, he said directly, “Miss Qiao, as you can see, our Little Tu was lucky this time. The burn on the back of his hand can still be treated. If you’re here to know how his injuries are, you know it now, so there’s no need to continue staying here to look after him. We don’t want to waste your time. Miss Qiao, you should go and do your things. You don’t have to stay here anymore.”

His words were tactful enough.

He only said that because of Bai Yusheng.

There were rumors in the crew that this girl was Bai Yusheng’s cousin.

Although he didn’t know if it was true, Michael didn’t want to offend anyone since such rumors were spreading.

Anyway, his Little Tu’s injury could be treated, and that was already considered a blessing in disguise.

Everyone could tell that Michael was asking Qiao Mianmian to leave.
