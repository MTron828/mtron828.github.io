Chapter 1519: Caught Off-Guard

And once it flared up, it would be very dangerous.

This meant that being with Gong Zeli was dangerous.

But even so, that couldn’t stop many women from approaching him.

His looks and family background would make many women forget about the danger he posed.

These women had only seen Gong Zeli in television and magazines before. When they saw him in person, they couldn’t help but become smitten.

But Gong Zeli never looked at them.

The seats beside Gong Zeli were empty, but no one dared to sit beside him.

After the housemaid arranged for the others to take their seats, Gong Zeli didn’t eat first, and the others sat obediently.

Gong Zeli glanced at Qiao Mianmian and said, “Everyone, you’ve worked hard. Since you’re here in my manor, you’re my guests. I got the kitchen to prepare some home-cooked dishes for everyone. Don’t be restrained and eat as you wish.”

The others glanced at the sumptuous food on the table. They couldn’t understand the meaning of “home-cooked food.”

This was a home-cooked meal?

It was probably just a home-cooked meal for the Gong family.

At this moment, he realized the gap. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

With Gong Zeli around, it was impossible to not feel restrained.

The man’s aura was strong. When he was still at the dining table, how could others let go and eat as they wished?

The meal was quiet.

Besides Gong Zeli, Qiao Mianmian was the only one who could eat freely.

From start to finish, she didn’t say a word and ate seriously.

...

The lunch break lasted for two hours.

The housemaid came to remove the leftovers from the table.

Gong Zeli left first. As soon as he did, a few female employees gathered around Qiao Mianmian.

“Mianmian, you should be on good terms with Young Master Gong. Do you know if he has a girlfriend?”

“I heard he has mania. It’s scary when it acts up. No one knows when it will act up. Is this true? Have you seen him act up?”

“Do you know what kind of girl Young Master Gong likes? Can you introduce me to him? I want to be friends with him.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

She didn’t expect Gong Zeli to be so popular.

The female crew members seemed to be charmed by him.

She didn’t know Gong Zeli well, so how could she know about him?

Moreover, she felt that Gong Zeli was good-looking, but his personality... not many women could tolerate it.

She couldn’t help but ask, “What do you like about him?”

“Of course, because he’s handsome and rich.”

“That’s right. He’s rich and good-looking. That face is enough for him to debut.”

“Mianmian, do you think Young Master Gong isn’t handsome?”

“Mianmian’s boyfriend is a super hunk. It’s normal that she can’t feel other men’s handsomeness when she looks at his face every day.”

“That’s right, Mianmian. How do you feel looking at your boyfriend’s face every day? Will you be immune after looking at him for a long time?”

Immune?

Qiao Mianmian thought about it and shook her head.

She didn’t know if she would be immune to Mo Yesi in the future.

In any case, she still felt tempted every time she saw him.

“I’m not immune to it.” She kept quiet for a while before saying, “I still feel very tempted and think that he’s very handsome.”

Everyone was speechless.
