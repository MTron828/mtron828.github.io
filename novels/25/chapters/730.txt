Chapter 731: Ah Si’s Future Wife Will Only Be You

But who knew that such a man could be so passionate and wild when he really liked a woman.

It turned out that even the coldest iceberg hid a ball of fire.

This fire would only be ignited when they met someone they wanted to burn.

She was so envious...

If the woman Mo Yesi loved was her, she would be so happy.

She would be the happiest woman in the world.

But even though he loved her so much, he couldn’t bear to give her even a little bit.

He gave all his love to Qiao Mianmian.

She was really... indignant.

Madam Mo, who was crying beside her, made her extremely frustrated. She really wanted to get up and leave, but she remembered that she still needed Madam Mo’s help for many things. If she married into the Mo family, Madam Mo would be her mother-in-law. No matter what, she had to coax her well.

Hence, no matter how annoyed she was, she still tried her best to coax her. “Aunt Mo, you said that Brother Ah Si wasn’t like this in the past. I think he was really confused for a while. You can’t blame him for this.”

Shen Rou took out her handkerchief and wiped Madam Mo’s tears. She sighed and said, “Otherwise, how could there be such a saying that ‘a hero cannot overcome a beauty’? I think Brother Ah Si still values you, but...”

“It’s all that vixen’s fault.” Madam Mo was extremely unhappy with Qiao Mianmian now. “Of course I know what my own son is like. Ah Si only became like this after he got together with her. Damn it, that vixen bewitched my son to this state. What exactly did our Mo family owe her in our previous life for Ah Si to meet her in this life?

“Ah Si became like this not long after they got married. If they spend more time together, is she going to turn him against me?”

Shen Rou furrowed her brows. “To be honest, for Ah Si to treat Auntie this way today... Maybe she...”

“She’s always been trying to drive a wedge between us?” Madam Mo’s eyes burned with anger. “That must be it. I don’t even know how she made things up about me with Ah Si. No, I can’t let this vixen stay in the Mo family.”

Madam Mo suddenly got up.

Shen Rou was stunned and stood up too. “Aunt Mo, you...”

Madam Mo said angrily, “Rourou, I’m afraid I’ll have to make you wait for a few more days. When Ah Si comes back, I’ll arrange for another chance. Don’t worry. If that vixen doesn’t leave the Mo family, then I’ll leave. Ah Si’s future wife will only be you.

“I’ll go look for Old Madam now. I don’t believe that she won’t mind it after finding out about this and continue to side with that vixen.”

Shen Rou knew that she didn’t have a chance today.

But it wasn’t as if she didn’t gain anything from this trip.

That call just now made Madam Mo even more unhappy with Qiao Mianmian. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

It seemed like Madam Mo was bent on getting Qiao Mianmian and Mo Yesi to divorce.

With Madam Mo on her side, she had a higher chance of success.

Moreover, Qiao Mianmian had created two scandals in a row. Even if she hadn’t done anything intimate with those men, this was enough to ruin her image in Madam Mo’s and Old Madam’s hearts.
