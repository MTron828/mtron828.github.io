Chapter 2705: She Couldn’t Tell What Was Strange

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

She opened WeChat and prepared to sleep after wishing Mo Yesi good night.

Just as she was about to close WeChat, she saw a red “1” appear on the contact list. She opened the contact list and saw that someone had requested to add her as a friend.

The person who asked to add her as a friend was a pure white man with the nickname “Z”.

The source showed that he had added her through the search.

This “Z” person requested to add her as a friend, and there was no verification information. His Moments were also closed, and there was no useful information. Qiao Mianmian hesitated for a while before rejecting him.

Unexpectedly, the next moment, he sent another friend request.

This time, probably because he was afraid that she would reject him again, he added, “I’m from XX agency. Miss Qiao, please accept.”

Qiao Mianmian looked at the new verification and hesitated for a few seconds before nodding.

She didn’t add strangers.

But if the other party was someone in the industry who knew her, she wouldn’t reject him even if she wasn’t familiar with him.

She didn’t know whether they could work together in the future.

In any case, she felt that adding another person wasn’t a big deal. Moreover, this might be an opportunity for many newbies.

She clicked on the add-on, and the person sent her a WeChat message.

Z: [Hello, Miss Qiao.]

Out of courtesy, Qiao Mianmian replied: [Hello, may I know who sent you my WeChat? Do you have anything to discuss with me?]

Z replied quickly: [Yes, I got it from a friend. I’m very interested in Miss Qiao’s temperament and image. I have an advertisement to discuss with Miss Qiao. I wonder if Miss Qiao is interested?]

So, he wanted to talk to her about an advertisement.

Qiao Mianmian was very popular now, and many brands wanted her endorsement.

But Z was the first person to add her on WeChat.

Qiao Mianmian felt that this person was a little strange.

Under normal circumstances, such matters were discussed with her manager.

It wasn’t common to look for artistes directly.

But although Qiao Mianmian had some doubts, she didn’t think too much about it. Although such a situation wasn’t common, it wasn’t unheard of.

It was probably because there were too many people looking for her to be their spokesperson. The competition was huge, and the other party felt that it was better to find her in person.

Qiao Mianmian had just told Linda that she wanted to retire temporarily, so she naturally didn’t want to take on any other jobs.

She politely declined: [I’m sorry, please talk to my manager about work. I won’t talk about this directly.]

Z replied quickly: [I’m sorry to disturb Miss Qiao.]

Before Qiao Mianmian could reply, Z sent another message.

Z: [It’s so late, Miss Qiao should be resting. Then, I won’t disturb Miss Qiao’s rest. Good night.]

Qiao Mianmian was stunned by the last “good night”.

She felt strange, but she couldn’t put her finger on it.

But out of politeness, she still replied: [Alright, good night.]

After replying, Qiao Mianmian deleted the chat and exited WeChat.

After flying for a full 10 hours and almost two hours at the hotel, Qiao Mianmian was exhausted and sleepy.

She put her cell phone aside and turned off the lights.. After a while, she fell asleep.
