Since he didn’t care, why should she?

“It’s getting late, think about what to eat for lunch.” Mo Yesi patted her head. “Think about if there’s anything you need to buy. We’ll go to the mall after lunch.”

...

Qiao Mianmian wanted to eat hot pot, but considering that Mo Yesi couldn’t eat spicy food, she chose a restaurant with a lighter taste.

After the meal, she didn’t have anything to buy, so they went back.

The servants were shocked to see Mo Yesi.

After all, he rarely went home during work hours.

Later, a housemaid found out that Qiao Mianmian was flying to F City in the afternoon. Mo Yesi came back with her to pack her luggage and send her off. She enviously told the other housemaids.

The housemaids were envious.

“Young Master treats Young Madam so well.”

“Yes, Young Master is very busy at work too. Before getting together with Young Madam, he often worked overtime in the office. Now that he’s married and has Young Madam, I feel that Young Master’s focus is no longer on his work.” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“That’s right. Young Master used to be a workaholic and rarely returned home. Moreover, don’t you think that Young Master’s temper has improved a lot since he got together with Young Madam? No, I should say that he’s more humane now. He’s no longer as cold as before. To be honest, although Young Master is very good-looking, I was really afraid of him in the past.”

“Everyone says that Young Master and Miss Shen are the most compatible, but I think Young Master and Young Madam are very compatible too. Initially, I felt that Young Madam’s background wasn’t good enough and wasn’t compatible with Young Master. But now, I’ve changed my mind. I feel that marriage doesn’t have to be compatible. Young Master and Young Madam are very good too.”

“Does that mean we have a chance to marry into a rich family?”

“Pfft, stop dreaming. Young Madam’s background isn’t good enough, but do you have her looks? If you don’t have even that, don’t even think about having such a good life. If you look like Young Madam, you’re destined to marry into a rich family. Birth isn’t important anymore.”

The housemaids were discussing fervently.

Upstairs, Mo Yesi took out Qiao Mianmian’s luggage and opened the closet to help her pack.

Men had been pampered since they were young, but their ability to take care of themselves was stronger than many ordinary people.

He packed his luggage more professionally than Qiao Mianmian did. Every piece of clothing was neatly packed.

In the past, Qiao Mianmian used to pack her own luggage and put her clothes in haphazardly.

Looking at how Mo Yesi cleaned her up, she felt ashamed as a woman.

Mo Yesi pushed her aside.

“I’ll pack your luggage, you don’t have to bother about it. You can bring some of your usual skincare products over, I’ll help put them on too.”

“Oh, alright.”

Qiao Mianmian obediently went to the washroom and grabbed the skincare products and makeup she usually used.

When she brought them over, Mo Yesi had already packed her clothes.

Her underwear was also folded neatly in a corner.

He took the skincare products from her and finished packing in a few minutes.

Qiao Mianmian couldn’t help but sigh. “Mo Yesi, I feel like my life skills are deteriorating after marrying you.”
