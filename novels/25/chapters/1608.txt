Chapter 1609: The Gong and Shangguan Families Might Have Plans for an Alliance Marriage

“Sort of.” Bai Yusheng watched as Shangguan Qing left. “The Shangguan Family isn’t in Yuncheng City, but they have a lot of power in other places. Our family has some dealings with the Shangguan Family, so we’ve met a few times in the past.

“The girl just now should be the only daughter of the Shangguan Family. They only have this one daughter, so they dote on her very much. This also raised her arrogant, domineering, and lawless personality. She must have had some misunderstanding about you, that’s why she came to look for you.”

Bai Yusheng quickly recalled the scandal between Qiao Mianmian and Gong Zeli and said, “She must have seen the scandal between you and Gong Zeli online. I heard that the Shangguan Family wants to develop in Yuncheng City, and they have moved here.

“It seems like the Gong and Shangguan families are planning to have a marriage alliance. Otherwise, Shangguan Qing wouldn’t have come to the set.”

Qiao Mianmian nodded.

So, she was an arrogant rich girl.

She thought about Shangguan Qing’s personality and Gong Zeli’s personality. It seemed like she could already see their marriage in chaos.

But...

Didn’t Gong Zeli like Shen Rou?

He probably wouldn’t like a girl with Shangguan Qing’s personality. Moreover, Qiao Mianmian didn’t think that Gong Zeli would be willing to listen to his family’s arrangements.

If he didn’t like Shangguan Qing, even if his family arranged a marriage for him, he wouldn’t agree.

Qiao Mianmian thought about her scandal with Gong Zeli and felt a little upset.

She didn’t know why people always said that she had an ambiguous relationship with him.

“I’ll talk to the Shangguan Family about this.” Bai Yusheng looked serious. “No matter the reason she came to the set to cause trouble, if she dares to treat you like this, I want the Shangguan Family to give us an explanation.”

“Brother, there’s no need. She’s already gone. She didn’t cause me any substantial harm. There’s no need to affect the relationship between the Bai and Shangguan families over such a small matter.”

After knowing that the Bai and Shangguan families had business dealings, Qiao Mianmian felt that it was better to avoid trouble.

She didn’t want to affect their business relationship over this matter.

It wasn’t serious enough.

“Why not?” Bai Yusheng was firm. “How could the daughter of the Bai Family be bullied by the daughter of the Shangguan Family? Don’t bother about this. I know what to do.”

“But...” Qiao Mianmian still wanted to persuade him.

“Alright, Mianmian. Your next scene is about to begin. Get ready.” Bai Yusheng didn’t give her any chance to reject him, turned, and left.

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

Forget it.

If her brother wanted to stand up for her, then let him.

Since he wasn’t worried about affecting their business, she didn’t have anything to worry about.

It was good to clarify things with the Shangguan Family.

Qiao Mianmian didn’t want Shangguan Qing to come looking for her again. It wasn’t that she was afraid of her, but that she couldn’t be bothered to deal with such nonsense.

...

Shangguan Qing’s incident was like a small episode. Although it affected Qiao Mianmian, it wasn’t much.

But when Gong Zeli found out that Shangguan Qing went to look for Qiao Mianmian, he was furious.

Madam Gong called him and asked him to come home for dinner.

After knowing that Shangguan Qing would be around, Gong Zeli agreed.Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m
