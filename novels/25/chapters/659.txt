Chapter 661: He Has Fallen for Her

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

That sort of young girl wasn’t his cup of tea even if she was pretty.

She... didn’t have to worry at all.

But she still had to find out the relationship between them.

Otherwise, she wouldn’t feel at ease.

Qiao Mianmian had no idea that Huang Yilin had already made her a potential love rival in just one minute.

Then, in another minute, she was removed from it.

“Thank you for your concern, Director Bai. I had a good sleep last night. I took the bus from the production crew today.” Qiao Mianmian took a deep breath and replied politely.

Bai Yusheng nodded. “That’s good. But you can come in my car in the future. Give me a call before you leave, and I’ll bring you along.”

“Oh, I forgot, you don’t have my contact details.”

Bai Yusheng took out his cell phone and said to Qiao Mianmian, “Give me your cell phone number, I’ll call you.”

Qiao Mianmian heard a gasp.

Even she widened her eyes in shock.

Huang Yilin, who’d already let her guard down and didn’t take her seriously, turned gloomy the moment she heard that.

It was as ugly as it could get.

The others looked at Qiao Mianmian meaningfully.

They quickly re-evaluated their relationship.

So this newbie didn’t have Director Bai’s contact details.

In that case, they definitely weren’t close friends.

If they were friends, how could they not have each others’ contact numbers?

If they weren’t friends, Director Bai’s series of actions seemed like he’d taken a liking to this newbie.

He took the initiative to ask for her contact details...

He must have taken a liking to her.

Aiyaya.

This newbie was so lucky.

Director Bai actually liked her.

Many women in the entertainment industry wanted to cozy up to an outstanding man like Director Bai. But he was a clean freak and had high standards, so none of the female artistes succeeded.

Countless female artistes would knock on Director Bai’s door and ask for the unwritten rule.

But they were all rejected. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Even the female international star, Miss Cheng, had taken the initiative to hook up with him, only hoping to have a “good time” with him, but was rejected by him.

She was a rather beautiful woman.

So Director Bai actually liked such pure and innocent actresses.

No wonder he rejected Miss Cheng.

Miss Cheng was beautiful, but she was a sexy type of beauty.

The female artistes in the entertainment industry knew very well what it meant to be liked by Bai Yusheng.

This was practically a golden opportunity for her.

The female artistes present were green with envy.

It was as if they were watching a show.

After all, everyone knew what Huang Yilin was thinking.

Although she didn’t openly pursue Bai Yusheng, she didn’t hide her feelings for him.

This newbie was already being targeted by Huang Yilin.

But...

That might not be the case.

With Bai Yusheng’s status, even if he really liked this newbie, how long could that last for?
