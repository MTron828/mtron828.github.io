Chapter 1557: May I Know This Lady’s Surname?

“I think it’s pretty good out there. I can do whatever I want. I don’t have to look at people’s faces or suffer.”

“Wenpei, you’re not a child anymore, don’t...”

“Enough, Mo Yunchen. I don’t want to hear this.” Madam Mo hung up angrily. Seeing that Mo Yunchen was calling again, she turned off her cell phone.

Just as she was getting angry, a gentle and polite voice sounded beside her. “Madam, can I sit here?”

Madam Mo looked up and saw an elegant young girl standing in front of her.

The girl looked about 24 or 25 years old.

She looked just like her.

She wasn’t a beauty in the traditional sense, but she looked very comfortable.

Madam Mo looked around and saw that there were other empty seats. She was about to ask the girl why she didn’t sit in the other empty seats when she heard the girl say gently, “Madam, can’t I? I prefer the seats here. If Madam thinks I’ll disturb you, then I’ll apologize.”

Madam Mo looked at the girl and kept quiet for a while. She smiled and said, “There’s nothing to disturb. Since you like it here, then sit here. I’m feeling bored alone, so it’s more lively with more people.”

“Thank you, Madam.”

The young girl thanked her and sat down beside Madam Mo.

She called the waiter over and ordered a cup of coffee and some desserts.

After the waiter left, Madam Mo sized up the young girl again.

Madam Mo had grown up in a rich family and was surrounded by all sorts of rich and powerful people. She had seen a lot and could tell that the girl’s identity was unusual.

She sized her up for a while and said calmly, “May I know this lady’s surname?”

The girl looked unfamiliar.

From her dressing, she didn’t look like she was from Yuncheng City.

The young girl looked up and smiled elegantly. “My surname is Tang. May I know Madam’s surname?”

“So it’s Miss Tang. My surname is Mo.”

Madam Mo quickly searched through the influential families in Yuncheng City, but she couldn’t find any families with the surname Tang.

She was even more sure that this girl wasn’t from Yuncheng City.

“Madam Mo.” The young girl smiled and said, “I just came to Yuncheng City for a vacation. I don’t know where in Yuncheng City is worth visiting. Madam Mo is a local, can you recommend a few places for me?” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“Of course.”

Madam Mo had a good impression of the girl, so her attitude was especially good.

She enthusiastically introduced the girl and asked about other things related to her.

After asking around, she slowly found out that the girl came from a good family background. When she found out that she was still single, her attitude towards her became even more enthusiastic.

Madam Mo was actually very satisfied with Qiao Mianmian’s current status.

She wanted to mend their relationship.

But Qiao Mianmian didn’t have such plans.

Moreover, Old Madam had reprimanded her over and over again for Qiao Mianmian, making her lose face. Madam Mo hated Qiao Mianmian deeply now.

Even though Qiao Mianmian already had an identity that matched the Mo family’s background, Madam Mo was still very unhappy with her.

She felt that Qiao Mianmian must have sowed discord between them.
