“I hoped the Mo family could get better. I did that for their own good…

“Was I wrong? I was thinking for them, but why did everyone blame me and say that I was wrong?” Tears rolled down her cheeks. “Tell me, was I really wrong?

“I have nothing now. My husband, my two sons…”

“Madam.” The housemaid couldn’t bear to see Madam Mo cry every day. She squatted by her feet and comforted her gently. “You did that for the good of the two young

masters, but you might have used the wrong method.”

“l used the wrong method?” Madam Mo blinked. She was already 50% drunk. “How did I use the wrong method?”

The housemaid thought for a while before replying seriously, “I’ve heard a saying in the past. A person likes bananas, but you bought him a lot of apples. You even picked the

biggest and most expensive ones for him. But he likes bananas. No matter how many good apples you buy for him, he won’t like them.

“You’re so nice to them, just like how they like bananas, but you buy them lots and lots of apples.

“Your kindness isn’t what they need. It might even… bring them a lot of trouble.”

Madam Mo was stunned.

“Actually, you might think that bananas aren’t as good as apples. But to the two young masters, what suits them and what they like is the most important. If you insist on

forcing them to change their minds, they will naturally reject you and even leave you.”

“Banana, apple…” Madam Mo was stunned for a long time.

“Madam, don’t drink anymore. I’ll cook some hangover soup for you in the kitchen, alright?” The housemaid took the wine glass from Madam Mo and placed it on the coffee

table. “You didn’t eat anything for lunch. I’ll get someone to cook some porridge and some refreshing side dishes. No matter what, you have to protect your body.

“The two young masters are your biological children. As long as Madam can think things through and change your original thoughts, and then show your sincerity to make

it up to them, they will forgive you sooner or later.”

The maid got up and left.

Madam Mo sat on the sofa in a daze and thought about what the maid had just said.

On the Island.

Qiao Mianmian thought that she was the only one nervous about the wedding, but when she was led by Bai Yusheng to her groom, and he held her hand tightly, Qiao

Mianmian realized that this seemingly calm man was no different from her.

The man’s palms were sweaty. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

As soon as he held her hand, Qiao Mianmian felt a warm breath coming from his palm.

Qiao Mianmian looked up at him in shock.

The man’s side profile was so handsome. It was still the same as the first time she saw him. His eyes were deep, his nose bridge was high, his lips were thin and beautiful,

and the contours of his face were distinct.

He was different today.

He was especially… attractive to Qiao Mianmian.

He was wearing a white tuxedo and a bow tie. His hair was all combed up.

Without the hair covering his forehead, his beautiful eyes were exposed..
