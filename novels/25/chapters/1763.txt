Chapter 1764: You’re Thinking Too Much, I Never Thought So

“That’s it, have breakfast first. I’ll get someone to prepare it immediately.”

Since he said so, the person in charge couldn’t reject him anymore. Moreover, they hadn’t had a good meal before they came. They only ate a few mouthfuls, and many of them were still hungry.

Since the other party didn’t mind their freeloading, there was no reason to reject them.

The in-charge nodded. “Thank you.”

“You’re welcome.”

Lei En immediately got someone to prepare breakfast.

...

Lei En arranged for the production crew to go to the dining room.

After he left, the group of people looked around curiously and in shock. When they saw the two oil paintings hanging on the wall, one of them said in surprise, “Aren’t these two paintings the two famous works that were auctioned in S Country? I remember doing a special topic back then. The price of the two paintings was 20 million.”

“Are these paintings real?”

“Two paintings cost more than 20 million?” Everyone looked at the two paintings in shock.

They naturally couldn’t tell if they were the originals.

But someone who could live in such a place couldn’t possibly have a fake hanging on the wall.

“Hanging 20 million on the wall so casually? What a rich man.”

“If it’s not a real tycoon, how could it be fake? Look at how much this villa is worth.”

“The vase on the shelf is an antique, right? I think I saw it at the auction, too.”

The production crew was shocked by the luxurious decor.

The decor of the dining room alone was worth tens of millions.

And it was only a small part of the villa.

The price of the entire villa was unimaginable.

“Qiao Mianmian’s boyfriend is too rich.”

Although they had read the gossip previously and knew that Qiao Mianmian’s boyfriend was a relative from the Mo Family, they were still shocked after witnessing how rich he was.

They didn’t know which side branch it was.

He was too rich.

Upstairs.

Qiao Mianmian was done washing up and changing her clothes when Lei En announced that the production crew had arrived.

Mo Yesi also changed and came out of the cloakroom with her.

Seeing that he was fully dressed, Qiao Mianmian walked over and helped him straighten his collar. “Actually, you don’t have to wake up so early with me. I can just leave with the production crew, you don’t have to send me.”

Mo Yesi looked down at the little woman who had just reached his jaw. She was focused on helping him adjust his clothes, and her eyes were gentle. Mo Yesi’s heart was full of tenderness.

He smiled and said gently, “You’re leaving soon, so of course I have to spend more time with my wife. Don’t tell me you don’t want the production crew to film me?”

“How could that be?” Qiao Mianmian looked up and glared at him. “You’ve already been exposed, alright? You’re no longer a mysterious person. Moreover, our relationship has been made public, why wouldn’t I want the production crew to film you?”

“Because you don’t want anyone to know that we live together,” Mo Yesi said seriously.

Qiao Mianmian said, “...You’re overthinking it. I never thought of it that way.”

After tidying her clothes, she took a step back and sized him up.

Mo Yesi stood there and let her do it.
