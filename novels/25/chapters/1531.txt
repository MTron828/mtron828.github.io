Chapter 1533: Qiao Chen Doesn’t Want to Talk to You

“But if Chen Chen doesn’t like her, he shouldn’t be so close to her.” Qiao Mianmian was still puzzled. “Besides Shen Xin, this is the first time I’ve seen another girl beside Chen Chen. And she’s so beautiful too.”

Qiao Mianmian wasn’t so worried because she was against Qiao Chen’s puppy love.

Even if Qiao Chen was in a relationship, he would find a balance between studying and dating. It wouldn’t affect his studies.

This was what Qiao Mianmian trusted the most.

It was just that Qiao Chen wasn’t in good health yet, and dating had a certain impact on him.

“Shen Xin?”

“Mm, before this, Chen Chen only had Shen Xin.”

Mo Yesi was deep in thought.

Qiao Chen and the girl walked out of the school gate. He looked up at Qiao Mianmian and stopped when he saw her.

He then turned around and said something to the girl.

The girl smiled and nodded.

Qiao Chen turned around and walked towards Qiao Mianmian.

After taking a few steps, Shen Xin suddenly appeared. She stood behind Qiao Chen and the girl and called out to Qiao Chen.

Qiao Chen stiffened and stopped in his tracks.

“Qiao Chen.”

Shen Xin bit her lip and clenched her fists. Her eyes fell on the girl who was walking with Qiao Chen just now.

She looked at the young man’s stiff back and took a deep breath. She bit her lip and said with difficulty, “Qiao Chen, do you have time now? I need to talk to you about something. Can we... talk?”

Qiao Chen’s back was still facing her. Before he could say anything, the girl turned to look at Shen Xin.

Many people knew that Shen Xin liked Qiao Chen.

She was a bold and passionate girl.

She liked Qiao Chen very much. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Shen Xin used to be the school belle in Yunzhong. She had good looks, a noble background, and excellent grades from a young age. Everything was enviable.

Many boys liked her.

Many of them were rich kids like her.

But Shen Xin wasn’t interested in them. No one expected her to like a poor guy.

That poor guy was Qiao Chen.

Not only did she like him, but she also pursued him in a high-profile manner. The poor Qiao Chen was pursued by such a rich and beautiful girl for a few years, but he actually didn’t agree.

Because of the Shen family’s power, no one dared to say anything to her.

But in private, the girls who were jealous of her said all sorts of nasty things.

For example, Qiao Chen didn’t want anything to do with her. How pathetic.

How could she be so thick-skinned? She knew that Qiao Chen wasn’t interested in her, but she still pestered him.

In any case, women had always been the most hostile towards women.

Among the group of girls who were jealous of Shen Xin, there was also this girl with Qiao Chen.

The girl’s name was Lin Xiaoya, and she was the school belle chosen in the second half of the year.

“Shen Xin, can’t you tell?” Lin Xiaoya looked at Shen Xin with hostility, as if she was looking at a third party. “Qiao Chen doesn’t want to talk to you.”

Shen Xin looked at her expressionlessly. “Whether Qiao Chen is willing or not is up to him. If he doesn’t want to talk to me, I won’t pester him.”
