Mo Yesi raised his brow. “Mm? Baby, I’m afraid you can’t wear this anymore. I’m sorry for being so rough and ripping it.”

Qiao Mianmian said a little awkwardly, “If you let Personal Assistant Wei buy me new clothes, wouldn’t he know... wouldn’t he know what we did in here.”

It was so shameful.

Mo Yesi was stunned for a while, but he then smiled in amusement. “You’re worried about this?”

Qiao Mianmian nodded.

It felt bad enough that she was doing this with Mo Yesi in his office.

If someone else knew about it... Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Ahhh, how was she going to face his employees in the future?

Mo Yesi smiled even wider now. He bent over and pinched her cheek gently. “I’m sorry, Baby. I might have to disappoint you.”

“W-What do you mean?”

Mo Yesi sighed. “I’m afraid Wei Zheng and the rest heard all of it.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

She widened her eyes in disbelief. “Aren’t the walls of your office soundproofed? Why would they hear it?”

“Baby...” Mo Yesi smiled and said something that made her go bright red. “You were pretty loud just now. The walls are rather soundproof already, but I believe they heard at least a bit of it.”

Qiao Mianmian was so embarrassed.

How was she going to face Wei Zheng in the future?

And all the other secretaries...

She was abashed and frustrated. “It’s all your fault! I hate you!”

Mo Yesi wasn’t angry at her at all. Instead, he bent over and hugged her endearingly. “Baby, this is nothing. I like how you were.”

“Don’t be shy. Even if Wei Zheng and the rest heard it, they won’t say anything. They wouldn’t dare bring it up in front of you.”

“Moreover, what’s there to be embarrassed about? We’re husband and wife, isn’t this very normal? If others find out that we do it in the office, they’ll be envious of our relationship. They’ll be envious of you... for having a husband who loves you so much.”

But Qiao Mianmian still felt ashamed.

It was broad daylight, and they were doing this in an office...

“In any case, you’re not to touch me when we’re out anymore!” She bit her lip and said, “If you go on like this, I’ll ignore you.”

Baddie.

Big baddie.

She knew it. He was a big bully.

A man who stayed away from women?

Nonsense!

If he was considered a man who stayed away from women, then every man on earth was like that.

Mo Yesi was in great spirits now and going along with whatever she said.

He agreed to it.

Anyway, it was more important to win her over first, for now.

As to whether he could achieve it or not... that was another matter.

She said he wasn’t to touch her outside anymore?

How was it possible?

After having a taste of her, he couldn’t stop craving her.

Just like right now...

He wanted her again.

The moment he thought about how she moved under his weight just now, he could feel blood rush to that part of his body.

But he knew that he couldn’t touch her anymore today.

She must be really tired out.

If he did it again, it would really hurt her body.

Anyway, they had a lot more time together. He could afford to let her have a good rest for now.
