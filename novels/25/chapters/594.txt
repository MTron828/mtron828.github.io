Chapter 595: Chairman Mo Has Really Changed

The man staring at her reached out calmly. Just as she was about to fall, he caught her with his strong arms and steadily helped her up.

Qiao Mianmian fell into his arms.

She instinctively grabbed onto Mo Yesi’s chest that she was just fantasizing about.

The man’s body was burning hot.

She felt his scorching hot skin beneath her palms.

As she touched his chest, he let out a low grunt and tightened his hands around her waist.

He started to breathe heavily.

Qiao Mianmian immediately withdrew her hands, shocked by the electricity.

Panicking, she looked up and met the man’s gaze. Her legs turned weak when she saw the familiar look of lust in his eyes.

She tried to push him away, but he tightened his arms again.

He couldn’t let her escape. Lifting her chin, he leaned in for a deep kiss.

He pinned her down on the sofa. Unable to struggle and fight back, she gave up.

A few minutes later.

“Wait...” Qiao Mianmian realized she was distracted and almost forgot the most important thing. She grabbed Mo Yesi’s hand and said breathlessly, “Con.. condom.”

She thought that Mo Yesi did not prepare it.

So she would have a reason to reject him.

Unexpectedly, he stood up with composure, reached beside the sofa, and fished out a condom.

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

Mo Yesi grinned, bent down, and handed it to her.

He said with a low and extremely sexy voice, “Baby, open it for me.”

Qiao Mianmian’s heart skipped a beat.

She stared at the condom in her hands.

It was Strawberry-flavored.

And the largest size.

...

They only had lunch two hours later.

They did not eat out.

Wei Zheng helped to deliver the food to them.

When Chairman Mo received the food, Wei Zheng unintentionally saw that he had some red scratch marks on his chest.

The marks looked fresh.

As if the scratches had just happened.

Realizing what had happened in the office, Wei Zheng’s emotions were indescribable.

Chairman Mo... had changed.

He was no longer a workaholic that was innocent and distancing himself from women.

He changed.

He was no longer able to withstand temptations.

...

In the office.

Mo Yesi closed the door and took the food to the lounge. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

On the single bed in the lounge.

Qiao Mianmian was wrapped in a bathrobe on the bed. Feeling exhausted, she slept.

“Baby, let’s eat first before you continue sleeping.”

Mo Yesi sat on the side of the bed and pinched her cheeks lightly.

“Go away, you’re annoying.”

Qiao Mianmian was drained. She closed her eyes and did not want to move as her whole body was aching.

She wouldn’t be nice to the culprit.

Mo Yesi had already eaten and was in a good mood. Although she scolded him, he gently said, “Baby, listen to me. Sleeping with an empty stomach isn’t good for your body.”
