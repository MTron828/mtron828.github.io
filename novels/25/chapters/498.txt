Chapter 499: Are You Upset?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Qiao Mianmian asked, “How many flowers did you order?”

“1314. I’ve heard that this number has quite a good meaning behind it.”

There was no response.

“But the thing is that my apartment doesn’t have space for so many flowers.”

Qiao Mianmian was thankful for the flowers.

But if things continued, her house would soon be filled with them.

Mo Yesi frowned after she finished her sentence.

Qiao Mianmian thought that he was unhappy and quickly explained. “I loved your flowers. But is it possible that you can reduce the number? I really don’t have the space to store them. Plus, it’s a pity to throw them away after they wither.

“I bet these flowers must have cost a fortune? If you really want to give me gifts, I would prefer more practical ones.”

As the words left her mouth, Qiao Mianmian thought that she was being extremely unromantic.

But she really hoped that Mo Yesi would be more practical in his gifting.

The best would be to use his fortune to treat her to delicacies.

“Are you upset?” Qiao Mianmian asked as she tried to size up his expression.

Maybe she should have said it another way?

Regardless, the reason why he did all these was that he cared about her and wanted her to be happy.

“No, I’m not,” Mo Yesi replied while looking at the girl in his arms. He then continued gently, “How could I be angry with you? If you don’t like it when I give you so many flowers at once, I’ll take note in the future.”

“But you... you really looked angry just now.”

Mo Yesi took a moment before replying smilingly, “I was just thinking of something else. Baby, let’s get back on track. What do you think about my suggestion just now?”

Qiao Mianmian wasn’t going to be difficult. She wasn’t going to reject him since he was already being so direct.

She looked at him, nodded, and answered, “Yes, I do.”

Hearing that, Mo Yesi smiled and kissed her.

...

Immediately, he started on his work again.

Even though he was the boss, he still needed to take responsibility for everything in the company. This was especially when he had just taken over the Mo Corporation.

Once he started, he was completely focused on work matters and didn’t have many interactions with Qiao Mianmian.

Qiao Mianmian was worried that she might interrupt his work and didn’t speak to him as well.

She took out her cell phone, turned off the sound effects, and started to play the game she downloaded.

One was sitting at the desk while the other was on the sofa. They didn’t interfere with each others’ matters. Occasionally, they would take a look at each other before resuming their individual matters.

Even though there wasn’t any interaction between them, it was a clearly different feeling compared to being alone.

Qiao Mianmian found that she enjoyed their way of interaction.

Time passed quickly.

Unknowingly, it was noon already.

Mo Yesi was finally done with his work.

As he finished one of the documents, he lowered his pen and rubbed his forehead.

Then, he looked up to the lady on the sofa.

Her small stature took up a small portion of the sofa. She was focused on playing a game on her phone, her slender fingers moving quickly across the screen.

Her hair was down, covering half of her face.

Her face was smaller than his palm.

Now that half her face was covered, it looked even smaller. Her eyes also looked relatively larger.

Her eyes were glittering. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Her thick lashes were so long that they almost covered her eyes.
