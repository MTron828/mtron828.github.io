Chapter 363: Are You Sure You Don’t Want to Consider It?

Qiao Chen was speechless.

Even though he enjoyed the food in this store, he wasn’t willing to wait for one to two hours for his meal.

But since his sister wanted to, he couldn’t say no.

Mo Yesi overheard their conversation. He thought for a moment before patting Qiao Mianmian and saying, “Wait here with Qiao Chen. I’ll be back in a while.”

“Yes.”

Qiao Mianmian thought that he was heading to the bathroom and nodded.

...

Mo Yesi found a private room and knocked on the door.

Its occupants thought that it was the waiter and said, “Come in.”

Mo Yesi then opened the door and headed inside.

There were seven to eight people in the room, sitting around the table.

They seemed to have just settled in not long ago. The pot had only just arrived and their orders weren’t even completely fulfilled.

As they saw that the person entering was a dashing young man wearing formal attire, they were puzzled. One of them sized up Mo Yesi and asked, “Are you in the wrong room?”

Mo Yesi could never be a waiter with his looks and clothes.

He must have entered the wrong room.

Mo Yesi shook his head and replied, “I’m sorry, but can I take over your private room?”

The group was shocked.

Was there something wrong with this guy?

How dare he ask them to give up the private room.

They spent almost an hour in the queue for this room, and they hadn’t even eaten anything. They would be too crazy to give it up.

“Mister, if you wish to eat hot pot, go back and join the queue. We also queued up to get this room. I’m sorry, but we aren’t giving it up,” the guy replied with some anger in his voice.

Mo Yesi’s request was too ridiculous.

They weren’t going to be nice to someone who requested something so ridiculous.

Mo Yesi smiled and said, “I will pay you guys for giving up the room.”

“Pay us for giving up the room?” One of the guys frowned. He slammed the table and said angrily, “The audacity of this guy! You think that just because you’re willing to pay us, we would give up this room to you?”

“We don’t need your money. Now, would you please get out and stop ruining the atmosphere?”

“That’s right. Where did this lunatic come from, anyway? He has the cheek to request something like this while others are dining.”

“He’s handsome, but there seems to be something wrong with his head.”

Mo Yesi wasn’t bothered by the insults. He continued smiling as his hand slipped into his pocket, and he said, “My wife loves this restaurant’s hot pot. There are too many people queueing outside, and I cannot bear to let her wait for too long.

“If you’re willing to give up this private room, I’ll give a hundred thousand to each one of you. Are you sure you don’t want to consider it?”

...

A few minutes later.

Mo Yesi came back. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

A waiter was following after him.

“Sir, Miss, would you please follow me.” The waiter smiled.

Qiao Mianmian was puzzled. “Where to?”

The waiter replied, “He has booked a private room already. Please follow me to the room.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

She looked at Mo Yesi with wide eyes and asked, “You booked a private room?”
