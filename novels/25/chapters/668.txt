Chapter 670: “Take Good Care”

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Tu Yilei pursed his lips and kept quiet for a while. “Anyway, I won’t date now. You can rest assured about that.”

Michael looked up and frowned.

He didn’t deny it...

Based on his understanding of his Little Tu, it was a fact that he didn’t deny it.

This little brat really liked that girl surnamed Qiao.

He knew that with that girl’s looks, how could he not be tempted?

“Little Tu Tu, it’s not that I don’t want you to date. But it’s not suitable for you to date at this time. Moreover, even if you want to date, that little girl isn’t suitable for you,” Michael said earnestly after a moment of silence.

“Why?” Tu Yilei’s eyes flickered.

“When I arrived, I heard that Bai Yusheng has taken a liking to that girl. Do you want to snatch her from him? He’s not someone to be trifled with. We can’t afford to offend him.”

Tu Yilei frowned. “I heard about it too. I think there’s a misunderstanding.”

“Misunderstanding? What misunderstanding?” Michael sneered when he saw that he wasn’t willing to give up. “She’s just a newbie. If Bai Yusheng hadn’t taken a liking to her, would he have treated her like that? Why don’t I see him treating other female artistes like that?”

Tu Yilei pursed his lips and clenched his fists.

His eyes darkened.

After all, he was the artiste he groomed. He was no different from his own child.

Seeing that he was upset, Michael couldn’t bear to see him like this. He sighed and patted him on the shoulder. “Little Tu Tu, listen to me. Your career is the most important thing right now. Let’s put the rest aside first.”

“You and she are still young. If you two are fated, you might have a chance in the future.”

Tu Yilei looked away.

It was almost noon, and the sunlight was blinding.

His eyes were slightly red.

He had just fallen for her... and it was already over?

This was... the first time he was attracted to a girl.

He really... didn’t want to give up just like that.

Huang Yilin returned to the car to touch up on her makeup. She pinched her lipstick and glared at the logo.

“Sister Yilin, the production crew is rushing us. They’re asking the actors to get their makeup done and get changed.” The assistant beside her reported carefully.

Even though he’d been with Huang Yilin for years.

Seeing her like this, the assistant still felt a little apprehensive.

Huang Yilin was in a bad mood.

And they were the ones closest to her, so they were the easiest to anger.

Huang Yilin bit her lip and kept quiet. After a while, she smiled coldly and said, “Go and say hi to the production crew and get them to ‘take good care’ of that newbie with the surname Qiao. Oh right, keep a low profile. Don’t let Bai Yusheng and Tu Yilei find out.”

Qiao Mianmian was still a nobody, so she didn’t have a makeup artist.

She shared one with other artistes.

They also shared a dressing room.

It was less than half an hour before the shoot began when she was informed to get her makeup done and change her clothes.

And the makeup and hairstyling would take at least two hours to get done.

When she reached the dressing room, she saw that everyone had already put on their makeup and changed into their costumes.
