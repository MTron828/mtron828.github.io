Chapter 574: Call Me Hubby

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

As she felt that he’d done it deliberately.

He always seemed so serious and self-disciplined, but when it came to this aspect, he had some terrible traits.

As she guessed...

She couldn’t count on his words.

“Mo Yesi, don’t touch...”

Before she finished her sentence, the man already held her tightly.

He pressed her body to his tightly and found her little hand.

He then began rubbing it slowly with just the right amount of force.

He chuckled and looked into her eyes, saying domineeringly, “I’m your husband. You’re my wife. If you won’t let me touch you, then who would you let?”

“Or, would you rather your husband touch someone else?”

Qiao Mianmian said, “... Mo Yesi, you...”

“Call me Hubby.”

There was no response.

The man looked at her directly and said, as if in command, “Baby, call me Hubby.

“Didn’t you call me that rather naturally when you were talking to Shen Rou in my office today?

“Say it again for me, mm?”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

Her face flushed and her heart began racing.

How could he compare that time to now?

Back then, she didn’t know that he’d been eavesdropping from outside.

If she knew, she wouldn’t have said it that way.

She was too embarrassed to say it now to him...

Although they were a couple, and that he was her husband...

She found it embarrassing to call him that to his face.

“You don’t want to?” Mo Yesi narrowed his eyes, and his arm around her waist shifted upwards. His hand began venturing dangerously once again as he said, “Do you feel like I don’t love you enough? Since that’s the case, then I’ll just have to love you harder.”

Sensing how his huge hand was hovering around threateningly, Qiao Mianmian’s expression changed.

She hurriedly grabbed Mo Yesi’s hand.

“Mo Yesi, don’t...”

No...

She was now sure that he wasn’t normal!

They’d just come out from the bathroom.

And now he...

Wasn’t he afraid he’d die of overproduction?

He was terrifying. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Qiao Mianmian was scared.

She suddenly recalled something he’d said before, that he wouldn’t be tormenting her just like that if he truly wanted to satisfy all his desires.

Based on his extraordinary energy and perversion, she didn’t think she would be able to satisfy him fully with her petite and weak body.

She’d probably die in bed.

Becoming the first woman who died of providing too much pleasure.

“You’re still calling me Mo Yesi?” The man held her chin and bit her lip.

Qiao Mianmian squeezed her eyes shut in pain.

Damn it.

This man was a beast.

He actually bit her, and with such force.

“Do you really need Hubby to love you hard for you to change the way you address me?” The man bit her lips once again as if it helped him feel better.
