Qiao Ruhai didn’t hear the tremble in Qiao Mianmian’s voice. He thought that she was afraid that he would pester her again, so he confirmed it.

He sneered. “That’s right. If you let your sister off, you’re even with the Qiao family. If you’re afraid that I’ll go back on my word, I can write a note for you. That way, you can rest assured!”

“No need.”

Qiao Mianmian clenched her fists. “I promise you. Don’t worry, I won’t ruin your daughter’s career.

“Dad, I really didn’t expect you to beg me for her.

“Although I know you won’t believe me, I still want to say that Qiao Anxin wasn’t blacklisted by me.”

Behind her, Qiao Ruhai’s expression changed, but he didn’t say anything.

Qiao Anxin was pleasantly surprised.

Qiao Mianmian didn’t turn around. After saying her last sentence, she left quickly.

...

When she returned, Qiao Mianmian met Bai Yusheng walking towards her.

Bai Yusheng especially came out to look for her.

Knowing that the Qiao family was looking for her, he was worried that she would feel aggrieved. But when he saw Qiao Mianmian, he realized that her eyes were red.

Bai Yusheng frowned and quickly walked to her.

He looked down at her and saw that Qiao Mianmian’s eyes were indeed red. He immediately frowned and asked, “Mianmian, what’s wrong? Who bullied you?”

Qiao Mianmian kept thinking about what Qiao Ruhai said.

She had been holding back her tears all this while, but now that she met Bai Yusheng’s concerned gaze, she couldn’t hold it in anymore.

Tears rolled down her cheeks.

Seeing her cry, Bai Yusheng got even more anxious.

He placed a hand on her shoulder and frowned. “You saw the Qiao family? Did they say something about you that made you feel aggrieved? Mianmian, you’re the Bai family’s baby now. No one can make you feel aggrieved. If the Qiao family bullies you, I’ll help you vent your anger.”

“Brother, I’m fine.” The more Bai Yusheng showed concern for her, the more Qiao Mianmian cried.

She couldn’t control herself.

She didn’t feel aggrieved just now, but when Bai Yusheng showed concern for her, she felt aggrieved.

Father Qiao’s words stabbed her heart like needles.

It hurt.

How could Bai Yusheng believe her?

She said she was fine, but she kept crying.

She must be suffering a lot.

Thinking about how Qiao Anxin and Lin Huizhen treated her badly in the past and made her suffer a lot, Bai Yusheng’s face darkened.

“Did Qiao Anxin do something to hurt you again? Mianmian, you’re my sister, we’re related by blood. I hope you can confide in me.

“You can say anything to me.

“I hope you can treat me as your real brother. Do you know how anxious I am as your brother?”

Qiao Mianmian slowly looked up.

Her eyes were still misty as she looked at Bai Yusheng sadly.

Her eyes and the tip of her nose were red as she said in a sobbing voice, “Brother.”
