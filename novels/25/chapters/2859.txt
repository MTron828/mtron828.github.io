Chapter 2861: Qiao Anxin Accepted the Reporter’s Interview

“Alright, then.” Gong Zeli smiled and said casually, “Do you need me to make a statement? This way, it’ll be more formal and everyone will know that I’ve broken off my relationship with the Gong family.

“Whatever I do in the future has nothing to do with the Gong family anymore.”

Madam Gong was stunned for a moment before a look of disbelief appeared on her face. “Y-You… Do you know what you’re saying? Do you know what your words mean?”

She couldn’t believe it.

Gong Zeli was willing to give up everything he had and cut ties with the Gong family.

Was he crazy?

“Of course I know.” Gong Zeli sneered. “If this is what you want, then so be it. Is there anything else? If not, can I leave?”

Madam Gong’s face was pale and her chest was heaving up and down. She couldn’t say a word.

Gong Zeli looked at her and said coldly, “Since there’s nothing else, I won’t stay any longer. I don’t want to be an eyesore to you, Madam Gong.”

With that, he turned and walked out.

He walked very quickly and left the hall without looking back.

Only Madam Gong and the housemaids were left in the living room.

Madam Gong sat on the sofa with a terrible expression. Her face was pale from anger at first, but after Gong Zeli left, her eyes gradually reddened.

“He really wants to cut ties with me!

“He’s really willing to leave the Gong family for that woman! Is he crazy? He doesn’t even want his status as the heir of the Gong family because of a woman? Gosh, what sin have I committed? Why did I give birth to such a worrisome son? This is infuriating.”

Madam Gong suddenly burst into tears.

The housemaids standing at the side witnessed everything and looked at each other. They didn’t even dare to breathe.

Indeed, Madam and Young Master started arguing again.

And the argument this time was even more serious than last time.

It had reached the point where Young Master wanted to cut ties with the Gong family.

They also felt that Young Master was crazy.

Giving up everything for such a woman?

He was the only heir of the Gong family.

Although they knew that Madam must have said that out of anger, based on Young Master’s temper, what he said wasn’t out of anger. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Since he said he wanted to sever ties, he would really do it.

Young Master must be crazy.

He had been single-mindedly in love with Young Lady Shen for so many years, and they already felt that it wasn’t worth it.

And now he was obsessed with a married woman?

And he would give up everything for her?

Was Young Master affected by Qiao Mianmian?

…

Qiao Mianmian didn’t expect to appear again on the trending topics after just two hours.

Qiao Anxin was the reason this time.

She accepted an interview and told the reporter that the reason her contract was terminated was because Gong Zeli wanted to stand up for Qiao Mianmian.

Not only that.

She even told the reporter that she was able to sign with the management company under the Gong Corporation because she looked like Qiao Mianmian.

Gong Zeli liked Qiao Mianmian, but Qiao Mianmian was married, so it was impossible for them to be together.

Since he couldn’t be with her, he found many substitutes that looked like Qiao Mianmian.

She was one of them.

Gong Zeli already had a substitute named Su Su..
