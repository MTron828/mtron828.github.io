Chapter 1053: Normal People Wouldn’t Pick Such a Place to Date

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

The entire restaurant was lit with candles.

As the wind blew, the candlelight flickered.

Coupled with the ancient tune played by the band...

Jiang Luoli didn’t feel romantic at all. Instead, she felt like she was in a haunted house.

The dim environment created by the candles was no different from a haunted house to her.

Moreover, the scent of roses in the air was so strong that she felt sick of it.

In such an environment, she didn’t have the appetite to eat anything good.

She felt that Assistant Xu must have done it on purpose!

He deliberately came up with such an idea to mess with her!

A normal person wouldn’t pick such a place.

This restaurant was halfway up the mountain in the suburbs, and it was the only one. There were no other shops around.

Jiang Luoli got goosebumps even before entering the restaurant.

But the moment she entered the restaurant, she didn’t want to relive the horror of entering a haunted house.

If it wasn’t for her guts, she would have run away. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

And the band on stage...

Because of the poor lighting, the musicians looked like ghosts...

Jiang Luoli felt that any normal girl wouldn’t like such a way of dating.

This was too special!

“Miss Jiang, you don’t like it?” Mo Shixiu was a little stunned. He frowned again and looked worried. “Assistant Xu told me that girls would definitely like this kind of date. He said that this is romantic.

“I thought Miss Jiang would like it...”

He sounded a little disappointed.

This was his first date with Jiang Luoli.

Hence, he took it very seriously.

She didn’t like what he thought was an elaborate arrangement.

“Mr. Mo, actually, you can just pick a random restaurant.” Jiang Luoli’s lips twitched as she looked at the swaying candlelight. “Can you get someone to blow off these candles and turn on the lights? Also, can you remove the roses on the table? I think the fragrance of the flowers is too strong and a little choking.”

Mo Shixiu was speechless.

“Mr. Mo, is that alright?” Jiang Luoli blinked and waited for his reply.

Mo Shixiu pursed his lips and kept quiet for a while. Then, he called a waiter over. “Remove the candles and flowers and turn on the lights.”

“Yes, Mr. Mo.”

The waiter turned around and was about to get someone to remove all the candles and flowers. Mo Shixiu looked at the band on stage and thought for a while before calling the waiter back.

He asked Jiang Luoli, “Miss Jiang, do we need to remove the band too?”

Jiang Luoli saw the disappointment in his eyes and felt that it was too much to ask to remove the band too.

In any case, Mo Shixiu had prepared this meticulously.

He had put in a lot of effort.

His original intention was good.

It also showed that he valued this date.

Otherwise, he wouldn’t have prepared so much beforehand.

It was all that petty Assistant Xu’s fault.

He definitely didn’t want Mo Shixiu to be with her, so he took the opportunity to sabotage the date.

His intentions were truly sinister!

“There’s no need for the band.” Jiang Luoli couldn’t bear to see Mo Shixiu so dejected. It was probably because he was too good-looking and suited her aesthetics in all aspects. Facing such a man, she easily softened.
