Chapter 622: Wenpei, What Exactly Are You Talking About?

She looks sweet and cute, exactly the type that elders preferred.

Old Madam liked her even more since she was obedient.

In the dining room.

Qiao Mianmian sat beside Old Madam instead of Mo Yesi.

The dishes that Qiao Mianmian enjoyed were placed in front of her for easy reach as per Old Madam’s request.

When Qiao Mianmian casually mentioned that she liked a dessert that she ate at Mo Residence previously, Old Madam immediately asked the kitchen to prepare it for her.

Old Madam doted on her more than her two grandsons.

Mo Yesi and Mo Shixiu weren’t bothered by it.

Since there were only males in the household, it was only natural that Old Madam acted like this with the addition of a female.

The Mo family all knew that Old Madam longed for a granddaughter, but she only got grandsons.

Old Madam had two sons of her own.

Mo Yesi had another male cousin. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Together with the two brothers, Old Madam had three grandsons.

But not a single granddaughter.

Qiao Mianmian’s looks and personality were exactly what Old Madam wanted in her granddaughter. So, she treated her granddaughter-in-law just like her real granddaughter.

Mo Yesi was happy to see someone dote on his wife.

The only person uncomfortable at the dining table was Madam Mo.

Recalling Shen Rou’s call earlier today, she turned pale and threw her fork and knife on the plate with a loud “Bam.”

The wealthy households were very particular about table etiquette.

The fundamental rule was that they shouldn’t make unnecessary noises while eating.

Madam Mo grew up in a wealthy household and knew this since young.

With the loud “Bam,” everyone at the dining table halted their conversations.

Everyone turned to look at her.

Old Madam raised her brows. “Wenpei, what are you doing?”

“Mom.” Madam Mo picked up the napkin, wiped her mouth gently, and threw the napkin on the table. She looked sharply at Qiao Mianmian and said coldly, “I just recalled something and have to say it now.”

“If you have to say anything, say it after the meal.” Old Madam was unhappy with her actions. With a displeased tone, she said, “Must you say it during the meal?”

Seeing Old Madam’s expression, Madam Mo did not dare to continue.

But thinking back to what Shen Rou said, she mustered her courage and said coldly, “I have to say it now since everyone is around. I’m sorry for disturbing your meal, Mom, but this matter is very important.”

Qiao Mianmian felt Madam Mo turn to look at her.

She lifted her head and saw the look of disgust and anger in Madam Mo’s eyes. She had a bad feeling about this.

She knew that what Madam Mo wanted to say had something to do with her.

As she was thinking of this, Madam Mo asked coldly, “Mianmian, are you hiding something from us?”

Qiao Mianmian put down the juice she had just picked up.

She turned her head to face Madam Mo, courteously said, “Mom, which matter are you referring to?”

Old Madam also put down her chopsticks. “Wenpei, what exactly are you talking about?”
