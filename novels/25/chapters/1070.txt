Chapter 1071: Then, Are You Willing? We Can Work Together

Mo Yesi and Gong Zeli weren’t enough, even Bai Yusheng liked her now.

Would Yan Shaoqing like her too?

No, wait, didn’t Yan Shaoqing already have feelings for her?

Back at the KTV, Yan Shaoqing even claimed to have found true love.

If Qiao Mianmian was still single back then, he would definitely be chasing her.

The thought of the most outstanding men in Yuncheng City falling in love with that vixen filled her with hatred.

Bai Yusheng was stunned for a few seconds. “Since you know her, you should know whose woman she is. Do you think it’s appropriate to say this?”

Shen Rou smiled. “Of course I know whose woman she is. Not only do I know whose woman she is, but I also know that she’ll divorce Mo Yesi soon.”

“Divorce?” Bai Yusheng’s expression changed slightly. “You said she wants a divorce? Did she tell you that?”

Given Mo Yesi’s possessive nature, would he divorce Qiao Mianmian?

This was obviously impossible.

Moreover, the two of them were newlyweds, and it was the early time of their relationship. How could they possibly divorce?

“She didn’t tell me.” Shen Rou smiled confidently. “But she and Ah Si will definitely get a divorce. She won’t be staying in the Mo family for long. Bai Yusheng, I’m telling you this because I want you to seize the opportunity.”

Bai Yusheng pursed his lips as his gaze turned cold. “Miss Shen wants me to steal a friend’s wife? A friend’s wife is not to be trifled with. Miss Shen is, after all, a young lady from a prestigious family. You’re actually instigating someone to snatch his friend’s wife. Everyone says that Miss Shen is knowledgeable, sensible, and upright. She’s the best among all the socialites. Miss Shen’s words and actions today have really broadened my horizons.”

Shen Rou wasn’t angered by his words. “Even if you can, you can’t. Moreover, they’ll break up sooner or later. I want Mo Yesi, and you want Qiao Mianmian. We’re just getting what we want. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Bai Yusheng, as long as you’re willing, I can help you get Qiao Mianmian.” Shen Rou looked at Bai Yusheng’s darkened face and continued smiling. “It’s not easy to meet a woman that makes you fall for her. If there’s a chance to make her yours, why not give it a try?

“Moreover, with Young Master Bai’s charm, as long as you have the heart, I believe there’s no woman you can’t have.” Shen Rou stood up and walked towards him.

She looked up and said, “I’m serious. Bai Yusheng, we can work together. I can let you have Qiao Mianmian, and you can help me get Mo Yesi.”

Bai Yusheng looked at her expressionlessly for a long time.

Shen Rou thought that he was considering it and waited patiently. After a while, she asked impatiently, “Have you considered it?”

“Mm, I’ve thought about it.” Bai Yusheng finally spoke.

Shen Rou immediately asked, “Then, are you willing? We can work together.”

“Work together?” Bai Yusheng seemed really interested. He smiled and asked, “Miss Shen, how do you plan to cooperate?”

Shen Rou wasn’t too foolish. She kept quiet for a while before saying, “That depends on whether you really want to work with me. If you really do, I’ll naturally think of a way to get Qiao Mianmian for you.”

“Shen Rou, did you just say that you know a little about me? I think you’re overestimating yourself.” Bai Yusheng saw that she was smiling, but there was no smile in his eyes.
