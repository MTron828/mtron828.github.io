Chapter 1656: Shen Fei Helped Her

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

[Every role chosen by the director has been considered over and over again. The type of role the director gives you means that the role is suitable for you. Snatching the role might happen in other production teams, but it is impossible in our production team. Unless the director likes you, no amount of connections will work.]

Shen Fei had a unique personality and was independent.

She was different from other artistes in the industry. She dared to say anything.

But she rarely spoke up for anyone.

Unless they were good friends.

This was the first time she spoke up for a newbie.

As Shen Fei never liked to interfere in others’ matters, the situation quickly turned around after she spoke up for Qiao Mianmian.

People trusted Shen Fei more than Qiao Anxin.

“I choose to believe in Shen Fei. Everyone is saying that Qiao Mianmian has a backing and that she didn’t get the role with her own abilities. Just because she’s a newbie, can’t she act as the second female lead? I’ve seen the clip of her drama, her acting is really good.”

“Sister Fei rarely speaks up for anyone, and she hates people with connections. I choose to believe Sister Fei.”

“I’m on Shen Fei’s side too. Why can’t newbies get the second female lead role with their own abilities? Previously, many newbies got the female lead role. Why didn’t anyone say that they used their connections, but when it comes to Qiao Mianmian, it becomes stealing roles?”

“She’s probably jealous that Qiao Mianmian found a rich, powerful, and super handsome boyfriend. I don’t believe anyone else, but what Sister Fei says is true.”

“I won’t say much. Stand by Shen Fei.”

“Stand by Shen Fei+1.”

Shen Fei was definitely a capable actress. Her acting and reputation were especially good.

Song Lu and Qiao Anxin’s fans combined weren’t as many as Shen Fei’s.

Looking at Shen Fei’s post, Song Lu felt a little guilty.

Not long after, some netizens realized that Song Lu had deleted her post.

Only Qiao Anxin was still holding on.

Many netizens went to her Weibo and asked her what she thought of Shen Fei’s words.

Qiao Anxin replied: [I can only say that she has a lot of power. Even the Movie Queen has to side with someone in order to please her.]

Before Qiao Anxin replied, she forgot something.

Shen Fei’s fans weren’t to be trifled with. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

She was just referring to Qiao Mianmian.

But with Shen Fei involved, Shen Fei’s fans quickly went to her comment section to tear her apart.

“My Sister Fei is different from you. You need to rely on kneeling to stay in the industry. With Sister Fei’s current status, she doesn’t need to kneel and lick anyone.”

“You shameless third party, where did you get the courage to spread rumors about Sister Fei? Sister Fei said that she didn’t use her backing, so that means she didn’t do so. You even said that Sister Fei wants to curry favor with others. Do you think Sister Fei is a spineless coward?”

“Sister Fei wasn’t involved at first. You and your sister can tear each other apart however you want. We’re just enjoying the show. Why the hell did you drag Sister Fei into this? Do you believe that the Feeling Army will drown you in our saliva?”

“This is the third party who cheated on her sister’s man? How shameless. The woman who stole her sister’s man is still defaming her on the Internet. You mean you went for the audition that day too? You didn’t get it on the list of actors, right? You’re jealous of your sister and want to defame Qiao Mianmian online?”
