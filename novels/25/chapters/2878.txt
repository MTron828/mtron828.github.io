Chapter 2879: Waiting for Her Coaxing

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Mo Yesi, I’ll explain to you when I get to the office, alright?”

The man was silent for a while.

“Alright, I’ll wait for your explanation.”

…

Ten minutes later, Qiao Mianmian arrived at the Mo Corporation building.

Qiao Mianmian got out of the car and saw Wei Zheng standing at the entrance. Seeing her, he immediately walked towards her.

“Young Madam.” Wei Zheng greeted her respectfully.

“Why are you down here?” Qiao Mianmian asked.

Wei Zheng replied honestly, “Chairman Mo said you were coming and asked me to wait for you.”

Qiao Mianmian smiled.

Although he was angry with her, he still got Wei Zheng to pick her up. Even though this man was throwing a tantrum, he was still so thoughtful.

This was Mo Yesi.

It was probably because he doted on her so much that she felt fearless most of the time.

That was why she felt that no matter what happened, she didn’t have to worry about him leaving her.

Because he was always so easy to coax.

No matter how angry he was, he would be appeased if she said a few nice words and acted coquettishly.

Qiao Mianmian followed Wei Zheng into the lobby and then into the elevator. She asked, “Isn’t Chairman Mo in a bad mood?” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Wei Zheng thought for a while and nodded. “Yes, a little. But Young Madam, don’t worry. Chairman Mo isn’t unhappy because of your scandal. Chairman Mo trusts you completely and has never suspected you. Moreover, Chairman Mo has already found out that someone deliberately created those scandals to attract attention.”

Wei Zheng was afraid that Qiao Mianmian would overthink, so he explained it to her.

Qiao Mianmian smiled. “I know he won’t believe those rumors. Oh right, is he busy right now?”

“Chairman Mo just finished a meeting and isn’t very busy now. Chairman Mo has been missing you the past two days since Young Madam left. Chairman Mo will definitely be happy to see Young Madam.”

“Really?” Qiao Mianmian was skeptical.

Mo Yesi would definitely be happy.

But this time, she had to coax him for a while.

Hopefully, it wouldn’t be too difficult.

Although this man had always been easy to coax, her tricks were no longer as effective as before.

In the past, she only needed one word to coax Mo Yesi.

Now, he wouldn’t budge no matter what she said.

Mo Yesi’s benefits were actually very simple.

But… her back and legs hurt.

…

“Chairman Mo, Young Madam is here.” Wei Zheng pushed the door open and closed it gently after Qiao Mianmian entered.

Qiao Mianmian walked into the office and saw Mo Yesi reading a document.

She didn’t know if he heard Wei Zheng or not, but he pretended not to. Qiao Mianmian walked in anyway, but he still didn’t look up.

He seemed to be focused on the document he was reading.

But Qiao Mianmian knew that Mo Yesi was doing this on purpose.

He was deliberately ignoring her, pretending not to know that she was here.

He knew that she would come and even got Wei Zheng to wait for her downstairs. But now that she was here, he didn’t react at all.

He was angry with her.

He really was waiting for her to coax him.

The man sitting at the black desk was only wearing a white shirt. It was the simplest design, but it looked different on him.

His aura was outstanding and strong.. The simple white shirt became luxurious on him.
