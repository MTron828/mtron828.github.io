Chapter 734: Stay Away From Him From Now On

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

At the same time, he could also warn someone that if they dared to covet his wife again, he wouldn’t mind making him disappear from the entertainment industry.

In any case, this was a piece of cake for him.

“Baby, I’m sorry.” Mo Yesi kissed her on the lips and said in a low voice, “It’s my fault. I shouldn’t have avoided your call. If you call me in the future, I’ll pick it up immediately, alright?” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“Hmph.” Qiao Mianmian wasn’t angry anymore.

When Bai Yusheng came to look for her and told her that Mo Yesi thought something had happened to her and was worried sick, she wasn’t angry anymore.

The moment she saw him walk in, all her anger dissipated.

She knew how busy he was at work.

He hadn’t called or sent her a message to console her the moment the scandal broke out.

But he came over.

This was more useful than any consolation.

“I admit, I’m jealous.” Mo Yesi admitted his mistake. “When I saw the scandal between you and that feminine man, I felt very uncomfortable. So, I wanted to give you a cold shoulder.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

What feminine man?

Was he referring to Tu Yilei?

How was Tu Yilei a sissy?

Was it really okay for him to attack someone’s looks just because he was jealous?

“But, you know that I only lasted for an hour.” The man sounded a little bitter. “Didn’t I look for you after that? If I knew that I’d be ignored, I wouldn’t have...”

He really wasn’t suitable for a cold war.

His heart would only feel worse if he angered her.

Rather than saying that he was punishing her, he was punishing himself.

He didn’t want to do such a stupid thing ever again.

“Mo Yesi, those scandals were exaggerated. What happened...” Qiao Mianmian felt that she had to explain herself.

“You don’t have to say anymore.” Mo Yesi covered her mouth and looked at her deeply. “I’ve never doubted you. I know there’s nothing between you and him.”

“... Then, why are you jealous?”

“Mm, I’m still jealous.” The man nodded and admitted it directly. “Even if I know there’s nothing between you and him, I’ll still be jealous.”

She didn’t have any feelings for him.

But he wasn’t the same.

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

“Baby, can’t you tell?” Mo Yesi felt the need to remind his wife.

He had to be careful.

Otherwise, she’d be so silly as to not know anything.

Qiao Mianmian blinked. “See what?”

Mo Yesi furrowed his brows and then said coldly, “That sissy brat isn’t pure to you. Stay away from him from now on.”

“You mean Senior Tu?” Qiao Mianmian widened her eyes in shock. “How is that possible, how could he...”

“Why not?” Mo Yesi scoffed. “That little brat is up to no good and took advantage of you. I want to chop off his hand and feed it to the dogs. In any case, I’m a man, I won’t be wrong. His feelings for you aren’t simple.”

Qiao Mianmian wanted to rebut.

But she recalled what happened.

Back then, Tu Yilei was a little abnormal.

She pursed her lips and kept quiet.

“Baby, listen to me. Stay away from him in the future, okay?”
