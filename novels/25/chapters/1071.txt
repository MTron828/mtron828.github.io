Chapter 1072: You Lied to Me, You Tricked Me!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

His eyes were as cold as ice.

“W-What did you say?” Shen Rou frowned.

Bai Yusheng looked at her coldly. “I said you overestimated yourself. As long as you have a little understanding of me, you won’t talk to me about this. Shen Rou, if I want a woman, do I need your help?”

Shen Rou: “You...”

“Also, as long as you have some sense of shame, no matter how much you like someone, you won’t disturb them after you find out that they’re married. You wouldn’t do anything that would affect their marriage. But Miss Shen doesn’t seem to have any sense of shame.”

Seeing that Shen Rou’s expression was getting worse, Bai Yusheng sneered. “I don’t care about my feelings right now, but I do have this intention. I wouldn’t dare to accept a ‘rich girl’ like Miss Shen.”

Shen Rou didn’t expect him to embarrass her so badly.

She felt utterly humiliated.

Her face turned red as she clenched her teeth. “Bai Yusheng, you never thought of working with me. You lied to me, you tricked me!”

Bai Yusheng sneered. “You’re too stupid.”

“W-What did you say?” Shen Rou was flustered. “Is this how the Young Master of the Bai family treats ladies? Bai Yusheng, you’re too much!”

“What kind of attitude do I need to have towards a woman like you? The kind of person you are, that’s all you deserve.”

Bai Yusheng couldn’t even be bothered to be polite.

Clear disgust and unhappiness could be seen in his eyes. “Miss Shen, my attitude is already considered polite. If you were not a guest of our Bai family, I’d only say one word to you.”

Shen Rou couldn’t react in time.

When she understood what Bai Yusheng meant, her expression darkened.

Bai Yusheng couldn’t be bothered to say anything more.

He looked at her coldly and said, “Miss Shen, if you don’t want others to know about what you just said to me, then you’d better know your place. What doesn’t belong to you will never belong to you. It’s useless even if you try your best.

“Also, if you dare to do anything bad to Qiao Mianmian, I won’t let you off.”

Shen Rou widened her eyes and gritted her teeth. “Bai Yusheng, do you still dare to say that you don’t like Qiao Mianmian? Who are you to warn me and threaten me, just as a director? Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Hahaha, don’t make me behave. Aren’t you eyeing your friend’s wife too?

“I have no shame, how much better can you be!”

Bai Yusheng ignored her. “Remember what I said. Shen Rou, if you dare to touch Qiao Mianmian, I won’t let you off. If you’re not afraid of offending the Mo and Bai families, you can try.”

With that, Bai Yusheng turned and left.

At this moment, the servant who went to get the cloak walked over. She saw Bai Yusheng and greeted him respectfully. “Young Master.”

Bai Yusheng nodded. “Send the cloak to Miss Shen.”

The servant looked at Shen Rou and felt puzzled.

Miss Shen didn’t look too happy.

Young Master didn’t look too good.

But they were fine when she left.

Did they fight in such a short time?
