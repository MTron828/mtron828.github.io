There was no response.

Seeing the man make his way into the bathroom, Qiao Mianmian was stunned for a few seconds as her face began burning up a little.

She was turning slightly red again.

So...

When he came to look for her, he had already planned on staying for the night?

This man... had had it all planned right from the start. He was going to sleep with her tonight no matter what.

The bathroom lights turned on.

Soon, she could hear the sounds of running water. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

The door was made with frosted glass, so she couldn’t see the inside clearly.

But she could make out a blurry figure.

Qiao Mianmian looked up and saw Mo Yesi through the glass. The man looked like he was taking his clothes off, revealing an alluring figure...

When he raised his arms, Qiao Mianmian could actually see his toned arm muscles.

The man’s body looked... so firm, so well-built.

Qiao Mianmian watched on, her heart rate picking up.

She suddenly recalled the chaotic night.

She had been consciously trying to forget about it, such that most of that night wasn’t so clear in her mind anymore.

That night, she had been rather confused and lost. Not much was etched in her mind.

But she did remember the impressive figure of the man who made her “impure”. She had touched that body before.

Besides chest muscles, he had abdominal muscles as well. She could feel the contours of his body...

His voice was extremely alluring as well.

In that somewhat blurred recollection, he was calling her “baby” by her ear, breathing hard and passionately...

The thought of it was enough to embarrass Qiao Mianmian.

She couldn’t remember his exact tone of voice anymore.

However...

Each time Mo Yesi called her “baby”, she would think of that man.

When Qiao Mianmian realized that she had begun to associate Mo Yesi with the man who took her virginity away, she furrowed her brows, shaking that thought off.

How could he be that rapist?

How could a man of such status possibly force such a terrible thing upon someone?

This was impossible.

Qiao Mianmian quickly looked away.

She was about to unpack her luggage when she heard a ringtone.

It was Mo Yesi’s cell phone ringing.

The sudden jingle snapped her back to reality.

She heard it go on for a few seconds as she hesitated about receiving the call.

The cell phone was by the bedside. She picked it up and saw the words “Yan Shaoqing” on the screen.

She remembered Mo Yesi telling her that the Young Master of the Yan family was his friend.

It was probably this man by the name of Yan Shaoqing.

Qiao Mianmian had heard of the Yan family.

They were one of the wealthiest and most powerful families in Yuncheng City, just like the Mo family.

The cell phone was still ringing. She could still hear the sound of running water coming from the bathroom and decided to pick it up.

She immediately heard a man complaining. “Second Bro, didn’t you say you were bringing Sister-in-law to meet us, why aren’t you here yet? You said she was shy, and that you were worried that I and the other buddies would scare her. We actually chased all the other beauties away to welcome her. Do you know how boring it is for a group of guys here to just be drinking and waiting? Don’t tell me now that you aren’t coming anymore.”
