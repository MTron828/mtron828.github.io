“There’s no need.” Before she could finish, Gong Zeli interrupted her. The mockery in his eyes deepened. “I’ve said it before, it’s nothing. I’d help out if it was someone else too.

“So, you don’t have to bother about it.”

She almost said it out loud.

Gong Zeli knew that she was trying to avoid suspicion.

They’d had so many scandals in the past.

No matter how true the rumors were, at least to others, their relationship was ambiguous.

She was Mo Yesi’s wife now.

Even if she didn’t care about what others said, she cared about Mo Yesi’s feelings.

Hence, she had to keep a distance from him. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

He could understand her actions.

But seeing how she was avoiding him, his heart ached again.

The sharp pain spread from his heart to his limbs and bones. The color on his face faded at a visible rate, and his handsome face was paler than before.

Even his lips paled.

“I still have to thank you. Then… if there’s nothing else, I’ll take my leave first. My friends are still waiting for me.” Qiao Mianmian turned and left.

But she’d only taken two steps when she was blinded by the flash of a camera. Before she could react, she heard Gong Zeli’s angry voice behind her. “What are you doing?

“Stop right there.”

Gong Zeli stormed past her.

Qiao Mianmian looked up and saw two sneaky people hiding in the corner.

Seeing that Gong Zeli had discovered them, the two of them panicked and wanted to run.

Gong Zeli’s two bodyguards reacted quickly and stopped them just as they were about to run.

Gong Zeli walked towards them.

He looked down at the camera in their hands and narrowed his eyes.

The two sneaky people looked terrified and flustered when they saw him.

“Smash what they’re holding,” Gong Zeli ordered the bodyguards in a cold voice.

“Yes, Young Master Gong.”

The bodyguards immediately grabbed their cameras.

“Y-Young Master Gong, you’ve misunderstood. We weren’t taking photos of you just now. We were just taking photos of the clubhouse’s renovation efforts.” Seeing that Gong Zeli actually wanted to smash their cameras, they immediately gave an excuse and protected the cameras.

It was as if they were protecting their family heirloom.

They were reporters from Apple Weekly, and they were in charge of the entertainment section.

Of course, to put it nicely, they were entertainment reporters. In fact, they were just paparazzi.

And they were the kind of unscrupulous paparazzi who made money by digging up the artistes’ privacy.

They would follow the popular celebrities. If they were lucky enough to get something juicy, ordinary celebrities would have to spend money to buy it off them.

If the artistes weren’t willing, they would expose it to make money.

They weren’t here for Qiao Mianmian.

They didn’t have the guts.

The artiste they were following came to this clubhouse today.. Then, they accidentally found out that Qiao Mianmian and Gong Zeli were here too.
