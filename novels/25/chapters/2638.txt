Chapter 2639: When Will You Pamper Me Too?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

“This is your explanation?”

“Mm, this is my explanation. Baby, I really didn’t mean to not reply to you. But don’t worry, I’ve done what you asked me to.” The man’s tone was coaxing and pampering as if he was afraid that she would really be angry.

He even wanted to take credit for it. “That little idol named Song Fei actually dared to bully my baby. Hubby will definitely teach her a lesson for you and make her pay a terrible price. Don’t worry, after tonight, this person won’t be in the entertainment industry anymore.”

In the past, Qiao Mianmian would hesitate if Mo Yesi wanted to ban an artiste.

But this time, she didn’t feel anything.

“Mm, then ban her.” She said emotionlessly, “I really don’t want to see her in the entertainment industry anymore.”

What was different this time was that not only did Song Fei touch her, but she also dared to touch her fans.

Qiao Mianmian was also a protective person.

How could she tolerate such behavior?

Mo Yesi was shocked. “Baby, why are you…”

“She allowed her fans to bully my fans!” Qiao Mianmian was still very angry when she thought about this. She couldn’t help but complain to him. “Do you know how overboard her fans went? They actually created new accounts and used photos of my fans to post on Weibo to insult them. I’m not that angry about them spreading rumors about me, but I have to vent my fans’ anger no matter what.

“Song Fei knew what her fans were doing, but she didn’t stop them. If it wasn’t for her indulgence, her fans wouldn’t have gone overboard. Someone like her will lead children astray. It’s a good thing to ban her.”

Mo Yesi chuckled and said, “You’re really nice to your fans.”

“Of course, how could I not pamper my fans? They’ve done a lot for me,” Qiao Mianmian replied naturally.

“Mm, if you pamper your fans so much, what about your husband?” When he spoke again, the man’s tone was inevitably a little jealous. “When can you pamper your husband too? I think you care more about your fans than me.

“No matter how much they do for you, can they do more than me?”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

Why was he jealous?

This man was even jealous of her fans now?

“That’s different.”

“How is it different?”

“You’re my husband, they’re my fans.”

“So Hubby is worse than a fan?”

“…That’s not what I meant.”

“Then, tell me, when can you pamper me too?”

“…How do you want me to pamper you?”

“I don’t have any other requests. Tonight, you…” The man’s voice lowered until Qiao Mianmian couldn’t hear him.

But she heard everything clearly.

With a bang, her face turned red.

She bit her lip and touched her burning cheeks, cursing in her heart: Mo Yesi, this hooligan! Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

She knew that there was nothing else in his mind.

“Hmph, I won’t talk to you anymore. I’ve been out for too long, it’s time to return to the venue.” Qiao Mianmian avoided his request and pretended not to hear anything..
