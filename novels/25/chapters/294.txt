Chapter 295: Help Mr. Mo With His Necktie

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Mo Yesi was a little stunned by how at ease she was initially, but he soon broke into a discreet smile.

They walked into the living room.

Lei En brought him a necktie.

Previously, it had always been he who helped Mo Yesi tie his necktie.

He went forward with the necktie, ready to do what he usually did, when his Young Master suddenly put his hand out and said, “Hand it to me.”

Eh?

Lei En wondered if Young Master was going to do it himself this time?

Did he even know how to?

Right then, he saw his Young Master hand the necktie to Young Madam instead.

“Mrs. Mo.” Mo Yesi smiled attractively. “Help Mr. Mo with his necktie, mm?”

The way he called her “Mrs. Mo” got her heart pumping wildly.

She blushed as she held the necktie in her hand and mumbled, “I’m not too good at this too. Don’t despise me if I don’t do it well.

“Bring your head down a little, I can’t reach your neck.” She reached out, only to realize that she couldn’t reach him even when she tiptoed. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Mo Yesi lowered his head.

Qiao Mianmian put the necktie around his neck.

With his head lowered and her head tipped up, the distance between them had closed up.

Mo Yesi could smell the faint scent in her hair and on her.

He didn’t like girls who used too much perfume.

He found that the expensive perfumes always had an overwhelming scent, to the point of being unpleasant.

But the scent around her wasn’t overwhelming, it was light and sweet, like a flower or a peach.

He could never have enough of it.

When he held her close at night and took all of it in, it helped him fall asleep faster.

“Alright, done.” Qiao Mianmian took a small step back when she was done and looked up to see the result. She seemed satisfied.

Just as she was admiring her work, she couldn’t help but admire her husband at the same time. He really was one in a million.

Standing at 1.88m with those long legs... it was hard not to notice him already.

Not to mention that he had such a handsome face.

He really was the sort of person that looked good in any outfit.

To exaggerate it a little bit, if he were to wear rags, it could just turn into a new trend.

But Qiao Mianmian felt that he looked the best in formal wear.

A black top and black pants brought out his cool aura distinctly.

His straight tailored pants wrapped around his long, toned legs made him appear all the more classy and outstanding no matter where he was.

She felt that he was the sort of domineering Chairman they often wrote about in novels.

The man noticed that she was in a daze while looking at him and smiled at how awestruck she looked.

He pulled her in before she knew what was going on and kissed her on the cheek.

Qiao Mianmian widened her eyes and blushed once again.

There were others in the living room.

Besides Lei En, a few housemaids were standing around too.

He actually did this in front of so many people...
