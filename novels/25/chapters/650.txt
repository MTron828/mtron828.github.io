Chapter 652: He Doesn’t Like Her

Mo Yesi didn’t hang up immediately. “I regret it now.”

“... What do you regret?”

The man’s sigh seemed to stick to her ear.

“I regret being so understanding. I should be selfish and keep you by my side. That way, I can see you immediately when I miss you.”

“... ”

“That won’t do.” Knowing that he was joking, Qiao Mianmian joked. “That’s imprisonment, it’s illegal.”

“I’m willing to break the law for you.”

“... ”

“Um... Chairman Mo...” Wei Zheng’s weak voice sounded again. “Everyone is waiting for you.”

Mo Yesi suddenly sneered. “Wei Zheng, you’re a pretty good assistant.”

“Uh, Chairman Mo, I...”

“Baby, I’ll head to the meeting first. Be careful on the way, let me know when you’re there.”

“Alright.”

Knowing that he was busy, Qiao Mianmian didn’t say anything else and quickly hung up.

***

After taking their luggage, Qiao Mianmian and Nana took a cab to the hotel where the production crew was staying.

An hour later, they arrived at the hotel.

The so-called report was registration. The first day was just registration, and the official shoot would take place the next day.

Qiao Mianmian left rather early.

She was the first crew member to register.

While waiting for the elevator, she bumped into Tu Yilei.

The elevator door opened and Tu Yilei walked out. Before she could react, she heard Nana covering her mouth and screaming.

“Miss Qiao, we meet again.”

Tu Yilei saw her standing outside the elevator and greeted her.

Qiao Mianmian looked up and saw Tu Yilei’s handsome face. She was stunned for a few seconds before replying, “Tu, Senior Tu, hello...”

Tu Yilei was speechless.

“Didn’t I tell you that you don’t have to call me senior? We’re... about the same age. If you call me senior, I feel like I’m old.”

“But if I call you by your name, I’ll feel like I’m disrespecting you.”

“... ”

“How about I call you Mr. Tu?”

Tu Yilei was stunned for a moment before smiling helplessly. “... Whatever.”

“Little Tu Tu, it’s not early anymore. You still have to meet an advertiser later, hurry up and finish registering.” Tu Yilei’s manager glanced at Qiao Mianmian as if he was guarding against a thief. He then turned around and walked towards Tu Yilei, almost blocking him entirely.

Although his Little Tu said that she didn’t like this girl, he had to be careful.

This girl’s face... was too striking. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Even if Little Tu really didn’t like her now, he might like her in the future.

His Little Tu was on the rise.

He couldn’t be affected by love.

Even beautiful women couldn’t be allowed to have too much contact with Little Tu.

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

Tu Yilei’s manager didn’t seem to like her.

The last time, he was also afraid that she would use Tu Yilei as a publicity stunt, so he was very cautious of her.

This time...

Did she look like a scheming woman who liked to ride on others’ popularity?
