Chapter 2109: But It’s Still Different

This son-in-law was impeccable.

The only bad thing was that he looked cold and unapproachable.

Even though this man was his son-in-law, Father Qiao was still afraid.

He couldn’t put on airs in front of Mo Yesi.

“Father-in-law, you’re too polite. It’s only right.” Mo Yesi wouldn’t give Lin Huizhen face, but he still had to give Father Qiao face. Even though he didn’t really like Father Qiao, he still greeted him politely.

“Dad, this is a little gift from me.” Qiao Chen took out the gift he prepared for Father Qiao.

Father Qiao only realized that Qiao Chen was back when he heard his voice.

When his gaze landed on Qiao Chen, he was obviously shocked.

Father Qiao couldn’t remember the last time he saw him.

But the Qiao Chen back then was definitely different from now.

The young man in front of him didn’t look too good. His face was pale and he was still thin.

But it was still different.

He was clearly different from before.

Even though he looked a little sickly, his eyes and aura were different.

And his attire.

Qiao Chen was wearing a formal suit. Although the young man was slim, his 1.8m height was enough to support his clothes.

This was the first time Father Qiao saw Qiao Chen in such formal clothes.

The expensive suit seemed to make him nobler. He used to look weak and easy to bully, but now he looked like a rich young master.

Qiao Chen was wearing an expensive suit and a very expensive watch on his wrist.

But Father Qiao didn’t think too much about it.

He thought that either Qiao Mianmian or Mo Yesi bought it for him.

He also thought that Qiao Chen changed because of them.

Father Qiao didn’t know that the little boy he brought back from the orphanage was actually the Young Master of the Mo family.

His adopted son and daughter were extraordinary.

Father Qiao didn’t know that Qiao Chen was the flesh and blood of the Mo family.

Qiao Anxin and Lin Huizhen didn’t know, either.

“Dad, this is Chen Chen’s gift to you. Please accept it.”

Father Qiao stared at his adopted son in a daze for a while until he heard Qiao Mianmian’s reminder. He then snapped back to his senses and reached out to take the box from Qiao Chen.

He opened it and saw a bank card inside. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

He looked up in shock. “Chen Chen, what’s this?”

Qiao Chen smiled and said, “Dad, I earned some money. I don’t know what to buy for you. You can buy whatever you like. The password is your birthday.”

“You earned money?” Father Qiao took out the bank card and looked down at it with a shocked expression. “Where did you earn money? Aren’t you still in school? Where did you have the time to earn money?”

Qiao Chen didn’t elaborate. “I took some spare time to earn money.”

But the truth was that he earned money from signing a contract with Mo Xingshu when he went to the company to practice.

It wasn’t a big deal, but it was a lot of money for Qiao Chen.

This was the most money he’d earned since he was born.

The card he gave Father Mo had seven figures.
