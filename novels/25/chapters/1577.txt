Chapter 1579: You Guys Don’t Understand

“Boss Huang, come and have a drink.”

The woman looked at Boss Huang flirtatiously and fed him a glass of red wine. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

If it was any other time, Boss Huang would have already touched the woman in his arms.

But tonight, he didn’t seem interested in anything. He didn’t even look at the woman in his arms.

He pushed the red wine away and frowned.

The woman was stunned and looked at him in surprise.

“Boss Huang, what’s wrong with you?” After being stunned for a few seconds, the woman leaned over with a smile and pretended to feed him.

Boss Huang waved at the woman impatiently. “Go away, don’t bother me.”

“Hey, Boss Huang.”

A man sitting on the opposite sofa looked up and joked. “What’s wrong with you today? You’re not even interested in beauties anymore. This is the first time I see this.

“Could it be that because of the new beauty you recently got, other women have become vulgar in your eyes?”

“Boss Huang got a new beauty recently? Who is it? Why don’t I know?”

“You know that female celebrity. She used to be Young Master Su’s girlfriend.”

“You mean this woman? There’s nothing special about her. She’s just so pretty, how could she make Boss Huang so obsessed?”

“You don’t understand. It’s not necessarily because of looks. For men, as long as they’re good-looking, it’s the same even if they turn off the lights. Most importantly... Hahaha, you know.”

The crowd burst into laughter.

Boss Huang kept quiet.

In the past, he used to think that women were all the same. As long as they looked pleasing to the eye, it was the same even if they turned off the lights.

But now...

That exquisite face and that figure that he yearned for day and night appeared in his mind again. For the first time, Boss Huang felt that there was a huge difference whether she was pretty or not.

It was all nonsense.

How could it be the same?

This was the first time he’d seen such a beauty in the entertainment industry.

All the vulgar women he’d played with in the past added together weren’t even half as elegant as that beauty.

That beautiful face and fair skin.

If he could have such a beauty, even if it was only once, he would have no regrets in his life.

Ever since he saw that beauty, he had lost interest in other women.

Anyone would find it boring.

Even Qiao Anxin was thrown aside.

“You don’t understand.” Boss Huang sighed and looked at the laughing crowd. “When you meet such a beauty, you’ll know what it means to be vulgar.”

“Oh.” A man laughed. “What kind of beauty did Boss Huang meet to make you so smitten? If it’s the female celebrity who dated Young Master Su, her looks aren’t outstanding.”

“It’s not her.” Boss Huang sighed. “It’s her sister.”

“Sister? You mean the beauty you met is that female celebrity’s sister?”

“Mm.”

“Since you like her, then take her.”

These men were used to it and weren’t short of money. They felt that anything in this world could be solved with money.
