Chapter 923: Some Things Can’t Be Compared

The sweet and sour spare ribs were almost done twice, and the second time was only barely edible with Qiao Mianmian’s help.

When dinner was ready, Qiao Mianmian was really hungry.

In the end, she made four dishes and a soup.

One sweet and sour spare ribs, two steaks, and two dishes were all prepared by Qiao Mianmian alone.

Mo Yesi walked out of the kitchen in defeat.

No matter how unwilling he was to admit it, he had to admit that he wasn’t talented in cooking.

It seemed like a simple dish, but it wasn’t the case for him.

Even though he followed the recipe step by step, its appearance and taste were barely satisfactory. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

He almost set the kitchen on fire.

This was the first time he’d failed in his first try, and it was in front of Qiao Mianmian too. It was embarrassing.

After all, it was a very simple thing for him to say.

She didn’t expect him to slap his face so quickly.

He’d wanted to show off in front of his wife, but instead of doing well, he embarrassed himself in front of her.

Mo Yesi walked out of the kitchen silently, walked to the dining room, and sat down.

He looked at the two plates of ribs and steak on the table and saw that Qiao Mianmian was reaching for the ribs with her chopsticks. He hesitated for a while and grabbed her hand. “It’s better not to eat it. It’s already burnt, it won’t taste good, and it won’t be healthy to eat it. I’d better throw it out.”

“Don’t.” Qiao Mianmian slapped his hand away and placed the pork ribs into the bowl. “Isn’t this edible? Why are you throwing it away? It’s such a waste.”

Mo Yesi frowned. “But it’s burnt.”

“It’s not very burnt.” Qiao Mianmian looked at the black mess in the bowl and said against her conscience, “It just looks a little different. I tried it just now and it tastes pretty good.”

After all, this was the first meal Mo Yesi prepared for her.

A spoiled and pampered Young Master was willing to cook for her. No matter what he did, it was hard to come by his kindness.

She cherished it.

She thought about how she and Su Ze had known each other for so long and dated for two whole years. Everyone around her said that he treated her very well, but in the end, Su Ze never cooked for her.

Some things couldn’t be compared.

In comparison, she realized that the man she thought loved her deeply actually didn’t like her that much.

In the end, Su Ze’s affair with Qiao Anxin proved this point.

If a man loved you deeply and only had you in his heart, how could he be seduced by another woman?

Qiao Mianmian couldn’t help but frown at the thought of Su Ze.

The more she detested Su Ze, the more she felt that a man like Mo Yesi was too precious.

She was even more determined to be with him.

She would always stay by his side, no matter what happened.
