Chapter 1534: Yes, She’s Too Thick-skinned

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Lin Xiaoya, you and Qiao Chen are just classmates. I don’t think it’s up to you to decide for him.”

“You...” Lin Xiaoya’s expression darkened. She was about to flare up when she saw Qiao Chen standing beside her. She bit her lip and suppressed her anger.

“Don’t you have any self-awareness? Do you have to be told directly?” Lin Xiaoya used to be apprehensive and didn’t dare to speak to Shen Xin like this. But now that they knew there was a problem with the Shen Corporation, many people didn’t take Shen Xin seriously anymore.

Lin Xiaoya was one of them.

Seeing that Shen Xin was still as arrogant as before, she couldn’t help but mock her. “You’ve pestered Qiao Chen for three years, and you’re still saying that you won’t pester him? The so-called daughter of a rich family is actually so thick-skinned. Qiao Chen hasn’t said anything because he feels that we’re classmates and he doesn’t want to embarrass you.

“But you really don’t have any self-awareness.”

Shen Xin’s expression didn’t change. “I’ll say it again. Whether Qiao Chen wants to talk to me or not, he can tell me himself. You can’t decide for him. It’s none of your business if I pester him for a few years.

“I pestered Qiao Chen because he let me. If you’re jealous, you can do the same.”

“I’m jealous of you?” Lin Xiaoya laughed. “Shen Xin, you really said it. You’re so thick-skinned. Otherwise, why would you pester someone for three whole years?

“I’m not as shameless as you. You’ve already become the joke of the entire school.”

Shen Xin looked at her coldly.

Lin Xiaoya was a little flustered by her gaze, but then she recalled that the Shen family was about to go bankrupt. Shen Xin, the daughter of a rich family, wasn’t living as well as her. The next second, her eyes became sharp again as she straightened her back and glared at Shen Xin.

Shen Xin still looked calm, as if she wasn’t affected by Lin Xiaoya’s words.

In fact, she didn’t care what Lin Xiaoya said.

Too many people said that the Shen family was going down.

Shen Xin had seen all sorts of people recently.

She’d heard all sorts of nasty words.

She only cared about one person’s attitude.

And that person didn’t say a word.

He didn’t say a word, but this silence made Shen Xin feel as if her heart was stabbed.

Did he agree with what Lin Xiaoya said? Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Was it as Lin Xiaoya said, he didn’t want to embarrass her because they were classmates?

He was saving her face.

But she wasn’t tactful enough to make him say it.

He must find her annoying.

Even if he said that he never hated her, she felt that he did.

Yes, she was too thick-skinned.

She knew that he didn’t like her, but she still pestered him for three years.

Now, she was a joke in the eyes of everyone in school.

Everyone knew that Shen Xin had shamelessly pestered Qiao Chen for three years, but in the end, she was rejected.

So what if she was a rich young lady?

Some people even didn’t take her seriously.

And now that the Shen family was falling, she didn’t even have the status of a Young Lady anymore, so Qiao Chen wouldn’t take her seriously.

“Qiao Chen.” Shen Xin took a deep breath and looked at the young man’s back.
