Chapter 880: If You Want to Die, Let’s All Die Together

“You make it sound awful, but I feel awful too.”

Huang Yilin looked at her in shock. A few seconds later, her expression darkened. “Qiao Mianmian, does that mean you won’t let me off?”

Qiao Mianmian said coldly, “I want to let you off too, but I don’t want to let myself down.”

“Do you have to be so heartless?” Huang Yilin seemed to have been angered and lost control of her emotions. “You ruined my career and my life, and you’re satisfied with that? Qiao Mianmian, how could you be so cruel!”

“I’m cruel?” Qiao Mianmian found it funny. “Miss Huang, you should know that I won’t attack unless I’m attacked. Miss Huang and I originally had no enmity with each other, and it was all because of Miss Huang that we ended up like this today. If Miss Huang thinks I’m ruthless, then when you tried to destroy me, didn’t you think you were also ruthless?

“It’s just an eye for an eye.”

Huang Yilin clenched her teeth. “So, you won’t let me off no matter what, right?” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Qiao Mianmian smiled. “Miss Huang, you must be joking. It’s not that I don’t want to let you off, it’s just that you didn’t leave a way out for yourself. If you hadn’t done those things, no one would be able to dig them up. So, instead of saying that I won’t let you off, it’s better to say that you’ve harmed yourself.

“I have work to do later. Miss Huang, if there’s nothing else, I’ll excuse myself.”

With that, Qiao Mianmian turned to leave.

Huang Yilin looked at her back view and saw that she was about to leave. The last bit of hope in her heart was extinguished. Despair, anger, and hatred surged in her heart at the same time.

If Qiao Mianmian wasn’t willing to let her off, she wouldn’t even have a chance to make a comeback.

She would be thrown into the abyss of despair.

From now on, there was no turning back.

All her glory was gone.

She would become a joke to everyone, a pitiful creature in everyone’s eyes.

She would become a complete tragedy.

From now on, she would never see a ray of light in her life. She would be trapped in endless darkness forever.

She could imagine how terrible and hopeless this life was.

She couldn’t bear it even for a second.

Since Qiao Mianmian wanted to ruin her life and make her suffer for the rest of her life, she couldn’t let this slut live her life as she wished.

Her life was destined to be ruined.

Since she couldn’t escape death, she might as well drag someone down with her.

If she was going to die, they should all die together with her.

“Qiao Mianmian, you forced me to do this. If I can’t live a good life in the future, don’t even think about it. Didn’t you want to destroy me? Alright, then let’s destroy it together!” Huang Yilin clenched her teeth and took out a small blue bottle from her bag. She opened the cap and rushed towards Qiao Mianmian.

Her eyes were filled with hatred. “You want to destroy me, right? I begged you so much, but you wouldn’t let me go. You forced me to do this!”

By the time Qiao Mianmian reacted, Huang Yilin was already in front of her.

She splashed the liquid in the blue bottle at her face.

At that moment, Qiao Mianmian’s mind went blank, and she instinctively reached out to cover her face.

Someone was faster than her.

Just as Huang Yilin raised her hand to throw the liquid at her face, she was pushed away forcefully. The pain she imagined didn’t come, and she was pushed two steps back. Just as she moved her hand away, she heard a sharp scream.
