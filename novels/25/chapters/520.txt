Chapter 522: She’s Actually Never Lived in an Orphanage

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Qiao Mianmian?

Father Qiao furrowed his brows, rejecting them without a second thought. “No way, how could she possibly come up with such a sum?”

Qiao Anxin was fuming.

Father Qiao asked her to get the money from Su Ze.

But the moment she mentioned Qiao Mianmian, he said she wouldn’t be able to fork it out...

She sneered. “It seems like the only way is to sell the house, then.”

Lin Huizhen’s expression changed immediately. “Master, we can’t sell the house. Where will we live[? Just ask Mianmian for help. You’ve doted on her since she was a child, she can’t leave you in the lurch.”

Father Qiao kept quiet for a long while, then said, “I’ll think about it.”

With that, he left the ward.

Once Father Qiao was gone, Qiao Anxin grabbed Lin Huizhen’s hand and asked, “Mom, what were you and Dad talking about? Isn’t Qiao Mianmian... from the orphanage?”

Lin Huizhen hurriedly looked about in fear and rushed to close the door.

She then returned to Qiao Anxin’s bedside and whispered, “Not so loud, your dad can’t hear this.

“I don’t know the details. But even though he says that she was brought back from the orphanage, she actually never spent a day there.”

“What?!” Qiao Anxin was shocked. “She’s never been in the orphanage? Then, why did Dad...”

“Only because he had to keep a secret.”

Qiao Anxin tightened her grip as her heart raced. “What secret?”

Lin Huizhen shook her head. “Your dad keeps it very private, so I’m not very sure. He worked for someone else when he was younger, and his boss was very nice to him. His boss apparently even saved his life. After that, that man ran into some trouble and fled overseas, handing him a child to care for.”

“That child... is Qiao Mianmian?” Qiao Anxin tensed up.

“Mm.” Lin Huizhen nodded. “It’s her.”

“Why is it like this...” Qiao Anxin couldn’t accept it. “So, Qiao Chen isn’t from the orphanage too?”

“He is.” Lin Huizhen said, “Your dad favors boys. He brought Qiao Chen home only because he wanted someone to carry down the Qiao family bloodline.”

“Qiao Mianmian’s biological parents have never looked for her?” For some reason, Qiao Anxin had a feeling that Qiao Mianmian’s background wasn’t so ordinary. And that thought irked her.

“I guess not. They probably ran into some serious trouble back then, and perhaps, even after fleeing overseas... they never made it out alive? Otherwise, why would they be unconcerned about their daughter after a few decades?” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Never made it out alive?

So... they were dead?

Upon thinking of this possibility, Qiao Anxin felt comforted and happy.

So what if Qiao Mianmian’s biological parents were really big shots?

They were already dead, so she was still an orphan girl.

She finally smiled as she felt a weight being lifted off her chest.

Lin Huizhen didn’t know what she was thinking. All she was concerned about was Qiao Anxin’s relationship with Su Ze. “Anxin, what exactly happened between you and Ah Ze? Is he really going to break up with you?”
