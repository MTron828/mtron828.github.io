Chapter 504: I’ll Give You Whatever You Want, Alright?

Qiao Mianmian wasn’t willing to. She was already so embarrassed by calling him once. “No, I’ve already called you once.”

Mo Yesi lied. “You were too soft, I didn’t hear you.”

She was soft.

But he heard her clearly.

She sounded so gentle, so sweet, so alluring.

He thought about how he might really lose his mind if she called him Older Brother Yesi when they were doing “it.”

He would lose all control of himself.

“Baby, be good, just once more.” His deep, sexy voice was just by her ear. “Just once more. I’ll play the game for you and let you win over and over.

“I’ll use whichever hero you want. I’ll play in whichever position you want. Be good and call me Older Brother Yesi once more, and I’ll listen to you and give you whatever you want, alright?”

The man’s voice was so seductive.

His voice really found its way into her heart.

And her heart was practically shuddering.

Mo Yesi...

Was really doing all it took to get what he wanted.

Was he trying to seduce her?

If he was, he’d succeeded.

Because she could barely reject him.

Her mind was a whirl, and her heart was pounding furiously. Everything in her breath, her eyes, her mind, her ears, everywhere... it was all him.

He was all around her...

Almost like a thick mesh net that kept her in.

“Baby, mm?” The man exhaled in her ear, so warm but soothing.

Qiao Mianmian’s ear pricked up. It went red and warm. She knew that it was going to remain that way until she gave him what he wanted. “Older Brother Yesi.”

She glared at him right away after she said it, her cheeks a bright red. “Are you happy now?”

The man above her did not say anything for a while.

But she could feel his breath get even warmer.

And, he was looking at her at a specific spot. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

She looked up and was shocked by how his eyes were glowing.

And she could see a reflection of her flustered self in those eyes.

“Mo Yesi, you...”

Seeing the desire in his eyes and feeling his arm tighten around her waist, she quickly pushed him away.

But the very next moment, everything spun, and she landed on the couch.

“Baby.” His hoarse voice rang by her ear. He sounded firm and decisive as he said, “I want you.”

And with that, he immediately kissed her.

His strong, domineering kiss against her soft, tender lips. There was no way she could reject it.

...

An hour later, it finally ended.

Qiao Mianmian was exhausted and lying on the couch, drenched in sweat.

It took her a while to slowly ease out of that exhilaration.
