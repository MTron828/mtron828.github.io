Hence, not long after Qin Han posted this post, the public opinion about Qiao Mianmian changed. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“Damn, did you guys realize that Qin Han actually followed Qiao Mianmian? This must be the first newbie he followed, right? What does he mean by paying attention to Qiao Mianmian at this time? Is he trying to show his support for her?”

“Qiao Mianmian has been accused of being unfilial by her family, and Qin Han is still siding with her at this time. This is f*cking unfair.”

“I also think that Qin Han has bad values. He’s usually a good artiste, why is it that... it’s hard to explain.”

“It depends on his character at the crucial moment. Qin Han even supports such a woman. It seems like his character isn’t good!”

“You said that Brother Han has bad values. Come out and fight with me if you can. If I don’t beat you up, I’ll take your surname! It’s just an interview. Whatever that woman says is the truth. Just based on her mouth, you believe what she says? Then, doesn’t it mean that in the future, you don’t like anyone to casually spread rumors? You don’t even need evidence when you speak.”

“Damn, this is intolerable. How dare she scold our Qin Han! What do you mean by Qin Han’s character is terrible? You say that Qin Han can do anything, but I can’t help but laugh. Do you know how much Qin Han has to donate just to do charity a year? Do you know how many primary schools were built by him? Do you know how many poor children he helped to attend school? You don’t know anything, and you’re saying that his character is bad?”

“I believe Qin Han. If he’s really on Qiao Mianmian’s side, it means that he already knows the truth. When I watched the video today, I felt that that woman was full of lies. She kept blinking when she spoke. She was obviously guilty.”

“I believe Qin Han too! That woman must be trying to defame Qiao Mianmian on purpose. Isn’t she her stepmother? How many stepmothers are good to their stepdaughters? She just can’t stand Qiao Mianmian’s good life now and wants to ruin her. Her daughter was dumped by Su Ze and terminated her contract with Xinghan. I heard that she hasn’t even found a partner yet. Her own daughter isn’t doing well, and she doesn’t want her stepdaughter to do well. This woman is too evil and disgusting.”

“According to psychological analysis, Qiao Mianmian’s stepmother is most likely lying. Most of the time, eyes and body language can’t lie. Let’s not rush to stand on a side first and observe rationally. If the truth isn’t as that woman said, Qiao Mianmian will definitely take action later.”

“Haha, Qiao Mianmian still hasn’t come out to refute the rumors. Is it because she’s guilty? Because what her stepmother said is the truth, she doesn’t dare to refute it. If it’s not the truth, shouldn’t she be the first to clarify?”

“Stepmother? If that’s what my biological mother said, I think it’s pretty believable. As for my stepmother, the benevolent see the wise.”

“I also think that Qin Han knows the truth, so he came forward to help. But why isn’t Qiao Mianmian out yet? I’m so anxious.”

Qin Han had a huge fanbase.

Some artistes who were close to him also reposted his Weibo.

The fans of each artiste were also on their idol’s side, so there were actually many people speaking up for Qiao Mianmian.

Finally, it wasn’t a pathetic situation where everyone scolded her online.
