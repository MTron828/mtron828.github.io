Chapter 1572: I Thought of the Singer Immediately

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Even if we didn’t say it, you’d definitely insist on using her.”

They were well-known in the industry.

They were work buddies and friends.

After working together for so many years, they had some understanding of each other’s habits.

The director shrugged. “Am I that obvious?”

“It’s not that your performance is obvious, but that newbie’s performance is too good.” The scriptwriter immediately arranged a role for Qiao Mianmian. “I think the role of the female singer suits her. She’s so beautiful, talented, proud, and cold. She’s obviously a beauty, but she ended up in such a tragic state.

“Her performance just now reminded me of a singer.”

“Singer?” The director thought for a while.

The movie this time was a large-scale ancient martial arts drama. The singer was the second female lead in the movie, and she ended in tragedy.

Although the singer wasn’t the female lead, her role impacted the entire movie. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

She had many scenes.

Moreover, this role was more malleable and challenging than the female lead.

If she acted well, she would become famous.

If she didn’t act well, it would affect the entire movie.

The director never thought of giving such an important role to a newbie.

The newbie’s performance was indeed good. He felt that he should give her a chance.

But this was a huge movie.

Normally, they rarely used newbies. Even if they did, they wouldn’t let newbies play important roles.

The director wanted to give Qiao Mianmian a role that would allow her to show her face for a few minutes, such as the personal servant of the female lead.

Who knew that the scriptwriter actually wanted Qiao Mianmian to be the female singer.

The director knew how picky the scriptwriter was. She wrote the script herself, so she was even more careful when choosing actors.

The fact that she was willing to give Qiao Mianmian the second female lead role meant that she was really satisfied with the newbie.

The screenwriter had a lot of authority when it came to deciding whether the actors would stay or not.

The director kept quiet for a while and didn’t say anything. He then turned around and asked the producer, “Old Zhao, what do you think?”

“I don’t have any objections.” The producer spread his hands and smiled. “I think the young lady is not bad too. She has looks and acting skills. Other than her fame, she’s not inferior to those old people.

“It’s not like you haven’t used a newbie in an important role before. What’s there to be afraid of? I think this girl will definitely give us a lot of surprises.”

The director didn’t have any objections.

He thought for a while and nodded. “One of you will produce, and the other will tell the story. If you aren’t worried, what else do I have to worry about? Alright, then give her the role of the female singer. I hope she performs well and doesn’t disappoint us.”

This matter was settled.

...

On the other side.

Qiao Mianmian was sure that she wouldn’t be picked.

She didn’t think much of it.

Linda, on the other hand, was afraid that she’d be upset. After leaving the hotel, she continued to persuade her. “Mianmian, actually, it doesn’t mean anything that you didn’t get chosen today. It’s already good to be able to attend such an audition. It’s like a movie nomination. Very few people get an award on their first nomination. But isn’t being nominated a form of affirmation?”
