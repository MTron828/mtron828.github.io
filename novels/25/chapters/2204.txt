Their seats were next to each other.

After they were seated, the man smiled and asked, “Miss Shen, you’ve attended an auction before, right?”

Shen Rou was a little distracted. After a while, she replied, “Mm.”

The man asked again, “What’s Miss Shen interested in this auction? I think you women are more interested in jewelry or pretty ornaments.”

“As long as it’s something valuable, I’m interested.” Shen Rou didn’t want the man to see her as a superficial woman. Thus, she smiled and said, “I’ve done some research on paintings, jewelry, instruments, and antiques. I like them all.”

The man was stunned for a while before looking at her with admiration. “I didn’t expect for Miss Shen to be so learned. Miss Shen is indeed a daughter of a rich family and has extraordinary knowledge. The other women I know who are also participating in the auction aren’t interested in anything other than jewelry.”

Shen Rou smiled. “Girls usually like these things. It’s fine if they like jewelry.”

“That’s true.” The man immediately went along with her. “After all, jewelry is a more beautiful accessory for women. I heard that a few sets of jewelry are being auctioned tonight, one of which is Princess Eleena’s favorite necklace and earrings. I wonder if Miss Shen has heard of Princess Eleena?”

“The legendary princess consort who was so beautiful that the king fell in love with her at first sight and only married her in his life?”

“Yes, her.”

“I’ve read some of her biography,” Shen Rou said.

“Miss Shen, do you know about that set of jewelry?” the man asked.

Shen Rou smiled and nodded. “I’ve seen some biographies and photos of that set of jewelry. It’s indeed a very beautiful set of jewelry, but I’ve never seen the actual thing.”

“Then, we can see it tonight.” The man looked at Shen Rou’s expression and said, “Miss Shen, if you like that set of jewelry, have you considered taking it?”

“You don’t have to have everything you like.” Shen Rou’s eyes were calm, without much desire. “Moreover, it’s probably not cheap. There are so many competitors tonight, it’s not easy to get it.”

The man had already made up his mind.

Shen Rou wasn’t in the mood to continue chatting with him.

She looked up and saw Qiao Mianmian and Mo Yesi in the front row. Mo Yesi was holding Qiao Mianmian’s shoulder with one hand, gently combing Qiao Mianmian’s hair with his slender fingers.

Qiao Mianmian leaned in his arms and said something to him. He lowered his head to listen, and his side profile was full of gentleness and affection.

That gentleness and affection were like a stab to Shen Rou’s heart.

She clenched her fists.

If she had a knife in her hand now, she really wanted to stab Qiao Mianmian in the heart.

The man beside her saw her pale face and thought that she was unwell. He immediately showed his concern and asked, “Miss Shen, are you unwell? Do you need to see a doctor?”

“No, it’s nothing.” Shen Rou bit her lip and looked away.. She controlled her emotions and said, “Perhaps the cold air in the hall is too strong.”
