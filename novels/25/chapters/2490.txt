Chapter 2493: It Was Destined From the Start

“Mm,” Qiao Mianmian answered.

She hadn’t intended to post it now.

She planned to post all the evidence on Weibo to refute the rumors.

But seeing how worried Linda was, she wanted to comfort her first. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“You’re posting it now? What are you planning to post? Didn’t you say…”

“I haven’t gathered enough evidence yet. I’m not trying to clarify the rumors. I’m just informing the netizens.”

As Qiao Mianmian spoke, she posted on Weibo.

Qiao Mianmian V: [I’m sorry for causing so much trouble today. All the negative news are rumors. I’ll provide concrete evidence later. As for the person who spread the rumors, I’ll sue them. Don’t even think of escaping.]

After posting, Qiao Mianmian didn’t look at the netizens’ reactions and directly exited Weibo.

Linda was smart.

She quickly understood that Qiao Mianmian was doing this to reassure her.

Her heart warmed.

Given Qiao Mianmian’s current status, she actually couldn’t say anything to her.

She was Qiao Mianmian’s manager, but she couldn’t manage Qiao Mianmian the way she managed other artistes.

As the Madam of the Mo Corporation, even Huan Yu’s president had to curry favor with her.

Hence, Qiao Mianmian didn’t have to care about her feelings.

But she still took it into consideration.

Even though she was the daughter of the Bai family and the Madam of the Mo Corporation, she still treated her with respect.

She gave her enough face.

Thinking about Qiao Anxin…

She was just Su Ze’s girlfriend, but she still ordered her around.

She didn’t take her manager seriously at all.

Qiao Mianmian was way better than Qiao Anxin.

No wonder Qiao Anxin had to spend so much effort to get Su Ze.

And Qiao Mianmian easily won over such a good man.

The two sisters were on completely different levels.

Even if Qiao Mianmian wasn’t the daughter of the Bai family, Qiao Anxin was far inferior to her.

It was obvious that everyone’s fate was destined from the start.

It was because of Qiao Anxin that Qiao Mianmian got to know Mo Yesi.

Otherwise, she might have already married Su Ze.

And how could Su Ze compare to Mo Yesi? Even a hundred Su Zes couldn’t beat one Mo Yesi.

Moreover, Qiao Mianmian was actually the daughter of a rich family.

In terms of family background, the Su family was far inferior to the Bai family.

Thankfully, God was wise to let everything return to its rightful place.

He had already punished those who deserved it.

…

At the Shen Corporation.

Shen Rou was sitting in her office with the Weibo page displayed on her computer screen.

She browsed through the posts insulting Qiao Mianmian and even liked her own account.

“Qiao Mianmian is a green tea b*tch and a fake daughter. Who does she think she is? She might even be a fake daughter. She has no right to be compared to Shen Rou. Shen Rou is the real daughter of a rich family. Qiao Mianmian’s just a clown! She snatched someone else’s things by scheming. This person will get her retribution sooner or later. I believe she won’t be able to survive for long. Wait for her retribution. This person won’t have a good ending.”
