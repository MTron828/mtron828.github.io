Chapter 2780: Did I Do Something Wrong?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Yes, I didn’t like Jiang Xinyue at first, but I feel that she’s a little pitiful now. Zhan Bo is rather gentlemanly towards other female artistes. He’s too cold towards her.”

“Everyone says that Zhan Bo did that to stand up for his friend. They say he’s loyal, but I think he’s too much. Even if Jiang Xinyue took advantage to ride on Qiao Mianmian’s popularity, she didn’t offend him. He’s a senior and a man, but he treats a girl like this. He’s too uneducated and ungentlemanly!”

“I think I saw myself being ostracized. I think Zhan Bo went overboard, too. He shouldn’t be like this.”

“Brother isn’t usually like this. I think he’s like this because Qiao Mianmian said something to him. Sigh, my brother is a fool. He doesn’t know what is going on even after being used. He wanted to help her, but in the end, he’s the one being scolded and defamed.”

“I hope Brother will keep a distance from Qiao Mianmian! She’s a married woman, so her husband should be the one to stand up for her. Why does she keep getting Brother to help her do these thankless things?”

“That’s right, silly brother. Qiao Mianmian is already a married woman, why are you still standing up for her? Does anyone want to remind him not to be so silly anymore, or he’ll really be defamed.”

Seeing the comments popping up on the live stream, Zhan Bo’s fans were a little anxious.

They all told Zhan Bo to keep a distance from Qiao Mianmian and not stand up for her anymore.

Previously, the fans weren’t too against Zhan Bo and Qiao Mianmian’s friendship.

They were even happy about it.

Mainly because Qiao Mianmian was already married.

Moreover, Qiao Mianmian was the daughter of a rich family, and her husband was a super big shot. Zhan Bo and her becoming good friends was beneficial to his career development.

But now that Zhan Bo had negative news because of Qiao Mianmian, the fans couldn’t wait for him to cut ties with her.

Qiao Mianmian and Zhan Bo naturally didn’t know what was going on in the live stream.

Jiang Xinyue couldn’t maintain her smile anymore.

“S-Senior Zhan, did I do something wrong to offend you?” Jiang Xinyue bit her lip and looked aggrieved.

Zhan Bo frowned and was about to speak when Qiao Mianmian quickly tugged at his sleeve and said, “The restaurant’s name is Ma Xi’s Kitchen. Zhan Bo doesn’t think there’s anything to recommend it because that restaurant’s food is on the ordinary side and not very unique. Don’t overthink it, he doesn’t mean anything else.” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

As soon as Qiao Mianmian finished speaking, Jiang Xinyue turned to look at her.

The moment their eyes met, she felt a hint of coldness and hostility.

However, outwards, Jiang Xinyue sounded aggrieved. “Senior Qiao, is that true? Did I do something wrong to make you angry?”

Qiao Mianmian felt a sense of familiarity when she looked at her, but she still didn’t know where it came from.

She was sure that she had never seen Jiang Xinyue before.

But she felt a sense of familiarity when she looked at her.

It was as if… they knew each other.

Also, Zhan Bo said that Jiang Xinyue was hostile towards her.

Qiao Mianmian also felt it this time.
