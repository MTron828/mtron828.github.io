Chapter 1749: That’s Mo Yesi’s Father?

Tonight seemed like the right time.

Since they were already on this topic, Mo Yesi decided to tell her about that night.

He was about to say something when his cell phone rang.

Qiao Mianmian jumped off him and got him to answer the call.

Mo Yesi looked at her and hesitated for a few seconds before taking out his cell phone.

He picked it up immediately.

Qiao Mianmian’s expression changed when she saw that.

After he hung up, she quickly asked, “What’s wrong? Who called you? Is it something urgent?”

“Mianmian, we have to go to the hospital immediately.” Mo Yesi’s expression was a little serious, and there was even a hint of panic in his eyes. He held Qiao Mianmian’s hand and hurriedly walked back. “It’s Uncle Zhang. He said that Grandma accidentally fell from upstairs and is still unconscious.”

Qiao Mianmian was shocked. “Grandma fell from upstairs? How could this be?”

“In the past, she would get someone to support her when she went downstairs. I don’t know what happened today, but she didn’t call anyone and went down alone. Her legs were inconvenient, and she accidentally tripped while going down the stairs.

Qiao Mianmian could feel that Mo Yesi was very worried and afraid.

Because his hand was trembling. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Mo Yesi and Old Madam had a deep relationship. Now that Old Madam was unconscious, no matter how calm he looked, he would definitely be worried and afraid.

Even Qiao Mianmian was worried.

Old Madam treated her well. After what happened, she was afraid something would happen to Old Madam.

She held Mo Yesi’s hand tightly. “Then let’s go to the hospital. I believe Grandma will be fine. She’s such a good person, God will definitely protect her.”

...

Mo Yesi and Qiao Mianmian rushed to the hospital.

After getting out of the car, the two of them ran to the inpatient department and arrived at the VIP ward where Old Madam was staying. Uncle Zhang was waiting for them outside.

Seeing Qiao Mianmian and Mo Yesi, Uncle Zhang went forward and said, “Second Young Master, Second Young Madam.”

Mo Yesi asked anxiously, “How’s Grandma?”

“Old Madam hasn’t woken up yet. But the doctor said that her life isn’t in danger. Second Young Master and Second Young Madam don’t have to worry too much.”

Qiao Mianmian heaved a sigh of relief.

No matter what, it was best if her life wasn’t in danger.

Mo Yesi seemed more at ease now.

He led Qiao Mianmian into the ward.

Qiao Mianmian saw two people standing by the bed.

One was Madam Mo, and the other was a stranger.

The man she’d never seen before looked a little like Mo Yesi. He was in his forties, and he exuded elegance and charisma.

Just as Qiao Mianmian was guessing his identity, she heard Mo Yesi call out, “Dad, when did you come back?”

Qiao Mianmian looked at the middle-aged man in shock.

That was Mo Yesi’s father?

That was her father-in-law?

This was the first time Qiao Mianmian saw her “legendary” father-in-law, Mo Yunchen, after she married Mo Yesi.

Qiao Mianmian knew that Mo Yunchen wasn’t old. After all, Mo Yesi was only in his twenties.
