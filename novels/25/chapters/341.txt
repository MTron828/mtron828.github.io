Chapter 342: Mo Corporation, Mo Yesi

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

That man went by the surname Mo too.

He was also extraordinarily good-looking and appeared young.

He’d driven a black Rolls Royce that day, with a plate number that Su Ze could find nothing about even after employing all his resources.

This man even managed to make Sheng Hui Corporation go bankrupt overnight.

The more Su Ze thought about the possibility, the more shocked he became. Soon, he broke out in cold sweat.

“Chairman Su, what’s the matter? Are you unwell?” Director Zhang had just given it another shot on the course when he noticed Su Ze’s paleness.

Su Ze was in a daze.

He was shocked by his own thoughts and speculations.

Upon second thought, however, it seemed unlikely.

Everyone knew that the newly appointed Chairman of the Mo Corporation was never seen with a woman. The only woman to ever have appeared close to him was Young Lady Shen.

So, there was no way Qiao Mianmian could be with him.

This thought brought Su Ze huge relief. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Regaining color on his cheeks, he wiped the sweat off his palms. He picked up the club again and walked towards Director Zhang. “It’s nothing, just some gastric discomfort. I’m fine now.”

Director Zhang nodded and said some kind words, then continued golfing.

About two hours later, Su Ze and Director Zhang signed an agreement and drew their golf game to a close.

He stood at the entrance and saw Director Zhang get into his Jaguar before turning to leave.

Just as he turned around, a black figure approached him.

His expression changed slightly as he stopped in his tracks.

It was him.

The man at the private clubhouse.

Su Ze looked in shock at the man whom he’d tried to arrange an appointment with countless times but with no success. This man in black was walking in front while Chairman Chen politely followed behind.

One of them looked like the master while the other looked like the slave.

And the one who looked like the slave was Chairman Chen.

This scene shocked Su Ze.

The Chen Firm was very well established in Yuncheng City.

The Su family had to plead with them a few times too.

He even had to politely address Chairman Chen as Uncle Chen whenever he saw him.

“Eh, isn’t that Young Master Su?” Chairman Chen looked up, saw him, and proceeded to greet him.

Only then did Su Ze snap out of his daze. “Uncle Chen.”

“Xiao Su, you’re here for an appointment too?”

Chairman Chen and Su Ze’s father were rather close, so it was only natural for him to show some concern about Su Ze.

Su Ze looked at Mo Yesi’s cold expression and nodded. “Mm. Uncle Chen is here to discuss a dealing too? Beside Uncle Chen here is...”

A strange surge of fury rose in Su Ze the moment he thought of this man’s relationship with Qiao Mianmian.

When he looked at Mo Yesi, it was with a trace of rivalry.

As if he was looking at his love rival.

Chairman Chen hadn’t intended to speak for so long, for fear that the man beside him would be upset or annoyed. He’d planned to just ask a word of concern out of formality’s sake and then leave, but the man beside him took the initiative to answer Su Ze. “Mo Corporation, Mo Yesi.”

Su Ze’s head snapped up in astonishment.

“You’re from the Mo Corporation?”

Mo Yesi smiled. “Yes.”

He casually slipped his hands into his pockets, appearing prim and proper but at ease.

His presence and aura were impossible to ignore.
