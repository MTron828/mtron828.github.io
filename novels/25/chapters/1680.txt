Chapter 1683: Did She Look for You in Private?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Mm, ask away.” He stopped and turned to look at the girl beside him.

Jiang Luoli looked at him and said, “What do you think if I say we get married now?”

“Marry now?”

“Mm, now.”

Mo Shixiu didn’t answer immediately. He thought for a while before saying, “Maybe not now.”

Jiang Luoli was shocked.

Although she didn’t intend to get married at such a young age, Mo Shixiu’s rejection still upset her.

She was stunned for a few seconds before asking slowly, “Why? Is it because you don’t want to get married?”

“No, if you want to get married, I have no problem.”

“But you said no...”

“I said no because I can’t get married to you right now. I have to go back as soon as possible,” Mo Shixiu answered her question seriously. He paused and continued, “But if you’re really anxious, there’s a way.”

Jiang Luoli was speechless.

So that was what he meant! Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

She’d misunderstood him just now, thinking that he wasn’t willing!

She immediately felt better.

Regardless of whether she was willing to get married now, Mo Shixiu’s attitude satisfied her.

“There’s no rush.” She pursed her lips and smiled. “I said I was just asking.”

Stunned, Mo Shixiu raised an eyebrow. “Just asking?”

“Mm.” Jiang Luoli nodded. “I don’t intend to get married so soon. We haven’t been together for long, it’s too early to get married. Moreover...”

She looked at him and hesitated.

“Moreover?” Mo Shixiu asked.

Jiang Luoli hesitated for a while before saying, “Moreover, your mom definitely won’t agree to me marrying you. She’ll definitely object to our marriage.”

“My mom?” Mo Shixiu was silent for a few seconds. “Luoli, I’m not a child anymore. I’ve been an adult for a long time. I make my own decisions. Even my mom can’t control who I want to marry in the future.

“Whether she agrees or not, it won’t affect my decision.”

In other words, no one could control him if he wanted to marry her.

“Then, what if...” Jiang Luoli hesitated. Should she tell Mo Shixiu what Madam Mo did to her? She hesitated for a few seconds and looked straight into his cold and dark eyes. “If I told you that your mom did something bad to me to stop us from being together, will you believe me?”

Mo Shixiu was stunned. Then, his expression became a little serious.

“Does the previous incident have anything to do with my mom?” Mo Shixiu had someone investigate and knew that Jiang Hai owed someone money because someone set him up.

Now that Jiang Luoli mentioned it, he quickly guessed it.

After all, Madam Mo had been against him being with Jiang Luoli from the start.

Jiang Luoli kept quiet.

Mo Shixiu knew the answer.

He narrowed his eyes and his expression darkened. “What exactly happened? What did my mom do to you? Did she look for you in private?”

Jiang Luoli looked at him and said, “Mm, she looked for me before. She offered me 10 million yuan to leave you.”
