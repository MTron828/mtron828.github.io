Chapter 375: Have We Met Before?

At this point, Qiao Mianmian just wanted to leave as soon as possible.

She knew that Gong Zeli was still watching her.

She was just pretending not to notice it.

“Alright, Miss.”

The employee sighed in relief when she heard that.

Fortunately, there were other colors for this model.

Otherwise, it’d be terrible if the two customers ended up arguing over it.

Young Master Gong wasn’t one to be trifled with.

Meanwhile, the man with the other customer seemed to be of a rather high status too. They couldn’t offend him, either.

This was the best outcome they could get.

“Miss Lin, Young Master Gong, please hold on for a moment. I’ll get the bag wrapped immediately.” The employee picked up the bag the Qiao Mianmian had just released and went to the counter to wrap it up.

Lin Fei’er wasn’t really surprised by this. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Her focus was no longer on the bag.

She noticed that Gong Zeli’s eyes had been on that little slut for the longest time, and she was starting to feel threatened by her presence.

She knew very well what it meant when a man looked at a woman this way for this long.

If she stayed on any longer, Young Master Gong would be seduced by that little slut.

“Hurry.” Lin Fei’er rushed the employee. “Go a little faster, we’re in a rush.”

“Yes, Miss Lin.”

The employee dared not waste a moment.

Meanwhile, the other employee took the red bag to wrap it up at the counter too.

“Hold on.”

Gong Zeli suddenly said, “I think the red bag is nice too. Wrap that up for me.”

The employee was stunned. “The red one? But Young Master Gong, the other lady has settled on this.”

Lin Fei’er was shocked too. She looked up at the man beside her. “Young Master Gong, it’s the black bag that I want.”

Gong Zeli simply said, “Red suits you better.”

Lin Fei’er stammered, “B-But...”

She’d just uttered that word when the man went cold. He eyed her a little fiercely. “Why, you don’t like red?”

Lin Fei’er was shocked by his glare and felt her throat tighten. “No, I-I...”

She couldn’t even speak.

Gong Zeli shot her a colder glance and then looked up at Qiao Mianmian. He said coldly to the employee, “What are you waiting for, didn’t you hear what I said?”

Gong Zeli was a distinguished figure. He was the only son of the Gong family, one of the four powerhouses in Yuncheng City.

The Gong family had shares in this mall itself.

The employees knew him and dared not offend him one bit.

The employee looked at him and then turned towards Qiao Mianmian with a sorry expression. “Miss, would you... like to take a look at other colors? Black and jade green look very good too. You...”

The employee dared not offend Gong Zeli, so the best option now was to persuade Qiao Mianmian to give up on the wine red bag.

But this time, Qiao Mianmian wasn’t intending to give in anymore.

She could tell that Gong Zeli was doing this on purpose.

Upon thinking about the insults and humiliation Gong Zeli had targeted at her, and the strange sense of enmity since their first meeting, Qiao Mianmian felt a wave of anger. She clenched her teeth and said, “Gong Zeli, have we met before?”

Lin Fei’er’s expression darkened when she heard her address Gong Zeli by name.

She knew it. This little slut was here to seduce Young Master Gong.

This was indeed the case.
