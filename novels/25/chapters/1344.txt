Chapter 1347: Do What You Like

This time, Madam Bai heard it clearly.

She was sure that Qiao Mianmian really called her “Mom”.

“Mianmian, you...” This surprise came too suddenly. Madam Bai was stunned for a while, and her eyes instantly reddened.

Her voice was trembling. “W-What did you just call me? Did I hear wrongly?”

“Yusheng, did I hear wrongly? Mianmian called me Mom just now?” Madam Bai looked at Bai Yusheng with reddened eyes and grabbed his arm. She was too agitated and happy. Not only was her voice trembling, but her entire body was trembling as well. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

She thought that she would have to wait a long time for this day.

This sudden surprise made her so happy.

“Mom, you didn’t hear wrongly.” Bai Yusheng slowly recovered from his shock. He actually felt the same as Madam Bai, but he wasn’t as obvious.

He was also surprised that Qiao Mianmian was willing to change her mind.

He also thought that it would take a while for her to change her mind.

“Mianmian, I’m so happy.” Madam Bai cried tears of joy. She held Qiao Mianmian’s hand and said tearfully, “I dreamed of when you’d call me Mom. I didn’t expect my wish to come true so quickly.

“I’m so happy.”

She smiled as she cried. “So, you’ve acknowledged me as your mother and are willing to return to the Bai family?”

Qiao Mianmian looked at Madam Bai’s teary face and hesitated for a while before wiping her tears. “Mom, don’t cry. I’m your daughter, a member of the Bai family. I never said I wasn’t willing to return.

“I’m just not used to it yet.”

“I understand, I understand.” Madam Bai immediately held her hand tightly. Her voice was still choked, but her face was full of smiles. “Mianmian, use whatever method you like to spend time with us.

“As long as you’re willing to go home, you can do whatever you want.

“Your brother and I will do as you say.”

Qiao Mianmian thought for a while and said hesitantly, “Mom, the Qiao family does owe me a favor. If it wasn’t for my adoptive parents, I wouldn’t be here today. So, should I tell my family about returning to the Bai family?

“Also, even if I return to the Bai family in the future, Dad will always be my kin. Although he isn’t related to me by blood, he raised me. I have to repay him for raising me.”

Qiao Mianmian detested Lin Huizhen and Qiao Anxin.

But Father Qiao had always treated her well.

Although she had a conflict with Father Qiao, and they hadn’t contacted each other for a long time.

But she was still worried when she heard that Father Qiao was sick.

Father Qiao’s health hadn’t been good all these years.

Qiao Mianmian thought that she had to take the time to visit him.

“Of course.” Madam Bai immediately said, “The Qiao family has not only raised you, but also our Bai family. It’s all thanks to the Qiao family that our family can reunite now.

“The Qiao family raised my daughter painstakingly. I’ll always remember this favor. Don’t worry, I’ll definitely repay your adoptive father.

“I think we should find a time to meet up and discuss this. Mianmian, don’t worry, we won’t stop you from acknowledging your adoptive father just because you’ve returned to the Bai family.”
