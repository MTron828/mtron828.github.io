Chapter 2229: And Qiao Mianmian Is Such a Person

Linda didn’t try to persuade her further. “Let’s talk about singing in the future. You don’t have anything else to do next, so you should rest well for this period. The shoot for ‘Phoenix in Flight’ will start next month, so make the necessary preparations.”

Linda couldn’t discipline Qiao Mianmian like she did the other artistes.

Everything was up to her.

Moreover, many of Qiao Mianmian’s resources were found by herself. Linda felt that she could manage everything by herself.

The daughter of the Bai family and the Young Madam of the Mo family, what kind of resources couldn’t she get?

Moreover, Qiao Mianmian was capable.

Whether it was in terms of appearance, acting, or even singing, there was nothing to say.

Once such a person had good resources, it was hard not to be popular.

Hence, she didn’t have to worry too much about her.

“Mianmian, I really didn’t expect you to be the singer. Not only are you talented in acting, but you’re also talented in singing. Work hard, I have high hopes for your future. I hope you’ll be nominated for the Best Newcomer Award.”

Qin Han’s voice came from behind.

When Qiao Mianmian turned around, Qin Han had just walked behind her.

He smiled and sighed. “The new generation surpasses the old. Your generation is getting better and better.” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

She looked at Qin Han’s young and handsome face and smiled. “Brother Han, you’re only a few years older than me. We’re from the same generation. If we’re talking about being good, you’re the best.”

Qin Han shook his head. “I didn’t have such results at your age. In terms of talent, I also lose to you. Mianmian, we’re different. Your future results will definitely be better than mine.

“I work hard, you have talent. Talent is always more useful than hard work.”

Qin Han wasn’t being humble.

Although he had already won a few Best Actor Awards, he knew very well that there was still a gap between him and talented actors.

He relied on hard work.

Anyone with talent in acting would definitely surpass him.

And Qiao Mianmian was such a person.

She was talented, hardworking, and willing to listen to advice. Moreover, she definitely didn’t lack good resources now.

Being popular was just around the corner.

Qin Han had a premonition that Qiao Mianmian would become popular overnight with this drama.

In fact, she might even win some honorary awards.

Because Qiao Mianmian was too good.

As long as the drama was released, no one would defame her acting anymore.

Qin Han felt a little pressured to have such an outstanding junior in the same profession as him, but he felt comforted.

The entertainment industry needed fresh blood.

It needed someone as outstanding as Qiao Mianmian.

Qin Han was even glad that Qiao Mianmian loved acting.

Otherwise, with her qualifications, she wouldn’t be in the entertainment industry.

He was also glad that Qiao Mianmian wasn’t playing around.

Otherwise, it would be a waste of her talent.
