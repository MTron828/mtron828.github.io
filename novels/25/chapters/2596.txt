Chapter 2597: Assimilated By Him

“Why are you looking at me like that?” Qiao Mianmian looked up and blinked.

“I just feel that you’re a little different now.”

“How am I different?”

“If this was in the past, you would have pleaded for her and asked me to let her off.” Mo Yesi placed a hand on the top of her head and massaged it.

This time, it was Qiao Mianmian who was stunned for a few seconds.

“Was I so soft-hearted before?”

“Mm.” Mo Yesi’s slender fingers pressed against her scalp gently. The force was very suitable. “Don’t you know what you used to be like?”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

Alright. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

She recalled that she used to be soft-hearted.

If it was the old her, she might have really asked Mo Yesi not to be too ruthless and let Little Xiao off.

Perhaps she’d been with Mo Yesi for too long.

She was slowly being assimilated by him.

She really didn’t think Mo Yesi was that cruel.

He had no sympathy for Little Xiao.

She wouldn’t feel that Mo Yesi was wrong and pity Little Xiao.

There was a saying: “A pitiful person is hateful.”

She wouldn’t take the initiative to cause trouble, much less harm anyone.

But if someone wanted to frame her behind her back, it would be disadvantageous to her.

She wouldn’t be merciful now.

She understood that her kindness wouldn’t earn her gratitude, and it wouldn’t stop people from attacking her.

“Then, do you think I’m better now? Do you think I’ve become cruel?”

“What kind of silly question is that? Of course not. It’s good that you’re like this now. I like you more now. This way, you won’t be at a disadvantage and won’t be easily schemed against. I’m more at ease now.”

“You mean you were worried about me before?”

“You used to make me worry.” Mo Yesi smiled and said, “You grew up with Chen Chen, but compared to him, you’re not as decisive and ruthless as him. As long as you have half of Chen Chen’s means, I don’t have to worry about you anymore.”

“Chen Chen?” Qiao Mianmian was stunned. “You said Chen Chen is ruthless? Are you sure you didn’t say anything wrong?”

“Of course not. Why? In your eyes, what do you think of Chen Chen? Do you still think he’s an innocent little boy? In front of you, he’s definitely obedient and sensible. He’s your obedient little brother.

“But this doesn’t mean that he’s like this in front of others. But fortunately, Chen Chen can be ruthless when the time calls for it. He’s going to take over Second Uncle’s company in the future. If he isn’t ruthless, he’ll be eaten up sooner or later.”

Qiao Mianmian sighed as she thought about Qiao Chen.

“Why are you sighing?” Mo Yesi asked.

“I just suddenly thought about Chen Chen and Shen Xin. Although Shen Rou’s car accident wasn’t caused by us, it has something to do with us. Moreover, you bought over the Shen Corporation. The Shen family probably hates us to the core now.”

Qiao Mianmian felt a headache coming on.

“In the past, they objected to Shen Xin and Chen Chen’s relationship.. Now… I’m afraid it’s even more impossible for them to interact.”
