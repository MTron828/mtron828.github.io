Chapter 120: She Started It

But it was obvious at first glance that Bai Xiao and Zhang Yuwei had it worse. Their faces were full of scratches and their hair was a mess.

Qiao Mianmian just had a scratch on her neck but was otherwise unscathed.

In terms of fighting, Bai Xiao and Zhang Yuwei were not her match.

If the attendant hadn’t arrived in time, Qiao Mianmian would have given them a greater beating.

“Counselor, it was Jiang Luoli who started this trouble.” Bai Xiao touched the stinging wounds on her face. “She was telling us off, and she was the one who got rough first. I couldn’t possibly just sit back and let her beat me up, right?” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“You’re talking crap!” Jiang Luoli glared at her angrily. “Did I say anything about you? You were the one feeling guilty and thinking I was referring to you. And stop lying through your teeth, you were the one who started saying all the mean stuff first. If you hadn’t made things sound so awful, would I have felt like hitting you? You simply deserve to be beaten.”

“Counselor, you heard that.” Bai Xiao’s expression hardened. “She started it.”

“That’s because your foul mouth deserves a beating!”

“Jiang Luoli, you...”

“Alright, stop arguing! This isn’t the time for you to still be fighting!” The counselor was getting frustrated at them.

He took a deep breath to calm himself before saying expressionlessly, “Jiang Luoli, in that case, you were really the one who got rough first?”

“It was me.” Jiang Luoli tipped her chin up.

She dared to admit her mistakes.

“Alright, since you started this, then you’ve got to bear the most blame.” The counselor sounded strict. “In any case, you should never hit your schoolmates. That’s terrible behavior.”

“Counselor, I...”

“That’s it, I don’t want to hear any more explanations. You’re going to run three rounds on the track right now. When you’re done, do up a 1000-word reflection and hand it to me.”

“As for the rest of you...” The counselor looked at the three of them. “She’s in the wrong, but so are you. Go back, reflect on your actions, and hand in a reflection each tomorrow.

“Alright, you can all leave now.”

Jiang Luoli was fuming. “Counselor, why don’t Bai Xiao and Zhang Yuwei need to run around the track too?”

The counselor side-eyed her. “You’re the main culprit. If you don’t find this fair, I can add two more rounds to your punishment.”

Jiang Luoli was speechless.

Bai Xiao and Zhang Yuwei looked smug.

One round around the track was bad enough.

Three rounds would kill her.

Served Jiang Luoli right for doing this to them.

But the thought of Qiao Mianmian receiving the same punishment as them annoyed them.

It was actually Qiao Mianmian who really upset them, not Jiang Luoli.

But they couldn’t influence the counselor’s decision.

They simply glanced at Jiang Luoli with gloating looks and then walked off.

Qiao Mianmian did not leave. She looked at Jiang Luoli and then said, “Counselor, I’m willing to receive the same punishment as Luo Luo. I’ll run three rounds around the track too.”

Jiang Luoli was stunned for a moment before she frowned. “Baby, why are you doing this. Go back first.”

“I’ll accompany you.” Qiao Mianmian grabbed her hand and looked at her firmly. “I won’t go back on my own. It’s just three rounds around the track, I’ll just take it as exercise.”
