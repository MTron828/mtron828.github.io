Chapter 1365: Qiao Anxin Exposed Her Scandal

Qiao Anxin’s Weibo used to be managed by a professional team.

Ever since she terminated her contract with Star Splendor, there was no longer a team to manage her Weibo.

It took more than half an hour for someone to call her and ask her what was going on.

...

Qiao Anxin didn’t know what was going on when she received the call.

The other party didn’t tell her what was going on and only told her to quickly go on Weibo.

After hanging up, she immediately logged into Weibo.

When she saw the Weibo post with her account, her eyes widened in shock.

Qiao Anxin V: [Ze, I don’t regret loving you. I’ll remember everything that happened between us for the rest of my life.]

The attached photos were of them before he and Qiao Mianmian broke up.

Every photo was taken clearly.

Qiao Anxin looked at the post in disbelief.

She definitely didn’t post it.

As long as she wasn’t crazy, she wouldn’t expose her scandal like this.

Qiao Anxin’s first reaction was that someone had stolen her Weibo account.

But if it was just stealing her Weibo, where did those photos come from?

She had already deleted those photos.

Besides her, no one else would have them.

But if no one else did, how did the photo get sent?

It had only been half an hour since the post was first posted, but the number of comments and reposts had already exceeded 100,000.

And the numbers were increasing rapidly.

# Qiao Anxin’s self-explosion scandal # was trending.

The netizens commented.

“This is the first time I’ve seen an artiste expose herself. Is Qiao Anxin crazy?”

“Qiao Anxin really cheated on him. This proves that Qiao Mianmian is right. Su Ze and her are really not the same. One cheated on his girlfriend’s sister, while the other is an unfaithful sister-in-law. Even a rabbit doesn’t eat the grass by its nest. They’re worse than animals.”

“I don’t care if these photos were sent by Qiao Anxin herself. She indeed cheated on her. I had a good impression of her previously, but now, my worldview has been ruined. There are so many men in the world, who can’t be with them, but she eyed her sister’s man? To be honest, if I had such a sister, I would definitely cut off all ties and never interact with her again. No, I have to tell the world about her scandals and let everyone know how shameless she is.”

“No wonder Qiao Mianmian was still a walk-on actor when she was dating Su Ze. She didn’t even have any good resources. Qiao Anxin, on the other hand, was highly supported by Star Splendor and could easily get all sorts of good resources. It turns out that this pair of scumbag and slut had already secretly gotten together.”

“Damn it, I’m going to puke. From today onwards, I’ll turn against Qiao Anxin!”

“Although I’m Qiao Anxin’s fan, I’m not a brainless fan. Some principles can’t be discussed. I’ll stop being a fan.” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“+1”

“I’m a fan too. This happened to me before. It was so disgusting that I couldn’t eat or sleep well that year. When I closed my eyes, every time I saw that scumbag and slut, I was disgusted. The thing I hate the most in this life is being betrayed by someone you think is very close to you. This pain is something I’ll never forget.”

“I was cheated on by my best friend. I was so disgusted back then. Her sister... must be even more disgusted.”

Almost all the trending topics were scolding Qiao Anxin.

Qiao Anxin’s fans immediately shut up.
