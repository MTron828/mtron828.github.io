Bai Xiao was surfing online. She slammed her mouse on the table and glared at Jiang Luoli.

Zhang Yuwei was on the same side as her and coldly said, “Jiang Luoli, were you insulting Bai Xiao and me indirectly? You’d better make yourself clear. Who are you calling shameless?”

“Why, are you picking a fight with me?” Jiang Luoli had always been the happy-go-lucky sort of person who hardly feared anyone. She scoffed at Bai Xiao. “I didn’t mention your names once. Why are you both being so sensitive and thinking I’m referring to you? Or did I accidentally nail it on the head, shattering your fragile hearts?”

“You didn’t mention a damn word, but do you think we’re so foolish as to not know what you’re trying to get at?” Bai Xiao clenched her teeth. “You’re just a lackey, what right have you to talk about us like that. No matter what, we’re a hundred times better than a lackey like you.

“You’re talking about your Prince Charming all the time, do you think he even cares about you? I think you’re the shameless one here. You used to try and seduce Su Ze too, but now that he isn’t interested, have you changed your target?

“Haha.” Bai Xiao sized her up and looked at her condescendingly. “I advise you to give it up. Even Su Ze wasn’t attracted by you, this Prince Charming is out of the question.”

With that, they looked at Qiao Mianmian with a mocking expression. “Qiao Mianmian, I suggest you be less careless and watch out for your good friend. She’s more scheming than she looks. You’d better not regret it when your man leaves you all of a sudden.”

“Bai Xiao, shut your damn mouth!”

Jiang Luoli waved a fist at Bai Xiao the moment she said it.

She had always been the impulsive sort and was barely able to tolerate what Bai Xiao was saying about her.

Bai Xiao saw her approaching and rolled up her sleeves as well. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

They immediately started fighting.

Jiang Luoli wasn’t as strong as Bai Xiao and was quickly pinned down by her. She grabbed Bai Xiao’s hair, and Bai Xiao did the same to her.

They were both in pain.

Seeing that Jiang Luoli didn’t have the upper hand, Qiao Mianmian couldn’t simply watch on.

Jiang Luoli had gotten into a conflict with Bai Xiao because of her.

“Bai Xiao, stop it!” Qiao Mianmian was angry and anxious when she saw the scratch mark on Jiang Luoli’s face. She clenched her fist as well.

Zhang Yuwei realized that Qiao Mianmian was going to offer help and decided to join Bai Xiao’s team too.

The two-woman fight now involved four...

Chaos filled their room.

...

Half an hour later.

The fight among the four of them alerted the attendant and the counselor.

“You girls really have got some guts! You’re actually fighting here instead of turning in for the night! Are you turning defiant!”

The counselor looked at them furiously.

“Tell me, who started this?! You’d better stand forward!”

The way the counselor yelled scared Qiao Mianmian and Jiang Luoli.

Meanwhile, Bai Xiao and Zhang Yuwei looked indignant.

The fight had left each of them in wounds and bruises.
