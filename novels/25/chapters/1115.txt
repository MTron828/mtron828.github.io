Chapter 1116: Full of Her

“Mianmian, I think if CEO Mo was the one who fought for the resources for you, you should take it. It’s not that easy to get an endorsement for MC. You don’t know how many companies are fighting for it. CEO Mo has put in a lot of effort to help you get this resource, so you shouldn’t reject him, right?”

Linda was afraid that Qiao Mianmian would reject such a good advertising resource to prove herself. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

She didn’t care who gave her the resources.

Qiao Mianmian was an artiste under her. She couldn’t wait for Mo Yesi to find more resources for Qiao Mianmian to make her famous.

That would save her a lot of trouble.

“Also, MC has very high requirements for the artists they work with. Even if they come to you now, if your performance is unsatisfactory, they will still terminate the contract with you. So, it’s not like you can secure this endorsement just because of President Mo.

“The rest depends on your performance.”

Qiao Mianmian still felt that Mo Yesi hadn’t helped her get this endorsement.

But apart from Mo Yesi, she couldn’t think of anyone else.

Anyway, there must be another reason.

Otherwise, a top-notch makeup brand like MC would never hire a newcomer like her as their spokesperson.

This was equivalent to taking a huge risk.

Using a newbie like her, who had no fame or fans, could lead to poor sales for the next season.

Qiao Mianmian thought about it and asked, “Sister Xie, have you already signed the contract?”

“Yes.” Linda nodded. “I’ve already signed it. But... if you don’t think it’s suitable and don’t want to take on this endorsement, you can still reject the official contract.

“But, I hope you can take it.” Linda was still afraid that she would reject it. “This is a good opportunity.”

Qiao Mianmian thought about it seriously and nodded. “Since Sister Xie thinks this is a good opportunity, of course, I won’t reject it. You can make the arrangements.”

Qiao Mianmian wasn’t as persistent as before.

After talking to Linda that time, she changed her mind and stopped thinking about relying on herself.

Linda smiled and looked relieved. “Alright, since you’ve agreed, I’ll call them later and sign the official contract today. Try to sign it as soon as possible to avoid any changes.

“Several celebrities are watching.”

Qiao Mianmian said obediently, “Okay, I’ll listen to Sister Xie.”

Since Linda was already a top manager, Qiao Mianmian wasn’t worried about her.

“Alright. It’s settled, then.” Linda was satisfied with her attitude. She smiled and said, “If this endorsement goes well, it will increase your fame. Do you know how much the other party has given you?”

Linda’s smile widened at the mention of the contract fee.

Obviously, she was very satisfied with it.

Qiao Mianmian was also interested in the signing fee. “How much?”

“This many.” Linda extended three fingers.

Qiao Mianmian was stunned. “Three million?”

Linda was speechless.

She laughed. “Mianmian, you underestimate yourself too much. How can a big brand like MC’s contract fee only be three million? If it’s three million, how can I accept it?”
