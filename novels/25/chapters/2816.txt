Chapter 2819: No Smoke Without Fire

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“But because it was Chairman Mo’s wife, the front desk made an exception.”

When Chairman Lin heard that the manager actually told Gong Zeli about this, he was about to scold him in a fit of anger. But when he heard the second half of the sentence, he immediately shut his mouth.

If she was a shareholder’s wife, she would have the same rights as a shareholder.

It wasn’t against the rules for the front desk to book the VIP private room for her.

Although Chairman Lin heaved a sigh of relief, he suddenly recalled the conflict between Gong Zeli and Mo Yesi.

But…

It was Mo Yesi.

He’d even seen a few scandals between Gong Zeli and Mo Yesi’s wife.

They said that their relationship was ambiguous.

Perhaps he probably had nothing against Mo Yesi’s wife.

However, although the rumors might not be true, there was a saying that there was no smoke without fire.

Chairman Lin felt a little more at ease.

“Yes, Young Master Gong.” Chairman Lin stole a glance at Gong Zeli and saw that his expression wasn’t too bad. He quickly stepped forward to clear his responsibility and said respectfully, “We booked the private room because it was Young Madam Mo.

“If I knew that Young Master Gong would come, I would have kept the VIP room for you.

“But if Young Master Gong wants to use it, we can call Young Madam Mo now and tell her that the VIP room has been booked.”

Although they couldn’t afford to offend Young Madam Mo, compared to this person in front of him… he’d rather offend the former.

Offending the former he could perhaps still keep his life.

Offending the latter might cost him his life. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Gong Zeli didn’t say anything, but there was a strange look in his eyes.

Qiao Mianmian was coming here tonight?

Then, he could use the excuse to meet her.

He was in a good mood. His cold expression softened, and his eyes seemed to melt.

The cold aura around him also warmed up, making him less unapproachable.

Chairman Lin felt Gong Zeli’s sudden change and a thought flashed through his mind.

It seemed like the rumors weren’t just rumors.

Young Master Gong and Young Madam Mo… their relationship seemed indeed a little ambiguous.

The cold-looking person’s expression changed drastically when he heard that Qiao Mianmian was also here.

The joy in his eyes was obvious.

He was so open.

Anyone could tell.

In that case…

The other rumor was true.

Mo Yesi and Gong Zeli had been buddies for so many years, but they had fallen out. Perhaps it was really because Gong Zeli was eyeing his wife.

If it was true, Young Madam Mo was really troublesome.

The two most respected men in Yuncheng City had fallen for her.

“Since Miss Qiao has reserved it, let her use the VIP room. You can arrange for another one..” After a moment of silence, Gong Zeli seemed to have regained his usual coldness.
