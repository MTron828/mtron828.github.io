Chapter 1644: This Flattery

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Except for family members.

If Mo Shixiu wanted to bring Jiang Luoli along, it meant that she was his family.

Was he... planning to marry Jiang Luoli?

Assistant Xu felt that he should be more respectful to Jiang Luoli in the future. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Otherwise.

If that girl really flirted with the minister, would his assistant have a good life?

“I got it, Minister. I’ll arrange it immediately.”

Assistant Xu left the study and saw Jiang Luoli walking over with a cup of coffee.

“Miss Jiang.”

Assistant Xu was even more polite and respectful now that he knew how important Jiang Luoli was to Mo Shixiu.

He subconsciously treated Jiang Luoli as his future wife.

Given the minister’s personality, as long as Jiang Luoli didn’t cause any trouble, she had a high chance of marrying him in the future.

Even if her family background wasn’t good enough for the minister.

But as long as the minister acknowledged her, it was useless even if Madam and the rest disagreed.

Just like how Second Young Master married an ordinary girl first.

These two brothers had their own opinions.

People who were determined wouldn’t break up because of their family’s objections.

After all, they weren’t relying on the Mo Family now. The Mo Family relied on them to become stronger.

This was different from those rich playboys who relied on their families to lead a superior life.

“Assistant Xu, is Mo Shixiu still busy?” Jiang Luoli made a cup of coffee and wanted to give it to Mo Shixiu.

Although Mo Shixiu came to look for her despite his busy work, he went back to work after confirming her safety.

Knowing that he was busy, Jiang Luoli didn’t dare to disturb him. She handed the freshly brewed coffee to Assistant Xu. “Give this coffee cup to him.”

“Miss Jiang, bring it in.” Assistant Xu didn’t reach out to take it.

“I’d better not disturb him.”

“No, no.” Assistant Xu immediately said, “When Miss Jiang goes in, the minister will only be happy to see you. When he’s happy, he has more motivation to work. When he has more motivation to work, his efficiency will also increase. So, not only will Miss Jiang not disturb him, but she will also increase his efficiency. Miss Jiang doesn’t need to give him any coffee. You’re the Minister’s stimulant.”

“...”

Jiang Luoli’s lips twitched.

Why did she feel like Assistant Xu was suddenly flattering her?

Was she hallucinating?

Although Assistant Xu treated her rather well after she officially dated Mo Shixiu.

But he didn’t flatter as much as he was flattering her now.

“Come, come, Miss Jiang, quickly go in. The minister needs your coffee now.”

Assistant Xu even opened the door.

Jiang Luoli was speechless.

This wasn’t an illusion.

Assistant Xu was really flattering her.

This flattery made her feel greasy.

Jiang Luoli looked at him and thought for a while before walking in with the coffee.

After she entered, Assistant Xu closed the door gently and walked out of the presidential suite.
