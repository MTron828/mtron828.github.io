He walked towards Bai Yusheng.

Everyone looked at him in shock.

Qiao Mianmian and Qin Han couldn’t continue acting.

The two of them returned to reality after a while. Qiao Mianmian looked at Mo Yesi in shock. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

She didn’t know what he wanted to do.

Bai Yusheng frowned unhappily. “Mo Yesi, what do you mean?”

Mo Yesi glanced in Qin Han’s direction and said calmly, “I think we can use a substitute for the later scene.”

“Use a substitute?” Bai Yusheng frowned even harder. “You mean to find a substitute for Mianmian? Mo Yesi, are you here to cause trouble?”

Mo Yesi said, “I’m serious.”

Bai Yusheng was speechless.

He wanted to scold him.

He knew that this guy wouldn’t be able to sit still.

He really didn’t know why he was staying here. He was just looking for trouble.

“Are you kidding me? How could it be so easy to find a substitute that resembles Mianmian at a time like this? I’ve already told you, if you can’t stand it, don’t force yourself to look. Now that you’ve seen it, are you sure you’re not here to cause trouble?”

Bai Yusheng couldn’t tolerate his work progress being interrupted, and it was because of someone’s jealousy.

“I didn’t say to find a substitute for Mianmian.” Mo Yesi was still calm. He placed his hands in his pockets and looked at him. “What do you think of me?”

Bai Yusheng frowned. “You? What do you mean?”

“I’m about the same height and figure as the male lead. I think I can be his substitute.”

“Are you crazy?!” Bai Yusheng finally understood what he meant and was shocked. “You want to be Qin Han’s substitute? Mo Yesi, do you know how to act? Are you kidding me?”

“I’m not in the habit of joking. I’ll film the last scene.” Mo Yesi didn’t sound like he was discussing it with him.

Bai Yusheng was speechless.

“It’s decided. I’ll go change with him.”

Mo Yesi didn’t care whether Bai Yusheng agreed or not. He turned around and walked towards Qin Han.

As a senior in the industry, he had won several Best Actor awards at such a young age. Qin Han was already past the stage of being nervous when he saw someone.

But in front of someone with such a strong aura like Mo Yesi, even if he was the Best Actor, he couldn’t help but feel nervous.

At this moment, as the Best Actor, he no longer had his usual composure. He was so nervous that he looked like a student who had seen a teacher.

“Mr. Qin.”

Mo Yesi stopped beside Qiao Mianmian and wrapped an arm around her waist.

He looked at Qin Han and said, “Mr. Qin, you don’t have to do the last scene. Let me do it. Mr. Qin, you don’t have any objections, right?”

Qin Han was stunned.

Qiao Mianmian looked up in shock. “Mo Yesi, what are you doing? Stop fooling around...”

“I’m not.” Mo Yesi looked down at the woman beside him. “I’ve already told the director that I’ll be Mr. Qin’s substitute and complete this scene with you.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

What she was worried about happened!!
