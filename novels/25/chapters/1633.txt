Chapter 1634: How Could It Be You?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Book the plane tickets immediately, don’t waste any more time. It’s settled, don’t say anymore.”

Assistant Xu was speechless.

Minister, aren’t you being too willful?

At this moment, Assistant Xu felt the power of love.

Their minister was someone who valued his work more than anything else.

Nothing had ever affected his work.

In his heart, work was first, and then came everything else.

Even when he was dating Jiang Luoli, his personal feelings didn’t affect his work.

This was the first time he put his work aside.

Hence, this surprised Assistant Xu.

He never thought that Jiang Luoli’s place in Mo Shixiu’s heart was so important.

Assistant Xu knew very well that once Mo Shixiu decided on something, he wouldn’t be able to persuade him.

Although he didn’t agree with this, he could only follow the instructions and book the earliest flight immediately.

At the same time, he started to formulate an emergency plan. If Mo Shixiu’s schedule changed tomorrow, he could at least deal with it.

There was no need to be so hasty.

...

When Jiang Luoli woke up, she found herself lying on an unfamiliar bed.

The room was also unfamiliar.

Still in a daze, she lay on the bed for almost a minute before slowly waking up.

Her body was still a little weak.

She struggled to sit up.

About a minute later, she remembered what happened before she fainted.

She was called downstairs by Father Jiang. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Mother Jiang made a table of dishes for the first time, picked up food for her, poured water for her, and apologized to her.

Then, she drank the glass of water Mother Jiang gave her...

Jiang Luoli’s face turned pale as if her heart had been stabbed by a sharp weapon.

She never expected Mother Jiang to do this to her.

She thought that no matter how biased Mother Jiang and Father Jiang were, she was still their daughter.

They wouldn’t do anything overboard.

But now...

Looking at the unfamiliar decor and the closed door, Jiang Luoli smiled mockingly. Her heart felt like it was submerged in ice water.

She still overestimated her parents.

She overestimated her place in her parents’ hearts.

The door opened.

Jiang Luoli grabbed the bedsheets tightly and looked at the door guardedly.

A man entered.

The lights in the room weren’t turned on, so Jiang Luoli couldn’t see what the man looked like. She could only see a rough outline.

It was a tall man.

She bit her lip and looked at the vase on the bedside table. She slowly moved her hand over.

Slap.

The room lit up.

The man turned on the lights.

Jiang Luoli widened her eyes in shock. “Brother Zewen, how could it be you?”

Xie Zewen stopped and looked at her from five to six meters away.

He looked at Jiang Luoli with a complicated expression. A few seconds later, he said, “Luoli, you-you still don’t know what happened?”

Jiang Luoli shook her head.

“Brother Zewen, where’s this?” Jiang Luoli relaxed when she saw that it was Xie Zewen.
