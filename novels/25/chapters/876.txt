“Huang Yilin, stop right there. Did you hear me?”

“If you continue like this, I’ll get the security officers to come over.”

Qiao Mianmian looked up and saw Huang Yilin and her manager walking towards her.

Huang Yilin sneered as she walked. “Tu Yilei, even you have to lie to me. Before I came, I already asked around. Qiao Mianmian is here today. Why, are you so afraid that I’ll do something bad to her?

“You’ve seen it for yourself. I’m already in such a terrible state, what else can I do to her?

“Don’t worry, I wouldn’t dare to offend her now. It’s because of her that I became so pitiful. Do you think she’s really a newbie with no background and can be bullied by others?”

Tu Yilei caught up with her and frowned. “What do you mean?”

Huang Yilin turned to look at him with hatred in her eyes. “Do you know who’s responsible for my current state? Ha, I really underestimated her. I thought she got together with Bai Yusheng, but who knew that she has someone even more powerful than him.

“Tu Yilei, let me give you a piece of advice. Don’t have those thoughts you shouldn’t have. This woman isn’t someone you can covet. You’ve seen how pitiful I am now. If the sugar daddy behind her finds out about your thoughts, you’ll end up like me very soon.

“Oh, that’s not right. It might even be worse. If you dare to covet that person’s woman, banning you is already a light punishment.”

Tu Yilei knew that Qiao Mianmian was nearby.

Hence, when he heard what Huang Yilin said, he frowned and said, “Huang Yilin, what nonsense are you talking about? We’re just friends, don’t talk nonsense.”

“Friends?” Huang Yilin scoffed. “Your words can fool your underage fans. Do you think I’ll believe you? I’m reminding you out of goodwill because we know each other.

“If you still want to continue in the entertainment industry, don’t get too close to her. Isn’t my ending enough to wake you up?”

At this point, Huang Yilin smiled self-deprecatingly. “Who would’ve thought that she’d only get the third female lead when she had such a powerful backing? I was wrong this time. I brought this upon myself.”

If she managed to hook up with someone from the Mo family, she could easily get a female lead role.

At the very least, she could be the second female lead.

How could she have expected that a woman who managed to hook up with the Mo family would only be the third female lead?

If she’d known from the start that Qiao Mianmian’s backing was the Mo family.

Even if she had ten guts, she wouldn’t dare to touch her.

“The person you’re talking about is...” Tu Yilei recalled the man he’d seen twice, and his expression changed slightly.

The moment he saw that man, he knew that he was someone extraordinary.

But to be able to destroy Huang Yilin so easily and make her so afraid and fearful, it was obvious that that man’s identity was much more powerful than he imagined.

It wasn’t as if he hadn’t investigated it before.

But for the first time, his information network couldn’t find out that man’s identity.

From what Huang Yilin said, she knew that man’s identity?

Huang Yilin pursed her lips and kept quiet for a few seconds. A hint of fear flashed in her eyes as if just mentioning that person’s name would make her afraid.
