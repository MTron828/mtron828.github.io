Chapter 420: Turning to Hubby for Everything

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Qiao Mianmian didn’t feel like there was a need to trouble him.

But Mo Yesi didn’t seem too happy with her thoughtful decision.

He frowned and paused for a moment, then said, “So, when something like this happened, your first instinct wasn’t to call me and ask for my help, but to tell your brother about it instead? And get his help?”

Qiao Mianmian: “Uh...”

Why did Mo Yesi seem a little unhappy about it?

“I just felt like there wasn’t a need to trouble you with everything. You’re already busy enough with your work in the company, and this isn’t a very huge matter, so...”

“So, there wasn’t a need to let me know?”

“... Yeah.”

She did think that way.

Mo Yesi went quiet for a few seconds. “Anything regarding you is a huge matter to me. It’s more important than my work.”

Qiao Mianmian looked at him, and her heart began beating faster.

“Also, it’s never been troublesome to me.”

Her heart rate increased...

It was so quick that Qiao Mianmian had to place a hand on her chest, just in case her heart really burst out.

Ahhh.

Why was Mo Yesi so good at making her feel this way.

She really, really... couldn’t deal with this so many times. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

She was losing it.

Her heart was beating so quickly, she wanted to see if it was doing fine.

Who was going to believe that...

A man who looked so cold and distant could be so good when speaking out of love.

“Miss Qiao, please give this man pursuing you a chance to perform. Send me the link now, I’ll resolve this for you.”

This was his wife’s matter, why did he need his brother-in-law to resolve it?

He was going to prove with his actions that her husband was the most reliable and trustworthy person around her.

He wanted her to get used to looking for her husband whenever something cropped up.

Not anyone else.

Mo Yesi felt that they still had a lot of time, and she could get into this habit slowly.

It was time to start inculcating the habit of “turning to Hubby for everything.”

...

Qiao Mianmian eventually did send the link to Mo Yesi.

Considering Mo Yesi’s preferences, she picked a French restaurant not too far away from school. It took just over 10 minutes.

They got out of the car.

Mo Yesi brought his laptop along.

Qiao Mianmian thought that he was busy with work and said, “As busy as you are, you’ve got to set time aside to eat. Are you very busy today? You shouldn’t have come to have lunch with me.”

She wasn’t the sort of woman who needed her man’s company all the time.

If he had work to complete, he could just let her know. She’d fully understand.

Moreover, she didn’t like to spend every waking moment with him.

As close as they might be, they needed their own personal space.

She felt that the current arrangement was pretty good—spending her weekdays in school and only going to live with Mo Yesi on the weekends.

If they lived under the same roof, there wouldn’t be any sense of mystery anymore, and it’d get boring.

Mo Yesi did not say anything in response.

Only after they took their seats in the restaurant did he say, “I’m not that busy. I still have time to eat with you.”
