Chapter 886: Feeling a Little Sentimental About This Warmth

It caused the clue to be stuck at a certain point and couldn’t be carried out anymore. It took up so much time.

At this point, Bai Yusheng looked at Qiao Mianmian with a complicated look. “You’re from Yuncheng City too. I took a strange liking for you the moment I saw you. I feel like you’re like my sister. So, I’m thinking, could you really be my sister?”

“Brother Bai, I...”

“But, that’s impossible, right?” Bai Yusheng smiled and sighed. “My sister was adopted, how could it be you?”

Qiao Mianmian kept quiet for a while and somehow felt a little sad.

She knew that she shouldn’t have such emotions.

Perhaps Bai Yusheng would be able to find his sister soon.

Their family could be reunited.

This was something worth celebrating. She should be happy for Bai Yusheng.

After all, she knew how much he wanted a younger sister and how much he cared about her.

Their whole family had been looking for that girl for over a decade.

It was easy to imagine how important that girl was to their family.

But she realized that she couldn’t seem to be happy.

She felt a little disappointed.

When Bai Yusheng found his sister, all his love would definitely be given to her.

She... made him feel she was his sister. How could she be treated so gently?

Would he still treat her so well?

It couldn’t be.

His biological sister had returned to his side, how could he treat an outsider so well?

Actually, this was very normal, and she could understand it.

But she couldn’t help but feel sad and disappointed.

If he’d never treated her well, she definitely wouldn’t have felt anything. But these few days, he’d been treating her like a gentle big brother. He’d done so many things that warmed her heart, and she’d started to become greedy.

He was reluctant to leave her.

Hence, when Bai Yusheng mentioned that he had a clue about his sister, he suddenly felt disappointed.

Humans were really greedy creatures.

Bai Yusheng was only nice to her for a few days, but she was already reluctant to part with him. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“Brother Bai, then... congratulations.” She suppressed the bitterness in her heart and forced a smile. She didn’t want her emotions to be too obvious. “It seems like your family will be reunited soon. It’s a joyous occasion.”

“Yes, it’s indeed a happy occasion.” Bai Yusheng nodded. “Our family has been looking for her for 18 years, and now we finally have a clue. Mianmian, I think you’re my lucky star.”

Qiao Mianmian was stunned. “Why do you say that?”

Bai Yusheng smiled. “Didn’t you say before that our family will definitely be reunited soon? Look, once you said it, we found out the clues very quickly. Isn’t this lucky enough? I feel like this good luck was brought by you.

“I’ve been investigating for 18 years, but I haven’t found any leads. But after meeting you, I found some very quickly. Mianmian, you’ll bring good luck to the people around you, so you don’t have to worry anymore. I think Tu Yilei will be fine.”

Was she a lucky star?

Qiao Mianmian smiled self-mockingly as she recalled how Tu Yilei was injured because of her.
