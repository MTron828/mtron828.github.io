Chapter 2073: It’s Better to Forget Each Other Than Remember Each Other

“Sheng Sheng, Young Master Bai wouldn’t like such a girl. Moreover, Young Master Bai has been alone for so many years. You’re the one in his heart…”

“Xiao Nuan!” Gu Sheng’s expression changed. “Don’t say anymore. I’ve said it before, he has nothing to do with me. The current Gu Sheng has nothing to do with Bai Yusheng anymore. Don’t talk about him anymore.

“This topic is over. I’m sleepy, I want to sleep for a while.” With that, Gu Sheng pulled the thin blanket over her and closed her eyes.

Her companion looked at her slender back and sighed.

Bai Yusheng was Gu Sheng’s reverse scale.

Gu Sheng would explode at the mention of him.

But the more it was like this, the more it proved that Gu Sheng hadn’t let go of Bai Yusheng.

If she really had, she would have been calm when talking about him.

Not like this.

As for Bai Yusheng…

He probably hadn’t completely let go of Gu Sheng, either.

Otherwise, he wouldn’t have been single all these years.

Many people thought that Bai Yusheng had high standards and didn’t like anyone, thus the reason why he was single.

But few knew that Bai Yusheng had someone in his heart.

Not many people knew about Bai Yusheng and Gu Sheng.

If Gu Sheng still liked Bai Yusheng and Bai Yusheng still liked Gu Sheng, it would be a sad thing.

They liked each other, but they couldn’t be together.

Was there anything more tragic than this?

Hence, she would rather Gu Sheng forget about Bai Yusheng. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

It was also better for Bai Yusheng to forget about Gu Sheng.

It was better to forget each other than to remember each other.

But…

Did Bai Yusheng really forget about Gu Sheng and found someone else?

She saw that in the photos, Bai Yusheng and the girl were indeed very intimate. More importantly, Bai Yusheng looked at the girl with a gentle and loving gaze. It was obvious that their relationship wasn’t ordinary.

That girl was very beautiful.

Even more beautiful than Gu Sheng.

And so young…

Some actresses had scandals with Bai Yusheng before, but it was different this time.

Those were just rumors.

This time…

The girl in the photo was so beautiful.

It wasn’t impossible for Bai Yusheng to fall for her.

What about Gu Sheng?

…

On the other side.

After receiving Qiao Mianmian’s call, Bai Yusheng used his Weibo account to post a clarification.

Bai Yusheng V: “I actually didn’t know that being intimate with my sister can be described as cheating. Mianmian keeps a low profile and doesn’t want to publicize many things, but it seems like it’s better to be high-profile. At least she won’t have scandals with her brother.”

Bai Yusheng rarely posted on Weibo.

He usually only did it when promoting his shows.

A few minutes later, thousands of comments appeared.

Then, the entire Weibo was paralyzed for a few minutes.

When it recovered, everyone was shocked.

“What?!! Biological brother?!! Is that what he means? Qiao Mianmian and Bai Yusheng are biological siblings?!”

“??? Bai Yusheng and Qiao Mianmian are siblings?!! What’s going on?!”

“Director Bai, you mean Qiao Mianmian is your biological sister? We didn’t get it wrong, right?!”
