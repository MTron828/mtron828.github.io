Chapter 489: Are You Tu Yilei

Mo Yesi smiled uncontrollably and replied: [Alright, let’s chat later.]

In the driver’s seat.

Uncle Li witnessed how his Young Master had changed from being grumpy to happy, and he couldn’t help but exclaim to himself. “No one can escape the effects of love. Once you’re in love, you’re no longer in charge of even your own emotions.”

His young master was such a cool man before.

No one could affect his emotions.

But once he met the woman of his life, he wasn’t different from any other man.

He could change beyond recognition for a girl.

Uncle Li couldn’t decide if this was good for him.

It should be good for him.

If someone didn’t have any attachment to anyone or cared about anything, he would stop being understanding.

He hoped that his young master would never be someone like that.

“Let go to the film studio.”

...

On the other side.

Qiao Mianmian signed the contract successfully.

The staff member responsible for the contract signing reminded her before she left. “Miss Qiao, do remember that we are starting the shoot three days later at M City.”

“Alright. I’m aware of it. Don’t worry. I’ll be on time.” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Qiao Mianmian held onto the freshly-signed contract and was happily exiting the office.

As she was walking out, she knocked onto someone.

She smelled the faint trace of cologne as she knocked onto the person’s chest. It felt as though she hit a rock, and the pain caused her to back off while holding her nose.

The other person also took a step back.

Before Qiao Mianmian could take a look at who the other person was, she heard a loud exclamation. “Oh no, Xiao Tutu, are you alright? What’s wrong with you, little girl? Can’t you watch where you’re going? How are you going to be responsible if he gets hurt?

“Xiao Tutu, are you alright? Do you need to go to the hospital? This little girl is strong even though she looks so skinny. Did you do it on purpose? Let me tell you, your method is outdated.

“Everyone wants to get involved with our Xiao Tutu nowadays. It must be because of his popularity.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

What!

Who was Xiao Tutu? How did she knock into him on purpose? How was she trying to get involved with him...

“Ahem. Mike, shut up!” another man said.

His voice sounded really good.

It had a positive vibe and was full of energy.

“Miss, are you ok?” The attractive voice appeared again.

Qiao Mianmian was rubbing her swollen nose when she looked up.

Her eyes widened in shock as she recognized the man bending over and checking her out.

“Are you... Tu Yilei?”

Qiao Mianmian was aware that the male lead for the script she signed was Tu Yilei.

Jiang Luoli already told her from the start.

Hence, it wasn’t unexpected to see him here.

However, as it was the first time she saw him in person and so closely, Qiao Mianmian couldn’t keep her composure.

Tu Yilei wasn’t her idol.

But he was a prince charming to tens of thousands of girls.

He was the most popular idol at the moment, so even though she wasn’t a fan of his, she knew about him.
