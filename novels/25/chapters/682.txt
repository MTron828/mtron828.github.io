A hand reached out.

Qiao Mianmian instinctively took a step back.

But that hand still held her firmly.

She screamed as she was pulled into the room.

At the same time, the door was slammed shut and she was pinned against the door.

The figure in front of her was tall and straight, and the first thing she saw was darkness. Before Qiao Mianmian could see who it was, her jaw was pinched. The man’s domineering and passionate kiss landed on her lips.

She widened her eyes in shock.

Just as she was about to struggle, a familiar scent entered her nose.

The fear in her eyes turned into shock.

This aura...

It was Mo Yesi.

Why was he here?

Her confusion only lasted for a few seconds before she was entranced by the man’s passionate kiss. The oxygen in her brain and chest depleted, and her eyes got more and more blurred...

She almost lost her balance and was pulled up by the man.

It was a punishing kiss.

It was extremely passionate.

Qiao Mianmian was pressed against the door and kissed for more than 10 minutes. It was only when she was about to pass out from the lack of oxygen that Mo Yesi released her.

His dark eyes were filled with desire as he looked at the girl in his arms whose lips were swollen from the kiss. His eyes darkened and his desire deepened.

He really wanted to... eat her up.

Who knew that they’d only been apart for a day?

He missed her so much.

Qiao Mianmian rested her head on his chest and panted for a long time before slowly recovering.

Her eyes were misty as she looked up at him. “Mo- Mo Yesi, why are you here? Aren’t you...”

Wasn’t he at work?

Today wasn’t the weekend.

Why would he have the time to look for her?

Moreover, why didn’t he tell her that he was coming?

She was almost scared to death when he dragged her into the room. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“Baby, I miss you.”

Mo Yesi hugged her tightly and kissed her again. “Did you miss me, hm?”

Qiao Mianmian’s lips were numb from his kiss. She said in a soft and hoarse voice, “But, aren’t you at work? If you leave, what about the company?”

He had just taken over the Mo Corporation.

She knew that he was busy for at least a year.

Usually, he would work overtime in the study room when he got home.

Did he not care about the company anymore?

“Why, are you unhappy to see me?” Mo Yesi looked down at the little woman in his arms. He didn’t see any surprise or joy on her face, so he frowned unhappily.

He recalled the photo Bai Yusheng sent him.

In the photo, she seemed to be chatting happily with the male lead with a sweet smile on her face.

But she never smiled like that when she saw him.

The jealousy in his heart got stronger.

Bai Yusheng said that the male lead was about her age...

They were of similar age and were in the same industry, so they would definitely have a lot of topics to talk about.
