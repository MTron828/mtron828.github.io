“Not your woman?” Yan Shaoqing raised his brows even higher. He glanced at Su Su, whose face had instantly turned pale, and pondered over this sentence. Then, he smiled and said, “Fourth Bro, are you trying to tell me that you spent money to raise this little girl just to look at her?

“You haven’t…”

“You can shut up now.” Gong Zeli interrupted him coldly. “Do you want to play basketball or not? If not, you can go back now.”

Yan Shaoqing was speechless.

Damn.

Gong Zeli’s attitude deserved a beating.

Had Fourth Gong forgotten who invited who?

As a brother, after receiving the invitation, he gave up the afternoon sea party without thinking and came here to play golf with a man.

If they hadn’t been brothers for so many years, would he be able to do this?

One had to know that the gathering in the afternoon was filled with top-notch beauties from all over the world.

Such gatherings were only held once a year.

If he missed it this time, he would have to wait for next year!

He even gave up so many beauties for his brother. It was fine if Fourth Gong wasn’t touched, but why was he being so mean to him?

He was furious.

Yan Shaoqing was furious. “Fourth Bro, you have no conscience. If it wasn’t for your call, I would have been hugging beauties and enjoying myself now. Do you know how many beauties I’ve thrown away because of you?”

“Oh, is that so?” Gong Zeli’s expression was still calm. “It’s not too late to go now. I won’t stop you.”

Yan Shaoqing was speechless.

Damn, Fourth Gong was really heartless!

He must be out of his mind to give up his beauties for this ingrate.

“Forget it, forget it. It’s not like I didn’t know what kind of person you are.” Yan Shaoqing glared at him for a while and seemed to accept his fate. “Don’t think of calling me out next time. Let me tell you, I won’t be so easy to date in the future.”

Did Yan Shaoqing not care about his reputation?

“Oh.” Gong Zeli still sounded indifferent. “So, are you leaving or not?”

Yan Shaoqing was speechless.

Damn it!

Why didn’t he know that Gong Zeli was capable of angering people to death?

“I won’t argue with you! Do you think I’m as petty as you? Anyway, I haven’t exercised in a long time, it’s not bad to play and relax.

“I’m going to change my clothes. We’ll have a good PK later. The loser will have all the money and a car tonight. Do you dare to bet?”

Gong Zeli smiled. “If you insist on giving me money, I have no reason to reject you.”

“Haha.” Yan Shaoqing sneered. “It’s not certain who will give the money to who. Aren’t you afraid of being slapped in the face if you say it so early?”

“Let’s give it a try.”

“Alright, let’s give it a try.”

They quickly went into the changing room to change.

The female companion that Yan Shaoqing brought along also walked towards the ladies changing room. After taking two steps, she saw that Su Su was still standing there with a pale face, so she called her. “Little girl, aren’t you going to change your clothes?”

Su Su snapped out of her daze.

She was too young to hide her feelings.

Her eyes were full of disappointment and sadness.

Although she knew that she wasn’t Gong Zeli’s woman, she still felt sad when he denied it.

Yes, he’d raised her. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

But he had never touched her.

Su Su knew why he didn’t touch her.

He had someone in his heart.

Because she looked a little like that person, she was lucky to be by his side.

But that was all.

He treated her as that person’s substitute, but he knew that she wasn’t that person.

Hence, he would never touch her.

Why would he touch a substitute?

“Little girl, do you like Young Master Gong?” The woman Yan Shaoqing brought was smart enough to read Su Su’s mind. She found it funny and tried to persuade her. “Little girl, I’ve been through this before. Listen to me. In our line of work, it’s taboo to lose your heart.

“Don’t be silly.

“Young Master Gong and the others live in a different world. It’s not good to harbor ill intentions towards them.”

Su Su blushed and quickly denied it. “You’ve misunderstood. I don’t have any feelings for Young Master Gong.”

“Is that so? It’s best if you don’t.” The woman looked at her coquettishly and smiled. “Otherwise, you’ll be the one suffering in the end. People like us are like cats and dogs to them. If they’re in a good mood, they’ll give you some benefits and tease you. If they’re in a bad mood, they’ll kick you away.

“We can covet their money and power, but we can’t covet their hearts. Sister saw that you’re young and was afraid that you wouldn’t be able to control yourself, so she said a few more words to you. I heard that Young Master Gong is rather generous. Since you have the chance to stay by his side, you might as well think about how to gain more benefits from him.

“Don’t think about anything else.”

The woman didn’t say anything else and went to the changing room.

Whether the other party would listen to her kind reminder depended on whether she had a clear mind.

Su Su was still standing rooted to the ground when the woman entered the changing room.

The biggest taboo was losing her heart.

But what to do?

She’d lost her heart the moment she saw Gong Zeli.

…

Only Gong Zeli and Yan Shaoqing were in the changing room.

Yan Shaoqing changed his clothes first, but he didn’t leave immediately. Instead, he turned around and looked at Gong Zeli, who was putting on his sportswear.

He thought for a while and said, “Zeli, about Su Su… do you still want her to stay by your side?”
