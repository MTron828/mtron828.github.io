Chapter 426: Miss Qiao Is Not Pregnant

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Jiang Luoli nodded. “That’s good, then. You really should teach them a lesson, and also that stepsister of yours...”

“We’ll see how she replies first.” Qiao Mianmian wasn’t in a hurry to get back at her.

After all, she had Mo Yesi behind her.

With Mo Yesi taking charge of this, she had nothing to worry about.

She was more interested in how Qiao Anxin was going to respond to this.

And also, how Su Ze intended to clean Qiao Anxin’s image for her.

The President’s office.

Su Ze’s assistant had just reported the facts to Su Ze when he sensed the atmosphere getting cold.

He looked up and saw Su Ze in his seat, his face dark and cold, and the air around him oddly still.

The assistant quickly looked back down.

Chairman Su was furious.

He’d been with Su Ze for about five years now, and as his right-hand man, he knew a lot about Su Ze’s private life too.

For instance, he knew that Su Ze was already having an affair with Qiao Anxin before he had broken up with Qiao Mianmian.

Su Ze didn’t hide it from him.

In fact, he had even got condoms for Su Ze when he urgently needed it.

To be honest, he didn’t think Su Ze would break up with Qiao Mianmian.

Because he knew that Su Ze really loved Qiao Mianmian and was prepared to marry her.

As for Qiao Anxin...

Su Ze was just toying with her from the start.

But Qiao Anxin was a smart woman. She knew that she wouldn’t be able to win him over, so she found a way to get pregnant with his child.

Basically, Su Ze ended up with her, mainly because of her child. That was it.

Otherwise, she wouldn’t have had a chance at all.

Under these circumstances, Chairman Su felt that it was too much that she’d been feigning her pregnancy. Even as an assistant, he felt that Qiao Anxin had gone overboard.

Back then, if it wasn’t for this child, Chairman Su wouldn’t have had to break up with the woman of his dreams.

Su Ze had clenched his fists when he heard the words “not pregnant” from his assistant. He reached a boiling point.

“You’re sure you got to the bottom of this?” He looked up, a little pale.

The assistant said politely, “Yes, this is what the doctor who did the test on Miss Qiao said. He said that Miss Qiao is not pregnant and that the two reports were someone else’s.”

Bam!

Su Ze swept everything off his desk the moment he heard that.

The floor was a terrible mess.

The assistant was startled. “Chairman Su, a-are you alright?”

“You’re asking if I’m alright?!”

Su Ze seemed triggered by his question and shot him a glare. His expression was menacing as he yelled, “Would you be alright if you were cheated by a woman like that?”

“Chairman Su...”

“Do you know why I agreed to break up with Qiao Mianmian? If it wasn’t because Qiao Anxin said she was pregnant, why would I have...” Su Ze looked like he was in agony.

He still loved Qiao Mianmian.

And he knew it the moment he broke up with her.

The difference was that, back then, he thought he could still keep her by his side.
