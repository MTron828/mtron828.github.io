Chapter 1585: How Dare You Act Arrogantly Before Us

She was still polite previously because, although Boss Huang was disgusting, he didn’t offend her. She didn’t want to offend anyone.

But she had nothing to worry about now.

Her expression darkened and her voice turned cold. “Boss Huang, please let go. I’ve said it before, I’m not interested in staying here.”

“Miss Qiao, you’re not giving me face.”

A man’s voice rang from behind Boss Huang. He sneered and said, “Boss Huang keeping you is an honor to you. Other women haven’t received such treatment, so why are you being so unreasonable? What, do you think you’re pretty? Why are you f*cking acting so arrogant?”

“I’m not interested in staying here. Who do you think you are?”

“Exactly, you don’t know how to appreciate favors.” Another man said, “Boss Huang gave you face and asked you nicely, but you’re still so disrespectful. Are you not taking Boss Huang seriously? A small actress dares to put on airs in front of us.”

“Women are like this. The more you give them face, the more they walk over you.”

Boss Huang was out with his friends.

He felt embarrassed when he heard their banter.

He had never encountered any problems with women.

He could get any woman he wanted.

But now, not only did Qiao Mianmian reject him, but she also rejected him in front of his friends. This made him indignant and angry.

He felt embarrassed and lost all rationality.

He tightened his grip on Qiao Mianmian’s wrist and said fiercely, “Damn it, I gave you face, but you don’t want it. I’m talking to you nicely, and you’re still not giving me face. Do you have to force me to be rough before you listen?

“Who do you think you are? Do you really think I’m asking for your opinion?

“Let me tell you, it doesn’t matter if you’re willing to stay or not. You’re not allowed to leave until I tell you to!”

With that, Boss Huang called his henchman over and said fiercely, “Go and watch at the door, don’t let her out.”

The two henchmen immediately left the private room and closed the door. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Boss Huang grabbed Qiao Mianmian’s arm and pulled her in. “Come here, have a drink with me.”

When the others saw this scene, they all clapped. “Boss Huang is awesome.”

“Boss Huang is so manly.”

“It should have been like this in the first place. How can she be so shameless?”

“Little girl, you’d better know your place. Do you know Boss Huang’s status? If you keep him company, you won’t have to worry about the industry in the future. Boss Huang can get whatever resources you want. I advise you to be good and not make everyone unhappy.”

“Let go of me!” Qiao Mianmian’s expression darkened. She shook off Boss Huang’s hand and turned to leave.

Boss Huang got angrier.

He could almost hear his friends laughing at him.

Seeing that Qiao Mianmian was already at the door, he flew into a rage and rushed over to grab her again.

Qiao Mianmian dodged and saw Boss Huang rushing towards her. In a moment of panic, she bent down and picked up a bottle on the coffee table and threw it at him.

Bam!

The bottle hit Boss Huang’s forehead, opening a wound. Blood flowed down his forehead.
