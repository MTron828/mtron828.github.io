Chapter 782: Why Would She Do That!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“If you agree to the divorce, I won’t mistreat you. Don’t you like acting? How about I make you an A-list actress? I can make you popular in the entertainment industry. I can give you whatever resources you want.

“Not only that, but I’ll also give you money, a house, a car, and jewelry. I can guarantee that you won’t have to worry about food and clothing for the rest of your life. As for your younger brother’s surgery, I can get the best specialist in the world to do it for him.

“Or if you still want to get married, I can help you pick a young talent in the upper-class society. Even if that man isn’t as outstanding as Ah Si, he’s definitely a dragon among men.”

At this point, Madam Mo felt that her conditions were good enough.

If Qiao Mianmian still didn’t agree, then she really didn’t know how to appreciate favors.

She wouldn’t mind teaching her a lesson.

“These conditions are already generous enough. I’m giving you preferential treatment only because you’ve been with my son for a while. Qiao Mianmian, you have to be sensible. If you reject me again, you’ll really anger me.”

Madam Mo sounded threatening. “Do you think it’s difficult to deal with a little girl like you? Even Ah Si can’t stop me if I want to deal with you.”

For some reason, Qiao Mianmian felt like laughing.

She was furious at first.

But now, she just found it funny.

She smiled and said, “Mom, these conditions are not enough to move me. Mo Yesi will give me everything you promised, and even more.

“I really can’t think of any reason to divorce him.”

Madam Mo was stunned and asked with a darkened expression, “Then, what exactly do you want to do to leave Ah Si? Qiao Mianmian, are you trying to make things difficult for me?”

Qiao Mianmian smiled again. “If you can satisfy one condition of mine, I can consider divorcing him?”

“What?”

“Give me 10 billion yuan. I believe this amount of money is nothing to the Mo family. So, if Mom can give me 10 billion yuan, I will consider the divorce.”

“What did you say?” Madam Mo widened her eyes in disbelief.

Qiao Mianmian smiled and repeated her words.

This time, Madam Mo heard it clearly.

Her expression was awful. “10 billion? You’re too greedy. What makes you think you’re worth 10 billion?”

The Mo family could afford 10 billion yuan.

But this was the first time Madam Mo met a girl like Qiao Mianmian.

She actually dared to ask for 10 billion yuan.

Why would she do that!

Her original plan was to give Qiao Mianmian a few hundred million yuan.

This amount of money was enough for her to live a good life.

But she didn’t expect her appetite to be so huge.

Moreover, although she never lacked money, she couldn’t just casually fork out 10 billion yuan.

“Mom, it’s not that I think I’m worth 10 billion yuan, but your son is worth 10 billion yuan. Didn’t you want me to divorce him? I’ve already stated my condition. As long as you can do it, I’ll divorce him. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“Isn’t your son’s freedom worth 10 billion?”
