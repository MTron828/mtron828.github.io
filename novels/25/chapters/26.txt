Chapter 27: What Ms. Qiao Lectured

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

She had encountered belittlement before.

However, this was really the first time she had met such snobbish people.

Since Mo Yesi had said that she was the wife of President Mo and had the power to fire any employee of Mo Firm’s, then she would never let these disgusting dogs stay here.

Behind her.

When the supervisor of the mall heard how the shop assistants scoffed at Qiao Mianmian, he was so frightened that cold sweat broke on his forehead.

These people really didn’t know the heights of the earth and were seeking their own death.

He didn’t know what the relationship between Ms. Qiao and President Mo was.

However, Assistant Wei had personally called and told him to take care of her properly and make sure they do not offend her!

Not to mention those few small employees!

President Mo’s person was bullied in their shopping mall. If this matter was not resolved, he may be fired.

Thinking of this, the supervisor’s expression suddenly changed.

“What nonsense are you spewing?”

He stepped out from behind Qiao Mianmian and said to the shop assistants with a steel face, “Ms. Qiao is a VIP in our mall. How dare you treat her like this!”

“Chen, President Chen?!”

When they saw the head of the shopping mall, several people immediately became respectful.

“Mr. Chen, have you misunderstood?” A clerk glanced at Qiao Mianmian, still with disdain and contempt. “We have no disrespect for Ms. Qiao, Ms. Qiao is a VIP customer in our shop. How could we possibly slander her?”

President Chen scolded. “Then what about what I’ve just heard?”

“Did you recognize the wrong person?” The clerk looked at Qiao Mianmian disdainfully. “The VIP in our shop is Ms. Qiao Anxin, not this thief named Qiao Mianmian. President Chen, you have arrived at the right time. We think this Qiao Mianmian is really suspicious. She must have stolen something from this mall. President Chen, you should search her body immediately, you can’t let her bring something from the mall out!”

“Yes, President Chen, she must have stolen something!”

“The police should be called to catch her. Thieves are the most disgusting.”

When President Chen listened to these words, the cold sweat on his forehead increased even more.

He scolded them a thousand times in his heart.

Forget about it if they were being stupid, but it affected him too.

Who recruited these idiots?!

“Enough!”

At this time, Su Ze, who had been silent, came over, his face calm and angrily. “Mianmian is not this kind of person, I believe her. Don’t make any more noise.”

After speaking, he frowned and looked at Qiao Mianmian with a bit of distress in his eyes. He said, “Mianmian, if you want to buy clothes, tell me, I...” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Before he could finish speaking, Qiao Mianmian turned around.

She never looked at him from beginning to end.

“Mr. Chen, what should you do about it?” Qiao Mianmian was very imposing in front of Mr. Chen and said coldly, “If the mall recruits such snobbish and belittling employees in the future, the personnel department will also change their employees.”

“Yes, yes. What Ms. Qiao spoke is the misconduct of the personnel department. I will definitely lecture them harshly later. Ms. Qiao, please calm down. I will immediately fire these employees who have slandered you. Furthermore, this mall will never hire them ever again.”

President Chen was extremely respectful. He bowed almost 90 degrees in front of Qiao Mianmian, and his humble gesture made the shop staff’s expressions change suddenly.
