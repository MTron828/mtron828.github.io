Chapter 1075: Anything Is Possible

However, if he found someone ordinary, it wouldn’t affect the Bai family much.

Hence, she didn’t think much about the family background.

As long as her son liked her.

Bai Yusheng rubbed his temples and explained, “Mom, it’s really not what you think. The actress you mentioned already has a boyfriend. The reason why I took special care of her is that someone asked me to.

“The other reason is that she’s fated to be with me. I don’t know why, but I have a very strange feeling when I’m with her. That’s why I can’t help but want to be nicer to her. But, this has nothing to do with love.

“I don’t have feelings for her.”

Madam Bai was stunned. “What strange feeling?”

Bai Yusheng thought about it seriously before saying, “I feel that she’s like my younger sister. When I’m with her, I have thoughts of getting close to her. But this thought of wanting to get close to her has nothing romantic about it.”

“She looks like your sister?” Mrs. Bai frowned. “But haven’t you found your sister yet?”

“Yes, I haven’t found her yet.” Bai Yusheng nodded. “I also know that she can’t be my sister. But when I’m with her, I always have the illusion that she’s my sister. Mom, she’s a very likable girl. You’ll know when you see her.

“Besides, although I’ve only seen photos of my sister when she was young, she looks quite similar to her.”

Upon hearing this, Mrs. Bai asked curiously, “Really? She looks like your sister? Little Five, have you found out that your sister is in Yun Cheng? Is the girl you’re talking about from Yun Cheng? Could she be...”

“I’ve thought about it too.” Bai Yusheng interrupted Madam Bai and sighed softly. “However, the possibility is very small and can almost be eliminated. She’s a local of Yun Cheng and has lived here since she was young.”

Mrs. Bai didn’t think so.

She thought for a moment, then said, “Since we’ve already found out that your sister is in Yun Cheng, then any Yun Cheng girl her age could be her. How old is this girl?” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Nineteen.”

“Nineteen?” Madam Bai’s expression changed slightly, and her expression became much more serious. “Your younger sister is also nineteen this year. Did you ask when she was born?”

Bai Yusheng was stunned for a moment before shaking his head. “No.”

“Then, hurry up and ask.” Madam Bai said agitatedly, “Who knows, she might be the precious daughter I’ve been looking for. Hurry up and show me her photo. I’ll see if she looks like Xiaoqi.”

Bai Yusheng: “... Mom, she can’t be...”

How could there be such a coincidence in this world?

Just because he felt that Qiao Mianmian resembled his sister, was she really his sister?

“Show me her photo first.” Madam Bai glared at him unhappily. “How do you know it’s not her? It might be. Nothing is impossible in this world. Anything is possible.”

Bai Yusheng had no choice but to show her some photos of Qiao Mianmian.

Madam Bai looked at each one of them seriously. After a while, she looked up excitedly. “Yes, she’s very similar to Xiaoqi. Especially her eyes and nose, they’re exactly the same as when Xiaoqi was young.”
