Chapter 277: I Won’t Take Them for Real

If she really still had feelings for Su Ze, his current actions were only going to push her farther from himself.

Qiao Mianmian was still crying and her eyes were constantly teary no matter how many times he wiped them.

She felt exceptionally aggrieved.

This was the first time Mo Yesi was this fierce to her, and the first time he looked so terrifying.

It was as if he was a completely different person.

Qiao Mianmian felt like he was a stranger standing before her.

All she felt was fear and an impulse to escape.

But the more Mo Yesi tried to comfort her, the harder she cried.

He actually accused her of still having feelings for Su Ze! Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

He actually said she’d been thinking of getting a divorce with him this whole time!

How could he?!

Had he never trusted her all this while?

He’d always been suspecting that she still had a longing for Su Ze.

This time, the truths were spilled all at once because of his anger.

He’d never believed in her.

Qiao Mianmian was very hurt. She didn’t know how to face Mo Yesi or talk to him anymore.

By her side, the man was apologizing profusely in that captivating voice of his.

Qiao Mianmian sniffled and wiped the tears off her eyes before backing off from him.

Mo Yesi dared not stop her. He was afraid he’d agitate her further.

“Baby, I’m sorry. I take back what I said.” He looked at the girl who’d now curled herself up and was still wiping her tears, and the regret surged inside him.

He reached out, wanting to touch her face.

But she evaded him right away.

Mo Yesi furrowed his brows.

“Baby, I...”

Before he managed to apologize again, Qiao Mianmian suddenly looked up at him with her swollen bloodshot eyes. Her voice was hoarse and cold as she said, “Since you think that I still have feelings for Su Ze, then let’s get a divorce,” she said in a fit of anger.

“You’re right, I do have feelings for him. And I’ve been waiting to get a divorce from you. Mo Yesi, let’s get a divorce. You don’t want to be with a woman who’s thinking of another man, right?

“You can find another woman who loves you wholeheartedly. I’m not suitable for you.”

Mo Yesi’s expression changed.

His expression darkened the instant he heard “divorce”.

A veil of darkness was layered upon his face when he heard her say she still liked Su Ze.

He knew that she was just saying it out of spite, but he was still deeply affected by it.

“Mianmian, don’t say such things out of anger.” He pursed his lips and took a deep breath, at once swallowing the ball of fury so as not to scare her again. “I was wrong just now. You can be angry. You can scold me or even hit me. But don’t say things like getting a divorce.”

“I’ve said it before. I won’t divorce you.”

Qiao Mianmian wiped her tears and smiled. “Mo Yesi, you’re such a proud man, can you tolerate your wife having feelings for another man? You’re right, Su Ze and I have known each other for 10 years, our relationship isn’t something I can forget with the flick of a switch. If I never forget him, will you be able to accept it?”

“Stop.” Mo Yesi got up and looked at her from the bedside. “I know you’re still angry, and all of this is out of spite. I won’t take it for real.”
