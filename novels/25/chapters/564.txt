Chapter 565: The Way You Looked at Her Was Very Strange

“So, you agree?” Shen Rou lifted her head in excitement.

Gong Zeli’s gaze deepened as he continued to lock gazes with her and nodded. “I will try my best to help you. But you know Ah Si’s personality as well, I can’t force him to do anything...”

“You just have to help me make Qiao Mianmian leave Ah Si. I will settle the rest by myself.” A look of hatred was mixed in her eyes as she mentioned Qiao Mianmian’s name, and that hatred was so strong that even Gong Zeli could feel it from her eyes.

He couldn’t help but ask, “Rourou, do you really hate Qiao Mianmian so much? Just because you think she stole Ah Si away from you?”

Shen Rou was stunned.

She could tell that Gong Zeli was trying to speak for Qiao Mianmian.

That immediately made her unhappy.

“Ze Li, do you feel that I shouldn’t hate her?” Her eyes were filled with indignance. “You helped me do the background check on her previously, so you should know her family background clearly. Aren’t you worried that she’s only with Ah Si because she wants to make use of him?

“Even though Ah Si is very capable and successful in his work, he doesn’t have many relationship experiences, so he’s practically like a blank piece of paper when it comes to relationships. Qiao Mianmian talked him into even getting the marriage certificate with her. Don’t you feel she’s very cunning?

“I’m just worried that Ah Si will be tricked by her.”

Gong Zeli stayed silent for a moment. “I beg to differ.”

Shen Rou looked at him with shock. “Ze Li, you...”

“Yes, Ah Si is a very outstanding man by himself. But even if Qiao Mianmian got together with him with ulterior motives in mind, it’s impossible that she doesn’t have an ounce of love towards him. Besides, I believe that Ah Si is way smarter than anyone. It’s not so easy for someone to trick him.”

“Ze Li, why are you taking her side and speaking up for her?” Shen Rou suddenly recalled the way he looked at Qiao Mianmian that night at the KTV was already slightly unusual. And now...

A sense of danger alarmed her.

Her breath quickened, and she suddenly felt really angry without knowing why.

She knew that Gong Zeli liked her.

So, even if he had multiple dates and women, and he seemed like a total Cassanova, she knew clearly that they were only his toys.

He had never felt anything for any of them.

So, she didn’t care about him fooling around like that.

She wouldn’t compare herself to those low and cheap women.

She had never needed to worry about Gong Zeli falling for another woman as well.

She knew how faithful and loyal his feelings were for her.

But at this moment...

She actually felt that sense of fear and danger.

She underestimated Qiao Mianmian.

That woman always seemed to make her feel scared and insecure.

“I’m not speaking for her or taking sides, I’m just stating the facts. Rourou, are you sure you want to do this? Even if Ah Si really breaks up with her, it doesn’t mean that he will be with you...”

“Do you not want to help me anymore?” Shen Rou asked him interrogatively as anger rose in her eyes. “Gong Zeli, are you smitten with Qiao Mianmian too?”

Gong Zeli frowned. “What nonsense is that?”

“That night, I saw you looking at her strangely.” Shen Rou’s anger bubbled as she spoke, and she pushed away his hand on her head. “If you don’t want to help, forget it. Open the door, I want to get out now.”

“Rou Rou?”

“Why did the both of you fall for her? Is she really that good?”
