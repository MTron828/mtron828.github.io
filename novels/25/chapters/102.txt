Chapter 104: Why Should Things That Were Given Out Be Returned?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

The two of them went to the door with sullen faces.

“Wait.”

When they reached the door, Qiao Mianmian stopped them.

Bai Xiao turned around and said fiercely, “What else do you want to say?”

Qiao Mianmian’s lips hooked up, her gaze lowered and fell on the bag in Bai Xiao’s hand, and she said casually, “You can go, but leave the items behind. My boyfriend thought that we have a good relationship, that’s why he gave you a gift. You and I are not friends anymore. Please give back the gifts he gave you.”

When Bai Xiao and Zhang Yuwei were leaving, they took that set of skincare products too.

“Hehe, I thought you were so noble. You kept nitpicking where others were wrong here and there, how can you still have the face to take away things given by others. Where is your pride?” Jiang Luoli was very angry at the two of them and naturally would not let go of this opportunity to ridicule them.

The expressions of the two people changed.

Zhang Yuwei was prideful and threw the bag on the ground coldly. “I’ll give it back to you. I don’t need it.”

Bai Xiao was reluctant to return.

She straightened up. “Why should things that were given out be returned? This set of cosmetics you gave me is mine. As for what I want to do with it, it’s my own business.”

Jiang Luoli was shocked by her shamelessness.

Even Qiao Mianmian felt that she had truly understood these two roommates who had lived with her for three years fully today.

After Bai Xiao finished speaking, she carried the bag and took Zhang Yuwei’s hand before leaving.

...

“Ridiculous!”

Watching the two walk out, Jiang Luo couldn’t help but burst out. “I didn’t expect Bai Xiao to be so shameless. I never knew she was like this. And Zhang Yuwei, she has such a dark heart.”

“Three years in the same room with them. Looks like I didn’t know them at all.”

“Me too.” Qiao Mianmian’s lips turned up into a hook and she laughed at herself. “I originally thought that even if I can’t stay good friends with them, we could still be civil. It seems that I was too naive.”

She should be thankful to Mo Yesi.

After all, his meal let her see through these two clearly.

“Mianmian, don’t be sad. You should be glad that you saw through them in time. You don’t need to waste your time and feelings on them anymore in the future.”

“Yea, I know.” Qiao Mianmian was not very upset, just a little bit disappointed.

They were not very close friends in the first place.

As Jiang Luoli said, she should be glad that she saw their true colors during the meal.

“Now...” Jiang Luoli looked at the table full of dishes, her face showing a pained expression. “So many dishes, how can the two of us finish eating everything.”

Qiao Mianmian also frowned.

Compared to Jiang Luoli, she felt even more pained.

After all, it was she who was going to pay for everything. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

...

A large table of dishes, even if the two of them stuffed themselves, there would still be a lot left.

Finally, Qiao Mianmian called for a waiter to pack the few dishes that had not been touched by them.

She was a little embarrassed when packing.

If you could afford to come to such a high-end place, no one would pack the remaining dishes.

She was definitely the first for daring to ask for the food to be packed.

The waiter froze when he heard that she was going to pack the remaining food, but he quickly said respectfully, “Okay, Miss Qiao, please wait.”

After packing, the two went to the counter to pay.

The cashier smiled. “Miss Qiao, someone has already paid for you.”

Qiao Mianmian was stunned. “It has been paid?”
