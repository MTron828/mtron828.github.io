Chapter 258: Aunt Mo, Did I Say Something Wrong?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Shen Rou felt good when she saw how unhappy Madam Mo looked.

As long as Madam Mo didn’t like Qiao Mianmian, she wouldn’t have a good time in the Mo family.

She pretended to be in deep thought for a few seconds before saying, “I think Mianmian’s family isn’t so well off and she’s afraid that you won’t agree to her relationship with Ah Si. That’s why she wanted Ah Si to keep things quiet first.

“In that case, your disapprovals would be useless.”

“You mean, she made Ah Si do this?”

Shen Rou pursed her lips. “I know Ah Si, he isn’t the sort to disrespect his family. This shouldn’t be his own idea. He’s giving in to her now, so I suppose this is her idea.”

Madam Mo clenched her fist. “Ah Si places so much value in her?”

“Aunt Mo, if you were there on that day, you’d understand.” Shen Rou sighed. “Do you know, Ah Si actually fell out with Zeli over her. They’ve been good buddies for years, but it happened anyway.

“Ah Si and Zeli have never quarreled before, that night was probably their first. Ah Si is very protective of his wife and wouldn’t allow anyone to say anything negative about her.

“This is the first time I see Ah Si care so much for a person. To be honest, it’d be scary if Mianmian means more to him than his own mother.”

Shen Rou was smart enough to know what would agitate Madam Mo.

She also knew what mattered to Madam Mo and what didn’t.

As she guessed, Madam Mo was furious now.

“Aunt Mo, did I say something wrong?” She tugged at her arm and asked in concern. “Don’t be too upset, it’s just my speculation. Back then, you’d gone through so much to give birth to Ah Si... taking hundreds of jabs and lying in bed for close to a year... Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“Ah Si is a filial son, he surely sees you as the most important person in his life.”

Madam Mo kept silent.

Having achieved her goal, Shen Rou knew she didn’t have to say anything more.

She looked towards Qiao Mianmian again and saw Old Madam handing her a box. She didn’t have to see what it was inside to know that it must be an expensive gift.

A flicker of hatred flashed in her eyes as she quietly said, “Aunt Mo, no matter how angry you are now, you can’t show it. Otherwise, Old Madam would get angry at you.”

Madam Mo obviously knew that too.

She’d been holding back all this while precisely because Old Madam was present.

Otherwise, she would’ve chased that shameless woman out by now.

Shen Rou was right.

Her son wasn’t one to disrespect her.

He wouldn’t hide something as important as a marriage from them.

Hence, this must have been Qiao Mianmian’s idea.

Now, Madam Mo wasn’t just dissatisfied with Qiao Mianmian. She detested her.

And simply couldn’t tolerate her.

“Rou Rou, don’t worry.” Madam Mo took a deep breath and grabbed Shen Rou’s hand as she consoled her. “I want you as my daughter-in-law, and nobody else. Only you are good enough for my Ah Si.”

“But...” Shen Rou looked hurt. “Ah Si is already married.”
