Jiang Luoli told her the address.

When they arrived, Qiao Mianmian got out of the car. Qiao Chen waved at her. “Sister, see you tonight.”

“Mm, see you tonight.”

The car window rolled up slowly.

Qiao Chen only retracted his gaze when it was completely closed.

“Young Master, are we going to the office next?” the driver asked.

“No.” Qiao Chen narrowed his eyes. “Let’s go to the Spring Cold Cemetery.”

The chauffeur was stunned. “Yes, Young Master.”

The Spring Cold Cemetery was where Qiao Chen’s mother was buried.

Qiao Chen recalled the woman in the photo on the tombstone. She looked weak, but she was as beautiful as a goddess.

That was his biological mother, Lin Hua.

That year, Lin Hua shouldn’t have left this world so early.

Even though she was terminally ill, her condition was under control.

If not...

Qiao Chen clenched his fists. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

He wouldn’t let the person who harmed his mother off.

He wouldn’t let any of them off.

...

Jiang Luoli was already living with Mo Shixiu. The address she gave Qiao Mianmian was where Mo Shixiu lived.

The door slowly opened.

At the same time, a silver Rolls-Royce stopped outside.

The car door was pulled open, and Qiao Mianmian saw Jiang Luoli jump out.

“Baby.”

Jiang Luoli ran towards Qiao Mianmian.

They hugged.

Jiang Luoli was especially happy as she held Qiao Mianmian’s hand. “Baby, when did you arrive in Yuncheng City? Have you had lunch? Who sent you here, Prince Charming?”

Qiao Mianmian looked around as she followed her into the house. “Chen Chen. He made lunch for me.”

“Chen Chen?” Jiang Luoli looked out. “Is he gone?”

“Mm, he has something on, so he left first.”

“This kid is so busy now, he didn’t even say hi to me before leaving. Is he looking down on us small fry because he’s the Young Master of the Mo family now?” Jiang Luo joked.

She had already heard from Mo Shixiu that Qiao Chen was the flesh and blood of the Mo family.

The Mo family had organized a grand return banquet for him tonight. Mo Shixiu wanted her to attend the banquet with him, but she was still hesitating whether she should go.

“You know Chen Chen isn’t such a person. He really has something on.”

“Hahaha, I’m kidding,” Jiang Luoli replied to Mo Shixiu’s message as she walked.

Mo Shixiu was very busy most of the time.

That day, when he was watching a movie with Jiang Luoli, he took the time to date.

But whenever he had time, he would take the initiative to send Jiang Luoli a message.

When they weren’t together, they could only rely on chatting to maintain their relationship.

Qiao Mianmian saw that she was on WeChat and smiled. “Did Big Brother message you?”

“Mm.” Jiang Luoli said in a disdainful tone, “Do you think he looks especially cold? It’s obvious that he doesn’t like to talk to others. I never thought that he would be so clingy and chat with me every day.”

“Isn’t it good to be a little clingy? He only takes the initiative to chat with you every day because he cares about you. Do you want to be ignored?” Qiao Mianmian was worried that Jiang Luoli and Mo Shixiu weren’t suitable, but now she felt that she was overthinking.
