Chapter 2576: Falling for It Without any Respect

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

He was no longer unapproachable.

It was the most common style, but it looked especially good on him.

Su Su blinked and her eyelashes trembled. She glanced at his unusually fair and handsome face and her heart raced.

Mr. Gong was really good-looking.

She had never seen a better-looking man.

She knew that she shouldn’t have fallen for him.

They were from two different worlds. If she liked him, nothing good would come of it.

But she couldn’t control herself.

Even if she knew that once she fell into it, she might not be able to escape, she still fell for him.

She didn’t expect too much. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

She was already very happy and satisfied to be able to stay by his side and see him often.

She was willing to be his substitute for the rest of her life.

But her eyes dimmed when she thought about what Yan Shaoqing said.

Was it a dream to be by his side?

…

An hour later.

Yan Shaoqing called for a pause.

“Stop, stop. I’m so tired. Let me rest for 10 minutes before continuing.”

His face was full of sweat. He threw his club to the attendant at the side and took a bottle of cold mineral water from the beauty he brought. He drank half a bottle.

On the other side.

Gong Zeli looked more relaxed than him.

There was no sweat on his face, and his breathing was steady. It didn’t look like he had just played golf for an hour.

Gong Zeli handed the club to the attendant calmly.

He glanced at Yan Shaoqing and smiled. “You’re so young, but your body is already so weak. I advise you to control yourself. Otherwise, you’ll be completely useless in a few years.”

“What useless? I’m healthy. You’re the useless one. Your whole family is useless.”

How could a man tolerate being thought of as weak?

Yan Shaoqing immediately rebutted.

Gong Zeli ignored him and sat down. “You lost the match just now. Do you still want to compete with me?”

“Of course, we have to compete. It’s too early to say who won or lost. Don’t forget that we agreed on three rounds to decide the winner.” Yan Shaoqing was already badly abused in the first round, but he wouldn’t admit defeat just like that.

How embarrassing.

Even if he lost, he had to lose fair and square!

“Alright, I’ll make you admit defeat.” Gong Zeli smiled.

“Mr. Gong, have some water.” Su Su took a cup of tea from the attendant and placed it in front of him. “The temperature is just right.”

Gong Zeli looked up at her. “Why aren’t you playing? Didn’t I arrange for a coach to teach you?”

Su Su pursed her lips. “I-I can’t learn it well. It’s the same when I watch Mr. Gong play with Young Master Yan.”

“If you’re bored, go back first.” Gong Zeli looked into her eyes and softened his voice. “I’ll get the chauffeur to pick you up for dinner tonight.”

“Not at all..”
