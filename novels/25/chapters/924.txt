Chapter 925: Did Someone Say Something to You?

The way he addressed her was so affectionate and alluring.

Qiao Mianmian’s heart started pounding.

“Baby, do you know that I’m really happy that you’re telling me this today?” Mo Yesi kissed the back of her hand and looked up at her tenderly. “To me, being able to give you happiness is something I’ve been pursuing. If I make you feel happy, that means I’ve succeeded, right?

“This is the most fulfilling thing I’ve ever done. Perhaps I’m not doing well enough now, but I’ll continue to work hard and give you more happiness in the future. I’ll make sure you never regret marrying me.”

He couldn’t hide his joy.

It was obvious.𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Qiao Mianmian could tell that he was really happy.

He looked like a child who had been acknowledged.

He said that this was the most fulfilling thing for him.

He even said that he wasn’t doing well enough and that he would work even harder in the future.

But to her, he was already doing well enough.

He was too good, so good that she started to worry.

She was worried that they might break up one day.

She was worried that he wouldn’t be so nice to her one day.

She was still worried... about a lot of things.

Once she started to care, she started to worry about her gains and losses.

She was afraid of losing him.

And she had never felt such emotions before.

“Mo Yesi, no matter what happens, you won’t leave me?” Qiao Mianmian asked softly.

The man nodded without hesitation. “I’ll never leave you.”

“Then, what if...” Qiao Mianmian thought about Madam Mo and hesitated to say it.

“If what?”

“What if someone doesn’t like us and objects to us being together?”

“Mm? What has it got to do with us whether others like us or not? Moreover, who’s to object to our relationship? Baby, no one has the right to interfere or object to my decision.”

Mo Yesi looked at her thoughtfully. “Baby, why are you suddenly asking this? Did someone say something to you?”

“No, I’m just asking casually.” Qiao Mianmian decided not to tell him about Madam Mo. He and Madam Mo had already had a conflict, and if she told him about it again, it might cause another conflict between them.

This wasn’t what she wanted to see.

After Madam Mo spoke to her that time, there wasn’t anything else.

She decided to observe for a while.

If Madam Mo caused any more trouble, she would decide whether to tell Mo Yesi.

Mo Yesi looked at her deeply again, not believing that she was just asking casually.

He narrowed his eyes and thought for a while. Although he still had doubts in his heart, he didn’t continue asking.

Since she didn’t want to say it, he couldn’t get anything out of her.

“Let’s eat first.” Qiao Mianmian avoided his probing gaze and picked up a piece of chicken. “This is my specialty, but I haven’t made it in a long time. Try it and see how it tastes.”
