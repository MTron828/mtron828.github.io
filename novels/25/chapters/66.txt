Chapter 67: Just a Nobody

Didn’t someone say Qiao Mianmian and Su Ze were no longer together?

Did Su Ze get sentimental? Did he still have feelings for her, that was why he brought men along to help her out?

Jiang Luoli thought it was Su Ze who called them here too.

She patted herself on the chest and thought that Su Ze wasn’t too bad a guy. At least this time, they had managed to escape unscathed with his help.

Otherwise, the consequences could have been dire.

She hurriedly went to Qiao Mianmian and helped her up. “Mianmian, are you alright?”

Qiao Mianmian shook her head.

Standing opposite them, Shen Yueyue and Du Ze were in shock.

They looked at the men lying on the floor and groaning in pain. Shen Yueyue’s lips trembled with fear. “W-Who are you people?”

Nobody had expected this random group of people to be here for Qiao Mianmian.

Shen Yueyue herself was also astonished.

Didn’t Qiao Anxin tell her that Su Ze and Qiao Mianmian were no longer together and that she could insult Qiao Mianmian however she wanted?

Then what was with these people?

Besides Su Ze, who else could Qiao Mianmian rely on for help?

Or, was Qiao Anxin having her on?

At that moment, Shen Yueyue went pale.

One of the men clad in black looked at her coldly. “Are you Miss Qiao’s schoolmate? You’re the one who brought these people here to create trouble for her?”

“I-I am. W-What are you going to do?” Shen Yueyue took a step back towards Du Ze.

Du Ze was also frightened by their moves but was trying to put up a strong front. “Damn you. Where are you from? How dare you come after me, don’t you know who I am?”

“I’m not interested in knowing who you are. But if you bother Miss Qiao again, you’re courting death.” With that he ordered the other bodyguards. “Break the legs of the guys and take the girls away.”

“How dare you! I’m the only son of Sheng Hui Corporation’s chairman! If you dare lay a finger on me, my dad won’t let you off!”

“Sheng Hui Corporation?” The leader of the bodyguards sneered condescendingly. “That’s just a nobody. If I break both your legs here today, do you think your dad would dare do anything in the future?”

Sheng Hui Corporation was a renowned medium-sized enterprise in Yuncheng City.

It was rather reputable, actually.

But in comparison to the Mo Firm, they weren’t even fit to wipe the feet of Chairman Mo. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Having been arrogant for so long, he didn’t even know what sort of trouble he had brought to his family because of his foolishness.

Breaking his legs was already showing him mercy.

Chairman Mo wasn’t so kind.

For all they knew, Sheng Hui Corporation might just disappear from Yuncheng City soon.

Two bodyguards stepped forward to hold him.

He waved the dagger before them and growled. “Get away from me, or else!”

“If you dare lay a finger on me, I will...” Du Ze’s yelling came to a sudden stop.

The next moment, he let out a loud groan. “Ah, my leg, my leg...”

The bodyguard easily took the knife away for him and kept him down.

They then kicked his knee hard.

Du Ze went pale in the split moment and with a “bam—”, his knees hit the ground. He grabbed his leg and cried in agony.
