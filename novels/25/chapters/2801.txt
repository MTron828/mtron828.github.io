Chapter 2804: Step Forward to Smooth Things Over

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Damn Zhan Bo.

To defend Qiao Mianmian and speak up for her, he actually humiliated her in public!

She would definitely return this humiliation in the future!

He was just a newbie in the entertainment industry.

Calling him a senior was too much.

Did he really think he was so great that he could teach her a lesson?

She held it in.

Let him show off.

When she achieved her goal, she wouldn’t even care about ten of them, let alone one.

Qiao Anxin hated Zhan Bo to the core, but she still had to pretend to be humble. She bit her lip and looked up slightly, her eyes slightly red. “Thank you for your guidance, Senior Zhan. I remember every word you said. I know I made a mistake and made you unhappy. I’ll be careful in the future and never make such a mistake again.” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Zhan Bo was already unhappy with her. Hearing that made him even more uncomfortable.

Why did it seem like he was really bullying a newbie?

Moreover, who was she putting on this pitiful look for?

Did he want others to think that he was using his experience to bully a newbie like her?

Zhan Bo wasn’t a straight man who didn’t understand the tricks of the white lotus and green tea.

Who in the entertainment industry was simple?

Anyone who could make a name for themselves in the industry couldn’t be simple-minded.

What kind of tricks had he not seen before?

Qiao Anxin’s tricks made him even more disgusted and unhappy. He sneered and said without giving her any face, “I can’t be considered as a teacher. I’m not your superior, nor am I your family. I have no obligation to teach you, and there’s no need to waste my effort.”

He wasn’t giving Qiao Anxin any face.

How ungentlemanly.

But everyone knew that Zhan Bo was a gentleman who respected ladies. All the actresses who worked with him praised him and said that he was good at taking care of people.

Hence, everyone looked at him in shock now.

Everyone wondered how Zhan Bo became like this.

Why was he so aggressive towards this newbie?

Especially the male crew members. Seeing how pitiful Qiao Anxin looked, they couldn’t bear to see her like this.

It wasn’t necessary even if he wanted to defend Qiao Mianmian.

Did he not care about his reputation anymore?

Wasn’t he afraid of others saying that he was arrogant and bullying newbies?

Moreover, such words had already spread online.

It was just that this topic had just started, but it was suppressed by Zhan Bo’s company, so it didn’t cause much of a commotion.

But the rival companies wouldn’t let it go.

If he was still so cold to Jiang Xinyue and didn’t let her off, it would be disadvantageous to him if the competitors made use of this matter.

He wouldn’t be able to take it even if he was a top celebrity.

Wasn’t this the case with that popular male artiste?

He was so popular back then, but there was no news about him now.

Qiao Anxin couldn’t hold it in anymore.

She clenched her fists and bit her lip. She almost lost control of her temper.

Fortunately, Li Wei stepped forward to smooth things over.
