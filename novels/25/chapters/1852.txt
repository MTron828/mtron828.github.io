Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Zhao Yixiang: “I was there last night. I can guarantee that this Weibo post is indeed spreading rumors.”

Qiao Mianmian’s team immediately came out to speak up for her. After all, it was easier said than done.

Seeing that Shen Fei and the rest had stood up for Qiao Mianmian, it was impossible for them to remain silent.

They were all guests from the same program. Only a few of them did not express their thoughts. No one knew what the netizens would say.

Han Yan: “I was there last night, too. It’s really not what this Weibo post said. Everyone, be rational. Don’t be fooled so easily. This is deliberately spreading rumors to gain attention.”

Little Xiao: “Don’t believe rumors.”

Even Qiao Anxin stood out and posted on Weibo: “Waiting for the truth.”

Her post was rather intriguing.

Everyone else said it was a rumor, but she was “waiting for the truth”.

She made it sound like she wasn’t there last night.

There were a total of ten people on the team. Eight of them had already reposted it to show their support.

Soon, someone realized that only Song Ke didn’t.

After Shen Fei, Zhan Bo, and the rest posted on Weibo, the public opinion was quickly reversed. Some netizens started to believe that the person who leaked the news was spreading rumors and wanted to defame Qiao Mianmian.

“I believe my Sister Fei. If she says it’s a rumor, it must be a rumor.” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“So many people are saying that it’s a rumor, so the leak should be fake. This person is really shameless. In order to gain attention by defaming a girl like this, I think Qiao Mianmian must have offended someone.”

“I realized that Qiao Mianmian’s social relations are very good. So many people are standing up for her. I think this means that she must be a very good person. That’s why so many people are willing to stand up for her.”

“I found something very interesting. It seems like Song Ke is the only one who hasn’t expressed anything. Don’t you guys find it strange that she and Qiao Mianmian have some conflict?”

“Could it be that Song Ke didn’t see it? Maybe she’s still sleeping.”

“It can’t be. Song Ke just updated her Weibo ten minutes ago and posted a selfie. She said she was already up. It’s impossible that she didn’t see it.”

The sharp-eyed netizens noticed that Song Ke had logged into Weibo, but she didn’t repost it to help Qiao Mianmian.

...

At that moment, Song Ke was scrolling through Weibo.

She saw Shen Fei’s repost.

When she saw that Qiao Mianmian had reposted that Weibo post, saying that she would file a lawsuit and find out who did it, she panicked a little.

Because that Weibo post was sent by her.

She thought that she could use this incident to ruin Qiao Mianmian’s reputation, but she didn’t expect Shen Fei and the rest to stand up for her so quickly.

Not only Shen Fei, but everyone else also stood up for Qiao Mianmian.

Now, the situation had been turned around.

Song Ke also wanted to help Qiao Mianmian by reposting it, but she wasn’t that mentally strong.

If Qiao Mianmian found out who was behind this, would that person be afraid and reveal her?

In another room.

Qiao Anxin was extremely shocked when she saw the news.

Because someone actually did what she wanted to do.
