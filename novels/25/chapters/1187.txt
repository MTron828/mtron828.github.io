Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

The moment the official Weibo post was posted, Qiao Mianmian’s few fans were elated.

They could finally slap Little Xiao’s fans’ faces.

The comments section was flooded with comments: “6666, Qiao Mianmian die-hard fan’s moves are indeed extraordinary. He’s far better than that person.”

“I just can’t stand to see her fans jumping around. Haha, keep jumping around.”

“Did you guys see that anonymous person’s Weibo? He sent those ambulances under Qiao Mianmian’s name. Previously, someone said that he couldn’t bear to spend money on Qiao Mianmian, but he spent more than 10 million just like that.”

“The anonymous person posted something on Weibo. What did he post?”

Many curious people went to read the Weibo of the anonymous person.

Then, they were flaunted.

Nameless: “@QiaoMianmianV, I heard that I don’t spend money on you? Should I express my love? Wait for my gift.”

Not long after he posted this Weibo, he showed the 5.2 million in gifts from the live-stream room and the 50 ambulances that suddenly appeared.

It was clear that this was all his work.

The netizens in the comments section were all exclaiming how romantic it was, saying that they also wanted a boyfriend who doted on them like this.

A boyfriend who spent more than ten million yuan on gifts without saying a word.

...

Qiao Mianmian didn’t know that Mo Yesi had tagged her.

She was still at the event venue and had no time to check her phone.

When the event ended and she walked out of the venue, a reporter came over to interview her. “Hello, Ms. Qiao. I’m an entertainment reporter from Apple Daily. May I ask you a few questions?”

“Miss Qiao, I’m a reporter from Orange TV Entertainment. Can I interview you?”

In an instant, several reporters surrounded her.

Qiao Mianmian was stunned. It was her first time being interviewed by so many reporters, and she was both surprised and nervous.

When she looked at the camera, her eyes were filled with nervousness. “Interview me? What do you want to ask me?”

The reporter asked with a smile, “Miss Qiao has donated 50 ambulances at once. This can be said to be the highest number of individual donations since the charity event was held. There are rumors online that your boyfriend donated in your name. Is this true?”

“Fifty ambulances?” Qiao Mianmian was stunned again.

The reporters could tell from her expression that she was still unaware of this matter.

She was certain that the ambulance was not donated by her. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Then, her boyfriend must have donated it for her.

The reporter had a gossipy expression on his face. “Miss Qiao, don’t you know that another person donated 50 ambulances in your name? Also, someone just gave you a gift of 5.2 million in the live-stream.”

Qiao Mianmian: “!!!”

There was such a thing?

The reporter asked, “Miss Qiao, is that ‘Qiao Mianmian’s die-hard fan’ your boyfriend?”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

She didn’t know anything.

She looked at Nana in confusion.

Nana immediately said, “Sister Mianmian, when you were donating blood on stage just now, someone gave you a gift of 5.2 million yuan. That person claimed to be your die-hard fan.

“The ambulance incident is also true.”

Qiao Mianmian knew that she wouldn’t have such a rich die-hard fan.

She guessed that it must be Mo Yesi.

But why did he send fifty more ambulances in her name?
