Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Her heart raced uncontrollably as her gaze landed on him.

Gong Zeli knew that Shangguan Qing was there tonight.

Hence, he wasn’t surprised to see her standing behind Madam Gong.

His gaze went past Madam Gong and landed on Shangguan Qing. He narrowed his eyes and said with a faint smile, “Mom, there’s a guest at home tonight?”

Madam Gong sensed his gaze and looked behind her. She then smiled and said, “Yes, your Sister Qingqing is here. She heard that you were coming back tonight and made soup for you early in the morning. This child is really thoughtful. She has never cooked before, and she spent a lot of effort to make this soup for you.”

Madam Gong winked at her.

Shangguan Qing immediately understood and walked towards Gong Zeli with the bowl of soup. “Brother Zeli, you must be thirsty. This soup is iced, have a taste.”

Gong Zeli looked down and didn’t take it.

Shangguan Qing was still holding the bowl. She held it for a while, but Gong Zeli still didn’t take it. Her expression stiffened.

“Brother Zeli...” She couldn’t help but call out.

“Zeli, this is the soup that Qingqing made for you. Quickly take it and have a sip.” Madam Gong couldn’t help but say when he showed no reaction.

Gong Zeli looked up, but he still didn’t reach out to take the bowl. His tone was obviously distant. “Miss Shangguan, I’ve troubled you. But I’m not thirsty, you should drink it yourself.”

With that, he walked past her.

Shangguan Qing looked awful as she held the bowl of soup.

Madam Gong glanced at her and quickly comforted her. “Qingqing, Zeli might really not be thirsty. Hand the bowl to the servants, we’ll have dinner first.”

Shangguan Qing bit her lip. “Auntie, does Brother Zeli not like me here? I-I shouldn’t have come.”

“Who said so?” Madam Gong patted her head and comforted her gently. “Qingqing, don’t let your thoughts run wild. He’s usually like this, it’s not because of you. Alright, come with me.” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Shangguan Qing felt aggrieved, but she didn’t want Madam Gong to think that she was petty.

She had no choice but to follow her to the dining room.

...

Gong Zeli changed and went downstairs.

Madam Gong and Shangguan Qing were already sitting at the dining table.

When Madam Gong saw him, she waved at him. “Zeli, come and sit here.”

She got Gong Zeli to sit beside Shangguan Qing.

Gong Zeli glanced at her and smiled. He then sat opposite them.

Madam Gong frowned, but she didn’t say anything.

Shangguan Qing could tell that Gong Zeli was avoiding her. She bit her lip and felt wronged. Her eyes reddened.

A moment later.

The servant served dinner.

The table was filled with Gong Zeli’s favorite dishes.

Madam Gong picked up some food and placed it in his bowl. She looked at him lovingly and said, “Zeli, try this. I remember you like this dish a lot. Try it and see how it tastes.”

Gong Zeli picked up his chopsticks and took a bite.

Madam Gong immediately asked, “How is it? Is it good?”

“Mm, it’s alright.”

“Try this dish now.” Madam Gong picked up another dish and placed it in his bowl.
