Chapter 634: The Outcome Is up to You

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

It was rare for him to be so humble in front of Madam Mo.

Hence, Madam Mo was stunned when she heard his last sentence.

She looked at her son in shock and felt a mix of emotions when she saw how humble he was.

She knew her son better than anyone else.

In the past, he would do whatever he wanted.

He rarely cared about what others thought.

Including his biological mother.

When he was a child, she was able to influence him once or twice because he was too young and couldn’t be too independent.

But he gradually grew up.

Ever since he earned a huge sum of money when he was 13, it became hard for her to control him.

It was the same for marriage.

He could marry whoever he wanted.

He didn’t even inform them.

Besides accepting it, she couldn’t do anything to him.

Right now, he was completely capable of taking charge of things on his own. He was rather independent both mentally and physically.

She was even more... unable to control him.

This was the sort of person he was, and yet he had the audacity to ask for her help.

How could Madam Mo not be shocked?

But this change didn’t make her happy.

On the contrary, she felt as if something was pricking her heart.

It wasn’t because of her, but because of Qiao Mianmian.

Madam Mo kept quiet for a long time.

This was the first time her son was begging her so humbly. She couldn’t bear to reject him.

But she couldn’t accept Qiao Mianmian.

“Mom.” Mo Yesi waited for a while and looked at Madam Mo’s troubled expression. He thought for a while and said, “Qiao Mianmian is the woman I’ve chosen to be with me for my whole life. Whether you like her or not, I can’t possibly leave her.

“So, I hope you can slowly start to like her. That way, it’ll be easier for us to get along in the future.

“I don’t want a conflict between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law to happen in our family. I believe you know very well what the consequences are if this happens. If you really want this to happen, I can only choose not to bring her home.

“When that time comes, don’t think we’re unfilial.”

“What do you mean by that?” Madam Mo’s expression darkened. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Mo Yesi felt a little tired and rubbed his temple. “Mianmian is willing to get along with you, but if you don’t accept her, how do you expect her to get along with you? If bringing her home makes her unhappy every time, why would I do that?”

“Are you threatening me?” Madam Mo was so angry that she grabbed the sofa’s cushion.

Mo Yesi looked at her and said calmly, “Mom, you’re forcing me. The choice is in your hands. You can decide what outcome you want.”

At this point, he felt that there was no need to continue the conversation.

Under Madam Mo’s angry gaze, he slowly stood up.

“Mom, think about it. I won’t talk to you about this anymore.”

With that, he turned and left.

Madam Mo sat on the sofa with a dark expression. She watched as he walked out and slowly closed the door.
