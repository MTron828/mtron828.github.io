Chapter 1643: Tell Them She’s My Girlfriend

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Assistant Xu thought for a while and felt that his words were a little overboard, so he comforted him again. “You and the minister are too different in terms of strength. Miss Jiang will definitely choose the minister. This isn’t because you’re poor, but because you can’t compare to our Minister.”

Xie Zewen was speechless.

Please shut up, alright?

“Sigh, I can tell that you like Miss Jiang a lot. But don’t think about it anymore. You and Miss Jiang have no fate in this lifetime. If there’s a next lifetime... Forget it. If there’s a next lifetime, Miss Jiang will still be with our Minister. She can only be our Minister’s woman.

“Anyway, don’t keep thinking about this person.”

Xie Zewen was speechless.

This person was so annoying.

In the past, he often saw him going to various places with Mo Shixiu on television. He looked very serious.

Was he such a person in private?

He really couldn’t judge a book by its cover. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

...

Mo Shixiu flew back and forth several times. When he arrived at Jiang Luoli’s city, it was already very late.

He didn’t have time to bring Jiang Luoli back to Yuncheng City.

This was the first time Mo Shixiu felt threatened by Jiang Luoli’s situation and wasn’t willing to let her go back alone.

He got Assistant Xu to give Jiang Luoli a week off.

Jiang Luoli’s internship period was approaching, and she rarely went to school now. Moreover, Mo Shixiu wanted to help her take leave. Not to mention a week of vacation, even a year of vacation was easy.

Assistant Xu applied for leave and told Mo Yesi.

With that, he hesitated and asked, “Minister, you’ve helped Miss Jiang take a week off. Are you planning to take her on a business trip?”

In the study room of the hotel.

Mo Shixiu was reading a document. He looked up at him and nodded. “Mm, I have such a plan. So, arrange it and change my schedule to two people.”

Assistant Xu was speechless.

Mo Shixiu really made this decision.

At that moment, his expression was a little indescribable.

He realized that what he was worried about was already happening.

Their wise minister, who never took women seriously, was really blinded by love.

From the moment he put down everything and came here to look for Jiang Luoli, to the moment he decided to take her overseas for a business trip, all these actions were abnormal.

This was something he would never have done in the past!

Jiang Luoli was really impressive.

How long had she been with their minister? How could she be so obsessed with him?

“Minister, are you sure you want to bring Miss Jiang along? If that’s the case, I’m afraid it’ll be inconvenient for your upcoming schedule. Moreover, you have a few private banquets on your trip this time. When the time comes, are you going to bring Miss Jiang along too?

“If anyone asks about your relationship with Miss Jiang, you...”

Mo Shixiu didn’t hesitate. “I’ll introduce her to them as my girlfriend.”

Assistant Xu was speechless.

Forget it, pretend he didn’t ask.

He’d already decided to bring her over, so he definitely hadn’t thought of hiding her.

Those private banquets were said to be private, but in fact, the people there were of special status.

No female companions were allowed to attend the banquet.
