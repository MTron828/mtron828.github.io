Chapter 2729: Be My Secretary for a Few Days

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Mo Yesi gently brushed a strand of hair off her forehead. “Mianmian, listen carefully. We’ll never get a divorce. Moreover, didn’t I say it before, how can you be sure that it’s your problem?

“Don’t let your thoughts run wild. We’ll definitely be fine. Didn’t you say that we should let nature take its course? The more anxious we are, the worse it will be. If you’re really worried, I’ll accompany you to the hospital tomorrow.

“Moreover, even if one of us really has a problem, medicine is so advanced now, it can still be treated. Why do you have to think of the worst?”

Qiao Mianmian leaned into his arms and felt much more relaxed.

That’s right.

Medicine was very advanced nowadays.

Even if she and Mo Yesi really had a problem, they could still take medicine to recuperate.

Weren’t there many infertile couples who relied on medication to recover?

She and Mo Yesi were still young.

It wouldn’t be too late to give birth in a few years.

Mo Shixiu only had a child at 30.

Mo Yesi wasn’t even 28.

At this thought, Qiao Mianmian finally felt better. She nodded. “Mm, then I won’t overthink it.”

“You shouldn’t have thought about it.” Mo Yesi pinched her cheek. “You feel better now, don’t you?”

“Mm, much better.” Qiao Mianmian nodded again.

“I think you’re thinking too much because you have nothing to do at home. Why don’t you come to work with me tomorrow and be my secretary for a few days? That way, you won’t have to think too much.” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“Work with you?” Qiao Mianmian was stunned.

“Mm, you don’t have to wake up with me in the morning. You can go to the office after you’ve had enough sleep. Your time in the office is free, too. You can rest anytime if you’re tired, and you can also get off work early.”

Qiao Mianmian was tempted.

She did feel a little bored recently.

In the past, she could always ask Jiang Luoli out for a meal.

But now that Jiang Luoli was taking care of her child, Qiao Mianmian couldn’t ask her out anymore.

As for the others…

Linda was taking care of newbies, and her schedule was packed every day, so it was naturally difficult to ask her out.

As one of the top-tier celebrities in the industry, Zhan Bo’s schedule was even more packed. From what he said, his work schedule was already packed for the next year.

Qiao Chen also went overseas to university.

At that moment, Qiao Mianmian couldn’t even ask anyone out for a meal.

She used to want to rest when she was busy, but it was too boring to be idle.

“Then, what do I have to do as your secretary?”

“Professional secretaries will do the complicated work. You just have to do something simple.”

“Simple means…”

“Make coffee, make tea, and read some simple documents. Ask me if you don’t understand anything. Have lunch with me and chat with me when I’m upset. You can do this, right?”

“Yes, of course.” Qiao Mianmian nodded immediately. “I can do all of that.. But will I delay your work if I accompany you to work every day?”
