Chapter 815: Don’t Look for Me Again

“I’ll take the cheque. As for the rest, forget it. Go back and tell him that he doesn’t have to feel sorry for me. Although his skills are terrible and it makes me feel terrible, I won’t blame him for that 50 million.

“We’ll be strangers from now on.”

“Cough, cough, cough.” Assistant Xu widened his eyes and coughed violently.

He stared at Jiang Luoli in disbelief as if she was a monster.

In fact, in Assistant Xu’s heart, Jiang Luoli was really like a monster now.

He’d never seen a woman talk about such private matters in public.

And she looked so nonchalant.

It was as if they were discussing the weather.

Moreover, what was even more intolerable was that she actually said that the Minister’s skills were terrible!

Alright, last night was the minister’s first time.

It was the first time that a man was inexperienced, so it was inevitable that he would perform a little badly.

But how could she say it out loud?

He wasn’t giving the minister any face at all.

“Miss Jiang, I’m afraid it’s inappropriate for you to say this.” Assistant Xu was so angry that his mouth was crooked. “This is such a private matter, how could Miss Jiang... say it like this. Isn’t it too much to slander our master behind his back?

“Master must have treated you well. Do you think anyone else could have gotten this much?”

Jiang Luoli’s smile faded when she heard this.

Assistant Xu acted as if he didn’t see it and continued to say indignantly, “Moreover, Master wants to give you some more compensation now. Master treats you so well, but you’re slandering him like this. You’re really too much.

“Do you know who my master is? Do you know how many women want to sleep with him? Do you know how lucky you were last night? Hmph, let me tell you, if last night was purely an accident, it’d be fine. But if I find out that you deliberately approached my master, don’t blame me for being nasty.”

As long as they found out that she did it on purpose.

Even if his master really liked this woman, he wouldn’t go easy on her.

Protecting his master’s safety was the most important thing to him.

Nothing else mattered.

He had to settle everything that threatened his master’s safety.

Jiang Luoli was amused by Assistant Xu’s threat. “Oh, I want to know how you’re going to be so rude to me. Also, your master is such a powerful person. Glasses, let me tell you. It’s their business what other women do. I’m not interested in your master at all.

“His skills are so terrible, and there are so many women who want to sleep with him? Ha, are you sure you’re telling the truth?

“I’m not in the mood or with the time to talk nonsense with you. His skills are terrible, why can’t he let others say it? He knows best whether I slandered him or not.

“I don’t want to have anything to do with you anymore. Don’t look for me anymore.”

With that, Jiang Luoli left with Qiao Mianmian.

“Jiang Luoli, stop right there. Who were you calling Glasses, you rude, uncultured, and shameless woman.”

Jiang Luoli had already walked a distance away when she heard Assistant Xu yelling behind her.
