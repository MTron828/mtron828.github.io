Chapter 863: Surprise After the Shock

Qiao Mianmian wasn’t prepared.

She was so nervous.

She actually didn’t have much hope for this audition, even though Bai Yusheng said she was talented and that she was the person Mo Nan had been looking for.

But she could feel that Mo Nan didn’t seem to like her very much.

Moreover, a musician of Mo Nan’s level had very high expectations.

She didn’t think that he would be satisfied with an amateur like her who hadn’t studied the relevant fields.

But Bai Yusheng was doing this out of goodwill, and he wanted to help her. No matter what, she felt that she should try her best.

After a few seconds of silence, she took a deep breath and tried to calm herself down. “Mm, I’m... ready.”

“Come with me, then.”

Mo Nan turned around and walked towards a room, pushing the door open.

Qiao Mianmian followed.

This was a room similar to a recording studio. There were all kinds of recording facilities.

Mo Nan turned on the recording device and looked up at her. “Sing a random song first, I’ll listen to the sound quality.”

“Alright.”

Qiao Mianmian walked to the microphone and picked a song she liked.

She was so nervous before the audition.

But when the audition officially started, she relaxed.

She felt that she wouldn’t be chosen anyway, what was there to be nervous about.

She just had to act as casually as possible.

With this thought in mind, she relaxed and was no longer nervous or afraid.

As for Mo Nan.

He thought that Bai Yusheng wanted him to support his little lover, so he didn’t take Qiao Mianmian too seriously.

Getting her to audition was just a formality for Bai Yusheng.

But the moment Qiao Mianmian started singing, his nonchalant expression changed.

He didn’t even look Qiao Mianmian in the eye at first, but now he looked up at her in shock.

Qiao Mianmian sang acapella.

Hence, he could tell what her original voice was like.

When she sang the first line, Mo Nan’s heart surged with excitement. After the shock, it was a pleasant surprise.

He suppressed his joy and stood up when she finished singing the whole song.

Bai Yusheng turned around and glanced at him. He smiled as if he had expected it.

He and Mo Nan had been friends for many years.

How could he not know what kind of voice he wanted?

He brought Qiao Mianmian here partly to help this little girl, but more importantly, Qiao Mianmian’s voice moved him.

Otherwise, he wouldn’t have brought her here just because he liked her.

When Qiao Mianmian finished singing, she looked up and met Mo Nan’s bright eyes. She was stunned and felt a little uncomfortable from being stared at. She smiled politely and said, “Teacher Mo, I’m done singing. If there’s anything wrong, please guide me.”

“Can you sing another song?” Mo Nan took a deep breath and tried not to get too agitated. He didn’t want to embarrass himself in front of such a junior. He looked straight at Qiao Mianmian and asked, “Do you know how to sing ‘You Are the Four Moons of the World’?”

This song was written by him to Sun Fei.

He wrote the lyrics and melody. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

As this song had a higher pitch and a lot of variations, it was difficult to sing it.
