Chapter 2334: What Else Do You Want to Do?

“If nothing goes wrong, he should be promoted by the end of this month.”

Gu Sheng was speechless.

Bastard!

She gritted her teeth. “Chairman Mo isn’t the sort to fire his own employees just because someone else asked!”

“Mm, indeed not.” Bai Yusheng said in an annoying tone, “Of course, my words aren’t that useful. But if my sister asks, he’ll definitely agree.

“My brother-in-law is a very principled person, but he doesn’t have any principles in front of my sister. So, as long as my sister asks, there’s nothing he can’t agree to.

“He can even give up his relationship with the Gong family, let alone a mere executive. Gu Sheng, if your brother loses his job because of you, will you feel guilty?”

“Bai Yusheng, you…” Furious, Gu Sheng pointed at and scolded him. “How can you be so despicable? The Young Master of the Bai family is using such despicable means to threaten someone. Aren’t you ashamed?”

Bai Yusheng smirked. “What’s there to be ashamed about? If you think I’m despicable, then so be it. Anyway, I’ve never been a gentleman. Gu Sheng, this isn’t our first time meeting, right?”

Gu Sheng knew that Bai Yusheng wasn’t a gentleman.

She knew it when he was still her teacher.

But Bai Yusheng had never been so shameless.

He had never threatened her with anything.

This wasn’t like him at all.

Gu Sheng couldn’t help but wonder what happened to him when she was overseas.

Why did he become like this?

He became… a stranger.

“Let’s go. Don’t look as if I’m going to eat you up. I’m just asking you to make me a meal. It’s not too much to ask you to make a meal for your teacher, right?”

Gu Sheng was speechless.

She glared at Bai Yusheng.

It wasn’t a big deal for a student to cook for her teacher.

But which teacher would threaten their student?

Moreover, he’d only taught her for a semester. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

And it was an elective class.

He was barely a teacher. There was still a gap between him and a real teacher.

“Is a meal really enough?” Gu Sheng stood still at the same spot, looking at him cautiously.

She didn’t believe that Bai Yusheng brought her here just to make him a meal.

This reason was too ridiculous.

Did the Young Master of the Bai family lack someone to cook for him?

But Gu Sheng couldn’t think of any other reason.

She wasn’t worried that Bai Yusheng would do anything to her.

Back then, Bai Yusheng was drunk that night. He even pushed her away decisively.

He rejected her when she threw herself at him.

How could he have any feelings for her now?

“Otherwise?” Bai Yusheng raised an eyebrow. “What else do you want to do?”

He sounded ambiguous.

Gu Sheng blushed. “Bai Yusheng!”

“I’m hungry.” Bai Yusheng frowned, looking a little impatient. “It’s just a meal, I’ll let you go if you let me eat my fill.”
