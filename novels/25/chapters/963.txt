Chapter 966: You’re No Different From Other Men

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Why are you saying this to me?

“In the end, even you are leaving me because of that vixen?” She gritted her teeth as she said this.

It was Qiao Mianmian again.

Why did that slut steal the man she loved the most, and now the only person who cared about her?

Was she going to stop only when she had nothing left?

She really hated her.

She’d never hated someone so much.

She’d been indulged and pampered since she was a child. She was the Young Lady of the Shen family, and from the moment she was born, her status allowed her to live as she wished.

She could get anything she wanted.

It could be said that the only setback she’d encountered in the past 20-odd years was Mo Yesi.

Besides that, she could get whatever she wanted.

But now... her life was ruined because of Qiao Mianmian.

She was just a cheap girl from a humble family. What right did she have to fight with her!

Was she worthy of fighting with her!

What else did this slut have besides that foxy face?

Was that face really that important?

She’d thought that the men around her were all different, at least not the superficial sort.

But who knew that all men were the same.

A woman only needed a pretty face to get what she wanted.

Mo Yesi was like this.

Gong Zeli was the same.

They were so superficial.

Was face really that important?

In all aspects, she was better than Qiao Mianmian. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

She’d liked Mo Yesi for over 20 years, but she wasn’t his final choice.

He would rather marry a woman he hadn’t known for long rather than accept her.

Now, even the man who was always by her side and said that he would treat her well for the rest of his life had a change of heart.

Years of feelings couldn’t compare to a vixen’s face.

“Gong Zeli, I didn’t expect you to be such a superficial man.” Shen Rou was furious. She felt that her pride had been dealt a huge blow and couldn’t help but mock him. “You’ve taken a liking to that vixen too, right?

“What do you like about her? Do you like her vixen-like face, or do you like the thrill of lusting after your brother’s wife? You’re not picky at all. You can even like someone else’s wife, why didn’t I know you had such a weird fetish?”

Shen Rou’s words were harsh.

She couldn’t accept losing to a woman who was inferior to her in everything.

The man she liked and the man that liked her were both taken away by the same woman.

And this woman was the kind she despised the most.

How could someone as arrogant as her bear to lose to such a woman?

Looking at Gong Zeli’s darkened expression as he felt the anger and bitterness in her heart. “It’s funny that I actually believed your promises in the past. I thought you’d really treat me well for the rest of your life and only like me.

“So, you’re no different from other men. It must have been hard on you to pretend to be devoted all these years.”

“I pretended to be devoted?” Gong Zeli finally couldn’t help but sneer. “No matter how well I pretend, how can I be better than you? Yes, I did promise you that I would treat you well and take care of you for the rest of my life.”
