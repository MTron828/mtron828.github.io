Chapter 2421: She Didn’t Hit Him

“That’s not what I meant.” Qiao Mianmian pinched his cheek and smiled. “I’m not familiar with her, why would I ask you to bring her with you?”

“Then don’t talk about her anymore.” Mo Yesi didn’t have a good impression of Lin Wanwan. “Let’s eat.”

He looked at the food on the table but didn’t move. He pinched the tip of her nose gently. “Didn’t I tell you not to wait for me?”

“I’m not very hungry. I was waiting for you. It’s so boring to eat alone.”

The two of them leaned against each other and chatted.

Qiao Mianmian suddenly felt a resentful gaze on her. She turned around and saw Lin Wanwan standing a few tables away.

Her eyes and half of her face were swollen. She looked at her with tears in her eyes.

The moment their eyes met, the resentment in Lin Wanwan’s eyes deepened. It was as if she was looking at an enemy.

Qiao Mianmian was shocked.

Her shock came from Lin Wanwan’s inexplicable hostility and resentment towards her.

Besides that night, she didn’t have much contact with her.

But why was the girl looking at her that way?

It was as if she’d done something wrong.

For example, stealing her lover.

“What’s wrong?” Mo Yesi looked at Qiao Mianmian’s unusual expression and followed her gaze. When he saw that Lin Wanwan was still standing at the same spot and staring at Qiao Mianmian with red eyes, his eyes narrowed and his aura became dangerous.

Lin Wanwan was shocked by his warning. She immediately retracted her gaze and left.

“Mo Yesi, did you really help her?” Qiao Mianmian looked at him suspiciously.

“Mm.” Mo Yesi nodded. “What’s wrong?”

“Lin Wanwan… is she alright?”

“I’m fine. It was just a slap.” Mo Yesi didn’t know why she mentioned Lin Wanwan again, but he still answered her.

“That’s all?” Qiao Mianmian frowned.

“Mm, that’s all. Baby, what are you trying to say?” Mo Yesi smiled and rubbed her head. “Don’t beat around the bush with me, alright?”

“I thought she was… what.” Qiao Mianmian was puzzled by Lin Wanwan’s look. “She looked at me with resentment as if I’d done something to her. I thought she was alright.”

Even if Lin Wanwan was slapped, she wasn’t the one who slapped her.

Qiao Mianmian didn’t know why Lin Wanwan was so hostile towards her.

But Mo Yesi knew.

Shen Rou was an example.

Hence, even though Lin Wanwan was still young, Mo Yesi immediately distanced himself when he realized that she had such thoughts.

If it wasn’t because of Qiao Mianmian, he would never have helped Lin Wanwan.

“Don’t bother about her, she’s not important.” Mo Yesi stroked her head and picked up a fork and knife from the table. Then, he cut a steak and fed it to her. “Aren’t you hungry? Eat first.”

Although Qiao Mianmian found Lin Wanwan strange, she didn’t think too much about it.

Just as Mo Yesi said, she was indeed unimportant.
