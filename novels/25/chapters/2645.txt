Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“The Mo Corporation’s official Weibo account just sent a lawyer’s letter. They want to sue Song Fei’s fans. Once the Mo Corporation’s elite legal team sues someone, the lawsuit will definitely be lost.”

“Sisters, the Golden Globe Awards has released the link for the voting for Qiao Mianmian and Song Fei. Everyone, quickly go and vote!”

“The voting link is out? Give it to me, I want to vote for Qiao Mianmian.”

“I want to vote for Qiao Mianmian, too!”

…

The emcee gave them five minutes to vote.

Five minutes later, the results were out.

On the big screen was a row of red and blue numbers.

Song Fei was blue, and Qiao Mianmian was red.

It was a real-time vote.

The red numbers representing Qiao Mianmian kept increasing. Song Fei could keep up at first, but a minute later, she was overtaken by Qiao Mianmian.

In the end, Qiao Mianmian’s number of votes exceeded Song Fei’s.

Song Fei’s 28% of votes was all because of her fans.

After the voting results were out, Song Fei looked at the two sets of data on the big screen. Her face went pale, and she was like a deflated eggplant, unable to say a word.

Not only did she lose, but she even lost terribly.

Song Fei thought that the judges were bribed, so she chose to compete with Qiao Mianmian.

Now, she could no longer say anything.

The truth was right there.

Qiao Mianmian was indeed better than her.

Even if Song Fei didn’t want to admit it, even if she hated Qiao Mianmian, she knew very well the difference between them. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Whether it was acapella or not, it didn’t matter if the song she chose was too simple.

She couldn’t even compare to Qiao Mianmian.

If Qiao Mianmian participated in the talent show competition with her in the same episode, she would definitely be the champion.

It was precisely because Song Fei knew that she wasn’t as good as Qiao Mianmian that she felt especially embarrassed standing on stage.

She questioned the judges’ decision and requested another round of voting.

But in the end… she was slapped in the face.

Everything was different from what she expected.

In her imagination, she should be the one to win, proving that her doubts were right. Then, she would gain the support and understanding of the netizens and stand on stage to receive the award that should have belonged to her.

But why was it like this now?

“Alright, now that the voting has ended, the results are being shown on the big screen. We can see that Qiao Mianmian won this match with 72% of the votes. As for Song Fei… she only received 28% of the votes.”

The emcee looked at Song Fei and asked, “Song Fei, do you have any objections to this result? The competition was and the voting was done according to your instructions. You’ve seen the results.

“Are you still questioning the judges’ results?”

Song Fei’s mind was in a mess. She looked down the stage helplessly and saw the mocking smiles on everyone’s faces.

They seemed to be laughing at her.

Song Fei’s face turned even paler.

It shouldn’t be like this.

It shouldn’t be like this..
