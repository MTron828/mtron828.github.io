Chapter 2058: Is He Here for Qiao Mianmian?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Qiao Mianmian looked straight at the camera and replied, “No, I didn’t know he would do that. I was also very surprised when Assistant Wei appeared.”

The reporter nodded and asked, “Now that everyone knows that Chairman Mo is your boyfriend, we can tell that Chairman Mo values you a lot. You’ve been together for a while, and your relationship has been stable. So, I want to ask, how far have Chairman Mo and Miss Qiao’s relationship progressed? Has Chairman Mo brought Miss Qiao back to meet his parents? Do you have plans to get married?”

Qiao Mianmian smiled and thought for a while before looking up at the camera again. “I think we should just let nature take its course. We didn’t deliberately discuss marriage, because I don’t think there’s anything to discuss.”

“Marriage is a matter of course. When your relationship reaches that point, you’ll naturally want to get married.”

“I wonder if Miss Qiao saw a vote on Weibo.”

.

“What vote?”

“A vote about your outfit tonight. Someone compared you and Miss Shen’s outfit. In the end, your support rate was much higher than Miss Shen’s. Then, we all learned that Miss Shen and Chairman Mo have known each other for many years. You’re Chairman Mo’s girlfriend, so does Miss Qiao know Miss Shen privately?”

Qiao Mianmian looked at the reporter and smiled.

These reporters really knew how to ask questions.

Anyone could tell that she barely interacted with Shen Rou. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

It was obvious that they weren’t on good terms.

The reporters must have known about this too, but they pretended not to know and asked her this question on purpose.

Because such questions would be popular on the Internet.

Qiao Mianmian could understand that the media was like this.

If it was just some basic questions, not many people would be interested.

The media had to eat, too.

Hence, as long as it wasn’t too much, she would usually answer.

“Mm, I guess,” Qiao Mianmian answered honestly. “But I’m not too familiar with her.”

“Miss Qiao, what do you think about the voting? The netizens think that your outfit is better.”

This question.

Qiao Mianmian looked at the reporter who was trying to incite a fight and smiled. She replied calmly, “I don’t have any opinion. I think every female guest tonight is very beautiful. Everyone is different. I don’t think there’s anything to compare.

“Such a vote is actually meaningless. I believe that most of the people who voted for me are my fans. In the eyes of the fans, of course, their idol is the most good-looking. But this doesn’t mean that others lost to you.”

The reporters wanted to ask more, but they suddenly heard someone exclaim softly, “Mo Yesi is here.”

The reporters surrounding Qiao Mianmian turned to look at the entrance.

She got excited.

“It’s Mo Yesi, it’s really him.”

“Is he here for Qiao Mianmian?”

The moment Mo Yesi appeared, the reporters were even more excited than when they saw a big celebrity.

They all turned their cameras towards him.

After all, big celebrities could often be photographed.

But that wasn’t the case for Mo Yesi.
