Chapter 2636: Plotting

Song Fei knew that Qiao Mianmian wasn’t wearing fake goods.

But so what?

She just had to make the netizens believe it.

Then, Qiao Mianmian wouldn’t steal her limelight tonight.

She’d still be the most glamorous one!

…

Qiao Mianmian received a message from Linda the moment she sat down.

Linda: [What were you doing? I don’t understand.]

Qiao Mianmian smiled and replied: [I just want her to hurt more. The more smug she is now, the more painful it will be. Oh right, have you saved the evidence I asked you to?]

Linda: [Mm, don’t worry. None of her fans can escape.]

Qiao Mianmian tapped on the screen and was about to reply when she realized that the party was about to start.

The dressed-up emcee walked onto the stage.

She was sitting in the first row, so she couldn’t play with her cell phone anymore. After turning on the silent mode, she placed her cell phone back into her bag.

The two hosts were known as the top hosts in the hosting world, and they controlled the atmosphere well.

The audience burst into laughter.

Halfway through the show.

The Best Supporting Female Lead, Best Supporting Male Lead, and Best Screenplay Award were all given out.

“If You Can’t Love” won the Most Popular Television Drama Award with its high ratings and discussions.

And the director, Bai Yusheng, easily won the Best Director Award with this drama.

Bai Yusheng didn’t come because he had something on.

The person who went on stage to receive the award was his sister, Qiao Mianmian.

Qiao Mianmian stood on stage. The light from the ceiling shone on her, and the diamonds on her dress reflected the dazzling light. She took the microphone from the emcee and smiled sweetly. The people below the stage felt as if they had seen a fairy.

Even the female host was stunned by her sweet smile.

After a few seconds, the female emcee reacted and continued asking, “Miss Qiao, can you reveal why Director Bai can’t be here today?”

Before Qiao Mianmian attended the gala, Bai Yusheng called her.

He basically told her that if he won the award, she would help him claim it.

As for why he couldn’t come, Qiao Mianmian knew the reason, but it wasn’t convenient to say it.

She couldn’t possibly tell everyone that her brother had chased a woman overseas.

Qiao Mianmian was silent for a few seconds before smiling. “Director Bai sprained his ankle a few days ago and can’t walk. The doctor said he has to rest at home for a month to recover.”

“I see.” The emcee nodded and changed the topic. “So far, you’ve won two awards for ‘If You Can’t Love’. We know that Qin Han and you have been nominated for Best Male Lead and Best Female Lead, respectively. The audience has high expectations for you. I want to know, how high do you think your chances of winning are? Have you thought about winning the award?”

This question…

She wondered if the emcee was deliberately digging a hole for her. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Qiao Mianmian knew very well that if she didn’t answer this question well, she might be defamed again.

She thought for a while before replying, “As a newbie, I’m already very satisfied to be nominated.”

But the emcee didn’t seem willing to let her off just like that.. She asked again, “Then, have you never thought that since you’ve been nominated, you have hope of winning the award too? Have you never expected this?”
