Chapter 710: It’s Obviously Out of the Norm

A woman’s intuition was very accurate. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

She could feel that Bai Yusheng had no romantic feelings for her.

Hence, she mustered up her courage and said, “In my eyes, my boyfriend is the most handsome person. Other than him, all other men are the same to me. Moreover, I will only be attracted to my boyfriend.

“If Director Bai has any feelings for me, I think you’d better give up on it as soon as possible. My relationship with my boyfriend is very good. I won’t break up with him for another man.”

Then, Qiao Mianmian immediately regretted it.

Ahhh, what did she just say?

She must have been bewitched by Bai Yusheng’s smile and thought that he had a good temper and that she could joke around with him.

Then, she got the guts to joke around.

But just as she finished speaking, her mind cleared up.

She really regretted it now.

What if Bai Yusheng got angry?

What if he wanted to pick a third female role out of anger?

He could do that.

“Uh, Director Bai...”

Just as she was about to apologize and repent, she heard the man beside her chuckle.

It sounded... pleasant.

Huh?

Qiao Mianmian looked up in confusion and met Bai Yusheng’s smiling eyes.

He didn’t seem angry.

Not only was he not angry, but he also seemed to be in a good mood.

Qiao Mianmian asked cautiously, “Aren’t you angry?”

Bai Yusheng raised an eyebrow. “Why should I be angry?”

“Oh, because I... said that. I’m sorry, I didn’t do it on purpose. I was just joking with you. If you don’t like it, I won’t ever...”

Before she could finish, she was shocked by the huge hand above her head.

Bai Yusheng rubbed her head naturally. Before Qiao Mianmian could recover from her shock, he retracted his hand and said, “Since it’s a joke, what’s there to be angry about? I was just joking with you. A little girl like you isn’t my cup of tea.

“In my eyes, you’re no different from a little sister.”

Qiao Mianmian slowly came back to her senses. She looked at the man beside her, who had regained his composure.

Bai Yusheng’s actions were out of the norm.

She should be angry.

Even if she wasn’t angry, she should have slapped his hand away to show her attitude.

Because that action... was too intimate.

Besides Mo Yesi and Su Ze, that jerk’s ex, no other man had done that to her.

She should be very against it.

But her first reaction was shock, and after that, she didn’t think of pushing him away.

There was no rejection.

Instead, she felt a sense of intimacy.

Gosh.

Qiao Mianmian’s expression changed as she thought of a possibility.

Could it be that... she liked Bai Yusheng?

That was why she didn’t reject his actions.

And it felt so intimate.

Besides liking someone this way, she couldn’t think of any other reason.

At the thought of this possibility, Qiao Mianmian quickly looked away, not daring to look at Bai Yusheng anymore.
