Chapter 3003: Could Be Pregnant

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Lu Rao didn’t usually work so early.

He was the dean.

His work hours were to his discretion.

He usually took a nap until he woke up naturally before going to the hospital.

But this morning, he was still sleeping when his cell phone vibrated.

Waking up and seeing that it was Mo Yesi, he immediately picked it up.

Mo Yesi used to be his patient.

But after he married Qiao Mianmian, his bad habit was cured. He wouldn’t call him unless something happened.

If he called him, it was probably because of his wife.

The call had just been picked up when an anxious voice sounded. “Go to the hospital immediately. Mianmian is sick. I’m taking her to the hospital now.”

“What?! Sister-in-law is sick?” Lu Rao threw the blanket away and sat up. Taking it seriously, he got off the bed, put on his shoes, and walked to the bathroom to wash up. “What’s wrong? What are her symptoms? Tell me about it first.”

In the past, Qiao Mianmian only had a few scratches on her body, but MO Yesi made a big fuss about it and asked him to examine her personally. Lu Rao felt that it was better to clarify things first.

What if it was a similar situation?

Then, he didn’t have to go to the hospital.

On the other side, MO Yesi’s voice was serious. “She vomited twice on the plane yesterday. She vomited again when she got home. She got better and didn’t vomit anymore, but she vomited again this morning.

“It must be abnormal for her to vomit so badly.

“If it was airsickness, it wouldn’t happen on the next day.

”

“I have to take her to the hospital for a check-up immediately.

Lu Rao was stunned for a few seconds after hearing what he said.

“Other than vomiting, are there any other symptoms?”

“Not yet.” He could hear the engine starting. MO Yesi was already rushing to the hospital.

Lu Rao turned off the water and narrowed his sleepy eyes in silence for a few seconds. Suddenly, his expression changed and he raised his voice. “Ah Si, quickly ask Sister-in-law if that was delayed this month.”

“What?”

Lu Rao pursed his lips and cleared his throat. “Ahem, her monthly... period!”

MO Yesi was silent. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

When Lu Rao asked if Qiao Mianmian’s period had been delayed this month, MO Yesi suddenly woke up and his breathing quickened.

He turned around and looked at his haggard wife.

Seeing how badly she was vomiting, the first thing he thought of was whether she was sick.

He didn’t think about anything else.

“Mianmian, is your period this month... delayed?” MO Yesi took a deep breath and asked calmly.

“Period?” Qiao Mianmian felt better now, but her chest was still a little stuffy. She frowned and suddenly realized that her period had been delayed for half a month!

She suddenly thought of something.

Her eyes widened in disbelief. n MO Yesi, I might be pregnant?”

Her monthly period wasn’t very accurate.

Hence, even though it was delayed, she didn’t think of the pregnancy.

But in the past, it was only delayed for three to five days. Only this month was abnormal..
