Chapter 25: Missed Me?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

The driver who had accompanied her watched her come out empty-handed and asked, “Did Madam not see any clothes you liked?”

“Uncle Li.” Qiao Mianmian didn’t answer this question, but tilted her head and asked him, “Do you know Mo Yesi’s mobile phone number?”

Uncle Li was stunned. “... I do.”

“Well, show it to me.”

Uncle Li: “...”

Madam didn’t have Young Master’s phone number?!

Although he was puzzled, he quickly took out his mobile phone and found Mo Yesi’s number.

Qiao Mianmian glanced at it and called Mo Yesi directly.

It rang for a long time before it was connected.

“Hello.” A cold, low voice sounded, a little alienated and aloof.

Qiao Mianmian was silent for a few seconds before opening her mouth. “... It’s Qiao Mianmian.”

Mo Yesi was quiet for a second. “This is your mobile phone number?”

She didn’t know if it was just her illusion, but she felt like at the mention of her name, Mo Yesi’s tone wasn’t so cold.

It seemed slightly milder.

“Yes.” She nodded.

Mo Yesi was quiet for a while.

Several seconds passed before he said, “I have saved it. You can save my mobile phone number too.”

“Okay, I will!” Qiao Mianmian squeezed her phone. Her previous impulse had faded and she regretted calling him now.

They had only gotten married not more than a day.

Moreover, he was only her husband in name.

Would he think she was troublesome if she called him for help?

But she was really angry.

She had never been described as a thief before.

If she couldn’t give justice to herself today, she would really be angered to death!

“Why did you call me? Have you missed me?” The man’s deep, seductive voice passed into her ears as if he was right beside her, causing Qiao Mianmian’s heartbeat to suddenly whizz.

Her face suddenly turned red.

!!!

How was she to respond!

“Mr. Mo...”

“Call my name, or call me husband. I don’t want to hear ‘Mr. Mo’ anymore.” The man’s tone was strong and domineering with no room for refusal.

Qiao Mianmian went quiet.

Mo Yesi: “I’m on my way. I’ll be there in about 20 minutes. If you’re hungry, you can order something to eat instead of waiting for me.”

“Okay.”

“Qiao Mianmian?” Mo Yesi suddenly called her name.

“Yes?”

“Do you have anything to tell me?”

Qiao Mianmian hesitated for a few seconds and asked softly, “I’m at Shengdong Department Store. I heard Uncle Li say that this mall is owned by Mo Firm, is that so?”

Mo Yesi simply acknowledged. “Yes.”

“Then...”

“Yes?” Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Qiao Mianmian: “I’m also the owner of this mall, right?”

After she said this, she felt her face burn.

Mo Yesi seemed a little surprised that she would say such things. After a few seconds of silence, he chuckled lowly. “Of course.”

“Then... If the boss thinks the employees are of poor quality and the work attitude is too bad, can they be fired?”

Qiao Mianmian was a little hesitant.

She waited nervously.

She was afraid that Mo Yesi would reject her.

Then she would feel too shameless and embarrassed.

After a few seconds of silence, the man spoke again, his tone suddenly cold. He asked in a deep voice, “Have you been bullied?”
