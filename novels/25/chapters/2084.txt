Chapter 2085: Tell Me, Which Is Your Favorite?

“Then, don’t you want your career and future anymore?” Lin Huizhen was furious.

“I’ll think of something myself.” Qiao Anxin suddenly thought of someone, and her eyes lit up again.

“What can you do? Anxin, listen to me, just…”

“Mom, I have something on. I have to go out immediately. I won’t be back for dinner tonight. You and Dad don’t have to wait for me.”

Before Lin Huizhen could finish her sentence, Qiao Anxin pushed her away and rushed out of the room.

“Anxin, Anxin…” Lin Huizhen called her from behind. She stomped her feet in anger as she watched her leave the bedroom without looking back.

…

Qiao Mianmian waited for more than half an hour before Mo Yesi finally returned.

The man walked in front of her and pulled her into his arms. He hugged her and kissed her. “I’m sorry, Baby. Something cropped up at the last minute, so I made you wait for a while.

“Are you bored?”

Qiao Mianmian chuckled. “I’m not bored at all. I found something fun while I was waiting for you.”

“Mm?” The man raised his brows and smiled. “What did you find fun?”

“This.” Qiao Mianmian gently pushed him away and walked to the desk to pick up the stack of paper. “Mo Yesi, did you draw this?”

Mo Yesi looked at the album in her hand and smiled. “Mm, I drew it. What do you think?”

“I think it’s pretty good.” Qiao Mianmian looked at her extraordinarily handsome and multi-talented husband and praised him generously. “It doesn’t lose out to professional jewelry designers at all. Is this a new product you designed for the next season for your jewelry company? You didn’t even tell me that you know jewelry design. Could it be that many of the jewelry from the jewelry stores under the Mo Corporation was personally designed by you?”

Mo Yesi didn’t answer her question. Instead, he took the album from her and flipped through a few pages before asking, “You’ve finished looking at the album? Which ring do you think is the best? What’s your favorite?”

“I think they’re all pretty.” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“You must have a favorite, right?” Mo Yesi handed her the album. “Tell me, which one is your favorite?”

Qiao Mianmian thought that he wanted to hear her opinion.

This was normal.

Mo Yesi’s jewelry was all for women.

Since it was designed for female consumers, it was normal to ask for her opinion.

Qiao Mianmian flipped through the album again and picked out her favorite.

The reason it was so difficult to choose was that she felt that all the designs were pretty, but it was difficult to choose the one that she felt was the best.

Mo Yesi looked at the diamond ring she picked out. The man looked at her with gentle eyes. “You like this one?”

“Mm.” Qiao Mianmian nodded. “Actually, I think every design looks good. But this one is my favorite.”

“Mm, good taste. It seems like we have the same taste.”

Qiao Mianmian was stunned. “Huh?”

Mo Yesi smiled. “I think this model suits you best, too. Since you like it the most, it’s settled.”

“Settled?” Qiao Mianmian was stunned again. “Settled what?”

“Of course it’s your wedding ring.”

“Wedding ring?” Qiao Mianmian was even more confused.
