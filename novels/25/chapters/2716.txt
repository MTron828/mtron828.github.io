Chapter 2717: It Made Her Uncomfortable

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

Alright.

If he said it was wishful thinking, then it must be wishful thinking.

She couldn’t be bothered to argue with him.

“Are you off work?” Qiao Mianmian changed the topic.

“Not yet. There’s a meeting later. I can get off work after the meeting.”

“Oh.” Qiao Mianmian thought for a while and asked, “Have you visited Yueyue at Big Brother’s place?”

“I’ll be there after work. Big Brother called me early in the morning and asked me to have dinner at his place.”

“Oh, that’s great. I want to see Luo Luo and Yueyue, too. I miss them so much.”

“You miss them so much, but have you ever thought about me?” The man’s low and sexy voice seemed to carry a hint of dissatisfaction. “You haven’t even said that you miss me. In your heart, where exactly do I rank as your husband?”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

“Mo Yesi, it’s fine if you’re jealous of Luo Luo, but are you jealous of Yueyue too? She’s a little baby who’s not even a month old. If you’re jealous of a little baby, others will definitely laugh at you!”

“Mm, so you admit that I’m not as important as a baby in your heart.”

“…Can you not be so unreasonable?”

“Do you miss me?”

“I do!” Qiao Mianmian didn’t dare to say otherwise. She immediately coaxed him. “I even dreamed of you last night. I dreamed that you came to Country Y to see me.”

“You dreamed of me last night?” The man’s voice rose slightly with a hint of laughter. “Are you serious?”

“Of course!”

“Mm, since you want me to visit you so much, I’ll find some time to visit you someday.”

“Aren’t you very busy? Mo Yesi, don’t misunderstand. I’m not hinting at anything.” Qiao Mianmian quickly interrupted him when she heard that he was coming over. “Come and see me when you’re free.”

She couldn’t bear for him to go anywhere.

Even if he said he wasn’t tired, she couldn’t bear for him to be so tired.

And once the movie officially started, she would be very busy in the early stages.

“I’m busy, but if my baby wants to see me, I’ll take the time out.”

“Then, I can’t bear to see you work too hard and tire yourself out. I’m serious. Let’s talk about this when you’re free. I know you’ve been especially busy recently. You should focus on your work.”

“Mm. I’ll see you when I’m free.”

After chatting for a while, Qiao Mianmian heard Wei Zheng call him for a meeting.

“Baby, I have to go to the meeting. I’ll call you when I’m back.”

“Alright, go on.” Qiao Mianmian hung up first.

After ending the call with Mo Yesi, she checked WeChat again. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

There were more than 50 messages.

With her OCD, she clicked on it, and the comments quickly popped up.

They were all people with whom she had worked together before and added each other on WeChat. Qiao Mianmian didn’t have a good relationship with them, but everyone would usually comment on her Moments posts.

Qiao Mianmian even saw that the person who added her on WeChat last night also Liked her comment.

Z: [It looks good. You can post more selfies in the future.]

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

This person’s comment made her feel uncomfortable.

They weren’t close at all.

She didn’t even know who he was, but the tone of his comment made Qiao Mianmian feel like they knew each other..
