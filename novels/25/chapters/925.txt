Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Mm.” Mo Yesi didn’t continue the topic. He picked up his chopsticks and picked up the chicken that Qiao Mianmian placed in his bowl.

“How is it?” Qiao Mianmian looked at him expectantly. “Is the chicken too tough? Is it flavorful enough?”

Qiao Mianmian had some confidence in her culinary skills.

Although her culinary skills couldn’t be compared to that of a chef, she wasn’t much inferior.

Especially this dish of Kung Pao Chicken. It was one of her specialties.

She had done it for Su Ze twice in the past, and he was full of praises for it.

Mo Yesi chewed carefully and only turned to look at her after swallowing the food. “It’s delicious.”

“Really?” Qiao Mianmian smiled happily. “You’re not lying to me, right? If you don’t like it, you can tell me directly. I’m not afraid of criticism.”

“I’m not lying to you.” Mo Yesi said seriously, “It’s delicious. It’s the best dish I’ve eaten since I was young.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

Even if he was trying to make her happy, this was too much.

She knew her standards.

He had been eating the dishes prepared by the top chefs since he was a child, so he was really picky.

He probably wouldn’t even be interested in her food.

“It’s true.” Mo Yesi seemed to be afraid that she wouldn’t believe him. “I really think this is the best dish I’ve ever had. The taste is very special, very different from other dishes.”

“Special?” Qiao Mianmian rested her chin on one hand and blinked curiously. “How is it special?”

“I can’t describe it, either.” Mo Yesi smiled and said gently, “It probably tastes like home, so it’s very different. Baby, this is the food you personally cooked for me, I’ll definitely finish it all.”

Yes, the smell of home.

Hence, it was unique.

Besides her, no one else could do it.

At this moment, Mo Yesi looked at the person sitting beside him, and then at the food on the table. He felt unprecedented happiness and satisfaction.

It felt so good to have a family.

...

Mo Yesi was very nice to her for this meal.

He almost finished the two dishes that she made.

As for the steak and ribs he made, Qiao Mianmian only had a taste before he forcefully threw them into the trash can.

In his words, he was worried that she would eat something bad.

After dinner, Qiao Mianmian was chased to the living room to watch television.

She wanted to help clear the dishes in the kitchen, but he rejected her. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Qiao Mianmian leaned lazily on the sofa in the living room and looked at the man running around the dining room and kitchen. She couldn’t help but take a picture of him clearing the leftovers on the table.

After taking the photo, she photoshopped it and posted it on WeChat.

She sent it selectively. Some people could see it, while others couldn’t.

People who knew that she was with Mo Yesi could see it.

The moment she posted it, she received a Like and comment from Linda.

Linda commented: [I’ll eat this dog food first.]

Qiao Mianmian immediately replied: [Sister Xie, have you eaten?]

Linda: [Mm, I just ate. Now that you’re free, is it convenient to call you?]
