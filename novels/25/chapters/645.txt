Chapter 646: I Have Too Much to Worry About

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Baby, I’m worried about you.” Mo Yesi sighed and pulled her into his arms. He placed his hand on her head and said worriedly, “Don’t you find your husband too long-winded? This is the first time you’re going on a long trip after our marriage, and you’re going to be away from me for months. I’m worried about you.

“I’m afraid you won’t be able to take care of yourself without me by your side.

“I’m also afraid that you’ll be wronged and bullied when I’m not around...

“I have too many things to worry about.

“So, I want you to promise me that if anyone dares to bully you and make you feel aggrieved, you won’t bear it alone.

“Or you can’t hide anything from me. I want you to promise me that you won’t hide anything from me.”

Qiao Mianmian leaned against his chest and listened to his heartbeat.

He was still nagging.

This was really different from the usual Mo Yesi.

He had never been so long-winded before.

He was acting so strangely only because he was worried about her.

Qiao Mianmian couldn’t describe how she felt. She reached out and wrapped her arms around his slim waist, her eyes suddenly moistening.

In the past, she didn’t feel anything when she went overseas to film.

The only person she couldn’t bear to leave was Qiao Chen.

As for Su Ze...

She didn’t seem to be as reluctant as she was now.

Even though they’d been apart for a while, she didn’t feel happy or excited.

She suddenly realized...

Perhaps she didn’t really like Su Ze in the past.

He did like her a little, but it wasn’t deep.

That was why she was able to get out of it so quickly after he betrayed her.

If she really loved Su Ze, she wouldn’t have fallen for another man so quickly.

She hadn’t known Mo Yesi for long.

But unknowingly, this man had already occupied a place in her heart, becoming a part of her life.

She was already reluctant to part with him.

“Mm. I promise you.” Qiao Mianmian listened to his heartbeat and hugged him even tighter. “I’ll take good care of myself, I won’t let myself feel aggrieved, and I won’t let anyone bully me. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“I promise you, I’ll be fine for the next few months.

“Don’t worry, I used to go overseas for filming too. I’m not a child anymore, I won’t let myself lead a terrible life.

“Anyway, didn’t you say you’d say hi to Director Bai? With Director Bai around, what could happen to me? When I get there, I’ll video call you every day to report the situation, alright? That way, wouldn’t you feel better?”

“With Bai Yusheng taking care of you, I can indeed feel more at ease.” Mo Yesi also tightened his arms, wanting to place the petite girl in his arms into his flesh and blood so that he could bring her along wherever he went.

They wouldn’t have to separate anymore.

“In any case, you don’t have to worry about troubling him. He still owes me a favor. If you have anything to say, just go to him. He won’t dare to not settle it for you.”

“Mm.”

“Of course, you have to look for your husband first if anything happens. I can’t rush over to settle it for you right away. You can look for him then.”

Recalling how Qiao Mianmian praised Bai Yusheng for his talent and seemed to admire him, Mo Yesi didn’t want them to interact too much.
