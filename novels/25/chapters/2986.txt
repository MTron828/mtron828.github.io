Chapter 2987: The Wedding Starts

Translator: Atlas StudiosEditor: Atlas Studios

The door opened, Bai Yusheng and Qiao Chen walked in.

Both of them were handsome men. One was calm and elegant, while the other was graceful and elegant.

These two outstanding men were Qiao Mianmian’s brothers.

Moreover, she had an even more handsome husband.

Qiao Mianmian was really… a winner in life.

Qiao Chen walked in. The young man wasn’t old, and even though he’d been through a lot, he still couldn’t control his expression when he saw his sister in the wedding dress. He stood at the door, his eyes fixed on Qiao Mianmian.

He was dumbfounded.

Bai Yusheng had seen big scenes before, so he was much calmer.

But when his gaze landed on Qiao Mianmian, his gaze lingered still longer than usual.

“What? You grew up with your sister and saw her every day. Are you still stunned?” Bai Yusheng patted Qiao Chen on the shoulder and smiled, causing the latter to snap out of his daze.

The young man’s eyes were bright as he pursed his lips. “That’s different. Sister is especially beautiful today, like a fairy.”

“Mm, she’s indeed especially beautiful today.” Bai Yusheng smiled gently as he walked towards Qiao Mianmian and praised her sincerely. “Mianmian, you’re especially beautiful today. No wonder people say that the most beautiful day for a girl is the day she wears a wedding dress. This saying isn’t wrong

atall.

“Miss Jiang is also ridiculously beautiful today.” He praised his sister but didn’t forget Jiang Luoli.

Girls should be praised together.

Jiang Luoli smiled. “Thank you. Director Bai is especially handsome today.”

Bai Yusheng was good-looking.

Just like the Mo family, the Bai family had both the genes of a handsome man and a beautiful woman. Bai Yusheng was dressed especially formally today. He was in a high-end suit and had a bow tie. He looked elegant, noble, and very attractive.

Although Jiang Luoli already had a handsome husband, that didn’t stop her from admiring other handsome guys.

“And Chen Chen.” Jiang Luoli sized Qiao Chen up from head to toe and couldn’t help but exclaim, “My son has just grown up. When I first met Chen Chen, he was still a young man. Why do I feel like he became a domineering CEO in the blink of an eye?”

“Domineering CEO?” Qiao Chen’s lips twitched. He felt that this wasn’t a good adjective. “Sister Luoli, what do you mean by domineering CEO?”

Jiang Luoli grinned. “I’m just praising you. Ask your sister if you don’t believe me.” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

She’d seen too much of Jiang Luoli.

Everyone was a domineering CEO.

‘When she first met Mo Yesi, she also said that he was a domineering CEO.

Qiao Chen’s lips twitched again as he touched his nose. “It’s about time, shouldn’t we bring the bride out? I think Brother-in-law and Brother Shixiu can’t wait anymore.”

“Mn, it’s time to bring the brides out.”

On the beach, the waves gently hit the rocks.

All the world-class musicians were gathered here just for the best wishes of the brides and grooms.

The path to the wedding venue was filled with red and white rose petals.

Red represented love and passion.

White represented loyalty.
