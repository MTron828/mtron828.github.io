Her attitude caused his frown to grow deeper.

He looked at her with a disappointed and distressed gaze and said solemnly, “Mianmian, we’re not enemies. Even though we broke up, you should not treat me like an enemy. I said this before, even if we’re not lovers, if you have any difficulties in the future, you can still come to me.

“As long as it’s something within my control, I will help you. No matter how much you hate me, you should not sell yourself.”

Qiao Mianmian frowned as she heard his last sentence.

Her eyes became more and more indifferent. She turned her disappointed eyes to Su Ze and sneered. “I’m selling myself? Mr. Su, who are you, do I know you well? How much do you know about me, to say that I’m selling myself?”

Her cold and alienating “Mr. Su” caused Su Ze’s expression to turn even angrier.

Anger raged in his eyes. “Then tell me, why are you here? Who brought you here? And who was the owner of the Rolls-Royce you sat in last time? Mianmian, do you really want to be so stubborn? Would you rather betray your own body than ask me for help?

“Is it more difficult to talk to me than to sleep with those disgusting old men?”

“Pah!”

Just after Su Ze finished speaking, he was slapped, and five bright red fingerprints were printed on his fair and beautiful face.

He covered his face, his eyes filled with consternation.

It seemed like he couldn’t believe that Qiao Mianmian would slap him.

Qiao Mianmian had completely given up on Su Ze.

In her heart, the past Su Ze was dead.

Now standing in front of her was just a stranger who had nothing to do with her.

But she was still disgusted.

She felt so disgusted that she wanted to vomit out last night’s meal.

“Su Ze, you really make me feel sick. I was blind before, that’s why I even promised to be with you! You make me think that even feeding all my feelings over those years to a dog would be a hundred times less wasteful and a thousand times better!” Qiao Mianmian trembled with anger.

This was the man who once said that he would love her for life and never let her down. That he would protect her no matter what happened and prevent her from being aggrieved and hurt.

He had not fulfilled a single promise.

It was he who disappointed her.

It was he who hurt her and made her feel wronged.

She only hated that she couldn’t turn back time now.

Otherwise, even if all the men in the world were dead, she would never be with such a scumbag!

Being slapped in the face in public, Su Ze lost his face, and his face turned gloomy.

He covered his face, the anger in his eyes threatening to spew out, his gaze stormy. “You hit me because I guessed right? Qiao Mianmian, are you really willing to go so low for money? How much did the old man give you? 10 million? 20 million? Or 100 million? Is it possible to sleep with you as long a lot of money is given to you?”

“Tell me your price. I, Su Ze, am not someone who can’t afford it!”

Qiao Mianmian looked at him incredulously.

This was the man she had known for ten years?

Ten years of feelings, in exchange for his insult?

“F*ck you, Su Ze, you scumbag. How dare you still dare to show your face in front of Mianmian. Don’t you feel ashamed?” Jiang Luoli’s temper was so strong that she could no longer stand it and stood up pointing at Su Ze’s nose, cursing. “You’re so shameless.”
