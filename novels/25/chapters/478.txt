He sighed and asked gently, “Baby, are you crying? Why are you crying?”

There was a moment of silence before he sighed again. Guilty, he asked, “Is it because of me?”

Qiao Mianmian looked at him blankly.

After a while, she reached out and started to caress his handsome face.

It was only after she felt the warmth on his face that she confirmed that she wasn’t hallucinating.

“Mo Yesi?” Qiao Mianmain asked while biting on her lip.

“Yes,” Mo Yesi gently answered.

Qiao Mianmian looked at him puzzledly. “You... Why are you here?”

Mo Yesi stayed silent for a while before replying truthfully, “Jiang Luoli called me. She said that you were drunk and was worried about letting you go back by yourself. So I came over.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

A few moments later, she pouted unhappily and said, “Luo Luo told you? Why must she stick her nose in my business? I’m capable of going back on my own.”

To be frank, she was elated when she saw Mo Yesi.

But as she realized that he was here because Jiang Luoli contacted him, she became unhappy once more.

He wouldn’t have come if Luo Luo hadn’t informed him.

He didn’t care about her all this while.

It was obvious that he was ignoring her on purpose.

He would’ve ignored her for a long period if Jiang Luoli didn’t make the call.

The more she thought, the more unhappy she got.

“She wasn’t sticking her nose in your business,” Mo Yesi answered. He felt that she looked really cute when she pouted and gave her a peck uncontrollably. He then patted her head, looked at her lovingly, and continued, “I’m really thankful for the call. It made me understand how grave my mistake was.”

Qiao Mianmian was shocked by the peck. She stared at the handsome face in front of her. She could feel the drumming of her heart as she mumbled, “What, what mistake?”

It might be because of the alcohol in her system.

She felt that her cheeks were steaming.

As the two of them were really close, she could feel his warm breath on her lips as he breathed.

She could smell that musk on him too.

Mo Yesi stared at her and apologized. “Baby, I’m sorry.”

It was a sudden apology.

Qiao Mianmian was caught off-guard. It took a while before she bit her lip and asked, “Why are you apologizing for?”

Mo Yesi grabbed her hand and kissed it. He then answered, “I was jealous, so I purposely ignored your messages.”

As he spoke, tears started to well up in her eyes.

So... He was ignoring her on purpose.

Suddenly, she felt wronged.

Mo Yesi noticed the tears welling up in her eyes and started to panic.

He got onto the couch and hugged her. He then asked, “Baby, why are you crying again?”

With red eyes, she pushed him in anger. “Don’t touch me, let me go!”

Mo Yesi heard it, but he wasn’t going to let her go. He held onto her even tighter.

“Baby, I’m wrong, please forgive me. I’ll never do it again.”

Qiao Mianmian continued to struggle. When she realized that she couldn’t escape his grip, she was so angry that she bit his hand.
