Chapter 1378: Thank You For Coming Today

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“No.” Qiao Mianmian sniffled and suppressed the urge to cry. “Mo Yesi, thank you for coming today. I’m just happy that the person beside me is you.”

Mo Yesi looked at the girl in his arms whose eyes were as red as a rabbit’s and relaxed his grip on her chin. He held her face tenderly and kissed her on the forehead. “Baby, are you silly? I’m your husband, I should do everything for you. Is this worth you crying?

“If you miss me, I’ll come over often.

“Don’t cry, okay?”

He pulled Qiao Mianmian’s face. “Since you’re so happy to see me, why don’t you smile for me?”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

“Alright, don’t be unhappy. I’ll bring you to eat good food?” Mo Yesi tried his best to make his wife happy. “Do you want to eat hot pot?”

As expected, Qiao Mianmian was quickly attracted by the food.

Her eyes lit up. “Can you eat hot pot?”

“Isn’t there a Mandarin Duck pot? I can eat clear soup.” Mo Yesi took out his cell phone and called Wei Zheng to ask him which hot pot in F City was good.

Wei Zheng was indeed a know-it-all. He quickly found a few hot pot restaurants with good reviews and sent their names and addresses to Mo Yesi’s cell phone.

Mo Yesi looked at the GPS and picked the nearest one.

Mo Yesi brought Qiao Mianmian to a hot pot restaurant nearby.

It wasn’t a very famous restaurant, and the renovation wasn’t very high-end. The few hot pot restaurants that Wei Zheng found were all old local hot pot restaurants. They had average surroundings, but the taste was very good.

Qiao Mianmian loved to eat in such stores.

Before getting out of the car, she thought that it was a good thing that Mo Yesi was more low-profile today and didn’t drive a Lamborghini or Bugatti.

He drove a black Bentley.

Although it was considered a luxury car, it was considered low-profile compared to his sports cars that cost tens of millions.

Mo Yesi led Qiao Mianmian out of the car.

It wasn’t a holiday today, and it was daytime, so there weren’t many people at the hot pot restaurant.

Wei Zheng had already booked a private room for them.

A waiter came forward to serve them.

Mo Yesi gave them their names and the waiter led them to the private room.

There were a few tables full of people eating.

When Mo Yesi and Qiao Mianmian walked in, the girls at the nearest table immediately noticed Mo Yesi and exclaimed.

“Wow, he’s so handsome.”

“That man in the black shirt is so handsome. Is he a celebrity? He’s too handsome.”

“He doesn’t look familiar. If he’s a celebrity, he’s probably a newbie and not famous yet.”

“He’s so handsome, he’ll be famous sooner or later. I want to take a picture with him and ask for his contact details.”

“Alright, don’t be so smitten. Can’t you see that he’s taken? Although the girl beside him is wearing a mask, she must be very pretty.”

“Why do I find the girl beside him familiar? I think I’ve seen her somewhere before.”

“She does look familiar. I think I’ve seen her somewhere before.”

“Do you think... that girl with the mask looks like that newbie called Qiao something? Let me think... Oh, right. I remember. Her name is Qiao Mianmian.”
