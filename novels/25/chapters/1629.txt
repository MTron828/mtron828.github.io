Chapter 1630: I Wonder How Long This Love Will Last

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Qin Han said to his assistant, “It’s better than I thought.”

The assistant nodded in agreement. “It’s not bad. Although it’s not as good as Brother Han’s performance, it’s not too bad. As long as it’s not too bad and doesn’t ruin Brother Han’s reputation.”

Qin Han smiled.

He looked at Mo Yesi, who was not too far away, and thought that with Mo Yesi’s qualifications, he would definitely be a powerful opponent in the entertainment industry.

But even as a side family member of the Mo family, he was still a noble. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

In the eyes of ordinary people, being an artiste was a very glamorous and profitable career.

But in the eyes of the true aristocrats, they were still not presentable.

Hence, even if he was just a side family member of the Mo family, it was impossible for him to enter the entertainment industry.

Bai Yusheng was an exception.

Moreover, Bai Yusheng was a director, not an artiste.

At this thought, Qin Han couldn’t help but worry for Qiao Mianmian.

Could Qiao Mianmian marry into a family like the Mo family?

Mo Yesi seemed to like her a lot now, but he wondered how long this affection would last.

He didn’t want to lose her like the other rich playboys.

“How was it, Honey? Did I do well?” Mo Yesi asked Qiao Mianmian.

Qiao Mianmian nodded. “Mm, not bad.”

Mo Yesi immediately said, “If there’s such a scene in the future, I can still be a substitute.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

“Alright, alright. You have nothing to do here. The two of you can go on your date.” Bai Yusheng let Qiao Mianmian know in advance as he watched the two of them whispering to each other.

Normally, even after Qiao Mianmian’s scenes were done, she would wait for the entire crew to wrap up before leaving.

But today, Bai Yusheng didn’t mind letting his sister and brother-in-law leave early.

They were newlyweds and still needed to nurture their relationship.

As an older brother, he naturally had to create opportunities for them.

Mo Yesi wasn’t polite at all. He held Qiao Mianmian’s hand and said, “Mm, then I’ll take her away.”

“Go, go, go.” Bai Yusheng waved his hand as if he was chasing them away. “Hurry up and leave. My actors can’t even perform well if you stay here. All of them are so scared by you that they can’t even remember their lines. Don’t come again if there’s nothing else.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

Mo Yesi still looked indifferent, as if he didn’t take Bai Yusheng’s criticism seriously.

He nodded. “Then, we’re leaving. Mianmian, let’s go.”

Qiao Mianmian left with him.

After they left.

A group of actresses and female crew members gathered and started discussing.

“Qiao Mianmian’s boyfriend is so jealous. In order to prevent Qiao Mianmian and Qin Han from filming an intimate scene, he actually acted as Qin Han’s substitute in those scenes. Gosh, this is too sweet and torturous.”

“How is it sweet? I think that man is too possessive. I don’t like possessive men. You can be controlled at any time and have no freedom.”

“You have to like someone very much to be so possessive. Anyway, I think it’s sweet. I just want to find someone who can control me.”

“Why is my focus different from yours? I think Qiao Mianmian’s boyfriend is too handsome. He’s even more handsome than Qin Han!”

“Someone even said that her boyfriend was a terrible old man. I didn’t expect him to be so young and handsome. Sigh, I’m so envious.”
