Qiao Mianmian thought it was something they ordered and said, “Come in.”

The door was pushed open.

Two waiters walked inside.

One of the waiters was holding a huge plate of fruits, while the other was holding two bottles of red wine and two wine glasses.

They put down the red wine and fruit plate.

Qiao Mianmian looked at it and asked, “What’s this? Sister Xie, did you order this?”

She remembered that they didn’t order alcohol.

The fruit plate wasn’t that big.

Linda shook her head. “I didn’t order it.”

Qiao Mianmian didn’t order it, either.

She stopped the waiter. “Did you make a mistake? We didn’t order this.”

The waiter confirmed it. He smiled and said, “Ladies, you really didn’t order anything on the table. This is from a gentleman.”

Qiao Mianmian was stunned. “A gentleman?”

“Yes.”

“What’s the surname of this gentleman?”

“That gentleman is in the private room opposite. He said that if the two ladies are interested, you can play in their private room.”

Qiao Mianmian and Linda looked at each other in confusion.

They definitely wouldn’t dare to eat or drink the fruits and red wine sent by an unknown person.

Qiao Mianmian hesitated for a while before getting up. “Sister Xie, I’ll go to the private room opposite. Wait for me.”

“Don’t you need me to go with you?”

“No need, I’ll just see who it is. I’ll be back soon.”

With that, she followed the two waiters out of the private room.

...

The first person Qiao Mianmian guessed was Yan Shaoqing.

Only Yan Shaoqing liked to come to such places.

And he had done something similar before.

The waiter brought Qiao Mianmian to the private room opposite and knocked on the door.

He opened the door.

The room was originally noisy, but the moment the door opened, the sound of men and women laughing could be heard.

It was a little dark inside. Qiao Mianmian stood at the door and looked in, only to see unfamiliar faces.

She couldn’t see anything further.

When the door opened, everyone in the private room looked up and saw her standing at the door. All the men were stunned, and then their eyes revealed amazement.

What a beautiful girl!

She was as beautiful as a fairy.

She was different from the women in the private room. Even though she wasn’t wearing any makeup and was dressed ordinarily, she still looked too beautiful.

Compared to her, all the women in the room were vulgar.

All the men stared at her, and all the female companions around them were thrown aside. They suddenly felt disinterested.

None of these women could compare to the girl at the door.

Boss Huang was the most excited among them.

He was pleasantly surprised to see Qiao Mianmian at the door and immediately walked towards her.

“Miss Qiao, nice to see you again.”

Boss Huang sized her up from head to toe and drooled.

Qiao Mianmian was a rare beauty.

He would suffocate if he could only look and not touch such a beauty.

Boss Huang was half a head shorter than Qiao Mianmian.

Qiao Mianmian looked down and saw his bald head shining.

She looked at Boss Huang’s covetous gaze and furrowed her brows. Holding back her disgust, she said, “Boss Huang, don’t be like this.”
