Chapter 3021 The End (4)

Her question was a little silly, but Mo Yesi looked at her affectionately and answered her gently and patiently, “This is our son. His mother is a stunning beauty. He inherited his mother’s good genes, so he’s naturally good-looking.”

“What stunning beauty.” Qiao Mianmian glared at him innocently, but her heart was filled with sweetness. “Our son obviously looks like you, I can’t tell how he looks like me.”

The baby was like a mini version of Mo Yesi.

Although his facial features weren’t fully developed and weren’t deep enough, she could tell that he looked like Mo Yesi.

His eyes, nose, and mouth were all like Mo Yesi’s.

Qiao Mianmian had seen his childhood photos before. They were almost identical to the baby.

Hence, she felt that genes were really magical.

Mo Yesi looked at his son and then at her. “He looks like you, too.”

Qiao Mianmian pursed her lips and sized up her son again. She couldn’t find anything that looked like her.

He probably inherited her fair skin and thick black hair.

She heard that her hair was already very thick when she was young.

Now her son was just like her, with dark and dense hair.

“Oh right, think of our son’s name.” Qiao Mianmian covered her mouth and yawned. “Think of a few first. When I wake up, I’ll see if there’s anything suitable.” “Alright, then you sleep first. I’ll think of a few names for our son. If you don’t think they are suitable, we’ll think about it together.”

Mo Yesi placed the baby back on the crib and then helped Qiao Mianmian lie down slowly. He then covered her with the blanket.

Qiao Mianmian was really tired.

She fell asleep soon after.

Mo Yesi heard her say his name as if she was talking in her sleep.

He bent down and listened.

This time, he heard it clearly.

“Hubby, I love you so much. I love our baby, too. Hubby, I want to be with you forever... forever...”

Mo Yesi looked at the sleeping girl affectionately and planted a soft kiss on her lips. “Baby, I love you too. I’ll always love you.”

On the day of Mo Ci’s 100th-day banquet, Mo Yesi’s usual low-profile and dislike for crowds was nowhere to be seen as he organized a huge banquet for his son. Everyone in Yuncheng City who had a little face was invited. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Most famous figures in the political and business world were invited.

A lot of people from the entertainment industry were also invited.

The 100-day banquet was held in the Mo Residence. It was an open-air venue, and the venue was beautifully decorated. It was extremely luxurious, and there were all sorts of luxury brands. There were even so many that it was like picking up cabbages from the market.

Everyone knew that the Mo family was one of the richest families in Yuncheng City.

But because they had always been low-profile and didn’t like to show their wealth, most people didn’t know how rich they were even though they knew that they were rich.

The 100-day banquet this time had broadened many people’s horizons. They realized how big the gap between such a top-notch wealthy family and ordinary rich people was.
