Chapter 701: Miss Qiao, Are You Alright?

She looked past him and pretended to be looking for someone. When she saw Nana in front of her, it was as if she saw her savior. She quickly strode towards her.

Perhaps it was because she was walking too quickly, she didn’t see a stone under her feet and slipped...

Seeing that she was about to fall, Tu Yilei hurriedly went forward to support her.

Qiao Mianmian bumped into him again.

Tu Yilei held her waist out of habit.

Under normal circumstances, he should have let go after she stabilized herself.

But the moment he let go, he couldn’t bear to.

The girl’s soft and fragrant body was leaning against his chest, and the sweet scent kept entering his nose.

He didn’t dare to use too much force when he hugged her, afraid that he would break her waist.

She was so petite.

It was only when she was in his arms that she could feel his chest.

He could hold her in his arms.

Tu Yilei’s ideal girlfriend was such a petite girl.

It made him want to protect her.

Qiao Mianmian’s looks weren’t just his cup of tea, but even her height and figure suited his preferences.

Even her sweet scent was the type he liked.

His fingers touched the soft and slender waist of the girl in his arms, and his heart started to race uncontrollably.

How could there be such a girl?

She had become what he liked.

He never believed in love at first sight.

But now, he believed it.

It turned out that there really was a type of person in this world who could make you fall for her with just one look.

Then, he liked her more and more.

He liked her so much that he couldn’t stop thinking about her.

He couldn’t stop thinking about her.

But why did God arrange such a person for him and make her belong to someone else?

“Mr. Tu, let go of me...”

Qiao Mianmian fell into Tu Yilei’s arms again, and her head hit his sturdy chest. She felt dizzy from the impact.

It took her a while to recover.

When she realized that Tu Yilei’s hand was still on her waist, she felt a strange emotion and pushed him away.

Tu Yilei snapped back to his senses.

“I’m sorry, Miss Qiao. Are you alright?”

Tu Yilei immediately let go and took a step back. He tightened his grip around Qiao Mianmian’s waist and took a deep breath to suppress his emotions.

He knew that he’d lost his composure.

He did something very ungentlemanly.

He actually took advantage of her.

Qiao Mianmian shook her head.

“That’s good.” Tu Yilei realized that he was losing control of his emotions. He panicked. It was a fear and panic that surpassed his control. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

He wanted to escape.

“Since Miss Qiao is fine, I’ll take my leave first.” Tu Yilei hurriedly left after saying this.

“Sister Mianmian, are you alright?”

Nana turned around and saw that Tu Yilei had already left. She furrowed her brows as some speculations that she’d forgotten surfaced in her mind.
