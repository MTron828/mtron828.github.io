Chapter 2633: She Doesn’t Have to Worry About Anything

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“That’s right. The Mo family is extremely rich, and they don’t lack money. Moreover, Mo Yesi has always pampered her. Every time she has something to do, he would step out and help her settle it. Qiao Mianmian is so lucky to have married such a good husband. If I were her, I’d be at home leisurely being a rich wife. I wouldn’t come to the entertainment industry to suffer.”

“This shows that she really likes being an actress. Otherwise, she wouldn’t be in this industry since she doesn’t lack money. There are too many scandals in this industry, and it’s too easy for others to be jealous. But she’s not afraid. She has the backing of the Bai and Mo families. No matter what, someone will settle it for her. Speaking of which, what do you think Song Fei is thinking? Doesn’t she know Qiao Mianmian’s background? How dare she provoke her.”

The discussion gradually died down.

The two female artistes seemed to be afraid and lowered their voices.

But Song Fei still heard it.

The two female artistes had just mentioned her.

Song Fei pursed her lips and her expression darkened.

These people seemed to be a little worried about Qiao Mianmian.

Song Fei knew what they were afraid of.

They were afraid of Qiao Mianmian’s backing, the Bai and Mo families.

Song Fei knew how powerful the two families were, and she wasn’t completely fearless.

However, as a university student who had yet to leave the school, she wasn’t clear about the power of the Bai and Mo families. She always felt that no matter how powerful the two families were, they couldn’t do anything to her.

She felt that the others’ fears were too exaggerated.

She felt that everyone else was afraid, but she wasn’t.

To put it bluntly, she felt that she was unique.

Hence, when she heard the two female artistes discussing her and the Bai and Mo families, she didn’t think much of it. She also didn’t think about the consequences of offending Qiao Mianmian.

Her sugar daddy was the boss of her management company.

And she had so many fans.

As long as her sugar daddy and her fans were willing to support her, what could Qiao Mianmian do to her?

Would she make her leave the entertainment industry?

No matter how rich and powerful the Bai and Mo families were, they didn’t have the final say in the entertainment industry. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

She had tens of millions of fans.

If the Bai and Mo families really relied on their power to bully others, she could make her fans blow things up and turn the public opinion in her favor. Most of the people were sympathetic towards the weaker side, not to mention that many people hated the rich.

Most of them would definitely side with her.

Qiao Mianmian didn’t have many supporters.

As long as the matter blew up, the Mo and Bai families wouldn’t dare to lay their hands on her.

Unless they didn’t care about public opinion.

But such prestigious families cared about their reputation the most.

So…

She didn’t have to worry about anything.

Song Fei was thinking very well, but she never thought that she was thinking about the Mo and Bai families in her own way. She cared about public opinion and felt that others were the same.

But the truth was that public opinion was nothing to them.

Especially to Mo Yesi.

Anyone who knew him well knew that he was overprotective of his wife.
