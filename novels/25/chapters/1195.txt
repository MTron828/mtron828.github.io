Chapter 1197: How Can I Not Take Care of You?

“Baby, your Luo Luo is pretty impressive.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

“You’re talking about Big Brother like that? You’re no different from him, right? Aren’t you also a ten-thousand-year-old iron tree?”

His first love was with her.

Marriage was also with her.

He had never been with another woman before, nor had he ever been in love. He had been single for 25 years.

Qiao Mianmian found his teasing funny.

The pot calling the kettle black.

Mo Yesi raised an eyebrow in disagreement. “Of course I’m different from Big Brother.”

Qiao Mianmian raised her brows and asked humbly, “Oh? Then, what’s different?”

Mo Yesi looked down at her and said seriously, “I’m not Old Tie Shu. I’m a few years younger than him.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

They were essentially the same!

They were all ten-thousand-year-old iron trees!

“I’ve been thinking about what kind of sister-in-law Big Brother will find me in the future.” Mo Yesi narrowed his eyes, his expression complicated. “I didn’t expect my future sister-in-law to be a little girl.”

Mo Yesi felt a little uncomfortable at the thought of him addressing Jiang Luoli as his sister-in-law.

He had never thought that the girl Mo Shixiu liked was actually someone like Jiang Luoli.

He had thought that his brother, who was dull, old-fashioned, and meticulous, would like mature and charming women.

Jiang Luoli was just a little girl.

She was also lively and outgoing. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Mo Yesi imagined her interacting with Mo Shixiu and felt that the future sister-in-law his brother had found for him was just a child.

He didn’t know if two people with completely different personalities were suitable for each other.

However, as they grew up together, Mo Yesi knew Mo Shixiu very well.

If he decided to be together with Jiang Luoli, there would definitely be a good outcome.

Mo Shixiu never treated relationships casually.

He didn’t make a decision easily, so he must have thought about taking responsibility for Jiang Luoli.

If one day, Mo Shixiu and Jiang Luoli separated, it would definitely not be his intention.

Jiang Luoli would be one who wanted to leave.

Qiao Mianmian said, “Mo Yesi, what do you mean? You seem to have something against Luo Luo? What little girl? I’m the same age as Luo Luo. So, in your eyes, I’m also a little girl?”

Qiao Mianmian didn’t allow anyone to say anything bad about her best friend.

Not even if that person was her husband!

Mo Yesi said, “... Baby, of course, I don’t have anything against her. I’m just telling the truth. To Big Brother, Jiang Luoli is just a little girl. Think about it, Big Brother is already 30 years old. How old is Jiang Luoli? There’s a 10-year gap between them.”

Qiao Mianmian was six years younger than him.

He felt that he was much older than her and was afraid that there was a generation gap between them.

There was definitely a generation gap of ten years.

And Mo Shixiu’s personality...

Mo Yesi was a little worried that his brother’s love life would be difficult.

“As for you, you’re indeed a little girl to me.” Mo Yesi looked at the girl’s puffed-up face and pinched her cheek. “So, I really want to take good care of you, dote on you, and pamper you. You’re so much younger than me, how can I not take good care of you?”
