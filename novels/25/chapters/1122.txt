Chapter 1123: She Knew He Was Attracted

“Of all the artistes I’ve signed with, you’re the one with the most scandals in a short period of time.

“I just said that this might not be a bad thing because it’s also a sign.”

“A sign? What sign?”

“It’s a sign of becoming popular. Do you know how difficult it is for other artists to get on the trending page? There might not even be any real traffic if they spend money on it. You have real traffic, the company didn’t spend a single cent on you.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

She would rather not become famous because of a scandal.

“Will these scandals affect the endorsement of the new contract?” Although Linda looked nonchalant, Qiao Mianmian was still worried.

She had signed with MC and was now their spokesperson.

If there were any scandals during the endorsement period, it would definitely affect the brand’s image.

If it affected the brand’s image, would she lose money?

Qiao Mianmian recalled the scandals that Huang Yilin had previously exposed. After the scandals were exposed, not only did Bai Yusheng replace her as the female lead, but he also asked her to compensate for the breach of contract.

She couldn’t help but feel a little scared.

She only wanted to earn money, not lose money.

“There will at least be some impact, but it’s not a big problem.” Linda said honestly,” All famous artistes have their own scandals. Even if there are no scandals, if someone wants to mess with you, they can create a lot of scandals for you. But without actual scandals, the damage is limited.

“I’ll talk to the MC later. I know what you’re worried about. Don’t worry, I’ll talk to them before we sign the contract.

“Oh right, do you know about Qiao Anxin’s contract termination with Starlight?” Linda recalled what Zhao Kai had told her and frowned.

Qiao Mianmian nodded. “Yeah, I saw her post on Weibo just now.”

Qiao Mianmian wasn’t surprised that Qiao Anxin would terminate her contract with Starlight.

Since Su Ze was determined to break up with her, she definitely wouldn’t stay in Starlight anymore.

Moreover, now that the Su Corporation was in trouble, Qiao Anxin couldn’t stay in Starlight anymore.

She had seduced Su Ze because she had taken a fancy to Su Ze’s qualities and family background.

If the Su family fell from power and was no longer as glorious as before, how could Qiao Anxin, such a realistic woman, accompany Su Ze in his troubles?

“Just now, President Zhao called me and said that Qiao Anxin called him an hour ago. She said she wanted to sign with us. Also, she offered quite a low price. President Zhao was tempted and asked me if I mind.”

Although Zhao Kai and Linda had a good relationship. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

But deep down, he was still a businessman who prioritized profits.

Although he had asked Linda if she didn’t mind, it also meant that he wanted to sign Qiao Anxin.

Otherwise, he could directly reject her.

There was no need to call Linda.

Linda knew him well enough to know that he was tempted.

After answering the call, she was actually a little angry.

If Qiao Anxin signed with them, she would definitely not be following her.

But if they were in the same company, they would definitely meet.

Moreover, with Qiao Anxin’s current fame, the resources she would get from signing with Huanyu would definitely not be too bad. At that time, it would be inevitable for her to fight for resources.
