“But Mom shouldn’t have treated you that way.” Mo Yesi frowned at the mention of Madam Mo. “You’re my wife, and she’s my mom. Both of you are my closest people. I’m undeniably responsible for the situation.”

“This has nothing to do with you.” Qiao Mianmian wasn’t unreasonable. “It’s not like you haven’t tried to mediate. It’s Mom who’s unhappy with me and doesn’t like me. No matter how hard you try, it’s useless.

“She felt that we weren’t compatible from the start. Initially, she was dissatisfied with my family background. Now, perhaps she feels that I’ve affected your relationship with her, so she’s still dissatisfied with me.

“I know you’ve fallen out with Mom because of me. Mo Yesi, I’m really grateful for everything you’ve done for me. I’m already very satisfied and happy. You really don’t have to feel sorry for me.”

The man looked at her deeply and pursed his lips. “Even if you’ve suffered a little, I can’t bear to see it. Moreover, this grievance was caused by Mom. Even if you don’t mind, I do.”

“But I think I’m very happy.” Qiao Mianmian smiled. “I have a husband who loves me so much, and Grandma treats me very well. I have a brother who treats me very well, and now I have an older brother and biological parents...

“Mo Yesi, I’m really satisfied now.” Qiao Mianmian’s eyes sparkled. “Life can’t be perfect. I can’t force everyone to like me. To me, it’s enough that everyone I care about cares about me.”

Mo Yesi could tell that Qiao Mianmian really didn’t feel aggrieved.

She wasn’t unhappy with Madam Mo’s cold treatment.

He felt more at ease.

Looking into her bright eyes, his heart softened. He reached out and rubbed her head. “It’s good that you don’t feel aggrieved. Oh right, I have something to explain to you.”

“What?”

“I don’t know the woman Mom brought back.” Mo Yesi thought for a while and said, “It’s my first time meeting her too.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

Why was he explaining this to her?

Did he think she would misunderstand something?

Mo Yesi paused before continuing. “So, don’t misunderstand.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

She was right.

Amused, she said, “What’s there to misunderstand? Don’t I know what kind of person my husband is? I’m completely at ease with you.”

Moreover, she wasn’t like him.

He was just jealous.

Even if she was jealous, she wouldn’t so easily fall into it. He didn’t have to explain to her, she could tell that he wasn’t familiar with that woman.

“I didn’t misunderstand.” Qiao Mianmian smiled. “I know you’re not familiar with her. You’re already so disrespectful to her, can’t I tell?”

Mo Yesi nodded. He was happy that she trusted him.

But he felt a little uncomfortable seeing she really didn’t mind at all.

“You trust me that much?”

“Of course.”

“Why?”

Qiao Mianmian didn’t feel the man’s dissatisfaction. She smiled and said, “Because you’re my husband. I know you won’t do anything to let me down.”

Mo Yesi’s heart softened as he looked at the girl in his arms.
