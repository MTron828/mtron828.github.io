Chapter 1761: It’s My Turn to Pursue You Now

Removing the plaster meant that Shen Xin would be discharged soon.

Shen Xin would leave Yuncheng City soon after she was discharged.

At this thought, Qiao Chen’s eyes darkened and he felt an indescribable bitterness in his heart.

He still couldn’t keep her.

He wondered if she would still leave if he promised he’d chase her.

“Mm, that’s good.” His heart ached, but he still smiled, looking happy for her.

Shen Xin felt even worse when Qiao Chen was upset.

Because in this relationship, she was the one who gave more.

But no matter how upset she was, she forced herself not to show it.

“Qiao Chen, the college entrance examination is coming up soon. You must be very busy right now.” Shen Xin looked at the young man’s handsome and exquisite face and felt a stab of pain in her heart. She smiled bitterly and said, “Go back and revise quickly. I’m a little sleepy, I want to rest.”

How could Qiao Chen not tell that Shen Xin was tactfully telling him that he could leave?

He found it funny.

In the past, it had always been Shen Xin chasing him, and he had always been avoiding her.

But now, it was Shen Xin avoiding him.

He finally understood how she felt when he rejected her repeatedly. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Qiao Chen didn’t want to leave.

But he knew that he had no reason to stay.

He kept quiet for a while before nodding. “Alright, then... Have a good rest. I’ll come and see you another day.”

“Mm.” Shen Xin looked down and covered her tears.

“I’ll get going, then.”

Qiao Chen turned around slowly and walked towards the door.

He reached the door and opened it. Just as he was about to step out, he suddenly turned around and called out, “Shen Xin.

“Shen Xin, I like the bracelet you gave me.” Qiao Chen raised one of his wrists. He was wearing the black bracelet Shen Xin gave him. “I’ll always wear it. Also, I want to say that you pursued me for three years.

“I don’t care what you think now. I won’t give up on you so easily. Even if you transfer schools, I’ll still wait for you.”

Seeing her shocked expression, Qiao Chen smiled and continued, “Shen Xin, it’s my turn to pursue you now. I’ve already thought about it. It’s fine even if you leave Yuncheng City. I can look for you in the future.

“When my sister went to another city to film, Brother-in-law was so busy with work, but he took the time to accompany her often. As long as you have the heart, there’s nothing you can’t do.”

Shen Xin’s eyes widened in surprise.

She didn’t think Qiao Chen would say that to her.

Qiao Chen didn’t want to wait for her response. He left the ward after saying that.

The door closed gently.

Shen Xin was still staring at the door in a daze.

...

The night before the filming started.

Mo Yesi left work early and came back to help Qiao Mianmian pack her luggage.

As they were mainly going to the countryside to film, Qiao Mianmian brought along some very casual clothes, such as T-shirts, trousers, and sneakers.

Mo Yesi prepared a lot of ointment in case she got injured. There was also mosquito repellent, a flashlight, a compass, and a flare.
