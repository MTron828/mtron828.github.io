Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Wow, it’s Mianbao.”

“Is it really Mianbao? Am I seeing things?”

“It’s Mianbao, it’s really Mianbao. Mianbao, you’re finally out. We were almost angered to death by Song Fei’s fans. Also, Song Fei actually Liked the post about your scandals just now. She’s really too much. Mianbao, you can’t take this lying down.”

“That’s right, Mianbao. Song Fei and her fans are too much, you can’t take this lying down. Otherwise, they’ll think you’re easy to bully!”

“Mianbao, it’s fine if we fans feel aggrieved, but we don’t want you to feel aggrieved too. Who is that Song Fei? What right does she have to treat you like this? If Mianbao doesn’t teach her a lesson this time, she’ll definitely be even more arrogant in the future.”

Qiao Mianmian’s appearance caused a stir in the group.

The fans were furious.

They couldn’t let Song Fei and her fans off.

Qiao Mianmian also expressed that she would definitely settle this matter and not let her fans suffer for nothing.

After comforting the fans in the group for a while, Qiao Mianmian quickly called Linda.

“Sister Xie, you said that you know some dirt about Song Fei. Can you tell me how much you know? Also, how much evidence do you have?”

A moment later, Qiao Mianmian sneered. “I’m afraid this evidence isn’t enough. She’ll definitely make a comeback. Sister Xie, since I want to deal with her, why don’t I make her disappear from the entertainment industry?

“Didn’t you say that she’s a malignant tumor? Then, let us get rid of her. Treat it as getting rid of evil for society.”

Qiao Mianmian had never thought of making Song Fei leave the entertainment industry.

She didn’t want to be too harsh.

She was in this industry, too.

She knew what it meant for an artiste to leave the entertainment industry. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

But now, she felt that she didn’t have to be merciful to someone who provoked her time and time again.

What angered her the most was that her fans were humiliated on Weibo.

Song Fei must know about this too, but she pretended not to know and tolerated her fans.

Linda was right.

Song Fei and her fans were a group of malignant tumors.

Since it was harmful to society, it was best to get rid of it.

Linda was stunned.

She couldn’t believe that Qiao Mianmian could say such a thing.

After a few seconds, Linda asked again, “Mianmian, you mean… you want Song Fei to leave the entertainment industry like Little Xiao?”

“Mm, that’s about it. I think such a person will leave many children astray. Moreover, she directly Liked the post about my scandals. She provoked me so blatantly. If I don’t retaliate, how can I face her provocation?”

Linda was silent for a few more seconds.

“Sister Xie, do you think I’m too harsh?” Qiao Mianmian asked.

“No, I’m just a little shocked. This doesn’t seem like your usual way of doing things. I thought that you’d at most teach her a lesson and make her afraid of you.”

“Mm, I thought so at first, but I’ve changed my mind now.” Qiao Mianmian turned to look out the window with narrowed eyes..
