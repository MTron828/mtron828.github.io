Chapter 183: Shen Rou Felt a Sense of Enmity Towards Her?

“We’re all good friends of Ah Si, and I grew up with him as well. I heard both of you are married? Congratulations!”

Shen Rou sized Qiao Mianmian up while talking to her.

She didn’t feel good about what she saw.

Yan Shaoqing had told her that she was a student, but he didn’t say that the girl was so beautiful.

Although she still looked a bit too young and tender, her features were extremely attractive.

And her skin was so fair she was practically glowing.

Shen Rou lived in an area with strong sunlight and ultraviolet light.

Even though she applied sunscreen lotion every day and wasn’t too tanned, she appeared a lot darker when comparing herself to this girl.

That girl had a pretty little face and lush long hair. She had a nice and clean aura about her.

Shen Rou was pretty, educated, and had a rather good background.

No other girl in her social circle was more outstanding than her.

This made her a little proud, and she hardly looked up to other girls.

But this Qiao Mianmian...

This was the first time in Shen Rou’s life where she felt threatened, and also... jealous.

She had to admit that this girl’s looks were definitely comparable to hers, all things aside.

In fact... this girl looked even better than herself.

Girls were always quick to pick up the subtleties in interactions, and Qiao Mianmian was able to sense the hostility in Shen Rou’s eyes almost immediately.

She was slightly stunned.

Shen Rou felt a sense of enmity towards her?

Where was it coming from?

“Hello, Miss Shen.” Qiao Mianmian shook her hand politely.

When she reached out her hand, she felt as if Shen Rou had stolen a glance at her hand. The next moment, the hostile look in her eyes dissipated slightly.

“You don’t have to be so formal with me.” Shen Rou smiled and sounded rather nice and approachable. “You’re Ah Si’s wife, that makes us your good friends too. You can call me by my name, or Rou Rou will do.”

Shen Rou glanced at her other hand discreetly while talking and then smiled even more widely.

Qiao Mianmian was confused about what she was to look at.

What exactly was Shen Rou trying to see?

The waiter then came over with the menu.

It was a welcome gathering for Shen Rou, so she took a look at the menu before placing the order.

When she was done, she handed the menu to the waiter and smiled at Mo Yesi. “Ah Si, I ordered your food for you. We haven’t met in just a year, I suppose your tastes haven’t changed?”

Qiao Mianmian wasn’t sure if she was being too sensitive.

She felt as if Shen Rou was trying to flaunt how close she was to Mo Yesi.

A woman’s intuition was very accurate.

Mo Yesi looked up and faced her.

Shen Rou smiled and rested her chin on her hand, casually saying, “I remember when you used to come over to my house. My mom would always prepare chopped chili pepper fish for you. She said you loved it.

“I didn’t like that dish initially, but after having it with you so many times, I started liking it too.

“I actually missed that dish when I was overseas. I thought I had to ask you out for a meal of that when I return.”

On that note, she smiled again. “I wonder what the chopped chili pepper fish at this restaurant tastes like.”
