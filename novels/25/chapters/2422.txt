Chapter 2424: Is the Shen Family Doing This on Purpose?

Mo Yesi smiled and whispered into her ear.

Qiao Mianmian widened her eyes and looked up at him in shock.

“Are you kidding me?”

Mo Yesi looked at her deeply. “It’s not a joke. Baby, I’m serious. This is the most useful method.”

“Of course, this is the only way. There’s no need to do this unless it’s necessary.

“I don’t think the process matters as long as the outcome is good.

“Didn’t you ask me for a solution? You just want to see them end up together.”

“Yes, but…”

“So.” Mo Yesi caressed her fair cheeks and caressed her delicate skin with his slender fingers. “I think it’s feasible. Think about Big Brother and Jiang Luoli. They’re similar.”

Qiao Mianmian didn’t say anything.

Alright.

She had to admit that Mo Yesi made sense.

And his method was indeed more effective.

She felt that it wasn’t appropriate because she felt that it would aggrieve the girl.

But if Shen Xin was willing, it didn’t seem to be a problem.

“Alright, I don’t think you have to worry about this now. Isn’t it too early?” The fingers on her cheek slowly slid to her ear and pinched her petite earlobe. “They’re still young. To them, studying is the most important. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“Even if we can really do it, we still have a few years.

“They have just been separated. Time is the best way to dilute feelings.

“So, it’s not certain if they can really get together. There’s no need for you to be so prepared.”

Qiao Mianmian felt that she was worrying too early.

Qiao Chen was only 18 now.

It was still four years away from the legal marriage age.

During these four years, he and Shen Xin were going to different universities.

Mo Yesi was right. Time was the best way to dilute feelings.

Most long-distance relationships didn’t end well.

She really didn’t have to worry too much.

“Alright, then I won’t think about this anymore.”

…

After Qiao Chen’s surgery, Qiao Mianmian got busy again.

The jewelry store under the Mo Corporation officially announced that their company’s jewelry spokesperson for the next season was Qiao Mianmian.

The netizens commented on the official Weibo post.

“Hahaha, the Mo Corporation’s spokesperson for the next season’s jewelry is Qiao Mianmian? Is this keeping the goodies from others? I want to know how much the endorsement fee Chairman Mo gave his fiancée is. Or is Qiao Mianmian endorsing the jewelry under her fiancé for free?”

“Wow. Mianmian is so beautiful. The Mo Corporation’s jewelry has always been simple and elegant. Mianmian’s temperament is quite suitable. I don’t think it’s a big deal to endorse the jewelry of her fiancé’s company. Of course, we should give good resources to our own people. Moreover, with Mianmian’s current popularity and status, she can afford to endorse it.”

“The jewelry store under the Shen family has just officially announced the spokesperson for the new season. It’s actually Little Xiao. I remember that Little Xiao and Qiao Mianmian have had a conflict before. Is the Shen family doing this on purpose? They posted it on Weibo at the same time, and they even found Little Xiao to be the spokesperson.”
