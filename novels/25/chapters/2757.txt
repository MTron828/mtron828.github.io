The live stream was in a heated discussion.

When the netizens realized that Qiao Mianmian was still focused on eating, the comments increased rapidly. In just a minute, there were thousands of comments.

“Mianmian looks so cute when she’s eating. Her cheeks are like a pufferfish.”

“Mianmian looks so appetizing. She smells so good.”

“Mianbao, you’re so lucky. Is Chairman Mo’s steak especially good? I didn’t expect Chairman Mo to be so caring and gentle.”

Qiao Mianmian looked at the netizens’ comments. She swallowed the food in her mouth and was about to reply when a strong hand pressed on her shoulder and turned her around.

The man stuffed another glass of fruit juice into her hand domineeringly. “Focus on eating, don’t be distracted.”

Then, he glanced at the live stream, as if he didn’t see the countless “Chairman Mo” on the screen. He said calmly, “All of you, quiet down. If there’s anything, wait for her to finish her meal.”

With that, Mo Yesi ignored the live stream and turned to serve Qiao Mianmian.

The live stream was filled with howls again.

“Chairman Mo is so handsome!”

“I can do this!”

“Chairman Mo really pampers Mianmian. I’m so envious!” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

After breakfast, Mo Yesi sent Qiao Mianmian to C City.

The crew had arranged for a car.

However, because Mo Yesi wanted to send Qiao Mianmian off personally, the car prepared by the crew became useless.

Two crew members got into Mo Yesi’s Rolls Royce.

Mo Yesi didn’t call the chauffeur and drove by himself.

As they were in the big boss’s car, they enjoyed the benefits. The two crew members were so afraid that they didn’t even dare to breathe.

Qiao Mianmian woke up early today. Sleepy after eating, she fell asleep not long after getting into the car.

Besides Qiao Mianmian, Mo Yesi didn’t have much to talk to anyone else.

Hence, the three-hour drive was especially quiet.

No one spoke.

...

Three hours later, they finally arrived at C City.

The moment they got off the car, the netizens in the live stream heard two long sighs.

These two sighs seemed like a huge sigh of relief as if they’d just survived a disaster.

Even though the netizens couldn’t see the crew members following them, they could feel their nervousness.

They were so happy to hear their breathing.

“Hahaha, I’m dying of laughter. Why do I feel like the crew members are afraid of Chairman Mo?”

“I can feel it, too. The funniest thing is that when Chairman Mo glanced at them in the rearview mirror twice, I felt like the camera shook.”

“Hahaha, right, right, right. The camera really shook twice. I laughed so hard.”

“I don’t think the crew members are to blame for being timid. Chairman Mo’s aura is too strong. If it was me, I’d be nervous and afraid too. He only becomes gentle and easygoing when he’s with Qiao Mianmian.. He’s so cold to everyone else.”
