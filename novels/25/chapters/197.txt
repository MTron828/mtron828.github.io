Chapter 198: It’s Very Important

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Baby...” Mo Yesi mumbled by her ear. “Don’t try to escape it. And you don’t have to be afraid, I’ll try my best to be gentle so that I won’t hurt you.”

He heard that a woman’s first time hurt a lot.

That night, he’d drugged her, but she still teared up from the pain.

The next few times slowly got better.

She had already given him her first time.

So... it shouldn’t hurt that much, right?

Moreover, they’d done it several times, and they seemed pretty in sync over time.

Mo Yesi was confident that he’d give her a good time tonight.

His lips shifted down slowly. “Leave it to me, I’ll make you happy.”

“W-Wait!”

Qiao Mianmian stiffened up and was about to cry. “D-Didn’t you say I could go shower first.”

“Mm. But I can’t wait any longer now.”

The girl had a sweet fragrant scent around her.

She was standing so close that he was going mad from how good she smelt.

Initially, he’d just been poking fun at her. He wasn’t serious about wanting her right now.

But now, he’d fallen into his own pit.

His desires were piqued and he was losing control.

His voice got hoarse as he pulled her in closer. “Baby, give it to me, alright?”

“I...”

Qiao Mianmian only said a word before her world began to spin. Mo Yesi had suddenly carried her up.

Before she could respond, he was carrying her towards the huge black bed.

Qiao Mianmian’s heart was running wild.

When she landed on the soft bed, she closed her eyes in embarrassment.

Knowing that she couldn’t escape it, she wasn’t thinking about it anymore.

Since he wanted it so badly... she’d just give it to him.

Men were all the same. They found all ways to get it when they couldn’t.

But once it was on hand, they’d slowly lose interest in it.

If she refused to give it to him, he’d keep it in mind all the time. Giving it to him, however, would likely stop him from thinking about it non-stop.

Although she was already mentally prepared for it, Qiao Mianmian still found it hard to open up to him for it. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“Baby.”

Mo Yesi kissed her gently. “Relax. Open your eyes and look at me.”

Qiao Mianmian turned her head to the side and closed her eyes.

She couldn’t face him.

Mo Yesi smiled when he saw that her cheeks were red and her eyes were squeezed. He kissed her on her temple while murmuring, “Baby, my Baby...”

Qiao Mianmian was grabbing the bed sheet.

When Mo Yesi was about to remove her clothes, she suddenly yelled, “Mo Yesi.”

“Mm?” The man’s voice was so deep.

Qiao Mianmian bit her lip and took a deep breath. When she spoke again, her voice was quiet and quivering. “I-I have something to say to you.”

“Now?” The man was evidently trying his best to control himself. She could see beads of perspiration on his forehead. “Baby, now’s not the time to talk about things. We can talk about it later.”

With that, he kissed her once again.

Qiao Mianmian opened her eyes and hesitated for a while. But she went on. “It’s very, very important.”
