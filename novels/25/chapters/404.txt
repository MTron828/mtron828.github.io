“Linda has been with Star Splendor for so long. She must be furious to be fired by Su Ze in this manner.

“I think that’s one of the reasons she wants you. She’s planning to get back at Su Ze and Qiao Anxin. The other reason is that she wants you for your potential and to produce good results for Huan Yu.

“In order for her to be respected in the new company, she needs to bring over some artists as well. If she can make a nobody like you popular, she can show her capabilities to her new boss. Hence, she will put in her best effort to make you popular.

“I feel that her terms are really attractive. What are your thoughts?”

Qiao Mianmian thought for a while as she supported herself with her hand. Then, she replied, “I feel the terms are really attractive as well.”

“Babe, this is an opportunity for you. Can’t you see that you’re on a streak recently? Xie Linda approached you immediately after you got the third female character in Big Brother Bai’s new show. I was planning to find you to discuss getting a manager, and Xie Linda approached immediately as well.

“Huan Yu is the largest and best management agency in the country. They have a lot of top artistes under them. Even though Star Splendor’s recent development is great, it cannot measure up to them.”

“Yes, I understand.” Qiao Mianmian nodded. “If I go there, it would be great too.”

“So, are you going to...”

“No need to rush. Let’s wait for a couple of days first. I’m pretty sure she wouldn’t mind waiting for a couple of days if she’s keen on the deal.”

There were some issues Qiao Mianmian had to figure out before coming to a decision.

There were serious implications after signing the contract, so she had to be careful.

“That’s true as well. It wouldn’t hurt to be more careful. But I feel that if her objective is purely to manage you to make you popular, signing the contract with her would be a great choice.”

...

In the afternoon.

Qiao Mianmian made plans with Jiang Luoli to eat river snails rice noodles at the shop near school. As they headed downstairs, holding hands, Qiao Mianmian received a message from Mo Yesi.

He asked: [Miss Qiao, are you available for lunch?]

Qiao Mianmian stopped in her tracks.

“Babe, what’s wrong?” Jiang Luoli asked as she saw Qiao Mianmian come to an abrupt stop.

“Hmm. Luo Luo, I can’t join you this afternoon,” Qiao Mianmian explained. “Why don’t we eat tomorrow?”

Jiang Luoli was puzzled for a while, before realizing that the message was from Mo Yesi.

She wasn’t going to interrupt her best friend’s date with her husband.

“Sure, any time. Did Prince Charming ask you out for lunch? Have fun.”

Qiao Mianmian pouted and said, “Why don’t you come along?”

“No, I’m not going.” Jiang Luoli shook her head. “I’m not going along to be a third-wheel. It’s alright, enjoy each other’s company.”

“Hmm, he isn’t here yet.”

“Then, just wait for him at home. I’ll go off first, then.”

Qiao Mianmian stood at the door and watched Jiang Luoli leave. She then closed the door and replied Mo Yesi. [Chairman Mo, aren’t you really busy? Why do you have the time to ask me out for lunch? Don’t you have a lunch meeting with anyone?]

Mo Yesi immediately replied, [Yes, I do.]

Before Qiao Mianmian could reply, Mo Yesi followed up with another message. [I have a lunch meeting with Chairman Wang from Heng Tong Company. But if you agree to meet me, I will immediately push off this meeting.]

Qiao Mianmian smiled as she read the message.

The message showed how important she was to Mo Yesi and that he really wanted to make her happy.
