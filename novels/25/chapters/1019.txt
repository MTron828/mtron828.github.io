Chapter 1020: With Her Strength, I Think She Can’t Resist It

Qiao Mianmian looked at him and blinked.

Mo Yesi pondered for a while and said, “My Big Brother is a very opinionated person. It can be said that no one can affect him when he decides on something. In this aspect, I’m very similar to him.”

Mo Yesi knew what she was worried about, so he reassured her first. “We’re all the same. We’ve already decided on our own. Unless we change our minds, no one can control us.

“Even if it’s family.”

Qiao Mianmian felt a little more at ease.

Mo Yesi knew her well and knew what she was worried about.

She was worried that Jiang Luoli wouldn’t be liked by Madam Mo like her.

She would be aggrieved by Madam Mo.

After all, Jiang Luoli’s family background was much worse than hers.

Madam Mo despised the Qiao family. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Moreover, the Jiang family was much worse than the Qiao family.

She’d only met Mo Shixiu once.

She didn’t know what kind of person he was.

If he was the kind of man who was filial to his parents and listened to them, he definitely wouldn’t be able to protect Jiang Luoli.

Mo Yesi must have seen what she was worried about.

That was why he said those words to her.

“Then guess, will Luo Luo and Big Brother end up together?” Qiao Mianmian thought for a while and looked at him. “They’re having dinner together tonight, and Luo Luo will talk to him about this. What do you think Luo Luo will choose?”

“You want me to guess?” Mo Yesi raised an eyebrow.

“Mm, take a guess. Aren’t you the best at guessing others’ thoughts? And you’re always so accurate.” So accurate that she wondered if he could read her mind.

Hence, she really wanted to know what Jiang Luoli would choose.

“Baby, although I can guess what others are thinking, I don’t like to guess. I’m only interested in what you’re thinking, and I only want to guess your heart.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

Was he flirting with her?

The corners of her lips twitched. She shook his arm and said coquettishly, “Luo Luo isn’t anyone else. She’s my best friend. Just take it as a guess. I know you’re the best.”

It worked.

The man seemed to enjoy it. He immediately fulfilled her request and analyzed it for her seriously. “If you’re asking for my opinion, I think she’ll agree to date my brother in the end.”

Qiao Mianmian was shocked. “Why?”

She felt that Jiang Luoli would reject Mo Shixiu.

Even if Mo Shixiu was really an outstanding man.

But for a girl like Jiang Luoli, freedom was the most important.

At least, that was what she knew about her.

Mo Yesi smiled. “No reason. Didn’t you say that she likes pretty and handsome people?”

Qiao Mianmian was confused.

“My Big Brother’s face should be rather attractive to her. If she really likes pretty and handsome people, my Big Brother must be very attractive to her. With her determination, I don’t think she can resist it.

“No matter how rational she acted previously, once she sees my Big Brother, she’ll definitely lose all rationality.

“If she’s determined to reject my Big Brother, it’s best not to meet him. Rejecting him over the phone will have a higher chance of success.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.
