Chapter 1613: She’s Second Young Master Mo’s Girlfriend

Madam Gong was shocked by Gong Zeli’s actions.

She knew her son well.

Although he had a bad temper, he was still gentlemanly in front of girls.

Moreover, the Shangguan and Gong families were friends.

He shouldn’t treat Shangguan Qing like this.

“Qingqing, don’t be afraid. Auntie is here, he won’t dare to do anything to you.” Madam Gong comforted Shangguan Qing. She then looked up and glared at her son. “Zeli, you’re too much. You actually hit a girl. You disappointed me today.

“Apologize to Qingqing now.”

Gong Zeli sneered. “If she wasn’t a girl, I wouldn’t have just given her a verbal warning. Mom, let me tell you one last time.

“Don’t interfere in my matters.”

With that, Gong Zeli left the dining room.

Madam Gong and Shangguan Qing, who was still panicking, watched as he left without looking back.

After Gong Zeli left.

Shangguan Qing burst into tears.

She was crying from fear.

Madam Gong quickly comforted her.

But the more she comforted her, the harder she cried.

“Auntie, Brother Zeli has fallen for that vixen. He actually hit me because of that vixen. Auntie, you have to uphold justice for me.” Shangguan Qing leaned on Madam Gong and cried hard.

Madam Gong was stunned. She wiped the tears off her face and asked, “Qingqing, you said that Zeli has fallen for a vixen? Who is this vixen you’re talking about?”

“Who else could it be? It’s that actress called Qiao Mianmian.”

Shangguan Qing sobbed and gritted her teeth as she talked about Qiao Mianmian. “That vixen not only seduced Brother Zeli, but she also seduced Bai Yusheng. I heard that she has a very ambiguous relationship with the male actor on the set. How could Brother Zeli fall for such a woman!”

Madam Gong’s expression darkened.

She frowned. “Zeli fell for an actress? When did this happen, why didn’t I know?”

“Auntie, you don’t even care about the entertainment industry, of course you don’t know.” Shangguan Qing saw that Madam Gong was still confused. She quickly took out her cell phone and found a photo of Qiao Mianmian for her to see.

She pointed at the photo and said fiercely, “It’s this vixen!” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Madam Gong looked down and found her familiar at first glance. After taking a closer look, her expression changed.

“Qingqing, are you sure Zeli likes her?”

“I’m sure!” Shangguan Qing gritted her teeth. “I wasn’t very sure at first. But you saw how protective Brother Zeli was of her just now. If he didn’t like this vixen, would he protect her like this?”

Madam Gong frowned. “Qingqing, are you mistaken? I’ve seen this girl before. She’s Second Young Master Mo’s girlfriend, how could she possibly seduce Zeli? If you cannot prove it, you’d better not say anything.”

“What?!”

Shangguan Qing widened her eyes in shock. “Auntie, you’re saying that this actress is Second Young Master Mo’s girlfriend?”

Madam Gong attended the banquet the Mo Family held for Qiao Chen that night.

He’d seen Qiao Mianmian at the banquet.

Although they’d only met once, Madam Gong had a deep impression of Qiao Mianmian because of her outstanding appearance.

She still remembered what she looked like.
