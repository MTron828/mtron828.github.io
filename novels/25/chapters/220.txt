Lei En glanced at Qiao Chen and said with a smile, “Young Master, Young Madam, Mr. Qiao’s room is ready. Do you want to have a look with Mr. Qiao now?”

“Yeah.” Mo Yesi nodded. “Bring him over to take a look first.”

Then, he turned and said to Qiao Chen, “Go and check your room first. If there’s anything you’re dissatisfied with, or if there’s something lacking, you can just tell Lei En. He’s the butler here.”

Lei En smiled at Qiao Chen. “Mr. Qiao, please come with me.”

Qiao Chen glanced at Qiao Mianmian helplessly. “Sister.”

“Go on.” Qiao Mianmian patted his shoulder. “I’ll come and find you in a while. Just go to butler Lei En if you need anything.”

...

Qiao Mianmian and Mo Yesi returned to their bedroom.

“Don’t be too good to Chen Chen.” Qiao Mianmian was still thinking of the car and frowned slightly. She said disapprovingly, “He’s still a student now and stays in the school. He won’t be able to use it if you give him a car.

“And it’s too ostentatious.”

The cars Mo Yesi drove were all luxurious cars.

The car he would give Qiao Chen was naturally not far behind.

Qiao Chen attended an ordinary high school.

It would be too eye-catching if he drove a luxury car to school.

And most importantly, he was still too young. Giving him such a luxurious car would change his values.

“Are you still thinking about that?”

Chuckling, Mo Yesi reached out to close the door before bringing her into his embrace.

Snuggling his head on top of hers, he rubbed against her head affectionately. “He’s your brother, someone you care about. That’s why I want to be good to him. It’s just a car, how is it ostentatious?”

“I know, but...”

“Baby.” Mo Yesi seemed to know what she was about to say. He touched her lips with his slender fingers and then chuckled softly. “If you’re worried about it being too ostentatious, how about I give him a cheaper one? I gave him a watch previously, but you said it was too expensive. Now that I want to give him a car, you said that it’s too ostentatious.

“What do you want me to do?

“I just want to give my brother-in-law a gift to get his affection, so that he can help me say a few good words in front of his sister. Can’t I do that?”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

She looked confused as she said, “We’re already married. In fact, you don’t have to...”

“Shhh, listen to me.”

He pressed his slender and pale fingers gently on her lips, his deep eyes filled with a soft and coquettish smile. “Baby, do you know? I don’t only want to obtain your body, I want to obtain your heart even more.” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

The man’s gaze was sincere, and he seemed to open his heart to her without reservation. “Although we didn’t get married out of love, I hope that we’ll have love in our marriage in the future. Mianmian, I hope you can fall in love with me.”

“Mo Yesi...”

“I know that this process can’t be rushed. So I have to find ways to make you harbor feelings for me, and when your affections for me accumulate, then you might fall in love with me someday.”

There was no response.

“The fastest way to gain your affection is to be kind towards you and the people you care about. I know that you and Qiao Chen have a good relationship, so now, I’m trying to win your favor by pleasing him. Please don’t stop me, okay?”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

This was the first time she met a man like Mo Yesi.
