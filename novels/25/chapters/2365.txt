Chapter 2367: Don’t Even Think About It

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

He knew how it felt to be worried about personal gains and losses.

But what could he do?

Even if she was an ingrate, he still liked her.

He was going to be eaten up by this ingrate for the rest of his life.

Qiao Mianmian was unhappy. She grabbed his collar and pulled him down. “Mo Yesi, make it clear. How am I an ingrate? Am I not good to you?”

“Mm, good, very good.” Mo Yesi nodded.

“Then, why do you call me an ingrate?”

“Alright, I was wrong.” Mo Yesi knew that if she made a fuss, there would be no end to it. Hence, he didn’t even explain and just raised the white flag. “You’re not an ingrate, I am.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

“No.” Qiao Mianmian was stubborn. “You have to make things clear. How am I an ingrate?”

Mo Yesi was speechless.

“Didn’t I say that I was wrong?”

“You didn’t mean it!”

“…”

“You admitted your mistake, but I know you still think I’m an ingrate!”

“…”

“If you don’t clarify things with me today, I’ll… I’ll sleep in another room tonight!” Qiao Mianmian wanted to threaten Mo Yesi, but she didn’t know how to. In the end, she said this without confidence.

She felt that he would only care if she threatened him with this.

After all, no matter what he meant, he seemed to… need her.

He once said that he could only sleep well with her in his arms.

He hadn’t slept well when she was filming.

Qiao Mianmian could prove it.

Because when Mo Yesi went to visit her, his dark eye circles were visible. It was obvious that he didn’t sleep well.

He had a sleep disorder.

He mentioned that before he met her, his sleep had always been terrible. He could only sleep for three to four hours every day, and that was already good quality sleep.

Most of the time, he would wake up three or four times a night.

And once he did, it was very difficult to go back to sleep.

But when he was with her, he could sleep for at least six hours.

Although Qiao Mianmian didn’t know why Mo Yesi could sleep better with her, he still needed her.

“Nonsense!” Mo Yesi frowned slightly.

Qiao Mianmian pouted. “No, I’ll sleep alone. Anyway, you’re despising me. You’re calling me an ingrate and heartless! Hmph, I’ll get someone to tidy up the guest room when we get back.”

“Qiao Mianmian, let me tell you, don’t even think about it.” Mo Yesi pinched her chin and leaned towards her. His warm breath landed on her lips as he bit her lip lightly. “You can only sleep with me. I have the key to every guest room. I’ll go to whichever room you go to.” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“…”

“Are you unhappy that I said that? Or do you think you’re actually very good to me?”

“Mm.”

The man lowered his head and bit the corner of her lips. He didn’t use much force, but it was a little punishing.

Qiao Mianmian frowned.
