Chapter 665: You and Miss Qiao... You Know Each Other?

“Is Director Bai a man you can covet? Let me warn you, this industry isn’t as good as you think. If you want to continue in this industry, you’d better know your place.”

With that, Huang Yilin turned to leave.

The moment she turned around and saw the person standing behind her, her expression changed slightly, and her eyes flickered unnaturally. “Yilei, when did you arrive? Why didn’t you say anything? You scared me.”

Tu Yilei looked at her and smiled. “I just arrived. I saw you and Miss Qiao chatting here, so I came to say hi.”

He looked past Huang Yilin and smiled at Qiao Mianmian. “Good morning, Miss Qiao.”

Qiao Mianmian was stunned for a moment before smiling. “Good morning, Mr. Tu.”

Huang Yilin’s expression stiffened when she saw Tu Yilei greeting Qiao Mianmian.

“Yilei, you and Miss Qiao... you know each other?” Huang Yilin didn’t know when Tu Yilei got behind her, nor did she know how much he’d heard from Qiao Mianmian.

If they knew each other and had a good relationship...

Her expression darkened at this thought.

This newbie was way more scheming than she thought.

She was just a nobody.

But not only did she attract Bai Yusheng’s attention, but even Tu Yilei also seemed to treat her differently.

Tu Yilei had a good personality and didn’t put on airs in front of anyone.

But this didn’t mean that he was passionate about everyone.

It didn’t mean that he was willing to approach someone.

Tu Yilei was the one who greeted Qiao Mianmian first.

As a woman, Huang Yilin could feel that he looked at Qiao Mianmian differently from the other actresses.

Although it didn’t seem like much.

But on closer inspection, it was different.

One was Bai Yusheng, the other was Tu Yilei. The two most popular single men in the industry were actually interested in this newbie.

Huang Yilin couldn’t help but feel jealous.

She should be the center of attention.

These men should be looking at her.

But now, her limelight had been stolen by a newbie.

Huang Yilin bit her lip and glared daggers at Qiao Mianmian.

This glance scared Nana, and she couldn’t help but shrink towards Qiao Mianmian.

Tu Yilei saw how Huang Yilin glared at Qiao Mianmian. He kept quiet for a while and smiled. “Mm, I do. Miss Qiao is my friend. I wanted to introduce you to her and ask you to take care of her. I didn’t expect you to know each other too.

“It seems like I don’t have to introduce you anymore.”

Qiao Mianmian was surprised and looked at him in shock. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

But Tu Yilei blinked at her as if telling her not to expose him.

Huang Yilin felt as if they were flirting right in front of her.

She clenched her fist and bit her lip, cursing the vixen in her heart. She smiled insincerely and said, “It’s my first time meeting Miss Qiao, so we don’t know each other. Moreover, with a big star like you taking care of her, do you still need me?”
