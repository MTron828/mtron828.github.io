Chapter 2076: The Real Princess

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“The moment it was revealed that Qiao Anxin was slandering Qiao Mianmian behind her back, Qiao Anxin’s scandals were exposed. Why do I feel like her scandals were Qiao Mianmian’s retaliation?”

“Even if Qiao Anxin’s scandals were leaked by Qiao Mianmian, it’s not surprising. The first to flirt is cheap. She’s using such underhanded means behind her back. If I were Qiao Mianmian, I’d retaliate too. Moreover, Qiao Mianmian is the little princess of the Bai family now. Isn’t Qiao Anxin overestimating herself?”

“Qiao Mianmian was defamed. I’ve seen Qiao Anxin’s scandals, and they’re full of evidence.”

“Qiao Anxin probably won’t be able to clear her name this time.”

“I’m not interested in Qiao Anxin. Is there anyone who wants to tell me about the Bai family? Is Qiao Mianmian really the daughter of the Bai family?”

…

It was very lively on Weibo.

Qiao Mianmian only found out about Bai Yusheng’s two posts after receiving Linda’s call.

Linda was shocked. “Mianmian, is it true? You’re the little princess of the Bai family? Bai Yusheng is your biological brother? Tell me, is this true?”

“Mm, Sister Xie. It’s true.” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“It’s actually true?! So, you’re really the little princess of the Bai family?! Oh my God, my artiste isn’t just the Young Madam of the Mo family, but also the little princess of the Bai family?! Qiao Mianmian, tell me, are you hiding anything else from me? You might as well tell me at once, in case my heart suffers a huge blow next time. I’m afraid my heart won’t be able to take it.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

“No. I’m not hiding anything else from you.”

“Really?” Linda sounded unconvinced.

Qiao Mianmian nodded. “Mm, really.”

“I believe you.”

“Mm?” Qiao Mianmian blinked. “Sister Xie, what did you believe?”

Linda said, “I finally believe that you’re in the entertainment industry because you like acting. You’re the little princess of the Bai family and the Young Madam of the Mo family. If you didn’t really like acting, would you be in the entertainment industry?

“Becoming the daughter of a rich family or the Young Madam of a rich family is a hundred times better than being an artiste.

“It’s all over Weibo now. You’re the party involved, I think you should post an explanation.”

After chatting with Linda, Qiao Mianmian opened Weibo.

After reading the two posts and some netizens’ comments, she thought for a while and reposted one.

Qiao Mianmian V: “Mm, this is my brother, the kind with the same parents. Please don’t spread rumors about me and my brother anymore, it’s really awkward.”

“Wow, Mianmian finally responded on Weibo.”

“Our Mianmian is really the little princess of the Bai family.”

“Mm, Sister Mianmian, we all know. The unscrupulous media is really annoying. They love to spread rumors. They definitely won’t dare to spread rumors about you in the future. You’re the little princess of the Bai family. If anyone dares to spread rumors about you, show them the spirit of a little princess.”

“I think we should call her Princess Mianmian in the future. After all, our Mianmian is a real princess.”

In the comment section, a group of fans started calling her “Little Mianmian”. Qiao Mianmian was embarrassed.

She didn’t want too many people to know about this previously because she didn’t want to be too high-profile.

But now… the whole Internet knew about it.

She probably couldn’t keep a low profile anymore.
