Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

Mo Yesi let go of her and held her hand. “Did Fourth Bro treat you well?”

Qiao Mianmian’s eyes widened as she recalled the call. “Mo Yesi, are you here because Gong Zeli is here too?”

If that was the case, she didn’t know what to say.

This jealousy was too exaggerated. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

It was more exaggerated than ever.

Mo Yesi narrowed his eyes. “You think I’m jealous of Fourth Bro? Why do you think so?”

“You don’t have to say it.” Qiao Mianmian was amused. “You just mind that I had two scandals with him previously. Didn’t I tell you there’s nothing between us? The encounter on the plane was just a coincidence, and the subsequent one was also a coincidence.

“Aren’t you good friends with him? Don’t you know what your brother is like and whether he’s trustworthy?”

Qiao Mianmian felt Mo Yesi’s expression change slightly.

She didn’t know what Gong Zeli was thinking about her.

Gong Zeli was his brother, and he used to think that he understood him.

But now, he really didn’t know what Gong Zeli was thinking.

He trusted his wife, but he didn’t trust Gong Zeli.

Otherwise, he wouldn’t have come.

It was precisely because he knew he was similar to Gong Zeli in some aspects that he knew very well that once they had what they wanted, they had to get it no matter what.

If he couldn’t get it, he wouldn’t give up so easily.

He never believed that Gong Zeli would be willing to give up.

“You really came because of him?” Qiao Mianmian was speechless. “Mo Yesi, you’re exaggerating. You don’t even believe your own brother. You’re making me feel pressured.”

The man was too possessive.

Although this was a show of concern for her, Qiao Mianmian was really stressed.

She knew that he was jealous and kept a distance from Gong Zeli.

If the sense of security he wanted was that she couldn’t communicate with the opposite sex, then she definitely couldn’t do it.

She liked him and was willing to be with him.

But love wasn’t the only thing in her life.

Love was just a part of her life.

But she could feel that Mo Yesi cared about this relationship more than anything else.

Love might not be everything to him, but it occupied about 70% of his life.

The man pursed his lips and looked at her silently.

Qiao Mianmian said, “...You’re really making me feel pressured. In the future, even if I interact normally with other men, I’ll be worried you’ll misunderstand, be jealous, and be angry.

“I’ll be careful when I talk to others.

“I’ll feel tired.”

Qiao Mianmian looked at the silent man and sighed. She tried to reason with him. “Mo Yesi, can you trust me more? I’m already married to you, I want to spend the rest of my life with you.

“If marriage doesn’t give you a sense of security, then I really don’t know what to do.”

The man was silent for a long time before saying, “So, I’m making you feel pressured?”
