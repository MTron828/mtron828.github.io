Chapter 2397: Are You Two Dating?

“Qiao Chen…”

The girl sitting opposite finally couldn’t hold it in anymore and asked with jealousy and dissatisfaction, “Can I ask a question?”

Qiao Chen turned to look at her. “What do you want to ask?”

“You and Shen Xin…” The girl bit her lip and looked at them. “Are you two dating?”

Shen Xin was stunned. Just as she was about to speak, Qiao Chen replied first. “No, I’m still pursuing Shen Xin. She hasn’t agreed to it.”

“W-What?” The girl widened her eyes in shock.

The others also felt like a huge melon had landed on their heads. They were all stunned.

Qiao Chen was chasing Shen Xin?

Was the sun rising from the west?

Hadn’t Shen Xin been chasing Qiao Chen all along?

But now they reversed roles?

Of course, this wasn’t the main point. The main point was that Shen Xin still hadn’t agreed?

Didn’t she like Qiao Chen very much?

What was going on?

Shen Xin was also stunned. She turned around and looked at the person beside her.

“Qiao Chen, are you serious?” the girl asked with a pale face.

“Of course.” Qiao Chen looked calm. “Previously, because of my inferiority complex, many people thought that I didn’t like Shen Xin. And because I didn’t explain in time, many misunderstandings towards her were created, causing her to suffer a lot.

“So, she’s still unwilling to accept my pursuit.

“But I won’t give up.”

At this point, Qiao Chen turned to look at Shen Xin with gentle eyes. “Shen Xin, I’ve said it before. It’s my turn to chase you. Today, everyone sitting here is my witness. You’ve chased me for four years. No matter what, I have to chase you for four years.”

Shen Xin looked at him blankly.

“Qiao Chen, you…”

“I’m serious.” Qiao Chen’s eyes were bright, and the outline of the young man’s handsome and exquisite face was clearer and clearer. His eyes were firm as he expressed his determination in front of everyone. “Shen Xin, it’s my turn to chase you from now on, alright?”

“Qiao Chen, I…” Shen Xin was at a loss for words.

“You don’t have to answer me now. You can think about it when you get back. You know my cell phone number. Call me when you’ve thought about it.”

The others at the table didn’t expect to eat dog food.

Who would have thought that Qiao Chen liked Shen Xin?

This was probably the most shocking thing to happen in the past few years.

The girls who mocked Shen Xin for being shameless and clinging to Qiao Chen felt their butts burn.

As for the boys who had a crush on Shen Xin, although they felt jealous, they weren’t as petty as the girls and quickly accepted reality.

They knew very well.

Even if Shen Xin wasn’t with Qiao Chen, she couldn’t be with any of them.

Although they had a crush on her, they knew their place.

If Qiao Chen wanted to chase Shen Xin, they probably wouldn’t be a match. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Shen Xin had always liked him.

He was also very eligible.

If Shen Xin was going to get married in the future, they would rather it be Qiao Chen than another man.
