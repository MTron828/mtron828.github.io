Chapter 1518: She Wanted to Get Close to Him, But She Was Afraid of Him

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“So it’s because of Qiao Mianmian. She’s so influential.”

“I remember that when Qiao Mianmian publicly announced her relationship with her boyfriend, Young Master Gong followed her boyfriend and even reposted her Weibo. Her boyfriend must have a good relationship with Young Master Gong. Young Master Gong knows that she’s here, so...”

“In that case, Qiao Mianmian is rather valued by her boyfriend. Even Young Master Gong thinks so highly of her.”

“Her boyfriend and Young Master Gong are good friends, so her boyfriend must be very impressive too. I’m so envious of her. A real Cinderella would be a rich lady when she marries into a rich family.”

“I’m really curious about her boyfriend.”

“Anyway, it has something to do with the Mo family. Even if it’s a side family, it’s a very powerful identity.”

Qiao Mianmian walked into the dining room and saw that Gong Zeli was already sitting at the dining table.

The long dining table was filled with delicious food.

“Young Master, Miss Qiao is here.”

Gong Zeli looked up and saw Nana with Qiao Mianmian. He frowned and quickly returned to normal.

He smiled. “I didn’t know what you like to eat, so I got the kitchen to make some of everything. See if there’s anything you like on the table. If not, get the chef to make a few more dishes.”

Qiao Mianmian glanced at the table and then looked away. “I’m not picky, I’m fine with anything.”

“That’s good.”

Gong Zeli shot her a look. “Sit down. We’ve known each other for a while, you don’t have to be so formal. Is this lady beside you your assistant?”

“Y-Young Master Gong, nice to meet you. I’m Mianmian’s assistant. My name is Nana.” Nana looked up at Gong Zeli and was shocked by the man’s cold and gentle gaze.

She didn’t dare to look at him again.

Damn, Young Master Gong was really good-looking.

But this sort of handsome man could only be seen from afar.

No matter how much Nana coveted his looks, she wouldn’t dare to touch such a man.

Gong Zeli only asked who she was and didn’t talk to her anymore.

After Qiao Mianmian and Nana sat down, a few housemaids brought others in.

When the group of people entered, the hall became much livelier.

Gong Zeli looked unhappy. Normally, if anyone disturbed his peace, he would have gotten someone to chase them out.

But he still had to rely on these people to have a proper meal with Qiao Mianmian.

Hence, no matter how unhappy and disgusted he was, he held it in.

The group of people saw Gong Zeli sitting in the middle of the table.

The man was extremely outstanding. Even the handsome men and beautiful women in the entertainment industry were impressed.

The women looked at the handsome man and couldn’t help but be smitten.

Gong Zeli didn’t have a good impression of them. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Although he came from a good family and had good looks, he was practically perfect.

But because of what he did when he was young, many people were afraid of him.

The women wanted to get close to him but were afraid of him.

After all, they heard that his illness hadn’t been treated yet. Even if he controlled it well, it didn’t mean that it wouldn’t flare-up in the future.
