Chapter 2412: What a Loving Couple

God was merciful to them and allowed them to meet him.

He changed their fates.

Qiao Mianmian felt a surge of warmth in her heart and couldn’t help but throw herself into his arms and hug him tightly.

“Mo Yesi, thank you.” She pressed her face against his chest and listened to his strong heartbeat. She felt especially peaceful. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Mo Yesi hugged her too.

At this moment, he also seemed to feel her emotions. He wanted to pat her head, but he was still wearing gloves.

“Baby.” Mo Yesi said gently, “Let me change my clothes first, okay? Then, you can hug me as much as you want.”

He hadn’t taken off his scrubs.

Although she didn’t mind, he felt dirty.

Qiao Mianmian then saw that he was still in his scrubs.

The people walking out of the operating room saw them hugging each other, and their faces were filled with envy.

What a loving couple.

The nurses looked at Mo Yesi’s handsome face and felt their hearts race. They were envious of Qiao Mianmian.

They heard that Doctor Mo was the Chairman of the Mo Corporation, Mo Yesi.

Who would have thought that this man, who was known as a legend in the business world, was actually a big shot in the medical world?

Most importantly, he was so good-looking.

With this face, he could easily beat the famous celebrities in the entertainment industry. He could have relied on his looks to make a living, but he was so capable.

This man was the best of the best.

He was perfect!

They felt like their hearts were about to explode.

How lucky was Qiao Mianmian to be in his arms and have him look at her so tenderly and lovingly?

He was her man.

They wondered how it would feel to date such a man.

She must be so happy.

If they could spend even a night with him, they would faint from happiness and have no regrets in life.

“That must be Doctor Mo’s girlfriend. She’s so lucky to be in a relationship with him.”

“She’s his fiancée. I’ve seen the entertainment news before. Her girlfriend is an artiste called Qiao Mianmian. She’s very popular now. Doctor Mo told the reporters personally that he and his girlfriend have already decided on marriage. The wedding will be held next year.”

“Wow, the marriage has been decided? Then, won’t she be marrying into a rich family as a Young Madam? Would a prestigious family like the Mos really allow him to marry a celebrity?”

“Ahem, I forgot to say that Qiao Mianmian isn’t just an artiste. She has another identity, the daughter of the Bai family. She’s compatible with the Mo family.”

“The daughter of the Bai family? No wonder. They’re a good match.”

“Everyone says that Qiao Mianmian is lucky, but I think Doctor Mo is lucky too. His fiancée is super beautiful. He’s lucky to have such a beautiful wife.”

“Yes, Qiao Mianmian is really beautiful. I think she’s even prettier in person than in the photos and videos. She’s a true beauty.”

Madam Mo listened to the discussions of the nurses and saw Qiao Mianmian clinging to her son.

She looked unhappy.
