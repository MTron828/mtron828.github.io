Chapter 1110: She Had Never Been This Embarrassed

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Madam Mo’s face was pale and her lips moved. She wanted to say something more.

But the old lady did not give her a chance to speak. She once again warned angrily, “If you ruin my grandson’s good marriage, don’t blame me for not giving you any face. Do you really think that after being Madam Mo for decades, your position in this family is stable and no one can do anything to you?

“I’m not dead yet. I’m still the one in charge of this family. I won’t hold it against you for what happened in the past. I’ll give you a chance and give you face. However, if you continue to act like this in the future, don’t say that I won’t give you face as the matriarch of the Mo family.”

Madam Mo was usually afraid of the Old Madam.

Now, after being yelled at by the Old Madam, she was so scared that she didn’t even dare to speak.

She felt angry, scared, wronged, and embarrassed.

The old lady reprimanded her harshly in front of the servants, making her feel utterly embarrassed.

She had never been so embarrassed.

However, this embarrassment was given to her by the Old Madam. She couldn’t flare up or resist and could only bear it silently.

“Remember what I said.” The Old Madam looked at her angrily. “Behave and live your good life. Your children and grandchildren will have their own happiness. Don’t interfere in matters that you shouldn’t be involved in. I hope you’ve heard what I said just now. You’d better listen to it too. Otherwise...

“If you insist on having no peace at home, you will definitely regret it in the future!

“Think about it yourself!”

With that, the Old Madam retracted her walking stick and called a maid to help her back to the bedroom upstairs.

After the old lady disappeared.

Madam Mo was still standing on the spot with an ashen face.

The surrounding servants looked at her gloomy face and did not even dare to breathe.

They did not want to provoke her now.

After all, it wasn’t a glorious thing for a daughter-in-law to be reprimanded by her mother-in-law.

And this disgraceful matter had been seen by them.

One could imagine how furious Madam Mo was at that moment.

The servants lowered their heads, wishing they could bury their heads in the ground.

This way, Madam Mo would not be able to see them.

They wouldn’t have to worry about being angry. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Madam Mo stood there unmoving like a statue.

The old lady had asked her to think about it. She had indeed thought about it.

She had thought it through.

Qiao Mianmian couldn’t stay in the Mo family anymore.

The old lady was completely charmed by her now.

She was completely on her side.

This was a very bad sign.

If she didn’t think of a way to chase her away from the Mo Family, she was afraid that in the future, she would make use of the Old Madam’s liking to cause all sorts of trouble, causing a good family to be in a foul mood and causing the Mo Family to no longer have peaceful days.

Most importantly, she had her eyes on Mo Corporation’s shares.

If she tricked Ah Si into giving her the shares, the consequences would be dire.

So, even if it was to ensure the Mo Corporation’s rights and safety, she couldn’t leave her in the Mo Family.

Regardless of whether the Old Madam and her son understood her or not, she had to get rid of Qiao Mianmian.

Otherwise, keeping her in the Mo Family would be akin to leaving a scourge.

Now, they were still newly-wed, yet the Old Madam and Ah Si were already on her side.
