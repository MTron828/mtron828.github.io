Chapter 516: What Could Be More Important Than Her Daughter?

Lin Huizhen heard the commotion and turned around. As she saw her daughter regain consciousness, she smiled in relief and said, “Anxin, you’re finally awake.”

Qiao Ruhai calmed down and looked towards the bed.

“Mom.” Qiao Anxin held onto Lin Huizhen’s hand immediately and asked frantically, “Who miscarried? Who’s the one you and dad were discussing?”

Lin Huizhen’s face froze in shock. “Anxin...”

She then recalled what happened before she fainted.

Blood. A lot of blood came out from her lower body.

Then, she fainted.

Qiao Anxin’s face turned pale. She looked at Lin Huizhen in disbelief and asked, “It was my kid... Mom, did I lose my kid?

“I was who miscarried, right?”

Lin Huizhen saw the state that her daughter was in and couldn’t bear to tell her the truth.

But she knew that Qiao Anxin had to know the truth.

She then nodded in response against her will.

Qiao Anxin’s eyes widened in shock. She then felt as though everything was spinning around her and almost fainted again.

“I was pregnant?” Qiao Anxin’s voice shook. “I was really pregnant?”

Wasn’t she faking her pregnancy?

How could she get a miscarriage?

Lin Huizhen was puzzled and asked, “Anxin, what’s wrong? Are you ok? Weren’t you already aware of your own pregnancy?”

Lin Huizhen didn’t put much thought into it. She just thought that Qiao Anxin was too traumatized and was delirious.

As she thought about it, she felt more heartbroken.

“Anxin, don’t harp up over it. Since the kid is gone, it just wasn’t meant to be. Both you and Ah Ze are still young, you still have a lot of chances to have another child.

“You can always get another one once you have recovered.”

“Ah Ze...” Qiao Anxin was reminded of Su Ze and looked around. She then frowned and asked, “Mom, Brother Ah Ze isn’t here. Where is he?”

“Erm...” Lin Huizhen’s expression turned weird. She kept quiet for a while before replying, “He isn’t here right now. He said that there was something urgent at the company that he needed to attend to. He will come over after he’s done.”

Lin Huizhen wasn’t satisfied with Su Ze’s behavior.

What could be more important than her daughter?

Her daughter suffered a miscarriage, yet he wasn’t present to look after her.

Also, he had to take responsibility for her miscarriage.

Lin Huizhen poked around and already knew most of what happened.

Even though she was really angered by what happened, she couldn’t do anything about it.

The Qiao family’s situation was getting worse.

The situation wouldn’t improve just from Qiao Anxin’s income from being an idol.

But the situation would definitely improve if she became the Young Madam of the Su family. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

The Su family was one of the most powerful families in Yuncheng City.

The Qiao family wouldn’t worsen if it could connect with the Su Family.

Hence, even though Lin Huizhen was angered by the mistreatment Qiao Anxin received, she couldn’t ask her to break up with Su Ze.

She suppressed her unhappiness and continued, “Don’t be upset. Ah Ze has just taken over the Su Mandate and must be busy. Normally, he couldn’t find the time to visit you.”
