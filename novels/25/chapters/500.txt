Chapter 501: I Can Do What Others Can as Well

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

He unlocked the phone and logged into the game she was playing just now. He then chose the hero named “Li Bai” under the assassin category.

Qiao Mianmian was confused. “What are you doing? Do you know how to use Li Bai?”

She knew that Mo Yesi never played this game before.

She even had to help him install the game on his phone previously.

Mo Yesi replied, “No.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

He checked Li Bai’s attributes and skillset. After that, he immediately clicked on the ranked match.

Qiao Mianmian’s eyes widened in shock when she saw the matching page. She exclaimed, “Are you sure you want to play now? You should play against the bots if you are not familiar with the game. Ranked matches are only meant for those familiar with the character. People will scold you if you hinder their game.”

Also, no one cared about your matters in the game.

You deserved a scolding if you hindered their game.

No one would know the real identity of the person playing ranked matches with them.

He held up his phone calmly and looked at her. He then rubbed her head and said, “Baby, I can do what others can as well. If I can solo kill the opposing team, call me older brother too, alright?”

As he imagined Qiao Mianmian addressing him as Older Brother, his body tightened and his breathing hastened.

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

No wonder he suddenly wanted to play the game.

He didn’t like it when she addressed other guys as Older Brother.

He was even jealous of a guy that had only played a match with her.

Qiao Mianmian found it really funny and asked, “It’s not that I don’t have faith in you. But Li Bai is a hero that is hard to master. It’s unrealistic for you to solo kill the opposing team successfully the first time you play. Do you want to change to an easier hero instead?”

Mo Yesi locked down on Li Bai after the rest of the teammates had chosen their heroes.

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

Once he had confirmed his selection, he could not change afterward.

Unless his teammates were willing to trade heroes with him.

She had a feeling that Mo Yesi was going to hinder his teammates for this round.

Someone who had never played Li Bai would definitely hinder his teammates in rank mode. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

She felt sorry for his teammates.

She was ready to be reported by them as well.

“Baby.” Mo Yesi lifted her chin after he locked down the hero. He looked into her eyes with a serious look and said, “If I win this round and solo the opposing team successfully, will you call me Older Brother Yesi?”

Qiao Mianmian didn’t want to diminish his confidence.

She wanted to tell him that even though he was very capable of managing the company, it didn’t mean that he would be good at gaming as well.

These were two very separate matters.

Maybe he could excel in management. But in terms of gaming, he would be nowhere as good as her.

But since he was adamant in playing, she wasn’t going to stop him.

She hoped that his teammates were capable so that they could carry him to victory as well.

But it would definitely be unrealistic to talk about solo killing the opposing team successfully.

Hence, she agreed without much hesitation. “Alright, I promise.”

He could never do it, anyway.

Mo Yesi’s eyes lit up, and he replied smilingly, “That’s a promise, then.”

A minute later, he was already in the game.

Just as Qiao Mianmian anticipated, Mo Yesi already died three times after the round started for six minutes.

His statistics were zero kills, three deaths, and zero assists.
