Hence, no matter how unwilling she was, no matter how much she hated Qiao Mianmian, she still came over to apologize.

Who knew that Qiao Mianmian wouldn’t buy it.

“Sister, are you still unwilling to forgive me?” Qiao Anxin couldn’t give up so easily. She blinked, and tears rolled down her cheeks. “I know you won’t forgive me easily, but I’m here to sincerely apologize to you. If you don’t forgive me, I’ll keep apologizing to you until you’re willing to forgive me.”

Qiao Mianmian sneered. “Up to you. But I don’t have time to act with you now.”

“Sister, you’ve misunderstood me.” Qiao Anxin seemed to be hurt by her words. “I’m not acting. I really want to apologize to you. What do I have to do to make you believe me?”

“Believe you?” Qiao Mianmian didn’t want to talk nonsense with her, so she said impatiently, “If you kneel and kowtow to me, I’ll believe that you’re sincere. If you can’t do it, then disappear from my sight. Don’t bother me anymore.”

Qiao Anxin’s expression stiffened when she heard the words “kowtow and apologize”.

Qiao Mianmian was such a slut.

She must have done it on purpose.

She wanted her to embarrass her in public.

Normally, Qiao Anxin would have scolded her.

But she was begging now. Even if she hated Qiao Mianmian to death, she could only swallow it.

She even felt that as long as Qiao Mianmian didn’t bicker with her about the past, as long as she didn’t continue being banned, as long as she could remain in the entertainment industry, she could let herself suffer such humiliation once.

It was never too late to take revenge.

There would be a chance to teach Qiao Mianmian a lesson in the future.

“Sister, as long as I kowtow to you and admit my mistake, will you forgive me?” Qiao Anxin’s face was pale. She bit her lip as tears rolled down her cheeks. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Under Qiao Mianmian’s shocked gaze, she actually knelt down.

She knelt at Qiao Mianmian’s feet and looked up. “Sister, I’ll kowtow to you and apologize. Can you forgive me?”

Qiao Mianmian opened her mouth, but before she could say anything, she heard Qiao Ruhai scold her. “Enough, what’s the point of having a family like this?”

He walked over and pulled Qiao Anxin up from the ground.

“Dad, let me do it.” Qiao Anxin pushed Qiao Ruhai and cried. “Sister just said that as long as I kneel down and kowtow to her, she’ll forgive me. As long as she’s willing to forgive me, I’m willing to do anything.

Qiao Ruhai grabbed her tightly and blushed. “What are you kneeling for? Do you want others to laugh at us?”

“But Sister...”

“Mianmian.” Qiao Ruhai turned around and looked at Qiao Mianmian with a hint of disappointment and heartache. “We’re family. Even if Anxin and you aren’t biological sisters, you two grew up together. She really knows her mistake now. Can’t you give her a chance to change?

“You used to be the kindest and softest. Why are you like this now?”

Qiao Ruhai shook his head and sighed.

Qiao Mianmian felt as if something had stabbed her heart. She clenched her fists and looked up at him.

If she hadn’t heard it with her own ears, she wouldn’t believe that these biased words came from Qiao Ruhai.
