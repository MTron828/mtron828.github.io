Chapter 2888: I Won’t Let Him Have His Wish!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Su Ze was the one who found the house, and the rent was naturally paid by him.

Qiao Anxin and Lin Huizhen had been relying on Su Ze for their living expenses while they were overseas.

It was the same when they returned.

She had been an artiste ever since she graduated.

Hence, once she left the entertainment industry, she wouldn’t be able to earn money anymore. She didn’t have any survival skills.

Of course, if she was willing to suffer, she could find a more ordinary job without any professional skills.

But how could she lower herself to do that?

Moreover, the money earned from a normal job wasn’t enough for her to buy a shirt, a pair of shoes, and a bag.

People who were used to living a good life were unwilling to live a normal life.

Qiao Anxin was the same.

Under Su Ze’s arrangement, she’d been in the entertainment industry overseas for a while.

She took on some lousy films and even some lousy commercials. She made some money, but she used it for plastic surgery.

When she returned, she was basically penniless.

She had expected to earn a sum of money in the entertainment industry when she returned to Yuncheng City.

But before she had the chance, she was already kicked out of the entertainment industry.

Su Ze didn’t care about her anymore. She didn’t have any money on her, and she was even chased out of the house.

It could be said that the worse it was, the worse it would be.

Qiao Anxin felt like she was going crazy.

“Miss Jiang, please leave immediately.” The security guard looked at the pale mother and daughter expressionlessly. When he spoke again, his tone was already very bad. “If we use force, the scene might not be so good.”

Qiao Anxin knew what he meant.

If they didn’t leave, the security officers would carry her and her mother out of the district. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

At that time, everyone in the neighborhood would see the scene.

Qiao Anxin couldn’t afford to lose face like this. She knew that she had to leave, whether she wanted to or not.

She looked up, bit her lip, and slowly got up from the ground.

“Mom, let’s go!”

“But, where are we staying tonight?” Lin Huizhen held her, her eyes red. “We can’t possibly sleep on the streets. Su Ze is such a heartless person, how could he do this?

“Is he trying to force us into a corner!”

Lin Huizhen thought that Su Ze was the one who chased them away.

She kept cursing him.

Even Qiao Anxin thought so.

Her eyes were filled with hatred as she gritted her teeth. “He wants to cut ties with me completely, afraid that I’ll affect his future. Since he’s so heartless, I’m not easy to bully!

“I won’t let him have his wish!”

…

Qiao Anxin and Lin Huizhen dragged their bags into the taxi. Qiao Anxin used her cell phone to search for a relatively cheap hotel nearby and told the driver to drive them there.

She didn’t have much money on her, but she still had the money to stay in a hotel for a few days.

Twenty minutes later, the taxi stopped outside the hotel.

Qiao Anxin followed Lin Huizhen out of the car.

After entering the lobby, Qiao Anxin went to the front desk to settle the check-in procedures.

The two girls at the front desk looked very young, about 20 years old.. When Qiao Anxin handed her ID card over, one of them looked at it and then looked up at her strangely.
