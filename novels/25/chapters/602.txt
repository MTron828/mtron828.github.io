Chapter 603: You Can’t Be So Fierce to Me Next Time

Although he never found this person a threat, the thought of Qiao Mianmian’s previous relationship with Su Ze irked him.

As much as he despised Su Ze, this man was Qiao Mianmian’s previous fiancé, after all.

Hence, it was hard for him not to get jealous after seeing the news online.

And that jealousy somewhat led to a little fear as well.

He was worried that she’d be so soft-hearted as to agree to reconcile with Su Ze.

He knew that the possibility was slim.

But he couldn’t help but worry.

His confidence was almost non-existent before her.

“Baby, I’m not suspecting you. I just... don’t like seeing you with him.” Mo Yesi felt a lot better after hearing Qiao Mianmian’s explanation.

The pressurizing aura around him was gone too.

The warmth was restored in his eyes.

His eyes were no longer icy cold. The expression in his eyes was now what she was familiar with.

Qiao Mianmian was much more relieved now. She felt that the Mo Yesi she knew was back.

He really scared her just now.

She bit her lip and looked at him a little sadly. “Mo Yesi, you were so fierce just now. You scared me.

“You can’t be so fierce to me next time.

“Otherwise, I’m gonna ignore you.”

“I’m sorry, Baby.”

He couldn’t control his mood when the jealousy surged inside him.

Now that he had returned to normal, he realized that he’d gone overboard and scared her.

“Forgive me, alright?” Mo Yesi hugged her tightly and sighed. “I don’t want to mind it, but I really can’t. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Seeing him with you makes me uncomfortable.

“Baby, he’s the only man you’ve been with besides me. I told myself that this is your past and I shouldn’t mind it so much, but I really...”

“Alright, I get it.” Qiao Mianmian covered his mouth. “I’m not angry. I just don’t like the you from just now. You make me feel like... you’re so foreign.

“It scares me.

“So, no matter what happens in the future, don’t give me that look, alright?”

“Sure.”

Mo Yesi cupped her face in his hands and kissed her on the forehead. “I promise you, I won’t do that again.”

Now that this had been clarified, the short-lived unhappiness was over.

Mo Yesi looked through the last two documents with Qiao Mianmian on his lap and then shut his laptop.

He called Wei Zheng into the office.

Wei Zheng opened the door and saw the woman sitting on Chairman Mo’s lap behind the desk. He paused for a moment before walking towards them.

Chairman Mo was no longer like before.

He changed.

He was now hopelessly in love with her.

Even at work, he couldn’t take himself away from her.

Love was a scary thing.

It could change someone so drastically.

If he hadn’t seen it for himself, he never would have believed that this cold and aloof boss who once viewed women as poison would become like this someday...
