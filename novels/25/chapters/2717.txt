Chapter 2720: I’m Sorry, I Did Think This Way Before

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“I think it’s good to work with such a senior.”

Linda was stunned again. Then, she looked at Qiao Mianmian in admiration. “It’s good that you think this way. Mianmian, you really like acting, huh.”

“Mm? Does Sister Xie only believe that I really like acting now? Don’t tell me you’ve always thought that I was playing around?”

Linda kept quiet for a few seconds and looked a little embarrassed. “I’m sorry, I did think this way before.” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

After all, she was the daughter of a rich family and the Madam of the Mo Corporation. Linda didn’t think she really liked to be an actress.

In the eyes of prestigious families like the Bai and Mo families, actors were equivalent to performers.

Although Mo Yesi supported Qiao Mianmian’s acting career, the others in the Mo family were different.

Especially the elders.

Hence, when Qiao Mianmian said that she was planning a pregnancy, Linda actually thought that this might be an excuse for her to leave the entertainment industry.

She said that she would continue acting after giving birth.

But if she didn’t want to come back, who would dare to say anything?

But Qiao Mianmian’s words let Linda know that she was wrong.

If she didn’t love this industry, she wouldn’t have said those words.

Who would like to be scolded?

Qiao Mianmian pretended to be sad and put a hand to her chest. “So, Sister Xie never believed that I really liked this line of work. I’m so sad that you don’t trust me.”

“Mianmian, are you angry? I…” Linda thought that she was really shocked and quickly tried to explain.

“Hahaha, I’m kidding.” Qiao Mianmian laughed when she saw that Linda was serious. “How could I be angry with you over such a little thing? But Sister Xie, can you believe me from now on? I really like acting. I’ve never thought of giving up on this industry.”

“Mm, I believe you.” Linda relaxed when she saw her smile. She looked at the girl’s beautiful face and said sincerely, “Mianmian, you’re really talented in acting. I really think it’s a pity if you give up this industry.”

…

There were still two hours of rest after lunch.

Qiao Mianmian didn’t sleep at all. She quickly read the script of the two scenes that would be filmed in the afternoon several times, especially her and Xu Jin’s scenes.

When it was time to start filming, the first scene was between her and Xu Jin.

They got into position, and Xu Jin immediately got into character.

He looked coldly at the girl in red kneeling in the snow. Anger burned in his eyes, but he suppressed it.

But he couldn’t control the veins on his forehead.

“Tell me, why did you stab her! Do you know your mistake now?”

“Master, I’m not wrong.” The red-dressed girl knelt in the snow with her back straight. Her eyes were already red, but she still said stubbornly, “That woman approached you with a goal. You’ll be harmed by her if you don’t stay away from her.

“Disciple just doesn’t want Master to be harmed by her. Killing her will prevent future trouble. Disciple…”

Bam!

The girl was slapped hard.
