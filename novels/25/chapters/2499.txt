Yan Shaoqing said earnestly, “Zeli, can you tell what is love and what is gratitude? You used to treat Shen Rou well, so well that all of us felt that you liked her, but you said that you didn’t like her as a man.

“Then, were you good to her only because she saved you? If that’s the case, you’re just grateful to her. Just like how you feel for Sis-in-law now. I think you…”

“You don’t have to continue. I know my own business.” Gong Zeli interrupted Yan Shaoqing’s “lecture” with a cold expression. “I told you this not to hear you say this.”

In the past, he couldn’t tell.

But now, he was clear.

He was very sure of his feelings for Qiao Mianmian.

This time, he wouldn’t confuse her anymore.

Yan Shaoqing was speechless.

“Alright, if you don’t want to hear it, then I won’t say it.” He shrugged. “Anyway, no matter what feelings you have for her now, it’s impossible between the two of you. You and Ah Si are already in such a mess, I don’t want to see your relationship worsen. Even if you can’t be friends, don’t become enemies.”

These were Yan Shaoqing’s heartfelt words.

If they couldn’t be friends, they couldn’t become enemies.

It would be too sad if brothers became enemies.

This wasn’t what he wanted to see.

They had grown up together and were one of the few brothers around each other. Yan Shaoqing was already upset by the situation.

“Fourth Bro, I’ve never begged you for anything.” Yan Shaoqing put on a serious expression. After a few seconds, he said in a rare serious tone, “Even if I beg you, no matter what, you and Ah Si can’t become enemies.

“Don’t hurt each other.”

Gong Zeli pursed his lips and kept quiet.

He looked up and locked eyes with Yan Shaoqing for a while before saying slowly, “As long as he doesn’t want to become my enemy, I won’t do anything to him. But if he wants to attack the Gong Corporation, I won’t care about our past relationship.

“You have to know that it wasn’t me that caused this mess. It was him.”

Yan Shaoqing was relieved.

“Then, I’m relieved.” He nodded. “I’ve said what I needed to say. Let’s go back now.”

“You go back first.” Gong Zeli narrowed his eyes.

“You’re not coming back to the private room with me? The substitute you got is so timid. She cried after I said a few words to her. If she sees me going back alone, she’ll probably cry again.”

Yan Shaoqing nodded.

He really didn’t like women who cried all the time.

It affected his mood.

“She’s the one who cried, not you. What are you worried about?” Gong Zeli said coldly.

Yan Shaoqing could hear the coldness in his voice and couldn’t help but ask curiously, “You don’t have any feelings for her?”

“What feelings do you think I have for her?”

Yan Shaoqing touched the tip of his nose. “I thought you’d at least feel some pity for her. Since you don’t have any feelings for her, why do you have to go through all this trouble? Even if they look alike, she’s still different.”
