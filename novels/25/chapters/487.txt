Chapter 488: She Still Cared About Him

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

He looked at Mo Yesi unconfidently as he wondered if he spoke something wrong.

Young Master seemed... unhappy.

“Young Master, would you like me to prepare breakfast?” Lei En asked carefully.

Mo Yesi bit on his lip and fell silent for a while. Then, he turned, went back up, and said, “No need for that.”

He felt terrible.

She left just like that.

Silent.

She didn’t even inform him before she left.

She wasn’t like this previously.

Even if she had something on and couldn’t wait for him, she should have informed him.

But she didn’t do so today.

She left after only informing Lei En.

She didn’t even drop him a text.

She must despise him.

Even though she didn’t say it outright, her actions spoke louder than words.

He frowned as he entered the changing room and stood in front of the closet for a long while.

As he was reaching out for a black shirt out of habit, he suddenly recalled that Qiao Mianmian commented that he only wore black and stopped himself. He then picked a grey shirt instead.

...

In the car.

Uncle Li noticed that Young Master seemed kind of down today.

Even though he seemed as though everything was normal. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

But because he knew him for so long already, he could feel that Mo Yesi’s mood wasn’t good.

Even though Uncle Li was curious, he didn’t want to be a busybody.

He drove the car out of the house steadily and was on the usual route to the company. But suddenly, Mo Yesi said from the backseat, “I don’t want to go to the company right now.”

Uncle Li was puzzled. “Where are we going then, Young Master?”

At the backseat.

Mo Yesi was silent as he looked down at his phone. After he maintained the same posture for a whole minute, he finally sent a message to Qiao Mianmian: [Where are you signing the contract? Are you there already?]

He waited for a few minutes before Qiao Mianmian replied: [I’ve just arrived at Tang Yi studio. Are you busy with work? Remember to have your breakfast, alright.]

Mo Yesi was shocked by the reply. His frown also immediately disappeared.

She still cared about him.

Did it mean that she didn’t actually despise him all that much?

Mo Yesi immediately decided that he was going to do it a few more times with Qiao Mianmian tonight.

He was going to recover his pride.

He wanted Qiao Mianmian to know that he was a capable man.

What happened this morning... was just an exception.

He was too excited and... things ended really quickly.

He ended things really quickly the first time they did that night as well. But his performance improved the next few times they did it that night.

Hence, he definitely wasn’t an incapable man.

As this thought, he wanted to reserve her time tonight to prevent her from making any plans with others.

Mo Yesi: [Do you want to have dinner tonight? What do you want to eat?]

Qiao Mianmian immediately replied: [Alright.]

Mo Yesi was relieved when he saw the reply.

He wanted to explain to her that what happened this morning was just an anomaly. He wasn’t a guy that would prematurely ejaculate.

But he thought about it and gave up.

Trying to explain anything now would make the matter worse.

She wouldn’t believe it as well.

He would just have to prove it to her with his actions today.

Mo Yesi: [Tonight is confirmed, then. Don’t arrange anything with others.]

Qiao Mianmian: “Alright. I’m entering the lift already, I can’t reply anymore. Let’s chat later.]
