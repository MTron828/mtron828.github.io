Chapter 1081: Do You Not Like Me Anymore?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

But in reality, she was a coward.

She was the kind of person who only dared to flirt with handsome men verbally. Once they really met, she would be so shy that she wouldn’t be able to say a word.

But if she was drunk...

Then, there was nothing Jiang Luoli didn’t dare to do.

When she was sober, she didn’t dare to do what she wanted. After she got drunk, she became unrestrained.

Therefore, from what she said to Mo Shixiu just now, one could imagine that she must have fantasized about him all the time.

Qiao Mianmian wasn’t worried at all about what Mo Shixiu would do to Jiang Luoli.

She was more worried that Jiang Luoli would do something to Mo Shixiu.

She had a feeling that something was going to happen tonight.

And what happened tonight would change the current relationship between Mo Shixiu and Jiang Luoli.

...

The driver in the front row saw from the rear-view mirror that Mister was being teased by the young lady, and his eyes almost fell out of their sockets.

He wondered for a few seconds if he was seeing things.

How could a dignified and serious person like Mister be teased by a young lady?

And he seemed to see Mister blush.

This was even rarer than the sun rising from the west.

If he hadn’t seen it with his own eyes, he wouldn’t believe that Mister would be bullied by a young lady to this extent.

No matter how he looked at it, it looked like he was being seduced by a demoness.

It was a little unbearable to look at.

“Jiang Luoli.”

Mo Shixiu was forced by Jiang Luoli to the point where he could no longer retreat. He frowned when he saw the girl pouting and moving closer to him. He straightened his body and pushed her head away and said seriously, “Behave yourself and stop fooling around. Don’t force me...”

Mo Shixiu had always abided by all kinds of rules and etiquette since he was young. He did things by the book and liked to follow the rules.

He had never done anything ridiculous since he was young.

The only thing he found absurd was that night.

That incident had disrupted his original life.

She had become the only “accident” in his twenty-odd years.

However, ever since then, it seemed like his life would never return to its original path.

Despite his best efforts.

But it seemed useless.

At this moment, the girl who had become the only “accident” in his life and messed up his original life was right beside him.

She was drunk.

She kept making a fuss like a hooligan.

Apart from dodging, Mo Shixiu could do nothing to her.

Because he knew in his heart that this “accident” was caused by him.

Therefore, he had to take full responsibility.

“Mo Shixiu, you’re too much.” Jiang Luoli wasn’t afraid of his threat at all. After he pushed her away, she immediately clung to him again and hugged his arm. “You said that you would let me kiss you, but now you won’t.

“You went back on your words. You’re a dog if you lie!”

Mo Shixiu: “...”

For the 101st time, he regretted letting Jiang Luoli touch that bottle of red wine.

Why did he want to drink with her, then?

Why didn’t he stop her when she wanted to drink a second glass after finishing the first one?

He actually thought that she could drink a bottle with her alcohol tolerance.

“Wu, Mo Shixiu, do you not like me anymore?” Jiang Luoli looked at the man’s indifferent expression and felt wronged. Her eyes were red. “Do you regret it? You don’t want to be my boyfriend anymore.”

Mo Shixiu: “... I don’t.”
