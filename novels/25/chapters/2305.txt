Chapter 2307: Are They All Crazy?

Madam Mo looked stubborn. “Mom, this isn’t fair. If you punish me, you have to punish her too. Otherwise, you’re being biased.”

Furious, Old Madam threw her walking stick at her.

Mo Yunchen quickly pulled Madam Mo aside, and the walking stick slammed on the spot where she was standing.

“Mom, don’t be angry. Don’t hurt yourself.” Mo Yunchen saw that the Old Madam was so angry that her chest was heaving up and down. He grabbed Madam Mo and stood aside. He lowered his head and said to her, “Wenpei, don’t make trouble anymore. Don’t anger Mom.”

“Mo Yunchen, what do you mean!” Madam Mo was usually spoiled by him and had never suffered any grievances. Now that he criticized her, she felt extremely aggrieved.

She pushed him away and glared at him. “What do you mean? Your son’s future is ruined because of that woman. Aren’t you going to say something?”

Mo Yunchen took two steps back and frowned. “I believe Shixiu will give me an explanation. Wenpei, no matter what, you did wrong. No matter what happened, you shouldn’t have attacked Xiao Luo.”

“Even you’re on their side?” Madam Mo looked at him in disbelief. “Even you think I did something wrong. Mo Yunchen, are you still my husband? How could you do this to me!

“Mo Yunchen, you bastard!”

Madam Mo was about to explode.

She realized that no one in the family was on her side.

Everyone was blaming her for her mistake.

Now, even her husband, who doted on her the most, said she was wrong.

At that moment, Madam Mo felt that she was a pitiful and helpless person.

The whole family was against her.

Were they crazy?

They were all on Jiang Luoli’s side.

Madam Mo originally thought that she could force Jiang Luoli and Mo Shixiu to divorce because of Mo Shixiu’s withdrawal.

She thought that Old Madam would definitely support her.

Because Old Madam valued this election.

With Old Madam’s help, things would be more than halfway successful.

She had it all planned out.

But now, why did everything change?

Nothing went according to her plan…

Not only did no one support her, but she also became the target of public criticism.

How did it become like this!

Why!!

Mo Yunchen looked at her unreasonable behavior and frowned even more.

He thought that perhaps he really spoiled his wife.

He remembered that she wasn’t like this before.

She had always been a gentle and considerate person.

Now, this Jieyu flower seemed to have changed into a different person. Besides her face, she looked completely different. She really didn’t look like his kind and gentle wife at all.

His expression turned cold. “Wenpei, look at you now. What a disgrace! Mom is right. You really need to reflect on yourself.”

“Mo Yunchen, what did you say?!”

Mo Yunchen went forward and grabbed her hand. “I’ll take you to your room.”

“No, no, I don’t want…” Madam Mo struggled. “Mo Yunchen, what are you doing! Let go of me!”
