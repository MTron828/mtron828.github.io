Chapter 1014: Everytime I See Him, I’m Tempted

Qiao Mianmian was trying to help Jiang Luoli analyze the situation logically.

She felt that Jiang Luoli and Mo Shixiu weren’t suitable.

Mo Shixiu’s future status meant that he couldn’t give Jiang Luoli the life she wanted.

She knew Jiang Luoli too well.

Hence, she suggested that they weren’t suitable for each other.

But just now, she suddenly wondered if Jiang Luoli would regret it if she rejected Mo Shixiu.

Perhaps, they might not be as unhappy as she made them out to be.

Perhaps, they could live happily too.

How could they be clear about their relationship?

Back when she married Mo Yesi, she didn’t expect things to turn out this way.

She also felt that she wasn’t suitable for him.

If it wasn’t for Qiao Chen’s illness, she wouldn’t have married him.

It wasn’t his fault.

But he was too nice. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

She wanted to stay away from him.

A man with such good qualities wasn’t a temptation to her, but a danger.

She had no idea if Jiang Luoli loved Mo Shixiu.

But she definitely liked him.

If she didn’t like Mo Shixiu at all, she wouldn’t have specially asked Qiao Mianmian out for her opinion.

She must be tempted.

And for some reason, she was hesitant.

“Baby, you...” Jiang Luoli looked at her in confusion. “Didn’t you think that we weren’t compatible? Why are you...”

“Luo Luo, I think you know best whether it’s appropriate or not. I just feel that you have to listen to your true feelings before deciding what to do.

“After all, feelings are your own business.

“I’ve said it before. No matter what decision you make, I’ll support you.”

Jiang Luoli looked at her for a while and quickly understood what she meant. She smiled and nodded. “Mm, I got it. I’ll think about it again. I’ll let you know when I’ve made up my mind.”

“Alright.”

...

They waited for Mo Yesi at the dessert shop.

Jiang Luoli used to be Mo Yesi’s fan.

Now that she knew his true identity, she looked at him with even more admiration. She was just like a little fangirl.

“Hi, Prince Charming, long time no see.”

The fangirl waved at him enthusiastically the moment she saw him.

Mo Yesi was dressed in a black top and black pants. The moment he entered the cafe, the female employees in the shop kept looking at him, wondering if he was a model or an actor.

Qiao Mianmian looked at him too.

The man had a good foundation.

He looked exactly like a clothes rack.

Coupled with his handsome face, it was hard not to attract attention.

Every time he appeared, no matter where he was, he would attract everyone’s attention.

Even Qiao Mianmian’s heart would flutter every time she saw him.

Not to mention others.

It was just a simple black shirt, but it looked different on him.

That cold and elegant aura was especially attractive.

Every time Qiao Mianmian saw him, she would feel a sense of pride and wonder why her husband was so handsome.
