Chapter 814: Nothing But Beauty

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

The minister actually took a liking to this woman who only had a beautiful face!!

When did his Minister become so superficial?

“Miss Jiang, I’m not here to get the check back from you.” Assistant Xu took a lot of effort to suppress his anger and the urge to scold her.

He had always been a gentleman.

This was the first woman he couldn’t control his emotions with and even wanted to scold.

She was too weird.

But she was so lucky to have met with such a good thing last night.

If she hadn’t planned this beforehand, she was really lucky.

Many women admired their minister, but they could only watch from afar, not daring to take a step closer.

This was because the minister was like a god above everyone else.

A man like him was obviously not attracted to women.

But who would have thought?

The minister had been a virgin for almost 30 years. He would have lost it last night.

And he lost it to such a woman!

He felt bad for the minister.

“You’re not here for the check?” Jiang Luoli’s expression softened a little when she heard that, but she still didn’t look pleasant. She said coldly, “Then, what are you here for? Didn’t you say that you wouldn’t contact me again after you gave me the money?”

Assistant Xu gritted his teeth. “Master asked me to look for Miss Jiang and ask if you have any other requests. As long as it’s not too much, he can satisfy you.”

Assistant Xu added the last sentence.

Mo Shixiu had never said such a thing.

Assistant Xu was afraid that Jiang Luoli would ask for too much. Although the Minister was rich, he couldn’t be so willful towards this woman.

Jiang Luoli was shocked.

She was stunned for a few seconds before frowning. “Didn’t you already give me money?”

Assistant Xu said, “... Yes. But my master is kind-hearted and still feels that he has let Miss Jiang down, so he hopes that you can make other requests. He will try his best to satisfy you. Miss Jiang, you can think carefully if you have anything else you need.

“Of course, my master’s abilities are limited. So, I hope that Miss Jiang’s request is reasonable. It’s better for everyone.”

Jiang Luoli kept quiet.

Assistant Xu waited for a while, but before she could respond, he frowned again. “Miss Jiang, have you considered it?”

Jiang Luoli looked up. “No need, I don’t have anything I want. Also, is your master so ugly that he can’t see anyone? If he doesn’t dare to say anything to me, why does he have to have an assistant like you to relay it to him?”

“What did you say? My family head isn’t an ugly person. Master is handsome, elegant, and impressive. I don’t know how many women admire him.” Assistant Xu frowned when he heard that Mo Shixiu was an ugly person. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Even as a man, he was shocked by his Chief’s face.

This gold digger actually said that the Minister was ugly.

This was intolerable!

“Ha.” Jiang Luoli scoffed. “Come on, he doesn’t even dare to show his face. If he isn’t an ugly freak, then what is he? What happened last night... he doesn’t have anything to be ashamed of. After all, he didn’t force me.”
