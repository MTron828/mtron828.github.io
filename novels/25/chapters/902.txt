Chapter 903: Are You Sure You Can Do It Alone?

These sweet and sour spare ribs were too expensive.

She suddenly felt guilty.

Mo Yesi turned around and smiled at her pained expression. “What’s wrong?”

Qiao Mianmian replied, “... It’s nothing. I just suddenly feel that I’ll never forget this sweet and sour spare ribs.”

“Mm?”

“Sweet and sour spare ribs that cost hundreds of millions...”

“Don’t feel burdened.” Mo Yesi rubbed her head and led her into the room. “Actually, it’s not that exaggerated. I just bought this place for a meal. The location is pretty good, and the Feng Shui is good too. Buying this place is equivalent to investing.

“In any case, it isn’t a loss. The price of the condominiums here will definitely increase in the future. When we sell it, we can still earn a sum.”

“Is that so?”

“Of course.”

Qiao Mianmian felt less burdened by his words.

She patted her chest. “Alright. Then, I can eat two more pieces of pork ribs later.”

When they reached the living room, Mo Yesi let go of her hand. “You play in the living room, I’ll go to the kitchen to cook. I’ll call you when it’s done.”

“You don’t need my help?” Qiao Mianmian looked at him skeptically. “Are you sure you can handle it alone?”

“Mm, I can do it alone. I got someone to prepare some snacks. If you need anything, let me know, and I’ll get someone to buy it for you. Oh right, you can go to the changing room in the bedroom. I got someone to buy a few clothes for you.

“I’ve also got someone to prepare the cosmetics and daily necessities for you.

“I’ll get your assistant to pack your things and send them over. From today onwards, you’ll be staying here.

“It’s a little far from where you were filming, so I called Uncle Li over. Uncle Li will be in charge of fetching you in the future.”

Qiao Mianmian widened her eyes. “You called Uncle Li over?”

“Mm. I’m more at ease with him picking you up.” ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“But isn’t Uncle Li in charge of fetching you? What are you going to do?”

“Uncle Li isn’t the only chauffeur at home. Moreover, I can drive myself. In any case, you don’t have to worry about me. I won’t have anything to worry about if I arrange things for you.”

“Alright. Go and play. It’s 6 pm now, we can eat around 7 pm. If you’re hungry, eat some snacks first.”

With that, Mo Yesi carried the bags into the kitchen.

Qiao Mianmian was really worried about letting him do it alone. She thought for a while and ran to the kitchen door. She stuck her head in and said, “Mo Yesi, let me help you. It’ll be more efficient if we do it together.”

She was really worried that he might set the kitchen on fire.

Mo Yesi placed the bag on the kitchen counter, turned around, and gently pushed her head out.

He looked at her with his dark eyes and said word by word, “You don’t have to bother about anything, just wait for dinner. I promise you’ll be able to eat in an hour at most.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

Really?

Why did she feel that this was impossible?

This man was undeniably outstanding in his work.

But no matter how outstanding a person was, there were still things they weren’t good at.

She felt that he was definitely not good at cooking.

But the man clearly wanted to perform well and didn’t give Qiao Mianmian any chance to help him. With that, he closed the kitchen door.
