Chapter 1624: Her Boyfriend Is So Petty?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

But seeing that Qin Han looked even better in person, Mo Yesi couldn’t help but feel jealous.

The Tu Yilei from before was just a kid.

Although he was also a danger, Mo Yesi didn’t feel that threatened.

But this Qin Han...

Mo Yesi had to admit that he was handsome.

He wasn’t as childish as a high school student. He had the stability and restraint of a mature man and looked gentle.

He looked like a gentleman from an ancient family.

Women liked Qin Han.

Qiao Mianmian was his fan...

The more he thought about it, the more upset he felt.

Although he knew that Qiao Mianmian didn’t have any feelings for Qin Han, he couldn’t ignore this man.

When Mo Yesi was sizing him up, Qin Han was already sizing him up too.

He knew Mo Yesi too.

But this was his first time meeting him in real life.

Qin Han sized him up and felt that Qiao Mianmian had good taste. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Her boyfriend was indeed outstanding. Not to mention anything else, just his looks alone were better than many people in their circle.

That powerful aura wasn’t something an ordinary person could have.

It was the aura of an expert.

A man like him, even if others didn’t know his identity, couldn’t treat him as an ordinary person.

He didn’t look like an ordinary person.

But...

While Qin Han admired Mo Yesi, he also felt a trace of hostility from his eyes.

He frowned in confusion and looked at Mo Yesi for a few seconds before looking away.

Qin Han kept quiet for a few seconds before asking his assistant, “Did you see Qiao Mianmian’s boyfriend?”

The assistant was speechless.

Of course he saw it.

He was so big and had such a strong presence. Everyone in the crew must have seen him.

Although he didn’t know why Qin Han asked him this, the assistant replied honestly, “Brother Han, I saw it.”

“Do you think her boyfriend is hostile toward me?” Qin Han was confused. “Or am I wrong?”

The assistant was stunned.

He turned to look at Mo Yesi and thought for a while before saying, “Brother Han, you’re right. I feel it too.”

“You felt it too? Then, why do you think her boyfriend is hostile towards me?”

Qin Han couldn’t think of a reason.

He hadn’t bullied Qiao Mianmian, nor had he had any scandals with her.

Why was her boyfriend hostile towards him?

The assistant thought about it seriously and said, “He’s probably unhappy because you’re good-looking and you’re a couple in the show with his girlfriend?”

Qin Han was stunned.

“Her boyfriend is so petty?” Qin Han had read the script beforehand, so he knew that he and Qiao Mianmian had two intimate scenes this afternoon.

He frowned and looked at Mo Yesi again.

For the first time in his life, he felt immense pressure because he had to film a certain scene.

This pressure wasn’t from work.

...

Qiao Mianmian had no idea about what had happened.

She went to the dressing room to change and put on her makeup. After leaving the dressing room, she walked to the filming location.
