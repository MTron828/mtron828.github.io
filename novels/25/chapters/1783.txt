No one had anything to say. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

It was the same for the previous few episodes, so everyone knew the rules.

Zhao Yuan got someone to take out a box and said, “Then, let’s draw lots. We’ll stay in whichever room we draw. Who’s first?”

“Let me do it.” Zhan Bo went forward and reached into the box, taking out a folded note.

“Open it and take a look. Which room is it?” Zhao Yuan asked.

Zhan Bo nodded and opened it. “Room 7.”

“Room 7 is over there.” Zhao Yuan pointed in a direction and said, “It’s the room next to the gourd rack. The room number is marked on the door.”

Zhan Bo took a look and dragged his luggage over.

He walked over and saw a sign hanging on the door. The number was written on it.

Zhan Bo pushed the door open and entered.

At first glance, he felt that the room wasn’t bad.

Although the facilities were simple, it was very clean. The bedsheets were brand new, and there was a bouquet of flowers in a glass bottle on the window sill.

The vine on the calabash rack climbed up the window and made a small calabash.

There was no bad smell in the room. The air was filled with the fragrance of flowers.

The cameraman followed him inside.

After looking around the room, Zhan Bo turned around and said to the camera, “The room isn’t bad. It’s pretty clean, much better than I imagined. Now, I’m going to start packing.”

With that, he squatted down to unpack his luggage.

The room had already installed a 360-degree camera that would capture every move of the artiste.

The people outside continued to draw lots.

The second person to draw was Shen Fei. She drew the room next to the largest room. The lighting was good, and the size was suitable. Shen Fei was quite satisfied.

Those who had watched the previous episodes knew that the best rooms had been taken away, and the remaining rooms were very bad.

No one wanted to stay in a bad room.

Hence, after Shen Fei was done, Little Xiao and Song Ke immediately went over and wanted a better room.

Only Qiao Mianmian stood rooted to the ground as if waiting for them to pick her room.

The cameraman quietly captured this scene.

The result was that the room Song Ke and Little Xiao drew was neither good nor bad. Han Yan’s room was also very average.

Most importantly, no one had drawn the largest and best room!

Qiao Mianmian was the last to draw.

When her time came, the people around looked at her.

After she drew it out, Zhao Yuan looked at the note in her hand and joked. “The best room hasn’t been drawn yet. I wonder who the lucky person will be. Mianmian, before looking at the result, can you answer my question?”

Qiao Mianmian smiled. “Alright, ask away, Brother Zhao.”

Zhao Yuan looked at the note in her hand. “Do you think you’re the lucky one?”

“This?” Qiao Mianmian looked down at the note in her hand and shook her head. “I don’t know. I don’t think I’m so lucky. I’m the kind of person who rarely gets another bottle of water, so I think the possibility is very small.”
