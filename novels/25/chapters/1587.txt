Chapter 1588: Was He... Sick?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“How dare you bully her? You’re courting death!”

The thought of what he saw made Gong Zeli’s blood boil.

He didn’t dare to imagine that if he hadn’t come here for something... if he hadn’t met her...

What would happen next?

At the thought of the possible consequences, his eyes turned red again, and he tightened his grip.

“Ah, don’t hit me, don’t hit me! Help!” Boss Huang almost fainted after a few punches. He used his hands to cover his bloodstained face and rolled on the ground.

Everyone in the room was shocked.

Someone went forward to stop him, but when he recognized Gong Zeli, his face turned pale.

He immediately went back.

Soon, everyone knew that the man who pinned Boss Huang to the ground was the Young Master of the Gong family, Gong Zeli.

This time, no one dared to help.

Who would dare offend the Young Master of the Gong family?

Boss Huang’s screams never stopped.

He was beaten until his face was covered in blood. Then, his voice gradually became softer.

“Gong Zeli, stop hitting me.”

Qiao Mianmian looked at Gong Zeli’s bloodshot eyes in horror. He was beating Boss Huang to death as if possessed. Seeing that Boss Huang was gradually losing strength and didn’t even have the strength to cry, she was afraid that something would happen if he continued hitting him. She wanted to pull Gong Zeli away.

She’d just grabbed Gong Zeli’s arm when she felt him stiffen.

Then, all his actions froze.

Qiao Mianmian was stunned for a while, but she didn’t think too much about it. Seeing that he had stopped, she finally heaved a sigh of relief.

She quickly pulled him away. “Don’t hit him anymore. If you continue, he will die.”

The man who seemed to be possessed by Satan just a moment ago was now a completely different person. Not only did his terrifying aura dissipate, but he was also like an obedient primary school student, obediently letting Qiao Mianmian pull him aside.

At this point, Boss Huang had already fainted.

His bodyguards waited for Gong Zeli to leave before they carried Boss Huang to the hospital.

Qiao Mianmian only let go after the bodyguards sent Boss Huang off.

Gong Zeli seemed to have calmed down. His eyes weren’t as red as before, and there wasn’t any anger in them.

Qiao Mianmian felt a little afraid when she thought about how he looked just now.

She suddenly recalled that someone said that the Young Master of the Gong family was suffering from mania. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

When he was very young, he even hurt people when he fell ill.

Was he... having a relapse?

Qiao Mianmian was a little afraid, but she was also very grateful.

No matter what, Gong Zeli saved her.

If he hadn’t appeared in time, Qiao Mianmian wouldn’t have dared to think about what would have happened.

Boss Huang lost his rationality after being hit on the head by her. He didn’t even care when she said Bai Yusheng was her brother.

“Gong Zeli, are you alright?”

Qiao Mianmian was shocked to see the blood on the back of his hand. “Are you injured?”

Gong Zeli didn’t say anything.

His heart was still racing.

He could still feel the warmth of her hand on his arm.
