“Y-Young Master Yan, what’s the matter?” Su Su took a small step back and distanced herself from him.

Yan Shaoqing smiled and said lazily, “Little girl, you should know very well why you can stay with Fourth Bro, right?”

Stunned, Su Su looked up. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

She saw Yan Shaoqing’s long and narrow eyes staring at her.

He usually looked frivolous and unreliable, but at this moment, being stared at by him, Su Su felt like his peach blossom eyes had a penetrating power, instantly seeing through her thoughts.

She was flustered.

“Young… Young Master Yan, what do you mean? Su Su doesn’t understand…”

“It doesn’t matter if you really don’t understand or if you’re pretending.” Yan Shaoqing looked down at her. His eyes were very calm, very different from his usual playful look. “Fourth Bro only left you by his side in a moment of folly. When he understands, return to where you came from. You won’t stay by his side for too long, so it’s best to behave yourself. Don’t think about things you shouldn’t.

“And don’t do anything you shouldn’t do just because of that.

“Don’t worry. You’re with Fourth Bro, he won’t mistreat you.”

Su Su’s eyes widened and she turned pale.

Yan Shaoqing looked at her again. “Stay in peace until the day you leave. What you get is enough for you to live a carefree life. Otherwise, not only will you not get anything, you won’t have a good life in the future either.

“Little girl, be smart. You should know what’s best for you.”

With that, Yan Shaoqing ignored the person who was about to faint and walked past her.

He wasn’t trying to humiliate her.

But he was worried that history would repeat itself.

That was why he said it first. Even if the other party had any intentions, it would serve as a deterrent.

It all depended on how smart Su Su was.

If she was like those scheming women, having thoughts she shouldn’t have, but hoping for something she shouldn’t have, then she’d definitely ruin her future.

He hoped she was smart.

Otherwise, Fourth Bro would really be in trouble.

Not long after Yan Shaoqing left, the changing room door was pushed open again.

Gong Zeli walked out in his sports attire.

Seeing him, Su Su couldn’t help but smile shyly and sweetly. Her eyes lit up as she took two steps forward and called softly, “Mr. Gong.”

Gong Zeli looked at her and nodded.

Su Su’s gaze landed on him. She was stunned for a few seconds when she saw him in his black sports attire.

Gong Zeli was different from usual.

He was usually dressed in black and had a cold aura.

Although he was still in black today, he looked much more casual in sportswear..
