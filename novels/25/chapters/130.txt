Chapter 131: I Can Sleep on the Floor

The desire in the man’s eyes did not diminish.

He looked at her like a beast eyeing a small lamb.

The lamb was practically shaking in fear...

Mo Yesi’s eyes darkened a little as he thought about the lamb he had just kissed.

This lamb was far more appetizing than he had expected.

He was going to get addicted after this first taste of it.

If she hadn’t pushed him away, he might not have been able to control himself.

Beads of sweat could be seen on his forehead...

A certain part of his body had reacted much earlier.

Qiao Mianmian saw it and her face and ears went red instantly.

She quickly shifted her gaze and opened her luggage. “I-I’m going to unpack my luggage first. If you want to stay for the night, I’ll sleep on the couch.”

That kiss had scared her.

She could barely think about it.

That was just a kiss, and he was already... that way.

If they shared a bed, could he really hold back?

Qiao Mianmian couldn’t quite believe him.

She could feel that Mo Yesi had very strong desires.

So strong that... it scared her.

Mo Yesi looked at her for a few seconds before smiling. “Baby, how could I bear to have you sleep on the couch? You’ll take the bed, I’ll take the couch.”

Qiao Mianmian immediately thought about how small the couch in the living room was.

She might be able to sleep through the night.

But Mo Yesi was too tall for that.

He wouldn’t even be able to stretch his legs out.

She furrowed her brows. “The couch is too small. You won’t be able to get a good sleep.”

Mo Yesi’s eyes flickered. “Then I’ll sleep in your room.”

Qiao Mianmian was a little taken aback. “... No.”

“I’ll take the floor.” Mo Yesi looked at her. “There are extra blankets here. I can sleep on the floor.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

Before she responded, the man went on, “Baby, you won’t let me sleep on the bed with you, but you can’t deny me of the floor, right? Don’t forget, we’re already married.

“Don’t you think it’s too much to chase your newly-wedded husband out of the room?”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

She thought about it and did feel that it was a little overboard.

Before they got married, he had already said that he didn’t want them to just be man and wife in name.

He wanted her to act as a wife should.

It was bad enough that she wouldn’t let him on the bed, but chasing him out...

Was way overboard.

After some self-reflection, she nodded a little abashedly. “... Alright, then. I’ll look for more blankets.”

“Mm.” Mo Yesi smiled. “I’ll go shower in the meantime.”

With that, he loosened his tie and walked towards the washroom.

Qiao Mianmian was shocked. “Wait, I don’t have clothes for you to change into.”

Mo Yesi was already at the door. He turned around and said, “I got Wei Zheng to get me some clothes on my way here. He should be reaching soon, help me get it in a while.”
