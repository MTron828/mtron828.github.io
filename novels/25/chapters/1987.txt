Chapter 1989: But This Time, I Won’t Make a Mistake Again

It was an unknown number.

Qiao Mianmian had previously blacklisted Su Ze.

Suspecting it was him, she hung up.

Just as she was about to block this number, she received a message: [This is Gong Zeli. Qiao Mianmian, can we talk? I want to tell you about what happened 10 years ago.]

Qiao Mianmian looked at the message and moved her finger away from the “blacklist” button.

Her cell phone rang again. It was Gong Zeli.

Qiao Mianmian hesitated for a while before picking it up. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“Qiao Mianmian, did you see my message?” Gong Zeli’s voice sounded. “Are you free now? Let’s talk.”

Qiao Mianmian had mixed feelings about Gong Zeli.

In the past, she wasn’t sure of his feelings for her.

She would even think that she was overthinking.

But now...

Ever since she confirmed that Gong Zeli really had feelings for her, Qiao Mianmian’s mood was completely different from before.

Even though she was only talking to him on the phone and not facing him, she still felt uncomfortable.

“Mr. Gong, I think it’s inappropriate for you to call me. I don’t think there’s anything to talk about between us.” Qiao Mianmian rejected him without thinking.

She was already avoiding suspicion when she wasn’t sure what Gong Zeli was thinking about her.

Now that she knew what he was thinking, she didn’t want to have anything to do with him.

How could she meet Gong Zeli privately?

“I just want to talk to you about what happened 10 years ago,” Gong Zeli said after a moment of silence.

“Mr. Gong, I think you might have made a mistake.” Qiao Mianmian said coldly, “I didn’t go to the Gong family 10 years ago, so it can’t be me who saved you. Although I don’t know why you think of me as your savior, I want to say that I’m really not. I really didn’t save you.”

“I didn’t get the wrong person.” Gong Zeli seemed a little angry. “You did attend my birthday party 10 years ago. You don’t remember, but that was because you got into a car accident. Because of that, you forgot a lot of things that year.

“I made a mistake once, treating someone else as you. I won’t make the same mistake again.”

Car accident...

Qiao Mianmian was stunned.

She remembered a car accident many years ago.

But Gong Zeli said that she forgot going to his birthday party and saving him because of that car accident.

Qiao Mianmian didn’t know if he was telling the truth.

However, that wasn’t important.

Even if she really saved Gong Zeli that night, this was meaningless to her.

She felt that it was good to forget.

If she had really saved Gong Zeli that night, based on her personality, she would have saved someone if she could.

If it was anyone else, she would save them as long as she could.

But Gong Zeli seemed to take this very seriously.

Qiao Mianmian kept quiet for a while before saying calmly, “Mr. Gong, I really don’t remember.”
