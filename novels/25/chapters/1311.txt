He didn’t show it on his face at all, but his heart was already beating like a drum. He was flustered and didn’t seem as nonchalant as he looked.

From the moment he knew that Qiao Mianmian was his savior, he couldn’t face her like before.

She felt as if he had returned to his school days and was flustered when he saw the girl he liked.

The more he pretended to be calm, the more flustered he was.

He didn’t know how to face her because he would panic when he saw her. His mind was blank.

He was afraid of saying something or doing something wrong.

Hence, he decided not to say or do anything.

He liked her so much, but he was so cold and arrogant. The more he liked her, the more he would pretend to be indifferent.

He was better now and wouldn’t be as silly as before.

But he was still nervous.

He didn’t know how to interact with her.

He was thinking that Qiao Mianmian was really good-looking.

Why didn’t he realize that she was so good-looking before?

She was just like a little angel.

He finally knew why Mo Yesi’s tree had blossomed.

“Ah? MC’s endorsement?” Qiao Mianmian was stunned for a few seconds before remembering that MC was a makeup brand under the Gong Corporation.

Gong Zeli must have informed his subordinates about her signing with MC.

It was Gong Zeli who gave Mo Yesi face.

But she still wanted to terminate the contract with MC. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

As the boss, Gong Zeli definitely knew about this.

So, he was actually looking for her today because of this, not because he wanted to plead for Shen Rou?

At this thought, Qiao Mianmian felt that she should give Gong Zeli an explanation.

No matter what, it was against the contract spirit for her to terminate the contract after signing it.

Gong Zeli could even ask her to pay the compensation.

“I’m sorry, Mr. Gong.” Qiao Mianmian knew that she was in the wrong, so she apologized sincerely. “I decided to terminate the contract with MC because of some personal reasons. It’s my fault for breaching the contract. I’ll pay the termination fee according to the contract. If my actions cause any losses to MC, I’m really, really sorry.”

Gong Zeli frowned. “I’m not asking for the compensation fee. I just want to know why you terminated the contract with MC. Are you dissatisfied with the contract fee, or do you think MC’s brand isn’t good enough? If you’re dissatisfied with the contract fee, you can name your price. I can afford it no matter how much you want.”

The Young Master of the Gong family had always been rich.

He didn’t lack money.

Qiao Mianmian’s lips twitched. “No, I...”

“If you don’t like MC’s endorsement, the Gong Corporation has many other endorsements to choose from. Be it jewelry, property, cars, or other skincare brands, you can endorse anything you like. The next season— no, all these endorsements will be given to you in the future.”

Qiao Mianmian widened her eyes in shock.

What... was he talking about?

“Mr. Gong, you...” The strange feeling in her heart grew stronger.
