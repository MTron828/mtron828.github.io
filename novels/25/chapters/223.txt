Chapter 225: Some Dysfunction

Qiao Chen was speechless.

In other words, his sister had struck the lottery.

After being betrayed by a scumbag like Su Ze, she immediately married a handsome, young, and rich man.

And this man was even so good to her!

“Sister, I want to ask you something. Can you answer me seriously?” Qiao Chen straightened his face and his expression became even more serious and solemn.

Qiao Mianmian also turned serious after seeing his expression.

Staring at her serious brother, she asked doubtfully, “What is it?”

Qiao Chen asked seriously, “Does brother-in-law have any information that can be used against you?”

Qiao Mianmian: “???”

What did Qiao Chen mean?!

The handsome young man looked at her reaction, frowned, and asked again, “It can’t be that brother-in-law fell in love with you at first sight, and then loved you so much that he feared you would be taken away by others, hence marrying you so hastily?”

He was still very suspicious about his sister’s flash marriage.

Even if his sister had married his brother-in-law to treat his illness.

But what about brother-in-law?

Qiao Chen was well-aware of Mo Yesi’s qualifications.

With his brother-in-law’s qualifications, he was one in a million among men.

He could find any woman he wanted.

It wasn’t that Qiao Chen felt like his sister wasn’t qualified and wasn’t good enough.

It was just that... objectively speaking, his sister’s qualifications were worlds apart from his brother-in-law’s.

Other than their appearance, they had a huge gap in other aspects.

Su Ze’s qualifications were already considered top-notch.

Many women even had their eyes on him.

But his brother-in-law was countless times better than Su Ze, so one could only imagine how many women were setting their sights on him.

Qiao Chen felt it wasn’t very likely that he would fall in love with his sister at first sight.

A man like his brother-in-law didn’t have a shortage of beauties around him, so he wouldn’t be immediately moved by a beautiful woman.

So... what was the reason?

Seeing Qiao Chen’s suspicious eyes, Qiao Mianmian’s lips twitched, and she wanted to punch him.

This brat.

Was he still her brother!

“Could it be...” Qiao Chen seemed to be musing to himself. Without waiting for Qiao Mianmian’s reply, he had already come up with countless reasons in his mind. Thinking of one of them, his expression changed slightly, and the corner of his lips twitched.

Then, he lowered his voice and asked tentatively, “Does brother-in-law... have a physical dysfunction?”

Otherwise, he really couldn’t think of a reason why a man of such good conditions would rush to get married. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

And a flash marriage with a woman he had only known for a few days.

There must be something wrong!

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

She frowned deeply and the corner of her lips twitched again. She stared at her brother speechlessly. “So what dysfunction do you think your brother-in-law has?”

“Erm...” Qiao Chen scratched his head. “Sister, don’t hit me.”

Qiao Mianmian smiled. “Of course not.”

Qiao Chen was speechless.

Why did he feel frightened by his sister’s smile?

“Erm, I think, cough, cough...” He turned to look at the door and checked that there was nobody there before whispering mysteriously, “He has a problem there! Some kind of sexual dysfunction.”
