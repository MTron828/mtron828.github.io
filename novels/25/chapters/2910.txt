Translator: Atias Studios | Editor: Atlas Studias

They left the hospital.

After getting into the car, Qjao Mianmian was very quiet.

“What’s wrong? Are you in a bad mood?” Mo Yesi sensed her mood and reached

out to pat her head. “You shouldn’t have come. I can imagine what kind of

words a person like her would say.

You don’t have to care about those things. Are you hungry? 1 know a good

place. Shall I bring you out for supper now?

Sensing that she was a little down, Mo Yesi comforted her gently.

Qjao Mianmian turned to look at him. “Tm not in a bad mood. I didn’t take Qjao

Anxin’s words to heart. I knew from the start that she wouldn’t say anything

nice to me.”

But I think you’re in a bad mood.” Mo Yesi tidied the loose hair on her

forehead and stared at her with his deep black eyes. T believe my gut feeling

won’t go wrong. You can tell me if anything is bothering you, don’t keep it to

yourself.

“Baby, I’m your husband. There’s nothing you can’t tell me.”

Qjao Mianmian was silent for a while before saying, T didn’t expect Qjao Anxin

to hate me so much, nor did I expect her to hate me because she thought that I

deliberately took away the people she liked. I still rernember the few people she

mentioned, but I’ve never fought with her for them.

I didn’t do anything from the start to the end. I never liked her since young,

but I never thought of snatching away the people she liked on purpose.”

After Qjao Mianmian finished her sentence, she blinked and emphasized each

word as if she was afraid that the man in front of her would not believe her.

“Mo Yesi, I really didn’t do what she said. If she didn’t tell me today, I wouldn’t

know why she hated me so much.”

“You don’t have to explain it to me.”The man’s slender and white fingers

pressed lightly against her lips. His dark and deep eyes were filled with

gentleness as he said softly and gently, “I didn’t believe a single word she said.

“Baby, I’ve said it before. I have one hundred percent trust in you. I won’t

suspect you no matter what. You didn’t do anything wrong, so you don’t have

to care about why Qjao Anxin hates you.

“She’s the one on the dark side, jealous that you’re better than her in

everything. Even if you didn’t do anything, you’re still a hundred mistakes and

a thousand mistakes in her eyes. She’ll never be kind to you.

“She only has herself to blame for today.

Don’t think about this anymore. Think about something happy. Or whatever

you want to eat, Ill go with you right now. Don’t you like milk tea the most? Do

you want me to buy you one now?”

Mo Yesi tried his best to coax his wife.

“Milk tea?” Qjao Mianmian’s attention was immediately drawn away. “But it’s

already so late. The milk tea shop should be closed.”

“You can have it anytime you want.” Mo Yesi smiled. “Then, Tll bring you to buy

milk tea now, and next we’ll go for supper. You should rest well when you get

back and stop thinking about such things that affect your mood.

I heard that your brother returned to the country, and he broughta woman

with him. Is this true?”

“Hm? You know about this? Who did you hear it from?” Qjao Mianmian was a Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

little surprised to hear this as she had not told Mo Yesi the entire story.

“Shaoqing told me. He said that he took the same flight as your brother when

he returned and saw it.”

“Yes, it’s true. Then, did Shaoqing tell you what my brother’s girlfriend looks

like? Is she the kind with long, straight hair, fair skin, and classy aura that

makes her look gentle and demure?
