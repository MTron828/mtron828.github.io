Chapter 493: I Came to See You

Jiang Luoli: [You can’t despise Prince Charming because of this too. Men sometimes just aren’t in a good state, it’s normal that they don’t perform up to standard at times. Is it always so short when you do it with him?]

Qiao Mianmian’s face burned up once again as she typed: [Today... was our first time.]

So, she really had no idea.

Jiang Luoli: [Your first? Damn, you’ve been married for so long, and this is your first? How could Prince Charming possibly resist you for so long? Your skin is so good, even a woman like me can barely resist you sometimes, not to mention men. Is Prince Charming actually alright in that aspect?]

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

How was she to know?

Mo Yesi seemed very normal. He didn’t appear lacking in any aspect.

Anyway, he had always expressed interest in her. It wasn’t as if he wasn’t appealed by her.

Even this morning, she could feel that he was passionate, eager, and taking a lot of initiative...

Qiao Mianmian exited the elevator and wondered if she should message Mo Yesi.

She could show some concern.

Just in case he was overthinking things.

What if he really thought that she despised him?

She clicked open her chat with Mo Yesi and was about to write to him when a message appeared.

Mo Yesi: [You’ve signed your contract? I’m waiting outside for you, come out.]

Qiao Mianmian: [???]

Mo Yesi: [I’m downstairs.]

Qiao Mianmian looked up and saw his black Bentley right there.

She could tell right away that it was Mo Yesi’s car.

She was stunned for a while, but quickly locked her cell phone and walked to the car.

The backseat door was opened.

Qiao Mianmian went over and got into the car.

It smelt great inside, of Mo Yesi’s cologne. She had no idea what sort of cologne he used, but it was unique, and she’d never smelt anything like that on others.

She turned and asked him, “What are you doing here?”

The man looked at her deeply, but his expression was a little unnatural today. “I came to see you. Did the contract-signing go well?”

“Yes.”

Qiao Mianmian nodded. “Very well.”

Mo Yesi looked at her smile and was a little entranced by it for a moment. He then said, “Show me the contract.”

Although he knew that Bai Yusheng wouldn’t give his wife an illegitimate contract or anything like it, he still felt a need to see it for himself.

“Okay.” Qiao Mianmian took the contract out of her bag and handed it to him.

She’d already gone through it, it was fine.

But there was still the fine print that she hadn’t gone through in detail. She didn’t understand all of it but didn’t think it was nice to question it too, so she simply signed at the end.

This role didn’t come easy for her.

So, all she wanted was to confirm it.

With Mo Yesi going through it for her, it was all the better. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

He was surely very good at this.

Mo Yesi went through it very efficiently and handed it back to her when he was sure it was fine.
