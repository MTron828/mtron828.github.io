Chapter 1143: Even If It’s Just a Scandal, I Don’t Like It

He wanted to change his mind now. He didn’t want to hide it anymore, nor did he want her to continue staying in the entertainment industry.

Qiao Mianmian widened her eyes in shock, thinking that she had heard wrongly.

“Mo Yesi, what did you say?” She murmured in surprise. “Leave the entertainment industry? I... I didn’t hear wrongly, did I?”

She wouldn’t be surprised if anyone else said that to her.

But if it was Mo Yesi...

Mo Yesi looked into her disbelieving eyes and hesitated.

Back then, he supported her acting career because he knew that she really liked this industry.

And not just playing with tickets.

Now he wanted her to give up her favorite thing just because he didn’t like her profession. Was that too much? nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

What right did he have to deprive her of her preferences?

He was her husband, the person closest to her. If he didn’t support her, she would be disappointed.

Mo Yesi immediately changed his mind.

He couldn’t selfishly take away her preferences just because of his preferences.

However, if she continued to stay in the entertainment industry, their relationship couldn’t be made public. He still had to continue their secret relationship.

She would also have all kinds of scandals with other men.

These things were inevitable for anyone in the entertainment industry.

He didn’t know if he would be able to hold himself back the next time she had a scandal with another man.

In the end, he still cared about her and took over everything. He closed his eyes and said in a dry voice, “Just take it that I’m talking nonsense. You don’t have to mind.”

But Qiao Mianmian had heard him clearly and knew that he wouldn’t say such things.

She thought of all the dirt on Weibo and looked at his expression. She bit her lip and asked softly, “Are you angry because of what they said on Weibo?”

She had created too many scandals recently.

No matter how much he trusted her, he would still mind.

“Mianmian.” Mo Yesi looked at her, touched her head, and sighed softly. “I don’t want to lie to you. I do mind a little. I thought I wouldn’t mind it because those things are all fake, and I know that very well.

“But I’m sorry, I can’t control my heart. Seeing so many people guessing that your relationship with Fourth Gong is not ordinary, I really can’t remain unbothered. Do you know that every time this happens, I want to stand out and tell everyone that you’re mine?”

His large hand gently landed on her cheek and caressed her soft skin. He sighed softly again and smiled bitterly. “Baby, you’re mine. Other than me, I don’t want you to have anything to do with any other man. Even if it’s just a scandal, I don’t like it.

“Besides, Fourth Gong is my brother. Do you understand my feelings?”

Qiao Mianmian was stunned for a few seconds before she apologized softly. “I’m sorry. I don’t know why they keep spreading rumors about me and Gong Zeli. Maybe it was because he helped me on Weibo that those reporters mistakenly thought...”

Qiao Mianmian understood his feelings.

Just like how she knew very well that there was nothing between him and Shen Rou, but if there were always rumors about them, she couldn’t possibly not mind at all.

“You didn’t do anything wrong.” Mo Yesi was silent for a few seconds before letting go and turning around. “Forget it, just pretend I didn’t say anything. It’s getting late, I’ll take you out for dinner.”
