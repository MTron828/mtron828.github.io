“Ah Si, did I disturb your rest?” Shen Rou’s voice was gentle, especially when she called him “Ah Si”.

Qiao Mianmian kept quiet.

Shen Rou didn’t know that it was her who picked up the phone. Qiao Mianmian kept quiet and didn’t say anything, but she didn’t seem to mind. She smiled gently and said, “You’re in F City now, right? I heard from Aunt Mo that something happened to Mianmian, and you were worried about her, so you went to look for her. How is it now, is her mood stable? What’s with the rumors, did she explain them to you?

“Actually, I’ve seen that video too. I think it must have been a malicious publicity stunt by the unscrupulous media. There aren’t any ambiguous actions in the video. Moreover, Mianmian is already married to you, why would she need to ride on the popularity of that actor? Ah Si, you pamper her so much. As long as she asks you, it’s up to you to decide which female lead you want. But Ah Si, do you know that Aunt Mo doesn’t approve of Mianmian’s acting? She mentioned this to me today. She feels that with the Mo family’s current power and status, it wouldn’t be good to let others know that Second Madam is an actress.

“I also know that this is your family matter, and as an outsider, I shouldn’t say too much. It’s just that I feel that being an actress isn’t a good job, and it’s hard to avoid gossip. Have you... thought of making Mianmian leave the entertainment industry?”

Qiao Mianmian listened quietly. She just wanted to know what Shen Rou wanted to say.

She had more or less understood what she meant.

Was she trying to help Madam Mo persuade her to quit the entertainment industry?

“Ah Si, are you... listening to me? I know you dote on Mianmian a lot, so you let her do whatever she wants. But do you really think it’s good for her to be like this? The entertainment industry is a huge dye tank, are you sure you can let her stay there forever?”

Qiao Mianmian couldn’t help but sneer. “I didn’t know Miss Shen liked to worry about other people’s matters. I heard what you said just now very clearly. First of all, thank you for worrying about me, Miss Shen. But I want to say that since Miss Shen knows that this is our family’s business, an outsider like you shouldn’t be a busybody. Whether the entertainment industry is good or not, whether it’s suitable for me or not, it has nothing to do with you. As an actress, I didn’t even say anything about my husband. Miss Shen, as an outsider, kept saying bad things about me. You’re even more worried about me than my husband.”

“Qiao Mianmian?!” Shen Rou was shocked to hear her voice. “Why is Ah Si’s cell phone with you? Where is he?”

“My husband?”

Qiao Mianmian glanced in the direction of the bathroom and smiled. She walked towards the bathroom and knocked on the door.

The man’s low and sexy voice came from inside. “Baby, what’s wrong?”

Qiao Mianmian looked down at her phone and said in a coy voice, “Hubby, how much longer do you need to shower? I’m so tired after exercising so much. Come out and sleep with me, I can’t sleep alone.” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Qiao Mianmian deliberately played coy, hoping to piss Shen Rou off.
