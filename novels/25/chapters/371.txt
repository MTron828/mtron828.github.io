Chapter 372: I Want to Do Everything Together With You

He would never need to compare prices and products.

Only someone as poor as she would have to do such a thing.

At this thought, she felt her heart tighten with slight pain. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

The rich and the poor were indeed people of two very different worlds.

“Are you tired of shopping? Do you not feel like walking anymore?” Qiao Mianmian had spotted a rest area at this level and asked him gently after some thinking. “Do you want to just wait for me at the rest area? You don’t have to continue shopping with me, I will finish my shopping as soon as possible and come to find you afterward.”

Mo Yesi just stood quietly at the side when she was browsing through the bags just now.

He also stood silently watching her as the employee was promoting the bag to her.

As he had little to zero understanding about such things, he couldn’t even give his opinion or anything.

Just thinking about it made Qiao Mianmian feel so bored.

He would have obviously felt even more bored.

Truth to be told, Mo Yesi was indeed quite bored the whole time.

But he had already promised Qiao Mianmian to come shopping with her, so he should accompany her even if he felt bored by it.

They were supposed to be on a date, after all.

It was their first date, so he definitely didn’t want to ruin it.

“I’ll accompany you.” Looking at the shop in front of them, Mo Yesi wrapped his arm around her and pulled her closer. The corners of his lips curled up as he spoke. “If you like to compare, we’ll do that. You don’t have to rush or worry about me, just take your time. I don’t feel bored at all.

“Whichever way you like to do your shopping, we’ll do exactly that together. It’s still early, anyway. We can shop through every store on this level if you want to.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

“Mo Yesi, you really don’t need to do this...”

“Babe, have you forgotten what I said previously?” Mo Yesi cut her off as he lowered his head to look at her, smiling gently. “I won’t be bored no matter what we do, as long as I’m with you. Everything that you want or like to do, I want to do them all together with you in the future.”

Qiao Mianmian looked at him blankly.

Her little heart that had just calmed down moments ago started beating fast as if it was racing against a train.

She was finished.

She heard this voice in her heart telling her: Qiao Mianmian, you’re so smitten.

She found such an attractive husband that could sweet talk so well. She was really finished.

...

Walking into the fourth store, Qiao Mianmian decided to pick up her pace and make her decision quickly.

Even though Mo Yesi didn’t say anything, she herself felt too bad to continue shopping any further.

The bags at this store all had better designs overall as compared to the previous stores. Qiao Mianmian was just about to take pictures of the few bags that caught her eye and send them over to Jiang Luoli to ask her which one she preferred.

Just as she picked up a bag, the low and deep voice behind her rang beside her ears gently. “Babe, I’m going to take a call. Take your time, alright?”

He took his phone and walked out of the store after informing her.

A store employee immediately walked over as she saw Qiao Mianmian holding up a bag and looking at it. “Miss, you have a really good eye for products. This bag is our bestseller. We have three different colors for this design. I can bring the other two colors out for you to look at if you are interested.”

The store employee saw Qiao Mianmian walk in together with Mo Yesi just now.

She could instinctively tell that Qiao Mianmian could buy their products.

Even though this female customer was dressed in rather plain and average looking clothes, the man that came in with her was obviously rich.

The employee’s attitude naturally became welcoming and warm.

Qiao Mianmian also liked this bag’s design very much. She originally thought that there was only one color available, but knowing that she had three colors to choose from, she happily agreed to it.

She nodded at the employee. “Sure. May I see the other colors, please.”

“Please wait for a moment, Miss. I will immediately bring them to you.”
