Chapter 993: She Really Likes Him So Much

If it wasn’t for Madam Mo and Shen Rou, she would’ve rushed out to hug and kiss him.

How could her husband be so good?

She really, really liked him.

At this moment, she was glad that she chose to marry him.

If she missed such a man, she would probably regret it for the rest of her life.

Qiao Mianmian stood at the door and saw Madam Mo’s increasingly awful expression.

She thought for a while and sent Mo Yesi a WeChat message: [Hubby, I heard Mom’s voice just now. Is she here? Bring the clothes in quickly. Mom’s here, I have to go out and meet her.]

Madam Mo didn’t like Qiao Mianmian, and the reverse was also true.

She could have continued to pretend to be asleep and never go out to see Madam Mo.

She didn’t want to see Madam Mo.

But after some thought, she decided to go out and greet her.

No matter what, Madam Mo was Mo Yesi’s biological mother.

Even if she couldn’t like her now, she couldn’t lose basic respect.

No matter how Madam Mo treated her.

As a daughter-in-law, she just had to do her job well.

At least, she had to have a clear conscience.

She didn’t want to force things anymore.

The only person she cared about now was Mo Yesi.

As long as he was by her side.

She didn’t care about anyone else.

Outside the lounge.

Mo Yesi’s cell phone rang. He saw Qiao Mianmian’s message and picked up the bag of clothes on the table.

Without greeting Madam Mo and Shen Rou, he turned and walked into the lounge.

Madam Mo’s expression darkened.

Her chest heaved up and down.

“Aunt Mo, don’t be angry.” Shen Rou bit her lip gently. “Brother Ah Si isn’t targeting you. He just... doesn’t want to see me. I-I think I’d better go.”

She blinked and said with slightly reddened eyes, “I shouldn’t have come. I don’t want you and Brother Ah Si to be so unhappy because of me.” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“What are you talking about.” The angrier Madam Mo was with Mo Yesi, the more she felt that Shen Rou was sensible. At this moment, she only hated Shen Rou for not being her daughter. If only she had such a sensible and caring daughter.

She wouldn’t be so angry.

“Rourou, this has nothing to do with you.” Madam Mo looked at the tightly shut door of the lounge and gritted her teeth. “It’s all because of that vixen. She caused so much trouble the moment she married into the Mo family.

“Why are you leaving? What’s there to be afraid of? Even if she’s married to Ah Si, she’s nothing. I have to wait for that vixen to come out today. I want to see what she dares to do to me.”

Shen Rou saw the hatred and dissatisfaction in Madam Mo’s eyes, and a hint of satisfaction flashed past her eyes.

...

In the lounge.

Qiao Mianmian changed her clothes and went to the washroom to tidy herself up. After making sure that her appearance was alright, she followed Mo Yesi out.

Mo Yesi stopped at the door and looked at her hesitantly. “You really want to go out? If you don’t want to...”

“Hubby, I know that Mom is here, but I’m still hiding inside and not going out to see her. This isn’t good. She’s your Mom, and she’s my Mom now. I have to respect her. And with you with me, I know you’ll definitely protect me, right?”
