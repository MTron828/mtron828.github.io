Chapter 847: Did You Get My Permission to Date My Girlfriend?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Even though Qiao Mianmian had rejected him before.

But that sort of rejection would only make him braver and want her even more.

Before Su Ze could finish his sentence, a cold voice came from behind. “Mr. Su, don’t you think you’re being too shameless by harassing someone else’s girlfriend?

“You asked for my girlfriend’s permission?”

Su Ze stiffened.

Qiao Mianmian looked up and saw Mo Yesi walking towards her. She was stunned for a moment before pushing Su Ze away and walking towards him quickly.

Before she reached Mo Yesi, the man reached out and pulled her over, wrapping his arm around her waist possessively.

Qiao Mianmian was obedient too. She tugged at the corner of his shirt and asked softly, “Why are you here?”

She wondered if this jealous lover would be jealous again. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

She knew how much he minded Su Ze.

Thankfully, she wasn’t alone with Su Ze and Qiao Anxin.

Otherwise, he would really be jealous.

Mo Yesi looked down at her, and his gaze softened. “You’ve been in the washroom for so long, I got worried.”

Alright.

Afraid that he’d be jealous again, Qiao Mianmian tugged at his sleeve and whispered, “I didn’t know he was eating here. I just came out of the washroom and bumped into him.”

“Mm.” Mo Yesi was rather calm and didn’t seem jealous. “I know.”

Qiao Mianmian glanced at him again. “You’re really not angry?”

“No.” Mo Yesi patted her head and looked up at Su Ze.

Su Ze looked at their intimate actions and heard Mo Yesi call Qiao Mianmian his girlfriend. He was so jealous that he couldn’t even recognize her.

He glared at Mo Yesi.

A moment later, Mo Yesi smiled. “Su Ze, didn’t I warn you previously not to harass my woman anymore? It seems like you didn’t take those words to heart and didn’t take them seriously.”

He was smiling.

But for some reason, Su Ze felt a sense of fear when he heard this.

But he didn’t want to appear weak in front of Qiao Mianmian and lose face. Hence, even though he was afraid, he still forced himself to say, “I’ve known Mianmian for 10 years. Even though we broke up, we’re still friends. I was just talking to my friend, how did it become entanglement?”

As soon as he said that, Qiao Mianmian couldn’t help but retort. “Su Ze, I’ve said it before. From the moment we broke up, we became strangers. I’m not your friend, don’t try to get close to me.”

Su Ze didn’t expect her to rebut him in public.

His expression changed, and he quickly said, “Mianmian, no matter what you think, I’ve always treated you as a friend. I don’t believe that you can really let go of our 10-year relationship just like that.

“I know you’re still angry with me and unwilling to forgive me. That’s why you did something to agitate me. Mianmian, you can choose not to forgive me or ignore me, but you can’t get angry at me by ruining yourself.”

Su Ze didn’t believe that Qiao Mianmian really fell in love with someone else.

Even if the man in front of him was really eligible.
