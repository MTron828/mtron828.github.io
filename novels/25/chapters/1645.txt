Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

The man looked up in confusion. “Mm?”

Jiang Luoli smiled at him. “Because you found a virtuous girlfriend like me. Not only can I make you coffee, but I can also cook for you in the future. Aren’t you happy?”

Mo Shixiu was stunned for a few seconds before he chuckled. “Mm, happy.”

Jiang Luoli couldn’t help but smile too.

“Alright, I won’t disturb you anymore. Go on with your work.”

“Luoli.” Mo Shixiu flipped the document in his hand and looked up.

Jiang Luoli blinked and looked at him. “What’s the matter?”

“You said... you can make me supper?” Mo Shixiu’s eyes were filled with anticipation.

Jiang Luoli nodded. “Yes. Are you hungry now? I can make it for you now. But I can’t do it if it’s too complicated. I only know how to make noodles. If you don’t like it...”

“I like it.” Mo Shixiu interrupted her before she could finish. “No matter what you do, I like it.”

Jiang Luoli was elated.

She smiled sweetly. “Alright, wait for me. I’ll make it now. There’s seafood in the fridge, can I make seafood noodles?”

“Alright.” Mo Shixiu looked at her gently. “I’ll eat whatever you cook.”

Jiang Luoli looked into his gentle eyes and her heartbeat quickened.

How could a man like Mo Shixiu not make women fall for him?

He had every right to make women fall for him.

He had such a handsome face, and he was smiling so gently at her. Even his tone was so gentle.

How could she resist such a man? Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

This was her ideal type.

She wondered if she saved the universe in her previous life.

That was why God was so nice to her and arranged such a good man like Mo Shixiu to be by her side.

...

Jiang Luoli came out of the study smiling.

She was in a good mood.

Even though so many terrible things happened previously, they didn’t affect her.

Until she received a call from Mother Jiang.

“Jiang Luoli, what’s wrong with you? I entrusted you to Zewen for your own good. Why did you let him come back alone? Don’t you know that the person you provoked is someone our Jiang Family can’t afford to offend? Are you trying to make the family suffer now?”

Jiang Luoli didn’t expect Mother Jiang to call her.

And she even criticized her.

“I only know now that your brother’s matter is because of you. Tell me, what trouble did you cause outside to harm our family like this? You caused trouble for them to look for you, why did you harm your brother?

“Let me tell you, if Xiao Hai gets hurt because of you again, I’ll never forgive you.

“Come back now and get the marriage certificate with Zewen, do you hear me!”

Jiang Luoli kept quiet and waited for her to finish.

“Jiang Luoli, did you hear what I just said?” Mother Jiang didn’t hear her response and got even angrier. “Don’t play dead. Come home quickly, do you hear me!”

“Ms. Lin, are you done?”
