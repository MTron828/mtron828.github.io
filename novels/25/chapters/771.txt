Chapter 772: You Have to Believe in Love at First Sight

When she realized that she was slowly falling for him and that he had unknowingly taken a place in her heart, she started to feel afraid.

She was afraid that her feelings would turn into a joke.

To her, losing wasn’t the most painful thing.

But getting the best of everything before losing it completely.

It was like falling from heaven to hell.

Bai Yusheng thought for a while and said, “You don’t think he really likes you?”

“No. I can feel that he likes me. It’s just that I don’t know how much of this love comes from his heart, and how much is because...”

“Because of your uniqueness?” Bai Yusheng looked at the girl in front of him, who seemed to be trapped by her feelings. He thought about it seriously for a while before saying, “You’re worried that if other women were like you and treated him differently, he might fall for someone else?

“Are you afraid that things will turn out the way you think?”

“Mm.

“Brother Bai, do you think I’m overthinking?” Her voice was soft and gentle. “Actually, he treats me very well now. No one has ever treated me so well before. I know that he doesn’t have any other women around him, but I still can’t help but think about it. Do you think I don’t know how fortunate I am?”

Bai Yusheng shook his head. “It’s normal for you to think that way. But if you’re asking for my opinion, I don’t think so. Mo Yesi isn’t as casual as you think, especially when it concerns the other half of his life. I don’t think he chose you only because you’re special to him.

“If he didn’t like you, to begin with, he wouldn’t have married you even if you treated him differently.

“There are many ways for him to study his illness. Getting married is definitely not the only way. Only when he likes you and wants to be with you can he make you his wife.”

Qiao Mianmian’s eyes lit up.

It was as if her discomfort was gone.

Her breathing became smooth again.

She felt as if a huge burden had been lifted off her shoulders.

She looked at Bai Yusheng with eyes full of trust. “Is that really the case? But I’ve only met him once, and he already proposed marriage...”

“Mianmian, you have to believe that love at first sight exists.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

So, did Mo Yesi fall in love with her at first sight? RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“Alright, don’t let your thoughts run wild.” Bai Yusheng stroked her head and said gently, “Actually, it doesn’t matter what his original intention was. You just have to be sure that he likes you now, right?

“Don’t think too much about it. There’s no other use besides making yourself unhappy.”

“Mm, I got it. Brother Bai, thank you for chatting so much with me.”

Qiao Mianmian’s eyes were full of gratitude. “You helped me solve a problem that has been bothering me for a long time. I know what to do now. I won’t bother about this anymore.”

Huang Yilin was furious and anxious as she saw that the trending topics were getting out of hand. She slammed her phone on the table.
