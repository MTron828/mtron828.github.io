Chapter 2190: Something Must Have Happened During This Time

Qiao Mianmian was surrounded by a group of so-called socialites.

They surrounded her with flattering smiles.

“Aiya, Mianmian, your dress is custom-made from the C brand. It looks very expensive. The C brand is really good. Besides the price, it doesn’t have any other shortcomings. But money shouldn’t be a problem for you. Chairman Mo is so willing to spend money on you, to buy you such expensive things.”

“Isn’t that so? Didn’t Chairman Mo give Mianmian a bracelet? That bracelet cost more than 10 million yuan, and Mianmian almost sold it at a low price.”

“It’s this necklace that Mianmian is wearing. It’s worth over 10 million yuan. Can we see it?”

“The necklace and earrings Mianmian is wearing today are also expensive. I’ve seen them in a jewelry store before. They cost a few million yuan.”

“Mianmian, your shoes look really good…”

“Mianmian, what perfume are you wearing? It smells so good…”

“That’s right, Mianmian. Your makeup today is good, too. Which makeup artist did you use?”

“Mianmian, your drama is about to air. I’ve seen the clip. You’re so good at acting.”

…

It took Qiao Mianmian a long time to deal with the socialites and heiresses. Finally, it was time to breathe.

Mo Yesi was also surrounded by a group of businessmen. Qiao Mianmian glanced at him and saw that he was still surrounded by a group of people, so she sent him a WeChat message.

Qiao Mianmian: [I’m going to the washroom.]

After sending the message, she found a waiter and asked where the washroom was.

In the hall.

Gong Zeli had been keeping an eye on her. Seeing that Qiao Mianmian had left, he hesitated for a few seconds before turning to follow her.

Shen Rou saw it when he followed Qiao Mianmian.

She bit her lip and thought about what Gong Zeli had done.

She didn’t know why, but a ridiculous thought flashed across her mind.

She still remembered that Gong Zeli didn’t like Qiao Mianmian at first.

Back then, even if it was because of her, it wouldn’t have changed Gong Zeli’s attitude towards Qiao Mianmian so much. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Something must have happened.

Something she didn’t know.

That was why Gong Zeli’s attitude towards Qiao Mianmian changed so drastically.

Then, what was it?

Shen Rou’s heart raced when that thought flashed through her mind.

Seeing that Gong Zeli was about to disappear from the hall, she hesitated for a few seconds before following him.

…

Qiao Mianmian came out of the washroom.

She was about to return to the lobby to look for Mo Yesi when she met Gong Zeli in the hallway.

She was stunned.

She pretended not to know him and walked past him.

“Qiao Mianmian.” Gong Zeli called her as she walked past him.

Qiao Mianmian didn’t stop. She had no intention of listening to anything he had to say.

“Qiao Mianmian.” Gong Zeli called her again and followed behind her. “I don’t think we’re enemies. Is this how you treat me? You’re not even willing to talk to me?”
