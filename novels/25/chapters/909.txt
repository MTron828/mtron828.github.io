Chapter 910: Miss Jiang, Sorry to Make You Wait

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

That man looked down on her?

She didn’t even like him.

She didn’t want to have anything to do with such a man.

But even though she ignored Assistant Xu, Assistant Xu continued to nag. “Did you hear what I said to you? Jiang Luoli, our Sir has a good character. He feels that a woman like you has suffered, so he wants to make it up to you.

“But after what happened that night, he didn’t force you, right? Logically speaking, he doesn’t have to bear any responsibility, but he still decided to compensate you with a sum of money. Moreover, I dare say that other than my boss, no other man would be so generous.

“But this doesn’t mean anything. It’s just that Sir is kind. If it was another woman with him that night, he would have done the same.”

Assistant Xu was afraid that this Jiang woman would pester his boss.

No matter what, she was the Minister’s first woman.

She definitely had a special place in his heart.

If she continued to pester the minister, what if the minister failed to resist the temptation?

The minister was so outstanding. Even if he wanted to get married and have children in the future, he shouldn’t be with such a woman.

She wasn’t worthy.

Jiang Luoli didn’t want to talk to him at first, but she couldn’t take it anymore.

She frowned and was about to reply when a low and cold voice came from the front. “I’m sorry for making you wait, Miss Jiang.”

Upon hearing this voice, Assistant Xu immediately turned around and greeted him respectfully. “Minister.”

Jiang Luoli was stunned.

She hadn’t seen what the owner of the voice looked like, but the voice sounded strangely familiar.

It was as if she’d heard it somewhere before.

The man’s voice was very pleasant. It was especially magnetic and attractive. His voice was low and deep, and it sounded gentle. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

It was even more alluring.

Jiang Luoli already had a rough idea of what the other party looked like.

The owner of the voice was a mature and steady man who looked especially charismatic and charming.

Footsteps approached her.

As he got closer, she could smell the scent of a man.

He brought some pinewood and some amber and rose fragrance.

It smelled very elegant and mature, the kind that Jiang Luoli liked.

She suddenly felt nervous.

She clenched her fists and took a deep breath.

Jiang Luoli had imagined what that man looked like that night.

When she heard his voice and smelled his scent, she already had a rough picture of him.

But when she looked up and saw the man’s face, she was shocked speechless.

She widened her eyes in disbelief.

Her mind went blank.

At this moment, she couldn’t think properly.

How could it be...

Was she hallucinating because she didn’t sleep well last night?

She... she actually saw Mo Shixiu standing in front of her and smiling at her?!!

She must be hallucinating.
