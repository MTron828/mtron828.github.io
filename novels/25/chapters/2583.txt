Chapter 2584: I Can Only Help Her

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Mm.” Mo Yesi said casually, “Then, let’s blacklist her.”

He didn’t want her to continue causing trouble in the future.

With just a few words, he had determined a person’s career, life, and future.

But this was a small matter to Mo Yesi.

If it wasn’t for Qiao Mianmian, how could a small artiste like Little Xiao be qualified for him to waste his time on her?

“Yes, Chairman Mo,” Wei Zheng replied calmly. He wasn’t surprised by Mo Yesi’s decision. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Not to mention blacklisting a small artiste, Chairman Mo would never forgive anyone who offended Young Madam.

Even someone like Young Master Gong, who Chairman Mo knew since he was young. The Gong family was also rich and powerful. Chairman Mo fell out with them because of Young Madam.

So, that female artiste named Little Xiao was really stupid.

Since she was courting death, he could only fulfill her wish.

“Mo Yesi, I heard you say something about blacklisting someone. Did… Wei Zheng find out what happened?” Qiao Mianmian asked curiously as she saw Mo Yesi hang up.

“Mm, Wei Zheng found out that it was a female artiste named Little Xiao’s doing. Do you know this person?” Mo Yesi placed his cell phone back on the table.

“Little Xiao?” Qiao Mianmian was stunned for a while before nodding. “I know her. I’ve been on a variety show with her before. You’re saying that Little Xiao is behind this?”

Qiao Mianmian was a little surprised to hear that it was Little Xiao spreading rumors about her.

A long time ago, because of an endorsement, she and Little Xiao had some unhappiness.

But it was a misunderstanding.

She thought that it was fine now that the misunderstanding was over.

After all, when she and Little Xiao went on a variety show together, although their relationship couldn’t be said to be good, they had nothing against each other.

Little Xiao didn’t show any dissatisfaction towards her.

Hence, Qiao Mianmian never expected that it would be her.

“But why would she do that?”

Was it because of the misunderstanding from before? Was she still holding a grudge?

But it had been so long.

Why did she only do this now?

“It’s one of the reasons. She was one of the finalists. Between you and her, the judges chose you.

“Maybe she felt indignant that you snatched her spot.

“That’s why she got someone to spread rumors on Weibo that you were shortlisted because of the Mo and Bai families’ power.”

Qiao Mianmian kept quiet for a while.

Then, she said, “Perhaps she really thinks that I used my connections to snatch her spot. That’s why she was indignant and found someone to defame me on Weibo. The person you blacklisted just now… Is it Little Xiao?”

“Mm, for her to do such a thing, it means that she’s already unhappy and jealous of you. This won’t be the last time. She’ll do it again when she has the chance.

“Blacklisting her and making her disappear from the entertainment industry is the safest option for you.” Mo Yesi’s voice was very calm when he spoke about this, and his eyes were a little cold.. The coldness in his eyes made him seem a little unfamiliar.
