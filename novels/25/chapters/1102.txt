Chapter 1103: Even If That Person Is You, You Can’t

Mo Yesi was expressionless. “So what if she wants my money? It’s not like I don’t have the money to give her. Whether you agree to us being together or not, we’re already together. Mom, I respect you. That’s why I’ve been trying to make you accept Mianmian. That’s why after you’ve shown that you despise her time and time again, you still tried to change your impression of her.

“But it looks like I’ve made a mistake.”

Madam Mo’s expression changed. “What do you mean?”

Mo Yesi’s eyes were filled with disappointment. “I won’t do that again in the future. Whether you can accept Mianmian or not, it doesn’t matter. If you don’t like her, I’ll let you two meet less in the future, or even not meet.

“It doesn’t matter if your impression of her is good or not. Anyway, I’ll be the one living with her in the future, not you. As long as I like my wife, I won’t force anyone else to like her.”

After saying this, he turned around and walked towards the dining room without waiting for Madam Mo’s reaction.

He stopped after taking two steps.

He turned his head and looked at Madam Mo’s ashen face. Pursing his lips, he said indifferently, “If you want to eat upstairs, then do as you wish. Mom, there’s actually no need for you to do this with me. I really don’t care.

“Don’t be angry, feeling that you’ve given birth to an unfilial son. If Dad hadn’t protected and pampered you back then, I’m afraid your life wouldn’t have been so smooth. You enjoyed Dad’s love and care, and you’re proud to have a good husband who dotes on you. I’m sure you can understand my feelings for Mianmian.

“Right now, I only want to pamper and love her. I want to take good care of her for the rest of her life. No one can make her suffer.” He paused, looked at Madam Mo, and said word by word, “Even if that person is you, you can’t.

“If you insist on finding trouble with Mianmian, then don’t blame me for being unfilial.

“If you don’t respect the people I care about, I won’t respect you anymore.”

His words angered Madam Mo so much that her face turned crooked.

“Are you challenging your mother for that woman?” Madam Mo was so angry that her voice was trembling.

Mo Yesi said calmly, “That woman is my wife and your daughter-in-law. Mom, it doesn’t matter if you don’t like her. As long as you two can live in harmony, I won’t force you to like her. But, I won’t allow anyone to hurt her.

“If you really care about our mother-son relationship, don’t force me to do those bad things.”

With that, he left. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Madam Mo’s face was ashen as she stood in the living room and listened to the laughter coming from the dining room. She gritted her teeth in hatred.

She wouldn’t let Qiao Mianmian stay in the Mo family.

Never!

...

When Mo Yesi arrived at the dining room, the servants had already served dinner.

The Old Madam was chatting happily with Qiao Mianmian and her brother. Qiao Chen, who had been feeling uneasy earlier, was much more relaxed now. He didn’t know what he had said to the Old Madam, but she was laughing so hard that tears were streaming down her face.

“What are you talking about? Why are you so happy?”

Mo Yesi walked over to Qiao Mianmian, and the servant immediately pulled the chair out.

After he sat down, he reached out to hold Qiao Mianmian’s hand. “I was still outside and heard Grandma’s laughter.”

On the Old Madam’s left was Qiao Mianmian, and on her right was Qiao Chen.
