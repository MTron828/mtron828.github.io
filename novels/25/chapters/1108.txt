Chapter 1109: When Have I Been So Fierce by the Old Madam?

“If Rourou married our Ah Si, there wouldn’t be so many things happening. Don’t you think so?

“But it’s not too late now. I’ve asked Rourou about it. She’s deeply in love with Ah Si and said that she’s willing to wait for him. So, I thought that as long as you’re willing to persuade Ah Si, he can divorce Qiao Mianmian.

“Ah Si listens to you the most. Your advice is the most effective.”

The old lady had been silent the whole time. When she heard this, she looked up at Madam Mo. “You want me to persuade Ah Si to divorce?”

“Yes.” Madam Mo nodded expectantly. “Mom, you’re the only one who can persuade Ah Si. He respects you the most and is the most filial to you. He’ll definitely listen to you. You treasure him the most too. You definitely don’t want your precious grandson to be ruined by that snobbish woman.”

The old lady did not speak and only looked at her with a gloomy face.

Madam Mo originally thought that the Old Madam had been persuaded by her and stood on her side.

But when she met the old lady’s angry eyes, she was suddenly not so sure.

That feeling of fear surged up again.

She swallowed and felt a little guilty. “Mom, you...”

“Bastard!” The Old Madam grabbed a pillow and threw it at her.

The pillow hit Madam Mo.

The Old Madam had used quite a bit of force, but she had only thrown a pillow, so she couldn’t have hurt Madam Mo.

But maids were standing in the living room.

The Old Madam did not give Madam Mo any face at all in front of them.

Madam Mo was stunned for a few seconds. When she regained her senses, she felt completely humiliated.

Her eyes widened in disbelief.

It was as if she didn’t believe that the Old Madam would treat her like this.

Although Old Madam had never been close to her, she had never done anything that would embarrass her.

She was the mistress of the Mo Family.

Now that so many people had seen her mother-in-law teaching her a lesson, how was she going to establish her authority in the Mo Family in the future?

The old lady did not care whether she had lost face or not. After throwing a pillow, she still felt that it was not enough to vent her anger. She picked up the walking stick at the side and pointed it at her, saying, “You actually did such a disgraceful thing behind my back. You actually have the face to tell me. Shangguan Wenpei, are you crazy?

“Do you know what your son is like? Do you want him to be a bachelor for the rest of his life?”

Madam Mo had never been so fierce to the Old Madam.

She turned pale with fright. “Mom, no, I...”

“Your son has a strange illness and is allergic to women. He was supposed to die alone! God took pity on him and arranged for Mianmian to be with him, saving him from the tragic ending of being alone for the rest of his life. Now, not only did you not treat this hard-won daughter-in-law well, you even threatened her and Ah Si to divorce!”

The Old Madam was so angry that her heart hurt. Her hands shook as she held her walking stick. “If Mianmian really divorces Ah Si because of you, you’ll be the sinner of the Mo family!”

Madam Mo was so frightened that she didn’t even dare to speak.

She had never seen the Old Madam so angry, much less been scolded by her so angrily.

“But, but she wants all our shares...

“And that Qiao Chen...”

“Shut up!” The Old Madam was furious. “Anyone who isn’t a fool would know that she just said that out of anger. You actually took it seriously. Shangguan Wenpei, this is my last warning to you. You’re not allowed to interfere in Ah Si and Mianmian’s marriage matters anymore!”
