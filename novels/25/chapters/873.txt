Chapter 874: Don’t Worry, It’s Just a Match

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Tu Yilei hesitated for a while before smiling and saying, “I just wanted to ask if you have the time. I have a scene to rehearse with you.”

Qiao Mianmian was stunned. “Scene?”

“Mm.” Tu Yilei’s eyes flickered, and he looked a little unnatural. “Of course, it’s fine if you don’t have the time.”

Qiao Mianmian hesitated.

Ever since she decided to keep a distance from Tu Yilei, she didn’t interact much with him in private.

In fact, if it wasn’t for the crazy actions of his fans, and if she didn’t feel that he might have feelings for her, Qiao Mianmian wouldn’t have wanted to keep a distance from him.

Based on his character alone, Tu Yilei had a good character.

Qiao Mianmian found it rather pleasant to work with him.

She was willing to be friends with such a person.

But...

The thought of Tu Yilei’s crazy girlfriend fans and wife fans scared her.

Now that Tu Yilei said that he wanted to rehearse with her, this was considered a work matter.

If she rejected him, wouldn’t it be too obvious? Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

No matter what, Tu Yilei didn’t offend her.

It didn’t seem right for her to distance herself from him.

After a moment of hesitation, Qiao Mianmian nodded. “Alright, then.”

Tu Yilei looked up at her and seemed a little surprised. “You’re willing?”

Qiao Mianmian had been alienating him.

Besides some interaction when they were filming, they were worse than strangers in private.

He’d only made this request out of impulse.

He never expected her to agree.

He was prepared to be rejected by her.

“Senior Tu, it’s just a scene, right?” Qiao Mianmian hesitated for a while before saying, “Can we do it outside? I’m afraid that someone will secretly take photos of us.”

“Alright.”

Tu Yilei was in a much better mood. When he smiled, it was as if stars were falling into his eyes. “Don’t worry, it’s just a scene. Since you’re worried that someone will secretly take photos, we’ll do it outside.”

“Alright, then. May I know which scene Senior Tu wants to rehearse with me?”

It was common for actors to act against each other before filming.

Hence, Qiao Mianmian wasn’t too worried about someone taking photos of them.

Anyway, they were rehearsing outside, and it was a work matter. Even if someone took photos of them, there was nothing to be afraid of.

No matter how crazy his female fans were, they couldn’t possibly deny his normal job.

Qiao Mianmian had only considered Tu Yilei’s fans and had completely forgotten that she had a jealous lover at home.

As a result, when she and Tu Yilei had a scandal, Tu Yilei’s fans didn’t explode. Instead, a certain jealous lover exploded.

Qiao Mianmian took a long time to coax him.

Tu Yilei and Qiao Mianmian were filming a scene today. Qiao Mianmian had already seen it a few times last night and was familiar with the plot and lines.

The two of them took a look at the script and started to rehearse.

Tu Yilei looked like an idol. He looked like a male artiste who depended on his looks.

But in fact, not only was he good-looking, but he was also very powerful.

Qiao Mianmian had acted with him before and had a certain understanding of his capability.

It was actually a form of enjoyment to act with someone as capable as Tu Yilei. Moreover, she could learn a lot from him.
