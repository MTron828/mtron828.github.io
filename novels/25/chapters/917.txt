“I made a table full of dishes, there must be something you like.”

“This...”

“Miss Jiang, is there anything urgent?”

“... No.”

“Then, don’t be in a hurry to leave.” Sister Lin pulled her up. “It’s not too late to leave after dinner. I made so many dishes because I thought Miss Jiang would definitely stay for dinner. If you leave, Mister won’t be able to finish all the dishes on the table alone.”

Sister Lin’s enthusiasm was overwhelming.

Behind her, Mo Shixiu looked at her with a smile and stood up slowly. “Miss Jiang, let’s have dinner before you leave. Sister Lin’s culinary skills are very good. She cooked a few of her best dishes. You must try them.”

“Yes, Miss Jiang. Stay for dinner.”

Jiang Luoli said, “... Alright, then.”

She couldn’t reject their invitation.𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Moreover... she didn’t want to reject him.

It was her dream to have dinner with her Prince Charming.

But she probably wasn’t in the mood for this meal.

She was already staring at him while eating with her Prince Charming, how could she have the mood to eat?

Seeing that she had agreed, Sister Lin happily dragged her to the dining room.

Mo Shixiu usually didn’t have many visitors.

Not to mention female ones.

Only Madam Mo had been here a few times.

Hence, Sister Lin was especially happy to see Jiang Luoli and wanted her to stay longer.

As for Mo Shixiu.

He followed behind them. He was a little dazed as he watched the two of them being so intimate.

His place was usually empty.

Although the house was huge, there were many people.

Because of his personality and work, everyone treated him with respect. He could tell that they were nervous and even a little afraid of him.

Hence, laughter was practically non-existent.

But now...

As if because of someone’s arrival, the originally quiet place became a lot livelier.

He used to dislike noise.

Hence, he had to keep it quiet for 24 hours.

But now...

He didn’t find it noisy at all when he heard the girl’s laughter. In fact, he found it pleasant.

It somehow made him feel more relaxed.

...

Qiao Mianmian lay in bed and chatted with Jiang Luoli for a while before sending Qiao Chen a WeChat message to ask about how he was.

The siblings chatted for a while, and when they were done with their daily questions, Qiao Chen said that he was about to go for self-study and sent her a voice message.

Qiao Mianmian clicked on it and heard that Qiao Chen said he would visit her in F City this weekend.

Just as she was about to finish listening to the voice recording, Qiao Mianmian heard a girl’s voice calling Qiao Chen’s name.

Qiao Mianmian’s expression changed slightly.

If she didn’t hear wrongly, that girl should be Shen Xin.

Were Qiao Chen and Shen Xin still in contact?

Qiao Mianmian wanted to call him to ask, but she held back when she recalled that he was about to start self-study.

Forget it.

Qiao Chen had been sensible since he was a child. He wouldn’t do anything to make her worry.

He should be able to settle things with Shen Xin.

She didn’t have to worry too much.

Mo Yesi had been in the kitchen for more than half an hour.
