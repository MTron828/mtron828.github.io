Chapter 505: It Was Finally Over

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Mo Yesi flipped over and pulled her in. He then kissed her on her sweaty forehead and asked, “Baby, are you alright? Are you happy with my performance this time?”

It was finally over. Seeing how tired she looked and how motionless she was in his arms, Mo Yesi couldn’t help but feel smug.

He surely satisfied her this time.

He could feel it.

Qiao Mianmian slowly got back to her senses. As she recalled the madness that took place just now, she blushed and buried her head in his chest.

Ahhh, it was so shameful.

She was so against it initially, but it got less painful as they got on with it.

She couldn’t deny that the person who grabbed Mo Yesi’s arm tightly and who took the initiative to cooperate with him was none other than her.

Seeing how embarrassed she seemed, Mo Yesi chuckled and placed a hand on her head. “You’re not denying it. I assume I impressed you?”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

She got even redder.

Mo Yesi was so annoying.

Why did he have to make her say it?

Didn’t he know that she was easily embarrassed?

Moreover, couldn’t he tell whether she was satisfied or not?

Did he really have to ask!

Her silence made him chuckle even more. The man looked down at the red marks on her fair skin and said, “Baby, I want to do it again.”

He could never have enough of her.

The little woman in his arms seemed startled. She looked up with wide eyes and said, “No!”

Mo Yesi asked, “Why not? Didn’t you enjoy it a lot?”

Qiao Mianmian looked away and said coquettishly, “Mo Yesi, I’m tired. I’m so sleepy, let me rest.”

What she did not know was that the way she spoke so adorably did not make the man change his mind. If anything, Mo Yesi wanted her even more now.

He looked at her for a few moments and then kissed her on the lips. “Alright. I’ll try to speed up, then.” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

After the second round was over, Qiao Mianmian was completely exhausted.

Mo Yesi carried her to the bathroom to shower and then carried her back to the bed.

Her clothes were so crumpled, and her skirt had a tear in it now.

Mo Yesi wondered if he’d gone overboard today. She’d cried and begged him, but he still wanted her so roughly.

She was so petite and fragile.

It must’ve tired her so badly to make her do this three times in less than half a day.

He stroked her cheek gently and covered her with a blanket. “Baby, rest here for a while. I’ll get Wei Zheng to get you a new set of clothes.”

Qiao Mianmian’s eyes were swollen from crying and begging, but still, he never stopped.

In fact, the harder she cried, the harder he went.

She had intended to ignore him out of anger. But when she heard that he wanted to get Wei Zheng to get her new clothes, she immediately blushed and said, “Don’t...”
