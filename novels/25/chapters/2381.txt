Chapter 2382: No One Wanted Her

“Who knows? I heard that rich families are messy. It’s not surprising that she likes this one today and that one tomorrow. Moreover, she likes Mo Yesi, but doesn’t he already have a fiancée now? What hope does she have? She probably thinks that she has no hope of marrying Mo Yesi, so she targeted Gong Zeli. Speaking of which, Gong Zeli is also very eligible. The only son of the Gong family is very handsome. It’s a good choice to marry him.”

“Young Master Gong is not bad. Although he has some sort of anger disorder and it’s rather scary when his illness relapses, it can’t stop the ladies in Yuncheng City from wanting to marry him and become Young Madam Gong. Those who say they don’t want to marry him are just sour grapes.”

“But I don’t think Young Master Gong is interested in her. She’s already fallen so badly, and he didn’t even help her up. Sigh, I suddenly feel that Shen Rou is a little pitiful. In the past, she was said to be unreachable, but now, Second Young Master Mo and Young Master Gong don’t want her. So what if she took over the Shen Corporation? No matter how glorious she looks, she’s still a pitiful worm that nobody wants.”

“It’s all because of her. I heard that Young Master Gong used to treat her really well and really like her. But back then, she only had eyes for Second Young Master Mo and didn’t even look at him. Now that she wants to go back, he isn’t happy. What qualifications does she have to make Young Master Gong wait for her?”

“That’s true. But still, Young Master Gong is pretty heartless. He really didn’t help her. With so many people watching, she must have lost face.”

People looked at Shen Rou with sympathy, gloating, and lamentation. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

The Young Lady of the Shen family had never been in such a sorry state.

She was always the most eye-catching one.

Countless men had a crush on her.

But people were realistic.

Ever since the Shen family fell into trouble, the once unreachable goddess fell from her pedestal and became a joke.

Even though the Shen family survived and Shen Rou seemed to be doing well again, Qiao Mianmian appeared.

She was crushed by Qiao Mianmian in every aspect.

The glory of the past could never be restored.

Especially when the man she’d liked for so many years had become Qiao Mianmian’s henchman.

She was already a failure in their eyes.

Now that she was crying pitifully on the ground and begging Gong Zeli to stay, while Gong Zeli didn’t even stop in his tracks, everyone felt even more pity for her.

But there was also a hint of gloating in their sympathy.

Especially the women.

Women had always been mean to other women.

Some of the men they used to like were Shen Rou’s followers. They were naturally happy to see her suffer.

So what if she was Young Lady Shen?

No one wanted her.

Shen Rou watched as Gong Zeli walked further and further away with no intention of stopping. Her originally pale face turned even paler. The bright lights shone on her ghastly pale face, making it look rather scary.
