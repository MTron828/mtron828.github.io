Chapter 117: It’s My Fault, I Shouldn’t Be Suspicious

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

She just stared at him that way, without saying a word.

Teardrops rolled down her thick, long eyelashes, and in a blink of an eye, they fell down onto her delicate and lovely face.

Mo Yesi never felt anything towards a woman’s tears.

He would even feel annoyed.

If someone tried to win his pity with tears, it would only be counterproductive.

Even Yan Shaoqing had said numerous times that his heart was made of stone, too cold and too hard.

No woman could warm it.

But at this moment, Mo Yesi felt that he was not immune to women’s tears.

Looking at the girl with red eyes in his arms and a face of grievance and accusation, he felt a bit distressed.

Almost without any hesitation, he apologized. “You cried? Is it because you think I suspected you? Baby, I’m sorry, I take back all I just said. Just treat it as I said nothing. Don’t be angry at me, okay?”

Mo Yesi never knew what it was like to panic.

But when Qiao Mianmian’s tears fell silently out of her eyes, he felt it for the first time.

His slender fingers awkwardly wiped the tears from the corners of her eyes, and as his fingertips touched her warm and wet tears, another wave of confusion and irritability filled his heart.

When he did not apologize it was fine. However, as soon as he apologized, the woman in his arms started crying even more severely.

Tears kept spilling out of her eyes, down her face.

The warm teardrops hit the back of his hand, burning his heart.

“Qiao Mianmian, don’t cry anymore.” After failing to coax the woman in his arms, Mo Yesi frowned, but sighed regretfully, holding her little face. With furrowed brows, he asked, “Tell me, what should I do so that you won’t stay mad at me?”

“I didn’t really doubt you. I believe you will not do anything to betray me.” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Qiao Mianmian looked at him with tears in her eyes. The more the man whispered, the more wronged she felt.

Her gaze was full of complaints, and her voice was hoarse from crying. She choked with sobs. “You did doubt me! What do you mean by that sentence, didn’t you imply that Su Ze and I arranged to meet there in advance?

“Mo Yesi, you know, I hate it when people do not believe me. If you think I still have an unforgettable love for Su Ze, then we might as well divorce. Since you don’t trust me anyway, why should we stay together?”

Hearing the word “divorce”, Mo Yesi’s face turned gloomy.

He was just about to get angry, but the crying red eyes of the girl in his arms instantly extinguished the anger in his heart.

His anger turned into a helpless and annoyed sigh.

If he knew she would cry like this, he would have never asked that question.

The man’s slender white fingers fell to the corner of her eyes again and wiped her moist eyes gently.

He reached out and gently circled her into his arms, letting out a soft and low sigh. “Okay, it’s my fault. I shouldn’t be suspicious.”

His confession was met with the girl’s complaint. “Of course it was your fault.”

“Yes, my fault.” At this moment, Mo Yesi did not know what to do except to coax her and agree with her.

He had no experience with coaxing women.

For the first time in his life, he was coaxing a woman so gently and he was still not doing a great job.

He felt deeply frustrated.
