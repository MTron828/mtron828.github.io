Chapter 3006: Afraid He’d Touch It

They left the hospital.

Mo Yesi held Qiao Mianmian carefully the whole time. He even looked nervous when she went down the stairs.

Qiao Mianmian was amused. “You’re exaggerating. Don’t hold me. I’ll be fine walking normally.”

Mo Yesi wrapped his arm around her waist and said seriously, “It’s not an exaggeration. The first three months of pregnancy are the most important, and it’s also the most dangerous period. I have to watch over you.”

Qiao Mianmian felt the same as usual.

Especially when the baby was less than two months old.

Looking at the nervous man beside her and feeling sweet inside, she said exaggeratedly, “In that case, shouldn’t I stay at home for the first three months?”

“In theory.” Mo Yesi thought for a while and smiled. “But if you want to go out, you need someone to accompany you. It’s best if I accompany you. I’m worried about others accompanying you.”

Qiao Mianmian recalled that MO Shixiu seemed very strict with Jiang Luoli in the first three months.

It wasn’t easy for her to go out.

Thankfully, she was a homebody. She usually stayed at home, so it wasn’t a problem for her to go out occasionally.

In the car.

MO Yesi carefully buckled her seatbelt. He was much gentler than usual, especially when he touched her belly.

It was as if he was afraid that if he used a little more force, something bad would happen.

Qiao Mianmian smiled.

She didn’t care much about it, but MO Yesi was really nervous.

He was afraid that he would bump into it.

Not only that, even the return trip was much slower than usual.

It took them 40 minutes to get to the hospital, but it took more than an hour to get home.

Back at Lu Shan Courtyard.

As Qiao Mianmian was getting changed, she heard MO Yesi calling Old Madam. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Grandma, Mianmian is pregnant.

“I just accompanied her to the hospital. The doctor said that the baby is almost two months old and is very healthy.

“Mm, I know. I’ll be careful.

“You’re coming over now? Alright, don’t worry. Be careful on the road. Drive slowly.”

After a while, MO Yesi hung up.

He turned around and saw Qiao Mianmian looking at him.

She was wearing pajamas with cartoon prints on them. The hat had two rabbit ears, and her hair was tied up in a bun. Her porcelain-white face had exquisite and small facial features. She was going to be a mother, but she still looked like a young girl.

No one would doubt that she was 18.

MO Yesi felt a little pressured as her husband.

He was afraid that others would say that he was an old cow eating young grass.

“You called Grandma?” Qiao Mianmian walked towards him.

MO Yesi reached out and pulled her into his arms.

“Mm, it’s such an important matter. Of course, we have to let them know. Grandma was so happy, she said she’d come to see you now.” MO Yesi lowered his head and smelled the faint fragrance in her hair. At this moment, he was especially satisfied.

He had everything he wanted now.

He had no regrets in life.

“Grandma is coming over now?” Qiao Mianmian thought about how Old Madam’s legs made it inconvenient for her to walk and frowned slightly. “Her legs aren’t good, it’s so troublesome to come over. We should go to the old residence instead.”.
