Chapter 2136: Use This Pen to Answer the Questions

The next day, Qiao Mianmian accompanied Qiao Chen to the college entrance examination.

When they were about to enter the examination hall.

Qiao Mianmian was even more nervous than Qiao Chen. She held his hand and reminded him again and again, “Chen Chen, you have to check carefully after answering the question. Don’t answer wrongly. You have to check the multiple-choice questions a few more times, too. Don’t mark the wrong choice. Also…”

“Sister, I got it.” Qiao Chen was amused and helpless. “I’ll definitely take the exam seriously and won’t make those low-level mistakes. Don’t worry, I know what to do.”

Qiao Chen’s results were outstanding, and he had confidence in entering the school he chose.

According to his results, he could have been admitted to a key university.

But he didn’t want to.

Because that person was entering another university.

“Alright.” Qiao Mianmian felt that she was nagging like a mother. If Qiao Chen couldn’t reassure her, she probably wouldn’t be able to rest assured.

Her brother’s grades were the least of her worries.

“Anyway, do your best.” Qiao Mianmian didn’t know what to say.

She could understand the parents’ exaggerated behavior on the day of their children’s college entrance examination.

Like all sorts of car escorts.

For example, wearing clothes with the words “Pass every test” and “Golden List”.

She would have done it if it wasn’t for Qiao Chen’s persuasion against it! Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

She was still nervous even though she was confident in him.

Because this day was too important to every candidate.

“Mm, Sis, I’ll go in off now.”

“Wait.”

Qiao Mianmian stopped him when he was about to open the door.

“Chen Chen, take this.” Qiao Mianmian took out a pen from her bag and handed it to him. “Use this pen to answer the questions.”

Qiao Chen took it and saw that it was a beautiful fountain pen with a few diamonds on the cap.

“I got a master to add this to the pen before. This answer is absolutely safe.”

Qiao Chen was speechless.

Seeing how serious Qiao Mianmian looked, he couldn’t help but laugh.

Qiao Chen smiled and shook his head in disbelief. “Sister, when did you become so superstitious? Weren’t you skeptical about such things?”

“Don’t bother about it.” Qiao Mianmian glared at him. “Just use it if I tell you to. I spent a lot of money getting the Master to bless it, don’t waste it.”

“Alright, I’ll use it.” Qiao Chen’s eyes were filled with affection. He would agree to anything his sister requested. “I’ll use this pen to answer the questions.”

“Alright, alright. Go in.” Qiao Mianmian didn’t want to waste his time and waved at him. “Enter the examination hall early and adjust your mentality. Don’t be too nervous. Just treat it as your usual mock examination and relax.”

“Mm. I’ll get going, then.”

“Go on, go on. Your brother-in-law and I will take you to eat after the exams.”

Qiao Chen got out of the car quickly.

Qiao Mianmian’s cell phone rang at this moment.

She immediately picked it up.

“Has Chen Chen entered the examination hall?” Mo Yesi asked.

He’d intended to come together with them, but something came up at work.
