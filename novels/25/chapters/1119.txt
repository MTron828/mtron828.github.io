Chapter 1120: She Terminated Her Contract Once Something Happened in the Su Corporation

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

It was too late now.

All he could do was help her with her career.

However, this was not the outcome he wanted.

He wanted to use the remaining time in his life to make it up to her.

“Qiao Mianmian.” Gong Zeli stared out the window for a long time before smiling bitterly and retracting his gaze. He muttered to himself, “Why didn’t you tell me that you saved me? Was it because you were disappointed with my performance that time? That’s why you pretended not to know me. At that time, did you regret saving someone as lousy as me that night?

“But if you had told me sooner that you were the girl from that night, why would I have done that to you?

“It’s been ten years, a whole ten years. In these ten years, you often appear in my dreams. Actually, every time I wake up from my dreams, I would feel confused and wonder why I couldn’t find that feeling from Shen Rou that night.

“She told me that she was the one who saved me. I clearly felt that something was wrong, yet I still believed her. For the past ten years, I firmly believed that she was my savior.

“Why was I so stupid?

“I never suspected she was lying to me.”

As he spoke, he laughed self-deprecating. “That’s why I deserve to be deceived by her for ten years. For ten whole years, I didn’t realize that I was deceived. If she dared to lie to someone like me, who wouldn’t she lie to?

“Qiao Mianmian, do I really have to give up on you? But I really don’t want to.

“Why did you have to marry Mo Yesi? I’ve never won a fight with him before.”

What else could he do?

So what if he was indignant?

Even if Qiao Mianmian wasn’t married yet, could he win against Mo Yesi? Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Qiao Mianmian scrolled through Weibo and found two popular posts.

One was about Su Ze.

The other was about Qiao Anxin.

On the official Weibo account of the financial news, news about the Su Corporation suffering a huge blow overnight and its stock prices falling could be seen.

At the same time, Qiao Anxin finally updated her Weibo.

It was a Weibo post about her contract termination with Starlight.

Qiao Anxin V: I’ve already peacefully terminated my contract with Starlight. I won’t be an artiste under Starlight anymore. I hope everyone will be well in the future. I’ve made the fans worry during this period. I’m fine.

Qiao Anxin’s post quickly became a hot topic.

Because it was posted around the same time as the post about the Su Corporation being severely damaged, many people speculated whether the reason she terminated her contract with Starlight Entertainment was that the Su Corporation was badly damaged.

Otherwise, the timing was too coincidental.

She wouldn’t terminate the contract abruptly. She would terminate the contract once the Su Corporation had a problem.

Many passers-by commented on her Weibo post that she was too realistic.

Although it was cold when people were gone, there were many cases of adding insult to injury.

But she shouldn’t have posted the termination of her contract at this time.

She seemed too eager, too heartless.

No matter what, she had been single-handedly supported by Starlight.

Not only did she not help her boss when he was in trouble, she even broke off her contract with Starlight.

Such a way of doing things was truly chilling.

Qiao Anxin’s fans still supported her as usual. They argued that her Anxin definitely didn’t terminate the contract because the Su Corporation was badly damaged. There must be many unknown reasons.
