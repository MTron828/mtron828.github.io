Chapter 2193: But Why Was It Qiao Mianmian?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Gong Zeli frowned. “You were eavesdropping?”

Shen Rou lied calmly. “I just happened to pass by and accidentally heard it. I didn’t expect to hear your big secret. Gong Zeli, you like Qiao Mianmian because she saved you?

“You fell for her because she saved your life? Just like how you fell for me when you thought I saved you? Gong Zeli, do you really like her? Do you like whoever saves you?

“Can you tell the difference between liking and being grateful to someone?”

Although Shen Rou had already guessed that Qiao Mianmian was the one who saved Gong Zeli that night, she was still shocked when she heard Gong Zeli say it.

She was furious.

She felt that anyone could save Gong Zeli, and she wouldn’t be so angry.

But why Qiao Mianmian?

Why was it Qiao Mianmian?!

She knew how much Gong Zeli cared about what happened that night. He took care of her all those years because he thought she saved him.

If Qiao Mianmian really saved Gong Zeli, he would really remember this favor for the rest of his life.

Gong Zeli’s expression darkened. “It has nothing to do with you. I don’t care what you heard. Remember, if you dare to hurt her, I won’t let you off.”

“Is that so?” Shen Rou chuckled, but there was no smile in her eyes. They were filled with hatred and anger. “Gong Zeli, do you remember how you used to warn others like this for me?

“Back then, you said this to others too. If anyone dares to hurt me, you’ll definitely make them pay. But now…” She smiled mockingly. “Now, you’re warning me like this for another woman?

“I only know now that you’re such a heartless person. Your liking can be maintained for a long time, or you can disappear anytime. Gong Zeli, are you sure you really like Qiao Mianmian?”

Shen Rou was so jealous that she lost her rationality. She didn’t seem to notice Gong Zeli’s increasingly awful expression and continued sarcastically, “I don’t think you really like her. It’s just that she saved you, so you think you like her.

“If she wasn’t the person who saved you that night, would you still have feelings for her? No way. If she wasn’t your savior, you wouldn’t even look at her. But now, you’re so concerned about her, and you’re even so humble in front of her. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“Ha! Gong Zeli, since when have you been so humble in front of others? You do care about Qiao Mianmian, but does she take you seriously? I think she despises you. You’re the Young Master of the Gong family, the only heir of the Gong Corporation. Do you have to be so shameless to pester a woman?”

Shen Rou was jealous.

She’d never seen Gong Zeli so humble.

His humble attitude in front of Qiao Mianmian triggered her deeply.

Gong Zeli’s expression darkened and his eyes became cold.
