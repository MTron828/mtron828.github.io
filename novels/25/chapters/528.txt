Chapter 529: Why Did He Always Have to Deal With This

His life would be tough if he really had to keep his promise to her.

He could agree to anything, but not touching her... was impossible.

“Alright, you don’t have to bother about me now.” Qiao Mianmian knew he was still busy at work and showed understanding. “Get on with your work, you don’t have to massage me anymore.”

She rested her hand on his.

She did feel a lot better after the massage.

He heard a knock on the door.

Followed by Wei Zheng’s voice calling, “Chairman Mo.”

“Come in.”

Mo Yesi was combing through Qiao Mianmian’s long hair with his fingers and held her hand with his free hand.

That was what Wei Zheng saw when he entered.

His Chairman Mo, who had always put all his time and energy into working, wasn’t at the desk, busy at work, as he expected.

He was actually sitting on the couch with Young Madam in his arms.

Wei Zheng even saw Chairman Mo kiss Young Madam the very moment he entered.

Young Madam was probably shy as she pushed him away while blushing.T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Chairman Mo grabbed her hand and kissed its back.

Wei Zheng was left speechless.

Why did he always have to deal with this?

Didn’t they know that he was still single? Couldn’t they spare a thought for him?

Qiao Mianmian did feel that it was embarrassing to be acting like this before Wei Zheng.

That was why she pushed Mo Yesi away.

But the man did not let her leave. He tightened his arm around her waist and pulled her in.

“What is it?” Mo Yesi turned to look at Wei Zheng a little unfriendly.

His face seemed to say: If I find that this isn’t anything important, you’re dead.

Wei Zheng felt a chill as he met his gaze and quickly said, “Chairman Mo, Chairman Zhang from Sheng Yue is here. He’s waiting for you in the meeting room.”

“Chairman Zhang?” Mo Yesi raised a brow and nodded. “Alright, I got it. Get someone to attend to him first, I’ll be right over.”

“Yes.”

Wei Zheng immediately left once he’d relayed the message.

After all, he had to save his life.

Mo Yesi looked at the girl on his lap and said tenderly, “Baby, I’ve got to leave for a while. Wait here for me. When I’m back, we’ll go and have lunch, mm?”

“Mm, go on.” Qiao Mianmian nodded.

She didn’t dare to be in the way of his work. After all, for men like Mo Yesi, time really was money. She couldn’t afford to take away too much of his time.

Mo Yesi loved how sweet and obedient she looked. He felt something catch in his throat and couldn’t help but give her a deep, fiery kiss.

About 10 whole minutes had passed by the time he actually left the office.

He looked extremely satisfied.

Meanwhile, Qiao Mianmian was left panting on the couch.

...

The lunch reservation was in a nice place. It was romantic and very suitable for dates.

As Qiao Mianmian still had to return to school to apply for leave after that, Mo Yesi got Uncle Li to drive her.

When she was reaching school, Qiao Mianmian saw the pharmacy across the road. She suddenly recalled something.

She got Uncle Li to park by the roadside.

Mo Yesi furrowed his brows slightly as he looked out the window. “Why are we stopping here? We haven’t reached your school, right?”
