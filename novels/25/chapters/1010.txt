Chapter 1011: She Really Dotes on You

Especially Prince Charming’s mother.

It was said that in-laws weren’t easy to get along with, but in-laws were even harder to get along with.

Qiao Mianmian’s smile stiffened.

Jiang Luoli immediately knew what was going on. She furrowed her brows and asked, “Prince Charming’s mother isn’t easy to get along with?”

“No.”

Qiao Mianmian didn’t want Jiang Luoli to know about her worries, so she lied. “I’m not that easy to get along with, but it doesn’t upset me. Moreover, Mo Yesi and I don’t live with them. We only have time to have a meal and stay for a night.

“So, it’s alright.”

Qiao Mianmian felt upset when she thought of Madam Mo, but she smiled when she thought of Old Madam. “Old Madam is a nice person. She likes me a lot and treats me well. When I went to the Mo family for the first time, she gave me a gift.”

“Old Madam? Is she Prince Charming’s grandmother?”

“Yes, she’s a nice person. I think of my grandma whenever I see her.”

“I’m more concerned about how generous the gift Old Madam gave you is. Can you reveal it to your best friend?” Jiang Luoli was a little relieved to hear that Old Madam Mo liked Qiao Mianmian.

In a rich and powerful family, Old Madam’s status was like that of a matriarch.

She was really something.

With Old Madam Mo liking her Baby, there was nothing to worry about.

Even if Madam Mo didn’t like her Baby, with Old Madam protecting her, Madam Mo wouldn’t dare to go overboard.

Qiao Mianmian explained the gift that Old Madam gave her.

Jiang Luoli was stunned.

“Damn, she’s so generous.” She was about to drool from envy. “Then, wouldn’t you be a billionaire now? No wonder so many female celebrities are trying to marry into rich families. It turns out marrying into rich families is so enjoyable.

“A gift worth hundreds of millions.

“Old Madam is so generous. What gift did your mother-in-law give you?”

“A bangle.” Qiao Mianmian thought for a while and said, “It seems rather expensive, but it’s probably not as much as Old Madam gave.”

“I saw a jade bangle at an auction previously. The final transaction price was tens of millions. Your mother-in-law’s bangle must be at least tens of millions. But the Old Madam is really generous. Those properties are worth hundreds of millions.

“She really dotes on you.”

“Yes.” Qiao Mianmian nodded. “Old Madam is indeed very good to me. It’s just that I’ve had so many scandals recently, I’m worried that Old Madam will have something against me. I don’t want her to hate me.” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“I don’t think so. Old Madam must be a smart person. She wouldn’t easily believe those rumors.”

“She believes in me. I’m just afraid that she’ll be unhappy if I create scandals too often.”

Jiang Luoli kept quiet for a while before sighing. “This is also one of the reasons why rich and powerful families don’t like to marry female celebrities. Wealthy families all care about their pride. If they have a female artiste with scandals all the time, they’ll feel embarrassed.

“Baby, they didn’t say anything about you leaving the entertainment industry, right?”

Qiao Mianmian thought for a while and shook her head. “Not yet.”

“That’s good. No matter what, Prince Charming supports you. This is very rare.”
