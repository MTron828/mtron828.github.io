Chapter 453: She Just Didn’t Want to Care About Mo Yesi Now

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Jiang Luoli immediately directed her attention to the food.

As she bit down on the beef slice, it was so spicy that she started tearing.

But she immediately picked up another slice.

As she ate, she both complained and complimented on how spicy the food was.

“Oh right, Baby.” Jiang Luoli couldn’t handle the spice any further and started drinking water. After she was done, she looked at Qiao Mianmian and asked, “Prince Charming still hasn’t replied to you?”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

She was enjoying her dinner.

But the moment Jiang Luoli mentioned him, her mood was immediately affected.

Because Mo Yesi was indeed so childish that he didn’t reply to her at all.

Initially, Qiao Mianmian was still trying to find a reason to defend his behavior.

He could be busy working on something and didn’t have the time to check his phone.

Or he saw the message but didn’t have the time to reply to her.

But as he didn’t reply in close to two hours, Qiao Mianmian couldn’t find any reason to justify his behavior any further.

She was a hundred percent sure that Mo Yesi was intentional in not replying to her.

This childish guy decided to ignore her just because she didn’t agree to dinner.

This was the first time Mo Yesi treated Qiao Mianmian like this.

He was so accommodating to her every demand all this while that Qiao Mianmian forgot that he had a bad temper.

All along, as she was being spoilt by him, it wasn’t obvious to her.

Mo Yesi was really cold to those around him, except when it came to her.

Qiao Mianmian couldn’t take it.

She wasn’t used to being treated this way.

She felt wronged.

Really wronged.

She didn’t want to care about him anymore!

“Let’s not talk about him.” She said angrily, “I don’t care if he replies or not.”

Jiang Luoli was speechless.

Even though Qiao Mianmian said that she didn’t care. But she was so angry that she wasn’t even eating her favorite food.

How was she not caring?

She thought for a while and tried to talk some sense into her. “Didn’t you say that Prince Charming was easy to appease? Why don’t give him a call? Maybe he’s waiting for you to call him?”

“No,” Qiao Mianmian replied. “If he isn’t going to talk to me, I’m not talking to him as well.”

“What if he doesn’t look for you anymore? This would never happen, I’m just giving an example.”

“I won’t look for him anymore as well.” Qiao Mianmian bit on her lip and replied, “Why should I look for him when he doesn’t care about me anymore?”

Jiang Luoli was confused. “How does he not care about you?”

“If he cares about me, how can he bear to not talk to me?”

Jiang Luoli was amused by both of them and replied, “What if he also shares the same sentiment? Wouldn’t this cold war persist forever?”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

She didn’t know what to do.

But she just didn’t want to care about Mo Yesi right now.

...

At the same time, in a hospital.

Qiao Anxin was still in a state of unconsciousness as she laid in the hospital bed.

Outside of the ward.

Su Ze stared at the doctor in disbelief. His face was pale from the shock.

He asked, shocked, “What? She... had a miscarriage?”

“Yes,” the doctor replied. “Mr. Su, I’m sorry. We tried our best. But Miss Qiao arrived really late and the baby wasn’t fully developed. We couldn’t save the child.”

The doctor noticed Su Ze’s pale expression and continued thoughtfully, “Don’t be too upset Mr. Su. Miss Qiao is young, she won’t have any problem conceiving again.”Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎
