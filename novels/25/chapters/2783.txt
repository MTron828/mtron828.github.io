Chapter 2786: Why Is Doudou Acting So Strangely Today?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

The boy pushed her away and wailed. “I don’t want you to be my mommy. I want my own mommy. I don’t want to be here. I want to go home, I want to go home…”

Qiao Anxin didn’t expect the boy to push her away.

Even though he was only four years old, he almost pushed her to the ground.

Her expression changed.

Just as she was about to flare up, she suddenly recalled that it was a live stream. She could only suppress her anger.

But she was furious.

Damn it.

What kind of lousy child was this?

She was so upset by his crying that she wanted to stuff his mouth with something.

Li Wei didn’t expect the little boy to react this way. Seeing that he was crying so sadly, he quickly squatted down and comforted him. “Why is Doudou crying? No one bullied you. Before you came to the show, didn’t you promise Dad and Mom that you’d be good and not cry so easily?”

“Uncle Li, I want to go home.” The little boy was still crying.

Li Wei nodded. “Baby, you’re here to record a show. Uncle can only send you home after the show is done. Didn’t I tell you before you came? Didn’t you agree? Why do you want to go home now?

“Don’t be afraid.”

Li Wei pulled the boy out of his arms and pointed at Qiao Anxin. “This is your new mommy. You’ll live with her for the next half a month. She’ll take good care of you.”

“Yes, Doudou, come with Mommy, alright?” Qiao Anxin pretended to be gentle and reached out to touch the little boy’s head again, trying to regain her lost face. “Doudou, don’t be afraid. Mommy isn’t a bad person. Mommy will dote on you.”

Who knew?

Before her hand could touch the boy’s head, he quickly dodged it.

The little boy snuggled into Li Wei’s arms as if he was avoiding something scary. “No, I don’t want to. Uncle Li, I don’t want her to be my mother. I don’t want to go with her, I don’t want to!”

Qiao Anxin couldn’t maintain her smile anymore.

Even Li Wei felt a little awkward.

Although the other children had some problems, none of them argued like Doudou. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

And Doudou had always been obedient.

Why was he throwing a tantrum now?

But he was a child, after all. He could only coax him.

Li Wei asked patiently, “Doudou, aren’t you the most obedient? Tell Uncle Li, why don’t you want to go with your new mommy? Don’t you like her?”

The little boy glanced at Qiao Anxin and saw the darkness in her eyes. He buried his head in Li Wei’s arms again and resumed crying.

Li Wei felt a headache coming on.

He could still handle it If it was something else.

But he couldn’t do anything about it.

Why was Doudou acting so strangely today?

The netizens in the live stream couldn’t help but discuss.

“This Doudou is so difficult to deal with. I feel like Li Wei can’t handle it.”

“The other two children are very obedient.. Doudou isn’t the youngest, why is he so insensible? He’s so timid and doesn’t want to participate in the show, they shouldn’t have let him come.”
