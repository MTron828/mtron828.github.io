Chapter 2520: Finally Responded

She could deny that she’d lied to Gong Zeli.

He didn’t have any concrete evidence.

But Gong Zeli had already exposed her editing.

She couldn’t deny it.

Her mind was in a mess as she hurriedly called her assistant.

A while later, someone knocked on the door.

“Come in.” Shen Rou took a deep breath and looked up.

The door opened and the assistant walked in.

Seeing that Shen Rou’s expression wasn’t right, the assistant was stunned and quickly walked towards her. “Chairman Shen, what’s wrong? What happened?”

Shen Rou’s face was as pale as a ghost.

There was no color.

She looked flustered as if she had encountered something unsolvable. Seeing her assistant, she turned to him for help. “What should I do? What should I do now?”

The assistant was stunned again. “Chairman Shen, w-what do you mean?”

“He posted on Weibo again. I didn’t expect him to record it, either. Now everyone knows that my recording was edited. Th-they won’t believe me anymore. What should I do? I have to respond, but how should I respond?”

Shen Rou was a little incoherent.

But this time, the assistant understood.

“Chairman Shen, do you mean that Young Master Gong posted on Weibo? He recorded your conversation with him?”

“Yes, that’s right. Tell me, what should I do? I have to think of a way!”

The assistant frowned.

It was obvious that he found this difficult. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“You have to settle this for me.” Shen Rou’s tone suddenly turned fierce. “Otherwise, I’ll fire you!”

No matter what, she couldn’t lose!

She couldn’t lose!

The assistant’s expression changed when he heard that. He immediately lowered his head and said respectfully, “Yes, Chairman Shen. I’ll definitely settle this. I’ll go to the public relations department now and get everyone to think of a solution.”

Shen Rou waved him off.

But…

Before the public relations department could think of a solution, Weibo exploded again.

Qiao Mianmian finally responded.

First, it was a Weibo post by Huan Yu, the company Qiao Mianmian signed with.

The post was very long. It was first posted by Huan Yu’s official account, and then by Qiao Mianmian.

Besides refuting the rumors, Huan Yu also posted a lot of data.

Every statistic was solid evidence. It proved that Qiao Mianmian was framed from beginning to end, and the scandals online were all done by that person’s fake reviewers.

At the end of the post, she directly pointed out that person’s name.

Huan Yu Online: [Miss Shen Rou, I don’t know what feud you have with Qiao Mianmian for you to maliciously defame her on Weibo. Especially spreading rumors that she has an ambiguous relationship with another man. It can’t be said that it’s not vicious. Although the Shen family is big and powerful, I, Zhao, will definitely do my best to seek justice for my artistes. No matter what we have to pay for this lawsuit, no matter if we can win in the end, we’re determined!]

Qiao Mianmian V: [I’m sorry to make everyone wait for so long. I’m late because I had to gather some evidence. Please take a look at the Weibo post posted by the company’s official account. I have the same attitude as the company. I will definitely fight this lawsuit to the end. It’s because of me that Weibo is in a mess. I’m really sorry. I always believe that justice is in the hearts of people. Everyone should know what’s right and wrong after reading the post.]
