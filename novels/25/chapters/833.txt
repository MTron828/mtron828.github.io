Chapter 835: She Hated That Woman

Especially in the past 10 years, he had always given in to her requests. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

How could she not feel anything when such a person suddenly wanted to leave her world?

She would have feelings for even a pet.

Yes, that must be it.

After finding a reason for her heartache, the confusion in her eyes faded.

But her heart still hurt.

Why was Gong Zeli so heartless to her?

Just because he knew that she wasn’t the one who saved him that night, she felt like a stranger to him.

She had already given up all her dignity and pride to beg him.

But he still left.

He’d promised to treat her well for the rest of her life.

But everything changed overnight.

She had nothing left.

The man she loved deeply had to draw the line between them.

The man who loved her left her too.

It was as if they’d agreed to leave her.

Suddenly, she had nothing left.

She thought that no matter what, she still had Gong Zeli by her side.

No matter what happened, he would never leave her.

But she was wrong.

He liked her and treated her well because of someone else.

He didn’t like her because she was Shen Rou.

He liked the woman who saved him.

If she hadn’t lied to him, he would probably treat her like a normal friend.

She wouldn’t have so many privileges in front of him.

Shen Rou suddenly hated the woman who saved Gong Zeli.

It was because of that woman that she became a joke.

No, she didn’t know if the person that night was a man or a woman.

That was because when she reached the pool, all she saw was Gong Zeli.

Besides that, she didn’t see anyone else.

But she had a feeling that it was a girl who saved him that night.

Her sixth sense told her that it must be a girl.

Perhaps, she was a very pretty girl.

Had Gong Zeli really found her?

Was it because she was really a beautiful girl that made him fall in love with her at first sight? Was that why he was so cold to her and wanted to leave her?

Shen Rou couldn’t help but feel hatred.

She hated the woman she didn’t know.

It had been 10 years since that night.

She’d kept it a secret for the past 10 years, and Gong Zeli never suspected her.

She could have kept it a secret forever.

Why did that woman appear all of a sudden?

She took everything from her the moment she appeared.

If she knew who that woman was...

She would never let her off!

“Miss Shen, are you alright?”

A waiter passed by and saw Shen Rou on the floor. He was shocked and reached out to help her up.

“Get lost, don’t touch me.” Shen Rou glared at him.

The waiter was shocked by her look and quickly retracted his hand.

He then bowed and apologized profusely. “I’m sorry, Miss Shen.”

Although he wasn’t wrong.

But this was Young Lady Shen.

He couldn’t offend her.

If Young Lady Shen was unhappy, he could only apologize.

Shen Rou held the door and stood up slowly. She looked at the waiter coldly and said, “If you dare to tell anyone what you saw, I won’t let you off.”
