Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“He won’t wake up until late in the morning. Do you know why he can’t get a wife despite being in his forties? Because he’s lazy.

“This person has hands and feet. He can earn money just by going out to do something. Is he afraid that he won’t be able to save enough money for his wife? But he’s just a lazy bum. He wants to lie down and earn money every day. He won’t even go when others introduce jobs to him. Look at this yard. It’s even dirtier than my pigpen. Why did you come to such a person’s house?”

Qiao Mianmian opened her mouth and was about to say something when the villager turned around and said with a look of disdain, “Third Chen, you’re finally willing to come out. Tell me, aren’t you too lazy? You don’t even know how to tidy up when you have guests.”

Qiao Mianmian looked up and saw someone walking out slowly.

At first glance, she thought he was a tramp.

He was a dark-skinned middle-aged man wearing clothes that had not been washed for a long time.

He was about 1.7 meters tall and looked dirty from head to toe. He wore a pair of worn-out slippers and had a cigarette in his mouth. When he opened his mouth, you could see his yellow teeth.

Even from a distance, Qiao Mianmian could smell the stench.

The man’s beady eyes were half-opened as if he was still half-asleep.

But the moment he saw Qiao Mianmian, his eyes went wide and his gaze never left her.

He stared at her blankly.

Qiao Mianmian felt like something was stuck on her, and she couldn’t shake it off.

It was very uncomfortable.

She frowned and averted her gaze despite the discomfort. However, she could still feel the man’s gaze on her.

Just then, Zhan Bo walked over and stood in front of her, blocking her behind him.

That sticky and uncomfortable gaze was finally cut off.

Zhan Bo’s gentlemanly behavior warmed Qiao Mianmian’s heart. She pursed her lips and thanked him softly. “Zhan Bo, thank you.”

Zhan Bo turned to look at her and said in a low voice, “That old man’s gaze is too wretched. You’re the only girl in our group, we have to protect you. Don’t worry, with us around, no one will dare to do anything to you.”

That bachelor’s gaze was too blatant, and he was only looking at Qiao Mianmian.

Of course Zhan Bo couldn’t stand it.

Qiao Mianmian was the only girl on their team. And she was so pretty.

The person opposite her was a bachelor in his forties who couldn’t even find a wife. When he saw Qiao Mianmian, he was like a hungry wolf seeing a fat sheep.

Zhan Bo immediately wanted to protect Qiao Mianmian. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Qiao Mianmian’s heart warmed.

Zhan Bo gave her the same feeling as Qiao Chen.

He was a very considerate and sensible younger brother.

“This... Mr. Chen?” Zhan Bo saw that the bachelor was still looking at him and frowned. He controlled his temper and said, “We’re here to help you clean the house. Is it convenient for us to do the cleaning now?”

With Zhan Bo blocking the way, Third Chen couldn’t see Qiao Mianmian for a moment. His face darkened a little, and he said to Zhan Bo in an unpleasant tone, “A big star is going to clean my house?”
