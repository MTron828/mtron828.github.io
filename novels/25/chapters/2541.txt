Chapter 2542: We Should Let Others Know the Truth

“You can date anyone but Qiao Chen, do you hear me!

“If you’re with him, don’t call me Mom anymore. I don’t have such a disappointing daughter like you!

“Hurry up and record the video. Send it to us first. I’ll speak to you about Qiao Chen later. The most important thing now is to settle your sister’s matter.”

Madam Shen hung up.

Shen Xin was still thinking about what she said.

“You can date anyone but Qiao Chen.”

“If you’re with him, don’t call me Mom anymore.”

The corridor was quiet.

The super VIP floor wasn’t a place for ordinary people.

Not everyone could stay here.

Hence, there were very few people on this floor.

Shen Xin looked up and saw that she was alone in the empty corridor.

“Shen Xin.”

Just as she was lost in her thoughts, a voice sounded behind her and pulled her back from her wandering state.

She was still in a daze, and her face was still pale. She turned her head around in confusion.

Then, she met a pair of beautiful and warm eyes.

“Shen Xin, are you alright?” The young man’s exquisite face was filled with worry. His dark eyes, which were clearer than ink, were also filled with worry and concern. “I saw you standing at the door for a long time. I… was a little worried, so I came out to take a look.”

Qiao Chen looked at her pale face and placed a hand on her shoulder. “You know about your sister?”

Qiao Chen knew what Shen Rou did.

After all, he was the one who investigated her account and gathered the evidence that she hired the Internet Water Army to defame Qiao Mianmian.

Shen Rou made a clarification on Weibo and pushed all the blame to Shen Xin.

After seeing Shen Rou’s Weibo post, especially after seeing Shen Xin’s cell phone number being exposed, he was worried about her.

Qiao Chen’s heart ached for her.

She had obviously cried.

Shen Xin looked at him for a few seconds before nodding. “Mm.”

“Don’t… be sad.” Qiao Chen wanted to console her, but he didn’t know what to say.

He was the top student in the country, but he was helpless when it came to comforting girls.

He opened his mouth awkwardly.

“If you’re really sad, you… can talk to me. If you want to cry, you can lean on me. You don’t have to hold your emotions in front of me.”

He held it in for a while before speaking. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

With that, he stared at her again.

“Qiao Chen, I called my sister just now.” Shen Xin didn’t look very sad. Her expression was calm. Under Qiao Chen’s worried gaze, her eyelashes trembled slightly. She lowered her eyes and said softly, “She asked me to take the blame. She told me that only by doing that can I protect the Shen Corporation.

“Otherwise, if my sister has negative news, it will definitely have a huge impact on the Shen Corporation. She wants me to record a video like she did and post on Weibo, admitting that I did everything.” Shen Xin seemed to be talking about someone else’s matter, and no other emotions could be seen on her face.

The calmer she appeared, the more worried Qiao Chen was.

“Shen Xin, are you alright?” Qiao Chen frowned. “I’ve said it before, you don’t have to hide your emotions in front of me. If you’re sad, you…”

“Qiao Chen, what do you think I should do?” Shen Xin interrupted him again. “My sister is the Chairman of the Shen Corporation now. If she has a negative image, it will really affect the company.

“Previously, the Shen family encountered a crisis and almost went bankrupt. Now that we’re finally safe, we can’t suffer any more blows. I’m the daughter of the Shen family. At this time, I should consider the overall situation and stand up for everything, right?”

Qiao Chen was stunned.

“Shen Xin, have you decided? Are you going to help your sister and take the blame for everything?” Qiao Chen looked at her with a complicated expression.

If Shen Xin was willing to take responsibility for Shen Rou, she would have a chance to clear her name.

But Qiao Chen wasn’t willing to let Shen Rou clear her name.

Shen Rou was the one who did the wrong thing.

Why should Shen Xin take responsibility for her?

Moreover, Shen Rou had hurt his sister.

Qiao Chen didn’t want to let Shen Rou off so easily.

If he let her off this time, she would frame Qiao Mianmian again.

Qiao Chen would never allow Shen Rou to hurt his sister again!

“Qiao Chen, if you were me, what would you do?” Shen Xin bit her lip, finally looking a little lost.

Qiao Chen kept quiet for a while.

He thought about it. If Qiao Mianmian was the one who did it, what would he do?

Was he willing to take the blame for his sister?

“I don’t know,” Qiao Chen replied.

Shen Xin didn’t seem to expect his answer. After hearing what he said, she nodded. “It’s the same for me now. I don’t know what I should do. If it’s for the Shen family’s good, I should admit that I did those things.

“But if I do that, it won’t be fair to your sister.”

Qiao Chen looked up in surprise. “You…”

“I saw what my sister said about your sister. My sister… is really too much.

“I think if someone spread rumors about her like this, I’d be so angry that I’d want to find out who it was and give them a good beating. Qiao Chen, are you feeling the same way now? You really want to beat my sister, right?”

“Shen Xin, I…”

“My sister is obsessed with Brother Yesi, so she hates your sister. This won’t be the last time.” Shen Xin’s eyes flickered as if she had made a decision. “I can take responsibility for her this time, but what about next time?

“Moreover, if I do that, it won’t be fair to Sister Qiao Mianmian.

“People who did something wrong should be punished, right?”

When Qiao Chen realized what Shen Xin was going to do, he looked at her in shock. “Shen Xin, what are you going to do?”

Shen Xin pursed her lips. She knew the consequences of what she was about to do, but she didn’t hesitate anymore. “I think we should let others know the truth..”
