Chapter 2460: Untitled

“That’s right.” The other two girls supported their good friend. “Who are you? We didn’t take photos of you at all. Aren’t you thinking too much? You’re not a big star, why should we take photos of you?”

Although they had secretly taken photos of Shen Rou, her nasty attitude made them unhappy.

They felt a little guilty at first.

But now, they were getting agitated by Shen Rou’s attitude.

Shen Rou got even angrier when she saw how arrogant they were. Taking a deep breath and resisting the urge to slap them, she gritted her teeth and said, “Since you said you didn’t take photos of me, take out your cell phones for me to check.

“I’ll apologize if I misunderstand you.

“But if you did take photos of me, you have to delete them.”

Of course, the girls wouldn’t give her their cell phones.

They had indeed secretly taken photos of Shen Rou.

“You’re crazy. I don’t even know you. Who wants to let you check their phones? What right do you have to ask us to do this?”

“That’s right. Do you think you’re the police? What a joke. Why do we have to give you our cell phones obediently? Who knows if you’re a thief? Perhaps you’ll take our cell phones and run away.”

“Sisters, don’t bother about her. Let’s go. Don’t talk nonsense with such a sick person.”

Shen Rou was obviously rich. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

And these girls all knew her. Of course, they knew that she couldn’t be a thief.

They said this so that they wouldn’t have to give their cell phones to Shen Rou.

After they finished speaking, they looked at her with disdain and disgust as if they really felt that Shen Rou was sick. They held hands and prepared to leave.

“Stop right there!” Shen Rou was shaking with anger.

It was fine if Qiao Mianmian and Mo Yesi humiliated her.

These people were insulting her.

Did they really think that everyone could bully her?

Shen Rou had just been angered by Qiao Mianmian and Mo Yesi, and she was already full of anger. Now that these girls were ignoring her, she was so angry that her head hurt. She completely lost her rationality.

She went forward and pulled a girl back. Amidst the girl’s screams, she said fiercely, “Take out your cell phones. Otherwise, don’t think of leaving!”

“What are you doing, are you crazy? Let go of me.” The girl struggled and tried to pry Shen Rou’s hand away.

At this moment, the bodyguards who had been secretly protecting Shen Rou rushed out.

Shen Rou instructed them, “Capture them all and find their cell phones.”

Shen Rou’s mind was on fire.

There was only one thought in her mind.

She couldn’t let them leave just like that.

She had to delete the photos.

She wouldn’t let anyone laugh at her.

She was the Young Lady of the Shen family, the daughter of a prestigious family in the eyes of others. Only others envied her, and no one pitied her.

“Yes, Miss.”

These bodyguards had been secretly protecting Shen Rou.

They came over immediately when they saw Shen Rou arguing with someone.
