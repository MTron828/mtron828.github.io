Chapter 1664: Doting to the End

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Not only was he gentle and rich, but he was also thoughtful and doting.

Qiao Mianmian couldn’t find a single flaw in him.

She couldn’t find any dissatisfaction.

She thought that all her good luck in life was probably focused on finding her husband.

“Alright, Baby, go out and wait obediently.” Mo Yesi’s heart skipped a beat when he saw how obedient she was. He couldn’t help but lower his head and hold her soft face. “I’ve placed the milk on the table. Drink it first to warm your stomach.

“If you’re uncomfortable, I’ll make you some hangover soup.”

“I’ll get the rice out first.” Qiao Mianmian felt embarrassed that she wasn’t doing anything. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Although Mo Yesi doted on her, she couldn’t take it for granted.

“No need.” The man insisted on pampering her to the end and wouldn’t let her do anything. He pressed her shoulder and pushed her out of the kitchen. “You don’t have to do anything. Just wait outside.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

“I can get a bowl of rice...”

It wasn’t anything troublesome.

She wasn’t the kind of rich missy who’d been served since she was little. She wasn’t used to being waited on without doing anything.

“I’ll get it.” Mo Yesi didn’t give her a chance. “You were so drunk last night, you must still be unwell. Listen to me, go out and wait, alright?”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

Seeing how insistent he was, she could only nod. “Alright, then. Call me if you need any help.”

Not long after Qiao Mianmian left, Mo Yesi came out with breakfast.

He made porridge, fried a few eggs, and fried a plate of vegetables.

The eggs were a little mushy, and the vegetables had been fried for too long. The color wasn’t good.

“Just eat it.” Mo Yesi also felt that his two dishes didn’t look too good. After placing them on the table, he pursed his lips and said, “They don’t look good, but I tried them just now. The taste isn’t too bad.

“It should be edible.”

“It’s already very good.” Qiao Mianmian picked up her chopsticks and picked up some vegetables. After tasting it, she praised. “It tastes pretty good.”

Mo Yesi sat down beside her and looked at her suspiciously. “You really think it tastes good?”

“Mm, really.” Qiao Mianmian nodded and looked into his eyes. “If this is your first time, I think it’s already very good. My first time cooking, I almost burned the kitchen.”

“That’s good.” Mo Yesi felt very satisfied. “I’ll learn a few more dishes in the future. I should be able to cook better next time.”

“Actually, you don’t have to cook yourself. Aren’t there many chefs at home? It’s the same if you let the chef cook.” Qiao Mianmian wasn’t the kind of person who wanted him to cook personally just to prove how much Mo Yesi liked her.

She felt that Mo Yesi had been pampered since young and rarely did such things. There was no need to deliberately make him do it just to show her importance.

The Mo Family didn’t lack chefs.

It didn’t matter to her whether he did it or not.

Of course, Qiao Mianmian was really happy that he cooked for her.

“How is it the same?” Mo Yesi placed an omelet on her plate. “The chef made it, not me.”

“But, don’t you find it troublesome?”

The man looked at her tenderly and said, “Of course not.”
