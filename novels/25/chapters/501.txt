Chapter 502: What Should We Do Now, They Want to Report Us

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Qiao Mianmian was embarrassed by his statistics. It really felt that he was a burden to his teammates.

Even though he was aggressive in his tactics, his statistics didn’t reflect well on him.

The Jungle Hero had the most critical role in the Honor of Kings.

This was because he set the entire pace of the round. If the person controlling the hero wasn’t good, they would have lost half the battle already.

Hence, a Li Bai Jungle Hero with such statistics would be devastating to his teammates.

With such statistics, they couldn’t even farm properly, let alone try to lead a momentum.

Hence, in a matter of minutes, their defense towers were half gone already.

The opposing team rode on the momentum and destroyed the defense towers in the middle lane until the very last one. Their headquarters would be vulnerable if the last one was destroyed as well.

The teammates couldn’t help but criticize him after looking at Mo Yesi’s statistics.

Little fried Ruban: [Li Bai, why are you the jungle hero when you don’t know how to use it? It’s my misfortune to have such a lousy teammate like you for my rank-up match.]

Baby Tanyi: [If you want to train to use a hero, you should be playing unranked matches. You’re sabotaging us.]

Best support in the server: [Li Bai is too much of a hindrance, let’s report him after the match.]

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

She looked at Mo Yesi angrily and said, “What should we do now, they want to report us.”

If Mo Yesi’s statistics remained unchanged until the end of the match, she would be deducted several points if others reported her.

Without any honor points, she couldn’t play ranked matches for the next few days.

However, even though he was insulted by his teammates, Mo Yesi was unfazed and remained focused on the game. He continued to control the hero calmly.

“What happens if the report is successful?” he asked while playing the game.

Qiao Mianmian pouted. “My honor points will be deducted, and I won’t be able to play ranked matches for the time being.”

“What must I do so that their report fails?”

Qiao Mianmian pouted again and replied hopelessly, “You must get a few kills. Otherwise, the system will think that you are purposely failing.”

Mo Yesi kept quiet for a while before replying, “I’m doing it on purpose.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

He was doing it on purpose?

Didn’t he want to win?

Pretending to fail on purpose would only lead to a loss.

“I was familiarizing myself with this hero when I was pretending to lose. I’m quite familiar with the hero already. Don’t worry, they won’t kill me anymore.

“Since getting a few kills will cause their report to fail, let me get a few kills then.”

She thought that Mo Yesi was just bluffing.

That he just wanted to protect his pride.

He already lost so many kills, and he didn’t have much capital as well. How was he supposed to kill the opposing team?

Qiao Mianmian didn’t have high hopes for him.

She just hoped that Mo Yesi would stop pretending and hindering his teammates.

Then, maybe, just maybe, they would have a chance to win.

However, after a few minutes.

Qiao Mianmian’s eyes widened in shock as she continued to monitor the gameplay.

At the same time.

Sounds started to appear on her phone. “First blood, double kill, triple kill, quadra kill, penta...”

After the sound that announced that the opposing team was eliminated sounded, Qiao Mianmian noticed that the teammates who were insulting Mo Yesi previously were praising him now. “Wow, you’re really good at this game. Big boss, were you using your toes to play just now?”Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates
