Chapter 1085: What Did She See?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“It’s just a dream, anyway. Can you just let me sleep with you?” Jiang Luoli said as she reached out to unbutton his shirt. Because she was drunk, she took a long time to do it.

She whined at him unhappily. “Your clothes are so hard to take off, can you take them off yourself?”

Mo Shixiu was as stiff as a rock.

However, his body wasn’t. His entire body was burning as if a layer of fire covered his skin.

His breathing started to become unstable. He grabbed the small hand moving around on his body and gritted his teeth. His low and hoarse voice sounded like he was gritting his teeth. “Jiang Luoli, you’re not dreaming. Do you know what you’re doing?

“If you do that again, I can’t promise what’s going to happen next.

“Do you really think I won’t touch you?”

“Then don’t promise me anything.” Jiang Luoli looked at the firm and sexy muscles on the man’s chest and struggled to break free from his grip and slipped into his shirt like a loach.

She then touched the muscles on his chest that she had been coveting for a long time.

They felt pretty good, so she touched it a few more times.

The man’s rapid breathing came from above.

Jiang Luoli placed her hand on the man’s warm and firm chest. Feeling the smooth muscles under her palm, she couldn’t help but sigh at the dream’s authenticity.

It was so real that she didn’t feel like she was dreaming.

It felt especially good.

Her hand touched his chest for a while as if she wasn’t satisfied, then moved down a little...

“Jiang Luoli!”

Sweat dripped down Mo Shixiu’s forehead incessantly. When Jiang Luoli touched his belt, he took a deep breath and pressed her hand down. He was about to get up and open the door when the door was suddenly pushed open.

“Mister, the hangover soup...”

It was Sister Lin.

Because the door was ajar, Sister Lin didn’t knock and just walked in.

As soon as she entered the bedroom, she saw Jiang Luoli preparing to unbuckle his belt.

Sister Lin was stunned. She widened her eyes in shock and swallowed her words. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

What, what, what did she see?

She actually saw Mister pinning Miss Jiang down while Miss Jiang had one hand on the belt of Mister’s suit pants...

This was too explosive.

Mister was actually so impatient. He didn’t even close the door...

Given that Mo Shixiu was always serious in Sister Lin’s mind, she would be even a little surprised if he spoke more to girls. This scene really shocked her.

She seemed to have disturbed her husband.

Sister Lin was so shocked that she almost spilled the soup on the floor. She was stunned for a few seconds before she reacted and quickly turned around.

Even for a woman her age, she felt a little embarrassed when she recalled what she had just seen.

“Mister, I’m sorry. I should have knocked on the door first! I’ll go out now. I won’t disturb you and Miss Jiang. You, you can continue!”

Then, Sister Lin turned around and left.

“Sister Lin, no, you misunderstood...” Mo Shixiu opened his mouth to explain, but before he could finish, Sister Lin had already walked out of the bedroom and closed the door.

Mo Shixiu: “...”

Under him, a certain little thing was still struggling and trying to take off his clothes with her other hand.
