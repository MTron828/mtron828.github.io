Qiao Mianmian turned around and glared at him when she realized she couldn’t open the door. “Unlock it, I want to get off.”

Mo Yesi smiled. “Kiss me and I’ll let you go.”

She was getting frustrated. “I won’t...”

Before she finished speaking, he pulled her into a hug.

“Mm...” Mo Yesi gave her a long kiss and then pinched her cheek.

It felt so good to hold her in his arms.

He just wanted to tease her, but he soon lost control.

The few gentle pecks became all the more passionate.

Tension, or rather excitement, rose in the car.

The atmosphere was filled with lust.

The sounds they made her embarrassed.

She went all soft as her face turned red. She tugged at his shirt and buttons while her breathing picked up speed.

Mo Yesi was getting excited.

His arm around her slowly reached under her clothes.

“Oh, no...”

She suddenly felt her chest go cold, and in a moment of panic, she pushed him away. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Mo Yesi was suddenly conscious of his actions when she pushed him.

He looked up, saw how flustered she looked, and his gaze fell back on her lips.

Still breathing hard, his voice was oddly hoarse. “What to do, Baby?”

Qiao Mianmian dared not look at him in the eye. “What do you mean, what to do?”

Mo Yesi looked at her deeply. “I’m hungry.”

“You’re hungry?” Qiao Mianmian was startled. “But we just had lun—”

She stopped herself when she saw his odd expression.

“Mo Yesi...” Qiao Mianmian was really flustered this time. She reached out to put distance between the two of them and said a little pleadingly, “I want to get off, let me get off...”

“Baby.” Mo Yesi tightened his grip around her waist. “Don’t be afraid. I like you, that’s why I have such a reaction to you. Be good and stop moving anyhow. Otherwise, I can’t promise that I won’t lose control.”

Qiao Mianmian dared not move anymore.

She just lay in his embrace stiffly.

Mo Yesi was tensed up too. She could feel his short breaths as she leaned against him.

A few minutes later.

His breathing normalized.

Qiao Mianmian bit her lip. “A-Are you better now? Can you let me off?”

These few minutes were a lot to take in.

Mo Yesi patted her head and kissed her again gently. “Mm, go on. I’ll walk you to the dormitory.”

“It’s alright, I can just...”

Qiao Mianmian intuitively rejected him, but before she could finish speaking, she saw his eyes darken. “You won’t let me walk you there? Do you find me an embarrassment, or do you not want others to know we’re together?”
