Chapter 1914: She Would Endure This Anger for Now

“Yes, Sister Lin is very reliable.” Old Madam nodded and said, “Then, let Sister Lin take good care of her.”

“I will.”

After Mo Shixiu rejected the old lady’s suggestion, Jiang Luoli secretly heaved a sigh of relief.

It wasn’t good for her to reject this matter.

Only Mo Shixiu could do it.

Fortunately, he knew that she didn’t want to move here, so he rejected the matter directly.

Perhaps Jiang Luoli was overthinking.

She felt that after Mo Shixiu refused it, Madam Mo seemed unhappy.

This caused Jiang Luoli to feel very strange.

She didn’t believe that Madam Mo would really want to take care of her.

“Luoli, come over and say hello to Dad.” Mo Shixiu reached out a hand to Jiang Luoli and pulled her toward Mo Yunchen.

“Dad, this is Luoli.”

Mo Yunchen held her hand and said, “Luoli, call me Dad.”

Jiang Luoli met his gentle gaze and pursed her lips. She called out in embarrassment, “Dad.”

In her eyes, Mo Yunchen was still very young, and his mature charm could move girls.

She felt a little uncomfortable calling such a handsome uncle Dad.

Mo Yunchen nodded at her with a gentle expression. He was not unhappy with his daughter-in-law.

He wasn’t like Madam Mo, who valued status.

Like his two sons, he liked to rely on his own abilities to work hard. He didn’t think much of things like marriage between the strong.

Back then, he agreed to marry Madam Mo not only because he was filial and was willing to listen to his parents’ arrangements, but also because he quite liked her.

Therefore, he gladly accepted this marriage. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

But if he already had someone he loved back then, he wouldn’t have obediently accepted the marriage.

He didn’t think much of it himself, so of course, he wouldn’t use those standards on his two sons.

Mo Yunchen took out the gift that he had prepared earlier and handed it over. He covered his mouth and coughed lightly. “Luoli, this is a gift I prepared for you. Take it.”

Jiang Luoli hesitated.

“Dad gave it to you. Just accept it.” Mo Shixiu nodded at her. “This is a little token from the elders. They will only be happy if you accept it.”

Hearing that, Jiang Luoli didn’t hesitate and reached out to take it.

After accepting the gift, she said obediently, “Thank you, Dad.”

“Isn’t it time to eat? Luoli must be hungry, right?” The old lady’s focus was on Jiang Luoli now. She looked at the time and immediately called a maid over. “Go ask the kitchen if the food is ready.”

“Yes.”

“Luoli, you can’t go hungry now.” The old lady looked at her stomach nervously. “From now on, you have to take good care of the baby. Only then will the child be fair and fat.”

When Madam Mo saw how much the Old Madam cherished Jiang Luoli, displeasure flashed across her eyes.

She took a deep breath and recalled what Tang Ya had said to her before. She suppressed the unpleasant feeling in her heart.

No matter how unhappy she was with Jiang Luoli, she couldn’t show it anymore.

She would endure this anger for now. After her plan was successfully carried out, she would no longer have to see this irksome woman.

With that thought in mind, she smiled.
