Chapter 481: Mo Yesi, What Are You Doing

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

He wanted to let everyone know that she belonged to him.

He was never this possessive to anyone or anything before.

It was only after meeting her that he knew how possessive he could be.

He even had the thought of putting her in captivity previously.

He wanted... to have her all to himself, and no one should ever get near her.

Of course, he dismissed that thought the moment it surfaced.

He would have never done it.

That would be too selfish. It was a distorted version of love where only one part would be happy and the other party would get hurt in the process.

How could he ever hurt her?

He suppressed the raging desire and unbuckled her safety belt. He then carried her off the car.

...

Qiao Mianmian had a really deep sleep.

She had a dream.

In the dream, she entered a dangerous forest swarming with dangerous creatures. There was a huge tiger that spotted her and was running towards her.

She screamed and started to run.

However, despite her best efforts, the tiger soon caught up with her.

The agile creature glared at her, growled, and pounced towards her.

She was pinned onto the ground violently.

The tiger was heavy, and its weight prevented her from breathing.

The tiger then opened its mouth, showing its sharp teeth.

Qiao Mianmian shut her eyes in fear thinking that she would die.

But in the next moment...

She didn’t experience any pain, but...

In the dream, she opened her eyes in shock and found that the tiger was licking her neck.

The sharp claws of the tiger didn’t tear her apart as well. It did tear her clothes though.

She felt a coldness in her chest because of it.

The tiger was pinning her down, and she was losing her breath.

She woke up from the feeling of being suffocated. She noticed a dark figure towering over her the moment she opened her eyes.

The dark figure was a man.

As she realized that a man was pinning her down, she almost screamed.

Suddenly, she noticed a familiar scent from the man. She lifted her head and looked shockingly at the man towering over her.

She saw a pair of eyes burning in desire. She could see her shocked expression from the reflection in his eyes.

She could see the raging desires in his eyes. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

His desires were so intense that... It scared her.

One of his hands was unbuttoning her clothes. Soon, he was almost done fully unbuttoning her already.

His robe was also undone, revealing his toned upper body. As she lifted her head, she saw his well-toned muscles from the collarbone to his abs.

She stared for a moment and could feel her face flushing.

Her heart couldn’t handle this kind of stimulation this early in the morning.

Wait. Something was wrong!

That was not what she should be concerned about.

She recovered from the seduction. Then, with a raspy voice, she asked, “Mo Yesi, what are you doing?”

Mo Yesi met her eyes and replied smilingly, “Baby, what do you think I’m doing?”

His voice was low and raspy as he just woke up as well. The way he called her “baby” was really attractive.
