Chapter 776: More Powerful Than Bai Yusheng

They were also the most powerful family in Yuncheng City.

If Qiao Mianmian’s backing was the Mo family, Yan Shaoqing wouldn’t be able to help her.

Although the Yan family was one of the top four families, they were still inferior to the Mo family. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

But this wasn’t the main issue.

More importantly, how could Qiao Mianmian know someone from the Mo family?

Everyone knew that the Young Master of the Mo family was still single. Moreover, he was a very self-disciplined person who didn’t even have a woman by his side.

The Second Young Master of the Mo family was known for having anorexia.

In any case, the two Young Masters of the Mo family weren’t interested in women.

Hence, Qiao Mianmian would never have the chance to interact with them. Even if she did, she wouldn’t have any interactions with them.

But if he wasn’t from the Mo family, Yan Shaoqing wouldn’t have said that he was better than Bai Yusheng.

In a short period, Huang Yilin’s expression changed again and again. The fear and apprehension in her heart grew.

But what if... it was the person she was thinking of.

She didn’t dare to think about the consequences.

She didn’t dare to imagine what would happen if she offended the Mo family.

That was because it was a result that would make her hair stand on end.

“Huang Yilin, you’ve offended someone you shouldn’t have. I can’t help you this time. Oh right, let’s end our relationship here. I’ll get someone to take a picture of the villa you mentioned previously. Consider it a break-up gift.”

Yan Shaoqing hung up.

Huang Yilin’s grip on the cell phone loosened when she heard the disconnected tone.

The phone hit the ground, and a crack appeared on the screen.

“What’s going on?” The manager frowned and asked anxiously. “What did Young Master Yan say? Is he willing to plead for you?”

Huang Yilin didn’t respond.

The manager got even more anxious and grabbed her hand. “Say something. Is Young Master Yan willing to help?”

She was the one who raised Huang Yilin.

In order to make her popular, she spent a lot of effort on her.

Naturally, she spent a lot of money too.

Huang Yilin was now the company’s cash cow. If she really fell, it would have a huge impact on the company.

The impact on her as a manager would be even greater.

Hence, he couldn’t let Huang Yilin fall.

Huang Yilin finally snapped out of her daze.

Her face was pale.

It was the sort of paleness that couldn’t be hidden even with makeup.

She looked at her manager with a look of despair. Her lips quivered as she said, “He said... he can’t help me. We were all wrong. Qiao Mianmian’s backing isn’t Bai Yusheng, but someone even more powerful than him.

“Lisa, who do you think that person is?

“Who is better than Bai Yusheng?

“How could Qiao Mianmian know such a powerful person? If she really knows him, how could she only grab a third female role? Did Yan Shaoqing lie to me because he didn’t want to help?”

Her manager was called Lisa.

Hearing that, Lisa’s face turned pale.

She was shocked. “Yan Shaoqing told you that the man behind Qiao Mianmian is even more powerful than Bai Yusheng?”
