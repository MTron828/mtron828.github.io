Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Ah Li is our only hope now. Do you really want to anger her into leaving? By then, no one will be able to save Xiao Hai.”

“But you saw her attitude just now. Do you think she’ll save Xiao Hai?” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“If she wasn’t willing to save him, she would have left long ago.” Father Jiang was more rational and analyzed the pros and cons for Mother Jiang. “Don’t you know your own daughter? She has had a sharp tongue and a soft heart since she was young. She has had a good relationship with Xiao Hai since she was young, it’s impossible for her to leave him rotting in jail.”

Mother Jiang’s expression softened a little, but she still said with a straight face, “So what? 10 million isn’t a small sum. Even if she really has this sum of money, she might not take it all out to pay Xiao Hai’s debt.”

Father Jiang frowned and was about to speak when Mother Jiang’s cell phone rang.

Mother Jiang took out her cell phone and saw that it was an unknown number.

She thought for a while and picked it up.

A minute later, Mother Jiang’s expression changed. She gripped her cell phone tightly, and a hint of joy appeared in her eyes.

...

After Jiang Luoli left the police station, she kept thinking about what Jiang Hai told her.

It was obvious that he had been tricked.

But the person who tricked him didn’t seem to be after money.

They wanted to make Jiang Hai pay and then send him to the police station.

But who had such a huge feud with the Jiang family and needed to set such a trap for Jiang Hai?

The person who set this up wasn’t even on the same level as the Jiang family.

An ordinary family wouldn’t be able to fork out 10 million yuan.

Jiang Luoli thought for a while and then suddenly thought of someone.

Jiang Hai liked to hang out outside, but he didn’t make any big mistakes over the years. The Jiang family didn’t have a feud with anyone.

If she had to say who the Jiang family offended, it was someone she offended.

After that negotiation, she rejected Madam Mo’s check. She could tell that Madam Mo was very angry.

But she never looked for her again.

She felt uneasy and thought that Madam Mo wouldn’t let this go.

And Jiang Hai’s incident this time was so abnormal. It wouldn’t be strange if... it was Madam Mo’s doing.

After the negotiation failed, she started with her family.

This was a common tactic used by rich families.

If Madam Mo got someone to do this, it wouldn’t be so easy to get Jiang Hai out.

It wasn’t about repaying the money.

Jiang Luoli was furious. She clenched her fists and dialed a number.

It was the number that Madam Mo had used to call her.

She didn’t know if it was Madam Mo’s number, but it went through after a while.

“Hello.”

A woman’s voice came from the phone.

Jiang Luoli bit her lip and clenched her fists. “Madam Mo, it’s Jiang Luoli.”

It was Madam Mo’s voice.

“Miss Jiang?” Madam Mo was stunned for a few seconds before chuckling. “What’s going on? Why would Miss Jiang call me? Why is Miss Jiang looking for me?”

Not wanting to beat around the bush, Jiang Luoli asked coldly, “Did you get someone to settle my brother’s matter?”

“Miss Jiang’s brother?” Madam Mo sounded confused. “I don’t understand what Miss Jiang is talking about.”
