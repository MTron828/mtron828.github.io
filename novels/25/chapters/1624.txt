Chapter 1625: You Have to Shoot the Scene in the Afternoon?

She saw Mo Yesi sitting there.

The man exuded a cold aura, and his eyes were narrowed as if he was thinking about something.

It was probably because he looked so unapproachable that even the people walking past him were a few meters away.

There were still actors filming on the set. Qiao Mianmian’s two scenes hadn’t arrived yet. While waiting, she walked to Mo Yesi.

As she approached, the man seemed to sense her presence and turned to look at her.

When his gaze landed on her, his aura instantly changed.

His expression was different too.

He was no longer cold and distant. Gentleness and affection filled his eyes.

“Are you bored here alone?” Qiao Mianmian sighed. “I told you to leave, but you didn’t want to. It’s really boring for you to stay on set, you should...”

“I’m not bored.” Before she could finish, he grabbed her soft hand and held it gently. “With you around, how could I be bored?”

“But...”

Qiao Mianmian squatted down beside him and looked up at him. “I really think you’ll be very bored. And, and...”

“And what?”

Qiao Mianmian pursed her lips and blinked.

“Moreover, I feel a little uncomfortable with you watching me. The production crew has a lounge too. Why don’t you wait for me in Brother’s lounge? I’ll look for you when I’m done.”

Qiao Mianmian didn’t want Mo Yesi to see her acting intimate with Qin Han.

This jealous lover would definitely do something.

What if he did something irrational?

The jealous Mo Yesi was very irrational.

Hence, Qiao Mianmian felt that this could happen. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

She had to persuade this man to leave before that happened.

Qiao Mianmian felt Mo Yesi tighten his grip.

“Will you feel uncomfortable if I stay here?”

He was obviously unhappy with this.

The man frowned and pursed his lips. He didn’t seem to be in a good mood.

Qiao Mianmian said, “...Don’t misunderstand, I don’t mean to despise you. I just feel uncomfortable letting my husband watch me act with someone else.”

“The love scene?” Mo Yesi couldn’t help but say sourly, “It’s an intimate scene with someone else.”

Qiao Mianmian said, “...You know? Who told you? Was it my brother?”

Mo Yesi looked unhappy. “It’s not important who told me. Do you have to shoot the scene in the afternoon?”

Qiao Mianmian pursed her lips. “Mm.”

She knew that Mo Yesi would be unhappy.

But this was her job.

Mo Yesi pursed his lips and kept quiet.

After a while, Qiao Mianmian shook his arm. “Are you angry?”

Mo Yesi looked at her quietly.

He wanted to say that he wasn’t angry, but he didn’t want to lie to himself.

“You’re really angry?” Qiao Mianmian shook his arm again and coaxed softly. “Alright, don’t be angry. You know that this is just acting. It’s not reality. No matter what I do in my acting, it’s not true.”
