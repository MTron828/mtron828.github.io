Chapter 2358: Why Don’t We Team Up?

But he looked different in formal wear. Even Qiao Mianmian felt that this big boy was charming.

He was very masculine tonight.

Zhan Bo smiled. “You’re alone tonight? No male companion?”

“You’re also alone tonight? No female companion?” Qiao Mianmian looked at the empty space beside Zhan Bo.

“Yes.” Zhan Bo nodded. “Why don’t we team up?”

Qiao Mianmian was stunned. “Team up?”

“Yes, I don’t have a female companion, and you don’t have a male companion. Isn’t that just nice?” Seeing her hesitation, he asked, “Is there a problem?”

A cold face suddenly appeared in his mind. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

He recalled the last time he saw Mo Yesi. They had only greeted Qiao Mianmian, but Mo Yesi had given them a warning look.

He was a possessive man.

So, Qiao Mianmian hesitated because she was afraid that Mo Yesi would mind.

At this thought, Zhan Bo felt that his life was more important. Although Mo Yesi wasn’t as petty as he thought, it was always better to be cautious.

Small fry like them couldn’t afford to offend such a big shot.

“Forget it. Let’s go our separate ways. Just take it that I…”

Zhan Bo was about to say something when Qiao Mianmian said, “Mm, let’s walk the red carpet together later.”

Qiao Mianmian felt that it shouldn’t be a problem.

Although Mo Yesi was a little petty and jealous, this was normal work.

It was just walking the red carpet with Zhan Bo.

So many people were watching, so many cameras were directed at them. What could happen?

If she refused, people would think that she was being unreasonable.

Other female celebrities who had boyfriends or were married would have male companions at such events.

Stunned, Zhan Bo blinked. “Are you sure?”

“I’m sure.” Qiao Mianmian blinked. “Why? Is there a problem?”

“No.” Zhan Bo shook his head. “What problem can there be? I’m just afraid that your side…”

“Mm?” Qiao Mianmian was confused. “Afraid of what?”

“I’m afraid Chairman Mo will mind.” Zhan Bo was rather close to her. Although they hadn’t known each other for long, both on the show and outside, they got along well.

Hence, he didn’t beat around the bush.

Qiao Mianmian was stunned for a while. Then, she saw Zhan Bo’s teasing gaze and blushed.

It seemed like even he and the rest knew that Mo Yesi was jealous.

She felt that she should salvage his image.

“How can he be so petty?” Even Qiao Mianmian didn’t believe what she was saying. “It’s just a red carpet. But you, I’ll walk the red carpet with you. Your girlfriend fans and wife fans won’t object, right?”

Zhan Bo was a top-notch new celebrity.

He had many girlfriend fans and wife fans.

Although Qiao Mianmian was joking, she was really worried that his female fans would form a grudge against her.
