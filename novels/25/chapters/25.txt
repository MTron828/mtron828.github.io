Chapter 26: I Will Take All Responsibility

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“I...”

Without waiting for Qiao Mianmian to speak, he said more and more coldly, “You are the wife of President Mo, so of course, you have such power. What is the point of leaving these kinds of employees?”

Qiao Mianmian’s eyes lit up. “So, you agree?”

“Qiao Mianmian, you are my woman. If anyone dares to make you feel wronged, tell me, and no matter who the other party is, I will seek justice for you.

“Remember, now that you are married to me, you can do whatever you want. I will take responsibility for everything.”

The man’s low and arrogant voice softly penetrated into her ear.

He had said, Qiao Mianmian, now that you are married to me, you can do whatever you want. I will take responsibility for everything.

At this moment, a warm current flowed gently into her heart.

Throughout the years, she could only rely on herself and had forced herself to be independent and strong. The person she could rely on had always been herself.

But now...

Suddenly someone told her that she could rely on him.

No matter what happened, he would take responsibility for her.

It didn’t matter if he was sincere at this moment.

She was still grateful.

Her eyes were slightly moist as she took a deep breath and responded softly, “... Okay.”

****

After Qiao Mianmian spoke to Mo Yesi, soon, the superiors came over.

She returned to the store again.

Qiao Anxin had picked out her clothes and Su Ze was helping to settle the bill at the checkout counter.

When Qiao Mianmian walked into the store, a clerk saw her, immediately lowered his face, and then sneered sarcastically. “Oh, haven’t you already left? Why are you back again? Do you still want to steal things in our store?”

Another shop clerk also saw her and said bitterly, “Can you please not throw Ms. Qiao’s face by doing such lowly things? You’re shameless, but what about her?”

“What happened?”

Qiao Anxin turned around, and when she saw Qiao Mianmian, she became stunned.

“Ms. Qiao, your thief sister is back again.” One of the shop assistants gave Qiao Mianmian a dismissive look, and then called the other shop assistants. “She must want to steal. Everyone, please pay more attention and don’t let her steal anything.”

Qiao Anxin stared at Qiao Mianmian for a few seconds and frowned slightly.

“Sister,” she said with an embarrassed expression, biting the corners of her lips and whispering, “Do you like the clothes in this shop? If you really like them, Brother Su Ze and I can buy you one. You really don’t have to...”

Having said that, she frowned again.

As if her next words were hard to say.

Several clerks, trying to flatter Qiao Anxin, praised her. “Ms. Qiao, you’re too good to this thief sister. Why would you give her such expensive clothes?” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“Exactly. She doesn’t even suit such expensive clothes. The clothes in our shop are only suitable for women like Ms. Qiao.”

“Ms. Qiao is really kind. She got involved in your relationship with Mr. Su and forced a couple like you to be separated for so many years. Ms. Qiao, you don’t have to treat such a shameless woman so well.”

“Some people really don’t know themselves and don’t look at themselves. Can you compare to Ms. Qiao?”

Qiao Mianmian looked at the shop assistants who were praising Qiao Anxin to the skies and degrading her so viciously. She sneered through the corners of her lips.
