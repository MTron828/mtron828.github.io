“Mm, he has something on. He just left.”

“Oh.” Qiao Mianmian thought about how she met Madam Mo at the shop and hesitated to tell Jiang Luoli.

It seemed like Madam Mo wanted to come over to see the baby.

But…

Jiang Luoli and Madam Mo were on bad terms now. If she came over, they might argue again.

She decided to say it.

“Luo Luo, I bumped into Madam Mo and someone else when I was shopping. She said she’s coming over to visit Yueyue soon.”

“She’s coming to see Yueyue?” Jiang Luoli was still smiling and peeling an orange for Qiao Mianmian. But in the next second, her smile vanished.

“Mm.”

“Someone else?” Jiang Luoli turned around. “Who are you talking about?”

“It’s a woman called Tang Ya.” Qiao Mianmian didn’t have any secrets with Jiang Luoli. She told her about Tang Ya working with the Shen Corporation to deal with the Mo Corporation.

A moment later.

Jiang Luoli was shocked. “So, Tang Ya’s target is the Mo family? What feud does she have with the Mo family? Her identity is so difficult to find out that even Mo Yesi can’t with the Mo family’s power.”

“Mm, it seems like her target is indeed the Mo family. As for the feud, I don’t know before I find out her identity. But she’s definitely not simple. Anyway, I felt uncomfortable the first time I saw her.”

Jiang Luoli’s expression was a little serious. “From what you said, this person is indeed not simple. Even the Mo family can’t find anything about her. Her background must be very powerful. I think it’s rather dangerous for someone with a powerful background and an unknown identity to deal with the Mo family.

“She must have ulterior motives for getting close to Madam Mo.”

“Mm.” Qiao Mianmian nodded. “I just don’t know what she wants. The Shen Corporation has already been acquired by the Mo Corporation, so she’ll definitely find a new partner. Such a dangerous person has now become Madam Mo’s good friend. I feel like she might be trying to do something through Madam Mo.”

“I think so, too.” Jiang Luoli agreed. “She definitely wants to use Madam Mo to do something. No, we can’t let Madam Mo continue interacting with her. Otherwise, I’m really worried about our safety.

“Baby, we have to let Madam Mo know that Tang Ya isn’t a good person.”

…

Qiao Mianmian accompanied Jiang Luoli for the whole afternoon. Mo Yesi came to pick her up after work, and they stayed for dinner.

In the car.

Qiao Mianmian looked out the window at the dark night sky and felt an inexplicable sense of unease.

This uneasy feeling came after meeting Tang Ya and Madam Mo.

“Mo Yesi, I bumped into Mom when I went to get a gift for Yueyue today.” Qiao Mianmian held back her uneasiness and looked out of the window.

“You bumped into Mom? She was at the shop, too?” Mo Yesi sounded calm.

“Mm, she seemed to be buying a gift for Yueyue too.” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“She bought a gift for Yueyue? Didn’t Big Brother forbid her from seeing Yueyue?”

“Although Big Brother doesn’t want her to meet Yueyue, she’s still Yueyue’s grandmother. She might want to see her granddaughter..”
