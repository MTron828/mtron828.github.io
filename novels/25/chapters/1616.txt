Chapter 1618: I’m Wrong, I Repent

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

After a moment of jealousy, they left.

When no one else was around, Mo Yesi became even more unrestrained.

He pinched Qiao Mianmian’s chin and leaned towards her. “Baby, don’t you owe me an explanation?”

Qiao Mianmian blinked. “I owe you an explanation? What explanation?”

The man narrowed his eyes and said unhappily, “Why didn’t you tell me that you were harassed that night? Did you think that someone could help you solve the problem, so you don’t need me anymore?”

Although it was a question, Qiao Mianmian could hear the unhappiness and jealousy in it.

She was stunned for a few seconds before laughing. “You’re not angry about this, are you? I didn’t tell you because I didn’t think it was necessary. Someone harassed me, but thankfully, Gong Zeli appeared in time, so nothing bad happened.

“What’s the point of telling you?

“After that, because the matter was resolved, I didn’t feel the need to tell you.”

Qiao Mianmian looked at his expression.

“Are you really angry about this?”

Mo Yesi narrowed his eyes. “Remember what you promised me?”

Qiao Mianmian knew what he was about to say.

She blinked innocently. “I remember. I promised to tell you no matter what happened.”

“So you still remember.”

Mo Yesi pursed his lips and frowned. “Did you do it?”

Qiao Mianmian replied, “...No.

“I’m sorry, I was wrong. I repent.” She admitted her mistake with a good attitude. “I’ve realized my mistake now. I’ll reflect on myself and never make the same mistake again.

“No matter what happens in the future, whether it’s resolved or not, I’ll tell you.”

Mo Yesi was speechless.

He didn’t know what to say. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

If he blamed her again, it would seem like he wasn’t magnanimous enough.

“Should I believe you?”

“Of course.” Qiao Mianmian hugged him and said softly, “It’s true this time. Believe me again, alright? I won’t keep things from you anymore. Moreover, I didn’t tell you because I was afraid you’d worry.

“You were out on a business trip, I didn’t want to distract you.”

Mo Yesi was no longer angry.

He just felt uncomfortable that she kept it from him.

How could he not know that she didn’t want him to worry?

He sighed and pinched her face helplessly. “If there’s a next time, I’ll tie you to me and won’t let you go anywhere. I won’t have to worry about you all day.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

“Alright, alright. This matter has come to an end. Have you eaten? Do you want me to accompany you? Also, have you finished work? Why are you here? Are you tired? Do you want to rest? Do you want to return to Yuncheng City today?”

Mo Yesi chuckled. “Mm, I’ve eaten. I’m done with work for now.”
