Chapter 1899: They’ll Be Enjoying Themselves

“Why did you suddenly decide to change locations? Didn’t the contract we signed say that this episode would be filmed here?”

“Didn’t I just say that the director doesn’t think there’s enough material to shoot here?

“We can’t finish filming one episode of the show, and the quality isn’t very good. That’s why we decided to change locations at the last minute.

“Everyone should believe in the director’s ability. She must be thinking of the episode’s quality, that’s why she made such a decision. Every episode of ‘The Meaning of Traveling’ has the highest viewership rating among all the television stations at the same time period. Our goal is to do the best program, the most exciting program, that’s why the director strives for perfection. Do you all understand what I’m saying?”

As Zhao Yuan spoke, even he believed his own words.

The others naturally believed him as well.

To them, this was not unacceptable. Besides, Zhao Yuan had said that the other filming location was much better than this one.

If that was the case, they would be more than happy to change locations.

“Brother Zhao, where are we going tomorrow?” Su Mufei was more interested in this matter.

In any case, as long as he didn’t have to continue doing missions, he was fine with anything.

“We’ll go to Weihai tomorrow.”

“Weihai?” The others were stunned. They looked surprised. “The new filming location is in Weihai? Which town or village is it under Weihai?”

“Not anywhere else, just Weihai,” he said.

Zhao Yuan thought that the production team wanted to arrange for them to go to another village.

After all, the previous few episodes were filmed in villages.

From the viewership ratings, the viewers loved to see celebrities going to the countryside to do farm work and suffer hardships. Therefore, they had taken the same route for the past few episodes.

After all, such a safe route could guarantee high viewership ratings.

But now, the higher-ups had instructed them to film this episode somewhere else.

And they couldn’t make the guests suffer.

When Zhao Yuan was notified of the new filming location, he thought that he had heard wrongly.

Not only was the new filming location not in a village with poor conditions, but it was also arranged to be in a tourist city.

The guest rooms were also very good.

It was a villa area in a tourist attraction, and it was a high-spending place.

Of course, this was not arranged by the production team.

One must know that a villa in that area cost more than 100,000 yuan per night.

They would be there for about 20 days.

The production team wouldn’t be so generous as to spend a few million on the guests.

Most importantly, the show’s main theme was to make the guests suffer!

Arranging for the guests to stay in a villa that cost more than 100,000 yuan a night. How could it be hard?

They’d be enjoying themselves.

Zhao Yuan found such an arrangement unreasonable, and the director was naturally unwilling.

But there was no other way.

The director had said that this was the Mo Corporation’s CEO’s intention. The accommodation fees, plane tickets, and mismanagement fees for the production team would all be reimbursed by the Mo Corporation. The production team wouldn’t suffer any losses.

This was definitely a good thing for the guests. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

But it was difficult for the director.

Because the director didn’t even know what to do with the show now.

Zhao Yuan looked at their shocked and confused expressions and decided to tell them everything. “The filming location is in Weihai. You’ll be staying at the Heron Island Manor. When the time comes, all of you will be staying in a villa.

“The villa has four floors, enough for ten of you.”

Shocked again, everyone turned to look at each other for a few seconds. Su Mufei asked in disbelief, “Brother Zhao, you’re not lying to us, right? We’ll be staying in a villa?”
