Chapter 57: I Won’t Treat Myself Poorly

“Without Young Master Su, who are you! I will teach you little bitch a lesson today!”

With that said, she raised her hand and was about to hit Qiao Mianmian’s face.

Qiao Mianmian sneered and stood there without dodging. She grabbed her hand and pushed hard. Shen Yueyue yelled in dismay and fell heavily onto the ground.

With this fall, she bumped her head against the iron of the bed and a small wound formed on her forehead.

“Ah, Yueyue, your forehead is bleeding.” Zhao Wanting exclaimed as if her tail had been stepped on. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

There were six people in the dorm, but they were divided into three small factions.

Qiao Mianmian and Jiang Luoli were of one faction, Shen Yueyue and Zhao Wanting the other, and the remaining two were in neutral stances.

Seeing that Shen Yueyue was injured, Zhao Wanting glared at Qiao Mianmian. She raised her hand and rushed towards her. “Slut, Young Master Su has already broken up with you, but you’re still so crazy. How dare you hurt Yueyue, I will fight it out with you.”

Qiao Mianmian looked coldly at her.

When Zhao Wanting was about to rush in front of her, she stretched out one foot.

“Ah!” She screamed again.

Zhao Wanting also fell heavily to the ground in a pitiful position.

When the bridge of her nose hit the hard floor, she burst into tears. “Qiao Mianmian, you slut. How dare you treat me and Yueyue like this, we will not let you go.”

Shen Yueyue was dizzy after this fall and it took a while before she returned to her senses.

She reached out and touched the blood on her forehead. She was so frightened that her face turned paler by two shades.

“Qiao Mianmian, how dare you...” She gritted her teeth and glared at her, her anger reaching an extreme point.

“Slut, do you think Young Master Su will still protect you now? How dare you treat me like this, you wait!”

“Qiao Mianmian, you wait. We will get our revenge!”

The two got up from the ground and ran out of the bedroom after threatening her.

“Mianmian, what should we do?”

Jiang Luoli was worried. “Shen Yueyue and Zhao Wanting have a godbrother. He’s a rich second-generation rich man and a jerk. They must have gone to find him. Maybe you should find a place to hide first and avoid this crisis.”

Although Qiao Mianmian’s approach was to the satisfaction of everyone, she was now without Su Ze’s protection and could be bullied easily.

She had heard of Shen Yueyue’s godbrother before. He was a ruthless person.

Jiang Luoli became more and more worried. “Mianmian, go quickly. Don’t come to class today, I will help you take a day off.”

The other two roommates in the bedroom also advised her. “Shen Yueyue’s godbrother is indeed a ruthless character. He once broke someone’s leg. You better avoid him first.”

“Yeah, Mianmian, go quickly.”

Jiang Luoli said as she pushed her towards the door.

When she was pushed to the door, Qiao Mianmian reached out and grabbed Jiang Luoli’s arm. She shook her head. “Luo Luo, I won’t go.”

“Aren’t you going?” Jiang Luoli was full of worry. “Baby, I know you’re very powerful and you haven’t lost a fight with others before. However, no matter how strong you are, you can’t beat a group of men.”

“It’s not the time to be so stubborn. Just go quickly.”

Qiao Mianmian still shook her head.

She was silent for a while, then she took out her mobile phone and made a soothing gesture towards Jiang Luoli. “What are you afraid? Isn’t she just finding someone for help? Luo Luo, if she can find a rescuer, I can too. Don’t worry, I won’t treat myself poorly.”
