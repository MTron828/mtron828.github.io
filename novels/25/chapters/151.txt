Chapter 153: You Need to Face Reality

“Mom, do you think a dead person can beat us to this? Even her daughter can’t get past me, much less a dead woman! I want Qiao Mianmian to see that I can take away anything she holds dear! She’s unable to beat me!

“The man she liked, her mother’s bedroom, and even her position as the Qiao family’s First Miss—all of these will be mine eventually!”

The housemaids standing around weren’t even surprised to hear their exchange.

The Qiao household now was practically the empire of this mother and daughter.

Anyone still loyal to Qiao Mianmian and her mother had been dismissed.

The only reason Nanny Chen stayed was that she was actually a distant relative of Father Qiao. She’d even raised him for a few years when he was a child.

Father Qiao allowed her to stay as he had some sentimental connection with her.

“My daughter is so outstanding, of course she’s good enough for all the best things in the world.” Lin Huizhen patted her daughter on the head and said proudly, “You’re not taking these away from her. These are all rightfully yours.

“If it wasn’t for the marriage contract, why would the Su family even be interested in having Qiao Mianmian? You and Ah Ze are truly made for each other. Now that you and Ah Ze are open with your relationship, and you’re carrying his child, it’s about time our families met to discuss this.”

Upon hearing the words “carrying his child”, a strange expression flickered in Qiao Anxin’s eyes.

She looked down at her flat belly and stroked it as she tried to hide her odd expression.

“Madam, Second Miss, First Miss is back.”

One of the housemaids quickly informed them as she saw Qiao Mianmian storming in angrily.

Just one moment ago, Lin Huizhen was smiling happily. But the moment she caught sight of Qiao Mianmian, her smile vanished.

Her face went cold.

“Oh, so it’s the First Miss. She finally remembers she’s got a home, huh?” Lin Huizhen spoke sarcastically.

Qiao Mianmian stopped before the two of them.

She ignored the nasty comments and glared at Qiao Anxin. She sneered. “Qiao Anxin, I underestimated your shamelessness. How is it that being a mistress isn’t enough to satisfy that disgusting heart of yours, that you have to continue doing absurd and distasteful things?”

Qiao Anxin’s expression changed instantly.

She was about to flare up, but when she saw Qiao Ruhai standing in the corner from her peripheral vision, she immediately feigned a pitiful sight. “Sister, how could you misunderstand me this way? I’ve never thought of coming between you and Brother Ah Ze. Your break-up with him was caused by you alone. Brother Ah Ze said you’re always out having shoots, and you only get to see him a few times a month. Your heart wasn’t even with him and he couldn’t bear to carry on with you that way. That was why he initiated the break-up.

“I can understand that you’re still heartbroken. But have you ever thought about why he could still bear to break up with you even after so many years of being together, even though you guys were almost getting married?

“Sister, he doesn’t love you anymore, that’s it. You need to face reality.”Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com
