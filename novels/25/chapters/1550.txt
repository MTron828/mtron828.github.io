Chapter 1551: It’s Different Now, I Have You

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Hui Ning, is it far from here?”

Assistant Xu was stunned. “Minister, are you going after Miss Jiang?”

“No.” Mo Shixiu shook his head.

He was just worried about Jiang Luoli going back alone.

Moreover, she must have encountered something urgent to suddenly return to her hometown.

But he couldn’t contact her now. Even if he was worried, he could only call her when she got off the plane.

...

Two hours later, Jiang Luoli got off the plane.

She saw that Mo Shixiu had called her and called him back.

Soon, Mo Shixiu picked it up.

“Luoli.” The man’s gentle voice came from the phone.

“I saw that you called me. What’s the matter?”

Jiang Luoli waved for a taxi.

Her hometown was in a small county city, and she had to take another hour to get to the bus station. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Mm, I went home and didn’t see you. I heard from Sister Lin that you went back to your hometown?”

“You’re home?” Jiang Luoli was stunned.

“Mm. The house feels a little empty without you around.”

Jiang Luoli’s heart raced.

Mo Shixiu was really...

Jiang Luoli felt much better after hearing what he said. She pursed her lips and smiled. “Mo Shixiu, I realize that you’re getting better at sweet-talking. Did someone teach you?”

“Mm?” Mo Shixiu seemed to be laughing too. His low laughter reached Jiang Luoli’s ears with a hint of affection and gentleness.

“You’re getting better at coaxing people?”

“How am I coaxing you?”

“Weren’t you...” Jiang Luoli thought that Mo Shixiu didn’t even know what flirting meant and felt that she was overthinking.

Mo Shixiu wasn’t coaxing her.

He really felt that the house was too quiet.

But Jiang Luoli still felt comforted.

Because Mo Shixiu didn’t know how to sweet talk, his words weren’t just to coax her.

She smiled again. “Mo Shixiu, it seems like I’m very important to you. When I’m not around, you feel that the house is empty. Weren’t you alone when I wasn’t with you? Moreover, there’s Sister Lin and the rest at home. Why is it empty?”

“Mm, you’re very important.” Mo Shixiu’s voice was still gentle. “Sister Lin and the rest are different from you. I used to be alone, but now I have you.”

Jiang Luoli was speechless.

Could he not speak to her in such a serious tone?

Her heart started racing uncontrollably again.

“Luoli, why are you home? Did something urgent happen at home? Do you need my help?” Mo Shixiu paused and said, “If you need help, I can arrange for someone to go over.”

Jiang Luoli thought about what Mother Jiang said over the phone and frowned. Her mood inevitably worsened.

But she didn’t want Mo Shixiu to worry. She took a deep breath and calmed herself down. “I can settle the mess at home myself. If I can’t, I’ll tell you.”

“Mm, that’s good. Luoli, we’re already a couple.”
