Chapter 301: My Baby Is Going to Be Famous

He already put it this way, what else could the rest of them say.

Everyone knew Bai Yusheng’s temper.

If they continued probing, he was going to lose it. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

And when he really did lose his temper, he didn’t let anyone off, regardless of who it was.

Everyone immediately kept quiet.

Bai Yusheng was satisfied by how they knew their place. He turned around and looked at Qiao Mianmian, who still seemed to be in shock. “Go back and wait for further instructions. Do well and don’t disappoint me.”

Qiao Mianmian walked out of the audition room.

Jiang Luoli immediately went to her. “How did it go? How did it go?”

Qiao Mianmian seemed to be a little dazed, but there was a shine in her eyes and some excitement in her voice she couldn’t hide. “Make a guess?”

“You succeeded?” Jiang Luoli could read her expression.

Qiao Mianmian smiled. “Mm! Luo Luo, I finally did it! Director Bai said it’s decided that I’ll play the third female role and told me to just await further instructions.”

“Wow, that’s amazing! Baby, your time has come, you’re going to be famous!” Jiang Luoli got excited for her too and instinctively hugged her tight. “I knew it, I knew you’d succeed! Big Brother Bai likes to look out for newbies. He definitely couldn’t have missed you!

“If he could decide on you on the spot, it shows that he’s really satisfied with you. This is so amazing, my Baby is going to be famous! Ah, I’m so happy for you!”

Jiang Luoli was genuinely happy for her.

Qiao Mianmian was born to be in the entertainment industry.

But she just hadn’t been able to make her mark.

She wasn’t even considered a proper actress in the field.

Meanwhile, Qiao Anxin, who was inferior to her in every way, was already a first-tier artiste.

This was too unfair.

Her Baby was so many times better than Qiao Anxin. If her baby had the same resources, she’d have been so popular by now.

She just couldn’t take it that the shameless Qiao Anxin was doing better than her Baby.

It upset her.

How could a despicable mistress who snatched someone else’s fiancé manage to live so well?

She deserved to be despised and insulted by everyone!

Qiao Mianmian hugged Jiang Luoli back. She was so agitated, she almost choked on her words. “Mm, I’m really happy too. Luo Luo, thank you. Thank you for all your help. It’s thanks to you that I managed to get past this audition.

“I must’ve saved the whole galaxy in my past life to deserve a friend like you.”

Qiao Mianmian really wondered what she’d done sometimes.

What exactly had she done to have a friend like Jiang Luoli?

Her biological sister wasn’t even anything like that.

A sister like Qiao Anxin was worse than an ordinary friend.

It seemed like God wasn’t too mean to her.

Although she’d been betrayed by a scum of a boyfriend and had to deal with Qiao Anxin and her equally terrible mother, God did give her many nice people too.

Qiao Chen, Jiang Luoli, and also Mo Yesi...

They were all making up for those voids.

With them, her life could still be wonderful.

As for the other detestable people, she could just ignore them like they were trash.

“Baby, why are you being so civil with me? We’re already so close! Didn’t we already have an agreement—when you make it big and rich in the future, you’ve got to support me like I’m your mistress. So, you could say I’m doing this for my own interests too.”
