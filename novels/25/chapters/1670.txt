Chapter 1671: This Plot Is Too Melodramatic

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

It was also because of this that so many people called Shen Xin thick-skinned and harassed her.

“You mean you don’t hate Shen Xin?” The student widened his eyes in shock. “Haven’t you always hated her? Could it be that you don’t hate her because she’s pitiful now?”

“It has nothing to do with now.” Qiao Chen clenched the box in his hand. “I’ve never hated her. I never said I hated her. You all just think so.”

“...”

“If you don’t hate her, why are you so cold to her? You made us think you hate her.”

“Cold?” Qiao Chen looked down at the white wooden box in his hand. “I just don’t want her to feel hopeful. Is it wrong to reject someone like this?”

Because of him, Shen Xin was now being described as such.

He never knew that his rejection would hurt her so much.

So, Shen Xin wanted to transfer schools because she couldn’t stand people talking about her.

Qiao Chen felt guilty at this thought.

“That’s right. If you don’t like someone, it’s best not to give them any hope. But...”

“But what?”

“It’s just that you’re too cold toward Shen Xin. Qiao Chen, honestly, with your attitude towards her, it’s normal for others to think that you hate Shen Xin.”

Qiao Chen kept quiet.

“But Shen Xin is about to transfer schools soon. It doesn’t matter if you hate her or not. It’ll probably be very difficult to see her in the future.” With that, the classmate sighed and said sadly, “We’ve been classmates for a few years, I can’t bear to see her go.”

Qiao Chen kept quiet.

He also couldn’t bear it.

He seemed... reluctant.

If he asked her to stay, would she stay? Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

She’d harassed him for years, and he was used to having her by his side. If she left just like that...

It would probably be very difficult to see her again.

Qiao Chen’s heart ached.

...

“Young Master Chen.”

Qiao Chen walked out of the school and saw a Rolls Royce parked by the roadside. The chauffeur saw him and immediately walked towards him.

The chauffeur bowed and greeted him. “Young Master Chen.”

Qiao Chen nodded. “Didn’t I say that you don’t have to pick me up today?”

“This is what Old Master wants.” The driver immediately explained. “Old Master said that Young Master’s identity is special now. It’s safer for us to follow you wherever you go.”

Qiao Chen pursed his lips and didn’t say anything else.

The chauffeur turned around and opened the door. “Young Master, please get in.”

“Wow, look, that’s Qiao Chen.”

“Was the driver the one who picked him up? And it was a Rolls-Royce. I heard that Qiao Chen is the Young Master of the Mo Family now. It seems like it’s true.”

“I heard that Qiao Chen is the Young Master of the Mo Family’s second branch. It’s said that he separated from the Mo Family because of some reasons and was adopted by the family with the surname Qiao. Now, the Mo Family has found him again and acknowledged him.”

“This plot is too melodramatic.”

Inside the car.

The window slowly rolled up, blocking everything outside.

Qiao Chen looked at the gift Shen Xin gave him and slowly opened it.

He saw a black bracelet and a black and gold ring laying inside.
