Chapter 320: Are you sure she’s from a well-known and well-to-do family?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Shen Rou’s expression was awful.

She’d thought that it was Qiao Chen pursuing Shen Xin.

Her younger sister had such high standards and hadn’t even taken an interest in any of the rich, handsome, and outstanding young men they knew.

Why would she fall for a weak and poor boy?

But upon hearing Qiao Chen’s words and then seeing Shen Xin’s reaction, she started to understand what was going on.

It really was Shen Xin who proactively chased him.

And Qiao Chen really didn’t seem to like her.

Shen Rou immediately felt embarrassed.

She shot Shen Xin a glare and was about to say something when she heard a familiar voice. “Miss Shen, so this is the upbringing of the Shen family. Now I’ve witnessed the supposed etiquette and politeness of a wealthy and powerful family.”

Shen Rou looked up and saw Qiao Mianmian standing right behind Qiao Chen, looking blankly at her.

Qiao Chen was stunned as well. “Sis, w-what are you doing here?”

He widened his eyes, looking badly startled.

He then saw Jiang Luoli as well. He suffered yet another shock. “Luo Luo, you’re here too?”

“Yeah, Chen Chen. I haven’t seen you in a while. Do you miss me?” Jiang Luoli grinned at him.

She looked directly at him.

Qiao Chen was a little embarrassed.

Jiang Luoli knew that this wasn’t the right time to tease him and so did not carry this further.

She looked up and kept her smile as she looked at Shen Rou. She sneered and said, “The Shen family, could this be the richest Shen family in Yuncheng City? Then this must be Young Lady Shen? I heard that Young Lady Shen is a gentle, gracious, and mature woman who’s knowledgeable and courteous. Why is it that the woman I’ve just met turned out to be a crude and insane woman with no proper upbringing and manners at all?

“Baby, are you sure she’s from a well-known and well-to-do family, and not just some nouveau riche household?”

Jiang Luoli had never lost to anyone in an argument.

She was a formidable fighter in this field.

And her favorite thing to do was to tear apart the pretty white lily, to punch the scheming bitch in the gut.

She’d heard part of what Shen Rou said to Qiao Chen.

She was so furious she almost gave Shen Rou two slaps on the face.

What bullshit gracious woman was she.

Her filthy mouth was disgusting.

She actually said that their handsome and adorable Chen Chen was seducing her younger sister and trying to be a part of the rich Shen family.

Ew!

She was way too arrogant. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Did she think that every other person wanted to be a part of them? Their Chen Chen definitely wasn’t one of those people!

She couldn’t believe that this belle, who’d always been known to be mature and elegant, turned out to be someone like that. This was so different from what she’d heard.

It was indeed true that one had to see it to believe it. All other rumors were falsifiable.

Having a belle of this standard was really a disgrace to the other belles.

Qiao Mianmian had never thought of confronting Shen Rou head-on.

After all, Shen Rou was Mo Yesi’s friend. She didn’t want to make things ugly or strain their friendship.

So she hadn’t even told Mo Yesi anything that Shen Rou had said to her.

But now it seemed like she’d been too considerate.

She was clear now that all her concerns were superfluous.
