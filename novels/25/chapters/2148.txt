Chapter 2151: We Can Have Another Daughter

As she spoke, she reached out to touch her stomach with a blissful expression. “I asked Shixiu whether he wants a son or a daughter. He said he wants a daughter more. So, I think my child must be a girl.”

“Everyone says that spicy foods are the best. I really like spicy foods now.”

Qiao Mianmian smiled again. “You can check the gender now. Aren’t you going to?”

“No.” Jiang Luoli shook her head. “There won’t be any surprise after that. Anyway, whether it’s a son or a daughter, the baby will still be my treasure. But if it’s a little princess, it’ll be even more perfect.

“If we don’t check, we can only know the gender when the baby is born. In that case, we can look forward to the entire pregnancy.”

“Mm, you can think of it this way.” Qiao Mianmian nodded and then asked, “Has Big Brother been spending a lot of time with you recently? Is there anything wrong with your pregnancy? I want to accompany you for two more days, but I’m afraid that Big Brother will think I’m a third wheel. Moreover, you know Mo Yesi, he definitely won’t agree to let me stay at your house for too long.”

“Haha.” Jiang Luoli laughed. “If it’s Shixiu, I’m sure he won’t think you’re a third wheel. He’ll be happy to have you accompany me, so he can be more at ease. But…”

Jiang Luoli paused and said teasingly, “I know Prince Charming. He definitely can’t bear for you to be away from him for so long. I don’t want to ruin your sweet life. I’m already very happy that you can come over and accompany me occasionally.”

Jiang Luoli wanted to buy everything she saw. She felt that everything was especially cute.

Although Mo Shixiu didn’t restrict her spending and even encouraged her to spend more, she could still control herself.

She took photos of the clothes, shoes, and toys and sent them to Mo Shixiu. She asked him: [I went out shopping with Mianmian today. The baby products in this shop are so cute. Look at the things I sent you, aren’t they all super cute?]

Mo Shixiu replied quickly. Jiang Luoli received his reply in less than a minute. [Mm, very cute. You like them?]

Jiang Luoli: [I like them. I want to bring them all home.]

Mo Shixiu: [Then buy them all.]

Jiang Luoli: [??? Buy them all? Don’t you think it’s a waste?]

Mo Shixiu: [How is it a waste?]

Jiang Luoli: [I don’t know if the baby is a boy or a girl yet. I’m only looking at the baby’s things. And I bought so many at once. If I give birth to a son in the future, won’t these things become useless? Wouldn’t it be a waste?]

Mo Shixiu: [Mm, it sounds a little wasteful. But I think there’s a solution.]

Jiang Luoli was curious. [What solution?]

Mo Shixiu replied quickly: [We can have another daughter, so it won’t be a waste.]

Jiang Luoli: […]

If she didn’t know Mo Shixiu well, she would think that this man was flirting with her on purpose.

But because she knew him, the image of Mo Shixiu saying this to her with a serious expression immediately appeared in her mind.

So, this man really wanted to have a daughter?

Although Jiang Luoli wasn’t interested in having children at this age, and she was even a little against it, if Mo Shixiu really wanted another child, she would consider it.

Because it was Mo Shixiu, many of her principles could be broken for him.

As long as she felt that it was worth it.

Jiang Luoli thought to herself and replied: [Hmph, wishful thinking. Do you think giving birth is easy? If you give birth, I’ll agree to it.]
