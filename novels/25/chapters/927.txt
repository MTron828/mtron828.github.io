Chapter 928: You Still Have a Rich and Powerful Husband

She owed him more than she thought...

It seemed like it was impossible to return it.

...

Mo Yesi packed up and came out of the kitchen.

Seeing Qiao Mianmian sitting on the sofa in a daze with her cell phone in her hand, looking like she had a lot on her mind, he quickly walked over, sat down beside her, and pulled her into his arms.

“What are you thinking about?” He looked down at her cell phone. “Someone called you just now?”

Qiao Mianmian looked up at him, still confused. “Mm, Sister Xie called me.”

“Your manager? Why did she call you?”

“She told me something about Tu Yilei.”

“That guy with the surname Tu?” Mo Yesi furrowed his brows when he heard his love rival’s name. “What has it got to do with him?”

“Sister Xie told me not to go to the hospital to see him. Otherwise, I’d be in trouble.” Qiao Mianmian was frustrated and needed someone to help her analyze the situation. Hence, she told Mo Yesi everything Linda said.

Mo Yesi was silent for a few seconds before rubbing her head and saying, “Mm, I think what your manager said makes sense. There’s really no need to visit him at the hospital every day. That guy has ill intentions towards you, but he can’t wait for you to take care of him every day. You’re doing this out of gratitude, but he doesn’t think so.”

“But I feel like I owe him too much.” Qiao Mianmian frowned. “He was injured because of me, and it affected his work. Sister Xie said that the male lead role will definitely be replaced. I feel sorry for him.

“You don’t know, but with his current popularity, if he suddenly leaves the public eye, it will have a huge impact on him. Moreover, before his hand recovers, he might not be able to shoot some commercials.

“I really can’t make up for his losses.”

“So, you feel guilty and sorry for him?”

Qiao Mianmian bit her lip and nodded. “Mm.” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Then, let me make it up to him for you,” Mo Yesi said casually. “When he recovers, I’ll give him a better male lead role. As for the financial losses he suffered because of his injuries, I’ll compensate him double.

“I can give him whatever resources he wants in the future. I guarantee that his career won’t be affected by this injury. Moreover, I can make him even more popular.

“In that case, wouldn’t you feel less burdened?”

Qiao Mianmian looked up in shock. “You...”

“Baby, don’t forget that you have a rich and powerful husband.” Mo Yesi smiled. “Didn’t I say that if you can’t solve it, you can get your husband to solve it for you? Although I don’t like that guy, I’m grateful to him for taking the hit for you.

“Don’t worry, I’ll make it up to him.”

To him, this was just a small matter.

It wasn’t worth her trouble.

The thought that she was actually worried about that brat named Tu upset him.

Besides him, she couldn’t think of another man.

Especially that brat with the surname Tu.

That brat actually dared to covet her.

If it wasn’t for his help in blocking the acid, he would have taught him a lesson already.

“You’ll really help him?” Qiao Mianmian finally felt better.
