Chapter 1106: Investigate The Year He Was Born

“It’s such a coincidence in all aspects. How can it be a real coincidence?”

Seeing how agitated the old lady was, Mo Yesi didn’t want to pour cold water on her. He was silent for a while before asking with a smile, “Grandma, what do you mean?”

“Investigate.” The old lady took a deep breath, pinched the string of prayer beads on her wrist, and silently chanted. “Investigate the year he was born. I’ve always felt that your second uncle’s child is definitely still alive. If Qiao Chen is really that child, then God took pity your second uncle.

“From now on, your second uncle will have a descendant.”

Mo Yesi remained silent.

If Qiao Chen was really a member of the Mo family, it was indeed good news for his second uncle.

It was also a surprise.

Because his second uncle was still single, he went to the hospital for a checkup and said that it was because of his health. It would be very difficult for him to have a child.

Especially now that he was older, his reproductive abilities were even worse.

There was almost no chance to have another child.

Although with his status, he could easily adopt a few children from the side family, it was still different since they were not his biological children.

Hence, he didn’t choose adoption.

The old lady had been worrying about this all day.

“Okay.” Although Mo Yesi didn’t think there would be such a coincidence in this world, since the old lady wanted to check, he would just have to do it.

Once she found out the truth, she wouldn’t think about it anymore.

Anyway, this was not a troublesome matter for him.

“Do you think Grandma is overthinking it? But Grandma doesn’t think so. Qiao Chen is very likely to be our Mo family’s child. Otherwise, if he and Mianmian are biological siblings, how could they not look alike at all?

“Even if one resembles his father and the other resembles his mother, surely the siblings have some similarities?

“But he doesn’t look like Mianmian at all. They’re siblings from the same parents. Don’t you think it’s abnormal?” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The old lady got excited again.

Although she wasn’t completely sure that Qiao Chen was that child, she felt that there was a sixty percent chance that it was.

She had always been worried that her second son would have no children.

If Qiao Chen was really her second son’s lost child, she would be able to put an end to her worries.

Hence, she had to clarify this matter.

Even if she was overthinking, she had to figure it out.

Mo Yesi naturally noticed what the Old Madam said.

Qiao Mianmian and Qiao Chen were indeed not alike.

“Grandma, don’t be too agitated.” Mo Yesi was really worried that if the Old Madam got agitated, her old illness would return. He sat down beside the Old Madam, held her hand, and said with a smile, “It’s not impossible. That child was only carried away by someone back then. No one knows where he went.

“He might still be alive.

“It could be Qiao Chen.

“But don’t get your hopes up. Don’t think too highly of this matter.”

Mo Yesi thought about it and said, “When we get back, I’ll get Wei Zheng to find someone to investigate.”

The old madam nodded. “En, investigate properly. Investigate carefully, don’t just casually do it.”
