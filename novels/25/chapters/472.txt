Chapter 473: The Way He Smiles Is Creepy

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Haha, yet another old, unoriginal trick.

Pretending that her cell phone ran out of battery, asking him for his cell phone just so she could add herself as a contact.

She could have just asked him for his contact.

Tsk, women these days were always thinking of plotting against men.

On the account of his Sis-in-law, he decided not to expose her.

He handed her his cell phone with a smile. “Of course. You can send as many messages as you need.”

Jiang Luoli took the cell phone and flashed him a bright smile. “Thank you, Mr. Yan.”

Yan Shaoqing thought: Ha, still trying to flirt with me?

At this point, Jiang Luoli was thinking: Gosh, this man is pretty good-looking, but the way he smiles is creepy.

Jiang Luoli took his cell phone and quickly searched for Mo Yesi’s number, under the strange-looking eyes of this man. She sent a message: [Prince Charming, it’s Jiang Luoli. Baby is in Private Room 523 of Twinkling Moonlight, fetch her from there if you’ve got the time. She doesn’t seem to be in a good mood today, and she’s a little tipsy from drinking. I have something on at the last minute and can’t stay with her, but I’m worried about her going home on her own. If you aren’t free, get someone to fetch her then.]

Jiang Luoli sent this message, and within the next few seconds, Mo Yesi called.

She got a shock when the cell phone rang.

And she got even more agitated when she saw that it was Mo Yesi. She immediately picked it up. “P-Prince Charming?” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Hearing her call the other party “Prince Charming,” Yan Shaoqing furrowed his brows a little.

Whose call did this woman pick up?

It was a man on the other line?

And she was calling him Prince Charming in front of Yan Shaoqing himself?

Was this another trick of hers?

Perhaps she was trying to make him think that she had another suitor and wanted him to try harder?

Ha, it must be the case.

This woman didn’t seem like the very intelligent sort, but she sure was scheming.

Her tricks came one after another.

A low voice could be heard. “Mm, you said Mianmian is at Twinkling Moonlight?”

“Yes.”

“She’s drunk?”

“A little.”

“Are you with Yan Shaoqing now?”

“Yes.”

“Hand him the cell phone, I’ll speak to him.”

“Okay.” Jiang Luoli looked up, only to be met with Yan Shaoqing’s weird expression. She handed him the cell phone right away. “Mr. Yan, he’s asking for you.”

Yan Shaoqing was shocked. “Me?”

Jiang Luoli nodded. “Mm.”

Yan Shaoqing looked at her a little deeper, as if trying to guess her intentions.

He took over the cell phone and was immediately stunned when he heard the other party’s voice.

A minute later, he hung up.

He looked at Jiang Luoli oddly. “You borrowed my cell phone to send Second Bro a message?”

“Mm. He and Mianmian have some misunderstanding between them, so I came up with a lie to get him to come over. So, what did he say on the phone? Is he coming over?”

“He told me to get the clubhouse to watch Sis-in-law. He’ll be right over.”

“That’s good.” Jiang Luoli was finally at ease now. With her task completed, she was ready to leave.
