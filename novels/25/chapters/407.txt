Su Ze quietly and slowly walked to the couch and sat beside his mother. “I personally took her to the hospital for a check-up yesterday. She’s really pregnant. Mom, the child Anxin is carrying is your grandson. Even if you don’t like her, could you agree to let her join our family on the account of your grandson?

“Wouldn’t the baby be very pitiful if he’s born into an incomplete family?”

Mother Su was a little shocked. “You took her to the hospital yesterday?”

“Yes.” Su Ze decided to speak the truth. “Actually, I had my doubts about this too. That’s why I took her to the hospital for a proper check-up. But she didn’t lie to me. She really is pregnant with my child.

“Mom, I can’t deny her of a status.

“Anxin is willing to carry my child at this ascending stage of her career. That shows that she’s true to me. How many female celebrities in the industry would be able to do this? She’s done so much for me, I can’t let her down.

“Take it that I’m begging you, let me marry her. If you don’t like her, I’ll just bring her around less.”

Mother Su looked at her son for a while and then sighed. “Ah Ze, let Mom ask you a question. You have to answer me very honestly.”

Su Ze nodded. “Go ahead, Mom.”

“Do you really not have any feelings for Mianmian anymore?”

Su Ze froze.

“Did you break up with her because you don’t like her anymore? Or is it because you had to be responsible for Qiao Anxin, so you had no choice but to break up with Mianmian?”

Su Ze’s expression darkened a little, and he didn’t say anymore.

He’d thought about this question before when he was alone.

And it wasn’t just once.

He’d felt oddly anxious about this ever since he knew that Qiao Mianmian was together with that man, Mo Yesi.

Although he’d been rather upset when Qiao Mianmian initiated the breakup, he didn’t remember feeling this afraid and lost.

Perhaps he’d always assumed that Qiao Mianmian still loved him even after they’d broken up.

They had known each other for 10 years, she couldn’t possibly just stop loving him overnight.

Neither could she fall for another man so easily.

Moreover, he had been very confident that Qiao Mianmian would never meet another man more outstanding than he was.

Having had such a fiancé, she’d be very picky when she chose her future partner.

Not many men would be able to catch her eye.

Su Ze even thought that Qiao Mianmian would regret her decision.

And then turn to him for reconciliation.

He’d thought it through before. If she really came back to look for him, he still wouldn’t be able to get back together with her. But as long as she wasn’t asking for the title of Young Madam Su, he could give her anything she wanted.

He would still dote on her as he did before.

He just couldn’t marry her.

This had gone through his mind countless times.

He was still waiting for her to ask for a reconciliation.

But who would’ve expected the sudden appearance of this man by the name of Mo Yesi?

Although that man was just a relative of the renowned Mo family, his income must be pretty good as a high-post employee in the Mo Corporation. What’s more, he was exceptionally handsome.

Even as a man himself, Su Ze had to admit that Mo Yesi’s looks were the most outstanding amongst everyone he knew in the industry.
