Chapter 471: Why Don’t We Go on a Date?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Qiao Mianmian smiled. “Your flowers... what?”

Yan Shaoqing looked about, and his eyes landed on Jiang Luoli sitting on the couch. He was slightly stunned at first, but his eyes soon lit up, and he smiled. “They’re for this beauty here with you.”

With that, he walked over and took the bouquet of roses off Qiao Mianmian’s hands, and walked to Jiang Luoli slowly. He gave her a charming smile and said alluringly, “Miss, I knew I’d sunk too deep the moment I saw you. Your looks have entranced me, and I’m mad about you now. This bouquet of flowers represent my feelings for you, will you accept it?”

With that, he handed the roses to Jiang Luoli and looked at her deeply.

Yan Shaoqing came from a good family, was good-looking, and had a glib tongue. If he was set on impressing a woman, it was practically impossible to not fall for him.

Having been confessed to out of nowhere, and by such a hunk at that, Jiang Luoli was stunned for a few seconds. She pointed to herself and asked, “These flowers... are for me?”

“Yes.” Yan Shaoqing sounded extremely gentle and seductive.

“But, the waiter said it was for Mianmian.” Jiang Luoli hadn’t lost her rationality yet. She exposed him immediately.

Yan Shaoqing was speechless.

His expression stiffened for a while, but he soon broke into an attractive grin. “It was my mistake. I actually noticed you right from the start, but I didn’t know when was a good time to approach you, and I was afraid flirting out of nowhere would scare you off. When I heard the singing coming from your private room, I thought it was you. So...”

At this point, Yan Shaoqing felt that he was a genius.

He actually came up with such an amazing excuse!

The excuse was fool-proof.

Hahaha, he was too smart. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

What he didn’t know was that the two other people in the private room were looking at him as if he was a fool.

Did Young Master Yan think they were gullible kids?

He actually used such a terrible excuse to deal with them.

But since he enjoyed acting so much, they’d just watch him quietly.

“So, do you know what I feel towards you now?” Yan Shaoqing continued as sincerely as he could. “Give me a chance, let me prove my love for you. Alright?”

“Sure.” Jiang Luoli took the flowers from him and agreed.

Seeing how quick she was to agree, Yan Shaoqing feigned surprise. “You accept me?”

Jiang Luoli was still smiling. “Yup, didn’t you ask for me to give you a chance to prove yourself?”

“... Yes.”

“Then, what are you waiting for?”

Jiang Luoli rested the flowers on her arms and looked at him. “It’s time to prove with your actions. You should start right now. Hmm, since it’s still early, how about we go on a date?”

Yan Shaoqing was speechless.

The smile slowly disappeared from his face.

“N-Now?”

“Yup. Is there a problem?”

Since he’d just confessed to her, Yan Shaoqing couldn’t possibly say there was a problem with it.

He looked at Jiang Luoli’s bright and beautiful face, and immediately felt a pull in his heart. “N-No problem. But this is so last minute, I haven’t prepared anything. Isn’t it a little too rushed? I don’t want our first date to be so sloppy, how about another day...”
