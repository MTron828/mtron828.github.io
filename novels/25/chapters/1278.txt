Chapter 1281: Do You Think She’s a Good Person?

Qiao Anxin was stunned and couldn’t help but look at Qiao Mianmian.

She bit her lip, her eyes full of hatred.

Even if she failed this time, she wouldn’t let Qiao Mianmian, this slut, have the chance to become a phoenix.

“I don’t know.”

She lied. “Everything was arranged by Shen Rou. I just followed her instructions. I don’t know anything.”

Bai Yusheng naturally didn’t believe her.

His eyes turned even colder. “You don’t know, or you don’t want to say?”

“Young Master Bai, I really don’t know.” Qiao Anxin held back the fear in her heart and looked away from Qiao Mianmian. She lowered her head and didn’t dare to look at Bai Yusheng. “I’m just helping Shen Rou. I’ll do whatever she asks me to do.

“I really don’t know anything else.”

“Do you think we won’t know if you don’t say it?”

Bai Yusheng didn’t look at her anymore and walked towards Qiao Mianmian. “Mianmian, I suspect that they took your blood to appraise it. So, I want to do it again. Can you...”

“Yusheng, I’ve already gotten Mianmian to do the test.” Madam Bai looked at Qiao Anxin coldly. “We’ll get the results in a few hours.”

Qiao Anxin looked up.

They actually did a paternity test for Qiao Mianmian?

Qiao Anxin knew very well whose blood she used.

She knew very well who the real daughter of the Bai family was.

She thought that if she didn’t say it, the Bai family wouldn’t know.

But now, the Bai family actually got Qiao Mianmian to do a paternity test.

Qiao Mianmian was the real daughter of the Bai family.

Once the paternity test results were out, the truth would be revealed.

It didn’t matter if she said it or not. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Qiao Anxin’s expression darkened.

Why did she become like this when she’d already succeeded?

Why was Qiao Mianmian able to get what she wanted so easily even though she didn’t do anything?

Why!!

Why was God so unfair to her?

She could no longer suppress her jealousy and anger.

Qiao Anxin suddenly exploded.

She turned around and glared at Qiao Mianmian. “Yes, that’s right. Qiao Mianmian is the real daughter of the Bai family. I took her blood for the DNA test. But so what?

“You think I’m bad. Do you think she’s a good person?

“Do you think the scandals online are all false accusations? She’s the best at pretending to be innocent and harmless. It’s as if she didn’t do anything wrong. It’s always someone else’s fault. Someone else is always harming her and bullying her.

“But she’s not what you think she is!”

She was indignant.

Why was Qiao Mianmian better than her in every way?

When she was younger, she was in the same school as Qiao Mianmian. They were obviously sisters, but the one everyone praised the most was always Qiao Mianmian.

They praised Qiao Mianmian for her looks, her grades, and her personality.

She wasn’t bad.

She received a lot of praise and many people liked her.

But once she was with Qiao Mianmian, she would be ignored.
