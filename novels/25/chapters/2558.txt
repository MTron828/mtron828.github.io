Chapter 2559: His Reaction Is Too Calm

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Mianmian.” Mo Yesi felt the warmth and strength of her fingertips and called her gently.

Qiao Mianmian replied softly, “Mm?”

“When we’re old, will you still blow my hair like this?”

“Mm?” Qiao Mianmian was stunned for a while before smiling. “Of course. When I’m old, will you keep blowing my hair?”

“Mm.” Mo Yesi’s thick black eyelashes fluttered as he slowly opened his eyes. His dark eyes were like stars in the night sky, and his gaze was gentle and intoxicating. “Of course.”

Mo Yesi’s hair was black and shiny.

The kind that wouldn’t need any special effects in a shampoo commercial.

It was especially good to the touch. His hair was soft and fine, like silk.

The shampoo he used had a faint minty scent. The warm wind blew at the ends of his hair, and the pleasant fragrance entered Qiao Mianmian’s nostrils.

She looked down at Mo Yesi and couldn’t help but feel curious.

After a while, she couldn’t help but ask, “Mo Yesi, do you know…”

“Mm? Know what?”

The man was curious.

Qiao Mianmian pursed her lips and said, “Shen Rou was in a car accident and is seriously injured. Do you know about this?”

Mo Yesi had known Shen Rou for over 20 years.

Although they were strangers now, Mo Yesi probably still had some feelings for her.

But from the moment he entered the bedroom until now, Qiao Mianmian couldn’t see anything different about him.

It was as if he didn’t know about Shen Rou’s accident.

Mo Yesi’s eyes flickered. A few seconds later, he nodded and replied, “Mm, I saw the news. Shaoqing just called me to tell me about it.”

But his reaction was too calm.

“You knew she was in a car accident?”

“Mm, I knew.”

“You… don’t have any thoughts?” Qiao Mianmian was really curious.

Mo Yesi looked up at her. “Thoughts? What thoughts would I have?”

“It’s just that you’ve known each other for so many years and used to be good friends. I heard that… her condition is critical, and her heartbeat stopped twice during the rescue. If… if she’s not rescued, will you be a little sad?”

She asked this purely out of curiosity.

She wasn’t jealous at all.

Moreover, she felt that even if Mo Yesi was upset, she could understand.

“Sad?” Mo Yesi was stunned for a few seconds.

The man narrowed his eyes and didn’t answer her immediately, as if he was seriously considering her question.

Qiao Mianmian waited for a while, then Mo Yesi said indifferently, “If she didn’t do those things to you, we could be considered friends. I might have felt sad.

“But she hurt you again and again. She’s no longer my friend, and my friendship with her has long been exhausted.. Mianmian, I gave her a few chances previously, but she still insisted.”
