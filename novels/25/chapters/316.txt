Chapter 317: Are All You Qiao Family Members So Shameless?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Shen Xin was a little afraid of her sister, but she kept her head up indignantly. “No, I’m not.”

She then turned around to look at Qiao Chen, ignoring Shen Rou’s darkened expression. She smiled at Qiao Chen and said, “Student Qiao, ignore my sister. Let’s get seated and order our food. This place is known for...”

She introduced Qiao Chen to the place’s signature dishes.

But she was just starting out when she felt a sharp pain on her wrist. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Shen Rou’s eyes were filled with flames of fury as she dragged her out of her seat. “Shen Xin, I’m telling you to go back with me now!”

Shen Xin’s skin was rather tender, and her wrist turned a bright red from this grappling. Her eyes also got red and teary as she yelled, “Sis, it hurts. Let go of me!”

Shen Rou did not flinch. Instead, she pulled even harder and tried to get her out of the restaurant.

“Sis, let go of me. It hurts, it really hurts...” Shen Xin was struggling and on the verge of tears.

Shen Rou didn’t seem to realize it, though.

But a while later, she felt someone’s hand on her arm too.

“Miss Shen, please hold on.” Qiao Chen had no idea why, but he couldn’t bear to see Shen Xin’s tears.

He hadn’t even expected himself to do this.

Shen Rou stiffened.

A few seconds later, she turned around slowly.

Qiao Chen released her arm the moment she stopped moving.

“This... Student Qiao, do you have anything to say?” Shen Rou glared at him coldly and with some hatred.

Qiao Chen saw that she was still grabbing Shen Xin’s wrist tightly and hesitated for a while before politely saying, “Miss Shen, Shen Xin’s wrist is already turning red, and she said that it hurts. Shouldn’t you be letting go of her?”

Shen Xin looked up at him in shock.

It was as if she never expected him to help her out.

After all, she was an annoying girl in his eyes, and he never really had a good impression of her.

“And how’s that your business?” Shen Rou sounded overbearing. “This is between my sister and me. Don’t you feel like a busybody here?”

Shen Xin looked at Shen Rou in confusion.

She was completely shocked and baffled by her sister.

This elder sister of hers had always been very particular about etiquette and manners and always presented herself gracefully and elegantly.

No matter who she spoke to, it was always with politeness and gentleness.

This was the first time Shen Xin had seen her sister speak so rudely to anyone.

And this person was her classmate.

She’d brought classmates home before.

But Shen Rou had never acted this way.

Why was she so rude and harsh to Qiao Chen?

This wasn’t like her at all.

Qiao Chen was stunned too. He looked at Shen Xin with a flurry of emotions in his eyes and then took a deep breath. “Shen Xin is my classmate. I don’t think I’m being a busybody here. She’s your biological sister, but you shouldn’t be treating her like this.

“Miss Shen, please let go of her.”

Shen Rou pursed her lips and eyed Qiao Chen deviously. She suddenly smirked and said, “Are all you Qiao family members so shameless?”

“What did you say?” Qiao Chen’s expression changed instantly.

Vengeance seeped into Shen Rou’s eyes.

Qiao Mianmian had already taken her beloved man away from her.

And now she wanted her brother with a heart condition to seduce her sister and take advantage of the Shen family?
