She teased. “I think he’s about as good as your ex-male crush, Mo Shixiu.”

She’d seen Mo Shixiu on television before.

“As good as Mo Shixiu?” Jiang Luoli seemed more serious now. “Are you sure? You aren’t lying to me? He’s that handsome?”

Qiao Mianmian nodded. “Mm, I’m sure.”

How could she not be sure?

She was referring to Mo Shixiu himself!

She wondered how Jiang Luoli would react if she really got to meet Mo Shixiu in person. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

She wouldn’t dare to be so star-struck and silly in front of him.

After all, as handsome as Mo Shixiu was, he was the serious sort of man that intimidated the rest in his department.

Even if they were greeted with that sort of handsome face, it would be hard not to stagger back when they sensed the coldness around him.

“Is he still single?”

Qiao Mianmian didn’t want to confirm things so soon. “I guess so.”

She hadn’t heard of him having a girlfriend before.

Moreover, he was always so busy traveling. He probably didn’t have time to date anyone.

Jiang Luoli grabbed Qiao Mianmian’s hand across the table and said very seriously, “Baby, if you knew of such a good deal beforehand, why haven’t you told me about it earlier?

“If you married your Prince Charming while I married his brother, we’d be in-laws. Best friends becoming sisters-in-law, isn’t that great?

“When we become a family, we’ll be even closer than we are now, don’t you think?”

Qiao Mianmian replied, “... Mm.”

“So, for the sake of my lifetime happiness, and for our friendship to be even stronger, you’ve got to help your best friend.”

Qiao Mianmian looked at Jiang Luoli’s serious expression and couldn’t tell if she was kidding or not.

If possible, she would want Jiang Luoli as her in-law too.

This was probably the best sisters-in-law relationship anyone could have.

But, Jiang Luoli and Mo Shixiu?

It didn’t seem like the best pairing...

Jiang Luoli was so loud and candid and enjoyed the thrill and excitement. Would she like a serious and stern man like Mo Shixiu?

Moreover, if she wanted to introduce them to each other, she’d have to ask Mo Yesi if Mo Shixiu was really single, to begin with, and what other considerations he might have.

“Luo Luo, are you being serious?” Qiao Mianmian asked. “You really want to know his brother?”

“I do.”

Jiang Luoli grinned. “A man on the same level as Mo Shixiu must be a hunk. I definitely want to know him. Even if he doesn’t fall for me and we can’t be a couple, it’s not a bad thing to be friends with him.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

Alright, it seemed like Jiang Luoli wasn’t entirely serious.

She just wanted to know a handsome guy.

After seeing through her, Qiao Mianmian couldn’t be bothered to entertain her further.

“Eh?”

Jiang Luoli was looking at the decor of the restaurant, but a shocked expression took over when she saw a familiar silhouette.

She widened her eyes and shook Qiao Mianmian’s forearm. “Mianmian, look at that. Is that Chen Chen?”
