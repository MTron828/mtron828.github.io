Chapter 1677: Just Waiting for You to Enter

“This family has never had a day of peace since she came!

“She sowed discord in front of Mom and Ah Si, making them have something against me. I’ve become a villain in this family. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“In front of Ah Si, I’m an evil mother-in-law who doesn’t treat his wife well. In front of Old Madam, I’m also an evil mother-in-law who wants to go against her daughter-in-law.

“What sin did I commit for my son to marry such a jinx? My family is in chaos because of her.”

Madam Mo’s eyes reddened as she spoke.

She held Tang Ya’s hand and cried. “Xiao Ya, you kept persuading me to come back. Now you see, I don’t have a place in this house anymore. I shouldn’t have come back!”

Tang Ya’s eyes flickered. “Madam, it’s because they have a misunderstanding about you. I saw your daughter-in-law just now. She doesn’t seem like a scheming person.”

“If she’s obviously scheming, then is she really scheming?” Madam Mo gritted her teeth as she spoke about Qiao Mianmian. “She’s just good at acting and pretending. She looks innocent and harmless, that’s why Ah Si and Old Madam were duped by her.

“She caused so much trouble in my family, and now I’m the sinner. She’s the most scheming one.

“In any case, I can’t stay in this family anymore.” Madam Mo was angry and aggrieved. “It’s fine if I’m aggrieved, but now I’ve made you suffer too. I really feel bad.”

“Madam, don’t say that. I really don’t feel aggrieved,” Tang Ya hurriedly said.

“The more you say this, the more I feel bad.” Madam Mo got angrier the more she thought about it. She wiped the corners of her eyes and said angrily, “Let’s go. I won’t come back here anymore.”

“Madam, you’re already back. Even if you want to leave, you should leave after the banquet.” Tang Ya handed her a handkerchief and persuaded her softly. “If you leave just like that, they’ll think you’re guilty.

“Madam, you didn’t do anything wrong. This is your home, why are you leaving?

“You said it yourself, your daughter-in-law is deliberately trying to sow discord. If Madam leaves, wouldn’t she be happy?”

Madam Mo was stunned for a while before gritting her teeth and sneering. “That’s right, you’re right. I can’t just leave. Why should I? This is my home. I won’t let that jinx have her way!

“She must be dying for me to leave, so I won’t.”

“Yes.” Tang Ya lowered her eyes. “Madam, don’t fall for it. Think about it carefully. She first tried to drive a wedge between you and Mr. Mo, then Old Madam, and then you left home in anger.

“Doesn’t this look like it was planned? She’s just waiting for you to fall into her trap.”

Madam Mo thought about what happened and her expression changed.

Tang Ya glanced at her expression and paused for a few seconds before saying softly, “Madam fell for her scheme because of her true nature. Now that you’re in such a mess with Mr. Mo and Old Madam, it’s really not worth it.

“Madam, the more you create trouble, the more it will affect your relationship with Mr. Mo and Old Madam.”

“Then, what do you think I should do?” Madam Mo asked anxiously. “Ah Si and Old Madam are ignoring me now. How would I know she was so scheming?”
