Chapter 1836: Everyone Was Scolding Her

Moreover, it said that she was especially scheming. When she was pushed by fans, they said that she fell on purpose.

That she wanted to flirt with Zhan Bo.

Even the “thank you” she had said to Zhan Bo was described as coquettish.

Also, she looked at Zhan Bo normally, but in the news, she was flirting with Zhan Bo.

Qiao Mianmian was furious!

In order to get more views, these reporters were really shameless.

Speaking of which, Qiao Mianmian was considered an oddity in the industry.

This was because she was still considered a newbie. However, any news related to her, regardless of whether it was the click rate or the reposts of the comments below, was as popular as A-list celebrities.

The news was posted half an hour ago.

When she clicked on it, there were already tens of thousands of reposts and comments.

Qiao Mianmian knew that there wouldn’t be anything good in the comments section, but she still clicked on it. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Then, she was so angry that she almost died on the spot.

The comments section did not disappoint her at all. Once there was negative news about her, there would be a lot of criticism.

The hot comments were all scolding her.

Roly fat doll: “Qiao Mianmian is too shameless. She flirted with Tu Yilei and then Qin Han. Now that her collaboration with Qin Han is over, she’s flirting with our Zhan Bo. B*tch Qiao, please stay away from our Zhan Bo. He’s still a child. Don’t pollute him.”

Sweet and sour: “Oh my, it’s obvious that she fell on purpose. She even fell in front of Zhan Bo. I want to know why a woman who already has a boyfriend is still so restless. She goes everywhere to flirt with young men. Isn’t her boyfriend afraid of the green grassland above his head? Does she think that she has unparalleled charm and can take down anyone? Can she please walk further away? Our Zhan Bo doesn’t like this type.”

Everyone was responsible for boycotting B*tch Qiao: “Previously, there was news that B*tch Qiao had dated several boyfriends in high school and even had an abortion. Later on, it was said to be some kind of rumor. I think this might not be true. It was her nature to like to flirt with men. Now, it’s just that her nature has been exposed. I’m not worried that Zhan Bo will fall for such a scheming b*tch. Zhan Bo isn’t stupid. Just based on her looks, she wants to seduce him. He’s not that shallow.”

Polio: “Please be a human, B*tch Qiao. Let Zhan Bo go. You already have a boyfriend. How can you still flirt with men all day long?”

Kind and Sweet: “She didn’t fall earlier or later, but when Zhan Bo was passing. What a coincidence. It’s hard to believe that she didn’t do it on purpose.”

There were many similar comments.

Most of the people scolding Qiao Mianmian were Zhan Bo’s fans.

Of course, there were also some haters.

Because Qiao Mianmian had already seen a few familiar anti-fan accounts.

Previously, in every negative news about her, a few anti-fans left comments in the comments section.

Those anti-fan accounts had long been banned.

These were definitely newly registered.

Qiao Mianmian was furious at first, but she calmed down soon after.

Zhan Bo’s fans definitely didn’t know the whole story. They were easily led by others.

If there was anyone to blame, it would be her terrible reputation.

Moreover, if she didn’t know what exactly happened back then, as a passerby or fan, she would easily believe what the news said just by looking at the description.
