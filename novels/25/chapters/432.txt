Chapter 435: Then Why Did You Seduce Me at That Time?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

But the Su Ze today was indifferent towards all her tactics.

She felt a strong sense of anxiousness. “Brother Ah Ze, what’s wrong with you? Please don’t tell me you’re still suspecting that I’m the culprit behind that post? I told you I really didn’t do it. My sister is a very important person to me, why would I do such a thing to her?”

In the past, Qiao Anxin only had to drop a few tears and put up a pitiful and soft front and Su Ze would immediately believe everything she said.

Because she was always a kind, gentle, and soft woman in need of protection in his eyes.

And he was the only one that she could depend on.

Even if she lied to the whole world, she wouldn’t ever lie to him.

This was what Su Ze believed for many years.

But only for him to realize that he was a dumbass all this time.

Once there was a break in the trust, you would start suspecting everything else.

If Qiao Anxin could lie to him about her pregnancy, she could lie to him about everything else.

Maybe, she wasn’t as soft and weak as he thought.

And everything that she showed him might not be her true self.

“Mianmian is really important to you?” Su Ze coldly asked.

“Yes,” Qiao Anxin immediately answered. “I only have one sister. Of course, she’s really important to me.”

Su Ze stared straight at her. “Then, why did you seduce me at that time?” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Wha... What?” Qiao Anxin was dumbfounded.

Su Ze narrowed his eyes. “If it wasn’t for you seducing me so aggressively again and again, I wouldn’t even consider getting together with you. You said that Mianmian is really important to you, but you actually seduced her fiancé behind her back.

“Aren’t you afraid that she would be heartbroken if she knew this? And that she would cut off all ties with you?”

Su Ze started getting more quick-witted ever since he found out that he was being tricked.

As he slowly recalled all the events that happened after he got to know Qiao Anxin, he slowly realized that he was being tricked the more he thought about it.

The first time he slept with Qiao Anxin he was really drunk, and she sent him home and took care of him the whole night.

When he woke up the next day, he saw Qiao Anxin lying beside him fully naked.

Because he was so drunk that night, he couldn’t even remember what happened.

So, naturally, when he saw that scene the moment he woke up, he immediately thought that he made a mistake while drunk and slept with his future sister-in-law.

He was even filled with guilt.

Qiao Anxin later told him that she also had too much to drink that night and everything that happened between them was mutually consented. But she didn’t want to hurt Qiao Mianmian, so she told him that he didn’t need to take any responsibility for it and even asked him to treat everything like a dream.

The more gentle and understanding Qiao Anxin was, the more guilty he felt.

That made him want to make it up to her even more.

That was how they started interacting a lot more privately.

Things then slowly started to get out of control.

But now Su Ze seriously suspected that they might not even have really slept together that night.

If he was so drunk that he couldn’t even find the strength to walk properly, how would he even have the strength to do something like that?

His continuous questioning flabbergasted Qiao Anxin.

She was dazed for a moment before realizing that Su Ze was really suspecting her this time.

Qiao Anxin panicked.

She didn’t expect Su Ze to lose all his trust in her over such a small matter.

And even start suspecting her for everything that happened.

Panic flashed in her eyes as she hurriedly moved forward, trying to grab his hand. “Brother Ah Ze, I just couldn’t help it because I loved you too much at that time. You know how much I care for you.”

She tried to grab his hand but ended up grabbing the air.
