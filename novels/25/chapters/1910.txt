Chapter 1911: Old Madam Was Overjoyed

New wives all received wedding gifts.

Madam Mo had taken it before, and so had Qiao Mianmian.

Now that she was married to Mo Shixiu, she couldn’t be the only one who didn’t receive it.

Unless the Mo Family did not accept her.

That was why Jiang Luoli didn’t reject Old Madam when she said that she wanted to prepare a wedding gift for her.

“Grandma, I have something else to tell you.” Mo Shixiu put his arm around Jiang Luoli and walked to the side, asking her to sit down first. Jiang Luoli was still hesitating when Mo Shixiu pressed her shoulder and made her sit down.

Old Madam looked at the two of them in confusion. “Something else to tell me? What is it? Quickly tell Grandma, don’t keep me in suspense.”

Mo Shixiu chuckled. “Don’t worry, Grandma. I’ll tell you right away. You’re going to be a great-grandmother soon. Are you happy?” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

The old lady was stunned. “Great-grandmother?”

A few seconds later, the old lady’s eyes widened. Her eyes were filled with joy as she said excitedly, “Luoli, is Luoli pregnant?”

“Yes, Luoli is pregnant.” Mo Shixiu nodded.

“Is Luoli really carrying the bloodline of our Mo Family?!”

The old lady stood up excitedly.

Uncle Zhang quickly went over to support her. “Old Madam, be careful. You’ve just been discharged from the hospital. The doctor said that you still need to recuperate for a while.”

The old lady was very excited.

“I’m fine. Help me over. I want to see Luoli closer.”

There was nothing happier than having new blood in the family.

Especially in a family like the Mo Family, they didn’t lack anything. There were not many things that could make Old Madam happy.

Therefore, when she heard that Jiang Luoli was pregnant, she was overjoyed.

Once the child was born, it would be the Old Madam’s first great-grandson.

How could the Old Madam not take it seriously?

Initially, she was most worried about her two grandsons’ marriage. Now that these two matters had been settled and they had successfully formed a family, she started to look forward to grandchildren.

However, Mo Yesi and Qiao Mianmian had no intention of having a child now. No matter how much the Old Madam wanted grandchildren, she could only wait patiently.

She thought that she would have to wait a few more years before she could have a great-grandchild.

Unexpectedly, her wish was fulfilled so quickly.

“Grandma, sit down. Don’t get up.” Jiang Luoli stood up immediately when she saw the old lady walking towards her shakily.

She walked towards her.

She had just walked in front of the Old Madam when she was pressed down by her again.

“Luoli, why are you up? Sit down. You’re pregnant now.” The old lady was just like Mo Shixiu. When she heard that she was pregnant, she was very nervous. She pressed her down and asked the maid to bring a cushion for her to sit on.

Moreover, the old lady was even more exaggerated than Mo Shixiu.

“Isn’t the temperature in this room a little low? Uncle Zhang, quickly get someone to turn up the temperature of the air conditioner. Don’t let the Young Madam get cold.

“By the way, get someone to go to the kitchen and tell them not to make the food too greasy. Get a few more appetizers that are suitable for pregnant women. I remember that when I was pregnant back then, I especially liked to eat dishes cooked with sour beans. Go ask the kitchen if there’s such a thing. If there isn’t, go buy some immediately.”
