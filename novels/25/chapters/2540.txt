Chapter 2541: Break It Off Immediately

Shen Xin didn’t say a word until Madam Shen finished speaking.

She guessed that Madam Shen was calling her because of Shen Rou.

But guessing was one thing.

It was another matter to hear Madam Shen say it herself.

At this moment, Shen Xin felt as if her heart had been stabbed.

Coming from the person closest to her, it was especially painful.

Indeed.

In front of the interests of the family, kinship was nothing.

Even though they knew that she had suffered, they still wanted her to take the blame for Shen Rou.

Even if they knew in their hearts that she would be ruined because of this.

But all of this was nothing compared to the interests of the family.

“Xiao Xin, did you hear what I just said?” Madam Shen didn’t hear Shen Xin’s response and raised her voice. “Go and post on Weibo now. If you don’t know what to post, I’ll send you the proposal. Just post it accordingly.” nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“Mom.” Shen Xin’s eyes were filled with sadness and disappointment. She called Madam Shen softly, “Mom, do you know what Sister did?”

“Of course I know.” Madam Shen’s voice was calm. “Your sister didn’t do anything right, but I can understand why she did those things. That celebrity surnamed Qiao isn’t a good person, to begin with. If it wasn’t for her, your sister would have married into the Mo family long ago. If we became in-laws, our Shen family wouldn’t have encountered danger. It’s understandable that your sister is angry.”

Shen Xin listened to Madam Shen’s words and couldn’t speak.

“That brat from the Gong family is too detestable. He was so devoted to your sister. I really thought that he was sincere to her. But who knew that they were all the same. He’s not a good person.

“That vixen with the surname Qiao just casually hooked up with her and he changed his mind. That vixen is really scheming. She managed to hook up with the most outstanding unmarried young men in Yuncheng City.

“Such a restless vixen, and the Mo family is willing to let her in. I think they will get into trouble sooner or later!”

“Mom, Sister Qiao isn’t the kind of person you’re talking about.” Shen Xin couldn’t help but defend her when she heard how awful Madam Shen made Qiao Mianmian sound. “She didn’t seduce Brother Zeli. She and Brother Yesi are also in love. They aren’t…”

“Shen Xin, shut up! Is your surname Shen or Qiao? Why are you speaking up for an outsider?” Madam Shen sounded angry.

“I’m not.” Shen Xin closed her eyes and bit her lip. “Mom, you have a misunderstanding about Sister Qiao. I’ve seen her before. She’s really not the kind of person you’re talking about.”

“You’re still speaking up for that vixen? If she hadn’t snatched Mo Yesi away, her current position would belong to your sister. You’re really infuriating. I didn’t believe it when your sister told me that you might be in puppy love, but it seems like it’s true now.

“Shen Xin, answer me honestly. Are you dating Qiao Chen? Is that why you’re speaking up for his sister?”

Shen Xin was stunned.

She immediately denied it. “I’m not.”

“You’re still denying it? Then, why are you always speaking up for Qiao Mianmian?” Madam Shen was furious. “I don’t care if you are or not, I’ll put it out there now. It’s best if you don’t have anything to do with Qiao Chen. If you’re in a relationship with him, break it off immediately..”
