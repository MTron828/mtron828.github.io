Chapter 2943: I Have to Go No matter What

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

It was also because of this that Tang Wanqiu became her sore spot for a few

years.

Later... Mo Yunchen called Tang Wanqiu less and less in his sleep until she

never heard her name again.

He finally let go of Tang Wanqiu.

Madam Mo thought that she wouldn’t mind Tang Wanqiu anymore.

It had been so many years. Even if Mo Yunchen really had feelings for Tang

Wanqiu back then, that feeling should have dissipated over time.

What else did she have to mind?

It was just an anecdote about Mo Yunchen when he was young.

But now, she realized that she had never really gotten over it. Tang Wanqiu

was still her sore spot.

She was actually a little afraid of talking about this woman to Mo Yunchen.

Even though more than 20 years had passed, even though Mo Yunchen

pampered and doted on her, she was still afraid.

But what was she afraid of?

“Yunchen, 1-L..” Madam Mo struggled for a while and then smiled bitterly.

“This might have something to do with Tang Wanqiu. Tang Ya.. is probably

Tang Wanqiu’s relative. She took Yueyue away perhaps because of what

happened back then.

“I thought that what happened back then was already over. But who knew..”

“What did you say?” Mo Yunchen’s voice rose in shock. “You said... Tang

Wanqiu?”

“Mm.” Madam Mo felt jealous.

He still remembered that woman.

Even though he never mentioned her again, he still remembered her.

“How could it be her?” Mo Yunchen murmured. “It can’t be. She... she’s a very

kind woman. She wouldn’t do such a thing. Is there a misunderstanding?

“How do you know this has something to do with her?”

Madam Mo was even more upset to hear that he was defending Tang Wanqiu.

Was Tang Wanqiu that good to him?

Was he so sure that this had nothing to do with her?

If it was any other time, Madam Mo would definitely throw a tantrum. How 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

could she allow her husband to praise another woman and defend her in front

of her?

But Madam Mo knew that this wasn’t the time to throw a tantrum.

Mo Yunchen was already very disappointed in her. If she continued...

“Tang Ya said it herself.” Madam Mo repeated what Tang Ya said.

With that, Madam Mo asked again, “Yunchen, are you.. going?”

Mo Yunchen kept quiet for a while before saying, “I have to go.”

Madam Mo burst into tears. “But what if it’s dangerous? If Tang Ya is really

doing this for Tang Wanqiu, she won’t let you off easily.”

“I have to go. Wenpei, Yueyue is my granddaughter and the Mo family’s

bloodline. I can’t ignore her. Since we only have two hours, we have to find

Tang Ya as soon as possible.”

“But...”

“I have to go no matter what”

Madam Mo knew that Mo Yunchen had made up his mind. She tightened her

grip on her cell phone. She had so many things to say, but in the end, she only

choked and said, “Then... be careful.”

If it was anything else, she could stop him.

But she couldn’t stop him this time

Madam Mo had never felt so regretful before.
