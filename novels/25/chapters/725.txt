Chapter 727: What Kind of Wife Did You Find?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

He couldn’t hold it in anymore.

He thought that Qiao Mianmian would reply to him soon.

But even after a few minutes, the dialog box didn’t change.

The latest WeChat message was still the “?” he sent.

He couldn’t keep his cool anymore. After some thought, he sent another message: [??]

He waited for a few more minutes, but there was still no response.

Mo Yesi couldn’t remain calm anymore.

His brows were furrowed as he stared at his cell phone screen.

Did she not see it?

Or did she not bring her cell phone with her? Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Or was it because the reception wasn’t good, so she didn’t see his message?

Otherwise, he’d already sent her two WeChat messages, why didn’t she respond at all?

Mo Yesi waited for a while more, and his heart was in a mess.

At this point, he couldn’t care less about his pride.

He was about to call Qiao Mianmian when his cell phone lit up. It was Madam Mo.

After hesitating for a few seconds, he picked up the call.

“Mom.”

“Come back immediately.” Madam Mo sounded a little unhappy.

Mo Yesi frowned. “Mom, what’s the matter?”

He was still thinking about Qiao Mianmian not replying to him.

“Of course there’s something. Do you know that your wife is involved in another scandal? Ah Si, how long has it been? She was involved in a scandal with her ex-fiancé, and now she’s involved with a male actor. What kind of wife did you find?”

Sensing the anger in Madam Mo’s voice, Mo Yesi quickly explained, “Mom, this isn’t what you think. It’s a misunderstanding.”

“I don’t care if it’s a misunderstanding or not. Come home immediately. Your grandma is already so angry. If you have anything to say, come home and tell her yourself.”

Madam Mo hung up.

Mo Yesi tried to reject it.

He frowned.

After hesitating for a few seconds, he closed his laptop and left the office.

Before entering the elevator, he called Qiao Mianmian’s cell phone, but she didn’t pick up even after a long time.

Mo Yesi had a bad premonition and started to feel afraid.

This was his first time not being able to reach her.

It wasn’t late at night, she couldn’t have gone to bed so early.

He had just dialed the number, and it didn’t seem like it was out of battery.

So, why didn’t she answer his call?

Was it because something bad happened to her, and she couldn’t accept it?

As this thought came to mind, many scary thoughts emerged in his mind.

He recalled the news about her being watched by Tu Yilei’s fans on Weibo.

Although Bai Yusheng said that he’d already escorted her out of the set, who knew if the crazy fans were still waiting for her?

He knew how crazy fans could get.

Some fans would even commit suicide for their idols.

The more Mo Yesi thought about it, the more shocked he got. He immediately pressed the button for the basement when the elevator arrived.

His fingers trembled as he called Bai Yusheng. When the call went through, he immediately asked, “Did you send her back to the hotel?”
