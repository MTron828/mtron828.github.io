Chapter 1284: Give Her Some Time

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

She was crying like a three-year-old.

He hadn’t seen his mother cry like this in a long time.

She was really full of tears.

“Mom, I think you should let go of Mianmian first.” Bai Yusheng’s lips twitched. He looked at Qiao Mianmian in Madam Bai’s arms and found it funny. “You scared Mianmian just now.

“You’d better let Mianmian slowly get accustomed to it first.”

Madam Bai looked up in shock.

Then, she saw Qiao Mianmian’s confused and helpless expression.

Obviously, compared to Madam Bai’s excitement and joy, she didn’t cry from the joy of reuniting with her mother, nor did she feel aggrieved and sad after being separated from her mother for more than 10 years.

She was instead more confused.

She had lived in the Qiao family for more than 10 years.

She had always thought that she was from the Qiao family and Qiao Ruhai’s daughter.

One day, someone told her that she wasn’t related to the Qiao family by blood.

Her biological parents were actually someone else.

This was too sudden and unexpected for her.

Hence, Qiao Mianmian didn’t feel much joy.

She couldn’t feel the same way as Madam Bai.

This was something she couldn’t accept.

“Mianmian, did I really scare you?” Madam Bai looked very cautious as if she was afraid that she’d really scare her. “I’m sorry, Mom was just too happy. Mom’s reaction just now was a little too agitated. Y-You talk.” Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Madam Bai was so careful that she had to think about whether it was appropriate to say anything.

She got anxious when she saw that Qiao Mianmian was just looking at her in a daze.

“Mianmian, did Mom say something wrong? Are you unhappy?” Madam Bai looked nervous.

“N-No.”

Qiao Mianmian finally snapped out of her daze. “Aunt, no, you didn’t say anything to anger me.”

“Are you still calling me Aunt?” Madam Bai’s eyes were a little sad.

“I...” Qiao Mianmian was at a loss for words.

She couldn’t bear to see Madam Bai disappointed.

But she really couldn’t bring herself to call her Mom.

She liked Madam Bai.

But this was different from asking her to immediately acknowledge Madam Bai as her mother.

“Mom, you’re too anxious.” Bai Yusheng could tell that Qiao Mianmian was still unable to accept this. He advised Madam Bai. “You have to give Mianmian some time. This is too sudden for her.”

“Aunt Bai.”

Mo Yesi watched for a while and slowly walked to Qiao Mianmian. He reached out and touched her head. “This is too sudden for Mianmian. I hope Aunt Bai won’t let her make a decision now and give her some time to think it through.

“After all, this isn’t a small matter.”

Madam Bai was so immersed in the joy of finding her daughter that she couldn’t think about anything else.

She only had one thought in her mind. She wanted to acknowledge Qiao Mianmian and bring her back to the Bai family.

Now that she had calmed down, she gradually regained some rationality.
