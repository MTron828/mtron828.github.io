Chapter 1139: I’ll Bear All the Consequences

Actually, even Wei Zheng felt that something was wrong.

If President Mo hadn’t informed Young Master Gong and asked him to endorse Young Madam, things wouldn’t have been so clear.

Wei Zheng recalled the rumors, and his expression changed.

Could it be that Young Master Gong was really interested in Young Madam?

But that was impossible.

Young Madam was President Mo’s wife, and Young Master Gong knew this.

Besides, hadn’t Young Master Gong always liked Miss Shen?

Wei Zheng thought about it for a while and carefully glanced at Mo Yesi’s expression. He then carefully replied, “CEO Mo, MC always used A-list celebrities. Under normal circumstances, Young Madam wouldn’t have been able to get this endorsement. However, I’m guessing that her manager had interacted with MC before and they found out that Young Madam is working for you, so Young Master Gong gave this endorsement on your account?

“Or perhaps Young Madam’s appearance fits their requirements, so they made an exception and used a newbie?”

Wei Zheng did not dare to voice out his thoughts.

He wanted to live for another two years.

But, even if he didn’t say it, President Mo was already unhappy about it.

Otherwise, he wouldn’t have suddenly asked him these questions.

President Mo must have felt that something was wrong.

“You think so?” Mo Yesi narrowed his eyes.

“Yes, yes.” Wei Zheng nodded and became more cautious.

“Alright, I got it.” Mo Yesi waved his hand after a moment of silence. “You can leave now. I’ll call you if anything happens.”

“Yes, President Mo.” Wei Zheng couldn’t wait to leave.

At a time like this, if he didn’t have to appear in front of President Mo, he definitely wouldn’t.

It was the wisest thing to do to minimize his presence.

Wei Zheng turned around and ran out of the office.

“Wait.”

He had just taken a few steps when he heard Mo Yesi’s cold voice behind him. “Call Zhao Kai and tell him that this matter has to be handled strictly. Anyone who creates rumors and causes trouble, no matter who they are, tell them to die.

“I’ll bear all the consequences.”

Wei Zheng paused. He could tell that Mo Yesi was really angry this time.

It was different from any other time.

This time, he specially instructed them to be strict.

Those who started rumors and defamed Young Madam would be in deep trouble.

However, he also felt that it was time to punish those haters.

It would be easier to deal with these people spreading rumors and defaming Young Madam. If others didn’t know the severity of defaming Young Madam, these things would only continue to happen.

...

After Wei Zheng left, Mo Yesi called Qiao Mianmian.

After the call went through, a soft and sweet voice entered his ears. “Mo Yesi, are you done with your work? Do you have a business meeting this afternoon? If not, do you want to have lunch together?”

Mo Yesi’s anger dissipated when he heard her sweet voice.

But when he thought of the messy scandals he had seen on Weibo, his eyes darkened again.

He tried his best to suppress the unknown fire in his heart and rubbed his glabella. He took a deep breath and asked, “Where are you now?”

When Qiao Mianmian answered his call, she was still in the car. “Sister Linda helped me take an advertisement. I just signed the contract and was about to look for you. I think I’ll reach the Mo Corporation in five minutes.”
