Chapter 543: Who Is Chairman Mo Going to Help?

“Uh, Young Madam, I was just casually asking. Please ignore me.”

Wei Zheng already made a mistake, he couldn’t make another now. Seeing how curious Qiao Mianmian looked, he hurriedly changed the topic. “We’d better go up first. Chairman Mo is still in a meeting, and he’ll take another hour or so.”

Qiao Mianmian shifted her attention right away too and forgot about his question. She nodded and casually said, “Sure.” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Wei Zheng led her to the elevator.

There were eight elevators in the building.

But Mo Yesi had one for himself and the other managers in the office.

Wei Zheng led Qiao Mianmian to the personal elevator and waited there.

While they waited, the few female receptionists peeked out and started discussing. “Who’s that woman? Is Personal Assistant Wei taking her to see the Chairman?”

“I guess so. Otherwise, Personal Assistant Wei wouldn’t come down personally to receive her.”

“I thought Personal Assistant Wei was here to receive Miss Shen, but it seems not. Where did this woman come from? Miss Shen never got such treatment.”

“I heard from the secretaries that she’s Chairman Mo’s girlfriend.”

“What?!! Chairman Mo’s girlfriend?!! But she’s so young, she actually looks underage. How could Chairman Mo like this type?”

“She looks young, but I doubt she’s underage. I had a look just now, she’s at least a C cup. Perhaps she just looks young.”

“And she’s really beautiful. She has a small face, her features are beautiful, and her complexion is great. She’s so fair she’s almost glowing. To be objective, I feel that she’s even more beautiful than Miss Shen. Just that Miss Shen seems more mature and elegant.”

This group of receptionists wasn’t the same group that Qiao Mianmian saw when she first came to the Mo Corporation.

She had no idea.

That the receptionists from back then were no longer in the Mo Corporation.

How could Mo Yesi tolerate those receptionists’ disrespect towards his wife?

They were dismissed soon after Wei Zheng told Mo Yesi what they’d said and done.

“Men like Miss Shen’s type more, right?”

“That might not be the case. Miss Shen and the Chairman have known each other since young, right? If the Chairman liked her, they would’ve been together by now. But they’ve been friends for so many years, that already shows that Chairman isn’t interested in her type.”

“But I heard that... Young Lady Shen likes Chairman Mo. I’m not sure if it’s true, but if it is... it’s going to be exciting later. This girlfriend of Chairman Mo’s seems rather mild, I doubt she can fight Young Lady Shen.”

“Same here.”

“If there’s a conflict, who is Chairman Mo going to help? One is his childhood friend and the other is his new girlfriend...”

As they were busy discussing, Qiao Mianmian entered the Chairman’s elevator with Wei Zheng.
