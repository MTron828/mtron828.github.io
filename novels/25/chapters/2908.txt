Translator: Atlas Studios | Editor: Atlas Studios

Overboard? Haha, I have even worse things to say.” Qjao Anxin looked at Qjao Mianmian fiercely, her eyes full of hatred. “Tve been hoping for her to die every day. If she died, I’d definitely set off firecrackers to celebrate. Unfortunately, that slut just couldn’t die. God is really unfair, giving all the good things to her.

“She and I came from the same ordinary background, but why did she suddenly become the daughter of the Bai family? I’m not a member of the Qjao family, but why is my biological father sucha terrible person?

“God is so biased. He gave her all the good things. As for me, Ive already won.

I’m the winner in other people’s eyes, but I have nothing noOW. Why is God treating me like this? Why!

“I hate you, I really hate you. Qjao Mianmian, I really hate you. Without you, my life would have been so smooth and glorious. If it wasn’t for you, I wouldn’t be lying here now.”

If she had married Su Ze and stayed with the Su family, she would definitely be doing well now.Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Even if the Su family wasn’t super-rich, they could still give her a lifetime of riches.

Su Ze was one in a million, and she was very satisfied with him.

But who would have thought that Qjao Mianmian would find a man a thousand times better than him?

And after meeting Mo Yesi, how could she continue liking Su Ze?

Especially when Qjao Mianmian had always been under her feet.

Suddenly, her defeated opponent became a winner in life. She found a man who was countless times better than the previous one and even rode on her How could she tolerate this?

At that moment, she swore that she would snatch Mo Yesi away from Qjao Mianmian.

She wanted to marry Mo Yesi and become the true winner.

She wanted to defeat Qjao Mianmian again and trample on her.

Her competitive spirit caused her to not be satisfied with the current situation.

She wanted to compare herself to Qjao Mianmian in every aspect, but she couldn’t. Her crazy jealousy and unwillingness made her more and more twisted. She thought about how to scheme against Qjao Mianmian almost every moment.

But in the end, she was the one involved.

She couldn’t wait for Qjao Mianmian to die.

But now, Qiao Mianmian was standing right in front of her.

And she was going to die soon..

No matter how indignant she was, Qiao Mianmian still won.

“Qjao Mianmian, you won this battle in the end. But don’t be too smug. Even ifI die, my soul will always curse you and cling to you.” Qjao Anxin suddenly laughed, but her smile was strange and vicious. “I curse that all the happiness you have now will one day turn into bubbles. I curse you to end up worse than me one day. Qjao Mianmian, I’ll wait for you downstairs. I believe I won’t wait too long”

Father Qjao was stunned by her words.

After Qjao Anxin finished speaking, she laughed out loud, and her expression became even more twisted.

Qjao Mianmian looked at her expression calmly and wasn’t affected by her words at all.

She waited for Qjao Anxin to finish laughing. Just as she was about to say something, Mo Yesi took a step forward and said, “People like you, who have done so much evil, will be sent to hell after you die. You will be tormented all the time until the day you turm to ash.”
