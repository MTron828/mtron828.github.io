Chapter 2355: The More You Lack Something, the More You Like to Show Off

“Qiao Mianmian, you…” Shen Rou was furious. She knew that Qiao Mianmian was deliberately provoking her, but she still couldn’t control her temper. She glared at her. “Why are you deliberately showing off in front of me? Do you think I’ll be jealous of you? It’s just a bracelet worth tens of millions, what’s so strange about it? You picked the wrong person to show off.

“I already have a lot of such jewelry. Only those who haven’t seen the world would think that they’re so amazing.”

“Eh, Miss Shen, did you misunderstand? I’ve never flaunted in front of you.” Qiao Mianmian smiled and said casually, “I was just chatting casually, and Miss Shen thought so much. It seems like we can’t continue chatting.

“In that case, I’ll take my leave first.”

Qiao Mianmian had always been polite and calm. Compared to Shen Rou’s flushed face, she seemed like a well-educated lady from a prestigious family.

Meanwhile, Shen Rou was like a shrew.

She and Qiao Mianmian were standing at the door, and the reporters happened to be taking photos of them.

Of course, Shen Rou didn’t know about this.

Qiao Mianmian turned and walked into the revolving glass door. Shen Rou stood still looking at her. Her hatred couldn’t be concealed, and her eyes looked cold and scary.

Even the reporters taking photos felt a chill down their spines. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

It seemed like the rumors were true.

Shen Rou had liked Mo Yesi for so many years, but he chose to be with another woman.

Seeing the woman he loved so deeply, she must be extremely jealous.

Most importantly, the woman that the man she loved liked was prettier than her.

Not only that, but her family background wasn’t any worse than hers.

No, her family background was better than hers.

The Bai family was ranked first in Yuncheng City.

Hence, Shen Rou lost to a woman with better looks and family background.

She couldn’t accept it.

The reporters saved the photos excitedly as they thought about what headline they should come up with.

All along, such topics were popular among the public.

Once the video was uploaded, it would probably be trending again.

“Miss Shen.” Little Xiao looked at Shen Rou, who was about to faint from anger. She thought for a while and then comforted her. “Miss Shen, why bother with her? It’s said that the more you lack something, the more you like to show off. Sometimes, what we see might not be true.

“She’s deliberately trying to anger Miss Shen. If Miss Shen gets angry because of this, she’ll only feel smug.”

Shen Rou turned around. “You mean that she and Mo Yesi aren’t really in love?”

“Yes.”

Little Xiao recalled the scene she saw in the small mountain village.
