Chapter 1474: You Can Look for Him Anytime

As she stabbed, she gritted her teeth and said, “Bitch, die! Why aren’t you dead yet!

“I won’t be defeated by you! I won’t let you off!

“Even if I die, I’ll drag you down with me!”

The doll was wearing a shirt with the words “Qiao Mianmian” sewn on it.

The doll was already full of holes from head to toe. It was obvious how many times Qiao Anxin had stabbed it.

Qiao Anxin vented all her hatred on it.

She was sweating.

She only threw the doll on the bed when she felt that her hands were sore.

At this moment, her cell phone rang.

Qiao Anxin panted for a while before picking it up.

She saw the caller ID and was stunned for a few seconds before picking it up.

The person who called her was her manager when she was still in Star Splendor. Her name was Song Fang.

After a few days, she terminated her contract with Star Splendor.

“Anxin, I heard from a friend that you’re looking for something to do now?” Song Fang asked.

After Qiao Anxin left Star Splendor, she stopped contacting them.

She was surprised that Song Fang would call her.

She kept quiet for a few seconds before replying, “Yes. Sister Song, why did you call me?”

“Mm, there’s something. I want to ask if you’ve found a job. If you haven’t, I can introduce you. It depends on your interest.”

Qiao Anxin was shocked. “Sister Song, are you introducing me to a job?”

She didn’t have a good relationship with Song Fang.

They hadn’t contacted each other ever since she left Star Splendor.

Song Fang suddenly called her and said that she wanted to introduce a job to her. This surprised and puzzled Qiao Anxin.

Song Fang wasn’t such a warm-hearted person.

“Anxin, I heard that you’re looking for something to do. I can help you get a job, so I called to ask if you want it. Of course, if you’ve already found something to do, pretend I didn’t say anything.”

“Thank you, Sister Song. I haven’t found anything to do yet. If Sister Song has a suitable job, of course I want to do it. What job is Sister Song introducing me to?”

To Qiao Anxin, Song Fang’s call was like a life-saving straw.

Although she didn’t know what job Song Fang wanted to introduce her to, she thought that as long as it wasn’t too bad, she would accept it.

She needed exposure now. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

She was afraid that she would be forgotten if she didn’t appear in front of the audience for a long time.

Song Fang kept quiet for a while before saying, “Anxin, do you still remember Boss Huang from Jiancheng? When you just debuted, Boss Huang already liked you, but you ended up with Chairman Su, so he had to give up.

“Now that you’ve broken up with Chairman Su, Boss Huang heard that you’ve been in trouble recently and is very concerned about your matters, so he asked me to ask if you need any help. If you do, you can look for him anytime.”

Before Song Fang could finish speaking, Qiao Anxin’s expression had already darkened.

She wanted to hang up immediately.

Before hanging up, she wanted to give Song Fang a good scolding.
