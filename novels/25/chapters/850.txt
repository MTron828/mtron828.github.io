Chapter 851: The Treatment Was Really Too Good

Mo Yesi accompanied her to the airport.

...

Three hours later, she arrived at F City.

Nana came to pick her up at the airport. The two of them got a cab and went straight to the set.

Bai Yusheng was very efficient. In just a day, he had already decided on the third female role.

She was a pretty female artiste and wasn’t considered a newbie. She was rather famous, and Qiao Mianmian knew her.

Everyone in the crew was waiting for Bai Yusheng’s new female lead role.

Everyone knew that Huang Yilin wouldn’t be the female lead of this show anymore.

But no one knew who the new artiste was.

Hence, when Bai Yusheng brought Qiao Mianmian to the front of the crowd and told them that she would be the female lead, everyone’s expressions changed.

Everyone was shocked.

No one expected the new female lead to be Qiao Mianmian.

Bai Yusheng liked using newbies.

But this was the first time a newbie like Qiao Mianmian who didn’t even have a basic representation was going to be the female lead.

A few days ago, the crew had already been spreading rumors.

Everyone was wondering if Bai Yusheng had taken a liking to this newbie.

Now that the news was out, it undoubtedly confirmed the rumors.

If it wasn’t for this newbie, would Bai Yusheng give her the female lead role?

It wasn’t as if there weren’t any good-looking and capable female artistes.

Why would he give such an important role to a newbie?

This was a risk.

It was obvious that Bai Yusheng really liked this newbie and was prepared to groom her.

Everyone had a different opinion of Qiao Mianmian.

After Bai Yusheng’s introduction, the crowd dispersed and went about their own business.

Tu Yilei hesitated for a while before saying to her, “Mianmian, congratulations.”

Qiao Mianmian nodded politely and replied, “Thank you, Mr. Tu.”

She sounded more polite and distant than before.

Tu Yilei had a high EQ, how could he not sense it.

He knew very well why Qiao Mianmian would alienate him.

She already had a boyfriend. She probably didn’t want to have any scandals with him and make him unhappy.

He’d seen that man before. He was a possessive man.

He definitely wouldn’t like to see his woman having a scandal with another man.

And Qiao Mianmian cared about him too.

Although Tu Yilei could understand it, he felt terrible. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

She couldn’t even be a normal friend...

He had to control his urge to get closer to her.

He didn’t want to cause her any more trouble.

But this was really difficult.

Qiao Mianmian nodded at him and left.

Tu Yilei clenched his fists as he watched her leave.

...

Qiao Mianmian followed the other artistes to the dressing room to change.

This time, her treatment was much better than the first time.

As the female lead, she no longer had to share a makeup artist with others. Moreover, she had a separate dressing room. The treatment was simply too good.

Everyone was polite to her.

A few female artistes even addressed her as “Sister Mianmian.” She saw that the female artiste was obviously older than her.

When she was doing her makeup, the makeup artist kept praising her good skin. She said that she had a good foundation and that she would look good even with little makeup.
