Shen Rou probably thought that these words would be a blow to her confidence.

But if this was what she was going for, she’d failed.

Qiao Mianmian wasn’t affected by this, neither would she be saddened to learn about it.

“Miss Qiao, don’t over-analyze what I’m trying to say to you.” Shen Rou wasn’t willing to admit it. “I’m just presenting some facts to you. As to why Ah Si would marry you, how am I to know?”

Haha.

Qiao Mianmian sneered in her heart.

She obviously meant it that way, and now she was denying it?

If Shen Rou had told her directly that she didn’t like her and didn’t wish to see her with Mo Yesi, or that she wasn’t good enough for Mo Yesi, she would actually admire such a straightforward character.

But this sort of sarcasm and unwillingness to own up to one’s intention was disgusting.

She despised such methods.

“This is all Miss Shen wanted to tell me?”

Qiao Mianmian couldn’t be bothered about her, and there was some impatience in her tone. “If you’re done, then please leave. I’m a little tired and need some rest.”

Shen Rou was stunned.

Seeing how Qiao Mianmian was unfazed by what she’d said, she frowned.

Qiao Mianmian’s reaction was completely out of her expectations.

She’d thought that Qiao Mianmian would be ashamed and at a loss.

Or that she’d feel inferior and devastated.

Whichever reaction it was, it didn’t matter. As long as she was unhappy, Shen Rou would feel good about herself.

But...

Qiao Mianmian didn’t show any sign of sadness.

She didn’t seem to be bothered at all.

It was as if this had nothing to do with her.

Now it was Shen Rou who was angry and ashamed of herself. “Miss Qiao doesn’t mind it one bit?”

She didn’t believe that Qiao Mianmian was completely fine with this. She must be feigning it!

Qiao Mianmian raised her brow. “Mind what?”

Shen Rou’s gaze deepened. “If Ah Si married you only because of that special reason and actually has no feelings for you... you won’t mind it at all?”

“Miss Shen, are you being concerned for me now?” Qiao Mianmian smiled. “But the reason Mo Yesi and I married is between just the two of us. It has nothing to do with an outsider like Miss Shen.”

Qiao Mianmian emphasized the word “outsider”.

Shen Rou’s facial muscles were practically twitching. “Miss Qiao really thinks that her place as Young Madam Mo is secure just because she married Ah Si?”

“That has nothing to do with you too.”

Qiao Mianmian was getting increasingly annoyed by her and didn’t want to entertain her further. “Miss Shen, could you leave already?” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Shen Rou was a prideful person. How could she tolerate being chased out time and again?

The elegant but false smile on her face vanished, and by now, she was looking coldly at Qiao Mianmian. She sneered and said, “I hope that Miss Qiao can remain this confident. I’m waiting to see how long you can take the place of Young Madam Mo.”

“Thank you.” Qiao Mianmian gestured to the door. “I shan’t walk you out.”

Shen Rou pursed her lips and glared at her for a full minute before finally taking her leave.

...

When the door closed, Qiao Mianmian wasn’t sleepy anymore.

She wasn’t in the mood to sleep after Shen Rou bothered her like that.

Although she didn’t care much about Shen Rou herself, it was still upsetting to be targeted and attacked this way.
