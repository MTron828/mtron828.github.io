Chapter 1066: Introduce Young Lady Shen to Me?

Mo Shixiu took a deep breath and looked away. “Mm.”

“Alright. Then, let’s go back.” Jiang Luoli finally relented. The thought of being able to kiss this handsome guy she’d always wanted to kiss made her extremely cooperative. “Mo Shixiu, then, let’s go back quickly.”

“We’ll be right back.”

“You said it, I can kiss you when we get back. Don’t lie to me!”

Mo Shixiu was speechless.

He decided that he would never let Jiang Luoli touch a drop of alcohol again.

He meant what he said.

...

The Bai family.

The hall was brightly lit.

Bai Yusheng got out of the car and saw an unfamiliar car parked by the side. He asked the butler, “Uncle Chen, are there guests at home?”

The butler nodded.

Bai Yusheng walked out of the garage with the butler following behind him.

As he walked, he asked, “Who’s here?”

The butler immediately replied, “It’s Madam Shen and the two young ladies from the Shen family.”

Bai Yusheng paused. “The Shen family is here?”

“Yes.”

“What are they doing here?”

The big families in Yuncheng City were all friends.

But the Bai and Shen families didn’t have a good relationship, so the two families were just acquaintances.

Unlike the Mo and Shen families, who had been friends for many years.

The Shen family rarely visited the Bai family, so Bai Yusheng couldn’t help but feel strange when he heard that the Shen family was here.

The butler replied respectfully, “I’m not sure about that. But I heard Madam Shen and Madam talking about you. It seems like Madam Shen is here for you.”

Bai Yusheng found it even stranger. He frowned. “For me? What has it got to do with me?”

“This...” The butler looked at him hesitantly.

Bai Yusheng looked a little annoyed. “Just say it. You know I hate people who speak half the time.”

“Yes, yes, yes.” The butler saw the change in his expression and immediately said, “Madam Shen seems to want to introduce her daughter to Young Master. I heard her asking Madam if Young Master is still single and if he has a girlfriend.

“But I’m not sure which Miss Shen she wants to introduce to Young Master. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“I think it should be Young Lady Shen. She’s still young, so Madam Shen shouldn’t be in a rush to find her a partner.”

Bai Yusheng looked incredulous. “Introduce Young Lady Shen to me? Doesn’t Shen Rou like Mo Yesi? She’s willing to come too?”

“I-I don’t know. Young Master can ask Madam.”

Bai Yusheng felt that this was unbelievable.

The Shen family suddenly came to the Bai family to introduce him to someone.

Moreover, it was Young Lady Shen Rou.

Everyone in the group knew that Shen Rou liked Mo Yesi so much that she was going crazy.

Mo Yesi would never marry anyone in this lifetime.

Bai Yusheng felt that this was a little strange. He didn’t fully trust the butler’s words and decided to ask Madam Bai himself.

“How long have they been here?”

“Almost an hour.”

“It’s been an hour, and they’re still here?” Bai Yusheng looked up at the brightly lit residential building and frowned.

...

In the lobby.

Madam Shen and Madam Bai were still chatting happily.

Shen Rou and Shen Xin sat beside Madam Shen and listened to their conversation quietly.

“Sister Bai, didn’t you say that Yusheng will be back tonight? Why isn’t he back yet? Did something happen to him?”
