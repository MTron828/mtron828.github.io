Chapter 803: I’ve Liked You for So Many Years

Before she did anything, she expected the worst.

She was sure that even if Mo Yesi knew the truth, he wouldn’t really do anything to her.

They had been friends for over 20 years.

And the relationship between the Shen and Mo families.

No matter what, the consequences wouldn’t be too serious.

At most, he’d just be angry for a while.

He couldn’t possibly cut all ties with her just because of this.

But now, she wasn’t so sure.

She bit her lip and said in a trembling voice, “Ah Si, I-I didn’t do it on purpose. I was just too... too jealous of her. I was just blinded by jealousy, so I did something irrational.

“I didn’t really want to destroy her.

“I just don’t like her. I don’t want her to live so smoothly.

“Why can’t I be with you even after waiting for you for over 20 years? She just appeared in your life and doesn’t know you as well as I do. She can be your wife for the rest of your life and be by your side forever. She can even make you treat her so well and pamper her?

“Why?!”

Shen Rou couldn’t control the grievance and hatred in her heart and let out a low growl. “Just because she can cure you? Just because of her so-called uniqueness? Ah Si, do you really like her?”

“If she wasn’t so special to you, would you still marry her? You wouldn’t.

“You’ve never had any emotional experience, so you treat this as love. You think you like her, so you treat her well, protect her, and pamper her. But you don’t really like her.

“I just can’t stand how easily she can get your love. What right does she have!

“If she hadn’t been able to treat your illness, you wouldn’t have had any interaction with her in this lifetime. But I’m different. We’ve known each other and have been by each other’s side since we were young. Everyone around us thinks that we should be together.

“If it wasn’t for Qiao Mianmian’s sudden appearance, your wife would have been me. Ah Si, I can’t accept this. I’ve liked you for so many years, and now I have to give you to someone else. I really can’t accept this.”

At the end of her speech, Shen Rou was already sobbing.

She covered her face and cried. “Do you know, I’ve liked you for so many years. I’ve liked you since the first time I saw you. I’ve never had anyone else in my heart besides you.

“They all told me to give up on you. They said that you’re already married, and I shouldn’t pester you anymore. I tried to, but I really can’t.”

She really liked him.

He was her entire world.

Without him, her world would crumble.

Then, what was the point of her life?

All she wanted was to marry him and become his wife.

But he married another woman.

What about her?

What should she do?

Everyone was trying to persuade her to let go, but how could she let go of 20 years of feelings?

He was digging her heart out.

Would a person survive without a heart? Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Hence, unless she died, she would never be able to let go of him.

Mo Yesi listened to her expressionlessly.

It was as if what he had just listened had nothing to do with him.
