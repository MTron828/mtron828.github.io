Chapter 954: Who Could It Be?

“I’m sorry.” Linda apologized a few times. “If I was the one who started the company, I’d keep you no matter what. But I’m also a worker. The boss will listen to my opinions, but I can’t make the final decision.”

Qiao Mianmian was surprisingly calm after hearing what Linda said.

She wasn’t surprised or angry at all.

She even felt relieved.

She could understand why Huan Yu wanted to terminate the contract with her.

They’d just signed a newbie, and she hadn’t even made much money for the company, but she was already causing trouble every other day. If she was the boss of the company, he wouldn’t want such an artiste either.

In fact, even if Linda hadn’t told her about the termination of the contract, she would have thought the same.

She didn’t know why she was so unlucky.

Previously, when she was just a minor actress, nothing happened.

But ever since she signed the contract and had an official company, scandals started to spread.

She couldn’t seem to stop them.

She didn’t know if this would happen again.

Hence, terminating the contract would make her feel more relaxed.

Although it was impossible for her not to feel bad about terminating her contract with such a good media company like Huan Yu, her current state was unsuitable for her to sign with another agency.

“Alright, I got it. Can we terminate the contract today?” Qiao Mianmian thought for a while and said, “I have time today, I can book a flight back to Yuncheng City immediately. Let’s meet at a specific time.”

Linda was silent for about a minute before saying, “Then, can we have dinner together?”

“Alright.” Qiao Mianmian agreed immediately.

“Mianmian, I’m really sorry.” Linda apologized again. “I didn’t expect things to turn out this way. I really have high hopes for you. With your capability and qualifications, you’ll definitely be popular in the future. But the company...”

“Sister Linda, I understand.” Qiao Mianmian could hear the guilt in Linda’s voice. She softened her voice and comforted her. “Just like you said, you don’t own the company. In the end, you can’t control it.

“So, you don’t have to keep apologizing to me. Moreover, I can understand the company’s actions. I won’t be unhappy with the company because of this.”

Linda smiled bitterly. “Speaking of which, after you signed with Huan Yu, I didn’t get any resources for you. You were the one who found the resources for the television series, and you were the one who got the female lead role. If you can get the female lead role in your first production, your future will be limitless. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“It’s their loss to make such a decision. They’ll regret it in the future.

“Mianmian, even if you terminate your contract with the company, I’m no longer your financier. In private, we’ll still be friends.”

“Mm, I know.”

“There’s one more thing...” Just as she was about to hang up, Linda suddenly said, “The person who exposed this seems to have come prepared. I’ve checked, the hot searches about you were all uploaded by someone.

“And just like before, every comment section has a large number of comments about the military. The fake reviewers are all against you.

“So, I think someone is out to mess with you. Have you... thought about who it might be?”
