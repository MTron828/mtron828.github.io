Chapter 1450: I’m Not That Confused

He had never seen Brother Han praise anyone like this before.

The assistant couldn’t help but worry when he thought of Qiao Mianmian’s beautiful face.

Could it be that Brother Han helped her because of her looks?

After all, he had never helped a female artiste like this before.

But Qiao Mianmian already had a boyfriend.

And he was a rich and handsome man.

He had seen the photos on Weibo.

Even though he was Brother Han’s number one fan, he had to admit that Qiao Mianmian’s tall and rich boyfriend was indeed very handsome. Not inferior to Qin Han at all.

He was definitely one of the best among the rich second-generation heirs.

No, his looks were considered top-notch in the entertainment industry.

He had a face suitable for the entertainment industry and was rich and powerful. To be honest, if his Brother Han really wanted to do that, it was impossible.

“If there’s a chance, I’ll naturally help her. Even if I’m praising her, she has to have the capability. I’m only giving her an audition opportunity. Whether Director Zhang will use her is not up to me.

“Moreover, with her relationship with Director Bai, she doesn’t have to worry about not getting good resources. Her future is destined to be prosperous. I’m just adding flowers to the brocade.”

“I think with Director Bai’s help, you don’t have to help her like this, Brother Han. You’ve never helped anyone like this before. Brother Han is too good to her.” The assistant tried to sound him out, hesitated for a while, and asked cautiously, “Brother Han, are you so good to her because of Director Bai?”

Qin Han didn’t know what his assistant was thinking. He thought for a while before saying, “There’s indeed such a reason, but this isn’t the main reason.”

“What’s the main reason?”

“I see a shadow of myself in her. She’s a very talented and hardworking actress. She’s willing to study seriously. Now there’s a chance to give such a newbie a push. I’ll do so. It’s nothing to me, but it might be a very important opportunity for her.”

The assistant was stunned.

He had been with Qin Han for many years, so he knew that he was able to develop his career successfully because of a senior’s help.

That benefactor also gave him an opportunity to audition. Qin Han got the second male lead role through that audition and finally won the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Male Lead.

After winning the award, Qin Han’s net worth rose as well. People line up to get him to act in their movies.

Picking out one or two good scripts from the pile, the movies he produced were good and solid.

After that, his career went through the roof and he won several Best Actor awards.

Hence, Qin Han was always grateful to the person who helped him.

The assistant recalled these things and relaxed a little when he saw Qin Han’s honest and unconcealed gaze.

As long as Qin Han didn’t have feelings for Qiao Mianmian, he wasn’t worried anymore.

“Brother Han is right, I was too short-sighted.”

Qin Han smiled. “Do you think I don’t know what you mean? Qiao Mianmian is a good girl, but she’s already taken. I’m not so foolish.”

The assistant was speechless.

So Qin Han knew what he was thinking.

...

On the other hand, Qiao Mianmian didn’t have much to do and could rest for an hour or two.
