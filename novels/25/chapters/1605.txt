Chapter 1606: Is She Qiao Mianmian?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Hence, female celebrities rarely revealed their bare faces.

But Qiao Mianmian’s bare face was a bonus.

They were both women, so Shangguan Qing could tell that Qiao Mianmian was really bare-faced.

She tightened her grip on the cell phone and looked at the beautiful woman in the photo.

She always thought that the woman Gong Zeli liked was Shen Rou.

So, she was a newbie in the entertainment industry.

Just like her best friend said, this newbie was a vixen.

Wasn’t she seducing men everywhere?

She could seduce anyone.

But if she dared to seduce Brother Zeli, she wouldn’t be polite.

...

After settling the hot searches, Qiao Mianmian continued filming.

During the break, as she read the script, a crew member walked towards her.

The employee stopped in front of her. “Miss Qiao, someone is looking for you.” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Qiao Mianmian looked up from the script. “Someone’s looking for me?”

“Yes.”

“Have you asked who it is?”

“There are two ladies. They said they’re Miss Qiao’s friends.”

“My friends?”

Qiao Mianmian frowned.

She closed the script.

As soon as she did it, she saw two women walking towards her.

They were very young and dressed like daughters from rich families. They even had a crew member with them.

“Are the two ladies you mentioned them?”

Seeing the two girls walk towards her, Qiao Mianmian asked the staff.

“Yes.”

The employee’s answer made Qiao Mianmian even more confused.

She didn’t know them.

Soon, the two girls stopped in front of her.

One of the girls was wearing a pink dress and holding the latest luxury brand platinum bag. She looked extremely arrogant as she stood in front of Qiao Mianmian and looked down at her. “Is she Qiao Mianmian?”

The girl looked at her with disdain.

The crew member who brought them over was stunned. Just as he was about to introduce them, Qiao Mianmian said, “I’m Qiao Mianmian. May I know why you’re looking for me?”

The woman in the pink dress raised her hand.

Qiao Mianmian was experienced. The moment she saw her raise her hand, she immediately got up and moved to the side.

The girl’s hand landed on empty air.

She looked at Qiao Mianmian angrily. “You shameless vixen, how dare you avoid me.”

Qiao Mianmian’s expression darkened.

Nana’s expression also turned cold. She immediately walked forward and glared at them. “Who are you, are you sure you didn’t recognize the wrong person? This isn’t a place for you to throw a tantrum. If you continue like this, I’ll call the security officers over.”

“Move aside, let that vixen Qiao Mianmian speak up.” The girl in pink was Shangguan Qing’s friend. She came with Shangguan Qing and said that she wanted to help her friend teach Qiao Mianmian a lesson.

Her face was a little awful.

Facing Nana’s questioning, she arrogantly pointed at Nana’s nose and said, “Who are you, still protecting that vixen? This has nothing to do with you. Quickly get out of the way, or I won’t be polite to you anymore.”
