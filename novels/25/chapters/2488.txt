Chapter 2490: Qiao Mianmian, How Could She!

These people claimed that they had a friend on set who saw how Qiao Mianmian seduced Qin Han.

Best Actor Qin had seen all sorts of things, so he wasn’t fooled by her.

Someone asked: “Since she didn’t succeed in seducing Qin Han, why did he speak up for her again and again?”

Someone replied: “Of course it’s because Qiao Mianmian has a powerful background. Bai Yusheng is her biological brother, and Mo Yesi is her fiancé. Would Qin Han dare to offend her? Although Qin Han is very powerful in the entertainment industry and he received a Best Actor Award, he’s nothing compared to someone with power and influence. What if Qiao Mianmian gets revenge if he refuses to help her?”

Many people believed this person.

Yes, Qin Han must have been forced.

He had never spoken up for a female artiste on Weibo before.

Why should he help Qiao Mianmian?

And he helped her again and again.

Moreover, Qiao Mianmian’s reputation wasn’t good.

Qin Han knew that many netizens, including his fans, didn’t like Qiao Mianmian.

Under normal circumstances, he wouldn’t speak up for her.

Besides being forced by power, what else could it be for?

Because of this new revelation, Qiao Mianmian was scolded even worse.

Qin Han was the Movie King. He was good-looking, had good acting skills, and had a good character.

Not only was he the most capable in the industry, but he was also the most popular. He had countless fans.

Previously, Qin Han’s fans didn’t really like Qiao Mianmian.

But because Qin Han admired Qiao Mianmian and had a good relationship with her, the fans forced themselves to accept her.

Now…

With this news, Qiao Mianmian not only seduced Qin Han during filming but also gave him a room card. She even forced him to put in a good word for her on Weibo. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

How could the fans tolerate it?

The brother they idolized was actually being wronged by this shameless woman.

Qiao Mianmian, how could she!

Offending Qin Han’s fans had serious consequences.

The fans started to denounce Qiao Mianmian and asked her to apologize to Qin Han.

In an instant, Weibo was unprecedentedly active. The traffic exploded, and the entire Weibo was paralyzed for at least 10 minutes.

The Weibo programmers didn’t expect this day to be so lively.

The top 10 trending topics for the whole day were occupied by a female artiste.

This had never happened before.

…

Mo Yesi sent Qiao Mianmian to the filming location. Linda and Nana were already waiting at the door.

After Qiao Mianmian got out of the car, they immediately went forward.

Linda and Nana greeted Mo Yesi respectfully. “Chairman Mo.”

Although Mo Yesi wasn’t their boss, when they saw Mo Yesi, they couldn’t help but respect him. They were even more nervous than when they were in front of their boss.

Mo Yesi had the aura of someone in power for a long time, and his aura was much stronger than the president of Huan Yu.

Huan Yu’s president couldn’t be compared to Mo Yesi.

They weren’t in the same league.
