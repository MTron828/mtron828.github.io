Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Uncle Zhang looked at Qiao Mianmian worriedly.

“Mom, Second Aunt, what are you doing? A public trial?” The sudden voice made everyone’s expression change.

Uncle Zhang turned around and heaved a sigh of relief.

He took two steps forward. “Second Young Master.”

Mo Yesi nodded and walked straight towards Qiao Mianmian.

When he reached her, she looked at him in shock. “Why are you here?”

Mo Yesi pulled her into his arms and looked up at Madam Mo and Second Madam coldly.

Madam Mo and Second Madam were also shocked.

They didn’t expect him to return at this time.

“Ah Si, w-why are you back? Aren’t you at work?” Madam Mo asked.

Mo Yesi sneered. “If I don’t come back, I’m afraid my wife will be scared off by you.”

“Ha, haha, this marriage is really different. Even Ah Si knows how to joke now.” Second Madam’s eyes were a little guilty as she tried to lighten the mood.

“Joking?” Mo Yesi smiled, but his eyes were cold. “Second Aunt, do you think I’m joking with you?”

His voice was cold.

Every word he said was chilling. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

His eyes were as cold as ice.

Second Madam looked up and exchanged glances with him before looking away guiltily.

She was a little afraid of him.

“Ah Si, what are you doing?” Madam Mo frowned slightly. “How can you talk to your Second Aunt like this? Your Second Aunt and I are just chatting casually with Mianmian. No one will bully her. How can we scare her away?”

“Just chatting?” Mo Yesi couldn’t help but sneer. “Mom, I saw you and Second Aunt sitting the moment I came in, but Mianmian was standing and talking to you. What do you want to talk about that you don’t even let her take a seat?”

Madam Mo’s expression stiffened.

“Ah Si, you’re being unreasonable. We didn’t ask her to stand, she wanted to do it. I know you feel bad for your wife, but you can’t do this. You’re making it sound like your second aunt and I are bullying her on purpose.”

“Aren’t you?” Mo Yesi looked down at the girl in his arms and his eyes turned colder. “Calling Mianmian back while Grandma and I aren’t at home. You know very well what you’re thinking.

“I don’t care what you’re trying to do. I only know that Qiao Mianmian is my wife. If anyone wants to hurt my wife, I’ll take revenge, no matter who it is.”

When he said this, his cold gaze stopped on Second Madam for a few seconds.

“Second Aunt.” Mo Yesi hugged her tightly and said without any mercy, “You two settle your own matters with Second Uncle, don’t drag Mianmian into it. I call you Second Aunt because I respect you as an elder, but if I respect Second Aunt and Second Aunt hurts someone I care about, then don’t blame me for being heartless.”

Second Madam’s expression darkened.
