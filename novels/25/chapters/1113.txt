Chapter 1114: The Brands Came Looking For Them

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Butler Lin bowed slightly and said, “Young Master woke up very early. He has been gone for more than an hour.”

More than an hour?

Qiao Mianmian looked at the time and felt that it wasn’t easy to be the CEO.

She used to think that being a boss was easy.

She could sleep until she woke up naturally every day before going to the office.

Or she could rest when she wanted to, and she did not have to go to the office every day.

Even if she went to the company, she wouldn’t do much. She could knock off whenever she wanted.

Now she realized that she was completely wrong.

The higher the position, the less relaxed it was.

Many things had to be done personally.

“Is Young Madam going to visit Young Master at the company later? I’ll get someone to prepare the car in advance.” Butler Lin thought that she was going to the Mo Corporation to look for Mo Yesi.

Qiao Mianmian was about to speak when her phone rang.

She looked at the caller ID. It was Linda.

She immediately picked it up. “Sister Xie, what’s the matter?”

“Mianmian, you’re still in Yun Cheng, right?” Linda went straight to the point. “It’s like this, I just helped you accept a good advertisement. Since you have time these few days, you can shoot the advertisement.

“If you have time now, come over and we can discuss this in detail.”

Qiao Mianmian was stunned. “Advertisement? What advertisement?”

“It’s an advertisement for a cosmetics brand. It can be considered a high-end series. In short, accepting this advertisement will only be beneficial to you. There won’t be any disadvantages. Furthermore, the other party offered a very high price. I believe you will definitely be satisfied with the amount.

“This cosmetics brand used an A-list celebrity before. This is the first time they’re looking for a newcomer to shoot an advertisement. With their brand’s popularity, if you become the spokesperson for the new season, it will be very helpful to increase your popularity.”

Linda rambled on happily.

Qiao Mianmian could tell that she was very satisfied with the advertisement contract.

Qiao Mianmian asked curiously, “Sister Xie, which brand is it?”

Linda told her.

Qiao Mianmian was shocked when she found out what makeup brand she’d be advertising for.

“You’re talking about MC?! Sister Xie, are you sure you’re not mistaken? MC is asking for me?”

“There’s no mistake. It’s the MC. I didn’t pick it for you. They came to find you on their own accord. I’ll tell you the details when you get here. Are you free now?

“If you have time, send me the address. I’ll be right there.” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Qiao Mianmian was even more surprised when she heard that it was a brand that had come knocking.

MC was a big shot in the makeup world.

Just as Linda had said, every previous spokesperson was an A-list celebrity.

MC had never looked for a newcomer to endorse their company.

Furthermore, she was a newbie without much fame.

Even if she had participated in some scandals, she had little fame and few people knew her.

But her fame was nothing compared to the popular celebrities.

Moreover, hers were mostly anti-fans.

Under such circumstances, wouldn’t it be too strange for a top makeup brand to take the initiative to look for her as their spokesperson?

No matter what, it didn’t make sense.

Qiao Mianmian was full of questions and felt that this matter wasn’t as simple as it seemed.
