Chapter 793: You Did Well Today

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

At first, most people thought that it was an imitation account.

Even that anti-fan thought so as well.

But when someone clicked into the account and saw that it was the original account, Qiao Mianmian’s reply quickly became popular.

When the little fan found out that her idol actually helped her, she happily replied to Qiao Mianmian with a few tearful expressions, saying that she was so touched that she cried.

The other fans also replied to Qiao Mianmian, praising her for doing well.

Some of the bystanders saw Qiao Mianmian’s reply and expressed that they didn’t like or dislike Qiao Mianmian previously. They just felt that she was a passerby. But after seeing Qiao Mianmian tear apart the anti-fans personally, they suddenly wanted to turn into her fans.

Qiao Mianmian was the first idol to tear someone apart for her fans.

It didn’t matter if she was faking it or not. It was indeed easy to get others to like her.

Because of that, she realized that her fans had risen again.

Although the rate wasn’t fast, it was still increasing.

Moreover, the comments section was increasing rapidly.

Many fans who knew about her defamatory act felt proud of her.

At the same time, Linda called again.

Qiao Mianmian picked it up nervously.

She guessed that Linda must have known that she used her official account to scold the anti-fans and called her because of this.

Actually, Qiao Mianmian felt a little regretful for being too impulsive.

She’d only had two scandals previously, and her relationship with Tu Yilei had just calmed down.

She should have kept a low profile.

But she couldn’t help it.

That fan was scolded by the haters because she wanted to defend her. She couldn’t pretend that she didn’t see anything even though she saw it.

This wasn’t her style.

Hence, even though she was a little regretful and afraid, she would still do it if she had to choose again.

She couldn’t watch her fans get bullied.

“I’m sorry, Sister Xie. I know I did something wrong again. I’m really not a qualified artiste. If you regret it now, we can...”

Before she could say the word “terminate”, Linda chuckled. “I’m not here to blame you. I just want to praise you. Why are you apologizing to me?”

Qiao Mianmian was stunned. “Praise me?”

“Exactly.” Linda smiled again. “You did well today. You did two things right in a row. In a while, I’ll get someone to spread the news that you helped the fans tear someone apart.

“But you might be able to get onto the hot searches without my help. It’s only been less than 10 minutes, and you’re already at the last place on the trending list.”

Qiao Mianmian, who was already prepared to be scolded, was suddenly praised.

“Sister Xie, don’t you blame me?”

“Blame you for what?” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“Don’t you think that I shouldn’t use my own account to tear someone apart? Isn’t that bad?”

Anyway, she knew that the company wouldn’t allow other artistes to do this.

The more popular an artiste was, the more cautious they had to be.

Because 10,000 pairs of eyes were watching you every day. If you made even the slightest mistake or did anything wrong, it would be magnified 10,000 times and pointed out.
