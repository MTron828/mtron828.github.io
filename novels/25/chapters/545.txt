He hadn’t hidden it from her.

Whatever Shen Rou was saying now, he had already come clean with her. Qiao Mianmian didn’t think it was a big deal back then.

In fact, she felt better finding out about it.

After all, she was sure about what Mo Yesi was after when he’d asked to marry her.

Otherwise, given his eligibility, he couldn’t possibly get married to just any woman.

Not to mention get married so quickly with her.

It was normal that he married her because of that uniqueness.

Hence, she’d already come to terms with this. There was no point in Shen Rou bringing this up.

“So what?” Qiao Mianmian looked at the indignant and jealous Shen Rou. Her lips curled up slowly as she calmly said, “Even if what Miss Shen says is true, that he and I will break up in the future... at least I got to have him.

“I got to enjoy his care and love, to have a wonderful relationship with him. When I think about it in the future, I’ll remember it as a good memory. There’s nothing to regret.

“In any case, I’m much luckier than Miss Shen. You’ve been by his side for so long, and you were once his only female friend. In that sense, Miss Shen, you also have your uniqueness.

“But the person he chose eventually isn’t you.

“Oh, wait. He never chose you. To him, you’re just an old friend. He told me before that he treats you as a younger sister.

“So, even if I didn’t marry him, you wouldn’t have been the one. I really don’t know what Miss Shen is feeling indignant about.”

Qiao Mianmian walked around Shen Rou as she watched her expression become awful.

She walked towards Mo Yesi’s desk and pulled his leather chair out. Under the shocked and angry eyes of Shen Rou, she took a seat.

The black leather chair was extremely soft and comfy.

Qiao Mianmian felt that this really was the real deal.

It was so comfortable.

Shen Rou looked as if she was witnessing something utterly incredible. Her eyes were wide and angry. “Miss Qiao, Ah Si hates it when people use his things without asking for permission.

“How could you...”

“Oh.” Qiao Mianmian smiled and, before waiting for her to finish her sentence, picked up Mo Yesi’s mug and took a sip from it.

Shen Rou’s eyes widened even further.

The anger was even more evident as well.

“Miss Qiao, how could you touch others’ things like this?” Shen Rou fumed as if it was her item that was being messed with. “Ah Si has germophobia. He’ll get angry if you drink from his mug. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“You’re too rude.”

“Cleanliness freak?” Qiao Mianmian feigned shock as she looked amused. “Miss Shen, are you sure my husband has germophobia?”

The way she said “husband” annoyed Shen Rou.

She said coldly, “Of course. I’ve known Ah Si for over 20 years. I understand him well.”
