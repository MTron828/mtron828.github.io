Chapter 3012 She Grew Fatter Visibly

She didn’t want to eat four to five meals a day.

“Alright. Then, it’s fine that you brought supplements. Why did you buy a bunch of baby’s daily necessities?” Qiao Mianmian was amused. “It’s still early for the baby to be born, and you don’t even know the baby’s gender. You’re too proactive.” They were much more proactive than her. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“How is it early? It’s better to prepare early so that we won’t be flustered when the time comes.” Mother Bai chuckled as if she was experienced. “When I was pregnant with you and your brother back then, I also prepared these things early.

“Moreover, I bought things for both boys and girls. They will be useful.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

“Oh right, this is a little gift from your dad and me to our future grandchild.” Mother Bai held Qiao Mianmian’s hand and chatted for a while before taking out a thick stack of property transfer agreements from her bag.

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

Another small gift?

This so-called small gift was probably the same as what Old Madam gave her. It was a pile of luxury cars and mansions.

Qiao Mianmian looked down and saw many familiar words.

Things like half a mountain villa, yacht, private plane, and so on.

She frowned. “Mom, you should keep these for yourself and Dad. You’ve already given me a lot, I can’t accept so many things from you.” “That was for you, this is for my grandchild.” Mother Bai stuffed a thick stack of property transfer agreements into her hands. “You silly child, why are you being polite to your parents! Your dad and I only have two children, you and your brother. Our things will be given to you and your brother in the end.

“This is nothing. There will be more in the future!”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

Was this what it was like to have rich parents?

Getting luxurious cars and houses wasn’t rare anymore.

After all, there were several private planes.

Qiao Mianmian was once again aware of the so-called rich and willful.

She was once again aware of the power of the Bai family, which was on par with the Mo family. The Bai family, which was ranked among the top four families in Yuncheng City, was indeed extraordinarily rich.

Her family… was really impressive.

After Qiao Mianmian got pregnant, she became the focus of the Mo and Bai families.

Old Madam was worried about her and insisted on watching her closely. She got Qiao Mianmian to move to the old house and live with her.

Mother Bai was worried about her, too. After discussing, she moved into the Mo family’s old residence with her.

Although there were many people in the Mo Residence, not many people were close to Old Madam.

After Qiao Mianmian and Mother Bai moved in, the house became lively. Old Madam was in a good mood. After recuperating for a while, her body was much better.

Although Mother Bai and Old Madam were separated by a generation, they grew up in prestigious families. Their living environment and education were similar. The two of them had quite a lot of topics to talk about and could chat for a long time every day.

As for Qiao Mianmian, with Mother Bai taking care of her, Old Madam especially found three nutritionists to take care of her three meals a day during her pregnancy. After raising her like a pig for a few months, she visibly gained weight.

Although she was already very skinny and didn’t look fat, her face was much rounder than before and her waist was more fleshy.

At night. Mo Yesi put his arm around her and said, “Mother-in-law has a way to make you gain weight.”

The chubby Qiao Mianmian felt especially good.

Although it was good before, it was better now.
