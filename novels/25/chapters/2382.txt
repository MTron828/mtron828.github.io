Chapter 2385: Good, I Want Her

“Young Master Gong, you…”

“Scram!” Gong Zeli’s eyes were filled with disgust.

They were too scared to do anything when they looked into his eyes.

“Alright, alright. Come and drink with us.” The other rich second-generation heirs didn’t dare to anger him anymore. “Young Master Gong doesn’t like you guys.”

“Chen Lan even told me that these beauties are the best in Nightlight. I think they’re just so-so.”

“Call Chen Lan over here immediately. Is she trying to fool us with such trash?”

“It’s alright to fool us, but not Young Master Gong.”

“Yes, Young Master Gong has seen all sorts of beauties. Quickly get her over, we want to ask her.”

Gong Zeli listened to them as he sat quietly in the corner.

He exuded a distant aura as he lay on the sofa with his eyes half-opened, staring at the ceiling of the private room as if the world had nothing to do with him.

Soon, the waiter called Chen Lan over.

Chen Lan greeted respectfully, “Young Master Gong.”

She then greeted the other rich heirs.

“Young Masters, are you dissatisfied with anything?” Chen Lan asked cautiously.

“Of course, why else would I call you over?”

“Then, Young Masters…”

“Are the women you just called the best here?” RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Chen Lan was stunned for a moment before glancing at Gong Zeli cautiously.

Seeing no one around him, she understood.

When these rich second-generation heirs came, they got her to arrange everything for them beforehand. They said that Gong Zeli would be coming tonight and told her to prepare well.

It seemed like Young Master Gong didn’t like the women she arranged?

Those women were indeed top-notch beauties, but it was normal if Gong Zeli didn’t like them.

He had seen countless beauties, so his standards were naturally higher than others.

Chen Lan thought for a while and smiled apologetically. “Someone just came yesterday. She’s rather good-looking. But…”

“But what? Don’t dawdle.”

“She’s just a student who’s working part-time here. She doesn’t drink.”

“Student?”

“That’s right. She’s a serious university student. And she’s studying acting. She was forced to work temporarily, but she’s going to be a celebrity in the future.”

In the corner.

Gong Zeli glanced at Chen Lan.

A rich heir immediately saw his reaction.

He smiled and said, “Good. I want her. Call her over immediately.”

“This…” Chen Lan looked troubled.

“Why? You can’t?” The second-generation heir’s expression changed immediately.

“No, of course. I-I’ll get someone to call her over immediately.”

Chen Lan didn’t want to offend them.

These people weren’t to be trifled with.

Especially Young Master Gong.

This person was someone that even the entirety of Darklight couldn’t offend.

In less than 10 minutes, a waiter brought a girl in uniform over.
