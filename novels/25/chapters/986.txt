Chapter 987: Did You Buy This for Her?

“Don’t be afraid.” Madam Mo held her hand tightly and pursed her lips. “Aunt Mo will support you. You don’t have to be afraid.”

...

Half an hour later.

Shen Rou and Madam Mo arrived at the Mo Corporation building.

Shen Rou held Madam Mo’s arm and walked into the lobby confidently.

The moment Madam Mo appeared, the employees turned to look at her. The employees around her stopped in their tracks and greeted her respectfully. “Hello, Madam.”

Madam Mo didn’t come to the Mo Corporation often.

She’d only been here four or five times in all these years.

But everyone in the Mo Corporation knew her.

Mo Yesi looked like Madam Mo.

Hence, Madam Mo was also very good-looking.

The employees who saw her once or twice had a deep impression of her.

Those who hadn’t seen her before could guess that she had a close relationship with Mo Yesi.

Most of them knew Madam Mo.

But few knew Shen Rou.

These employees all knew that Chairman Mo already had a girlfriend, but now that they saw Madam Mo bring a young and beautiful girl over, they all guessed Shen Rou’s identity.

Those who knew Shen Rou’s identity couldn’t help but gossip when they saw this scene.

Chairman Mo’s girlfriend was still with him.

But Madam Mo brought Young Lady Shen along. It seemed like a good show was about to happen.

Did Young Lady Shen bring Madam Mo here to show off?

And judging from how intimate they were, their relationship seemed pretty good.

One was Chairman Mo’s girlfriend, and the other was the girl Chairman Mo’s mother liked.

Who would Chairman Mo choose in the end?

Just as Madam Mo and Shen Rou entered the living room, Wei Zheng returned with some clothes.

He walked into the living room with the bags of clothes and felt that the atmosphere wasn’t right. When he looked forward and saw that Madam Mo was actually here, his expression changed, and he immediately went forward to greet her respectfully. “Madam.”

Madam Mo turned around and saw that it was Wei Zheng. “Is Chairman Mo in the office?”

Wei Zheng tightened his grip on the bag, not daring to even breathe. “Madam, Chairman Mo is here.”

Madam Mo nodded again and continued walking.

But Shen Rou didn’t take a step forward. Her gaze landed on the bag of clothes in Wei Zheng’s hand. When she saw that it was a female clothing brand, her expression darkened. She clenched her teeth and asked, “Assistant Wei, who did you get this for?”

Madam Mo hadn’t noticed this at first.

She looked over and saw Wei Zheng carrying two bags of clothes. “Assistant Wei, did you just get some clothes?”

Wei Zheng didn’t even dare to breathe when he was being stared at by both of them. He held his breath and nodded. “Madam and Miss Shen, this... Chairman Mo asked me to buy it.”

Shen Rou quickly thought of a possibility. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Her expression darkened even more. “Is Qiao Mianmian here too? Did you buy this for her?”

This wasn’t the first time Mo Yesi ordered Wei Zheng to do something like this.

Hence, he knew very well what Chairman Mo and Young Madam did in the office.
