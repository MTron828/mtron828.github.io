Chapter 2184: But Everyone Still Thought She Was Terrible

“Mo Yesi is already engaged, and the date is already set. Doesn’t that mean there’s no hope for Shen Rou?” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“Before they got engaged, she didn’t have any hope. She’d always been the one chasing after him. After so many years, she still couldn’t catch up.”

“Sigh. Shen Rou is rather pitiful. She must be very upset now.”

“How pitiful. Sigh, I didn’t expect that the high and mighty Miss Shen would have such a day.”

“Shen Rou’s face is turning green. The man she has liked for so many years is marrying another woman now. She must have suffered a huge blow.”

“I think it’s more than that. Didn’t they say that Young Master Gong likes her? But didn’t you realize that the Gong family didn’t help when something happened to her family? It’s hard to say if Young Master Gong really likes her. Even if he does, it isn’t anything serious. Otherwise, why wouldn’t he help the Shen family?”

“Gong Zeli is also here tonight. He doesn’t seem to have interacted with Shen Rou. I think the rumors are all false. Gong Zeli doesn’t like her at all. Maybe she spread the rumor herself to raise her status.”

“That’s right. Previously, she said that Gong Zeli liked her very much and wouldn’t marry anyone else. When the Shen family was in trouble, didn’t she go on blind dates everywhere? Why didn’t Gong Zeli marry her?”

“To be honest, Mo Yesi’s fiancée is more eligible than her. Most men like her looks. Shen Rou looks a little domineering, so most men don’t like her. She even took over the Shen Corporation and wants to be a strong woman. Most men probably stop at just staring at her.

“That’s right. Such women are too strong. Men don’t like them. She doesn’t lack money, why should she pretend to be strong? It’s better to find a good man to spend time with at home.”

The group of women was discussing.

Moreover, they were standing beside Shen Rou, so she heard everything they said.

Her already awful expression was getting worse.

Her face darkened and she clenched her fists as she listened to their mocking.

She wanted to rush over and slap them, but she couldn’t.

She tried her best to suppress her anger, but her body still trembled.

Her trembling was seen by others, and the mocking voices increased.

“Shen Rou seems to have suffered a terrible blow. Did you see that? She’s shaking from the sadness. So pitiful.”

“Yes, she’s really pitiful.”

“Sigh, love is love.”

“What’s so pitiful about her? She’s the one clinging onto others.”

“Forget it, let’s not talk about it anymore. Anyway, she’s in a terrible state. She must be feeling terrible right now.”

The women gloated for a while and felt that it was meaningless.

But their words were like daggers to Shen Rou’s heart.

Everyone felt that she was miserable.

Even if she had already taken over the Shen Corporation and become one of the few female CEOs, everyone still felt that she was miserable.

Because Mo Yesi didn’t want her.

He made her a joke.
