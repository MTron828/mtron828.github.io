Chapter 1269: She Regrets Now

Until she lost it...

She suddenly realized that he was also an outstanding man.

He was also the man many women dreamed of.

He was also a genius.

This man used to treat her like a treasure.

But at that time, she didn’t know how to cherish him and even took his kindness for granted.

Now she regretted it.

But he wasn’t willing to give her another chance.

Shen Rou stood outside for a while before walking in slowly. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

The sparring partner noticed her immediately and glanced at her.

Gong Zeli turned around too.

Shen Rou couldn’t see his eyes clearly through the helmet, but she could feel his cold and distant aura.

Gong Zeli looked at her for a second before looking away.

Shen Rou waited for almost half an hour before Gong Zeli finished practicing. He took off his helmet and handed his sword to his subordinate.

Another subordinate handed him a bottle of water.

He took it and drank half the bottle.

The subordinate who handed him a towel to wipe his sweat looked at Shen Rou, who was still standing at the side, and hesitated for a while before reminding him, “Young Master, Miss Shen is here.”

Everyone on Gong Zeli’s side knew that he valued Shen Rou.

They also knew that Gong Zeli had liked Shen Rou for many years.

They even treated her as their future Young Madam.

Hence, many people were puzzled by Gong Zeli’s attitude towards Shen Rou.

In the past, when Miss Shen came over, no matter what Young Master was doing, he would always see Miss Shen first.

Today...

Not only did he not pick Miss Shen up, he even made her wait for half an hour.

He seemed to be ignoring her.

This was the first time.

Was Young Master in conflict with Miss Shen?

“Zeli.” Shen Rou waited patiently for half an hour. Seeing that Gong Zeli was still so cold to her, she couldn’t take it. “Are you done? If you are, can we talk?”

Gong Zeli turned to look at her.

He frowned. “Why are you here?”

Shen Rou’s expression stiffened, and she clenched her fists. “Zeli, I’m here for something very important. Can... can we talk alone?”

Gong Zeli wiped the sweat off his face. “Something important? What is it?”

Shen Rou looked at the people around her and asked, “Can you ask them to leave?”

Gong Zeli stared at her for a while before instructing the rest of the people in the room. “You guys can leave.”

A moment later.

Only the two of them were left in the room.

Gong Zeli sat down. “Can you say it now?”

He looked a little impatient as if he wanted to dismiss her.

Shen Rou’s expression stiffened again.

She bit her lip and said, “Zeli, I... I’m here to discuss an investment proposal with you.”

“Investment?”

Gong Zeli looked up as if he’d heard something funny. “Shen Rou, you said you wanted to discuss investments with me? You’re not kidding?”

“It’s not a joke.”

Shen Rou was used to being arrogant and had never begged anyone.

If she asked for help, it would be like pressing her head against the ground.
