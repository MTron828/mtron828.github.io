Translator: Atlas StudiosEditor: Atlas Studios

“Sister, time flies.” On the other side of the island, Qiao Chen looked at the waves and couldn’t help but sigh. “In the blink of an eye, you’re already married and I’m in university. It feels like a dream.”

There were only the siblings here.

Qiao Mianmian hadn’t talked to Qiao Chen alone in a long time.

She also hadn’t seen him in a long time.

After Qiao Chen went to university, he didn’t return to Yuncheng City except for the winter and summer holidays.

Qiao Mianmian heard from Mo Yesi that besides managing his father’s company, Qiao Chen had also established his own company in university.

In less than half a year, it had reached a certain scale.

Of course, Mo Yesi helped.

But he didn’t help much.

The company was able to start from a loss in the beginning to a profit in a month and then earn more than 10 million in half a year. It was basically all Qiao Chen’s doing.

Mo Yesi admired his cousin and brother-in-law very much. He had praised Qiao Chen more than once in front of her, saying that he was young and promising and had a good mind in business management.

Qiao Mianmian was also proud of her brother’s excellence.

She’d always felt that Qiao Chen was especially smart since he was young, and she firmly believed that he’d be able to achieve something in the future.

Now, looking at her brother, who was a head taller than her, Qiao Mianmian felt very emotional.

Who said so?

Time flew.

“Sister, you and Brother-in-law have such a good relationship, and Brother-in-law has always pampered you. I’m so envious of you.” The once inexperienced young man had already transformed into a handsome young man with a steady temperament and firm eyes. Compared to the stunningly

handsome young man in the past, he was more attractive now.

This was the Mo family’s unique aura.

‘Mo Yesi had it, Mo Shixiu had it, and now Qiao Chen had it too.

In the past, Qiao Chen was good-looking, but he was the type that people could get their hands on.

There was something in his eyes that no one dared to approach.

No one who saw him would think that he was a good person.

Of course, Qiao Mianmian would never be included. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Inher eyes, no matter how powerful Qiao Chen became in the future, he was still that brat who would follow her around and ask for candy.

Qiao Mianmian could tell something from Qiao Chen’s words. She looked at her confused brother and placed a hand on his shoulder. “Chen Chen, are you and Shen Xin alright?

“You’re an adult now, I shouldn’t ask too much about your relationship. But you’ve been entangled with Shen Xin for so long, don’t you want to let go?”

“Sister, besides Shen Xin, I don’t want anyone else.” Although Qiao Chen’s eyes were confused, his voice was firm. “Unless she gets married one day and finds a very good husband and has a very happy family. Otherwise, I won’t let her go.”

“You…” Qiao Mianmian wanted to say something, but in the end, she sighed. “Your brother-in-law told me that all the men in the Mo family are loyal and devoted. It seems like it’s true.”

‘Mo Yunchen’s feelings for Tang Wangiu had always been there. If he hadn’t had to fulfill his obligations, he would definitely have chosen to marry her.

And Qiao Chen’s father.
