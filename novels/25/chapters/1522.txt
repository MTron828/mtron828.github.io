Chapter 1523: No Matter What, You Can’t Hate Me

“If you feel pressured, what will happen? Will you slowly hate me because of this?”

He knew that doing this would put pressure on her.

He was just... too afraid of losing her.

“Qiao Mianmian, do you hate me?” The man asked again.

“How could I hate you?” Qiao Mianmian sighed again and held his hand. She looked up at him seriously and said, “Mo Yesi, I know you care about me. I don’t hate you. I just hope that you can trust me more and have more confidence in yourself.

“You’re so good. Everyone says that I saved the galaxy in my previous life to meet you. I’ve always thought so too. I relied on saving the galaxy to find such a good husband like you. I’ll cherish this luck for the rest of my life.

“So, you don’t have to worry about anyone snatching me away. Someone has already taken root in my heart. There’s no place for anyone else.

“My husband is the best man in the world. With such a good husband, how can I look at anyone else?”

The coldness in the man’s eyes dissipated, and the warmth returned.

Seeing this, Qiao Mianmian continued praising him. “Such a good husband, I can’t even wait to like him, how could I hate him? If someone has to worry, it should be me. My husband is so good, what if someone else takes him away?”

The man smiled.

Qiao Mianmian looked up at him and said seriously, “Mo Yesi, you really don’t have to worry. I’m yours, for the rest of my life. You really don’t have to worry about others snatching me away. Unless you don’t want me one day, I won’t leave you.”

“How could I not want you?” Mo Yesi hugged her tightly. “Even if you don’t want me one day, I won’t let you go. Qiao Mianmian, I want you for your whole life. I understand what you mean. I’ll give you more freedom in the future.

“I’ll change if you don’t like me pushing you too hard. No matter what, you can’t hate me.”

“Mm, I don’t hate you.” Qiao Mianmian hugged the insecure man in front of her as if she was coaxing a child. “Mo Yesi, no matter what, I won’t hate you.”

...

When Qiao Mianmian had to return to the filming location, Mo Yesi sent her there.

He then left.

The moment Mo Yesi left, a group of female crew members surrounded her. They all excitedly asked her, “Mianmian, was that your boyfriend? Is he here to visit?”

Qiao Mianmian nodded. “Mm, that’s my boyfriend.” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“Wow, your boyfriend is so handsome. He’s so much more handsome in person than in the photos. What kind of godly boyfriend is this? His looks are enough to enter the entertainment industry.”

“Your boyfriend is so nice. He even came to visit. I saw the way he looked at you just now.”

“Are all the handsome guys hanging out with the handsome guys now? Young Master Gong and your boyfriend’s looks are way better than many young male idols in the entertainment industry.”

They were envious.

They wondered why she was so lucky.

She was already a winner at 20.

Not only did she find a super handsome boyfriend, but the man was also super rich and valued her so much.
