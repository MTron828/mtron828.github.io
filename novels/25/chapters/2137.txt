Chapter 2139: She Was Indignant

She couldn’t describe her anger.

She knew that Mo Yesi doted on Qiao Mianmian, but she didn’t know how much he pampered her.

But now, she roughly understood it.

But she’d rather not know.

Because now she was even angrier.

Mo Yesi knew how to boil brown sugar water for others?

She’d known him for over 20 years, but she didn’t know he could do this.

It wasn’t that he couldn’t do it, but Shen Rou didn’t think anyone could make him do that.

He was Mo Yesi.

How could he cook for a woman?

No matter how much he liked a woman, she couldn’t imagine him doing this for her.

He still remembered Qiao Mianmian’s period every month and knew not to let her eat cold food.

Shen Rou wanted to laugh.

She felt that it was ironic.

She felt that she knew Mo Yesi very well. No one knew him better than her.

She was the only woman who’d stayed by his side for over 20 years.

Besides his family, she was the only woman who could stay by his side for over 20 years.

She thought she was special.

But in the end, she realized that she was a joke.

What she thought was special was just her wishful thinking.

In Mo Yesi’s heart, she was no different from any other woman. To him, the so-called special treatment was probably just being friends.

Ordinary friends at that.

She thought too highly of herself.

She only understood this after being hit by reality.

She thought that she could accept everything, but hearing how much Mo Yesi cared for Qiao Mianmian and how much he doted on her, she couldn’t remain calm.

She never understood why Mo Yesi didn’t choose her.

What was wrong with her?

She was indignant!

Shen Rou clenched her fists and bit her lip.

“Miss Shen, your coffee.” The waiter walked over and placed a cup of coffee on the table. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

The freshly brewed coffee was still steaming.

Shen Rou took a sip, then pushed the chair away, stood up, and walked out.

Walking around the potted plant, she saw Mo Yesi and Qiao Mianmian sitting next to her.

Qiao Mianmian was holding a spoon and feeding Mo Yesi a spoonful of dessert.

Mo Yesi frowned, but his voice was gentle. “Baby, eat it yourself. I don’t like sweet food.”

“Have a bite, it’s delicious.” Qiao Mianmian brought the spoon to his mouth again. “Just one bite.”

Mo Yesi looked at her helplessly but still opened his mouth.

“How is it?” Qiao Mianmian asked. “Is it good?”

“Mm.” Mo Yesi nodded. “It’s alright.”

“Then, do you want more?” Qiao Mianmian fed him another spoonful. “This bowl of desserts is too much, I can’t finish it alone. Can you eat a little more? You eat one spoonful, I’ll eat one spoonful, we’ll each have half.”

“Baby…”

“I’ve already had breakfast with you, just have dessert with me. Come, open your mouth, ah…”

Mo Yesi didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.

“You know you’re treating me like a three-year-old, right?”
