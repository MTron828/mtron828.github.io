Chapter 2744: Do You Like It Here?

Qiao Anxin smiled again. “Isn’t my face especially similar to Qiao Mianmian’s now? I know that you like my face even if you don’t say anything. Your eyes tell me everything. Su Ze, you’re obsessed with my face, right?”

Su Ze was a little embarrassed by her words. He looked away, but he couldn’t help but sneer. “So what if you look alike? It’s still fake in the end. Don’t overthink it. I’m not interested in high-quality imitations at all.”

“Haha, a high-quality imitation?” Qiao Anxin was angered by his words. She gritted her teeth and sneered. “Then, weren’t you captivated by my high-quality imitation just now? If you’re really not interested, why did you stare at my face for so long?

“Su Ze, don’t think you’re so great. We’re not any nobler than each other now. Do you think others can look down on you just because you look down on me? Do you think you’re still the Young Master Su that everyone treats kindly wherever you go?

“Don’t forget, the Su Corporation has long been acquired by the Mo Corporation. You’re still working for the Young Master Gong, relying on him to give you a meal!”

Su Ze turned around and glared at her. “You...”

“What about me? Am I wrong?” Qiao Anxin wasn’t afraid of him at all. She smiled mockingly and continued to add fuel to the fire. “Su Ze, look at yourself. Ever since you fell from grace, who else in your circle is willing to continue interacting with you? VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Only me...” Qiao Anxin didn’t seem to notice Su Ze’s increasingly awful expression. She smiled and leaned closer to him, her breath landing on his face. She looked at Su Ze’s eyes, which were gradually becoming infatuated again.

“Su Ze, you only have me by your side now. So, don’t look down on me. We’re on the same boat now. Only by working together can we get better in the future.”

She caressed Su Ze’s handsome face and smiled. “I need you to make me popular. I want to take back everything that once belonged to me.”

Including the man she couldn’t forget.

...

Qiao Mianmian stayed in F City for three days. After the advertisement, she flew back to Yuncheng City.

She had promised Mo Yesi that she would spare a few days to take their wedding photos. After resting for a day and recovering her energy, Mo Yesi took her overseas.

The location he had chosen to take their wedding photos was a beautiful island.

The island was decorated as beautifully as a fairytale. It was enough to satisfy Qiao Mianmian’s heart.

“Mo Yesi, this place is so beautiful.”

There was a white castle on the island. Qiao Mianmian stood on the highest level and looked down. It was sunset, and the sky seemed to be burning. The orange sky reflected into the sea, making it look like it was burning from afar.

The sea breeze blew against her face.

Behind her, the man’s warm and firm chest pressed against her back, and his arm wrapped around her slender waist. His low and alluring voice was accompanied by the sea breeze. “Baby, do you like it here?”

“Mm, I like it!” Qiao Mianmian’s eyes sparkled. “This place is too beautiful, I like it so much.. Mo Yesi, how did you know about this place?”
