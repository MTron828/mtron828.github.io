Chapter 916: Please Don’t Reject Me

Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Then, Mr. Mo is...”

Mo Shixiu’s eyes were as dark as ink. When he looked at her, Jiang Luoli’s heart couldn’t help but race, and her face started to burn.

There was a kind of person who, when looking into his eyes, would feel that his gaze was especially focused as if he only had eyes for you.

Mo Shixiu was such a person.

Jiang Luoli knew that it was an illusion, but her heart skipped a beat when she met his eyes.

At that moment, she couldn’t help but be tempted.

“Miss Jiang, I want to make it up to you again. Tell me what you need me to do for you. As long as it’s something I can do, I’ll agree to it.”

Mo Shixiu thought about it for a while and finally attributed his unusual behavior to his guilt towards her.

Because he still felt like he owed her, he thought of her from time to time.

Hence, if she was the one who suggested the compensation, as long as he did it, there wouldn’t be any more abnormalities.

As long as he didn’t continue to owe her, he wouldn’t think about her anymore.

His life could return to normal.

Mo Shixiu desperately wanted his life to return to normal.

“You want to make it up to me again?” Jiang Luoli looked at him in surprise.

“Mm. Miss Jiang, have you thought of any compensation?” Mo Shixiu smiled and asked gently.

“But, didn’t you already give me 50 million yuan?” Jiang Luoli wasn’t a greedy person. “I think this compensation is enough. Mr. Mo, you don’t have to compensate me anymore.”

He didn’t owe her anything.

In fact, she felt that he was the one at a disadvantage.

“Miss Jiang, I’ve already said that using that sum of money as compensation is the wrong decision. I hope you can make some other request. Do you have anything you want to do, perhaps something you want?”

Jiang Luoli said, “Mr. Mo, that night... I did it willingly. You really have nothing to be sorry about. You don’t have to make it up to me.”

“But, I hope you can make a request.” Mo Shixiu looked at her steadily and seemed a little insistent on this matter. “Miss Jiang, I really hope to make it up to you again. If you don’t think you need any compensation at the moment, you can consider it before replying to me.

“But please, don’t reject me.”

Jiang Luoli was speechless.

This was the first time she met such a man.

He had to make it up to her.

And it seemed especially urgent and persistent as if she would hurt him if she didn’t agree.

“Mr. Mo, I...”

“Miss Jiang, if you can’t think of it now, you can think about it when you get back.” Mo Shixiu was rarely rude and interrupted her. “There’s no rush. I’ll do it for you no matter what you ask.”

Jiang Luoli was speechless.

“I didn’t deliberately snub you that morning. I left early because I had something urgent to attend to.” Mo Shixiu didn’t know why he was telling her this, but he wanted to clear things up.

He didn’t want her to misunderstand him.

“After that, I thought about some things and felt that it wasn’t convenient for us to meet, so I got Assistant Xu to contact you. I didn’t do it properly and made Miss Jiang feel aggrieved. I have to apologize to Miss Jiang again.”

Jiang Luoli didn’t know what to do with his attitude.
