Chapter 44: Mo Yesi, Thank You

*

They arrived at the hospital.

Qiao Chen was eating and watching TV.

He was very happy to see that Qiao Mianmian was here and called her warmly, “Sister.”

“Hello.” Qiao Mianmian saw that he was in a much better mood as compared to when he came out of the emergency room and was very reassured. “What did you eat at night? How do you feel now?”

“In the evening, brother-in-law sent me dinner, which is much better than the meal in the hospital cafeteria. I’ve eaten everything. Brother-in-law also bought a lot of very expensive supplements for me.”

After Qiao Chen said this, he turned his attention to Mo Yesi and said a little shyly, “Thank you, brother-in-law.”

Mo Yesi said “Welcome” softly.

Qiao Mianmian then saw a lot of bags piled up on the coffee table and on the sofa.

All kinds of expensive supplements.

All the flowers in the ward had been replaced with the freshest bouquets.

She froze for a few seconds, then turned her head with grateful eyes. “Mo Yesi, thank you.”

She didn’t expect that this man would be so attentive to Qiao Chen.

He hadn’t spoken empty words when he said that he would take good care of them in the future.

Mo Yesi’s dark eyes squinted and he glanced down at her, saying in a low voice, “Thank me? Have you forgotten what I’ve told you?”

Qiao Mianmian froze and her eyelashes twitched slightly. She remembered what he had said to her before.

He had said that he didn’t want to hear the words “thank you” from her mouth anymore.

However, at this moment, apart from expressing her gratitude with these two words, she didn’t know what else to say.

“Sister, brother-in-law.” Qiao Chen’s black eyes, almost identical to Qiao Mianmian’s, flicked back and forth between them as he wondered. “What are you talking about?”

“Uh, nothing.”

Qiao Mianmian avoided Mo Yesi’s gaze. She walked quickly to the bed and took out an orange from the fruit basket. “Chen Chen, do you want an orange? I’ll peel one for you.”

Qiao Chen blinked and looked at Mo Yesi again. After thinking for a few seconds, he shook his head and said, “I don’t want to eat oranges. Sister, I really want to eat the buns from the bun shop near the hospital. Can you buy some for me?”

“You want to eat buns?”

It was rare to hear Qiao Chen say that he wanted to eat something, so of course, Qiao Mianmian agreed immediately. “Okay, I’ll buy some for you.”

Mo Yesi was about to open his mouth and suggest that his bodyguards buy it. But suddenly, he realized that Qiao Chen was deliberately trying to steer Qiao Mianmian away.

He seemed to have something to say to him. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

After Qiao Mianmian left.

Mo Yesi pulled out a chair and sat down, his slender legs overlapping at will. He raised his eyes to look at Qiao Chen, who was fiddling nervously.

Looking at the nervous and shy look of the delicate-looking teenager on the hospital bed, Mo Yesi gently smiled. “Is there something you want to tell me?”

He was very similar to his sister.

They were both timid and shy.

In front of this pair of siblings, Mo Yesi was much more patient and temperamental.

When he spoke to Qiao Chen, his attitude was already very mild.

However, Qiao Chen didn’t really feel much gentleness from him...

He felt like his brother-in-law’s aura was too strong. Wherever he was, he had the aura of an Emperor.

Staying alone with him in a room, Qiao Chen felt particularly stressed.

He summoned his courage before looking up at Mo Yesi. “Brother-in-law, can I ask you a question?”
