Chapter 607: You Know That I Dislike Her

“Should we still continue?”

The people said in fear, “Miss Shen, why didn’t you tell us that she knows Young Master Gong?”

Shen Rou clenched her teeth, and her expression was awful.

She remained silent. The others asked again cautiously, “Miss Shen, do we still continue? If yes... you will have to pay extra so we can continue working.”

“No need.” Shen Rou clenched her fist. “Everybody stop. Remember our non-disclosure agreement. No matter what happens, you cannot expose that I was behind this, or else...”

That person had already started taking action.

No matter how many more bots she hired, her attempts would be futile.

She might even expose herself if she continued this.

Once Mo Yesi decided to do something, no one could stop him.

She thought that he would be angry after seeing the news on Weibo.

Even though he wouldn’t fully trust it, he would be bothered by it.

So, he would no longer trust Qiao Mianmian fully.

She knew Mo Yesi well.

He was a very egoistic man. How could he tolerate seeing his wife and her ex-boyfriend together?

That was why she took some photos and videos when Su Ze met up with Qiao Mianmian. Then, she hired some bots to accuse Qiao Mianmian online.

Everything was going smoothly at the start.

If not for Gong Zeli’s clarifications.

She did not expect that the person to ruin her plans would be him.

The person that was always by her side and would never reject any of her requests. But this time, he actually helped a woman she hated.

He knew very well that she disliked Qiao Mianmian.

But he still helped her.

This showed that he did not take her seriously. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

So what if they had known each other since young?

After all, he was still unreliable.

She grew up together with Mo Yesi and Gong Zeli. But both had deeply hurt her because of Qiao Mianmian.

She liked Mo Yesi for over 20 years.

But in the end, he chose to marry a woman he had only known for a few days.

Gong Zeli said that he would stay by her side. But now, he actually helped someone she despised.

Knowing that she would be unhappy, he still helped her.

Shen Rou’s heart turned cold. Feeling angry yet disappointed, she couldn’t help but call Gong Zeli.

After some time, he picked up the phone. She couldn’t hold back her anger and asked coldly, “Ze Li, what’s with your recent Weibo post?”

Gong Zeli replied after a few seconds of silence, “It’s what you saw. Why?”

Shen Rou was slightly taken aback.

She was even more disappointed.

She never imagined that he would admit it so easily.

He didn’t even try to explain it to her.

He never used to be like this.

In the past, when she asked something, he would explain it to her clearly.

Feeling betrayed, she lost her rationality. She said with a sharp and aggressive tone, “Why did you help Qiao Mianmian? You know very well that I dislike her.

“Ze Li, are you smitten by her? Didn’t you say that you will definitely help me if I asked? But why did you have to help Qiao Mianmian?”
