Chapter 138: He Was Already Being Very Respectful Towards Her

She had a fiancé with whom she shared 10 years of a relationship with. How could she possibly just forget about him overnight?

Even though she didn’t seem to be bothered by him at all, it wasn’t possible that she felt nothing for Su Ze.

And for Su Ze?

Men knew men better than they did women.

He could tell at one glance that Su Ze still had her in his heart.

If she happened to have the same feeling towards him, it wouldn’t be unlikely for them to patch up in due time.

He simply couldn’t feel secure with a marriage that was more true in its name than in its act.

It would only help him be at ease if she was going to be his woman fully and willingly.

Qiao Mianmian gulped apprehensively as she kept her eyes on him.

She was about to say something when the man kissed her on the forehead and said tenderly, “Alright, go on out. Baby, think about what I said. I’m a normal person, it feels awful to have to hold it in like this all the time. One week is enough for you to get adjusted and ready.”

...

Qiao Mianmian walked out of the bathroom, her face still reddened.

Her heart rate couldn’t go down.

She was still thinking about Mo Yesi’s words.

He was obviously reminding her that he could only hold out for two more days without touching her.

After one week was up, he wouldn’t tolerate it this way anymore.

Hence, it was best that she got herself mentally prepared in the next two days.

That, in fact, he was already being very respectful of her.

He knew that she hadn’t adjusted yet and so gave her a week’s time.

He was already having it so hard, but he still did all he could to resist his desire.

All along, he didn’t have to do this.

If he really wanted to do it with her, she shouldn’t be able to reject him, based on their agreement.

The image of Mo Yesi’s eyes full of desire filled her mind. Qiao Mianmian’s heart pounded quickly as she recalled the man who took her virginity by force. He had once looked at her with such eyes.

Qiao Mianmian couldn’t calm down on that thought.

According to what Uncle Li had said, Mo Yesi never had another woman before.

So, he should still be... untouched?

Although they had only been married a few days, and she didn’t know him that well yet, she could tell that he was extremely particular about his work life and love life being organized and “clean”.

Then, could he... accept that she was no longer a virgin?

If he realized that his wife was actually not a virgin, would he be angry, disappointed, and disgusted by her?

Her mind was in a mess when she heard a ringtone again.

It was Mo Yesi’s cell phone ringing.

Qiao Mianmian glanced at it and saw the words “Shen Rou” on the screen.

It wasn’t an unfamiliar name to her.

As she recalled what Yan Shaoqing told her about on the phone, Qiao Mianmian figured that this Young Lady Shen must be calling to inform Mo Yesi about her arrival the next day.

The phone rang for the third time. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Qiao Mianmian was about to hand it to Mo Yesi, but that was when the bathroom door opened.

Mo Yesi was in his sleep attire, walking out of the bathroom.

The man had a black silk night robe revealing a little of his chest. His hair was still damp and droplets of water rolled down his forehead, along his nose bridge, down to his sexy lips...
