Chapter 2529: But It Was Actually Tang Ya Who Was Controlling It

“What Chairman Shen needs to do now is to salvage your image.”

Shen Rou bit her lip and looked awful. She kept quiet for a while before saying coldly, “Alright, inform the public relations department to do it immediately. Also, contact Chairman Chen and Chairman Wang immediately. I have to meet them now.

“No matter what, we can’t lose those collaborations!”

“Yes, Chairman Shen. I’ll arrange it right away.” The assistant quickly turned and left the office.

After he left, Shen Rou’s expression darkened even more.

She knew it, too.

Once those collaborations were canceled, it would be a huge blow to the Shen Corporation.

Even with Tang Ya’s help.

But Tang Ya didn’t always help.

In fact, besides helping the Shen Corporation when it was about to go bankrupt, Tang Ya didn’t interfere in the company’s matters anymore.

Shen Rou knew very well why Tang Ya helped them.

She knew that she wasn’t a good person.

Hence, Tang Ya couldn’t possibly help the Shen Corporation for no reason.

And she even spent such a huge sum.

She had asked her what she wanted to help the Shen Corporation.

Firstly, she wanted Shen Rou to take over the company.

Secondly, she wanted Shen Rou to find a partner.

These weren’t overboard requests.

It was even beneficial to her.

Hence, Shen Rou agreed without hesitation.

Later, she followed Tang Ya’s instructions and made a few deals.

She was even more obedient to Tang Ya now.

On the surface, she was in charge of the Shen Corporation.

But in fact, it was Tang Ya who was controlling it.

Although Shen Rou had taken over the Shen Corporation and was a capable woman in public, she wasn’t very good at business.

If it wasn’t for Tang Ya’s guidance, she wouldn’t receive the approval of the shareholders so quickly.

Hence, Shen Rou immediately thought of asking her for help.

After her assistant left, she immediately called Tang Ya.

After a few rings, Tang Ya picked it up.

A lazy voice came from the phone. “Shen Rou, why are you looking for me?” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Miss Tang.” Shen Rou acted like a boss in front of her assistant, but when she spoke to Tang Ya, her tone was much more polite. “I’m not sure if I disturbed Miss Tang’s rest, but I do have something important to discuss with you.”

“It’s fine. I’m free, anyway. What is it?”

“Miss Tang, I’ve already talked to the few partners you introduced me to previously according to your instructions. I was about to confirm a few partnerships, but something suddenly happened.”

“Mm? Which cooperation are you talking about?”

Tang Ya sounded nonchalant.

But Shen Rou couldn’t help but feel a little nervous. She gripped her cell phone tightly and said, “The few companies that Miss Tang introduced me to.”

She then told Tang Ya everything her assistant told her.
