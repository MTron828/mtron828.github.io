Chapter 673: Sister Mianmian, You Were Too Beautiful Just Now

But when Qiao Mianmian was done with her makeup, her expression darkened.

This was because even though it was just a simple makeup, the effect was no different from a professional job.

Moreover, she wasn’t sure if it was a coincidence or if Qiao Mianmian was just lucky.

Her makeup matched the third female lead’s.

Qiao Mianmian didn’t care about the makeup artist’s reaction. After she was done with her makeup, she grabbed the remaining time and combed her hair with the comb on the table. She thought about the third female lead’s looks in the original novel and started to do her hair.

Thankfully, the original novel had a simple description of the third female lead’s appearance.

The third female lead was a natural beauty.

She usually wore a white t-shirt, jeans, and sneakers.

Qiao Mianmian was the most experienced in getting her hair done.

She usually dressed like the third female lead in the original novel.

Including the outfit she was wearing today. A white t-shirt, jeans, and white canvas shoes.

She only took a minute to tie her hair up.

As for changing, she looked at the clothes she was wearing and felt that there was no need to change.

It only took her 15 minutes to settle everything.

There were only 10 minutes left before the shoot began.

The group of female artistes, including the makeup artist, froze for a few seconds when they saw Qiao Mianmian stand up.

Especially the makeup artist. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Her expression was awful.

Without her help and time, this newbie actually managed to do her makeup and hairstyle so calmly.

They only informed her when there was only half an hour left before the shoot began.

But she was sure that she wouldn’t be able to finish it.

Who knew...

How was she going to explain this to Huang Yilin?

Qiao Mianmian smiled and said, “Thank you for your makeup.”

The makeup artist was speechless.

Was she doing this on purpose?

“Nana, let’s go.”

Beside her, Nana was still in a daze. It was only when Qiao Mianmian walked up to her and patted her on the shoulder that she snapped out of her daze and was dragged out of the dressing room by Qiao Mianmian.

Outside.

Nana couldn’t contain her excitement. “Wow, Sister Mianmian, you were so beautiful just now.”

The makeup artist looked so angry that her face was turning green.

As for the other female artistes gloating over their misfortune, she felt so good when she saw how stunned they were.

“Sister Mianmian, you’re a natural beauty. You’re so pretty even with makeup on. Didn’t you see how awful the makeup artist looked when you put on your makeup? She definitely didn’t expect that you could do it so well on your own.”

Judging from Qiao Mianmian’s proficiency in makeup, she wasn’t much worse than a professional makeup artist.

Although it was just a simple makeup, it was enough to show her foundation.

“Mm, I was a beauty blogger for some time, so I have some understanding of makeup. If the makeup isn’t too complicated, it’s fine.”

Qiao Mianmian said casually, but Nana’s eyes widened in shock. “Sister Mianmian, you’ve been a cosmetics blogger before?”

Qiao Mianmian thought for a while and nodded. “Mm, but that cosmetics account hasn’t been updated in a long time. I can’t even remember the password now.”
