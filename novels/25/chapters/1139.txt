Chapter 1140: Mo Yesi Is Unhappy

“Okay.”

Mo Yesi picked up his watch and stood up. “I’ll go down and wait for you now.”

“There’s no need for that. I’ll go up and look for you later. Go about your business, there’s no need...”

“I’m free now.” Mo Yesi walked out of the office and said in a domineering tone, “That’s it. I’ll wait for you downstairs. See you later.”

Mo Yesi hung up and left the office.

When he walked past the secretaries’ work area, his cold face and the low pressure around him scared the few female secretaries so much that they did not even dare to breathe.

It was only when he walked into the elevator and the doors closed that the female secretaries gathered together to discuss in low voices. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“President Mo seems to be in a bad mood today. Is it because of his girlfriend’s scandals?”

“Do you think the rumors are true? Did President Mo’s girlfriend really... have a child in high school?”

“Is her scandal with Young Master Gong true?”

“How is that possible? Young Master Gong and President Mo are good friends. A friend’s wife is not to be bullied. Even if Young Master Gong is really interested in President Mo’s girlfriend, he wouldn’t do anything to her. That’s not taking President Mo seriously.”

“But, there’s no smoke without fire. Why are there no scandals about Young Master Gong and her just based on rumors? Some women are really b*tches who like to walk on a few boats. Of course, I don’t think Miss Qiao is such a person. After all, with such an outstanding and perfect boyfriend like President Mo, it’s hard for her to have feelings for other men.”

“Do you think President Mo will fight with his girlfriend over those scandals?”

“I don’t think so. I heard that President Mo has already asked the public relations department to settle his girlfriend’s matter. If President Mo believes those scandals, it would be too late to break up. Would he still help her?”

...

Five minutes later.

Qiao Mianmian’s taxi stopped outside the Mo Corporation building on time.

The moment she got out of the car, she saw the man standing outside.

His charisma and looks were top-notch. Even if Qiao Mianmian wasn’t his wife, she would have seen such an outstanding man at first glance.

Moreover, Mo Yesi was her husband.

When employees walked past him, they would stop and greet him respectfully.

In the past, Mo Yesi wasn’t a kind and amiable boss.

But when the employees greeted him, he would always nod in return.

But today, he had a cold expression on his face the entire time. When his employees greeted him, he did not react at all.

It was the hottest afternoon of summer.

The blazing sun outside was so hot that the ground was steaming.

But even though they were more than ten meters apart, Qiao Mianmian could feel the coldness emanating from him.

Mo Yesi was unhappy.

Qiao Mianmian could tell that he was in a bad mood.

Even if he looked the same as usual, apart from her, he had always been indifferent in front of others.

He looked very indifferent now.

His expression was calm and expressionless.

He looked no different from usual.

But Qiao Mianmian could feel that he was angry, perhaps furious.

She did not dare to approach him.

She hesitated for a few seconds before walking toward him.

She had just taken a step when the man seemed to have sensed something and looked in her direction.
