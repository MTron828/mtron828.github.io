Chapter 1815: It’s Like He’s a Ghost

“Choose the team leader first. I’ll give you five minutes to discuss.”

The ten of them were divided into two groups.

Shen Fei was unanimously elected as the leader of her team.

In the other group, Qiao Mianmian discussed with the four boys for a while before they decided to elect her as the team leader.

“I’ll be the team leader?” Qiao Mianmian looked at the guys around her. “You guys should choose another one. I’m not suitable.”

“What’s not suitable? We think you’re suitable, so you’re suitable. You’re the only girl in our group, so you’re the most suitable as the group leader.”

“That’s right, Qiao Mianmian. Be the team leader. We four handsome guys are at your beck and call, don’t you like it?”

“But...”

“No buts, you just have to do it.” Zhan Bo didn’t give her a chance to reject and said directly to Zhao Yuan, “Brother Zhao, we’ve chosen her. Our team has chosen Qiao Mianmian as the team leader.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

Could she reject it?

“Alright, then the two group leaders have been chosen.” Zhao Yuan announced. “Team A is Shen Fei, and Team B is Qiao Mianmian. Has everyone been confirmed? If so, let’s begin.”

Upon hearing that Zhan Bo and the rest had chosen Qiao Mianmian as the team leader, Qiao Anxin and Song Ke were a little indignant.

Qiao Mianmian was just a newbie, what right did she have to be the team leader?

Zhan Bo and the rest were actually willing to be ordered around by a newbie?

These men seemed possessed.

All of them seemed to be charmed by Qiao Mianmian.

“Shameless vixen.” Qiao Anxin cursed in her heart, but when her gaze landed on Qiao Mianmian’s fair and exquisite face, her eyes revealed jealousy.

She had been like this since young.

Because of that face, Qiao Mianmian was easily liked by others. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Even men like Zhan Bo, who were used to seeing beauties in the entertainment industry, were special to her.

So it was really important to have a good-looking face.

If she could have Qiao Mianmian’s beauty, would she get the same treatment?

When this thought popped up in Qiao Anxin’s mind, the other thought in her mind became even more firm.

...

Half an hour later.

Qiao Mianmian and the rest were brought to the place with the lotus roots. The workers gave them gloves and rain boots and asked the relevant personnel to teach them how to dig the lotus roots out of the mud.

After a few rounds of practice, the workers left them to work.

“What, we’re going to dig lotus roots in this mud?” Song Ke’s expression changed again and again. She clenched her clothes tightly, and her eyes were full of disdain. “This is too dirty, even my clothes are dirty. Can we not do this?”

Qiao Anxin despised it too, but she was a little smarter than Song Ke. She knew that she was being filmed, so she didn’t show it.

She knew what kind of artistes the audience liked.

The audience liked those down-to-earth and tough. Anyway, the audience definitely wouldn’t like someone like Song Ke.

Qiao Anxin wasn’t as stupid as Song Ke. She knew what the audience didn’t like, but she still did it.

She looked at the camera facing them and said in disgust, “Don’t we still have rain boots and gloves? If we pay more attention, it won’t get dirty, right? I think we should work quickly and try to dig more lotus roots to sell in two hours.”
