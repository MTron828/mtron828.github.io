Chapter 2235: Not Really Care About Her

Mo Yunchen walked over with his arm around Madam Mo. “It’s been a long time since our house has been so lively. We can have a good gathering today. Your mom even bought some baby clothes for her grandchild.”

Mo Yunchen looked at Jiang Luoli and asked with concern, “Xiao Luo, Shixiu said that he took you for a prenatal checkup a few days ago. Is everything normal?”

Jiang Luoli smiled and nodded. “Mm, everything is normal. Thank you, Dad.”

She didn’t like Madam Mo.

But she had nothing against her father-in-law.

In fact, Jiang Luoli had a good impression of Mo Yunchen.

Just like Old Madam, Mo Yunchen was willing to accept her from the bottom of his heart. They didn’t despise her background, nor did they persuade her to break up with Mo Shixiu.

“That’s good. Shixiu, Xiao Luo is carrying the Mo family’s flesh and blood now. You have to take good care of her.”

“I will.” Mo Shixiu nodded.

“That’s right, Shixiu. You have to take good care of Luoli.” Madam Mo also showed concern and said gently, “She’s not only carrying your child, but also our Mo family’s bloodline.” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“Mom, Luoli is my wife. She’s carrying my child. I’ll naturally take good care of her.”

Jiang Luoli could feel that Madam Mo didn’t really care about her.

Her concern was different from Old Madam’s.

Moreover, Madam Mo still looked at her with disgust.

Even if she deliberately hid it, it was impossible to completely hide one’s disgust towards another person.

Madam Mo didn’t like her.

Whether it was in the past or now.

Jiang Luoli could only interpret Madam Mo’s concern as her concern for the Mo family’s bloodline.

After all, the child she was carrying belonged to the Mo bloodline.

Hence, even if Madam Mo didn’t like her, she still had to be concerned about her baby.

At this moment, another housemaid came to report. “Old Madam, Young Master Mo Chen is here.”

Mo Chen was Qiao Chen.

The current Qiao Chen was already called Mo Chen.

Madam Mo was already in a bad mood when she saw Qiao Mianmian and Jiang Luoli.

When she heard that Qiao Chen was here, she felt even more stifled.

She didn’t like Qiao Mianmian and naturally didn’t like Qiao Chen.

Especially since he was an illegitimate child.

Madam Mo didn’t even care about the Mo family’s bloodline.

She had a good relationship with Second Madam, so she must be venting her anger on her.

Soon, the young man’s slender figure entered her sight.

The housemaids looked at him the moment he entered.

Qiao Chen and Mo Shixiu shared different types.

Qiao Chen was young, having just turned 18.

Compared to his two older cousins, he was more popular with girls.

He looked like a handsome young man who had just walked out of a comic. His face was so beautiful that it felt unreal.

This was the type of boy that every girl would fall for in their youth.

Qiao Chen’s looks were more like his mother’s, so his facial features were especially delicate, but it only made him look handsome and not feminine.
