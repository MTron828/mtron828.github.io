“Damn, such a good scene. I originally thought that no matter how much I liked Brother Han, I wouldn’t want to watch a show between him and a vase. Now that I’ve seen this scene, I actually feel that Qiao Mianmian’s acting is pretty good?! I actually started looking forward to this drama.”

“Can I say that I’m like that too? I swore that I wouldn’t watch this show. I just went to take a look and found that it wasn’t as bad as I thought. It’s even better than I imagined. This scene looks pretty exciting. If the main film is of such quality, I feel like I can watch it.”

“I’m not exaggerating. Objectively speaking, this clip is really good. Qiao Mianmian’s acting is much better than I imagined. I really can’t tell that she’s a newbie without any works. She seems to have better acting skills than many capable actors.”

“I can say that I came in for Brother Han at first, but now I’m attracted by Qiao Mianmian’s acting. Her crying scene is too good, it’s so infectious. I actually cried watching such a short clip.”
