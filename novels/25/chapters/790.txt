Chapter 791: Can I Take a Picture With You?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

And she was sizing her up very carefully.

“I am.” Qiao Mianmian felt a little uncomfortable being stared at by the girl. She coughed and asked, “May I know who you are? Do we know each other?”

“Wow, you’re really Qiao Mianmian.”

The girl grabbed her hand and said happily, “I’m your fan, I really like you. Wow, I didn’t expect to meet you in person. I’m so happy!

“Sister Mianmian, I really like you a lot. Can I take a picture with you? I have a lot of classmates who like you too. I’ll send a picture of us to make them envious.”

The joy on her face was evident.

She looked really happy.

Qiao Mianmian was stunned.

She looked at the young girl in front of her.

Was this her fan?

She already had millions of followers on Weibo, so it wasn’t strange to have fans.

But this was the first time she met real fans in real life.

This was the first time she felt that she had fans.

“Can’t I?” Seeing that she hadn’t said anything, the girl’s happy face fell, and a trace of disappointment appeared in her eyes.

But she still sensibly let go of her hand. She bit her lip and said softly, “Alright, then. I’m disturbing you. If we can’t take a picture together, can you give me your autograph?”

Qiao Mianmian finally snapped out of her daze.

Seeing how disappointed the girl looked, she immediately grabbed her hand and smiled sweetly at her. “You want a picture? Of course.” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Really?” The girl widened her eyes in surprise.

“Mm.” Qiao Mianmian took the cell phone from her and flipped to the camera. She turned it on and aimed it at the two of them. “I’ll take the cell phone. Stand behind me. This way, your face will look smaller when you take the picture.”

This was the first time Qiao Mianmian met a real-life fan.

And she was a really cute little girl.

She did everything she could for this fan. Not only did she take a lot of selfies, she even gave the girl a big hug.

After separating from the girl, Qiao Mianmian couldn’t help but post on Weibo.

Qiao Mianmian: [I suddenly feel that I have fans too. Happy (V)]

She attached a photo of the airport.

Initially, she wanted to send a selfie of her and that fan, but she didn’t know if the girl would mind exposing it, so she gave up.

After two scandals, Qiao Mianmian’s fan base had skyrocketed. She now had over 1.2 million followers.

And these 1.2 million fans were all true fans.

A minute after she posted it, there were over a hundred comments.

She clicked on it.

Then, she realized that almost all of her fans were commenting on how she didn’t do a bad selfie.

Many of Qiao Mianmian’s fans were true fans, and they were always asking for her selfies.

She didn’t like to take selfies. Besides needing her to send photos at work, she rarely took them herself.

She scrolled through Weibo for a while and suddenly saw a picture posted by a fan.

It was the selfie the fan took with her.

Meimei: [(Picture) Sister Mianmian, tell me quickly, is the person in this photo you? Someone said she bumped into you at Yuncheng City Airport, is that true?]
