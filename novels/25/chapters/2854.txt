Chapter 2855: He Will Definitely Get a Divorce

The Mo Corporation’s public relations department was quick and efficient.

In less than an hour, all the negative topics about Qiao Mianmian were deleted. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Some of the reposted accounts and VIPs received the company’s instructions and quickly deleted all the scandals about Qiao Mianmian.

They couldn’t afford to offend the Mo Corporation.

A few companies were warned because of Qiao Mianmian’s scandal.

If it wasn’t for the scandal about Young Madam Mo, they wouldn’t have taken the warning seriously.

After all, it was just a verbal warning.

Otherwise, even if they went to court, they would just have to pay a symbolic sum.

It wasn’t a big loss to them.

But the Mo Corporation was different.

No one dared to ignore such a terrifying existence that could bankrupt other companies.

There was once someone who stubbornly believed otherwise.

But he ended up dead.

A complete death.

At that moment, the topics about Qiao Mianmian’s scandal disappeared from Weibo as if they had never existed.

But words were scary.

Many netizens who saw the trending searches felt that this was a sign of Qiao Mianmian’s guilt, and they were even more convinced that she and Gong Zeli were indeed together.

“Did you guys notice that the scandal between Qiao Mianmian and Gong Zeli has been completely deleted? I just searched for the related topics regarding ‘Qiao Mianmian and Gong Zeli’, but I couldn’t find anything. The power of money is indeed great. Madam President is awesome.”

“She’s obviously using the Mo Corporation’s public relations team. Her management company isn’t so powerful. Mo Yesi has already been made a cuckold, and he still wants the Mo Corporation’s public relations to help his wife deal with the scandal? Tsk tsk. What kind of drug did she use? Could it be that he was bewitched by Qiao Mianmian? Otherwise, I really can’t understand his actions.”

“Mo Yesi isn’t just Qiao Mianmian’s husband, he’s also the Chairman of the Mo Corporation. I don’t think he’s bewitched by Qiao Mianmian. As the Chairman of the Mo Corporation, his every move has an impact on the corporation, and his marriage problem has an even bigger impact. He got the public relations department to settle this scandal because he doesn’t want the Mo Corporation to be affected.”

“I also think that Mo Yesi is just thinking for the company. Even ordinary men can’t accept their wife cheating on them, let alone a man like him. He should be holding it in for the Mo Corporation now, and he won’t divorce Qiao Mianmian immediately. But when this is over, he’ll definitely divorce her.”

“Qiao Mianmian still hasn’t explained it to the netizens. She used to post on Weibo to clarify her scandals, but this time, she didn’t. Everyone should understand what this means.”

“Pfft, what an adulterous couple. They’re too shameless. Do they think that by removing the trending topics everyone won’t know about their scandals? Nothing ever gets really deleted from the internet. It’s too naive to think of deleting the trending topics to shut everyone up.”

“Sisters, if they remove the trending topics on Weibo, we’ll post it elsewhere! We can’t let this immoral couple off so easily.. Especially a fickle woman like Qiao Mianmian, we have to let more people know her true colors!”
