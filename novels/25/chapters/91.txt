Chapter 92: Extremely Jealous

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Hi, mister. I’m Qiao Mianmian’s sister. May I ask, do you know my sister?” Qiao Anxin refused to give up and continued knocking the window.

A few seconds later, the car window slowly rolled down.

When she saw the man sitting in the car, Qiao Anxin felt her breathing stop. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Her heart also skipped a beat.

The car was parked in the shade and the window was only half-opened, but this did not prevent her from looking at the man in the car.

She could only see his side-view, but his facial features were very striking. Every single line on his face seemed to be carved out.

His nose was very tall and straight and his lips were thin and sexy. Overall, he looked more handsome than she had imagined.

Not only was he not old, but he was also very young and looked to be only around 25.

Qiao Anxin was in the entertainment industry and there was no shortage of good-looking men around her. Furthermore, Su Ze was also one of the most handsome ones. She honestly thought that she had a certain immunity to good-looking men.

However, the man in the car suddenly made her heart race.

Su Ze’s handsomeness was not even worth mentioning in front of him.

This man was smotheringly handsome.

She was afraid that any woman that saw him would not be able to resist his charm.

Initially, she thought that no matter how rich Qiao Mianmian’s man was, he was probably old and ugly and could not compare to Su Ze.

But...

Looking at the handsome and rich man in the car, Qiao Anxin was green with envy.

She wanted to see what a joke Qiao Mianmian was after she and Su Ze broke up.

However, who would have thought that b*tch found someone even more handsome and wealthy!

If this man was richer and more powerful than Su Ze, she would be completely inferior to Qiao Mianmian!

Jealously distorted her facial expression. She bit her lip tightly, endured the discomfort in her heart, and squeezed out a sweet smile. “Mister, I saw you at the rotating restaurant previously sitting with my sister. That’s why I wanted to say hello when I saw you.”

“Mister, I didn’t recognize the wrong person, right? Do you know my sister?”

Inside the car.

Mo Yesi raised his head and looked at her indifferently. “You are Mianmian’s sister?”

The man’s neutral expression was even more beautiful and cool and it had a strong visual impact on Qiao Anxin.

She widened her eyes in surprise and stared at him.

She always felt that Su Ze was outstanding enough.

She always felt proud of being able to seduce such an excellent man like Su Ze.

Su Ze was young, handsome, and famous. He was also gentle and caring. He was truly a man that was hard to come by.

After knowing that Su Ze and her were dating, her female friends were all jealous of her.

They all said that she was blessed, and after she married into the Su family, she would be able to lead a lavish lifestyle.

As a result, she always had a strong sense of superiority.

Originally, she thought that she was a winner in life, but at this time, she only felt jealousy.

She was so crazily jealous that she became resentful and clenched her fists tightly. In a charming voice, she said, “Yes, mister. I don’t know if...”

Before she could finish, Mo Yesi interrupted her coldly. “Mianmian has never told me that she has a sister.”

The smile on Qiao Anxin’s lips froze.

She did not expect that b*tch Qiao Mianmian to be so scheming.
