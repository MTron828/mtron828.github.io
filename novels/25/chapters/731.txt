Chapter 733: Jealous

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

The moment she hugged him, she felt his body stiffen. Then, he tightened his arms around her waist and hugged her even tighter.

“Cough, cough, cough.”

He was so strong that Qiao Mianmian could barely breathe.

She reached out and pushed him. “Mo Yesi, don’t use so much force. I can’t vent my anger anymore.”

It wasn’t as if they hadn’t seen each other for a long time.

It wasn’t a parting of life and death.

They had just parted this morning.

In less than a day, he acted as if they hadn’t seen each other in a long time.

Nana blushed when she saw the two of them hugging. She sneaked past them and returned to her room.

Mo Yesi loosened his grip a little, but he still refused to let go of her. His eyes were fixated on her face as if he wanted to carve her image into his mind. “You haven’t answered me, why are you ignoring me?” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“You came all the way here just to ask me this?”

Qiao Mianmian knew about his call with Bai Yusheng.

She knew that he was anxious.

But she didn’t expect him to fly over so quickly.

He’d just flown back in the morning, and now he flew back.

Wasn’t it tiring to fly twice in a day?

But she was still happy to see him.

She could also deeply feel that when Mo Yesi cared for someone, he would love that person wholeheartedly.

Any other man wouldn’t be able to do this.

He knew from Bai Yusheng that she was alright, but he still rushed over.

When she was with Su Ze, he was nice to her too.

But she dared to say that if she hadn’t broken up with him, he wouldn’t be able to do this.

It was only after meeting Mo Yesi that she realized the true meaning of “love”.

He used his actions to show her what it was like to really love someone.

“Of course not.” Mo Yesi couldn’t bear to let her go. He picked her up horizontally and carried her a few steps forward. He then pointed to the open room. “Baby, is that your room?”

After Qiao Mianmian nodded, he carried her in.

He carried Qiao Mianmian to the bed and placed her on it.

“Mo Yesi, you...” Qiao Mianmian was about to get up from the bed when the man reached out and pulled her into his arms.

The man pinched her chin with his slender fingers and stroked it gently. After a while, he said in a low voice, “Baby, if I hadn’t come, I’m afraid you’d have been kidnapped.

“It wasn’t easy for me to get a wife. If she was taken away, where else can I find another one that suits me so well?”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless and amused.

“Your wife is right here, who can take her away?”

Thinking about how he rejected her call and didn’t even send her a comforting message, she was so angry that she pushed him away. “Even if she left, she was driven away by you. Hmph!”

Hmph, jealous.

There was no man more jealous than him.

Mo Yesi knew that she was angry with him.

He was here to coax his wife.
