Chapter 1537: He Fell for Someone Else

It didn’t matter what others said about her as long as she could make the person she liked like her too.

Everything was worth it.

But...

Why didn’t the person who made her persevere tell her that persevering might not end well?

When the other party really didn’t like you, it didn’t matter how long you lasted.

Just like how she hadn’t been able to move him or make Qiao Chen like her even after chasing him for three years.

But Lin Xiaoya could easily gain his favor.

She finally understood that feelings couldn’t be forced.

Hence, she didn’t want to force it.

She wanted to give up on this relationship and slowly forget him.

If she continued to stay in the same school as him, she didn’t know when she could let go.

She didn’t want to hear about him and Lin Xiaoya anymore.

She would be sad and heartbroken.

Only by leaving this place could her life start anew.

“Of course.” Shen Xin saw that Qiao Chen didn’t say anything and couldn’t help but feel sad again. Her heart was obviously in pain, but she forced a smile and said casually, “If you don’t think it’s necessary, just pretend I didn’t say anything.”

Qiao Chen pursed his lips and kept quiet.

The moment he heard that Shen Xin wanted to transfer schools, an indescribable feeling surged in his heart.

He didn’t know what it was.

But at that moment, he panicked.

But he didn’t show it.

He looked at Shen Xin and asked emotionlessly, “Why?”

“What?”

“Why did you suddenly want to transfer schools? I’ve said it before, I’ve never hated you. You can continue to stay in school, I have no intention of asking you to leave.”

“I know.” Shen Xin lowered her eyes. “You’re not forcing me to leave, I want to go somewhere else.”

Qiao Chen clenched his fists and his expression changed. “You’re really transferring schools? You’ve already found one?”

“Mm.” Shen Xin looked down and didn’t see his expression. “I’ve already found one. I probably won’t come back often in the future. But Yuncheng City is so big, even if I come back, we probably won’t be able to see each other.

“Qiao Chen, I’ve troubled you for the past few years. I’m really sorry.

“Now that you have a girl you like, I’m... very happy for you. Lin Xiaoya is pretty and comes from a good family. She seems to like you too. You two are really compatible.”

With every word, Shen Xin felt as if something was cutting her heart.

She wasn’t happy at all.

She was so upset.

She really liked him.

She would feel uncomfortable every time he spoke to a girl.

Moreover, he liked another girl.

She felt that Lin Xiaoya wasn’t worthy of him at all. No girl in this world was worthy of him.

Qiao Chen frowned and opened his mouth to say that he didn’t like Lin Xiaoya. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

He almost said it, but he chose to remain silent.

Qiao Chen agreed with her.

She knew that he definitely had a good impression of Lin Xiaoya, but she admitted that at this moment, she still felt like her heart was being stabbed.

Qiao Chen really liked someone else.

She’d pursued him for three years, but he was still unmoved.

She thought that he wouldn’t like her or anyone else.
