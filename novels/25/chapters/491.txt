Chapter 492: Why would she take note

Qiao Mianmian: [(fold arms emoji) No pictures, I’ve left.]

Jiang Luoli: [(hammer emoji) I’ll hammer you down.]

Qiao Mianmian: [I’ll be heading to the set in a few days. I’ll capture one for you then? Or you could come to look for me. I’m telling you, he really looks way better in person than on camera. I can finally understand how he became a megastar. He really lives on his looks.]

Jiang Luoli: [That handsome? Hehe. More handsome than Prince Charming? Anyway, Prince Charming can’t see our conversation, so just be honest here.]

Qiao Mianmian was taken aback.

Was Tu Yilei or Mo Yesi more handsome?

That was tough.

Both of them weren’t of the same type.

Tu Yilei was more of a sunshine boy, while Mo Yesi had a mature elite businessman look.

She thought for a while and then replied seriously: [They’re both handsome, but they’re not of the same type. I can’t compare them.]

Jiang Luoli: [Then, which type do you prefer? No lying.]

Qiao Mianmian deliberated over it and then replied: [I still prefer Mo Yesi’s type.]

It wasn’t just because he was her husband. Personally, she felt that Mo Yesi’s type was more comfortable to look at for a long time.

Except that he appeared a little too cold.

Then again, he was cold towards others, so it wasn’t an issue for Qiao Mianmian.

Jiang Luoli: [Hehehe, I knew you’d say that. But if I were to choose, I’d say Tu Yilei’s type is more suitable to date. But if you’re talking about getting married and settling down, then Prince Charming is more suitable.]

Jiang Luoli: [Oh, by the way, you and Prince Charming... are alright now?]

Qiao Mianmian read Jiang Luoli’s message and couldn’t help but think about that morning.

She wasn’t sure if she was thinking too much.

But she felt like Mo Yesi had other reasons for not having breakfast with her that day. It wasn’t just because he was busy with work.

He had always made time for breakfast, no matter how busy he was.

Moreover, he didn’t come down even when she left.

It was as if he was avoiding her on purpose.

Could it be because of that shortened experience? That’s why he didn’t want to face her?

On that thought, Qiao Mianmian asked: [Luo Luo, is the duration of that thing very important to men?]

Jiang Luoli: [?? What thing?]

Qiao Mianmian blushed as she replied: [That thing.]

Jiang Luoli: [Oh, you mean love-making? Of course, it’s very important. It’s not just important to men, though. It’s important to women too.] Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Qiao Mianmian then asked: [If it’s too short, would men suffer a huge blow?]

Jiang Luoli: [Baby, don’t you tell me that Prince Charming’s act was very short!!!]

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

Jiang Luoli: [Surely not... Prince Charming seems to be the strong and fit type who can last really long. So, what was it, exactly? One minute, or two? Or three? ... Five minutes?]

Qiao Mianmian felt her cheeks burn.

Why would she take notes?

She just felt like... it wasn’t very long.

Jiang Luoli then sent another message: [Baby, you didn’t embarrass Prince Charming, right? Or say anything to hurt his dignity? You really shouldn’t do that, it’ll hurt him deeply.]

Qiao Mianmian: [... I didn’t.]
