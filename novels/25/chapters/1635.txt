Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Jiang Luoli thought for a while and said, “Brother Zewen, can I use your cell phone?”

She didn’t want to tell Mo Shixiu about some things.

She didn’t want to affect Mo Shixiu’s relationship with his mother.

But now, she felt that she had nothing to worry about.

She was afraid of being bullied.

“Of course.” Xie Zewen immediately took out his cell phone and handed it to her.

“Thank you.”

Jiang Luoli took it and called Mo Shixiu.

But his cell phone was turned off.

Jiang Luoli frowned and called Assistant Xu, but his cell phone was also turned off.

She thought that they might be having an important meeting or on the plane.

Mo Shixiu often flew overseas. It was normal for him to be on a plane.

She then called Mo Shixiu’s house.

Sister Lin’s voice came through.

“Sister Lin,” Jiang Luoli greeted.

Sister Lin was stunned for a while before saying happily, “Miss Jiang?”

“Mm, it’s me.” Jiang Luoli asked, “Sister Lin, did Mo Shixiu go overseas for a business trip? I called him and Assistant Xu just now, but it didn’t go through. It seems his phone is switched off.”

“Ah, Miss Jiang, you finally turned on your phone.” Sister Lin sounded happy. “Mister didn’t go on a business trip. He went to look for you. Assistant Xu is with him. Previously, Mister called you, but your phone was switched off. Mister was very worried about you.

“He was afraid that something happened to you at home and couldn’t contact you, so he went to look for you.

“Judging from the time, Mister should be getting off the plane soon. Call him later, it’ll definitely get through.”

Jiang Luoli was shocked. “He came to my hometown to look for me?”

“Mm.

“Miss Jiang, it’s good that you’re fine. Mister treats you so well. I’ve never seen him care so much about anyone. He put down a lot of things to look for you. In Mister’s heart, nothing is more important than his work.

“But now, Miss Jiang is more important to Mister than his work.”

After hanging up, Jiang Luoli was still in disbelief.

Mo Shixiu actually came to look for her.

He was worried about her because she had turned off her cell phone.

Not to mention Sister Lin, even she hadn’t expected Mo Shixiu to do this for her.

Beside him.

Xie Zewen looked at Jiang Luoli in disbelief.

He was shocked. “Luoli, what’s the relationship between Mo Shixiu and the Minister of Security? Their names seem to be the same.”

It was normal that not many people knew about Mo Yesi.

But Mo Shixiu often appeared in public, so many people knew about him.

Jiang Luoli turned around and met his gaze.

She hesitated for a while before deciding to tell the truth. “He’s the Minister of Security, Mo Shixiu.”

Xie Zewen was shocked again. “You know him?”

“Mm, I do.”

“What... is your relationship with him?” Xie Zewen had a guess, but he didn’t want to believe it.

He didn’t think it was possible.

Jiang Luoli was just an ordinary student.

But from her conversation with the person on the phone, she even knew Mo Shixiu’s number. Their relationship seemed extraordinary.
