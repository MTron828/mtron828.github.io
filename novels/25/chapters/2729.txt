Qiao Mianmian immediately took it. Although Lu Rao had already told her the results, she still read it carefully.

After looking at hers, she looked at Mo Yesi’s too.

Then, she was completely at ease.

Holding the two reports, she turned around and happily threw herself into Mo Yesi’s arms. “Mo Yesi, that’s great. We’re fine.”

Mo Yesi held the little woman firmly in his arms. “There shouldn’t be any problem. I already said that you’re too free at home, that’s why you’re letting your thoughts run wild.

“The results are good, too. Can you rest assured now?”

“Mm, don’t worry!” Qiao Mianmian smiled. “I won’t think about it anymore.”

“Pregnancy can’t be rushed.” Lu Rao looked at the couple hugging each other and laughed. “As long as your bodies are fine, you’ll have a baby sooner or later. I suggest you relax now and not think about this all the time. It’s best if you pretend it never happened. If you keep thinking about it, you’ll feel more pressure.

“Things won’t go according to plan, then. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Sister-in-law is still young. Ah Si, you’re also very young. You don’t have to be in a hurry to have a child at this age. Especially Ah Si. You really don’t have to be too anxious. Life as a nanny isn’t as easy as you think. You’re hoping for a child now, and you might complain to us in the future.”

But Mo Yesi wasn’t in a rush to be a father.

Lu Rao couldn’t understand why Mo Yesi was in such a hurry to have a child.

Moreover, he remembered Mo Yesi saying that children were the most troublesome and detestable creatures in the world.

His actions now were really a slap in the face.

…

They left the hospital.

Qiao Mianmian’s mood changed. She now looked relaxed and happy.

On the other hand, Mo Yesi seemed to have something on his mind.

“Mo Yesi, what’s wrong?” Qiao Mianmian could tell that he wasn’t in a good mood and asked with concern. “Why are you in a bad mood when we’re fine? Don’t tell me… the results are wrong?”

“Don’t overthink it. How could the results not be accurate?” Mo Yesi rubbed her head. “I’m just thinking, am I really too anxious? Mianmian, have I given you too much pressure recently?”

That was why she was overthinking.

Before Qiao Mianmian could reply, he thought for a while and continued, “I thought about it seriously just now. What Lu Rao said isn’t without reason. Since our bodies are fine, maybe I was too anxious and gave us too much pressure, so you couldn’t get pregnant.

“If you feel bored staying at home, you should continue working.” Mo Yesi said his decision after serious consideration. “As long as you don’t have to stay overseas for a long time, you can take on domestic work if you want.”

“Mo Yesi, you…” Qiao Mianmian looked up at him in shock..
