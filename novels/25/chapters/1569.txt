Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Of course, Qiao Mianmian didn’t have any props for her performance.

So, the sword she picked up from the ground was air.

This was also a test of acting skills.

If she didn’t perform well, it would be awkward.

But Qiao Mianmian’s performance was very natural. Even though she had nothing in her hand, it felt like she was holding a sword.

“Father, Mother, Brother Shangguan, Yan’er doesn’t want to be alone in this world. Forgive Yan’er for being weak. Yan’er misses you. Yan’er will look for you now. Father, Mother, Brother Shangguan, Yan’er is here.”

The invisible sword stabbed into her heart.

At that moment, Qiao Mianmian’s face turned pale.

It was as if a sword had stabbed into her heart.

She maintained the posture of sticking her sword in and moved her body little by little. Although her face was extremely pale, a blissful and satisfied smile appeared at the corner of her lips. “Father, Mother, Big Brother Shangguan, very soon... Yan’er will be able to meet you guys soon.

“Soon... soon...”

At the end, when Qiao Mianmian turned her head to the side and closed her eyes, the performance was over.

The hall was quiet.

No one spoke.

In this industry, those who were too beautiful would have inferior acting skills.

Because she had an outstanding appearance, it was easier to get something.

In that case, actors wouldn’t work too hard and wouldn’t take their careers seriously.

Qiao Mianmian’s performance surprised the director.

Especially the last part.

Without makeup, her face was as pale as if she’d lost too much blood.

Qiao Mianmian finally opened her eyes and slowly got up.

She looked up at the director, trying to see if he was satisfied with her performance.

But the director’s expression didn’t change.

Qiao Mianmian couldn’t tell if he was satisfied or not.

“Go back and wait for the notice.” The director didn’t say anything else.

Qiao Mianmian’s heart skipped a beat.

Even though she didn’t have much hope from the start, she was still a little disappointed and upset.

But she did her best.

She just hoped that Qin Han wouldn’t be disappointed in her.

Qiao Mianmian was very satisfied with her performance.

“Alright, Director. Thank you for giving me this opportunity.” Qiao Mianmian was a little upset, but she quickly figured it out.

She didn’t think it was a big deal that she didn’t pass the audition.

The competition this time was huge, and there were many capable actors.

It was a surprise that she got to audition.

It was normal that she wasn’t chosen.

After thinking it through, Qiao Mianmian relaxed
