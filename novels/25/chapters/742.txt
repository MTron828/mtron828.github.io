Chapter 743: This Man Was Too Much

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“... Mo Yesi, can you not get jealous.”

Qiao Mianmian rubbed her forehead and felt a headache coming on. “The woman that Brother Bai likes isn’t like me. He doesn’t have any romantic feelings for me. He really treats me like a sister. I feel like he’s a big brother too. Our relationship is very pure.

“Don’t keep thinking about other men having ill intentions towards me.”

Qiao Mianmian trusted her instincts.

She could feel that Bai Yusheng really didn’t have any romantic feelings for her.

Only this jealous lover of hers would think that she was charming and loved by everyone.

But she wasn’t rich, how could everyone like her?

“Sister, brother?” Mo Yesi sneered. “You don’t have feelings for him, but he has feelings for you? Baby, I’ve said before that I’m a man. Only a man can understand a man’s thoughts.

“What a good Bai Yusheng, how dare he covet my woman.”

Mo Yesi was furious. He picked up his cell phone and called Bai Yusheng. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

After a few rings, the call was picked up. A lazy and nonchalant voice was heard. “Chairman Mo, what’s wrong again? You’re calling me so late at night. Could it be that Mianmian doesn’t want you to come in, and you can’t find a place to stay tonight, so you want me to take you in for a night?”

Mo Yesi couldn’t suppress his anger when he heard him call her “Mianmian”.

He narrowed his eyes, his eyes burning with fury. He bit his lip and said, “Bai Yusheng, do you want to die?”

When Qiao Mianmian found out that he was calling Bai Yusheng, she immediately got out of bed.

She grabbed his cell phone angrily. “Mo Yesi, what are you doing, are you crazy?”

Mo Yesi’s expression turned even uglier now. He evaded her and said to Bai Yusheng, “I f** king handed her over to you because I wanted you to protect her.

“I gave my woman to you because I trusted you.

“But in the end, you actually had such dirty thoughts towards her? Do you believe that I won’t let you stay in the entertainment industry?”

Qiao Mianmian almost fainted from anger.

She knew that Mo Yesi was a jealous lover.

She knew that he was petty in his relationship, so much so that he would get jealous all the time.

But he had never done anything so irrational before.

She didn’t expect that just because she addressed Bai Yusheng as “Brother Bai,” he would be so sure that Bai Yusheng was up to no good and even called him for a scolding.

Did he consider her side?

When he got angry, he didn’t care about anything else. He only cared about whether he felt comfortable venting.

He wasn’t going to bother about the consequences of his actions.

She suddenly felt aggrieved and wanted to cry.

This man was too much.

His possessiveness towards her had reached a ridiculous level.

She couldn’t build a good relationship with any man. Once she did, she’d be seen as a bad person in his eyes.

He was probably trying to make all the opposite sex in the industry afraid of her and stay away from her.
