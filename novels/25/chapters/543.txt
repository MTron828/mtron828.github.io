Chapter 544: To Be Hospitable to Miss Shen on His Behalf

Seeing her enter the elevator, one of the receptionists said, “I bet Chairman Mo will help his girlfriend. Didn’t you see, Miss Shen took the regular elevator up just now. Meanwhile, Chairman Mo got Personal Assistant Wei to come down to receive her personally and even allowed her to take his personal elevator up. She’s already won.”

...

The 37th level.

The elevator doors opened. Wei Zheng watched as Qiao Mianmian walked out and seemed to want to say something.

“Personal Assistant Wei, do you have something to say to me?” Qiao Mianmian looked at his expression and stopped in her tracks.

“Uh, Young Madam...”

Wei Zheng glanced at Mo Yesi’s office and hesitated for a moment. He said it, anyway. “Miss Shen just came, and she’s now... in Chairman Mo’s office.”

Qiao Mianmian would see it for herself if he didn’t tell her now.

It was better to just let her prepare for it first. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Otherwise, she might get a shock when she saw Shen Rou later.

“You said Shen Rou’s here?” Qiao Mianmian suddenly recalled the familiar figure she saw downstairs.

She hadn’t realized who it was then, but she did now.

It was none other than Shen Rou.

“Mm.” Wei Zheng looked at her expression cautiously and heaved a sigh of relief when he saw that she didn’t seem to mind. “Miss Shen said that she had a misunderstanding with Chairman Mo, so she’s here to talk to him about it.

“I told her that Chairman Mo is very busy today and probably won’t have the time, but she insisted on waiting...”

Wei Zheng seemed to be caught in a fix. “She’s Chairman Mo’s friend, and she used to come often to look for him too. Chairman Mo didn’t say anything about it, so...”

So, he didn’t think it was right to stop her from entering.

If it was some stranger, he would surely stop them.

But Shen Rou was different.

Unless Chairman Mo personally instructed him to stop her, he wasn’t in any position to do that.

“I understand.” Qiao Mianmian turned around and glanced towards the Chairman’s office. She smiled and said, “Miss Shen and Yesi are old friends. Of course, she can come and look for him.”

“Then, Young Madam, you...”

Qiao Mianmian smiled even wider now, and her voice was calmer. “Since Yesi isn’t around, as the Young Madam, I’ve got to be hospitable to Miss Shen on his behalf.”

In the past, she didn’t really mind that Shen Rou had some interest in Mo Yesi.

She felt that it was normal.

After all, Mo Yesi was a very outstanding man.

It wasn’t surprising to fall for him, especially if he was so close by.

There was nothing wrong with having a crush on someone.

As long as that person maintained the distance and did not cause problems for the other party.

But things were different now.

She knew that Shen Rou wouldn’t silently have a crush on Mo Yesi.

Shen Rou treated her like an enemy.

She was full of indignance whenever she spoke to her.

There was no way she could ignore Shen Rou’s presence anymore.

Moreover...

When she first met Shen Rou, she hadn’t had feelings for Mo Yesi yet.

Naturally, she hadn’t minded finding out that another woman liked him.
