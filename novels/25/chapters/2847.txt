Chapter 2849: Alright, I’ll Wait for You

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Qiao Mianmian, you…”

“I can bully you a little more. Do you want to try?” Qiao Mianmian said casually.

Qiao Anxin glared at her.

“Qiao Mianmian, don’t go overboard! A rabbit will bite when it’s cornered. Do you really think I can’t do anything to you?”

“Of course you can’t do anything to me.” Qiao Mianmian still looked indifferent, obviously not taking her seriously at all. “The Gong Corporation has already terminated the contract with you, right? So, you’re just a newbie with no backing now. You can’t even protect yourself, and you still want to deal with me?

“And…” Qiao Mianmian smiled and said arrogantly, “…killing you is easier than killing an ant. Tell me, what do you want to fight me with?” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Qiao Mianmian, you’re too arrogant!”

Qiao Anxin looked at the others around her. She couldn’t believe that Qiao Mianmian would say such a thing to her without considering the other guests present.

They were also a little shocked.

Although everyone knew that Qiao Mianmian had a powerful background, she was being too high-profile.

Saying that she wanted to deal with another female guest in front of the other guests, wasn’t she afraid that her words would be spread?

Zhan Bo and Qin Han frowned.

Based on their understanding of Qiao Mianmian, she wasn’t such a high-profile and arrogant person.

But she was indeed being very rude to Jiang Xinyue.

At this moment, the security personnel walked over.

Qiao Mianmian glanced at Qiao Anxin and said to the security personnel, “Please take Miss Jiang away. She might have been agitated and her emotions are unstable now. I’m worried that she’ll pose a threat to my safety.”

The security personnel had just received the notice and were here to take Qiao Anxin away.

With that, they walked towards Qiao Anxin.

“Miss Jiang, please follow us,” one of the security personnel said to Qiao Anxin.

Qiao Anxin glared at Qiao Mianmian and gritted her teeth. “Qiao Mianmian, this isn’t over! Just you wait, I’ll settle our scores one by one!”

Qiao Mianmian looked at her as if she was listening to a joke. “Oh, is that so? Alright, I’ll wait for you.”

Qiao Anxin, I’d like to see how you’re going to deal with me.

It’s indeed time to settle our scores.

Qiao Mianmian had thought about it before. If Qiao Anxin just wanted to return to the entertainment industry and didn’t have any other motives, she wouldn’t stop her.

Actually, she didn’t have much hatred for Qiao Anxin.

The worst thing Qiao Anxin did was to snatch Su Ze from her.

Back then, Qiao Mianmian was indeed very angry and hated Qiao Anxin.

But later, she met Mo Yesi.

She had Mo Yesi’s love.

She didn’t hate Qiao Anxin anymore. She even felt that she should thank her.

If she hadn’t seduced Su Ze, Qiao Mianmian wouldn’t have known that Su Ze was a jerk deep down. She wouldn’t have had the chance to stop her losses in time, let alone meet Mo Yesi and marry him.

If Qiao Anxin hadn’t snatched Su Ze in time, she might have… married him in the end.
