Chapter 1100: Chen Chen This Child Looks Like Your Second Uncle

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

The old lady didn’t look like someone who was difficult to get along with.

His face was a little red. He opened his mouth and called her grandma very softly.

The old lady smiled in satisfaction and looked at him warmly for a while before saying in surprise, “Ah Si, did you realize that Chen Chen looks like your second uncle?

“Tsk tsk, they look exactly the same.”

Mo Yesi had long noticed this and nodded. “Mm, Chen Chen and Second Uncle do look alike.”

“How is it just a little similar?” The more the Old Madam looked at him, the more surprised she became. She let out a surprised sigh again. “He really looks like your second uncle. If someone told me that he’s your second uncle’s son, I would believe it.”

The Second Old Master of the Mo Family was Old Madam’s second son.

Old Madam knew very well what he looked like when he was young.

This little boy called Qiao Chen looked exactly like her second son when he was young.

The only difference was that he looked thinner and haggard.

If he were five or ten kilograms fuller, it would be exactly the same.

Many people looked similar.

But if they looked like they were printed from the same mold, it was less common.

“Yeah, old lady.”

Uncle Zhang, who had followed them in, also exclaimed, “When I first saw Mr. Qiao, I was also shocked. Mr. Qiao and Second Master do look alike.” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“It’s a pity that Second Brother isn’t at home.” The Old Madam looked at Qiao Chen and said, “Otherwise, he would be even more surprised if he saw it himself. Mianmian, do you and Chen Chen look like your father and your mother?”

The Old Madam knew that Qiao Mianmian had a younger brother.

After knowing that Qiao Mianmian and Mo Yesi were married, she had someone investigate Qiao Mianmian.

She had some understanding of her family background.

But the Old Madam didn’t know what Qiao Chen looked like.

Seeing that the siblings did not look alike, she asked curiously.

Generally speaking, if they were siblings, even if one looked like the father and the other took after the mother, there would always be some similarities between them.

But this pair of siblings really did not look alike at all.

The two of them were born very well, but they did not look like siblings.

Qiao Mianmian was stunned.

It seemed like it wasn’t the first time someone had said that she didn’t look like Qiao Chen.

Some people asked the same question as the old lady.

But she and Qiao Chen didn’t seem to resemble the Qiao parents.

On the other hand, Qiao Anxin resembled Father Qiao.

“I think so.” Qiao Mianmian was stunned for a few seconds.

It wasn’t that she wanted to hide anything.

She just didn’t know what to say.

Honestly, wasn’t that weird?

She didn’t look like her father or her mother. Then, who did she look like?

“Then, your father and mother both gave birth well.” The Old Madam smiled and said, “That’s why you two were able to give birth to such a beautiful child. This Chen Chen even looks like my Mo family’s child. It can be seen that the two of you are fated with our Qiao family.”

Because the Old Madam liked Qiao Mianmian, she also thought that Qiao Chen was a good kid.

Now, because Qiao Chen looked like her second son, she liked and doted on him even more.

She looked at Qiao Chen as if he was her grandson.

The more the Old Madam showed that she liked the Qiao siblings and was very satisfied with them, the more anxious Madam Mo felt.

First, she was unhappy with Qiao Mianmian, and now, she disliked Qiao Chen as well.
