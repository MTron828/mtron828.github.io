Chapter 462: You Don’t Have to Change Your Likes and Dislikes for Her

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Gong Zeli’s expression changed, and he bit on his lip even harder.

The light was hanging directly over his handsome face, and it made him look quite scary, especially with the cold look in his eyes.

If he wasn’t so handsome, he would scare people to tears with his expression now.

“It’s because of Rourou, isn’t it?”

As Gong Zeli wasn’t willing to confess, Yan Shaoqing had to speak for him. “You knew that Rourou liked Second Bro and that she was really sad from his marriage with Sis-in-law. That’s why you dislike Sis-in-law?”

Gong Zeli continued to bite on his lip, but he was now also clenching fist even harder.

Yan Shaoqing noticed the look on his face and shook his head. He then said disapprovingly, “Fourth Bro, you can’t act this way. Sis-in-law hasn’t done anything to you. Do you think that it’s fair for her to receive this treatment from you just because she’s married to Second Bro?

“Second Bro was the one who proposed to her. Even if you feel that Rourou was wronged, you have to be reasonable. Does it mean that Second Bro cannot fall in love with another person just because Rourou is in love with him?

“I’m pretty sure both of us knew it already. Second Bro never liked Rourou in that way. Even if Sis-in-law wasn’t the one to marry him now, Rourou would never be the one to marry him.”

Gong Zeli continued to bite his lip and stayed silent. But he seemed to waver. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

He knew that Yan Shaoqing was right.

But Shen Rou was too important to him.

He could never see her go through so much pain.

Anyone who hurt her would be his enemy.

“Fourth Bro, be honest to me. Would you dislike Sis-in-law if Rourou wasn’t in the picture?”

Yan Shaoqing wanted to resolve this situation properly.

Or else, their kinship for so many years would be in jeopardy.

Both Mo Yesi and Gong Zeli were his good brothers.

He didn’t want to lose either of them.

He didn’t want this situation to affect the kinship between them as well.

Mo Yesi couldn’t leave Qiao Mianmian no matter how much Shen Rou disliked her.

Also, he was pretty sure that Mo Yesi wouldn’t mind breaking the kinship if they wouldn’t accept his wife.

He knew him too well.

“Fourth Bro, can you respond?” Yan Shaoqing said impatiently as he realized that Gong Zeli didn’t reply to him for a while. “Stop thinking of other things and reply to my questions.”

Gong Zeli was really irritated.

To him, Yan Shaoqing was like a sparrow that wouldn’t stop chirping.

He was already irritated enough.

He couldn’t be bothered to answer Yan Shaoqing’s questions.

Did he really dislike Qiao Mianmian?

He never gave much thought to that.

If Shen Rou wasn’t in the picture, he wouldn’t feel anything about her.

He wouldn’t have disliked her, but he wouldn’t have liked her as well.

He wasn’t the one married to her. Her looks, background, and personality didn’t have anything to do with him.

So... he probably wouldn’t have disliked her.

“It’s alright. I know your answer without you saying anything.” Yan Shaoqing patted Gong Zeli’s shoulder and earnestly said, “If you don’t dislike her, how did the situation turn out this way? Shen Rou and you are two different individuals. You don’t have to change your likes and dislikes for her.”
