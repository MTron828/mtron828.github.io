Chapter 93: You Are Not Worthy of Knowing My Name

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

After finding such a good man, she still wanted to hide him and not let her find out?

“Mister, I’m really her sister.” After a few seconds, Qiao Anxin finally recovered her smile. She lifted her hand to play with her hair and tried to strike a conversation with him. “My name is Qiao Anxin, it’s nice to meet you. How should I address you?”

Mo Yesi looked at the woman who was obviously flirting with him and felt disgusted.

He had seen many women who had ulterior motives like Qiao Anxin.

It was easy to guess what she was thinking.

If it weren’t for the fact that he wanted to know what her intentions were, he wouldn’t have bothered to look at her.

He endured the disgust in his heart and said coldly, “I’m not interested in what your name is and you are not worthy of my name. If you came here just to tell me these things, you can leave now.”

The man did not bother to cover up his indifference and disdainful attitude.

He only glanced at her once before looking away.

That glance lasted for one second, but it was filled with contempt.

Qiao Anxin’s expression instantly changed.

At once, her expression turned extremely ugly.

She always thought that she was popular with the opposite sex. Since a young age, any man she liked always fell at her feet.

Even Su Ze broke up with Qiao Mianmian for her.

She was beautiful and thought that since she easily seduced Su Ze, it would be easy for her to get any other guy.

Unexpectedly, not only did he not take the bait, but he also showed a face of disgust.

This was a huge blow to Qiao Anxin, who had never been rejected by a man before. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

There was a look of shame and indignation on her face. “Mister, don’t you think that what you said is not very gentlemanly.”

“Gentlemanly?” Mo Yesi smirked. “You’re not even worthy of my time.”

Qiao Anxin felt as though she had been slapped and her shame turned into anger. “Mister, what sort of big shot are you? You’re speaking too arrogantly.”

As soon as she spoke, Qiao Anxin felt a cold gaze fall on her.

The man’s eyes were extremely cold and without a trace of warmth.

Looking at her, his gaze was as sharp as a dagger that was about to stab her.

Fear overcame her entire body and she couldn’t help but shudder.

She was terrified and so shocked by the man’s threatening look that she did not dare to utter another word.

Linda, standing behind her, was also taken aback by Mo Yesi’s temperament and did not even dare to take a breath.

Looking at the speechless woman outside, Mo Yesi frowned and was about to drive off.

If this woman was not Qiao Mianmian’s sister, he wouldn’t have wasted so much time on her.

“Mister, hold on. I have something to tell you. It’s related to my sister!”

Seeing that he was about to leave, Qiao Anxin hurriedly said, “I don’t know how long you’ve known my sister, but she just broke up with her fiancé recently. Do you really not mind her rushing into a relationship with you?

“My sister loved her fiancé and they’ve known each other for ten full years. The feelings they had for each other are incomparable. My sister definitely hasn’t forgotten about him yet since they just broke up. However, she’s in a relationship with you now. Aren’t you worried that she has another motive?”
