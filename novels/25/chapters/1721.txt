Chapter 1722: You Want to Marry Me, Never in This Lifetime

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“You’re just a toy that someone can sleep with after spending some money. How dare you snatch my man, you...”

Before Shangguan Qing could finish her sentence, her face was slapped to the side.

Five bloody finger marks appeared on her cheek.

Gong Zeli said icily, “If you dare to say another word, I’ll make sure you can’t open your mouth.

“It’s impossible for you to marry me in this lifetime. I feel disgusted seeing a woman like you. Get lost immediately!”

This slap wasn’t light.

Shangguan Qing took a few steps back and fell to the ground.

She cried out in pain.

Gong Zeli looked at her coldly for a second before looking away.

He said to Qiao Mianmian, “Ignore her, she’s crazy. I have nothing to do with her.

“I don’t know what my mom said to her. But my mom is my mom, and I’m me. She can’t decide anything about me.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

When she was about to hit her, Gong Zeli had already taught Shangguan Qing a lesson.

Seeing Shangguan Qing lying on the ground, half of her face swollen, holding her injured knee, and crying, Qiao Mianmian felt that she didn’t have to do anything.

Gong Zeli was really ruthless.

Qiao Mianmian felt that he didn’t hold back at all. Shangguan Qing’s face was swollen like a pig’s head, and the five bloody fingerprints were still very clear on her face.

It was obvious how powerful that slap was.

Actually, Qiao Mianmian was shocked by his actions.

She heard from Bai Yusheng that the Gong and Shangguan families wanted to form a marriage alliance.

He hit Shangguan Qing in public and even hit her so badly. The marriage between the two families was probably...

“Mr. Gong, this is all your business. It has nothing to do with me.”

Although Gong Zeli helped her, Qiao Mianmian wasn’t grateful to him. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

On the contrary, her attitude wasn’t very good. Her tone was even a little cold. “Mr. Gong, this is all your business. It has nothing to do with me. You don’t have to say this to me. I don’t want to be misunderstood by your friends.”

Gong Zeli was stunned.

Qiao Mianmian ignored him.

She looked at Shangguan Qing, who was still crying on the ground, and took two steps forward. She stopped in front of her and looked down at her coldly. “Miss Shangguan, I don’t care what your relationship with Gong Zeli is. This is my last warning.

“I have nothing to do with Gong Zeli. I have a boyfriend, and we have a good relationship. If you’re delusional, go to the hospital for early treatment. Don’t keep fantasizing about anyone snatching your man. This is an illness, it has to be treated.”

Shangguan Qing covered her face and looked up with swollen eyes. “You shameless vixen, you...”

“Vixen, vixen, is this how the Shangguan Family teaches you?” Qiao Mianmian sneered. “Only beautiful women are called vixens. I’ll take it that you’re jealous of my looks.

“If a person isn’t good-looking enough, they can change their appearance through some means. But if their heart is ugly, then it’s hopeless.”

Shangguan Qing’s chest heaved.
