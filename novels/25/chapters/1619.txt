Chapter 1621: Worried That He’d Be Overcome With Jealousy

She tried to persuade him. “But we’ll all be filming, you’ll be bored alone. And I won’t have time to care about you. You should go back and rest first. I’ll call you when I’m done.”

Mo Yesi didn’t mind. “You don’t have to care about me. I’m not a child, I know how to pass the time.”

“But...” Qiao Mianmian struggled.

“Baby, you don’t have to worry that I’ll be bored.” Mo Yesi smiled. “When the time comes, you can do your thing. Don’t worry about me.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

She wasn’t worried that he would be bored.

She was worried that he would be jealous.

“Why, you don’t want me to stay?” Mo Yesi saw the conflict on her face and frowned. “You don’t want the rest of the crew to see me with you?”

“No.” Qiao Mianmian immediately denied it. “We’ve already made it public, and the crew knows that you’re here today. What’s there to not let others know?”

“Then, why don’t you want me to stay?”

Mo Yesi wasn’t stupid. He could tell that Qiao Mianmian was finding so many excuses just to stop him from staying.

Qiao Mianmian kept quiet for a while.

A moment later, she seemed to have compromised. She sighed and said, “Alright, you’re the one who wants to stay. Anyway, don’t be angry later. No matter what I do, it’s a job requirement.”

Mo Yesi frowned again. “What do you mean?”

“Nothing.” Qiao Mianmian blinked. “Alright, it’s about time. Let’s go.”

She didn’t intend to tell him now. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

She felt that if she told Mo Yesi now, he might make unreasonable requests of Bai Yusheng.

Like changing the script.

She believed he could do this.

...

When Qiao Mianmian and Mo Yesi appeared hand in hand in front of the rest of the crew, everyone looked at them in shock.

Qiao Mianmian made it public on Weibo.

The crew knew that she wasn’t single anymore.

And everyone knew that she had a rich and handsome boyfriend.

But Qiao Mianmian brought her boyfriend over so openly.

Some of the female artistes’ eyes lit up when they saw Mo Yesi’s handsome face.

Someone had posted a picture of Mo Yesi online.

Hence, everyone was familiar with his looks.

But seeing him online was different from seeing him in real life.

The Mo Yesi in the photo was already very charming.

His charm in real life doubled.

It wasn’t just the female artistes. The eyes of all the men in the crew lit up when they saw Mo Yesi.

Bai Yusheng was stunned when he saw his sister and brother-in-law appear in front of the crew.

Qiao Mianmian held Mo Yesi’s hand and walked towards him.

Bai Yusheng looked at them. “What are you doing?”

“Brother, he wants to stay on set and wait for me to end work. Help me arrange it.”

Qiao Mianmian was glad that the director was her brother. Moreover, Mo Yesi and Bai Yusheng had a good relationship.

It was easy to arrange this.

Bai Yusheng was stunned and turned to look at Mo Yesi. “You want to stay on set?”
