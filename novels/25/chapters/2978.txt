He was really waiting outside.

Qiao Mianmian didn’t doubt that Mo Yesi would really wait outside all night if she didn’t go out.

She couldn’t possibly let him wait outside all night.

“Mom, I need to go out,” she said as she looked out of the window.

“You’re going out now?” Madam Bai looked at the time and was shocked. “It’s already so late, where are you going?”

“Mo Yesi is here.” Qiao Mianmian didn’t hide it from her. “He’s waiting for me outside, I have to see him.”

“So, he was the one who sent you the message?”

“Mm.”

“This child.” Madam Bai laughed. “It’s only the second day, and he can’t hold it in anymore. I knew he’d come to look for you secretly, but I didn’t expect him to be unable to hold it in after only a day apart. This is a little surprising.”

Women had always been the ones clinging to men.

Her son-in-law was an exception.

No matter how she looked at it, her son-in-law cared very much about her daughter.

They’d only been apart for a day, and he couldn’t help but look for her.

Even a couple in their honeymoon period wouldn’t be so clingy.

This son-in-law was chosen by her daughter. Previously, Madam Bai was still worried, but now she could rest assured.

She thought that her daughter wouldn’t be able to control this outstanding son-in-law. She was afraid that she would lose out in the future. It seemed like she was overthinking.

It was rare for her to have such an outstanding son-in-law. He was obviously being controlled by her daughter.

Madam Bai smiled gently at her obedient and adorable daughter. She patted Qiao Mianmian’s head and said, “Go on, you don’t have to come back tonight. You can come back tomorrow morning.”

Madam Bai had been through this before. Of course, she wouldn’t force her daughter to abide by any rules and prevent her from meeting her son-in-law.

She didn’t care about the rules.

As long as her daughter and son-in-law had a good relationship, it was most important to have a good life.

Qiao Mianmian was a little stunned by her words. “I don’t have to come back tonight?”

“Come back if you want to, and don’t come back if you don’t want to.” Madam Bai smiled. “Although there are rules, you don’t have to follow them. You can choose not to come back tonight, but you have to come back tomorrow morning

“I still have to do what I have to do.

“Alright, go look for Yesi.” Mother Bai patted her head again, her eyes full of affection. “Don’t let him wait too long.”

Qiao Mianmian left in her pajamas.

When she reached downstairs, she bumped into Bai Yusheng, who had just returned.

“Brother.” Qiao Mianmian greeted him obediently.

Bai Yusheng nodded. Seeing that she was about to leave, he reached out and grabbed her. “It’s so late, where are you going?”

“I-I’m going to see a friend.” Qiao Mianmian didn’t have to hide anything from Madam Bai, but she was a little embarrassed to say it to her brother.

“A friend?” Bai Yusheng narrowed his eyes. “What friend is looking for you so late?”

He recalled that when he came back, he saw a car parked by the gate.

That car looked familiar.

“Mm, it’s just a friend. I’m not talking to you anymore. My friend is still waiting for me outside. I have to go out.” Afraid that Bai Yusheng would get to the bottom of it, before he could continue asking, Qiao Mianmian pushed him away and ran out. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“Why is this girl being so secretive?” Bai Yusheng saw that Qiao Mianmian had run off and was worried about her going out so late. He was about to follow her to see who she was going to meet when he suddenly realized something..
