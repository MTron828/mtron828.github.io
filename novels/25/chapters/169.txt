Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

How could his fragile heart take such scares?

“Is there an issue?” Mo Yesi asked as he sensed hesitation.

“No!” Wei Zheng immediately straightened up and looked him in the eye. “No problem at all. Don’t worry, Chairman Mo, I’ll definitely get it done well.”

“Mm.” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Mo Yesi waved him away. “You can leave, then. There’s someone sleeping in the room, don’t close the door too hard.”

Wei Zheng replied, “... Alright.”

...

At the hospital.

Lin Huizhen couldn’t stop crying since she regained consciousness after passing out earlier.

“Mom, don’t cry anymore.”

Qiao Anxin was getting panicky from her mother’s crying. “What’s the point in crying? I’m frustrated enough as it is, can you let me have some quiet.”

Qiao Anxin’s assistant handed her an ice pack for her face.

There were only two weeks left for the upcoming film’s shoot.

She couldn’t turn up with a swollen face.

Moreover, she had a shoot in two days for a commercial. The bruise had to subside by then.

Lin Huizhen looked up at her. “What do you mean by that! Your mom just got bullied by someone else. Instead of feeling hurt for me, you’re finding me annoying? Is this what a daughter should be like?”

Qiao Anxin said quietly between clenched teeth, “Do you think you’re the only one who’s been bullied? What’s the point in crying now when it doesn’t solve anything? All I’m thinking of is how we can get Qiao Mianmian to pay for this.”

Upon hearing Qiao Mianmian’s name, fury sparked in Lin Huizhen’s eyes. Her expression was distorted as she said, “That bitch is really too much. I wish I could skin her alive.

“Who knows where she got that wild man from, how could he treat us this way! The thought of that bitch trampling all over us disgusts me. I can’t take this lying down!

“Oh right, have you called Su Ze?”

Qiao Anxin’s thoughts drifted while her mother was grumbling on and on.

The man with Qiao Mianmian wasn’t just some wild man.

He was someone way more outstanding than Su Ze.

Before she met other men, she had thought that Su Ze was rather satisfactory in every aspect.

It would look good on her to have him around anywhere she went.

But now...

She wasn’t so satisfied anymore.

Once she compared that mysterious man to Su Ze, she realized that what she once thought as Su Ze’s strengths and unique features weren’t impressive at all.

He and the mysterious man were worlds apart.

They couldn’t even be compared to each other.

How could she possibly tolerate seeing that Qiao Mianmian’s man was better than hers!

“Anxin, did you hear what I said!”

Lin Huizhen’s furious voice snapped Qiao Anxin out of her senses.

Lin Huizhen frowned at her. “I asked whether you’ve given Su Ze a call. When is he coming over? And what are you doing, looking so frazzled? Also, who exactly is that wild man with Qiao Mianmian, do you know him?”
