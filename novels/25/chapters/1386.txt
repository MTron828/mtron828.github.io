Chapter 1387: So Good, I’ll Add a Chicken Leg Tonight

“Hubby, marry me!”

“Sisters, I’ll call him Hubby first.”

“Don’t fight with me for my husband. I’m still young, let me win.”

Mo Yesi’s Weibo comment section was flooded with “Hubby” comments.

Mo Yesi rarely logged into his Weibo account.

Back then, he’d registered for Weibo only to make it public with Qiao Mianmian. Every time he logged in, it was for Qiao Mianmian.

He never checked Weibo.

Not long after Qiao Mianmian posted on Weibo, Jiang Luoli sent her a message.

Jiang Luoli: [Baby, are you afraid?]

Qiao Mianmian replied instantly: [Why?]

Jiang Luoli: [A bunch of people is trying to steal your husband. You have to hide your Prince Charming well. Your love rivals are too scary.]

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

Jiang Luoli sent her a screenshot of Mo Yesi’s comment section.

Qiao Mianmian opened the screenshot and saw someone calling Mo Yesi “Hubby”.

She didn’t feel threatened. She only found it funny.

She handed the cell phone to Mo Yesi and said, “Many women want to marry you this time. What should I do? You’re so popular now. I feel threatened.”

“Mm?”

Mo Yesi looked at the cell phone.

The man frowned and looked unhappy.

He returned the cell phone to Qiao Mianmian and took out his own.

After a while, Jiang Luoli sent Qiao Mianmian another message.

Jiang Luoli: [Wow, Prince Charming is so loving. You got him to post on Weibo?]

Qiao Mianmian was confused.

Jiang Luoli sent her another screenshot.

Qiao Mianmian opened it and saw that it was a Weibo post from Mo Yesi.

Nameless: “I only have one wife. My wife @QiaoMianmianV.”

Qiao Mianmian realized that Mo Yesi posted on Weibo without saying anything to her.

Was it because he saw the screenshots of someone calling him Hubby, so he specially posted this on Weibo to express his stand?

This man...

Qiao Mianmian couldn’t help but smile. She entered Weibo and saw Mo Yesi @ her.

“Damn, is this a response? He wants us to stop calling him Hubby?”

“He hasn’t posted on Weibo in a long time, and now he posted this. He must have seen the comments calling him Hubby. Hahaha, I suddenly feel that Qiao Mianmian’s boyfriend pampers her so much. He’s so cute.”

“I don’t think the man sent it willingly. It was the woman who made him do it.”

“It doesn’t matter if the man did it willingly. As long as he’s willing to post it, it shows that he cares about her. If he doesn’t care about you, will he be willing to post it?” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“This response is hilarious.”

“So, stop being so smitten. He must have seen too many of them, that’s why he posted this. You guys are too unreserved. How can a girlfriend not be jealous when her boyfriend gets so many ‘wives’?”

Qiao Mianmian smiled as she read the comments.

Although there were many haters online, many netizens were still cute.

Someone posted on Weibo so self-awarely and even tagged her. She naturally had to respond.

She thought for a while and sent a Weibo message.

Qiao Mianmian V: “Mm, got it. You performed so well, I’ll add a drumstick tonight, @Nameless.”
