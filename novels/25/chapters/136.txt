Chapter 137: He Couldn’t Be Fine with It

She wriggled and struggled in his arms.

Mo Yesi tightened his arms around her. “Baby, don’t move like this. Are you trying to have me eat you up right here in the bathroom?”

He was getting aroused by the way she moved.

He was so close to just eating her, losing control of himself.

His voice was way too hoarse.

And the panting was getting more intense.

Qiao Mianmian looked up with her eyes fogged up and saw that handsome face.

His lips were pursed and beads of water were rolling off his forehead.

Down his forehead was his high nose bridge...

His Adam’s apple trembled too while he panted.

That was what it looked like for a man to be so aroused, so full of desire...

Qiao Mianmian felt a little bad seeing that he looked rather awful.

That man was alluring.

His amazing figure, incredible looks...

He was attractive in every aspect.

Qiao Mianmian was actually a little pleasantly surprised and smug to find that a man like this could lose control over her.

Perhaps her vanity was being fulfilled.

“Baby, be good, don’t move about like this.” He buried his head in her hair and mumbled. “Baby, be good. Just let me hold you for a while longer. Just let me hold you for a while longer...”

Qiao Mianmian was all tense.

And the moment he said that she just stopped moving.

She held out for a minute or so, with him breathing by her ear. Mo Yesi held her without moving too.

A moment later, his breathing finally stabilized. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

The arm around her relaxed a little.

“Baby...” His voice was extremely hoarse as he looked up at her. “Aren’t you ready yet? Remember what I told you? I’ll give you a week. We’re only left with two days, I hope you can adjust yourself soon. I wouldn’t want you to resist me this way even after a week.

“I want us to be an actual married couple, not just in name.”

With that, he stroked her face. “There’s a limit to my patience. I don’t wish to force it on you. You know what I mean?”

He had been wanting her all along.

This had been in his head the whole time and had only intensified after he saw Su Ze today.

Although he knew that she and Su Ze were over, the thought of them having had 10 years of relationship and been about to get married inevitably made him jealous.

Su Ze was her childhood sweetheart.

And also her first love.

Not to mention the man she almost married.

If it wasn’t for Su Ze’s cheating, she would’ve happily become Mrs. Su. Her husband would’ve been a man named Su Ze, not him, Mo Yesi.

With all these in mind, he couldn’t be fine with it.
