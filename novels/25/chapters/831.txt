Chapter 832: You... Don’t Like Me Now?

Shen Rou’s expression changed as she widened her eyes. “Gong Zeli, what do you mean? Are you... going to cut ties with me?”

“It’s not that we will cut off ties forever, it’s just that we can’t be friends for the time being.” Gong Zeli’s voice was very calm when he said this. “My friends can’t possibly treat me like a fool for 10 years.

“If I can still maintain a good relationship with you after finding out about this, I’ll really be an idiot. Shen Rou, you can’t be a fool forever. That’s all I have to say.

“I hope you can be more sincere in the future and not use the same method to lie to others. A lie will always be a lie. One day, you’ll be discovered.”

After saying this, Gong Zeli didn’t look at her anymore. He got up and left.

“Gong Zeli, stop right there.”

When they reached the door, Shen Rou’s hysterical cries could be heard from behind. “You said that I’m a liar, but you’re actually the liar. You said that you’d always be good to me, take care of me, and dote on me. Do your words not count?

“You said you like me and that as long as I’m willing, I’ll always be your wife. Don’t you want to keep your word now? Just because I wasn’t the one who saved you that night, all the promises you made previously don’t count?

“You... don’t like me anymore?”

Gong Zeli didn’t turn around.

He stopped at the door and kept quiet for a while before replying calmly, “I said these words. But I thought that you were the one that night, so I made these promises. I thought that you saved me and took me back from death, so I wanted to take care of you for the rest of my life.

“You saved my life, why can’t I take care of you for the rest of my life?”

Gong Zeli paused for a moment before saying coldly, “But you lied to me.

“You’ve taken over everything that belonged to her.”

“So, you said that you liked me and treated me well because you thought I saved you?” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Gong Zeli pursed his lips and replied without hesitation, “Yes.”

Behind him, Shen Rou’s face was covered in tears and her body was trembling. She couldn’t believe this.

She couldn’t accept such a blow.

She thought that Gong Zeli liked her because she was outstanding.

But now, he was telling her that it was all because of that night 10 years ago.

He liked her and treated her well all because of that night.

If she hadn’t lied to him back then, if he found the person who really saved him, his love and affection would belong to someone else.

It had nothing to do with Shen Rou.

How could someone as proud and confident as she accept such a blow?

“Besides this reason, you don’t like me at all?” She didn’t want to believe it. She walked forward and grabbed him. “I don’t believe it, Gong Zeli. I don’t believe you don’t have any feelings for me.

“You’re lying to me, right?

“I know you’re very angry now, so you’re just saying it out of spite. You still care about me, you can’t possibly not care about me anymore. Yes, I lied to you that night, but I didn’t do it on purpose.”

She sobbed and said, “I fought with you that night. You didn’t come back for a long time, so I went to look for you.”
