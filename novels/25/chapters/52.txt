Chapter 53: Married a Capable Husband

After that, he took out his cell phone and dialed a phone number.

Soon, Qiao Mianmian heard him speak to the person on the other end of the phone in a commanding tone. “Yuncheng Film Academy’s Art Performance Department has a performance class at 10 am. You can tell someone to change the time.

“Yes, change it to the afternoon.”

In less than a minute, he hung up.

He put down his phone and looked up at Qiao Mianmian. “The class time has changed to the afternoon. Now, can you eat with me with peace of mind?”

Qiao Mianmian: “???”

What, he could do that?

He managed to change the time with just a phone call?

She seemed to have married a very powerful husband.

Although she knew that Mo Yesi had an extremely great identity, she had always felt like he was capable of earning money.

Now that she thought about it carefully, she remembered that her husband wasn’t just good at making money.

The Mo family wasn’t only rich, but they were also extremely prominent in other respects.

She had heard that the next presidential candidate would be the Mo family’s young master, Mo Shixiu.

If she remembered correctly, there were several libraries and teaching buildings in their school built by the Mo Firm.

At this moment, Qiao Mianmian seemed to realize suddenly that she had married into an extraordinary family.

She also suddenly realized how good the condition of the man she had married was.

He was of a distinguished identity and also had a handsome appearance. He had reached the top of the business empire at such a young age and had become a legend that countless people worshipped.

He was the perfect partner for many ladies.

Such a man originally belonged to a completely different world from her.

Under normal circumstances, there would be no possibility of interaction in their lives.

But now...

He actually became her husband.

She felt like it was so unbelievable.

If it wasn’t because of his special quality towards her, with his qualifications, he probably wouldn’t have taken a fancy to her.

Thinking of this, Qiao Mianmian felt that in this marriage, she had really taken advantage.

“Come here.” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Seeing that she was still standing there, Mo Yesi frowned a little in dissatisfaction. “What are you still doing there?”

“Oh.”

Qiao Mianmian pushed away a chair beside him, and before she sat down, Mo Yesi frowned again.

The man’s slender fingers tapped on the table next to him and said in an undeniable tone, “Sit next to me.”

Qiao Mianmian glanced at the position next to him, hesitated for a few seconds, then sat over.

Before she was seated, Mo Yesi stretched out his arms, hugged her and brought her into his arms.

Qiao Mianmian sat on his lap, and the man’s strong arms wrapped around her waist. He nudged softly on the soft meat around her waist.

The girl in his embrace was full of a sweet fragrance.

He took a deep breath of her hair and his expression was a little intoxicated.

“What perfume do you usually use and why is it so fragrant?”

Why did the breath on her smell so good.

As soon as she approached him, he felt a sort of incomprehensible comfort.

It seemed like every cell in his body was relaxed.

After last night, he had determined that she was the one he was destined to be with.

Last night, he slept very well. Just like last time, he fell asleep until dawn.

Not only did he sleep for seven hours without waking up halfway, but he also didn’t have that nightmare again.

These things that were sparse and ordinary to others were extravagant to him.

Her appearance had lit a lamp in his dark world.

Since then, he had seen the light.

She wouldn’t know how important she was to him.
