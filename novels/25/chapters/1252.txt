Chapter 1254: Don’t Persist on Mo Yesi Anymore

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Bai Yusheng is outstanding in both family background and appearance. Believe me, you’ll be happy with him.

“Stop clinging to Mo Yesi.”

Shen Rou clenched her fists and was about to speak when her cell phone rang.

She looked down and her expression changed.

It was news.

It showed that the Shen Corporation’s share price suddenly fell an hour ago, and in a very strange way.

It fell very slowly at first.

But even though the drop was slow, it continued to fall every minute.

As a result, an hour later, the Shen Corporation’s share price actually fell a lot.

What was even stranger was that the drop was very slow an hour ago, but after an hour, it was obviously faster.

The news analyzed that if it fell by a day, it would be a terrible blow to the Shen Corporation’s stock market.

Shen Rou thought about Father Shen’s phone call and his hasty departure...

Her hand trembled and her face went pale.

“Rourou, w-what’s wrong?” Madam Shen didn’t hear Shen Rou’s response. She turned around and was shocked to see her pale face.

Shen Rou didn’t say anything. Her face was still pale as she read the news.

Madam Shen followed her gaze and looked down. After a while, her face also turned pale.

Even after Madam Shen married Shen Yuncheng, she stayed at home to take care of her husband and children.

But that didn’t mean she didn’t know anything.

She knew how to speculate on her own and had a certain understanding of the stock market.

“Your dad just said that it’s a small problem.” Madam Shen immediately took her cell phone and read the news carefully. Her face turned even paler. “I knew that something big must have happened in the company.

“Why did the Shen Corporation’s share price suddenly drop so much? It was so stable before.

“Gosh, what should we do?

“If this continues, how can the Shen family hold on? Could it be... that the Shen family is destined to fall in this calamity?”

“Mom, don’t be anxious.” Seeing that Madam Shen was about to cry, Shen Rou tried to calm her down. “It’s normal for the stock market to rise and fall.”

“If it was really normal, your dad wouldn’t be so anxious. If it was in the past, I wouldn’t be worried, but now...” Madam Shen grabbed Shen Rou’s hand tightly. “Rourou, the Shen Corporation can’t withstand a little wind and rain.

“The Shen Corporation is really in danger if this continues.

“What should we do? What should we do?” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Madam Shen suddenly looked up at Shen Rou.

But soon, her eyes dimmed again.

The Shen family needed a certain amount of money to support themselves.

But now, who was willing to invest so much money into the Shen Corporation?

She originally wanted Shen Rou to marry into the Bai family. This way, she could rely on the Bai family to help the Shen family survive this crisis.

But now, even if Shen Rou and Bai Yusheng agreed, they couldn’t get married immediately.

The Bai family wouldn’t be willing to invest in the Shen family right away.

Shen Rou looked at Madam Shen’s flustered and afraid expression and took a deep breath. She held her hand tightly and said, “Mom, don’t worry. I’ll think of a way.”
