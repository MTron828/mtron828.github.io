Chapter 463: I Was Shocked by Your Voice

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Anyway.” Yan Shaoqing took a long look at Gong Zeli and asked, “Fourth Bro, I really can’t understand your thought process. Why do you want to matchmake the girl you like to another guy?”

Gong Zeli immediately frowned and snapped. “Yan Shaoqing!”

“Aren’t you?” Yan Shaoqing replied while raising his eyebrow. “Ah Si’s marriage should have been good news for you because Rourou would have needed to give up her feelings for him. Who knows if she would realize that you have always been there waiting for her. She might even be so touched that she wants to be with you.

“You should be thankful towards Sis-in-law, actually.

“But look at what you’ve done. You have been so upset over Second Bro’s marriage. Are you hoping that Second Bro has a divorce so that Rourou can get together with him?”

Gong Zeli frowned even more.

He wasn’t hoping for Mo Yesi to get a divorce at all.

He just didn’t want Shen Rou to be so upset.

“Put some thought into this. I don’t think he did anything wrong. I would do the same if I was in the same position. No one can insult the woman that I love. Even if you really don’t like her, you shouldn’t show it for Second Bro’s sake.

“How would you feel if Rourou was treated the same way by another person?”

Gong Zeli fell silent as he continued to bite on his lip.

As Yan Shaoqing was about to leave so that Gong Zeli could think things through, an angelic voice came from one of the rooms.

It was a euphonious voice.

It could even be compared to the chirps of the best sounding songbird.

Yan Shaoqing was shocked by the voice.

The voice was coming from the room opposite theirs. The clear voice had a sharp contrast to the noisy environment, and it was so calming that it would soothe the most anxious person.

Yan Shaoqing had never heard such a voice before.

He loved it. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

It was so sweet and gentle that it aroused his interests.

“Damn! Fourth Bro, can you hear that? I wonder who the goddess singing is. Her voice is so nice,” Yan Shaoqing exclaimed as he couldn’t resist such a voice.

Just like how he couldn’t resist sweet and cute girls.

Gong Zeli also noticed the voice the moment it appeared.

It was both unique and pleasing to the ear.

But he wasn’t like Yan Shaoqing.

Hence, he didn’t give much of a reaction even though he found the voice to be nice.

He was so caught up with other things that he couldn’t care less about Yan Shaoqing. Hence, he answered patronizingly, “Yup.”

Excited, Yan Shaoqing exclaimed, “I’ve got to know who the owner of that voice is. I love it so much. If she looks as sweet as her voice, I’ll chase after her immediately.”

Gong Zeli’s mood was bad. Hence, he didn’t want Yan Shaoqing to be so joyful.

He scoffed. “Everyone with a nice voice is ugly. Go and search for her, then. I’m sure that you’ll find a masculine girl.”

Yan Shaoqing replied, “Shut up. She must be a sweet and cute girl. My instincts have never failed me.”

“Hehe, why don’t we have a bet?”

“Bet? What are we betting on?”

“If the owner of the voice is ugly, you owe me a car. I want your new sports car. Likewise, if the owner of the voice is really pretty, I owe you a car.”
