Chapter 525: Come Over, Give Me a Hug

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Qiao Mianmian was sitting right on him.

She could feel it the moment the idea popped up in his head.

She looked afraid and immediately pushed him as she hopped off his lap.

Only after she took a few steps back did she look up at him.

Mo Yesi was a little shocked but more amused. He smiled and raised a brow. “Baby, what’s wrong?”

Qiao Mianmian didn’t say anything. She simply looked down at that part of him.

There was an obvious change somewhere beneath his black pants.

Qiao Mianmian bit her lip and scolded him as a beast in her head.

He’d already gone so hard on her, and he still...

He couldn’t be so mean!

Mo Yesi looked at where she was peering at and smiled.

His lips curled up as he turned in his chair to face her. “Baby, come over, give me a hug.”

Qiao Mianmian looked at him cautiously and shook her head. “I don’t want to.”

She wasn’t going over.

He was intimidating now.

Mo Yesi smiled and looked almost evil. “Are you afraid of me? Baby, what are you afraid of? I can’t eat you up.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

She was afraid he’d eat her up.

He was a hungry wolf who’d swallow her whole, bones and all.

“You’re not coming over?” Mo Yesi raised a brow and then got up. “Alright, then. I’ll come over.”

Qiao Mianmian looked like a sheep facing a big bad wolf. She widened her eyes and turned around, all ready to flee.

But after taking only a step, someone hugged her from behind.

“Little one, where are you going?” She was so light to him, he picked her up easily and carried her horizontally.

He then brought her to the couch and put her down gently, despite her struggles.

She’d just been “tormented” by him on this very couch.

This spot was scary to her.

She immediately turned around and was about to hop off the couch too.

“You’re that afraid of me?” Mo Yesi was amused. He pinned her down easily and placed a hand on her head as if comforting a little kitten. “Don’t worry, I’m not that terrible. I know you’re still feeling unwell from just now, so I won’t touch you again today.

“So, you don’t have to hide from me.”

Mo Yesi thought, You won’t be able to get away if I really want you.

Although he was quite a beast, he wasn’t so bad as to neglect her bodily conditions.

The thought did come to mind, but it was just a thought.

He knew that he’d gone very hard on her, and she was definitely still suffering the aftereffects.

How could he sacrifice her body just for his desire?

Upon hearing that, Qiao Mianmian quietened down and did not struggle anymore.

But she still looked at him with caution, unable to trust him fully. “Really? You won’t touch me today?”

“Mm.” Mo Yesi bent over and put one of her legs up.

Qiao Mianmian stiffened immediately. “What are you doing?”
