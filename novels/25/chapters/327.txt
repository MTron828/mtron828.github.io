Chapter 329: You Mean, Officially?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

For some reason, Qiao Chen felt a strange void all of a sudden.

His heart stung.

The person who had harassed him for three years was finally willing to let him go.

He should be happy.

But he didn’t feel any joy nor relief.

In fact, his heart felt heavy.

The confusion and sense of loss in his eyes were evident.

What was going on with him?

The person who knew Qiao Chen best was none other than Qiao Mianmian.

Seeing how distracted and lost he looked, Qiao Mianmian turned her gaze to Shen Xin, who’d long left, and made a bold speculation.

Perhaps, this silly brother of hers didn’t actually detest her at all.

Everyone was a little off throughout the meal.

Qiao Chen would check his cell phone every once in a while, though nobody knew what he was looking at.

In any case, he seemed distracted.

Meanwhile, Jiang Luoli wanted so badly to grab Qiao Mianmian and ask her, just when did she and Mo Yesi get married!

When she heard Gong Zeli mention Mo Yesi and Qiao Mianmian’s marriage, her jaw dropped.

She seemed a little dazed now.

Gosh, her Baby and Prince Charming were already married?!

But how could she not know anything about this?!!

Qiao Mianmian told her that she was just dating Mo Yesi!

Dating and being married were two completely different things.

Jiang Luoli was a little upset, as she never thought that Qiao Mianmian would hide this from her.

They were bosom buddies.

How could she hide something as important as marriage?

Qiao Mianmian saw that Jiang Luoli wasn’t too happy. She picked up her cell phone and sent her a message.

Jiang Luoli took a look when she heard her cell phone beep.

She saw that “Baby” had sent her a message on WeChat.

Baby: [Luo Luo, I didn’t mean to hide it from you. I’ll explain it to you when we’re back in school, alright?]

Jiang Luoli looked up at her and shot her a glare, then replied: [Hmph.]

Qiao Mianmian sent her another message: [I really didn’t mean to hide this from you. I’ll tell you everything you want to know later when we’re back. Luo Luo, my good girl, the prettiest, most adorable little goddess in the entire world, don’t be angry at me anymore alright. Being angry will affect your beautiful looks. (Hug emoji)]

Jiang Luoli saw the text full of mushy words. Although she was still a little upset, she felt much better than before.

After all, Qiao Mianmian was being sincere about her apology. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

And she wasn’t an unreasonable person herself.

Since her Baby decided to hide it from her, she probably had her own good reasons for it.

As close as they were, it wasn’t wrong for them to still hold their own secrets.

Jiang Luoli: [Alright, then. I’ll come after you when we’re back! But, are you and Prince Charming really married?]

This time, Qiao Mianmian replied quickly: [Mm.]

Jiang Luoli: [You mean, officially? With the documents and all?]

Mianmian: [Mm.]

Jiang Luoli: [... You said you wouldn’t consider marriage before you turn 28.]

Qiao Mianmian blushed a little when she saw the reply.

She bit her lip in embarrassment, unsure of how to reply.

Mm, she did say that before.

But also, she did mean it when she said that.
