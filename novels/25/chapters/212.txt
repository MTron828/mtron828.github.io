Chapter 213: Who Are You Chatting With So Happily?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“The third female lead has a love-line with the male lead. Baby, I’ll be rooting for you. I’ll come to visit the crew next time, hehe.”

The male lead was Tu Yilei?

Qiao Mianmian was taken aback and a little surprised.

Tu Yilei was all the rage right now.

It seemed like the drama Jiang Luoli introduced to her was another big production.

Furthermore, the third female lead even had a love-line with the male lead...

There would probably be a lot of competitors.

After hanging up the phone, Qiao Mianmian was still thinking about the audition.

Soon, Jiang Luoli sent her the specific time and location of the audition.

The audition was at nine o’clock tomorrow morning at the Yuncheng City Hotel.

After seeing the title of the drama sent by Jiang Luoli, Qiao Mianmian felt a little surprised.

The title was exactly the same as an online novel she had read before, and it was even a novel she was fond of and had read at least three times.

She was also a fan of the original author.

She wasn’t sure if this drama was adapted from the novel she had read before, so she immediately asked Jiang Luoli for verification. She asked: [Luo Luo, was this drama adapted from an online novel?]

Jiang Luoli quickly replied to her: [Yes, the original author is rather famous, and has millions of fans on Weibo. This novel also has a lot of fans, so if you shoot it well, the ratings certainly won’t be low. I also heard that the original author has a lot of authority over this drama and has participated in the casting. The male lead has also been appointed by her.]

After verifying it, Qiao Mianmian couldn’t help but feel fired up.

It really was the novel she had read before.

She had to say, the original author had good taste.

Tu Yilei’s appearance and temperament were quite similar to the male protagonist in the original novel.

The male protagonist in the original novel had the image of a young but protective puppy, and Tu Yilei had been showing off this image ever since his debut.

It could even be said that the character in the original novel had been tailored for Tu Yilei.

Qiao Mianmian had read the original novel before, so she knew the rivalry between the third female lead and the male lead.

If the original novel wasn’t changed much, then the female third lead would have a lot of scenes. Furthermore, she was a rather likable character.

This kind of role was easy to attract people’s attention and was very helpful in the rise of a newcomer’s popularity.

If she could become the third female lead...

Thinking of this, she was a little excited.

...

Mo Yesi saw this scene when he opened the door and walked into the bedroom with boiled brown sugar water.

Previously in low spirits and looking soft and meek, the young girl was now looking at her phone with her eyes lit up brightly.

Moreover, she seemed extremely agitated and excited.

She was a completely different person now.

Although her face still looked a little pale and weak, she was in much better spirits.

It was as if someone had pumped her up.

“Baby.”

Mo Yesi licked his lips and walked over. “Who are you chatting with so happily? Does your stomach still hurt? I boiled some brown sugar water, give it a taste. It should taste good. Come and drink it while it’s hot.”

Mo Yesi had researched it.

Brown sugar water had to be drunk when hot for it to work well.

It was said to relieve the cold.

As someone who had been in the hospital for several years, he was good at surgery but didn’t know much about gynecology.

Thus, he didn’t know if brown sugar water really could relieve the cold.

But since this method worked on Qiao Mianmian, it didn’t matter whether there was a relevant negative basis or not.
