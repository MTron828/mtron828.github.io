Chapter 588: Ten Years Ago, Did You...

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

This was the first time Gong Zeli seriously observed Qiao Mianmian.

He had never properly taken a look at her before.

His only perception of her before was that she was really attractive.

But it was different this time.

He finally realized that Qiao Mianmian was really pretty after being oblivious to it for so long.

She had a really small frame. Her facial features were perfect.

Gong Zeli had seen countless beauties growing up because of his background. He was already immune to beautiful ladies.

But as he observed the lady in front of him, he could feel his heartbeat speed up.

It was a feeling... that he hadn’t felt in a long time.

The last time this had happened to him was when he was in the second year of elementary school.

That time, he had fallen in love with a sweet-looking girl in his class.

That girl sat next to him. She was really good in her studies. She also had a sweet voice and a cute personality.

But Gong Zeli was the infamous school bully at that time.

Not only did he have a bad temper, but he was also bad in his studies. He was also a troublemaker.

It was the school policy at that time to partner up a bad student with a good one. Hence, he was partnered up with her.

In the beginning, they couldn’t stand each other.

Gong Zeli even thought that he hated her. He had always thought that she was being a busybody and it annoyed him.

This was until...

That girl transferred out of the school. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

On the second day of her transfer, Gong Zeli noticed that her seat was empty. As he found out that she had transferred out, he felt heartbroken.

Only after a long while did he realize he was in love with her.

He also realized that his heartbeat speed wasn’t because he hated her.

It was because he was in love with her.

As he recalled this, Gong Zeli’s eyes widened in shock. This familiar feeling returned.

Fear appeared on his face as he took a step back.

He stared at Qiao Mianmian in fear.

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

She touched her face.

What did Gong Zeli see?

Was there something scary on her face?

“Mr. Gong, are you...”

Qiao Mianmian took a step towards him, curious about what he saw.

But the moment she did so, Gong Zeli took a step away from her.

It was as though he was afraid of her.

She felt as though he was avoiding her like the plague.

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

She was affected by his actions.

As she walked towards him, a gust of wind blew. Gong Zeli could smell a weak fragrance coming from Qiao Mianmian.

It smelled similar to flowers with a hint of peach.

It was a scent that he was familiar with.

The girl that swam towards him ten years ago had the same smell.

Gong Zeli clenched his fist. It was the first time he felt nervous.

He felt lost as he stared at her puzzledly.

The person that saved him that night was Shen Rou.

Why did he find that familiar scent on another girl?

“Miss Qiao, did you...” Gong Zeli stared at her for a while before asking. “Ten years ago, did you...”
