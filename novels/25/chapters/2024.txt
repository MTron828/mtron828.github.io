Chapter 2025: That’s Chairman Mo’s Girlfriend?

He kissed her on the lips. “Are you bored? Have you been waiting for a long time?”

“It’s alright, I just waited for a while. What about the meeting? Why did you end it early?”

“My baby was waiting for me, of course I had to end the meeting early.” Mo Yesi kissed her again.

Feeling a strong gaze on her back, Qiao Mianmian lightly punched his chest. “Don’t be like this, there are others in the office. Put me down.”

“Chairman Mo…”

The secretary was already used to their loving ways. She looked at the woman beside her who seemed a little pale and thought for a while before reminding him. “Chairman Mo, Assistant Yang from Tiansheng has been waiting for you for an hour.”

Mo Yesi gently placed Qiao Mianmian back on the sofa.

As he turned around and looked at the woman standing behind him, the gentleness and pampering when facing Qiao Mianmian changed to his usual coldness and alienation. “Bring Assistant Yang to the living room. I’ll be there in 10 minutes.” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“Yes, Chairman Mo.”

The secretary walked to the woman and smiled politely. “Assistant Yang, please.”

The woman looked at Qiao Mianmian sitting on the sofa barefooted and heard Mo Yesi asking his secretary to bring her to the living room. She couldn’t help but feel angry.

“Chairman Mo, I have something important. We…”

“Bring Assistant Yang to the living room.” Mo Yesi frowned.

The secretary didn’t dare to delay any further and immediately said to the woman, “Assistant Yang, I’ll take you to the living room. You can speak to Chairman Mo later.”

The woman wanted to say more, but the secretary had already opened the office door and was leading her out.

She looked at Mo Yesi’s cold but handsome face and clenched her fists before reluctantly turning and leaving.

…

The moment they left the office, the woman couldn’t wait to ask the secretary, “Who was that girl? Do you know her?”

The secretary turned and looked at her, amused.

Every woman who had seen Chairman Mo, especially unmarried women, would be tempted.

After all, how many women could resist such an outstanding man?

But this woman was too obvious.

The secretary sighed and looked at her sympathetically. “That’s Chairman Mo’s girlfriend. Chairman Mo dotes on her a lot. She’s very beautiful, right? If I had such a beautiful girlfriend, I’d definitely pamper her too.”

The woman’s expression stiffened.

“Chairman Mo’s girlfriend?”

“That’s right.” The secretary pretended not to know what she was thinking and smiled. “His girlfriend often comes here to look for him. Everyone in the office knows her. Miss Qiao is quite a nice person. She’s pretty and has a good personality. She doesn’t put on airs in front of us.

“We all like her.

“Every time she comes over, Chairman Mo will end the meeting early if he’s in a meeting. He doesn’t want her to wait for too long. Moreover, Chairman Mo will get us to prepare a lot of food in advance because Miss Qiao eats heartily.”
