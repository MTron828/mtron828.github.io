Chapter 75: Not in a Good Mood

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

On the way to the hospital, Mo Yesi called Lu Rao.

After a few rings, Lu Rao picked up and said feebly, “Young Master Mo, if it’s about your emotional consultation, let’s talk another day. Or maybe you can find me after letting me sleep for a few hours.”

Mo Yesi caressed the soft hair of the young girl in his arms and snorted. “Why, were you overworked last night?”

Lu Rao: “... F*ck you! I just came out of the operating room, okay? You can try having an operation for ten hours and see how it feels! I’m as tired as a dog. No, no, even dogs are not as tired as me!”

Mo Yesi had no fluctuations in his heart as he listened to his good brother’s complaints.

“I don’t care whether you have become a dog, you just have to spare an hour for me. I’m bringing Mianmian to the hospital now, and I will reach within ten minutes. She was injured, so you should take a look.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

She wanted to say that her injury was not even considered serious!

“Mianmian?” Lu Rao suddenly heard Mo Yesi address a girl so intimately and was stunned for a few moments before coming to a realization. “You’re talking about your little wife? She was injured? Where? What injury? Is it very serious?”

“Yes.” Mo Yesi looked at the bruises on the girl’s white and tender arms and legs and frowned solemnly. “She hurt both her hands and legs. Give her a good check later, or I will worry.”

Lu Rao really thought that Qiao Mianmian had suffered some serious injuries, so he did not refuse and responded immediately, “Okay, notify me when you reach the hospital. Erm... does she need a stretcher? Can she go by herself?”

Mo Yesi was speechless.

After a few seconds, he gritted his teeth and said coldly, “No need! Bye, I will contact you later.”

They reached the hospital.

After getting off, Qiao Mianmian was picked up by Mo Yesi. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Although it was very romantic to be carried bridal-style, she still said helplessly, “I can walk by myself.”

She was just bruised, not broken.

But the man did not intend to let her go at all and took her straight inside.

She received many stares along the way.

Qiao Mianmian was so embarrassed that she buried her head in his chest again.

Mo Yesi carried her into Lu Rao’s office directly.

“Come, let me see, where are you hurt?” Lu Rao’s face looked exhausted after coming out of the operation room, but when he saw Qiao Mianmian in Mo Yesi’s arms, he still examined her very carefully.

Then, he was dumbfounded.

He blinked and asked Mo Yesi, “Yesi, where is the little girl injured?”

Qiao Mianmian had no obvious wounds.

Was it an internal injury?

Lu Rao thought of this and examined her carefully again, but he found that her complexion was red and rosy, and she did not seem seriously injured at all.

Mo Yesi gently put Qiao Mianmian on the sofa.

Then, he looked up at Lu Rao. “Do you have poor eyesight? She has so many bruises on her body, can’t you see?”

Lu Rao: “???”

He told him that the little girl’s wound was very serious and insisted on making him examine her personally, but it was just a few bruises?!

Lu Rao was not in a good mood.
