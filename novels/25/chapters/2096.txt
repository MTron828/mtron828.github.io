Chapter 2097: I’ll Try My Best to Treat Him Well

Even if she had already acknowledged her biological parents, she had lived with Father Qiao for almost 20 years.

Her feelings for Father Qiao were actually deeper than for her biological parents.

Because of Qiao Anxin, they hadn’t contacted each other for a long time.

Qiao Mianmian had mixed feelings after receiving this call.

She didn’t know if Father Qiao was calling her because of Qiao Anxin.

She didn’t know what she would do if Father Qiao begged her on Qiao Anxin’s behalf again.

“Mm. Come back early the day after tomorrow. Your parents won’t mind, right?” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Qiao Mianmian kept quiet.

She suddenly felt sad.

Father Qiao’s cautious question caused her heartache.

“Dad,” she called softly again, suppressing the bitterness in her eyes. She said softly, “You’re my family too, the closest person to me. If it wasn’t for your upbringing, I wouldn’t be who I am now.

“In my heart, your position will never change.”

Father Qiao kept quiet for a while before saying hoarsely, “Mm, then you, come back early the day after tomorrow. I’ll get Aunt Lin to prepare your favorite dishes. Oh right, bring Mo Yesi back with you. You’re already married, but you didn’t bring him home to have a meal with us. Since you’re my daughter, he’s my son-in-law. Come back the day after tomorrow.”

“Mm, I’ll tell him.”

After a while, Qiao Mianmian hung up.

She hesitated for a while before saying to Mo Yesi, “Dad’s birthday is the day after tomorrow. He just called to ask me to go back for dinner on that day. Do you… have time?”

There were too many scandals in the Qiao family.

Qiao Mianmian was embarrassed by what Lin Huizhen and Qiao Anxin had done.

She had a terrible family.

She didn’t even like it herself, let alone others.

She felt that even if Mo Yesi didn’t want to go, she could understand.

But Mo Yesi didn’t hesitate. “Alright.”

Qiao Mianmian was stunned that he agreed so quickly. “Are you willing to go?”

“If you want to go back, we’ll go back,” Mo Yesi said.

His attitude towards the Qiao family was built on her.

He would value the people she valued.

Otherwise, he would only dislike them even more.

“Mm, I want to go back and take a look.” Qiao Mianmian thought for a while and said, “Dad isn’t in good health, I haven’t seen him in a long time.”

“Then let’s go back.”

Qiao Mianmian looked at him and blinked. “I thought you wouldn’t want to return to the Qiao family with me.”

“Baby, do you want to hear the truth?” Mo Yesi smiled and stroked her hair.

“Mm.”

“To be honest, I really don’t like your adoptive father and your stepmother and stepsister. Because they didn’t take good care of you. When it comes to being parents, they failed.

“You said that your adoptive father treated you well, but I think he’s still biased. If it wasn’t for his favoritism, you wouldn’t have had such a difficult time in the past few years. Based on my temper, I might never have interacted with them in my life.

“But I know you have feelings for your adoptive father. He has indeed raised you. So, I’ll try my best to treat him well. Even if I don’t like him very much, if it’s someone you care about, I’ll try to respect them.”
