Chapter 1051: I’m Happy No matter What I Do With You

Qiao Mianmian finally understood what he was thinking. She smiled and reached out to hold his hand. “Mo Yesi, have you heard of this saying before?”

“What?”

Qiao Mianmian looked at him gently and said word by word, “When you’re with the person you like, everything is sweet and happy. Even if you don’t do or say anything, just being together makes you happy.

“I feel the same way now.

“I’m happy to be with you.”

Seeing the man’s eyes light up, she smiled even more gently. “I’ve never felt bored before. I feel very happy, and I feel especially happy now. So, you don’t have to think about how to make me happy, because you’ve already done it.”

Mo Yesi looked at her deeply. “You really think so?”

“Of course, do I look like I’m lying?” Qiao Mianmian blinked and cheekily smiled. She reached out and pinched his handsome face. “Mr. Mo, please have more confidence in yourself. Do you have so little confidence in your charm?

“Do you know that even without doing anything, just looking at your face makes me happy for the whole day?”

How important was it for a woman to find a good-looking husband!

Even though she was in a terrible mood a moment ago, she felt like she was cured the moment she saw his handsome face.

She felt much better.

And clearly, Mo Yesi himself didn’t realize how handsome and attractive his face was.

If he realized it, he wouldn’t have asked those questions.

Mo Yesi was speechless.

“You have to have a clear understanding of your charm. I’m really happy to be with you.”

Mo Yesi looked into her eyes for a few seconds before smiling. “Alright, I understand now. Let’s go eat first, then watch a movie. If it’s not too late by the time we’re done, we can take a walk somewhere else.”

...

Meanwhile.

In a private restaurant halfway up the mountain.

There was only one table in the entire restaurant.

The lights in the restaurant weren’t turned on, and all the candles were lit.

There was a bouquet of roses in every vase on the table.

The night breeze blew, and the entire restaurant was filled with the faint scent of roses.

On the stage of the restaurant, a professional band was playing a tune on the spot. The melodious and slow music lingered in the air.

The night breeze blew gently.

At the table by the window, a man and a woman were sitting opposite each other. The man was handsome and elegant, while the woman was young and beautiful. They looked like a talented couple.

The waiter served the two steaks the chef had just prepared. “Mr. Mo, Miss Jiang, please enjoy.”

The waiter placed the steak on the table.

Mo Shixiu looked at Jiang Luoli, who hadn’t said anything, and frowned. “Miss Jiang, why aren’t you saying anything? Do you not like it here? Or is there something else you don’t like?”

Didn’t Assistant Xu say that women would definitely like this kind of dating method?

But why did he feel that Miss Jiang didn’t seem to like him?
