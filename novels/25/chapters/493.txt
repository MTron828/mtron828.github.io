Chapter 494: Felt Slightly Like a Cuckold

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“I’ve looked through it, it’s all good. But you’re going to start filming in three days?”

He saw the starting date of the filming.

“Mm.” Qiao Mianmian carefully put it back into her bag carefully and nodded. “We’ll be filming in M City.”

The thought of going to another city to film for a few months got Qiao Mianmian rather excited for the upcoming months.

Mo Yesi went silent for a while. He saw how excited she looked and said, “You seem very happy?”

“Yup.” Qiao Mianmian didn’t realize that he was a little unhappy about it. Her eyes sparkled as she said, “I used to work on set only when they needed me once in a while, but this is the first time I can stay for months.

“And there are so many skillful and experienced seniors around, I’ll have so much to learn from them. Director Bai is such a talented and capable person, I’m so lucky to be able to be in his show.”

Seeing the look of admiration on her face as she talked about Bai Yusheng, Mo Yesi pursed his lips and tried to keep his cool.

Bai Yusheng was a very capable person in her eyes.

He was the youngest Chairman in the history of the Mo Corporation. He managed to gain the respect of those whom even his father had failed to.

Everyone in the office was respectful and afraid of him.

And others in the industry also knew that he was a genius businessman.

But the little woman with him...

Didn’t seem to realize how good her husband was. She didn’t seem to admire him.

She was full of praises for other men, right in front of him.

What did she take him for?

“Oh, and I saw the male lead Tu Yilei just now. He’s so approachable and isn’t proud at all. You know, he’s the most popular idol among young girls now, and he’s super nice! I was the one who bumped into him, but he apologized to me and asked if I was alright.

“No wonder he has so many female fans. He’s really a male celebrity with an amazing aura.”

Qiao Mianmian was going on about it and only just realized that Mo Yesi wasn’t responding.

She looked up and met his cold gaze.

He was expressionless.

“Mo Yesi, w-what’s wrong?”

Qiao Mianmian finally realized that the man beside her wasn’t happy.

But she didn’t know why.

Did she say anything wrong?

She went through what she’d just said and still didn’t find anything wrong with it.

“Who’s Tu Yilei?”

The atmosphere in the car tensed up. Mo Yesi only asked it after a full minute of silence.

So, Bai Yusheng wasn’t all. Now there was another Tu Yilei.

Why were there so many men around her?

Her eyes were practically sparkling when she talked about Tu Yilei. She was full of praises for him.

It seemed like she really had a good impression of this man.

He felt an unprecedented sense of threat and crisis.

He even felt slightly like a cuckold.

And all of a sudden, he recalled a search result online: If you can’t satisfy your woman, she’ll look for other men for it.
