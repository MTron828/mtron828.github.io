Chapter 2967: Her Love

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

He had always known that his wife was beautiful, but at this moment, he was still stunned.

Wearing a wedding dress, she was so beautiful that she didn’t look like a real person. She looked like a fairy that had accidentally fallen into the mortal world.

Mo Yesi looked at her blankly and couldn’t say a word.

As if any words were unnecessary.

“Mrs. Mo, Mr. Mo is stunned.” The two shop assistants saw Mo Yesi’s reaction and chuckled. “We knew that Mr. Mo would be stunned by you.”

They felt that Mo Yesi’s reaction was too normal.

After all, even they felt that Qiao Mianmian was as beautiful as a fairy. Even women like them were attracted to her, let alone men.

Qiao Mianmian was a little embarrassed to be stared at by Mo Yesi.

She pursed her lips and walked towards him. “What do you think? Is it nice?”

The man’s Adam’s apple bobbed a few times. Hearing her voice, he came back to his senses. The shock in his eyes hadn’t completely dissipated, and his voice was a little hoarse. “Mm, it’s nice.”

She was much prettier than he’d imagined.

“I think it’s beautiful, too.” Qiao Mianmian was generous with her praises. “I especially like this wedding dress. When our wedding is over, I’ll treasure it and pass it to our daughter in the future.”

“This is a good idea, I support it.” Mo Yesi got up and held her hand. “If it’s a son, he can keep it too. Let him give it to your future daughter-in-law.”

“Theard them say that you designed this wedding dress. Is this true?” Qiao Mianmian recalled Mo Yesi’s alternate account and asked for confirmation.

“Mm.” Mo Yesi admitted it. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“You know how to design wedding dresses?” Qiao Mianmian felt that although this man was her husband, she didn’t know him well enough. She was very curious. “Have you learned fashion design before? When did you learn it?”

“Llearned a little in university.” Mo Yesi smiled. “Just like jewelry design, it’s just a hobby. After I graduated, I slowly took over the Mo Corporation and rarely touched these hobbies anymore.

“So, I was a little worried before designing this wedding dress.”

“What were you worried about?”

“was worried that you wouldn’t like it.” The usually confident man would only lose his confidence in front of the woman he loved. “But you just told me that you like it, so I’m at ease.”

“Then, why didn’t you tell me about this before?” She actually found out about this from someone else.

“Lwanted it to be a surprise.” Mo Yesi’s eyes were gentle. “I wonder if you liked this surprise.”

“Yes, of course.” Qiao Mianmian’s eyes sparkled. “Mo Yesi, I really, really like this surprise, and I really cherish it. Thank you for everything you’ve done for me.”

Mo Yesi felt that everything was worth it.

All he did was say for her to say that she liked it.

Mo Yesi had prepared more than just a wedding dress for her.

Qiao Mianmian opened the exquisite box under the man’s expectant gaze. Seeing the sparkling set of diamond jewelry in the box, she looked at him.. “This set of jewelry... was also designed by you?”
