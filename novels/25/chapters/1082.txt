Chapter 1083: She Was Still Dreaming

Mo Shixiu looked at a certain person who was pushing her luck. He took a deep breath and asked the driver in the front row in a tolerant tone, “Uncle Shen, how long till we get home?”

The driver immediately replied, “Sir, about ten minutes.”

Mo Shixiu’s face was full of forbearance. He took another deep breath. “Drive faster.” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

...

Six minutes later.

Sister Lin waited outside the building.

The car had just stopped when Sister Lin saw Mo Shixiu carrying a woman out of the car.

Sister Lin was shocked. When she saw who was in Mo Shixiu’s arms, she was shocked again.

An hour ago, Mister called and told her to prepare a hangover soup in advance.

So, when she saw Mister carrying a woman out of the car, she was shocked.

I thought Mister had brought back another woman.

Unexpectedly, the person Mister brought back was Miss Jiang.

But didn’t Miss Jiang say that she and Mister weren’t together?

And now...

Sister Lin had a lot of questions in her heart, but she knew that now was not the time to ask.

“Mister, is Miss Jiang drunk?” Sister Lin looked at Jiang Luoli in Mo Shixiu’s arms. The girl seemed to be asleep, her eyes closed.

Mo Shixiu nodded. “Is the hangover soup ready?”

Jiang Luoli kicked up a fuss all the way. When she was about to reach home, she finally stopped and fell asleep.

“It’s done. It’s still warm.” Sister Lin followed Mo Shixiu into the hall and immediately called a maid over. She instructed, “Quickly get the hangover soup from the kitchen and bring it to Mister’s room.”

Mo Shixiu was about to carry Jiang Luoli upstairs when he stopped. He turned around and frowned at Sister Lin. “Send the hangover soup to Miss Jiang’s room.”

Sister Lin paused for a second and understood what he meant. “Yes, I was wrong just now. It should be sent to Miss Jiang’s room.”

Mo Shixiu didn’t say anything else and carried the asleep Jiang Luoli upstairs.

...

Mo Shixiu walked very quickly.

The girl in his arms had a soft body, and a faint fragrance wafted into his nose from time to time.

This was the first time he was so intimate with a girl when he was sober.

Other than not being used to it, a strange feeling also lingered in his heart.

He carried her to her room.

After placing her gently on the bed, he was about to turn around when his arm was held back.

He froze and looked down.

The girl, who had been sleeping with her eyes closed a second ago, had already opened her eyes and was staring at him with misty eyes.

Mo Shixiu didn’t expect her to wake up so soon.

After looking at each other for a while, his tone softened like he was coaxing a child. “You’re awake. Does your head still hurt? I’ll get you some hangover soup. You’ll feel much better after drinking it.”

With that said, he gently pulled his arm.

Jiang Luoli had no intention of letting go. She had just woken up and was still drunk. She didn’t know if she was still dreaming.

She looked at the handsome face of the man in front of her with undisguised desire in her eyes.

Hmm, this man was so handsome.

She was indeed still dreaming.

So, since she was dreaming, she could do whatever she wanted in her dream.

Thinking of this, Jiang Luoli reached out to the man she had been coveting for a long time. Under Mo Shixiu’s surprised gaze, she grabbed his collar and pulled him onto the bed forcefully.
