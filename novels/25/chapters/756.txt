Chapter 757: What’s Going on Between You and Your Mom?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Don’t be upset about this anymore.” He thought for a while and looked at the eye-catching red marks on her neck. This time, he seriously suggested, “Is there any cosmetics that can cover it? If not, you can directly go to the set and get on with the shooting first. I’ll handle it for you later.

“I should be able to get rid of it.”

Qiao Mianmian thought about it and nodded helplessly. “I’ll try.”

The marks couldn’t be removed.

This was the only way.

She decided to use the concealer to cover them up. If it didn’t work, she’d have to let the post-production deal with it.

In fact, she could get rid of these traces later on.

She wasn’t angry because she was worried that it would affect her acting. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

She just didn’t want to go to the set with these hickeys.

She felt that it was embarrassing to let others see them. If that was the case, wouldn’t the whole crew know what she did last night?

It was so embarrassing!

Qiao Mianmian only left after half an hour.

She applied a thick layer of concealer on her neck and then let her hair down.

Almost all the hickeys were covered.

As long as he didn’t look at her neck carefully, he wouldn’t be able to tell.

After breakfast, Mo Yesi sent her to the set.

His cell phone rang when he stopped at a red light junction.

It was placed beside the car seat. When the screen lit up, Qiao Mianmian glanced at it and saw that it was a call from Old Madam.

Mo Yesi saw that it was Old Madam calling and immediately picked it up. He smiled and greeted. “Grandma.”

Old Madam asked smilingly, “Ah Si, are you busy?”

“No.” Mo Yesi turned to look at Qiao Mianmian and reached out to hold her hand. “I’m with Mianmian now. I’m sending her to the set for filming.”

On the other end, Old Madam was silent for a few seconds before smiling and saying, “Oh, is that so? You’re still in F City? When do you plan to go back? Is it alright to leave the company for so long?”

“I won’t be around for just a day or two, what problem could there be? I’ve already explained what I needed to. Grandma, don’t worry, I know what to do. I’ll go back once I’ve settled everything here.”

“Mm, it’s good that you know what you’re doing. You’ve been sensible since you were a child, there’s nothing to worry about. Grandma is at ease with you doing things.”

Mo Yesi knew that Old Madam didn’t call to ask him about this.

He didn’t have a good time with Madam Mo yesterday.

Old Madam called today.

She probably called because of Madam Mo.

After thinking for a while, he said, “Grandma, you didn’t call me just to ask me this, right? Is there something else?”

Old Madam was a straightforward person and didn’t beat around the bush. “What’s going on between you and your mom? Why did you block her phone? She even cried when she told me about it yesterday.

“How did it get so serious?”

Mo Yesi pursed his lips and said after a moment of silence, “It’s nothing serious. You know her personality. She’s just spoiled by Dad. Did she look for you? What did she say to you?”

“Yes, your mom came to look for me.” Old Madam sighed. “She cried her heart out. She said that you’re all grown up now and she can’t control you anymore and that you don’t take her seriously anymore.”
