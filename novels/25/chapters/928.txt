Chapter 929: Thank You, Mo Yesi

“Of course.” Mo Yesi sighed as he hugged her. “No matter how much I dislike that brat, he’s still your benefactor. Moreover, if you continue to owe him, you’ll always think of him. I don’t want my wife to think of another man.

“In any case, you don’t have to worry about this anymore. I promise that his work won’t be affected. Do you feel better now?”

“Mm.”

Qiao Mianmian nodded and smiled.

To her, letting Tu Yilei get hurt for her was already letting him down.

If this incident affected his career, she would feel guilty for the rest of her life.

She had to admit that Mo Yesi’s promise made her feel less guilty.

She finally felt better.

She knew that he had the ability.

As long as he promised, he would definitely do it.

He was Mo Yesi.

The youngest Chairman in the history of the Mo Corporation.

The person who controlled the entire economy of Country A.

His promises were never empty checks.

Qiao Mianmian looked up at his handsome face and couldn’t suppress the sweetness and warmth in her heart. She hesitated for a while and took the initiative to kiss him. “Mo Yesi, thank you.”

Her life had been smooth-sailing ever since she married him.

Because even if things didn’t go well, he would quickly settle them for her.

She used to settle everything by herself.

She didn’t know how it felt to rely on someone.

But now, she had a family, a husband, and someone she could rely on.

She wasn’t going to bear everything alone.

No matter what happened now, she knew that she wouldn’t face it alone. This man who had already become her husband would help her settle everything.

How lucky was she to have met Mo Yesi?

This man was too good.

God was too kind to send such a good man to her.

She would definitely cherish him.

The man was obviously not very satisfied with her light kiss. She had just moved away when he pulled her back.

He placed his hand on the back of her head and lowered his handsome face. He gently touched the corner of her lips and said in a low voice, “You’re thanking me just to dismiss me, mm?”

Qiao Mianmian blinked and gulped. “Then, what else do you want?”

Mo Yesi pretended to think for a while and whispered, “At least call me Hubby.

“Baby, I want to hear you call me Hubby.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

“This isn’t hard for you, right? Call me Hubby?”

Qiao Mianmian looked at the man’s handsome face and couldn’t help but blush. She bit her lip and hesitated for a while before saying softly, “Hubby.”

Mo Yesi’s eyes narrowed. “Call me that again.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

“Be good, call me again.”

Thinking about his good performance today, Qiao Mianmian agreed to whatever he asked for. “Hubby.”

Her voice was soft and sweet.

She usually spoke softly and sweetly, and the way she addressed him was so sweet.Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Mo Yesi’s heart melted.
