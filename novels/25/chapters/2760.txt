Chapter 2762: This Couple’s Relationship Is Really Good

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

The number of viewers decreased when Qiao Mianmian was sleeping.

But the number increased again when she woke up.

The live stream was very lively.

“Wow, Chairman Mo dotes on Qiao Mianmian too much. Did you see that scene just now? In order to let Qiao Mianmian sleep a little more, he got off the car and waited outside, not allowing the crew members to wake her. This is too sweet. Old Aunt’s maiden heart is about to burst out.”

“I feel like Qiao Mianmian is Chairman Mo’s little princess. Chairman Mo really pampers her!” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“It’s another sour lemon day.”

“Am I the only one who feels that Mo Yesi’s actions are very selfish? Qiao Mianmian is considered to be working, right? Just because he wants her to sleep for a few more hours, he wants the crew members to keep waiting? Why should they sacrifice their working hours to accommodate the couple’s public display of affection? If everyone is like Qiao Mianmian, will this episode still be recorded?”

“Girls, pay attention. The haters are here again. Ignore her. Just treat her as air and let her hop around alone.”

…

The production crew arranged for them to stay in a high-class district.

After entering the district, Mo Yesi looked at the environment and facilities and was satisfied.

In his opinion, although this neighborhood wasn’t very good, it wasn’t too bad.

At least, it seemed safer.

It wasn’t like the remote mountain village Qiao Mianmian went to previously.

If the production crew arranged for Qiao Mianmian to go there again, Mo Yesi would definitely not allow her to.

Even if Qiao Mianmian had something against him, he would never let her face such danger again.

Other workers came out to pick them up when they reached the district.

The production crew rented a floor and made up a room number for the guests.

The staff brought them to their accommodation.

Qiao Mianmian realized that she was the first to arrive.

This episode was the same as when she participated in “The Meaning of Traveling”. They both had a host.

The emcee was called Li Wei, and he was usually called Brother Li.

Li Wei was a very approachable person. Moreover, he was a very famous variety show host at Tomato TV Station. He was a big brother in the industry.

Having been in the industry for so many years, he was considered experienced and knowledgeable.

He was a very stable person.

But even such a big brother couldn’t remain calm after seeing Mo Yesi.

He was actually nervous like the other crew members.

“Did Mr. Mo accompany Miss Qiao? Why didn’t he tell us beforehand? It’s not good for us to entertain Chairman Mo now…” Li Wei looked at the handsome man in front of him. He wasn’t as calm as before, and there was obvious nervousness on his face.

He didn’t know that Mo Yesi would send Qiao Mianmian over.

Hence, he was rather shocked to see him.

Of course, he had heard how Chairman Mo pampered his wife.

But he didn’t expect him to be so worried about his wife that he would personally escort her.

This couple was really close.

But to be honest, this Chairman Mo was really a dragon among men. His looks and temperament were top-notch. His noble aura wasn’t something ordinary people could compare to.

With his looks, he would definitely be popular if he made his debut in the entertainment industry..
