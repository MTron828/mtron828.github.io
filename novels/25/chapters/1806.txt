She realized that there were a lot of pickled vegetables in a jar in the kitchen. She scooped some and started eating the porridge.

When she was done making the last pumpkin pie, she heard Zhan Bo and Su Mufei’s voices coming from outside the kitchen. “Wow, is someone cooking? It smells so good.”

“No way. Didn’t Brother Zhao say that no one would cook for us? We have to do it ourselves.”

“We’ll know when we go inside.”

Soon, Zhan Bo, Su Mufei, and Ren Jun entered the kitchen.

When they saw Qiao Mianmian standing in front of the stove with a spatula in her hand, their eyes widened in shock.

Zhan Bo looked at the dishes and was shocked. “Qiao Mianmian, these... were made by you?”

Qiao Mianmian put down the spatula and hooked her finger at him. “Who else? Have you washed up? Help me bring these dishes out? The breakfast is simple, but if you don’t mind, then let’s eat together. If you have other plans, then pretend I didn’t say anything.”

“No arrangement, no arrangement.” Su Mufei walked over and looked at the dishes. He gulped and said, “Qiao Mianmian, you’re too awesome. You actually made breakfast. You can actually cook?

“These dishes look so good. Where did you get them?” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Qiao Mianmian smiled. “Isn’t there a small vegetable garden in the courtyard? I picked some vegetables there. These are all unprocessed vegetables, better than the ones in the city.”

Su Mufei gave her a thumbs up.

“You made this, too? It looks delicious. What is it?”

“Pumpkin.”

“You know how to make pumpkin pie?” Su Mufei looked at her in admiration. “Qiao Mianmian, you’re too amazing. I really admire you.”

Su Mufei thought to himself, How can such a beautiful lady who can cook exist?

She was his ideal partner.

But he also knew that she had a boyfriend, so he stopped thinking about it.

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

She was embarrassed by his praise. “They’re all very simple dishes. Most people know how to make them.”

“Who said so? I don’t know how to do it.” Su Mufei wasn’t stingy with his praise. “Many of the girls I know don’t know how to do it, either.”

“Alright, alright. Stop flattering her.” Zhan Bo went forward and patted his shoulder. “Let’s bring these dishes out. Sister Fei and the rest should be up, too.”

...

The few of them carried the food out and just laid it on the table when they saw Song Ke and Little Xiao walk over.

Song Ke yawned and complained. “The bed is so hard, it’s not comfortable at all. My back hurts after sleeping on it for the whole night.”

“I didn’t sleep last night.” Little Xiao looked listless, with dark circles around her eyes. “I only slept for a while when it was almost dawn. The alarm clock rang so soon.”

“Me, too.” Song Ke mumbled unhappily. “I couldn’t sleep at all. I’m so sleepy. Anxin, what about you?”

Qiao Anxin seemed to be on good terms with them.

They all knew that she and Qiao Mianmian weren’t on good terms.

They had a conflict before.
