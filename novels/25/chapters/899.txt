Chapter 900: It Should Be Wheatgrass

Qiao Mianmian raised her brows in surprise. “You want to cook for me?”

“Mm.”

“You... know how to do it?”

Mo Yesi kept quiet for a while before saying, “It shouldn’t be a problem after looking at the recipe.”

He could learn anything easily.

It was just cooking.

He felt that such a simple matter wasn’t difficult for him.

It was just following the recipe, he definitely knew how to do it.

“Are you sure?” Qiao Mianmian didn’t trust him.

How could someone who had never cooked before be able to do so?

Although he had boiled brown sugar water for her once and it tasted good, it wasn’t difficult at all.

Anyone could do it. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

A dish like sweet and sour spare ribs might seem simple, but it was still difficult to cook.

She herself... wasn’t confident that she could cook it well.

Mo Yesi looked confident. “I’m sure. Do you have anything else you want to eat? Tell me, I’ll make it for you.”

...

Ten minutes later.

Mo Yesi parked the car in the underground garage of a large mall.

They got out of the car and took the elevator to the shopping area upstairs.

After getting the shopping cart, Qiao Mianmian followed Mo Yesi and chatted with him while looking at the goods on the shelf. “Mo Yesi, have you shopped in the supermarket like this before?”

“No.”

The mall was usually crowded.

Especially in the shopping district, most of them were older people.

Young people like them were rare.

Even though Qiao Mianmian was wearing a mask, he could still tell that she was very pretty. Mo Yesi’s handsome face without a mask was even more eye-catching. Even the aunties around him couldn’t help but take a few glances at him.

Mo Yesi wasn’t used to walking around in a crowd, especially with a group of aunties and uncles around him. He pushed the cart to the place where the vegetables were sold and casually took a look. He didn’t know what dishes were placed there, so he took a bundle and placed it in the cart.

Qiao Mianmian looked at the leeks in the shopping cart and casually asked, “What are you doing with this?”

“Mm?” Mo Yesi looked down at the food he’d just picked up. After a few seconds of silence, he thought of a reason. “I think this bag of food looks good. It’s green. Eating more green food is good for your body.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

She seriously suspected that Mo Yesi had no idea what vegetable he was holding.

She couldn’t help but ask, “Do you know what this vegetable is?”

Mo Yesi pursed his lips and kept quiet for a few seconds before raising an eyebrow. “It should be wheatgrass. But I only know that you can eat wheat. Can you eat wheatgrass now? Have you eaten this before, how does it taste?”

Qiao Mianmian was confused.

She widened her eyes slowly and looked at him in disbelief. After confirming that he wasn’t joking, she almost burst out laughing. “Mo Yesi, say it again. What’s this?”

Mo Yesi realized that he might have said something wrong.

He kept quiet for a longer time.

“Isn’t it wheatgrass? What’s that?” This was the first time he had encountered a problem since he was young and had won scholarships every year.

He... didn’t seem to recognize this bundle.

It looked just like wheatgrass.

But it wasn’t?

What was that?

Qiao Mianmian was about to burst out laughing.
