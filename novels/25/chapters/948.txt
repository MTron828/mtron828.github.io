Chapter 949: The Comment Section Was About to Explode

He wasn’t trying to rest.

It was just an excuse.

Once this trending topic was released, Tu Yilei’s fans and the public quickly followed it.

They all asked him where he was injured.

Especially Tu Yilei’s fans. When they heard that their idol was injured, they were all anxious and left comments in the comment section. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

The “insider” didn’t reply to anyone. Instead, he posted another very popular post.

People in the industry: A lot of people are asking me where Tu Yilei got hurt and how he got injured, so I won’t reply to you one by one. I’ll just tell you the truth. It’s like this. I’m sure everyone knows that Huang Yilin fell because of the negative news. I heard that the sugar daddy behind the newbie was the one who exposed the negative news. Huang Yilin knows about this too, so she went to look for the newbie on set. She probably felt that she was already done and didn’t want the newbie to have a good time, so she brought a bottle of sulfuric acid with her. The sulfuric acid was meant to be splashed on the newbie, but when Tu Yilei was with the newbie, he saved the damsel in distress. But you don’t have to worry too much. I heard that the sulfuric acid was splashed on his hand and isn’t so serious. He’s fine. I guess he can recover in about a year.

This post caused a huge sensation.

The comment section was about to explode.

The fans went crazy.

Brother Tu’s Little Fairy: Our brother has to leave the industry for a year because he blocked the acid meant for Qiao Mianmian? Gosh, did Brother’s hand get hurt by the acid? Isn’t it serious? Brother’s beautiful hand was destroyed just like that?! Blogger, are you serious? Don’t scare us.

Passerby: If this blogger isn’t making things up, Tu Yilei’s behavior is quite manly. It’s always been a passerby. If this is true, I might become a passerby.

Love Me: Sulfuric acid on the hand? Sulfuric acid is so corrosive, I really can’t imagine how serious the injury on my brother’s hand is. Gosh, blogger, you’re not scaring us, right? Is what you said true? My brother is really injured? Is my brother in the hospital now? Which hospital is he in? I want to go and see him, my heart aches so much.

Natural Dumbness: I knew it. Why did Brother suddenly go overseas to study? Even if he wanted to go overseas to study, he shouldn’t have chosen this time. I didn’t expect the truth to be like this. Huang Yilin is too scary. She actually brought sulfuric acid to the set. Is Brother a fool? He actually helped to block the sulfuric acid. What if it had splashed on his face? His life would have been ruined.

Love Brother Tu for Life: That woman Qiao Mianmian is really detestable. Brother got injured because of her. She’s simply a jinx. She should be the one getting hurt, why is Brother the one getting hurt? Previously, she deliberately posted a video to ride on Brother’s popularity, and this time, she implicated Brother and caused him so much harm. I hate this woman.

Bitch Qiao suddenly died: This slut caused my brother to be splashed with sulfuric acid. I really want to splash her with sulfuric acid too. If it wasn’t for this slut, my brother wouldn’t have been injured, and he wouldn’t have to leave the industry for a year. My brother’s career is developing so well now, if he suddenly leaves the industry, it’ll affect him so much.
