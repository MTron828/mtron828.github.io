Chapter 2487: Can You Promise Me Something?

Mo Yesi carried her to the coffee table and gently placed her on the soft sofa. Then, he bent down and rubbed her head again. “Eat these first, don’t think about those annoying things. Don’t worry. No matter what happens, I’ll settle it for you.

“With me around, no one can hurt you.”

Qiao Mianmian trusted Mo Yesi’s abilities.

This wasn’t the first time she’d been defamed.

Hence, she wasn’t flustered at all.

She knew that this matter would be resolved eventually.

And this time, she intended to settle it personally.

With that, Mo Yesi picked up a cup of milk tea from the coffee table, inserted the straw, and handed it to her. “Don’t you like milk tea the most? I got Secretary Li to get you a big cup.”

Mo Yesi usually didn’t allow her to drink milk tea.

He felt that it wasn’t good for her health.

He must have seen that she was in a bad mood today. Thus, not only did he take the initiative to buy it for her, but he even bought a huge cup.

The milk tea was still steaming in Qiao Mianmian’s hands.

This was from her favorite milk tea shop, and Mo Yesi had ordered it for her.

She took a big gulp. The smoothness and sweetness in her mouth made her happy.

This moment was so satisfying…

“Does it taste good?” Mo Yesi smiled when he saw her happy eyes.

It seemed so easy to make her happy.

A cup of milk tea and some dessert could make her so happy.

“Mm, it’s good.” Qiao Mianmian smiled. “How did you know I like this milk tea?”

Mo Yesi smiled and rubbed her head. He slowly sat down beside her and put his arm around her shoulders. “I know all your hobbies.” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“Is that so?” Qiao Mianmian took another sip of milk tea.

It had to be said that desserts could make one happy.

She felt much better.

She felt like she was cured by a cup of milk tea.

“Of course, there’s no need to doubt it.” He knew more about her preferences than she did.

“This milk tea is really good. Do you want some?” Qiao Mianmian took another sip and brought the straw to his mouth, blinking and looking at him expectantly.

Mo Yesi was speechless.

He didn’t like desserts.

He also didn’t like milk tea.

But…

He couldn’t bring himself to reject her.

Sigh, forget it. Just a sip.

He wouldn’t die if he took a sip.

He took a sip of milk tea.

The moment the milk tea entered his mouth, he frowned.

How could so many people like this sweet instant drink?

Mo Yesi swallowed the milk tea with difficulty.

Just as Qiao Mianmian was about to persuade him to take another sip, he rejected her firmly. “Baby, I’m not drinking anymore. Drink it slowly.”

Qiao Mianmian saw his reaction and didn’t ask if it was good.

It was indeed impossible to have the same taste.

She didn’t force Mo Yesi to drink anymore.

“Mo Yesi, can you promise me something?” Qiao Mianmian suddenly thought of something after drinking half the cup of milk tea.
