Chapter 1788: I Can Only Live in Your Room

This time, she was going to stay for a month, so she brought a lot of things. The huge box was full.

She had just taken out some daily necessities, including her skincare products, makeup, toothbrush, and mouthwash.

She even brought two sets of bed accessories.

Although the production crew bought them new ones, Qiao Mianmian was used to using her own. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

The door was ajar.

Song Ke stood outside seeing the decorations.

When she saw that Qiao Mianmian’s room actually had a refrigerator and television, jealousy appeared on her face again. She hated that the lucky person wasn’t her.

She didn’t know it until she compared it to Qiao Mianmian’s room.

Although it looked old and shabby, Qiao Mianmian’s room was obviously much better.

Not only was it bigger than her room, but it also had more furniture.

If she lived in such a room, she could still tolerate it for a month.

Song Ke stood outside for a while. Seeing that Qiao Mianmian was still unpacking her luggage, she knocked on the door.

Qiao Mianmian looked up.

Seeing Song Ke standing at the door, she frowned and continued unpacking.

Qiao Mianmian had thought about it before coming.

It would be best if she could make a few more friends in the show.

If she couldn’t, she wouldn’t deliberately curry favor with anyone. They could just maintain a superficial relationship.

Qiao Mianmian treated Song Ke the same way.

“Hello, Qiao Mianmian.” Song Mianmian frowned when she saw that Qiao Mianmian was ignoring her. She walked into the room with a dark expression and stood in front of her. “Don’t rush to unpack, I have something to discuss with you.”

Qiao Mianmian took out some things from the luggage and placed them on the cabinet before slowly turning to look at her. “What is it?”

Song Ke saw the cameras everywhere in the room and restrained her expression. “Let’s exchange rooms. What do you say?”

Qiao Mianmian was stunned.

She looked at Song Ke’s confident expression and found it funny. “Exchange rooms? What do you mean? You mean you stay here while I stay in your room?”

“That’s right.” Song Ke didn’t think her request was overboard at all. She raised her chin and said, “Let’s exchange rooms.”

“Is this the show’s intention?” Qiao Mianmian asked.

“No, but Brother Zhao told me that I can come and exchange rooms with you.” Song Ke deliberately misinterpreted Zhao Yuan’s words.

He said that she could negotiate with someone else.

But whether they wanted to do it or not depended on whether they were willing.

But when Song Ke said that, it became Zhao Yuan allowing her to exchange rooms with Qiao Mianmian.

Qiao Mianmian wasn’t stupid. She didn’t believe that Zhao Yuan would make such an arrangement.

She stared at Song Ke for a while before smiling. “Miss Song, Brother Zhao asked you to look for me, but he didn’t say that I have to exchange rooms with you, right? Isn’t it decided by drawing lots?”

Song Ke’s expression stiffened, but she quickly put on a self-righteous expression. “My body is weak, so I have to stay in a room full of sunlight. Your room has the most sunlight, so I can only stay in your room.

“We’re in the same team, it’s only right to help each other. It’s just a change of rooms, you can’t be so petty as to refuse.”
