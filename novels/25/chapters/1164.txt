Chapter 1167: I Want to Prove This

Although the Old Madam was silent, she was already on Qiao Chen’s side. If Madam Mo made Qiao Chen suffer, she would definitely not let it go.

“I remember that your name is Qiao Chen? Why are you so rude? Why are you interrupting when I’m talking to your sister? What do you mean by the new era and the old era? No matter which era it is, it’s always the man going outside while the woman goes inside. This is the rule of our Mo family. After my mother and I got married, we stayed at home to educate our children. Why can’t it be done when it comes to your sister’s generation?”

“She’s just a girl. Why does she have to show her face in public all the time? So what if those rumors are fake? If they spread too much, people will think they’re real. Isn’t that unfair to Ah Si? Won’t it affect our Mo family’s reputation?” Madam Mo couldn’t take it lying down after being rebutted by a junior like Qiao Chen. Her face darkened as she reprimanded him coldly.

She had just finished reprimanding Qiao Chen when the Old Madam reprimanded her. “Why are you being so fierce with Chen Chen? As an elder, can’t you speak nicely to a junior? Moreover, Chen Chen is right. Acting is Mianmian’s hobby and dream. We can’t let her give up just because she married Ah Si. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“As for those rumors, I’ve never believed them. What do you mean there’s no smoke without fire? Those reporters talked about the dead in order to gain attention. Is what they said true? All those years, they kept saying that Yun Chen had a mistress and would divorce you. Are you divorced now?”

Madam Mo’s face turned pale. “Mom...”

“Alright, I think you should go back to your room. Why do you have to make things difficult for yourself? Why are you telling me about Mianmian and Ah Si’s public matter? Whether they choose to publicize it or not, it’s up to the couple to decide. We’ll just live our lives as elders. Don’t interfere with the younger generation’s matters. As long as they don’t do anything illegal, you don’t have to care.

“You worry so much that you grow old quickly. Do you understand? Look at the fine wrinkles on your eyes. You worry too much.”

Madam Mo’s lips twitched, and her face turned even paler.

Her first reaction was to touch her eyes. She even wanted to take a look at herself in the mirror.

Women were afraid of aging.

A beauty like Madam Mo was even more afraid.

Hence, she paid special attention to maintaining herself.

Now that she heard the old lady say that there were fine wrinkles around her eyes, she looked like she had suffered a huge blow.

After the Old Madam reprimanded her, she ignored her and turned to look at Qiao Mianmian and Qiao Chen. Her voice became gentle again. “Mianmian, go take a walk in the garden with Ah Si later to digest your food. Chen Chen can accompany me. Don’t be a third wheel for your sister and brother-in-law.”

After the Old Madam found out from Mo Yesi that Qiao Chen might be from the Mo family, she could not calm down.

She was eager to confirm this matter.

She still had something to ask Qiao Chen privately.

Madam Mo looked at the Old Madam’s attitude towards Qiao Chen and didn’t think about anything else. She only felt that Qiao Chen was just as scheming as Qiao Mianmian and had managed to make the Old Madam happy.

Just because the Old Madam had said that she had fine wrinkles, she no longer had any thoughts about it. She only immediately wanted to go for a full set of skincare.

...

After dinner.

Madam Mo made an appointment with the beautician and left in a hurry.

Mo Yesi took Qiao Mianmian for a walk in the garden.
