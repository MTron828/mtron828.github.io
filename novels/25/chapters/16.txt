He lowered his head and frowned at her. “What?”

She bit the corners of her lips and stayed silent for a while as if she was thinking about something. After a while, she talked to him in a consultative tone. “Can we not disclose the matter of our marriage?”

Immediately after speaking, she felt the air pressure around the man drop again.

Qiao Mianmian swallowed and did not dare look up at him.

“Chen Chen doesn’t know that I have broken up with my ex-boyfriend. If I told him that I was married to you, he would be shocked.”

In fact, this was only one consideration.

On the other hand, Qiao Mianmian felt that her marriage with Mo Yesi would definitely not last.

He may be passionate now, but he might find it boring after a while and divorce her.

She wouldn’t care if someone else knew she was married.

But Qiao Chen...

This was the person she cared about the most.

She was young and her thoughts couldn’t be concealed. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Mo Yesi immediately guessed what she was thinking.

A gloomy color covered the man’s handsome face and cold air was released from his body. “You mean, you want to keep our marriage a secret?”

He was Mo Yesi, he had never been ignored like this before.

When other women had even a little bit of relationship with him, they couldn’t wait to declare it to the world.

But this woman...

Was she so afraid that others would know about their relationship?

Did she still love her ex-fiancé?

Thinking of this, Mo Yesi’s expression became more gloomy, and his eyes were so cold that a layer of ice was about to condense.

“I...” Qiao Mianmian faced his gloomy eyes and was scared speechless.

“Qiao Mianmian.”

The man’s slender fingers pinched her jaw, his eyes cold and sharp as he said, “You are my woman. In the future, you can only think of me alone. I have no intention of divorcing you, not now, not ever.”

His fingers tightened slightly, his voice overbearing. “You must not have such thoughts either, do you hear me?”

His eyes were full of possessiveness.

His gaze was like that of a hunter locking eyes on a prey.

This prey belonged to him alone.

No one was allowed to even take half.

Qiao Mianmian was a little scared.

This was the first time she met a man as aggressive and powerful as him.

He seemed ready to devour her at any time.

They walked to the ward.

Qiao Mianmian was still a little hesitant, but Mo Yesi had already reached out and pushed open the door, taking her directly into it.

Qiao Chen was reading a book.

He heard the sound and looked up.

Qian Chen’s eyes widened when he saw his sister coming in with a tall, handsome, and elegant man, who held her by the waist. The book in his hands fell to the ground.

He gaped. “Sister, you...”

Qiao Chen had also grown up with Su Ze and Qiao Mianmian.

The three had a good relationship.

So when he was very young, Qiao Chen had already known that his sister was going to marry Brother Su in the future.

Su Ze has always been good to him, and Qiao Chen was very satisfied with this future brother-in-law.

In his mind, Su Ze was already his brother-in-law.

Suddenly seeing another man and Qiao Mianmian being so close, Qiao Chen couldn’t believe his eyes.

“He, who is he? Sister, you...”

“Chen Chen, he...”

While Qiao Mianmian was still hesitant about how to introduce him, Mo Yesi took her to the bed, looked down at the shocked Qiao Chen, and said directly, “I am your brother-in-law.”
