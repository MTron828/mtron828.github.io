Chapter 537: She Pretty Much Figured Out What Was Going On

“The film set isn’t that far from Yuncheng City. You can come and visit me.” Qiao Mianmian said, “I’ll cover your airfare, your food, accommodation and all. How’s that?”

“You said it.” Jiang Luoli grinned. “Alright, then. I won’t stand on ceremony. Anyway, your allowance is more than enough to cover for it, and you have no idea how to spend it. Let me help you with it, then.”

“Aye. Baby, now I know why Prince Charming made you exercise with him for so many hours in his office. If I were him, I’d have trouble controlling myself too,” Jiang Luoli said as she embraced Qiao Mianmian.

Her Baby’s body was really of premium grade.

She was soft and cooling and smelt so good. It was nice to hold her close.

She was probably the sort of beauty often portrayed in books.

What was most important was that her Baby was slim, but had substance in her chest area.

Jiang Luoli already felt like holding her close and loving her, even as a woman.

Not to mention men.

Any man would find it hard to control themselves in the face of such a rare and precious gem.

Unless they were gay.

Qiao Mianmian went into a coughing fit. Her face and neck went red as she pushed Jiang Luoli away. “H-How did you...”

She hadn’t told Jiang Luoli about that!

“How do I know?” Jiang Luoli looked at her oddly. “Didn’t you tell me?”

Qiao Mianmian widened her eyes, equally puzzled. “I-I haven’t told you.”

“If it wasn’t you, then who?”

Jiang Luoli took her cell phone out and showed her the WeChat chat history. “Two hours ago, you sent me this. It was you, wasn’t it? This is your account.”

Jiang Luoli looked at her. “Or were you drunk at that time and forgot about this message?

“Even if you don’t remember, I’ve already found out. Don’t you even think of denying it now!

“Tsk, tsk. Baby, I really can’t tell that Prince Charming is such a beast. He actually did it in the office with you... Haha, tell me, was it especially thrilling?

“Do you feel like you were being all secretive?

“You said it was over a few hours. Was he trying to prove that what happened in the morning was just an accident?”

Qiao Mianmian went red.

She pretty much figured out what was going on.

She definitely wasn’t the one who sent Jiang Luoli those messages.

Moreover, she didn’t have them on her own cell phone.

There was only one possibility.

Mo Yesi had taken her cell phone and chatted with Jiang Luoli while she slept.

Qiao Mianmian couldn’t believe he would do such a thing.

Especially the line “My hubby is actually really good at it.” Qiao Mianmian was amused by that statement.
