Chapter 126: You’re Killing Their Momentum!

And yet, when she heard it, she stopped in her tracks and turned around.

“Are you talking about me?” She was rather expressionless and her tone was surprisingly calm.

Bai Xiao glanced at her and sneered. “Whoever we’re talking about knows best.”

“Hmph.”

Qiao Mianmian continued gazing at her expressionlessly. She found it more amusing than infuriating, actually. “Mm, what you said was right.”

Bai Xiao and Zhang Yuwei were stunned as they looked at her skeptically.

They insulted her and she said they were right?

Was she a fool?

Qiao Mianmian looked at them like they were the silly ones instead and calmly said, “I do have a pretty face, and the rich people happen to like girls like me. I can’t help it.”

Bai Xiao and Zhang Yuwei were speechless.

So was Jiang Luoli standing behind her.

Baby, are you really saying this?

You’re killing their momentum!

“There’s no use in being jealous. Our looks are given to us by our parents, we can’t change it. Even making a living out of having good looks is a kind of ability too. Not everyone is so capable or lucky. After all, the Heavens favor a small minority of people.”

There was no response.

“And those like me are meant to marry into rich families to live a good life. How many rich madams have you seen working hard for an income? They just leave it to the men to earn a living, just like me. All I have to do is make sure I remain pretty.”

There was no response.

“Everyone has a different life, it’s pointless to be indignant over it. If you’re really so jealous or envious of me, there actually is a way to change your destiny.” She paused for a moment before saying very sincerely, “You can go for cosmetic surgery. By then, you should be able to get a slightly rich man, even if you don’t do as well as me. I believe you can do it, all the best!”

With that, she even gestured a clenched fist to cheer them on.

Bai Xiao and Zhang Yuwei had awful expressions on their faces. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“Pfft.”

Jiang Luoli was almost tearing up from laughing.

She had never realized how good Qiao Mianmian was at talking.

She wasn’t exactly scolding them, but she managed to make Bai Xiao and Zhang Yuwei so angry.

This was probably the greatest achievement of arguing.

She had never seen Qiao Mianmian do this to anyone before.

But now she realized it wasn’t that she couldn’t, but simply that she never found a reason to.

Bai Xiao and Zhang Yuwei really asked for this.

Jiang Luoli felt so good to see their terrible expressions now.

“Hmph.” They heard a scoff coming from behind them.

Qiao Mianmian was stunned at first when she heard the man’s low, alluring laughter. She slowly turned around.

The lights in the hallway were dim.

The man was donned in a full black outfit, standing behind her quietly. His deep eyes reflected the warm glow while his facial features were indescribably beautiful.

The way he looked at her so gently and deeply had Qiao Mianmian feeling as if he was sweeping her soul off her feet.

That presence he exuded and the air of charming danger...

He was full of desire.
