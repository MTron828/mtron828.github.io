Chapter 1965: This Is Also a Job Requirement

Qiao Mianmian was confused. “I don’t know. I don’t remember at all. Could he have gotten the wrong person?”

“Maybe. Or maybe you’ve forgotten.” Mo Yesi narrowed his eyes, hoping that Gong Zeli had recognized the wrong person.

Because Gong Zeli felt that Shen Rou had saved her, he had been very tolerant and doted on her all these years.

If Qiao Mianmian was the one who saved him, Mo Yesi would never accept another man treating his wife well.

“I think he must have gotten the wrong person.” Qiao Mianmian recalled what had happened ten years ago. “I didn’t even attend his birthday banquet. How could I have saved him?”

“Well, he must have made a mistake. Alright, let’s not talk about these unhappy things. Weren’t you accompanying Jiang Luoli? Why are you here?”

“Urgh...”

Qiao Mianmian thought of the new drama meeting she was going to attend tomorrow. She hesitated for a moment before saying carefully, “Hubby, can I discuss something with you?”

Mo Yesi looked down and raised an eyebrow. “I don’t think this is a good thing.”

This little rascal would only take the initiative to call him “hubby” when she had something to beg him for or when he was angry.

Although he knew that what she was about to say was definitely not something good, or at least something that he could not accept, Mo Yesi still rubbed her head and said with a smile, “Alright, what is it?

“If it’s not too much, I’ll agree to anything.”

“It’s not too much.” Qiao Mianmian put her arms around his neck. “Didn’t we agree yesterday to go overseas for a few days when you’re free?”

“Yeah.”

“Sister Xie came looking for me this afternoon. She said that my new drama will start broadcasting soon.”

“Yeah.”

“As you know, this is my first television drama, and I’m the female lead. When a new drama starts airing, there will be some publicity. Sister Xie told me that I might have to go to various places to promote my new drama for the next half a month.”

“Yeah.”

“So...” Qiao Mianmian looked at the man’s calm expression and felt a little guilty. She paused for a moment before saying, “We might not be able to go overseas anymore. I have to promote the new drama tomorrow. ”

“Yeah.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

“Hubby, are you angry?” She shook his arm. “This is also a job requirement. If I was just an insignificant supporting role, it didn’t matter if I went or not. But I’m the female lead, I have to go.

“Besides, this is a drama directed by my brother. I have to support him no matter what.

“However, the initial publicity will be out of town. I’ll be back in Yun Cheng in a few days. By then, I can go home at night.

“I know we’ve already agreed on a time, and you won’t be able to go because of me, so you’ll definitely be unhappy. But, there’s nothing I can do. Hubby, you understand, right?

“When I’m done this time, I’ll definitely accompany you!”

Qiao Mianmian looked carefully at the man’s expression.

Mo Yesi was expressionless.

She didn’t know if he was angry or not. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

After all, this man went expressionless when he got angry.

She called out softly, “Hubby?”
