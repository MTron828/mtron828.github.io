Chapter 748: The Whole World Is You

“How much do you like me?” He pressed his forehead against hers and rubbed his face against hers affectionately. “Mm? Tell me, how much do you like me?”

Even if she only liked half of him, it was enough.

He could use the rest of his life to exchange for her other half.

Qiao Mianmian couldn’t help but laugh. “I like it a lot, alright?”

“Mm, alright.” Mo Yesi smiled. “But I’m very greedy. I want more. Baby, can you try to like me more?”

“More?”

“Mm, just take it that I’m greedy.”

Before she expressed her feelings for him, he felt that even a little bit of her affection was enough.

But now, he felt that it wasn’t enough.

He wanted more...

He wanted her to only have eyes for him.

He wanted to be the person she chose.

“But, I might take longer to warm up. I won’t like someone too soon.”

“It’s alright.” Mo Yesi smiled. “I can wait.”

“Anytime?”

“Mm, I can wait however long it takes. But I hope I don’t have to wait too long.” The man’s eyes were filled with affection. He couldn’t help but kiss the corner of her lips again and murmured, “Baby, I’ll work hard. I’ll work hard to make you like me more.”

Qiao Mianmian couldn’t help but ask, “What about you?”

“Mm?”

“If I like you more, then you...”

Before she could finish, Mo Yesi held her hand and pressed it against his heart. “Baby, this seat has been occupied by you for a long time. It’s all you inside.”

Qiao Mianmian’s heart raced.

His words kept replaying in her mind.

He said that this seat was already full.

He said that it was all her inside...

“Mo Yesi...”

“Qiao Mianmian, I like you.” The man’s low voice was full of affection, and his dark eyes were only filled with her silhouette. He said word by word, “I like you so much.”

Her heart was full. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

His mind was full of her too.

The whole world was hers.

She liked him so much.

Qiao Mianmian wrapped her arms around his neck and closed her eyes.

The surrounding temperature rose quickly, and the two of them got a little aroused.

Mo Yesi was the first to regain his rationality.

He took a deep breath and quickly got off the bed. He pulled the thin blanket over her and got up to walk towards the bathroom. He said hoarsely, “Baby, I’ll go take a shower. You can eat first when the food arrives.”

Soon, Qiao Mianmian heard the sound of running water coming from the bathroom.

They had just come out of the shower.

It wasn’t hard for Qiao Mianmian to guess why he took a shower so quickly.

He probably took a cold shower this time.

She hadn’t expected him to hold it in.

He really didn’t touch her.

Not long after Mo Yesi went to the bathroom, his cell phone rang.

Qiao Mianmian walked over and saw that it was Shen Rou.

She frowned and hesitated for a while before picking up the call.
