Chapter 2454: Untitled

“Ah Si, hold on, I have something to tell you,” Shen Rou called out.

Mo Yesi heard her, but he didn’t stop. He continued walking with Qiao Mianmian arm-in-arm.

“Ah Si!” Shen Rou’s expression darkened when she saw that he was ignoring her. She chased after him in her high heels.

Soon, she caught up.

“Ah Si, are you so unhappy with me that you won’t even talk to me?”

Mo Yesi ignored her, so Shen Rou had no choice but to stop him.

Mo Yesi finally stopped in his tracks and looked at her coldly. “I have nothing to say to you. Move.”

This wasn’t the first time he treated her so coldly.

Ever since they fell out, Mo Yesi had been as cold and distant to her as a stranger. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Shen Rou thought that she was used to it.

She wouldn’t feel heartbroken anymore.

But looking at his cold and distant expression and how he treated her even more coldly than a stranger, her heart felt like it was stabbed by a sharp knife.

She couldn’t figure it out.

Why was he so heartless?

Was his heart made of stone?

Even if she did something bad, she’d never hurt him.

She just used some tricks on Qiao Mianmian.

But in the end, it didn’t have any serious consequences.

Didn’t he settle everything for that slut?

Why was he unwilling to forgive her and give her another chance?

What she’d done wasn’t irreparable.

Was it just because she was dealing with Qiao Mianmian that it was an unforgivable mistake in his eyes?

They’d known each other for over 20 years.

They were childhood sweethearts.

She’d always thought that she held a special place in his heart and was different from others.

She never thought that one day, he would treat her like a stranger because of another woman.

She overestimated her place in his heart.

He’d underestimated Qiao Mianmian’s importance to him.

“Ah Si, even if we’re not friends now, we’re not enemies. Do you have to do this to me? I don’t have any other motives. I just want to say a few words to you.” Shen Rou looked hurt.

But Mo Yesi didn’t change his attitude towards her just because of her words.

His expression was still cold, and his eyes were still distant. “Miss Shen said that we aren’t friends. I agree. But not enemies?”

Mo Yesi smiled mockingly. “Do you really think I don’t know what you did in private? When the Shen family was in trouble, the Mo family didn’t help, but we didn’t add insult to injury.

“The Mo family doesn’t owe the Shen family anything, and we have no obligation to help you. Why do you think that the Mo family has to help when something happens to the Shen family? Not to mention that the Shen and Mo families are only family friends. Even if we’re related, the Mo family has no obligation to help.

“Helping is a favor. It’s normal not to help. If something happens to the Mo family, the Shen family will be even more ruthless.”
