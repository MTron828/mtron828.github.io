Chapter 1429: What Exactly Are You Thinking About?

According to legend, vampires were a very good-looking race. They had outstanding looks.

Shen Xin’s love for Qiao Chen started with his looks.

She felt that Qiao Chen was different from usual tonight.

It was even more... tempting.

But after looking into his eyes for a few seconds, Shen Xin’s heart started racing.

She bit her lip and took a deep breath. After a few seconds, she slowly looked up at him. “Qiao Chen, thank you for just now.”

Qiao Chen pursed his lips. “It’s nothing. You did it to help me, so they... I should have done it. Shen Xin, you don’t have to do that. I didn’t intend to drink with them.

“Even if you didn’t come, I’d still reject them.”

Actually, Qiao Chen was explaining to Shen Xin.

He had nothing to do with those women.

He wasn’t interested in them. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

But to Shen Xin, it was another matter.

She thought that Qiao Chen was blaming her for being a busybody.

Her eyes darkened and she felt terrible.

Did he really think she was being nosy?

“I’m sorry.” She kept quiet for a while and tried to suppress her sadness. “I’m being nosy. I won’t do that again.”

Qiao Chen was stunned. He realized that she had misunderstood him and frowned. “Shen Xin, I don’t mean to blame you. I’m thanking you. Can’t you tell?”

Shen Xin’s eyelashes trembled. “I’m really nosy. If there’s a woman you’re interested in, I can go back and explain it to you.”

Qiao Chen was always liked by many girls.

He was the most popular guy in school.

Now that he was the Young Master of the Mo family, more and more women would like him in the future.

Many of those women were better than her.

The Shen and Mo families were no longer compatible.

And after Qiao Chen became the Young Master of the Mo family, he would have many good women to choose from. When that time came, he would definitely choose a woman and spend the rest of his life with her.

No matter who he chose, it wouldn’t be her.

In the past, she was worried that Qiao Chen’s family background wasn’t good enough and that it would be difficult for them to be together even if they liked each other.

She was worried that she wouldn’t be able to convince her family to accept him.

The funny thing was that their positions had now changed.

That was good too. She didn’t have to worry about this anymore.

Qiao Chen felt a surge of anger when he heard this. Seeing how nonchalant she was, he got even angrier. “Those women are much older than me. I don’t lack motherly love, and I’m not interested in a sibling relationship. If there really was a woman I liked, would I still bring you here?

“Shen Xin, what are you thinking about?” Qiao Chen was really angry, so his tone wasn’t too good. His last sentence was almost a roar.

He suddenly lost his temper at her. Shen Xin was stunned for a few seconds. Her eyes turned red.

She held back her tears after being mocked by those women.

But when Qiao Chen yelled at her, she couldn’t hold them back anymore.
