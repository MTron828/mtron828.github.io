She saw a group of young girls holding their cell phones and running towards her excitedly.

As they ran, one of them screamed. “Oh my God, it’s really Mianbao! Mianbao heard us calling her and turned to look at us!”

The passersby hadn’t recognized Qiao Mianmian yet.

But seeing that the fans were all running towards her and taking photos of her, and hearing someone call her name, the passersby quickly got excited and took out their phones to take photos of her.

Although they weren’t Qiao Mianmian’s fans, they had heard her name before.

A popular female celebrity was standing right in front of them. Even if they weren’t a fan, they wanted to take a video or photo to post on their WeChat Moments.

Soon, a group of people gathered around Qiao Mianmian.

Mo Yesi immediately hugged her waist and pulled her into his arms.

He was afraid of meeting crazy people like Huang Yilin and Little Xiao again.

The fans screamed again.

“Ah, Chairman Mo’s posture is full of charisma!”

“Wow, Mianbao’s 1.68m goddess looks are so petite and cute in front of Chairman Mo. Chairman Mo is too tall. Gosh, look at her long legs, they’re too outstanding!”

“Mianbao, I really like you. I’ll support you forever!”

“Mianbao, you have to take good care of yourself when you’re in Country Y. Don’t let Chairman Mo worry about you!”

“Mianbao, look here. Mommy loves you!”

“Wow, I’ve finally met Mo Yesi in person. He’s so handsome. Gosh, is such a handsome man real? Mianbao is so lucky to have such a handsome husband.”

Seeing that her fans recognized her, Qiao Mianmian took off her mask and sunglasses and let them take as many photos as they wanted.

Her actions caused the fans to scream.

Mo Yesi frowned at the noise around him. He tightened his arms around Qiao Mianmian’s waist and looked at the excited fans cautiously, afraid that they would do something irrational.

He’d never chased stars.

Hence, he couldn’t understand how fans felt when they saw their idol.

At this moment, he felt like these young girls were on steroids. They kept calling his wife’s name and taking photos of her.

A few girls even started crying. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Mo Yesi couldn’t understand this.

In his eyes, this group of people looked like they were crazy.

The more agitated the fans were, the tighter he held Qiao Mianmian, on guard against anyone harming his wife.

“Chairman Mo, can you turn around and look at the camera? We’re your Mianbao’s loyal fans. You and Mianbao are really compatible! Chairman Mo, you must treat Mianbao well and make her happy for the rest of her life.”

“Chairman Mo, we’re handing Mianbao to you. You must treat Mianbao well and not let her down. Otherwise, all of us will denounce you!”

Mo Yesi’s expression softened when he heard the fans’ instructions.
