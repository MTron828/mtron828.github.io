Chapter 742: I Bet He’s up to No Good

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

At this moment, he wanted to kill Bai Yusheng.

“Do you know, Brother Bai actually told me today...” Qiao Mianmian spoke for a while and then suddenly felt that something was wrong.

From the start to the end, the man beside her did not respond at all.

Moreover, she suddenly felt a gust of cold air blowing towards her. The temperature of the air-conditioner in the room was suitable. She was still wrapped in a towel, but the cold air still made her shiver.

She turned around in confusion and saw a face as dark as the bottom of a pot.

The man’s eyes were cold, and his thin lips were pursed into a cold smile.

Qiao Mianmian was stunned for a few seconds before she figured out why he was angry again.

She didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.

She felt a little tired. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

If she said that Mo Yesi was the most jealous man in the world, no one would refute her.

He was angry again not long after she coaxed him.

He was really... more jealous than women.

But if she married a jealous husband, what else could she do besides coaxing him?

She didn’t even dare to say that she wanted to return the goods. If she did, she’d probably be in a lot of trouble.

“Mo Yesi, do you know that Brother Bai has a younger sister? He said that his younger sister was separated from them since she was young. He always wanted a younger sister, but his mother was unwilling to have another child.

“So, it has always been his regret that he wasn’t able to have a sister by his side.”

Mo Yesi knew about this.

This wasn’t a secret among the big families.

Everyone knew that the Bai family still had a daughter left behind. Back then, they had no choice but to break up with her because of some special reasons.

When the Bai family resolved the crisis and wanted to get their daughter back, they lost contact with the family that took her in.

They lost contact.

But the Bai family hadn’t given up yet.

He didn’t know why Qiao Mianmian suddenly brought this up.

But he was even more upset now.

Bai Yusheng actually told Qiao Mianmian about this.

Although this wasn’t a secret to them, it was because of their friendship.

What relationship did Qiao Mianmian have with him?

How many days had they known each other?

They weren’t that close.

He even told her about what happened at home. What was he trying to do?

Poach her?

Mo Yesi couldn’t sit still anymore.

He wanted to find Bai Yusheng immediately.

He wanted to know what this guy was up to.

As the saying went, a friend’s wife couldn’t be bullied. Was this man, who was even eyeing his brother’s woman, still human?

“So...” He listened to her for a while and couldn’t help but say, “Did he tell you that he couldn’t help but want to get closer to you whenever he sees you, just like how he sees his sister? Did he ask you to call him Brother Bai?”

“Uh...”

Qiao Mianmian widened her eyes in shock.

Mo Yesi looked down at her. “How would I know? We’re all men, how could I not know what men think? You’re the only one who foolishly believed him. I think he’s up to no good.”
