Chapter 823: It’s About Your Daughter

Gong Zeli looked up at Qiao Ruhai and smiled. “Mr. Qiao, please take a seat.”

Seeing that he was still standing, Qiao Ruhai didn’t dare to sit down first.

In fact, he was feeling very uneasy.

He didn’t know why Gong Zeli called him over.

The Gong and Qiao families had never contacted each other.

It wasn’t that he didn’t want to interact with the Gong family, but the Qiao family wasn’t powerful enough to do so.

In the eyes of the Gong family, the Qiao family was nothing.

But now that the Young Master of the Gong family suddenly said that he had something to discuss with him, Qiao Ruhai couldn’t guess what it was. Thinking about the comments the people in Yuncheng City made about this Young Master of the Gong family, he felt very nervous and afraid.

Everyone knew that this Young Master Gong had a bad temper and was temperamental. He wasn’t someone to be trifled with.

Offending him meant death.

“Young Master Gong, why are you looking for me?” Qiao Ruhai asked politely.

Gong Zeli slowly walked to the stone table and sat down. He was still playing with the teacup in his hand as he looked up at Qiao Ruhai’s uneasy expression. He smiled and said politely, “Mr. Qiao, please sit down. I don’t like to keep looking up when I’m talking to others. It’s tiring.”

Qiao Ruhai heard the word “tired” and quickly sat down.

He didn’t dare to let this young master get tired.

The tea artist poured another cup of tea and placed it in front of him.

Gong Zeli waved his hand, signaling for everyone to leave.

After a while.

When only he and Qiao Ruhai were left in the gazebo, Qiao Ruhai hesitated for a few seconds before asking uneasily, “Young Master Gong, the Qiao family hasn’t done anything to offend the Gong family, right? Young Master Gong suddenly said that he wanted to see me, but I’m really confused and unsure. If Young Master Gong has any instructions, you can just say it...”

Gong Zeli swirled the tea in his cup and took a sip. He then looked up slowly and said, “Old Master Qiao, don’t be afraid. I’m just here to ask you something, not to trouble you.”

Qiao Ruhai heaved a sigh of relief. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

His tense body relaxed, and he didn’t look as nervous as before.

“What is it, Young Master Gong?”

Gong Zeli narrowed his eyes. “It’s about your daughter.”

“My daughter?” Qiao Ruhai was stunned. The first thing that came to his mind was Qiao Anxin. “Is Young Master Gong referring to Anxin?”

Gong Zeli frowned and seemed a little unhappy. “Old Master Qiao has two daughters, right? Why didn’t you think that I was looking for your other daughter?”

“You mean... Mianmian?”

Although Qiao Ruhai didn’t use Weibo, he knew what was going on online.

He suddenly recalled how Gong Zeli helped Qiao Mianmian clarify the scandal on Weibo.

And today...

Before he came over, he saw the scandal between Qiao Mianmian and Gong Zeli.

Then, he was called over by the Young Master of the Gong family.

He even wanted to talk to him about his daughter.

Qiao Ruhai slowly thought of a possibility. His expression changed as he grabbed the teacup in front of him.

Gong Zeli nodded. “Mm, what I want to talk about has something to do with your eldest daughter, Qiao Mianmian.”
