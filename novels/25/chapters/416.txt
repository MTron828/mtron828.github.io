Chapter 417: Cast a Spell on Him

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Her face was as awful as it could get.

It was a huge blow to be called ugly by a man who swept her off her feet.

Every last drop of blood had left her face.

“Also, you’re her roommate and have lived with her for years. It’s bad enough that you don’t believe her, but you went further and spread rumors about her. Women like you disgust me.”

Bai Xiao’s face was pale. “Mister.”

“I let you off the last time on her account. I didn’t want to upset her, since you’re classmates. But now it seems like there’s no need to be nice to you girls.”

Bai Xiao could get the subtext.

She went even paler, and her lips quivered. “I didn’t say those things, it’s the person who spilled it. It’s nothing to do with me! I was just... I was just reminding you.”

Zhang Yuwei was pale as a sheet too. “Qiao Mianmian, this really has nothing to do with us. Everything that Xiao Xiao mentioned was already on the school forum page. You can take a look if you want. It’s not just us who know about this, the whole school knows now.

“You can’t blame us for this!”

The two of them started panicking after hearing what Mo Yesi said.

It seemed like he wanted revenge.

Upon thinking about what happened to Shen Yueyue and Zhao Wanting, they felt a chill down their spines.

Especially Bai Xiao.

She’d thought that by revealing Qiao Mianmian’s shameful past to this man, he’d fly into a rage and dump her right away.

But this turned out very differently from what she’d expected.

Not only did the man not trust them, he even told them it didn’t matter, even if it was true.

He would still continue loving Qiao Mianmian.

Bai Xiao couldn’t believe that he was so deeply in love with Qiao Mianmian already.

So much so that he was alright with his woman having aborted another man’s child.

Qiao Mianmian must have cast a spell on him.

Mo Yesi didn’t listen to anyone else at all.

He didn’t even bother giving them a second glance.

After saying his piece, he wrapped an arm around Qiao Mianmian and guided her into the car.

Bai Xiao and Zhang Yuwei were about to dash forward and explain themselves further, but Mo Yesi slammed the door in their faces. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Soon, the Lamborghini pulled out of the lot and left.

They were gone from their sights in less than a minute.

Zhang Yuwei thought about what the man had said to them and turned around and blamed Bai Xiao. “I told you to leave, why didn’t you! Bai Xiao, I’m going to be in deep trouble because of you!”

Zhang Yuwei felt aggrieved.

She actually had nothing to do with this.

And she hadn’t even said a thing as she stood beside Bai Xiao.

It was Bai Xiao who stirred all this up alone.

But now, she was also getting the blame just because she was with her.

This meant that she’d be facing the same punishment and consequences.

There was only half a year left until their graduation.

If she got expelled at this time, all the years of studying would’ve been in vain.

And for a girl who wanted a career in the entertainment industry, her youth was especially important.
