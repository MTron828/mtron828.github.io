Chapter 52: You Can’t Go to School on an Empty Stomach

Qiao Mianmian was stunned.

She widened her eyes and took a step back as well. “You are?”

Lei En smiled at the innocent Young Madam, a girl who was barely 20. “I’m Lei En, the butler of the Mo Residence. Young Master is having his breakfast at the dining hall now, would Young Madam like to have it now too?”

Mo Residence...

Qiao Mianmian scanned the surroundings, taking in the absurdly extravagant mansion.

So this was Mo Yesi’s house.

She’d thought it was just a villa.

But...

Now she knew that poverty had really limited her imagination.

This castle-like home was too many times bigger than a villa.

“Mo Yesi is still at home?” She checked the time just now and thought he’d gone to the firm.

Hearing her address him as “Mo Yesi” directly, Lei En got a little shocked. He quickly regained his composure and nodded. “Yes, Young Master is at home.”

“Oh.”

Qiao Mianmian nodded. “Then I’ll go to him. I’d have to trouble you to lead the way.” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Lei En hurriedly responded, “Young Madam, you’re too nice.”

When Qiao Mianmian reached the dining hall only after a good few minutes of walking, she came to realize that she really did need Lei En’s help to find her way.

Otherwise, she’d surely have gotten lost.

A man in comfy home clothes was sitting at a white, engraved dining table spanning a few meters, elegantly taking a sip of coffee.

Hearing approaching footsteps, he looked up.

His dark eyes landed on Qiao Mianmian. After looking at her for a few seconds, his brows furrowed slightly.

Qiao Mianmian instinctively tensed up.

She felt as if she might have done something wrong.

A moment later.

Mo Yesi raised his hand and gestured at her. “Come over.”

The man’s voice sounded authoritative as usual.

Qiao Mianmian walked towards him.

But stopped about a meter and a half from him.

She looked down at the man’s handsome face, her heart rate picking up involuntarily. She took a deep breath to calm herself.

She knitted her brows and hurriedly said, “Mo Yesi, I’ve something to talk to you about.”

But the man looked calm and composed as if there was nothing to hurry over. “Sit down and eat first, we can talk later.”

“No...” Qiao Mianmian said urgently. “I don’t have the time for breakfast. Can you get someone to send me to school right now? I have an important lesson today, I can’t be absent.”

“What lesson? What time does it begin?” The man was still speaking calmly.

“Performance class.” Qiao Mianmian checked the time on her cell phone again and got even more flustered. “It’s at 10. I have less than an hour...”

“Mm.” Mo Yesi nodded, acknowledging that he heard her.

That was it.

His attitude made her even more anxious.

“Mo Yesi, last night you told me you’d send me to school. You can’t go back on your words.”

“What’s the rush, it’s not as if I’m not letting you go.” Mo Yesi tapped the table lightly, signaling for her to sit. “Eat first.”

How could Qiao Mianmian even be in the mood to eat?

“I...”

“Mianmian, be good.” The man’s voice was slightly lower now and had a tinge of tenderness to it as if he was coaxing a child. “I’ll settle your class matters, don’t worry about that. However anxious you are, you have to have your breakfast first. You can’t go to school on an empty stomach.”
