Chapter 474: She Actually Left... Just Like That?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Mr. Yan, thank you for cooperating with me for this play. Nice to meet you. Hopefully, we’ll have a chance to see each other again. I’ll be off now.

“Goodbye.”

With that, Jiang Luoli headed off and quickly flagged for a vacant cab.

The cab driver saw her and drove over.

She got into the cab and shut the door after her with a bam. She actually never even gave him a second glance.

She just... left.

Yan Shaoqing was rooted to the ground, completely stunned.

She actually left... just like that?

He looked incredulous. He couldn’t believe that he was treated like that.

So, her eagerness to go on a date with him was just a lie?

She didn’t intend to go out with him.

It was just an excuse to leave, so she could borrow his cell phone to contact Mo Yesi?

At that moment, Yan Shaoqing felt as if he’d been slapped on the face.

Jiang Luoli left without any hesitation, and now he was the willing party with unrequited expectations.

As of now.

Thankfully, he didn’t do anything that would have made this more awkward.

He had planned to clarify things with Jiang Luoli and let her know that he had been joking with her and wasn’t serious about wooing her.

He wanted to snap her out of her dreams of being a rich missus.

It was a good thing that he hadn’t said those.

Yan Shaoqing was still standing in the night breeze at the entrance of the clubhouse.

Almost like a statue.

Qiao Mianmian had no idea that Jiang Luoli contacted Mo Yesi.

After Jiang Luoli left, she was the only person in the private room.

Her phone beeped, and she took a look at the screen. There was a WeChat message from Jiang Luoli.

Jiang Luoli: [Baby, I’m sorry. I was supposed to keep you company. You’re still at the clubhouse, right?]

Qiao Mianmian didn’t feel like replying to her. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

But she did, anyway. [You’re with Yan Shaoqing now? Luo Luo, don’t tell me that you’ve really fallen for him. I won’t believe it.]

Mianmian: [What are you up to? Tell me honestly!]

To be fair, Yan Shaoqing was an eligible catch.

His family was well-to-do, he was handsome, his physique was good, and he was apparently very generous to women.

He was the sort of partner one would like to bring around.

She felt that Jiang Luoli wouldn’t like him, not because he was lacking in anything.

But simply because his personality wasn’t Jiang Luoli’s ideal type.

Although Jiang Luoli was an extroverted girl of a bubbly nature, she preferred mature and steady men.

Jiang Luoli: [Mr. Yan is rich and handsome, and he says all the right things. Why wouldn’t I like him? You know that I’m a sucker for good looks. He’s such a hunk, that’s my favorite.]

Mianmian: [You can fool someone else, but do you think I’ll believe you? You’re still not coming clean? Alright, then. We’re over.]

Jiang Luoli: [No, Baby. It’s my fault. Alright. I admit that I have another agenda, but I can’t tell you yet.]

Mianmian: [Friendship over!]

Jiang Luoli: [...]

Qiao Mianmian did not bother about Jiang Luoli anymore after sending that message.
