Chapter 1770: Zhan Bo Touched That B*tch

Just as she was about to leave, she heard an excited scream.

“Ah, Zhan Bo, Zhan Bo is here.”

“Gosh, Brother Zhanbo is too handsome.”

“Zhan Bo, Zhan Bo, I love you.”

“I’m going crazy. How can Zhan Bo be so handsome in person! He’s so handsome.”

Qiao Mianmian heard the commotion and pretended to look over. She saw the popular young hunk Zhan Bo walking out of the VIP lane with a mask and a black cap.

He was dragging a black suitcase, and just like Qiao Mianmian, he didn’t have anyone with him.

But in order to maintain order and the passengers’ safety, the airport arranged for a few security guards to follow him.

The fans screamed and wanted to go forward. They all took out their cell phones and took photos of Zhan Bo.

Even the fans who came to pick Qiao Mianmian up were excited to see him. They took out their cell phones and snapped photos of him.

The current Zhan Bo was the same as Tu Yilei back then. He was a national idol.

Especially to girls.

The people who came to pick them up today were mostly girls in their teens.

Qiao Mianmian stood at the exit and watched as Zhan Bo walked out slowly. She hesitated to greet him.

She was afraid of being scolded by his fans.

They were both guests of the same episode, and they were going to be together for a month. If they didn’t even greet each other, someone might think she was arrogant because of her background.

Qiao Mianmian knew very well that the haters would definitely do such a thing.

It was even worse than she thought.

But Qiao Mianmian really didn’t want Zhan Bo’s fans to say that she was trying to ride on his popularity. Moreover, she knew very well that female fans were especially possessive of celebrities like Zhan Bo.

They wished their big brother wouldn’t have any contact with the opposite sex.

Besides themselves, they felt that all the other women who approached him were vixens.

Female artistes like Qiao Mianmian, who had already been involved in scandals with many men, were even more viewed by his fans as beasts.

Qiao Mianmian knew this very well, that was why she hesitated to greet Zhan Bo.

She looked at the crazy fans and Zhan Bo, who was about to walk out. She thought for a while and decided to leave.

She would rather be labeled as arrogant by the media.

She didn’t want others to think that she was using Zhan Bo’s popularity.

Just as Qiao Mianmian turned around and was about to leave, Zhan Bo was about to leave too. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

At this moment, his fans screamed and rushed forward. The scene was completely out of control.

Someone pushed Qiao Mianmian, and she lost her balance and fell to the ground.

The person beside her wanted to help her up.

A pair of fair hands reached out and held her just before she fell.

“Miss Qiao, are you alright?” A clear and pleasant voice sounded above her head.

Qiao Mianmian looked up and saw Zhan Bo holding her.

The female fans around him looked at Qiao Mianmian with hatred.

“Gosh, Zhan Bo actually touched that b*tch.”
