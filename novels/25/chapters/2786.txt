Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

In Qiao Mianmian and Qin Han’s live stream.

At the desk, the man’s handsome face seemed to be covered in a layer of frost as he looked at the warm and harmonious scene in the live stream with a dark expression.

Wei Zheng felt pressured as he reported to his boss. Although he didn’t know why his boss’ expression suddenly changed, he didn’t even dare to breathe.

He hadn’t felt Chairman Mo’s anger in a long time.

After all, Chairman Mo and Young Madam had such a good relationship now. As long as he didn’t have any conflict with Young Madam, Chairman Mo wouldn’t be in a bad mood.

In the past, work could still affect Chairman Mo.

But now, the only person who could affect him was Young Madam.

So…

Was Chairman Mo’s sudden change be related to Young Madam?

But wasn’t Young Madam recording a variety show?

Wei Zheng was confused, but he didn’t dare to say anything.

He continued reporting on his work despite the low pressure from his boss. “Our cooperation with Hengda Corporation has been confirmed. If nothing goes wrong, we can successfully sign the contract this week.

“Also, the team in charge of the branch company in D City has been chosen. Chairman Mo, I’ve sent the name list of the branch company’s leaders to your email. If you don’t have any objections, I’ll inform…”

The man slowly looked up.

His face was dark.

Wei Zheng was at a loss for words.

He felt as if his heart was frozen by the coldness in his boss’s eyes.

He couldn’t even move.

Oh my.

Chairman Mo’s face was so dark…

How scary.

Did Young Madam do something to make him angry again?

“Chairman Mo, you…” Wei Zheng struggled to speak.

“I regret it.” Mo Yesi suddenly said something that confused him.

Wei Zheng was confused.

His eyes were full of question marks. “Chairman Mo, w-what do you regret?”

The handsome and elegant man pursed his thin lips and looked angry. After a moment of silence, he said in a low voice, “I shouldn’t have let her participate in that damn variety show.”

He thought that this variety show with no ambiguous interaction was safer.

That was why he allowed her to attend.

But when he thought about the glaring scene he saw in the live stream, he couldn’t wait to bring her back.

This damn show actually made her share a room with another man?

And made her husband and wife with another man?

And even arranged a daughter for them?

Although he hadn’t seen any ambiguous interactions, this arrangement alone was enough to make him angry.

He should have known that this was what a parent-child variety show was like.

No matter what, he wouldn’t let Qiao Mianmian participate in this show.

“Chairman Mo, are you referring to… the variety show Young Madam is recording?” Wei Zheng asked. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

He knew that Chairman Mo wouldn’t be so angry if it wasn’t about Young Madam.

Only Young Madam could make him like this.

Mo Yesi said coldly, “She actually didn’t tell me that this variety show is like this.. Wei Zheng, immediately do something about it.”
