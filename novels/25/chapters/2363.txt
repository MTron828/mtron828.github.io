Chapter 2364: Would a Man Like Him Fall in Love?

Qiao Mianmian: [Oh, got it.]

Mo Yesi: [Good girl.]

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

This man was ridiculous!

“Mianmian, who are you talking to? Chairman Mo?”

Zhan Bo and Qiao Mianmian were sitting next to each other.

Seeing that she was typing on her cell phone, he took a look and saw Mo Yesi’s “good girl”.

He sighed. “The sour smell of love. You and Chairman Mo are really sticking to each other.”

Actually, when Zhan Bo saw Mo Yesi’s “good girl”, he didn’t immediately feel the sour smell of love.

He felt horrified.

Because at that time, the image of Mo Yesi saying “good girl” to Qiao Mianmian with his ice-cold face appeared in his mind. It was very strange.

For other couples, it would be like the man was pampering his girlfriend.

But Mo Yesi?

In Zhan Bo’s opinion, a man like Mo Yesi who looked especially pure and abstinent should be left alone for the rest of his life.

There shouldn’t be women around him.

Would a man like him fall in love?

Would any woman be happy with him?

Wouldn’t she be afraid of such a cold face?

Hence, Zhan Bo was especially impressed by Qiao Mianmian. She actually dared to date Mo Yesi and even succeeded in taking him down.

This wasn’t something an ordinary person could do.

She heard that Young Lady Shen had been chasing Mo Yesi for over 20 years, but she still couldn’t get him.

It was obvious how difficult this man was.

Qiao Mianmian had undoubtedly overcome a world-class problem.

He couldn’t even take it lying down.

“What are you doing, peeping at our conversation.” Qiao Mianmian was shocked and put her cell phone away as glared at him.

“I didn’t peek, I just accidentally saw it.” Zhan Bo was caught, but he could still lie calmly.

Qiao Mianmian glared at him again. “Come on, I don’t know what kind of person you are.”

“I really didn’t. I only saw Chairman Mo’s last message. I didn’t see anything else.” Zhan Bo blinked innocently.

“Oh right, when you were thanking Chairman Mo on stage, I saw Shen Rou’s face turn green.” Zhan Bo changed the topic. “The way she looked at you was really scary. It was as if she was looking at an enemy.”

Recalling Shen Rou’s gaze, Zhan Bo touched the goosebumps on his arms. “She must hate you for snatching Chairman Mo from her. You have to be careful of this person. I’m afraid she’ll do something bad to you.”

After all, jealousy and hatred drove people crazy.

Women could do anything when they were crazy.

Shen Rou hated her?

Qiao Mianmian already knew.

She already had a feud with her. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Shen Rou had already done many bad things to her.

She didn’t take Shen Rou seriously.

To her, she didn’t want these unimportant people to affect her life. If Shen Rou wanted to deal with her, the general method was to defame her online. It wasn’t the first time Qiao Mianmian was defamed, so she wasn’t afraid at all.

When she was still a small fry, she didn’t have many fans, but Shen Rou didn’t succeed.

Moreover, she had a lot of fans now.

It wasn’t easy for her to do the same.
