Chapter 2115: You Can’t Be Too Anxious

“Are you going or not!” Father Qiao stood up in anger and pointed at her. “Is your sister dressed like you? Take a good look at what you’re wearing. Do you think it’s appropriate?”

Qiao Anxin was indignant and wanted to rebut.

“Alright, Anxin, don’t make your dad angry on his birthday. He asked you to change, so do it.” Lin Huizhen held her back and persuaded her. “You have so many clothes, it’s alright. Don’t say anymore.”

“But Mom…”

“Alright, enough. I’ll go upstairs with you.” Lin Huizhen was afraid that Qiao Anxin would say something to anger Father Qiao again, so she quickly dragged her upstairs.

…

Upstairs.

Qiao Anxin was furious. “I think Dad is biased. How am I not suitable? Why can Qiao Mianmian wear a dress, but I can’t! He’s biased, biased!

“Am I still his biological daughter!

“Qiao Mianmian has nothing to do with him, but he treats her better than me. Is he senile!”

“Lower your voice!”

Lin Huizhen quickly covered her mouth. “They’ll hear you.”

“Hmph. So what if they hear me?” Qiao Anxin pushed her hand away and said angrily, “Did I say anything wrong? I’m his biological daughter, but he treats an outsider better than he treats me.

“I even wonder if I’m his biological daughter!”

Lin Huizhen’s expression changed.

Qiao Anxin didn’t notice Lin Huizhen’s sparkling eyes at this moment.

“Alright, don’t bother about what your dad thinks. He told you to change your clothes, so just do it.” Lin Huizhen pursed her lips and regained her composure. “Don’t go against him today. Don’t rebut him.”

Qiao Anxin looked down at her dress and felt indignant.

She dressed like this to attract Mo Yesi’s attention.

How could she attract him if she was dressed normally?

This dress was very tight and showed off her figure, making her look very sexy.

Men liked sexy women.

Back then, she seduced Su Ze step by step.

Mo Yesi was different from other men, but every man had similar problems. Not many men could resist a sexy woman flirting with them.

Qiao Anxin was confident in her looks. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Moreover, if a man chose a woman based on her looks, Su Ze wouldn’t have been seduced by her.

Qiao Anxin looked reluctant.

Lin Huizhen tried to persuade her again. “If you don’t change, your dad won’t let you go downstairs. Do you want to stay here upstairs?”

Qiao Anxin was obviously unwilling.

She had been upstairs all this while, so how could she have the chance to interact with Mo Yesi?

“Anxin, Mom knows what you’re thinking. But this matter can’t be rushed. I don’t think Mo Yesi will so easily take the bait. You can’t be too anxious.”

Qiao Anxin looked up in shock. “Mom, you…”

“You’re my child, how could I not know what you’re thinking?” Lin Huizhen looked at her. “Mo Yesi is indeed an outstanding man. If you can get together with him, I won’t lack anything in this lifetime.”
