Chapter 314: That Was a Misunderstanding, I Didn’t Peep!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Why did she find that girl so familiar?

Right opposite them.

Qiao Chen had no idea that his sister had been watching him for a while now.

He pursed his lips as he looked at the girl in her seat with some impatience in his eyes. “Shen Xin, didn’t you say that other classmates are coming? Where are they?”

The girl smiled and said sweetly, “Qiao Chen, are you playing dumb? There aren’t any other classmates. It’s just you and me.”

“What?” Qiao Chen was shocked, and then some anger crept into his eyes. “Didn’t you say...”

“I lied to you.” The girl smiled again. “If I hadn’t said that, would you have come?”

“Alright, don’t glare at me like that anymore. I did all of this just to have a proper date with you. I tried asking you out so many times, but you kept rejecting me. I had no choice but to make this up to get you here.”

Qiao Chen said angrily, “You...”

“What about it?”

The girl tipped her chin up slightly. “Since you’re already here, then have a good meal with me first. Don’t keep standing around. Others are watching us.”

Qiao Chen was furious.

How could Shen Xin lie to him?

She said that it was her birthday and that she’d invited some friends for a celebration, including some of Qiao Chen’s good friends.

He guessed that Shen Xin wouldn’t do anything overboard in the presence of their classmates, so he agreed to come after some consideration.

Qiao Chen had been avoiding Shen Xin and trying his best not to spend time with her alone.

Now that he found out Shen Xin had been lying to him, why would he want to stay?

“Young Lady Shen, you can eat on your own. I’m not interested in staying. I’ve another appointment. I...”

Before Qiao Chen could finish his sentence, Shen Xin laughed. “Qiao Chen, if you don’t eat with me, I’ll let everyone in school know about you peeping at my body.

“By then, the whole school will think of you as a pervert. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“What do you think about that?”

Qiao Chen understood what she was referring to and went red with anger and embarrassment. “That was a misunderstanding. I didn’t peep!”

“I don’t care if you did.” Shen Xin picked up the cup of coffee on the table and took a sip. “Anyway, the final story is that you did see my body and take advantage of me. Don’t you dare deny this, I have a voice recording of our conversation.”

Qiao Chen looked astonished. “You recorded it?”

“That’s right.” Shen Xin smiled sweetly. “If I hadn’t done it, what am I to do if you deny it? Student Qiao, I’m not being demanding here. Just have a meal with me, and I’ll let you go. Don’t look as if you’re at a disadvantage and being put in such a tough spot. Don’t you think it’s an enjoyment to spend time with a beautiful girl at such a classy restaurant?”

Qiao Chen looked at her, took a deep breath, and clenched his fists. He tried to fight the anger in him.

He’d never met someone as thick-skinned as Shen Xin.

He had already tactfully and kindly rejected her so many times, but she refused to let him off.

This girl had no shame at all and was willing to spout even the most twisted words just to achieve her goal.
