Chapter 978: Am I Disturbing Chairman Mo?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Mo Yesi looked up in shock.

Seeing Qiao Mianmian walk in with a cup of coffee, he was stunned for a few seconds. “Mianmian, why is it you...”

“Why, am I not welcome?” Qiao Mianmian walked to the desk and placed the coffee on it. She then smiled and said, “Am I disturbing Chairman Mo?”

Mo Yesi was speechless.

The man narrowed his eyes and stared at her for a while more before confirming that she wasn’t an illusion.

He immediately got up and pulled her into his arms. He placed his hand on her head and said in a low and magnetic voice, “Why didn’t you tell me in advance? When did you arrive?”

Qiao Mianmian leaned against his chest and played with a button on his shirt. She smiled sweetly and said, “I wanted to give you a surprise. I came straight after getting off the plane. How is it, are you happy?”

“I’m happy.” Mo Yesi tightened his arms around her and kissed her on the forehead. “You’re not leaving today?”

“Mm. I’ll return to F City tomorrow.”

“Alright, I’ll go back with you tomorrow. What do you want to eat tonight, have you thought of where you want to go? I’ll leave work early today to accompany you.”

She smelled sweet.

There was also a pleasant fragrance in her hair.

She was like a peach that exuded sweetness, making people want to eat her up.

As Mo Yesi looked down at the girl in his arms who was as beautiful as a fairy, his eyes darkened as he recalled the call he just hung up.

He should have known.

It was only a matter of time before his precious was targeted.

If he liked and was so obsessed with this woman, how could others not be interested?

But it was normal for others to have such thoughts.

He wasn’t too angry or bothered by it.

But if the person interested in her was his good buddy, it would be completely different.

Moreover, he knew Gong Zeli well.

They were equally possessive in many ways.

They were equally paranoid.

It was very likely that he would fall in love with someone for the rest of his life.

But what he couldn’t understand was that the person in Gong Zeli’s heart wasn’t Shen Rou.

But now...

Based on his understanding of Gong Zeli, he shouldn’t be such a sentimental person.

But Gong Zeli’s previous actions showed that there was something wrong with him.

Mo Yesi hoped that he was overthinking things.

But he knew very well whether he was overthinking it.

His judgment had never been wrong. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

It was the same this time.

“Ah, tonight?”

Qiao Mianmian looked up at him apologetically. “Erm, I already have an appointment tonight. I might not be able to have dinner with you.”

Mo Yesi frowned. “You already have an appointment?”

Qiao Mianmian blinked guiltily. “Y-Yes.”

“Who do you have an appointment with? Jiang Luoli?” The man looked even more upset when he heard her name.

In his wife’s heart, he couldn’t be compared to her best friend.
