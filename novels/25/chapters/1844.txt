Chapter 1845: Find Out the Mastermind

They clicked into their accounts and all of them showed that they had been deleted.

“Hahahaha, the anti-fans got what they deserved. They really got banned. I’m dying of laughter.”

“Well done!”

“I just want to know if Mr. Mo did it. If he did, this overbearing way of protecting his girlfriend is too sweet.”

...

At the same time, in the CEO’s office of the Mo Corporation building.

“President Mo, we’ve already blocked all accounts that attacked Young Madam. We’ve also found the information on those haters. We’ve confirmed that someone hired them to defame Young Madam online.”

“Continue investigating.”

The man in front of the desk was handsome and cold. His face was so dark that water could drip from it. “Find out the mastermind.”

“Yes, President Mo.” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“These anti-fans will be banned whenever you see them in the future.”

“Yes, President Mo. I will have someone keep an eye on them. If they discover anything, they’ll ban their accounts.”

Mo Yesi rubbed his forehead. “Alright, you can leave now. Get someone to make me a cup of coffee.”

“President Mo, do you still want to work overtime?” Wei Zheng hesitated for a moment before saying, “There are some things that can be done tomorrow. President Mo, you’ve been busy for the entire day. You should go back and rest early.”

“No, I have to finish everything today.” Mo Yesi looked up at him. “Help me book a flight to Ning City tomorrow afternoon. I’ll finish some things that I need to settle today. You and the Vice President can handle the rest tomorrow.”

Wei Zheng paused. “President Mo, are you going to Ning City tomorrow?”

“Yeah.”

Mo Yesi was still worried about Qiao Mianmian, even though she said everything was normal.

But without seeing her with his own eyes, he was still worried.

“I understand.”

Wei Zheng thought to himself that it was no wonder President Mo had to work overtime today. It turned out that he wanted to go to Ning City to visit Young Madam tomorrow.

Speaking of which, President Mo was really clingy.

Young Madam had only been gone for two days and President Mo was already going to fly over to look for her.

With other couples it was always the woman sticking to the man.

But, when it came to President Mo, it became the man sticking to the woman.

But, from another perspective, Young Madam was truly fortunate to have married a devoted and affectionate man like President Mo.

After Wei Zheng left the office, Mo Yesi took out his phone and sent Qiao Mianmian a video call request.

...

Qiao Mianmian had just taken a shower and was lying in bed when she saw her phone screen light up. She picked it up, and the man stared at her for a few seconds before saying in a low voice, “You just showered?”

“Yeah.”

Qiao Mianmian had just washed her hair and blown it dry with the hairdryer.

“Why aren’t you drying your hair? You might catch a cold. Are there cameras in your room?”

Qiao Mianmian looked around and shook her head. “No, I turned it off.”

They didn’t film 24/7.

Every night after nine o’clock, all the cameras in the room would be turned off.

Artists also needed some private time.

“Baby, I missed you.” After knowing that there were no cameras around, the man’s tone became even lower. Without any qualms, he started saying intoxicating sweet nothings. “Baby, you weren’t by my side. I didn’t sleep well for the past two days.”

Even though they had been married for so long, Qiao Mianmian’s face still heated up.

Fortunately, the cameras were already turned off.

“Baby, did you miss me?” In the video, the man’s eyes were deep and dark, like the deep sea at night, able to draw people into his eyes.

“Yes, I did.”
