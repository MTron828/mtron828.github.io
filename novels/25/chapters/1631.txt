Chapter 1632: He Should Want Her to Help Pay the Money Back

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Mm, then quickly give Big Brother a call.” Qiao Mianmian’s heart raced as she bit her lip. “I’m really worried about Luo Luo.”

Seeing how worried she was, Mo Yesi immediately took out his cell phone and called Mo Shixiu.

Mo Shixiu picked it up after a while.

Mo Yesi went straight to the point. “Brother, have you met Jiang Luoli these last two days? Have you contacted her today?”

“She went back to her hometown, so we haven’t seen each other this week. But we did contact each other this morning. Why?”

“Mianmian called her just now, but her phone was switched off. Mianmian was worried about her, so she asked me to call you.”

“Turned off?” Mo Shixiu was silent for a few seconds before saying, “Maybe her cell phone ran out of battery.”

“Mm, that’s what I told Mianmian too. She said that Jiang Luoli’s cell phone rarely ran out of battery. She’s worried that something happened to Jiang Luoli. Since you’ve contacted her this morning, it shouldn’t be a problem.”

Mo Yesi hung up.

“Big Brother contacted her this morning, don’t worry. Her cell phone must be out of battery.”

“Is that so?”

Even so, Qiao Mianmian still felt uneasy.

Because every time she contacted Jiang Luoli, her phone was never off.

But Jiang Luoli and Mo Shixiu contacted each other this morning.

Then... it should be fine.

Perhaps she was overthinking.

Jiang Luoli was a smart person and could take good care of herself.

She would call her later. Even if her cell phone was out of battery, it would be charged in a few hours.

...

On the other side.

Mo Shixiu hung up and called Jiang Luoli.

The phone rang, indicating that Jiang Luoli’s phone was switched off.

Mo Shixiu didn’t think it was a big deal to turn off his cell phone.

But Qiao Mianmian said that Jiang Luoli rarely turned off her phone.

For a moment, Mo Shixiu couldn’t settle his work.

He called Assistant Xu into the office.

“Minister.” Assistant Xu said respectfully, “What can I do for you?”

Mo Shixiu pondered for a few seconds and frowned. “What’s my schedule next?”

Assistant Xu immediately reported. “Minister, you have to fly to S Nation tomorrow and go on a business trip for a week. When you return from S Nation, you’ll have a day off.”

Assistant Xu thought that he wanted to arrange a date with Jiang Luoli. He thought for a while and said, “Minister, if you want to cultivate your relationship with Miss Jiang, there’s still time. When the time comes, you can bring Miss Jiang over.”

“It’s not about this.” Mo Shixiu threw a pen on the desk. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“It’s not about this?” Assistant Xu was puzzled. “Then, why did the Minister suddenly ask me about your schedule?”

Mo Shixiu had asked about his schedule previously because of Jiang Luoli.

“Go and find out why Miss Jiang went back to her hometown this time.”

“Yes, Minister. I’ll check immediately.”

Ten minutes later.

Assistant Xu found out what happened and reported to Mo Shixiu. “Minister, I found out that Miss Jiang went back this time because of her brother.”

Jiang Luoli’s brother?

Mo Shixiu knew.

He nodded. “Continue.”

“Yes.” Assistant Xu thought for a while and immediately said, “Miss Jiang’s brother owes someone a sum of money and was locked up in the police station. Her parents called her to ask her to pay his debt.”
