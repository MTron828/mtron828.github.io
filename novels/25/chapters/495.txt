Chapter 496: I’ll Keep a Distance From Them

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

The ice in his eyes was melting quickly. He tightened his grip around her waist and asked, “What about Director Bai?”

“Director Bai?” Qiao Mianmian just realized that she’d mentioned him. She secretly cursed at Mo Yesi’s petty nature but kept a sweet smile on. “Of course, I admire you best.

“Director Bai is really talented, but he’s definitely not as good as you.”

Anyway, Bai Yusheng wasn’t around. It was alright to say that here, right?

All she wanted to do now was to humor this man.

“What about Tu Yilei?” The man was already smiling. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Qiao Mianmian quietly sighed in relief when she saw that this iceberg was warming up.

She’d done well.

Mo Yesi was really just a jealous lover, but he wasn’t hard to coax.

She just had to shower him with praises.

“Tu Yilei? It’s the first time I met him, and it was less than a minute. I just think he has a pretty nice personality.” Seeing that he was almost frowning again, she quickly added, “But like you said, he’s just an outsider to me, and all I’m seeing is a front. I don’t know what he really is like. Perhaps his friendliness is all an act.”

With that, Qiao Mianmian saw his brows ease out.

Mo Yesi placed a hand on her head. “Mm, so you’ve got to keep a distance from them. Don’t judge a book by its cover, you can never be too cautious about people you don’t know. Especially men in the entertainment industry, they’re known for being very casual about relationships. They might like a woman today and fall for another tomorrow. You’re young and innocent and haven’t seen the world yet. You’re an easy target for them.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

Was he really worried that she’d be cheated, or was he scaring her because he didn’t want her getting too close to them?

Whatever it was, it was best to heed him.

“Mm, I got it!” Qiao Mianmian nodded as if she’d really learned from it. “I’ll keep a distance from them.”

Mo Yesi was very satisfied with her answer and ruffled her hair a little. “Remember, besides your husband, every other man who gets close to you has a personal agenda. Don’t bother about them.

“And if anyone harasses you or bothers you, just let me know. I’ll settle it for you.”

Qiao Mianmian said, “... Okay, I got it.”

He was happy to see that she was so obedient.

“Ahem! Young Master... are we heading to the office next?”

Uncle Li was getting used to this sort of intimacy in the backseat.

Mo Yesi looked at Qiao Mianmian endearingly. “Are you heading to school? If you are, I’ll send you there.”

Qiao Mianmian thought for a while and then shook her head. “I don’t have other classes in the morning. I’ll be filming in three days, I think I’ll have to head to school later in the afternoon to apply for leave. I’ll take the next few days to familiarize myself with the script.”

“Then, you’ll head back to the office with me first?” Mo Yesi seemed to be asking for her opinion, but before she even responded, he said to Uncle Li, “To the office.”
