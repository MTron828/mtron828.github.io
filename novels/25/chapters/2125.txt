Chapter 2127: Why Are You Still Pretending to Be Innocent!

“It’s my fault. I thought that even if we’re not related by blood, since we’ve lived together for so many years, we’re better than blood-related relatives. I only now realize that outsiders are still outsiders. It’s impossible for us to be a family.

“Did you see that? This is how you raised your daughter. You raised an ingrate.”

Lin Huizhen could tell that it was useless to use Father Qiao to plead for Qiao Anxin.

She was so passionate and nice at first because she needed help.

She still wanted to get some benefits from Qiao Mianmian.

But now, she knew that this wasn’t realistic.

Thus, she stopped trying to please her and started crying.

Father Qiao was in a good mood before, but now that things had turned out this way, how could he still be in the mood to enjoy his birthday? Hearing Lin Huizhen and Qiao Anxin’s cries, he slammed his palm on the table. “Enough, stop making a scene.”

But Lin Huizhen and Qiao Anxin cried even louder.

“Husband, are you going to watch outsiders bully your daughter?” Lin Huizhen was tearing up. “You heard what they said. If they respected you, would they say such things?

“They’re already bullying Anxin in front of you. Aren’t you going to do something about it?”

“I’ve said enough, stop crying.” Father Qiao was so angry that his chest was heaving. “You all said you wanted to celebrate my birthday, is this how you do it? I think all of you want to anger me to death.”

“Dad.” Qiao Mianmian saw that Father Qiao was so angry that his face had turned green. A little worried about his health, she walked over to support him.

“Dad, I’m sorry.” Qiao Mianmian hadn’t expected things to turn out this way. “It’s all our fault for ruining your birthday.”

“Qiao Mianmian, stop pretending to be a good person.” Qiao Anxin’s eyes were red with hatred. “What are you pretending for? You’re the daughter of the Bai family now, do you still think highly of the Qiao family?

“If you weren’t afraid of others calling you ungrateful, you’d probably want to cut ties with our Qiao family immediately.

“Ask yourself, do you still think the Qiao family is your family?

“You did this on purpose. Why are you still pretending to be innocent!”

Qiao Mianmian slowly turned to look at her expressionlessly. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Qiao Anxin met her gaze and felt a little guilty.

But she refused to admit it. “Am I wrong? You’re not a relative. I used to think that we were at least from the same father. But now, you have nothing to do with the Qiao family anymore.

“You’d better go back and be a rich young lady. Don’t pretend to be sentimental.”

“Anxin, shut up.” Father Qiao’s chest was heaving. “I know what kind of person your sister is. Don’t talk nonsense anymore.”

“Dad, am I wrong? She’s the daughter of the Bai family, not the Qiao family! With her biological parents’ love, you’re nothing.

“Does she still take your words seriously?”
