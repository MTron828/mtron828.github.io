Chapter 1875: Hide Her Somewhere

“Sigh, there’s only one way to resolve this matter. But Madam definitely won’t bear to do that.”

“What is it?” Madam Mo immediately grabbed Tang Ya’s hand and asked anxiously, “Xiao Ya, tell me, what can I do to make that poor girl leave Shixiu? As long as she leaves him, I’ll do anything.”

“Well...” Tang Ya hesitated. “Forget it, I don’t want to say it. I don’t want to ruin Madam’s relationship with Mr. Mo, nor do I want Madam to do something evil.”

“Something evil?” Madam Mo was stunned. Then, she seemed to have thought of something and her expression changed. “Xiao Ya, what exactly are you talking about? I only trust you now. Don’t have any scruples. Tell me everything you think of. Whether I do it or not, it’s up to me. It has nothing to do with you.

“No matter what happens in the end, I won’t blame you.”

“Madam...” Tang Ya bit the corner of her lower lip. “I think Mr. Mo’s sudden marriage with Miss Jiang has a lot to do with her pregnancy. If Miss Jiang didn’t have a child, Mr. Mo wouldn’t have gotten married so early. I can tell that Mr. Mo is a very responsible person. When the child is born, I’m afraid he won’t let Miss Jiang and the child leave him.

“So, if Madam really wants them to separate, then we can’t let that child be born. But... that’s the Mo Family’s bloodline, and the child is innocent, so I don’t recommend Madam to do this. I think... Madam won’t be able to be so ruthless.”

Madam Mo wasn’t surprised by Tang Ya’s words.

Because she had already thought about it.

She was silent for a long time.

If it was to deal with Jiang Luoli, she had no hesitation.

But now, Jiang Luoli was pregnant with the Mo Family’s bloodline.

No matter how much Madam Mo disliked her, she couldn’t bear to do something like harming her own bloodline.

After a moment of hesitation, Tang Ya said gently, “Madam, just pretend that I didn’t say anything. I think you should accept Miss Jiang slowly. I think Mr. Mo really likes her. If you touch Miss Jiang, your relationship with your son will be affected.

“I wasn’t thinking clearly just now, that’s why I said some things I shouldn’t have. Madam, don’t take it to heart. This matter will end here.”

Madam Mo hadn’t made up her mind to get rid of the child.

However, she couldn’t accept Jiang Luoli just like that.

She hated her deeply.

“Accept that poor girl? That’s impossible in this lifetime. She’s pregnant with the Mo family’s bloodline, so the child cannot be touched. However, I will never accept her being together with Shixiu.”

Tang Ya stayed silent for a while and then hesitantly said, “Madam, there’s another way.” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“What way?”

“If Madam wants to keep the child, it’s not impossible. Find a place to hide her so that Mr. Mo can’t find her. Then, get someone to watch over her and wait for her to give birth. As for how to deal with the child after its born, that will depend on Madam.”

Madam Mo was stunned. She raised her head abruptly and her eyes lit up. “Xiao Ya, your idea is not bad. This way, not only can we separate her from Shixiu, but we can also let her give birth to our Mo family’s bloodline.”
