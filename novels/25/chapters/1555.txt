Chapter 1556: I Don’t Have a Place in That Home Anymore

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

She turned around and looked at Jiang Luoli coldly before walking into the house.

Jiang Luoli stood rooted to the ground.

Father Jiang tried to persuade her again. “You know your mom’s personality. Your brother has been detained at the police station for a few days, and we can’t get him out. Your mom’s heart aches for your brother, so she doesn’t know what to say.

“But she doesn’t really think that way.”

Jiang Luoli knew what her parents were like.

It was precisely because she knew that she felt sad.

She knew very well that even this little bit of warmth was because of Jiang Hai.

...

On the other side.

Madam Mo sat in the cafe and picked up the call.

A young man’s voice came from the phone. “Madam, Jiang Luoli has been called back to her hometown by the Jiang family. Our plan is going smoothly. She definitely won’t be able to pay her brother’s debt. When the Jiang family is desperate, they will definitely agree to our conditions.

“Moreover, Jiang Luoli’s parents don’t care much about her. I can guarantee that as long as their son is released from the police station, they will agree to anything.”

“That’s good.” Madam Mo held a cup of coffee in her hand and leaned against the sofa cushion behind her. She pursed her lips and said, “Everything will go according to the original plan. But I’m afraid that if she talks to Shixiu, he’ll be smitten by her. What if I help her return the money?”

“Madam, don’t worry. Jiang Luoli doesn’t have a good relationship with her parents. Her parents favored boys over girls since she was young, so she must be unhappy with her parents. Moreover, we found out that she’s a very headstrong girl. She definitely won’t talk to Young Master.”

Madam Mo smiled coldly. “It’d be best if that’s the case. These shameless vixens are seducing my sons one after another. I won’t let this Jiang girl succeed. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“This time, you have to settle this.”

“Madam, don’t worry. We won’t let you down.”

Madam Mo had just hung up when her cell phone rang again.

She saw that it was her husband, Mo Yunchen, and picked it up.

“Wenpei, where are you now? I heard from Mom that you had a conflict with her and left home. Is this true?”

Madam Mo’s expression darkened. “Did Mom complain to you? Did you call me to help Mom teach me a lesson?”

“Wenpei, don’t be so unreasonable. Mom is old, can’t you be more tolerant? Why are you arguing with her? Also, you’re already so old, why are you still running away from home? Go back immediately and apologize to Mom. Don’t be so willful anymore.”

Madam Mo already felt aggrieved over this matter. Not only did her husband, who always doted on her, not console her, but he even criticized her now. She felt even more aggrieved.

She got angry.

She growled. “Mo Yunchen, I won’t go back. I don’t have a place in that family anymore, why should I go back? What do you mean I’m willful? Do you know how much I’ve suffered? All these years, I’ve tolerated Mom enough. But she’d rather be biased towards a few outsiders than take me as her daughter-in-law. I won’t go back, nor will I apologize to her. I didn’t do anything wrong, why should I apologize?”
