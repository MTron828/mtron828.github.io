Chapter 775: Other Than the Bai Family, There’s Only the Mo Family

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

With that in mind, Huang Yilin gave Yan Shaoqing a call.

It rang for a while before it was picked up.

The man’s lazy voice could be heard. “Baby, you miss me?”

Huang Yilin was about to speak when she heard a woman’s laughter.

She couldn’t help but ask, “Young Master Yan, where are you now?”

“Why?” Yan Shaoqing didn’t answer her. His voice was still lazy and casual. “You miss me and want to look for me?”

Huang Yilin was speechless.

She pursed her lips, and her expression darkened.

She didn’t believe that Yan Shaoqing wouldn’t know about it.

But he didn’t say a word.

Even when she was with Yan Shaoqing, it was only because he was rich and powerful. She didn’t have much sincerity towards him.

But she couldn’t bear to be ignored by him like this.

“Young Master Yan, I need your help with something.”

The woman’s laughter came from the other end of the line. Huang Yilin took a deep breath and said, “I’ve encountered some trouble. I hope you can help me.”

“Oh?” Yan Shaoqing smiled. “What is it?”

“Someone posted my scandals on Weibo, and we can’t delete them now. This might be Bai Yusheng’s doing. I know you have some friendship with him, can you...”

“Help you? Get him to let you off?”

Before she could finish, Yan Shaoqing chuckled. “How did you offend him?”

Huang Yilin said angrily, “It wasn’t me who offended him. It was a newbie in our production team who didn’t get along with me. Bai Yusheng took a liking to her and wanted to stand up for her.”

“Who’s the newbie you’re talking about?”

“Her name is Qiao Mianmian.” Huang Yilin gritted her teeth at the mention of Qiao Mianmian. “She caught Bai Yusheng’s eye the moment she arrived.”

Yan Shaoqing kept quiet for a while.

When he spoke again, his tone seemed a little colder. “Bai Yusheng will never fall for this newbie.”

“Why? Everyone in the crew knows...”

“Huang Yilin, you still haven’t figured out who you’ve offended. Do you think you’ve offended Bai Yusheng?” Yan Shaoqing suddenly sneered. “Seeing that you’ve been with me for a while, I might as well let you know.”

Huang Yilin suddenly had a bad premonition, and her face turned pale. “Know... what?”

Yan Shaoqing said coldly, “You did suffer this because of Qiao Mianmian. But the person behind her isn’t Bai Yusheng. That person is much more powerful than Bai Yusheng. I can’t help you even if I wanted to.”

Huang Yilin’s expression immediately changed.

“Young Master Yan, who... is this person you’re talking about?” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Even Yan Shaoqing couldn’t do anything about it?

Who else in Yuncheng City had more power than the Yan family?

Besides the Bai family, there was only the Mo family left.

Mo family?!!

Huang Yilin widened her eyes in disbelief.

Impossible.

She quickly rejected this thought.

Impossible.

Qiao Mianmian’s backing definitely wasn’t from the Mo family.

The Mo family was one of the most powerful families in Yuncheng City.
