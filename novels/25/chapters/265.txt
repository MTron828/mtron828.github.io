Chapter 268: She Was Different From Imagined

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

It was Shen Rou’s voice.

Maybe because there was no immediate answer, another knock sounded on the door. “Mianmian, I have a few things to say to you. Can I come in and talk to you?”

Without waiting for Qiao Mianmian’s reply, she pushed open the bedroom door with a “click”.

Shen Rou walked in from outside.

When she saw Qiao Mianmian lying on the bed with her eyes open, she frowned and said in a somewhat displeased tone, “I thought you were asleep, but you’re not.”

Qiao Mianmian originally didn’t have any opinion on the woman with a crush on her husband.

It was true that Shen Rou knew Mo Yesi first.

They had a few years of relationship.

Furthermore, she was clear that Mo Yesi had no such intentions toward Shen Rou and just treated her as a friend.

It wasn’t worthwhile for her to be jealous or envious.

However, she was a little unhappy that Shen Rou had entered the bedroom without her permission.

She was a prestigious lady, after all.

Without seeking approval, she shouldn’t have casually entered someone else’s bedroom. This was a rule she should already be clear about.

Besides, she came back with Mo Yesi today.

Was it really okay to enter the room of a couple so casually?

Such behavior made Qiao Mianmian feel like she was quite impolite.

Her expression was a little displeased, and she said in a not-so-polite voice, “Miss Shen, I don’t think I agreed to you coming in. You shouldn’t enter someone else’s room so casually. Such behavior is very rude.”

Shen Rou had always thought of Qiao Mianmian as soft and weak.

Like someone easy to bully.

After being criticized so blatantly, Shen Rou was stunned for a moment, before smiling apologetically. “Sorry, I knocked on the door just now, but I thought you didn’t hear it, so I came in without permission.”

Although she apologized, Qiao Mianmian didn’t see a hint of apology in her eyes.

She didn’t intend on accepting this kind of insincere apology.

“Since you knocked on the door and I didn’t tell you to come in, it meant that it wasn’t convenient for you to do so. Miss Shen, you should be aware of that.” She was rather discourteous as she continued, “Miss Shen, I was sleeping. You disturbed me.” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Shen Rou still maintained an elegant and decent smile on her face, but after being embarrassed so many times, the smile almost faded.

She suddenly realized that Qiao Mianmian was different from how she imagined.

“Miss Shen, I still have to sleep.” Qiao Mianmian looked up and glanced at her. “Excuse me, but please leave. Oh, and remember to close the door when you go out.”

The smile on Shen Rou’s face froze.

Her eyes darkened and her smile faded. When she spoke again, her tone had changed. “Miss Qiao, I have a few words to say to you. I’ll naturally leave after speaking. I think you’re not in a rush to sleep right now, right?”

After hearing her change of tone, Qiao Mianmian sighed inwardly at what was about to come.

Shen Rou was very hostile to her. It would be abnormal if she really held back without doing anything.

It seemed like Shen Rou couldn’t hold it back anymore.

This Young Lady Shen wasn’t very patient.

Qiao Mianmian wanted to hear what she would say, so she nodded. “Okay, what is it?”

Pursing her lips, Shen Rou’s hostile eyes fell on her reddish lips. She stared at it for a few seconds, her eyes cold. “I presume that Miss Qiao already knows of Ah Si’s strange problem. He can’t touch women casually, or he’ll have an allergic reaction.”
