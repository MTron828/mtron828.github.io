Chapter 766: Mianmian, Do You Want to Be the Female Lead?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“I’m very clear about that guy’s character. I’ll just treat it as if he was farting last night. Also, it’s fun to see him so angry. After all, he didn’t even have a change in expression for the past year. It’s really boring.

“He’s a little more human now.

“I never expected him to end up like this. Ha...”

Qiao Mianmian was stunned. She suddenly recalled what Mo Yesi told her last night.

Back then, she was still angry and didn’t take it to heart.

After a few more rounds, she fell asleep on the bed.

So much so that she forgot all about it.

Now that Bai Yusheng mentioned it, she recalled everything.

“Brother Bai, have you known my boyfriend for a long time? Actually, you two are friends.” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Mm, I guess so.” Bai Yusheng narrowed his eyes and thought for a while. “I’ve known him for five to six years.”

“...”

Qiao Mianmian frowned slightly. “Then, your relationship should be pretty good?”

“It’s alright.” Bai Yusheng turned to look at her and smiled. “He told you everything?”

“Mm.”

Qiao Mianmian nodded. “He said it last night. But he said you didn’t know each other...”

“Mm, he didn’t want you to think that you got this role because of him.”

“If I got this role...”

“It has something to do with him, but the outcome has nothing to do with him.” Bai Yusheng thought for a while and said, “Before you came for the audition, he told me about it. I owe him a favor. I thought that as long as you weren’t too bad, I could arrange a role for you.

“But the moment I saw you, I knew I’d taken advantage of him.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

Bai Yusheng looked at her and said, “You’re the third female lead that I want. So, even if he didn’t inform me beforehand, this role would still be yours.”

Alright.

Qiao Mianmian felt better hearing that.

If Mo Yesi was the one who got her this role, she might start to doubt herself.

“So, the person who asked you to take care of me was actually him, not Yan Shaoqing?”

“Mm... I’m not very familiar with Young Master Yan.”

“Then, why did you call me, Brother Bai?”

After finding out about Bai Yusheng and Mo Yesi’s relationship, Qiao Mianmian wasn’t so worried anymore.

Since they’d known each other for years, Bai Yusheng shouldn’t mind what happened last night.

“Mm, there’s something.” Bai Yusheng took out a pack of cigarettes from his pocket and lit one up. “Do you mind if I smoke?”

Qiao Mianmian shook her head.

“Mianmian, do you want to be the female lead?” Bai Yusheng turned around and exhaled the smoke.

He asked casually.

Qiao Mianmian was shocked. “Female lead?”

“Mm.” The cigarette between his fingers lit up, and he looked up at her. “If there’s a chance for you to be the female lead, do you want to? Tell me what you think.”

“I...”

Qiao Mianmian was a little stunned by his sudden question.

She felt that Bai Yusheng wouldn’t ask such a question for no reason.

Especially since the female lead was Huang Yilin.
