Chapter 1101: Old Madam Was Biased

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Even when Qiao Mianmian brought Qiao Chen over for dinner, she felt that Qiao Mianmian was plotting something.

She brought a younger brother who looked like the second son of the Mo Family over. Was she trying to use this younger brother of hers to gain the favor of the Old Madam so that she could consolidate her position in the Mo Family?

Because she had talked to her once before.

Hence, she felt a sense of danger. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Anyway, Madam Mo had already decided that Qiao Mianmian was a scheming woman.

In her eyes, Qiao Mianmian was always scheming.

Madam Mo sat at the side with a cold expression, not saying a word.

No matter what Qiao Mianmian did, she had to chase this scheming woman out of the Mo family.

“Wenpei.”

The old lady turned around and saw Madam Mo’s cold face. Her expression darkened, and she said unhappily, “When Ah Si wasn’t at home, you sighed every day. Now that our son is back with his daughter-in-law, why are you so quiet?

“This family is so happy. Why are you pulling a long face? Who made you unhappy? Why are you putting on such an expression now?”

When the Old Madam reprimanded Madam Mo, she wasn’t polite at all.

She did not give her any face.

Madam Mo felt like she had lost all face after being reprimanded in public. Her expression immediately turned ugly.

But the person who reprimanded her was the Old Madam.

Other than listening, she did not dare to retort.

She put on an aggrieved expression as if she was being bullied. “Mom, I’m not pulling a long face. I just don’t know what to say when I see how happy you two are chatting.”

The old lady snorted. “I don’t care what you think. Anyway, my grandson and granddaughter-in-law are back, so you’re not allowed to keep a straight face for me. If you’re unhappy or feel uncomfortable staying here, go back to your room.

“No one here likes to see you scowl.”

Madam Mo pursed her lips, her face ashen.

She felt wronged and angry.

She felt that the Old Madam was biased.

She was so harsh to her daughter-in-law, but she treated Qiao Mianmian very well.

As if she were her own granddaughter.

Even Qiao Mianmian being an actress, she didn’t say anything.

However, the Old Madam had previously told her that women needed to stay at home obediently to provide for their husbands and children and that she should try her best not to show her face.

Was being an actress not enough to show her face?!

If she wanted to be an actress, the Old Madam would definitely not allow it.

Madam Mo was furious and dissatisfied with the old lady’s double standards.

However, no matter how angry and unhappy she was, she did not dare to show it, much less throw a tantrum at the Old Madam.

The Old Madam was the Mo Family’s ancestor and had absolute authority.

Even her husband did not dare to disobey her, let alone her.

Qiao Chen watched from the side and had a basic understanding of the Old Madam and Madam Mo.

It seemed that not everyone in his brother-in-law’s family liked his sister.

This Madam Mo seemed to dislike his sister and him.

Even though Qiao Chen was young, he was still sensitive in certain aspects and could sense Madam Mo’s hostility.

Since ancient times, the relationship between mother and daughter-in-law was not easy to handle.

His sister was no exception.

But Qiao Chen wasn’t worried that Madam Mo would make Qiao Mianmian angry.

With his brother-in-law’s protection and this old lady’s protection, his sister would probably not suffer any grievances.

And Qiao Chen knew Qiao Mianmian well.

His sister was definitely not the kind of person who would remain silent even when someone bullied her.
