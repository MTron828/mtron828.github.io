Chapter 1797: Aren’t You Guys Like This?

The only advantage of this remote mountain village was that it had a concrete road that led directly to the town.

It took about half an hour to get to the town.

When they arrived, Qiao Mianmian realized that the town was really unique. The buildings were all built in an ancient style. And because of the Lantern Festival, lanterns were hung all over the town early.

In this way, when the sky darkened, the lanterns would light up one by one, making it especially beautiful.

The town had a lot of specialty dishes, too.

They looked at the food, but no one bought anything.

Whether it was Little Xiao, Song Ke, Zhan Bo, and the others, they were very strict about their figures. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Qiao Mianmian wanted to buy it, but seeing that no one was buying it, she was too embarrassed to do it alone.

They shopped on the streets and finally chose a soup pot restaurant that suited their tastes.

As there weren’t many celebrities in town, no one recognized them. They chose a seat by the window in the lobby.

But when the boss came over with the menu, he sized them up.

It wasn’t that the boss recognized them as celebrities. It was just that they were too good-looking.

“Take a look and see what you want to eat.” Shen Fei took the menu and ordered a pot, handing it to the others.

“You guys do it. I’ll just eat something later.” Song Ke didn’t eat at night. She came out just because everyone else came, too. She looked at the menu and then handed it to Little Xiao.

Little Xiao was the same. She didn’t eat at night, and if she did, it was usually a small amount of fruits and vegetables.

She flipped through the menu and called the boss over.

“Boss, do you have salads?”

The boss didn’t know what a salad was and looked at her in confusion.

“How about this, do you have vegetables here? For example, tomatoes, cucumbers, lettuce, or something along this line? Can you cut it up and put it on a plate?”

Of course, there were vegetables. The boss immediately nodded and went to prepare it.

“Little Xiao, do you only eat vegetable salad at night?” Shen Fei couldn’t help but ask.

“Yes.” Little Xiao reached out and pinched her arm. “You have to maintain your figure. You can’t eat randomly. Aren’t you like this?”

The others nodded in agreement.

Only Zhan Bo took the menu and looked through it seriously before ordering a few dishes.

Qiao Mianmian also ordered a few dishes. When the menu returned to Shen Fei, she also ordered a few dishes.

The rest of them either got the boss to make a vegetable salad or ate fruits.

Shen Fei suddenly felt that she shouldn’t have called so many people out for dinner.

Eating with people who only ate vegetables and fruits didn’t seem good.

Thankfully, Zhan Bo and Qiao Mianmian didn’t seem to need to diet. Otherwise, it would be too boring for her to eat alone.

After a while, the dishes were served.

The others all ate like rabbits. Hungry, Qiao Mianmian seriously boiled the soup in the pot. She had no intention of dieting.

“Sister Mianmian, y-you don’t need to diet?” Su Mufei couldn’t help but ask.
