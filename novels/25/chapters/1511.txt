Chapter 1513: This Moment Was Like a Picture

“I should be the one apologizing.” Gong Zeli smiled bitterly. “If I hadn’t been biased against you, things wouldn’t have become like this. Since you’re not used to being with me, I’ll get someone to bring you to them.”

With that, he got a housemaid to bring Qiao Mianmian to Xue Shiya’s employees.

“Mr. Gong, I’ll get going then. Enjoy your breakfast.”

Qiao Mianmian saw the disappointment in Gong Zeli’s eyes.

But she really didn’t want to be alone with him.

It wasn’t just because he treated her badly in the past. There were other reasons too.

Qiao Mianmian felt that something was wrong, but she couldn’t pinpoint what.

Anyway, Gong Zeli was acting weird now. She couldn’t just avoid him.Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Soon, the housemaid left with Qiao Mianmian.

There was a lot of food on the table, but Gong Zeli lost his appetite after Qiao Mianmian left.

He was once again filled with regret.

If he hadn’t been so biased towards her... if he hadn’t treated her that way... if he’d been like Yan Shaoqing.

Would she treat him differently?

Unfortunately, there was no medicine for regret in this world.

Even if he regretted it now, it wouldn’t make up for the terrible things he’d done.

After Qiao Mianmian left, Gong Zeli lost his appetite.

He threw his fork and knife aside and made a call.

The call went through very quickly. The person who picked up the call greeted him respectfully, “Young Master Gong.”

Gong Zeli narrowed his eyes and asked, “How did you arrange your itinerary today? How long will this commercial take?”

The person on the other end immediately replied, “We’ll be filming at the manor for the entire day. If nothing goes wrong, we’ll be done in two days.”

Gong Zeli hung up.

He turned around and looked at the weather outside. He then called a housemaid over.

“Young Master.”

Gong Zeli thought for a while and said, “It’s hot today. Get someone to send something to the production crew at the manor for the summer heat. Tell them to treat them well and satisfy their needs.”

“Yes, Young Master. I’ll arrange it right away.”

The housemaid left after receiving the task.

Gong Zeli turned to look out the window again.

This was probably the only thing he could do for her.

...

On the other side.

Qiao Mianmian followed the crew to the filming location. It was a backyard in the manor.

It was huge and beautiful, with a few fountain pools.

She changed into the white dress prepared by the crew, and her hair spread out naturally. She followed the director’s instructions and walked into a bush.

She didn’t know that someone was watching her from the window of a small white building beside the garden.

Under the sunlight and the gentle breeze, the fairy-like beautiful girl stood in the midst of the colorful flowers. She was like an angel descending from the sky in her white dress. The sunlight fell around her like a layer of holy light.

She turned around and smiled. Her eyes seemed to be filled with stars.

This scene was as beautiful as a painting.

Gong Zeli stood by the window, mesmerized.

...

The shoot in the morning went smoothly.

During the break, Mo Yesi called.

Qiao Mianmian picked it up.

The man’s low and gentle voice entered her ears. “Is the shoot going smoothly?”
