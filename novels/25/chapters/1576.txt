Chapter 1577: Other than Madam Mo, She Can’t Think of Anyone Else

Jiang Luoli took a deep breath. “Madam Mo, if you want me to leave your son by dealing with my family, then I want to tell you that’s wishful thinking on your part. My relationship with my family isn’t good.

“You got someone to set a trap and capture my brother. This doesn’t affect me at all. I think you should have asked about my family beforehand. Then, you should know what kind of person my brother is. I think it’s good that you got him in jail. After he stays locked up for a few years, maybe he’ll be better when he comes out.”

“Ha, Miss Jiang.” Madam Mo smiled and said, “Miss Jiang, your imagination is really rich. Do you think too highly of yourself? I was worried that you would affect Shixiu’s future, so I asked to see you.

“But then, I thought about it. What’s there to worry about? Shixiu is just new to you. When this novelty wears off, he’ll naturally lose interest in you. Why do I have to spend so much effort on you?

“From what you’re saying, something happened to your brother?” Madam Mo chuckled. “Your brother really makes the family worry. You’re right, he might recover after a few years in jail.”

Jiang Luoli hung up.

Madam Mo said she hadn’t done it.

But Jiang Luoli didn’t believe it.

Besides Madam Mo, she couldn’t think of anyone else.

But if Madam Mo did this, her goal was definitely to separate her from Mo Shixiu.

But Madam Mo didn’t say anything on the phone.

Jiang Luoli felt that perhaps Madam Mo wasn’t behind this.

As Jiang Luoli was worrying about this, she heard footsteps behind her.

It was Mother Jiang and Father Jiang.

Mother Jiang’s expression was no longer as cold as before. There was even a hint of a smile in her eyes, as if she had encountered something joyous.

When she spoke to Jiang Luoli again, her tone was much gentler. “Ah Li, it was my fault just now. Mom shouldn’t have lost her temper at you. Can you forgive Mom? I’m just too worried about your brother.”

Jiang Luoli looked at her in shock.

This was probably the mildest Mother Jiang had treated her in the past two days.

What was wrong with her?

She hated her so much just now.

“Ah Li, are you hungry? I’ll cook for you when we get home, alright? I’ll make your favorite dishes.” Mother Jiang was stunned when she saw Jiang Luoli’s expressionless face. She went forward and grabbed her hand.

Jiang Luoli immediately took her hand back.

Mother Jiang’s expression stiffened.

She took a step back and said calmly, “I’m not hungry, don’t bother.”

Mother Jiang’s expression remained stiff for a few more seconds. She gritted her teeth in hatred, but on the surface, she smiled and said, “How can it be troublesome to cook for your daughter? I remember that you’ve liked the spicy and sour fish I made since you were young. When I get home, I’ll go to the market to buy a fish and cook for you.” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Mother Jiang’s attitude changed too quickly and was overly enthusiastic.

Jiang Luoli looked at her suspiciously.

“Why are you staring at me? Don’t you recognize me?” Mother Jiang felt a little guilty.

“Nothing.” Jiang Luoli looked away and smiled. “Mom, did you forget something?”
