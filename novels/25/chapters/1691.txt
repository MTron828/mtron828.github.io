Chapter 1692: It’s Good to Be Really Disabled

Shen Xin was obedient, pretty, and good in her studies.

Compared to Shen Rou, she was more worrying.

Moreover, Shen Xin had a serious illness when she was young and almost lost her life. Hence, after she recovered, Madam Shen doted on her even more.

Looking at her precious daughter lying on the hospital bed, Madam Shen couldn’t hold back her tears.

She wiped her tears with a handkerchief.

“Mom, it doesn’t hurt.” Shen Xin saw that Madam Shen was crying and felt heartache. “The doctor administered anesthesia, so it doesn’t hurt at all. I’m really fine. Mom, don’t cry anymore.”

“Mom’s heart aches for you.” Madam Shen held her hand and continued crying. “Your leg is broken, how could it not hurt?”

Shen Rou stood behind Madam Shen and sneered.

Madam Shen and Father Shen loved her, too.

But in the end, she couldn’t compare to her sister.

Before the Shen Family fell, she didn’t think much of it.

But when something happened to the family, Father Shen and Madam Shen asked her to go on blind dates.

For the sake of the Shen Family, they didn’t care about her daughter’s happiness at all. Even a pig-headed man was introduced to her.

But Shen Xin.

She was also the daughter of the Shen Family, but they didn’t ask her to do anything.

Their reason was that Shen Xin was still young. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

At this thought, Shen Rou’s eyes became even colder and more mocking.

Shen Xin was still young, they were just biased.

Hence, Shen Rou didn’t feel bad for her sister when she saw Shen Xin lying on the hospital bed with a broken leg.

She even felt a little happy.

If something happened to Shen Xin’s leg, she would be handicapped in the future.

No matter how much Madam Shen and Father Shen doted on her now, they wouldn’t like a disabled daughter anymore.

Shen Rou couldn’t help but think that Shen Xin was really disabled.

“Mom, why don’t you ask how Xiao Xin broke her leg?” Shen Rou looked on coldly for a while and said emotionlessly.

Madam Shen was stunned. “Wasn’t there an accident?”

“It was a car accident.” Shen Rou sneered and looked at Shen Xin mockingly. “But if she wasn’t going to Qiao Chen’s birthday party, this car accident could have been avoided.”

“Qiao Chen?” Madam Shen was stunned again. “Who is this?”

“Mom, you forgot that we attended his banquet together. That Qiao Chen is the Young Master that the Mo Family just acknowledged. He should be called Mo Chen now.”

“So, you’re talking about him...” Madam Shen was stunned for a few seconds before looking down at Shen Xin. “Xiao Xin, is what your sister said true? You got into a car accident on the way to his birthday party?”

Shen Xin looked up and frowned at Shen Rou.

Shen Rou smiled and didn’t avoid her gaze. Instead, she looked at her and continued, “Xiao Xin, this Qiao Chen is your classmate, right? You’ve been deskmates for a few years, so your relationship should be pretty good.

“I asked you to beg him to help our Shen Family. Did he help?”

Shen Xin pursed her lips and kept quiet for a while before saying, “Sister, Qiao Chen isn’t that influential in his family. You know that he has just been acknowledged by the Mo family. He didn’t grow up in the family, so how deep can his relationship with the Mo Family be?”
