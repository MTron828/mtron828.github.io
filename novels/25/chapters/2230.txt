Later, Qiao Mianmian returned to the Mo Residence with Mo Yesi.

Mo Shixiu and Jiang Luoli were already there when they arrived.

Old Madam was holding Jiang Luoli’s hand as they chatted. When Uncle Zhang entered the living room and informed them that they had arrived, Old Madam looked up at them and waved at them with a smile. “You’re back. Was there a traffic jam?”

“Not that bad.” Mo Yesi held Qiao Mianmian’s hand and walked over. He looked at Mo Shixiu standing beside Jiang Luoli and smiled. “Big Brother came back so early today? You were actually one step ahead of us.”

Mo Shixiu nodded. “There was nothing much to do, so I came back early.”

Seeing Qiao Mianmian, Mo Shixiu nodded at her and said, “Sister-in-law.”

“Big Brother, it’s your birthday today. Happy birthday.” Qiao Mianmian took out the gift Mo Yesi had prepared. “This is a little gift from Ah Si and me. I hope Big Brother will like it.”

It was a porcelain set.

Antique porcelain.

Mo Yesi got someone to take a picture of it and send it over from overseas. He said that Mo Shixiu wasn’t interested in luxury cars and mansions but rather liked to study antiques.

Hence, he bought an antique tea set in advance.

Qiao Mianmian was thankful that Mo Yesi had prepared this gift.

If it was her, she would probably give him a belt, watch, or tie.

She knew nothing about antiques.

“Thank you, Sister-in-law.” Mo Shixiu took it.

“Grandma.” Qiao Mianmian greeted her obediently.

Old Madam smiled and nodded. “Come here, girl.”

Qiao Mianmian let go of Mo Yesi’s hand and walked towards Old Madam. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Old Madam reached out and took her hand. She held her hand with one hers and Jiang Luoli’s with the other.

Old Madam was in a good mood as she looked at the two beautiful granddaughters.

Especially since Jiang Luoli was pregnant.

Old Madam was extremely satisfied at the thought of her future great-grandchild.

She had no regrets now.

Her grandsons were already married, and her great-grandchild would be born soon.

Her two precious grandsons’ marriages used to be a huge burden on her heart.

Every time she thought about how her two outstanding grandsons didn’t even have a woman by their side, she felt terrible.

She was most worried about Mo Yesi.

Although Mo Shixiu was also a young man, he was normal and didn’t reject women.

If he met someone he liked in the future, he might get married and have children.

But Mo Yesi…

Physiological rejection of women?

He was already against women, how could he meet a woman he liked?

Old Madam had been so worried about this that she had gotten so many doctors to treat him, but none of them had been able to cure him.

Old Madam was so anxious that she couldn’t sleep every night.

Back then, Old Madam thought that as long as Mo Yesi found a woman he liked in the future, she would accept her no matter who it was.

Hence, when Mo Yesi brought Qiao Mianmian home, Old Madam accepted her immediately.

Because Qiao Mianmian was a better granddaughter-in-law than she’d imagined.

Besides her family background, Old Madam was very satisfied with everything else.

Old Madam was willing to accept Mo Yesi finding an ordinary girl.

Moreover, Qiao Mianmian’s appearance wasn’t ordinary at all.
