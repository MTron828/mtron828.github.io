Chapter 469: Then Why Do You Smell So Nice?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Shen Rou looked awful. A ball of anger and jealousy rose inside her.

She glared at Gong Zeli and then turned around to look at Yan Shaoqing. “Fine, none of you want to leave? I’ll leave on my own!”

With that, she dashed out of the private room.

“Rourou, wait up!” Yan Shaoqing hit Gong Zeli on the shoulder when he saw that Shen Rou had left the private room. “Fourth Bro, what’s with you? Rourou is mad now, you’d better chase her.”

Gong Zeli’s current state really troubled Yan Shaoqing.

He was out of himself.

Usually, all his attention was on Shen Rou whenever she was around.

Besides Shen Rou, everyone else was practically invisible to him.

But just now, even Shen Rou hadn’t managed to snap him out of his daze.

It was no wonder that Shen Rou left so suddenly.

Could he really have been entranced by Sis-in-law’s beauty?

Gong Zeli finally snapped out of his daze from that pat on the back. He took his eyes off Qiao Mianmian.

“Rourou left?” Gong Zeli only just realized it.

Yan Shaoqing was speechless.

“Did you not hear me talk to you just now? Rourou is mad at you, hurry up and chase her.”

Gong Zeli was shocked. “Mad at me?”

“Who else if not you? You ignored her when she spoke to you, so she left in a fit of anger.”

With that, Gong Zeli quickly went after Shen Rou.

But he stopped at the door.

He turned around and looked at Qiao Mianmian straight in the eye. He hesitated for a split second, and then said, “Miss Qiao, can I ask you a question?”

Qiao Mianmian turned to look at him in shock.

No way.

Did she just hallucinate?

Gong Zeli addressed her as Miss Qiao? And he sounded so polite?

He used to call her by her full name in a harsh and rude tone.

Why had he become so different today?

Did the sun rise in the West this morning?

Qiao Mianmian nodded, on account of his politeness. “Sure.”

Gong Zeli looked at her for a while, then asked, “Can you tell me what perfume you use?”

Qiao Mianmian was slightly confused.

Yan Shaoqing was completely bewildered.

What was this guy trying to do?!

Gong Zeli didn’t say anything more after that as he waited for Qiao Mianmian’s response.

Qiao Mianmian was stunned for a few seconds.

She thought Gong Zeli asked this because he wanted to get a gift for a girl. She thought about it very seriously and said, “I don’t use perfume, so I can’t answer you.”

“You don’t? Then why do you smell so nice?”

There was no response. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Everyone went silent when he said that.

Yan Shaoqing widened his eyes and grabbed Gong Zeli’s arm. He tried to lower his volume as he said, “Fourth Bro, what’s wrong with you! Qiao Mianmian is our Sis-in-law, what are you saying.”

It sounded ambiguous for a guy to tell a girl something like that.

And it was even more inappropriate if the girl was already attached.
