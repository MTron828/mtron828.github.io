Chapter 1079: I Don’t Want to Stay Calm, I Want to Kiss You

“The Shen family can’t wait much longer.”

This news was like a bolt from the blue to Shen Rou.

Recalling the text message she had just received, her heart sank bit by bit as if she had fallen into an icehouse.

...

By the time Qiao Mianmian and Mo Yesi finished watching the movie, it was already 10:30 PM.

Qiao Mianmian thought about flying back to F City the next day. After watching the movie, they didn’t do anything else and just drove home.

On the way back, Qiao Mianmian sent Jiang Luoli a WeChat message.

She waited for more than ten minutes, but Jiang Luoli still didn’t reply.

Qiao Mianmian was a little worried and called again.

The phone rang four or five times before it connected.

Qiao Mianmian opened her mouth, but before she could say “hello”, she heard a man’s voice. “Hello, is this Jiang Luoli’s friend? She’s drunk now and can’t answer the call. Is there something you need?”

Qiao Mianmian: “!!!”

This was... Mo Shixiu’s voice?!

She took her phone away and looked at the time. She couldn’t help but feel shocked as she brought the phone back to her ear. “Is Luo Luo drunk? Is she with you now?”

Mo Shixiu’s low and cold voice came over. “Yes, she’s with me.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

“Miss, why are you looking for her? It’s not convenient for her to pick up now, but you can tell me. When she wakes up, I’ll pass it to her.”

Jiang Luoli saved Qiao Mianmian’s contact number in her contact list. Her name was “Baby”.

Qiao Mianmian guessed that Mo Shixiu didn’t recognize her voice and didn’t know who she was.

She hesitated for a moment and whispered, “Erm, Big Brother... it’s me.”

She felt that Mo Shixiu definitely didn’t know who she was, so she added, “I’m Qiao Mianmian.”

A few seconds of silence later, Mo Shixiu’s voice rang again. “Sister-in-law, do you know Miss Jiang?”

Qiao Mianmian nodded. “We’re from the same school and dormitory. We’re best friends too.”

Mo Shixiu was silent for a while.

Qiao Mianmian opened her mouth and was about to speak when she heard a familiar voice on the phone. “Mo Shixiu, are we home yet? Can I kiss you now? Aiya, why are you hiding? You promised me that I could kiss you. Come here quickly.”

Qiao Mianmian: “!!!”

Wasn’t that Jiang Luoli’s voice?

But how did her Luo Luo’s voice become so delicate, so soft, and so seductive...

Also, what did she just hear?

She seemed to have heard her Luo Luo say that she wanted to kiss Mo Shixiu?!

Did she hear wrongly?!

Qiao Mianmian was stunned.

Mo Shixiu’s panicked voice came from the phone again. “Miss Jiang, don’t be like this. Go down, go down quickly. You can’t do this...”

“No, I don’t want to go down. Mo Shixiu, I want to hug and kiss you. Don’t hide. Why are you hiding?”

“Miss Jiang, calm down...”

“I don’t want to calm down. I want to kiss you.”

“Get down!”

“I don’t wanna. Let me kiss you. How can you be so petty!”

“Jiang Luoli!” Mo Shixiu sounded a little annoyed. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Jiang Luoli smiled. “Darling, call me Darling.”
