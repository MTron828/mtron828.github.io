Chapter 2768: Investigate Someone

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

A few seconds later, after seeing what the netizens were discussing, Qiao Mianmian’s expression didn’t change. She still smiled and said, “So, everyone is talking about this. If you ask me what I think, I don’t have any opinion.

“I think this is very normal. There are many people in this world who look alike.”

In the live stream, the netizens were discussing “Little Qiao Mianmian”.

They saw Qiao Mianmian and asked her if she knew about this and what she thought of Jiang Xinyue.

Of course, Qiao Mianmian wouldn’t say her true thoughts.

She hadn’t seen Jiang Xinyue in person.

Hence, she wasn’t sure what kind of person Jiang Xinyue was and if she had any ulterior motives.

Moreover, she couldn’t possibly say it on a public platform even if she minded it.

Unless her brain was damaged.

“Mianbao, you’re too magnanimous. That woman is obviously trying to ride on your popularity. You don’t mind, but we fans are just angry and don’t like her!”

“That’s right, she can rely on her own efforts to become famous. Using this method to gain popularity is shameless!”

“I hate Jiang Xinyue, I hate her!”

“What Little Qiao Mianmian? I think she’s not even comparable to Mianmian’s toe! It’s not glorious even if she becomes famous in this way. Besides being scolded, what else can she get!”

The handsome man in luxurious clothes looked at the comments on the live stream and frowned. He made a call.

“Come in,” the man said.

The door opened, and a man in a gray suit entered. He looked at the handsome man sitting in the black leather chair and greeted him respectfully. “Chairman Gong.”

“Investigate someone immediately.” Gong Zeli narrowed his eyes.

The man’s heart skipped a beat, and a layer of cold sweat broke out on his forehead. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

It seemed like Chairman Gong was in a bad mood.

As long as Chairman Gong was in a bad mood, the entire Gong Corporation would be afraid.

Of course, that included him.

Even though he’d been Gong Zeli’s assistant for many years, he’d always been afraid of his eccentric boss.

“The person Chairman Gong wants to investigate is…” the assistant asked cautiously.

“A woman called Jiang Xinyue from the entertainment industry.” Thinking of the comments he saw in the live stream, he frowned again and said, “I want to know the details about her in 10 minutes. Go out and check it now.”

…

In less than 10 minutes, the assistant found out about Jiang Xinyue.

He reported everything to Gong Zeli.

Gong Zeli frowned. “Is she a new artiste signed by the Gong Corporation?”

“Yes. And I heard that this newbie was personally signed by Manager Su. Manager Su is prepared to groom her.”

Su Ze signed her?

Gong Zeli narrowed his eyes. “Call Su Ze and tell him to come here.”

“Yes, Chairman Gong.”

…

Su Ze was a little shocked when he found out that Gong Zeli was looking for him.

He wasn’t at the Gong Corporation every day.

The entertainment company under the Gong Corporation was located elsewhere. Su Ze would come over once a month to report on the revenue..
