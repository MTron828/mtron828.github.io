Chapter 797: Did I Meet An Ugly Person?

“Also, although I was dizzy and couldn’t see what that man looked like, my intuition told me that he should be rather handsome and his figure seems pretty good. I remember feeling his muscles.”

“Luo Luo...”

Qiao Mianmian didn’t know how to console her anymore.

Any girl would feel terrible about this.

Although Jiang Luoli sounded nonchalant, how could she not care?

Even if they didn’t see their first time as more important than their lives, they still wanted to give it to the person they liked.

Not to a stranger.

Qiao Mianmian suddenly felt that she and Jiang Luoli shared the same fate.

Because they had the same experience.

The first time was given to a stranger.

She couldn’t remember what the man looked like that night.

And the funny thing was that she was taken away after drinking too.

She never expected that her best friend would end up in the same situation.

“Actually, if my first time was with a handsome man with a good figure and money, I wouldn’t mind too.” Jiang Luoli kept quiet for a while before saying jokingly, “You know that I’m a good-looking person. As long as the other party is handsome, I won’t feel disadvantaged.

“But that man’s skills were terrible.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

Jiang Luoli clenched her teeth and said, “It’s really hopeless. Besides using brute force, I don’t know anything else. Damn it, I’m still in so much pain. Didn’t you say that doing that with a man is a very happy thing? Why don’t I feel it at all?

“Besides the pain, it still hurts. So, it can only be that his technique is too lousy?

“I’m even wondering if it was his first time too. If it was, it seems like I really didn’t lose out.”

“Luo Luo, don’t be like this. Where are you now? I’ll go look for you.”

“Look for me?” Jiang Luoli smiled. “Aren’t you filming? Why are you looking for me? Forget it, it’s actually nothing. I just feel a little aggrieved. After all, I don’t even know what that person looks like.

“If I slept with an ugly guy, I’d be at a disadvantage.”

Qiao Mianmian turned to look out the window and decided to look for Jiang Luoli first.

“Luo Luo, I’m in Yuncheng City now. Tell me, where are you? I’ll come and find you immediately.”

“You’re in Yuncheng City?” Jiang Luoli was shocked. “Aren’t you filming in F City?”

“Mm, but I couldn’t do it today, so I took a day off.”

Jiang Luoli kept quiet for a while and then sighed. “Although I do want to see you now, I guess you’re coming back to look for Prince Charming. I’m fine. Really. I can eat and sleep, it doesn’t affect me at all.

“Don’t bother about me, go look for Prince Charming. Absence makes the heart grow fonder. You two can have a good date to cultivate your relationship.”

“Don’t mention it. He just left F City this morning, I’m not in a rush to see him. Moreover, he’s in the office now and has a lot of things to attend to. I didn’t intend to look for him at this time. Alright, tell me where you are. I haven’t seen you for a few days, I missed you so much.”
