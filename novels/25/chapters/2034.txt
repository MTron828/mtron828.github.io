Chapter 2037: Qiao Mianmian Was Too Beautiful Tonight

Shen Rou’s support rate was 50%.

Without a doubt, the netizens agreed that Qiao Mianmian’s outfit tonight was better than Shen Rou’s.

Qiao Mianmian’s looks were good.

Although she was so beautiful, she wasn’t aggressive.

Hence, girls liked her looks.

She had a face that many men liked.

Although Shen Rou was pretty, her looks were aggressive.

Her looks weren’t very friendly to girls.

For men, her looks were a little domineering, and most men preferred women who looked weak.

The fans were naturally happy to see the results.

Some haters couldn’t help but sneer.

“What’s this? Why are so many people supporting Qiao Mianmian? Are they blind? Shen Rou looks better and has a better temperament.”

“Qiao Mianmian must have hired some people to vote for her. Shen Rou’s obviously the better-looking one. Her support rate is only 50%, how is that possible!” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“I feel like laughing when I see you praising Qiao Mianmian’s looks. It’s obvious that her face has undergone plastic surgery, and many places have been touched. So what if she looks good, can she compare to Young Lady Shen’s natural looks?”

“That’s right. One of my friends is from the plastic surgery field. She told me that Qiao Mianmian’s nose and eyes must have been touched, and her jaw must have been shaved too. She even had a lot of injections, thus her fair skin.”

“Injections affect fertility. She must have given birth a lot. If she can’t give birth in the future, that’ll be fun.”

Furious, the fans started arguing with the haters in the comment section.

“We’re all Qiao Mianmian’s fake reviewers. Then, whose fake reviewers are you? Shen Rou’s? Do you have evidence? Say that again. Our Mianmian has been a beauty since she was young, alright? Can’t you die of being an anti-fan before you start to slander Mianmian’s looks?”

“Starting rumors about plastic surgery? Haha, my friend used to be Qiao Mianmian’s makeup artist. She told me that Qiao Mianmian is a natural, and her face hasn’t changed at all! On the other hand, that Young Lady Shen has a weird mouth and a crooked smile. She just had plastic surgery!”

“Our Mianmian has been beautiful since she was young. I couldn’t help but laugh when you said that she had plastic surgery. There’s really nothing to criticize anymore. They’re starting to bite people like a mad dog.”

The comment section was buzzing.

The venue was also in an uproar.

Qiao Mianmian saw many familiar faces.

Shen Fei, Qin Han, Zhan Bo, Su Mufei…

The group of people who had worked together before quickly gathered and chatted like old friends.

“Wow, Sister Mianmian, you’re so beautiful tonight.” Su Mufei blushed when he saw that Qiao Mianmian wasn’t dressed like usual.

Qiao Mianmian usually dressed very casually.

Su Mufei was used to her outfit.

But in a black off-shoulder evening gown and exquisite makeup, Qiao Mianmian suddenly felt different from before. She felt a little foreign. His shyness when facing a beautiful lady reappeared.

Qiao Mianmian was too beautiful tonight.

She was so beautiful that Su Mufei was embarrassed to look at her.
