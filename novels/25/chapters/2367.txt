Chapter 2370: I’ll Do as You Say

“Phoenix in Flight” was directed by a director she liked and admired. With so many capable seniors participating in it, she really wanted to finish this movie.

Mo Yesi looked at her in surprise.

He didn’t expect Qiao Mianmian to really agree.

He was just teasing her.

Since he promised her that they wouldn’t have a child for now, he couldn’t change his mind.

He would definitely do what he promised her.

He knew that she was career-minded and didn’t want to have a child too early. She was still young, so it was still too early to have a child.

Even if Mo Yesi wanted to have a child as soon as possible to stabilize their relationship, he hoped that everything would be built on her will.

He didn’t want her to get pregnant unwillingly.

Children were the fruits of their love. They should come to this world with their expectations and love.

Any unwillingness was harmful to the child.

Mo Yesi had thought it through. It would be the most suitable time for Qiao Mianmian to have a child when she was 25.

She could use these years to work hard in her career, and he could expand the Mo Corporation and make it stronger.

When that time came, their careers would be stable and they would have a lot of free time. They wouldn’t be as busy as they were now. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

At that time, having a child was a matter of course.

But Qiao Mianmian actually agreed to give him a child in advance.

At this moment, Mo Yesi felt a certain point in his heart disperse.

He’d thought that there was another reason why Qiao Mianmian didn’t want to have a child.

She didn’t have enough feelings for him, so she wasn’t willing to have his baby.

He would feel upset every time he thought about this.

But now, he knew that he was just looking for trouble.

She wasn’t unwilling.

Suddenly understanding something, his mood improved. Smiling happily, his dark eyes lit up, reflecting Qiao Mianmian’s shadow.

“Baby, are you really willing?” The man’s voice was unbelievably gentle.

Qiao Mianmian hesitated for less than three seconds before nodding. “Mm, I’m willing. But my condition is that you have to wait until I finish filming ‘Phoenix in Flight’. Mo Yesi, I’ve already signed the contract, and I really like this movie. I…”

“Alright.” Before she could finish, Mo Yesi reached out and hugged her tightly. The man said in a submissive tone, “I’ll do as you say.”

Mo Yesi wasn’t a fool.

Although he and Qiao Mianmian had agreed to have a child in a few years, since she was willing to consider having a child in advance, he naturally wouldn’t say that he was just teasing her.

Since she took it for real, he wouldn’t say anything to change her mind.

Qiao Mianmian heaved a sigh of relief.

She was afraid that Mo Yesi wouldn’t agree.

It would inevitably be unpleasant if he did.

Qiao Mianmian had to finish the movie. She wasn’t the sort of woman who would give up everything for love.

She wanted love, but she wanted to pursue her dreams too.

There was no conflict between the two.
