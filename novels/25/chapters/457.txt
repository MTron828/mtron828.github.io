Chapter 458: Shaoqing, Stop Messing Around and Send Her Off Already

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

The girls enjoyed the process of serving them and earning money at the same time. This was way better compared to serving those old and dirty men.

The model was aware that Gong Zeli was quite peculiar. He wasn’t known to be a gentle person, so she was shocked by what she saw.

Was this... the legendary Young Master Gong that would chase people away at the drop of a hat?

He seemed... so gentle.

Yan Shaoqing smiled as he realized what she was thinking of. He then raised her chin and said smilingly, “Hey cutie, don’t be confused by this facade.”

“But Young Master Gong was so nice to that lady...”

“That isn’t any lady,” Yan Shaoqing said as his eyes narrowed. He walked towards them while holding the model in his arms and said, “Young Lady Shen basically grew up with us. How can other ladies be compared to her?

“She’s the only person that Young Master Gong would treat this way.”

“She’s the Young Lady Shen?” The model’s eyes widened in shock.

“Yup, let’s go say hi to them.”

Yan Shaoqing continued to caress the model’s waist as he held her while they walked towards Gong Zeli and Shen Rou. He then said playfully, “Miss Rourou, what happened? Did Fourth Bro bully you while I was away?”

As she heard his voice, Shen Rou stopped crying and raised her head.

Her eyes were swollen from her prolonged crying. She was a strong-headed lady normally. But now, obvious tears stained her face.

She looked really pitiful.

Shen Rou wiped away her tears using a handkerchief from Gong Zeli. When she noticed the model in Yan Shaoqing’s arms, she gave him a look of disdain.

She then continued disdainfully, “Do you think that Ze Li is like you who always makes me angry? Anyway, didn’t we agree that this was a private meeting? Why is she here?”

Shen Rou was a proud woman.

She despised the girls who were always hanging around Yan Shaoqing.

She refused to have anything to do with them.

These girls were a joke to her.

They didn’t even qualify to hang out with her.

The model froze as she felt Shen Rou’s disdain towards her. She bit on her lip and whined. “Young Master Yan...”

Her voice was soft, just the kind that men would like.

Shen Rou despised her even more.

She wasn’t planning to pull her punching and continued coldly, “Shaoqing, stop messing around and send her off already. You can get any girl you want at any time, why must you bring her here now? Why did you bring an unrelated person?”

Everyone was shocked by what Shen Rou said.

The model felt wronged, and her eyes teared up. But she couldn’t defend herself.

She was aware of how powerful Young Lady Shen was.

She wasn’t someone that she could offend.

The model already knew that she was just an object of desire for these rich and powerful people. But Shen Rou was being too aggressive, and she almost couldn’t control her emotions.

She started to tear up and fought hard to control her tears. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Gong Zeli and Yan Shaoqing were surprised by Shen Rou’s words.

This wasn’t the first time Yan Shaoqing brought his girls to their night out.
