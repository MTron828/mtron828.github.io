Chapter 3020 The End (3)

Qiao Mianmian knew about Qiao Chen and Shen Xin’s current situation. If Qiao Chen didn’t agree, it must be because Shen Xin wasn’t willing to see them.

Shen Rou was still in a daze. The grudge between the Mo and Shen families was too deep. Although Qiao Chen was already with Shen Xin, the two of them were secretly hiding it from her family. As long as the Shen family didn’t agree, the two of them wouldn’t have a good ending Qiao Chen knew this very well, but he wasn’t willing to give up on Shen Xin. How far they could go in the future, even they didn’t know if the outcome would be good or bad.

Hence, both of them cherished what they had.

Qiao Chen said that Shen Xin didn’t have the time, so Qiao Mianmian didn’t talk about it anymore. Qiao Chen had already grown up and matured. As his sister, she could only give some suggestions regarding his relationship with Shen Xin. As for what to choose and do, it naturally depended on his decision.

She would support him no matter what decision he made.

Qiao Chen’s cell phone suddenly rang. He looked at it and his eyes softened. He got up and said to them, “Sister, Brother-in-law, I’m going out to take a call.”

Seeing his reaction, Qiao Mianmian guessed who it was.

“Go on.” She smiled. “If there’s anything, you can leave first. I have your brother-in-law here, you don’t have to keep me company.”

After Qiao Chen picked up the call, Qiao Mianmian rubbed her temple and looked a little tired.

“Sleepy?” Mo Yesi quickly noticed her fatigue and reached out to massage her temple. “Sleep if you’re tired.”

Qiao Mianmian was a little sleepy. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Although the birth was easy and she didn’t suffer much, giving birth was a very tiring thing.

She turned around and looked at the baby, who was sleeping soundly on the bed.

Mo Yesi seemed to know what she was thinking. He patted her head and said gently, “Don’t worry and sleep. I’m not going anywhere. I’ll watch over the baby.”

Qiao Mianmian nodded. “Mm, I’ll sleep for a while.”

Mo Yesi was more meticulous than her. She wasn’t worried about the child at all.

“Let me take a look at the baby, then I’ll sleep.” Qiao Mianmian opened her eyes again.

Mo Yesi smiled affectionately. “Alright.”

Then, he got up and walked to the side of the bed. He bent down and carefully picked up the baby, then carried it to her.

Qiao Mianmian reached out and gently stroked the baby’s cheek. She looked at him tenderly.

This was her child.

It was the fruit of their love.

Even though she’d already given birth, Qiao Mianmian still felt unreal, as if she was dreaming.

She actually had a child.

She really became a mother.

Was this unbelievably beautiful and angel-like baby really born by her?

“Hubby, our son is so handsome!” Qiao Mianmian looked at him and smiled. “How can he be so good-looking? Is this really our son?”

Her question was a little silly, but Mo Yesi looked at her lovingly.
