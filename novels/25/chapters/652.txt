Chapter 653: She’d Never Thought of Getting Closer to Him

But then, she thought about how Tu Yilei had been dragged along by many female artistes to be a CP.

For example, she just saw a piece of entertainment news a few days ago.

A female artiste went on a variety show with Tu Yilei before. They’d had some interactions in the variety show.

But overall, they didn’t interact much.

But her fans forced her to put on a “love filter” and deliberately edited the so-called “sweet interaction.”

Although Tu Yilei wasn’t a popular idol, he was one of the most popular young idols in the entertainment industry. He also had a lot of wife and girlfriend fans.

Of course, they couldn’t tolerate that female artiste’s fans forcefully promoting their Brother Yilei’s CP.

Hence, a large group of “dumplings” rushed to the female artiste’s Weibo to scold her.

They scolded her so badly.

They even made her a hot topic.

That female artiste actually managed to gain popularity through this method.

She was in the top 10 for three days straight.

Before this, other female artistes had used this move as well.

She used this method to gain popularity and fame.

Even if it was black and red, it was still red.

It was better than nothing.

Tu Yilei’s manager was probably afraid of these female artistes.

Hence, when he saw a female artiste approaching Tu Yilei, he instinctively felt that she was trying to ride on his popularity.

Qiao Mianmian didn’t feel so upset anymore.

Since the other party was so worried, then she’d better... stay away from Tu Yilei.

A male artiste like Tu Yilei wasn’t on the same level as her.

She never intended to get close to him.

“Mr. Tu, since you’re so busy, I won’t hold you up any longer. I have to go back to pack my luggage too, so we’ll leave first. Goodbye.”

Qiao Mianmian was afraid that Tu Yilei’s manager would think that she was trying to ride on his coattails. Before Tu Yilei could respond, Qiao Mianmian dragged Nana past him.

“Sister Mianmian, wait...”

Nana was dragged into the elevator, still staring at Tu Yilei. She said anxiously, “Sister Mianmian, I want an autograph. Y-You don’t have to leave so quickly. Wait for me.”

The elevator doors were about to close.

Nana immediately pressed the button to open the door. The moment the elevator doors opened, she dashed out like the wind.

Qiao Mianmian saw her rush towards Tu Yilei and take out a pen and a notebook from her bag. She blushed and asked if Tu Yilei could give her an autograph.

Tu Yilei was stunned for a few seconds before taking the pen and notebook from her and signing his name.

After signing, he handed the notebook back to Nana.

Nana took his autograph and looked at it over and over again, grinning from ear to ear.

She was so happy.

She ran back happily with the notebook.

“Sister Mianmian, look, Tu Yilei signed my autograph and even gave me his blessings.” Nana handed the notebook to Qiao Mianmian as if she was presenting a treasure. “Wow, he’s so approachable, he doesn’t have any airs at all.

“And his handwriting is so good. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“I finally know why he’s so popular. He’s so handsome, has a good temper, and doesn’t even have the airs of a big shot celebrity. If such a person isn’t popular, it’d be intolerable.”
