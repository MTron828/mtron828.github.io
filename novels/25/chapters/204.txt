Chapter 207: Really, It Doesn’t Hurt So Much Anymore!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Qiao Mianmian waited for over 10 minutes before Mo Yesi finally came back with what she needed.

There were several housemaids in the house.

So it wasn’t all that difficult to get hold of females’ necessities.

Mo Yesi handed her the sanitary pad and asked, “Is this brand alright? Use this for now. Let me know if it’s not the one you want and I’ll get someone to buy it.”

“This is fine.”

Qiao Mianmian received it in embarrassment.

This wasn’t the brand she usually used.

But at a time like this, it really didn’t matter.

She took another 10 minutes to clean and tidy herself up. When she emerged from the washroom again, she felt as if it was a rebirth.

Although she could feel an ache in her abdomen, at least she no longer had to worry about the blood staining her clothes and anywhere else she sat on.

She saw Mo Yesi waiting right outside.

Qiao Mianmian didn’t look too good whenever her period came. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Her usually radiant face would be a little pale each time she was on her period.

She would seem somewhat tired and sad.

Mo Yesi looked at her pale face and hugged her right away, asking in concern, “Why do you look so unwell? Are you hurting anywhere?”

Qiao Mianmian did feel unwell. She honestly said, “Mm, my stomach hurts a little.”

Her period cramps weren’t anything new to her.

It used to be even worse when she first got it. She even had to go to the hospital at times.

But as she built up her body constitution over the years, the pain wasn’t so bad anymore. She’d just feel some discomfort for a day or two.

The first day, especially. She’d just wish to lie in bed all day.

“Your stomach hurts?” Mo Yesi didn’t know much about such matters. After all, he been single for his whole life and didn’t have much opportunity to learn more about it.

Hence, he had no idea that women would feel discomfort on the few days each month.

When Qiao Mianmian mentioned her stomach hurt, he hadn’t even associated it with her period.

He asked, “Your stomach hurts? Where exactly?”

Qiao Mianmian was a little stunned by his question.

She thought this was common knowledge.

But as she remembered that Mo Yesi had his strange disorder, this all made sense.

For a man who’d always gotten allergic reactions from being in touch with women, who had never been in love, it wasn’t a surprise that he had no idea about this.

She looked up at him and patiently explained, “It’s the Aunt Flo pains. Each time my Aunt Flo comes, my stomach would feel a little unwell.”

“Aunt Flo pains?”

“Mm.”

Qiao Mianmian put her hand on her stomach. “Actually, I’m much better now. It used to be so bad in the past that I’d wish I could knock myself out.”

She said it casually, but the man had a look of seriousness on his face.

When she was done, she saw that Mo Yesi’s brows were knitted tightly together. “It’s so bad?”

“Uh, that’s all in the past.” Qiao Mianmian did not want to seem so pitiful before him. She quickly added, “I’m a lot better now, it doesn’t hurt so much anymore. I just feel some discomfort sometimes, but it’s all bearable.”

But the man still looked worried.

“Really, it doesn’t hurt so much anymore!”
