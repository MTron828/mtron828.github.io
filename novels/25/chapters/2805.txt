The others wanted to laugh, but they held it in.

It was said that children’s words carried no harm.

It was precisely because children were innocent and didn’t have any schemes that they would say whatever was on their minds. Hence, children’s words were more precious and genuine.

Children just said what was on their minds.

Hence, Doudou was really worried that he would starve to death if he followed Qiao Anxin.

It was only the first day of recording, but the little guy was already so dissatisfied with his “mother”.

This was the first time the production team saw such a situation.

After all, in the previous few episodes, the guests got along well with the children.

Hence, Li Wei was worried after hearing Doudou’s request.

Let Doudou follow Zhan Bo. It seemed like he was really unhappy with Jiang Xinyue.

At that time, no news of newbies being bullied by the production team and other guests would spread.

Those who didn’t know the truth would think that the entire production crew was bullying a newbie.

It would impact their reputation.

Li Wei didn’t want to be labeled as a bully.

“But the other children are with their Mommy.” Li Wei tried to persuade Little Doudou. “Doudou, be good. Tell Uncle Li what you want to eat. Uncle Li will get someone to buy it for you. He won’t let Doudou starve.”

“No, I want to follow Daddy Zhan.” But Doudou couldn’t listen to him. He grabbed Li Wei’s sleeve and begged pitifully. “Uncle Li, I want to follow Daddy Zhan. I don’t care, I want to follow Daddy Zhan.

“I want Daddy Zhan… Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“I want Daddy Zhan…”

The little guy started crying.

Li Wei was at a loss.

He had no choice but to look up at Qiao Anxin. “Xinyue, Doudou wants to follow Zhan Bo. Look…”

“Brother Li, since Doudou wants to follow Senior Zhan, let him.” Qiao Anxin didn’t make things difficult for Li Wei. She didn’t like children to begin with, and Doudou embarrassed her in every way. She hated him to the core.

She couldn’t wait for Doudou to follow Zhan Bo and not bother her.

She really hated this brat.

She couldn’t wait for this child to disappear.

Hence, Qiao Anxin agreed before Li Wei could finish speaking. She even pretended to be understanding. “As long as Doudou is happy, it doesn’t matter if he follows me or Senior Zhan.

“This shouldn’t be a hard rule. It can be changed, right?”

Li Wei hesitated for a while before nodding. “We can change it.”

“Then, let Doudou follow Senior Zhan. I understand.” Qiao Anxin still wanted to salvage her image. So, even though she was furious, she suppressed her temper and pretended to be good-natured.

She said gently, “Moreover, I’m also worried that I won’t be able to take good care of Doudou. Doudou was with Senior Zhan previously, I think Senior Zhan took good care of him.”

Li Wei looked at her a few more times.

Seeing that she really didn’t seem to mind, he nodded and said, “Alright, then let Doudou follow Zhan Bo. Anyway, you guys still have to do missions together tomorrow, so let Zhan Bo take him for the time being.”

Qiao Anxin nodded.

Li Wei called a crew member over. “Bring Doudou to Zhan Bo and let him know that he’ll be staying with him.”

Soon, the crew member left with Doudou.
