Chapter 1155: That Mysterious Man’s Surname Is Mo Too

But he was making exceptions for Qiao Mianmian.

Not only did he register on Weibo, he even interacted with her to publicize their relationship!

Did he care so much about Qiao Mianmian?

What made Shen Rou even angrier was that Yan Shaoqing and the rest had all shared Mo Yesi and Qiao Mianmian’s Weibo posts. It seemed like everyone was on Qiao Mianmian’s side.

But clearly, these people used to be her best friends.

She was the only girl between them.

She was the most favored of the four.

But now, it was Qiao Mianmian.

Instead, she became the target of public criticism.

Everyone felt that she had done something wrong.

Everyone was distancing themselves from her.

Even Gong Zeli, who had always treated her well, told her that he liked the wrong person.

He liked the girl who saved him.

He was good to her because he thought she had saved him.

So, was all his kindness fake?

He said he’d withdraw it.

He could get away so easily, so directly, without any reluctance towards her.

She began to wonder if all their years of friendship had been a lie. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

But even if she had lied to him, even if she wasn’t the one who had saved him that night, did he not have any feelings for her after so many years of being together?

Was there nothing about her that he liked?

She really hated it.

Why did it become like this?

Why did everything change when Qiao Mianmian appeared?

Why was it that Qiao Mianmian, that little b*tch, was living a better and better life now?

Shen Rou stared fixedly at the Weibo page for a full minute. She was so angry that she smashed her phone on the floor.

She was having a hard time.

Qiao Mianmian wouldn’t be able to live happily, either!

Fortunately, there was Qiao Anxin, who could be used to deal with Qiao Mianmian.

“Qiao Mianmian.” Shen Rou gritted her teeth as she called her name. “You took away everything that originally belonged to me. You want to live your life peacefully? Impossible!

“I will take back what belongs to me one by one.”

Qiao Anxin also saw Qiao Mianmian and Mo Yesi’s Weibo posts.

Including the reposts from Yan Shaoqing and the rest, as well as the legal letter from the Mo Corporation.

She gritted her teeth in jealousy.

Although she didn’t know who Nameless was, the attention and reposts of Yan Shaoqing, Gong Zeli, and the others showed that his true identity was very impressive, definitely not inferior to the Yan and Gong families.

And the Mo Corporation’s top lawyers.

Qiao Anxin had met Mo Yesi a few times.

She suddenly remembered Mo Yesi’s name, and her eyes widened in shock.

That mysterious man was also surnamed Mo.

Qiao Mianmian had said that the man was her boyfriend.

When she first saw that mysterious man, she knew that his identity was definitely not simple.

At that time, she had sent someone to investigate.

But he could not find anything.

Normally, only people with particularly prominent statuses would hide their information.

Yan Shaoqing called him “Boss”.

The Mo Corporation also paid attention to him immediately, and his surname was Mo...

Qiao Anxin was so shocked that she almost dropped her phone.
