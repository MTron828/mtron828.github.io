Chapter 1017: Repeat the Last Sentence

In Mo Yesi’s eyes, this incident was as shocking as seeing the sun rise from the west.

It was a strange thing.

In his opinion, it was only normal for someone like his brother to never get married.

It was hard to imagine what it would be like to fall in love, get married, and have children with him.

A man like his Big Brother was more suitable to be alone for life.

He had no time to date.

He even gave him time to sleep.

“Of course it’s true!” Qiao Mianmian bit her lip and frowned. “Luo Luo should like Big Brother, but he seems to be more responsible towards her. Actually, I really hope that Luo Luo can be with Big Brother.

“If that’s the case, Luo Luo might become my sister-in-law in the future. If she could be my sister-in-law, I’d be so happy. But I don’t think she’s suitable for Big Brother. Luo Luo has a very lively personality and likes to live a diverse life.

“Big Brother’s personality seems a little dull. Moreover, he’s so busy now that he barely has time to return home. If he becomes the President of Country A in the future, he’ll definitely be even busier.

“I don’t think he can give Luo Luo the love she wants. If Luo Luo gets together with him, she’ll definitely spend less time with him. So, I suggested that Luo Luo doesn’t agree to be his girlfriend. But now, I feel like I’m being too arbitrary?”

Mo Yesi was still in shock.

After listening to Qiao Mianmian’s explanation and digesting it for another minute, he finally accepted it.

He looked at her worried expression and thought about it seriously before saying, “You think that my Big Brother’s personality and work isn’t suitable for her? You’re afraid that if they get together, my Big Brother won’t be able to give her the happiness she wants?”

“Mm.” Qiao Mianmian nodded. “But now, I feel like it’s hard to say how they’ll develop in the future. When we first got together, I never thought I’d like you so much.” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Qiao Mianmian realized that she had just confessed to Mo Yesi.

She sounded so natural when she said she liked him.

She couldn’t help but blush as she looked at him shyly. “Well, anyway, what I mean is that they might be happy together. What do you think?”

That confession was very clear.

The man smiled.

Looking at the girl’s pale face, he couldn’t help but lower his head. He pinched her chin with his slender fingers and whispered, “Baby, repeat the last sentence.”

As the man got closer, Qiao Mianmian could smell his unique masculine scent.

It was a dizzying hormone.

Qiao Mianmian’s face burned even more. When she looked up and saw his handsome face right in front of her, her heartbeat accelerated.

She knew what he was talking about, but she just wanted to tease him, so she feigned ignorance and said, “I was wondering how they will develop in the future...”

He tightened his grip on her chin. “Not this.”

Qiao Mianmian continued to feign ignorance. “I mean, maybe after they get together...”
