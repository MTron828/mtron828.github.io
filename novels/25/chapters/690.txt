Chapter 692: I’m Not Afraid of Eternal Damnation

Qiao Mianmian looked up. “You saw the video just now?”

“Mm.” Mo Yesi nodded and smiled. “Do you think that’s very romantic? Let’s make up two lines too, alright?”

The video that made Qiao Mianmian exclaim that it was so romantic was one of the most popular videos recently.

It was a video of a bracelet.

In the video, the girl cut off a section of her hair and tied it into a red string. She then put the red string on her other wrist.

Wearing this bracelet with a girl’s hair, if the man let this girl down, he would be doomed forever.

Many young couples who wanted to prove that they had a good relationship with each other had created such a red string and posted it. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Qiao Mianmian opened the app and saw a few similar posts.

She really felt that it was romantic, so she sighed.

But Mo Yesi heard it.

“Mo Yesi, do you know what that bracelet means?”

Mo Yesi shook his head. “I don’t know. Baby, tell me.”

Qiao Mianmian looked into his eyes and said seriously, “That’s a bracelet with a girl’s hair. If you wear such a bracelet and let her down one day, you’ll be doomed.

“Now, are you going to make that bracelet?”

“Doomed?” Mo Yesi repeated as he raised an eyebrow.

Qiao Mianmian nodded. “Yes, beyond redemption.”

He smiled and stroked her chin. “Why, are you afraid?”

Qiao Mianmian was confused.

What was there to be afraid of?

He would be doomed forever.

After all, the bracelet was tailored for the man.

Her lips quivered. “I’m just afraid that you...”

“I’m not afraid.” Before she could finish, Mo Yesi bit her lip lightly. “I have confidence in myself. I won’t be doomed.

“So, Baby, can you make one for me too? I want a bracelet like that too. That way, even if you’re not by my side, you’ll have something with you.”

“But, isn’t it too late now?”

Qiao Mianmian looked at the time. “Aren’t you rushing to the airport later?”

“Then change the flight time.”

In the driver’s seat.

When Wei Zheng heard that Chairman Mo was going to change the flight time, he tried his best to bear with it. “Ahem. Well, Chairman Mo... I don’t think it’s easy to change the flight time. The next flight is two hours from now.”

“In two hours.”

Wei Zheng was speechless.

That wasn’t what he wanted to express.

He took a deep breath and mustered his courage again. “Chairman Mo, a foreign partner is here today. It wouldn’t be good if you aren’t around.”

Mo Yesi furrowed his brows.

He’d forgotten about it.

If it was a business partner, it wouldn’t be a problem if he wasn’t around.

But this time, it was a foreign company...

Qiao Mianmian could tell that he was in a difficult position. She took the initiative to say, “The company matters are important, you should go back on time.”

“What about the bracelet?”

He wanted to wear it immediately.

“I don’t have a bracelet for now. How about... I give you this first?” Qiao Mianmian took a rubber band off her wrist and put it on for him.
