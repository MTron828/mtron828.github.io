Chapter 324: Ah Si, You’re Really Too Much

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Shen Rou, it seems like everything I’ve said to you before was in vain.

“You can choose not to go up there, but as I said, I’ll let Uncle Shen and Aunt Shen know about it. I believe they’ll account you to me.” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Shen Rou saw his coldness and authoritativeness.

There really was no room for negotiation.

He’d already made up his mind to support Qiao Mianmian and the rest.

She’d always been confident that the woman would never mean as much to him as she did, simply because she and Mo Yesi had shared so many years of friendship.

So, she never actually thought much about Qiao Mianmian.

She truly believed that eventually, she would be the woman who stayed by his side.

But she started losing her confidence when Mo Yesi brought Qiao Mianmian home.

She’d never thought that Grandma Mo would like Qiao Mianmian so much.

Grandma Mo was the one with the most power and say in the Mo family, and all her children and grandchildren were very respectful towards her. If Grandma Mo had her eye set on someone, nobody would say otherwise.

Moreover, Mo Yesi was rather solitary.

Nobody in the family could really stop him.

What if... he really fell in love with Qiao Mianmian one day?

How long would she have to wait for Qiao Mianmian to divorce him?

Even with Madam Mo on her side, it was hard to make Mo Yesi leave her, now that they were officially married.

Unless Mo Yesi really had no feelings for her and married her only because he didn’t have an allergic reaction towards her.

But as she thought about what he’d said to her in the study that day...

Obviously, he had feelings for Qiao Mianmian.

There surely were some.

Qiao Mianmian was able to get Mo Yesi to marry her so soon. It wouldn’t be surprising if she could entrance him with her charms after their marriage.

Could they possibly be divorced a year from now?

If Qiao Mianmian managed to get pregnant in the coming year, her place in the Mo family would further solidify.

Holding that thought, Shen Rou was even more anxious now.

“Ah Si, do you really have to do this?” Shen Rou’s fear intensified as she faced his cold gaze.

Mo Yesi had really changed.

He was so entranced by her that he’d forgotten his friends.

In the past, he would never put her in such a tough spot.

Much less treat her so coldly and cruelly.

Mo Yesi didn’t respond, but his eyes gave her the answer.

Shen Rou’s eyes glistened with tears. She bit her lip and said, “Alright. I’ll apologize on stage.

“If this is what you want to see, I’ll do it!”

She seemed to say that out of spite.

With that, she headed for the stage.

Qiao Mianmian was actually surprised that she was really about to do it.

She’d thought that Shen Rou would just leave in a fit of anger.

After all, it must hurt more than death itself, for Young Lady Shen to have to swallow her pride and do something like that.

“Ah Si, you’re really too much. Never have I expected that you’d forget all of your friends because of this one woman. Rourou has been so nice to you all these years, you should know that very well. Now you’re doing this to her?!”

Someone grabbed hold of him right as Shen Rou started making her way to the stage.
