Chapter 159: Miss Qiao, We’re Sorry We’re Late

He then said very politely, “Miss Qiao, we’re very sorry we’re late. Could we ask what is needed of us here?”

Besides Qiao Mianmian, everyone else was stunned by what he’d said.

Lin Huizhen’s eyes widened in disbelief.

Qiao Ruhai was equally shocked.

Qiao Anxin was taken aback at first, but her look changed quickly.

Who were these men?

Why were they being so polite to Qiao Mianmian?

Could they be... the support that the classy-looking man provided for her?

Qiao Anxin suddenly remembered how some men in black had appeared in school to help Qiao Mianmian out too when Shen Yueyue bothered her.

In the end, it was Du Ze and Shen Yueyue who had to pay the price for it. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Both of them were apparently still being held in the police station.

On this thought, Qiao Anxin’s expression darkened further.

If it was really that man who sent these people here, it showed just how much Qiao Mianmian mattered to him.

The mysterious man who had the power to make the Du firm go bankrupt overnight was definitely capable enough to go against the Qiao family.

Now all she could hope for was that the man’s authority was beneath that of the Su family. Otherwise, wouldn’t she be at Qiao Mianmian’s mercy in the future?

“W-Who are you guys!” Lin Huizhen had thought that they were here to find trouble with Qiao Mianmian. But when she saw how courteous they were to her, she lost it.

She growled at them. “This is private property. What you’re doing is illegal!

“I’m going to call the police to arrest all of you!

“Master, hurry and get your men to chase them out!”

Qiao Ruhai was stunned for a while more before he said, “Who are they? Mianmian, do you know them?”

“Of course she knows them.”

Before Qiao Mianmian said anything, Lin Huizhen sneered. “Master, this daughter of yours is getting impressive. What does she mean by this, calling this many people over to our house... Is she threatening us?”

Tens of men in black.

They were all over the house, upstairs and downstairs.

Each of them was at least 1.80m in height, and they looked trained and burly.

The group of housemaids in the villa were surely afraid.

Even Qiao Ruhai himself was a little fearful of them.

“Is that true?” Qiao Ruhai dared not face the men in black. He could only look at Qiao Mianmian as he asked, “Did you call these men over? What are you trying to do, tear this house down? Or get them to attack your father?”

Qiao Mianmian looked at him very calmly as she said, “I’m not trying to do anything. But if someone has to force me to my wits’ end, then you can’t blame me for turning against them.”

“Ingrate! You’re threatening your father now?!” The veins on Qiao Ruhai’s forehead bulged out.

Qiao Mianmian’s expression and tone were oddly composed. But it was this composure that made her seem even more powerful. “Mom’s bedroom is to remain intact. Nobody is to move anything in or out of it.”

Qiao Anxin turned to look at Qiao Anxin, who was now stone-faced. She enunciated every word clearly. “This is my only request. I don’t care what the fortune-teller said. That’s your business, it has nothing to do with me or my mom!”
