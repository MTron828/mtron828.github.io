Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“I won’t delete it, much less apologize to you. If you want to sue, go ahead. I’m waiting for you, don’t just say nothing.”

“Dream on. Even if I die, I won’t apologize to a bunch of ugly people.”

“Deleting the post is impossible. Never. Sue if you have the ability. Don’t just talk nonsense.”

“Where’s the lawyer’s letter? I’m waiting. Are you still thinking about how to photoshop it?”

“Qiao Mianmian’s fans are all ugly and low-class losers. I seriously doubt they have the money to hire a lawyer? Hahaha, let me know if they don’t have the money. Our Feibao fans have always been generous, we don’t mind sponsoring you.”

Song Fei’s fans were too arrogant.

But once a passerby spoke up for Qiao Mianmian, they would be attacked by Song Fei’s fans.

Gradually, few passers-by dared to do so. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

After all, no one wanted to get into trouble for no reason.

Song Fei’s fans were crazy.

Who would want to provoke a group of lunatics?

Song Fei’s fans had the absolute advantage in this scolding battle.

This made them fight even more intensely. The group of people seemed to have been injected with chicken blood as they attacked the heavens and earth on Weibo. Everywhere they went, they were criticized like locusts.

…

On the other side.

The awards ceremony hadn’t officially started.

Most of the artistes had already entered the venue and found their seats.

Song Fei sat in her seat and scrolled through Weibo. She was also concerned about the situation.

Seeing that her fans had the absolute advantage and suppressed Qiao Mianmian’s fans, Song Fei smiled gently.

She knew that her fans wouldn’t disappoint her.

Hmph! So what if it was Qiao Mianmian?

She’d provoked her.

What trouble did it bring her?

Qiao Mianmian still didn’t dare to say a word.

She made it sound so impressive, as if whoever offended her would die. Now, it seemed like that was all.

She saw that it was just a boast.

Huang Yilin’s matter was her own fault. She did something illegal on impulse and was arrested.

But later, it was rumored that Qiao Mianmian let Huang Yilin go to the police station.

As for Qiao Anxin, she was just outdated.

She was also said to have offended Qiao Mianmian, and the latter made her disappear from the entertainment industry.

And that Young Lady Shen.

An accident?

Just because Eldest Young Lady Shen had liked Chairman Mo before and now Chairman Mo was Qiao Mianmian’s husband, people thought that Eldest Young Lady Shen ended up in such a terrible state because she offended Qiao Mianmian.

Everything had nothing to do with Qiao Mianmian.

But they made her seem so impressive.

Others would believe this, but she wouldn’t.

Hence, she wasn’t afraid of Qiao Mianmian.

She wanted to see what would happen to her if she offended Qiao Mianmian.

At least from the looks of it, Qiao Mianmian had already been scolded by her fans and didn’t do anything.

If she was really that impressive, would her fans have scolded her for so long?

At least delete some trending topics..
