Wei Zheng was left speechless.

He didn’t dare to hide anything from his big boss after seeing how angry he was. He blurted it all out immediately. “Regarding the matter you’ve asked me to investigate yesterday, the results are out. The person who sent flowers to Young Madam is...”

Mo Yesi looked at him intensely and asked coldly, “Who was it?”

Wei Zheng met his cold eyes and felt a shiver down his spine. He then answered fearfully, “It was Young Madam’s ex-boyfriend, Su Ze.”

After he spoke the name, he felt as though the room turned cold.

Even though it was summer, it was really cold.

It was so cold that Wei Zheng felt goosebumps.

“Who? Say it again.” Mo Yesi frowned even more.

Wei Zheng shivered again and answered, “Su- Su Ze.”

He knew that Chairman Mo’s reaction would be like this.

If it were any other man, Chairman Mo wouldn’t be so upset.

But the person who sent the flowers was Su Ze.

He was her childhood sweetheart and her fiancé. He was also the man who almost got married to her but betrayed and hurt her.

He was even dating Young Madam’s step-sister.

However, he still sent flowers to Young Madam, and it was as though he was still trying to chase after her.

How could Chairman Mo not be angry?

He was also triggered by it when he discovered it during his investigation.

Su Ze was such a trashy guy.

How could he still have the audacity to do all these?

Mo Yesi bit on his lip and kept quiet.

Wei Zheng could feel his anger rising even though he didn’t say anything.

Chairman Mo would usually keep to himself more as he got angrier.

The fact that he stayed silent for so long now showed how angry he was.

Su Ze... was going to be in trouble.

Chairman Mo didn’t like him in the first place. Chairman Mo didn’t want to bother with him because Su Ze didn’t cause any more trouble.

But now, he dared to contact Young Madam. This was just asking for trouble.

Wasn’t it great to live without any trouble?

Why must he invite trouble to himself?

“Alright. I understand. You can leave first,” Mo Yesi said calmly after the moment of silence.

Wei Zheng was stunned.

He didn’t expect Chairman Mo’s reaction.

He wanted him to leave just like that?

Shouldn’t Chairman Mo ask him more about the operations of the Su Mandate and cause them to go bankrupt some days later?

After all, Su Ze dared to contact his wife.

He couldn’t just let it slide.

Also, it wouldn’t be hard to bankrupt the Su Mandate.

“Have you not heard me?” Mo Yesi looked at him coldly. “Get out.”

The coldness in his voice sent shivers down Wei Zheng’s spine. He didn’t dare to hesitate anymore and went out immediately.

The way he left felt as though he was being chased.

After he left the room, Wei Zheng closed the door after him.

As the door closed, Mo Yesi threw his pen onto the table.

The pen was crafted diligently and was of good quality. Yet, it was broken in half by Mo Yesi as he gripped it tightly in anger.

“Su Ze.”

Mo Yesi spoke his name with a low voice as his eyes turned cold.

...

At the hospital.

Qiao Anxin was unconscious for a long time.

When she woke up, she saw Lin Huizhen crying next to her.
