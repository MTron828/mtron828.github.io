Chapter 680: Not Giving Her Any Face

Bai Yusheng slowly got up.

“Mianmian, are you alright?” He lit a cigarette and asked calmly.

The beach was very soft.

Qiao Mianmian’s fall wasn’t a big problem.

But her hair and body were all covered in sand.

She looked pathetic.

Bai Yusheng knew that Huang Yilin was doing it on purpose.

He knew it the first time.

He didn’t stop her the second time or the third time because he wanted to see Qiao Mianmian’s reaction.

He said she could look for him if she needed anything.

If she really said it, he would definitely help her.

She was Mo Yesi’s woman.

He had to give this face no matter what.

But if Qiao Mianmian really came to look for him because of this, he would probably think that she was just so-so.

She couldn’t take any hardship.

This was normal for a newcomer.

If they didn’t have a strong backing from the start, who would have been able to make it this far smoothly?

Who wouldn’t suffer?

He always admired artistes who suffered.

Although Qiao Mianmian already had a strong backing, she didn’t need to go through any hardship to get what she wanted.

But Bai Yusheng didn’t wish for her to be like the other female artistes who had a huge backing.

He didn’t want to make a mistake.

“I’m fine, Director Bai. As long as Senior Huang is ready, I can start over anytime.” Qiao Mianmian patted the sand off her body and smiled at him.

She seemed so peaceful.

Bai Yusheng looked at her for a few seconds before nodding with a smile. “Alright, then get ready. We’ll do it again.”

Without a doubt, Bai Yusheng was very satisfied with Qiao Mianmian’s performance.

He was satisfied and was willing to help her.

Turning back to the camera, Bai Yusheng smiled and said to Huang Yilin, “Yilin, you’re a senior, don’t act inferior to a junior. This will make me doubt if the female lead I found is qualified.

“It’s such a simple scene, if you have to NG five or six times in a row, you have to reflect on whether your acting has deteriorated.”

Huang Yilin’s expression immediately changed.

Bai Yusheng didn’t give her any face at all.

Saying that her acting skills had deteriorated.

Especially when she heard him say that the female lead wasn’t up to standard.

Although she was a top-tier actress, she had enough popularity.

But it took a lot of effort to get this female lead role.

The entertainment industry didn’t lack good-looking and capable actresses.

She wasn’t the only one.

Back then, many top-tier actresses fought for this role. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Although she had already signed a contract with the production crew, she would be able to get a lot of compensation if he were to break it.

But everyone knew that Bai Yusheng was rich.

He didn’t care about the compensation fee.

If he felt that there was something wrong with the female lead, he would definitely change her.

Although Bai Yusheng didn’t openly help Qiao Mianmian, everyone could tell that he was trying to back her up.
