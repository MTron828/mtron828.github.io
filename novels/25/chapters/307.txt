Chapter 308: Present It to Her Without Her Having to Work for It

“Chairman Mo, are you referring to the Qiao family’s villa?”

“Yes.”

Wei Zheng politely said, “It’s almost settled. I already got someone to negotiate with the Qiao family. The value is good, but the Qiaos don’t seem inclined to sell it.

“They said it’s their home and property, and the Feng Shui there is good for them. They’re unwilling to sell it no matter the price.

“Chairman Mo mentioned that if the normal procedure doesn’t work, I can use other means. So, I caused some trouble for Qiao Ruhai. He’ll have no choice but to sell the house to settle that issue.”

“Mm, you did well. Remember, whatever it takes. You need to get that villa into our hands.” Mo Yesi narrowed his eyes as he recalled how the Qiao family treated Qiao Mianmian. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

He had no interest in that villa.

He insisted on getting it only because of Qiao Mianmian.

There was something that she valued in that building.

As long as she valued it and wanted it, he would present it to her without her having to work for it.

He was doing something so cliché.

But of course, when one really loved another person, he would be willing to give her anything she wanted.

He could even give her his whole heart.

“Alright, you may leave.”

Mo Yesi waved him out once again.

“Yes, Chairman Mo.”

Wei Zheng had just turned around when he heard his Boss call him again.

He turned to face him once again. “Chairman Mo, do you have further instructions for me?”

Mo Yesi was looking at his cell phone and was in deep thought. “What’s a suitable congratulatory gift?”

“Ah?” Wei Zheng was a little stunned.

He only understood what was going on after a few seconds.

He made a guess, and tentatively asked, “Chairman Mo, you’re thinking of getting a gift for Young Madam?”

Only Young Madam could get Chairman Mo to put in so much effort into something.

He used to get the female secretaries to settle any gifts that had to be given to others.

When had he ever bothered to ask about this personally?

Mo Yesi “Hm”-ed quietly.

“Chairman Mo, you’re thinking of congratulating Young Madam on her successful audition?”

“Yes.”

“Most women would like flowers or jewelry. But of course, what’s most important is that you give Young Madam something she likes. That’d be more personal.”

Mo Yesi furrowed his brows. “Something she likes?”

“Yes. Why don’t you try sounding her out?”

Qiao Mianmian and Jiang Luoli flagged down a cab at the entrance of the hotel and headed for the revolving restaurant.

Mo Yesi had taken her there once.

She received his text the moment they got into the cab.

Mo Yesi: [Mm, I’m free. Send me the address. I’ll come and look for you.]

Qiao Mianmian smiled and replied instantly: [It’s the revolving restaurant we went to before. Also, I want to share some good news. I passed the audition! I’m on the way there with Luo Luo now. I’ll treat you guys to a feast today!]

Mo Yesi: [Jiang Luoli is with you?]

Qiao Mianmian seemed to detect some unhappiness in his text.

She could guess why and was slightly amused. She replied: [What’s with that tone, Luo Luo is not an outsider. Moreover, I owe this audition opportunity to her. I really need to thank her the most.]
