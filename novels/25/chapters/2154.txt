Chapter 2157: It’s More Important to Eat With Someone

He quickly ordered a pile of dishes.

They were all suitable for Jiang Luoli.

Then, Jiang Luoli realized that the dishes were all her favorites.

He didn’t order anything he liked.

And because her appetite had become picky during her pregnancy, she couldn’t eat much of the food she liked as before.

Instead, she liked eating strange things.

She would find them delicious.

But normal people wouldn’t find it delicious.

Mo Shixiu ate these strange things with her every day.

He didn’t complain.

Jiang Luoli felt that regardless of whether this man really liked her, it was enough for him to accommodate her like this.

Most men couldn’t do that.

Moreover, he was the Young Master of the Mo family.

“Mo Shixiu, aren’t you sick of it?”

“Mm?”

“You’ve been eating strange food with me for so long. Aren’t you sick of it?” Jiang Luoli placed a hand on her chin and looked at him seriously. “Actually, you don’t have to accommodate me. You can order a few of your favorite dishes. You don’t have to eat the same as me.”

“I don’t have anything special to eat.” Mo Shixiu smiled. “To me, anything is the same. It’s just that I don’t like to eat the same thing. I’ll get sick of it after eating it every day. So, I think it’s more important to eat with someone than what to eat.”

Jiang Luoli asked, “So you’re saying that eating with me is more important than anything else?”

“Of course.” The man nodded and smiled gently. “Much more important.”

Jiang Luoli’s heart skipped a beat.

Who could resist Mo Shixiu’s gentleness and teasing?

Even if she wanted to guard her heart, it was futile.

Who wouldn’t fall for a man like Mo Shixiu?

“Mo Shixiu.” Jiang Luoli called him softly.

“Mm, I’m here.”

“Can I ask you what you mean by that?”

Mo Shixiu was stunned for a while. He smiled gently. “Of course.”

Jiang Luoli blinked. “Really?”

“Mm, really.”

Jiang Luoli smiled.

“Alright, then let me ask you a question.” Jiang Luoli suddenly had a mischievous thought. “You have to answer me seriously.”

Mo Shixiu nodded immediately. “Alright, ask away.”

“If your mom and I fall into the river one day, who will you save first?” Jiang Luoli threw out a question that was considered a world-class problem for men. “We’re both in danger. You can only save one. Who will you save?”

Mo Shixiu was stunned.

“Luoli, are you… serious?”

“Of course.” Jiang Luoli nodded. “I’m serious.”

Mo Shixiu didn’t say anything else. He lowered his head and seemed to think about her question.

“Luoli, I don’t think this is a difficult question. I thought about it seriously just now. If this really happened, I don’t think I would save anyone.” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“???”

Jiang Luoli was stunned. “You won’t save anyone?”

Did she hear wrongly?

“Mm. Firstly, my mom learned how to swim when she was little, and she even won awards for it. So, if she really falls into the river, she can swim out by herself.”
