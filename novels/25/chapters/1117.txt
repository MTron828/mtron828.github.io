Chapter 1118: Young Master Gong Likes That New Person, After All

He was waiting for Miss Shen.

He regarded Eldest Miss Shen with such importance, so how could he possibly fall in love with another woman?

Moreover, she was a newbie in the entertainment industry who was far better than Miss Shen in all aspects.

She was extremely beautiful in the entertainment industry.

But, who was Young Master Gong?

He had seen many beauties since he was young.

How could he fall in love with someone else just because she was pretty?

However...

Young Master Gong had actually given the MC’s endorsement for the next season to that newbie.

It could be seen that the rumors online weren’t made up by the reporters.

Young Master Gong... really took a fancy to that newbie!

Perhaps after waiting for so many years, Eldest Miss Shen did not give any response, and Young Master Gong’s heart had turned cold.

Gong Zeli laid lazily on the sofa. After listening to the CEO’s report, he nodded. “Okay, sign the contract with them as soon as possible. After the official contract is signed, let the official Weibo release the news.”

“Yes, Young Master Gong. But...”

Gong Zeli glanced at him. “But what?”

MC’s boss looked at his expression and hesitated for a moment before carefully saying, “The spokesperson that we signed with last quarter was very good at bringing goods. After signing with him, our sales almost doubled. Many fans bought our products because of him.”

“We have also revealed on Weibo that we will continue to sign with him. If the fans learn that we have changed our spokesperson, will they stop buying our products in the future?” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

The CEO was quite worried about this.

He was worried that if Qiao Mianmian became the spokesperson for the next quarter, MC’s sales performance would drop drastically.

The CEO didn’t dare to be too direct.

After all, that newcomer was someone Young Master Gong had taken a liking to.

If he expressed his disdain, he would be despised by Young Master Gong later.

Once Young Master Gong despised him, he wouldn’t be able to be the CEO for long.

The CEO didn’t dare to be too direct, but Gong Zeli quickly understood what he meant.

He replied with a nonchalant expression, “MC relied on its own reputation to gain a stable position in the makeup world. If our own product quality is not up to standard, no matter how good an artist is at carrying goods, they will only be able to increase sales by one or two seasons at most. It won’t last long.

“What we need are customers who are interested in the quality of the product, not customers who follow their idols blindly, regardless of the quality of the product. The latter won’t be our MC’s main customer, so it’s not a pity if it’s lost.”

The CEO: “...”

He didn’t care about the guests.

As long as the sales results could go up, he liked it!

“Young Master Gong is right.” The CEO grumbled internally, but on the surface, he said respectfully, “Young Master Gong is the one who sees the problem clearly. An unstable client is indeed not our MC’s main customer.”

He had just finished flattering him when his phone rang.

Seeing that it was a call from the newbie’s manager, the CEO held his phone and said, “Young Master Gong, they called. It should be about the contract.”

Gong Zeli nodded. “Answer the call.”

“Yes.”

The CEO immediately answered the call. After chatting for a few minutes, he hung up.

“Young Master Gong, Miss Qiao has arrived. Her manager has requested to sign the contract today. What do you think...”

“Then, we’ll sign it today.” Gong Zeli’s lazy expression changed slightly. Although he still looked nonchalant, his eyes lit up when he heard Qiao Mianmian’s name.
