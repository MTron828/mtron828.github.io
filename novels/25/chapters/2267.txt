Chapter 2268: Which Girl Wouldn’t Be Envious?

Linda looked at the building, which was filled with modern technology, standing “arrogantly” in the heart of Yuncheng City.

The prices here were unimaginable.

Anyone who could own a house here was super-rich.

But the Mo Corporation had an entire building here.

They were really rich.

What made Linda even more emotional was that the artiste under her was actually the mistress of this building.

What kind of experience was it when an artiste was a hundred times richer than her manager?

Anyway, Linda felt that Qiao Mianmian was the most impressive person she’d ever seen.

She was rich, and so was her husband.

She was beautiful, and so was her husband.

And her husband doted on her so much.

Which girl wouldn’t be envious of such happiness?

…

Qiao Mianmian said goodbye to Linda and walked towards the Mo Corporation building.

She realized that something was wrong the moment she entered the lobby.

There seemed to be a lot of reporters standing by the front desk.

They had the receptionist surrounded and were saying something. The receptionist frowned and shook her head.

Qiao Mianmian was about to go over and see what was going on when a reporter noticed her and immediately exclaimed, “Qiao Mianmian is here.”

The other reporters turned around and were excited to see her.

They immediately walked towards Qiao Mianmian.

“Miss Qiao, are you here to see your fiancé?”

“Miss Qiao, have you seen She Rou’s interview? She intentionally pointed out that she and your fiancé were originally a couple, and the two families were very optimistic about them being together. Because of your interference, her relationship with Mo Yesi is now strained. Do you have any explanation for this?”

“Miss Qiao…”

“Miss Qiao…”

They squeezed in front of Qiao Mianmian and asked her various questions.

Qiao Mianmian then realized what these reporters were here for.

They were probably here to interview Mo Yesi.

Qiao Mianmian was about to speak when a microphone hit her face.

Caught off guard, she winced in pain.

The reporters didn’t see her being hit, nor did they care. They continued to squeeze forward. “Miss Qiao, please answer our questions.”

This group of reporters wanted to get the most timely news and also wanted to stand in the most advantageous position. There was a lot of pushing and shoving.

Qiao Mianmian was almost pushed to the ground by a reporter.

“Young Madam.” Wei Zheng suddenly appeared and held her.

The security officers then immediately stopped the reporters, allowing Wei Zheng to leave with Qiao Mianmian.

A moment later, they entered the elevator.

Wei Zheng looked at her swollen cheek and frowned. “Young Madam, are you injured? I’m sorry I was late. I didn’t know you were there.”

“It’s alright.” Qiao Mianmian shook her head and smiled. “It was just an accident. It’s not serious.”

“Those reporters were really annoying. Chairman Mo already said that he won’t accept any interviews, but they still refuse to leave. If I knew they would hurt you, I would have gotten the security to chase them away.”

“I’m really fine.” Seeing that Wei Zheng was blaming himself, Qiao Mianmian comforted him. “I didn’t tell Mo Yesi I was coming. It’s perfectly normal that you didn’t know.”Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m
